00:00 - so in the series of learning python
00:02 - programming language
00:03 - in the previous video we have discussed
00:06 - like how to download and install
00:08 - ide for python pycharm we have installed
00:11 - and
00:12 - python interpreter you can see python
00:14 - 3.10.6 we have installed right so now i
00:18 - guess you're all set with your laptop
00:20 - you have python you have an id to write
00:22 - your programs right you have that
00:24 - interpreter also
00:26 - okay because python is an interpreted
00:28 - language so we have already
00:30 - now downloaded and installed a base
00:32 - interpreter for our python language
00:35 - i hope you have done this thing
00:37 - now in this video we'll see
00:40 - how to print something on console or you
00:44 - can say we will write our first program
00:46 - in python
00:47 - and what usually we do whenever you
00:49 - learn a new programming language the
00:50 - first program you write is you print
00:53 - that
00:54 - classical hello world
00:56 - on output screen on the console the same
00:58 - thing we will do we'll print hello world
01:01 - on the screen on the console
01:03 - right in python
01:05 - so
01:06 - to print like in c we use which function
01:09 - print a function in c plus plus we use c
01:11 - out to print something on the screen
01:14 - in python what do we use in python 3.10
01:17 - through point x
01:19 - version python 1.x python 2.x python 3.x
01:23 - but python 2.x version they have ended
01:25 - the support for python two point x uh
01:28 - version right two point one two point
01:30 - two like this
01:31 - now
01:32 - three point x we are working on three
01:35 - point ten basically the recent is three
01:36 - point ten point six
01:38 - so in this we have a function named
01:41 - print
01:42 - this is the function print
01:46 - so this we use to print something on the
01:48 - console
01:49 - okay
01:50 - now don't need to read and don't need to
01:52 - write any header file or anything or
01:54 - main function or anything
01:56 - simply you need to write
01:58 - what
02:00 - print whatever you want to print
02:03 - the string or you can say the string
02:06 - or whatever message you want to print
02:08 - that we will put here
02:11 - within these parentheses
02:13 - okay
02:14 - so i want to print hello world so simply
02:17 - in double quotes i'll write
02:19 - hello world
02:24 - that's it no semicolon nothing else
02:27 - if you will run this on your output
02:29 - screen you will get this program this
02:31 - output hello world
02:33 - if you don't print anything if simply
02:36 - you write print and you click on run
02:40 - on that file suppose i have a file the
02:42 - extension of python file is dot py right
02:45 - so
02:46 - we are simply running this thing
02:49 - empty parenthesis
02:51 - it's okay it will run
02:54 - what it will print just a blank line
02:58 - okay
02:59 - nothing would be shown just a blank line
03:02 - cursor would be here nothing would be
03:03 - shown
03:05 - if i want if you execute two print
03:07 - function then one and two two blank line
03:09 - would be shown something like this
03:12 - right
03:14 - so
03:14 - you can say it will
03:16 - the sprint function
03:18 - will produce
03:19 - an invisible new line
03:22 - character new line means add a new line
03:24 - so it will produce an invisible new line
03:27 - character
03:29 - because of that new line character we
03:32 - see
03:32 - you know
03:33 - a
03:34 - new blank line on your screen
03:37 - right i'll show you practically also
03:39 - now whatever you want to print you just
03:41 - write within these
03:44 - codes
03:45 - we let hello world simply write hello
03:47 - world so now let me do some experiment
03:50 - with this uh
03:51 - what you have to write down this how you
03:53 - can write down this thing if you don't
03:55 - put this closing
03:58 - codes what type of error you will get
04:00 - and these things let's just do practical
04:03 - on this
04:04 - uh print function and see before going
04:06 - to practical let me just this this is
04:08 - what in python the syntax is python in
04:10 - python 3 3.x in python two point x the
04:14 - previous uh versions
04:16 - print was just a statement it was not a
04:19 - function so what we used to write in
04:21 - that case print
04:22 - and
04:24 - hello world whatever you need to print
04:26 - you can just
04:28 - write down in these quotes so print
04:30 - hello world that's it no parenthesis
04:33 - so it was considered it was as a
04:35 - statement in python 2.x but here in
04:38 - python 3 it is
04:40 - a function so if you are using python 3
04:43 - point x version right then if you write
04:45 - something like this if you don't put
04:47 - these parentheses you will get
04:49 - error message syntax error message right
04:52 - if you are using python 2.x version you
04:55 - can write down print something like this
04:56 - so let's just do practical of this thing
04:59 - so we have opened our pycharm ide and
05:02 - let me just first
05:04 - change the color
05:06 - so you can go to file if you want to
05:08 - change if you are comfortable with this
05:11 - color you can go for this but i am not
05:13 - comfortable so go to setting
05:15 - and appearance in appearance just theme
05:18 - and
05:19 - i want
05:20 - either this this light
05:22 - or
05:23 - window 10 lite this one
05:26 - so you can go for any one
05:28 - from here you can set these themes okay
05:32 - so now let's change this color and
05:35 - just click ok now i guess you can see it
05:38 - clearly the code fine
05:40 - now
05:41 - we have created our first project in the
05:43 - previous video and first file first dot
05:46 - py okay
05:47 - if you want to create another file what
05:49 - you have to do in the first project on
05:51 - first project just click right click new
05:54 - and file and just name your file
05:57 - okay
05:58 - so i'm not going to create
06:01 - in the first dot py only extension is
06:03 - dot py
06:04 - we are printing so
06:06 - okay
06:07 - how to print just use the sprint
06:09 - function print
06:12 - fine let me just write down again p r i
06:14 - n t print and see it is showing you
06:18 - this is the you know beauty of this ide
06:21 - auto completion and see the print syntax
06:24 - it is showing here you can write down
06:25 - this values sap and file flash whatever
06:28 - these things that also one by one will
06:30 - be discussing but right now just if i
06:33 - just click enter
06:35 - it will give me like these parentheses
06:38 - automatically so now within these
06:40 - parentheses
06:42 - i'm adding
06:44 - hello
06:46 - world
06:48 - okay
06:49 - now let me just run this for you first
06:52 - see from here i have to select here main
06:55 - file is selected so i am going to select
06:57 - current file
06:59 - so current file is first dot py
07:01 - current file means i am working in this
07:03 - file and let's just or you can click in
07:06 - this
07:07 - this is the run button or you can just
07:09 - right click and
07:11 - this run first
07:13 - click on this
07:14 - okay now here
07:16 - it is going to run now and now it will
07:18 - print on your screen hello world first
07:21 - time you know it is taking some time
07:23 - because of the indexing and all
07:25 - so see you can see here hello world
07:28 - fine if i miss this semi-colon this
07:33 - sorry this um
07:35 - double quote closing double quote
07:38 - as you can see a red red underline
07:41 - means there is something
07:43 - wrong there is an error okay so this is
07:46 - what you can say uh
07:49 - this id will give you these kind of
07:51 - things if you use id this is you can see
07:53 - some features or
07:55 - some advantages of using id c missing
07:58 - closing codes
08:00 - so from here only you will come to know
08:02 - yeah you have missed quotes
08:04 - or if you run this
08:05 - here also you will get c now type of
08:07 - error c syntax error syntax error it is
08:11 - a syntax error
08:12 - so types of errors there are many types
08:14 - of error
08:15 - okay that also ah with these parallely
08:18 - with the code we will be seeing
08:21 - this is what syntax error syntax means
08:23 - what there are some rules to write
08:26 - programs in any you know programming
08:29 - language and those rules are known as
08:31 - syntax if you don't follow the syntax
08:34 - then
08:36 - it will give syntax error
08:38 - so now syntax or you can say like we
08:40 - have grammar rules
08:42 - okay
08:43 - same in programming language also we
08:45 - have some rules to write down these
08:47 - programs so these are syntax known as
08:49 - syntax
08:50 - if now it is syntax error because syntax
08:53 - is what in print
08:55 - whatever string the message which is not
08:58 - a code actually
08:59 - see print is a code it will do something
09:01 - it will tell the interpreter to do
09:03 - something but this hello world is
09:06 - rather than hello world i can write
09:07 - jenny's lectures i can write
09:09 - anything else like you are the best
09:12 - so this is just a message it's not a
09:14 - code
09:16 - so other than the code whatever you
09:18 - write the message or the string that we
09:19 - will put in
09:21 - quotes
09:22 - okay single quotes as well as double
09:24 - quotes that also will discuss when to
09:26 - put single code when to put double quote
09:28 - okay now right now i'm putting double
09:30 - quote because actually i am from c and c
09:32 - plus background so
09:34 - to write down string i used to put the
09:36 - string the sequence of character as a
09:38 - string in double quotes
09:40 - okay
09:41 - so now see syntax error it will give
09:43 - syntax error unterminated string literal
09:46 - hello world this is a string literal it
09:48 - is unterminated you haven't terminated
09:50 - this thing detected at line number one
09:53 - line number one
09:55 - this is also a skill to identify what is
09:58 - the error type of error in which line at
10:01 - all
10:02 - okay
10:03 - so you have to you know learn this thing
10:05 - also parallel
10:08 - okay now see you can see one arrow here
10:10 - you have
10:11 - started this string literal but you
10:13 - haven't terminated here in line number
10:15 - one
10:16 - or if you are not getting what is the
10:18 - error just simply
10:20 - the error then text error this thing
10:22 - copy this thing
10:24 - open your google
10:25 - paste that
10:26 - and just click enter
10:28 - okay or more specifically you can write
10:31 - this error in python in whatever
10:32 - programming language you are
10:34 - you know practicing you're learning
10:38 - so generally first you know that link
10:40 - would be from stack overflow so there
10:42 - someone has already asked this type of
10:43 - questions and you will get many answers
10:45 - simple okay so now let's just first what
10:50 - you have to do
10:51 - close this now see after closing
10:54 - this is what
10:56 - syntax highlighting also you need to
10:57 - know the sprint is what in black the
11:00 - string is what in
11:01 - green
11:03 - this hello world plus these codes in
11:05 - green color okay and if you miss this
11:08 - and these
11:09 - ah what you can say
11:12 - so the sprint is what in not in black
11:15 - it's in blue and these parentheses are
11:18 - in black so if you remove this double
11:21 - quote from here this parenthesis and the
11:23 - ending of the parentheses parenthesis
11:24 - this is also in green color so there is
11:26 - something wrong you can identify
11:28 - okay
11:30 - okay now put this one and just
11:33 - run this again so it will print now
11:35 - hello world whatever you want to print
11:36 - you can print now if you don't put this
11:39 - parenthesis
11:41 - will give an error see you can see the
11:43 - red underline here again
11:45 - okay let me just run this
11:47 - and it will give again some error see it
11:50 - is giving syntax error missing
11:52 - parenthesis in call to print
11:55 - did you mean this print you are calling
11:58 - print calling means print is a function
11:59 - so we are calling print but missing
12:01 - parenthesis missing parenthesis
12:03 - because we are using three point
12:04 - exposures and so
12:06 - here you have to put
12:08 - these parentheses
12:09 - okay
12:11 - now
12:12 - okay what you need to do blank print you
12:15 - can call
12:16 - see
12:17 - blank print also you can call it will
12:20 - not print nothing but a blank line it
12:22 - will call an individual new line
12:25 - character so again if i write print
12:29 - and call
12:31 - you will see two blank new line same
12:33 - three four five print plan you will call
12:36 - these blank line would be increased like
12:38 - this i hope now print is clear to you
12:41 - now in next video i'll
12:43 - discuss a coding exercise with you guys
12:46 - okay
12:47 - so i hope every point about print
12:48 - function is clear to you guys how to
12:50 - write down your first program how to
12:52 - print something on console in python now
12:54 - in the next video we will see a coding
12:56 - exercise related to this print function
12:58 - right so i'll see you in the next video
13:00 - till then bye take

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning python programming language in the previous video we have discussed like how to download and install ide for python pycharm we have installed and python interpreter you can see python 3.10.6 we have installed right so now i guess you're all set with your laptop you have python you have an id to write your programs right you have that interpreter also okay because python is an interpreted language so we have already now downloaded and installed a base interpreter for our python language i hope you have done this thing now in this video we'll see how to print something on console or you can say we will write our first program in python and what usually we do whenever you learn a new programming language the first program you write is you print that classical hello world on output screen on the console the same thing we will do we'll print hello world on the screen on the console right in python so to print like in c we use which function print a function in c plus plus we use c out to print something on the screen in python what do we use in python 3.10 through point x version python 1.x python 2.x python 3.x but python 2.x version they have ended the support for python two point x uh version right two point one two point two like this now three point x we are working on three point ten basically the recent is three point ten point six so in this we have a function named print this is the function print so this we use to print something on the console okay now don't need to read and don't need to write any header file or anything or main function or anything simply you need to write what print whatever you want to print the string or you can say the string or whatever message you want to print that we will put here within these parentheses okay so i want to print hello world so simply in double quotes i'll write hello world that's it no semicolon nothing else if you will run this on your output screen you will get this program this output hello world if you don't print anything if simply you write print and you click on run on that file suppose i have a file the extension of python file is dot py right so we are simply running this thing empty parenthesis it's okay it will run what it will print just a blank line okay nothing would be shown just a blank line cursor would be here nothing would be shown if i want if you execute two print function then one and two two blank line would be shown something like this right so you can say it will the sprint function will produce an invisible new line character new line means add a new line so it will produce an invisible new line character because of that new line character we see you know a new blank line on your screen right i'll show you practically also now whatever you want to print you just write within these codes we let hello world simply write hello world so now let me do some experiment with this uh what you have to write down this how you can write down this thing if you don't put this closing codes what type of error you will get and these things let's just do practical on this uh print function and see before going to practical let me just this this is what in python the syntax is python in python 3 3.x in python two point x the previous uh versions print was just a statement it was not a function so what we used to write in that case print and hello world whatever you need to print you can just write down in these quotes so print hello world that's it no parenthesis so it was considered it was as a statement in python 2.x but here in python 3 it is a function so if you are using python 3 point x version right then if you write something like this if you don't put these parentheses you will get error message syntax error message right if you are using python 2.x version you can write down print something like this so let's just do practical of this thing so we have opened our pycharm ide and let me just first change the color so you can go to file if you want to change if you are comfortable with this color you can go for this but i am not comfortable so go to setting and appearance in appearance just theme and i want either this this light or window 10 lite this one so you can go for any one from here you can set these themes okay so now let's change this color and just click ok now i guess you can see it clearly the code fine now we have created our first project in the previous video and first file first dot py okay if you want to create another file what you have to do in the first project on first project just click right click new and file and just name your file okay so i'm not going to create in the first dot py only extension is dot py we are printing so okay how to print just use the sprint function print fine let me just write down again p r i n t print and see it is showing you this is the you know beauty of this ide auto completion and see the print syntax it is showing here you can write down this values sap and file flash whatever these things that also one by one will be discussing but right now just if i just click enter it will give me like these parentheses automatically so now within these parentheses i'm adding hello world okay now let me just run this for you first see from here i have to select here main file is selected so i am going to select current file so current file is first dot py current file means i am working in this file and let's just or you can click in this this is the run button or you can just right click and this run first click on this okay now here it is going to run now and now it will print on your screen hello world first time you know it is taking some time because of the indexing and all so see you can see here hello world fine if i miss this semicolon this sorry this um double quote closing double quote as you can see a red red underline means there is something wrong there is an error okay so this is what you can say uh this id will give you these kind of things if you use id this is you can see some features or some advantages of using id c missing closing codes so from here only you will come to know yeah you have missed quotes or if you run this here also you will get c now type of error c syntax error syntax error it is a syntax error so types of errors there are many types of error okay that also ah with these parallely with the code we will be seeing this is what syntax error syntax means what there are some rules to write programs in any you know programming language and those rules are

single code when to put double quote okay now right now i'm putting double quote because actually i am from c and c plus background so to write down string i used to put the string the sequence of character as a string in double quotes okay so now see syntax error it will give syntax error unterminated string literal hello world this is a string literal it is unterminated you haven't terminated this thing detected at line number one line number one this is also a skill to identify what is the error type of error in which line at all okay so you have to you know learn this thing also parallel okay now see you can see one arrow here you have started this string literal but you haven't terminated here in line number one or if you are not getting what is the error just simply the error then text error this thing copy this thing open your google paste that and just click enter okay or more specifically you can write this error in python in whatever programming language you are you know practicing you're learning so generally first you know that link would be from stack overflow so there someone has already asked this type of questions and you will get many answers simple okay so now let's just first what you have to do close this now see after closing this is what syntax highlighting also you need to know the sprint is what in black the string is what in green this hello world plus these codes in green color okay and if you miss this and these ah what you can say so the sprint is what in not in black it's in blue and these parentheses are in black so if you remove this double quote from here this parenthesis and the ending of the parentheses parenthesis this is also in green color so there is something wrong you can identify okay okay now put this one and just run this again so it will print now hello world whatever you want to print you can print now if you don't put this parenthesis will give an error see you can see the red underline here again okay let me just run this and it will give again some error see it is giving syntax error missing parenthesis in call to print did you mean this print you are calling print calling means print is a function so we are calling print but missing parenthesis missing parenthesis because we are using three point exposures and so here you have to put these parentheses okay now okay what you need to do blank print you can call see blank print also you can call it will not print nothing but a blank line it will call an individual new line character so again if i write print and call you will see two blank new line same three four five print plan you will call these blank line would be increased like this i hope now print is clear to you now in next video i'll discuss a coding exercise with you guys okay so i hope every point about print function is clear to you guys how to write down your first program how to print something on console in python now in the next video we will see a coding exercise related to this print function right so i'll see you in the next video till then bye take
