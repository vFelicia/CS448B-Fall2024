00:00 - hey everyone I hope you all are safe and
00:01 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:03 - Python programming language in the
00:04 - previous video we have discussed about
00:05 - dictionaries in Python right now in this
00:09 - video we will see when coding exercise
00:11 - based on dictionary so I would recommend
00:13 - please watch out that video first then
00:15 - come to this video now what is this
00:17 - coding exercise
00:18 - first thing we have a dictionary right
00:21 - now we have like marks of students in
00:25 - the form of dictionary as you can see on
00:27 - my screen this is a dictionary student
00:28 - Mark and here I am having name of the
00:31 - students and their marks right names are
00:35 - keys and their marks are values key and
00:38 - value pair we are having this dictionary
00:40 - we have so you can note down this thing
00:42 - now what you have to do you have to
00:44 - write down a program that will convert
00:46 - these given marks into grades
00:51 - so basically now you have to make
00:54 - another dictionary whatever name you can
00:56 - take like student underscore grade you
00:58 - can take and in that dictionary name of
01:01 - the students would be as a tease but
01:03 - rather than marks grades would be there
01:08 - you have to convert those marks into
01:11 - grades and what are the criteria
01:13 - if marks are between 91 200 then grade
01:16 - is a plus 81 to 90 a 71 to 80 B plus
01:20 - like this this is the grading system you
01:23 - have to provide below 40 it's F so you
01:26 - can just note down this thing also okay
01:28 - now you have that student marked
01:31 - dictionary you have the grading system
01:33 - now you have to convert
01:36 - you have to just access what marks of
01:38 - the student and you have to put if
01:40 - condition if grade is between this then
01:43 - like grade so like you know marks is
01:46 - greater than 90 so grade is a plus so
01:48 - what you will do
01:50 - the hint is you can take an empty
01:52 - dictionary student grade and in that
01:54 - dictionary you can just put student
01:55 - names and then
01:57 - grade rather than marks
01:59 - I hope now we are getting my point so
02:02 - please laugh pause the video and give it
02:04 - a try
02:05 - so I hope you have tried this out now
02:07 - let's do this exercise together create a
02:10 - new file and you'll see we'll write down
02:14 - coding exercise
02:16 - underscore
02:17 - dictionaries date Dot py okay now just
02:24 - make that same student marks that
02:27 - dictionary okay
02:29 - so now this dictionary we have student
02:31 - marks
02:32 - how how you will do that thing to access
02:35 - these marks using keys we can access
02:39 - so you have to Loop through this
02:40 - dictionary first gen you will access
02:43 - then marks then on marks will put some
02:44 - condition then Harry then marks them on
02:47 - that we'll put some condition so for
02:49 - Loop four
02:51 - student in
02:54 - student marks
02:56 - see this thing we have discussed in
02:57 - previous video if I write down this
02:59 - thing then this student this for Loop if
03:02 - I print student then this for Loop will
03:03 - access all the keys all the keys only
03:06 - right
03:08 - that way that's why I recommend you to
03:10 - watch previous video first so now
03:12 - in student we are having first Jenny
03:14 - then Harry dimpy Rahul aniketh and Prem
03:16 - like this so according to this journey
03:19 - we can access the marks how we can
03:21 - access the marks
03:23 - we are taking a variable marks and how
03:25 - we will access
03:27 - the dictionary name student marks and in
03:30 - bracket just provide the key so first
03:34 - key would be in student this variable
03:37 - right
03:38 - so first time in student in this
03:40 - variable what would be assigned
03:43 - generally
03:46 - now student marks Jenny student marks
03:49 - Jennifer and marks is the student
03:50 - magazine in 92 so 92 would be fetched in
03:52 - this line and in marks now we have 92.
03:57 - now we can put condition on marks so if
04:01 - Mass greater than 90 okay
04:06 - then
04:07 - now what you have to make because you
04:10 - will not change in this dictionary so we
04:12 - will make a second dictionary so let's
04:14 - take an empty dictionary
04:16 - student grade
04:19 - this is what it's an empty dictionary
04:21 - now in student grade we have to put
04:27 - the student name as key and
04:30 - this grade of the student as
04:35 - values right so
04:38 - the name of the dictionary is student
04:40 - grades empty dictionary and in bracket
04:44 - same obviously the name should be same
04:47 - these Keys would be same in both the
04:49 - dictionaries so just same key student
04:52 - whatever the case student
04:54 - and here what you will assign
04:56 - according to this grade is a plus
05:01 - I hope you heard this process see now
05:03 - marks till now marks 92 so check 92
05:07 - greater than 90 yes condition true
05:08 - condition true means you will enter in
05:10 - this control and student grade this is
05:13 - an empty dictionary in student right now
05:16 - we are having Jenny so
05:19 - the key would be have to add an element
05:21 - that also we have discussed right so
05:23 - Jenny a plus would be added to this
05:26 - student grade first item Jenny a plus
05:29 - key and value pair right like this we
05:31 - will do for all the conditions right
05:33 - second condition is
05:34 - alif
05:37 - marks greater than 80.
05:40 - right in that case same in student
05:43 - grades and
05:45 - student
05:47 - what you will
05:49 - put a
05:51 - right
05:53 - like this I guess you can put all the
05:55 - conditions in else simply f
05:58 - and after that after this for Loop we
06:01 - are going to just print
06:03 - student grade this dictionary
06:06 - right
06:08 - so let's run this and see
06:11 - see
06:12 - Jenny a plus Harry B plus dimpy C Rahul
06:17 - D again A Plus and frame f
06:22 - I hope you got this see no need to put
06:24 - this condition maybe you are confused
06:25 - here you should put marks greater than
06:27 - 80 and
06:28 - less than 90 no need to put these and
06:32 - condition because see if suppose let's
06:35 - take one condition one example marks 82
06:39 - so first thing first this if condition
06:42 - would be checked 82 greater than 90 no
06:44 - so obviously this will not enter the
06:47 - control will not enter into this if else
06:49 - if second condition is true yes then a
06:52 - would be printed suppose marks 92.
06:56 - first this if condition would be checked
06:58 - 92 greater than 90 yes condition true so
07:01 - in this
07:01 - control we will enter in this block and
07:03 - a plus
07:04 - right
07:06 - so if this condition has been triggered
07:08 - then all the other condition would be
07:10 - skipped so no need to put logical and
07:12 - condition like greater than 80 and less
07:14 - than 90 greater than 70 and less than
07:17 - it is something like this no this one
07:19 - condition is NF now if you are not
07:21 - getting this thing you can just write
07:23 - down this thing uh all the you know code
07:25 - in a piece of paper and write on this
07:27 - thing with different different example
07:29 - different different marks of the
07:31 - students one by one with hand you can
07:33 - write on this and definitely it's not so
07:35 - messed up right so that's it and sorry
07:38 - to frame if anyone who is watching whose
07:41 - name is brain because
07:42 - I give only 34 marks
07:45 - but that is just an example okay okay so
07:48 - I hope you got this exercise this was
07:49 - not so much tough and actually we will
07:52 - see nested dictionaries as well as list
07:54 - so now I'll say the next video till then
07:55 - bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have discussed about dictionaries in Python right now in this video we will see when coding exercise based on dictionary so I would recommend please watch out that video first then come to this video now what is this coding exercise first thing we have a dictionary right now we have like marks of students in the form of dictionary as you can see on my screen this is a dictionary student Mark and here I am having name of the students and their marks right names are keys and their marks are values key and value pair we are having this dictionary we have so you can note down this thing now what you have to do you have to write down a program that will convert these given marks into grades so basically now you have to make another dictionary whatever name you can take like student underscore grade you can take and in that dictionary name of the students would be as a tease but rather than marks grades would be there you have to convert those marks into grades and what are the criteria if marks are between 91 200 then grade is a plus 81 to 90 a 71 to 80 B plus like this this is the grading system you have to provide below 40 it's F so you can just note down this thing also okay now you have that student marked dictionary you have the grading system now you have to convert you have to just access what marks of the student and you have to put if condition if grade is between this then like grade so like you know marks is greater than 90 so grade is a plus so what you will do the hint is you can take an empty dictionary student grade and in that dictionary you can just put student names and then grade rather than marks I hope now we are getting my point so please laugh pause the video and give it a try so I hope you have tried this out now let's do this exercise together create a new file and you'll see we'll write down coding exercise underscore dictionaries date Dot py okay now just make that same student marks that dictionary okay so now this dictionary we have student marks how how you will do that thing to access these marks using keys we can access so you have to Loop through this dictionary first gen you will access then marks then on marks will put some condition then Harry then marks them on that we'll put some condition so for Loop four student in student marks see this thing we have discussed in previous video if I write down this thing then this student this for Loop if I print student then this for Loop will access all the keys all the keys only right that way that's why I recommend you to watch previous video first so now in student we are having first Jenny then Harry dimpy Rahul aniketh and Prem like this so according to this journey we can access the marks how we can access the marks we are taking a variable marks and how we will access the dictionary name student marks and in bracket just provide the key so first key would be in student this variable right so first time in student in this variable what would be assigned generally now student marks Jenny student marks Jennifer and marks is the student magazine in 92 so 92 would be fetched in this line and in marks now we have 92. now we can put condition on marks so if Mass greater than 90 okay then now what you have to make because you will not change in this dictionary so we will make a second dictionary so let's take an empty dictionary student grade this is what it's an empty dictionary now in student grade we have to put the student name as key and this grade of the student as values right so the name of the dictionary is student grades empty dictionary and in bracket same obviously the name should be same these Keys would be same in both the dictionaries so just same key student whatever the case student and here what you will assign according to this grade is a plus I hope you heard this process see now marks till now marks 92 so check 92 greater than 90 yes condition true condition true means you will enter in this control and student grade this is an empty dictionary in student right now we are having Jenny so the key would be have to add an element that also we have discussed right so Jenny a plus would be added to this student grade first item Jenny a plus key and value pair right like this we will do for all the conditions right second condition is alif marks greater than 80. right in that case same in student grades and student what you will put a right like this I guess you can put all the conditions in else simply f and after that after this for Loop we are going to just print student grade this dictionary right so let's run this and see see Jenny a plus Harry B plus dimpy C Rahul D again A Plus and frame f I hope you got this see no need to put this condition maybe you are confused here you should put marks greater than 80 and less than 90 no need to put these and condition because see if suppose let's take one condition one example marks 82 so first thing first this if condition would be checked 82 greater than 90 no so obviously this will not enter the control will not enter into this if else if second condition is true yes then a would be printed suppose marks 92. first this if condition would be checked 92 greater than 90 yes condition true so in this control we will enter in this block and a plus right so if this condition has been triggered then all the other condition would be skipped so no need to put logical and condition like greater than 80 and less than 90 greater than 70 and less than it is something like this no this one condition is NF now if you are not getting this thing you can just write down this thing uh all the you know code in a piece of paper and write on this thing with different different example different different marks of the students one by one with hand you can write on this and definitely it's not so messed up right so that's it and sorry to frame if anyone who is watching whose name is brain because I give only 34 marks but that is just an example okay okay so I hope you got this exercise this was not so much tough and actually we will see nested dictionaries as well as list so now I'll say the next video till then bye take care
