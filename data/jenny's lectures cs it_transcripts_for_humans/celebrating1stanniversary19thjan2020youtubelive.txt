06:57 - know go for the logic you have to
06:59 - understand how to practice on that that
07:02 - is the only way
07:04 - if an attack algorithm you should write
07:06 - down that program at your own you should
07:10 - write on that program one by one Bridal
07:12 - means without any ID on pen or paper
07:16 - using pen or paper right here in that
07:19 - program that this whole loop will be run

07:58 - need to completely be a mess then I'm
08:02 - planning to start C C++ or maybe it
08:05 - would actually do algorithms because for
08:07 - algorithm you can say foot da but that's
08:10 - a project and getting new request right
08:13 - so I'm thinking to start that one here
08:17 - like you're teaching very much well

09:32 - basically so after completing this
09:35 - normalization topic then I will start
09:39 - new subject

14:29 - he just one suggestion but tree down
14:33 - your position can you please send me
14:36 - again because because of many comments
14:39 - how do we learn all the programming
14:41 - skills a you cannot learn programming
14:45 - skill first of all you have to practice
14:47 - right and no one is perfect just
14:50 - practice practice injected I still
14:54 - remember when I was doing empty I was
14:56 - not good at programming would you wonder
14:59 - let the program be little baby seriously
15:04 - to be very few practicals they put the
15:06 - heat oh yeah you definitely program that
15:08 - is it it's over stick butter Co Garin
15:10 - pasta Java but after the potential idea
15:14 - is very important
15:15 - skipper you know I started practice
15:19 - practice in practice you have to build
15:21 - your own watch you do try at least I
15:24 - know it's not so easy it's starting
15:27 - you have knee problem Dickey and parnell
15:30 - logic in theory yes I know that is so
15:33 - easy but of course obviously you have to
15:36 - start from somewhere basics
15:38 - - operator you have to practice that
15:40 - thing try to develop your own virtue try
15:42 - to attend that program rather than on
15:44 - compiler first of all is fully cooperate
15:46 - people say with your hand
15:48 - nobody key on that ID that is why I
15:51 - prefer we don't explain that you know my
15:55 - program in my videos on that bolo me
15:59 - rather than on an ID right and you brine
16:03 - on that program because of some hope a
16:06 - child let that concept up it was like
16:08 - after that yeah obviously I you know
16:11 - make a score under 12 output it to say a
16:14 - and against a bar you know in the video
16:16 - black McKee had a belonging acceptable
16:20 - and scale so this can appraise it now
16:24 - practically nahi but as modular
16:26 - programming me I said we could achieve
16:28 - over third starting mania pull-up thank
16:31 - in Ireland but it's villagers are
16:35 - starting I was also one of you the
16:43 - operator in see hey when I start when I
16:46 - start see then only he'll cover these
16:49 - subjects I'm confused where to start and
16:52 - programming where to start if you don't
16:56 - know anything then definitely you can
16:57 - start from see that is the basic
16:59 - language a very simple language
17:02 - obviously hello world hello world hello
17:06 - is very right but just I'm kidding see
17:10 - language um Sikorski basics start Peru
17:13 - the IDH go to study programs Panama
17:15 - shiro kuroh steam bother micrograms
17:18 - balance activism right this case every
17:21 - technique is ready programming both hard
17:24 - with you if I can do I'm sure you can
17:28 - also do what are your hobbies
17:35 - I just love to solve puzzles do you
17:43 - think solo como gap which were present
17:47 - so become I mean it was all worth
17:49 - investing
17:53 - okay look for my et left now hey thanks
17:57 - ta and then it is to me to offer it on
18:05 - GRE them with Harwood you can woman if
18:15 - you want to look more than me must work
18:16 - GRE is how do I maintain it if you think
18:31 - that's not a religion okay
18:39 - data structure structure I'm sorry I was
18:47 - not able to get on that see how to dope
18:51 - the it is just give your best image so
18:56 - Joe Caputo come and just give you invest
18:59 - right happy so to put your top Kani exam
19:05 - is oh I guess holy pressure create will
19:08 - act on screen I boost I'm very happy a
19:10 - source to a beautifully up unum best in
19:15 - each other they are Academy handed to me
19:16 - occurs in the article basics clear
19:19 - through previous in pushing papers all
19:21 - through of course there is a question
19:25 - here anyways for college students per
19:32 - goal is against for first year it will
19:34 - be different for second year third year
19:36 - and finally it will be different in
19:38 - which year you are it depends
19:44 - hey I'm from Pakistan hello dear
19:54 - okay I'm getting many comments so I'm
20:00 - not able to read out all the comments
20:02 - actually CSE will be better yes
20:14 - Heidi or CSU are asking them see
20:18 - according to me I don't know but
20:20 - according to me will be better tips for
20:26 - second year
20:27 - okay secondly it means maybe you are
20:31 - having a data structure known so just
20:34 - focus on your programming skills right
20:39 - if you want to go for a product based
20:41 - companies not a service based companies
20:44 - right just focus on the main means of
20:47 - projects and it's not like that you have
20:49 - to be good in all the subjects right and
20:53 - apart from that you definitely try to do
20:56 - something extra which you can add in
20:59 - your resume after completing your BTech
21:02 - do not waste your four years just in you
21:05 - know regular study in college if you are
21:10 - very good in programming just you know
21:12 - you can join any you can be a freelancer
21:15 - or you can you know contribute in any
21:20 - means that is for those who are very
21:23 - good in any open source project means do
21:28 - some some training or something like
21:30 - that or maybe he internship a very good
21:34 - company so that you can add that client
21:38 - in you and that will you know differ you
21:42 - from other students SME okay harnesses
21:46 - we taking here or up please many
21:49 - watching TV make surfing yeah your
21:52 - introduction your you know that career
21:55 - objective your details your name like
22:00 - that right which is different will not
22:02 - it is moving me to interview to attract
22:06 - July birthday
22:08 - yay good chat is never cheat I have with
22:10 - techniques otherwise we get to submit at
22:13 - the inside a subject some people think
22:14 - you should do something different right
22:18 - maybe at least one thing you can do okay
22:29 - hello from IIT Lucknow thanks dear
22:33 - Java basics yeah oh yeah I can teach you
22:38 - not start right now
22:40 - Oh Java because you see I'm free I have
22:44 - told you many times because I'm not a
22:45 - team actually I'm a single person and I
22:49 - have job also so I cannot start all the
22:53 - subjects at the same time now so it's
22:58 - very tough dynamic programming
23:04 - okay whether I have already uploaded
23:05 - some videos on dynamic programming but
23:09 - okay and solve some more problems with
23:11 - that I'll try to complete that I think
23:19 - pattern would be maybe you know the
23:22 - language which is I'm friendly should I
23:24 - think you should go for that one so
23:29 - according to me okay like a big company
23:42 - s I mean heck II see if you are a
23:45 - thresher to SME in River Rock six feet
23:49 - for a campus of pooja town I'm telling
23:52 - you the truth
23:53 - right woopsie expect for the company
23:56 - over Amazon Microsoft edge forgive them
23:57 - when you have technically you know the
24:00 - basics a people capability here that you
24:03 - can solve the problem at least it's not
24:04 - like that normally program there and you
24:06 - have to approve them correct to scar
24:10 - logic with my hair off good energy canal
24:13 - if party up keep the now you know search
24:16 - party who logically given in critical
24:18 - thinking logically you cows may use cut
24:21 - right as an AV output on the heat cilia
24:25 - right you have to be learn that because
24:29 - when we ate it oh maybe I'll put an
24:31 - immediate thing for three months or six
24:33 - months the Jobi language and go chill
24:36 - with yoga platform on which a yoga
24:39 - they'll train you on that working
24:42 - learning capability thickness at the
24:44 - basics cleared on each even skinny right
24:46 - so interview you can look for essa
24:49 - personal Haley R Medusa Pucci on
24:51 - actually made once with a fever little
24:53 - meter program subcellular GSN a second
24:57 - thing you have very fun feeding at that
24:59 - time right we have it a Peggy if you are
25:03 - able to express her you know knowledge
25:06 - or not
25:07 - Kaplan book can make our path a path you
25:09 - may be some students are very good so
25:12 - push her tempo but at the time of
25:14 - interview oh no they get you nervous or
25:16 - gopinatha birthing
25:18 - some students are average students
25:21 - through people's in sixty percent marks
25:23 - criteria I guess 60 to 65 a few tiny
25:26 - 8090 valleys but fiscal path my
25:30 - communication skills with one chain
25:32 - right yeah that is very important point
25:34 - a via communication skills to both zero
25:37 - do you mean will be second gear may move
25:41 - who's very focused and I salsa right
25:43 - because when you will be in third your
25:46 - final year so scary time come Bettina
25:48 - time their placement which other camping
25:51 - that first year second year we have open
25:52 - communication skills figure I'll hand
25:54 - them out right as far as I normally
25:58 - according the telling me right
26:00 - maybe she also put yoga to watch along

26:37 - is our thing
26:38 - I don't care except it it's the which
26:41 - type of videos you want you can tell me
26:44 - how to think logically programming
26:46 - please please Amy
26:50 - push not be how think method a pop quiz
26:54 - so Tina cases it has a time problems
26:58 - they put it in Java
27:00 - TK was curry excess oil Yaya Han
27:03 - whenever we develop an operator pkcs was
27:07 - watching our house Prabhupada me to
27:09 - Schoology Kalinin and she's eaten each
27:11 - other problems of the cookie flagellum
27:13 - cancel the problem the idea but that's a
27:16 - little jealous type of problem head
27:18 - tourism logic a status illogical still
27:20 - barn you know you can modify it yourself
27:23 - right because I know I have when once I
27:27 - have published a research paper town
27:30 - graham Roubini algorithm so many being a
27:33 - yachtie the neighbor that I give made in
27:36 - the programming proper oozma Kappa me
27:38 - Anita pop down on that it took me around
27:41 - three to four days but before that you
27:44 - know concentrate 30 watt so chivos
27:47 - keeper and he much it cannot be so I see
27:50 - algorithm for your program Oh be
27:51 - modified person you were right or was
27:54 - made a round-robin car Joe result I had
27:57 - Oh many you know here he'll worry the
28:00 - month program just a better car rather
28:02 - than the conventional Robin algorithm
28:05 - now see right so both SSO functional
28:10 - data disk over here are the problems
28:12 - they prove it is not resolution gave
28:14 - hope you can gotta try the row will be
28:15 - Iowa with SS which man was to negative
28:21 - Matawai Bacardi Marcus Lee Elia over so

28:27 - yes actually it's my house
28:36 - he compared to getting is slow yeah I
28:44 - seriously have no idea about that exam
28:48 - but exam but hey slow examined gate exam
28:52 - I have idea that are top because I have
28:55 - tried both I have rightfully so as well
28:59 - but I was not preparing so much I say
29:01 - may the initial anything manly want
29:04 - question him each C++ okay hey love from
29:15 - neighborhood neighborhood where means
29:22 - maybe the Ricky sign because they okay
29:27 - yes I think design how hi ma'am hi Jenny
29:35 - convo
29:37 - thanks I feel like no matter looks no me
29:45 - are doing massive day shift Cappadonna
29:49 - proper anything you pee I think next
29:56 - should be Python Karthik I think but if
30:02 - you have interest in Java then you can
30:05 - go for that gate exam daily puts tips
30:13 - but I do get exam be high arts and even
30:20 - I have to admit exam so please don't

button on my channel right so that button in simple terms if I say then that is here you can say if you want to support the strainer or if you want to donate something then you can join my channel if you want to be a you know efficient Jerry's lectures then you can join this channel but but but this is completely optional completely it's not like that if you will not join then see I am getting many like queries my will be paid now means those who will join your show those only we'll get your videos it's not like that see my video completely free so if you don't want to join then also you can see my videos regularly whenever I will upload my videos right join button is not free C at all you know this is something you can say assembled right and definitely if you will join this channel then definitely those members will get something extra maybe some videos or maybe we have two levels so if more members will join then definitely some live session would be exclusively for you can see with those members only because you know I'm getting many comments right now so I cannot read out all the comments fine so maybe you want to ask something and we don't you account at this time so if you are an you know Janey's special member if you will join my channel then definitely we know will not be you know so many members in that group so definitely I can answer your queries right but let what happens okay yes one for requested getting because two dates I guess interracial match so I was getting many requests mem please postpone the time but I couldn't do that because of some you know I know I will read but yeah sure definitely it's not like that I will be like or 30 minutes certify for one ask will kill this session short maybe 10 minutes or 15 minutes and we'll meet on next you

Neoga he like be memory and so that's all I wanted to say you today especially I know I'm alive today because they are completely kidding when he it's her first year in university so I want to say thank you to all of you especially to those people you know when I start in the channel and that having zero subscriber 10 subscriber 50 subscribers and less than hundreds of simple right and that time you know supported me and clay and that time I still remember I was getting some comments not many comments icons in many convinced but he has some comings 103 something that mom definitely will

and I hope you guys will support me many more is right I'm from Sri Lanka hey me know how you mean you see Bob see balance here great man thank you so much bye son hey I cannot start by thin right now if you are promotion channel you are living in which city I live in good calm how to remember her elbow I think only one thing I want to say you know to stop us imagine ah hello Chico right ruski body SME apnea in Korea VTEC me what an exam happened I will go step by step of neon Scalia that's it no if you want to remember that I Buddhism or any meaningful lesson then you have to you know go for the logic you have to understand how to practice on that that is the only way if an attack algorithm you should write down that program at your own you should write on that program one by one Bridal means without any ID on pen or paper using pen or paper right here in that program that this whole loop will be run this time I will write now I cannot we thank you so much first of all automatically I cannot start right now some distorted maybe I have some problem in the smile today I guess let me check okay can you please start by that and what a car okay I'm sorry Karthik right now I cannot start by then because first of all I need to completely be a mess then I'm planning to start C C++ or maybe it would actually do algorithms because for algorithm you can say foot da but that's a project and getting new request right so I'm thinking to start that one here like you're teaching very much well thank you so much okay I think my connection is unstable so I'm it's hanging out gate D a sustainable designs class of sod homes the triples become little spaces see I cannot start anything because I'm right now focusing on net and gate actually but syllabus is not like that because I have also time great for nature Phyllis Peaks and computer science when I was preparing for name right so it's same how my gaze it will take to complete DBMS I can say but maybe around one month maybe but I am planning to start after completing this normalization concept means I guess we are left with multivalue dependency and the fourth normal form and fifth normal form basically so after completing this normalization topic then I will start new subject right because Asian is you know very important for the point of view of created net example that I have already completed okay hi from Sri Lankan hi from India let's get married yeah microprocessor lectures yeah that I will start by one go ma'am okay yeah good night good night how are you I'm good from Siobhan's okay so named mine okay please teacher in my knowledge engineering college but for quite a teacher hey so good in Python Ashley yeah I can teach but I am NOT you know an export type of in Python so occupy three you know Python language carajo is a better than um a knife at home but definitely is only out of their only lordship means TVB shots on techno match be and fly be okay you may hello hello ishtam you are a good teacher thank you yeah only out oh yeah that's sad news main difficulty no dear I'm not yeah I'm working in a car I'm a sister please don't ask now in which college right yeah I think you're yeah I know I am getting this error but your connection is unstable to me and I don't know why I am giving this problem today hi hi okay which college CI first that I negate will you not do not ask in which college how to buy a very smart teacher well thank you so much what is your read score my gates were was around I remember that percentile around 94% time Oh week she really connect is see me but Vanessa I cannot rely on that thing mucho la vía hang and thank you my many please go see language lectures okay and in equivalent in Jenny's lectures Lori good mate right now yes I'm assistant professor you do job yeah I am amen please start I'm sorry idiot I didn't read out that things I'm sorry Johnny which city yet bread Oh city at all you know the garden DC yes seriously I don't know yeah maybe that microprocessor and electronics that I can teach from EC branch any other subject I don't think I can teach means you have Romney see branch right okay you know college I am assistant professor in there is lectures I am he just one suggestion but tree down your position can you please send me again because because of many comments how do we learn all the programming skills a you cannot learn programming skill first of all you have to practice right and no one is perfect just practice practice injected I still remember when I was doing empty I was not good at programming would you wonder let the program be little baby seriously to be very few practicals they put the heat oh yeah you definitely program that is it it's over stick butter Co Garin pasta Java but after the potential idea is very important skipper you know I started practice practice in practice you have to build your own watch you do try at least I know it's not so easy it's starting you have knee problem Dickey and parnell logic in theory yes I know that is so easy but of course obviously you have to start from somewhere basics operator you have to practice that thing try to develop your own virtue try to attend that program rather than on compiler first of all is fully cooperate people say with your hand nobody key on that ID that is why I prefer we don't explain that you know my program in my videos on that bolo me rather than on an ID right and you brine on that program because of some hope a child let that concept up it was like after that yeah obviously I you know make a score under 12 output it to say a and against a bar you know in the video black McKee had a belonging acceptable and scale so this can appraise it now practically nahi but as modular programming me I said we could achieve over third starting mania pullup thank in Ireland but it's villagers are starting I was also one of you the operator in see hey when I start when I start see then only he'll cover these subjects I'm confused where to start and programming where to start if you don't know anything then definitely you can start from see that is the basic language a very simple language obviously hello world hello world hello is very right but just I'm kidding see language um Sikorski basics start Peru the IDH go to study programs Panama shiro kuroh steam bother micrograms balance activism right this case every technique is ready programming both hard with you if I can do I'm sure you can also do what are your hobbies I just love to solve puzzles do you think solo como gap which were present so become I mean it was all worth investing okay look for my et left now hey thanks ta and then it is to me to offer it on GRE them with Harwood you can woman if you want to look more than me must work GRE is how do I maintain it if you think that's not a religion okay data structure structure I'm sorry I was not able to get on that see how to dope the it is just give your best image so Joe Caputo come and just give you invest right happy so to put your top Kani exam is oh I guess holy pressure create will act on screen I boost I'm very happy a source to a beautifully up unum best in each other they are Academy handed to me occurs in the article basics clear through previous in pushing papers all through of course there is a question here anyways for college students per goal is against for first year it will be different for second year third year and finally it will be different in which year you are it depends hey I'm from Pakistan hello dear okay I'm getting many comments so I'm not able to read out all the comments actually CSE will be better yes Heidi or CSU are asking them see according to me I don't know but according to me will be better tips for second year okay secondly it means maybe you are having a data structure known so just focus on your programming skills right if you want to go for a product based companies not a service based companies right just focus on the main means of projects and it's not like that you have to be good in all the subjects right and apart from that you definitely try to do something extra which you can add in your resume after completing your BTech do not waste your four years just in you know regular study in college if you are very good in programming just you know you can join any you can be a freelancer or you can you know contribute in any means that is for those who are very good in any open source project means do some some training or something like that or maybe he internship a very good company so that you can add that client in you and that will you know differ you from other students SME okay harnesses we taking here or up please many watching TV make surfing yeah your introduction your you know that career objective your details your name like that right which is different will not it is moving me to interview to attract July birthday yay good chat is never cheat I have with techniques otherwise we get to submit at the inside a subject some people think you should do something different right maybe at least one thing you can do okay hello from IIT Lucknow thanks dear Java basics yeah oh yeah I can teach you not start right now Oh Java because you see I'm free I have told you many times because I'm not a team actually I'm a single person and I have job also so I cannot start all the subjects at the same time now so it's very tough dynamic programming okay whether I have already uploaded some videos on dynamic programming but okay and solve some more problems with that I'll try to complete that I think pattern would be maybe you know the language which is I'm friendly should I think you should go for that one so according to me okay like a big company s I mean heck II see if you are a thresher to SME in River Rock six feet for a campus of pooja town I'm telling you the truth right woopsie expect for the company over Amazon Microsoft edge forgive them when you have technically you know the basics a people capability here that you can solve the problem at least it's not like that normally program there and you have to approve them correct to scar logic with my hair off good energy canal if party up keep the now you know search party who logically given in critical thinking logically you cows may use cut right as an AV output on the heat cilia right you have to be learn that because when we ate it oh maybe I'll put an immediate thing for three months or six months the Jobi language and go chill with yoga platform on which a yoga they'll train you on that working learning capability thickness at the basics cleared on each even skinny right so interview you can look for essa personal Haley R Medusa Pucci on actually made once with a fever little meter program subcellular GSN a second thing you have very fun feeding at that time right we have it a Peggy if you are able to express her you know knowledge or not Kaplan book can make our path a path you may be some students are very good so push her tempo but at the time of interview oh no they get you nervous or gopinatha birthing some students are average students through people's in sixty percent marks criteria I guess 60 to 65 a few tiny 8090 valleys but fiscal path my communication skills with one chain right yeah that is very important point a via communication skills to both zero do you mean will be second gear may move who's very focused and I salsa right because when you will be in third your final year so scary time come Bettina time their placement which other camping that first year second year we have open communication skills figure I'll hand them out right as far as I normally according the telling me right maybe she also put yoga to watch along exactly they surpass any ISM anymore they already say but I saw a gif is this your house yeah it's my house interview preparation K videos by now okay means into the preparation tips how to prepare for interview write all the questions you me too you know kiss type a push input is our thing I don't care except it it's the which type of videos you want you can tell me how to think logically programming please please Amy push not be how think method a pop quiz so Tina cases it has a time problems they put it in Java TK was curry excess oil Yaya Han whenever we develop an operator pkcs was watching our house Prabhupada me to Schoology Kalinin and she's eaten each other problems of the cookie flagellum cancel the problem the idea but that's a little jealous type of problem head tourism logic a status illogical still barn you know you can modify it yourself right because I know I have when once I have published a research paper town graham Roubini algorithm so many being a yachtie the neighbor that I give made in the programming proper oozma Kappa me Anita pop down on that it took me around three to four days but before that you know concentrate 30 watt so chivos keeper and he much it cannot be so I see algorithm for your program Oh be modified person you were right or was made a roundrobin car Joe result I had Oh many you know here he'll worry the month program just a better car rather than the conventional Robin algorithm now see right so both SSO functional data disk over here are the problems they prove it is not resolution gave hope you can gotta try the row will be Iowa with SS which man was to negative Matawai Bacardi Marcus Lee Elia over so challenge on sfotch Lincoln is this your house yes actually it's my house he compared to getting is slow yeah I seriously have no idea about that exam but exam but hey slow examined gate exam I have idea that are top because I have tried both I have rightfully so as well but I was not preparing so much I say may the initial anything manly want question him each C++ okay hey love from neighborhood neighborhood where means maybe the Ricky sign because they okay yes I think design how hi ma'am hi Jenny convo thanks I feel like no matter looks no me are doing massive day shift Cappadonna proper anything you pee I think next should be Python Karthik I think but if you have interest in Java then you can go for that gate exam daily puts tips but I do get exam be high arts and even I have to admit exam so please don't start any new subject which may happen akivasha Schmucker or be other after i that we see annual exam me 20 me we are new you are i have just to revise main main points grab my coaching we have to definitely money which shop breaks a push movie but i am / you are a wise through previous l questions because are thus all perceptive it's better for you right gessie this is an equation so I'll continue step your question so just try that thing and yeah it's important yeah Pinellas they owe nothing let me know obviously you got away but mainly some of them yes over here to any I shall buy the a token Camila to hand evil right so just full confidence is not channel yet examine all the best which language definitely will start from a simple language that is I guess C language right C c plus plus 1 over 4 CC this place after off or maybe Java Python or many languages are there so now I guess see I was thinking that I will be loyal following he came to this but it's already 32 minutes so now I should go now school they can have it yahoo via windy at UK yeah just rally at it will be do they've managed okay so now okay my good night I'll see you now in the next slide screen on next Sunday right and thank you so much again thank you thank you thank you for your love and support right doing
