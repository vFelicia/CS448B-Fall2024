00:00 - hey everyone I hope you are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:03 - Python programming language in the
00:04 - previous video we have seen one project
00:06 - that is we have created a game that was
00:08 - guess the number game right and that was
00:11 - our seventh project in the series that
00:13 - and that was a course for a beginner
00:15 - level right now in this video we will be
00:18 - talking about something about debugging
00:21 - and what are some tips which would be
00:23 - really helpful for you guys to debug
00:26 - your code
00:27 - so now what is debugging just removing
00:30 - errors from your code or you can say
00:32 - removing bugs from your code is known as
00:34 - debugging right you have to find them
00:37 - and you have to remove them that process
00:39 - is known as debugging so I'm sure you
00:42 - have done this process
00:44 - very much because till now you have
00:46 - written many you know programs and so
00:50 - much food
00:51 - but still we'll be discussing some tips
00:53 - just to help you in your debugging
00:56 - process right okay now let's see I I'll
01:00 - do this thing with the help of some
01:02 - exercises
01:03 - so I have a file that is debugging
01:05 - underscore tips Dot py and I'm having a
01:07 - code a little bit code and in that what
01:11 - you have to find out what is the bug so
01:14 - what are some tips that would be really
01:16 - helpful so first first code is this one
01:19 - right so first thing is understand the
01:23 - problem
01:24 - what this code is going to do so we are
01:27 - having a functional display and this for
01:29 - Loop is
01:30 - the range is from 1 to 10 and if I is
01:34 - equal to 10 then it will print by
01:38 - now let's run this and see
01:40 - it is not printing anything
01:44 - right but when we want that when I is 10
01:47 - then it should print by so that is the
01:49 - problem right
01:51 - so now you have understood the problem
01:52 - that I must reach to 10 and then it will
01:56 - print by and then end of the program
01:59 - so now why it is not printing by C
02:03 - just you can check out this I value this
02:05 - I I is getting its value from this range
02:09 - function right so range is 1 to 10 and
02:12 - we know if you know the
02:14 - this is you can say the
02:16 - working of this range function then you
02:20 - can see its description like
02:23 - it starts by default at a zero and stop
02:25 - is omitted means range 4 is what it will
02:28 - produce 0 1 2 3 this 4 would be omitted
02:32 - so now the range is 1 to 10 means it
02:34 - will print 0 to 9 this 10 would be
02:38 - omitted so never this I would get the
02:42 - value 10.
02:44 - that is why it is not printing anything
02:46 - but if you want to print this by then
02:48 - what you need to do you need to do one
02:51 - to eleven now at this point of time it
02:54 - will print bye
02:56 - right so first
02:58 - just understand what is the problem
03:00 - right and then try to debug that thing
03:04 - another example is this exercise list
03:07 - it's comment out of this thing and let's
03:09 - uncomment the
03:11 - second exercise
03:13 - now here what we want to do we have a
03:14 - dice if you want to if you are you know
03:17 - play Ludo then you know what is a dice
03:19 - and there we are having the numbers one
03:21 - to six so here I am having a list
03:25 - where one two three four five six these
03:29 - text or strings are there in those and
03:32 - whenever you like throw the dice then
03:34 - any random number would be generated
03:35 - between one to six so that's exactly I'm
03:37 - going to do random root Rand int and
03:40 - there I am giving the range one to six
03:42 - any number from one to six would be
03:43 - generated and
03:45 - according to that number I'll print
03:46 - either one two three four five or six
03:49 - right now let's run this
03:51 - see it is printing two let's run this
03:54 - again
03:55 - to
03:57 - right but if I am running this again
04:00 - then it is giving me an error
04:02 - this list index out of range
04:05 - right so
04:08 - maybe you will run one or two time and
04:10 - then you know you will see that it is
04:12 - working fine and that's it but no
04:16 - it is having some bug because when I
04:18 - have gone this fourth time then it is
04:20 - giving me least out of index
04:22 - error right so that is what we can say
04:26 - why it is giving this error and when we
04:30 - don't know when it will give this error
04:32 - so
04:33 - according to this random number
04:35 - generated between one to six it should
04:38 - print this thing right so rather than
04:41 - this if I want to check where is the
04:43 - error
04:44 - the dice number obviously would be
04:46 - between one to six so I first time
04:48 - assign one here and run this
04:52 - so see it is printing two means no error
04:55 - is there if I am assigning two it is
04:57 - printing through here means no error so
05:00 - like this one two three four five and if
05:02 - I assign 6 here and then run this then
05:06 - list out of index again run
05:09 - list out of index
05:12 - list index of range right
05:15 - so I know the problem is when the rent
05:18 - it will generate a random number six
05:20 - then it will give error
05:22 - and why because in the list we know the
05:27 - index would be from 0 to 5 0 1 2 3 4 5
05:31 - right and you are generating F the shear
05:35 - or random number between one to six so
05:38 - if you know the working of this random
05:40 - function then it will generate between
05:42 - one to six but both are inclusive so
05:44 - when it will generate six then
05:46 - definitely there is no 6 index and it
05:48 - will give error right
05:50 - so what is the solution here we can do
05:52 - one thing from 0 to 5.
05:57 - it will generate number zero one two
05:59 - three four five six numbers and
06:01 - according to that it will print this
06:03 - thing so let's run this
06:05 - C
06:06 - you can run this again and again and now
06:08 - at this point of time it will not give
06:10 - any error
06:11 - right so this is how you can
06:14 - check where is the error right
06:19 - so let's comment out this and this is
06:22 - our third exercise
06:25 - let's uncomment this and see
06:28 - so here I just I'm just asking what is
06:33 - the what is your birth here and if your
06:37 - birth here is greater than
06:39 - if you are between 1980 to 1996 means
06:43 - you are a millennial
06:46 - and if you are
06:48 - greater than 96 then you are a gen Z
06:52 - right okay now let's run this and see
06:56 - if I am entering 1996
07:01 - it is not printing anything
07:04 - so there is no error but there is a bug
07:06 - you have to find out
07:09 - right
07:10 - so what you can do
07:12 - there is no red line here means no error
07:15 - it is giving so what you can do you can
07:17 - just act as a computer
07:18 - so if I'm entering 1996 so this year is
07:23 - now
07:25 - manually run this means manually try to
07:28 - run this dry run this 996. put this here
07:31 - here
07:32 - is this condition to you greater than 80
07:36 - 1980 yes condition true so this is what
07:39 - true
07:40 - right
07:45 - and here less than 1986 here is 1986 it
07:52 - is not less than we can say less than
07:53 - equal to
07:55 - or equal to equal to but not less than
07:57 - so this condition is not true
07:59 - so we are having true and false but
08:02 - definitely if you are having an and then
08:04 - it will ultimately
08:06 - give you folds means we will not enter
08:09 - in this blue now take this condition LC
08:13 - in this if below here is 96 it is
08:16 - greater than 96 no it is greater than
08:18 - equal to 96 or equal to equal to 96 but
08:20 - not definitely greater than 96 so this
08:22 - condition is also false right
08:26 - now you will not enter here
08:28 - that is why it is not printing anything
08:31 - but at least one condition should be
08:33 - true
08:34 - so what you need to do you can do like
08:37 - if here is less than equal to 96 here or
08:40 - maybe greater than equal to 96 here
08:43 - now at this point of time let's run this
08:47 - if I enter 996
08:49 - then you are a millennial
08:53 - so you can act as a computer means you
08:56 - are a computer
08:57 - and you are executing the statements one
09:00 - by one dry run the code
09:02 - that is a third tip right
09:08 - and this kind of thing work definitely
09:10 - when you are dealing with these
09:12 - condition type thing right okay the next
09:15 - is I am having
09:18 - this
09:19 - this group
09:21 - okay we are asking the age how old are
09:23 - you and if the age is greater than equal
09:25 - to 18 then you can vote at
09:28 - what are the is you enter right now
09:32 - see here in your code you may be having
09:36 - some red line see there is a red line
09:39 - right
09:40 - so when you go to when you move your
09:43 - cursor to this line then it will show
09:45 - indent expected
09:47 - right so after if there must be some
09:51 - indentation
09:52 - okay now there is no red line maybe you
09:55 - think the code is right okay let's run
09:57 - this how old are you I am like maybe I
10:00 - say I am 23.
10:03 - still it is giving error see it is it is
10:06 - a type error in line number 22.
10:09 - this symbol is not supported between
10:11 - instance of string and Str and end in
10:15 - line number 22.
10:18 - in line number 22 here
10:21 - this symbol is not supported between Str
10:24 - and int
10:26 - means
10:28 - error means definitely you should check
10:30 - the data type
10:32 - means there is a
10:35 - mismatch between the data types you can
10:37 - say so let's try to print this type of
10:41 - the stage this variable let's run this
10:43 - because we have something wrong in type
10:46 - data type because we are getting a type
10:48 - error
10:50 - see the class type is string Str
10:55 - and
10:56 - str23 is Str and we are comparing this
10:58 - with 18 that is integer so that's the
11:01 - problem is that's where we got the
11:03 - problem so just type cast this into int
11:08 - now you found one more bug here okay
11:10 - that's right now let's run this 23.
11:14 - now is it this is Class end but yeah it
11:18 - is running it is not giving any error
11:20 - like you can vote at
11:22 - but what I want that it should print
11:24 - here what age I have entered
11:27 - so it is not giving me this output that
11:30 - I want so there is something
11:33 - now you are not getting any error here
11:35 - so that you can have some hint what is
11:38 - the error right you are not getting any
11:40 - red line here now
11:44 - here comes your experience how much code
11:48 - you have done till now
11:50 - so with the experience you will get
11:52 - number of bugs errors and the solution
11:54 - as well now if you have the idea then
11:57 - you cannot print something like this for
11:59 - that you have to use F string right now
12:02 - it's fine let's run this
12:04 - how old are you 23.
12:06 - you can vote at 23.
12:09 - fine
12:10 - you can just comment out this line right
12:13 - okay the next next is let's comment out
12:16 - this code and let's uncomment this code
12:21 - okay so next is this thing I'm
12:24 - taking two variably and be assigning
12:26 - first zero then user will enter value of
12:29 - a value of p and multiplication a into B
12:31 - and then just printing the
12:32 - multiplication
12:33 - so there is no red line here right so
12:36 - maybe you think it's right let's run
12:38 - this
12:40 - okay you will want you are not getting
12:42 - any error so 3 enter B6
12:45 - but the output is zero
12:48 - it should print 6 into 3 like 18.
12:52 - now obviously there is a bug
12:55 - so you have to find it out where is the
12:57 - bug
12:58 - so what you can do you can use more
13:00 - print statement like after entering A
13:03 - and B maybe you think after entering a
13:06 - maybe I just want to print like what the
13:11 - value of a a is
13:13 - and after entering B same thing
13:23 - what the value of B and then
13:25 - multiplication A and B and then print
13:27 - multiplication let's run this
13:29 - enter a 4 B5
13:32 - and 0. so now you got the problem see
13:35 - a is 4 okay Enter B5 but B is 0 B is not
13:40 - taking the value
13:42 - right
13:43 - now you got where is the problem
13:45 - here
13:47 - in this B in this line maybe because
13:50 - whatever you enter B is not taking any
13:52 - value it is still 0. so you just check
13:55 - out this line
13:56 - we got now because of using the print
13:58 - statement where the problem is in this
14:00 - line only right
14:02 - now check this line again and see you
14:05 - are using double equal to here so it
14:07 - should be one single equal to right now
14:10 - let's run this
14:13 - enter a 4 6 and 24.
14:18 - now this time it's fine
14:21 - right
14:22 - so you can use multiple print statement
14:25 - as well to debug your code
14:27 - right or you can just take a break
14:30 - if you are exhausted take a break
14:33 - maybe you can do whatever you want to do
14:35 - your favorite thing then come to the
14:37 - code again or you can ask
14:39 - to a friend right or you can ask on
14:42 - stack Overflow or if you like if my code
14:45 - is running successfully but I have
14:46 - modified something in my code
14:48 - so run that code at that time only so
14:52 - run frequently
14:53 - after modification one modification run
14:56 - that code right if you think that just
14:58 - do this thing also this this and you
15:00 - have done 10 modification in your code
15:02 - and now you are running that code so
15:03 - maybe you are getting multiple error at
15:05 - the same time so it would be not easy
15:07 - for you to debug the code
15:09 - so just after changing a little bit run
15:12 - that so run frequently note that after
15:15 - writing the complete code complete
15:17 - program then only I'll run no now some
15:20 - exercises for you guys is
15:23 - so there is a program
15:25 - to find out like the number is even a
15:27 - rule so I just entered the number if
15:29 - number mode 2 equal to 0 then this is
15:31 - even number otherwise odd number so now
15:34 - you have to find out where the error is
15:36 - you can use the tips whatever we have
15:38 - discussed in the in this video and you
15:41 - can just tell me in comment section
15:42 - one more is
15:44 - so next is this one
15:46 - fizzbuzz job interview question that we
15:48 - have discussed if a number is divisible
15:51 - by 3 then it will print like phase if a
15:54 - number is divisible by 5 then it will
15:56 - print buzz and if number is divisible by
15:58 - both 3 and 5 then it will print Fizz was
16:01 - otherwise it will print just number
16:04 - right so that is we have done the
16:07 - exercise so you can go to that thing
16:09 - what is Facebook's job interview
16:10 - question then come to this
16:12 - now where is the error here if I run
16:15 - this see now what you are getting
16:18 - I am getting 1 2
16:20 - then 3 is divisible by obviously three
16:22 - then it should print Fizz but it is
16:24 - printing fizzbuzz and then number also
16:27 - three
16:28 - then four
16:30 - then at the place of five it should
16:32 - print buzz but it is printing Fizz buzz
16:34 - buzz fizzbuzz again and fizz so there is
16:38 - something wrong wrong we are not getting
16:40 - what we want right so what is the error
16:43 - here but there are more than one bug in
16:45 - this code
16:46 - so it's okay take your time and
16:49 - try to find out the bugs here and if you
16:52 - are not getting then you can check out
16:54 - the previous video in that case we have
16:56 - discussed this thing the physical job
16:58 - interview question right in the series
17:00 - only we have discussed this thing but
17:02 - I'll put the link of that video in the
17:03 - side button you can check out right I
17:05 - hope now this video would be helpful for
17:07 - you guys just to find out the error and
17:11 - just removing those error from your code
17:12 - right so now that's it for this video in
17:15 - the next video we'll see even more
17:16 - projects now it's in the next video take
17:19 - care

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen one project that is we have created a game that was guess the number game right and that was our seventh project in the series that and that was a course for a beginner level right now in this video we will be talking about something about debugging and what are some tips which would be really helpful for you guys to debug your code so now what is debugging just removing errors from your code or you can say removing bugs from your code is known as debugging right you have to find them and you have to remove them that process is known as debugging so I'm sure you have done this process very much because till now you have written many you know programs and so much food but still we'll be discussing some tips just to help you in your debugging process right okay now let's see I I'll do this thing with the help of some exercises so I have a file that is debugging underscore tips Dot py and I'm having a code a little bit code and in that what you have to find out what is the bug so what are some tips that would be really helpful so first first code is this one right so first thing is understand the problem what this code is going to do so we are having a functional display and this for Loop is the range is from 1 to 10 and if I is equal to 10 then it will print by now let's run this and see it is not printing anything right but when we want that when I is 10 then it should print by so that is the problem right so now you have understood the problem that I must reach to 10 and then it will print by and then end of the program so now why it is not printing by C just you can check out this I value this I I is getting its value from this range function right so range is 1 to 10 and we know if you know the this is you can say the working of this range function then you can see its description like it starts by default at a zero and stop is omitted means range 4 is what it will produce 0 1 2 3 this 4 would be omitted so now the range is 1 to 10 means it will print 0 to 9 this 10 would be omitted so never this I would get the value 10. that is why it is not printing anything but if you want to print this by then what you need to do you need to do one to eleven now at this point of time it will print bye right so first just understand what is the problem right and then try to debug that thing another example is this exercise list it's comment out of this thing and let's uncomment the second exercise now here what we want to do we have a dice if you want to if you are you know play Ludo then you know what is a dice and there we are having the numbers one to six so here I am having a list where one two three four five six these text or strings are there in those and whenever you like throw the dice then any random number would be generated between one to six so that's exactly I'm going to do random root Rand int and there I am giving the range one to six any number from one to six would be generated and according to that number I'll print either one two three four five or six right now let's run this see it is printing two let's run this again to right but if I am running this again then it is giving me an error this list index out of range right so maybe you will run one or two time and then you know you will see that it is working fine and that's it but no it is having some bug because when I have gone this fourth time then it is giving me least out of index error right so that is what we can say why it is giving this error and when we don't know when it will give this error so according to this random number generated between one to six it should print this thing right so rather than this if I want to check where is the error the dice number obviously would be between one to six so I first time assign one here and run this so see it is printing two means no error is there if I am assigning two it is printing through here means no error so like this one two three four five and if I assign 6 here and then run this then list out of index again run list out of index list index of range right so I know the problem is when the rent it will generate a random number six then it will give error and why because in the list we know the index would be from 0 to 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 right and you are generating F the shear or random number between one to six so if you know the working of this random function then it will generate between one to six but both are inclusive so when it will generate six then definitely there is no 6 index and it will give error right so what is the solution here we can do one thing from 0 to 5. it will generate number zero one two three four five six numbers and according to that it will print this thing so let's run this C you can run this again and again and now at this point of time it will not give any error right so this is how you can check where is the error right so let's comment out this and this is our third exercise let's uncomment this and see so here I just I'm just asking what is the what is your birth here and if your birth here is greater than if you are between 1980 to 1996 means you are a millennial and if you are greater than 96 then you are a gen Z right okay now let's run this and see if I am entering 1996 it is not printing anything so there is no error but there is a bug you have to find out right so what you can do there is no red line here means no error it is giving so what you can do you can just act as a computer so if I'm entering 1996 so this year is now manually run this means manually try to run this dry run this 996. put this here here is this condition to you greater than 80 1980 yes condition true so this is what true right and here less than 1986 here is 1986 it is not less than we can say less than equal to or equal to equal to but not less than so this condition is not true so we are having true and false but definitely if you are having an and then it will ultimately give you folds means we will not enter in this blue now take this condition LC in this if below here is 96 it is greater than 96 no it is greater than equal to 96 or equal to equal to 96 but not definitely greater than 96 so this condition is also false right now you will not enter here that is why it is not printing anything but at least one condition should be true so what you need to do you can do like if here is less than equal to 96 here or maybe greater than equal to 96 here now at this point of time let's run this if I enter 996 then you are a millennial so you can act as a computer means you are a computer and you are executing the statements one by one dry run the code that is a third tip right and this kind of thing work definitely when you are dealing with these condition type thing right okay the next is I am having this this group okay we are asking the age how old are you and if the age is greater than equal to 18 then you can vote at what are the is you enter right now see here in your code you may be having some red line see there is a red line right so when you go to when you move your cursor to this line then it will show indent expected right so after if there must be some indentation okay now there is no red line maybe you think the code is right okay let's run this how old are you I am like maybe I say I am 23. still it is giving error see it is it is a type error in line number 22. this symbol is not supported between instance of string and Str and end in line number 22. in line number 22 here this symbol is not supported between Str and int means error means definitely you should check the data type means there is a mismatch between the data types you can say so let's try to print this type of the stage this variable let's run this because we have something wrong in type data type because we are getting a type error see the class type is string Str and str23 is Str and we are comparing this with 18 that is integer so that's the problem is that's where we got the problem so just type cast this into int now you found one more bug here okay that's right now let's run this 23. now is it this is Class end but yeah it is running it is not giving any error like you can vote at but what I want that it should print here what age I have entered so it is not giving me this output that I want so there is something now you are not getting any error here so that you can have some hint what is the error right you are not getting any red line here now here comes your experience how much code you have done till now so with the experience you will get number of bugs errors and the solution as well now if you have the idea then you cannot print something like this for that you have to use F string right now it's fine let's run this how old are you 23. you can vote at 23. fine you can just comment out this line right okay the next next is let's comment out this code and let's uncomment this code okay so next is this thing I'm taking two variably and be assigning first zero then user will enter value of a value of p and multiplication a into B and then just printing the multiplication so there is no red line here right so maybe you think it's right let's run this okay you will want you are not getting any error so 3 enter B6 but the output is zero it should print 6 into 3 like 18. now obviously there is a bug so you have to find it out where is the bug so what you can do you can use more print statement like after entering A and B maybe you think after entering a maybe I just want to print like what the value of a a is and after entering B same thing what the value of B and then multiplication A and B and then print multiplication let's run this enter a 4 B5 and 0. so now you got the problem see a is 4 okay Enter B5 but B is 0 B is not taking the value right now you got where is the problem here in this B in this line maybe because whatever you enter B is not taking any value it is still 0. so you just check out this line we got now because of using the print statement where the problem is in this line only right now check this line again and see you are using double equal to here so it should be one single equal to right now let's run this enter a 4 6 and 24. now this time it's fine right so you can use multiple print statement as well to debug your code right or you can just take a break if you are exhausted take a break maybe you can do whatever you want to do your favorite thing then come to the code again or you can ask to a friend right or you can ask on stack Overflow or if you like if my code is running successfully but I have modified something in my code so run that code at that time only so run frequently after modification one modification run that code right if you think that just do this thing also this this and you have done 10 modification in your code and now you are running that code so maybe you are getting multiple error at the same time so it would be not easy for you to debug the code so just after changing a little bit run that so run frequently note that after writing the complete code complete program then only I'll run no now some exercises for you guys is so there is a program to find out like the number is even a rule so I just entered the number if number mode 2 equal to 0 then this is even number otherwise odd number so now you have to find out where the error is you can use the tips whatever we have discussed in the in this video and you can just tell me in comment section one more is so next is this one fizzbuzz job interview question that we have discussed if a number is divisible by 3 then it will print like phase if a number is divisible by 5 then it will print buzz and if number is divisible by both 3 and 5 then it will print Fizz was otherwise it will print just number right so that is we have done the exercise so you can go to that thing what is Facebook's job interview question then come to this now where is the error here if I run this see now what you are getting I am getting 1 2 then 3 is divisible by obviously three then it should print Fizz but it is printing fizzbuzz and then number also three then four then at the place of five it should print buzz but it is printing Fizz buzz buzz fizzbuzz again and fizz so there is something wrong wrong we are not getting what we want right so what is the error here but there are more than one bug in this code so it's okay take your time and try to find out the bugs here and if you are not getting then you can check out the previous video in that case we have discussed this thing the physical job interview question right in the series only we have discussed this thing but I'll put the link of that video in the side button you can check out right I hope now this video would be helpful for you guys just to find out the error and just removing those error from your code right so now that's it for this video in the next video we'll see even more projects now it's in the next video take care
