00:00 - so we are done with the types of storage
00:01 - classes in C now I have got some
00:03 - questions from students based on stories
00:05 - classes like some Theory questions also
00:07 - there and some code is given and you are
00:09 - supposed to find out output of that uh
00:11 - code in C programming right so those
00:13 - three questions we are going to discuss
00:15 - in this video right we'll explain I'm
00:17 - going to explain the solution also like
00:19 - step by step why you are getting that
00:21 - kind of output if any error is there in
00:23 - that program why that error is there
00:25 - right everything about those questions
00:27 - we are going to discuss in this video
00:29 - now let's see first question is this one
00:31 - here I haven't used any I haven't used
00:34 - any storage class so we have a global
00:36 - variable this is a global variable right
00:39 - and in main I'm just printing this value
00:41 - of a in return zero now I have told you
00:43 - by default if you have written this
00:46 - things and by default the storage class
00:47 - would be considered as
00:50 - oo right but second point I have also
00:53 - told you like we cannot write something
00:56 - like this Auto in a the global
00:58 - declaration Auto is Auto we can use this
01:01 - uh storage class this keyword we can use
01:03 - only with local variables no Global
01:05 - declaration is allowed only local
01:06 - declaration is allowed right so now what
01:10 - first of all what should be the value
01:12 - and and second question is under which
01:14 - storage class this Global variable comes
01:18 - right so now the first of all the answer
01:20 - of this question would be zero output of
01:22 - this uh code would be Zero by default
01:25 - Global variables have to be assigned
01:27 - with the zero value right and second
01:30 - answer of second question is the global
01:32 - variable comes under which
01:34 - category extern storage class and we
01:37 - were discussing extern storage class at
01:39 - that time I have told you the default
01:41 - value for extern storage class this know
01:44 - variable would be zero so that Global
01:46 - variable also having value zero so these
01:49 - are not coming under oo right these are
01:52 - coming under xter so I hope now you got
01:55 - the answer of these two questions right
01:58 - now next question is
02:00 - okay this is the second
02:02 - question here we are using static
02:05 - storage class right so first of all the
02:08 - program the control will go to main
02:10 - function whenever you will run that code
02:13 - then here we have four Loop now first of
02:16 - all first statement is initialization
02:18 - then condition check then the updation
02:20 - increment or decrement right but in and
02:23 - here all the three places we have are
02:25 - calling Fun function it's okay that is
02:27 - correct no problem what whatever is
02:30 - written just follow those steps right
02:33 - now first is initialization first
02:35 - control will go here now here we are
02:37 - calling Fun function so control will go
02:40 - here this is definition of fun now here
02:44 - we have a variable static in Num Num
02:48 - value is 16 now it is static this
02:51 - keyword this is very important you have
02:53 - to keep in mind the property of this
02:56 - static keyword right it will retain its
02:58 - previous value right scope is local but
03:02 - lifetime of this variable is till the
03:04 - end of the program fine now return num
03:07 - minus minus now first of all it is post
03:10 - decrement so it will return the previous
03:12 - value first and then it is going to
03:14 - decrement it is post not pre so it will
03:17 - return 16 first return num 16 would be
03:20 - returned Here and Now 16 becomes
03:24 - 15 right minus
03:27 - minus next is condition would be checked
03:29 - but but at the place of condition also
03:31 - we are calling the function so again
03:32 - control will go
03:34 - here now this statement static in Num is
03:37 - equal to 16 again it would would be
03:39 - initialized no right because this is
03:43 - static here we are using static so this
03:44 - would be ignored it will rain its
03:46 - previous value that is 15
03:48 - only this is the tricky part in this
03:50 - question that's it nothing else now 15
03:53 - only no not again not be initialized
03:55 - with 16 so it is now 15 now return num
03:59 - so 15 would be returned Here and Now
04:01 - become now minus minus so it becomes now
04:04 - 14 after returning the original value
04:07 - now the condition is 15 it means it's
04:10 - not zero means it's
04:12 - true 0 is only false other than zero
04:15 - it's true so if it is true we are going
04:17 - to enter into this for Loop now here we
04:19 - have one condition print F again we are
04:21 - calling function it's okay again control
04:23 - will go here this would not be
04:25 - initialized again so it will return the
04:27 - previous value that is 14 first here 14
04:29 - 14 would be returned and now value
04:31 - becomes 13 so first of all output would
04:34 - be 14 would be printed right now next
04:37 - step is we'll go to this part update
04:40 - part but here also no increment
04:42 - decrement we are calling the function
04:43 - again so it's okay again we are will
04:45 - call the function now again the previous
04:48 - value is 13 so it will return first of
04:50 - all 13 here and then value becomes 12
04:54 - minus- right now after update we will
04:58 - again check the condition
05:01 - right now for checking the condition we
05:04 - the control will come here so function
05:07 - calling it's okay again we'll call this
05:09 - function now it will return here the
05:11 - previous value of num that is 12 and now
05:14 - it becomes 11 minus- so 12 is what also
05:17 - not zero it's true so we are going to
05:20 - enter into this loop again we will call
05:23 - the function fun right and now this time
05:26 - 11 would be returned 11 so 11 would be
05:29 - printed and value becomes 10
05:32 - minus- after returning the previous
05:34 - value now minus minus means it would be
05:37 - one
05:38 - decremented now after printing here 11
05:42 - now value becomes 10 so now the part is
05:46 - this part so here we are again calling
05:48 - the function so now 10 value would be
05:50 - returned and now value becomes
05:52 - n now after this we will check the
05:55 - condition again but for checking the
05:57 - condition again we will call the
05:58 - function now here 9 would be returned
06:01 - and value becomes now 8 so condition 9
06:04 - is true not zero okay we'll enter into
06:07 - this loop again we will call the
06:08 - function now eight would be return so
06:10 - eight would be printed and now value
06:11 - becomes
06:13 - seven right now after this here again
06:17 - we'll call the function from here right
06:19 - and this time 7 would be returned and
06:21 - value becomes six now we'll check the
06:24 - condition here again we'll call the
06:27 - function so six would be returned and
06:30 - value becomes five six is not zero so
06:33 - it's true again we'll enter into this
06:35 - for Loop and fun we'll call the fun
06:37 - function again so now this time five
06:39 - would be returned so five would be
06:40 - printed and value becomes four minus
06:44 - minus right now here increment decrement
06:48 - part update part so here again we are we
06:50 - will call the function now four would be
06:53 - returned and value becomes three now
06:56 - we'll check the condition so we'll call
06:58 - the function again
07:00 - now three would be returned here and
07:02 - value becomes two right now three is
07:05 - true yes we will enter into this Loop
07:07 - now at this
07:09 - time two would be returned we are
07:11 - calling the function again so two would
07:13 - be returned and this becomes one now
07:17 - again this part so again we'll call the
07:19 - function so here now one would be
07:20 - returned and value becomes zero now
07:22 - we'll check the condition again now
07:24 - again we will call the function and now
07:26 - this time zero would be returned and
07:28 - this becomes minus one so
07:30 - this is what condition so if this is
07:32 - true only this is true then only we will
07:35 - enter into this Loop zero means false so
07:37 - now we are not going to enter into this
07:39 - Loop so now return zero exit from the
07:41 - loop so what output you will get this
07:43 - one 14 11 852 I hope you got this
07:46 - working of this one
07:49 - right these type of questions generally
07:51 - you get in competitive exam in Gate or
07:54 - net right those are having this static
07:57 - keyword so you have to you know remember
08:00 - the property of the static keyword right
08:03 - so we are having two more question but
08:05 - that those question we will discuss in
08:06 - next video if you have any question like
08:08 - you think this is complicated one I'm
08:10 - not getting the answer of this question
08:12 - or answer you are getting but you are
08:13 - not getting the reason of getting that
08:15 - type of answer or error based on storage
08:18 - class or based on anything any topic on
08:20 - C language then you can tell me in
08:22 - comment box you can just send me that
08:24 - you know question or you can send me
08:25 - that question screenshot of screenshot
08:27 - of that question on my Instagram account
08:29 - you can message me I'm I'll try to
08:31 - upload a video on that question also
08:34 - right now I'll see you in the next video
08:36 - till then bye-bye take care wait if you
08:39 - think that any topic is left in C
08:41 - programming then you then also you can
08:42 - tell me in comment box I'll try to
08:44 - upload video on that topic also but from
08:47 - my side I guess I have completed C
08:49 - programming so now I'll see you in the
08:51 - next video till then bye-bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

so we are done with the types of storage classes in C now I have got some questions from students based on stories classes like some Theory questions also there and some code is given and you are supposed to find out output of that uh code in C programming right so those three questions we are going to discuss in this video right we'll explain I'm going to explain the solution also like step by step why you are getting that kind of output if any error is there in that program why that error is there right everything about those questions we are going to discuss in this video now let's see first question is this one here I haven't used any I haven't used any storage class so we have a global variable this is a global variable right and in main I'm just printing this value of a in return zero now I have told you by default if you have written this things and by default the storage class would be considered as oo right but second point I have also told you like we cannot write something like this Auto in a the global declaration Auto is Auto we can use this uh storage class this keyword we can use only with local variables no Global declaration is allowed only local declaration is allowed right so now what first of all what should be the value and and second question is under which storage class this Global variable comes right so now the first of all the answer of this question would be zero output of this uh code would be Zero by default Global variables have to be assigned with the zero value right and second answer of second question is the global variable comes under which category extern storage class and we were discussing extern storage class at that time I have told you the default value for extern storage class this know variable would be zero so that Global variable also having value zero so these are not coming under oo right these are coming under xter so I hope now you got the answer of these two questions right now next question is okay this is the second question here we are using static storage class right so first of all the program the control will go to main function whenever you will run that code then here we have four Loop now first of all first statement is initialization then condition check then the updation increment or decrement right but in and here all the three places we have are calling Fun function it's okay that is correct no problem what whatever is written just follow those steps right now first is initialization first control will go here now here we are calling Fun function so control will go here this is definition of fun now here we have a variable static in Num Num value is 16 now it is static this keyword this is very important you have to keep in mind the property of this static keyword right it will retain its previous value right scope is local but lifetime of this variable is till the end of the program fine now return num minus minus now first of all it is post decrement so it will return the previous value first and then it is going to decrement it is post not pre so it will return 16 first return num 16 would be returned Here and Now 16 becomes 15 right minus minus next is condition would be checked but but at the place of condition also we are calling the function so again control will go here now this statement static in Num is equal to 16 again it would would be initialized no right because this is static here we are using static so this would be ignored it will rain its previous value that is 15 only this is the tricky part in this question that's it nothing else now 15 only no not again not be initialized with 16 so it is now 15 now return num so 15 would be returned Here and Now become now minus minus so it becomes now 14 after returning the original value now the condition is 15 it means it's not zero means it's true 0 is only false other than zero it's true so if it is true we are going to enter into this for Loop now here we have one condition print F again we are calling function it's okay again control will go here this would not be initialized again so it will return the previous value that is 14 first here 14 14 would be returned and now value becomes 13 so first of all output would be 14 would be printed right now next step is we'll go to this part update part but here also no increment decrement we are calling the function again so it's okay again we are will call the function now again the previous value is 13 so it will return first of all 13 here and then value becomes 12 minus right now after update we will again check the condition right now for checking the condition we the control will come here so function calling it's okay again we'll call this function now it will return here the previous value of num that is 12 and now it becomes 11 minus so 12 is what also not zero it's true so we are going to enter into this loop again we will call the function fun right and now this time 11 would be returned 11 so 11 would be printed and value becomes 10 minus after returning the previous value now minus minus means it would be one decremented now after printing here 11 now value becomes 10 so now the part is this part so here we are again calling the function so now 10 value would be returned and now value becomes n now after this we will check the condition again but for checking the condition again we will call the function now here 9 would be returned and value becomes now 8 so condition 9 is true not zero okay we'll enter into this loop again we will call the function now eight would be return so eight would be printed and now value becomes seven right now after this here again we'll call the function from here right and this time 7 would be returned and value becomes six now we'll check the condition here again we'll call the function so six would be returned and value becomes five six is not zero so it's true again we'll enter into this for Loop and fun we'll call the fun function again so now this time five would be returned so five would be printed and value becomes four minus minus right now here increment decrement part update part so here again we are we will call the function now four would be returned and value becomes three now we'll check the condition so we'll call the function again now three would be returned here and value becomes two right now three is true yes we will enter into this Loop now at this time two would be returned we are calling the function again so two would be returned and this becomes one now again this part so again we'll call the function so here now one would be returned and value becomes zero now we'll check the condition again now again we will call the function and now this time zero would be returned and this becomes minus one so this is what condition so if this is true only this is true then only we will enter into this Loop zero means false so now we are not going to enter into this Loop so now return zero exit from the loop so what output you will get this one 14 11 852 I hope you got this working of this one right these type of questions generally you get in competitive exam in Gate or net right those are having this static keyword so you have to you know remember the property of the static keyword right so we are having two more question but that those question we will discuss in next video if you have any question like you think this is complicated one I'm not getting the answer of this question or answer you are getting but you are not getting the reason of getting that type of answer or error based on storage class or based on anything any topic on C language then you can tell me in comment box you can just send me that you know question or you can send me that question screenshot of screenshot of that question on my Instagram account you can message me I'm I'll try to upload a video on that question also right now I'll see you in the next video till then byebye take care wait if you think that any topic is left in C programming then you then also you can tell me in comment box I'll try to upload video on that topic also but from my side I guess I have completed C programming so now I'll see you in the next video till then byebye take care
