00:00 - so in the series of learning python
00:02 - programming language in previous video
00:04 - we have talked about history of python
00:06 - language
00:07 - now
00:08 - in this video we will install actually
00:11 - python as well as an ide for writing
00:14 - programs in python language and then we
00:16 - write a simple program just to print
00:18 - hello world that's we usually do
00:20 - whenever we you learn any programming
00:22 - language first program you write is
00:24 - print hello world so this these three
00:26 - things we'll do in this video right
00:28 - python is a interpreted language so that
00:31 - is you can say basically we will you
00:33 - know install the base interpreter for
00:35 - python
00:36 - right so now let's see how to
00:39 - install these things one by one step by
00:42 - step
00:43 - okay
00:45 - first we will search like
00:48 - just
00:50 - write down download python
00:52 - okay
00:54 - and
00:55 - better
00:56 - to open the website
00:59 - the website of this python dot or
01:01 - python.org
01:03 - right
01:04 - and here in the download section you
01:06 - will find download python 3.10.6
01:10 - the latest version is 3.10.6 so we are
01:12 - going to download this version for
01:13 - windows
01:15 - okay so just click on download and
01:18 - that's it
01:20 - it will take only few seconds and see
01:22 - it's been downloaded let's just click on
01:26 - this
01:27 - and now
01:28 - how to install this you can click on
01:30 - install now two options are there or
01:32 - customize installation in customize you
01:34 - can choose your location and some
01:35 - features
01:36 - right by default this would be your
01:38 - location if you click on install now
01:42 - okay it will include ideally pip
01:44 - documentation and all we'll see what is
01:46 - ideally what is pip basically to install
01:48 - python packages and all you'll see one
01:50 - by one these videos but for now just add
01:52 - this uh
01:54 - just check this also this textbook
01:57 - checkbox add python
01:59 - 3.10 to path means
02:01 - automatically it will be added to path
02:03 - and directly from cmd command prompt you
02:04 - can
02:05 - run the center better you can run the
02:07 - commands on python you don't need to add
02:09 - any path right so i'll do customized
02:11 - installation okay see in this what are
02:14 - the features documentation pip it will
02:16 - install you know pip which will download
02:19 - and install python packages
02:21 - later we will install some packages also
02:23 - in python so using pip we can do that
02:25 - thing
02:26 - okay
02:27 - now
02:28 - let's let's click on
02:30 - next and install for all users right
02:34 - and you just keep everything as it is
02:38 - this is the location install location c
02:40 - program files and python 3.10 okay and
02:43 - click on install that's it and then
02:46 - yes
02:48 - now it has been started and it will take
02:51 - few seconds to install this uh language
02:54 - to this this interpreter for this
02:56 - language here we are downloading the
02:58 - base interpreter for python
03:00 - right
03:01 - now after that we will install ide
03:04 - pycharm basically id is one integrated
03:06 - development environment
03:08 - which is basically an application or you
03:10 - can see it's a software to build
03:11 - applications it is having text editor
03:14 - also code editor
03:16 - okay with there you can write down code
03:18 - uh with having some syntax like syntax
03:20 - highlighting some extra features it is
03:22 - having syntax highlighting
03:23 - autocompletion if there is an there is
03:25 - any error then underline it will show
03:28 - red underline
03:29 - under that line in which
03:31 - you are having error same as we have
03:33 - installed and we have worked right now
03:35 - also we are currently working visual
03:37 - studio code uh when we were we run c
03:40 - plus plus program so for this that id is
03:42 - an id also having compiler debugger
03:45 - right many things in simple and in one
03:48 - software we are having many things so
03:49 - that is why we use id
03:51 - rather than writing our programs in
03:53 - notepad we generally prefer ids many ids
03:56 - are there so here we use pycharm so
03:59 - after this we will install pycharm okay
04:02 - now let's just uh click on this end
04:07 - download
04:08 - pi
04:09 - cha
04:11 - okay
04:13 - it is by jetbrains
04:17 - so you see the first website only
04:18 - jetbrains.com
04:20 - right
04:21 - it is by jetbrain so just
04:23 - click on that thing and you will find
04:25 - two version here
04:27 - professional as well as community but
04:29 - better to download community version
04:31 - because it would be paid it would be
04:33 - free for it it is professional is a free
04:35 - 30 days trial only
04:37 - so we will
04:38 - download community version okay
04:41 - it has been started
04:43 - now as you can see
04:45 - our setup is also going on and we have
04:49 - so now python 3.10.6 64-bit setup is
04:53 - successful we will close this
04:55 - see as you can see also there are
04:57 - various releases previous release 3.10
05:00 - 3.9 3.8 whatever version you want to
05:03 - download you can download
05:05 - right
05:06 - but better to download the latest
05:07 - version that would be fine
05:09 - so as you can see these are the versions
05:11 - you can download other than this version
05:13 - 3.9.6 you can download any other version
05:15 - also it's up to you
05:17 - right
05:18 - but better to download three point x
05:19 - version only know two point x because
05:21 - they have
05:22 - added the support for two point x
05:24 - version right now how to check that we
05:26 - have successfully downloaded this python
05:29 - so just
05:30 - you can just uh click on this you can uh
05:33 - open your command prompt cmd type cmd
05:36 - and this is your command prompt right
05:39 - now here i will
05:41 - write
05:42 - python
05:45 - version
05:46 - hyphen hyphen version so see it is
05:49 - showing me the version 3.10.6 yes it has
05:51 - successfully
05:53 - downloaded and installed sorry why not
05:55 - download it install this python this
05:57 - interpreter for us
05:59 - right
06:00 - so if you
06:02 - enter
06:03 - write python and enter then our this
06:06 - interpreter for us has been started here
06:09 - you can
06:10 - you can use this thing for calculate as
06:12 - a calculator or you can write down your
06:13 - commands here
06:15 - you can do programming also here line by
06:17 - line
06:18 - so see if i write 3 plus 2 it will show
06:21 - me 5
06:23 - so this can also be used as a calculator
06:25 - so line by line because interpreter
06:28 - would do what integrate line by line not
06:29 - the complete code so only one line you
06:32 - will write and it will show you the
06:33 - result of that line so simply we will
06:35 - exit
06:36 - from here simply type exit and
06:39 - press enter
06:40 - and one more thing we have also included
06:42 - we have also installed pip that was used
06:44 - to install some packages and all if you
06:46 - want to check that thing also you can
06:48 - just
06:49 - write down pip here and just
06:52 - enter so see it will show you something
06:55 - like this the result
06:57 - after
06:58 - uh clicking
06:59 - after writing pip and clicking just
07:01 - enter
07:02 - so this would be the case so means uh
07:04 - tip has also been installed successfully
07:06 - you don't need to do anything loud now
07:08 - they just close it
07:10 - now we will install our python the ide
07:12 - so let's click on this the community
07:15 - version that we have downloaded already
07:17 - and it will show
07:19 - this screen just click on yes
07:22 - and next
07:24 - and this is the destination folder for
07:27 - our
07:28 - this
07:29 - installation then click on next
07:31 - simply click on next or you can write
07:35 - down
07:36 - create if you want to create desktop
07:38 - shortcut you can just click on this
07:43 - open folder as project this also you can
07:45 - click if you want to add bin folder to
07:48 - the path
07:50 - update path variable
07:52 - so i don't want to include this thing
07:55 - you just click on next now
07:59 - right and simply click on install
08:02 - that's it it will take some time
08:05 - right
08:08 - so it's been done now you can just click
08:11 - on the run python community edition and
08:13 - just click on finish
08:15 - so now it will launch and
08:18 - just click on don't import settings and
08:22 - okay right
08:23 - now it will launch your python community
08:25 - edition 2022
08:27 - now what you need to do obviously the
08:29 - first time so we will create a new
08:31 - project so click on new project
08:34 - okay
08:35 - now see this type of thing would be
08:36 - there on your screen now what you have
08:38 - to do
08:40 - you can just this is your location see
08:42 - my location is this thing and python
08:44 - project so if you want to change the
08:46 - name of your project you can just
08:49 - i'm
08:51 - writing first
08:53 - project
08:54 - that's it now
08:56 - new environment it is showing that
08:58 - virtual environment but we don't need to
09:00 - this we don't need to do this thing
09:03 - we need to do what
09:05 - previously configured
09:07 - interpreter
09:09 - for this it was
09:11 - so now it is showing no interpreter you
09:13 - have to add interpreter because we have
09:15 - already installed python interpreter
09:17 - right so add add local interpreter and
09:22 - i have which interpreter it's python
09:25 - 3.xc location c user and base
09:28 - interpreter is program files python 3.10
09:31 - 3010 and python dot exe right this is my
09:34 - interpreter okay
09:37 - now
09:38 - just click on this so if you are you
09:40 - know if in your laptop it is not showing
09:43 - anything so you can just click on these
09:45 - three dots and you can search
09:48 - you can search in which folder you have
09:50 - installed in c folder in user or python
09:52 - in which folder you have installed that
09:54 - python previously we have installed that
09:56 - python you just go to that folder click
09:59 - go to that folder and click on python
10:00 - dot exe and then select it
10:02 - right
10:04 - in my uh pc i have already this thing
10:06 - python.exe so just click on ok
10:10 - so it is creating
10:11 - uh that environment
10:13 - so see the interpreter is python 3.x
10:16 - sorry 3.10 okay now see create a main
10:19 - dot py welcome script it will create a
10:22 - main dot py the extension for python uh
10:25 - program says dot p i just say for c we
10:27 - have dot c for c plus plus we have dot
10:29 - cpp so same for python we have a dot py
10:31 - so it will create
10:32 - a welcome script for s for us right if
10:34 - you check this if you uncheck this it
10:36 - will not create anything but i'm going
10:37 - to check this
10:38 - okay now let's just create so it is
10:41 - loading our first project c main dot p
10:44 - y so it is a sample python script
10:48 - okay
10:49 - you can say this
10:51 - if you want to check out this thing you
10:53 - can check out otherwise
10:55 - no it's okay you can
10:57 - what you can do
10:59 - you can just
11:00 - remove all these things and we can do
11:03 - our simple like we have now installed
11:06 - our ide so if you want to print hello
11:08 - world in python how you will print it's
11:11 - very simple no need to write down any
11:13 - header file main function and all
11:15 - one line you need to write down okay now
11:18 - if you want to write down that thing in
11:20 - main dot py you can do that thing or
11:22 - otherwise in first project
11:24 - you can
11:25 - you can create you can create a new file
11:28 - right click on first project new the
11:30 - name of our project is first project new
11:32 - and then
11:33 - file i'm creating new file that is
11:37 - first
11:38 - dot
11:39 - py
11:41 - here i'll write my code simply you need
11:44 - to write
11:45 - print
11:47 - and
11:51 - hello world
11:53 - that's it no semicolon nothing else
11:55 - nothing else so you can simply
11:58 - run this
11:59 - here we have a
12:01 - you know this kind of thing
12:03 - hi pycharm so it is
12:08 - okay it is actually running this main
12:10 - dot p y this file main dot p y right we
12:13 - no need to run this file we we need to
12:15 - write we need to run our first dot py
12:18 - this file so now let's uh close that
12:21 - file select this first dot py and sorry
12:25 - here here not main
12:27 - you have to select your current file
12:30 - okay
12:31 - note main here if there is this kind of
12:34 - thing you just select
12:35 - current file and run this
12:38 - now current file is first dot py so it
12:41 - is printing hello world on my screen
12:43 - simple program so i think
12:46 - with this only you can
12:48 - identify how much
12:50 - simpler
12:52 - is to code in this programming language
12:54 - python programming language then c and c
12:57 - plus plus and java and all
12:59 - to print a simple line hello world you
13:01 - just need to write down print and that
13:03 - thing
13:04 - because it is a string or the string you
13:06 - can write down in single quote also here
13:07 - no double quote but actually i am from
13:09 - that c and c plus background so
13:11 - i
13:12 - put string in double quotes and a single
13:14 - character in single code but in python
13:16 - you can write down rather than these
13:18 - double quotes single quotes as well
13:22 - uh
13:22 - single quotes
13:24 - okay let's run this current file and it
13:26 - will print hello world both are same
13:28 - single code or double quote it's up to
13:30 - you
13:31 - so i guess this is clear to you now from
13:33 - the next video we are going to start you
13:35 - know our actual python programming
13:37 - course we will learn about variables
13:39 - how to use those data types string and
13:42 - all
13:42 - you'll see these kind of things so now
13:44 - in the next video till then bye bye take
13:46 - care and if you are finding any
13:47 - difficulty in downloading and installing
13:49 - these kind of things you can let me know
13:50 - in comment section
13:52 - okay
13:53 - so let's see the next video now till
13:55 - then bye take

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning python programming language in previous video we have talked about history of python language now in this video we will install actually python as well as an ide for writing programs in python language and then we write a simple program just to print hello world that's we usually do whenever we you learn any programming language first program you write is print hello world so this these three things we'll do in this video right python is a interpreted language so that is you can say basically we will you know install the base interpreter for python right so now let's see how to install these things one by one step by step okay first we will search like just write down download python okay and better to open the website the website of this python dot or python.org right and here in the download section you will find download python 3.10.6 the latest version is 3.10.6 so we are going to download this version for windows okay so just click on download and that's it it will take only few seconds and see it's been downloaded let's just click on this and now how to install this you can click on install now two options are there or customize installation in customize you can choose your location and some features right by default this would be your location if you click on install now okay it will include ideally pip documentation and all we'll see what is ideally what is pip basically to install python packages and all you'll see one by one these videos but for now just add this uh just check this also this textbook checkbox add python 3.10 to path means automatically it will be added to path and directly from cmd command prompt you can run the center better you can run the commands on python you don't need to add any path right so i'll do customized installation okay see in this what are the features documentation pip it will install you know pip which will download and install python packages later we will install some packages also in python so using pip we can do that thing okay now let's let's click on next and install for all users right and you just keep everything as it is this is the location install location c program files and python 3.10 okay and click on install that's it and then yes now it has been started and it will take few seconds to install this uh language to this this interpreter for this language here we are downloading the base interpreter for python right now after that we will install ide pycharm basically id is one integrated development environment which is basically an application or you can see it's a software to build applications it is having text editor also code editor okay with there you can write down code uh with having some syntax like syntax highlighting some extra features it is having syntax highlighting autocompletion if there is an there is any error then underline it will show red underline under that line in which you are having error same as we have installed and we have worked right now also we are currently working visual studio code uh when we were we run c plus plus program so for this that id is an id also having compiler debugger right many things in simple and in one software we are having many things so that is why we use id rather than writing our programs in notepad we generally prefer ids many ids are there so here we use pycharm so after this we will install pycharm okay now let's just uh click on this end download pi cha okay it is by jetbrains so you see the first website only jetbrains.com right it is by jetbrain so just click on that thing and you will find two version here professional as well as community but better to download community version because it would be paid it would be free for it it is professional is a free 30 days trial only so we will download community version okay it has been started now as you can see our setup is also going on and we have so now python 3.10.6 64bit setup is successful we will close this see as you can see also there are various releases previous release 3.10 3.9 3.8 whatever version you want to download you can download right but better to download the latest version that would be fine so as you can see these are the versions you can download other than this version 3.9.6 you can download any other version also it's up to you right but better to download three point x version only know two point x because they have added the support for two point x version right now how to check that we have successfully downloaded this python so just you can just uh click on this you can uh open your command prompt cmd type cmd and this is your command prompt right now here i will write python version hyphen hyphen version so see it is showing me the version 3.10.6 yes it has successfully downloaded and installed sorry why not download it install this python this interpreter for us right so if you enter write python and enter then our this interpreter for us has been started here you can you can use this thing for calculate as a calculator or you can write down your commands here you can do programming also here line by line so see if i write 3 plus 2 it will show me 5 so this can also be used as a calculator so line by line because interpreter would do what integrate line by line not the complete code so only one line you will write and it will show you the result of that line so simply we will exit from here simply type exit and press enter and one more thing we have also included we have also installed pip that was used to install some packages and all if you want to check that thing also you can just write down pip here and just enter so see it will show you something like this the result after uh clicking after writing pip and clicking just enter so this would be the case so means uh tip has also been installed successfully you don't need to do anything loud now they just close it now we will install our python the ide so let's click on this the community version that we have downloaded already and it will show this screen just click on yes and next and this is the destination folder for our this installation then click on next simply click on next or you can write down create if you want to create desktop shortcut you can just click on this open folder as project this also you can click if you want to add bin folder to the path update path variable so i don't want to include this thing you just click on next now right and simply click on install that's it it will take some time right so it's been done now you can just click on the run python community edition and just click on finish so now it will launch and just click on don't import settings and okay right now it will launch your python community edition 2022 now what you need to do obviously the first time so we will create a new project so click on new project okay now see this type of thing would be there on your screen now what you have to do you can just this is your location see my location is this thing and python project so if you want to change the name of your project you can just i'm writing first project that's it now new environment it is showing that virtual environment but we don't need to this we don't need to do this thing we need to do what previously configured interpreter for this it was so now it is showing no interpreter you have to add interpreter because we have already installed python interpreter right so add add local interpreter and i have which interpreter it's python 3.xc location c user and base interpreter is program files python 3.10 3010 and python dot exe right this is my interpreter okay now just click on this so if you are you know if in your laptop it is not showing anything so you can just click on these three dots and you can search you can search in which folder you have installed in c folder in user or python in which folder you have installed that python previously we have installed that python you just go to that folder click go to that folder and click on python dot exe and then select it right in my uh pc i have already this thing python.exe so just click on ok so it is creating uh that environment so see the interpreter is python 3.x sorry 3.10 okay now see create a main dot py welcome script it will create a main dot py the extension for python uh program says dot p i just say for c we have dot c for c plus plus we have dot cpp so same for python we have a dot py so it will create a welcome script for s for us right if you check this if you uncheck this it will not create anything but i'm going to check this okay now let's just create so it is loading our first project c main dot p y so it is a sample python script okay you can say this if you want to check out this thing you can check out otherwise no it's okay you can what you can do you can just remove all these things and we can do our simple like we have now installed our ide so if you want to print hello world in python how you will print it's very simple no need to write down any header file main function and all one line you need to write down okay now if you want to write down that thing in main dot py you can do that thing or otherwise in first project you can you can create you can create a new file right click on first project new the name of our project is first project new and then file i'm creating new file that is first dot py here i'll write my code simply you need to write print and hello world that's it no semicolon nothing else nothing else so you can simply run this here we have a you know this kind of thing hi pycharm so it is okay it is actually running this main dot p y this file main dot p y right we no need to run this file we we need to write we need to run our first dot py this file so now let's uh close that file select this first dot py and sorry here here not main you have to select your current file okay note main here if there is this kind of thing you just select current file and run this now current file is first dot py so it is printing hello world on my screen simple program so i think with this only you can identify how much simpler is to code in this programming language python programming language then c and c plus plus and java and all to print a simple line hello world you just need to write down print and that thing because it is a string or the string you can write down in single quote also here no double quote but actually i am from that c and c plus background so i put string in double quotes and a single character in single code but in python you can write down rather than these double quotes single quotes as well uh single quotes okay let's run this current file and it will print hello world both are same single code or double quote it's up to you so i guess this is clear to you now from the next video we are going to start you know our actual python programming course we will learn about variables how to use those data types string and all you'll see these kind of things so now in the next video till then bye bye take care and if you are finding any difficulty in downloading and installing these kind of things you can let me know in comment section okay so let's see the next video now till then bye take
