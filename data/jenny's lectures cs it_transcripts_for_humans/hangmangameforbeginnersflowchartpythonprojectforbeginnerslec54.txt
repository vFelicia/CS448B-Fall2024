00:00 - so in the series of learning Python
00:01 - programming language we are working on a
00:03 - project Hangman game in the previous
00:05 - video I have just given you an
00:07 - introduction how to play Hangman game
00:09 - what is Hangman game right now I have
00:12 - asked you to draw a flowchart of this
00:13 - game before just you know start writing
00:15 - the code so how to draw a flowchart step
00:18 - by step see first thing is what
00:22 - you have to guess uh one player will
00:25 - guess a word right so we'll generate a
00:28 - word right so first is start
00:34 - the flowchart
00:35 - first step is we are going to start then
00:38 - what
00:40 - generate a word random word right you
00:45 - will be having a word list and generate
00:46 - a random word from that list
00:48 - now obviously in the last example we
00:52 - have seen Apple we have generated apple
00:53 - plus this would not be shown to the
00:55 - second player one two three four five
00:59 - these five blank faces would be shown
01:02 - only right because there are five
01:04 - letters so you have to generate as many
01:07 - blanks as the letters in that word so
01:11 - third step is this one
01:13 - after generating these blanks now
01:17 - user will
01:19 - guess a letter
01:22 - or maybe you can say ask a user to guess
01:25 - a letter now we will check the guest
01:28 - letter is correct or not if user has
01:31 - guessed X so we'll check if x is there
01:33 - or not for each position
01:35 - right so now
01:38 - check
01:39 - check if the guest letter is present in
01:42 - the word or not two cases can be there
01:45 - like maybe yes it is present or no
01:50 - if the letter is present if suppose I
01:53 - have guessed a so a is present so
01:56 - I'll replace this blank with this letter
01:59 - right so replace the blank with the
02:03 - guest letter right because that is
02:06 - correct
02:07 - if no then you are going to lose a life
02:11 - so lose a life
02:16 - right now
02:19 - when to
02:20 - when the game would be over
02:23 - if there is no Blank Space
02:27 - in this word right means you have
02:30 - guessed all the letter right then game
02:32 - over means you are going to win right
02:34 - one is one one condition is this so now
02:38 - we are going to check are all these
02:41 - blank spaces are filled or not so two
02:44 - cases can be there yes or no if no then
02:48 - again guess a letter so if no then again
02:54 - guess a letter if yes
02:57 - then obviously we are going to exit but
02:59 - second
02:59 - condition for game or Resort next is
03:02 - lose a life right so if you are out of
03:05 - lives then also game over and you are
03:07 - going to print a message you are going
03:08 - to lose so now it will be checked
03:13 - out of
03:15 - lives
03:19 - still any live remaining or you know
03:21 - life remaining or not you are out of
03:23 - lives or not if yes out of life then
03:28 - game over
03:29 - so here
03:31 - they are going to meet like like this
03:33 - and
03:34 - game over
03:37 - or print an appropriate message if no if
03:40 - there are still
03:42 - lives remaining then again what
03:46 - control will go here you have to then
03:49 - again guess a letter
03:51 - so I guess this is not too tough
03:55 - this is what a flowchart
03:57 - of Hangman game now according to this
04:00 - flowchart now we have you know divided
04:03 - or problem in simpler one now you have
04:05 - to write down the code right
04:08 - the steps you have to do what what first
04:11 - of all will generate a word from a word
04:14 - list this thing will do then we are
04:17 - going to replace these blanks so we have
04:19 - you know
04:20 - divided or complex problem into these
04:23 - smaller smaller problems
04:25 - so you have to focus first on this thing
04:27 - how to generate a word from a word list
04:29 - random word actually
04:32 - so you if you have you are aware about
04:34 - this random module then you can do this
04:36 - is easily right so what knowledge you
04:39 - have to you know till now what you have
04:41 - learned like random module for Loop
04:43 - while loop
04:44 - a membership operator also like in not
04:47 - in
04:48 - these kind of things you have to use to
04:51 - make this project right
04:53 - okay now in the next video we'll be
04:56 - seeing the complete code right so now
04:58 - I'll show you in the next video till
04:59 - then bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning Python programming language we are working on a project Hangman game in the previous video I have just given you an introduction how to play Hangman game what is Hangman game right now I have asked you to draw a flowchart of this game before just you know start writing the code so how to draw a flowchart step by step see first thing is what you have to guess uh one player will guess a word right so we'll generate a word right so first is start the flowchart first step is we are going to start then what generate a word random word right you will be having a word list and generate a random word from that list now obviously in the last example we have seen Apple we have generated apple plus this would not be shown to the second player one two three four five these five blank faces would be shown only right because there are five letters so you have to generate as many blanks as the letters in that word so third step is this one after generating these blanks now user will guess a letter or maybe you can say ask a user to guess a letter now we will check the guest letter is correct or not if user has guessed X so we'll check if x is there or not for each position right so now check check if the guest letter is present in the word or not two cases can be there like maybe yes it is present or no if the letter is present if suppose I have guessed a so a is present so I'll replace this blank with this letter right so replace the blank with the guest letter right because that is correct if no then you are going to lose a life so lose a life right now when to when the game would be over if there is no Blank Space in this word right means you have guessed all the letter right then game over means you are going to win right one is one one condition is this so now we are going to check are all these blank spaces are filled or not so two cases can be there yes or no if no then again guess a letter so if no then again guess a letter if yes then obviously we are going to exit but second condition for game or Resort next is lose a life right so if you are out of lives then also game over and you are going to print a message you are going to lose so now it will be checked out of lives still any live remaining or you know life remaining or not you are out of lives or not if yes out of life then game over so here they are going to meet like like this and game over or print an appropriate message if no if there are still lives remaining then again what control will go here you have to then again guess a letter so I guess this is not too tough this is what a flowchart of Hangman game now according to this flowchart now we have you know divided or problem in simpler one now you have to write down the code right the steps you have to do what what first of all will generate a word from a word list this thing will do then we are going to replace these blanks so we have you know divided or complex problem into these smaller smaller problems so you have to focus first on this thing how to generate a word from a word list random word actually so you if you have you are aware about this random module then you can do this is easily right so what knowledge you have to you know till now what you have learned like random module for Loop while loop a membership operator also like in not in these kind of things you have to use to make this project right okay now in the next video we'll be seeing the complete code right so now I'll show you in the next video till then bye take care
