00:00 - so in the series of learning Python
00:02 - programming language in the previous
00:03 - video we have seen one coding exercise
00:05 - live in weeks and we have discussed what
00:08 - are up string and based on that we have
00:10 - seen that exercise right
00:12 - so now in this video we'll talk about if
00:14 - statement and if else statement in
00:16 - Python these are known as conditional
00:17 - statements or control statements also we
00:20 - can say decision making statements
00:22 - simple if if else nested if else La LC
00:27 - platter these are decision making
00:29 - statements right or conditional
00:30 - statements
00:31 - so one by one we will discussing these
00:33 - statements in this video we'll talk
00:34 - about if and if else with the help of
00:36 - real life example as well as with the
00:38 - help of program the syntax when we
00:40 - should use if else when we should we
00:42 - should use if statement all the things
00:44 - we'll be discussing in this video right
00:46 - now before they just want to tell you
00:48 - one thing see the journey towards
00:49 - becoming a PSU officer or pursuing mtech
00:52 - from IIT or other Elite Institute is
00:54 - going to be long and challenging
00:56 - so for you to stay focused on your path
00:59 - here are some confidence booster
01:00 - initiative by an academy an academy is
01:03 - going to start Udan batch for gate 2024
01:06 - aspirant and bunyad Bash for 2020
01:09 - five aspirants so here an academy stop
01:12 - educators will be teaching you in these
01:13 - batches and these batches would be in
01:15 - English language both Hindi and English
01:17 - but if you want to attend lectures in
01:19 - complete English language then for you
01:21 - also they have started batches in ignite
01:23 - 2.0 for gate 2024 aspirant and
01:25 - foundation for gate 2020 5 aspirants in
01:30 - these batches you will get comprehensive
01:31 - syllabus coverage PSU exam preparation
01:34 - interview preparation previous year
01:35 - questions plus daily practice question
01:38 - and digital books home delivered printed
01:41 - books practice portion of you know
01:43 - practice of test series and much more
01:45 - and one more thing on this Republic Day
01:47 - an academic is also you know providing
01:49 - you some offers if you take Plus or
01:52 - iconic subscription of gate and ESC you
01:55 - can save up to 30 percent yes you can
01:57 - see on my screen here the price detail
02:00 - but this offer is valid till 28th of
02:02 - January
02:04 - and remember one thing they'll be price
02:06 - hike soon for this subscription so do
02:08 - not wait and subscribe today and start
02:10 - your gate and Esa preparation
02:13 - and to Avail these discounts use my code
02:15 - jkl10 so all the relevant links and
02:17 - details you will get in the description
02:18 - box of this video you can go and check
02:20 - out now let's see what are what are the
02:23 - this if else and if statement in Python
02:25 - see let's take one real life example
02:28 - whenever you go to generally you travel
02:30 - in Metro so there is a board like if
02:34 - your child height is less than three
02:37 - feet then no token required right you
02:40 - don't need to purchase any token or
02:42 - ticket anything right but if height is
02:45 - more than three feet three feet then you
02:48 - have to purchase token so there is some
02:50 - condition right
02:52 - in a real life also every day we are
02:54 - facing these type of conditions and
02:56 - based on some conditions we take
02:58 - decisions
02:59 - right like if you go to supermarket and
03:02 - your mom say please bring some you can
03:06 - say buy some apple
03:08 - maybe you'll ask if apples are not
03:10 - available then what should I buy then
03:13 - maybe oranges and if oranges are not
03:16 - available then
03:17 - maybe dragon fruit
03:19 - so there also you have to decide like
03:22 - maybe you are a coffee lover or but
03:25 - based on your pocket money you will have
03:27 - coffee maybe in Starbucks or at some
03:30 - store
03:31 - now that that decision is based on your
03:34 - pocket money right how much money you
03:36 - have so in real life also we are taking
03:39 - multiple you know many decisions every
03:41 - day
03:42 - so when we write program then also
03:45 - obviously we will maybe we are working
03:47 - on a project we'll create some product
03:49 - and all
03:50 - so to map these decision making these
03:53 - things in programming
03:55 - how you can write down these things
03:57 - so for those we have conditional
04:00 - statements using IF else using alif
04:03 - using you know multiple effects
04:04 - necessary fails else if ladder we can
04:07 - map these decisions we can write down
04:09 - these decisions in our programming in
04:12 - program in the form of programs
04:14 - right so that is why these are known as
04:16 - conditional statements or you can say
04:18 - decision making statements
04:20 - fine
04:22 - now that that let's take that that
04:24 - example that height height of your child
04:26 - so if I
04:29 - like if I draw a flowchart then
04:31 - obviously start and here we have a
04:33 - condition height
04:36 - is greater than three feet I am taking
04:40 - height I am taking in feet
04:42 - two condition can be there yes your
04:45 - child height is
04:46 - a greater than three or not or no if yes
04:50 - height is greater than 3 feet then
04:54 - token required
04:56 - to board Metro
04:58 - if no then no token required
05:02 - so this is how we can
05:05 - like we can you know draw a flowchart
05:08 - kind of thing
05:09 - right this is the case
05:12 - so to map this thing in program what we
05:16 - will write if else because here we have
05:19 - two choices yes or no so if or else
05:23 - if apples are there in Supermarket by
05:25 - apples
05:26 - by apples otherwise buy oranges two
05:29 - choices you have
05:31 - right
05:33 - if there is only one choice maybe your
05:36 - mom say if apples are available then buy
05:38 - apples otherwise
05:40 - nothing back to your own come back so
05:44 - that that we can write with simple if no
05:46 - else required but here we have two
05:48 - choices so if and else right
05:51 - now what is this General syntax of
05:54 - writing if simple we will write if and
05:56 - here some condition
05:58 - then Colin then the block of statement
06:01 - that should be executed if this
06:03 - condition is true that would be here we
06:05 - can write down like do this
06:07 - else
06:09 - colon
06:10 - do this
06:12 - right
06:13 - C let me just tell you one thing one
06:17 - thing is very very very important
06:19 - when you write if else in python or when
06:21 - you write programming in Python that is
06:23 - indentation
06:26 - because python basically use indentation
06:30 - to identify a block
06:32 - what is this indentation like if you
06:35 - write this statement then after some
06:38 - space this space
06:39 - before you know in the beginning of this
06:42 - line This is known as indentation right
06:46 - so if we write condition condition you
06:48 - can write down in these brackets also or
06:51 - if you do not put these brackets that is
06:53 - also fine in Python right both the cases
06:56 - are true
06:57 - but this space this indentation is must
07:01 - directly you cannot write down from here
07:03 - do this that will give you error I'll
07:06 - show you with the help of programming
07:07 - right what type of error you will get
07:09 - after else also you have to do some
07:12 - indentation and here if we are writing
07:14 - multiple statement like three statements
07:16 - so all the three statements should be
07:18 - intended
07:20 - leave some space here and then write
07:22 - down these statements right so those
07:24 - statements would be considered as block
07:26 - of statement after if right so this is
07:28 - General syntax of writing if now let me
07:32 - just show you uh this thing with the
07:34 - help of one program and practically
07:36 - we'll see this thing
07:38 - so here obviously this condition should
07:40 - be evaluated and should return either
07:42 - true or false based on true or true or
07:44 - false this the control will go either in
07:48 - this blue Orient this block right so
07:50 - like height greater than 3 so we'll
07:52 - enter height like height is 4 4 is
07:54 - greater than 3 or not yes so that will
07:57 - give you that will give true so true
07:59 - means token required Yes means this way
08:01 - will go right so here we are using these
08:05 - relational operators or we can say
08:06 - comparison operators we have discussed
08:08 - this thing like less than equal to
08:09 - greater than equal to or like less than
08:11 - greater than or double equal to like for
08:15 - equality check we use double equal to or
08:17 - not equal to these are some
08:20 - relational operators for comparison
08:22 - operators we can use while checking some
08:24 - condition while giving here some
08:26 - condition right
08:27 - now let's see with the help of one
08:28 - program and if you want to draw General
08:30 - flowchart for this if else then simply
08:32 - here we rather than height greater than
08:34 - 3 we simply write like condition
08:37 - here condition
08:43 - true
08:45 - or folds two cases can be there right
08:47 - not yes or no true true means here we
08:49 - can write if block statement
08:52 - if block statement would be executed
08:54 - here else block statement would be
08:56 - executed and after that obviously
08:58 - program will
09:00 - you know after whatever statements after
09:02 - those if else block that would be
09:04 - executed right right that would be
09:06 - executed statement out of if else look
09:09 - that would be executed right so this you
09:12 - can say General flowchart of if else
09:13 - right
09:15 - so let's create a new file and we will
09:18 - be discussing if else right so if
09:21 - underscore else dot p y
09:24 - right let's take
09:27 - height
09:28 - so directly when we are taking using
09:31 - input function we can convert that into
09:34 - integer because
09:36 - we know
09:42 - enter height whatever you will take
09:44 - using input function that would be
09:46 - string so convert that into int right
09:50 - now
09:52 - let's check what is the condition if
09:55 - height your child height child sided is
09:58 - uh greater than three feet let me just
10:01 - write down this thing enter height in
10:04 - feet
10:05 - right so if
10:09 - height
10:10 - greater than 3. feet right
10:15 - colon
10:16 - see
10:18 - as you can see whenever
10:21 - the cursor is here and whenever y I will
10:24 - enter I will press enter see
10:26 - automatically the cursor is here
10:28 - there are some space in the beginning of
10:32 - this line so that is what indentation
10:34 - that is very important
10:36 - then
10:38 - print
10:40 - what we should print height is greater
10:42 - than three then
10:44 - token
10:46 - required or we can say by
10:51 - token
10:52 - right
10:54 - enter now
10:56 - else we will write here no indentation
11:00 - before else colon
11:02 - and print
11:05 - note open required right okay let's run
11:08 - this and I'll show you first of all see
11:11 - it is asking enter height in feet I am
11:13 - entering 4.
11:16 - so by token because height is 4 greater
11:20 - than 3 this condition is true so control
11:21 - will enter here and by token
11:24 - right if I again run this and I enter 2
11:30 - then no token required because condition
11:33 - is not true in this case so control will
11:35 - go in else part and no token required so
11:38 - this is simple working of a fence
11:39 - statement now let me just show you
11:42 - something if you do not
11:45 - put here that indentation or the white
11:48 - space then see you can see this red line
11:50 - here and let's run this
11:53 - see
11:56 - this there is something wrong here
11:58 - because this this is some Arrow there is
12:00 - something wrong here so it will give you
12:02 - glue and error is indentation error
12:06 - there are names this is indentational
12:08 - expected and indented block after if
12:10 - statement on line number three
12:13 - so after F there should be some
12:16 - indentation that is indentation block so
12:21 - that should be
12:24 - indented and if I write one more
12:27 - statement like print
12:29 - buy token token and
12:32 - now
12:34 - you can
12:36 - board the Metro
12:39 - right so see these both these statements
12:42 - are intended
12:44 - right so this would be considered as a
12:47 - complete block
12:48 - of statement after if so now if I run
12:51 - this and if I enter height
12:54 - like five so buy token and now you can
12:59 - board the metal these two print
13:01 - statement would be executed because this
13:03 - is now block of statements after if
13:05 - right but after this if I
13:09 - do not put any indented indentation it
13:13 - will give error let's run this
13:15 - C syntax error
13:17 - this is syntax error something here in
13:21 - else part because between if and else
13:23 - this print statement would not be
13:25 - considered now as a part of this if
13:27 - block right but if you are using IF else
13:30 - between if and else there should be
13:33 - nothing
13:34 - right and you are writing this statement
13:36 - so this is wrong
13:39 - better you put this
13:41 - in this block right so I hope you got
13:44 - this thing
13:45 - how to use if else now if simple if
13:48 - rather than else we have only one choice
13:50 - simple if right no else part let's
13:54 - suppose remove the sales part comment
13:56 - this out
13:59 - if height is greater than 3
14:03 - then buy a token and
14:08 - this thing that is only case no else
14:10 - part let's run this
14:13 - greater than 3 means six so buy token
14:17 - now you can board the metro and if this
14:19 - is less than three like two nothing
14:21 - would be printed because there is no
14:23 - else part but but if I write one more
14:26 - line something like this
14:29 - print
14:32 - out of if
14:36 - block
14:37 - the statement is out of fifth law
14:39 - because there is no indentation here
14:40 - let's run this
14:42 - and height is now I'm entering two so
14:45 - now it will print out of if block this
14:48 - print statement only because these two
14:50 - print statement would be considered as
14:52 - part of this if because these are
14:53 - intended this is not intended so this is
14:56 - out of it if I do not put any
14:58 - indentation here so now this only would
15:01 - be part of this if block these two are
15:03 - not part of if block let's run this and
15:06 - if I enter 6.
15:10 - so height is greater than
15:12 - 6 is greater than 3 so only one line
15:15 - would be printed by token that's it
15:16 - right sorry buy token and now there is
15:20 - no else part so these two statements are
15:22 - part of program only so obviously after
15:25 - if those statement would be executed
15:28 - that are part of program normal
15:29 - execution of program would be there so
15:31 - these three statements would be executed
15:34 - right and if I run this and if I enter
15:37 - like height is 2
15:39 - now only
15:40 - 2 statement would be executed now you
15:43 - can board the metro and out of if block
15:44 - these two only
15:46 - because now this print by token is part
15:48 - of the sift block right and if you do
15:51 - not put like these sorry the these
15:54 - brackets that is also fine
15:57 - because I am actually from C and C plus
15:58 - plus background so that is why I used to
16:01 - put these brackets let's run this there
16:04 - would be no error right height is 3 if I
16:08 - enter height 3 because 3 Less Than 3 no
16:12 - condition is not true
16:15 - so now know if block these two statement
16:17 - would be would be executed right
16:20 - let's do this thing
16:26 - and let's comment this out
16:28 - and if you want to put that condition
16:30 - also like if your child height is
16:31 - greater than or equal to 3
16:34 - then you have to buy a token
16:37 - Less Than 3 then we need to buy so less
16:40 - than equal to greater than equal to this
16:41 - and you can put or if double equal to
16:43 - you want to check equality then double
16:45 - equal to also we can check but for
16:46 - equality you have to use double equal to
16:48 - not single equal to that is not
16:51 - that would be sub there would be some
16:52 - some error like if I put only one one
16:56 - equal to I want to check equality if
16:58 - height is equal to 3 but I
17:00 - only put one equal to so there would be
17:03 - some error let let me just run this and
17:05 - see
17:07 - it is showing here are some error if
17:09 - white is equal to syntax error invalid
17:10 - syntax maybe you meant double equal to
17:13 - or this instead of this so it is giving
17:16 - you some clue also you can read out
17:18 - these error and you can check where is
17:20 - the error so here it should must be some
17:22 - error
17:23 - so maybe it's not not equal to what
17:26 - double equal to which will be double
17:28 - equal to now it is there would be no
17:30 - error right
17:32 - if I enter write 4 then no token
17:35 - required because condition is not true
17:38 - height is not equal to 3 right so I hope
17:40 - now you got basics of if and if else
17:43 - statements and how to use them and what
17:45 - is indentation and how this indentation
17:47 - is important if before the site before
17:50 - writing this if we put space
17:53 - see here also in Python it will give
17:56 - error you cannot put
17:58 - any space before beginning of any line
18:01 - you can put space after
18:04 - you know at starting of those statement
18:06 - which are part of if block or else block
18:08 - right till now we have discussed till
18:11 - now if else on your if so see it will
18:14 - give error
18:16 - indentation error unexpected intent here
18:19 - height this this is the first line on
18:22 - unexpected intent so do not put any
18:25 - space here
18:26 - right so I hope you got what is if and
18:29 - what as if else how to use them when to
18:32 - use them and how to write down this
18:33 - thing in your program so in the next
18:35 - video we'll see when coding exercise
18:36 - based on these FL statements when I will
18:38 - say the next video till then bye take
18:40 - care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen one coding exercise live in weeks and we have discussed what are up string and based on that we have seen that exercise right so now in this video we'll talk about if statement and if else statement in Python these are known as conditional statements or control statements also we can say decision making statements simple if if else nested if else La LC platter these are decision making statements right or conditional statements so one by one we will discussing these statements in this video we'll talk about if and if else with the help of real life example as well as with the help of program the syntax when we should use if else when we should we should use if statement all the things we'll be discussing in this video right now before they just want to tell you one thing see the journey towards becoming a PSU officer or pursuing mtech from IIT or other Elite Institute is going to be long and challenging so for you to stay focused on your path here are some confidence booster initiative by an academy an academy is going to start Udan batch for gate 2024 aspirant and bunyad Bash for 2020 five aspirants so here an academy stop educators will be teaching you in these batches and these batches would be in English language both Hindi and English but if you want to attend lectures in complete English language then for you also they have started batches in ignite 2.0 for gate 2024 aspirant and foundation for gate 2020 5 aspirants in these batches you will get comprehensive syllabus coverage PSU exam preparation interview preparation previous year questions plus daily practice question and digital books home delivered printed books practice portion of you know practice of test series and much more and one more thing on this Republic Day an academic is also you know providing you some offers if you take Plus or iconic subscription of gate and ESC you can save up to 30 percent yes you can see on my screen here the price detail but this offer is valid till 28th of January and remember one thing they'll be price hike soon for this subscription so do not wait and subscribe today and start your gate and Esa preparation and to Avail these discounts use my code jkl10 so all the relevant links and details you will get in the description box of this video you can go and check out now let's see what are what are the this if else and if statement in Python see let's take one real life example whenever you go to generally you travel in Metro so there is a board like if your child height is less than three feet then no token required right you don't need to purchase any token or ticket anything right but if height is more than three feet three feet then you have to purchase token so there is some condition right in a real life also every day we are facing these type of conditions and based on some conditions we take decisions right like if you go to supermarket and your mom say please bring some you can say buy some apple maybe you'll ask if apples are not available then what should I buy then maybe oranges and if oranges are not available then maybe dragon fruit so there also you have to decide like maybe you are a coffee lover or but based on your pocket money you will have coffee maybe in Starbucks or at some store now that that decision is based on your pocket money right how much money you have so in real life also we are taking multiple you know many decisions every day so when we write program then also obviously we will maybe we are working on a project we'll create some product and all so to map these decision making these things in programming how you can write down these things so for those we have conditional statements using IF else using alif using you know multiple effects necessary fails else if ladder we can map these decisions we can write down these decisions in our programming in program in the form of programs right so that is why these are known as conditional statements or you can say decision making statements fine now that that let's take that that example that height height of your child so if I like if I draw a flowchart then obviously start and here we have a condition height is greater than three feet I am taking height I am taking in feet two condition can be there yes your child height is a greater than three or not or no if yes height is greater than 3 feet then token required to board Metro if no then no token required so this is how we can like we can you know draw a flowchart kind of thing right this is the case so to map this thing in program what we will write if else because here we have two choices yes or no so if or else if apples are there in Supermarket by apples by apples otherwise buy oranges two choices you have right if there is only one choice maybe your mom say if apples are available then buy apples otherwise nothing back to your own come back so that that we can write with simple if no else required but here we have two choices so if and else right now what is this General syntax of writing if simple we will write if and here some condition then Colin then the block of statement that should be executed if this condition is true that would be here we can write down like do this else colon do this right C let me just tell you one thing one thing is very very very important when you write if else in python or when you write programming in Python that is indentation because python basically use indentation to identify a block what is this indentation like if you write this statement then after some space this space before you know in the beginning of this line This is known as indentation right so if we write condition condition you can write down in these brackets also or if you do not put these brackets that is also fine in Python right both the cases are true but this space this indentation is must directly you cannot write down from here do this that will give you error I'll show you with the help of programming right what type of error you will get after else also you have to do some indentation and here if we are writing multiple statement like three statements so all the three statements should be intended leave some space here and then write down these statements right so those statements would be considered as block of statement after if right so this is General syntax of writing if now let me just show you uh this thing with the help of one program and practically we'll see this thing so here obviously this condition should be evaluated and should return either true or false based on true or true or false this the control will go either in this blue Orient this block right so like height greater than 3 so we'll enter height like height is 4 4 is greater than 3 or not yes so that will give you that will give true so true means token required Yes means this way will go right so here we are using these relational operators or we can say comparison operators we have discussed this thing like less than equal to greater than equal to or like less than greater than or double equal to like for equality check we use double equal to or not equal to these are some relational operators for comparison operators we can use while checking some condition while giving here some condition right now let's see with the help of one program and if you want to draw General flowchart for this if else then simply here we rather than height greater than 3 we simply write like condition here condition true or folds two cases can be there right not yes or no true true means here we can write if block statement if block statement would be executed here else block statement would be executed and after that obviously program will you know after whatever statements after those if else block that would be executed right right that would be executed statement out of if else look that would be executed right so this you can say General flowchart of if else right so let's create a new file and we will be discussing if else right so if underscore else dot p y right let's take height so directly when we are taking using input function we can convert that into integer because we know enter height whatever you will take using input function that would be string so convert that into int right now let's check what is the condition if height your child height child sided is uh greater than three feet let me just write down this thing enter height in feet right so if height greater than 3. feet right colon see as you can see whenever the cursor is here and whenever y I will enter I will press enter see automatically the cursor is here there are some space in the beginning of this line so that is what indentation that is very important then print what we should print height is greater than three then token required or we can say by token right enter now else we will write here no indentation before else colon and print note open required right okay let's run this and I'll show you first of all see it is asking enter height in feet I am entering 4. so by token because height is 4 greater than 3 this condition is true so control will enter here and by token right if I again run this and I enter 2 then no token required because condition is not true in this case so control will go in else part and no token required so this is simple working of a fence statement now let me just show you something if you do not put here that indentation or the white space then see you can see this red line here and let's run this see this there is something wrong here because this this is some Arrow there is something wrong here so it will give you glue and error is indentation error there are names this is indentational expected and indented block after if statement on line number three so after F there should be some indentation that is indentation block so that should be indented and if I write one more statement like print buy token token and now you can board the Metro right so see these both these statements are intended right so this would be considered as a complete block of statement after if so now if I run this and if I enter height like five so buy token and now you can board the metal these two print statement would be executed because this is now block of statements after if right but after this if I do not put any indented indentation it will give error let's run this C syntax error this is syntax error something here in else part because between if and else this print statement would not be considered now as a part of this if block right but if you are using IF else between if and else there should be nothing right and you are writing this statement so this is wrong better you put this in this block right so I hope you got this thing how to use if else now if simple if rather than else we have only one choice simple if right no else part let's suppose remove the sales part comment this out if height is greater than 3 then buy a token and this thing that is only case no else part let's run this greater than 3 means six so buy token now you can board the metro and if this is less than three like two nothing would be printed because there is no else part but but if I write one more line something like this print out of if block the statement is out of fifth law because there is no indentation here let's run this and height is now I'm entering two so now it will print out of if block this print statement only because these two print statement would be considered as part of this if because these are intended this is not intended so this is out of it if I do not put any indentation here so now this only would be part of this if block these two are not part of if block let's run this and if I enter 6. so height is greater than 6 is greater than 3 so only one line would be printed by token that's it right sorry buy token and now there is no else part so these two statements are part of program only so obviously after if those statement would be executed that are part of program normal execution of program would be there so these three statements would be executed right and if I run this and if I enter like height is 2 now only 2 statement would be executed now you can board the metro and out of if block these two only because now this print by token is part of the sift block right and if you do not put like these sorry the these brackets that is also fine because I am actually from C and C plus plus background so that is why I used to put these brackets let's run this there would be no error right height is 3 if I enter height 3 because 3 Less Than 3 no condition is not true so now know if block these two statement would be would be executed right let's do this thing and let's comment this out and if you want to put that condition also like if your child height is greater than or equal to 3 then you have to buy a token Less Than 3 then we need to buy so less than equal to greater than equal to this and you can put or if double equal to you want to check equality then double equal to also we can check but for equality you have to use double equal to not single equal to that is not that would be sub there would be some some error like if I put only one one equal to I want to check equality if height is equal to 3 but I only put one equal to so there would be some error let let me just run this and see it is showing here are some error if white is equal to syntax error invalid syntax maybe you meant double equal to or this instead of this so it is giving you some clue also you can read out these error and you can check where is the error so here it should must be some error so maybe it's not not equal to what double equal to which will be double equal to now it is there would be no error right if I enter write 4 then no token required because condition is not true height is not equal to 3 right so I hope now you got basics of if and if else statements and how to use them and what is indentation and how this indentation is important if before the site before writing this if we put space see here also in Python it will give error you cannot put any space before beginning of any line you can put space after you know at starting of those statement which are part of if block or else block right till now we have discussed till now if else on your if so see it will give error indentation error unexpected intent here height this this is the first line on unexpected intent so do not put any space here right so I hope you got what is if and what as if else how to use them when to use them and how to write down this thing in your program so in the next video we'll see when coding exercise based on these FL statements when I will say the next video till then bye take care
