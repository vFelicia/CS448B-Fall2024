With timestamps:

00:00 - so in the series of learning Python
00:02 - programming language in the previous
00:03 - video we have implemented a game that
00:06 - that was our first project in the series
00:08 - right rock paper scissors so I hope you
00:11 - wrote that game and you have implemented
00:13 - that successfully right now in the next
00:15 - in this video we will be talking about
00:16 - what are tuples in Python till now we
00:19 - have discussed less than python list
00:21 - basically used to store
00:22 - what uh multiple items in a single
00:25 - variable right it's a sequence dated I
00:28 - in Python right same at tuples like list
00:34 - tuples are also used to store multiple
00:36 - items multiple sorry values multiple
00:39 - items in a single variable name right
00:41 - but these are having some differences
00:45 - with list so how does Tuple you know
00:47 - tuples are different from list
00:49 - right that will talk about this video
00:52 - right how to like different different
00:54 - functions that we can or you can say in
00:57 - inbuilt function that we can Implement
00:59 - on tuples how to use tuples in a program
01:01 - right the syntax and all you'll be
01:03 - discussing with the help of program
01:05 - practical also I will show you right
01:08 - so now I told you tuples are used to
01:11 - store multiple items in a single
01:13 - variables if you want to store a single
01:15 - data then we simply create a variable
01:17 - you know like or any variable name I'm
01:20 - taking a a is equal to 10. means one
01:23 - value we can store in single variable
01:24 - but I want to store multiple values 10
01:26 - 20 30 like this so you have to create
01:29 - multiple variables
01:30 - for that because one variable can store
01:33 - only one value if you want to store five
01:34 - value you have to get five variables but
01:36 - that is not a good idea if you want to
01:37 - store 10 values 15 values 100 values
01:40 - right
01:41 - same as we can we have discussed like in
01:43 - C and C plus plus in other languages we
01:45 - have arrays
01:46 - right homogeneous a collection of data
01:50 - same here we have like list also
01:53 - can store multiple values in a single
01:54 - variable doubles also you can store
01:56 - multiple items in a single variable
01:59 - right same set and dictionaries though
02:01 - that also will be discussing in later
02:03 - videos right these four are inbuilt data
02:05 - types that are used to store sequence of
02:08 - you know items you can say used to store
02:11 - collections of data right so now how we
02:15 - can
02:15 - what is the syntax
02:17 - how you can define a double right
02:20 - simply you will write the Tuple name I
02:23 - am taking like
02:24 - Apple One
02:26 - equal to the list of items you want to
02:29 - store but that list sorry the the items
02:32 - you want to store but this would be
02:34 - round brackets in list we use square
02:37 - brackets these brackets right this is
02:40 - the first difference
02:42 - so here we can store like 10 1 minus 10
02:45 - 15 20. so this is what at about
02:49 - simple
02:51 - not integer you can store
02:53 - like this string also
02:56 - this is also a double string
02:58 - so this items can be of any error type
03:01 - and a mixed is also possible like we
03:05 - have a tuple three so here we can have
03:07 - like integer we can have string in the
03:10 - same Tuple we can have like Boolean we
03:14 - can have like float
03:17 - so mix data type in the same Tuple is
03:21 - also possible same as list right that is
03:23 - possible
03:25 - this is valid this is valid this is also
03:26 - valid now if you
03:28 - if you create one thing if you want to
03:30 - create a tuple
03:32 - double four with only one value one
03:36 - value but this is not correct
03:38 - the necessary condition is you have to
03:41 - put coma after this item if you do not
03:44 - put this comma
03:45 - this the python will not recognize it as
03:48 - a tuple right if I'm
03:52 - Apple 5 is equal to 10 so these are two
03:56 - tuples and suppose if you want to find
03:59 - out the type of any data so simply we
04:01 - use that I function so if I
04:04 - write here type
04:06 - and here I am writing Tuple 4
04:08 - and one thing type and apple Phi
04:16 - so obviously like this is what end if
04:19 - you want to find out the type of this
04:20 - this is end this will give you Str this
04:23 - will give you Boolean this will give you
04:24 - a float same the Tuple is what the type
04:27 - is what
04:32 - it will give the data type double but it
04:36 - will give only integer because this will
04:39 - not recognize it as a tuple this will
04:41 - take is at a as an integer only so you
04:44 - have to put comma after the single item
04:47 - if you want to create a tuple with
04:49 - single item right how to access with
04:51 - index indexing like index is 0 1 2 3 4
04:55 - same as list negative index also
04:57 - possible minus 1 minus 2 minus three
04:58 - something like this
05:00 - slicing is also possible some functions
05:02 - are there you can find out length of a
05:03 - tuple you can concatenate two tuples
05:05 - right
05:06 - what you can do and your nesting of
05:09 - tuples are also possible you can use
05:11 - count function index function on tuples
05:13 - right so all these things will be
05:15 - discussing practically I hope now some
05:18 - query part what is double how to define
05:20 - a double that is clear to you guys right
05:22 - now let's see
05:24 - with the help of program I'll show you
05:26 - all the functions on the troubles how
05:28 - you can use this thing in your program
05:30 - okay so let's create a new project here
05:35 - a new file
05:43 - underscore python.py right and here
05:46 - we'll just create it upper like okay how
05:49 - to create
05:50 - the name of the stuple these brackets
05:53 - round brackets and whatever value you
05:55 - want to store like I want to store 12
05:57 - then 6 then minus 8 then Jenny then
06:04 - like true so if you want to check out if
06:08 - this Tuple has been created then simply
06:10 - you can print and that couple name
06:13 - double one and we can simply run this
06:16 - and I'll show you
06:19 - see it will show you the this double
06:21 - right now indexing is also possible see
06:25 - I am going to tell you all the
06:26 - properties of Tuple right now so you can
06:28 - write down
06:29 - like indexing is also possible I want to
06:32 - access
06:34 - first only uh you can say the second
06:36 - element six here so what is the index
06:39 - index start from 0 0 1 so index 4 6 is 1
06:43 - simply here but indexing in indexing we
06:47 - will use these square brackets only not
06:50 - round brackets while creating Tuple
06:53 - rather than square bracket we use these
06:55 - round brackets not square brackets
06:57 - square brackets used when we creating
06:59 - lists but while accessing if you want to
07:02 - give the index number that obviously
07:04 - that will be given in square brackets so
07:06 - Tuple and one now it will give you six
07:10 - the output would be 6 at this time C
07:13 - okay so indexing is also possible
07:15 - negative indexing is possible now I want
07:17 - minus like minus 2. so what it will give
07:21 - it will give you Jane C it will give you
07:24 - Journey negative indexing start from
07:26 - minus one minus one minus two minus
07:27 - three because it's not like minus zero
07:29 - minus zero is nothing it's only zero so
07:32 - and if I will write something like this
07:35 - minus 6.
07:37 - so obviously there is no minus 6 index
07:40 - so double index out of range right and
07:43 - if I write same like if I write 7
07:47 - so this is also out of index because
07:49 - double index out of range 0 1 2 3 4 only
07:53 - 4 if you will if you you will give you
07:55 - here five that also will give you index
07:57 - out of Ranger so indexing is possible
07:59 - now next thing if you want to find out
08:01 - the type
08:02 - I have told you like in that while we
08:06 - were discussing the query so we simply
08:08 - use that type function type and in
08:11 - bracket simply write the name of the
08:13 - Tuple so now it will give you what see
08:16 - the class is what Tuple right
08:20 - now if you want to create let me show
08:22 - you
08:23 - Triple Two
08:24 - one
08:27 - Tuple with one item and I write only 45
08:30 - right so let's check out the type of
08:34 - this double Tuple two type Tuple
08:37 - two
08:38 - maybe you are thinking it's Tuple so it
08:40 - should give you the type is Tuple but it
08:42 - will give you end C
08:45 - because it python will not recognize it
08:48 - as double so you have to put a comma
08:51 - here
08:51 - right one item then comma yeah this time
08:56 - it would be considered as double right
08:58 - yeah one thing tuples are immutable
09:01 - means unchangeable let's start mutable
09:04 - you can add you can change the data you
09:06 - can remove the data after you have
09:08 - created the list but once you created a
09:10 - tuple double one double one you cannot
09:13 - add any data you cannot change the data
09:15 - you cannot remove the data so tuples are
09:18 - immutable means unchangeable right let
09:21 - me show you if I write if I want to
09:24 - change double like Tuple one and at
09:27 - zeroth index
09:29 - now I have 12 but I want here rather
09:32 - than 12 it should be 13.
09:35 - right and then simply I want to print
09:39 - node type I want to print only Tuple one
09:42 - right now let's
09:45 - comment out this double too okay let's
09:48 - run this
09:49 - see it will give you error type error
09:53 - this Tuple object this double object
09:56 - does not support item assignment you
09:59 - cannot change the value assignment is
10:01 - not possible
10:02 - you cannot add any value you cannot
10:04 - remove like delete function is also not
10:07 - here right like not not working here
10:09 - right so tuples are immutable that makes
10:11 - it makes it different from list
10:15 - so if you want that you want only five
10:17 - items and you will not you don't want to
10:19 - change these items further so you can
10:21 - use double right so this would be the
10:23 - iteration would be fast
10:25 - right because of this unchangeable
10:28 - behavior of tuples
10:30 - so it will increase the speed of
10:32 - execution speed of your program
10:35 - okay now next is what okay these items
10:38 - are ordered so they have a defined order
10:40 - and you cannot change the order right
10:42 - now next property is what
10:45 - okay duplicate items are also allowed
10:48 - like Interpol I
10:49 - am again writing 12 I'm writing 6 again
10:53 - so see 12 12 6 6 duplicate items are
10:55 - there so that are allowed
10:59 - let's print double one
11:01 - see
11:03 - duplicate items are from insects
11:05 - duplicates items are not allowed right
11:07 - next is we'll see Tuple slicing is also
11:10 - possible like in string and list also
11:12 - slicing is possible like if I want to
11:15 - access the apple one and I will give
11:18 - like from first index to I'm not giving
11:22 - anything so first index to by default it
11:24 - will take from the last till the last
11:27 - so what it will print 6.
11:30 - 6 is at first index 0 and 1. so from 6
11:34 - it will print till another 6 the last
11:37 - six right
11:38 - and if you give last like I am giving
11:41 - like uh here four
11:44 - is what
11:45 - will give length so it will print till
11:49 - which Index this length minus 1 4 minus
11:52 - 1 that is 3 till third index so at third
11:55 - index we have zero one two three Jenny
11:57 - so it will print only like six minus
11:59 - eight and Jenny let's see
12:03 - it's not like that first
12:06 - one is what from first index to Fourth
12:09 - index fourth index is of true but no
12:12 - the second is what second argument in
12:15 - slicing is what the length right
12:18 - and length and so index how you will
12:21 - find out in the index length minus one
12:22 - that is four minus one three till third
12:24 - index will print right and if you will
12:27 - not write anything
12:28 - in the first argument then by default it
12:31 - will start from 0th index so 12 6 minus
12:34 - 8 J
12:35 - right
12:37 - now also we have like third argument is
12:41 - steps how many steps you want to skip
12:43 - like
12:44 - first arguments are nothing by default
12:47 - it will take from starting to ending and
12:49 - it will Skip One Step
12:52 - two if you are giving like first you
12:54 - will print 12 then 1 and 2 at Second
12:57 - Step you have minus eight so it will
12:58 - skip six and minus eight would be
13:00 - printed so see 12 minus 8 then Jenny
13:03 - would be skipped true then again 12
13:05 - would be skipped 6 it will print
13:08 - see the slicing we have discussed in
13:10 - detail well while you're discussing list
13:12 - so you can go to that video also and you
13:14 - can try out slicing in tapas and if you
13:17 - want to find out the length there is an
13:19 - inbuilt function you can just simply use
13:22 - this function Len and the name of the
13:25 - Tuple that is Tuple one
13:27 - so let me just run this and it will show
13:29 - you seven one two three four five six
13:32 - seven because we have seven items so
13:33 - this is what length right nesting of
13:36 - tuples also possible suppose we have
13:38 - like these two tuples 45 and I have like
13:42 - 67 90 right and I have double three
13:49 - Interpol 3 my items are
13:53 - double one comma
13:55 - double two so this is what
13:58 - equal to sorry this is what nesting of
14:01 - tuples because nesting means Tuple
14:04 - inside a tuple
14:06 - right so in this double we have again
14:08 - two tuples
14:09 - so if you will print here like this
14:13 - Triple Three
14:18 - so what it will give the output C
14:22 - two brackets in starting we have two
14:25 - round brackets first is for Tuple three
14:28 - right and another is what because we
14:31 - have Tuple one this complete is Tuple
14:34 - one in these round brackets the second
14:36 - item is double two in round bracket so
14:39 - this is what nested nesting of tuples
14:41 - nested Tupper this double three is what
14:43 - nested double now see if I'll print the
14:47 - Tuple to index one
14:51 - so what it will print
14:55 - try this out let's run this
14:57 - because here double three we have this
15:00 - double is
15:02 - at zeroth index and this double 2 is at
15:04 - one index so complete Tuple two would be
15:07 - printed because this complete is
15:09 - INTERPOL 2 we have only two items double
15:12 - one Tuple two so it will print
15:14 - the complete Tuple too
15:16 - as you can see right
15:19 - and if you want to find out the length
15:21 - of this
15:22 - double three
15:24 - then what you will get
15:28 - length is what
15:30 - only 2 C
15:33 - 2 because here we have only two item
15:35 - triple one Tuple two
15:37 - individual will not like like count one
15:41 - two three four five six seven eight nine
15:43 - ten no this complete Tuple one is one
15:46 - item only so one and two
15:48 - right this is nesting of Tuple but if
15:51 - you do something like this
15:53 - if I am doing right
15:56 - let's do this here only Plus
16:00 - couple
16:02 - two
16:03 - rather than this bracket we are just
16:06 - concatenating here
16:08 - right
16:10 - in double three double one plus double
16:12 - two so this is concatenation of tuples
16:14 - and this time if you print length of
16:16 - Tuple three this will be different see
16:20 - this time it is 10.
16:23 - right Complete because we have
16:25 - concatenated C
16:28 - you'll get it better if you paint Apple
16:30 - 3 at this time see now the items
16:33 - only one brackets in the starting one
16:36 - bracket at the end and these complete
16:38 - are these two items has these two tuples
16:41 - has been concatenated all the items has
16:42 - been concatenated these are not separate
16:44 - double one and double two that is why it
16:46 - is giving you length is 10.
16:49 - I hope you got this
16:51 - now next is we have also like Min and
16:55 - Max function like if you want to find
16:58 - out minimum from suppose uh triple one
17:03 - so just use Min and the name of the
17:05 - Tupper like double one from Tuple one I
17:06 - want to find out minimum okay
17:10 - let's see it will work or not let's run
17:12 - this see it will not work here because
17:15 - this less than node supported between
17:17 - instance of Str and Interpol one we have
17:20 - this mixed Apple
17:21 - string also and integer also so we
17:24 - cannot apply this minimum function we
17:26 - cannot compare like integer and string
17:28 - we cannot compare like 12 with Jenny or
17:33 - 12 with true
17:34 - right so this one will take care if you
17:37 - have a mix kind of Tuple like that is
17:40 - having mixed hair type then these
17:42 - functions like minimum maximum that
17:44 - would not be supported here okay now
17:47 - okay double two we'll apply this
17:50 - function Tuple 2 we have only into
17:52 - values so let's run this and the minimum
17:55 - is 45 if you want to find out MX then
17:58 - simply Max double 2 and let's run this
18:02 - it will give you 90 right and one more
18:05 - thing if you want to find out like uh
18:09 - the count function we can use
18:16 - so simply what you can use that count
18:19 - function
18:20 - like suppose in Tuple one
18:23 - I want to find out
18:27 - the occurrence of 12 this item
18:30 - occurrence of 12 is 2 times so let's run
18:32 - this it will give you two right
18:35 - this is how you can use count function
18:37 - the table name dot count and in bracket
18:40 - the item for which you want to find out
18:43 - how many times that I item is there in
18:44 - that Tuple right so index if you want to
18:47 - use then simply you can use here other
18:50 - than this index and it will give you
18:52 - index of this
18:54 - this item 12. but here it will give you
18:58 - see it will search and at first only it
19:01 - will
19:03 - find out 12 so it will give you 0 it
19:05 - will not search further but we have one
19:07 - more 12 also so that is a drawback okay
19:10 - now next is yeah you can convert a list
19:13 - to a tuple suppose I have a list
19:16 - like list one and I have in this list I
19:19 - have like 1 comma 2 comma three and four
19:21 - five something like this and I want to
19:23 - convert this list into a tuple so simply
19:25 - what we can do
19:27 - the stuple
19:29 - function in bracket
19:31 - list name of the list list one that's it
19:35 - so let's run this
19:37 - see now one two three five this is what
19:40 - a tuple how you can say that because
19:43 - rather than square bracket we have now
19:45 - round brackets
19:47 - and in Tuple we have round bracket in
19:49 - list we have square brackets so this is
19:52 - how you can convert a list into Tuple
19:53 - and like if you have something like this
19:56 - I have a rather let's remove this I have
20:00 - a tuple Tuple five and
20:04 - suppose I have here
20:06 - 10.
20:09 - one item right so you can multiply this
20:13 - I want to
20:14 - you know show this item five times so
20:17 - into five
20:18 - let's print
20:21 - this only this
20:24 - double five
20:26 - and let's run this
20:29 - see
20:31 - 10 is 5 times so into five that is also
20:33 - supported here all right rather than 10
20:36 - we can use a string also like Jenny into
20:38 - five so it will print any five times so
20:40 - this is what some Basics about tuples in
20:42 - Python so I hope you go to what are
20:44 - tuples in Python and how to use this
20:45 - thing in program right different
20:47 - different functions and build function
20:49 - on tuples and all so in the next video
20:51 - we'll see set in Python so now we'll
20:53 - show you in the next video till then bye
20:54 - take care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have implemented a game that that was our first project in the series right rock paper scissors so I hope you wrote that game and you have implemented that successfully right now in the next in this video we will be talking about what are tuples in Python till now we have discussed less than python list basically used to store what uh multiple items in a single variable right it's a sequence dated I in Python right same at tuples like list tuples are also used to store multiple items multiple sorry values multiple items in a single variable name right but these are having some differences with list so how does Tuple you know tuples are different from list right that will talk about this video right how to like different different functions that we can or you can say in inbuilt function that we can Implement on tuples how to use tuples in a program right the syntax and all you'll be discussing with the help of program practical also I will show you right so now I told you tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variables if you want to store a single data then we simply create a variable you know like or any variable name I'm taking a a is equal to 10. means one value we can store in single variable but I want to store multiple values 10 20 30 like this so you have to create multiple variables for that because one variable can store only one value if you want to store five value you have to get five variables but that is not a good idea if you want to store 10 values 15 values 100 values right same as we can we have discussed like in C and C plus plus in other languages we have arrays right homogeneous a collection of data same here we have like list also can store multiple values in a single variable doubles also you can store multiple items in a single variable right same set and dictionaries though that also will be discussing in later videos right these four are inbuilt data types that are used to store sequence of you know items you can say used to store collections of data right so now how we can what is the syntax how you can define a double right simply you will write the Tuple name I am taking like Apple One equal to the list of items you want to store but that list sorry the the items you want to store but this would be round brackets in list we use square brackets these brackets right this is the first difference so here we can store like 10 1 minus 10 15 20. so this is what at about simple not integer you can store like this string also this is also a double string so this items can be of any error type and a mixed is also possible like we have a tuple three so here we can have like integer we can have string in the same Tuple we can have like Boolean we can have like float so mix data type in the same Tuple is also possible same as list right that is possible this is valid this is valid this is also valid now if you if you create one thing if you want to create a tuple double four with only one value one value but this is not correct the necessary condition is you have to put coma after this item if you do not put this comma this the python will not recognize it as a tuple right if I'm Apple 5 is equal to 10 so these are two tuples and suppose if you want to find out the type of any data so simply we use that I function so if I write here type and here I am writing Tuple 4 and one thing type and apple Phi so obviously like this is what end if you want to find out the type of this this is end this will give you Str this will give you Boolean this will give you a float same the Tuple is what the type is what it will give the data type double but it will give only integer because this will not recognize it as a tuple this will take is at a as an integer only so you have to put comma after the single item if you want to create a tuple with single item right how to access with index indexing like index is 0 1 2 3 4 same as list negative index also possible minus 1 minus 2 minus three something like this slicing is also possible some functions are there you can find out length of a tuple you can concatenate two tuples right what you can do and your nesting of tuples are also possible you can use count function index function on tuples right so all these things will be discussing practically I hope now some query part what is double how to define a double that is clear to you guys right now let's see with the help of program I'll show you all the functions on the troubles how you can use this thing in your program okay so let's create a new project here a new file underscore python.py right and here we'll just create it upper like okay how to create the name of the stuple these brackets round brackets and whatever value you want to store like I want to store 12 then 6 then minus 8 then Jenny then like true so if you want to check out if this Tuple has been created then simply you can print and that couple name double one and we can simply run this and I'll show you see it will show you the this double right now indexing is also possible see I am going to tell you all the properties of Tuple right now so you can write down like indexing is also possible I want to access first only uh you can say the second element six here so what is the index index start from 0 0 1 so index 4 6 is 1 simply here but indexing in indexing we will use these square brackets only not round brackets while creating Tuple rather than square bracket we use these round brackets not square brackets square brackets used when we creating lists but while accessing if you want to give the index number that obviously that will be given in square brackets so Tuple and one now it will give you six the output would be 6 at this time C okay so indexing is also possible negative indexing is possible now I want minus like minus 2. so what it will give it will give you Jane C it will give you Journey negative indexing start from minus one minus one minus two minus three because it's not like minus zero minus zero is nothing it's only zero so and if I will write something like this minus 6. so obviously there is no minus 6 index so double index out of range right and if I write same like if I write 7 so this is also out of index because double index out of range 0 1 2 3 4 only 4 if you will if you you will give you here five that also will give you index out of Ranger so indexing is possible now next thing if you want to find out the type I have told you like in that while we were discussing the query so we simply use that type function type and in bracket simply write the name of the Tuple so now it will give you what see the class is what Tuple right now if you want to create let me show you Triple Two one Tuple with one item and I write only 45 right so let's check out the type of this double Tuple two type Tuple two maybe you are thinking it's Tuple so it should give you the type is Tuple but it will give you end C because it python will not recognize it as double so you have to put a comma here right one item then comma yeah this time it would be considered as double right yeah one thing tuples are immutable means unchangeable let's start mutable you can add you can change the data you can remove the data after you have created the list but once you created a tuple double one double one you cannot add any data you cannot change the data you cannot remove the data so tuples are immutable means unchangeable right let me show you if I write if I want to change double like Tuple one and at zeroth index now I have 12 but I want here rather than 12 it should be 13. right and then simply I want to print node type I want to print only Tuple one right now let's comment out this double too okay let's run this see it will give you error type error this Tuple object this double object does not support item assignment you cannot change the value assignment is not possible you cannot add any value you cannot remove like delete function is also not here right like not not working here right so tuples are immutable that makes it makes it different from list so if you want that you want only five items and you will not you don't want to change these items further so you can use double right so this would be the iteration would be fast right because of this unchangeable behavior of tuples so it will increase the speed of execution speed of your program okay now next is what okay these items are ordered so they have a defined order and you cannot change the order right now next property is what okay duplicate items are also allowed like Interpol I am again writing 12 I'm writing 6 again so see 12 12 6 6 duplicate items are there so that are allowed let's print double one see duplicate items are from insects duplicates items are not allowed right next is we'll see Tuple slicing is also possible like in string and list also slicing is possible like if I want to access the apple one and I will give like from first index to I'm not giving anything so first index to by default it will take from the last till the last so what it will print 6. 6 is at first index 0 and 1. so from 6 it will print till another 6 the last six right and if you give last like I am giving like uh here four is what will give length so it will print till which Index this length minus 1 4 minus 1 that is 3 till third index so at third index we have zero one two three Jenny so it will print only like six minus eight and Jenny let's see it's not like that first one is what from first index to Fourth index fourth index is of true but no the second is what second argument in slicing is what the length right and length and so index how you will find out in the index length minus one that is four minus one three till third index will print right and if you will not write anything in the first argument then by default it will start from 0th index so 12 6 minus 8 J right now also we have like third argument is steps how many steps you want to skip like first arguments are nothing by default it will take from starting to ending and it will Skip One Step two if you are giving like first you will print 12 then 1 and 2 at Second Step you have minus eight so it will skip six and minus eight would be printed so see 12 minus 8 then Jenny would be skipped true then again 12 would be skipped 6 it will print see the slicing we have discussed in detail well while you're discussing list so you can go to that video also and you can try out slicing in tapas and if you want to find out the length there is an inbuilt function you can just simply use this function Len and the name of the Tuple that is Tuple one so let me just run this and it will show you seven one two three four five six seven because we have seven items so this is what length right nesting of tuples also possible suppose we have like these two tuples 45 and I have like 67 90 right and I have double three Interpol 3 my items are double one comma double two so this is what equal to sorry this is what nesting of tuples because nesting means Tuple inside a tuple right so in this double we have again two tuples so if you will print here like this Triple Three so what it will give the output C two brackets in starting we have two round brackets first is for Tuple three right and another is what because we have Tuple one this complete is Tuple one in these round brackets the second item is double two in round bracket so this is what nested nesting of tuples nested Tupper this double three is what nested double now see if I'll print the Tuple to index one so what it will print try this out let's run this because here double three we have this double is at zeroth index and this double 2 is at one index so complete Tuple two would be printed because this complete is INTERPOL 2 we have only two items double one Tuple two so it will print the complete Tuple too as you can see right and if you want to find out the length of this double three then what you will get length is what only 2 C 2 because here we have only two item triple one Tuple two individual will not like like count one two three four five six seven eight nine ten no this complete Tuple one is one item only so one and two right this is nesting of Tuple but if you do something like this if I am doing right let's do this here only Plus couple two rather than this bracket we are just concatenating here right in double three double one plus double two so this is concatenation of tuples and this time if you print length of Tuple three this will be different see this time it is 10. right Complete because we have concatenated C you'll get it better if you paint Apple 3 at this time see now the items only one brackets in the starting one bracket at the end and these complete are these two items has these two tuples has been concatenated all the items has been concatenated these are not separate double one and double two that is why it is giving you length is 10. I hope you got this now next is we have also like Min and Max function like if you want to find out minimum from suppose uh triple one so just use Min and the name of the Tupper like double one from Tuple one I want to find out minimum okay let's see it will work or not let's run this see it will not work here because this less than node supported between instance of Str and Interpol one we have this mixed Apple string also and integer also so we cannot apply this minimum function we cannot compare like integer and string we cannot compare like 12 with Jenny or 12 with true right so this one will take care if you have a mix kind of Tuple like that is having mixed hair type then these functions like minimum maximum that would not be supported here okay now okay double two we'll apply this function Tuple 2 we have only into values so let's run this and the minimum is 45 if you want to find out MX then simply Max double 2 and let's run this it will give you 90 right and one more thing if you want to find out like uh the count function we can use so simply what you can use that count function like suppose in Tuple one I want to find out the occurrence of 12 this item occurrence of 12 is 2 times so let's run this it will give you two right this is how you can use count function the table name dot count and in bracket the item for which you want to find out how many times that I item is there in that Tuple right so index if you want to use then simply you can use here other than this index and it will give you index of this this item 12. but here it will give you see it will search and at first only it will find out 12 so it will give you 0 it will not search further but we have one more 12 also so that is a drawback okay now next is yeah you can convert a list to a tuple suppose I have a list like list one and I have in this list I have like 1 comma 2 comma three and four five something like this and I want to convert this list into a tuple so simply what we can do the stuple function in bracket list name of the list list one that's it so let's run this see now one two three five this is what a tuple how you can say that because rather than square bracket we have now round brackets and in Tuple we have round bracket in list we have square brackets so this is how you can convert a list into Tuple and like if you have something like this I have a rather let's remove this I have a tuple Tuple five and suppose I have here 10. one item right so you can multiply this I want to you know show this item five times so into five let's print this only this double five and let's run this see 10 is 5 times so into five that is also supported here all right rather than 10 we can use a string also like Jenny into five so it will print any five times so this is what some Basics about tuples in Python so I hope you go to what are tuples in Python and how to use this thing in program right different different functions and build function on tuples and all so in the next video we'll see set in Python so now we'll show you in the next video till then bye take care
