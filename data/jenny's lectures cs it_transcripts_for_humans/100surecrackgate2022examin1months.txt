04:19 - haven't read that concept or maybe you
04:21 - have read that concept but you forgot it
04:23 - so go through your notes and revise that
04:24 - concept right or maybe it's calculation
04:27 - error or maybe because of the virtual
04:28 - calculator the numerical questions you
04:31 - are not habitual of using virtual
04:32 - calculator so because of that you are
04:34 - doing mistake so rectify your mistakes
04:37 - and work on those mistakes
04:39 - yeah you can make mistakes while
04:41 - attempting question in test series but
04:44 - you cannot afford to make the same
04:46 - mistake again
04:47 - while writing the gate exam on your
04:49 - d-day that will cost you right so better
04:52 - to rectify your mistake in this test
04:54 - series work on those mistakes and try to
04:57 - improve yourself so analysis is very
05:00 - important right
05:01 - next thing is virtual calculator
05:05 - try to solve questions while attempting
05:07 - the test series in this try to solve
05:09 - questions
05:10 - using virtual calculator right
05:13 - because once you do this you will be
05:15 - familiar with this you know you know
05:17 - using of this virtual calculator and it
05:19 - will improve your speed
05:21 - so better to use virtual calculator for
05:23 - solving questions in this test series
05:26 - right mock test smoke test right because
05:29 - directly if you will use this calculator
05:31 - on your exam day definitely it will slow
05:34 - down your speed because you are not
05:36 - habitual of using this calculator right
05:38 - so don't use any physical calculator use
05:40 - virtual calculator right and right now i
05:44 - recommend please avoid
05:46 - going for any new subject or any new
05:48 - topic
05:49 - see
05:50 - maybe you have you have just started
05:51 - your preparation like three to four
05:53 - months ago and you still left with few
05:55 - you know subjects in which you are good
05:58 - right
05:59 - so you can go for those subjects and
06:01 - means you have just you know 15 to for
06:03 - 10 to 15 days and after 10 to 15 days
06:06 - for 15 to 20 days you can revise and you
06:08 - can go for test series
06:10 - but
06:10 - you know if you have done the important
06:12 - subjects like ft is very important you
06:15 - have done ft you have done that
06:18 - mathematics
06:19 - and three or four subject like data
06:20 - structure and programming which is very
06:22 - important
06:25 - toc
06:27 - dbms
06:29 - i think these subjects
06:31 - it's not they they'll they'll not ask a
06:33 - very you know tough question from these
06:35 - subjects so you should go for these
06:37 - subject first thoroughly
06:39 - you know these subjects should be very
06:41 - very very strong because from ft you
06:42 - will get 15 marks from maths also i
06:44 - think 14 to 15 marks from dsn
06:47 - programming also you will get i guess
06:49 - seven to ten marks from toc also i guess
06:51 - eight to ten marks i guess from this you
06:54 - will get 10 10 to 12 marks
06:56 - right and dbms also you will get seven
06:58 - to eight marks
06:59 - so if you are very very good in these
07:01 - subjects you can easily score 50 marks
07:05 - so see i would recommend go for those
07:07 - subjects which are
07:08 - having higher weightage and you are good
07:11 - in those subject
07:12 - so go for those subjects rather than
07:14 - preparing all the subjects right
07:18 - and especially right now because you
07:19 - don't have much time so rather than
07:20 - starting a new subject revise these
07:23 - subject previous
07:24 - subjects whatever you have prepared
07:26 - right division is very very very
07:28 - important so don't go for any new
07:29 - subject right now right
07:32 - and please don't
07:34 - avoid ft section
07:38 - still you have time
07:40 - if you have you know you haven't
07:41 - prepared every section and many students
07:43 - do this mistake they think that empty
07:45 - no they they more focus on the four
07:47 - subjects yeah it's good to focus on the
07:49 - course subjects but rather than you know
07:50 - attempting reading you know studying all
07:53 - the core subjects better to choose three
07:55 - four five that's it in which you are
07:57 - good
07:58 - you know and having those subjects are
08:00 - having higher weight is strong you know
08:02 - strongly or you can say thoroughly
08:05 - prepare those subject you have to be
08:07 - very strong in the these subjects
08:09 - plus empty
08:10 - focus on ft and maths
08:12 - ft is a deciding factor right for your
08:15 - gate rank and many students
08:17 - underestimate the power of ft please
08:19 - don't do this thing
08:21 - hardly you will take 10 to 15 days to
08:22 - prepare ft
08:24 - not for the complete day for three to
08:26 - four hours you can just in a day you can
08:28 - give the send
08:29 - you can just solve you know just solve
08:31 - the previous year questions five year
08:32 - previous question on this empty and
08:35 - that's it
08:36 - right
08:37 - so please don't avoid this aptitude
08:39 - section
08:40 - right
08:41 - next things
08:42 - please don't panic
08:44 - calm yourself down right now
08:47 - yeah i know you have pressure like you
08:48 - know please don't over think
08:51 - many student
08:52 - you know sit and they think what if i'm
08:54 - not able to pass the gate examination
08:56 - what if i'm not able to get good rank
08:58 - what will happen see it just it's just
09:00 - an exam you can reappear next time or if
09:04 - you have prepared well maybe you are not
09:05 - getting good rank it's okay you have
09:07 - many more opportunities also you can
09:09 - create many more exams also
09:11 - right
09:12 - it's okay

10:49 - kilometer to the north and then 20

they'll not ask a very you know tough question from these subjects so you should go for these subject first thoroughly you know these subjects should be very very very strong because from ft you will get 15 marks from maths also i think 14 to 15 marks from dsn programming also you will get i guess seven to ten marks from toc also i guess eight to ten marks i guess from this you will get 10 10 to 12 marks right and dbms also you will get seven to eight marks so if you are very very good in these subjects you can easily score 50 marks so see i would recommend go for those subjects which are having higher weightage and you are good in those subject so go for those subjects rather than preparing all the subjects right and especially right now because you don't have much time so rather than
