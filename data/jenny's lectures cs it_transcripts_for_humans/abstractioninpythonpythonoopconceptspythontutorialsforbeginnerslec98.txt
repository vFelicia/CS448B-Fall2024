00:00 - hey everyone I hope you all are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:03 - Python programming language we are
00:04 - discussing poops Concept in Python till
00:07 - now we have discussed inheritance right
00:09 - now the remaining are basically and we
00:11 - have discussed classes and objects as
00:13 - well the remaining are abstraction
00:14 - encapsulation and polymorphism
00:17 - right although in the previous video we
00:19 - have seen about you know some modules
00:22 - what are what is a module and why we are
00:24 - going to use module in your program
00:25 - right with the help of a project that is
00:28 - quiz game right but now
00:32 - from this video we are going to start
00:33 - again the oops concept the next is
00:35 - abstraction inheritance we have
00:37 - discussed now we will discussing in this
00:39 - video abstraction
00:40 - it is one of the most important you can
00:42 - see Hoops concept for the pillar of
00:44 - object-oriented programming right and
00:47 - the most confusing topic I guess
00:50 - students generally confused and
00:52 - obstruction and encapsulation right so
00:55 - I'll try my best to you know discuss
00:58 - abstraction in detail right in a clear
01:01 - way
01:03 - fine so we'll just discuss what is
01:05 - abstraction in this video fine see now
01:09 - I don't know maybe you are watching this
01:11 - video on your laptop or on your mobile
01:14 - phone right now how you search for this
01:17 - video you just open maybe the YouTube
01:20 - then you search like maybe what is
01:23 - obstruction in Python and there are many
01:25 - videos in front of you just click on one
01:27 - video and that video will be played on
01:29 - your screen right that is all you know
01:32 - but you don't know what is going on
01:35 - behind the scene
01:38 - how we are going to make you know how we
01:40 - are going to a
01:41 - how you are able to type like the
01:44 - alphabets like and how these alphabets
01:47 - have to be shown on your screen on the
01:49 - search bar like what is w h a t what is
01:53 - abstraction you are typing with a
01:55 - keyboard or your keypad and these
01:56 - alphabets are shown in the search bar
01:58 - when you click on the search then you
02:00 - will get the you're getting the results
02:02 - of these videos right abstraction videos
02:05 - I don't know how this is going to be
02:08 - happening behind the scene from where
02:10 - you are getting this video obviously
02:11 - when someone is uploading the video then
02:13 - that video would be stored somewhere in
02:15 - a database on server and from those
02:17 - servers you are connecting you're going
02:20 - to connect your PC or your laptop or
02:22 - your mobile phone to that server and
02:24 - from that server you are fetching that
02:26 - video
02:27 - right and that is being displayed on
02:29 - your screen
02:30 - you don't know with the help of which
02:32 - protocol maybe HTTP or FTP or I don't
02:34 - know any other protocol
02:36 - right
02:38 - you just
02:39 - know you're just typing with the help of
02:43 - keypad or keyboard and just click on the
02:45 - search button and video is the search
02:48 - result are on your screen and when you
02:50 - click on that video it would be just
02:52 - played on your screen that's it you
02:55 - don't know the internal working how you
02:57 - are getting that video in your phone on
02:59 - your PC on your laptop
03:02 - right
03:04 - so that is what an abstraction you're
03:07 - not able to see the internal
03:09 - implementation or internal details or in
03:11 - the internal working or the behind the
03:13 - scene working you just see the results
03:15 - that's it
03:17 - and which actually matters to us the
03:19 - result only we are not you know
03:21 - concerned about the internal working
03:24 - maybe few of you are concerned about
03:26 - that thing but many of us are not
03:29 - concerned about the how this is going to
03:30 - be working we just concern about the
03:33 - results that's it abstraction in a
03:35 - similar way just show the
03:37 - functionalities anything holds
03:41 - hiding the internal detail or the
03:43 - implementation detail that has not you
03:46 - can say necessary to know to the user
03:50 - simply that is obstruction everywhere we
03:53 - see abstraction like we are
03:56 - example of abstraction like our skin
03:58 - this layer is an abstraction
04:00 - Under the Skin we have like vein how the
04:03 - blood is going to flow the muscles and
04:04 - everything we do not know anything
04:07 - how the lungs are working how the lungs
04:08 - are working how the heart is working and
04:10 - we don't know anything
04:12 - right
04:13 - so the skin is a layer of abstraction
04:15 - for us
04:16 - the internal detail is hidden
04:19 - we just know the functionality is what a
04:21 - person can do what we can do we can see
04:23 - we can write we can walk we can sleep we
04:25 - can eat but how
04:28 - like how we are going to you know hold
04:32 - that marker maybe when I'm holding this
04:34 - marker I'm writing something like this
04:37 - thing then some signal is
04:40 - passing through some veins or I don't
04:43 - know arteries to my brain and then my
04:46 - brain is going to instruct my hand or
04:48 - something like this but that process we
04:50 - don't know how this is going to happen
04:51 - we just know the functionalities that we
04:54 - can write we can walk we can talk we can
04:57 - like eat sleep see or this kind of thing
05:01 - right so this is not abstraction so
05:04 - everything in real world is also having
05:06 - some kind of obstruction and their level
05:08 - of obstruction like higher level higher
05:10 - level of obstruction lower level of
05:11 - obstruction like this levels of
05:13 - abstraction when you go to the higher
05:15 - level of obstruction then you
05:17 - concern about the
05:19 - larger piece of data not the much
05:23 - detailed things
05:25 - right like if I ask just give me the
05:28 - highlights if someone say just give me
05:30 - the highlights or just give me the
05:31 - minutes of the meeting or just give me
05:33 - the facts please means I'm just
05:35 - interested in an abstraction these are
05:40 - the subsection
05:42 - an abstracted way of information I am
05:44 - not asking for the detailed information
05:47 - just the highlights just the facts just
05:50 - the minutes of meetings
05:53 - maybe the meeting is for one hour but
05:55 - there are five topics mainly topics that
05:59 - has been discussed in that meeting
06:00 - because I just want to you know I just
06:03 - want to ask those five topics
06:06 - not what has been discussed under these
06:09 - topics in that one hour session
06:12 - just give me those Five Points that's it
06:15 - so this is what abstraction you are
06:16 - asking for abstractions
06:18 - if you have seen the research paper then
06:20 - at first in the search where we are
06:22 - having abstract means
06:25 - that is going to tell you that paragraph
06:27 - is going to tell you an abstraction like
06:30 - what is going to be in this research
06:32 - paper just the main ideas or the main
06:35 - thing what they are going to discuss in
06:37 - this research paper what do this
06:39 - research paper is all about
06:41 - right so that is abstraction
06:44 - I hope you got this so
06:46 - you you're you know you get this type of
06:50 - uh you can say definition everywhere
06:52 - like abstraction is a process of hiding
06:54 - the implementation detail from the user
06:57 - right or the unnecessary detail from the
07:00 - user or the extra detail from the user
07:02 - the internal detail from the user only
07:04 - showing the essential features to the
07:07 - user that's it that is abstraction
07:09 - like that is one you can see definition
07:11 - of abstraction
07:12 - right or we can say like
07:14 - abstraction is also
07:17 - generalization or generalizing something
07:19 - to hide the complex logic
07:23 - right generalization means like we a
07:26 - human being
07:28 - we are able to eat or we are able to we
07:31 - can sleep we can eat we have like two
07:34 - hands two legs
07:36 - so whether it's a male or a female or a
07:38 - child or a you can say a senior citizen
07:41 - or
07:42 - maybe we can say it's a student or an
07:45 - employee
07:46 - everyone is having like obviously two
07:49 - hands two legs everyone can eat everyone
07:52 - can see
07:53 - so these are generalization or these are
07:56 - you can say uh generalized things that
08:01 - he or she can do animal or female or
08:04 - child or senior citizen can do right
08:07 - so in programming also if you want to
08:10 - represent this kind of thing then we can
08:13 - make a class
08:15 - person
08:18 - and here in this
08:21 - we can
08:22 - abstraction
08:24 - we can you know achieve abstraction with
08:27 - the help of abstract classes and
08:28 - Abstract methods
08:30 - right what are upset classes and methods
08:33 - and how we are going to watch your
08:34 - obsession that we'll see in next video
08:35 - but here
08:44 - and every other class which is going to
08:47 - inherit this class
08:48 - definitely obviously or like some
08:51 - functions like eat sleep
08:55 - will have these functions like eat and
08:58 - sleep but maybe they have their own
09:00 - definition of these functions
09:02 - heat it is what may be eating habit or
09:06 - eating process of every person is
09:08 - different like I want to I would like to
09:11 - eat with knives or that fork and spoons
09:15 - Maybe
09:17 - someone is interested in just eating
09:19 - with hands only that is also fine so
09:22 - everyone is having their own process of
09:24 - eating but eat
09:26 - that is
09:29 - for sure that is for everything that is
09:32 - a you can say generalized thing
09:34 - for every person or every human being
09:37 - right like let's take one more example
09:40 - uh if you are going to uh
09:44 - make any app develop any app so every
09:47 - app is going to have some you can say
09:50 - General features like the brightness
09:52 - feature or the every app is going to
09:54 - send notification right those features
09:58 - every app any app in your phone you have
10:02 - you can learn the brightness feature or
10:05 - you can see that notification feature
10:06 - right
10:08 - so that is what generalized thing
10:12 - so if I'm going to make my app like for
10:14 - Jenny's lectures obviously that also
10:17 - have that send notification feature
10:18 - right if you are developing any other
10:22 - app maybe like uh related to any image
10:25 - or you can say upgrade your image or
10:28 - edit image these kind of things like
10:30 - Picasa and anything those will also have
10:33 - that feature
10:35 - that notification feature send
10:37 - notification and all
10:38 - right
10:40 - so this is what this we can achieve with
10:43 - the help of abstract classes right but
10:46 - the how we are going to achieve that
10:48 - thing that I'll show you in the next
10:49 - video just the ways I just want to tell
10:52 - you abstraction we can also say in
10:53 - another term like it is generalizing
10:56 - things or we can say abstraction as a
10:59 - process of generalizing in something
11:01 - just to hide the complex detail now
11:06 - how to hide those details abstraction is
11:10 - just a thought process
11:12 - it works at design level design level
11:15 - not at actual implementation level that
11:17 - coding level no
11:19 - so we can say it's just a process of
11:22 - identifying which features are to be
11:25 - hidden from the user and which features
11:27 - are to be shown to the user you just
11:30 - have to identify
11:32 - but actual how we are going to hide that
11:34 - is a different thing with the help of
11:36 - encapsulation we will do that that thing
11:38 - right
11:40 - so actual you are when you are going to
11:43 - hide that is a different concept concept
11:45 - but in abstraction you just have to
11:47 - identify what you need to hide from the
11:49 - user and what you need to show to the
11:51 - user
11:52 - right if you are working on a project or
11:55 - any app or something like this and you
11:57 - have to add
11:58 - like student name and data roll number
12:04 - right so this is some kind of interface
12:07 - would be shown like student name
12:09 - like I'm having I'm just working on any
12:12 - project like maybe student management
12:13 - system so I have to add student detail
12:16 - so
12:17 - I'll just show student name would be
12:21 - entered would be entered I just have to
12:23 - click on the add button and in the
12:24 - database that student would be added
12:27 - right
12:28 - now that's it this is the interface that
12:32 - would be shown to the student or to me
12:35 - or the user who is going to use the
12:37 - student management system this project
12:40 - right now add means obviously when you
12:43 - are going to click on ADD then we will
12:46 - check like maybe in student name you
12:48 - will enter one two three in roll number
12:49 - you I I'm going to enter enter Jenny so
12:52 - this is not valid now
12:54 - student name should be Jenny and roll
12:56 - number
12:57 - should be one to throw this kind of
13:00 - thing right obviously
13:02 - anyone can tell that this is invalid
13:04 - cannot be like Jenny it can be like
13:08 - Journey one two three it can be
13:09 - combination of like alphabet and uh
13:12 - those
13:14 - digits but only letters or only alphabet
13:17 - that is not allowed in roll number right
13:19 - so obviously when you are going to add
13:20 - then
13:22 - validate or you have to check if the
13:26 - entry is correct or not according to the
13:27 - rules are or not right and then
13:32 - create a database object and then add to
13:35 - this database but this validate and
13:38 - create a DB object
13:41 - that would be obviously hidden from the
13:43 - user right we are not going to show in
13:45 - the interface like validate
13:47 - and
13:49 - like create a DB connection
13:53 - right and you have to enter you have to
13:55 - click on validate as well as well as
13:57 - create DB and then you'll have to add
13:59 - and you have to click on the set then
14:01 - that student would be added to the snow
14:05 - this simple interface would be shown to
14:07 - the user because these are extra details
14:09 - these are internal details so these
14:11 - should be hidden from the user right we
14:14 - have identified these
14:16 - two functions should be hidden from the
14:18 - user right so these are hidden from the
14:20 - user and only the essential information
14:23 - to be shown to the user is just the add
14:25 - button right so this is what abstraction
14:29 - right
14:30 - now how we are going to hide these
14:32 - things that comes under encapsulation we
14:35 - have some like those public private
14:37 - access specifier with the help of those
14:39 - we can hide the information of the data
14:43 - right
14:44 - right so I hope you got what is
14:47 - abstraction
14:48 - right just a thought process it works at
14:50 - design level right it basically uh you
14:54 - know concern about the external Lookout
14:56 - the interface the external look
15:00 - right that is abstraction
15:03 - so every big project or software
15:07 - definitely going to obviously Implement
15:10 - these features obstruction definitely
15:12 - definitely
15:13 - if it is a small project then maybe
15:15 - there would be no abstraction but if it
15:17 - is a big project then definitely there
15:19 - would be abstraction that thing like the
15:22 - internal working the implementation
15:23 - detailed extra thing like this that
15:25 - would be hidden from the user and user
15:27 - will be shown like simple things the
15:30 - essential detail only would be shown to
15:32 - the user
15:33 - right
15:35 - actual hiding is to be done with the
15:37 - help of encapsulation or with the help
15:38 - of access specifier that is different
15:40 - thing abstraction is just to identify
15:42 - which
15:43 - is to be hidden and which feature of
15:46 - which detail to be shown to the user
15:47 - okay
15:49 - so I hope you got the basic idea about
15:51 - obstruction if not you can just let me
15:53 - know in comment section maybe we can
15:54 - make another video with the help of some
15:56 - different examples right
15:59 - okay now in the next video we will see
16:00 - abstract classes and Abstract methods in
16:03 - the next video bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language we are discussing poops Concept in Python till now we have discussed inheritance right now the remaining are basically and we have discussed classes and objects as well the remaining are abstraction encapsulation and polymorphism right although in the previous video we have seen about you know some modules what are what is a module and why we are going to use module in your program right with the help of a project that is quiz game right but now from this video we are going to start again the oops concept the next is abstraction inheritance we have discussed now we will discussing in this video abstraction it is one of the most important you can see Hoops concept for the pillar of objectoriented programming right and the most confusing topic I guess students generally confused and obstruction and encapsulation right so I'll try my best to you know discuss abstraction in detail right in a clear way fine so we'll just discuss what is abstraction in this video fine see now I don't know maybe you are watching this video on your laptop or on your mobile phone right now how you search for this video you just open maybe the YouTube then you search like maybe what is obstruction in Python and there are many videos in front of you just click on one video and that video will be played on your screen right that is all you know but you don't know what is going on behind the scene how we are going to make you know how we are going to a how you are able to type like the alphabets like and how these alphabets have to be shown on your screen on the search bar like what is w h a t what is abstraction you are typing with a keyboard or your keypad and these alphabets are shown in the search bar when you click on the search then you will get the you're getting the results of these videos right abstraction videos I don't know how this is going to be happening behind the scene from where you are getting this video obviously when someone is uploading the video then that video would be stored somewhere in a database on server and from those servers you are connecting you're going to connect your PC or your laptop or your mobile phone to that server and from that server you are fetching that video right and that is being displayed on your screen you don't know with the help of which protocol maybe HTTP or FTP or I don't know any other protocol right you just know you're just typing with the help of keypad or keyboard and just click on the search button and video is the search result are on your screen and when you click on that video it would be just played on your screen that's it you don't know the internal working how you are getting that video in your phone on your PC on your laptop right so that is what an abstraction you're not able to see the internal implementation or internal details or in the internal working or the behind the scene working you just see the results that's it and which actually matters to us the result only we are not you know concerned about the internal working maybe few of you are concerned about that thing but many of us are not concerned about the how this is going to be working we just concern about the results that's it abstraction in a similar way just show the functionalities anything holds hiding the internal detail or the implementation detail that has not you can say necessary to know to the user simply that is obstruction everywhere we see abstraction like we are example of abstraction like our skin this layer is an abstraction Under the Skin we have like vein how the blood is going to flow the muscles and everything we do not know anything how the lungs are working how the lungs are working how the heart is working and we don't know anything right so the skin is a layer of abstraction for us the internal detail is hidden we just know the functionality is what a person can do what we can do we can see we can write we can walk we can sleep we can eat but how like how we are going to you know hold that marker maybe when I'm holding this marker I'm writing something like this thing then some signal is passing through some veins or I don't know arteries to my brain and then my brain is going to instruct my hand or something like this but that process we don't know how this is going to happen we just know the functionalities that we can write we can walk we can talk we can like eat sleep see or this kind of thing right so this is not abstraction so everything in real world is also having some kind of obstruction and their level of obstruction like higher level higher level of obstruction lower level of obstruction like this levels of abstraction when you go to the higher level of obstruction then you concern about the larger piece of data not the much detailed things right like if I ask just give me the highlights if someone say just give me the highlights or just give me the minutes of the meeting or just give me the facts please means I'm just interested in an abstraction these are the subsection an abstracted way of information I am not asking for the detailed information just the highlights just the facts just the minutes of meetings maybe the meeting is for one hour but there are five topics mainly topics that has been discussed in that meeting because I just want to you know I just want to ask those five topics not what has been discussed under these topics in that one hour session just give me those Five Points that's it so this is what abstraction you are asking for abstractions if you have seen the research paper then at first in the search where we are having abstract means that is going to tell you that paragraph is going to tell you an abstraction like what is going to be in this research paper just the main ideas or the main thing what they are going to discuss in this research paper what do this research paper is all about right so that is abstraction I hope you got this so you you're you know you get this type of uh you can say definition everywhere like abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation detail from the user right or the unnecessary detail from the user or the extra detail from the user the internal detail from the user only showing the essential features to the user that's it that is abstraction like that is one you can see definition of abstraction right or we can say like abstraction is also generalization or generalizing something to hide the complex logic right generalization means like we a human being we are able to eat or we are able to we can sleep we can eat we have like two hands two legs so whether it's a male or a female or a child or a you can say a senior citizen or maybe we can say it's a student or an employee everyone is having like obviously two hands two legs everyone can eat everyone can see so these are generalization or these are you can say uh generalized things that he or she can do animal or female or child or senior citizen can do right so in programming also if you want to represent this kind of thing then we can make a class person and here in this we can abstraction we can you know achieve abstraction with the help of abstract classes and Abstract methods right what are upset classes and methods and how we are going to watch your obsession that we'll see in next video but here and every other class which is going to inherit this class definitely obviously or like some functions like eat sleep will have these functions like eat and sleep but maybe they have their own definition of these functions heat it is what may be eating habit or eating process of every person is different like I want to I would like to eat with knives or that fork and spoons Maybe someone is interested in just eating with hands only that is also fine so everyone is having their own process of eating but eat that is for sure that is for everything that is a you can say generalized thing for every person or every human being right like let's take one more example uh if you are going to uh make any app develop any app so every app is going to have some you can say General features like the brightness feature or the every app is going to send notification right those features every app any app in your phone you have you can learn the brightness feature or you can see that notification feature right so that is what generalized thing so if I'm going to make my app like for Jenny's lectures obviously that also have that send notification feature right if you are developing any other app maybe like uh related to any image or you can say upgrade your image or edit image these kind of things like Picasa and anything those will also have that feature that notification feature send notification and all right so this is what this we can achieve with the help of abstract classes right but the how we are going to achieve that thing that I'll show you in the next video just the ways I just want to tell you abstraction we can also say in another term like it is generalizing things or we can say abstraction as a process of generalizing in something just to hide the complex detail now how to hide those details abstraction is just a thought process it works at design level design level not at actual implementation level that coding level no so we can say it's just a process of identifying which features are to be hidden from the user and which features are to be shown to the user you just have to identify but actual how we are going to hide that is a different thing with the help of encapsulation we will do that that thing right so actual you are when you are going to hide that is a different concept concept but in abstraction you just have to identify what you need to hide from the user and what you need to show to the user right if you are working on a project or any app or something like this and you have to add like student name and data roll number right so this is some kind of interface would be shown like student name like I'm having I'm just working on any project like maybe student management system so I have to add student detail so I'll just show student name would be entered would be entered I just have to click on the add button and in the database that student would be added right now that's it this is the interface that would be shown to the student or to me or the user who is going to use the student management system this project right now add means obviously when you are going to click on ADD then we will check like maybe in student name you will enter one two three in roll number you I I'm going to enter enter Jenny so this is not valid now student name should be Jenny and roll number should be one to throw this kind of thing right obviously anyone can tell that this is invalid cannot be like Jenny it can be like Journey one two three it can be combination of like alphabet and uh those digits but only letters or only alphabet that is not allowed in roll number right so obviously when you are going to add then validate or you have to check if the entry is correct or not according to the rules are or not right and then create a database object and then add to this database but this validate and create a DB object that would be obviously hidden from the user right we are not going to show in the interface like validate and like create a DB connection right and you have to enter you have to click on validate as well as well as create DB and then you'll have to add and you have to click on the set then that student would be added to the snow this simple interface would be shown to the user because these are extra details these are internal details so these should be hidden from the user right we have identified these two functions should be hidden from the user right so these are hidden from the user and only the essential information to be shown to the user is just the add button right so this is what abstraction right now how we are going to hide these things that comes under encapsulation we have some like those public private access specifier with the help of those we can hide the information of the data right right so I hope you got what is abstraction right just a thought process it works at design level right it basically uh you know concern about the external Lookout the interface the external look right that is abstraction so every big project or software definitely going to obviously Implement these features obstruction definitely definitely if it is a small project then maybe there would be no abstraction but if it is a big project then definitely there would be abstraction that thing like the internal working the implementation detailed extra thing like this that would be hidden from the user and user will be shown like simple things the essential detail only would be shown to the user right actual hiding is to be done with the help of encapsulation or with the help of access specifier that is different thing abstraction is just to identify which is to be hidden and which feature of which detail to be shown to the user okay so I hope you got the basic idea about obstruction if not you can just let me know in comment section maybe we can make another video with the help of some different examples right okay now in the next video we will see abstract classes and Abstract methods in the next video bye take care
