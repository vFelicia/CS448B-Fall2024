00:00 - hey everyone I hope you are safe and
00:01 - doing good so in the c one C programming
00:04 - language we are discussing functions in
00:06 - C uh have discuss till now you know in
00:10 - functions introduction to functions and
00:12 - then have to first parameter in function
00:14 - like value and right a small topic that
00:18 - I was about to mention in previous video
00:20 - but I forgot that is default argument
00:23 - value default
00:25 - arguments right so it's a small topic
00:27 - but yeah it's important one so this
00:29 - thing see in this video what are default
00:31 - arguments how to fast and when to fast
00:33 - them some ADV of using default argument
00:36 - some draws with proper example I'll show
00:39 - you right so let me just tell you just
00:43 - try to relate this with a real life
00:44 - example suppose see I generally eat two
00:48 - chapati daily right so my mother know
00:51 - that I eat two chapati so she make only
00:54 - two the for daily right by default I
00:58 - don't need to tell her every day like
01:00 - I want but if someday if I'm more hungry
01:04 - and I want te then specifically I
01:07 - mentioned that
01:11 - I on that
01:14 - right so on that day that default value
01:18 - two is overwritten by the value provided
01:21 - by
01:23 - new right so this kind of thing so
01:28 - generally uh when we deal with these
01:30 - projects and programs also so generally
01:32 - most most of the time most of the
01:35 - cases values for some argument are
01:38 - soon
01:40 - right like maybe rate of
01:43 - interest 10% or any any
01:47 - of most of the time supp rate of
01:49 - interest is so you don't need to tell
01:51 - every time that 10% rate of interest 10
01:54 - you just give that default in the
01:56 - fun right or like this text when you
02:00 - Cate text and suppose in my company most
02:04 - that having 6%
02:08 - 10% 12% so by default the text rate for
02:12 - that is 12% that in that category so
02:15 - when you calculate that some for those
02:19 - by default that text
02:24 - 12 right so in those cases default
02:28 - arguments are needed you don't need to
02:30 - pass those arguments again and again
02:32 - just pass default argument but how to
02:35 - pass default argument when to pass these
02:37 - default arguments when to you know
02:39 - Define these default
02:41 - arguments right this thing we'll see in
02:43 - this video so let me just show you this
02:46 - with one example I hope you uh now know
02:49 - the difference between argument and
02:50 - paramet arguments when we call a
02:53 - function then the actual value you pass
02:54 - those are known as Al and parameters are
02:57 - those variables that we take it those
03:00 - function definition or in function
03:02 - declaration at that time those variables
03:04 - are known as parameters let me show you
03:06 - the single exam so let's cre a new file
03:10 - here so here we have let's take a simple
03:14 - uh
03:16 - example any example you can take see
03:19 - when I was uh working in that PJ then I
03:23 - I I used to teach civil and mechanical
03:25 - so in my class there were you know void
03:29 - so tech there was only one girl and
03:31 - civil there was only four or five girls
03:34 - so suppose if this is the case so I want
03:37 - to write the name of every student using
03:39 - a function then if all are boys then
03:42 - I'll pronounce like Mr Right and if
03:46 - there is a girl then miss so by default
03:48 - you can pass that prefix value Mister
03:51 - right while greeting those students let
03:53 - me show you this thing with example I
03:55 - have a function suppose
03:57 - greet and there we have
04:01 - you have to pass string name and I have
04:06 - string prefix means Mr message or doctor
04:10 - or any prefix you want to apply so
04:12 - suppose two thing I have only name and
04:14 - prefix right and this is declaration so
04:17 - you can omit this name and prefix just
04:19 - provide string and string that is also
04:21 - fine just data type right and in main
04:24 - I'm calling this greet I'm just passing
04:28 - like any name Rahul and
04:32 - uh Mr prefix is Mr Mr Rahul right and
04:37 - then just Define it so these are
04:40 - parameter here these Rahul Mis these are
04:43 - arguments and in definition or in
04:45 - declaration I'm taking name prefix name
04:48 - prefix these are variable sorry these
04:50 - are these variables these are known as
04:52 - parameters right or formal formal
04:55 - parameters and these are known as Rahul
04:56 - M these are known as arguments or actual
04:59 - parameters
05:00 - right so I'm just printing C out like
05:04 - high
05:06 - and whatever the
05:10 - prefix right and then name so either we
05:13 - can use this only and name or we can
05:17 - concatenate this concatenate with one
05:20 - space and
05:22 - concatenate plus
05:24 - name right this way is also fine if
05:28 - you're using like class
05:30 - the string so better to
05:32 - include specifically that string
05:35 - head it's always a good to use string H
05:39 - file if you're using St right now this
05:42 - in this main after successful completion
05:46 - it will return zero and this GD is
05:48 - returning nothing so the DAT type is
05:51 - return type is vo right let's R this
05:54 - here we are not using any default value
05:56 - we are providing both the values Rahul
05:58 - mister and all
06:04 - right let's run
06:09 - this so see hi Mr Rahul let me just
06:13 - decorate it a little bit with the space
06:16 - right so now if in my class I have 60
06:21 - students and all are 59 are boys and
06:23 - only one is girl so rather than passing
06:25 - every time Mr here suppose I pass uh I
06:30 - call this function again like another
06:32 - student bod and name is bod and Mister
06:37 - so same let's run this and see Mr Rahul
06:41 - Mr B so every time you are passing Mr
06:43 - right so in most of the
06:46 - cases this argument value would be Mr Mr
06:49 - Mister so rather than repeating this
06:52 - again and again just pass it as a
06:53 - default value now where to write this as
06:56 - a default value either in declaration or
06:58 - definition but but it's always a good
07:01 - practice to write to provide default
07:03 - values default argument values in
07:05 - declaration or prototype not in
07:07 - definition right you can provide it in
07:09 - definition right but in that case if
07:12 - you're providing default value in this
07:14 - function definition then function
07:15 - definition must be before function
07:19 - calling right it's always a good
07:22 - practice to I'll recommend to use this
07:25 - thing default values to provide default
07:27 - values in function prototypes so
07:29 - function this string
07:32 - prefix default value for this I am going
07:34 - to provide is equal to always
07:38 - m not always most of the time M because
07:41 - I have one girl in my class so for that
07:43 - I'll you know use a miss right so here
07:47 - no need to provide this
07:50 - argument value for this
07:53 - argument let's run this and see what
07:56 - output you same hi Mr Rahul hi Mr
08:00 - mode so we this is default
08:04 - argument so default argument is a value
08:07 - automatically assigned by the compiler
08:09 - if while calling the function you don't
08:12 - provide any value for that argument for
08:15 - this we are not providing any value so
08:18 - it will take automatically assign this
08:21 - value to that argument right so this is
08:24 - default argument value I hope you got
08:26 - this but there are some rules
08:30 - see default if suppose suffix also you
08:32 - want to use so if I write something like
08:38 - this suffix and suffix would all be
08:41 - different every time like surname of
08:43 - each student is different most of the
08:45 - student so I cannot provide a default
08:47 - value so what do you think will it work
08:51 - suppose you think this Rahul it will
08:53 - take Mr for prefix and just provide
08:55 - suffix for Zo right but this time give
09:00 - see more than one instance of overloaded
09:03 - function we why so because while you're
09:08 - calling this function whatever you will
09:10 - pass those would be those values would
09:13 - be assigned to the parameters from left
09:15 - to right so in name in name Rahul would
09:21 - be a sign this Roy would be assign to
09:25 - prefix
09:26 - right but we have one four that is
09:30 - suffix so
09:33 - let's in definition also you have to
09:36 - change it suff after name just
09:43 - plus with space and
09:46 - plus what suffix will give that will be
09:51 - printed
09:53 - oftr
09:55 - see default argument missing for
09:57 - parameter three for parameter
10:01 - three default argument is missing
10:04 - because in this case this Rahul would be
10:08 - assigned to this name this Roy would be
10:10 - assigned to this prefix now it is
10:12 - expecting one more parameter one more
10:14 - argument for suffix and you have
10:15 - providing only
10:17 - two right so these values would be
10:21 - assigned from left to right so you
10:22 - cannot leave it like this default
10:25 - argument should always be at the
10:28 - end right if you want any default
10:31 - arguments then that will be in the end
10:34 - if you have provided here default
10:35 - argument then after that all the
10:38 - argument or all the parameter you write
10:40 - here that must be default you cannot
10:44 - take any this argument positional
10:46 - argument here
10:48 - right so for this you can fix this ofix
10:51 - is equal to just provide a space so for
10:54 - default it's space right now it will run
10:58 - same thing
10:59 - but it will give now hi Roy Rahul see
11:03 - and Mr Bol why Roy Rahul
11:07 - because I am just printing High then
11:10 - prefix and in this case prefix is Roy
11:13 - Roy and name is Rahul right and no suff
11:16 - suffix is like space on and if I call
11:20 - this for like greet and I think the name
11:23 - of that girl was shrishti and now prefix
11:27 - is Miss
11:33 - right and suffix also suppose I'll
11:37 - give I don't know her surname so let's
11:40 - use Kumari
11:42 - here
11:45 - okay let's run this and
11:48 - see hi Miss sishi Kumari Mr binod hi Roy
11:53 - Rahul so let's delete this right so
11:58 - these values default Val Val are
11:59 - overwritten here right this rather than
12:02 - this mis now for this function called
12:05 - prefixes Miss right so these are not
12:08 - constant argument because the values can
12:10 - be changed the values can be overwritten
12:11 - if you provide your specific value then
12:13 - default value would not be used right
12:15 - your special value your specific value
12:16 - you provide that would be used while
12:19 - calling right so in this case if you
12:21 - want to provide Rahul and Roy for suffix
12:24 - then you cannot provide here Rahul and
12:26 - simply Roy you have to provide Mr
12:29 - also for
12:32 - second argument and then you can write
12:35 - here like
12:38 - Roy now it will work
12:40 - fine see Mr Rahul Roy right so I hope
12:45 - you got the this uh the fun of uh
12:47 - default arguments so this question is
12:50 - for you you have to solve this what
12:52 - would be the output of uh this thing
12:54 - pause the video and try this out and uh
12:56 - write down the answer in comment section
12:58 - see here we have first of all control
13:00 - will go to the main function then we are
13:02 - calling the sum we are passing three uh
13:05 - argument one to three so before it it
13:08 - will check where it is defined but it is
13:11 - defined after that but yeah it has a
13:12 - declaration before calling so that's
13:14 - fine in declaration we have 1 2 3 three
13:18 - parameter but one is default for third
13:20 - one I'm providing value
13:22 - zero right and return type is in so now
13:26 - it will go to the definition part and x
13:28 - y z three are argument we have sorry
13:30 - three parameter we have here we have
13:31 - parameter x y z are parameters 1 2 3 are
13:34 - arguments and return X+ y + z right so
13:37 - here it will it will call the sum
13:39 - function with 1 2 three value default
13:42 - value is zero for Z but it will it will
13:45 - use three in this case in second case we
13:48 - are only providing one value some one so
13:51 - it will give error why so because one
13:55 - will give will be given to X for y we
13:57 - are not giving any value yeah for Zed we
14:00 - have default value but but for y we are
14:02 - not giving any value right so it will
14:04 - give you error to few arguments in
14:07 - function call right at least you have to
14:09 - pass two argument because one two two
14:13 - parameters are not default only one is
14:16 - default so it will give error in this
14:18 - case you have to provide at least two
14:20 - this Su three four see that will work
14:23 - fine because X would be three y would be
14:26 - four you are not giving any value for Z
14:28 - it's okay we have default value zero
14:30 - right so let's run this and see what
14:33 - output you're getting
14:35 - here okay we have Mr semicolon
14:41 - here see 6 six and seven right six six
14:46 - and seven right other than zero also you
14:49 - can take any value but after this you
14:51 - cannot take something like this or if
14:54 - you modify it a little bit for second
14:57 - argument you give default value for
14:58 - third
15:00 - not you're not giving any default value
15:02 - in that
15:05 - case let's run this and see what error
15:07 - you are
15:08 - getting default argument missing for
15:11 - parameter three in this in sum for
15:15 - parameter three for
15:17 - this so after providing the default
15:20 - argument after this if you have any
15:24 - parameter that those all the parameter
15:26 - must be default so you have to provide a
15:29 - default argument after this default
15:32 - argument can be at the end right like in
15:35 - the tail of the parameter list default
15:37 - argument should be in the tail of the
15:38 - parameter list
15:41 - right
15:43 - so just by adding any default argument
15:46 - you can just increase you can just you
15:49 - change the capab capability of the
15:51 - function right just by using a default
15:53 - argument and you have to write down less
15:55 - code right the program would be easy to
15:58 - write so it helps in reducing the size
16:00 - of the program also but execution time
16:03 - will be a little bit more because if
16:04 - you're not providing any argument value
16:07 - for this then the compiler has to copy
16:11 - that default value to this parameter
16:14 - right so execution time will be a little
16:16 - bit more right I hope you got now what
16:20 - are default argument values or default
16:22 - values these are not constant values
16:23 - because you can overwrite these default
16:26 - values and rather than in declaration we
16:28 - can have have default value here as
16:30 - well but in this case it will give error
16:34 - because if you are using this default
16:37 - value in function definition then
16:39 - function definition must be before
16:41 - function calling right you can just
16:43 - change it and you can just run the
16:44 - sensing right so that's it for this
16:46 - video now uh in the next we'll see maybe
16:49 - some coding exercises on based on
16:51 - functions right so now I'll see you in
16:53 - the next video till then bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the c one C programming language we are discussing functions in C uh have discuss till now you know in functions introduction to functions and then have to first parameter in function like value and right a small topic that I was about to mention in previous video but I forgot that is default argument value default arguments right so it's a small topic but yeah it's important one so this thing see in this video what are default arguments how to fast and when to fast them some ADV of using default argument some draws with proper example I'll show you right so let me just tell you just try to relate this with a real life example suppose see I generally eat two chapati daily right so my mother know that I eat two chapati so she make only two the for daily right by default I don't need to tell her every day like I want but if someday if I'm more hungry and I want te then specifically I mentioned that I on that right so on that day that default value two is overwritten by the value provided by new right so this kind of thing so generally uh when we deal with these projects and programs also so generally most most of the time most of the cases values for some argument are soon right like maybe rate of interest 10% or any any of most of the time supp rate of interest is so you don't need to tell every time that 10% rate of interest 10 you just give that default in the fun right or like this text when you Cate text and suppose in my company most that having 6% 10% 12% so by default the text rate for that is 12% that in that category so when you calculate that some for those by default that text 12 right so in those cases default arguments are needed you don't need to pass those arguments again and again just pass default argument but how to pass default argument when to pass these default arguments when to you know Define these default arguments right this thing we'll see in this video so let me just show you this with one example I hope you uh now know the difference between argument and paramet arguments when we call a function then the actual value you pass those are known as Al and parameters are those variables that we take it those function definition or in function declaration at that time those variables are known as parameters let me show you the single exam so let's cre a new file here so here we have let's take a simple uh example any example you can take see when I was uh working in that PJ then I I I used to teach civil and mechanical so in my class there were you know void so tech there was only one girl and civil there was only four or five girls so suppose if this is the case so I want to write the name of every student using a function then if all are boys then I'll pronounce like Mr Right and if there is a girl then miss so by default you can pass that prefix value Mister right while greeting those students let me show you this thing with example I have a function suppose greet and there we have you have to pass string name and I have string prefix means Mr message or doctor or any prefix you want to apply so suppose two thing I have only name and prefix right and this is declaration so you can omit this name and prefix just provide string and string that is also fine just data type right and in main I'm calling this greet I'm just passing like any name Rahul and uh Mr prefix is Mr Mr Rahul right and then just Define it so these are parameter here these Rahul Mis these are arguments and in definition or in declaration I'm taking name prefix name prefix these are variable sorry these are these variables these are known as parameters right or formal formal parameters and these are known as Rahul M these are known as arguments or actual parameters right so I'm just printing C out like high and whatever the prefix right and then name so either we can use this only and name or we can concatenate this concatenate with one space and concatenate plus name right this way is also fine if you're using like class the string so better to include specifically that string head it's always a good to use string H file if you're using St right now this in this main after successful completion it will return zero and this GD is returning nothing so the DAT type is return type is vo right let's R this here we are not using any default value we are providing both the values Rahul mister and all right let's run this so see hi Mr Rahul let me just decorate it a little bit with the space right so now if in my class I have 60 students and all are 59 are boys and only one is girl so rather than passing every time Mr here suppose I pass uh I call this function again like another student bod and name is bod and Mister so same let's run this and see Mr Rahul Mr B so every time you are passing Mr right so in most of the cases this argument value would be Mr Mr Mister so rather than repeating this again and again just pass it as a default value now where to write this as a default value either in declaration or definition but but it's always a good practice to write to provide default values default argument values in declaration or prototype not in definition right you can provide it in definition right but in that case if you're providing default value in this function definition then function definition must be before function calling right it's always a good practice to I'll recommend to use this thing default values to provide default values in function prototypes so function this string prefix default value for this I am going to provide is equal to always m not always most of the time M because I have one girl in my class so for that I'll you know use a miss right so here no need to provide this argument value for this argument let's run this and see what output you same hi Mr Rahul hi Mr mode so we this is default argument so default argument is a value automatically assigned by the compiler if while calling the function you don't provide any value for that argument for this we are not providing any value so it will take automatically assign this value to that argument right so this is default argument value I hope you got this but there are some rules see default if suppose suffix also you want to use so if I write something like this suffix and suffix would all be different every time like surname of each student is different most of the student so I cannot provide a default value so what do you think will it work suppose you think this Rahul it will take Mr for prefix and just provide suffix for Zo right but this time give see more than one instance of overloaded function we why so because while you're calling this function whatever you will pass those would be those values would be assigned to the parameters from left to right so in name in name Rahul would be a sign this Roy would be assign to prefix right but we have one four that is suffix so let's in definition also you have to change it suff after name just plus with space and plus what suffix will give that will be printed oftr see default argument missing for parameter three for parameter three default argument is missing because in this case this Rahul would be assigned to this name this Roy would be assigned to this prefix now it is expecting one more parameter one more argument for suffix and you have providing only two right so these values would be assigned from left to right so you cannot leave it like this default argument should always be at the end right if you want any default arguments then that will be in the end if you have provided here default argument then after that all the argument or all the parameter you write here that must be default you cannot take any this argument positional argument here right so for this you can fix this ofix is equal to just provide a space so for default it's space right now it will run same thing but it will give now hi Roy Rahul see and Mr Bol why Roy Rahul because I am just printing High then prefix and in this case prefix is Roy Roy and name is Rahul right and no suff suffix is like space on and if I call this for like greet and I think the name of that girl was shrishti and now prefix is Miss right and suffix also suppose I'll give I don't know her surname so let's use Kumari here okay let's run this and see hi Miss sishi Kumari Mr binod hi Roy Rahul so let's delete this right so these values default Val Val are overwritten here right this rather than this mis now for this function called prefixes Miss right so these are not constant argument because the values can be changed the values can be overwritten if you provide your specific value then default value would not be used right your special value your specific value you provide that would be used while calling right so in this case if you want to provide Rahul and Roy for suffix then you cannot provide here Rahul and simply Roy you have to provide Mr also for second argument and then you can write here like Roy now it will work fine see Mr Rahul Roy right so I hope you got the this uh the fun of uh default arguments so this question is for you you have to solve this what would be the output of uh this thing pause the video and try this out and uh write down the answer in comment section see here we have first of all control will go to the main function then we are calling the sum we are passing three uh argument one to three so before it it will check where it is defined but it is defined after that but yeah it has a declaration before calling so that's fine in declaration we have 1 2 3 three parameter but one is default for third one I'm providing value zero right and return type is in so now it will go to the definition part and x y z three are argument we have sorry three parameter we have here we have parameter x y z are parameters 1 2 3 are arguments and return X+ y + z right so here it will it will call the sum function with 1 2 three value default value is zero for Z but it will it will use three in this case in second case we are only providing one value some one so it will give error why so because one will give will be given to X for y we are not giving any value yeah for Zed we have default value but but for y we are not giving any value right so it will give you error to few arguments in function call right at least you have to pass two argument because one two two parameters are not default only one is default so it will give error in this case you have to provide at least two this Su three four see that will work fine because X would be three y would be four you are not giving any value for Z it's okay we have default value zero right so let's run this and see what output you're getting here okay we have Mr semicolon here see 6 six and seven right six six and seven right other than zero also you can take any value but after this you cannot take something like this or if you modify it a little bit for second argument you give default value for third not you're not giving any default value in that case let's run this and see what error you are getting default argument missing for parameter three in this in sum for parameter three for this so after providing the default argument after this if you have any parameter that those all the parameter must be default so you have to provide a default argument after this default argument can be at the end right like in the tail of the parameter list default argument should be in the tail of the parameter list right so just by adding any default argument you can just increase you can just you change the capab capability of the function right just by using a default argument and you have to write down less code right the program would be easy to write so it helps in reducing the size of the program also but execution time will be a little bit more because if you're not providing any argument value for this then the compiler has to copy that default value to this parameter right so execution time will be a little bit more right I hope you got now what are default argument values or default values these are not constant values because you can overwrite these default values and rather than in declaration we can have have default value here as well but in this case it will give error because if you are using this default value in function definition then function definition must be before function calling right you can just change it and you can just run the sensing right so that's it for this video now uh in the next we'll see maybe some coding exercises on based on functions right so now I'll see you in the next video till then bye take care
