00:00 - so in the series of learning Python
00:01 - programming language in the previous
00:03 - video we have seen index error like what
00:05 - is index error why you get this index
00:06 - error and how to fix this error right
00:09 - now the next topic is nested list I hope
00:12 - you are clear with what is list and
00:14 - python how to use the list and all we
00:16 - have discussed the thing now we'll be
00:18 - discussing what is nested list right
00:21 - I'll show you practical also see if I
00:25 - make a list something like this suppose
00:26 - I am making a list of numbers numbers is
00:29 - equal to and this is at least like 1 10
00:32 - 15 20 like this
00:34 - right
00:36 - and duplicate elements are also allowed
00:38 - we know so rather than this I can
00:40 - directly I can this 15 we can I can
00:43 - write down again so this is what I list
00:46 - right
00:47 - list of numbers list of names possible
00:50 - or let's you know list need not to be
00:53 - homogeneous
00:55 - this list is also possible like I'm
00:57 - writing 1 10 then I'm writing Jenny a
01:01 - string then I'm writing like true
01:06 - so this is Boolean this is string this
01:08 - is what integer right so this kind of
01:12 - list is also possible mixed data type
01:15 - now what is nested Leaf a nested list
01:19 - within a list suppose rather than
01:22 - writing this thing I am writing
01:24 - something like this this and
01:27 - this so this is one list but within this
01:31 - list I have one more list
01:33 - having 20 minus 10 and 15.
01:36 - so this is what nested list
01:39 - it's not like that we can add more
01:42 - elements also like we I can add
01:45 - something like this so this is nested
01:47 - list because it is list within a list
01:50 - right
01:51 - now the point is if
01:54 - one question for you is if I find out
01:56 - length of this list
01:58 - using length function like length
02:00 - numbers
02:02 - then what would be the length of this
02:03 - list
02:04 - one two three four five six seven eight
02:08 - is it eight or one two three four five
02:11 - six is it six
02:15 - it is six why so because this complete
02:20 - list is considered to be one item of
02:22 - this outer list not three item
02:26 - so the length of this list is one two
02:28 - three four five and six not eight right
02:32 - so this is concept of nestled nested
02:35 - list now how this this list is to be
02:38 - stored let me just show you the memory
02:41 - allocation
02:42 - see we have a list
02:45 - one two three four five and six elements
02:49 - so I have like 1 10 15 then 17 like this
02:54 - and here rather than these elements we
02:57 - are having good
02:58 - reference of this list 20 minus 10 and
03:03 - 15 something like this
03:05 - right
03:07 - now index is 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2.
03:14 - and this list is what the name of this
03:16 - list is numbers
03:18 - so how you can access the element of
03:20 - this simply numbers
03:23 - and the name of the list and in
03:25 - subscript
03:27 - obviously the index so if I write like 0
03:29 - so it will give one if I write 1 it will
03:31 - give 10 if I write 2 it will give 15 if
03:33 - I write 3
03:36 - what it will give
03:38 - 20 minus 10 15 something like this
03:42 - right if I write 4 17 5 a 0 but if you
03:47 - want to access the individual individual
03:49 - element of this list then how you can
03:50 - access
03:52 - first of all numbers 3 after that next
03:55 - index would be maybe there is 0 1 or 2
04:00 - through this we can access like this
04:01 - three then one two or three like three
04:06 - zero it will give 20 this element
04:10 - three one
04:13 - it will give minus 10 something like
04:15 - this and slicing is also possible
04:18 - we have discussed what is slicing right
04:20 - so I hope what is nested list it is
04:23 - clear to you guys now let me just take
04:25 - one example we will make a program and
04:27 - on that we'll be discussing what is how
04:30 - how you can access these elements what
04:32 - is slicing how you can apply slicing on
04:35 - this list also right so I'll show you
04:38 - practically
04:39 - so let's create a new file here
04:44 - nested underscore list
04:50 - okay now I'll making a list like
04:53 - I'm taking list one name and here I'm
04:56 - writing like 10
04:58 - 34 like this
05:01 - so this is outer list this is list
05:04 - within a list so let me just
05:08 - print what would be the length of this
05:10 - list
05:17 - let's select current file and run this
05:19 - see length is
05:21 - 5 okay 1 2 3 4 and 5 this complete is
05:27 - one item only right now if you want to
05:30 - access
05:32 - the element of this list then using
05:34 - obviously using index we can access
05:36 - right so let's just print if I
05:42 - write something like this
05:45 - Now list one and I want to access
05:48 - at Fourth index
05:50 - so at Fourth index we have 89.
05:53 - now because Z 0 1 2 this complete is at
05:58 - third index and then four now let me
06:01 - just access the third index
06:05 - C the complete list you could because at
06:08 - third Index this is the lesson now third
06:12 - index and then again one more index zero
06:15 - now you will get this 45
06:17 - right at 3 0 we have 45
06:22 - at 3
06:23 - 2 we have minus 3 I hope you would have
06:27 - to access if there is a next list how to
06:29 - you can access the element rather than
06:31 - this 4578 minus 3 you can put here any
06:33 - names also so strings also allowed like
06:36 - here we have integer here we have string
06:38 - allow because list can contain mixed
06:41 - data type right
06:43 - now slicing and see if I write negative
06:46 - index like minus 2
06:49 - at minus 2 we have this list only
06:51 - because this is minus one eighty nine at
06:53 - minus 1 negative indexing from backward
06:55 - this is minus two minus 3 minus four
06:57 - minus five something like this right now
06:59 - what is slicing C
07:01 - and see if I write rather than this
07:04 - index I am here just
07:08 - putting Len function Len of list one
07:13 - right
07:15 - and
07:20 - suppose minus 1
07:22 - if I wrote something like this like list
07:24 - one but rather than providing the direct
07:26 - index I am providing some expression
07:29 - length of the list 1 and then minus 1.
07:32 - now length of this list one is one two
07:34 - three four five then five minus 1 is 4.
07:38 - so index would be both so what it should
07:41 - print 89
07:44 - right now if I write here minus 2 then
07:48 - 3 Ultimate index would be three so now
07:51 - it is printing this list right so rather
07:54 - than direct index some expression can
07:55 - also be there that would be evaluated
07:57 - and after that just find out the
08:00 - you know index value right okay let's
08:03 - see slicing here
08:06 - okay so list one and I am providing here
08:08 - first third index then at second index
08:12 - nothing
08:14 - slicing means start point and point but
08:17 - if you do not provide provide anything
08:19 - then start point would be by default
08:21 - zero but the first index and ending
08:23 - point would be the length of the list
08:24 - right so length of this list
08:27 - means one two three so zero to three it
08:29 - would be zero to three let's suppose
08:31 - first write a zero two
08:34 - three so it will print this complete
08:37 - list 45 78 and minus 3 but if I do not
08:40 - put 0 and 3 then also it will print this
08:44 - list because by default here we have 0
08:46 - and here we have 3 right and if you put
08:49 - something like 0 2 I want to access only
08:52 - 0 to 2.
08:54 - okay
08:56 - now what it will print only to element
08:58 - 45 and 78 from zeroth index that is 45
09:02 - and 2 is
09:04 - what is this two not index it is length
09:06 - of the list length of this list
09:08 - because this third this index 3 that is
09:11 - for outer list so at third index we have
09:13 - this list now for this list we are
09:15 - providing next index
09:17 - so 0 means from 0 to index to 2 2 means
09:20 - length of this list
09:23 - till two length like one and two
09:27 - right so till 78 it will print right
09:30 - means still
09:31 - 2 minus 1
09:33 - that is one index so 0 to 1 45 and 78 I
09:37 - hope you got this
09:39 - and rather than this one more thing we
09:41 - have at third if you don't do not
09:44 - provide anything here and
09:46 - third part is the step if you have
09:48 - watched my that video uh list in Python
09:51 - then we have discussed this thing also
09:53 - now third is steps so now by default
09:56 - step is one it will print some
09:58 - everything 45 78 minus three and if I
10:01 - write step is two so first it will print
10:03 - it will start from 0 that is 45 then two
10:06 - step means one and two means 45 and
10:10 - minus 3 it will print only not 78 it
10:13 - will skip 78.
10:14 - 45 and minus 3. so like this we can
10:17 - access the list of element of nested
10:19 - list and we can provide slicing on that
10:21 - list so this is basically a basic idea
10:24 - of nested listing python okay so one
10:26 - question for you is this is the list we
10:28 - have list two is this one
10:30 - first of all tell me it is possible is
10:33 - it possible to create this type of list
10:34 - and then you have to tell what is the
10:36 - length of this list and then how you can
10:39 - ex I just want to print
10:41 - this uh like I just want to access this
10:45 - this one the ram then how you can access
10:48 - this Ram what you have to write right so
10:53 - this is for your assignment you have to
10:54 - tell in comment section so I hope you
10:57 - got what is nested list and how to use
10:58 - it how to access the element of nested
11:00 - list so the next video we'll see one
11:02 - coding exercise so now it's my next
11:03 - video bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen index error like what is index error why you get this index error and how to fix this error right now the next topic is nested list I hope you are clear with what is list and python how to use the list and all we have discussed the thing now we'll be discussing what is nested list right I'll show you practical also see if I make a list something like this suppose I am making a list of numbers numbers is equal to and this is at least like 1 10 15 20 like this right and duplicate elements are also allowed we know so rather than this I can directly I can this 15 we can I can write down again so this is what I list right list of numbers list of names possible or let's you know list need not to be homogeneous this list is also possible like I'm writing 1 10 then I'm writing Jenny a string then I'm writing like true so this is Boolean this is string this is what integer right so this kind of list is also possible mixed data type now what is nested Leaf a nested list within a list suppose rather than writing this thing I am writing something like this this and this so this is one list but within this list I have one more list having 20 minus 10 and 15. so this is what nested list it's not like that we can add more elements also like we I can add something like this so this is nested list because it is list within a list right now the point is if one question for you is if I find out length of this list using length function like length numbers then what would be the length of this list one two three four five six seven eight is it eight or one two three four five six is it six it is six why so because this complete list is considered to be one item of this outer list not three item so the length of this list is one two three four five and six not eight right so this is concept of nestled nested list now how this this list is to be stored let me just show you the memory allocation see we have a list one two three four five and six elements so I have like 1 10 15 then 17 like this and here rather than these elements we are having good reference of this list 20 minus 10 and 15 something like this right now index is 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2. and this list is what the name of this list is numbers so how you can access the element of this simply numbers and the name of the list and in subscript obviously the index so if I write like 0 so it will give one if I write 1 it will give 10 if I write 2 it will give 15 if I write 3 what it will give 20 minus 10 15 something like this right if I write 4 17 5 a 0 but if you want to access the individual individual element of this list then how you can access first of all numbers 3 after that next index would be maybe there is 0 1 or 2 through this we can access like this three then one two or three like three zero it will give 20 this element three one it will give minus 10 something like this and slicing is also possible we have discussed what is slicing right so I hope what is nested list it is clear to you guys now let me just take one example we will make a program and on that we'll be discussing what is how how you can access these elements what is slicing how you can apply slicing on this list also right so I'll show you practically so let's create a new file here nested underscore list okay now I'll making a list like I'm taking list one name and here I'm writing like 10 34 like this so this is outer list this is list within a list so let me just print what would be the length of this list let's select current file and run this see length is 5 okay 1 2 3 4 and 5 this complete is one item only right now if you want to access the element of this list then using obviously using index we can access right so let's just print if I write something like this Now list one and I want to access at Fourth index so at Fourth index we have 89. now because Z 0 1 2 this complete is at third index and then four now let me just access the third index C the complete list you could because at third Index this is the lesson now third index and then again one more index zero now you will get this 45 right at 3 0 we have 45 at 3 2 we have minus 3 I hope you would have to access if there is a next list how to you can access the element rather than this 4578 minus 3 you can put here any names also so strings also allowed like here we have integer here we have string allow because list can contain mixed data type right now slicing and see if I write negative index like minus 2 at minus 2 we have this list only because this is minus one eighty nine at minus 1 negative indexing from backward this is minus two minus 3 minus four minus five something like this right now what is slicing C and see if I write rather than this index I am here just putting Len function Len of list one right and suppose minus 1 if I wrote something like this like list one but rather than providing the direct index I am providing some expression length of the list 1 and then minus 1. now length of this list one is one two three four five then five minus 1 is 4. so index would be both so what it should print 89 right now if I write here minus 2 then 3 Ultimate index would be three so now it is printing this list right so rather than direct index some expression can also be there that would be evaluated and after that just find out the you know index value right okay let's see slicing here okay so list one and I am providing here first third index then at second index nothing slicing means start point and point but if you do not provide provide anything then start point would be by default zero but the first index and ending point would be the length of the list right so length of this list means one two three so zero to three it would be zero to three let's suppose first write a zero two three so it will print this complete list 45 78 and minus 3 but if I do not put 0 and 3 then also it will print this list because by default here we have 0 and here we have 3 right and if you put something like 0 2 I want to access only 0 to 2. okay now what it will print only to element 45 and 78 from zeroth index that is 45 and 2 is what is this two not index it is length of the list length of this list because this third this index 3 that is for outer list so at third index we have this list now for this list we are providing next index so 0 means from 0 to index to 2 2 means length of this list till two length like one and two right so till 78 it will print right means still 2 minus 1 that is one index so 0 to 1 45 and 78 I hope you got this and rather than this one more thing we have at third if you don't do not provide anything here and third part is the step if you have watched my that video uh list in Python then we have discussed this thing also now third is steps so now by default step is one it will print some everything 45 78 minus three and if I write step is two so first it will print it will start from 0 that is 45 then two step means one and two means 45 and minus 3 it will print only not 78 it will skip 78. 45 and minus 3. so like this we can access the list of element of nested list and we can provide slicing on that list so this is basically a basic idea of nested listing python okay so one question for you is this is the list we have list two is this one first of all tell me it is possible is it possible to create this type of list and then you have to tell what is the length of this list and then how you can ex I just want to print this uh like I just want to access this this one the ram then how you can access this Ram what you have to write right so this is for your assignment you have to tell in comment section so I hope you got what is nested list and how to use it how to access the element of nested list so the next video we'll see one coding exercise so now it's my next video bye take care
