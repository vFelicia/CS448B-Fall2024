00:09 - yes now you can start your programming
00:12 - journey and take your preparation
00:13 - preparation from basic to advanced level
00:15 - by enrolling in guided path of C plus
00:19 - plus by code Studio and you can Master
00:22 - the topics like input and output some
00:24 - introduction first of all introductory
00:26 - topics input and outputs Advanced topic
00:28 - like input and outputs in C plus plus
00:30 - Loops conditional statements control
00:33 - structures if it fails these type of
00:36 - statements then arrays strings oops
00:39 - concept these type of topics from basic
00:41 - to advanced level all the topics will be
00:43 - covered okay now maybe you are thinking
00:45 - why you should enroll in this guided
00:48 - path of C plus plus given by code Studio
00:51 - so all the relevant links you will find
00:53 - in the description box of this video you
00:54 - can check out now let me just tell you
00:56 - why you should go for this guided path
00:58 - first thing the guided paths you know
01:02 - covers all the topics from basic to
01:04 - advanced level in a structured way with
01:08 - notes detailed in nodes should be given
01:10 - to you and then
01:12 - some practice questions also some mcqs
01:15 - and practice questions on all the topics
01:17 - covered okay so you will find notes of
01:22 - that topic as well as some practice
01:24 - questions also
01:25 - followed by the nodes right second thing
01:29 - all the important topics would be
01:31 - covered in this guided paths like some
01:34 - introductory topics like macros you know
01:37 - commands how to implement code in C plus
01:41 - plus then some Advanced topics input and
01:43 - output arrays strings oops Concepts
01:46 - Loops you know conditional statements
01:48 - all the these topics would be covered
01:50 - okay third thing
01:53 - average time would be taken to complete
01:55 - this kind of path is 25 days and not

03:36 - you the modules basically in this there
03:40 - are 12 models total 12 modules are there
03:42 - then start from introductory topics then
03:44 - Advanced topics so now first module is
03:47 - we have introduction to C plus plus in
03:49 - this you will get features of C plus
03:51 - plus uses of C plus plus how to
03:52 - implement a code macros comments right
03:55 - like whenever you click first on the
03:58 - first you know tab basics of C plus plus
04:00 - first of all you will get notes right
04:03 - these are some nodes then features of C
04:06 - plus plus use of C plus plus you can
04:08 - click on these how to implement code in
04:10 - C plus plus right you will get nodes
04:12 - first of all of that topic after
04:15 - completing
04:17 - that topic like here you will we will
04:19 - have headers then main function then
04:21 - compile and run macros and comments in
04:24 - first module these are the topics right
04:27 - after completing first module you will
04:29 - have mcqs okay whenever you click on
04:31 - mcqs
04:32 - then including header file this McQ then
04:36 - multi-line commands and McQ on this
04:37 - topic then weekly type language McQ 3
04:40 - are there right whenever you click on
04:42 - this you will get an question
04:44 - you will you know select your right

04:59 - right
05:00 - see now you can see second module is
05:03 - what
05:04 - see here after first model you will have
05:06 - 30 points
05:09 - of mcqs right now second module is
05:12 - variables and data types so in this
05:14 - module what you will get what are
05:16 - variables
05:18 - first of all if you then introduction to
05:21 - data types then what are data types
05:22 - different data types and scope of
05:24 - variables type of variables and type
05:25 - casting plus see whenever you click on
05:28 - anything like I'm I'm going to click on
05:30 - the first tab introduction to variable
05:32 - attempt right so first you will get
05:36 - notes see introduction to variables
05:38 - these are some nodes
05:39 - right after that
05:43 - you will get these are this this is what
05:46 - interaction to variables then
05:48 - questions mcqs invalid variable valid
05:51 - variables two questions are there two
05:53 - mcqs are there right
05:55 - then same introduction to data type
05:58 - whenever you click on this then
06:01 - let's click on introduction you will get
06:03 - notes and then
06:04 - questions
06:06 - so detailed nodes followed by
06:09 - practice questions you will get right
06:12 - next same third module is what in third
06:15 - module you will have input and output in
06:18 - C plus plus say motor input and output
06:20 - in C plus plus then mcqs and then
06:21 - practice problems also right let's click
06:25 - on this practice problems
06:30 - they will be given some problem and here
06:33 - you can write down your solution you can
06:35 - run code you can submit your code right
06:37 - in any language like
06:39 - if you are learning C plus plus
06:40 - obviously you will
06:42 - select C plus plus right so here you can
06:45 - write down your code you can run your
06:46 - code and you can submit so these are
06:48 - some practice problems also here
06:51 - first is find area of rectangle then
06:53 - print name and age swap two numbers
06:56 - calculate simple interest these are some
06:58 - practice problems so they are having
07:00 - some points also right fourth modulus
07:03 - operators in C plus plus now first of
07:06 - all introduction to operators and all
07:08 - the type of operators arithmetic so
07:09 - first you will get the theory of
07:11 - arithmetic operators then
07:14 - mcq's questions of 40 points then
07:17 - urinary operator relational logical
07:19 - Operator bitwise Operator all the type
07:21 - of operators has been explained right
07:23 - then Loops conditional statements same
07:26 - first of all you will get notes detailed
07:29 - nodes and then problems in this module
07:31 - you will get 28 problems and points are
07:34 - also given okay
07:36 - for each topic first like functions in C
07:39 - plus plus also here also you will get
07:40 - first of all what are function type of
07:42 - functions parameters function
07:43 - overloading and then practice problems
07:45 - like this we have 12 modules pointers
07:49 - and memory allocation then arrays then
07:51 - strings then oops Concepts
07:55 - four main concept like obstruction
07:56 - encapsulation inheritance and
07:59 - polymorphism so we have these concept
08:02 - also classes and objects
08:05 - mcqs and practice problems Constructor
08:07 - Destructor this pointer shall you and
08:10 - deep copy
08:11 - then encapsulation inheritance excess
08:14 - specify as polymorphism abstraction
08:15 - interfaces
08:17 - all those Concepts has been explained
08:19 - with
08:20 - some practice problems exception
08:22 - handling exceptional handling and last
08:25 - STL in C plus plus so these are 12
08:28 - modules in this guided path of C plus
08:31 - plus right and after this you will get a
08:35 - certificate also free certificate now
08:36 - you can download that certificate
08:39 - after completing 80 percent of this
08:42 - guided path see you have to score 80
08:44 - percent without penalty then you can
08:46 - without penalty you can download this
08:48 - certificate this should be unlocked
08:51 - right
08:52 - so like this
08:54 - and average time to complete is 25 days
08:56 - and what are prerequisite basic aptitude
09:00 - you need to know to learn the C plus
09:03 - plus language this guided path right
09:06 - as you can see I have shown you you will
09:09 - find all the topics of C plus the course
09:12 - you can say a structural way in a
09:15 - structure where you will get the these
09:18 - topics and the notes and then practice
09:20 - problems also mcqs also so I think if
09:24 - you are you know a beginner and you are
09:27 - you are searching for this kind of thing
09:29 - rather than jumping from this video
09:31 - tutorial to this video tutorial because
09:33 - somewhere you will get notes somewhere
09:35 - you will get videos but no you know
09:37 - practice questions here you will get all
09:40 - the things Under One Roof so it would be
09:42 - better to go for the square path and
09:44 - best thing is what it is free so all the
09:46 - relevant links and details you will find
09:48 - in the description box of this video you
09:50 - can go and check out and if you find

can see second module is what see here after first model you will have 30 points of mcqs right now second module is variables and data types so in this module what you will get what are variables first of all if you then introduction to data types then what are data types different data types and scope of variables type of variables and type casting plus see whenever you click on anything like I'm I'm going to click on the first tab introduction to variable attempt right so first you will get notes see introduction to variables these are some nodes right after that you will get these are this this is what interaction to variables then questions mcqs invalid variable valid variables two questions are there two mcqs are there right then same introduction to data type whenever you click on this then let's click on introduction you will get notes and then questions so detailed nodes followed by practice questions you will get right next same third module is what in third module you will have input and output in C plus plus say motor input and output in C plus plus then mcqs and then practice problems also right let's click on this practice problems they will be given some problem and here you can write down your solution you can run code you can submit your code right in any language like if you are learning C plus plus obviously you will select C plus plus right so here you can write down your code you can run your code and you can submit so these are some practice problems also here first is find area of rectangle then print name and age swap two numbers calculate simple interest these are some practice problems so they are having some points also right fourth modulus operators in C plus plus now first of all introduction to operators and all the type

interfaces all those Concepts has been explained with some practice problems exception handling exceptional handling and last STL in C plus plus so these are 12 modules in this guided path of C plus plus right and after this you will get a certificate also free certificate now you can download that certificate after completing 80 percent of this guided path see you have to score 80 percent without penalty then you can without penalty you can download this certificate this should be unlocked right so like this and average time to complete is 25 days and what are prerequisite basic aptitude you need to know to learn the C plus plus language this guided path right as you can see I have shown you you will find all the topics of C plus the course you can say a structural way in a
