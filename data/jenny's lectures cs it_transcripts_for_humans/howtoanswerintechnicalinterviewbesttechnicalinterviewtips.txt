00:27 - round of the interview because in
00:29 - technical round basically they test
00:30 - your subject knowledge means score
00:33 - computer science subject knowledge if
00:34 - you are a computer science students
00:36 - right
00:36 - so have you answered those questions
00:38 - that thing also matters
00:40 - so i'm going to tell you the most
00:41 - important tips to answer the

01:07 - and this has already been started from
01:09 - 5th of november and these classes would
01:11 - be full
01:12 - for all the branches like mechanical
01:14 - civil computer science you can see the
01:16 - details
01:16 - over here and in these classes detail
01:19 - discussion would be there on the
01:20 - previous year question paper
01:22 - ah of this particular subject like on
01:25 - this day
01:26 - this in this class detailed discussion
01:28 - on previous year question paper
01:30 - of the subject dbms on some another a
01:33 - detailed discussion on the previous year
01:34 - question paper of the subject
01:36 - toc maybe computer networks like this so
01:39 - they'll teach you how to solve
01:41 - these questions the best possible steps
01:43 - the best
01:44 - strategy to solve these kind of
01:46 - questions so that
01:48 - you can quickly solve those questions in
01:50 - your lecture exam see solving previous
01:52 - year question paper is also very
01:53 - important with your
01:55 - preparation so if you are interested you
01:57 - can go for it you can attend these
01:59 - classes these are completely free you

02:05 - all the details
02:06 - and the link i'll provide you in the
02:08 - description box of this video you can go
02:10 - and check out
02:11 - so now let us discuss the most important
02:13 - tips
02:14 - to answer the question in technical
02:16 - round very first thing is what
02:18 - make sure you understand the question
02:20 - first rather
02:21 - rather than start answering that
02:22 - question sometimes it happens
02:25 - the interviewer asked a question but you
02:26 - didn't get the question it is
02:28 - unambiguous it is not clear to you
02:30 - but you start answering that question or
02:32 - maybe you misinterpret the question so
02:34 - you misinterpret some terms
02:36 - from that question and you start
02:38 - answering that question so definitely
02:40 - or maybe it happens that your answer
02:42 - would be
02:44 - wrong you are going in wrong direction
02:45 - that's not exactly the interviewer wants
02:48 - that is not the answer so first of all
02:50 - understand the question
02:52 - first ask question to the interviewer to
02:55 - clear your doubts
02:57 - understand what exactly the interviewer
03:00 - is asking
03:01 - sometimes intentionally interviewer ask
03:04 - some
03:04 - unambiguous questions right because they
03:07 - want
03:08 - you to ask questions to clear your
03:10 - doubts
03:11 - they want to check how intelligently you
03:13 - ask questions
03:14 - whether you are able to clear your
03:16 - doubts or you just start answering
03:18 - the question even if the question is not
03:20 - you know
03:21 - unambiguous so the the question is not
03:23 - clear
03:24 - so make sure you understand the question
03:26 - first
03:27 - see if you clear your doubts by asking
03:29 - questions then it will create a good
03:31 - impression
03:32 - right they think interviewer think that
03:34 - yeah you have some knowledge about that
03:36 - concept that is why you are asking
03:38 - some questions right so second mistake
03:41 - is what our second
03:42 - tip is what once you get the question
03:46 - but before answering you need to take
03:48 - care your answer
03:49 - is to the point interviewer wants to the
03:52 - point answer
03:52 - short answer brief answer sweet answer
03:55 - they don't want a lengthy story it's not
03:57 - like that you start from the origin like
03:59 - first of all this then this then this
04:00 - maybe sometimes it happens uh
04:03 - before reaching to the main point of
04:05 - that question or that answer the
04:07 - interviewer stops you and
04:09 - ask another question so rather than
04:12 - telling a lengthy story
04:13 - just answer to the point and suppose if
04:16 - they want more detail then they'll ask
04:19 - you and you can tell at that time more
04:21 - details
04:22 - after that third tip is what do not give
04:25 - bookish answers sometimes
04:26 - from a pressure they are simple question
04:28 - like for example they ask what is
04:30 - encapsulation what do you say
04:31 - wrapping up of data and function in a
04:33 - single unit is called encapsulation
04:34 - that's it
04:36 - no that's not a good approach to answer
04:38 - the questions
04:40 - that is just what it's written in the
04:41 - book and you have read that
04:43 - line you have to give some examples
04:46 - or if you are if you are giving the
04:48 - answer like bookish answer then try to
04:51 - relate that answer try to justify your
04:53 - answer with some maybe
04:54 - real life examples or with some more
04:56 - examples
04:57 - they prefer you to give answer in your
05:00 - own language what you have understood
05:02 - from that book and
05:04 - just give answer in your own language
05:06 - don't just copy the
05:07 - answer which is written in that book
05:09 - right
05:10 - next step is what do not pretend that
05:13 - you know everything sometimes they ask
05:15 - these type of questions you have no idea
05:17 - you are
05:18 - completely clueless so it's better to
05:22 - say
05:22 - i'm sorry sir i'm not familiar with this
05:24 - term or maybe i'm not familiar with this
05:26 - term but i'm familiar with
05:28 - this skill so if you want i can put my
05:32 - views in this context like this rather
05:35 - than
05:35 - bluffing if you don't know the answer
05:38 - but you start answering the question
05:41 - illogically sometimes it happens you
05:43 - don't know the answer you are completely
05:45 - clueless you haven't heard about that
05:47 - term
05:47 - but you start answering that question
05:50 - even the
05:51 - answer is what illogical it's irrelevant
05:54 - you are using some buzzwords and
05:56 - maybe they will do some cross
05:57 - questioning and you will get caught
05:59 - so rather than doing this thing be
06:01 - honest
06:02 - they always want to hire honest people
06:04 - like i don't know the answer
06:06 - i'm not familiar with this see in an
06:07 - interview it is not
06:09 - necessary that you know answer of all
06:10 - the questions they ask
06:12 - but the important thing is what how when
06:14 - you answer
06:15 - those questions you know you have the
06:18 - knowledge about those questions how well
06:20 - you answer those questions that thing
06:22 - also matters here right
06:24 - and fifth is communicate with the
06:27 - interviewer while
06:28 - answering the question maybe they have
06:31 - asked like write down this function to
06:32 - do so write down this logic
06:34 - and you take what you you say what i
06:37 - need five minutes and silently you are
06:39 - thinking the logic
06:40 - and then you start writing maybe after
06:41 - five minutes but that is not a good
06:43 - approach that is not right way
06:45 - you don't have to be silent at that time
06:47 - you have to think loud
06:49 - like you can communicate with the
06:50 - interviewer how how you are going to
06:52 - write down the logic or the function
06:54 - maybe you are going in wrong wrong
06:56 - direction so they'll give some hint
06:58 - like do so or do so or use this keyword
07:01 - or use this and that
07:02 - so the interviewer know your progress
07:04 - yeah you are thinking you are going in
07:06 - right direction
07:07 - maybe sometimes you are going in right
07:09 - direction or maybe sometimes you go in
07:10 - wrong direction then
07:11 - the interviewer will help you so that
07:13 - you can move in the right direction
07:16 - right but if you do like silently you
07:18 - are thinking of five minutes and then
07:20 - let's start writing code then
07:21 - interviewer say first of all describe
07:23 - your solution maybe sometimes they can
07:25 - say this
07:26 - right so don't think silently think loud
07:30 - communicate with the interviewer while
07:32 - you are thinking
07:33 - that is a good approach to answer any
07:35 - question because when you communicate
07:37 - while answering the question it shows
07:38 - that yeah you have good communication
07:40 - skills
07:41 - they can also test one more point like
07:43 - your communication skills are good
07:44 - so that would be good for you so these
07:46 - are some simple yet
07:47 - effective tips so that's it for this
07:49 - video nice in the next video till then
07:51 - bye bye take care
08:02 - you
