00:00 - hello everyone i hope you all are safe
00:02 - and doing good so in this lecture i am
00:04 - going to discuss with you what are some
00:05 - skills required for coding if you want
00:08 - to learn to code what skills you should
00:10 - have or these are some general skills i
00:13 - am not going to discuss these you know
00:14 - skills or these habits more precisely if
00:17 - i say these are habits these are really
00:20 - helpful in your real life also not in
00:22 - just coding in your real life you should
00:24 - have these habits
00:25 - right
00:26 - so maybe for some students skill is like
00:28 - a high level word so they are like oh my
00:31 - god skills no these are some habits
00:32 - general habits i am not going to discuss
00:34 - these points these habits from the
00:36 - perspective of those programming
00:37 - languages or tech aspects no these are
00:39 - general habits i think everybody is
00:42 - having these kind of habits so if you
00:44 - are having these habits definitely you
00:46 - can be a good coder you can learn coding
00:48 - right
00:49 - so now first thing is you should be
00:52 - curious
00:53 - like whenever you see something you have
00:56 - questions in your mind
00:58 - right it's not like that uh
01:00 - like if you are you know going to any
01:03 - shopping websites how those shopping
01:05 - websites are working whenever you go to
01:07 - your gmail account you fill your user id
01:10 - your password whenever you click that
01:11 - login button your gmail id will be
01:13 - opened how this is working what is the
01:15 - process behind the scene you are
01:17 - interested behind the process
01:20 - what is going on behind the scene
01:22 - not whatever you can see like whenever
01:25 - you you know any faculty teach you
01:28 - any topic
01:29 - so you are curious about that thing it's
01:31 - not like that they are teaching okay
01:32 - fine ma'am we got it no you should have
01:35 - the capability you should have the
01:36 - capability of you know cross questioning
01:39 - you should be curious at that time like
01:41 - whenever let's take a simple example
01:43 - whenever uh any concept i am teaching
01:46 - like areas i'm teaching then your first
01:49 - question would be why aries why we are
01:51 - studying arrays these kind of questions
01:53 - you should be curious like if you are
01:54 - playing any game computer game
01:57 - you should have in you know in your mind
01:59 - that how someone has written you know
02:02 - the code
02:03 - how you are able to play those games
02:05 - what is you know behind the scene
02:08 - i also want to make these kind of games
02:10 - or if you are working any if you are
02:12 - using any app like paytm how this app is
02:14 - working any shopping website how these
02:17 - apps are working
02:18 - right
02:19 - so
02:20 - are you having this capability like are
02:22 - you curious or someone will tell you
02:25 - this thing okay fine someone will tell
02:26 - you this thing okay fine you are not
02:28 - curious about anything
02:30 - right so if you want to learn coding if
02:32 - you want to be a good coder then
02:34 - definitely you have to be curious
02:37 - right and this habit will ultimately
02:39 - lead to what critical thinking skill
02:41 - logical thinking skill analytical skill
02:44 - and these skills are required obviously
02:46 - if you want to learn coding you should
02:47 - think logically you should have critical
02:49 - thinking right if i will say in that
02:52 - tech aspects or i i you i you know if i
02:54 - use those bigger terms
02:56 - but
02:57 - this will ultimately lead to those
02:59 - skills first of all you have a habit of
03:02 - this you should be curious
03:04 - second very important point is what
03:07 - patience
03:08 - you should have patience nowadays maybe
03:11 - you are you think that everybody wants
03:13 - to learn everything quickly but it's not
03:16 - like that you can learn coding in just
03:17 - 21 days it's not that kind of habit
03:19 - it needs practice years of practice
03:21 - actually for to be a good coder right so
03:24 - you have to be patient you just have to
03:26 - calm down you have to be very focused
03:29 - right towards your whatever you are
03:31 - doing whatever you are learning
03:33 - right
03:34 - because whenever you start learning
03:35 - coding
03:37 - many times you will get depressed you
03:39 - will feel demoralized
03:41 - right you will feel like
03:44 - i can't do coding i'm not able to write
03:45 - down a sing simple program how will i
03:48 - i'll write those you know complicated
03:50 - type of program today those data
03:51 - structure programs how i'll make a
03:54 - software or these kind of things
03:57 - okay
03:58 - slowly you will do that those things
04:00 - also but at starting everybody is going
04:03 - to know everybody go through that phase
04:07 - if someone is a good coder right now
04:09 - they have also started from zero right
04:12 - they were also at that level and if you
04:14 - will have patience obviously you will
04:15 - not give up
04:16 - easily right and that is
04:19 - very much required skill if you want to
04:21 - learn coding right because it's not easy
04:24 - to learn how to code right obviously it
04:27 - would be a tough process at starting you
04:29 - will do definitely you will do silly
04:31 - mistakes like
04:32 - while writing header file you will write
04:34 - s t u d i o dot it's not stdio dot h and
04:37 - when you will check the program
04:39 - i'm damn sure you will not able to find
04:41 - out those single those simple errors
04:43 - those silly mistake
04:45 - and then you will get frustrated you
04:46 - will not able to read those error
04:48 - messages like which kind of error is
04:50 - this in which line this is the error and
04:51 - this is also a skill
04:53 - to read those error messages find out
04:56 - yeah in this line this is the error that
04:58 - is also skill and it also required
05:00 - practice right but at starting you will
05:02 - not able to find out a simple error
05:05 - right but yeah it happens with everyone
05:07 - just practice just keep patience calm
05:10 - down focus
05:11 - if you are frustrated take a break
05:14 - then again write code
05:17 - that is the only way there is no
05:18 - shortcut right
05:20 - third thing
05:21 - which is very important is you should be
05:23 - self-motivated person
05:26 - see here i am writing self-motivated
05:30 - it's not like that
05:32 - you are that kind of student who are
05:34 - watching those motivational videos
05:38 - to get motivation right you have to be a
05:41 - self-motivated person
05:43 - because many times at starting you will
05:45 - feel demotivated how many times you'll
05:46 - watch those motivated motivational
05:48 - videos and you will just waste your time
05:50 - no
05:51 - see if you are really interested in
05:52 - coding if you think that
05:55 - if you have the idea what is the benefit
05:56 - of coding how coding can improve your
05:58 - life your you know in real life also
06:01 - that coding skill is very much helpful
06:04 - that also you can discuss in a separate
06:05 - video
06:06 - but
06:08 - you have to be a self-motivated person
06:10 - it's not like that just watch the
06:11 - motivational video and get motivation
06:13 - after 10 days again watch motivational
06:15 - videos and for two days get more to get
06:17 - you know get motivated no
06:20 - if you are interested in learning if you
06:22 - are interested in coding
06:24 - no external motivation would be required
06:27 - to keep learning that is for damn sure
06:30 - it's not for coding only
06:33 - anything for anything if you are
06:34 - interested in that doing that thing no
06:37 - external motivation would be required
06:40 - for doing for learning right
06:43 - if you are really interested
06:45 - so you have to be a self-motivated
06:47 - person for that
06:50 - next is
06:51 - uh
06:52 - you have the you know ability to sit
06:56 - at one place for at least like
06:58 - two to three hours
07:00 - at least for two to three hours and
07:02 - starting
07:03 - right
07:04 - after that you can obviously after that
07:06 - if you are interested you will
07:08 - automatically you will you know uh will
07:10 - sit for three or four hours or six hours
07:12 - a day and seven hours or a day and you
07:14 - you enjoy i'm damn sure you will enjoy
07:17 - that thing
07:18 - but it's starting maybe some students
07:20 - are like you know they are not able to
07:22 - sit in front of computer for
07:24 - you know half an hour
07:26 - so you have to make this habit yes you
07:29 - can sit in front of your computer for
07:30 - two to three hours at least for you know
07:33 - one and a half hour in starting and you
07:36 - can write down some code so this is also
07:38 - required the skill right
07:41 - next is what
07:42 - you have this attitude self-learning
07:45 - attitude it's not like that always there
07:48 - would be someone to teach you whenever
07:50 - any new technology come or whenever any
07:52 - new language you want to learn there is
07:54 - somebody to teach you you will get notes
07:56 - you will get video tutorials properly
07:58 - you will you know you will be
07:59 - spoon-feeded no
08:02 - technology is changing rapidly
08:05 - so you have to be a self-learner right
08:09 - to learn those changing technologies
08:13 - this skill is also very important
08:15 - self learning skill
08:17 - nobody is going to teach you how to code
08:20 - like sit i'll teach you how to code
08:22 - write down this program right on this
08:23 - program this is there and that is a no
08:26 - you have to sit you have to practice you
08:29 - have to find out the resources from
08:30 - where you can learn from google from any
08:33 - youtube videos you can you have to read
08:35 - documentation
08:36 - you have to go to that maybe for
08:39 - projects maybe for on github you have to
08:41 - go to that stack overflow you have to
08:43 - ask questions
08:45 - you have to do everything
08:48 - yourself if you want to be a good coder
08:51 - so this attitude is also very important
08:54 - self learning attitude so see some
08:56 - students blame your you know their
08:57 - faculties they don't teach you well
09:00 - so
09:01 - at some point of time it's a maybe you
09:03 - can also think is a plus point for you
09:06 - then you learn yourself and that will
09:08 - increase your self-learning ability and
09:11 - that would also be and it's not for
09:13 - coding nowadays every student should
09:15 - have self-learning attitude right if you
09:17 - want to learn any new technology
09:19 - obviously
09:20 - in college they'll teach you right but
09:23 - after that when you will go to industry
09:25 - when you go to job
09:26 - technology changing rapidly after every
09:29 - you know two to three years five years
09:30 - ten years so
09:32 - if you want to be you know in that
09:36 - industry for a long
09:38 - then if you want to get promoted then
09:40 - obviously you have to increase your
09:42 - skills your skill skill your skill set
09:45 - so you have to learn new technologies
09:48 - yourself there will be no one to teach
09:49 - you
09:50 - right
09:51 - so i think these are some basics and
09:54 - general habits or you can say skills or
09:57 - maybe more precisely if i say this will
09:59 - help you
10:01 - if you want to learn coding or if you
10:03 - have these habits you can say that yeah
10:05 - i can learn coding i can be a good coder
10:07 - right but these are general skills not
10:09 - for coding
10:10 - every student i think should have these
10:12 - type of skills i am not saying that for
10:14 - coding only these are required but if
10:17 - you do anything in your life i guess
10:19 - definitely everyone should have these
10:21 - skills
10:22 - fine
10:23 - and see i haven't taught any obvious you
10:26 - know skill that is obviously if you want
10:27 - to write down subcode obviously you you
10:30 - you know some programming language
10:32 - right
10:33 - otherwise you can't write down code and
10:35 - that is something like if i say i'm
10:36 - hungry
10:39 - you should eat something
10:42 - so if you want to learn if you want to
10:44 - code definitely you need some
10:46 - programming languages
10:48 - those are obvious points so those i
10:50 - haven't discussed i have at starting
10:52 - only i have told you i will discuss some
10:54 - general habits only right
10:57 - so i guess if i i have left with
11:00 - something you can tell me in comment box
11:02 - and if you want me to make these kind of
11:04 - videos more you can tell me in comment
11:06 - box you can write down like on which
11:08 - topic i should make videos so now that's
11:11 - it for this video i'll see you in our
11:13 - next video till then bye bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone i hope you all are safe and doing good so in this lecture i am going to discuss with you what are some skills required for coding if you want to learn to code what skills you should have or these are some general skills i am not going to discuss these you know skills or these habits more precisely if i say these are habits these are really helpful in your real life also not in just coding in your real life you should have these habits right so maybe for some students skill is like a high level word so they are like oh my god skills no these are some habits general habits i am not going to discuss these points these habits from the perspective of those programming languages or tech aspects no these are general habits i think everybody is having these kind of habits so if you are having these habits definitely you can be a good coder you can learn coding right so now first thing is you should be curious like whenever you see something you have questions in your mind right it's not like that uh like if you are you know going to any shopping websites how those shopping websites are working whenever you go to your gmail account you fill your user id your password whenever you click that login button your gmail id will be opened how this is working what is the process behind the scene you are interested behind the process what is going on behind the scene not whatever you can see like whenever you you know any faculty teach you any topic so you are curious about that thing it's not like that they are teaching okay fine ma'am we got it no you should have the capability you should have the capability of you know cross questioning you should be curious at that time like whenever let's take a simple example whenever uh any concept i am teaching like areas i'm teaching then your first question would be why aries why we are studying arrays these kind of questions you should be curious like if you are playing any game computer game you should have in you know in your mind that how someone has written you know the code how you are able to play those games what is you know behind the scene i also want to make these kind of games or if you are working any if you are using any app like paytm how this app is working any shopping website how these apps are working right so are you having this capability like are you curious or someone will tell you this thing okay fine someone will tell you this thing okay fine you are not curious about anything right so if you want to learn coding if you want to be a good coder then definitely you have to be curious right and this habit will ultimately lead to what critical thinking skill logical thinking skill analytical skill and these skills are required obviously if you want to learn coding you should think logically you should have critical thinking right if i will say in that tech aspects or i i you i you know if i use those bigger terms but this will ultimately lead to those skills first of all you have a habit of this you should be curious second very important point is what patience you should have patience nowadays maybe you are you think that everybody wants to learn everything quickly but it's not like that you can learn coding in just 21 days it's not that kind of habit it needs practice years of practice actually for to be a good coder right so you have to be patient you just have to calm down you have to be very focused right towards your whatever you are doing whatever you are learning right because whenever you start learning coding many times you will get depressed you will feel demoralized right you will feel like i can't do coding i'm not able to write down a sing simple program how will i i'll write those you know complicated type of program today those data structure programs how i'll make a software or these kind of things okay slowly you will do that those things also but at starting everybody is going to know everybody go through that phase if someone is a good coder right now they have also started from zero right they were also at that level and if you will have patience obviously you will not give up easily right and that is very much required skill if you want to learn coding right because it's not easy to learn how to code right obviously it would be a tough process at starting you will do definitely you will do silly mistakes like while writing header file you will write s t u d i o dot it's not stdio dot h and when you will check the program i'm damn sure you will not able to find out those single those simple errors those silly mistake and then you will get frustrated you will not able to read those error messages like which kind of error is this in which line this is the error and this is also a skill to read those error messages find out yeah in this line this is the error that is also skill and it also required practice right but at starting you will not able to find out a simple error right but yeah it happens with everyone just practice just keep patience calm down focus if you are frustrated take a break then again write code that is the only way there is no shortcut right third thing which is very important is you should be selfmotivated person see here i am writing selfmotivated it's not like that you are that kind of student who are watching those motivational videos to get motivation right you have to be a selfmotivated person because many times at starting you will feel demotivated how many times you'll watch those motivated motivational videos and you will just waste your time no see if you are really interested in coding if you think that if you have the idea what is the benefit of coding how coding can improve your life your you know in real life also that coding skill is very much helpful that also you can discuss in a separate video but you have to be a selfmotivated person it's not like that just watch the motivational video and get motivation after 10 days again watch motivational videos and for two days get more to get you know get motivated no if you are interested in learning if you are interested in coding no external motivation would be required to keep learning that is for damn sure it's not for coding only anything for anything if you are interested in that doing that thing no external motivation would be required for doing for learning right if you are really interested so you have to be a selfmotivated person for that next is uh you have the you know ability to sit at one place for at least like two to three hours at least for two to three hours and starting right after that you can obviously after that if you are interested you will automatically you will you know uh will sit for three or four hours or six hours a day and seven hours or a day and you you enjoy i'm damn sure you will enjoy that thing but it's starting maybe some students are like you know they are not able to sit in front of computer for you know half an hour so you have to make this habit yes you can sit in front of your computer for two to three hours at least for you know one and a half hour in starting and you can write down some code so this is also required the skill right next is what you have this attitude selflearning attitude it's not like that always there would be someone to teach you whenever any new technology come or whenever any new language you want to learn there is somebody to teach you you will get notes you will get video tutorials properly you will you know you will be spoonfeeded no technology is changing rapidly so you have to be a selflearner right to learn those changing technologies this skill is also very important self learning skill nobody is going to teach you how to code like sit i'll teach you how to code write down this program right on this program this is there and that is a no you have to sit you have to practice you have to find out the resources from where you can learn from google from any youtube videos you can you have to read documentation you have to go to that maybe for projects maybe for on github you have to go to that stack overflow you have to ask questions you have to do everything yourself if you want to be a good coder so this attitude is also very important self learning attitude so see some students blame your you know their faculties they don't teach you well so at some point of time it's a maybe you can also think is a plus point for you then you learn yourself and that will increase your selflearning ability and that would also be and it's not for coding nowadays every student should have selflearning attitude right if you want to learn any new technology obviously in college they'll teach you right but after that when you will go to industry when you go to job technology changing rapidly after every you know two to three years five years ten years so if you want to be you know in that industry for a long then if you want to get promoted then obviously you have to increase your skills your skill skill your skill set so you have to learn new technologies yourself there will be no one to teach you right so i think these are some basics and general habits or you can say skills or maybe more precisely if i say this will help you if you want to learn coding or if you have these habits you can say that yeah i can learn coding i can be a good coder right but these are general skills not for coding every student i think should have these type of skills i am not saying that for coding only these are required but if you do anything in your life i guess definitely everyone should have these skills fine and see i haven't taught any obvious you know skill that is obviously if you want to write down subcode obviously you you you know some programming language right otherwise you can't write down code and that is something like if i say i'm hungry you should eat something so if you want to learn if you want to code definitely you need some programming languages those are obvious points so those i haven't discussed i have at starting only i have told you i will discuss some general habits only right so i guess if i i have left with something you can tell me in comment box and if you want me to make these kind of videos more you can tell me in comment box you can write down like on which topic i should make videos so now that's it for this video i'll see you in our next video till then bye bye take care
