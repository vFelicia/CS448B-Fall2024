00:00 - so in the series of learning python
00:02 - programming language in the previous
00:03 - video we have talked about you know how
00:06 - to print something on console you know
00:08 - in python
00:09 - or you can say we have written our first
00:11 - program to print hello world fine now in
00:14 - this video we'll see one coding exercise
00:16 - or you can say it is one assignment for
00:18 - you guys okay on print on print function
00:21 - okay
00:22 - now see this is what you need to print
00:25 - exact output i want on the screen on
00:28 - console three lines would be there
00:30 - in first line first program this hyphen
00:33 - python print function then it is
00:34 - declared like this then these columns
00:36 - and
00:38 - print then the single quote would to
00:40 - print exact as it is these three these
00:42 - two lines should be printed on the
00:43 - screen so what you will print how to
00:46 - print
00:47 - so let's pause the video and do this
00:49 - exercise
00:50 - so now i hope you have tried
00:52 - and you have printed that thing so now
00:55 - let's see
00:57 - i'm going to create a new file
00:59 - new
01:00 - file and
01:04 - i'm going to name it exercise 1 dot p y
01:09 - okay
01:10 - now here only i will write down my code
01:14 - so whatever you want to print
01:16 - simply one statement whatever you want
01:19 - to print just write down in print
01:20 - function
01:21 - in these double quotes i have told you
01:23 - okay so the first
01:25 - we have to write down first program
01:28 - first
01:30 - program
01:31 - then this
01:32 - hyphen
01:33 - and
01:35 - python
01:38 - print
01:39 - function
01:41 - okay
01:44 - now in next line i want to print
01:49 - what
01:49 - it is declared like this 3 line i want
01:53 - so it
01:54 - is
01:56 - declared
01:57 - like
01:58 - this
01:59 - and
02:00 - column
02:01 - and we now don't need to put any slash
02:03 - and all for new line because print will
02:05 - give invisible new line character so
02:07 - automatic automatically cursor would be
02:09 - next line so in third line i want to
02:11 - print what as it is print
02:14 - in single quote what to print so
02:16 - whatever that thing put that thing in
02:18 - the this print function
02:20 - print double quotes in this double quote
02:22 - simply write print
02:25 - single quote
02:27 - and
02:29 - what to
02:30 - print
02:32 - single quote
02:33 - bracket close and
02:35 - this
02:36 - i guess that's it
02:38 - let me just run this and show you what
02:40 - output you will get here
02:43 - so it is still printing hello world
02:45 - because
02:46 - from here you have to select current
02:47 - file okay or if you want to run this
02:50 - file
02:51 - so you can one more method is just right
02:53 - click on this and
02:54 - run exercise one so run it and see it is
02:58 - printing as it is what you want to print
03:00 - first program then that the
03:02 - hyphen program python print function it
03:05 - is declared like this print what to
03:07 - print
03:09 - so now i have told you or i guess i
03:11 - haven't told you so let's discuss this
03:14 - thing first
03:15 - so this is the output i want right so
03:18 - now see
03:20 - how to use print function i have told
03:22 - you in previous video hello world if you
03:24 - want to print something just write down
03:26 - that thing into these double quotes the
03:29 - string or the message
03:30 - or in python you can write down this
03:33 - thing the message or the string in
03:36 - single quotation
03:38 - single quote if you write down single
03:40 - quote if you put single quote hello
03:41 - world this will also give you the output
03:43 - hello world
03:44 - same thing double quote or single quote
03:46 - so this is correct in single quote also
03:49 - you can declare print something like
03:51 - this print in single quote whatever you
03:53 - want to print you can write down this
03:54 - thing
03:55 - okay but here one problem is
03:57 - i want to print this line as it is okay
04:00 - so i want to
04:02 - i have to put this line as it is in this
04:04 - print like print
04:06 - and what to print
04:10 - as it is in
04:12 - double quotes okay that is fine it will
04:15 - run
04:16 - okay
04:17 - but if rather than these double quotes
04:20 - here also i want to print these
04:22 - single quotes now it will not run it
04:25 - will give error why so because see
04:28 - for this print function this is opening
04:31 - this
04:32 - you can say single code
04:34 - and this is closing
04:36 - so it will consider this
04:39 - this print and this parenthesis as a
04:42 - string
04:43 - like this you want to print and this
04:45 - what to print
04:48 - it would not be considered as a string
04:50 - after that
04:52 - this
04:53 - it would consider as
04:55 - opening single quote this would be
04:56 - closing single code so this parenthesis
04:58 - would also be considered as
05:00 - string
05:01 - but this would be what
05:03 - code it would not it will not consider
05:05 - this as string so what to print this is
05:07 - what code but what is this code
05:11 - program at the
05:12 - interpreter doesn't know what to code i
05:15 - mean we cannot write down something like
05:16 - this here it is not a correct syntax
05:19 - okay
05:20 - so that is why it will give error so
05:23 - if you want to print on the screen on
05:25 - the output screen these
05:28 - single quotes
05:29 - so better to write down these single
05:31 - quotes better to enclose the single
05:33 - quote in
05:34 - double quote
05:35 - now this would be opening
05:39 - quotes you can say double quotes and
05:41 - this would be considered as
05:43 - closing so whatever you will write down
05:45 - here that would be considered as
05:47 - string
05:49 - okay
05:49 - and if you are writing here single quote
05:52 - so better to write down here
05:54 - within these
05:56 - double quotes
05:57 - okay so now for this print function this
06:00 - is opening this is closing so whatever
06:01 - you will write into here that would be
06:04 - considered as complete as a string i
06:07 - hope you got my point let's just do
06:09 - practical on this thing
06:11 - so let's see this was our exercise one
06:14 - thus we have printed
06:16 - now if i put here
06:19 - rather than this i put single quote
06:24 - okay
06:26 - now better to
06:28 - first of all put double quote here and
06:30 - let me just give you an idea about
06:33 - like
06:34 - first program this line i am putting in
06:36 - single code
06:38 - not double quote okay second line in
06:41 - double quote and third line also in
06:42 - double code so let me just run this and
06:45 - it will give you
06:46 - exact correct output
06:48 - first program this this so you can put
06:50 - the string in double quotes single quote
06:52 - it doesn't care
06:54 - for python both are same okay
06:57 - now if i put here single quote in in
07:00 - this case i want to put here single
07:02 - quote
07:04 - so now see as you can see
07:07 - this print
07:09 - and
07:10 - this opening braces is only green
07:13 - see this complete line is green this
07:15 - complete string this complete string is
07:17 - green
07:18 - okay
07:19 - but this is what what to print is in
07:22 - uh what two is in black and print print
07:27 - is you can see it's a function
07:29 - for this
07:30 - so it is in blue
07:33 - now
07:34 - this what to print is code for this
07:36 - interpreter so
07:38 - what to print it it is not any code like
07:40 - you cannot write down a code something
07:41 - like this it will give syntax error so
07:43 - this is a string
07:45 - this opening closing process braces is a
07:47 - string but this is what a simple code so
07:49 - if i run this
07:51 - then a syntax error you will get because
07:53 - you are not following the rules the
07:55 - syntax of writing a program whatever has
07:57 - been defined in python programming
07:59 - language so it will give syntax error c
08:02 - syntax error invalid syntax perhaps you
08:05 - forgot a comma
08:07 - right
08:08 - see in line number three in line number
08:10 - three this print what to print here
08:14 - it is a syntax error invalid syntax
08:17 - so now
08:19 - you have to put
08:20 - you can do something like this
08:23 - you can do
08:25 - here double quote
08:27 - okay now it would be fine
08:30 - now let me just run this and what it
08:32 - will show on the screen
08:34 - what to print this would be in double
08:35 - quote okay
08:37 - but
08:38 - if you want to print single quote on the
08:40 - screen on the output screen i want to
08:42 - print single quote what to print
08:45 - so
08:46 - you have to put these into double quote
08:50 - outside these you have to put double
08:52 - quote double quote you have to use i
08:54 - hope you are getting my point whatever
08:56 - you want to say
08:57 - now let's just run this and it will
08:59 - print print what to print in single code
09:02 - so the single code double code also you
09:03 - can print on the screen but you have to
09:05 - take care of this thing
09:06 - okay
09:08 - now i guess uh this is clear to you guys
09:12 - so i hope everything about this print
09:13 - function is clear to you guys okay how
09:16 - to use this print what when to put
09:18 - double quote when to put single quote
09:20 - and these kind of things right
09:22 - so in the next video we'll see some uh
09:24 - you know about string manipulations
09:27 - string audio type in uh python that is
09:29 - string that thing will discuss and how
09:31 - to use that kind of type in print that
09:34 - also will see and then according
09:36 - exercise okay so what i will do is first
09:39 - a query one concept query like print we
09:42 - have discussed query and after that one
09:43 - video on the sporting exercise for this
09:45 - print so theory concept plus one video
09:48 - coding exercise of that concept right so
09:51 - now in the next video till then bye bye
09:52 - take care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning python programming language in the previous video we have talked about you know how to print something on console you know in python or you can say we have written our first program to print hello world fine now in this video we'll see one coding exercise or you can say it is one assignment for you guys okay on print on print function okay now see this is what you need to print exact output i want on the screen on console three lines would be there in first line first program this hyphen python print function then it is declared like this then these columns and print then the single quote would to print exact as it is these three these two lines should be printed on the screen so what you will print how to print so let's pause the video and do this exercise so now i hope you have tried and you have printed that thing so now let's see i'm going to create a new file new file and i'm going to name it exercise 1 dot p y okay now here only i will write down my code so whatever you want to print simply one statement whatever you want to print just write down in print function in these double quotes i have told you okay so the first we have to write down first program first program then this hyphen and python print function okay now in next line i want to print what it is declared like this 3 line i want so it is declared like this and column and we now don't need to put any slash and all for new line because print will give invisible new line character so automatic automatically cursor would be next line so in third line i want to print what as it is print in single quote what to print so whatever that thing put that thing in the this print function print double quotes in this double quote simply write print single quote and what to print single quote bracket close and this i guess that's it let me just run this and show you what output you will get here so it is still printing hello world because from here you have to select current file okay or if you want to run this file so you can one more method is just right click on this and run exercise one so run it and see it is printing as it is what you want to print first program then that the hyphen program python print function it is declared like this print what to print so now i have told you or i guess i haven't told you so let's discuss this thing first so this is the output i want right so now see how to use print function i have told you in previous video hello world if you want to print something just write down that thing into these double quotes the string or the message or in python you can write down this thing the message or the string in single quotation single quote if you write down single quote if you put single quote hello world this will also give you the output hello world same thing double quote or single quote so this is correct in single quote also you can declare print something like this print in single quote whatever you want to print you can write down this thing okay but here one problem is i want to print this line as it is okay so i want to i have to put this line as it is in this print like print and what to print as it is in double quotes okay that is fine it will run okay but if rather than these double quotes here also i want to print these single quotes now it will not run it will give error why so because see for this print function this is opening this you can say single code and this is closing so it will consider this this print and this parenthesis as a string like this you want to print and this what to print it would not be considered as a string after that this it would consider as opening single quote this would be closing single code so this parenthesis would also be considered as string but this would be what code it would not it will not consider this as string so what to print this is what code but what is this code program at the interpreter doesn't know what to code i mean we cannot write down something like this here it is not a correct syntax okay so that is why it will give error so if you want to print on the screen on the output screen these single quotes so better to write down these single quotes better to enclose the single quote in double quote now this would be opening quotes you can say double quotes and this would be considered as closing so whatever you will write down here that would be considered as string okay and if you are writing here single quote so better to write down here within these double quotes okay so now for this print function this is opening this is closing so whatever you will write into here that would be considered as complete as a string i hope you got my point let's just do practical on this thing so let's see this was our exercise one thus we have printed now if i put here rather than this i put single quote okay now better to first of all put double quote here and let me just give you an idea about like first program this line i am putting in single code not double quote okay second line in double quote and third line also in double code so let me just run this and it will give you exact correct output first program this this so you can put the string in double quotes single quote it doesn't care for python both are same okay now if i put here single quote in in this case i want to put here single quote so now see as you can see this print and this opening braces is only green see this complete line is green this complete string this complete string is green okay but this is what what to print is in uh what two is in black and print print is you can see it's a function for this so it is in blue now this what to print is code for this interpreter so what to print it it is not any code like you cannot write down a code something like this it will give syntax error so this is a string this opening closing process braces is a string but this is what a simple code so if i run this then a syntax error you will get because you are not following the rules the syntax of writing a program whatever has been defined in python programming language so it will give syntax error c syntax error invalid syntax perhaps you forgot a comma right see in line number three in line number three this print what to print here it is a syntax error invalid syntax so now you have to put you can do something like this you can do here double quote okay now it would be fine now let me just run this and what it will show on the screen what to print this would be in double quote okay but if you want to print single quote on the screen on the output screen i want to print single quote what to print so you have to put these into double quote outside these you have to put double quote double quote you have to use i hope you are getting my point whatever you want to say now let's just run this and it will print print what to print in single code so the single code double code also you can print on the screen but you have to take care of this thing okay now i guess uh this is clear to you guys so i hope everything about this print function is clear to you guys okay how to use this print what when to put double quote when to put single quote and these kind of things right so in the next video we'll see some uh you know about string manipulations string audio type in uh python that is string that thing will discuss and how to use that kind of type in print that also will see and then according exercise okay so what i will do is first a query one concept query like print we have discussed query and after that one video on the sporting exercise for this print so theory concept plus one video coding exercise of that concept right so now in the next video till then bye bye take care
