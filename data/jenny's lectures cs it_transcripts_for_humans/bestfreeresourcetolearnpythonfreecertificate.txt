03:04 - start click on start learning you will
03:06 - get a copy something like this now let
03:08 - me show you the modules here in this
03:10 - path you will get total 11 modules right
03:13 - so in the first module first of all
03:15 - introduction introduction introduction
03:16 - to python nodes plus practice question
03:18 - notes plus mcqs so once you click on the
03:21 - first one introduction see you will get
03:23 - notes introduction to Python and all
03:25 - right
03:26 - see introduction to python how to get
03:28 - started with python how to download
03:30 - python python comment this then mcqs
03:34 - then questions on all the topics covered
03:36 - till now
03:38 - on these you will get these mcqs right
03:41 - so you can
03:43 - select your answer and you can go for
03:45 - submit and next right
03:47 - like this in each module this kind of
03:50 - thing you will get first notes then
03:53 - the mcqs and practice problems and
03:56 - second module variables and data types
03:57 - like introduction to variables and data
03:59 - types variables in memory scope of
04:01 - variables type casting and then
04:03 - uh practice questions also so let me
04:06 - just click on this attempt first then
04:09 - variables introduction to variables the
04:11 - nodes then data types nodes right then
04:15 - questions valid variable names mcqs on
04:19 - this topic then we will do variable
04:21 - names second part then on data types
04:22 - also then Theory variables in memory
04:26 - theory part here variables in memory
04:28 - right
04:30 - you can click on this and you will find
04:31 - out this then scope of variables
04:33 - variable scope local scope Global scope
04:36 - and then
04:37 - mcqs on these topics covered like this
04:40 - for each
04:42 - module you will get this kind of pattern
04:45 - right
04:47 - so next module is basic input output in
04:49 - Python like what is the Sprint statement
04:52 - how to take input from user then
04:54 - practice problems see
04:56 - let me just click on these practice
04:58 - problems here you have to write down
04:59 - code C
05:00 - first is find area of rectangle you will
05:04 - click on this right and this is the
05:06 - problem statement take the input take
05:09 - the length and breadth as input and find
05:11 - the area so you can write down your
05:14 - program here you can just select the
05:17 - language obviously you are learning
05:18 - python so you will select Python and you
05:20 - can write down your code here then you
05:21 - can submit your code right like this you
05:24 - will get practice problems print name
05:26 - and a swap two numbers calculate simple
05:28 - interest these kind of things
05:31 - and after that in fourth module
05:34 - operators in Python all the type of
05:36 - operators 30 plus mcqs plus practice
05:39 - problems as well then conditional
05:42 - statements and Loops same conditional
05:44 - statements then Loops then break
05:45 - continue pass return statement then
05:47 - practice problems right mcqs Plus at
05:49 - last practice problems as well you have
05:51 - to write on programs then functions in
05:54 - Python types of function function
05:56 - overloading scope of variables
05:57 - everything
05:59 - then list in Python you will get like
06:02 - this in each module then string then
06:04 - object oriented
06:06 - oops Concept in Python Constructor then
06:09 - inheritance and then you can say
06:11 - polymorphism abstraction these things
06:13 - then exception had exception handling in
06:15 - Python right and then
06:19 - in the last module 11th module
