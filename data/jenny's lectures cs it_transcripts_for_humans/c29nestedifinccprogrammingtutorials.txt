With timestamps:

00:00 - in the series of learning programming in
00:01 - c we are discussing about control
00:03 - statements in c in the previous videos i
00:04 - have discussed if statement and fl
00:06 - statements complete means the in detail
00:09 - from the the structure of those if and
00:11 - if else statements with the program we
00:12 - have discussed how to use those
00:13 - statements and some you know what kind
00:15 - of questions can be formed using if and
00:17 - if else statements and what errors you
00:20 - uh you can do the beginners can do while
00:21 - writing those statements in program so
00:23 - everything we have discussed about those
00:25 - statements now in this video i'll be
00:26 - talking about nested if statements
00:28 - everything about nested if general
00:30 - syntax of writing nested how to use this
00:32 - statement the structure of the nested if
00:34 - using flowchart as well as we will take
00:36 - a program and we'll see the output of
00:38 - that program when in that program we are
00:40 - going to use nested if statement so
00:42 - everything will be will be discussing
00:45 - in this video about a nested so now let
00:47 - us discuss about nested if it is what
00:49 - nesting of if means
00:51 - within if we can use another if like
00:53 - this
00:54 - there is one f
00:56 - what is the syntax of writing if here we
00:59 - are writing some conditions right and if
01:01 - the condition is true then the control
01:03 - will go within this if blow so within
01:05 - this if again we can write another if
01:08 - suppose here i am writing condition 1
01:10 - and condition
01:11 - 2
01:12 - again if you want to write again you can
01:14 - write here if condition 3 if condition 4
01:16 - like this up to n
01:18 - it's not like that you can only write 2
01:20 - if nesting if you can do multiple you
01:22 - know you can write multiple if means one
01:25 - if within if then in this one more if
01:27 - then in that one more if like this so
01:29 - i'm writing just two f just to make you
01:31 - understand and
01:33 - now
01:33 - inner if block statement this i am
01:36 - considering as outer if this i am
01:37 - considering as inner if right i am just
01:39 - taking a 2 if you can take multiple if
01:42 - also so now if this condition 1 is true
01:44 - then only control will go
01:46 - in this block and then only this
01:48 - condition would be checked and if this
01:51 - condition is true then control will go
01:53 - within this if block and these
01:55 - statements would be executed i am
01:56 - writing this curly braces because i am
01:58 - writing here inner if block statements
01:59 - means multiple statements if one
02:01 - statement is there then you can remove
02:02 - you can remove these curly braces right
02:05 - and it's not like that you can only
02:06 - write f here with this f you can also
02:09 - write
02:10 - else right
02:11 - and here you can write
02:13 - inner else block statement
02:17 - that's it and now you can close this f
02:19 - right and after that this is if with
02:22 - this if you can write
02:24 - else for this f right and here you can
02:26 - write down some you can say outer else
02:30 - block statements
02:32 - and after this if else block suppose i
02:34 - am writing in a program you can say
02:36 - statement
02:37 - suppose i am writing x
02:39 - right so now what is the working of this
02:41 - see you can write down this multiple if
02:43 - you know in many ways if you will not
02:46 - write this else you can skip the cells
02:48 - you can simply write if and only if
02:51 - means one if no else and here also you
02:53 - can skip this cell that is also fine or
02:55 - you can write down else and here also
02:56 - for this if you can write down else that
02:58 - is
02:59 - uh fine you can write down this nesting
03:01 - of f
03:02 - in multiple ways right or you can call
03:04 - it nested if else because i am writing
03:07 - if else within this fl block so now this
03:11 - condition would be checked only if this
03:13 - condition is true if this condition is
03:15 - false then control will not go within
03:17 - this block within this if block and
03:20 - directly control will go to this else
03:21 - blue right like you can take that
03:23 - example
03:25 - if you go to supermarket then what
03:29 - if oranges are available by oranges
03:32 - this condition you can write down in if
03:35 - block like like this
03:36 - if
03:39 - like this
03:40 - if go to supermarket then
03:43 - again check if orange is available buy
03:45 - oranges right
03:46 - if you don't go to supermarket then
03:49 - obviously you cannot check the oranges
03:51 - are available or not in the supermarket
03:53 - for that you have to go to supermarket
03:56 - so that is why to execute to check this
03:58 - condition first of all this condition
03:59 - should be true you have to go to
04:00 - supermarket then only you can check
04:02 - orange these are available or not or
04:04 - within this if again you can write one
04:06 - more if like if
04:08 - suppose good oranges
04:10 - then only buy
04:16 - right otherwise no need to buy so for
04:18 - this opening curly braces this is
04:20 - closing for this this is closing and for
04:22 - this this is closing brakes braces this
04:24 - mistake generally students do please
04:26 - take care of this thing for every
04:27 - opening braces there should be a closing
04:29 - braces right
04:30 - so to check this condition first of all
04:32 - what condition
04:33 - should be true this condition obviously
04:36 - right
04:37 - then this condition must be true means
04:39 - oranges should be available there then
04:40 - only you can check oranges are good or
04:42 - bad right then you can check this
04:44 - condition and then you will buy it right
04:46 - it means
04:47 - to check this condition to go to check
04:49 - the inner if condition the outer if
04:50 - condition must be true here right so
04:53 - this is what the general structure of
04:55 - writing is the syntax of writing nested
04:57 - if if you write a flow chart then how
05:00 - you can draw that flow chart of this if
05:02 - necessary if condition
05:06 - and see it is not always necessary to
05:08 - write
05:09 - to if
05:11 - even one if you can write and just you
05:14 - you can do your
05:15 - task how you can do that task how rather
05:18 - than these two if i can write a single
05:20 - if and that will work same as the two if
05:23 - for working next yesterday for working
05:25 - that we will discuss in with the help of
05:27 - an example with the help of a program
05:28 - first of all uh let me draw a flowchart
05:31 - of this thing then this is
05:33 - programming executing now first of all
05:35 - we
05:36 - check we got first condition
05:38 - condition 1
05:40 - right
05:41 - now if this condition is true
05:44 - then only true means this condition
05:47 - would be checked again one more
05:49 - condition that is
05:50 - condition 2
05:53 - right
05:54 - if this condition is true then this
05:56 - block would be executed so if this is
05:59 - true
06:00 - then what should be executed
06:02 - in a if block statement
06:11 - right
06:12 - and suppose if this condition is true
06:14 - and this has been executed
06:16 - so now where the control will go control
06:18 - will not go to the cells right control
06:20 - will not go to the cells because already
06:22 - this condition is true so after that
06:24 - control will go out of this if and else
06:26 - block that is statement x or any
06:28 - statement that as part of that program
06:30 - would be executed and those statements
06:32 - are not part of this this if else blow
06:34 - so i i would say statement x would be
06:36 - executed here
06:43 - and if
06:44 - this condition is false the first
06:46 - condition is false then
06:48 - control will not enter into this if
06:50 - block right control will directly go to
06:52 - this else block right because either
06:55 - this would be executed or this would be
06:56 - executed right
06:58 - now
06:59 - no condition would be checked here now
07:01 - what would be executed
07:04 - outer else block condition right outer o
07:06 - means outer else block b4 block and
07:10 - statements
07:14 - and after this this statement would be
07:16 - executed that is this x would be
07:17 - executed
07:19 - this would be the flow of this one and
07:21 - if suppose we have one one more
07:23 - condition here if condition three then
07:25 - what happened if this condition is true
07:27 - then again we will check one more
07:28 - condition condition three right
07:31 - i think you got the idea of the flow
07:33 - chart and the working of this nested if
07:35 - so let me write down a program now
07:41 - so here i want to check
07:43 - i'm just entering age and salary of the
07:45 - employees in any company or any college
07:48 - and i want to check
07:49 - if age is greater than 50 right
07:52 - then check
07:54 - if salary of those candidates whose a's
07:57 - are greater than 6 greater than 50 if
07:59 - salary is less than
08:01 - 60 k then increment would be 10 000
08:05 - if salary is
08:06 - greater than 60 k then increment would
08:08 - be 5 000
08:10 - and if age is
08:12 - less than 50 then increment would be i
08:15 - suppose uh 3000
08:17 - so now first of all check if age is
08:20 - greater than 50
08:23 - now for all the candidates for all the
08:25 - you know faculties
08:27 - whose age is greater than 50
08:29 - you have to check if
08:31 - salary is greater than sorry salary is
08:34 - greater than or less than
08:36 - you can write less than
08:39 - 60 k right
08:42 - then what you want
08:46 - salary would be incremented
08:50 - 10 000
08:51 - right
08:53 - otherwise
08:55 - if age is greater than 50 but salary is
08:57 - greater than 60 k then
09:02 - salary would be incremented as
09:05 - with
09:06 - 5000
09:08 - right and now end of this if
09:11 - and if age is less than 50 means age is
09:14 - not greater than 50 then salary would be
09:16 - incremented as
09:17 - after this if
09:18 - i'm not writing here because i guess you
09:20 - cannot see this i am writing this else
09:22 - here
09:24 - for this if else is this one else salary
09:30 - would be incremented with 3 000 rupees
09:32 - right and after this if else i am
09:35 - writing what
09:36 - suppose printf
09:41 - end of program
09:45 - and that's it you can write here get
09:47 - search and you can include clrser and
09:49 - that header file also right so now this
09:51 - is what nesting of if one if
09:54 - within this if i'm writing another if
09:56 - right
09:57 - so suppose this is our output screen
09:59 - when you enter
10:01 - when you run this program this is our
10:02 - output screen and you will be asked
10:04 - enter agent salary and suppose i am
10:06 - entering age is equal to
10:08 - 53
10:10 - right and salary i am
10:14 - writing about 45 000
10:17 - so now first of all this would be
10:18 - checked
10:19 - 53 age is greater than 50 yes this is
10:22 - true now control will go to this block
10:25 - salary less than 60 k
10:27 - salary less than 60k yes this condition
10:29 - is also true now salary would be
10:31 - incremented with 10 000 and here you can
10:34 - print salary right means that what would
10:36 - be printed here if you print salary here
10:39 - 55 000
10:40 - right suppose and this else would not be
10:43 - executed this helps would not be
10:44 - executed right i hope you know the
10:46 - working why i am saying this and now
10:47 - after if what should we would you
10:49 - printed printf end of program suppose i
10:51 - am writing
10:52 - age is 53 but salary is
10:56 - 70k
10:57 - now this condition is true now control
10:59 - will go here salary less than 60 k
11:01 - no it is greater than 60 k so now this
11:04 - if statement would not be executed now
11:05 - control will go to this else for this if
11:08 - this is this else now salary would be
11:10 - incremented by 5000 and you can print
11:12 - salary here
11:13 - now what output you will get 75 000 and
11:16 - after that the cells would not be
11:17 - executed and you will get a root end of
11:19 - program
11:20 - right and suppose i am entering age is
11:21 - equal to 45
11:23 - and salary is 70 k now
11:26 - this condition would be checked a is
11:28 - greater than 50 no
11:30 - so control will not go here this
11:32 - condition would not be checked in this
11:33 - case directly control will go to this
11:35 - else blow and salary would be
11:37 - incremented by 3000 and suppose you are
11:40 - printing the salary here then output you
11:41 - will get 73 k
11:43 - right and after that end of program
11:45 - now rather than writing this 2 if
11:48 - can we write down these two conditions
11:50 - in a single if yes you can write how you
11:53 - can write using logical end operator
11:57 - here you can write what
11:59 - if a is greater than 50 and
12:04 - salary less than
12:06 - 60 k
12:08 - in that case no need to write down this
12:10 - if because i am checking both the
12:12 - condition in one statement only
12:14 - right
12:15 - and
12:16 - here directly you can write salary would
12:18 - be incremented in this case 10 000 else
12:21 - salary would be incremented 5000 and
12:23 - this else would be same
12:25 - yes you can write down these two if in a
12:27 - single if right and in this one more
12:29 - than one condition we can also check
12:31 - it's not like that we can only check two
12:33 - condition three condition four condition
12:35 - five condition just write down logical
12:37 - end one more condition logical and one
12:38 - more condition logical and one more
12:40 - condition
12:40 - it's up to you how many conditions you
12:42 - want to check
12:43 - right so that is just give you an idea
12:46 - that what is working of nest and nested
12:48 - if and rather than nesting if you can
12:50 - write down logical and operator and you
12:51 - can write down a single f also right so
12:54 - now i hope you got the idea about this
12:56 - thing now assignment for you is
12:59 - you have to take what
13:00 - three numbers
13:02 - and you have to find out maximum among
13:04 - three numbers right and you
13:07 - need to solve that program using nested
13:09 - if you cannot use this logical and
13:12 - operator you have to solve using this
13:14 - nested if so this is you can say a
13:16 - challenge for you
13:17 - so you can write down in comment box
13:19 - that you are going to solve it or not
13:20 - and if you have solved it then you can
13:22 - tell me in comment box and um if you
13:24 - want then you can send me that program
13:26 - or that screenshot of that program on my
13:28 - instagram account right so now that's it
13:30 - about nested if and here also suppose i
13:33 - am not using this end this is a you know
13:36 - video to get you familiar with nested if
13:39 - so i am writing this f here
13:41 - and if you suppose right here semicolon
13:43 - then it will give error right because if
13:45 - you are terminating this if and for if
13:47 - this if you are writing the cells so you
13:48 - will get an error misplaced else or else
13:51 - without a previous f so you cannot
13:52 - terminate this f you cannot terminate
13:54 - here this if because here also you are
13:56 - writing a
13:57 - else right
13:59 - so you need to take care of this thing
14:00 - and you can do your own like you are
14:03 - writing a program and just put a
14:04 - semicolon here and see what output you
14:06 - are getting
14:08 - do and
14:09 - don't write this else and then put a
14:11 - semicolon then check what output you are
14:14 - getting or at this here you can put
14:17 - semicolon and check what output you are
14:19 - getting
14:20 - with this else and suppose if you are
14:21 - not writing this else in that case you
14:23 - are writing semicolon at that time what
14:25 - output you will get right
14:26 - so check out the you know try to do some
14:29 - experiments with these programs and with
14:31 - these things and try to you know make
14:34 - small small programs with these
14:35 - experiments then only you will get
14:37 - familiar with these concepts and you
14:38 - don't have to really memorize these
14:40 - things you will understand these things
14:43 - if you are familiar if you you know do
14:45 - some practice with hands-on do some
14:47 - practice and some write down some
14:49 - programs on these things and better to
14:51 - write down programs with pen and paper
14:53 - first of all dry run that program and
14:55 - then switch to then jump to your laptop
14:57 - right so now that's it about nested if
14:59 - in the next video i'm going to talk
15:00 - about elsif letter statement so now i'll
15:03 - see in the next video till then bye take
15:05 - care

Cleaned transcript:

in the series of learning programming in c we are discussing about control statements in c in the previous videos i have discussed if statement and fl statements complete means the in detail from the the structure of those if and if else statements with the program we have discussed how to use those statements and some you know what kind of questions can be formed using if and if else statements and what errors you uh you can do the beginners can do while writing those statements in program so everything we have discussed about those statements now in this video i'll be talking about nested if statements everything about nested if general syntax of writing nested how to use this statement the structure of the nested if using flowchart as well as we will take a program and we'll see the output of that program when in that program we are going to use nested if statement so everything will be will be discussing in this video about a nested so now let us discuss about nested if it is what nesting of if means within if we can use another if like this there is one f what is the syntax of writing if here we are writing some conditions right and if the condition is true then the control will go within this if blow so within this if again we can write another if suppose here i am writing condition 1 and condition 2 again if you want to write again you can write here if condition 3 if condition 4 like this up to n it's not like that you can only write 2 if nesting if you can do multiple you know you can write multiple if means one if within if then in this one more if then in that one more if like this so i'm writing just two f just to make you understand and now inner if block statement this i am considering as outer if this i am considering as inner if right i am just taking a 2 if you can take multiple if also so now if this condition 1 is true then only control will go in this block and then only this condition would be checked and if this condition is true then control will go within this if block and these statements would be executed i am writing this curly braces because i am writing here inner if block statements means multiple statements if one statement is there then you can remove you can remove these curly braces right and it's not like that you can only write f here with this f you can also write else right and here you can write inner else block statement that's it and now you can close this f right and after that this is if with this if you can write else for this f right and here you can write down some you can say outer else block statements and after this if else block suppose i am writing in a program you can say statement suppose i am writing x right so now what is the working of this see you can write down this multiple if you know in many ways if you will not write this else you can skip the cells you can simply write if and only if means one if no else and here also you can skip this cell that is also fine or you can write down else and here also for this if you can write down else that is uh fine you can write down this nesting of f in multiple ways right or you can call it nested if else because i am writing if else within this fl block so now this condition would be checked only if this condition is true if this condition is false then control will not go within this block within this if block and directly control will go to this else blue right like you can take that example if you go to supermarket then what if oranges are available by oranges this condition you can write down in if block like like this if like this if go to supermarket then again check if orange is available buy oranges right if you don't go to supermarket then obviously you cannot check the oranges are available or not in the supermarket for that you have to go to supermarket so that is why to execute to check this condition first of all this condition should be true you have to go to supermarket then only you can check orange these are available or not or within this if again you can write one more if like if suppose good oranges then only buy right otherwise no need to buy so for this opening curly braces this is closing for this this is closing and for this this is closing brakes braces this mistake generally students do please take care of this thing for every opening braces there should be a closing braces right so to check this condition first of all what condition should be true this condition obviously right then this condition must be true means oranges should be available there then only you can check oranges are good or bad right then you can check this condition and then you will buy it right it means to check this condition to go to check the inner if condition the outer if condition must be true here right so this is what the general structure of writing is the syntax of writing nested if if you write a flow chart then how you can draw that flow chart of this if necessary if condition and see it is not always necessary to write to if even one if you can write and just you you can do your task how you can do that task how rather than these two if i can write a single if and that will work same as the two if for working next yesterday for working that we will discuss in with the help of an example with the help of a program first of all uh let me draw a flowchart of this thing then this is programming executing now first of all we check we got first condition condition 1 right now if this condition is true then only true means this condition would be checked again one more condition that is condition 2 right if this condition is true then this block would be executed so if this is true then what should be executed in a if block statement right and suppose if this condition is true and this has been executed so now where the control will go control will not go to the cells right control will not go to the cells because already this condition is true so after that control will go out of this if and else block that is statement x or any statement that as part of that program would be executed and those statements are not part of this this if else blow so i i would say statement x would be executed here and if this condition is false the first condition is false then control will not enter into this if block right control will directly go to this else block right because either this would be executed or this would be executed right now no condition would be checked here now what would be executed outer else block condition right outer o means outer else block b4 block and statements and after this this statement would be executed that is this x would be executed this would be the flow of this one and if suppose we have one one more condition here if condition three then what happened if this condition is true then again we will check one more condition condition three right i think you got the idea of the flow chart and the working of this nested if so let me write down a program now so here i want to check i'm just entering age and salary of the employees in any company or any college and i want to check if age is greater than 50 right then check if salary of those candidates whose a's are greater than 6 greater than 50 if salary is less than 60 k then increment would be 10 000 if salary is greater than 60 k then increment would be 5 000 and if age is less than 50 then increment would be i suppose uh 3000 so now first of all check if age is greater than 50 now for all the candidates for all the you know faculties whose age is greater than 50 you have to check if salary is greater than sorry salary is greater than or less than you can write less than 60 k right then what you want salary would be incremented 10 000 right otherwise if age is greater than 50 but salary is greater than 60 k then salary would be incremented as with 5000 right and now end of this if and if age is less than 50 means age is not greater than 50 then salary would be incremented as after this if i'm not writing here because i guess you cannot see this i am writing this else here for this if else is this one else salary would be incremented with 3 000 rupees right and after this if else i am writing what suppose printf end of program and that's it you can write here get search and you can include clrser and that header file also right so now this is what nesting of if one if within this if i'm writing another if right so suppose this is our output screen when you enter when you run this program this is our output screen and you will be asked enter agent salary and suppose i am entering age is equal to 53 right and salary i am writing about 45 000 so now first of all this would be checked 53 age is greater than 50 yes this is true now control will go to this block salary less than 60 k salary less than 60k yes this condition is also true now salary would be incremented with 10 000 and here you can print salary right means that what would be printed here if you print salary here 55 000 right suppose and this else would not be executed this helps would not be executed right i hope you know the working why i am saying this and now after if what should we would you printed printf end of program suppose i am writing age is 53 but salary is 70k now this condition is true now control will go here salary less than 60 k no it is greater than 60 k so now this if statement would not be executed now control will go to this else for this if this is this else now salary would be incremented by 5000 and you can print salary here now what output you will get 75 000 and after that the cells would not be executed and you will get a root end of program right and suppose i am entering age is equal to 45 and salary is 70 k now this condition would be checked a is greater than 50 no so control will not go here this condition would not be checked in this case directly control will go to this else blow and salary would be incremented by 3000 and suppose you are printing the salary here then output you will get 73 k right and after that end of program now rather than writing this 2 if can we write down these two conditions in a single if yes you can write how you can write using logical end operator here you can write what if a is greater than 50 and salary less than 60 k in that case no need to write down this if because i am checking both the condition in one statement only right and here directly you can write salary would be incremented in this case 10 000 else salary would be incremented 5000 and this else would be same yes you can write down these two if in a single if right and in this one more than one condition we can also check it's not like that we can only check two condition three condition four condition five condition just write down logical end one more condition logical and one more condition logical and one more condition it's up to you how many conditions you want to check right so that is just give you an idea that what is working of nest and nested if and rather than nesting if you can write down logical and operator and you can write down a single f also right so now i hope you got the idea about this thing now assignment for you is you have to take what three numbers and you have to find out maximum among three numbers right and you need to solve that program using nested if you cannot use this logical and operator you have to solve using this nested if so this is you can say a challenge for you so you can write down in comment box that you are going to solve it or not and if you have solved it then you can tell me in comment box and um if you want then you can send me that program or that screenshot of that program on my instagram account right so now that's it about nested if and here also suppose i am not using this end this is a you know video to get you familiar with nested if so i am writing this f here and if you suppose right here semicolon then it will give error right because if you are terminating this if and for if this if you are writing the cells so you will get an error misplaced else or else without a previous f so you cannot terminate this f you cannot terminate here this if because here also you are writing a else right so you need to take care of this thing and you can do your own like you are writing a program and just put a semicolon here and see what output you are getting do and don't write this else and then put a semicolon then check what output you are getting or at this here you can put semicolon and check what output you are getting with this else and suppose if you are not writing this else in that case you are writing semicolon at that time what output you will get right so check out the you know try to do some experiments with these programs and with these things and try to you know make small small programs with these experiments then only you will get familiar with these concepts and you don't have to really memorize these things you will understand these things if you are familiar if you you know do some practice with handson do some practice and some write down some programs on these things and better to write down programs with pen and paper first of all dry run that program and then switch to then jump to your laptop right so now that's it about nested if in the next video i'm going to talk about elsif letter statement so now i'll see in the next video till then bye take care
