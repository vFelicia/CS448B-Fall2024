00:17 - hi hi hi so today I'm here to discuss
00:30 - the very frequently asked question to me
00:33 - and that is very simple that how to
00:36 - watch my reviews to get blessed of it
00:40 - right
00:40 - see I need starting I have created one
00:44 - playlist only that is data structure and
00:47 - temples and I just randomly picked the
00:50 - topics important topics and available on
00:53 - those topics but after that I realized
00:55 - that I should start is from the
00:58 - beginning and I should complete it right
01:01 - so now I have almost completed the
01:05 - subject a few topics are remaining to go
01:08 - visa left and see kind of created
01:12 - several playlists for each topic if you
01:17 - go to my channel and check out the
01:20 - playlist of my channel then you will
01:24 - find out before every leg on your
01:26 - created of yeast so first of all I guess
01:29 - if you you you are a beginner in data
01:31 - structure and you want to watch my
01:33 - videos you want to prepare for these
01:35 - from the stand alone
01:36 - then you must watch and he's in a
01:39 - destruction to go to that it is a lead
01:41 - in data structure and there I have stuck
01:44 - in the videos some introduction places
01:46 - introduction to is one da that playlist
01:53 - is in order you can check out that after
01:56 - that you can watch list there also you
01:59 - have discussed all the types of linked
02:02 - lists
02:02 - first of all single named appointment
02:04 - circular doubly secular with all their
02:07 - operations after that you can go to stay
02:12 - in data structure the next a list is
02:15 - giving data structure and in queue who I
02:18 - have left with one topic that style if
02:20 - you are working on a telephone email
02:22 - soon after then do you think about which
02:25 - topic please in data structure increase
02:29 - I guess twenty one two to three videos
02:32 - are there I have a cyst from the
02:35 - beginning of the trees that introduction
02:37 - to trees and need of threes and after
02:39 - that all the types of trees finally be
02:42 - sta dnp3
02:44 - so if a B 3 and B I guess B plus freeze
02:48 - I have a little separate things you can
02:51 - check out that please right and after
02:53 - that red well peas I have uploaded and
02:55 - scaly also I have a weight that was
02:59 - invested many times that my is a loner
03:02 - taking pictures completing of trees when
03:06 - it comes to glass yes I haven't
03:11 - definitely I am sorry for that I have
03:15 - indicated that palest till now but now
03:19 - after that you will find a playlist that
03:22 - the structure and algorithm after that
03:24 - you can go to it presentation DFS DFS
03:32 - minimum spanning trees premise algorithm
03:35 - to find out the shortest distance single
03:40 - source and single estimation like this
03:42 - lifestyle going on for shouldn't better
03:45 - is good right so that's something to
03:49 - watch my playlist ops
03:51 - data structure and algorithm right it
03:53 - means it's not one pas all the way under
03:57 - one I have created separate it is for
04:01 - the dots right so now I hope you voted
04:04 - how much smiley use that is very simple
04:07 - question is but that is frequently asked
04:10 - question second king is in which details
04:17 - videos yeah voice is not here
04:21 - I guess now here a second is very
04:32 - important that is TPMS videos I have see
04:36 - I cannot complete the DBMS with instead
04:39 - of 15 days because someone requested me
04:41 - that is complete DBMS I guess before 24
04:45 - I'm going to show you before 24 but yeah
04:52 - I have some nice hairstyle and nicely
05:13 - thank you so much
05:14 - oh it's number yeah I cannot compete a
05:19 - 24th of numbers right maybe because it's
05:24 - like a 17mm where I can upload one video
05:28 - per a maximum one vu right but not know
05:33 - then they're fine if you own me too even
05:41 - so specific topic on DBMS because there
05:43 - are many videos on TV respond directly
05:45 - Pindar easy research those will use it
05:49 - takes training consoles but if you want
05:52 - me to some specific topic that the more
05:57 - money forth I want a video on this topic
05:59 - man then I can try it but I cannot
06:03 - complete so sorry for that I'm sorry
06:08 - oops giving you even an e KS c c++ d MSM
06:15 - computer it works

06:46 - is so much any topic regarding easy cool
06:52 - do not if you see I don't think so I
06:57 - think this effect electronics subject is
06:59 - there and II see in microprocessor I can
07:02 - upload videos on those subjects not the
07:05 - complete but they are new topics for
07:17 - those I can upload use shells own
07:21 - explanation I already uploaded shellsort
07:25 - explanation why you asked me yeah one
07:29 - case is sorting algorithms sorry like to
07:31 - mention that playlist sorting algorithm
07:34 - also there until it is tender then I
07:36 - have explained all day with us
07:39 - starting from bubble sort bubble
07:42 - selection insertion we mulch he shall
07:46 - count as well as reading with the help
07:51 - of proper example on you explained and
07:54 - with the help of different language
07:56 - right super teaching madam thank you so

18:26 - sir sorry hehe million subjects for the
18:33 - gate way importance of data structure
18:42 - you who are asking to me is right Java
18:46 - data structure something like this see
18:50 - it does structure means world it is just
18:52 - way of organizing the data right in a
18:56 - room also if you have messed it mister
19:00 - everything if you are going to find if
19:02 - you find out if you want to search for
19:05 - unified or something like the sending
19:07 - moocher room is completely messed up

19:20 - easily get anything you know that here
19:23 - is my book here is my cell phone here is
19:26 - this it is - so that is the importance
19:29 - of data structure because we are dealing
19:31 - with data and obviously millions and
19:33 - weekends influence of data so it's
19:36 - better to organize the data that's the
19:39 - importance of data structure that is why
19:41 - we have many data structures so no
19:43 - tsunami depends on to achieve inner
19:44 - structures
19:45 - I cannot say that this is good or this
19:48 - is bad it all depends on many factors
19:50 - like what is your priority which type of
19:52 - operations on your Delta let's say on
19:58 - that basis you can choose whether you
20:00 - should use ready is only my list staff
20:02 - huge tweets something like this right
20:08 - rocket population now from an ID I mean
20:16 - is
20:18 - thank you so much here now from my heart
20:26 - yeah beautiful thank you any plan for
20:31 - pycelle no right now to be very clear
20:36 - I'm not thinking about 510 right I'm
20:40 - sorry I'm just thinking about the
20:44 - subjects which are important even you
20:46 - know but you seen it and video
20:49 - surveillance and I became very good
20:53 - thank you dear
20:56 - light glasses for the essay you want me
21:00 - to teach like okay I'll think about it
21:07 - but I'm not sure that this thing because
21:13 - for teaching you know it's not like that
21:18 - I know everything and just pick one
21:23 - topic and each sometimes it we when you
21:26 - put three days almost prepared all right
21:30 - if it depends on the how complicated the
21:33 - topic is and when I'm going to explain
21:36 - it then it may take around maybe one arm
21:38 - or something like this when I upload a
21:43 - 30 minute it means I have suited for
21:48 - that video around for one hour one hour
21:50 - and 30 minutes from there I ll w and I
21:55 - just upload a 30 minute video so if I
21:59 - too late for one hour one in half I
22:02 - guess that would be politically but
22:06 - that's not opening books
22:11 - what's delayed for this you can good

23:39 - playlist named dynamic program ready I'm
23:42 - sorry it's starting I missed to playlist
23:45 - that is sorting algorithm standard
23:49 - program so after watching or maybe a
23:52 - list of data structures to high level
24:00 - program and if you want me to upload any
24:06 - specific topic on that if any I am are
24:09 - doing that matrix
24:10 - I've change my education because I how
24:12 - you know what I see many comments and
24:15 - any means delighting like meditation
24:19 - topics not working only right you got

26:39 - guys but this book this book are more
26:45 - specific about algorithms over world yes
26:51 - through C and C++ that is one book is I
26:54 - guess that - something that allows for
26:56 - good you can go for that thing if you're
27:00 - good in reading means you have patience
27:03 - and you have time if you have some
27:05 - mathematical background then the best
27:07 - algorithm is you have hardest name many
27:15 - times comment that is you can see the
27:19 - master of algorithms but for reading you
27:29 - have some patience you have time and you
27:33 - have some it's medical background
27:36 - otherwise I because see I also first of
27:45 - all three topics from Horman then I used

28:07 - guys and that is thanks for everything
28:17 - and when I got see is because of you oh
28:19 - and is so much ta discrete mathematics
28:24 - of a I can teach those for that subject
28:29 - awesome
28:32 - what a meaning but you see you have them
28:41 - you're the best dog what did you see by

Cleaned transcript:

hi hi hi so today I'm here to discuss the very frequently asked question to me and that is very simple that how to watch my reviews to get blessed of it right see I need starting I have created one playlist only that is data structure and temples and I just randomly picked the topics important topics and available on those topics but after that I realized that I should start is from the beginning and I should complete it right so now I have almost completed the subject a few topics are remaining to go visa left and see kind of created several playlists for each topic if you go to my channel and check out the playlist of my channel then you will find out before every leg on your created of yeast so first of all I guess if you you you are a beginner in data structure and you want to watch my videos you want to prepare for these from the stand alone then you must watch and he's in a destruction to go to that it is a lead in data structure and there I have stuck in the videos some introduction places introduction to is one da that playlist is in order you can check out that after that you can watch list there also you have discussed all the types of linked lists first of all single named appointment circular doubly secular with all their operations after that you can go to stay in data structure the next a list is giving data structure and in queue who I have left with one topic that style if you are working on a telephone email soon after then do you think about which topic please in data structure increase I guess twenty one two to three videos are there I have a cyst from the beginning of the trees that introduction to trees and need of threes and after that all the types of trees finally be sta dnp3 so if a B 3 and B I guess B plus freeze I have a little separate things you can check out that please right and after that red well peas I have uploaded and scaly also I have a weight that was invested many times that my is a loner taking pictures completing of trees when it comes to glass yes I haven't definitely I am sorry for that I have indicated that palest till now but now after that you will find a playlist that the structure and algorithm after that you can go to it presentation DFS DFS minimum spanning trees premise algorithm to find out the shortest distance single source and single estimation like this lifestyle going on for shouldn't better is good right so that's something to watch my playlist ops data structure and algorithm right it means it's not one pas all the way under one I have created separate it is for the dots right so now I hope you voted how much smiley use that is very simple question is but that is frequently asked question second king is in which details videos yeah voice is not here I guess now here a second is very important that is TPMS videos I have see I cannot complete the DBMS with instead of 15 days because someone requested me that is complete DBMS I guess before 24 I'm going to show you before 24 but yeah I have some nice hairstyle and nicely thank you so much oh it's number yeah I cannot compete a 24th of numbers right maybe because it's like a 17mm where I can upload one video per a maximum one vu right but not know then they're fine if you own me too even so specific topic on DBMS because there are many videos on TV respond directly Pindar easy research those will use it takes training consoles but if you want me to some specific topic that the more money forth I want a video on this topic man then I can try it but I cannot complete so sorry for that I'm sorry oops giving you even an e KS c c++ d MSM computer it works I am working on all the subjects nah nah no I don't have that account here I'm sorry what what you want to ask because I'm getting so many comments that I've got to read out all the comments right now yes tell me I don't know what it was we are grateful thing is so much any topic regarding easy cool do not if you see I don't think so I think this effect electronics subject is there and II see in microprocessor I can upload videos on those subjects not the complete but they are new topics for those I can upload use shells own
