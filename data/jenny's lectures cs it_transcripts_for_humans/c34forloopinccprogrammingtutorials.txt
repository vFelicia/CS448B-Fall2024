With timestamps:

00:00 - and the series of learning programming
00:01 - in c we are discussing about looping
00:03 - statements in C or you can say Loops in
00:05 - C in the previous video I have discussed
00:07 - some basic points about uh Loops like
00:10 - why do you write Loops in your program
00:12 - right the need of looping statement in
00:14 - your program what are exit controlled
00:16 - Loops what are entry controlled Loops
00:18 - some other uh you know important points
00:20 - about loops we have discussed in
00:22 - previous video but now in this video
00:24 - I'll be talking about four loop three
00:25 - type of Loops are there four while and
00:27 - do while so in this video I'll be
00:29 - talking about for Loop in C in detail
00:31 - syntax of for Loop how to write for Loop
00:33 - in your program working of for loop with
00:35 - the help of flowchart as well as with
00:36 - the help of a program and other some
00:38 - other important points also about for
00:40 - Loop right uh like different ways to
00:43 - write for Loops in C fine so every
00:46 - single detail I'll talk in this video
00:48 - about this for Loop in C right so now
00:51 - let us discuss for Loop in C I hope you
00:53 - know why we use Loop in C when you want
00:55 - to execute a statement or many
00:57 - statements multiple times repeatedly
00:59 - then then for that we use looping
01:01 - statement in C so this four is what it
01:04 - is the you know most popular you can say
01:07 - uh loop every programmer use this Loop
01:10 - this is you can say the most popular
01:11 - Loop in C why that also will'll discuss
01:14 - because it is having many advantages
01:17 - rather than that y Loop and do y Loop
01:20 - and this is what entry controlled Loop
01:23 - what is entry controlled Loop please see
01:26 - the previous video in the side but and
01:28 - you will come to know what is entry
01:29 - control Loop so this is entry controlled
01:32 - Loop like while is also entry controlled
01:34 - do while is exit controlled Loop right
01:37 - so now what is first of all see the
01:38 - syntax of writing four Loop in your
01:40 - program four is a keyword simply write
01:43 - you will write four right and in this
01:45 - braces what you will write three
01:47 - Expressions we will write three
01:52 - statements here three Expressions we
01:54 - will write or uh and after every
01:58 - expression semicolon here also so we
01:59 - have semicolon means two semicolon in
02:01 - four Loop these are compulsory to write
02:03 - in four Loop right and after that in
02:05 - curly braces we will write body of the
02:07 - loop mean the statements you want to
02:08 - execute right if you have a single
02:10 - statement then no need to write curly
02:12 - braces if you have multiple statement
02:14 - within this four Loop body then you have
02:16 - to put down put this curly braces now
02:18 - the expression one this is what or you
02:20 - can write here
02:26 - initialization here you can write
02:28 - condition
02:30 - semicolon and here we will write this is
02:33 - what
02:35 - update uh or you can say
02:39 - modify update expression or modify
02:41 - expression or increment or decrement
02:43 - whatever you want to write right see
02:45 - here condition we are checking condition
02:47 - before entering into Loop that is why we
02:49 - know we call it as entry controlled Loop
02:52 - right now see the working of this Loop
02:55 - let me take one example suppose I want
02:57 - to print number from 1 to 10
03:01 - right 1 2 3 4 like this what you can do
03:04 - two ways are there either you can write
03:06 - print f one print f 2 print F 3 and up
03:09 - to n 10 print F you have to use 10 print
03:11 - F statements but it will not look good
03:13 - to write 10 print F statement just to
03:15 - print number one to 10 so what you can
03:17 - do you can write down this with four
03:18 - loop with a loop with any Loop four
03:20 - while or do while so now how you will
03:23 - write four here we are going to
03:26 - initialize right initial for
03:28 - initialization I'm taking a aable
03:30 - I I is it's like you can say girlfriend
03:33 - for Loop that is why generally we use I
03:36 - variable for initialization I or j or k
03:39 - i is equal to I'm initializing this with
03:41 - one somewhere in the program I'm not
03:43 - writing the complete program here right
03:45 - to print one number from 1 to 10 you
03:47 - have to include header files then void
03:49 - main then obviously you have to declare
03:52 - this variable I because we cannot
03:54 - directly use this variable here this is
03:56 - what initialization but before that you
03:57 - have to declare this variable in time
03:59 - your program now condition condition is
04:01 - what you want to print number till 10 so
04:06 - the loop would be executed till I
04:09 - becomes less than equal to 10 right and
04:13 - then I
04:15 - ++ I'm going to increment because I'm
04:18 - going to print 1 2 3 4 like this and
04:21 - within this Loop this body of the loop
04:23 - I'm printing I is equal to percentage D
04:27 - because data type is integer and I'm
04:29 - just printing I that's it right now see
04:32 - the working of this for Loop first is
04:36 - this is what initialization so first I
04:38 - would be initialized in memory in memory
04:41 - I have a variable I and the value of I
04:44 - is now one that's it now this is First
04:49 - Step second step is condition would be
04:52 - checked I less than equal to 10 I is 1
04:55 - and this is 10 1 is less than equal to
04:57 - 10 yes condition is true right
05:00 - now control will not go to the third one
05:02 - increment or decrement the modify
05:04 - expression no now if condition is true
05:06 - control will enter into this for
05:09 - Loop and in this for loop I have written
05:12 - one statement print f i is equal to
05:14 - percentage D so what output you will get
05:16 - I equal to percentage D would be
05:19 - replaced with the first argument that is
05:20 - I value would be fast I value is one one
05:22 - would be printed on your screen and
05:25 - that's it only one statement I have in
05:27 - this for Loop fine now after executing
05:30 - this body of the loop control will go to
05:33 - here now the I value would be updated
05:37 - now here I have I ++ now value becomes
05:41 - two right now again control will go
05:44 - means third is what second this one is
05:47 - third the body of this this body of the
05:50 - loop then this is the fourth step
05:52 - increment or decrement now after fourth
05:55 - again second condition would be checked
05:58 - 2 less than equal 10 yes again control
06:01 - will enter into this Loop what would be
06:04 - printed I is equal to 2 after that again
06:08 - I ++ that is
06:10 - three condition would be checked I is
06:13 - equal to 3 would be printed and like
06:15 - this this is going to be in Loop see
06:18 - this this and this the these statements
06:21 - are executing again and again but this
06:23 - initialization is what only one time
06:27 - this initialization this statement would
06:29 - be ex executed only once that's it these
06:32 - are in Loops right now suppose I value
06:35 - becomes 10 so 10 would be printed again
06:38 - I ++ now at one time I value become 11
06:41 - so 11 less than equal to 10 no condition
06:44 - is false now control will not enter into
06:47 - this for Loop if it is false control
06:50 - will directly go out of
06:52 - this Loop body whatever is there that
06:55 - would be printed suppose I'm printing
06:57 - here I'm writing here print f JK so
07:00 - after printing till 10 JK would be on
07:03 - your screen right so this is what
07:05 - working of this for Loop you have to
07:07 - take care of this point this
07:09 - initialization this statement this
07:11 - expression would be executed only once
07:14 - right this is working of this for loop I
07:17 - hope you uh got the steps of this for
07:20 - Loop let me draw a flowchart for
07:27 - this first is this one
07:30 - initialization that would be executed
07:32 - only once then condition would be
07:34 - checked now if the condition is
07:37 - true then control will enter into this
07:40 - then you can
07:42 - say this body of this this Loop would be
07:46 - executed whatever you have written there
07:48 - then what value this modify or this
07:52 - update
07:53 - expression after modify your update
07:56 - again it will check the condition means
07:58 - again control will go to here check the
08:01 - condition if the condition is true again
08:03 - this is in Loop if here the condition is
08:07 - false then it will not enter into this
08:10 - for Loop and it will go out of this body
08:12 - of the loop if there is print F then
08:15 - that statement would be printed so here
08:17 - it will go so this is what uh in a case
08:19 - of flowchart I have shown the working of
08:21 - this for loop I hope you got this
08:22 - flowchart so sometimes in W they can ask
08:25 - this question how many times this
08:26 - statement would be executed
08:27 - initialization that is only once this is
08:29 - out of this Loop right this is only one
08:32 - time it is not compulsory that you have
08:35 - to uh write down initialize the I value
08:37 - from one here in this case it is
08:40 - compulsory because I want to print 1 to
08:42 - 10 so that is why value would be started
08:44 - from one right but here you can also
08:46 - write I less than 11 that is also fine
08:51 - if you want to print suppose I want to
08:53 - print JK 10 times right so there you can
08:57 - initialize I equal to 0 condition is I
09:01 - less than 10 10 times I less than equal
09:05 - to 9 that is also fine 10 times right I
09:08 - is equal to 2 and I less than equal to
09:11 - should be I think 11 right so let me
09:14 - give you one assignment for you if you
09:16 - got the working of this four Loop then
09:17 - definitely you can answer this now you
09:20 - have to tell me in comment box what
09:21 - output you will get if you are writing
09:23 - for Loop like this I equal to 10 I less
09:24 - than 10 I ++ and print F I'm printing I
09:27 - right now each expression is having its
09:31 - own properties some properties are there
09:33 - you can say some interesting facts about
09:35 - for loop it's not like that you have to
09:37 - write for Loop like this always no there
09:40 - are many ways you can write for Loop
09:42 - this expression this is completely
09:44 - optional you can ignore this you can
09:46 - it's not compulsory to write this in
09:48 - this uh for Loop this is also optional
09:51 - this is also optional so you can write
09:52 - down four Loops something like this also
09:54 - four and two semicolon these two
09:56 - semicolons are compulsory right right
09:59 - you have to write down these semicolon
10:01 - but you can you can these are optional
10:03 - the all the three Expressions so when
10:05 - you execute this thing then also you
10:07 - will get some output if you don't write
10:10 - this thing then simply write semicolon
10:12 - conditional condition and increment
10:13 - decrement if you don't write this thing
10:15 - and this thing simply write semicolon
10:17 - condition and semicolon that is also
10:18 - fine right so every expression is having
10:21 - its own properties so I'll be discussing
10:25 - every expression properties in next
10:26 - video and with the help of some examples
10:29 - we will discuss many examples many ways
10:31 - to write four Loop statements then only
10:35 - you'll be able to solve those kind of
10:36 - questions when some code is given and
10:39 - you are asked to give the output of this
10:41 - code there they'll not they'll not uh
10:44 - just write this for Loop and this and
10:46 - tell me the output of this program no
10:48 - they'll do some tricky things with for
10:50 - Loop some experiments so everything will
10:52 - be discussing in this series one by one
10:54 - in next video I'll discuss that thing
10:56 - means if you are learning C then learn
10:58 - it in a good way every single detail
11:01 - about the topic you are learning every
11:03 - single tricky things every single
11:04 - experiment you can do with that topic
11:06 - it's not like that simply learn yeah
11:08 - this is the expression of writing for
11:10 - Loop that's it now we will discuss y
11:12 - Loop no there are many more left about
11:15 - this for Loop so that we I'll discuss in
11:16 - next video right so now I'll see you in
11:18 - the next video till then bye-bye take
11:27 - care

Cleaned transcript:

and the series of learning programming in c we are discussing about looping statements in C or you can say Loops in C in the previous video I have discussed some basic points about uh Loops like why do you write Loops in your program right the need of looping statement in your program what are exit controlled Loops what are entry controlled Loops some other uh you know important points about loops we have discussed in previous video but now in this video I'll be talking about four loop three type of Loops are there four while and do while so in this video I'll be talking about for Loop in C in detail syntax of for Loop how to write for Loop in your program working of for loop with the help of flowchart as well as with the help of a program and other some other important points also about for Loop right uh like different ways to write for Loops in C fine so every single detail I'll talk in this video about this for Loop in C right so now let us discuss for Loop in C I hope you know why we use Loop in C when you want to execute a statement or many statements multiple times repeatedly then then for that we use looping statement in C so this four is what it is the you know most popular you can say uh loop every programmer use this Loop this is you can say the most popular Loop in C why that also will'll discuss because it is having many advantages rather than that y Loop and do y Loop and this is what entry controlled Loop what is entry controlled Loop please see the previous video in the side but and you will come to know what is entry control Loop so this is entry controlled Loop like while is also entry controlled do while is exit controlled Loop right so now what is first of all see the syntax of writing four Loop in your program four is a keyword simply write you will write four right and in this braces what you will write three Expressions we will write three statements here three Expressions we will write or uh and after every expression semicolon here also so we have semicolon means two semicolon in four Loop these are compulsory to write in four Loop right and after that in curly braces we will write body of the loop mean the statements you want to execute right if you have a single statement then no need to write curly braces if you have multiple statement within this four Loop body then you have to put down put this curly braces now the expression one this is what or you can write here initialization here you can write condition semicolon and here we will write this is what update uh or you can say modify update expression or modify expression or increment or decrement whatever you want to write right see here condition we are checking condition before entering into Loop that is why we know we call it as entry controlled Loop right now see the working of this Loop let me take one example suppose I want to print number from 1 to 10 right 1 2 3 4 like this what you can do two ways are there either you can write print f one print f 2 print F 3 and up to n 10 print F you have to use 10 print F statements but it will not look good to write 10 print F statement just to print number one to 10 so what you can do you can write down this with four loop with a loop with any Loop four while or do while so now how you will write four here we are going to initialize right initial for initialization I'm taking a aable I I is it's like you can say girlfriend for Loop that is why generally we use I variable for initialization I or j or k i is equal to I'm initializing this with one somewhere in the program I'm not writing the complete program here right to print one number from 1 to 10 you have to include header files then void main then obviously you have to declare this variable I because we cannot directly use this variable here this is what initialization but before that you have to declare this variable in time your program now condition condition is what you want to print number till 10 so the loop would be executed till I becomes less than equal to 10 right and then I ++ I'm going to increment because I'm going to print 1 2 3 4 like this and within this Loop this body of the loop I'm printing I is equal to percentage D because data type is integer and I'm just printing I that's it right now see the working of this for Loop first is this is what initialization so first I would be initialized in memory in memory I have a variable I and the value of I is now one that's it now this is First Step second step is condition would be checked I less than equal to 10 I is 1 and this is 10 1 is less than equal to 10 yes condition is true right now control will not go to the third one increment or decrement the modify expression no now if condition is true control will enter into this for Loop and in this for loop I have written one statement print f i is equal to percentage D so what output you will get I equal to percentage D would be replaced with the first argument that is I value would be fast I value is one one would be printed on your screen and that's it only one statement I have in this for Loop fine now after executing this body of the loop control will go to here now the I value would be updated now here I have I ++ now value becomes two right now again control will go means third is what second this one is third the body of this this body of the loop then this is the fourth step increment or decrement now after fourth again second condition would be checked 2 less than equal 10 yes again control will enter into this Loop what would be printed I is equal to 2 after that again I ++ that is three condition would be checked I is equal to 3 would be printed and like this this is going to be in Loop see this this and this the these statements are executing again and again but this initialization is what only one time this initialization this statement would be ex executed only once that's it these are in Loops right now suppose I value becomes 10 so 10 would be printed again I ++ now at one time I value become 11 so 11 less than equal to 10 no condition is false now control will not enter into this for Loop if it is false control will directly go out of this Loop body whatever is there that would be printed suppose I'm printing here I'm writing here print f JK so after printing till 10 JK would be on your screen right so this is what working of this for Loop you have to take care of this point this initialization this statement this expression would be executed only once right this is working of this for loop I hope you uh got the steps of this for Loop let me draw a flowchart for this first is this one initialization that would be executed only once then condition would be checked now if the condition is true then control will enter into this then you can say this body of this this Loop would be executed whatever you have written there then what value this modify or this update expression after modify your update again it will check the condition means again control will go to here check the condition if the condition is true again this is in Loop if here the condition is false then it will not enter into this for Loop and it will go out of this body of the loop if there is print F then that statement would be printed so here it will go so this is what uh in a case of flowchart I have shown the working of this for loop I hope you got this flowchart so sometimes in W they can ask this question how many times this statement would be executed initialization that is only once this is out of this Loop right this is only one time it is not compulsory that you have to uh write down initialize the I value from one here in this case it is compulsory because I want to print 1 to 10 so that is why value would be started from one right but here you can also write I less than 11 that is also fine if you want to print suppose I want to print JK 10 times right so there you can initialize I equal to 0 condition is I less than 10 10 times I less than equal to 9 that is also fine 10 times right I is equal to 2 and I less than equal to should be I think 11 right so let me give you one assignment for you if you got the working of this four Loop then definitely you can answer this now you have to tell me in comment box what output you will get if you are writing for Loop like this I equal to 10 I less than 10 I ++ and print F I'm printing I right now each expression is having its own properties some properties are there you can say some interesting facts about for loop it's not like that you have to write for Loop like this always no there are many ways you can write for Loop this expression this is completely optional you can ignore this you can it's not compulsory to write this in this uh for Loop this is also optional this is also optional so you can write down four Loops something like this also four and two semicolon these two semicolons are compulsory right right you have to write down these semicolon but you can you can these are optional the all the three Expressions so when you execute this thing then also you will get some output if you don't write this thing then simply write semicolon conditional condition and increment decrement if you don't write this thing and this thing simply write semicolon condition and semicolon that is also fine right so every expression is having its own properties so I'll be discussing every expression properties in next video and with the help of some examples we will discuss many examples many ways to write four Loop statements then only you'll be able to solve those kind of questions when some code is given and you are asked to give the output of this code there they'll not they'll not uh just write this for Loop and this and tell me the output of this program no they'll do some tricky things with for Loop some experiments so everything will be discussing in this series one by one in next video I'll discuss that thing means if you are learning C then learn it in a good way every single detail about the topic you are learning every single tricky things every single experiment you can do with that topic it's not like that simply learn yeah this is the expression of writing for Loop that's it now we will discuss y Loop no there are many more left about this for Loop so that we I'll discuss in next video right so now I'll see you in the next video till then byebye take care
