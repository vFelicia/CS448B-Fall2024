00:00 - so in the stage of learning c
00:01 - programming from this video and we'll
00:03 - start a new concept and see that is
00:04 - structured in c so whenever a new
00:06 - concept comes the first question would
00:08 - be in your mind what why we need this
00:11 - concept why we need structure so that's
00:12 - exactly we'll discuss with this video
00:14 - like what is structure and why we need
00:16 - structure
00:17 - right and how to declare a structure
00:19 - then with example and some very
00:22 - important points about structure about
00:24 - declaration of structures that you
00:25 - cannot miss out
00:27 - but before that just want to tell you
00:28 - one thing if you are preparing for gate
00:30 - or will be preparing for gate
00:31 - examination then an academy is going to
00:33 - start a new batch rohan for gate 2023
00:37 - from 17th of november so in this course
00:39 - the top educators will be covering all
00:41 - the subjects of cs and id and this
00:43 - course will include
00:44 - representative strategy tips and tricks
00:46 - practice questions and numericals along
00:48 - with the detailed explanation of all the
00:50 - concepts and the course would be covered
00:52 - in both hindi and english and notes
00:53 - should be given to you in english only
00:55 - and all your doubts will be cleared in
00:57 - those doubt clearing sessions in the
00:59 - course and this one is paid subscription
01:01 - but you can use my code jkl10 to get 10
01:03 - discount on your paid subscription and
01:06 - one more thing an academy is also going
01:08 - to conduct a scholarship test for gate
01:10 - and esu on 14th of november here you can
01:12 - compete with thousands of learners from
01:14 - all over india and you stand a chance to
01:15 - win up to 100 scholarship
01:18 - you will get 20 questions and all the
01:19 - questions would be very challenging and
01:21 - original eight questions that has been
01:22 - curated by their best gate and esc
01:24 - educators and the time limit would be 60
01:26 - minutes so you can assess your gate
01:28 - preparation in just
01:29 - 60 minutes
01:31 - you can see how you rank against all the
01:33 - others from all over india using
01:36 - live leaderboard that would be updated
01:37 - after every question just have to enroll
01:39 - for it the enrollment link i'll put in
01:41 - the description box of this video just
01:43 - go to that link scroll down and pick up
01:45 - the right test for you and just click
01:47 - enroll and use my code jkl10
01:49 - to unlock the test and one more thing an
01:51 - academy special price week is going on
01:54 - so if you go for a subscription plan for
01:56 - 12 months or above you will get 10
01:58 - percent discount and if you will use
02:01 - micro jkl then you will get extra 10
02:02 - percent off on the reduced price so you
02:05 - can see the price detail on my screen so
02:07 - all the relevant links and the details
02:09 - i'll put in the description box of this
02:10 - video if you are interested you can go
02:12 - and check out so now let's discuss what
02:14 - is structure and see and why we need
02:16 - structure see
02:17 - first of all
02:19 - why we need variable if you want to
02:21 - store a value in computer memory then we
02:24 - need a variable like i want to store an
02:25 - integer value that is 5
02:27 - so how you will store we will declare a
02:29 - variable like in type int a is equal to
02:32 - 5 this is variable name this data type
02:34 - and
02:35 - this is how we can store
02:37 - value right if you want to store suppose
02:40 - 60 values like uh roll numbers of 60
02:42 - students so we use aries i hope you are
02:45 - clear with this why we use rs that we
02:47 - have already discussed you can watch out
02:48 - that previous video right so how you
02:51 - will
02:52 - declare an array end suppose name i am
02:54 - taking a only and the size is 60
02:58 - so here we can store
03:01 - roll number or any integer value 60
03:03 - integer value like 1 to 60 or you can
03:06 - say roll numbers of 60 students if i say
03:08 - int
03:09 - roll number so roll number of 60
03:11 - students we can store under a single
03:12 - variable name that is roll number
03:15 - that's why we need arrays like arrays
03:17 - are homogeneous
03:18 - no collection of homogeneous data item
03:20 - means we can store more than one data
03:22 - item of same data type right
03:24 - but
03:25 - see in real life
03:27 - obviously we have to process data of
03:30 - different different data types like what
03:32 - suppose i want to store
03:34 - information of a student so
03:37 - information is of a student means
03:39 - roll number of a student
03:41 - you can say name is also there
03:43 - marks
03:44 - then maybe address and many other things
03:46 - are there but here i am taking only
03:48 - three things
03:50 - so here c roll number would be of type
03:52 - integer
03:54 - name would be of type
03:55 - i know you can say string
03:59 - right and marks would be of type may be
04:01 - float
04:02 - so we are having three data types
04:04 - different different types of information
04:06 - we have about a student like int then
04:09 - string then float or maybe addresses
04:10 - there then also you know you can say
04:13 - float or maybe string many information
04:16 - is there about a student right
04:18 - and there are 60 students suppose
04:22 - at first we take suppose only two
04:24 - students
04:28 - so what you can do
04:30 - one thing is what
04:33 - for student one
04:35 - let's take for student
04:37 - one
04:38 - and this data is for student two
04:41 - for student one i can take different
04:43 - different variables like in
04:45 - roll number
04:47 - care name and here you can give size
04:49 - like 20 and here you can take float
04:52 - marks
04:55 - but for student two also you will you
04:57 - are supposed to take three different
04:58 - different variable for roll number like
05:00 - in
05:01 - this is for student one roll number s1
05:05 - name
05:07 - s1 marks s1 this would be student for
05:11 - student 2 roll number
05:13 - s2
05:15 - care
05:16 - name
05:17 - s2 20
05:20 - float and this is for swing to max s2
05:25 - so for storing this this information for
05:27 - two students we have taken three and
05:29 - three six variables and suppose we have
05:32 - 60 students so you can imagine how many
05:34 - variables you are supposed to take
05:36 - and here in information we have only
05:38 - three things only three things
05:42 - suppose you are making a software
05:43 - obviously for student information maybe
05:46 - for university you are supposed to make
05:47 - a software to store the information of
05:49 - student also faculty also and everything
05:53 - so how many variables you will take
05:54 - obviously it is not possible to take
05:56 - variables to store the data
05:58 - right
06:00 - so now we will take maybe you can take
06:01 - arrays
06:02 - but array in array yeah we can store
06:05 - polymers of 60 students like more than
06:08 - one student the data of more than one
06:10 - student but that data should be of same
06:12 - type homogeneous
06:15 - like suppose this is an array in
06:18 - row number and 60
06:21 - so in this array we can store only 16
06:23 - teaser value
06:25 - right
06:26 - i am taking
06:28 - float
06:29 - [Music]
06:30 - marks
06:32 - 60 here you can store marks of 60
06:34 - student but that would be your float
06:36 - type only
06:37 - so here also you need to take different
06:39 - different type different different
06:40 - arrays
06:42 - right
06:43 - one array for roll number one for name
06:45 - and one for marks three arrays that is
06:48 - also not convenient to use
06:50 - right
06:52 - so is it possible
06:54 - to
06:55 - declare or to take
06:57 - different different data types all these
06:59 - variables under a single name
07:02 - right
07:03 - yes it is possible that is using
07:05 - structures
07:07 - right so structure see int is what data
07:10 - type array is what also a
07:13 - data type but it's not primitive
07:14 - primitive primitive data types are what
07:16 - or you can say fundamental layer types
07:17 - are
07:18 - in care flow double
07:20 - right then user defined data types are
07:22 - there then derived types are there so
07:24 - array is derived data
07:27 - structure is also a data type but
07:29 - structure is what user defined data type
07:32 - means we can define our own data type
07:35 - right
07:36 - using how you can define your own data
07:38 - type using
07:39 - these primitive data types in care flow
07:42 - double using these data types we can
07:44 - define our own data type
07:46 - so structure is what a user defined data
07:49 - type first thing is clear to you user is
07:51 - so the structure is user defined data
07:53 - type
07:54 - right
07:55 - now we will complete the definition one
07:57 - by one see now
07:59 - if i want to store these
08:02 - let me just rub this first
08:04 - so here we have this information about
08:06 - student
08:07 - different different data types are there
08:08 - all the variables this is having in data
08:10 - type this is string and this is what
08:13 - float
08:14 - so can we store the different different
08:16 - data types under a single name under a
08:18 - single data type yes that is structure
08:20 - so how you will write that thing means
08:22 - how you declare a structure see you will
08:25 - write
08:27 - struct as a keyword you will write
08:28 - struct then you will write the name of
08:31 - the structure means suppose i am taking
08:33 - student here
08:37 - here i am taking name of the structure
08:38 - is student then
08:41 - this curly braces whatever variable you
08:43 - will take just write down those things
08:46 - and then
08:47 - closing the curly braces and then put
08:48 - semicolon
08:50 - this is declaration of structure that's
08:52 - it
08:53 - this is how we will declare a structure
08:56 - struck keyword this is what structure
08:58 - name
08:59 - right or you can say the tag structure
09:01 - tag
09:02 - right and these
09:05 - these are what rollumber marks and name
09:08 - these are what members of structure
09:11 - this we call as members of structure
09:14 - right and what point you have to take
09:16 - care about declaration of structure that
09:18 - are very important at last you are
09:19 - supposed to put semicolon
09:22 - right
09:23 - so now
09:25 - you can using this
09:27 - you can store a student information like
09:29 - for 60 students or how many students you
09:31 - want to so you can store
09:33 - that also will discuss one by one how
09:34 - you will store you have to you know ah
09:36 - define the
09:38 - objects of the structure right array of
09:40 - objects you can also define everything
09:43 - you know we will discuss one by one in
09:44 - later videos this is just introduction
09:46 - so i hope it is clear to you what is
09:47 - structure
09:48 - and
09:49 - why we need structure i think this is
09:51 - clear why we need structure
09:53 - to process
09:54 - data of
09:55 - different different data types obviously
09:56 - we need structure in real life obviously
09:58 - in real world if you want to make a
10:00 - software or anything you have to process
10:02 - data that is of different different data
10:04 - types so you cannot declare so many
10:07 - variables in your program that would be
10:09 - very lengthy you cannot take even arrays
10:11 - arrays is not a good solution to process
10:12 - this kind of data like student data or
10:15 - you can say employees information or you
10:17 - can say those data structure will
10:18 - discuss trees linked list
10:21 - if you want to process those data
10:22 - structure then also we will need
10:24 - structure
10:25 - right
10:26 - so structure is what it's a user defined
10:29 - data type that
10:31 - groups
10:32 - elements of or you can say variables of
10:34 - different different data types
10:37 - under a single name what is the name
10:40 - student
10:41 - that is structure or you can say
10:42 - structure is a collection of one or more
10:45 - variables of different different data
10:47 - types that are grouped together under a
10:51 - single name
10:52 - i think if this is clear to you
10:55 - what is structure means this is clear to
10:57 - you why we need structure so definitely
11:00 - you can write down your own definition
11:01 - in your own words
11:03 - right
11:04 - so now what are some important point
11:06 - about structure see first thing
11:09 - the semicolon you have to put a
11:10 - semicolon here right second thing is
11:13 - what and see these are members of this
11:15 - structure so two members cannot have
11:17 - same name suppose i am taking here
11:20 - ah one more thing that is
11:24 - float
11:26 - roll number so here also number here
11:29 - here also no number this would be
11:30 - duplicate
11:31 - so the name cannot be same within the
11:34 - same same structure two variables cannot
11:36 - have same name
11:37 - this you need to take care right
11:39 - next thing is what here we cannot
11:42 - initialize this individual
11:44 - structure member like if you want to
11:46 - write down here
11:48 - like interval number is equal to
11:51 - 1
11:53 - this would not be allowed
11:55 - and why so see
11:57 - when you write this thing when you write
11:59 - only this thing it doesn't mean the
12:01 - memory has been allocated
12:04 - in that computer memory no memory has
12:06 - not been allocated this is just a
12:08 - template you can say
12:10 - this will show the compiler how the
12:12 - structure is there how the structure is
12:14 - laid out right but memory has not been
12:16 - allocated to these
12:18 - variables to roll number to name and to
12:20 - float no to this marks no
12:23 - this is very important point see this is
12:25 - just a data type struct student like
12:28 - suppose if i write int
12:31 - this is what data type if i write float
12:34 - in main suppose if i write int
12:38 - memory has been allocated to this
12:41 - no
12:43 - it's just a data type if you write int a
12:46 - yeah
12:47 - now memory has been allocated to this a
12:49 - how many bytes four bytes or in some
12:52 - compiler two bytes right so this struct
12:55 - student is just a data type it's similar
12:58 - like
12:59 - struct
13:01 - student
13:02 - it's similar
13:04 - writing similar to writing int
13:07 - right so memory has not been elevated to
13:08 - this
13:10 - if you want that memory has been
13:11 - allocated if you want to allocate some
13:13 - memory so you have to write like this is
13:15 - data type this complete struct student
13:17 - is data type
13:18 - now you write down the name of the
13:19 - variable like here i am writing a
13:22 - so here you can write any name like s
13:25 - like s1 s1 for student comma s2 for
13:29 - student 2 this you can write so now
13:32 - memory has been allocated to this to
13:34 - this s1
13:36 - and how much memory
13:38 - how much memory for this just calculate
13:40 - for this this and this
13:43 - intro number how many bytes four
13:46 - care this how many bytes 20
13:49 - one byte for care float this how many
13:51 - byte four you can just do the total of
13:53 - this and this much byte has been
13:54 - allocated to this
13:56 - to this s1
13:58 - to this s1
14:00 - that will discuss in detail right how to
14:03 - define the structure or you can say how
14:04 - to take how to know this is one is
14:07 - called object of this structure how to
14:09 - declare how to define these objects how
14:11 - memory would be allocated
14:13 - right for 60 students if you want to
14:15 - sort the data then area of objects you
14:16 - are supposed to define you are supposed
14:18 - to take so that once we will discuss one
14:20 - by one in later videos i hope till now
14:22 - it is clear why we need structure and
14:24 - what is the structure the definition of
14:25 - the structure and how to declare the
14:27 - structure and some important point about
14:29 - the declaration of the structure
14:31 - all right so that's it for this video
14:33 - now i'll see you in the next video till
14:34 - then bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the stage of learning c programming from this video and we'll start a new concept and see that is structured in c so whenever a new concept comes the first question would be in your mind what why we need this concept why we need structure so that's exactly we'll discuss with this video like what is structure and why we need structure right and how to declare a structure then with example and some very important points about structure about declaration of structures that you cannot miss out but before that just want to tell you one thing if you are preparing for gate or will be preparing for gate examination then an academy is going to start a new batch rohan for gate 2023 from 17th of november so in this course the top educators will be covering all the subjects of cs and id and this course will include representative strategy tips and tricks practice questions and numericals along with the detailed explanation of all the concepts and the course would be covered in both hindi and english and notes should be given to you in english only and all your doubts will be cleared in those doubt clearing sessions in the course and this one is paid subscription but you can use my code jkl10 to get 10 discount on your paid subscription and one more thing an academy is also going to conduct a scholarship test for gate and esu on 14th of november here you can compete with thousands of learners from all over india and you stand a chance to win up to 100 scholarship you will get 20 questions and all the questions would be very challenging and original eight questions that has been curated by their best gate and esc educators and the time limit would be 60 minutes so you can assess your gate preparation in just 60 minutes you can see how you rank against all the others from all over india using live leaderboard that would be updated after every question just have to enroll for it the enrollment link i'll put in the description box of this video just go to that link scroll down and pick up the right test for you and just click enroll and use my code jkl10 to unlock the test and one more thing an academy special price week is going on so if you go for a subscription plan for 12 months or above you will get 10 percent discount and if you will use micro jkl then you will get extra 10 percent off on the reduced price so you can see the price detail on my screen so all the relevant links and the details i'll put in the description box of this video if you are interested you can go and check out so now let's discuss what is structure and see and why we need structure see first of all why we need variable if you want to store a value in computer memory then we need a variable like i want to store an integer value that is 5 so how you will store we will declare a variable like in type int a is equal to 5 this is variable name this data type and this is how we can store value right if you want to store suppose 60 values like uh roll numbers of 60 students so we use aries i hope you are clear with this why we use rs that we have already discussed you can watch out that previous video right so how you will declare an array end suppose name i am taking a only and the size is 60 so here we can store roll number or any integer value 60 integer value like 1 to 60 or you can say roll numbers of 60 students if i say int roll number so roll number of 60 students we can store under a single variable name that is roll number that's why we need arrays like arrays are homogeneous no collection of homogeneous data item means we can store more than one data item of same data type right but see in real life obviously we have to process data of different different data types like what suppose i want to store information of a student so information is of a student means roll number of a student you can say name is also there marks then maybe address and many other things are there but here i am taking only three things so here c roll number would be of type integer name would be of type i know you can say string right and marks would be of type may be float so we are having three data types different different types of information we have about a student like int then string then float or maybe addresses there then also you know you can say float or maybe string many information is there about a student right and there are 60 students suppose at first we take suppose only two students so what you can do one thing is what for student one let's take for student one and this data is for student two for student one i can take different different variables like in roll number care name and here you can give size like 20 and here you can take float marks but for student two also you will you are supposed to take three different different variable for roll number like in this is for student one roll number s1 name s1 marks s1 this would be student for student 2 roll number s2 care name s2 20 float and this is for swing to max s2 so for storing this this information for two students we have taken three and three six variables and suppose we have 60 students so you can imagine how many variables you are supposed to take and here in information we have only three things only three things suppose you are making a software obviously for student information maybe for university you are supposed to make a software to store the information of student also faculty also and everything so how many variables you will take obviously it is not possible to take variables to store the data right so now we will take maybe you can take arrays but array in array yeah we can store polymers of 60 students like more than one student the data of more than one student but that data should be of same type homogeneous like suppose this is an array in row number and 60 so in this array we can store only 16 teaser value right i am taking float marks 60 here you can store marks of 60 student but that would be your float type only so here also you need to take different different type different different arrays right one array for roll number one for name and one for marks three arrays that is also not convenient to use right so is it possible to declare or to take different different data types all these variables under a single name right yes it is possible that is using structures right so structure see int is what data type array is what also a data type but it's not primitive primitive primitive data types are what or you can say fundamental layer types are in care flow double right then user defined data types are there then derived types are there so array is derived data structure is also a data type but structure is what user defined data type means we can define our own data type right using how you can define your own data type using these primitive data types in care flow double using these data types we can define our own data type so structure is what a user defined data type first thing is clear to you user is so the structure is user defined data type right now we will complete the definition one by one see now if i want to store these let me just rub this first so here we have this information about student different different data types are there all the variables this is having in data type this is string and this is what float so can we store the different different data types under a single name under a single data type yes that is structure so how you will write that thing means how you declare a structure see you will write struct as a keyword you will write struct then you will write the name of the structure means suppose i am taking student here here i am taking name of the structure is student then this curly braces whatever variable you will take just write down those things and then closing the curly braces and then put semicolon this is declaration of structure that's it this is how we will declare a structure struck keyword this is what structure name right or you can say the tag structure tag right and these these are what rollumber marks and name these are what members of structure this we call as members of structure right and what point you have to take care about declaration of structure that are very important at last you are supposed to put semicolon right so now you can using this you can store a student information like for 60 students or how many students you want to so you can store that also will discuss one by one how you will store you have to you know ah define the objects of the structure right array of objects you can also define everything you know we will discuss one by one in later videos this is just introduction so i hope it is clear to you what is structure and why we need structure i think this is clear why we need structure to process data of different different data types obviously we need structure in real life obviously in real world if you want to make a software or anything you have to process data that is of different different data types so you cannot declare so many variables in your program that would be very lengthy you cannot take even arrays arrays is not a good solution to process this kind of data like student data or you can say employees information or you can say those data structure will discuss trees linked list if you want to process those data structure then also we will need structure right so structure is what it's a user defined data type that groups elements of or you can say variables of different different data types under a single name what is the name student that is structure or you can say structure is a collection of one or more variables of different different data types that are grouped together under a single name i think if this is clear to you what is structure means this is clear to you why we need structure so definitely you can write down your own definition in your own words right so now what are some important point about structure see first thing the semicolon you have to put a semicolon here right second thing is what and see these are members of this structure so two members cannot have same name suppose i am taking here ah one more thing that is float roll number so here also number here here also no number this would be duplicate so the name cannot be same within the same same structure two variables cannot have same name this you need to take care right next thing is what here we cannot initialize this individual structure member like if you want to write down here like interval number is equal to 1 this would not be allowed and why so see when you write this thing when you write only this thing it doesn't mean the memory has been allocated in that computer memory no memory has not been allocated this is just a template you can say this will show the compiler how the structure is there how the structure is laid out right but memory has not been allocated to these variables to roll number to name and to float no to this marks no this is very important point see this is just a data type struct student like suppose if i write int this is what data type if i write float in main suppose if i write int memory has been allocated to this no it's just a data type if you write int a yeah now memory has been allocated to this a how many bytes four bytes or in some compiler two bytes right so this struct student is just a data type it's similar like struct student it's similar writing similar to writing int right so memory has not been elevated to this if you want that memory has been allocated if you want to allocate some memory so you have to write like this is data type this complete struct student is data type now you write down the name of the variable like here i am writing a so here you can write any name like s like s1 s1 for student comma s2 for student 2 this you can write so now memory has been allocated to this to this s1 and how much memory how much memory for this just calculate for this this and this intro number how many bytes four care this how many bytes 20 one byte for care float this how many byte four you can just do the total of this and this much byte has been allocated to this to this s1 to this s1 that will discuss in detail right how to define the structure or you can say how to take how to know this is one is called object of this structure how to declare how to define these objects how memory would be allocated right for 60 students if you want to sort the data then area of objects you are supposed to define you are supposed to take so that once we will discuss one by one in later videos i hope till now it is clear why we need structure and what is the structure the definition of the structure and how to declare the structure and some important point about the declaration of the structure all right so that's it for this video now i'll see you in the next video till then bye take care
