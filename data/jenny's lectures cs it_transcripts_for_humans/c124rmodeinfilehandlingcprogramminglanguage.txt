00:00 - so in the series of learning c
00:02 - programming we are discussing file
00:03 - handling concepts in c in the previous
00:04 - video we have discussed append mode in c
00:06 - basically we have discussed three modes
00:08 - read write and append mode now we are
00:10 - left with three more modes r plus w plus
00:13 - and a plus these are special modes right
00:16 - so in this video we'll see what is r
00:17 - plus mode with the help of a proper
00:19 - program and i'll show you practical also
00:20 - in my laptop right now before i just
00:22 - want to tell you one thing if you guys
00:24 - are going to start for preparing gate
00:26 - 2023 and 2024 exam then an academy is
00:29 - going to start new batches from 12th of
00:32 - january as well as they have started a
00:34 - few batches from 5th of january for gate
00:36 - aspirants in these batches they are
00:38 - going to cover entire slavers of cs and
00:40 - it and this course will include
00:42 - preparation strategy tips and tricks
00:44 - practice questions numericals along with
00:46 - the detailed explanation of the concepts
00:48 - and you can get your doubt cleared in
00:50 - special doubt clearing sessions in the

01:45 - you will get extra two months the price
01:47 - details you can see on my screen
01:49 - and you can use my code jkl10 to get 10
01:51 - discount on an academy plus subscription
01:53 - so all the relevant links and the
01:54 - details i'll put in the description box
01:56 - of this video you can go and check out
01:58 - now let's see what is r plus mode
02:00 - i hope you remember what is r mode
02:03 - read mode means you are going to open
02:05 - the file in read model you can read the
02:07 - content of that file right if file don't
02:10 - exist
02:11 - it is it will give error means it will
02:13 - return null only right it is not going
02:16 - to create a new file like in w mode in w
02:19 - mode this is right mode here if file
02:21 - don't exist it will create a new file
02:23 - and it will open this file but in r mode
02:25 - if i already exist it will open the file
02:27 - for reading only you cannot write into
02:29 - that file but if i don't exist
02:31 - it will give error it is not going to
02:33 - create a new file
02:35 - right now what is r plus mode
02:37 - this
02:38 - for both reading and writing it will
02:40 - open the file for both reading and
02:43 - writing
02:44 - you can read as well as you can write
02:46 - but main purpose of our plus mode is
02:49 - reading right
02:50 - here if file exists okay it will open
02:53 - the file
02:54 - both for reading and writing but if i
02:57 - don't exist it is not going to create a
03:00 - new file
03:01 - right this you need to take care so now
03:03 - let us say i take one example i have a
03:05 - file suppose abc dot txt in my hard disk
03:09 - i want to read the content of this file
03:11 - right now
03:13 - first of all obviously you will create a
03:15 - file pointer and
03:17 - starting i am going to initialize with
03:18 - it with null so
03:21 - using f open function we will open the
03:23 - file just provide the name of the file
03:25 - abc dot txt and the mode is r plus
03:30 - in double quotes right now you have to
03:32 - check if because if something f open is
03:34 - not going to you know f open is not able
03:36 - to open this file it will return null so
03:39 - if f p is equal to is equal to null
03:42 - means in printf you can simply print
03:45 - error or anything you can print and you
03:47 - can simply exit from here only so now if
03:50 - you if suppose in my file i have this
03:52 - content
03:54 - hi
03:55 - this is the content i have in my file so
03:57 - if you will read this so now this file
04:00 - has been opened you can read this and
04:01 - you can write also main purpose is to
04:03 - read right
04:05 - now
04:06 - you can read how you can read the the
04:08 - function i have already told you
04:10 - how you can read this file using the
04:11 - function f get
04:13 - s
04:14 - f get c
04:16 - right f get s means complete string you
04:19 - can read just provide what
04:21 - string in which you all you will store
04:23 - and the string length here n and here
04:25 - just provide the file pointer f get c
04:28 - means it will read only a single
04:29 - character by character right we have
04:31 - discussed both these functions in the
04:33 - previous videos right how you can read
04:36 - something from a file in that video so
04:38 - you can check out that video
04:39 - now if you will write something
04:41 - something to this file
04:43 - where you can write means see in append
04:45 - mode you can append at the last
04:48 - if you will open the file in write mode
04:49 - means the previous content would be
04:51 - erased and simply you can write from
04:53 - here only
04:54 - but if you will open the file in read
04:56 - mode so r plus mode then where you can
04:58 - write this is very important about this
05:00 - mode
05:01 - right r plus mode
05:02 - this point makes this mode special
05:05 - you can write anywhere
05:08 - from starting from any in middle or at
05:12 - the end just you have to set your file
05:14 - pointer
05:15 - the logic you have to write and you can
05:18 - write down anywhere
05:19 - if you will open the file in r plus mode
05:22 - means basically if there is something in
05:24 - your file and you want to modify
05:26 - you don't want to add a new content
05:28 - right you don't want to append but you
05:30 - want to modify the already existed
05:33 - content from that file right suppose few
05:36 - lines are there ten lines and two or
05:38 - three lines you want to modify in that
05:41 - case open the file in r plus mode
05:45 - you can modify the file
05:47 - using this r plus mode only no other
05:50 - mode will help you to modify the file
05:54 - right
05:55 - so for modifying the file just open the
05:57 - file in r plus mode so this is very
05:59 - special right so just move your file
06:01 - pointer according to that and you can
06:02 - modify right now simply suppose this is
06:05 - my file and i want to put something here
06:09 - a character i want to put f would see
06:11 - and here is the character
06:13 - z
06:14 - in which file
06:15 - just provide the file pointer and that's
06:17 - it so where
06:19 - this z would be written
06:21 - here at the place of h
06:24 - in the starting cursor would be here
06:26 - only so h would not be there and here
06:28 - you can add
06:29 - z
06:30 - the remaining content would be same
06:32 - if suppose i want to add f put again f
06:35 - put as a string
06:37 - like i want to add jenny
06:41 - and fb
06:42 - and after that f close
06:46 - so first the file was high
06:49 - this is awesome so first of all this at
06:51 - the place of this z then jenny so here
06:54 - we have
06:55 - j e
06:57 - double n
06:59 - and y
07:00 - and remaining content would be same so
07:03 - this is what you have modified the
07:05 - this content if you want to modify the
07:08 - content from here just move the file
07:09 - pointer according to that you just have
07:11 - to specify the logic that also will
07:12 - discuss with help of program
07:14 - right in separate video but you can
07:16 - modify your content
07:17 - right
07:18 - if you want to add in the last that also
07:20 - you can do but by default if you write
07:22 - this thing this would be added from here
07:24 - only
07:26 - or this content would be you know
07:28 - updated or modified right
07:30 - if you want to read simply you can read
07:32 - with these
07:34 - functions right
07:36 - the reading logic i have already
07:37 - discussed i hope you can write that
07:38 - logic so the main point about r plus
07:40 - mode is it will open the file for both
07:42 - reading and writing if file don't exist
07:44 - it will not create a new file just give
07:46 - error or you know return the null
07:48 - pointer right
07:50 - and it is used to modify the content of
07:51 - your file
07:52 - right you can move the file pointer
07:55 - where you want to modify which content
07:56 - you want to modify
07:58 - that's it let me show you practical
08:00 - so now let me create a new file
08:04 - here we'll write down our plus
08:07 - mode
08:09 - dot c
08:12 - and i'm just going to
08:14 - copy the previous
08:16 - because this
08:18 - content would be same
08:21 - till this right we have created a file
08:24 - pointer
08:25 - and suppose you don't want this so just
08:27 - comment it out if open abc dot txt just
08:30 - change the mode not a mode we are going
08:32 - to open the file into our plus mode
08:34 - if fp is null just print error and exit
08:37 - now if fp is not
08:39 - null in that case
08:41 - what will happen see
08:44 - ah let me just first of all write down
08:46 - the string f close and
08:49 - that's it
08:51 - so abc dot txt file suppose i am writing
08:54 - here a b dot txt
08:57 - so this file is not there in my pc only
09:00 - the file is abc.txt in that directory
09:03 - right
09:03 - so if this is not the file then
09:06 - what will be the case see let me just
09:08 - run this and show you what output you
09:10 - will get
09:12 - see it is printing error
09:14 - because there is no such file so it will
09:16 - return uh null f open is not going to
09:19 - open the a b dot text file because it
09:20 - don't it doesn't exist so it will later
09:22 - null and if null just print error right
09:25 - but here i am writing abc dot txt right
09:28 - and in abc dot txt i have
09:31 - suppose the content is
09:33 - [Music]
09:35 - this is
09:38 - awesome
09:39 - right
09:40 - now let me just
09:44 - open this file and see what output you
09:46 - will get see if you'll open the file
09:48 - okay fine it will open the file but
09:50 - nothing would be there
09:52 - means no output because you are not uh
09:54 - you know reading something from the file
09:56 - so it is not giving it will not give you
09:58 - error like it will not print any error
10:00 - this message right but it will not show
10:02 - you any output so here
10:06 - and the file content would be same this
10:07 - is awesome so now if you want to add
10:09 - something
10:10 - if you want to write suppose i am
10:12 - writing here f
10:15 - put s
10:16 - and i am writing
10:17 - jenny
10:20 - if we just provide the file pointer
10:22 - that's it
10:23 - now let me run this and show you the
10:25 - file
10:28 - it will not show on the screen anything
10:31 - it has successfully run but in the file
10:34 - now you will get
10:35 - jenny and is
10:38 - awesome
10:39 - so this
10:40 - phis
10:42 - this has been updated by this jenny so
10:44 - the cursor would be at the starting at
10:47 - the first byte or the first character
10:49 - right and whatever you will write that
10:51 - would be written from the starting of
10:53 - the file only right and remaining
10:54 - content would be same so jenny is
10:56 - awesome right
10:59 - now suppose uh one more thing f put c i
11:02 - want to add a character also like uh
11:05 - z
11:07 - sorry character would be in single
11:08 - quotes
11:10 - right
11:12 - uh z
11:17 - fb
11:19 - now let me just run this and show you
11:22 - now see in the file we have
11:25 - jenny
11:26 - then
11:27 - z i has been replaced by z and s
11:30 - and then awesome right so i hope you go
11:32 - to what is r plus mode
11:34 - now whenever wherever you want to modify
11:37 - the content if suppose you have a
11:38 - lengthy file five or ten lines or many
11:40 - lines and specific line you want to
11:42 - modify just move the cursor just move
11:44 - the file pointer to that
11:46 - uh you know place and modify that line
11:49 - only right so if you want to modify the
11:51 - already existing content already existed
11:53 - content
11:54 - then you will open the file in r plus
11:56 - mode
11:57 - then it will be beneficial right
11:59 - otherwise reading and writing both wps
12:01 - can also do reading and writing
12:02 - a plus can also do reading and pending
12:04 - writing right but that is the difference
12:07 - only this mode will
12:09 - modify if you want to modify you are
12:11 - supposed to open the file in r plus mode
12:14 - only
12:15 - right and if you want to read the
12:17 - content whatever the content in the file
12:18 - just put the logic of reading the file
12:20 - that i have already discussed in my
12:21 - previous videos so you can check out
12:23 - that and you can put that content so
12:25 - that is assignment for you guys right
12:27 - you will read also and you will write
12:29 - also something right and you will open
12:31 - the file in r plus mode fine so now i
12:33 - guess that's it for this video so i hope
12:35 - you go to this r plus mode in the next
12:37 - video we will see w plus mode and also
12:38 - we will see the difference between r
12:40 - plus and w plus mode right so now in the
12:42 - next video till then bye take

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning c programming we are discussing file handling concepts in c in the previous video we have discussed append mode in c basically we have discussed three modes read write and append mode now we are left with three more modes r plus w plus and a plus these are special modes right so in this video we'll see what is r plus mode with the help of a proper program and i'll show you practical also in my laptop right now before i just want to tell you one thing if you guys are going to start for preparing gate 2023 and 2024 exam then an academy is going to start new batches from 12th of january as well as they have started a few batches from 5th of january for gate aspirants in these batches they are going to cover entire slavers of cs and it and this course will include preparation strategy tips and tricks practice questions numericals along with the detailed explanation of the concepts and you can get your doubt cleared in special doubt clearing sessions in the course this would be paid subscription because you will get complete and structured courses but you can use my code jkl10 to get 10 discount on your paid subscription as well as for those who are appearing in gate 2022 exam they have started all india mock test series in the month of january every sunday and you can take these tests for free so here you can complete your final division with these full length mock tests they are going to cover entire slabs and these are created by their best educators you will experience your actual exam like sitting and you will also get all india ranking so you can see where you are standing among on all the learners from all over india and after every test you will get detailed video solutions so you can identify your weak areas and you can improve according to that and an academy is also providing you a great offer in which you just subscribe to 12 months of the academy gate and esc plus and you will get extra two months on it just to help you in your gate and esc exams so you will have to pay for 12 months and you will get extra two months the price details you can see on my screen and you can use my code jkl10 to get 10 discount on an academy plus subscription so all the relevant links and the details i'll put in the description box of this video you can go and check out now let's see what is r plus mode i hope you remember what is r mode read mode means you are going to open the file in read model you can read the content of that file right if file don't exist it is it will give error means it will return null only right it is not going to create a new file like in w mode in w mode this is right mode here if file don't exist it will create a new file and it will open this file but in r mode if i already exist it will open the file for reading only you cannot write into that file but if i don't exist it will give error it is not going to create a new file right now what is r plus mode this for both reading and writing it will open the file for both reading and writing you can read as well as you can write but main purpose of our plus mode is reading right here if file exists okay it will open the file both for reading and writing but if i don't exist it is not going to create a new file right this you need to take care so now let us say i take one example i have a file suppose abc dot txt in my hard disk i want to read the content of this file right now first of all obviously you will create a file pointer and starting i am going to initialize with it with null so using f open function we will open the file just provide the name of the file abc dot txt and the mode is r plus in double quotes right now you have to check if because if something f open is not going to you know f open is not able to open this file it will return null so if f p is equal to is equal to null means in printf you can simply print error or anything you can print and you can simply exit from here only so now if you if suppose in my file i have this content hi this is the content i have in my file so if you will read this so now this file has been opened you can read this and you can write also main purpose is to read right now you can read how you can read the the function i have already told you how you can read this file using the function f get s f get c right f get s means complete string you can read just provide what string in which you all you will store and the string length here n and here just provide the file pointer f get c means it will read only a single character by character right we have discussed both these functions in the previous videos right how you can read something from a file in that video so you can check out that video now if you will write something something to this file where you can write means see in append mode you can append at the last if you will open the file in write mode means the previous content would be erased and simply you can write from here only but if you will open the file in read mode so r plus mode then where you can write this is very important about this mode right r plus mode this point makes this mode special you can write anywhere from starting from any in middle or at the end just you have to set your file pointer the logic you have to write and you can write down anywhere if you will open the file in r plus mode means basically if there is something in your file and you want to modify you don't want to add a new content right you don't want to append but you want to modify the already existed content from that file right suppose few lines are there ten lines and two or three lines you want to modify in that case open the file in r plus mode you can modify the file using this r plus mode only no other mode will help you to modify the file right so for modifying the file just open the file in r plus mode so this is very special right so just move your file pointer according to that and you can modify right now simply suppose this is my file and i want to put something here a character i want to put f would see and here is the character z in which file just provide the file pointer and that's it so where this z would be written here at the place of h in the starting cursor would be here only so h would not be there and here you can add z the remaining content would be same if suppose i want to add f put again f put as a string like i want to add jenny and fb and after that f close so first the file was high this is awesome so first of all this at the place of this z then jenny so here we have j e double n and y and remaining content would be same so this is what you have modified the this content if you want to modify the content from here just move the file pointer according to that you just have to specify the logic that also will discuss with help of program right in separate video but you can modify your content right if you want to add in the last that also you can do but by default if you write this thing this would be added from here only or this content would be you know updated or modified right if you want to read simply you can read with these functions right the reading logic i have already discussed i hope you can write that logic so the main point about r plus mode is it will open the file for both reading and writing if file don't exist it will not create a new file just give error or you know return the null pointer right and it is used to modify the content of your file right you can move the file pointer where you want to modify which content you want to modify that's it let me show you practical so now let me create a new file here we'll write down our plus mode dot c and i'm just going to copy the previous because this content would be same till this right we have created a file pointer and suppose you don't want this so just comment it out if open abc dot txt just change the mode not a mode we are going to open the file into our plus mode if fp is null just print error and exit now if fp is not null in that case what will happen see ah let me just first of all write down the string f close and that's it so abc dot txt file suppose i am writing here a b dot txt so this file is not there in my pc only the file is abc.txt in that directory right so if this is not the file then what will be the case see let me just run this and show you what output you will get see it is printing error because there is no such file so it will return uh null f open is not going to open the a b dot text file because it don't it doesn't exist so it will later null and if null just print error right but here i am writing abc dot txt right and in abc dot txt i have suppose the content is this is awesome right now let me just open this file and see what output you will get see if you'll open the file okay fine it will open the file but nothing would be there means no output because you are not uh you know reading something from the file so it is not giving it will not give you error like it will not print any error this message right but it will not show you any output so here and the file content would be same this is awesome so now if you want to add something if you want to write suppose i am writing here f put s and i am writing jenny if we just provide the file pointer that's it now let me run this and show you the file it will not show on the screen anything it has successfully run but in the file now you will get jenny and is awesome so this phis this has been updated by this jenny so the cursor would be at the starting at the first byte or the first character right and whatever you will write that would be written from the starting of the file only right and remaining content would be same so jenny is awesome right now suppose uh one more thing f put c i want to add a character also like uh z sorry character would be in single quotes right uh z fb now let me just run this and show you now see in the file we have jenny then z i has been replaced by z and s and then awesome right so i hope you go to what is r plus mode now whenever wherever you want to modify the content if suppose you have a lengthy file five or ten lines or many lines and specific line you want to modify just move the cursor just move the file pointer to that uh you know place and modify that line only right so if you want to modify the already existing content already existed content then you will open the file in r plus mode then it will be beneficial right otherwise reading and writing both wps can also do reading and writing a plus can also do reading and pending writing right but that is the difference only this mode will modify if you want to modify you are supposed to open the file in r plus mode only right and if you want to read the content whatever the content in the file just put the logic of reading the file that i have already discussed in my previous videos so you can check out that and you can put that content so that is assignment for you guys right you will read also and you will write also something right and you will open the file in r plus mode fine so now i guess that's it for this video so i hope you go to this r plus mode in the next video we will see w plus mode and also we will see the difference between r plus and w plus mode right so now in the next video till then bye take
