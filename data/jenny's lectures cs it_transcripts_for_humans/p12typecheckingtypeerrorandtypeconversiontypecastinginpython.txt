00:00 - so in the series of learning python
00:02 - programming language in previous video
00:03 - we have seen what are some primitive
00:05 - data types in python like in float uh
00:09 - boolean and strings although there are
00:11 - many more data types like list range
00:13 - dictionaries
00:14 - and set many more types are there those
00:17 - also will be discussing one by one but
00:19 - basics generally we you know use these
00:20 - kind of data types more and more so
00:23 - these things these data types we have
00:24 - discussed in previous video okay how to
00:26 - use them and all
00:28 - now
00:29 - next thing is if you want to change one
00:32 - data type into another type one type to
00:35 - another type then can you do this thing
00:37 - in python yes we can do and this is
00:38 - known as type casting or type conversion
00:41 - as in c and c plus plus also we can do
00:43 - this thing right
00:45 - if there is an integer we can convert
00:47 - that to float we can convert that to
00:49 - string and vice versa and these kind of
00:51 - things we can do in python also that is
00:53 - known as type conversion or typecasting
00:54 - so this thing will see in this video
00:56 - okay
00:58 - type checking like how to check the type
01:00 - although we have discussed in previous
01:02 - video also like using type function we
01:04 - can do that thing
01:05 - but you will also see this thing and
01:07 - we'll see what is type conversion how to
01:09 - do type conversion type casting and all
01:11 - fine
01:12 - so here i'm uh adding a new file i'm
01:15 - creating a new file new file and just
01:19 - type
01:21 - casting type underscore casting dot p
01:24 - y
01:26 - let's see i
01:28 - have to calculate length of a string we
01:30 - have a len function like len and if i
01:33 - pass here
01:36 - uh jenny catherine
01:39 - so it will find out the length of this
01:42 - genica 3 and i am simply printing that
01:46 - length so just put this function into
01:48 - print function
01:50 - let's run this and see what output just
01:52 - right click on this and run type casting
01:54 - and it will give how many characters are
01:56 - there in this zenika 3 with a space 5 6
01:59 - 7 8 9 10 11 12. so it will give 12 see
02:01 - the length is 12
02:03 - okay it's an integer
02:06 - now suppose
02:07 - in length
02:10 - i am doing what
02:12 - i am passing
02:14 - this thing one two three four five
02:16 - what it will give what do you think
02:18 - let's run this and see it will be five
02:20 - ok fine
02:22 - if i write something like this just a
02:25 - number 1 2 3
02:26 - without these
02:28 - quotes
02:29 - at this time what it will give c it is a
02:32 - type error
02:34 - it is a type error
02:36 - object of type int has no len
02:40 - one two three four five it is an int
02:43 - okay obviously it is a class so it is a
02:45 - variable or you can see it's an object
02:47 - of type hint
02:48 - which is having no lend function lend
02:50 - function is used to calculate length of
02:51 - the strings only so if you pass out the
02:54 - wrong input
02:55 - it will be giving an error but it's a
02:57 - type error not any syntax error okay
02:59 - syntax is correct
03:01 - syntax of line function is correct len
03:03 - and simply in bracket whatever you know
03:05 - for the string you want to find out the
03:06 - length you can just put that thing here
03:08 - but here you are putting in so this is a
03:10 - type error okay
03:13 - same like if we have something like this
03:15 - if we have a
03:17 - you can say coffee machine
03:19 - so you can put here that coffee powder
03:22 - and
03:23 - whatever you want to put like milk and
03:25 - water and all
03:27 - so it will give you coffee but if you
03:30 - uh you know put any you can say curd
03:34 - and you wanna make lassi from that curd
03:36 - and butter
03:38 - so that that machine cannot do that will
03:40 - not work
03:41 - so that coffee machine is like a
03:42 - function
03:43 - so please
03:44 - give proper input
03:46 - the coffee powder and milk and water and
03:48 - all
03:49 - so for this land function also you have
03:51 - to give proper input input is string if
03:54 - you give wrong out wrong input in
03:57 - integer or anything else or a float
03:58 - number
03:59 - it is going to give error but that is
04:02 - type error
04:03 - fine
04:04 - now let's see okay i am giving proper
04:06 - input
04:08 - you can just put in these codes for
04:10 - single quotes that would be considered
04:11 - as string
04:13 - so let's take here i am writing my name
04:16 - jenny khatri
04:18 - and whatever this length
04:20 - that i'm not
04:22 - directly i'm not going to print
04:24 - i'm storing it into a length function
04:27 - sorry ln length variable
04:29 - and i am printing
04:33 - length
04:34 - it's okay it will give 12 fine but now i
04:37 - want to print this line complete line
04:39 - you your name
04:40 - has
04:42 - uh
04:43 - how many character
04:45 - 12 characters
04:46 - this thing
04:47 - so okay we know how to concatenate
04:49 - string we can concatenate your name has
04:52 - and then characters with a plus sign
04:54 - okay fine how you will do
04:57 - i will do like your
05:00 - name
05:00 - has
05:02 - this is a string
05:03 - then plus
05:05 - and then
05:06 - whatever length i'm just putting this
05:09 - then plus
05:10 - and
05:13 - characters
05:15 - what do you think will it work or not
05:18 - let's see
05:20 - let's run this and what it will give
05:23 - see
05:24 - i guess uh
05:26 - you know if you know the data types then
05:30 - here also
05:31 - it will give a type error can only
05:33 - concatenate str not into str
05:38 - so your name has this is a string
05:40 - characters
05:42 - in double quote this is a string but
05:44 - length
05:45 - this is what int
05:48 - length jenny ca3 will give 12 that is an
05:50 - integer so this length will have the
05:52 - number 12 that is an integer we cannot
05:54 - concatenate into a string
05:56 - so it is a type error
05:58 - so now how to solve this problem can we
06:01 - convert this length this integer value
06:03 - to string
06:05 - yes we can do
06:06 - how you can do
06:08 - just
06:08 - write down str
06:11 - in bracket you have to put
06:13 - length
06:14 - now this length it will take
06:16 - integer value but it will convert this
06:18 - function str length will convert it into
06:20 - string now it will work fine let's run
06:23 - this and see
06:24 - now see your name has 12 characters now
06:28 - you are able to concatenate
06:31 - so i hope you got this this is what type
06:32 - casting or type conversion
06:35 - how to check that i have already told
06:37 - you like you can check
06:41 - print
06:42 - and we have a function type
06:44 - and i want to print now i want to check
06:47 - the data type of this length variable so
06:50 - just do this thing now let's run this
06:52 - and now at this point of time this
06:54 - length is having of
06:56 - class
06:57 - int
06:58 - but if you do something like this i am
07:00 - writing like new underscore
07:04 - length equal to str
07:08 - length
07:09 - and after this i am
07:12 - finding out
07:17 - this data type of new length now let's
07:20 - run this and now at this point type it
07:22 - will give you str
07:24 - okay
07:25 - because you have converted okay this
07:27 - length to sdr for this for this line
07:30 - only we are not storing that value in
07:31 - any variable
07:33 - so for this thing it has been converted
07:35 - but after that if you just simply write
07:38 - print
07:40 - and if you want to want to check type l
07:42 - e and gts length
07:46 - then let's run this and what it will
07:47 - give c
07:48 - new length this for this print it is
07:51 - giving class str but for type length it
07:53 - is giving class hint
07:56 - for this line only it has converted but
07:57 - you haven't stored that converted string
08:00 - length into another thing still
08:02 - length variable is of pin type i hope
08:04 - you would have to convert
08:06 - so same we have something like this
08:09 - we have
08:11 - more functions also like
08:16 - int
08:19 - we have
08:20 - load
08:22 - we have
08:24 - str that we have seen see these triple
08:26 - quotes these are multiple line commands
08:28 - so these lines are comments now into
08:31 - this will convert something into int
08:33 - float will convert into float strv will
08:35 - convert into str
08:37 - okay now i hope you know how to check
08:40 - how to convert how to do type conversion
08:42 - how to check the type of you know these
08:45 - variables
08:47 - now i am suppose i am printing print
08:52 - 10 sorry print 10 plus 10
08:57 - what it will give
08:58 - these are integer whole basically you
09:00 - know simply will do addition and it will
09:02 - print
09:03 - 20.
09:06 - see
09:07 - but if i do print
09:10 - this thing
09:11 - i'm going to put these 10 and 10 in
09:14 - double quotes so at this time you will
09:16 - get 10 10 concatenation okay fine
09:19 - if i do something like this just convert
09:22 - this
09:23 - string 10 into integer how to convert
09:26 - write down this end function before this
09:29 - and in bracket
09:30 - this string
09:33 - then int
09:34 - and this thing now you have converted
09:37 - this both the 10 into integer at this
09:40 - point of time you will get 20. see now
09:42 - you are getting 20 because you have
09:43 - converted this string
09:46 - into int okay
09:49 - if i write something like this a is
09:51 - equal to
09:52 - or suppose i am writing
09:56 - print
09:58 - 10
09:59 - i'm writing 10
10:00 - plus
10:04 - this 10 it will give it because this is
10:06 - what integer this is what string
10:09 - so we can convert this into first of all
10:11 - into a float suppose you want to convert
10:13 - it into float so float
10:15 - 10
10:16 - and that's it now it will run and it
10:19 - will give you 20.0 although we haven't
10:22 - done any we haven't write any decimal
10:24 - point but you are converting it into
10:26 - float so automatically it will put a
10:29 - decimal sign and dot 0
10:32 - so 20 dot 0 so this is how you can
10:34 - convert these things
10:36 - but
10:37 - it is not correct see
10:39 - if i write name equal to
10:43 - jen
10:44 - and you want to do print
10:48 - 10
10:50 - 10 plus
10:52 - suppose you want to convert this
10:56 - name
10:57 - let's convert you think let's convert
10:58 - this name into end and then
11:00 - add 10 so both are in int so it will
11:04 - add these thing but this point of time
11:06 - you will get an error although you are
11:08 - getting for this 20 for this
11:10 - uh 20.0 but
11:12 - in line number 18 see this is line
11:15 - number 18
11:17 - it is giving an error value error this
11:19 - time value error
11:21 - invalid literal for ind
11:24 - for ind with base 10
11:27 - so this in this end
11:29 - this name you are giving this is invalid
11:31 - you cannot pass
11:33 - this thing
11:35 - it is not having base 10 see
11:38 - if i write name is equal to 1 2 3
11:41 - and then
11:43 - i do this thing yeah that will work fine
11:46 - it will give you 133
11:48 - this print will give you
11:51 - 133 let's just comment these
11:54 - line out
11:56 - and now let's run this
11:59 - now you can see it is giving you 133
12:01 - because now this
12:03 - name is having base 10 one two three oh
12:06 - it is decimal number so base 10
12:08 - but jenny was not having base 10 that is
12:10 - why it has given you value error okay
12:15 - so i guess now you know how what is type
12:17 - error when you get type error how to
12:19 - check type
12:21 - of the variable just to use type
12:23 - function and how to do type conversion
12:25 - or type casting in float and with the
12:27 - help of in float and str functions
12:30 - right
12:31 - now one assignment for you is one
12:33 - exercise for you is
12:34 - you have to take
12:36 - input from the user
12:38 - okay
12:39 - like two numbers you can take input from
12:41 - the user what is first number what is
12:43 - second number and then you have to add
12:46 - those two numbers
12:47 - okay this is for your assignment
12:49 - assignment so let's pause the video and
12:51 - do it right now
12:52 - okay so how many of you have written
12:55 - this kind of thing like we are taking
12:56 - two variables obviously i am taking
12:58 - first underscore number is equal to
12:59 - input function input enter first number
13:01 - then second number you can take variable
13:03 - m abc xyz also i'm just taking
13:06 - meaningful meaningful name second
13:07 - underscore number is input enter second
13:10 - number and just two sum is equal to
13:11 - first number plus second number and just
13:12 - print sum
13:14 - how many of you have done this thing
13:16 - let's see the answer in the first number
13:19 - suppose i'm entering 1 second number 2
13:22 - but it is
13:23 - the output is 1 2
13:25 - it's not 3
13:27 - so where is there
13:29 - see
13:30 - if you have remembered this input
13:32 - function whatever you will enter you you
13:35 - will take input from this input function
13:37 - that would be considered as
13:39 - string actually
13:40 - so this one is considered as string this
13:42 - two is also string and this plus is just
13:44 - concatenating these two strings one two
13:48 - so okay this is the problem how to
13:51 - you know you have to convert these
13:52 - numbers these things these strings now
13:55 - into integer
13:57 - so you can do this because you know how
13:59 - to convert this thing
14:01 - just convert this
14:03 - like int
14:05 - first number
14:07 - can break it right on first number int
14:10 - and here write down in bracket
14:13 - second number
14:14 - that's it now let's run this and this
14:17 - time see the output
14:19 - now it will ask you same first and first
14:23 - number and second number center first
14:24 - number one two
14:27 - at this time it is printing three
14:29 - because now you have converted i casted
14:31 - the numbers
14:33 - okay so this is the case i hope you got
14:35 - the solution of this exercise also okay
14:38 - so now in this video and the next video
14:40 - will also see one coding exercise for
14:42 - you guys that is little bit difficult
14:45 - there also you have to you know
14:47 - use all the things you have learned
14:50 - by far you know till this video you have
14:53 - learned
14:54 - okay so now in the next video till then
14:55 - bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning python programming language in previous video we have seen what are some primitive data types in python like in float uh boolean and strings although there are many more data types like list range dictionaries and set many more types are there those also will be discussing one by one but basics generally we you know use these kind of data types more and more so these things these data types we have discussed in previous video okay how to use them and all now next thing is if you want to change one data type into another type one type to another type then can you do this thing in python yes we can do and this is known as type casting or type conversion as in c and c plus plus also we can do this thing right if there is an integer we can convert that to float we can convert that to string and vice versa and these kind of things we can do in python also that is known as type conversion or typecasting so this thing will see in this video okay type checking like how to check the type although we have discussed in previous video also like using type function we can do that thing but you will also see this thing and we'll see what is type conversion how to do type conversion type casting and all fine so here i'm uh adding a new file i'm creating a new file new file and just type casting type underscore casting dot p y let's see i have to calculate length of a string we have a len function like len and if i pass here uh jenny catherine so it will find out the length of this genica 3 and i am simply printing that length so just put this function into print function let's run this and see what output just right click on this and run type casting and it will give how many characters are there in this zenika 3 with a space 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12. so it will give 12 see the length is 12 okay it's an integer now suppose in length i am doing what i am passing this thing one two three four five what it will give what do you think let's run this and see it will be five ok fine if i write something like this just a number 1 2 3 without these quotes at this time what it will give c it is a type error it is a type error object of type int has no len one two three four five it is an int okay obviously it is a class so it is a variable or you can see it's an object of type hint which is having no lend function lend function is used to calculate length of the strings only so if you pass out the wrong input it will be giving an error but it's a type error not any syntax error okay syntax is correct syntax of line function is correct len and simply in bracket whatever you know for the string you want to find out the length you can just put that thing here but here you are putting in so this is a type error okay same like if we have something like this if we have a you can say coffee machine so you can put here that coffee powder and whatever you want to put like milk and water and all so it will give you coffee but if you uh you know put any you can say curd and you wanna make lassi from that curd and butter so that that machine cannot do that will not work so that coffee machine is like a function so please give proper input the coffee powder and milk and water and all so for this land function also you have to give proper input input is string if you give wrong out wrong input in integer or anything else or a float number it is going to give error but that is type error fine now let's see okay i am giving proper input you can just put in these codes for single quotes that would be considered as string so let's take here i am writing my name jenny khatri and whatever this length that i'm not directly i'm not going to print i'm storing it into a length function sorry ln length variable and i am printing length it's okay it will give 12 fine but now i want to print this line complete line you your name has uh how many character 12 characters this thing so okay we know how to concatenate string we can concatenate your name has and then characters with a plus sign okay fine how you will do i will do like your name has this is a string then plus and then whatever length i'm just putting this then plus and characters what do you think will it work or not let's see let's run this and what it will give see i guess uh you know if you know the data types then here also it will give a type error can only concatenate str not into str so your name has this is a string characters in double quote this is a string but length this is what int length jenny ca3 will give 12 that is an integer so this length will have the number 12 that is an integer we cannot concatenate into a string so it is a type error so now how to solve this problem can we convert this length this integer value to string yes we can do how you can do just write down str in bracket you have to put length now this length it will take integer value but it will convert this function str length will convert it into string now it will work fine let's run this and see now see your name has 12 characters now you are able to concatenate so i hope you got this this is what type casting or type conversion how to check that i have already told you like you can check print and we have a function type and i want to print now i want to check the data type of this length variable so just do this thing now let's run this and now at this point of time this length is having of class int but if you do something like this i am writing like new underscore length equal to str length and after this i am finding out this data type of new length now let's run this and now at this point type it will give you str okay because you have converted okay this length to sdr for this for this line only we are not storing that value in any variable so for this thing it has been converted but after that if you just simply write print and if you want to want to check type l e and gts length then let's run this and what it will give c new length this for this print it is giving class str but for type length it is giving class hint for this line only it has converted but you haven't stored that converted string length into another thing still length variable is of pin type i hope you would have to convert so same we have something like this we have more functions also like int we have load we have str that we have seen see these triple quotes these are multiple line commands so these lines are comments now into this will convert something into int float will convert into float strv will convert into str okay now i hope you know how to check how to convert how to do type conversion how to check the type of you know these variables now i am suppose i am printing print 10 sorry print 10 plus 10 what it will give these are integer whole basically you know simply will do addition and it will print 20. see but if i do print this thing i'm going to put these 10 and 10 in double quotes so at this time you will get 10 10 concatenation okay fine if i do something like this just convert this string 10 into integer how to convert write down this end function before this and in bracket this string then int and this thing now you have converted this both the 10 into integer at this point of time you will get 20. see now you are getting 20 because you have converted this string into int okay if i write something like this a is equal to or suppose i am writing print 10 i'm writing 10 plus this 10 it will give it because this is what integer this is what string so we can convert this into first of all into a float suppose you want to convert it into float so float 10 and that's it now it will run and it will give you 20.0 although we haven't done any we haven't write any decimal point but you are converting it into float so automatically it will put a decimal sign and dot 0 so 20 dot 0 so this is how you can convert these things but it is not correct see if i write name equal to jen and you want to do print 10 10 plus suppose you want to convert this name let's convert you think let's convert this name into end and then add 10 so both are in int so it will add these thing but this point of time you will get an error although you are getting for this 20 for this uh 20.0 but in line number 18 see this is line number 18 it is giving an error value error this time value error invalid literal for ind for ind with base 10 so this in this end this name you are giving this is invalid you cannot pass this thing it is not having base 10 see if i write name is equal to 1 2 3 and then i do this thing yeah that will work fine it will give you 133 this print will give you 133 let's just comment these line out and now let's run this now you can see it is giving you 133 because now this name is having base 10 one two three oh it is decimal number so base 10 but jenny was not having base 10 that is why it has given you value error okay so i guess now you know how what is type error when you get type error how to check type of the variable just to use type function and how to do type conversion or type casting in float and with the help of in float and str functions right now one assignment for you is one exercise for you is you have to take input from the user okay like two numbers you can take input from the user what is first number what is second number and then you have to add those two numbers okay this is for your assignment assignment so let's pause the video and do it right now okay so how many of you have written this kind of thing like we are taking two variables obviously i am taking first underscore number is equal to input function input enter first number then second number you can take variable m abc xyz also i'm just taking meaningful meaningful name second underscore number is input enter second number and just two sum is equal to first number plus second number and just print sum how many of you have done this thing let's see the answer in the first number suppose i'm entering 1 second number 2 but it is the output is 1 2 it's not 3 so where is there see if you have remembered this input function whatever you will enter you you will take input from this input function that would be considered as string actually so this one is considered as string this two is also string and this plus is just concatenating these two strings one two so okay this is the problem how to you know you have to convert these numbers these things these strings now into integer so you can do this because you know how to convert this thing just convert this like int first number can break it right on first number int and here write down in bracket second number that's it now let's run this and this time see the output now it will ask you same first and first number and second number center first number one two at this time it is printing three because now you have converted i casted the numbers okay so this is the case i hope you got the solution of this exercise also okay so now in this video and the next video will also see one coding exercise for you guys that is little bit difficult there also you have to you know use all the things you have learned by far you know till this video you have learned okay so now in the next video till then bye take care
