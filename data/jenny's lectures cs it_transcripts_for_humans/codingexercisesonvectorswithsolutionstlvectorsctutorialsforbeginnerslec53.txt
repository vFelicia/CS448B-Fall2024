00:00 - hey everyone I hope you all are safe and
00:01 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:03 - C++ programming language we are
00:05 - discussing vectors in C++ in the
00:06 - previous video we have seen different
00:08 - different functions what we can perform
00:09 - on vectors the member functions right
00:12 - now uh we'll be seeing two to three
00:15 - problems like you can say coding
00:16 - exercises on vectors right so these are
00:20 - three uh questions first this is the
00:22 - vector from 1 to 10 and you have to
00:24 - erase all the even numbers from this
00:26 - Vector right in next question we have
00:28 - two vectors and you have to swap the
00:30 - values of these two vectors next is this
00:33 - is the vector and you have to sort this
00:36 - Vector right so take the screenshot of
00:39 - these three questions pause the video
00:42 - and try this out right now now before
00:44 - jumping to the solution I just want to
00:45 - share an exciting news for all the gate
00:47 - aspirant see yesterday there was an
00:49 - event of unacademy gate Champions
00:50 - conclave 2024 the link of that event
00:53 - also I have shared on my Instagram story
00:55 - day before yesterday and in my telegram
00:58 - uh Channel also I hope many of you you
01:00 - have joined their live stream and you
01:01 - have watched that event it was a great
01:26 - event where they have invited all the
01:29 - top rankers great rankers all India rank
01:31 - one all India rank three who were
01:33 - students of an Academy of all the
01:36 - branches right so maybe you can also be
01:38 - a part of this kind of event maybe next
01:41 - year just by starting from the you know
01:43 - best of the Educators in the industry
01:46 - with an academy so here comes what is
01:48 - the exciting news because unacademy is
01:50 - conducting a unacademy scholarship test
01:53 - for gate 2025 on 24th of March at 11:00
01:57 - a.m. and time limit would be 45 minutes
01:59 - and you will get question in this test
02:01 - and this was to curated by their top
02:02 - Educators right and you can enroll for
02:05 - this test freely this is the best part
02:06 - you don't need to pay anything to take
02:08 - this test right plus one more thing what
02:10 - is so special about this test you have a
02:12 - chance to win up to 100% scholarship and
02:14 - some other rewards also like you have a
02:16 - chance to win Amazon vouchers worth
02:18 - worth rupes th000 monthly free test with
02:20 - 30 practice questions so how to enroll
02:23 - for this test enrollment link I'll put
02:24 - in the description box of this video
02:25 - just click on that link and this type of
02:27 - page will be open in front of you right
02:29 - you just have have to enter your mobile
02:31 - number and when whenever you click on
02:33 - enroll for free you'll get an OTP and
02:35 - just verify on that thing right you just
02:39 - verify the OTP so if you want to prepare
02:40 - for gate 2025 better to start early so
02:43 - all the U relevant link and detail I'll
02:45 - put in the description box of this video
02:47 - you can go and check out now let's get
02:50 - back to the solution part of our
02:52 - question so I hope you have done these
02:55 - three exercises two are very simple one
02:57 - is little bit difficult the first one
03:00 - if not it's okay let's try this out so
03:02 - we're going to create a new file
03:04 - first so Vector values are given from 1
03:08 - to 10 and you have to erase only even
03:10 - numbers so yeah we have a function
03:13 - number function erase we can use that in
03:15 - CPP uh
03:16 - sorry in C++ in STL we have this
03:19 - function eras right so you can pass here
03:24 - like a position the position on which
03:27 - you want to delete the element right
03:29 - right itat position or in a Range also
03:32 - we can pass from first to last the first
03:35 - is included last one is not included
03:37 - right okay so for even we have to find
03:40 - out first like
03:42 - even we will first make an iterator okay
03:45 - because you have to iterator is like
03:47 - obviously is going to point the element
03:51 - so iterator will will give us the
03:53 - position the location right and in erase
03:55 - function we pass obviously the position
03:57 - iterator right so let's create an
04:01 - first for the
04:04 - vector v and which is of type int right
04:09 - so same type we are going to take then
04:11 - this and iterator let's suppose the name
04:16 - I'm taking it or any name you can take
04:18 - righty okay not righty right fine now
04:24 - let's suppose this it this iterator is
04:27 - at first we are pointing this to the
04:31 - vector v dot
04:34 - begin in beginning right now the cator
04:36 - is pointing to here right so find out
04:40 - the even number and erase those
04:42 - number so we'll do let's take a y Loop
04:46 - while this
04:47 - iterator not equal
04:49 - to V do end till then obviously we are
04:53 - going to repeat this while loop right
04:57 - now what in while loop we will do so
04:59 - let's check if
05:02 - if the iterator which is pointing to the
05:05 - location on that location if the value
05:08 - is even and how to check mode 2 is equal
05:11 - to equal to Z if the value is even then
05:15 - delete it otherwise just increase just
05:18 - you can say increment the iterator right
05:22 - okay if now how to get the uh value from
05:26 - uh that location we have a d referencing
05:28 - operator S2
05:31 - if estri it so it will give us the value
05:35 - right
05:37 - mode 2 = to equal
05:42 - to0 if this is the
05:44 - case then only we'll call erase function
05:49 - means on this Vector let's call erase
05:52 - and in erase we just pass the iterator
05:54 - means from this position you have to
05:57 - delete the element
06:00 - otherwise we are going to just do what
06:05 - increment the iterator it
06:08 - ++ if erase that element like if
06:11 - iterator is at two then it will it is
06:14 - going to erase this element to right in
06:17 - that case no it ++ because after erasing
06:21 - this element has been destroyed and
06:23 - these all these elements would be
06:25 - repositioned relocated so three would be
06:28 - here four would be here here like one
06:30 - position before right so no need to
06:33 - increment the iterator after two now
06:36 - iterator is here and it is pointing to
06:38 - three right but that if it is not even
06:42 - number like one it is at first at one
06:45 - but this is not even number so increment
06:46 - the now it is at two right then erase it
06:50 - okay I hope you got this so you can just
06:53 - dry run this thing write down this code
06:56 - on a piece of paper and dry run this and
06:59 - after that just print the vector so we
07:03 - we have many method to print the vector
07:06 - one more we'll discuss in this video
07:07 - that I think we have forgot to discuss
07:09 - we can use a range based for Loop right
07:13 - so Auto means it it will automatically
07:15 - detect the data type suppose I'm taking
07:18 - uh any variable name n and from vector
07:24 - v or Auto element here anything a BC
07:28 - element or anything right but this is
07:31 - from where you want to take the values
07:32 - from Vector the name is V so here should
07:35 - be V right now one by one we are going
07:39 - to print C out just
07:42 - n with some
07:44 - space
07:48 - right so at first you know the working
07:51 - of range based for loop from V first the
07:54 - one first element would be assigned to
07:56 - this variable n then one would be
07:58 - printed the next element next element
08:00 - next element till the end of that
08:03 - container obviously Vector is a
08:06 - container so let's run this I hope it
08:12 - works
08:15 - okay I just selected that thing let's
08:17 - run this see 1 3 5 7
08:23 - 9 all even number has been erased right
08:28 - I hope you got this this was not so much
08:29 - stuff let's try now the second one so
08:33 - these two Vector we have and you have to
08:34 - swap the values of these things so
08:36 - simply we have a member function swap
08:39 - you can just check out here uh I think
08:42 - uh we haven't discussed this swap in
08:44 - previous video so let's discuss this
08:45 - thing it is going to exchange the the
08:48 - content of container by the content of X
08:50 - which is another Vector object of the
08:52 - same type size May differ right okay if
08:54 - you're not getting in simple definition
08:56 - we are going to swap the element of
08:58 - vector one with Vector 2 or vector 2
09:00 - with Vector one you can say like this
09:03 - right so let's call this suppose on
09:06 - Vector one or vector 2 we can call vect
09:08 - 1 dot Swap and in bracket with which
09:12 - Vector I want to swap vect
09:16 - two and simply print for Vector one and
09:18 - Vector two range based for Loop we can
09:20 - take we can use or iterator we can use
09:22 - or anything we can use using at you can
09:26 - uh access all the elements at function
09:29 - many ways are there to access the values
09:31 - of these
09:32 - vectors so just call Swap and we are
09:34 - just printing using range range based
09:37 - function these two vectors let's run
09:39 - this and see what you are
09:42 - getting okay let's
09:44 - just write
09:47 - down Vector one and Vector 2 after swap
09:50 - so that you can just you can understand
09:54 - it okay let's just use a slash and here
09:59 - or andle you can
10:01 - [Applause]
10:04 - use see Vector one after swap is this
10:07 - Vector two after swap is this but before
10:09 - swapping this 1 2 3 4 this was Vector
10:11 - one this was Vector 2 so it's very
10:13 - simple right now third sorting just call
10:16 - an algorithm Sol but for that we have to
10:21 - include another header which
10:24 - is
10:26 - algorithm this header here we we have
10:29 - all those algorithms searching sorting
10:31 - and all right
10:34 - so so for sorting also you don't need to
10:37 - write down the complete code for sorting
10:40 - right we simply have a function a m
10:43 - function sort you can just call that and
10:45 - this Vector would be sorted so this is
10:47 - like beauty of using STL right it is
10:49 - going to save a lot of your time right
10:53 - so just call this C
10:57 - sort but if you do not include this
11:01 - algorithm
11:03 - sorry this header we are not able to use
11:07 - this sort see s o r t there is no sort
11:09 - right
11:11 - now so you have to include this header
11:14 - algorithm to use all the algorithms
11:17 - right from that STM sort and what is the
11:20 - syntax from beginning to end you want to
11:22 - sort right see random excess of uh
11:25 - iterator first and then last so from
11:28 - beginning to end
11:31 - so from V the vector name is here vect
11:36 - one so vect 1 dot begin from begin to V
11:42 - sorry 1 dot end from beginning to end we
11:45 - want to perform
11:48 - sorting and simply we can
11:51 - just print the vector one the values of
11:54 - all the vector one after sorting let's
11:57 - run this and see what output you are
11:59 - getting here see -1 2 4 10 60 79 sorted
12:04 - Vector right so these I think two was
12:06 - very simple right first one was a little
12:09 - bit tricky and obviously this one we
12:12 - haven't discussed swep and SW that is
12:14 - why we have we have discussed right now
12:16 - the coding exercises on these algorithms
12:19 - and these member function right I hope
12:22 - you got this right so that's it for this
12:25 - video now I'll see you in the next video
12:27 - then bye-bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of learning C++ programming language we are discussing vectors in C++ in the previous video we have seen different different functions what we can perform on vectors the member functions right now uh we'll be seeing two to three problems like you can say coding exercises on vectors right so these are three uh questions first this is the vector from 1 to 10 and you have to erase all the even numbers from this Vector right in next question we have two vectors and you have to swap the values of these two vectors next is this is the vector and you have to sort this Vector right so take the screenshot of these three questions pause the video and try this out right now now before jumping to the solution I just want to share an exciting news for all the gate aspirant see yesterday there was an event of unacademy gate Champions conclave 2024 the link of that event also I have shared on my Instagram story day before yesterday and in my telegram uh Channel also I hope many of you you have joined their live stream and you have watched that event it was a great event where they have invited all the top rankers great rankers all India rank one all India rank three who were students of an Academy of all the branches right so maybe you can also be a part of this kind of event maybe next year just by starting from the you know best of the Educators in the industry with an academy so here comes what is the exciting news because unacademy is conducting a unacademy scholarship test for gate 2025 on 24th of March at 1100 a.m. and time limit would be 45 minutes and you will get question in this test and this was to curated by their top Educators right and you can enroll for this test freely this is the best part you don't need to pay anything to take this test right plus one more thing what is so special about this test you have a chance to win up to 100% scholarship and some other rewards also like you have a chance to win Amazon vouchers worth worth rupes th000 monthly free test with 30 practice questions so how to enroll for this test enrollment link I'll put in the description box of this video just click on that link and this type of page will be open in front of you right you just have have to enter your mobile number and when whenever you click on enroll for free you'll get an OTP and just verify on that thing right you just verify the OTP so if you want to prepare for gate 2025 better to start early so all the U relevant link and detail I'll put in the description box of this video you can go and check out now let's get back to the solution part of our question so I hope you have done these three exercises two are very simple one is little bit difficult the first one if not it's okay let's try this out so we're going to create a new file first so Vector values are given from 1 to 10 and you have to erase only even numbers so yeah we have a function number function erase we can use that in CPP uh sorry in C++ in STL we have this function eras right so you can pass here like a position the position on which you want to delete the element right right itat position or in a Range also we can pass from first to last the first is included last one is not included right okay so for even we have to find out first like even we will first make an iterator okay because you have to iterator is like obviously is going to point the element so iterator will will give us the position the location right and in erase function we pass obviously the position iterator right so let's create an first for the vector v and which is of type int right so same type we are going to take then this and iterator let's suppose the name I'm taking it or any name you can take righty okay not righty right fine now let's suppose this it this iterator is at first we are pointing this to the vector v dot begin in beginning right now the cator is pointing to here right so find out the even number and erase those number so we'll do let's take a y Loop while this iterator not equal to V do end till then obviously we are going to repeat this while loop right now what in while loop we will do so let's check if if the iterator which is pointing to the location on that location if the value is even and how to check mode 2 is equal to equal to Z if the value is even then delete it otherwise just increase just you can say increment the iterator right okay if now how to get the uh value from uh that location we have a d referencing operator S2 if estri it so it will give us the value right mode 2 = to equal to0 if this is the case then only we'll call erase function means on this Vector let's call erase and in erase we just pass the iterator means from this position you have to delete the element otherwise we are going to just do what increment the iterator it ++ if erase that element like if iterator is at two then it will it is going to erase this element to right in that case no it ++ because after erasing this element has been destroyed and these all these elements would be repositioned relocated so three would be here four would be here here like one position before right so no need to increment the iterator after two now iterator is here and it is pointing to three right but that if it is not even number like one it is at first at one but this is not even number so increment the now it is at two right then erase it okay I hope you got this so you can just dry run this thing write down this code on a piece of paper and dry run this and after that just print the vector so we we have many method to print the vector one more we'll discuss in this video that I think we have forgot to discuss we can use a range based for Loop right so Auto means it it will automatically detect the data type suppose I'm taking uh any variable name n and from vector v or Auto element here anything a BC element or anything right but this is from where you want to take the values from Vector the name is V so here should be V right now one by one we are going to print C out just n with some space right so at first you know the working of range based for loop from V first the one first element would be assigned to this variable n then one would be printed the next element next element next element till the end of that container obviously Vector is a container so let's run this I hope it works okay I just selected that thing let's run this see 1 3 5 7 9 all even number has been erased right I hope you got this this was not so much stuff let's try now the second one so these two Vector we have and you have to swap the values of these things so simply we have a member function swap you can just check out here uh I think uh we haven't discussed this swap in previous video so let's discuss this thing it is going to exchange the the content of container by the content of X which is another Vector object of the same type size May differ right okay if you're not getting in simple definition we are going to swap the element of vector one with Vector 2 or vector 2 with Vector one you can say like this right so let's call this suppose on Vector one or vector 2 we can call vect 1 dot Swap and in bracket with which Vector I want to swap vect two and simply print for Vector one and Vector two range based for Loop we can take we can use or iterator we can use or anything we can use using at you can uh access all the elements at function many ways are there to access the values of these vectors so just call Swap and we are just printing using range range based function these two vectors let's run this and see what you are getting okay let's just write down Vector one and Vector 2 after swap so that you can just you can understand it okay let's just use a slash and here or andle you can use see Vector one after swap is this Vector two after swap is this but before swapping this 1 2 3 4 this was Vector one this was Vector 2 so it's very simple right now third sorting just call an algorithm Sol but for that we have to include another header which is algorithm this header here we we have all those algorithms searching sorting and all right so so for sorting also you don't need to write down the complete code for sorting right we simply have a function a m function sort you can just call that and this Vector would be sorted so this is like beauty of using STL right it is going to save a lot of your time right so just call this C sort but if you do not include this algorithm sorry this header we are not able to use this sort see s o r t there is no sort right now so you have to include this header algorithm to use all the algorithms right from that STM sort and what is the syntax from beginning to end you want to sort right see random excess of uh iterator first and then last so from beginning to end so from V the vector name is here vect one so vect 1 dot begin from begin to V sorry 1 dot end from beginning to end we want to perform sorting and simply we can just print the vector one the values of all the vector one after sorting let's run this and see what output you are getting here see 1 2 4 10 60 79 sorted Vector right so these I think two was very simple right first one was a little bit tricky and obviously this one we haven't discussed swep and SW that is why we have we have discussed right now the coding exercises on these algorithms and these member function right I hope you got this right so that's it for this video now I'll see you in the next video then byebye take care
