00:00 - hey everyone I hope you are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:03 - C++ programming language in the previous
00:05 - video we have seen infinite Loops now in
00:08 - this video we'll see nested Loops in C++
00:10 - what are nested loops and the important
00:12 - point is what we will see is need of
00:15 - nested Loops why we use nested loops and
00:18 - when to use nested loops with the help
00:21 - of program also I'll show you okay now
00:24 - in simple term if I say nested Loops
00:27 - means a loop within a loop that is
00:30 - nested Loop right if a loop is inside
00:33 - another loop that is nothing but nested
00:35 - Loop right if General syntax if I say
00:39 - then it's something like this nested
00:42 - Loops for Loop can be nested Loops while
00:44 - loop do while loop and these see so we
00:47 - have a for Loop here and within this for
00:51 - Loop we have another for Loop right so
00:54 - this is why what nested for Loop if you
00:58 - have y Loop that is also fine
01:00 - we have while loop here we have
01:02 - condition within this we have one more
01:04 - wi Loop right so this white Loop is
01:07 - within this while loop so this is nested
01:09 - while loop this is known as inner loop
01:11 - this is known as outer loop inner four
01:13 - Loop outer for loop it's not like that
01:15 - only two level of two level is possible
01:18 - like one Loop within another loop
01:20 - no nesting can be possible up to many
01:23 - level within this for Loop we can have
01:25 - one more for Loop within this we can
01:28 - have one more for Loop and up to many
01:31 - level right nesting is
01:34 - possible Right same with while loop same
01:37 - with do Loop and it is also possible
01:40 - within a while loop we have a four
01:42 - Loop this is also nesting it is also
01:46 - possible within a for Loop we have a wi
01:48 - Loop then within wi Loop we have for
01:51 - Loop then again we have wi Loop mixing
01:53 - of this these Loops are also possible in
01:56 - nesting right nesting of range based for
01:59 - Loop is also possible up to many levels
02:02 - any levels right now this is what
02:05 - nesting but now when to use this nested
02:10 - loops and why we use what is need of
02:12 - nested Loops see generally when you deal
02:15 - with multi-dimensional arrays like 2D
02:17 - array 3D array and these arrays then we
02:20 - use nested Loops when you draw that
02:24 - pattern printing programs star with
02:27 - alphabets or these pattern then you have
02:30 - to use nested Loops when you to deal
02:32 - with like uh data having more than one
02:35 - dimension if data is in a matrix or
02:37 - histogram or these kind of thing in a
02:39 - chart then we deal with that data with
02:42 - nested Loops right see you can say like
02:48 - these nested Loops are used basically
02:49 - for pattern printing or for displaying
02:51 - multi-dimensional data right now let's
02:54 - take a simple example then you will get
02:56 - to know the need of this Loop if you
02:57 - want to print these pack these t five
03:00 - star then simply will say either see out
03:05 - it not like that simply print here like
03:07 - star star star star
03:09 - no okay you can do this thing also this
03:12 - will give you the same result but either
03:14 - you can do that thing or you can uh put
03:18 - like something like this and five C out
03:20 - statement but that is not a good idea we
03:23 - are repeating the same thing we're
03:24 - printing star so if you're repeating
03:26 - something we use Loops here right so I
03:29 - can put something like this we have a
03:31 - full loop and we have like I is equal to
03:34 - 1 and I should be less than equal to how
03:37 - many times 1 2 3 4 five times I want to
03:39 - print less than equal to 5 and I
03:41 - ++ right within this I can print star so
03:45 - this will give you this result right
03:48 - five time the star will be printed okay
03:49 - fine now suppose I want to print this
03:53 - pattern now we have data
03:56 - in 2D more than one dimension
04:00 - previous data was in having only one
04:02 - dimension now we have two Dimension this
04:04 - and this right rows and columns you can
04:09 - say it's a matrix form of something like
04:11 - this right now I want to print this kind
04:13 - of thing
04:15 - so
04:18 - this this process is used to print this
04:22 - line this full loop right now again same
04:26 - five star I want to print same five star
04:29 - I want to print same five star I want to
04:31 - print right means basically we are
04:34 - repeating this process we want to repeat
04:37 - this process so either you can write
04:39 - down here same process like same for
04:42 - Loop here four for Loop one for this one
04:45 - for this one for this one for this but
04:47 - obviously that is not a good idea
04:48 - writing four four Loops for four lines
04:51 - no so here we use nested loops loops
04:54 - within Loop so we want to repeat this
04:58 - process again right so same whatever you
05:01 - want to repeat that thing we put in a
05:04 - loop either four while four while while
05:06 - or any Loop right so this process again
05:09 - we put in a suppose for Loop this this
05:13 - complete thing right so how many times
05:16 - this should be repeated how many rows
05:19 - are there 1 2 3 4 four times right so
05:24 - this outer loop should be repeated four
05:26 - times right so we put some something
05:29 - like this in any variable you can take
05:32 - suppose I'm taking J J is equal to 1 J
05:35 - less than equal to how many times 1 2 3
05:37 - 4 4 and J
05:40 - ++ and within this we have this inner
05:44 - for Loop right but generally in for Loop
05:47 - we say like in outer for Loop we take
05:49 - variable I for inner for Loop we take
05:52 - J I'm not saying that it is wrong you
05:55 - cannot take J here you cannot take I
05:57 - here no but generally we put something
05:59 - like this
06:00 - here we take I in for outer for
06:03 - Loop and for inner we take J it's maybe
06:07 - something like maybe J comes after I in
06:11 - alphabetic order that is why we are
06:13 - doing this but I don't know but it's not
06:16 - something like it's a rule no it's not
06:18 - any rule you can take any variable
06:20 - right now now there is one problem here
06:24 - see
06:25 - first in I so we have a variable I that
06:28 - is one this condition is true so we will
06:31 - enter here now again we have a variable
06:33 - J that is one condition true so enter
06:36 - here first star would be printed right
06:39 - now we are still in this inner loop so
06:42 - now j++ now J becomes two condition true
06:46 - again star would be printed again j++ J
06:49 - becomes three condition true again star
06:51 - would be printed now j++ J becomes four
06:54 - condition true again star would be
06:56 - printed now J becomes five condition
06:58 - true again n star would be printed now J
07:01 - becomes six is this condition true no
07:04 - now we'll be out of this inner four
07:08 - Loop right now out of this inner for
07:11 - loop after that it will go to here I ++
07:15 - now I becomes two but we want to print
07:17 - the next next these five stars in Next
07:21 - plan so after this for Loop you have to
07:25 - put a new line sln or andl after this
07:29 - four Loop but within this outer loop so
07:32 - After exiting if J is six means
07:34 - condition is not true exit from this
07:36 - four Loop so whatever you will write
07:37 - after this for Loop just after the
07:39 - statement that would be executed means
07:40 - slash and Slash and means the control
07:41 - would be here
07:43 - now now I ++ now I becomes two now
07:47 - condition true again we will enter here
07:48 - now same for I2 same would be repeated J
07:53 - 1 2 3 4 5 and five star would be
07:56 - printed right so so this is the case so
08:00 - here in these cases we need nested Loops
08:05 - but it is recommended not to use nested
08:07 - Loops actually because of the complexity
08:09 - and you know complex readability of the
08:11 - program whatever you do with nested Loop
08:14 - that thing we can also do with with
08:16 - other methods also that are more
08:17 - manageable more readable and less time
08:21 - consuming right but if it is mandatory
08:24 - to use nested Loops then you can use it
08:28 - so this is I I think you got why we need
08:31 - nested loops and what is need of nested
08:33 - loops and working of nested Loops for
08:35 - one iteration of this outer
08:38 - loop this inner loop will have how many
08:41 - iteration five iteration right so if you
08:46 - uh take a real life example of these
08:48 - nested Loop you see the working of this
08:52 - type of nested loop I hope you want the
08:54 - working right in your daily life daily
08:58 - you see
08:59 - so you can just write down the real life
09:02 - example of using this nested Loop
09:05 - phenomena this nested Loop pattern in
09:08 - comment section you just think and write
09:10 - down one thing let me just tell you we
09:13 - can take example of cloak one three hand
09:16 - one hour and minute and and second so
09:21 - this second will move the second hand
09:24 - will
09:24 - move in every 60 seconds 60 times after
09:28 - that
09:29 - after completing the 60 this minute will
09:31 - move one step like 1 minute then again
09:35 - for next minute this this this uh Second
09:38 - Hand move 60 times then again it will
09:40 - move 1 minute again it will move one 1
09:43 - minute so this is kind
09:45 - of nested Loops so let's let's do some
09:48 - practical of this nested Loop how to
09:50 - print the this kind of star okay so
09:53 - let's create a new file nested loop.
09:56 - CPP same first we will take
09:59 - that
10:01 - header then name space using name space
10:04 - s2d and in main we will uh draw that
10:09 - pattern right so in outter for Loop out
10:13 - for Loop is for you can say for the rows
10:15 - number of rows and inner for Loop is for
10:17 - number of columns in each rows so outer
10:20 - for Loop would be traded for how many
10:23 - number of rows are there in that pattern
10:24 - four right and for every Row the inner
10:28 - loop would be rated five times because
10:30 - you have to print five star so actual
10:32 - printing is done with the inner for rule
10:37 - right so I is equal to 1 and this would
10:40 - be number of rows here we have done
10:43 - hardcoded we are taking like four and
10:45 - this or you can take here like from user
10:48 - you can ask enter number of rows enter
10:49 - number of columns something like this
10:51 - right that is also
10:55 - fine so now we have another for Loop in
10:58 - J is equal to 1 and J less than equal to
11:01 - how many Star I want to print in each
11:03 - row five star so j++ and then actually
11:08 - we are printing
11:10 - here in inner loop
11:13 - Star right and after this after every
11:16 - after completing the
11:18 - iteration of inner loop five iteration
11:22 - the next for next row would be in next
11:25 - line so after this you have to put
11:27 - either endl or slash
11:31 - right and just write down return 0 for
11:33 - successful completion and let's run this
11:35 - and I'll show you the output now
11:39 - see this is the
11:41 - pattern right so like this using nested
11:46 - Loops we can do we can draw different
11:48 - different type of pattern we already
11:50 - have a playlist of pattern printing but
11:53 - that that is in C language but it's not
11:56 - you know so much different because synx
11:58 - is almost same print F here see out and
12:01 - something like this right so those that
12:04 - playlist you can check pattern printing
12:07 - playlist in C so this is the use of you
12:10 - can say nest if you want to deal with
12:13 - metrix also or we use like 4
12:17 - 43 nested for Loop right that is also
12:20 - fine that generally we do when we do
12:22 - multiplication of two matrics right I J
12:24 - K three Loops we need right that also we
12:26 - have discussed when we were discussing C
12:28 - programming language the link I'll put
12:30 - in the side button you can check out
12:31 - that video also right so any level of
12:34 - nesting is possible four four again four
12:36 - again four or here also while four four
12:38 - while do while nesting of do while
12:40 - nesting of range for Loop thing is
12:43 - possible right so it it's your
12:45 - assignment you have to do this same kind
12:47 - of things you have to draw same pattern
12:48 - with doy Loop do while loop as well as
12:52 - with Y Loop right so the the there's two
12:55 - program you have to write you can just
12:58 - uh write down that code in comment
12:59 - section so in the next video we'll see
13:01 - one coding exercise on nested Loops so
13:03 - now I'll see you in the next video till
13:05 - then bye-bye take
13:09 - care

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning C++ programming language in the previous video we have seen infinite Loops now in this video we'll see nested Loops in C++ what are nested loops and the important point is what we will see is need of nested Loops why we use nested loops and when to use nested loops with the help of program also I'll show you okay now in simple term if I say nested Loops means a loop within a loop that is nested Loop right if a loop is inside another loop that is nothing but nested Loop right if General syntax if I say then it's something like this nested Loops for Loop can be nested Loops while loop do while loop and these see so we have a for Loop here and within this for Loop we have another for Loop right so this is why what nested for Loop if you have y Loop that is also fine we have while loop here we have condition within this we have one more wi Loop right so this white Loop is within this while loop so this is nested while loop this is known as inner loop this is known as outer loop inner four Loop outer for loop it's not like that only two level of two level is possible like one Loop within another loop no nesting can be possible up to many level within this for Loop we can have one more for Loop within this we can have one more for Loop and up to many level right nesting is possible Right same with while loop same with do Loop and it is also possible within a while loop we have a four Loop this is also nesting it is also possible within a for Loop we have a wi Loop then within wi Loop we have for Loop then again we have wi Loop mixing of this these Loops are also possible in nesting right nesting of range based for Loop is also possible up to many levels any levels right now this is what nesting but now when to use this nested loops and why we use what is need of nested Loops see generally when you deal with multidimensional arrays like 2D array 3D array and these arrays then we use nested Loops when you draw that pattern printing programs star with alphabets or these pattern then you have to use nested Loops when you to deal with like uh data having more than one dimension if data is in a matrix or histogram or these kind of thing in a chart then we deal with that data with nested Loops right see you can say like these nested Loops are used basically for pattern printing or for displaying multidimensional data right now let's take a simple example then you will get to know the need of this Loop if you want to print these pack these t five star then simply will say either see out it not like that simply print here like star star star star no okay you can do this thing also this will give you the same result but either you can do that thing or you can uh put like something like this and five C out statement but that is not a good idea we are repeating the same thing we're printing star so if you're repeating something we use Loops here right so I can put something like this we have a full loop and we have like I is equal to 1 and I should be less than equal to how many times 1 2 3 4 five times I want to print less than equal to 5 and I ++ right within this I can print star so this will give you this result right five time the star will be printed okay fine now suppose I want to print this pattern now we have data in 2D more than one dimension previous data was in having only one dimension now we have two Dimension this and this right rows and columns you can say it's a matrix form of something like this right now I want to print this kind of thing so this this process is used to print this line this full loop right now again same five star I want to print same five star I want to print same five star I want to print right means basically we are repeating this process we want to repeat this process so either you can write down here same process like same for Loop here four for Loop one for this one for this one for this one for this but obviously that is not a good idea writing four four Loops for four lines no so here we use nested loops loops within Loop so we want to repeat this process again right so same whatever you want to repeat that thing we put in a loop either four while four while while or any Loop right so this process again we put in a suppose for Loop this this complete thing right so how many times this should be repeated how many rows are there 1 2 3 4 four times right so this outer loop should be repeated four times right so we put some something like this in any variable you can take suppose I'm taking J J is equal to 1 J less than equal to how many times 1 2 3 4 4 and J ++ and within this we have this inner for Loop right but generally in for Loop we say like in outer for Loop we take variable I for inner for Loop we take J I'm not saying that it is wrong you cannot take J here you cannot take I here no but generally we put something like this here we take I in for outer for Loop and for inner we take J it's maybe something like maybe J comes after I in alphabetic order that is why we are doing this but I don't know but it's not something like it's a rule no it's not any rule you can take any variable right now now there is one problem here see first in I so we have a variable I that is one this condition is true so we will enter here now again we have a variable J that is one condition true so enter here first star would be printed right now we are still in this inner loop so now j++ now J becomes two condition true again star would be printed again j++ J becomes three condition true again star would be printed now j++ J becomes four condition true again star would be printed now J becomes five condition true again n star would be printed now J becomes six is this condition true no now we'll be out of this inner four Loop right now out of this inner for loop after that it will go to here I ++ now I becomes two but we want to print the next next these five stars in Next plan so after this for Loop you have to put a new line sln or andl after this four Loop but within this outer loop so After exiting if J is six means condition is not true exit from this four Loop so whatever you will write after this for Loop just after the statement that would be executed means slash and Slash and means the control would be here now now I ++ now I becomes two now condition true again we will enter here now same for I2 same would be repeated J 1 2 3 4 5 and five star would be printed right so so this is the case so here in these cases we need nested Loops but it is recommended not to use nested Loops actually because of the complexity and you know complex readability of the program whatever you do with nested Loop that thing we can also do with with other methods also that are more manageable more readable and less time consuming right but if it is mandatory to use nested Loops then you can use it so this is I I think you got why we need nested loops and what is need of nested loops and working of nested Loops for one iteration of this outer loop this inner loop will have how many iteration five iteration right so if you uh take a real life example of these nested Loop you see the working of this type of nested loop I hope you want the working right in your daily life daily you see so you can just write down the real life example of using this nested Loop phenomena this nested Loop pattern in comment section you just think and write down one thing let me just tell you we can take example of cloak one three hand one hour and minute and and second so this second will move the second hand will move in every 60 seconds 60 times after that after completing the 60 this minute will move one step like 1 minute then again for next minute this this this uh Second Hand move 60 times then again it will move 1 minute again it will move one 1 minute so this is kind of nested Loops so let's let's do some practical of this nested Loop how to print the this kind of star okay so let's create a new file nested loop. CPP same first we will take that header then name space using name space s2d and in main we will uh draw that pattern right so in outter for Loop out for Loop is for you can say for the rows number of rows and inner for Loop is for number of columns in each rows so outer for Loop would be traded for how many number of rows are there in that pattern four right and for every Row the inner loop would be rated five times because you have to print five star so actual printing is done with the inner for rule right so I is equal to 1 and this would be number of rows here we have done hardcoded we are taking like four and this or you can take here like from user you can ask enter number of rows enter number of columns something like this right that is also fine so now we have another for Loop in J is equal to 1 and J less than equal to how many Star I want to print in each row five star so j++ and then actually we are printing here in inner loop Star right and after this after every after completing the iteration of inner loop five iteration the next for next row would be in next line so after this you have to put either endl or slash right and just write down return 0 for successful completion and let's run this and I'll show you the output now see this is the pattern right so like this using nested Loops we can do we can draw different different type of pattern we already have a playlist of pattern printing but that that is in C language but it's not you know so much different because synx is almost same print F here see out and something like this right so those that playlist you can check pattern printing playlist in C so this is the use of you can say nest if you want to deal with metrix also or we use like 4 43 nested for Loop right that is also fine that generally we do when we do multiplication of two matrics right I J K three Loops we need right that also we have discussed when we were discussing C programming language the link I'll put in the side button you can check out that video also right so any level of nesting is possible four four again four again four or here also while four four while do while nesting of do while nesting of range for Loop thing is possible right so it it's your assignment you have to do this same kind of things you have to draw same pattern with doy Loop do while loop as well as with Y Loop right so the the there's two program you have to write you can just uh write down that code in comment section so in the next video we'll see one coding exercise on nested Loops so now I'll see you in the next video till then byebye take care
