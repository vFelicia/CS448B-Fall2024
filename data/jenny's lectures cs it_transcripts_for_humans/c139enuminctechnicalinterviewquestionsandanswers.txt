00:10 - questions that has been asked in
00:11 - technical round on enumbria type right
00:13 - and if you are aware about the
00:15 - properties of enum data type that we
00:17 - have discussed in previous video then
00:18 - you can easily answer these questions
00:20 - these are not so tough type of questions
00:23 - right so better to go for that video

02:11 - get it right next time so all the
02:13 - relevant links and details i'll put in
02:15 - the description box of this video you
02:16 - can go and check out now let's see those
02:19 - two questions that we are going to
02:20 - discuss those two interview questions on
02:22 - enum let me just write down though those
02:25 - questions first
02:26 - so these are two questions first we'll
02:28 - discuss this question see
02:30 - outside this main we have
02:32 - defined a data type with the help of
02:34 - this enum enum xenum right and the list
02:37 - of constant in this is what c cpp and
02:40 - java that's it now in main function i'm
02:42 - declaring a variable where of this data
02:44 - type and i'm just printing size of where
02:47 - right now what output you will get here
02:50 - what output you will get here
02:52 - first of all thing and now remember the
02:54 - property
02:55 - see whenever you declare a variable of
02:57 - this enum then at one time it can take
03:01 - only one value from out from these
03:04 - values out of these values only one
03:06 - value at a time at a time only one value
03:09 - right and by default
03:11 - this would be considered as 0 1 2
03:14 - by the compiler as in teasers zero one
03:17 - two right and the size of integer is on
03:20 - sixty four bit
03:22 - bit machine i am
03:24 - running this right so the size of it is
03:27 - four bytes so that is why size of where
03:29 - would be four bytes here
03:33 - maybe in options mcqs you will get like
03:35 - four bytes or one is like 12 bytes or
03:38 - some error these kind of things you will
03:39 - get right so the answer would be four
03:41 - bytes only it will take at one time only
03:44 - one value and the value is these are
03:45 - related with constant like zero one two
03:48 - ah sorry integers so integer is taking
03:51 - four byte in sixty four bit machine so
03:53 - it will give four bytes now if i modify
03:55 - this with this thing enum
03:58 - one more enum y enum
04:01 - and here i'm writing c
04:03 - cpp java and
04:05 - xenum
04:08 - right and in main
04:11 - i am
04:12 - i'm doing what
04:15 - why enum wire and size of where
04:19 - so what output you will get in this case
04:21 - see
04:22 - one property i have told you that in the
04:24 - same scope
04:26 - same values of these these same values
04:29 - are not allowed
04:30 - see cpp java these are
04:32 - same so it is not allowed it will give
04:34 - error but see here i'm using in enum i'm
04:37 - using another in enum this is
04:40 - another em i using this is allowed this
04:42 - will not give error but yeah these
04:44 - values are duplicate because in the same
04:47 - scope we are using two enum and these
04:49 - constant are same so it will give error
04:51 - right right
04:53 - yeah enum with an enum is allowed but
04:55 - these duplicates are not allowed
04:57 - right i hope you got this now you can
04:59 - try out this thing another thing is what
05:01 - you can remove just to this and just
05:04 - write down x enum here that's it and
05:06 - then what output you will get this is
05:07 - assignment for you
05:09 - you have to tell me in comment box
05:11 - run this program and tell me what
05:13 - you will get here size of where
05:15 - next is all this thing see here i am
05:17 - using typedef
05:19 - enum
05:20 - within the cinema the values are male
05:22 - and female only two values and
05:25 - gender name of this is gender i mean
05:27 - main function gender where i am
05:30 - declaring a variable of the senum type
05:31 - and i am assigning the value female and
05:34 - i am printing this where so now what
05:36 - output you will get
05:38 - male is zero by default female is one so
05:40 - here you will get
05:42 - one
05:43 - but you have to tell me you are supposed
05:45 - to run this program and you have to tell
05:46 - me
05:47 - the these answers are correct or not
05:49 - maybe i am wrong
05:51 - right so run these programs
05:54 - tell me you are getting you know
05:56 - error or you are getting same output or
05:58 - not maybe in this you will get error
06:00 - like here i am using only gender i am
06:02 - not using enum here but here i am using
06:04 - enum and i have told you
06:06 - in the previous video also when you are
06:07 - declaring a variable you are supposed to
06:09 - use enum
06:10 - then the name but in
06:12 - here i am using only
06:14 - i'm not using enum i'm using only gender
06:17 - so maybe you think it will give error
06:19 - just run it and if it is don't giving
06:21 - any error you are getting one then why
06:24 - you are getting correct output why it is
06:25 - not giving error why
06:29 - the answer of this question you are
06:30 - supposed to write down in common books
06:32 - right why
06:34 - if you don't know then you can ask me in
06:36 - comment box i'll tell you in a another
06:38 - video whenever we'll make another video
06:40 - then i'll tell you the answer of these
06:41 - questions right i hope not these see
06:44 - these questions i guess very simple if
06:46 - you know the properties of enum
06:48 - right then these questions are very
06:50 - simple for you guys
06:52 - so that's it for this video now and i'll
06:54 - see the next video till then bye bye
06:55 - take care

with the detailed explanation of all the concepts and the course will be covered in both indian english and notes would be given to him given to you in english only and all your doubts will get cleared in separate doubt clearing sessions but this is paid subscription you can use my code jkl10 to get extra 10 percent off on these subscriptions and they're also conducting a combat on 27th of march at 11 am it is a live test and you can take this test for free so here you will get a chance to compete with thousands of learners from all over india and you stand a chance to win up to 100 scholarship and with the help of personalized rating and scoring you can measure your progress constantly and after every combat you will get detailed video solutions by their experts so you can identify your weak ideas you can improve according to that and you can get it right next time so all the relevant links and details i'll put in the description box of this video you can go and check out now let's see those two questions that we are going to discuss those two interview questions on enum let me just write down though those questions first so these are two questions first we'll discuss this question see outside this main we have defined a data type with the help of this enum enum xenum right and the list of constant in this is what c cpp and java that's it now in main function i'm declaring a variable where of this data type and i'm just printing size of where right now what output you will get here what output you will get here first of all thing and now remember the property see whenever you declare a variable of this enum then at one time it can take only one value from out from these values out of these values only one value at a time at a time only one value right and by default this would be considered as 0 1 2 by the compiler as in teasers zero one two right and the size of integer is on sixty four bit bit machine i am running this right so the size of it is four bytes so that is why size of where would be four bytes here maybe in options mcqs you will get like four bytes or one is like 12 bytes or some error these kind of things you will get right so the answer would be four bytes only it will take at one time only one value and the value is these are related with constant like zero one two ah sorry integers so integer is taking four byte in sixty four bit machine so it will give four bytes now if i modify this with this thing enum one more enum y enum and here i'm writing c cpp java and xenum right and in main i am i'm doing what why enum wire and size of where so what output you will get in this case see one property i have told you that in the same scope same values of these these same values are not allowed see cpp java these are same so it is not allowed it will give error but see here i'm using in enum i'm using another in enum this is another em i using this is allowed this will not give error but yeah these values are duplicate because in the same scope we are using two enum and these constant are same so it will give error right right yeah enum with an enum is allowed but these duplicates are not allowed right i hope you got this now you can try out this thing another thing is what you can remove just to this and just write down x enum here that's it and then what output you will get this is assignment for you you have to tell me in comment box run this program and tell me what you will get here size of where next is all this thing see here i am using typedef enum within the cinema the values are male and female only two values and gender name of this is gender i mean main function gender where i am declaring a variable of the senum type and i am assigning the value female and i am printing this where so now what output you will get male is zero by default female is one so here you will get one but you have to tell me you are supposed to run this program and you have to tell me the these answers are correct or not maybe i am wrong right so run these programs tell me you are getting you know error or you are getting same output or not maybe in this you will get error like here i am using only gender i am not using enum here but here i am using enum and i have told you in the previous video also when you are declaring a variable you are supposed to use enum then the name but in here i am using only i'm not using enum i'm using only gender so maybe you think it will give error just run it and if it is don't giving any error you are getting one then why you are getting correct output why it is not giving error why the answer of this question you are supposed to write down in common books right why if you don't know then you can ask me in comment box i'll tell you in a another video whenever we'll make another video then i'll tell you the answer of these questions right i hope not these see these questions i guess very simple if you know the properties of enum right then these questions are very simple for you guys so that's it for this video now and i'll see the next video till then bye bye take care
