00:00 - so in the series of running Python
00:01 - programming language in the previous
00:03 - video we have seen uh conditional
00:05 - statements like what is if what is if
00:07 - else statement and how to use them the
00:09 - syntax and all now based on that we will
00:11 - do one coding exercise now you have to
00:13 - find out that that is very simple one
00:16 - the given number is even a road number
00:18 - even number means that is divided by 2
00:20 - and with no remainder completely
00:23 - divisible by 2 like 2 is even number 34
00:27 - is even number like this right so using
00:29 - input function you need to take input
00:31 - and then you have to check based on some
00:33 - condition and all right and I hope you
00:36 - remember when operator module operator
00:38 - that will give remainder
00:40 - in arithmetic operator when we were
00:42 - discussing we have discussed this thing
00:44 - right what is modulo operator you have
00:46 - to use this thing because it will give
00:48 - remainder and obviously you need to
00:50 - check remainder if the number is divided
00:52 - by 2 and there is no remainder then that
00:55 - is an even number so let this now pause
00:58 - the video and try out this program so
01:00 - let's create a new file here and we'll
01:03 - be writing what
01:05 - coding underscore excess size 6 dot p y
01:11 - okay let's take a number
01:13 - you have to check number is even a road
01:15 - right
01:17 - number
01:18 - and while entering I'll
01:21 - convert that into int input
01:28 - enter a number
01:29 - right
01:31 - now we have a number so put some
01:32 - condition if
01:34 - this number
01:37 - mode 2 equal to equal to 0.
01:42 - colon
01:45 - print
01:47 - obviously this this is what
01:51 - this is
01:53 - even number
01:55 - right
01:56 - else
01:59 - colon
02:02 - what we will print
02:07 - this is our number
02:09 - right
02:11 - so you can put this thing in single coat
02:14 - also
02:15 - actually I am from that C plus plus your
02:18 - Java background that is why I put double
02:21 - quotes but you can use single code where
02:23 - that is also fine
02:24 - now and you can put this condition in
02:27 - bracket also that is also fine without
02:29 - bracket also all fine now let's run this
02:32 - so obviously if the number is divisible
02:35 - by 2 with no remainder
02:37 - right that is even number and remainder
02:39 - which operator will give us remainder
02:41 - module operator it will give remainder
02:44 - so if remainder is 0 then this is even
02:46 - number otherwise it is our number let's
02:47 - run this and enter a number 34.
02:52 - obviously 34 is even number so this is
02:55 - even number let me just run this again
02:59 - 33
03:01 - this is odd number because there would
03:04 - be a reminder remember there is one so
03:06 - this is our number so this is simple you
03:09 - know
03:10 - how to use if else whatever we have
03:13 - discussed in previous video that thing
03:14 - you have to put in as a in the form of
03:17 - program right
03:18 - so I hope you have done this coding
03:20 - exercise in the next video we'll see
03:21 - some more conditional statements so now
03:23 - it's in the next video till then bye
03:24 - take

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of running Python programming language in the previous video we have seen uh conditional statements like what is if what is if else statement and how to use them the syntax and all now based on that we will do one coding exercise now you have to find out that that is very simple one the given number is even a road number even number means that is divided by 2 and with no remainder completely divisible by 2 like 2 is even number 34 is even number like this right so using input function you need to take input and then you have to check based on some condition and all right and I hope you remember when operator module operator that will give remainder in arithmetic operator when we were discussing we have discussed this thing right what is modulo operator you have to use this thing because it will give remainder and obviously you need to check remainder if the number is divided by 2 and there is no remainder then that is an even number so let this now pause the video and try out this program so let's create a new file here and we'll be writing what coding underscore excess size 6 dot p y okay let's take a number you have to check number is even a road right number and while entering I'll convert that into int input enter a number right now we have a number so put some condition if this number mode 2 equal to equal to 0. colon print obviously this this is what this is even number right else colon what we will print this is our number right so you can put this thing in single coat also actually I am from that C plus plus your Java background that is why I put double quotes but you can use single code where that is also fine now and you can put this condition in bracket also that is also fine without bracket also all fine now let's run this so obviously if the number is divisible by 2 with no remainder right that is even number and remainder which operator will give us remainder module operator it will give remainder so if remainder is 0 then this is even number otherwise it is our number let's run this and enter a number 34. obviously 34 is even number so this is even number let me just run this again 33 this is odd number because there would be a reminder remember there is one so this is our number so this is simple you know how to use if else whatever we have discussed in previous video that thing you have to put in as a in the form of program right so I hope you have done this coding exercise in the next video we'll see some more conditional statements so now it's in the next video till then bye take
