00:00 - so in the series of learning c
00:01 - programming we are discussing previous
00:03 - year gate questions on functions in the
00:05 - last video we have discussed one
00:07 - question
00:07 - and in this video we will discuss this
00:09 - question that came into gate 2000 so
00:11 - this the question was
00:13 - you are given a code and
00:15 - you you are asked like what is the value
00:18 - of j
00:19 - what is value of j after the execution
00:22 - of the score this was the question you
00:23 - have to tell value of j
00:25 - right so now we will discuss this
00:26 - question we will try it in this program
00:28 - and i'll show you on my laptop also
00:29 - practically right but before i just want
00:31 - to tell you one thing
00:32 - if you want to build a great career in
00:34 - software development then you must think
00:36 - about the aspects like what's trending
00:37 - in the industry the questions being
00:39 - asked in the interviews what is the
00:41 - thought process behind the great
00:42 - application like amazon flipkart zometo
00:44 - ola and how to improve your code share
00:46 - ranking so here an academy brings you a
00:48 - platform where you can get access to
00:50 - weekly shows which you can watch live
00:52 - and the host of these shows are working
00:54 - in some of the top companies like google
00:55 - linkedin amazon are and are seven star
00:58 - coders on code chef and industry experts
01:01 - with years of experience
01:03 - so here they are going to cover
01:05 - the content which would be really
01:07 - helpful for your career like in the live
01:09 - episodes you can you can get the
01:11 - opportunity to ask take a charge about
01:13 - the top 20 questions being asked and the
01:15 - industry leaders about the recruitment
01:17 - process in top in you know top startups
01:19 - and mncs what is the eligibility
01:21 - criteria and how to apply for them you
01:23 - can also get your resume reviewed by the
01:25 - experts
01:26 - and not only this you can also
01:27 - participate into mock interviews and
01:29 - also learn courses on programming
01:31 - languages cloud computing blockchain and
01:33 - crypto tech aspects of digital marketing
01:36 - and data analytics and there's one more
01:38 - show where adate will cover the
01:39 - comparison in between azure aws and gcp
01:43 - and what are the needs of cloud
01:44 - computing
01:45 - he'll also discuss networking coding
01:48 - devops and the certification for aws
01:52 - so the people this is definitely for the
01:54 - people who are enthusiastic to learn
01:56 - about cloud computing and how the
01:58 - infrastructure of cloud computing works
02:00 - the detail of the show and the badge you
02:02 - will find in the link that i'll put in
02:04 - in the description box of this video and
02:06 - don't forget to use my code jkl10 to get
02:08 - 10 extra discount on your paid
02:10 - subscription
02:11 - so now let's discuss this question this
02:13 - was gate question one mark question
02:15 - right and see whenever you see the code
02:18 - don't just first of all look over
02:20 - overall on the code and see like it's
02:22 - very lengthy how you will solve this no
02:24 - what you need to do you just have to
02:26 - follow the steps and what are the steps
02:28 - when you will execute this thing
02:31 - right first of all where the control
02:32 - will go i hope now everybody know the
02:34 - control will go where to the main
02:36 - function
02:37 - right and one by one just draw what is
02:41 - what is you know what is happening in
02:43 - this program see next line is in i j it
02:45 - means you are declaring two variable i
02:47 - and j it means
02:48 - first of all when
02:50 - it is going to execute some uh two main
02:53 - functions and memory would be located
02:54 - and here we have declared two variable
02:57 - i and j so see if you are a beginner
03:00 - then better to draw something like this
03:02 - step by step what is happening better to
03:04 - draw that thing on your paper on your
03:06 - copy right
03:07 - after that you have if you have
03:08 - practiced many programs then in your
03:10 - mind only in your brain only no need to
03:12 - draw on your paper in your mind only you
03:14 - just imagine this thing and you can
03:15 - solve the question
03:16 - but first better to draw something like
03:18 - this so two variables you have i and j
03:20 - we haven't initialized the variable so
03:22 - some garbage value will be there now
03:23 - next line is for loop now i is equal to
03:25 - zero so in i we have zero condition true
03:28 - zero less than four yes condition true
03:30 - it means control will go here
03:32 - so in for loop we have only one
03:33 - statement that is why we haven't written
03:35 - like that they haven't written those
03:38 - curly braces because
03:40 - in for loop they're just given they have
03:42 - just given one statement now j is equal
03:44 - to this this is what i hope now you are
03:46 - clear this is what function calling
03:48 - right so now now where control will go
03:52 - the definition part of the function here
03:53 - we have the definition part right and
03:56 - once control will go to the definition
03:57 - part means some memory would be
03:59 - allocated to this function also
04:01 - right so now what you are passing here i
04:05 - as an argument now i value is 0 so you
04:07 - are passing 0
04:09 - so this 0 will be received this i by
04:11 - this i so here also we have what one
04:14 - variable i
04:15 - and here also we have zero now enter
04:18 - here now see static in count
04:21 - if i have written in count zero it means
04:24 - you have declared one more variable
04:25 - count and initialized it to it with 0
04:29 - but now they have given one more word
04:31 - that is static what does the static mean
04:35 - static means the lifetime of this
04:37 - variable would be throughout the program
04:39 - and
04:40 - the static variable would be initialized
04:42 - only once
04:45 - whenever you call this function again
04:46 - and again this function will hold sorry
04:49 - this this variable count will hold its
04:52 - previous value
04:53 - you cannot re-initialize the static
04:55 - variable again and again whatever i am
04:57 - saying that you will come to know when
05:00 - we discuss the complete process of this
05:02 - program see
05:04 - now in count also we have 0 count is
05:06 - equal to count plus i count plus i 0
05:08 - plus 0 is zero and that will be stored
05:10 - in count that is zero only now return
05:11 - count it will return zero where the
05:13 - control will go here now here because
05:16 - here you are calling this function so
05:17 - now that zero would be stored in this
05:20 - j
05:20 - right so now in this j we have zero and
05:23 - once control will go out of this
05:25 - function it means what i have told you
05:28 - whatever the variables in this function
05:30 - that has been vanished here we have i
05:32 - and count
05:34 - so this is normal variable so the memory
05:36 - would be freed there is no eye now but
05:38 - count is static variable now see the
05:40 - difference
05:42 - it will hold its value it's not going to
05:46 - destroy it
05:47 - right it will hold zero only
05:49 - right
05:50 - that is why i told you the lifetime of
05:52 - static variables are throughout the
05:54 - program
05:56 - right
05:57 - now see count is still 0
05:59 - now i plus plus
06:02 - i this the size in this main so this i
06:05 - would become 1
06:06 - 1 less than equal to 4 yes condition 2
06:08 - again enter here again
06:10 - call the function again control will go
06:12 - here now again i would be declared here
06:15 - now i will receive what
06:17 - now i value is this time 1 so 1 would be
06:19 - passed so in the side we have 1
06:21 - in count is equal to 0
06:24 - but
06:25 - here previous value is also 0 so we are
06:28 - not going to initialize it
06:30 - right it will hold its previous value
06:32 - only right count plus i one plus zero
06:34 - one that would be stored in count that
06:36 - is one it will return count one it will
06:38 - return
06:39 - so now in j we have one
06:42 - right
06:43 - and once control will go out this
06:45 - variable
06:46 - this memory has been freed but count
06:48 - will still hold its previous value right
06:51 - now
06:52 - i plus plus i becomes 2 condition true
06:54 - again enter here again we are going to
06:56 - call the function and again one variable
06:58 - is i and this i now this time will
07:00 - receive
07:01 - 2
07:02 - but count is not going to initialize
07:04 - again by 0 it will hold its previous
07:05 - value because it's static so 2 plus 3 is
07:08 - 2 plus 1 is 3 3 would be in count now 3
07:11 - it will return 3 now in j we have
07:14 - 3. again i plus plus
07:19 - now i becomes 3
07:22 - condition true again enter again we are
07:23 - going to call this one now i this time
07:27 - this will pass 3 as an argument because
07:29 - i value is 3 so it will receive 3
07:31 - now
07:32 - count plus i 3 plus 3 is 6 so now in
07:35 - count we have 6 it will return
07:37 - 6 now and j at this time we have 6
07:40 - i plus plus i becomes 4 4 less than
07:43 - equal to 4 condition true again enter
07:44 - again we are going to call this function
07:46 - and this time this i will receive 4
07:49 - count plus i 6 plus 4 is 10 now in count
07:52 - we have 10
07:53 - return 10
07:55 - now 10 would be stored in j
07:58 - i plus plus
07:59 - five five less than equal to four no
08:02 - now exit from the for loop
08:06 - and after exiting we just have closing
08:08 - braces right after returning the size no
08:11 - more now
08:12 - right but once exit from the loop exit
08:15 - from the loop means we don't have any
08:17 - statement means the closing braces of
08:19 - main exit from the program and now this
08:21 - count would be vanished and this also
08:23 - vanished
08:25 - but now after completing the execution
08:26 - what is the value of j this was the
08:28 - question so j value is
08:30 - 10
08:32 - right
08:33 - so you can print it because we are not
08:35 - printing any j value here we are not
08:37 - using any printf statement so if you
08:39 - want to see that j value is 10 or not
08:42 - after this for loop here you just print
08:44 - j is equal to percentage
08:46 - d and j
08:47 - let me show you practical also i hope
08:48 - you got the working of this also this
08:50 - question so gate question this is simple
08:53 - question but little bit tricky
08:55 - right
08:56 - let's run this question and see what
08:57 - output you are getting
08:59 - so now see this is the code and we are
09:00 - printing the value of j here in the main
09:03 - just to check what is the value of j
09:04 - after executing this code so now let me
09:06 - run this and check what output you will
09:08 - get
09:09 - cj is equal to 10
09:12 - right so i hope you got the working of
09:13 - this code
09:14 - so in the next video you will also see
09:16 - one more previous year gate question on
09:17 - function so i'll see in the next video
09:18 - till then bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning c programming we are discussing previous year gate questions on functions in the last video we have discussed one question and in this video we will discuss this question that came into gate 2000 so this the question was you are given a code and you you are asked like what is the value of j what is value of j after the execution of the score this was the question you have to tell value of j right so now we will discuss this question we will try it in this program and i'll show you on my laptop also practically right but before i just want to tell you one thing if you want to build a great career in software development then you must think about the aspects like what's trending in the industry the questions being asked in the interviews what is the thought

works the detail of the show and the badge you will find in the link that i'll put in in the description box of this video and don't forget to use my code jkl10 to get 10 extra discount on your paid subscription so now let's discuss this question this was gate question one mark question right and see whenever you see the code don't just first of all look over overall on the code and see like it's very lengthy how you will solve this no what you need to do you just have to follow the steps and what are the steps when you will execute this thing right first of all where the control will go i hope now everybody know the control will go where to the main function right and one by one just draw what is what is you know what is happening in this program see next line is in i j it means you

then in your mind only in your brain only no need to draw on your paper in your mind only you just imagine this thing and you can solve the question but first better to draw something like this so two variables you have i and j we haven't initialized the variable so some garbage value will be there now next line is for loop now i is equal to zero so in i we have zero condition true zero less than four yes condition true it means control will go here so in for loop we have only one statement that is why we haven't written like that they haven't written those curly braces because in for loop they're just given they have just given one statement now j is equal to this this is what i hope now you are clear this is what function calling right so now now where control will go the definition part of the function here we have the definition part right and once control will go to the definition part means some memory would be allocated to this function also right so now what you are passing here i as an argument now i value is 0 so you are passing 0 so this 0 will be received this i by this i so here also we have what one variable i and here also we have zero now enter here now see static in count if i have written in count zero it means you have declared one more variable count and initialized it to it with 0 but now they have given one more word that is static what does the static mean static means the lifetime of this variable would be throughout the program and the static variable would be initialized only once whenever you call this function again and again this function will hold sorry this this variable count will hold its previous value you cannot reinitialize the static variable again and again whatever i am saying that you will come to know when we discuss the complete process of this program see now in count also we have 0 count is equal to count plus i count plus i 0 plus 0 is zero and that will be stored in count that is zero only now return count it will return zero where the control will go here now here because here you are calling this function so now that zero would be stored in this j right so now in this j we have zero and once control will go out of this function it means what i have told you whatever the variables in this function that has been vanished here we have i and count so this is normal variable so the memory would be freed there is no eye now but count is static variable now see the difference it will hold its value it's not going to destroy it right it will hold zero only right that is why i told you the lifetime of static variables are throughout the program right now see count is still 0 now i plus plus i this the size in this main so this i would become 1 1 less than equal to 4 yes condition 2 again enter here again call the function again control will go here now again i would be declared here now i will receive what now i value is this time 1 so 1 would be passed so in the side we have 1 in count is equal to 0 but here previous value is also 0 so we are not going to initialize it right it will hold its previous value only right count plus i one plus zero one that would be stored in count that is one it will return count one it will return so now in j we have one right and once control will go out this variable this memory has been freed but count will still hold its previous value right now i plus plus i becomes 2 condition true again enter here again we are going to call the function and again one variable is i and this i now this time will receive 2 but count is not going to initialize again by 0 it will hold its previous value because it's static so 2 plus 3 is 2 plus 1 is 3 3 would be in count now 3 it will return 3 now in j we have 3. again i plus plus now i becomes 3 condition true again enter again we are going to call this one now i this time this will pass 3 as an argument because i value is 3 so it will receive 3 now count plus i 3 plus 3 is 6 so now in count we have 6 it will return 6 now and j at this time we have 6 i plus plus i becomes 4 4 less than equal to 4 condition true again enter again we are going to call this function and this time this i will receive 4 count plus i 6 plus 4 is 10 now in count we have 10 return 10 now 10 would be stored in j i plus plus five five less than equal to four no now exit from the for loop and after exiting we just have closing braces right after returning the size no more now right but once exit from the loop exit from the loop means we don't have any statement means the closing braces of main exit from the program and now this count would be vanished and this also vanished but now after completing the execution what is the value of j this was the question so j value is 10 right so you can print it because we are not printing any j value here we are not using any printf statement so if you want to see that j value is 10 or not after this for loop here you just print j is equal to percentage d and j let me show you practical also i hope you got the working of this also this question so gate question this is simple question but little bit tricky right let's run this question and see what output you are getting so now see this is the code and we are printing the value of j here in the main just to check what is the value of j after executing this code so now let me run this and check what output you will get cj is equal to 10 right so i hope you got the working of this code so in the next video you will also see one more previous year gate question on function so i'll see in the next video till then bye take care
