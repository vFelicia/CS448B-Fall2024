00:00 - so in a series of learning Python
00:02 - programming language in the previous
00:02 - video we have seen randomization random
00:04 - module their function and based on that
00:06 - we have done one coding exercise heads
00:08 - or tails means you have written a
00:10 - virtual coin dose programming right it
00:12 - will generate a random number either 0
00:14 - or 1 and based on that you will tell it
00:15 - it's heads or things that was simple one
00:17 - but in this video we'll discuss one more
00:20 - coding exercise that is little bit
00:21 - complicated but if you have you know
00:24 - idea of that randomization all the
00:26 - random functions and all properly then
00:28 - you can easily you can easily solve this
00:30 - uh problem right now what is this
00:32 - problem statement
00:34 - see suppose four or five five friends
00:38 - are sitting in a restaurant
00:40 - now who will pay the bill so for that
00:42 - for that they'll use a technique what is
00:45 - that technique everybody will give their
00:48 - credit card or debit card or business
00:49 - card
00:50 - in a bowl or maybe in someone's hand
00:53 - right
00:55 - and the waiter or anybody from you guys
00:58 - will pick one card without seeing the
01:01 - cards right we'll pick one card
01:03 - and
01:05 - that person is going to pay the bill the
01:07 - person selected
01:09 - will pay the bill for everybody's you
01:12 - know food right that is one technique I
01:16 - have seen this thing in uh one of the
01:18 - Instagram reel also
01:20 - so this idea we are going to implement
01:23 - right so that is the thing but the idea
01:27 - is now
01:29 - how you will take input from the user
01:31 - using input function
01:32 - you will take names
01:34 - what I want is this kind of output let
01:37 - me just show you so the output should be
01:40 - something like this it will ask like
01:42 - enter everybody's name separated by
01:44 - command suppose I am entering like Jenny
01:46 - comma
01:47 - supposedly
01:50 - [Music]
01:55 - so let me just enter and it's print any
01:58 - name like it between any name like grtr
02:01 - will pay the bill something like this
02:03 - right or rather than this directly
02:06 - printing this what we can do
02:11 - like this we will enter the name then it
02:13 - will print the list so it will separate
02:15 - these into
02:18 - with different different items and it
02:20 - will create a list something like this
02:21 - and then it will pick anyone from this
02:23 - list like this time Gia will pay the
02:25 - bill so this type of account I want so I
02:28 - hope you got what kind of output we want
02:30 - so what hint let me just give you some
02:32 - in first of all there are multiple ways
02:35 - so we'll discuss two ways here you can
02:37 - use this Choice method
02:40 - from a list it will pick a random item
02:43 - so maybe you have a list of names just
02:45 - use this Choice method and it will pick
02:46 - a name and that's it it will be two line
02:49 - of code but this is very simple we will
02:51 - not use this Choice method without
02:53 - Choice method you have to write down
02:55 - this program
02:57 - right without Choice maybe you can use
03:00 - Rand enter and range or random function
03:02 - any function
03:03 - right
03:04 - now see when whenever you will enter we
03:07 - will enter using input function
03:10 - uh you know names multiple names
03:13 - so there is one function let me just
03:14 - give you one hint split
03:19 - what does function perform this suppose
03:22 - I have this text suppose I have this
03:24 - text so welcome to Jenny's lectures I
03:27 - want to split this complete string this
03:29 - is complete string and I want to split
03:31 - this and make a list right so how to use
03:36 - this method this the name of this
03:39 - complete string text Dot
03:41 - split and in bracket you will just
03:45 - provide the operator or the thing at
03:47 - which you want to split this string
03:49 - suppose I want to split this
03:53 - whenever a space it's just a space
03:55 - whenever space will find this you know
03:58 - the split function will split this
04:00 - string and after that it will store this
04:02 - into a you can say a text underscore
04:07 - splitted
04:09 - this variable and I'll just print
04:11 - this text underscore
04:15 - split it
04:16 - so what output you will get
04:19 - split function will split based on this
04:20 - operator space so output would be a list
04:24 - welcome okay space so
04:27 - welcome then it will split then T O2
04:31 - then against
04:33 - space split
04:35 - then
04:37 - something like this now these are
04:39 - individual items in this list this is a
04:42 - list and these will come as an item to
04:44 - Jenny's lectures these are individual
04:46 - items and you can access these items now
04:48 - with help of index so this is at zero
04:52 - index then one then two then three
04:55 - how to access that I guess you know just
04:58 - name of this list
05:00 - support name of this list is text
05:02 - splitted in this square brackets just
05:05 - put the index like 0 then it will print
05:07 - welcome
05:08 - so this is one hint you have to use
05:10 - split right
05:12 - and another hint I have just told you in
05:14 - this only using this index you can
05:16 - access this so maybe you can generate
05:19 - rather than this you can obviously we
05:21 - know we can generate any random integer
05:23 - number 0 1 2 3 in a Range
05:26 - we have a function random so you can use
05:28 - that thing you can
05:30 - generate any random number and based on
05:32 - that random number you can map this
05:34 - random number to this like two and like
05:38 - at this place we have Jenny the name
05:40 - Jenny
05:41 - then simply you can print Jenny will pay
05:43 - the bill
05:44 - this kind of thing right so pause the
05:46 - video and try this out
05:48 - so I hope you have done this exercise
05:49 - see this is how split function will work
05:52 - suppose in text we are welcome to
05:53 - Jenny's lectures and
05:55 - text Dot split but the operator I want
05:58 - to use is e
06:00 - or the alphabet I want to use is e
06:03 - whenever e it will find it will split
06:06 - that string from that point right now
06:10 - let me show you the output see this
06:11 - would be the output because after w we
06:14 - have e so w would be different item then
06:17 - lcom this would be different item
06:20 - because again we have e right then 2
06:24 - then after J we have e so t o space j
06:28 - would be one item and it would be
06:30 - splitted from here then n n y l like
06:33 - this I hope you got this this how split
06:35 - function will work right now let's
06:37 - create a new file and this would be what
06:40 - coding exercise
06:42 - 12.
06:49 - so obviously we will do what
06:51 - randomization so first of all we will
06:53 - import random module right now
06:57 - suppose we are taking what names using
07:01 - input function obviously we'll take
07:03 - okay so I am asking like enter
07:06 - everybody's name separated by comma
07:08 - right because I want to use comma as a
07:12 - split operator right
07:15 - so just I want to split this names Dot
07:19 - split
07:20 - function and then in bracket
07:23 - comma this operator whenever
07:26 - the split function will find this
07:28 - operator it will split the string from
07:30 - there and make a list so we will store
07:33 - this obviously in a list so suppose
07:36 - names underscore list
07:39 - this is the variable I am taking
07:41 - right
07:43 - if you want to check out you can just
07:45 - print like it's working or not rather
07:47 - than writing the complete code at first
07:49 - so I'm just printing like names list
07:53 - right let's run this
07:57 - okay this is current good
08:00 - enter everybody's name separated by
08:02 - comma so suppose I am entering like
08:05 - Jenny comma then I'm entering
08:09 - Akash then comma
08:12 - then I'm in entering like ankur
08:15 - and that's it and enter see
08:18 - now it is a list Jenny is one item then
08:21 - Akash then separated by
08:24 - whenever it will get it will get this
08:26 - comma it will separate from there
08:28 - now we can we can access this list the
08:31 - items of the list using index
08:33 - so I guess now it's clear to you how to
08:36 - write down this code right so I'm not
08:38 - going to print here
08:40 - fine
08:41 - now split it now what we can do this
08:44 - journey is having index 0 Akash is
08:46 - having one anchor is having two so we
08:48 - can generate a random number
08:51 - within the range 0 to 2
08:55 - 0 is the index and 2.
08:58 - right and after that according to that
09:00 - index we can
09:01 - get the name
09:03 - right
09:05 - so which is the function Rand int
09:09 - and here you can pass the range
09:12 - 0 to
09:13 - obviously I cannot write down here 0 to
09:15 - like
09:17 - I don't know like like next time I'll
09:20 - put five names
09:22 - so obviously this would not be at static
09:25 - time at this time I don't know the
09:27 - length of this list so you have to
09:29 - calculate length of the list
09:31 - this is also important so here you can
09:34 - provide
09:35 - that ending point right
09:38 - so how you can
09:41 - using Len function we have a len
09:43 - function length
09:44 - and the list is now what
09:47 - this variable
09:49 - sorry
09:53 - length and here just pass
09:56 - names list so it will find out the
09:58 - length of the list now length of this
10:00 - list is
10:02 - one two three okay so it will give you
10:04 - three so let us just
10:08 - store that thing into a variable suppose
10:10 - I am taking
10:11 - length
10:13 - okay
10:14 - but so here what will you will pass
10:18 - length no because Rand n12
10:22 - return an integer between 0 to length in
10:26 - this case suppose we are taking this
10:27 - list in this case length is 3 so 0 to 3
10:30 - including 3 also
10:32 - and whenever it will return three
10:33 - suppose so at third index we don't have
10:37 - anything
10:38 - right
10:39 - so what name it will ping it will pick
10:42 - nothing
10:44 - so what you will pass Here length minus
10:46 - 1 till length minus 1 because the index
10:49 - is 0 1 2 length is 3 so 3 minus 2 sorry
10:55 - 3 minus 1 that is 2 till 2 so 0 to 2
10:58 - including both 0 and 2 yeah that is fine
11:00 - now I hope you go to Y I am putting the
11:02 - range 0 to length minus 1 right
11:06 - now
11:07 - okay
11:08 - so it will generate any
11:11 - random integer number between 0 to
11:13 - whatever the length of the string minus
11:15 - 1. so that I am going to suppose uh
11:19 - store in a
11:20 - variable
11:22 - random
11:24 - choice
11:27 - in this variable
11:29 - right
11:30 - now suppose it has picked
11:33 - 0 to now suppose list is this 0 to 2 so
11:37 - it has to randomly 1. so in random
11:40 - choice we have now one
11:42 - so obviously we can at one we have Akash
11:45 - so we can access hakash
11:47 - we know how to access how to access just
11:51 - name of the list
11:52 - names underscore list that this variable
11:55 - is this names underscore list and in
11:57 - square bracket just pass one note one
12:00 - but obviously we are passing this
12:03 - variable random choice
12:06 - right and we can simply print this
12:09 - in print we can
12:12 - do this
12:13 - this thing right and if you properly
12:16 - want to
12:17 - write down like Akash will pay the bill
12:20 - so okay we can do that thing also in
12:23 - print we can use F string f
12:27 - and from here
12:31 - from here we can just access this this
12:35 - will
12:38 - pay the bill how to use a string if you
12:40 - don't know you can check out my previous
12:42 - video I'll put in this I button you can
12:44 - check out that video right okay sorry
12:47 - now from this variable it will pick so
12:50 - this will pay the bill right
12:53 - now I hope you got this this is that's
12:55 - it now
12:57 - okay let's run this and see you're
12:59 - getting the output or not
13:03 - phony
13:05 - let's enter
13:08 - okay sorry we cannot use this Rand in
13:11 - function like this my mistake
13:13 - we have to use random dot Rand hint like
13:16 - this
13:17 - okay
13:19 - I was just checking you are attentive or
13:21 - not
13:23 - okay jokes apart let's run run this
13:25 - again and
13:28 - see this time ankur will pay the bill
13:31 - maybe next time you will get other thing
13:33 - suppose we are
13:37 - see this time I am getting Jenny will
13:39 - pay the bill okay
13:41 - so this is how you can do without using
13:44 - Choice method I hope you go to this
13:48 - thing it's not that much tough right
13:51 - if you are not getting you can just
13:52 - watch the video again right now if you
13:56 - use that choice then no need to just
14:00 - calculate the length you can just
14:02 - comment out these two lines
14:05 - we have the list now now we can directly
14:08 - use like random Dot
14:11 - choice and this here just pass the list
14:15 - names list
14:17 - and whatever it will return suppose that
14:20 - name I am storing in the
14:23 - name person
14:26 - selected right
14:29 - so rather than this now at this time I
14:32 - am using what here
14:34 - person selected
14:36 - right
14:45 - say this time also
14:47 - okay not Jenny's it's Jenny
14:51 - but anyway we can write down Jenny also
14:53 - Jenny will pay the bill so simply using
14:57 - choice you have to write down just one
14:59 - line
15:00 - random load Choice the list it will pick
15:02 - the name the name suppose I am going to
15:05 - put in this variable person selected and
15:07 - from this variable we can just
15:09 - in F string we can pass this variable
15:11 - name all right
15:13 - or rather than this we can just do this
15:16 - thing in one line only
15:17 - F string from here
15:19 - here only we can write down this thing
15:21 - dynamodore Choice names list directly
15:24 - right
15:28 - say this time it is giving Akash will
15:31 - pay the bill right so I hope this is
15:34 - clear to you now the random module
15:36 - random function how to use them how to
15:38 - solve a problem using random functions
15:40 - at all right so now in the next video
15:42 - we'll see nested list so now we'll see
15:44 - the next video till then bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

so in a series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen randomization random module their function and based on that we have done one coding exercise heads or tails means you have written a virtual coin dose programming right it will generate a random number either 0 or 1 and based on that you will tell it it's heads or things that was simple one but in this video we'll discuss one more coding exercise that is little bit complicated but if you have you know idea of that randomization all the random functions and all properly then you can easily you can easily solve this uh problem right now what is this problem statement see suppose four or five five friends are sitting in a restaurant now who will pay the bill so for that for that they'll use a technique what is that technique everybody will give their credit card or debit card or business card in a bowl or maybe in someone's hand right and the waiter or anybody from you guys will pick one card without seeing the cards right we'll pick one card and that person is going to pay the bill the person selected will pay the bill for everybody's you know food right that is one technique I have seen this thing in uh one of the Instagram reel also so this idea we are going to implement right so that is the thing but the idea is now how you will take input from the user using input function you will take names what I want is this kind of output let me just show you so the output should be something like this it will ask like enter everybody's name separated by command suppose I am entering like Jenny comma supposedly so let me just enter and it's print any name like it between any name like grtr will pay the bill something like this right or rather than this directly printing this what we can do like this we will enter the name then it will print the list so it will separate these into with different different items and it will create a list something like this and then it will pick anyone from this list like this time Gia will pay the bill so this type of account I want so I hope you got what kind of output we want so what hint let me just give you some in first of all there are multiple ways so we'll discuss two ways here you can use this Choice method from a list it will pick a random item so maybe you have a list of names just use this Choice method and it will pick a name and that's it it will be two line of code but this is very simple we will not use this Choice method without Choice method you have to write down this program right without Choice maybe you can use Rand enter and range or random function any function right now see when whenever you will enter we will enter using input function uh you know names multiple names so there is one function let me just give you one hint split what does function perform this suppose I have this text suppose I have this text so welcome to Jenny's lectures I want to split this complete string this is complete string and I want to split this and make a list right so how to use this method this the name of this complete string text Dot split and in bracket you will just provide the operator or the thing at which you want to split this string suppose I want to split this whenever a space it's just a space whenever space will find this you know the split function will split this string and after that it will store this into a you can say a text underscore splitted this variable and I'll just print this text underscore split it so what output you will get split function will split based on this operator space so output would be a list welcome okay space so welcome then it will split then T O2 then against space split then something like this now these are individual items in this list this is a list and these will come as an item to Jenny's lectures these are individual items and you can access these items now with help of index so this is at zero index then one then two then three how to access that I guess you know just name of this list support name of this list is text splitted in this square brackets just put the index like 0 then it will print welcome so this is one hint you have to use split right and another hint I have just told you in this only using this index you can access this so maybe you can generate rather than this you can obviously we know we can generate any random integer number 0 1 2 3 in a Range we have a function random so you can use that thing you can generate any random number and based on that random number you can map this random number to this like two and like at this place we have Jenny the name Jenny then simply you can print Jenny will pay the bill this kind of thing right so pause the video and try this out so I hope you have done this exercise see this is how split function will work suppose in text we are welcome to Jenny's lectures and text Dot split but the operator I want to use is e or the alphabet I want to use is e whenever e it will find it will split that string from that point right now let me show you the output see this would be the output because after w we have e so w would be different item then lcom this would be different item because again we have e right then 2 then after J we have e so t o space j would be one item and it would be splitted from here then n n y l like this I hope you got this this how split function will work right now let's create a new file and this would be what coding exercise 12. so obviously we will do what randomization so first of all we will import random module right now suppose we are taking what names using input function obviously we'll take okay so I am asking like enter everybody's name separated by comma right because I want to use comma as a split operator right so just I want to split this names Dot split function and then in bracket comma this operator whenever the split function will find this operator it will split the string from there and make a list so we will store this obviously in a list so suppose names underscore list this is the variable I am taking right if you want to check out you can just print like it's working or not rather than writing the complete code at first so I'm just printing like names list right let's run this okay this is current good enter everybody's name separated by comma so suppose I am entering like Jenny comma then I'm entering Akash then comma then I'm in entering like ankur and that's it and enter see now it is a list Jenny is one item then Akash then separated by whenever it will get it will get this comma it will separate from there now we can we can access this list the items of the list using index so I guess now it's clear to you how to write down this code right so I'm not going to print here fine now split it now what we can do this journey is having index 0 Akash is having one anchor is having two so we can generate a random number within the range 0 to 2 0 is the index and 2. right and after that according to that index we can get the name right so which is the function Rand int and here you can pass the range 0 to obviously I cannot write down here 0 to like I don't know like like next time I'll put five names so obviously this would not be at static time at this time I don't know the length of this list so you have to calculate length of the list this is also important so here you can provide that ending point right so how you can using Len function we have a len function length and the list is now what this variable sorry length and here just pass names list so it will find out the length of the list now length of this list is one two three okay so it will give you three so let us just store that thing into a variable suppose I am taking length okay but so here what will you will pass length no because Rand n12 return an integer between 0 to length in this case suppose we are taking this list in this case length is 3 so 0 to 3 including 3 also and whenever it will return three suppose so at third index we don't have anything right so what name it will ping it will pick nothing so what you will pass Here length minus 1 till length minus 1 because the index is 0 1 2 length is 3 so 3 minus 2 sorry 3 minus 1 that is 2 till 2 so 0 to 2 including both 0 and 2 yeah that is fine now I hope you go to Y I am putting the range 0 to length minus 1 right now okay so it will generate any random integer number between 0 to whatever the length of the string minus 1. so that I am going to suppose uh store in a variable random choice in this variable right now suppose it has picked 0 to now suppose list is this 0 to 2 so it has to randomly 1. so in random choice we have now one so obviously we can at one we have Akash so we can access hakash we know how to access how to access just name of the list names underscore list that this variable is this names underscore list and in square bracket just pass one note one but obviously we are passing this variable random choice right and we can simply print this in print we can do this this thing right and if you properly want to write down like Akash will pay the bill so okay we can do that thing also in print we can use F string f and from here from here we can just access this this will pay the bill how to use a string if you don't know you can check out my previous video I'll put in this I button you can check out that video right okay sorry now from this variable it will pick so this will pay the bill right now I hope you got this this is that's it now okay let's run this and see you're getting the output or not phony let's enter okay sorry we cannot use this Rand in function like this my mistake we have to use random dot Rand hint like this okay I was just checking you are attentive or not okay jokes apart let's run run this again and see this time ankur will pay the bill maybe next time you will get other thing suppose we are see this time I am getting Jenny will pay the bill okay so this is how you can do without using Choice method I hope you go to this thing it's not that much tough right if you are not getting you can just watch the video again right now if you use that choice then no need to just calculate the length you can just comment out these two lines we have the list now now we can directly use like random Dot choice and this here just pass the list names list and whatever it will return suppose that name I am storing in the name person selected right so rather than this now at this time I am using what here person selected right say this time also okay not Jenny's it's Jenny but anyway we can write down Jenny also Jenny will pay the bill so simply using choice you have to write down just one line random load Choice the list it will pick the name the name suppose I am going to put in this variable person selected and from this variable we can just in F string we can pass this variable name all right or rather than this we can just do this thing in one line only F string from here here only we can write down this thing dynamodore Choice names list directly right say this time it is giving Akash will pay the bill right so I hope this is clear to you now the random module random function how to use them how to solve a problem using random functions at all right so now in the next video we'll see nested list so now we'll see the next video till then bye take care
