00:00 - and available resources are M now you
00:03 - have to find out this value of M and the
00:07 - question is what is the minimum value of
00:09 - M see here the focus is on minimum value
00:13 - minimum value of M such that system is
00:15 - deadlock free and some extra I think is
00:19 - also given that any process can request
00:21 - for any number of resources obviously
00:23 - that the request would be less than or
00:25 - equal to its maximum so its maximum
00:29 - requirement it cannot exceed to its
00:31 - maximum requirement fine now before
00:34 - going to this question I am going to
00:36 - discuss with you one small question I
00:38 - suppose see in my class I have five
00:41 - students fine and all the five students
00:44 - needs suppose maximum three pins here
00:49 - the condition is same type of resources
00:52 - are there the resource type should be
00:54 - see fine it's not like that one is blue
00:58 - one is black and one is green pen so
01:00 - here also the condition is the source
01:03 - type is same okay the rule is what the
01:07 - faculty has to buy the pence and gave
01:10 - the pens to student in the class now you
01:13 - I have to decide how many how many pens
01:17 - should I buy so that I can fulfill their
01:19 - requirements now simple answer is you
01:23 - just buy 15 pins because five students
01:26 - are there all its three maximum
01:28 - requirement is three so just buy 15 pens
01:30 - and you can fulfill the requirement but
01:33 - see here the focus is one you have to
01:35 - find out the minimum amount minimum
01:37 - amount of pens maybe III buy 20 pence
01:42 - and that is also fine in the system is
01:44 - not in deadlock state if I have 50 pence
01:46 - that is great I am able to fulfill all
01:49 - the requirements but I have to find out
01:50 - the minimum amount of pen fine
01:53 - see now this is the maximum requirement
01:57 - now suppose each student each student
02:01 - has requested has requested me for two
02:05 - two pins so a location is worth now two
02:11 - pens two pens and I have given two two
02:13 - pen
02:13 - to these students suppose I bought 10
02:17 - pens
02:18 - so here we have available s 10 pins okay
02:26 - just for example now every student has
02:30 - requested me for - two - two pins now I
02:34 - have given two two pens now I do I do
02:36 - not have any pin because I have given 10
02:39 - pens to all the students and I have now
02:41 - zero pens now need of these to rent is
02:45 - what 1 1 1 1 and 1 each student need one
02:50 - one more pin because maximum requirement
02:52 - is 3 3 pens now if suppose ROM asked me
02:57 - for one pin then I am NOT able to
02:58 - fulfill that requirement I am NOT able
02:59 - to fulfil requirement of any student now
03:02 - system is in deadlocked State see no
03:05 - student at starting only no student can
03:07 - ask me for 3 pens let us suppose in
03:10 - starting only rather than 2 pens ROM
03:12 - asked me for 3 pins
03:14 - so here the assumption is what as soon
03:17 - as the process get all its required
03:20 - resources it will release it has to
03:22 - release its resources after some amount
03:24 - of time so as soon as it it you know ask
03:28 - me for 3 pens
03:29 - I give him 3 pens and I'll take back all
03:33 - the 3 pens that is the assumption that
03:35 - is to be followed we have discussed to
03:38 - this case in previous examples
03:40 - so if ROM asked me for 3 pens then
03:42 - obviously from 10 pins I can give three
03:44 - pins at starting handed I just take 3
03:47 - pens back and drop got completed then
03:50 - again Sharman like this fine
03:52 - so so here the the worst scenario is
03:55 - what every student will ask its maximum
03:59 - minus 1 pens 2 2 2 2 & 2 now I have only
04:04 - 3 pens now I have 0 I cannot fulfill any
04:06 - requirement now suppose ROM is asking me
04:09 - for 1 X trap and I am NOT able to
04:10 - fulfill that requirement now suppose I
04:13 - bought 10 plus 1 means 11 pens suppose I
04:19 - have fine now the remaining is I have 1
04:26 - pen now now I can fulfill requirement of
04:30 - need of all the students suppose Ram is
04:34 - asking for one extra pen
04:36 - I just give one extra pen as soon as Ram
04:38 - got Rumble get three pens it he has to
04:42 - release all its spin then I can take
04:44 - three back or you can say now now I have
04:48 - you can say one plus two is now three
04:50 - and RAM got completed now sham is asking
04:54 - for one extra pen I can human I can
04:56 - fulfill that Department with three pens
04:57 - now action as soon as Ram will go
05:00 - through and I just take back all the
05:01 - three pens now available is worth three
05:04 - plus two is fine like this I can fulfill
05:06 - all the requirements fine
05:09 - so the minimum value is what 11 and how
05:13 - how we will calculate the minimum value
05:15 - just look at the maximum requirement do
05:20 - minus 1 minus 1 minus 1 minus 1 minus 1
05:23 - and just do the total of this one see
05:26 - this one is 10 then in this total just
05:30 - add one resource and that is the minimum
05:34 - value now discuss this case with this
05:38 - example this general scenario now here
05:42 - see maximum requirement is this one you
05:45 - have to find out value em see this
05:47 - available available I have 11 so this
05:49 - available should be either greater than
05:53 - or equal to this total if suppose I put
05:59 - 12 pins then also fine if I bought 15
06:03 - pens then also fine but minimum is what
06:05 - this total plus 1 so this available
06:08 - should be either greater than or equal
06:10 - to this value
06:12 - so see here M should be greater than
06:16 - equal to see maximum is a 1 a 2 up to n
06:20 - from all the values from 4 P when it's a
06:24 - 1 so we do a 1-1 fine plus a 2 maximum
06:32 - minus 1 plus HB minus 1 like this
06:36 - up to what up to a n minus-1 fine
06:43 - now now plus one like this plus one so
06:51 - this is the case now find out M should
06:54 - be greater than equal to now C over a 1
06:57 - plus a 2 up to a n fine now how you can
07:03 - write summation of a of I and I should
07:07 - be from 1 to n ok now next is minus C
07:14 - this minus 1 minus 1 minus 1 how many
07:17 - times minus 1 is there n times right
07:20 - because see a 1 a 2 up to a n and minus
07:24 - 1 is with each a so this minus 1 is how
07:27 - many times n times so you can write here
07:29 - minus N and plus plus 1 fine so this is
07:39 - the formula have to calculate minimum
07:41 - amount of minimum value of M such that
07:44 - no deadlock will be there so that value
07:46 - would be greater than equal to this way
07:49 - now let us discuss one question with the
07:52 - help of this formula so now let us take
07:55 - one equation is given five processes are
07:57 - given maximum requirement of these
07:59 - processes are given and you have to find
08:01 - the minimum value of M or you can say
08:03 - available resources so that the system
08:05 - is deadlock free and any process can
08:09 - request any number of resources at any
08:12 - time obviously the request should be
08:14 - less than or equal to this maximum need
08:17 - of that process maximum claim of that
08:19 - process right now how to calculate by
08:22 - applying this formula see this M should
08:25 - be greater than equal to the summation
08:27 - of ao5 summation of I is equal to 1 to N
08:32 - n is what number of processes 1 to 5
08:37 - here what will write you I - n is what -
08:42 - n n is about 5 plus 1 now M is greater
08:48 - than equal
08:49 - if you know the total of this one CI is
08:51 - equal to one to five means total of this
08:53 - maximum because a or Y is what this one
08:56 - now if you know the total of this one
08:59 - this would be twenty seven so this is 27
09:02 - minus five plus 1 and M should be
09:05 - greater than equal to 27 plus 128 28
09:08 - minus 5 is 3 so the minimum value of M
09:12 - is 123 you can calculate without this
09:16 - formula also you just do 5 minus 1 is 4
09:20 - 6-4 6-1 is 5 3 minus 1 is 2 7 minus 1 is
09:25 - 6 6 minus 1 is what 5 just do the total
09:29 - of these 1 and this total would be 22
09:35 - and just add 1 to this and this would
09:39 - also be 23 so this is how you can solve
09:43 - this kind of numerical let us take one
09:45 - more example so let us take this
09:46 - question also like there are five
09:49 - processes each process demands three
09:51 - resources of same type see here the
09:54 - condition is these type of in this type
09:56 - of question conditioning resources
09:58 - should be of same type
09:59 - so what is the minimum number of
10:01 - resources and system for deadlock free
10:03 - condition fine see the formula is this
10:07 - one M is like greater than equal to this
10:09 - business fine you have to find out value
10:11 - of M should be greater than equal to
10:14 - summation of I is equal to 1 2 and n is
10:19 - number of processes number of processes
10:21 - are five processes 5 here high minus 5
10:26 - plus 1 so M is greater than equal to now
10:31 - see what is this each process demands
10:34 - three resources this is the maximum
10:37 - demand you can say three demands for
10:40 - same resource type so here this this
10:43 - value is what 3 3 3 3 3 like this fine
10:46 - now if you a 1 is also 3 a 2 is 3 a 3 3
10:52 - a 4 is 3 and a 5 is 3 because we are
10:55 - having I value from 1 to 5 so when you
10:59 - will do total of this 1 then you will
11:00 - find out what 3 into 5 that is
11:02 - 15 minus 5 plus 1 and this should be M
11:06 - greater than equal to 15 plus it should
11:09 - be 11 so the minimum requirement of
11:14 - resources would be 11 so that the system
11:16 - is in deadlock free condition this is
11:19 - how you will solve these kind of vehicle
11:22 - I hope you got the concept so I'll see
11:24 - you in the next video till then bye-bye
11:26 - take care

Cleaned transcript:

and available resources are M now you have to find out this value of M and the question is what is the minimum value of M see here the focus is on minimum value minimum value of M such that system is deadlock free and some extra I think is also given that any process can request for any number of resources obviously that the request would be less than or equal to its maximum so its maximum requirement it cannot exceed to its maximum requirement fine now before going to this question I am going to discuss with you one small question I suppose see in my class I have five students fine and all the five students needs suppose maximum three pins here the condition is same type of resources are there the resource type should be see fine it's not like that one is blue one is black and one is green pen so here also the condition is the source type is same okay the rule is what the faculty has to buy the pence and gave the pens to student in the class now you I have to decide how many how many pens should I buy so that I can fulfill their requirements now simple answer is you just buy 15 pins because five students are there all its three maximum requirement is three so just buy 15 pens and you can fulfill the requirement but see here the focus is one you have to find out the minimum amount minimum amount of pens maybe III buy 20 pence and that is also fine in the system is not in deadlock state if I have 50 pence that is great I am able to fulfill all the requirements but I have to find out the minimum amount of pen fine see now this is the maximum requirement now suppose each student each student has requested has requested me for two two pins so a location is worth now two pens two pens and I have given two two pen to these students suppose I bought 10 pens so here we have available s 10 pins okay just for example now every student has requested me for two two pins now I have given two two pens now I do I do not have any pin because I have given 10 pens to all the students and I have now zero pens now need of these to rent is what 1 1 1 1 and 1 each student need one one more pin because maximum requirement is 3 3 pens now if suppose ROM asked me for one pin then I am NOT able to fulfill that requirement I am NOT able to fulfil requirement of any student now system is in deadlocked State see no student at starting only no student can ask me for 3 pens let us suppose in starting only rather than 2 pens ROM asked me for 3 pins so here the assumption is what as soon as the process get all its required resources it will release it has to release its resources after some amount of time so as soon as it it you know ask me for 3 pens I give him 3 pens and I'll take back all the 3 pens that is the assumption that is to be followed we have discussed to this case in previous examples so if ROM asked me for 3 pens then obviously from 10 pins I can give three pins at starting handed I just take 3 pens back and drop got completed then again Sharman like this fine so so here the the worst scenario is what every student will ask its maximum minus 1 pens 2 2 2 2 & 2 now I have only 3 pens now I have 0 I cannot fulfill any requirement now suppose ROM is asking me for 1 X trap and I am NOT able to fulfill that requirement now suppose I bought 10 plus 1 means 11 pens suppose I have fine now the remaining is I have 1 pen now now I can fulfill requirement of need of all the students suppose Ram is asking for one extra pen I just give one extra pen as soon as Ram got Rumble get three pens it he has to release all its spin then I can take three back or you can say now now I have you can say one plus two is now three and RAM got completed now sham is asking for one extra pen I can human I can fulfill that Department with three pens now action as soon as Ram will go through and I just take back all the three pens now available is worth three plus two is fine like this I can fulfill all the requirements fine so the minimum value is what 11 and how how we will calculate the minimum value just look at the maximum requirement do minus 1 minus 1 minus 1 minus 1 minus 1 and just do the total of this one see this one is 10 then in this total just add one resource and that is the minimum value now discuss this case with this example this general scenario now here see maximum requirement is this one you have to find out value em see this available available I have 11 so this available should be either greater than or equal to this total if suppose I put 12 pins then also fine if I bought 15 pens then also fine but minimum is what this total plus 1 so this available should be either greater than or equal to this value so see here M should be greater than equal to see maximum is a 1 a 2 up to n from all the values from 4 P when it's a 1 so we do a 11 fine plus a 2 maximum minus 1 plus HB minus 1 like this up to what up to a n minus1 fine now now plus one like this plus one so this is the case now find out M should be greater than equal to now C over a 1 plus a 2 up to a n fine now how you can write summation of a of I and I should be from 1 to n ok now next is minus C this minus 1 minus 1 minus 1 how many times minus 1 is there n times right because see a 1 a 2 up to a n and minus 1 is with each a so this minus 1 is how many times n times so you can write here minus N and plus plus 1 fine so this is the formula have to calculate minimum amount of minimum value of M such that no deadlock will be there so that value would be greater than equal to this way now let us discuss one question with the help of this formula so now let us take one equation is given five processes are given maximum requirement of these processes are given and you have to find the minimum value of M or you can say available resources so that the system is deadlock free and any process can request any number of resources at any time obviously the request should be less than or equal to this maximum need of that process maximum claim of that process right now how to calculate by applying this formula see this M should be greater than equal to the summation of ao5 summation of I is equal to 1 to N n is what number of processes 1 to 5 here what will write you I n is what n n is about 5 plus 1 now M is greater than equal if you know the total of this one CI is equal to one to five means total of this maximum because a or Y is what this one now if you know the total of this one this would be twenty seven so this is 27 minus five plus 1 and M should be greater than equal to 27 plus 128 28 minus 5 is 3 so the minimum value of M is 123 you can calculate without this formula also you just do 5 minus 1 is 4 64 61 is 5 3 minus 1 is 2 7 minus 1 is 6 6 minus 1 is what 5 just do the total of these 1 and this total would be 22 and just add 1 to this and this would also be 23 so this is how you can solve this kind of numerical let us take one more example so let us take this question also like there are five processes each process demands three resources of same type see here the condition is these type of in this type of question conditioning resources should be of same type so what is the minimum number of resources and system for deadlock free condition fine see the formula is this one M is like greater than equal to this business fine you have to find out value of M should be greater than equal to summation of I is equal to 1 2 and n is number of processes number of processes are five processes 5 here high minus 5 plus 1 so M is greater than equal to now see what is this each process demands three resources this is the maximum demand you can say three demands for same resource type so here this this value is what 3 3 3 3 3 like this fine now if you a 1 is also 3 a 2 is 3 a 3 3 a 4 is 3 and a 5 is 3 because we are having I value from 1 to 5 so when you will do total of this 1 then you will find out what 3 into 5 that is 15 minus 5 plus 1 and this should be M greater than equal to 15 plus it should be 11 so the minimum requirement of resources would be 11 so that the system is in deadlock free condition this is how you will solve these kind of vehicle I hope you got the concept so I'll see you in the next video till then byebye take care
