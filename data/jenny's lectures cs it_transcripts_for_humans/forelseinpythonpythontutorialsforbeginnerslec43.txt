00:00 - so in the series of learning Python
00:01 - programming language in the previous
00:02 - video we have seen for Loop in Python
00:04 - right so next topic is foreigns Yes you
00:08 - heard it right it's four else not f l
00:11 - you must have heard if else in other
00:13 - programming languages like if you have
00:15 - if you are from CEC plus Java background
00:18 - then if else but not four else and while
00:20 - else right but yeah in Python we have a
00:23 - facility to use else
00:26 - this else keyword with for loop as well
00:29 - as with while loop right now what is
00:32 - this for else in Python the working the
00:35 - syntax why we use this when to use this
00:37 - and all we'll be discussing in this
00:39 - video about Forex with the help of
00:40 - program practically I will show you
00:42 - right but see the working is different
00:45 - from if else maybe you are thinking if
00:47 - else the working Forex would be same as
00:48 - if else and you know the working of
00:50 - vehicles may be right but no no no no
00:52 - the working is totally different
00:54 - see what is f else
00:56 - simply we write like if here we have if
01:00 - block here we have condition right
01:03 - then some statement then we have else
01:06 - and here also we have some statements
01:09 - right so either this or this block would
01:12 - be executed not both either this or this
01:16 - suppose I am taking like a is equal to 1
01:18 - B is equal to a simple example so I'm
01:20 - thinking like if a equal to equal to B
01:23 - right this thing
01:26 - then print
01:28 - a is a and b are same
01:31 - else you will Print Different
01:34 - like and we are different right
01:36 - so the condition C A is 1 B is 2 is this
01:40 - condition true no so control will not go
01:44 - here control will go in else part and it
01:46 - will print different
01:47 - if a is 1 B is 1 in this case a is one B
01:51 - is one both are same condition true so
01:53 - control will enter here it will print A
01:55 - and B are same so control will not enter
01:57 - here
01:58 - so either this flow or this flow could
02:00 - be executed based on the condition
02:02 - whether it's true or not but not both
02:04 - the blocks right
02:07 - right if something like this if you are
02:11 - going to supermarket and your mom asked
02:12 - like buy mangoes and if mangoes are not
02:15 - available then buy apples right first
02:19 - condition is you will see search if
02:21 - mangoes are available you will buy
02:22 - mangoes otherwise otherwise it is what
02:25 - else otherwise by Apple
02:29 - okay so only one thing either mangoes or
02:33 - apples not both
02:35 - but here what first of all let's see the
02:38 - syntax then I'll show you the working
02:39 - also the syntax is simply you know the
02:42 - working of a whole Loop that we have
02:45 - discussed in previous video right
02:49 - so here we have this four any variable
02:52 - name in the sequence sequence is like
02:55 - less double set or dictionary or string
02:57 - right then statement one or more
02:59 - statements then after this we'll be
03:01 - using else without any indentation it is
03:05 - in the same line with 4 this these
03:08 - statements are indented right else here
03:12 - also we will write some statements or
03:14 - statement or statements this is else
03:16 - block
03:17 - right this is else block this is four
03:19 - now
03:21 - this
03:22 - sorry
03:24 - this else block would be executed these
03:27 - statements would be executed only if
03:33 - notice the difference only if this for
03:36 - Loop has completed successfully
03:40 - I am focusing on this line these the
03:42 - cells block would be executed
03:45 - the statement of else block would be
03:47 - executed only if
03:49 - this for Loop has completed successfully
03:52 - successfully
03:54 - not terminated like using break
03:57 - statement or if there is no if there is
04:00 - an error then also the sales flow would
04:02 - not be executed
04:04 - right let's see and I hope you know like
04:07 - for Loop is more like an iterator in
04:10 - Python not like we have some iterator
04:12 - method in other object 200 programming
04:15 - languages so for Loop is more like an
04:16 - iterator in this language in Python
04:18 - language
04:19 - so which is doing iteration traversing a
04:22 - sequence so sequence means we'll take
04:24 - any list string dictionary or set or
04:27 - tuples right and these statements would
04:29 - be executed once for each item in that
04:32 - sequence
04:33 - right that is basically for Loop and
04:36 - python right now we'll see one example
04:42 - so I am taking a list number is equal to
04:45 - this and the variable name I'm taking I
04:47 - in sequence name is now here we have
04:50 - numbers
04:51 - right
04:52 - and I'm just printing numbers print I
04:58 - that's it and after that else and here
05:00 - I'm writing
05:02 - so what would be output of this program
05:04 - numbers this is the list for I numbers
05:07 - you know the working of for Loop this
05:10 - this would first of all 2 then 3 then 5
05:12 - then minus 1 is 0 then 53 I adjust a
05:15 - variable first of all 2 would be
05:17 - assigned to this I then 2 will be
05:19 - printed then 3 would be assigned to the
05:21 - side and 3 would be printed same then 5
05:23 - then minus 1 and 0 then 53 till the end
05:27 - of the list
05:28 - right
05:29 - after that it would print successfully
05:32 - completed see I've told you this L
05:34 - statement would be executed only if this
05:38 - for Loop has been completed successfully
05:40 - right it's not like that if for Loop has
05:43 - completely successfully then is else law
05:45 - could not be executed right maybe you
05:48 - are comparing with this if else working
05:50 - no that is not a case right but if
05:54 - somehow we break this for Loop using
05:56 - break we have a break keyword right
05:59 - break continue pass the those we will be
06:02 - discussing in a separate video but let
06:04 - me just brief you if you want to break
06:06 - this Loop anywhere suppose if
06:11 - uh I'm just printing I
06:14 - and if
06:16 - 0 sometimes if 0 is there if 0 is in the
06:21 - list then simply
06:23 - break
06:24 - and after that we'll be using else and
06:26 - this
06:27 - so okay then it will print two three
06:30 - five minus one and then one time I would
06:33 - be
06:34 - this I would be 0 so it will print 0 but
06:37 - now it will check if I is equal to 0 is
06:40 - equal to is equal to zero yes this
06:41 - condition is true means break break
06:43 - means exit from for Loop exit from this
06:47 - for Loop now this for Loop we have
06:50 - forcefully terminated is for Loop this
06:52 - is not complete yet right this time it
06:55 - will print only something like this
06:58 - it will not print this line successfully
07:01 - completed
07:03 - it will not hit this else block
07:06 - only the cell slope would be executed
07:08 - only and only if this Loop has been
07:12 - terminated successfully
07:13 - with all the iteration successfully
07:15 - right I hope you got this right means
07:18 - you can say uh this L says a symbol of
07:22 - no break
07:24 - if there is no break then this would be
07:27 - executed so symbol of like no break the
07:30 - successfully we have completed a for
07:32 - Loop that is a symbol of this the else
07:34 - block
07:35 - right
07:36 - so let's see this with the help of an
07:38 - example so let's create a new file here
07:41 - and that would be we'll be taking a name
07:44 - for underscore else Dot
07:48 - py
07:51 - and let's take a list or we can say
07:54 - let's take the Pulse
07:56 - we'll be taking a tuple
07:59 - like Tuple one
08:00 - and here Tuple should be in these uh
08:05 - round brackets so we'll be taking some
08:07 - some numbers like 256 34 3 5
08:13 - and like minus one any number we can
08:16 - take
08:18 - and we simply print like 4 I in
08:23 - double one
08:24 - right so simplest example I'm going to
08:28 - take just print these numbers
08:30 - and after that in else
08:32 - we will simply going to print
08:36 - Loop has been successfully completed and
08:38 - we are in else block now
08:40 - okay let's run this
08:42 - and see what output you will get here
08:48 - 256 34 3 5 minus 1 would be printed and
08:51 - then this line also because this Loop
08:53 - has been successfully completed
08:55 - only then this else part would be
08:57 - executed if if I write something like
08:59 - this if I break this Loop successfully
09:01 - using break uh keyword we can control C
09:04 - break is so you can say control
09:05 - statement here we can control the
09:07 - working of Loops so I am just breaking
09:10 - the loop if we find like if you find
09:14 - like I if I is equal to is equal to
09:16 - suppose 5.
09:19 - if there is an element Phi here
09:23 - then break
09:28 - let's run this
09:30 - okay see now
09:32 - the output will be now
09:34 - 256 34 3
09:37 - then one by one all element would be
09:39 - assigned to the side then 5 would be
09:41 - assigned so 5 would be printed then this
09:44 - condition this statement if I is equal
09:46 - to is equal to 5 yes condition is true
09:47 - so enter into here and here we find a
09:50 - break break means out of exit from the
09:52 - loop forcefully exit from the loop yeah
09:55 - you know forcefully exiting uh the
09:57 - control from the loop break means out of
09:59 - the loop means this time this else would
10:02 - not be executed because Loop has not
10:04 - been successfully completed
10:07 - still some iterations are left right
10:11 - so this else law could not be executed
10:13 - this time and without else if we write
10:15 - any statement like print and uh
10:19 - out of 4 else simply
10:23 - yeah this would be executed
10:26 - like 256 34 3 5 would be printed as soon
10:30 - as we find a five break break means out
10:33 - of this Loop so obviously X else would
10:35 - not be executed and this line would be
10:37 - executed out of four ends
10:39 - if no break
10:43 - if no break then also all the numbers
10:47 - would be printed first
10:49 - then
10:50 - successfully completed
10:52 - else block would be executed then this
10:55 - statement also executed so this else
10:57 - flow just simply symbolize that no break
11:01 - we haven't used any break in for Loop
11:04 - for Loop has successfully completed
11:06 - that's it right suppose let's take
11:09 - another example if I take something like
11:11 - this
11:13 - if
11:15 - we are finding a number is divisible by
11:17 - uh 6 here
11:20 - equal to equal to 0 how to check I hope
11:23 - you know then simply break at that time
11:26 - we'll be using break
11:28 - if there is a number that is divisible
11:30 - by 6 break
11:32 - right
11:33 - if no number suppose rather than here
11:39 - I am using this okay we cannot use this
11:43 - else here if else
11:47 - and here we simply print
11:49 - so we'll be just doing comment will be
11:52 - commenting out all these statements
11:54 - right
11:56 - now if a number is divisible by 6 then
11:59 - simply break or simply you can say print
12:03 - that number first and then break right
12:06 - let's not print any number here
12:09 - this is the program we have
12:11 - let's run this and see what output 2
12:13 - will get C
12:17 - for every element it is saying there is
12:20 - no number divisible by 6 in this
12:21 - sequence
12:22 - two first time two no divisible by six
12:25 - then fifty six
12:27 - not divisible by 6 34 no divisible by 6
12:31 - 3 5 and minus seven right
12:33 - so there is no number divisible by 6 so
12:36 - will not enter
12:37 - in this statement
12:39 - and every time L should be executed but
12:41 - I don't want that for every item the
12:44 - cells would be executed only one time
12:47 - the statement would be printed right so
12:50 - rather than here rather than here
12:53 - we can use
12:55 - 4 else rather than if else that would be
12:58 - better
12:59 - right
13:00 - so here we have 4 else
13:06 - and this line
13:11 - we'll be using in this else there is no
13:15 - number digital by 6 in the sequence
13:16 - let's run this
13:18 - and see only one time it would be
13:20 - printed now maybe you are thinking we
13:22 - have used break here and still this else
13:25 - slope is executing
13:26 - so that is not
13:29 - true
13:30 - but what yeah we have used break here
13:33 - but this break has never been hit why so
13:37 - big is C
13:38 - 2 I is 2 this condition not true so
13:42 - obviously we are not going to enter into
13:43 - this for Loop so break statement would
13:45 - not be executed
13:46 - right would not be hit
13:48 - then for 56 also then 34 then 3 then 5
13:51 - then minus 1 also this break statement
13:53 - is still untouched
13:56 - because control is not able to reach
14:00 - till this break statement because this
14:02 - condition is not true
14:04 - for any item this condition is you know
14:07 - not true
14:08 - so that is why this for Loop has
14:11 - successfully completed its working that
14:15 - is why we will be in else part now and
14:16 - it will print there is no number digital
14:18 - by six in the sequence I hope you now
14:20 - you good what is basically
14:22 - foreigns right there will be many
14:24 - situation uh in future when we'll be
14:26 - using the soils so I hope you got what
14:29 - is what else how to use foreign
14:36 - take care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen for Loop in Python right so next topic is foreigns Yes you heard it right it's four else not f l you must have heard if else in other programming languages like if you have if you are from CEC plus Java background then if else but not four else and while else right but yeah in Python we have a facility to use else this else keyword with for loop as well as with while loop right now what is this for else in Python the working the syntax why we use this when to use this and all we'll be discussing in this video about Forex with the help of program practically I will show you right but see the working is different from if else maybe you are thinking if else the working Forex would be same as if else and you know the working of vehicles may be right but no no no no the working is totally different see what is f else simply we write like if here we have if block here we have condition right then some statement then we have else and here also we have some statements right so either this or this block would be executed not both either this or this suppose I am taking like a is equal to 1 B is equal to a simple example so I'm thinking like if a equal to equal to B right this thing then print a is a and b are same else you will Print Different like and we are different right so the condition C A is 1 B is 2 is this condition true no so control will not go here control will go in else part and it will print different if a is 1 B is 1 in this case a is one B is one both are same condition true so control will enter here it will print A and B are same so control will not enter here so either this flow or this flow could be executed based on the condition whether it's true or not but not both the blocks right right if something like this if you are going to supermarket and your mom asked like buy mangoes and if mangoes are not available then buy apples right first condition is you will see search if mangoes are available you will buy mangoes otherwise otherwise it is what else otherwise by Apple okay so only one thing either mangoes or apples not both but here what first of all let's see the syntax then I'll show you the working also the syntax is simply you know the working of a whole Loop that we have discussed in previous video right so here we have this four any variable name in the sequence sequence is like less double set or dictionary or string right then statement one or more statements then after this we'll be using else without any indentation it is in the same line with 4 this these statements are indented right else here also we will write some statements or statement or statements this is else block right this is else block this is four now this sorry this else block would be executed these statements would be executed only if notice the difference only if this for Loop has completed successfully I am focusing on this line these the cells block would be executed the statement of else block would be executed only if this for Loop has completed successfully successfully not terminated like using break statement or if there is no if there is an error then also the sales flow would not be executed right let's see and I hope you know like for Loop is more like an iterator in Python not like we have some iterator method in other object 200 programming languages so for Loop is more like an iterator in this language in Python language so which is doing iteration traversing a sequence so sequence means we'll take any list string dictionary or set or tuples right and these statements would be executed once for each item in that sequence right that is basically for Loop and python right now we'll see one example so I am taking a list number is equal to this and the variable name I'm taking I in sequence name is now here we have numbers right and I'm just printing numbers print I that's it and after that else and here I'm writing so what would be output of this program numbers this is the list for I numbers you know the working of for Loop this this would first of all 2 then 3 then 5 then minus 1 is 0 then 53 I adjust a variable first of all 2 would be assigned to this I then 2 will be printed then 3 would be assigned to the side and 3 would be printed same then 5 then minus 1 and 0 then 53 till the end of the list right after that it would print successfully completed see I've told you this L statement would be executed only if this for Loop has been completed successfully right it's not like that if for Loop has completely successfully then is else law could not be executed right maybe you are comparing with this if else working no that is not a case right but if somehow we break this for Loop using break we have a break keyword right break continue pass the those we will be discussing in a separate video but let me just brief you if you want to break this Loop anywhere suppose if uh I'm just printing I and if 0 sometimes if 0 is there if 0 is in the list then simply break and after that we'll be using else and this so okay then it will print two three five minus one and then one time I would be this I would be 0 so it will print 0 but now it will check if I is equal to 0 is equal to is equal to zero yes this condition is true means break break means exit from for Loop exit from this for Loop now this for Loop we have forcefully terminated is for Loop this is not complete yet right this time it will print only something like this it will not print this line successfully completed it will not hit this else block only the cell slope would be executed only and only if this Loop has been terminated successfully with all the iteration successfully right I hope you got this right means you can say uh this L says a symbol of no break if there is no break then this would be executed so symbol of like no break the successfully we have completed a for Loop that is a symbol of this the else block right so let's see this with the help of an example so let's create a new file here and that would be we'll be taking a name for underscore else Dot py and let's take a list or we can say let's take the Pulse we'll be taking a tuple like Tuple one and here Tuple should be in these uh round brackets so we'll be taking some some numbers like 256 34 3 5 and like minus one any number we can take and we simply print like 4 I in double one right so simplest example I'm going to take just print these numbers and after that in else we will simply going to print Loop has been successfully completed and we are in else block now okay let's run this and see what output you will get here 256 34 3 5 minus 1 would be printed and then this line also because this Loop has been successfully completed only then this else part would be executed if if I write something like this if I break this Loop successfully using break uh keyword we can control C break is so you can say control statement here we can control the working of Loops so I am just breaking the loop if we find like if you find like I if I is equal to is equal to suppose 5. if there is an element Phi here then break let's run this okay see now the output will be now 256 34 3 then one by one all element would be assigned to the side then 5 would be assigned so 5 would be printed then this condition this statement if I is equal to is equal to 5 yes condition is true so enter into here and here we find a break break means out of exit from the loop forcefully exit from the loop yeah you know forcefully exiting uh the control from the loop break means out of the loop means this time this else would not be executed because Loop has not been successfully completed still some iterations are left right so this else law could not be executed this time and without else if we write any statement like print and uh out of 4 else simply yeah this would be executed like 256 34 3 5 would be printed as soon as we find a five break break means out of this Loop so obviously X else would not be executed and this line would be executed out of four ends if no break if no break then also all the numbers would be printed first then successfully completed else block would be executed then this statement also executed so this else flow just simply symbolize that no break we haven't used any break in for Loop for Loop has successfully completed that's it right suppose let's take another example if I take something like this if we are finding a number is divisible by uh 6 here equal to equal to 0 how to check I hope you know then simply break at that time we'll be using break if there is a number that is divisible by 6 break right if no number suppose rather than here I am using this okay we cannot use this else here if else and here we simply print so we'll be just doing comment will be commenting out all these statements right now if a number is divisible by 6 then simply break or simply you can say print that number first and then break right let's not print any number here this is the program we have let's run this and see what output 2 will get C for every element it is saying there is no number divisible by 6 in this sequence two first time two no divisible by six then fifty six not divisible by 6 34 no divisible by 6 3 5 and minus seven right so there is no number divisible by 6 so will not enter in this statement and every time L should be executed but I don't want that for every item the cells would be executed only one time the statement would be printed right so rather than here rather than here we can use 4 else rather than if else that would be better right so here we have 4 else and this line we'll be using in this else there is no number digital by 6 in the sequence let's run this and see only one time it would be printed now maybe you are thinking we have used break here and still this else slope is executing so that is not true but what yeah we have used break here but this break has never been hit why so big is C 2 I is 2 this condition not true so obviously we are not going to enter into this for Loop so break statement would not be executed right would not be hit then for 56 also then 34 then 3 then 5 then minus 1 also this break statement is still untouched because control is not able to reach till this break statement because this condition is not true for any item this condition is you know not true so that is why this for Loop has successfully completed its working that is why we will be in else part now and it will print there is no number digital by six in the sequence I hope you now you good what is basically foreigns right there will be many situation uh in future when we'll be using the soils so I hope you got what is what else how to use foreign take care
