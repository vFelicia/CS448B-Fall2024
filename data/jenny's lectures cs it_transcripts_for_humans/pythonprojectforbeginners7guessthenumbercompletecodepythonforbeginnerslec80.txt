00:00 - hey everyone I hope you all are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in the series of Learning
00:03 - Partner programming language in this
00:05 - video we'll be discussing one more
00:06 - project till now about this series we
00:08 - have discussed six projects so this is
00:10 - our seventh project and these projects
00:12 - are of you know not of that high level
00:15 - these are for beginners right so the
00:18 - project is you have to guess the correct
00:21 - number okay okay first of all let me
00:23 - just show you the output
00:26 - whenever after you know completing the
00:28 - project whenever you will run that
00:30 - project then what it should give you
00:32 - like what kind of output you will get
00:34 - see so it will show whenever you will
00:36 - run it will show something like this
00:38 - like the name of the project guess the
00:39 - number how to uh you know print this
00:42 - skyr that also will tell you now it will
00:45 - show like let me think of a number
00:46 - between one two
00:47 - fifty you can take here one to five
00:50 - hundred any range you can take maybe
00:52 - 5200 or anything right I'm taking just
00:56 - an example of 1 to 50. now choose level
00:59 - of difficulty is your heart I am
01:01 - choosing easy
01:03 - now it will show for easy level you have
01:05 - 10 attempts for hard level you are
01:06 - having five attempts so it will show you
01:08 - have 10 attempts remaining to guess the
01:09 - number now you have to make a guess
01:11 - suppose 30.
01:13 - now it will show your guess is too low
01:16 - guess again now you have only nine
01:18 - attempts right guess is too low means
01:21 - the number is above 30 so I'm guessing
01:24 - it's 40. but your guess is the same too
01:26 - high yes again
01:29 - and then it will show you have eight
01:31 - attempts now
01:32 - so let's 45
01:34 - your guess is too high again then it's
01:37 - 42
01:38 - it's again too high suppose 41
01:42 - it's 2i
01:45 - 40.
01:47 - again too high
01:49 - 35
01:51 - too high
01:53 - 33
01:55 - again it's too high and I have only two
01:58 - remaining attempt like 32
02:01 - C your guess is right and the answer was
02:03 - 32. that will stop right okay let's run
02:07 - this again if I am choosing hard level
02:10 - now you are having only five attempts
02:12 - remaining to guess the number guess 40.
02:15 - it's too high 30. again 2i 20.
02:20 - then 2 higher than 10 it's again too
02:24 - high and now I'm only having one attempt
02:26 - so let's say 5.
02:29 - your guess is too low
02:31 - you are out of gases you lose
02:34 - this time because you are out of attempt
02:37 - now only five attempt in only five
02:39 - attempts you have to place the right
02:40 - number in hard level
02:42 - right so I hope now you have idea what
02:45 - you need to do so you can just make a
02:48 - flowchart first divide or divide this
02:50 - thing in modules right first thing it
02:53 - will ask it will show this thing then it
02:57 - will ask for difficulty level according
02:58 - to difficulty level it will show how
03:00 - many attempts you are having right then
03:03 - make a guess then it will compare
03:08 - the number which this computer has
03:11 - thought and your guess so it will
03:14 - compare those two numbers and according
03:17 - whatever the result of that comparison
03:19 - it's too high or too low it will show
03:21 - you the result and then
03:23 - yes again this message would be again
03:25 - printed yes again and now this message
03:28 - again would be printed but
03:30 - with one less number of attempt right
03:34 - like this so this this thing is in
03:36 - repetition like make a guess according
03:39 - to it will show the result if it is not
03:41 - correct then yes again and then it will
03:43 - show the number of attempts right
03:46 - so now according to this you can just
03:48 - divide this into number of modules and
03:49 - then work on different different like
03:51 - small small modules divide this problem
03:53 - into small part so try to first of all
03:55 - create a flowchart I hope you can create
03:57 - that flowchart right
04:00 - pause the video and try this out okay so
04:02 - I hope you have done this now let's
04:04 - create a new file and name it guess the
04:07 - number.py
04:09 - right
04:11 - first what it will show the sky art
04:13 - later we will add on right that is for
04:16 - decoration
04:17 - okay first it will show you what
04:21 - let me think of a
04:23 - number this kind of thing see see let me
04:26 - think of a number between 1 to 50 right
04:31 - now how you can generate a random number
04:33 - from 1 to 50 in a Range
04:36 - if you are aware about that module
04:39 - random module that we have discussed in
04:40 - previous videos you know what is the
04:43 - function
04:44 - that is from this module random dot we
04:46 - have a function Rand int and you can
04:50 - just give the range 1 to 50. it will
04:52 - generate a number between 1 to 50 both 1
04:55 - and 50 are inclusive right and whatever
04:58 - number you it will generate we can just
05:00 - store that thing in a variable answer or
05:02 - any other variable
05:04 - right but don't show this to the user
05:07 - whenever you run this okay
05:09 - but for this for trial purpose now let's
05:11 - just show the answer
05:13 - to user now it will ask
05:16 - what choose level of difficulty is your
05:19 - hard so let's just input that thing also
05:22 - using input function take input whatever
05:24 - you will input that let's take a
05:26 - variable
05:27 - level in that we are going to store okay
05:32 - so easy and hard that is the string so
05:33 - no need to convert this into int
05:36 - now if easy or hard according to that
05:39 - the number of attempts for easy it
05:41 - should be 10 for R it should be 5 okay
05:44 - now suppose we are having a function see
05:47 - you can do it without using a function
05:49 - that is your way there are multiple ways
05:52 - to do this project right but we have
05:55 - discussed functions recently so that is
05:57 - why I am using functions in this case
05:59 - right so let's just have a function set
06:04 - difficulty
06:06 - and there just pass one argument level
06:10 - we are calling this function so before
06:11 - calling obviously we have to Define this
06:14 - so let us Define this function set
06:22 - difficulty and level
06:26 - chosen the variable I'm taking level
06:28 - chosen or simply same variable level
06:31 - level you can take same name it's up to
06:33 - you no problem
06:35 - now check if this
06:38 - level chosen is equal to is equal to
06:41 - easy in that case number of attempts are
06:44 - 10. so maybe you can
06:47 - say something like this
06:49 - number of
06:52 - or simply attempts
06:55 - equal to 10 you can set this right ah Pi
07:00 - something like this so these are
07:03 - we can say these are local variables
07:05 - attempts attempts within this function
07:07 - right
07:09 - so
07:11 - it's better to create like we can say we
07:15 - have constants also like Pi is a
07:17 - constant
07:18 - so let's create we create up that
07:20 - variable Pi globally that is a constant
07:23 - and anywhere in your program we can use
07:24 - that so better to create these variables
07:27 - global
07:29 - right and globally but
07:33 - it should be a constant means no one can
07:35 - change means we should not change these
07:38 - variable
07:39 - right
07:40 - so simple if you take any variable we
07:43 - take this type of name
07:45 - so to differentiate that this should be
07:47 - a constant and we should not change this
07:49 - value during this code we can take
07:52 - something like this like e
07:55 - we can take the variable name in capital
07:58 - letter
07:59 - right
08:00 - so easy
08:02 - level
08:06 - attempts equal to 10. set this and
08:16 - hard level attempts
08:18 - and hard level attempts is equal to 5.
08:21 - right
08:23 - so it would be clear like if these are
08:26 - in capital letter it means I want this
08:28 - should be a constant this is a constant
08:30 - and I don't want to change this during
08:31 - this score
08:33 - I don't want that anyone should change
08:37 - this these two variables right
08:40 - now or you can choose this method also
08:44 - attempt and attempt five rather than
08:45 - creating constant okay I'm just giving
08:48 - you one way of solving this question if
08:51 - you got this thing then there are
08:52 - multiple ways and you can try out
08:54 - different different uh different
08:56 - different ways and you can play the with
08:57 - this code right
08:59 - so rather than this what I do
09:03 - you also have okay
09:08 - done this thing like return now if level
09:11 - is easy then return
09:14 - this one
09:19 - easy level attempts
09:21 - l
09:22 - return hard level items means return 10
09:25 - or return 5. okay so it is returning
09:29 - that is why we have to store that thing
09:32 - in a variably
09:34 - so
09:37 - we can store this in attempts a variable
09:40 - name attempt simply attempts
09:42 - okay now
09:45 - that is fine now it will ask now next
09:48 - thing is
09:49 - it will show you have five attempts
09:51 - remaining to guess the number but this
09:53 - line is this C repeating you have four
09:55 - attempts you have three attempts you
09:56 - have two attempts only the change is
09:58 - this value so this line should be
10:01 - in a loop
10:02 - right and then make a guess this also is
10:06 - in a loop then your guess is too high
10:09 - like obviously this this thing you will
10:12 - see later
10:13 - right
10:14 - now
10:16 - now first it should print
10:18 - number of attempts remaining so use F
10:21 - string and
10:24 - you have
10:25 - how many attempts left
10:27 - that is in
10:29 - this you can say this variable attempts
10:33 - you have this many attempts remaining
10:36 - to guess the number right although this
10:38 - is in Loop but that also will see now
10:41 - let's ask
10:43 - from the user or like yes a number and
10:47 - whatever it will guess that I'll store
10:49 - in this
10:51 - variable guest number
10:54 - right
10:55 - okay now we have to check
10:58 - the this number and our guess number is
11:01 - same or not so let's suppose we have a
11:03 - function
11:05 - check
11:06 - answer and there obviously we are going
11:09 - to pass your guest number and
11:12 - the answer and then we will compare
11:15 - right so let's define that also let's
11:19 - define
11:20 - that function
11:22 - so it will accept to argument guest
11:26 - number and answer same name I am taking
11:27 - you can take different name modes so
11:29 - that is also fine
11:30 - now compare
11:32 - if
11:33 - this guest number is less than
11:37 - or answer
11:39 - means it will print first what what
11:42 - message
11:43 - your guess is too low
11:45 - and second thing what it will do it will
11:48 - reduce the number of attempts by one
11:50 - okay and it will again Ask it will print
11:53 - that message also yes again your guess
11:56 - is like maybe 2 low or two I and then it
11:58 - will print a message guess again
12:01 - and then
12:02 - it will reduce the number of attempts
12:04 - and this line would be again printed
12:05 - right
12:06 - so
12:08 - reduce the number of attempts by one but
12:12 - how you can reduce that thing so one way
12:15 - we can do is in this parameter again
12:19 - pass
12:20 - the attempts one more uh sorry again not
12:23 - again one more argument that is number
12:25 - of attempts
12:27 - whatever number of attempts at first you
12:28 - have like 10 so that would be also
12:30 - passed as an argument so here
12:33 - same name I'm taking attempts
12:36 - so it will do
12:38 - attempts sorry
12:42 - attempt minus one okay so suppose it is
12:46 - returning
12:47 - these attempts minus 1.
12:51 - okay till now it's fine
12:54 - but
12:55 - else if L if
13:00 - your guess number is greater than
13:03 - answer in that case what should be
13:05 - printed
13:06 - your guess is too high and okay same
13:10 - thing
13:10 - this time also
13:13 - this will do return attempt minus 1.
13:17 - okay
13:19 - else
13:21 - it will print your guess is right and
13:24 - the answer was
13:26 - in which variable we are having the
13:28 - answer in answer variable so using X
13:31 - string we can print that thing right
13:33 - your guess is right and the answer was
13:35 - this
13:36 - now back to okay where it will return to
13:40 - this check answer
13:42 - so we are
13:45 - see it is returning simple the returning
13:48 - attempts minus 1 means a number variable
13:53 - attempts
13:54 - okay see you know this line
13:57 - this line these are in should be a loop
14:01 - right
14:02 - so after setting this difficulty level
14:05 - this should be in Loop so
14:07 - Y and what is the condition to break
14:10 - this Loop if the answer is equal to the
14:13 - guest number then simply break the loop
14:15 - loop you no need to guess again okay so
14:19 - while
14:22 - your guest
14:24 - number
14:26 - not equal to
14:31 - so why your guest number not equal to
14:35 - your answer till then these lines should
14:38 - be repeated
14:39 - but see it will give any advice so
14:41 - because guess number is a variable we
14:44 - are using before
14:47 - we are defining this variable because
14:48 - here we are taking guest number is equal
14:50 - to this and before this only we are
14:53 - using this so
14:55 - because see before we are not having any
14:58 - variable guest number
14:59 - so it will give an error so better to do
15:02 - one thing
15:05 - to run this program successfully just
15:07 - set the guest number first zero at first
15:11 - right now it's fine obviously 0 not
15:13 - equal to the answer and 0 is not within
15:16 - the range of 1 to 50. so definitely at
15:18 - first time this condition would be
15:20 - definitely false so we are going to
15:21 - enter here
15:23 - for sure right
15:25 - okay now
15:27 - okay so in this end we have sorry we are
15:29 - having an error
15:31 - before this we should write down like
15:34 - hint now it's fine
15:38 - now let's run this
15:39 - and see let me think of think of number
15:41 - between 1 to 50 and
15:43 - 15. we know the answer it's just a trial
15:45 - version
15:46 - let's choose the level hard now you have
15:48 - five attempts remaining to guess the
15:50 - number let's
15:51 - guess number 30 your guess is too low
15:53 - you have only four attempts remaining to
15:55 - guess the number guess the number
15:57 - suppose I'm guessing 45. again two low
16:00 - three attempts 12. two low two attempts
16:04 - 23.
16:06 - you have only one attempts okay 45
16:10 - see now see your guess is too low you
16:12 - have zero attempts but still it is
16:14 - asking yes a number yes a number suppose
16:17 - six
16:18 - you have minus one attempts remaining to
16:20 - guess a number means
16:22 - we should stop the loop if number of
16:25 - attempts are zero right
16:28 - if number of attempts are zero then also
16:29 - Stop the Loop and if you have guessed
16:32 - the right number then also Stop the Loop
16:34 - two condition to stop the loop right you
16:36 - got this thing I hope
16:38 - okay now
16:41 - check
16:42 - if
16:43 - these attempts equal to equal to
16:47 - zero
16:49 - right
16:50 - you are out of gases and you lose
16:54 - and here obviously you have to be out of
16:58 - this while loop
17:02 - right but the condition to exit from
17:04 - this while loop is only when the guess
17:07 - number is equal to the answer then only
17:09 - we can exit okay
17:11 - okay let's let it be like this only
17:17 - else if I write like else
17:20 - okay now else it should print yes again
17:22 - it is still having some bugs
17:25 - but let me just run this what it will
17:27 - show you
17:28 - let's choose hard level now you have
17:31 - five attempts guess a number 34 your
17:34 - guess is 2i Yes again this message this
17:36 - time has been printed yes again because
17:38 - we have printed this message now four
17:39 - attempts
17:40 - 34 23
17:43 - 12
17:44 - only one attempt 45 still guess a number
17:47 - you are having minus one attempt like
17:49 - this
17:50 - so you have to stop this thing
17:52 - if number of attempts are zero then then
17:54 - you have to
17:55 - stop this while loop right
17:58 - now how you can stop see we have one
18:01 - method like from a function we can
18:03 - return we know if you want to exert from
18:05 - that function we can simply write down a
18:08 - statement simple return that's it right
18:10 - so if this thing is in a function then
18:14 - simply what we can do we can simply
18:16 - write here
18:17 - return and it will be exit from this
18:20 - while loop as well as from the function
18:21 - right but if
18:24 - this is not in a function that is why it
18:25 - is showing an error because return we
18:27 - can return statement can be used only
18:28 - within a function right
18:31 - so let's put this thing into a function
18:33 - name suppose gay and we are not passing
18:37 - any argument everything
18:41 - from the first line right
18:43 - so everything should be indented
18:47 - right and at last definitely obviously
18:50 - to
18:51 - play this game you have to call that
18:52 - function to execute this functionality
18:54 - so we are calling this game now simply
18:57 - we can do return
18:59 - now it's fine
19:01 - if you are out of gases then definitely
19:03 - it will be you would be out of that Loop
19:05 - so again our guesser number
19:13 - see now
19:14 - you're out of guesses and you lose
19:17 - but what if you are not out of gases and
19:21 - you have just guessed the right number
19:23 - then also you have to be out from that
19:26 - Loop let's run this again let's see a
19:28 - bug here
19:30 - let's choose a level easy level you have
19:32 - 10 attempts 10. your guess is too lows
19:35 - okay 40 try to guess the right number
19:40 - 40 is too high okay 35
19:44 - is too low yes again and your RAM is
19:47 - seven atom too low means you let's guess
19:49 - 37.
19:50 - it's again too low so 38.
19:56 - again to root 39. see
19:59 - your guess is right the answer is was 39
20:02 - but guess again it is printing this
20:05 - statement yes again but this should not
20:07 - be a case it should not be printed this
20:10 - line
20:11 - your guess is right the answer is 39 and
20:12 - that's it right so this is the bug here
20:15 - yes again it should not be printed so in
20:18 - this else part you have to put something
20:20 - else okay
20:21 - one condition
20:23 - L if c not directly else guess again
20:28 - only if else if you are out of the cases
20:30 - you lose but else if
20:33 - still
20:35 - your guest number not equal to
20:38 - answer then only print guess again
20:43 - if the guess number is equal to answer
20:45 - then no need to print case again
20:48 - right I hope you got this condition
20:52 - why I am putting this condition
20:54 - okay let me just show you let's run this
20:57 - and same I'm taking easy level
21:01 - I'm trying to guess right
21:06 - see
21:07 - guess number nine and your guess is
21:09 - right the answer is nine but still
21:12 - I'm having one attempt left and it is
21:14 - not printing yes again right
21:16 - so because of this condition right now
21:20 - the ski art if you want to decorate your
21:24 - project
21:25 - so in Google you can search simply like
21:27 - text to a sky art generator right and on
21:31 - any link you can click and then see it
21:33 - will ask
21:34 - for enter your text so I am guessing I
21:38 - am entering the name of our project
21:39 - guess the number
21:41 - and then see this is a riskayat or you
21:44 - can change this also
21:47 - so you can change the font from here and
21:50 - what so from here you can copy this
21:54 - and then just create a new file and I'll
21:57 - just create your logo underscore r dot
21:59 - py and there take a variable name any
22:02 - variable name you can take
22:04 - logo and you can just
22:07 - paste this guess the number but before
22:10 - that
22:11 - this is a string here so you have to put
22:15 - this thing into
22:18 - these three quotation mark
22:21 - right
22:22 - now that's fine now in your
22:26 - project
22:29 - while starting your game you can just
22:32 - import
22:34 - you can just print what
22:38 - you first of all but you have to import
22:40 - that module because
22:43 - you are you are you have that sky in
22:46 - another module so import what is the
22:48 - name of that module logo underscore add
22:51 - so here you can simply print
22:53 - logo underscore art Dot
22:58 - logo there we have a name Logo right now
23:01 - let's run this
23:03 - see it will show the logo first guess
23:05 - the number right
23:06 - and now you can just
23:08 - okay one more thing you don't need to
23:11 - show this thing so that was just a trial
23:14 - version so better to
23:16 - delete this line because the answer
23:18 - should not be shown to the user now see
23:21 - let me think of a number between 1 to 15
23:23 - now it's not shown let me just try out
23:25 - one more time hard you have only five
23:27 - attempts 40 yes is too high 30
23:31 - your guess is right the answer was 30 in
23:34 - only one attempt I have got the answer
23:36 - right
23:37 - so this was our project I guess
23:40 - that is not so much tough
23:44 - and one more thing if you don't enter
23:46 - the level easy or hard if anything else
23:48 - you will enter Then what will happen so
23:50 - that also you can
23:52 - modify here suppose here only
23:55 - see set difficulty level
23:58 - here if I choose L if this
24:02 - level chosen equal to equal to
24:05 - hard then only return this thing
24:09 - else if something else you choose then
24:12 - it should print like
24:14 - maybe you have chosen a wrong level and
24:16 - play again
24:18 - now what we can do else
24:21 - simply we can return
24:25 - that set return means exit else return
24:28 - from set difficulty and
24:30 - here
24:32 - after this you need to check
24:35 - if
24:37 - these attempts whatever returned from
24:40 - there if the attempts
24:43 - not equal to
24:45 - easy level attempts and
24:49 - attempts not equal to
24:53 - hard level attempts
24:55 - means neither of this condition or this
24:57 - condition is true means
24:59 - sorry neither this condition
25:01 - nor this condition is true means
25:03 - something else you have entered so in
25:05 - that case what should be
25:08 - printed
25:10 - print like it should print a message you
25:12 - have entered wrong difficulty level play
25:14 - again and it should
25:16 - exit so simply you can write down here
25:21 - return
25:23 - let's send this
25:26 - and if I print here something else so
25:28 - you have entered wrong difficulty level
25:29 - play again so you have to start this so
25:32 - again right so like this you can play
25:34 - with this code if you think if you want
25:37 - to modify like you have entered this
25:38 - wrong difficulty level then it should
25:40 - ask again
25:42 - like choose again the level of
25:44 - difficulty type is your heart that also
25:46 - you can do but that is for your
25:48 - assignment okay now you can modify this
25:51 - thing whatever according to your you
25:54 - know
25:55 - creative thinking and what you want to
25:56 - do with this project if you want to
25:59 - modify if you want to upgrade this
26:00 - project then you can do that right I
26:03 - hope you got this the basic one and
26:05 - there are multiple ways to solve this
26:06 - problem to create this project it is not
26:09 - the one it is not the only one right
26:12 - so you can just write down this on a
26:14 - piece of paper you can manually run this
26:16 - manually right on this and definitely
26:18 - you will get it it's not that much done
26:19 - right now that's for this video now I'll
26:22 - see in the next video bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of Learning Partner programming language in this video we'll be discussing one more project till now about this series we have discussed six projects so this is our seventh project and these projects are of you know not of that high level these are for beginners right so the project is you have to guess the correct number okay okay first of all let me just show you the output whenever after you know completing the project whenever you will run that project then what it should give you like what kind of output you will get see so it will show whenever you will run it will show something like this like the name of the project guess the number how to uh you know print this skyr that also will tell you now it will show like let me think of a number between one two fifty you can take here one to five hundred any range you can take maybe 5200 or anything right I'm taking just an example of 1 to 50. now choose level of difficulty is your heart I am choosing easy now it will show for easy level you have 10 attempts for hard level you are having five attempts so it will show you have 10 attempts remaining to guess the number now you have to make a guess suppose 30. now it will show your guess is too low guess again now you have only nine attempts right guess is too low means the number is above 30 so I'm guessing it's 40. but your guess is the same too high yes again and then it will show you have eight attempts now so let's 45 your guess is too high again then it's 42 it's again too high suppose 41 it's 2i 40. again too high 35 too high 33 again it's too high and I have only two remaining attempt like 32 C your guess is right and the answer was 32. that will stop right okay let's run this again if I am choosing hard level now you are having only five attempts remaining to guess the number guess 40. it's too high 30. again 2i 20. then 2 higher than 10 it's again too high and now I'm only having one attempt so let's say 5. your guess is too low you are out of gases you lose this time because you are out of attempt now only five attempt in only five attempts you have to place the right number in hard level right so I hope now you have idea what you need to do so you can just make a flowchart first divide or divide this thing in modules right first thing it will ask it will show this thing then it will ask for difficulty level according to difficulty level it will show how many attempts you are having right then make a guess then it will compare the number which this computer has thought and your guess so it will compare those two numbers and according whatever the result of that comparison it's too high or too low it will show you the result and then yes again this message would be again printed yes again and now this message again would be printed but with one less number of attempt right like this so this this thing is in repetition like make a guess according to it will show the result if it is not correct then yes again and then it will show the number of attempts right so now according to this you can just divide this into number of modules and then work on different different like small small modules divide this problem into small part so try to first of all create a flowchart I hope you can create that flowchart right pause the video and try this out okay so I hope you have done this now let's create a new file and name it guess the number.py right first what it will show the sky art later we will add on right that is for decoration okay first it will show you what let me think of a number this kind of thing see see let me think of a number between 1 to 50 right now how you can generate a random number from 1 to 50 in a Range if you are aware about that module random module that we have discussed in previous videos you know what is the function that is from this module random dot we have a function Rand int and you can just give the range 1 to 50. it will generate a number between 1 to 50 both 1 and 50 are inclusive right and whatever number you it will generate we can just store that thing in a variable answer or any other variable right but don't show this to the user whenever you run this okay but for this for trial purpose now let's just show the answer to user now it will ask what choose level of difficulty is your hard so let's just input that thing also using input function take input whatever you will input that let's take a variable level in that we are going to store okay so easy and hard that is the string so no need to convert this into int now if easy or hard according to that the number of attempts for easy it should be 10 for R it should be 5 okay now suppose we are having a function see you can do it without using a function that is your way there are multiple ways to do this project right but we have discussed functions recently so that is why I am using functions in this case right so let's just have a function set difficulty and there just pass one argument level we are calling this function so before calling obviously we have to Define this so let us Define this function set difficulty and level chosen the variable I'm taking level chosen or simply same variable level level you can take same name it's up to you no problem now check if this level chosen is equal to is equal to easy in that case number of attempts are 10. so maybe you can say something like this number of or simply attempts equal to 10 you can set this right ah Pi something like this so these are we can say these are local variables attempts attempts within this function right so it's better to create like we can say we have constants also like Pi is a constant so let's create we create up that variable Pi globally that is a constant and anywhere in your program we can use that so better to create these variables global right and globally but it should be a constant means no one can change means we should not change these variable right so simple if you take any variable we take this type of name so to differentiate that this should be a constant and we should not change this value during this code we can take something like this like e we can take the variable name in capital letter right so easy level attempts equal to 10. set this and hard level attempts and hard level attempts is equal to 5. right so it would be clear like if these are in capital letter it means I want this should be a constant this is a constant and I don't want to change this during this score I don't want that anyone should change this these two variables right now or you can choose this method also attempt and attempt five rather than creating constant okay I'm just giving you one way of solving this question if you got this thing then there are multiple ways and you can try out different different uh different different ways and you can play the with this code right so rather than this what I do you also have okay done this thing like return now if level is easy then return this one easy level attempts l return hard level items means return 10 or return 5. okay so it is returning that is why we have to store that thing in a variably so we can store this in attempts a variable name attempt simply attempts okay now that is fine now it will ask now next thing is it will show you have five attempts remaining to guess the number but this line is this C repeating you have four attempts you have three attempts you have two attempts only the change is this value so this line should be in a loop right and then make a guess this also is in a loop then your guess is too high like obviously this this thing you will see later right now now first it should print number of attempts remaining so use F string and you have how many attempts left that is in this you can say this variable attempts you have this many attempts remaining to guess the number right although this is in Loop but that also will see now let's ask from the user or like yes a number and whatever it will guess that I'll store in this variable guest number right okay now we have to check the this number and our guess number is same or not so let's suppose we have a function check answer and there obviously we are going to pass your guest number and the answer and then we will compare right so let's define that also let's define that function so it will accept to argument guest number and answer same name I am taking you can take different name modes so that is also fine now compare if this guest number is less than or answer means it will print first what what message your guess is too low and second thing what it will do it will reduce the number of attempts by one okay and it will again Ask it will print that message also yes again your guess is like maybe 2 low or two I and then it will print a message guess again and then it will reduce the number of attempts and this line would be again printed right so reduce the number of attempts by one but how you can reduce that thing so one way we can do is in this parameter again pass the attempts one more uh sorry again not again one more argument that is number of attempts whatever number of attempts at first you have like 10 so that would be also passed as an argument so here same name I'm taking attempts so it will do attempts sorry attempt minus one okay so suppose it is returning these attempts minus 1. okay till now it's fine but else if L if your guess number is greater than answer in that case what should be printed your guess is too high and okay same thing this time also this will do return attempt minus 1. okay else it will print your guess is right and the answer was in which variable we are having the answer in answer variable so using X string we can print that thing right your guess is right and the answer was this now back to okay where it will return to this check answer so we are see it is returning simple the returning attempts minus 1 means a number variable attempts okay see you know this line this line these are in should be a loop right so after setting this difficulty level this should be in Loop so Y and what is the condition to break this Loop if the answer is equal to the guest number then simply break the loop loop you no need to guess again okay so while your guest number not equal to so why your guest number not equal to your answer till then these lines should be repeated but see it will give any advice so because guess number is a variable we are using before we are defining this variable because here we are taking guest number is equal to this and before this only we are using this so because see before we are not having any variable guest number so it will give an error so better to do one thing to run this program successfully just set the guest number first zero at first right now it's fine obviously 0 not equal to the answer and 0 is not within the range of 1 to 50. so definitely at first time this condition would be definitely false so we are going to enter here for sure right okay now okay so in this end we have sorry we are having an error before this we should write down like hint now it's fine now let's run this and see let me think of think of number between 1 to 50 and 15. we know the answer it's just a trial version let's choose the level hard now you have five attempts remaining to guess the number let's guess number 30 your guess is too low you have only four attempts remaining to guess the number guess the number suppose I'm guessing 45. again two low three attempts 12. two low two attempts 23. you have only one attempts okay 45 see now see your guess is too low you have zero attempts but still it is asking yes a number yes a number suppose six you have minus one attempts remaining to guess a number means we should stop the loop if number of attempts are zero right if number of attempts are zero then also Stop the Loop and if you have guessed the right number then also Stop the Loop two condition to stop the loop right you got this thing I hope okay now check if these attempts equal to equal to zero right you are out of gases and you lose and here obviously you have to be out of this while loop right but the condition to exit from this while loop is only when the guess number is equal to the answer then only we can exit okay okay let's let it be like this only else if I write like else okay now else it should print yes again it is still having some bugs but let me just run this what it will show you let's choose hard level now you have five attempts guess a number 34 your guess is 2i Yes again this message this time has been printed yes again because we have printed this message now four attempts 34 23 12 only one attempt 45 still guess a number you are having minus one attempt like this so you have to stop this thing if number of attempts are zero then then you have to stop this while loop right now how you can stop see we have one method like from a function we can return we know if you want to exert from that function we can simply write down a statement simple return that's it right so if this thing is in a function then simply what we can do we can simply write here return and it will be exit from this while loop as well as from the function right but if this is not in a function that is why it is showing an error because return we can return statement can be used only within a function right so let's put this thing into a function name suppose gay and we are not passing any argument everything from the first line right so everything should be indented right and at last definitely obviously to play this game you have to call that function to execute this functionality so we are calling this game now simply we can do return now it's fine if you are out of gases then definitely it will be you would be out of that Loop so again our guesser number see now you're out of guesses and you lose but what if you are not out of gases and you have just guessed the right number then also you have to be out from that Loop let's run this again let's see a bug here let's choose a level easy level you have 10 attempts 10. your guess is too lows okay 40 try to guess the right number 40 is too high okay 35 is too low yes again and your RAM is seven atom too low means you let's guess 37. it's again too low so 38. again to root 39. see your guess is right the answer is was 39 but guess again it is printing this statement yes again but this should not be a case it should not be printed this line your guess is right the answer is 39 and that's it right so this is the bug here yes again it should not be printed so in this else part you have to put something else okay one condition L if c not directly else guess again only if else if you are out of the cases you lose but else if still your guest number not equal to answer then only print guess again if the guess number is equal to answer then no need to print case again right I hope you got this condition why I am putting this condition okay let me just show you let's run this and same I'm taking easy level I'm trying to guess right see guess number nine and your guess is right the answer is nine but still I'm having one attempt left and it is not printing yes again right so because of this condition right now the ski art if you want to decorate your project so in Google you can search simply like text to a sky art generator right and on any link you can click and then see it will ask for enter your text so I am guessing I am entering the name of our project guess the number and then see this is a riskayat or you can change this also so you can change the font from here and what so from here you can copy this and then just create a new file and I'll just create your logo underscore r dot py and there take a variable name any variable name you can take logo and you can just paste this guess the number but before that this is a string here so you have to put this thing into these three quotation mark right now that's fine now in your project while starting your game you can just import you can just print what you first of all but you have to import that module because you are you are you have that sky in another module so import what is the name of that module logo underscore add so here you can simply print logo underscore art Dot logo there we have a name Logo right now let's run this see it will show the logo first guess the number right and now you can just okay one more thing you don't need to show this thing so that was just a trial version so better to delete this line because the answer should not be shown to the user now see let me think of a number between 1 to 15 now it's not shown let me just try out one more time hard you have only five attempts 40 yes is too high 30 your guess is right the answer was 30 in only one attempt I have got the answer right so this was our project I guess that is not so much tough and one more thing if you don't enter the level easy or hard if anything else you will enter Then what will happen so that also you can modify here suppose here only see set difficulty level here if I choose L if this level chosen equal to equal to hard then only return this thing else if something else you choose then it should print like maybe you have chosen a wrong level and play again now what we can do else simply we can return that set return means exit else return from set difficulty and here after this you need to check if these attempts whatever returned from there if the attempts not equal to easy level attempts and attempts not equal to hard level attempts means neither of this condition or this condition is true means sorry neither this condition nor this condition is true means something else you have entered so in that case what should be printed print like it should print a message you have entered wrong difficulty level play again and it should exit so simply you can write down here return let's send this and if I print here something else so you have entered wrong difficulty level play again so you have to start this so again right so like this you can play with this code if you think if you want to modify like you have entered this wrong difficulty level then it should ask again like choose again the level of difficulty type is your heart that also you can do but that is for your assignment okay now you can modify this thing whatever according to your you know creative thinking and what you want to do with this project if you want to modify if you want to upgrade this project then you can do that right I hope you got this the basic one and there are multiple ways to solve this problem to create this project it is not the one it is not the only one right so you can just write down this on a piece of paper you can manually run this manually right on this and definitely you will get it it's not that much done right now that's for this video now I'll see in the next video bye take care
