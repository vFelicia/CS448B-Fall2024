00:00 - in the series of learning programming
00:01 - see we are discussing printing pattern
00:03 - programs and see in this video i will
00:04 - talk about how to print this pattern
00:06 - inverted full pyramid in the previous
00:07 - video i have discussed how to print
00:09 - full parameter that was not inverted
00:11 - right so first of all please check that
00:13 - that video then you will get it
00:14 - better right i'll show you the logic on
00:16 - the first on this whiteboard we'll
00:18 - discuss
00:18 - we'll try it in that program here then
00:20 - i'll show the output on my laptop
00:22 - using vs code editor so now first of all
00:24 - whenever you see the pattern you have to
00:25 - analyze it and you have to divide it
00:27 - into like rows and columns then you will
00:30 - get it
00:30 - better right so i'm dividing dividing it
00:33 - into rows and columns
00:37 - see here we have five rows one two three
00:40 - four five so one
00:41 - would be responsible to handle these
00:43 - rows
00:44 - one is for this is what leading
00:47 - space and this space is what trailing
00:49 - space after the start trailing space
00:51 - before the star leading space
00:53 - right so in the first row there is no
00:55 - space
00:56 - so zero space here we have one space
00:58 - here we have two space here we have
01:00 - three
01:01 - and here we have four space before the
01:02 - star right so now
01:05 - first would be j outer loop we generally
01:07 - take
01:08 - the variable what i sorry not j i
01:11 - that is i would be responsible that
01:13 - would be responsible for these rows and
01:15 - jth would be responsible for the columns
01:19 - how many columns are there
01:23 - right so basically three loops would be
01:25 - required the outer loop would be
01:28 - in every pattern the outer loop would be
01:30 - responsible
01:31 - for the number of lines or the number of
01:34 - rows here
01:35 - right that is is loop one would be
01:38 - responsible to print these spaces
01:40 - and third loop would be responsible to
01:42 - print these stars
01:44 - right so now how we will print these
01:47 - thing
01:48 - see if i take i
01:53 - and space like how to analyze how to
01:55 - find out the condition
01:57 - right because in first in this row only
02:00 - one space before the star here we have
02:02 - two space here three space here four
02:04 - space
02:04 - so what should be the condition how many
02:06 - times in every row space should be
02:09 - printed how many times star should be
02:10 - printed what should be the condition
02:12 - right
02:12 - so now here see rather than taking i
02:16 - from 1 to 5 here i am taking i from 5 to
02:20 - 1
02:21 - why i am saying this let me just
02:24 - clear out that thing also
02:28 - it's not like that there is only one way
02:30 - to print this pattern i'm just
02:31 - discussing this way only there can be
02:32 - multiple ways also
02:34 - maybe loop outer loop would be from one
02:37 - to five and then
02:38 - in the inner loop you can change the
02:40 - condition and you can print this pattern
02:43 - but i am just changing the outer loop
02:45 - here from five
02:47 - to one why so see for the first row i
02:50 - value is 5 and there is no space
02:53 - no leading space for second i value is 4
02:56 - then 3 then 2 then 1
02:58 - space would be 0 then 1 then 2 then 3
03:01 - then 4
03:03 - right now how to find out the relation
03:07 - the condition to print the space see the
03:10 - same condition in the previous video
03:12 - also we have discussed number of rows
03:14 - minus i
03:14 - if i write number of rows minus i for
03:16 - space
03:18 - here total number of rows are five for
03:20 - the first line
03:22 - five minus i value is five not one it's
03:26 - five
03:26 - we are taking in decreasing one five
03:29 - minus five
03:29 - zero for second five minus four one for
03:32 - third five minus three
03:34 - two four fourth five minus two three
03:37 - five minus
03:38 - uh for this one five minus one that is
03:41 - four
03:41 - yes exactly we are getting it so this
03:44 - should be the condition for printing the
03:46 - space
03:47 - right for printing the star what should
03:50 - be the condition
03:51 - first of all let me write down this
03:53 - thing if we are not taking like
03:56 - the the the fixed value of i fixed value
03:59 - of number of rows like if you want the
04:00 - user should enter number of rows you or
04:02 - she want to print then what you can do
04:04 - you can just take a variable rows
04:07 - and you can ask from the user
04:11 - at the run time using printf and scanf
04:14 - right i hope you know how to
04:16 - take input at runtime
04:21 - i am taking the variable name rows i am
04:23 - not writing here the complete program
04:25 - i will discuss the complete program on
04:26 - my laptop right
04:28 - now outer loop would be i should be
04:32 - till number from number of rows see i is
04:35 - from 5 to 1
04:36 - but here i am not taking 5 here i am
04:38 - taking a variable
04:39 - rows so i would be initialized with rows
04:42 - whatever the value of rows 5 10
04:44 - 7 20 i should be greater than equal to
04:47 - till
04:48 - 1 whenever i value becomes 0 stop it
04:52 - so i should be greater than equal to 1
04:54 - and i minus minus h
04:56 - not plus plus right so now inner loop
04:59 - one loop would be responsible to print
05:01 - space so now space would be space would
05:03 - be initialized with one
05:04 - we have already found out the condition
05:05 - for space for printing space
05:08 - space is less than equal to rows minus i
05:15 - right and here we do not have space so i
05:18 - am writing here
05:19 - space plus plus and within this loop
05:22 - just print
05:24 - space right now
05:27 - one loop would be to print these stars
05:29 - now find out the condition to print star
05:31 - see in the first row we have nine stamps
05:35 - then seven then five then three then one
05:39 - the condition you can only find out
05:41 - using the three or
05:42 - four variables you have i j total number
05:45 - of rows
05:46 - space this thing only so you have to do
05:48 - with these variables only some
05:50 - multiplication division minus plus
05:52 - anything you can do to find out the
05:54 - condition right
05:55 - so better to print better to you know
05:58 - first of all you know
05:59 - write down this kind of table so that
06:01 - you can analyze what pattern is
06:03 - or what relation is there with these i
06:06 - space or j or
06:07 - star see here if i do
06:11 - 5 into 2 10 but here we have star 9
06:16 - here we have 2 into i that is 8 but here
06:18 - we have 7
06:19 - so what you can do 2 into i minus 1
06:22 - to print the stars for the first row i
06:26 - value is 5 that is 10 minus 1 9 okay
06:29 - for second 2 minus 4 minus 2 into 4 8
06:33 - minus 1 7
06:34 - okay for third 2 into 3 6 minus 1
06:37 - 5 okay 4 minus 1 3 2 minus 1 1
06:42 - yes and we got the condition to print
06:43 - star 2 into y minus 1
06:45 - right so this one j should be from 1
06:49 - j less than equal to 2 into i minus 1
06:52 - and
06:53 - j plus plus and within this
06:56 - simply print star
07:00 - and in the outer loop we have to print
07:02 - one more thing that is slash
07:05 - and that's it now let me dry run this
07:08 - see first of all it will ask enter
07:09 - number of rows and suppose
07:12 - one variable is rows and i'm entering
07:14 - total number of rows five
07:16 - so now first of all i would be
07:17 - initialized with rows so i is equal to
07:19 - five
07:20 - is five greater than equal to one yes
07:22 - condition tree we will enter here
07:24 - now space would be initialized with one
07:27 - now one less than equal to rows minus i
07:30 - total number of rows
07:31 - 5 minus i is also 5 5 minus 5
07:35 - 0 is this condition true 1 less than
07:37 - equal to 0 no
07:39 - will not enter into this loop exit from
07:41 - the loop and one more loop is there
07:43 - that is j is equal to one means no space
07:45 - would be printed and that's exactly what
07:46 - you want
07:48 - because in first line there is no space
07:50 - zero space we have
07:51 - right j one j less than equal to two
07:55 - into i minus one
07:58 - n minus 1 that is 9 because i value is 5
08:02 - yes condition tree we will enter here
08:03 - and star would be printed
08:07 - right now again j plus plus that is 2
08:10 - 2 less than equal to 9 yes means again
08:13 - star will be printed
08:14 - so how many times the slope would be run
08:18 - 9 times when j value becomes 10
08:21 - then it becomes false so means 9 star
08:24 - will be printed here
08:27 - now when j value becomes finally 10
08:30 - condition not to exit from the loop and
08:32 - slash and now cursor would be next
08:34 - line now i minus minus now i becomes 4
08:38 - is 4 greater than equal to one yes
08:39 - condition tree we will enter into this
08:41 - loop
08:42 - space would be again initialized with
08:43 - one now one less than equal to
08:45 - now see rows minus one total number of
08:47 - rows five
08:48 - minus sorry i rose minus i
08:51 - five minus i value is 4 that is 5 minus
08:54 - 4 that is 1
08:55 - now condition trim now we will enter
08:57 - into here
08:58 - into this and space would be printed one
09:01 - space
09:01 - below this first star right
09:05 - space plus plus that is 2 2 less than
09:08 - equal to 1 condition to you know
09:10 - now we will not enter here means no
09:12 - space would be printed
09:13 - and that's exactly we want only one
09:15 - space in second line
09:17 - now out from this loop and now j would
09:18 - be again initialized with
09:20 - 1 now 1 less than equal to c 2 into i
09:24 - minus 1 now i value is 4
09:25 - 2 into 4 8 minus 1 that is 7. is this
09:28 - condition true yes you will enter here
09:30 - and star would be printed so how many
09:32 - times this 2 would be executed
09:33 - 7 times whenever j value becomes 8
09:37 - then it is going to stop so now means 7
09:40 - star would be printed here
09:42 - and that's exactly we want 7 star
09:45 - right when i value j value becomes 8
09:48 - exit from the loop and slash and means
09:50 - next line
09:51 - now i minus minus i becomes three now i
09:53 - hope you can you got it
09:54 - you can draw iron by yourself right now
09:57 - let me show you the output of this
09:59 - into my laptop on my laptop now let me
10:01 - create one more file
10:03 - that is pattern 9 dot c
10:06 - right and we have already discussed in
10:09 - the previous video how to print the
10:10 - pyramid
10:11 - this is just the inverted pyramid so we
10:13 - don't have to
10:14 - you know change much so i'm just copying
10:17 - the previous code here
10:19 - if you haven't watched my previous video
10:20 - please check it out first
10:23 - then come to this video right so i'm
10:25 - just copying the previous code here
10:27 - the only uh difference here is what just
10:30 - have to change the
10:32 - this one uh that outer loop for the
10:35 - number of lines
10:36 - i would be initialized with rows it
10:38 - should be in decreasing order
10:40 - right and i should be greater than equal
10:43 - to 1
10:44 - here i minus minus right
10:48 - space lu would be same the condition
10:49 - would be rows minus i
10:51 - and for the printing the star we have
10:53 - same condition that is 2 into i minus 1
10:55 - right now just let me just run this
10:59 - now say it is asking enter number of
11:00 - rows let me enter 5
11:03 - and see the pattern now let me just run
11:05 - this for
11:06 - 10 number of rows
11:10 - 10 and see this is inverted full pyramid
11:14 - right so i hope you would have to print
11:16 - this pattern
11:18 - so i hope you got how to print this
11:19 - pattern now i'll see in the next video
11:21 - with a new pattern till then bye take
11:22 - care

Cleaned transcript:

in the series of learning programming see we are discussing printing pattern programs and see in this video i will talk about how to print this pattern inverted full pyramid in the previous video i have discussed how to print full parameter that was not inverted right so first of all please check that that video then you will get it better right i'll show you the logic on the first on this whiteboard we'll discuss we'll try it in that program here then i'll show the output on my laptop using vs code editor so now first of all whenever you see the pattern you have to analyze it and you have to divide it into like rows and columns then you will get it better right so i'm dividing dividing it into rows and columns see here we have five rows one two three four five so one would be responsible to handle these rows one is for this is what leading space and this space is what trailing space after the start trailing space before the star leading space right so in the first row there is no space so zero space here we have one space here we have two space here we have three and here we have four space before the star right so now first would be j outer loop we generally take the variable what i sorry not j i that is i would be responsible that would be responsible for these rows and jth would be responsible for the columns how many columns are there right so basically three loops would be required the outer loop would be in every pattern the outer loop would be responsible for the number of lines or the number of rows here right that is is loop one would be responsible to print these spaces and third loop would be responsible to print these stars right so now how we will print these thing see if i take i and space like how to analyze how to find out the condition right because in first in this row only one space before the star here we have two space here three space here four space so what should be the condition how many times in every row space should be printed how many times star should be printed what should be the condition right so now here see rather than taking i from 1 to 5 here i am taking i from 5 to 1 why i am saying this let me just clear out that thing also it's not like that there is only one way to print this pattern i'm just discussing this way only there can be multiple ways also maybe loop outer loop would be from one to five and then in the inner loop you can change the condition and you can print this pattern but i am just changing the outer loop here from five to one why so see for the first row i value is 5 and there is no space no leading space for second i value is 4 then 3 then 2 then 1 space would be 0 then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 right now how to find out the relation the condition to print the space see the same condition in the previous video also we have discussed number of rows minus i if i write number of rows minus i for space here total number of rows are five for the first line five minus i value is five not one it's five we are taking in decreasing one five minus five zero for second five minus four one for third five minus three two four fourth five minus two three five minus uh for this one five minus one that is four yes exactly we are getting it so this should be the condition for printing the space right for printing the star what should be the condition first of all let me write down this thing if we are not taking like the the the fixed value of i fixed value of number of rows like if you want the user should enter number of rows you or she want to print then what you can do you can just take a variable rows and you can ask from the user at the run time using printf and scanf right i hope you know how to take input at runtime i am taking the variable name rows i am not writing here the complete program i will discuss the complete program on my laptop right now outer loop would be i should be till number from number of rows see i is from 5 to 1 but here i am not taking 5 here i am taking a variable rows so i would be initialized with rows whatever the value of rows 5 10 7 20 i should be greater than equal to till 1 whenever i value becomes 0 stop it so i should be greater than equal to 1 and i minus minus h not plus plus right so now inner loop one loop would be responsible to print space so now space would be space would be initialized with one we have already found out the condition for space for printing space space is less than equal to rows minus i right and here we do not have space so i am writing here space plus plus and within this loop just print space right now one loop would be to print these stars now find out the condition to print star see in the first row we have nine stamps then seven then five then three then one the condition you can only find out using the three or four variables you have i j total number of rows space this thing only so you have to do with these variables only some multiplication division minus plus anything you can do to find out the condition right so better to print better to you know first of all you know write down this kind of table so that you can analyze what pattern is or what relation is there with these i space or j or star see here if i do 5 into 2 10 but here we have star 9 here we have 2 into i that is 8 but here we have 7 so what you can do 2 into i minus 1 to print the stars for the first row i value is 5 that is 10 minus 1 9 okay for second 2 minus 4 minus 2 into 4 8 minus 1 7 okay for third 2 into 3 6 minus 1 5 okay 4 minus 1 3 2 minus 1 1 yes and we got the condition to print star 2 into y minus 1 right so this one j should be from 1 j less than equal to 2 into i minus 1 and j plus plus and within this simply print star and in the outer loop we have to print one more thing that is slash and that's it now let me dry run this see first of all it will ask enter number of rows and suppose one variable is rows and i'm entering total number of rows five so now first of all i would be initialized with rows so i is equal to five is five greater than equal to one yes condition tree we will enter here now space would be initialized with one now one less than equal to rows minus i total number of rows 5 minus i is also 5 5 minus 5 0 is this condition true 1 less than equal to 0 no will not enter into this loop exit from the loop and one more loop is there that is j is equal to one means no space would be printed and that's exactly what you want because in first line there is no space zero space we have right j one j less than equal to two into i minus one n minus 1 that is 9 because i value is 5 yes condition tree we will enter here and star would be printed right now again j plus plus that is 2 2 less than equal to 9 yes means again star will be printed so how many times the slope would be run 9 times when j value becomes 10 then it becomes false so means 9 star will be printed here now when j value becomes finally 10 condition not to exit from the loop and slash and now cursor would be next line now i minus minus now i becomes 4 is 4 greater than equal to one yes condition tree we will enter into this loop space would be again initialized with one now one less than equal to now see rows minus one total number of rows five minus sorry i rose minus i five minus i value is 4 that is 5 minus 4 that is 1 now condition trim now we will enter into here into this and space would be printed one space below this first star right space plus plus that is 2 2 less than equal to 1 condition to you know now we will not enter here means no space would be printed and that's exactly we want only one space in second line now out from this loop and now j would be again initialized with 1 now 1 less than equal to c 2 into i minus 1 now i value is 4 2 into 4 8 minus 1 that is 7. is this condition true yes you will enter here and star would be printed so how many times this 2 would be executed 7 times whenever j value becomes 8 then it is going to stop so now means 7 star would be printed here and that's exactly we want 7 star right when i value j value becomes 8 exit from the loop and slash and means next line now i minus minus i becomes three now i hope you can you got it you can draw iron by yourself right now let me show you the output of this into my laptop on my laptop now let me create one more file that is pattern 9 dot c right and we have already discussed in the previous video how to print the pyramid this is just the inverted pyramid so we don't have to you know change much so i'm just copying the previous code here if you haven't watched my previous video please check it out first then come to this video right so i'm just copying the previous code here the only uh difference here is what just have to change the this one uh that outer loop for the number of lines i would be initialized with rows it should be in decreasing order right and i should be greater than equal to 1 here i minus minus right space lu would be same the condition would be rows minus i and for the printing the star we have same condition that is 2 into i minus 1 right now just let me just run this now say it is asking enter number of rows let me enter 5 and see the pattern now let me just run this for 10 number of rows 10 and see this is inverted full pyramid right so i hope you would have to print this pattern so i hope you got how to print this pattern now i'll see in the next video with a new pattern till then bye take care
