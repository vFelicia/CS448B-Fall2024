00:00 - hello hello hello how are you doing i
00:03 - hope you are all feeling
00:04 - wonderful in this tutorial we are going
00:08 - to see
00:08 - how to code the part two of the car
00:11 - racing game
00:12 - stick around welcome to kirikou ninja
00:15 - tutorial
00:16 - this is eddie and this is your place to
00:19 - learn to code and have fun
00:22 - all right let's see what we have
00:26 - so far so in the part one
00:29 - we created the backdrop
00:32 - and the thrice and some basic movements
00:37 - in this part we're gonna control the
00:39 - speed
00:41 - and enhance our game
00:44 - a little bit more so i click on my stuff
00:49 - on this i go back again so that you can
00:52 - see
00:52 - [Music]
00:55 - so if i click on this folder i can find
00:58 - my previous project
01:02 - which is formula one
01:06 - i'm going to say inside
01:10 - i'm not gonna continue on this
01:13 - but i'm gonna create a new project
01:17 - so that this one is remained intact for
01:21 - those that are watching the first video
01:25 - but what i can do is i go to backdrop
01:30 - i drag my car here
01:34 - as well as this okay
01:41 - backdrop i can drag it from here
01:44 - okay so i have both of these
01:48 - the car and the stage
01:51 - uh the backdrop so what i'm gonna do
01:54 - is again i go back to scratch
02:04 - i'm gonna create a new project now
02:10 - and i'm naming it
02:16 - formula one part two
02:22 - part two
02:25 - and the dash in between
02:30 - okay here we go i delete this
02:34 - and now if i click on this backpack i
02:37 - have my backdrop here
02:40 - and i have the car here so all i need is
02:44 - here and even the code came
02:48 - with it now let's create a variable
02:53 - and name it speed so i make a variable
02:57 - i name it speed
03:01 - okay and then
03:04 - set the initial value for it
03:08 - as let's say
03:12 - 2 so any
03:16 - positive number
03:20 - if i replace it here means moving
03:24 - to the right or like forward and then
03:27 - one is
03:28 - negative is backwards so later on we can
03:32 - remove those numbers and replace it with
03:35 - variable speed
03:40 - now instead of this thing
03:44 - i can remove this and i can say instead
03:49 - change
03:54 - change speed by
03:58 - one
04:01 - and the same for this one
04:09 - change speed by minus
04:12 - one and then we will write a general
04:15 - code
04:16 - for the movements let's write a code for
04:20 - the movements of the car because we
04:22 - deleted the
04:23 - previous one so i'm gonna say
04:27 - when fly clicked
04:32 - forever so from control
04:35 - taking forever
04:39 - now i'm gonna write the move here
04:42 - with the variable speed so first i'm
04:46 - bringing
04:46 - moved and speed but then i'm deleting it
04:50 - and replacing it
04:53 - with speed variable
04:57 - so now the car will move and by pressing
05:02 - left and right i'm controlling the speed
05:05 - so let's play
05:07 - if i play it right it's going to be
05:08 - super fast
05:10 - if i click on the left the value is
05:14 - going to be less and less
05:15 - when it becomes negative it moves
05:17 - backward so let's stop it for now
05:22 - also
05:25 - let's put a weight here
05:28 - because
05:31 - when we are holding the
05:35 - the button it would automatically
05:39 - wait so going to control
05:45 - and wait one second here
05:48 - and wait one second here so that
05:53 - the changes are not super quick and we
05:56 - can see
05:57 - what's going on so we have a bit more
06:00 - control here
06:06 - in order to make it easier to control
06:08 - the car
06:09 - we can write a piece of code so that
06:12 - when the car came
06:16 - to the grass the speed is less or
06:20 - it's zero or whatever we want so
06:23 - let's write
06:26 - when green flight clicked
06:31 - now let's write a sensing condition with
06:34 - sensing
06:36 - so i would say keep checking
06:40 - so forever keep checking this
06:46 - if
06:50 - touching the green color
07:05 - set the speed to
07:13 - we can say 0 if you want it to be
07:16 - completely stopped
07:17 - or let's say one so that it moves
07:20 - but slower so
07:24 - let's see how it works so let's say if i
07:27 - accidentally went to the grass
07:30 - now my speed is one so i have
07:33 - more control over the car to put it
07:37 - back to where i want it to go
07:40 - because it's not going super fast
07:50 - okay and also
07:57 - we could one more thing we can do
08:02 - is let's go to the car
08:05 - costume and duplicate it
08:12 - i want to make it look like is exploded
08:18 - not like this oh my god
08:24 - i can't even go back okay let's
08:27 - redo it duplicate
08:30 - and then let's change this color i'm
08:33 - gonna choose like something like a fire
08:36 - and then just
08:40 - do it like this so that make it look
08:43 - like the car
08:44 - is exploded
08:47 - so i can say for instance i can put
08:50 - some barriers or like some sprites
08:58 - let's say this
09:01 - color
09:06 - or yeah so
09:09 - let's say i want the car to explode
09:13 - when touching this you can of course
09:16 - play with the slice and put something
09:19 - more reasonable but i'm just showing the
09:21 - code
09:22 - just saying what other things you can do
09:24 - to enhance
09:25 - this game
09:28 - now i'm gonna say going back to the car
09:37 - so i'm gonna duplicate this block
09:41 - i'm putting it here
09:48 - oops
09:54 - okay this time i wanna say when touching
09:59 - this color
10:05 - in that time set the speed
10:09 - maybe to zero the car stopped
10:13 - and change the costume
10:17 - to
10:22 - next custom or
10:26 - let's check what is the name formula 2
10:31 - so
10:34 - switch custom to formula two so whatever
10:37 - i touch
10:37 - this i should see this
10:40 - let's go here here here
10:45 - keep going keep going rotate
10:48 - so i want to make it
10:57 - it's not even easy to touch this but
11:03 - i'm gonna deliberately bring this here
11:06 - so that i can demo so if my car
11:09 - is hitting this it's gonna explode and
11:13 - stopped so after this
11:16 - we can create a game over screen so
11:19 - there are a lot of other things
11:21 - you can do with this game
11:24 - you can put maybe some other items here
11:28 - so that the car if the car is touching
11:31 - those sprites can speed up
11:34 - you can also try to see how to
11:37 - counter the number of laps and then you
11:40 - can start to
11:41 - finish the game after like two laps
11:44 - three laughs
11:45 - or whatever you like so this is
11:49 - the base of the game the car can move
11:52 - you can control the speed you can rotate
11:56 - and from here you can go on and add as
11:59 - many
12:00 - features as you like to it
12:03 - and make sure to put in the comment
12:06 - what are the amazing things that you can
12:08 - do with this
12:10 - project i hope you liked this tutorial

12:18 - you won't
12:19 - miss the next tutorial see you soon bye
