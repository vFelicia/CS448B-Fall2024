00:02 - hello and welcome to part two
00:04 - of the habit tracking app
00:08 - tutorial in this part
00:11 - of the tutorial we are going to see how
00:13 - we can delete
00:15 - items from the list
00:18 - so in the previous tutorial we've
00:21 - created a
00:22 - habit list using the
00:25 - list variable from here on the left so i
00:30 - made a list i named it the habit list
00:32 - and i could add items to the list so
00:37 - here the cat is saying
00:38 - what should i do with the list and wait
00:41 - so if i
00:43 - answer to the question so here it says
00:45 - if the answer is
00:46 - add then do something so if i say add
00:50 - then it's saying what shall i add and
00:52 - then i can say
00:54 - maybe whatever habit that i want
00:59 - drink eight
01:02 - glasses of water
01:07 - and then i enter and then i see that the
01:10 - habit
01:10 - is added to my list now i want to be
01:14 - able to delete this
01:15 - as well so what happens
01:18 - is when i'm answering what should i do
01:22 - with the list and weight
01:24 - this answer should be
01:28 - a variable so that i can assign add
01:31 - delete or other things to it so i create
01:34 - a new variable
01:36 - so i go to the variables
01:42 - and then i
01:46 - say make a variable and i name it
01:49 - command because i want it to be used for
01:53 - add
01:53 - delete or any other command that i'm
01:56 - adding to my list so i say okay
02:02 - now that i have my command
02:05 - variable and i don't want it to be shown
02:08 - here
02:10 - so i can
02:13 - uncheck this so that is not visible
02:18 - and then i'm
02:22 - going to again to the variables
02:25 - and i set the command
02:30 - to answer so whatever was the answer of
02:33 - here
02:34 - answer ask what should i do with the
02:36 - list
02:40 - so whatever the answer came
02:44 - i drag it i assign it to the command
02:47 - variable so i set command to answer make
02:50 - sure not to type answer but
02:52 - drag the answer from sensing otherwise
02:54 - it won't work
02:57 - so i have the answer if it was at
03:00 - i'm doing these things and then here i'm
03:03 - gonna create
03:04 - another structure like this
03:07 - another block of code like this
03:11 - and this time i'm gonna say
03:16 - if
03:19 - so everything like the previous time but
03:23 - this time i'm gonna say if the answer
03:29 - i need to take the operator to
03:33 - compare it with something so this time i
03:36 - want to say if the answer is delete
03:40 - from the sensing i'm dragging the answer
03:45 - in this case i want to ask a question
03:49 - so i drag the ask block
03:54 - i say what
04:01 - uh what is
04:05 - the item
04:08 - [Music]
04:11 - what is the number
04:14 - of the item
04:18 - that you want to delete
04:23 - so you see those items in the list they
04:26 - have a number beside them
04:28 - so i'm going to add some more things
04:32 - it solid
04:41 - run every
04:45 - friday because actually
04:48 - what should i add so i should say add
04:52 - and then
04:55 - hate salad at night
05:01 - another ad
05:04 - run every friday
05:09 - and so on so you see every habit has a
05:11 - number beside it
05:13 - so i'm gonna ask what is the number of
05:16 - the items
05:17 - you're gonna delete so i go to the
05:20 - variables
05:22 - and you see here delete
05:25 - for instance one of my habit lists so i
05:28 - drag this and then whatever was the
05:32 - answer
05:33 - i replace it with this number so i don't
05:37 - want
05:38 - necessarily one but i want whatever is
05:40 - in the answer
05:43 - so delete answer of my habit list this
05:47 - sentence doesn't
05:48 - really grammatically correct but what it
05:51 - means
05:52 - is whatever is the answer of this
05:54 - question delete it from
05:56 - my habit list and the answer of this
05:59 - question is
06:00 - one of these numbers so
06:04 - let's give it a test
06:09 - what should i do with the list delete
06:12 - [Music]
06:14 - and
06:18 - why did it not work so the reason it
06:22 - it doesn't work is you see this if is
06:25 - inside
06:25 - the other if it shouldn't be like that
06:27 - so i drag this
06:28 - out and i make sure that is on the same
06:32 - level like just under if not inside if
06:36 - but still inside the forever so
06:39 - now it should work i stop and then i
06:42 - play
06:43 - again i run again
06:48 - give it a moment
06:53 - oh this one is that a part
06:56 - [Music]
06:58 - so what should i do with the list
07:01 - deletes
07:03 - which number of item listed number 2
07:07 - so i say 2 and 2 is not here
07:10 - anymore what if i want to delete
07:13 - all the items at once let's create
07:16 - another
07:17 - block of code to
07:20 - handle the delete all answer
07:23 - or the delete all commands basically
07:27 - so again i go to the control
07:32 - and if then and this time make sure that
07:34 - is
07:35 - under the if but not inside
07:41 - and just like last time
07:45 - if answer is
07:51 - you may pause the video and try to do it
07:53 - by yourself without looking at it this
07:55 - time and then
07:57 - start and try again
08:00 - and check it so if answer was
08:04 - delete all
08:09 - in that case let's go to the variable
08:12 - and see what we have
08:14 - under the list delete all of my habit
08:18 - list
08:27 - okay now let's start
08:32 - what should i do delete all
08:37 - and everything is gone
08:41 - if you liked the video don't forget to
08:43 - like subscribe and hit the bell so that
08:46 - you won't miss the next tutorial
08:48 - see you next week

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome to part two of the habit tracking app tutorial in this part of the tutorial we are going to see how we can delete items from the list so in the previous tutorial we've created a habit list using the list variable from here on the left so i made a list i named it the habit list and i could add items to the list so here the cat is saying what should i do with the list and wait so if i answer to the question so here it says if the answer is add then do something so if i say add then it's saying what shall i add and then i can say maybe whatever habit that i want drink eight glasses of water and then i enter and then i see that the habit is added to my list now i want to be able to delete this as well so what happens is when i'm answering what should i do with the list and weight this answer should be a variable so that i can assign add delete or other things to it so i create a new variable so i go to the variables and then i say make a variable and i name it command because i want it to be used for add delete or any other command that i'm adding to my list so i say okay now that i have my command variable and i don't want it to be shown here so i can uncheck this so that is not visible and then i'm going to again to the variables and i set the command to answer so whatever was the answer of here answer ask what should i do with the list so whatever the answer came i drag it i assign it to the command variable so i set command to answer make sure not to type answer but drag the answer from sensing otherwise it won't work so i have the answer if it was at i'm doing these things and then here i'm gonna create another structure like this another block of code like this and this time i'm gonna say if so everything like the previous time but this time i'm gonna say if the answer i need to take the operator to compare it with something so this time i want to say if the answer is delete from the sensing i'm dragging the answer in this case i want to ask a question so i drag the ask block i say what uh what is the item what is the number of the item that you want to delete so you see those items in the list they have a number beside them so i'm going to add some more things it solid run every friday because actually what should i add so i should say add and then hate salad at night another ad run every friday and so on so you see every habit has a number beside it so i'm gonna ask what is the number of the items you're gonna delete so i go to the variables and you see here delete for instance one of my habit lists so i drag this and then whatever was the answer i replace it with this number so i don't want necessarily one but i want whatever is in the answer so delete answer of my habit list this sentence doesn't really grammatically correct but what it means is whatever is the answer of this question delete it from my habit list and the answer of this question is one of these numbers so let's give it a test what should i do with the list delete and why did it not work so the reason it it doesn't work is you see this if is inside the other if it shouldn't be like that so i drag this out and i make sure that is on the same level like just under if not inside if but still inside the forever so now it should work i stop and then i play again i run again give it a moment oh this one is that a part so what should i do with the list deletes which number of item listed number 2 so i say 2 and 2 is not here anymore what if i want to delete all the items at once let's create another block of code to handle the delete all answer or the delete all commands basically so again i go to the control and if then and this time make sure that is under the if but not inside and just like last time if answer is you may pause the video and try to do it by yourself without looking at it this time and then start and try again and check it so if answer was delete all in that case let's go to the variable and see what we have under the list delete all of my habit list okay now let's start what should i do delete all and everything is gone if you liked the video don't forget to like subscribe and hit the bell so that you won't miss the next tutorial see you next week
