00:00 - hello hello how are you doing i hope you
00:03 - are all feeling wonderful
00:05 - in this tutorial we are going to learn
00:07 - about lists
00:09 - we can use lists when we have a group of
00:11 - values to store
00:13 - that are related but they're more than
00:15 - one
00:16 - like when listen to this song
00:32 - [Music]
00:56 - daddy
01:01 - [Music]
01:09 - [Applause]
01:11 - okay so this
01:14 - is a good example of
01:17 - when we can use lists why
01:20 - because if you look at this
01:23 - just is being repeated
01:27 - so here we have a group of variables
01:31 - baby shark mommy shark daddy sharp
01:34 - shark grandma shark and grandpa shark
01:37 - that are
01:38 - related but there are more than one and
01:41 - they're variables so
01:43 - these things are constant and this
01:46 - these ones are being changed so they are
01:49 - variable
01:51 - so this is a good example
01:54 - of when we can use lists so i'm gonna
01:58 - show you a project in scratch that
02:01 - you're gonna write
02:02 - a lyrics for this song and
02:06 - using lists stick around to do it
02:10 - together
02:13 - welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this
02:16 - is eddie and this is your place to learn
02:19 - to code and have fun okay
02:22 - to learn about the list we're gonna
02:25 - create something like this
02:28 - that has a shark
02:32 - family list so a list that is name is a
02:35 - shark family
02:36 - and then it gets the input from
02:39 - us and then as a lyric it will
02:43 - put it on the the sharks
02:47 - like it thinking um
02:51 - [Music]
02:55 - it says
03:04 - [Music]
03:15 - [Music]
03:16 - grandma shark shark
03:33 - [Music]
03:58 - so you got the idea we are creating a
04:00 - list and then we are putting
04:01 - a set of variables that are similar
04:06 - and there are more than one like a baby
04:08 - shark mommy shark daddy shark they're
04:10 - all sharks
04:11 - family of sharks and then we're gonna
04:14 - use it how are we gonna use it to
04:18 - recreate the lyrics on the thinking
04:21 - bubble of the shark
04:23 - so let's see how we can write it our
04:25 - goal is to learn to
04:27 - work with the list
04:37 - alright so let's
04:40 - give the project name
04:44 - i call it list and
04:50 - baby
04:51 - [Music]
04:53 - okay that's how i name it
04:57 - you can name it whatever you like and
05:00 - then let's delete this
05:04 - let's find a shark
05:11 - the good thing is already there is shark
05:13 - here i'm gonna choose this one
05:17 - and then also backdrop
05:22 - let's choose if i
05:25 - type c
05:29 - or
05:36 - um underwater let's go to underwater
05:40 - and i'm gonna take this one
05:45 - so here we go now let's create a list
05:49 - so if we go to the variables
05:52 - we have the option of make a list
05:56 - i'm going to name my list
06:01 - shark family
06:06 - so okay okay
06:10 - now i have an empty shark family list
06:14 - let's write a code that gets
06:17 - input from us so that we can add items
06:21 - to our list
06:23 - if you look at here
06:26 - there is a code at thing or like
06:30 - something to shrink family let's use
06:33 - this and write our code so like always
06:37 - we ah we need to trigger it by
06:42 - dragging the code when green flag
06:45 - is clicked so when
06:48 - flag is clicked then let's get back to
06:51 - the variables
06:53 - first thing i do is delete
06:57 - all of the shark family so that when i
07:00 - rerun my program i start with
07:03 - a fresh list
07:06 - and then we have like baby shark mama
07:10 - shark daddy shark papa shark
07:13 - grandpa sharks so something is going to
07:15 - be repeated
07:16 - five times so i go to the control
07:20 - and repeat five
07:28 - times
07:31 - and let's say this shark is asking
07:35 - who or like who do you want me to add to
07:38 - the list
07:40 - in order to do that i go to sensing
07:44 - and then
07:48 - what do we have here ask
07:52 - i'm dragging ask instead of this
07:58 - who shall i add
08:01 - or let's say
08:07 - which shark
08:11 - okay and let's get back to the variable
08:15 - and see what we have here on the
08:17 - under the list there is a cool feature
08:21 - at add thing to shark family
08:24 - so add instead of think
08:29 - think whatever is the answer of this
08:33 - question
08:33 - is going to be added to the shark family
08:36 - list
08:37 - so i go back to sensing
08:40 - and there is there should be answer here
08:45 - which is here so add answer
08:48 - to the shark family
08:54 - so this is for feeling the list
08:58 - so what happens is if i click here the
09:00 - shark is asking
09:02 - which shark i say baby
09:05 - shark when it asks again i say
09:09 - daddy shark grandpa shark and so on we
09:13 - can just
09:14 - feel fill the list like this
09:19 - so what i want to happen what i want to
09:22 - do is
09:23 - after the list is completed i
09:26 - want to broadcast a message so that
09:30 - the shark is singing back or writing
09:33 - back
09:34 - the lyrics so somehow i need to announce
09:37 - it
09:38 - so i'm going to the event
09:42 - and here i'm gonna use broadcast
09:46 - message
09:49 - let's create a new message
09:52 - uh i write
09:56 - say the lyric so that the shark
10:00 - when sees this knows that should say
10:03 - the lyric okay
10:08 - okay let's also add the music
10:12 - to our code so let's go to the sound
10:15 - i've already downloaded
10:17 - the song that i
10:20 - want to use the baby shark
10:24 - you can also go ahead and download it
10:27 - i've downloaded the codes
10:31 - so i'm going to upload it here
10:36 - i'm going to import it here
10:40 - also i want to make this smaller
10:44 - and reduce the parts that i do not need
10:47 - it
10:47 - so i'm
10:51 - [Music]
10:52 - deleting the extras
10:57 - so that i can start only from
11:00 - the part that i need
11:03 - so i listen to it to make sure that's
11:06 - what i want
11:07 - so i only want to take from baby shark
11:10 - to
11:10 - grandpa shark
11:13 - okay so i listened to the song and
11:17 - then i cut the parts that i do not need
11:20 - and keep the parts that are needed for
11:23 - my code you can do the same as well
11:26 - okay now that the song is there
11:29 - let's go to the code and i want it to
11:33 - be started as soon as i click
11:37 - on the green flag so
11:40 - when green flag clicked
11:43 - again to the sound star sound
11:50 - and star sound but play sound
11:54 - until done done
12:00 - okay let's get to the most exciting part
12:03 - of it which is
12:04 - filling the items to the list so
12:08 - i played this and i listen to what i
12:10 - hear
12:11 - and then when the shark asks the
12:13 - question i answered
12:18 - the baby
12:24 - [Music]
12:36 - daddy
12:42 - [Music]
12:45 - grab my shirt
12:55 - [Music]
12:57 - okay now we have a list full of the
13:00 - items that we
13:02 - want them the next is
13:05 - we want the music to be played again and
13:08 - this time we are
13:10 - using the items in the list so that
13:13 - a cloud comes at the top of the shark's
13:16 - head and
13:17 - saying the lyrics of the song while you
13:20 - are doing nothing
13:22 - while you are sitting and watching it so
13:24 - let's see how we can write the code for
13:27 - this so remember here we use broadcast
13:31 - say the lyrics i'm gonna use it
13:35 - in the events when
13:38 - i receive say the lyrics
13:42 - i'm gonna stop all the sounds so that
13:45 - this
13:45 - song is gonna start
13:49 - again and then i'm gonna start it again
13:53 - start the sound
13:57 - then what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna
14:01 - loop around the list so i'm going to
14:06 - point to this and this and this and this
14:08 - and this
14:10 - and use it
14:14 - as a thinking message so let's see what
14:17 - i'm saying
14:18 - i'm going to control and i'm going to
14:22 - repeat
14:24 - several times later on we can change it
14:27 - let's say five times because we have
14:29 - five items here
14:31 - five times i wanna think
14:36 - so not me but the shark is gonna
14:39 - think about
14:42 - anything that is written here
14:48 - i don't want to manually write baby
14:50 - shark i want to use
14:52 - my list that's why we have created the
14:54 - list so
14:57 - if you look at the list
15:00 - here we can say think
15:04 - about item one of shark
15:10 - family
15:13 - i'm gonna repeat five times think item
15:16 - number one
15:17 - and then item number two
15:20 - and so on of the list so if i click on
15:24 - this
15:25 - i would see baby shy here i want to see
15:29 - the same thing for item 2
15:30 - 3 4 5 and so on but i don't want to
15:33 - repeat it i'm going to use a counter
15:36 - so let's create a variable
15:40 - make a variable name it
15:44 - counter okay
15:49 - and then set the counter to
15:55 - 1
16:00 - i'm gonna also set the counter to one at
16:03 - the beginning
16:04 - of the program as well so that when i'm
16:07 - finished
16:09 - it's reset again so
16:12 - i set the counter to one
16:16 - and i think item instead of one
16:21 - i would use a counter
16:25 - and then
16:29 - so five times think item one
16:33 - item two item three item five for
16:36 - two seconds and then
16:39 - change counter by one so
16:44 - here on the variable change counter by
16:48 - one i want to also
16:51 - think about the fixed part of the
16:54 - song the lyric so i would
16:58 - also think
17:02 - dude
17:08 - one more okay
17:11 - let's also add a bit of cosmetic to it
17:14 - so let's
17:15 - use multiple costumes so that the shark
17:18 - doesn't look the same all the time
17:22 - so like this next costume
17:26 - so i think go to next costume
17:30 - we can also change the color effect a
17:33 - little bit
17:34 - so that it looks like the
17:37 - the shark color would be changed
17:40 - slowly slowly
17:44 - like this instead of repeat 5
17:48 - which is length of the array
17:52 - there is something really cool here
17:55 - which is length of charge family so i
17:59 - didn't need to count
18:00 - five i could just take
18:03 - repeat this as long as there is
18:07 - something
18:08 - in the list length of shy
18:11 - family like this
18:15 - now let's run it and see what we did
18:21 - [Music]
18:26 - okay
18:32 - [Music]
18:40 - daddy
18:41 - [Music]
18:48 - [Music]
18:53 - now look at here
19:02 - [Music]
19:08 - so the lyrics are showing here so our
19:10 - code is working
19:12 - pretty good but the timing doesn't match
19:15 - which you can play with this
19:18 - times and put a bit more delays in
19:22 - between
19:23 - so that you can figure out how to
19:26 - match it i hope you liked this video and
19:30 - you learned
19:31 - something lists are very very useful
19:34 - in programming you can do a lot of
19:36 - things with it
19:38 - this was just one example but
19:41 - if you learn this you can do a lot of
19:43 - things with the list
19:45 - if you like the video don't forget to
19:46 - press like
19:48 - subscribe and hit the bell and share it
19:50 - with your friends
19:52 - so that other smart people like yourself
19:55 - would
19:56 - learn something see you next week
20:00 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello hello how are you doing i hope you are all feeling wonderful in this tutorial we are going to learn about lists we can use lists when we have a group of values to store that are related but they're more than one like when listen to this song daddy okay so this is a good example of when we can use lists why because if you look at this just is being repeated so here we have a group of variables baby shark mommy shark daddy sharp shark grandma shark and grandpa shark that are related but there are more than one and they're variables so these things are constant and this these ones are being changed so they are variable so this is a good example of when we can use lists so i'm gonna show you a project in scratch that you're gonna write a lyrics for this song and using lists stick around to do it together welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun okay to learn about the list we're gonna create something like this that has a shark family list so a list that is name is a shark family and then it gets the input from us and then as a lyric it will put it on the the sharks like it thinking um it says grandma shark shark so you got the idea we are creating a list and then we are putting a set of variables that are similar and there are more than one like a baby shark mommy shark daddy shark they're all sharks family of sharks and then we're gonna use it how are we gonna use it to recreate the lyrics on the thinking bubble of the shark so let's see how we can write it our goal is to learn to work with the list alright so let's give the project name i call it list and baby okay that's how i name it you can name it whatever you like and then let's delete this let's find a shark the good thing is already there is shark here i'm gonna choose this one and then also backdrop let's choose if i type c or um underwater let's go to underwater and i'm gonna take this one so here we go now let's create a list so if we go to the variables we have the option of make a list i'm going to name my list shark family so okay okay now i have an empty shark family list let's write a code that gets input from us so that we can add items to our list if you look at here there is a code at thing or like something to shrink family let's use this and write our code so like always we ah we need to trigger it by dragging the code when green flag is clicked so when flag is clicked then let's get back to the variables first thing i do is delete all of the shark family so that when i rerun my program i start with a fresh list and then we have like baby shark mama shark daddy shark papa shark grandpa sharks so something is going to be repeated five times so i go to the control and repeat five times and let's say this shark is asking who or like who do you want me to add to the list in order to do that i go to sensing and then what do we have here ask i'm dragging ask instead of this who shall i add or let's say which shark okay and let's get back to the variable and see what we have here on the under the list there is a cool feature at add thing to shark family so add instead of think think whatever is the answer of this question is going to be added to the shark family list so i go back to sensing and there is there should be answer here which is here so add answer to the shark family so this is for feeling the list so what happens is if i click here the shark is asking which shark i say baby shark when it asks again i say daddy shark grandpa shark and so on we can just feel fill the list like this so what i want to happen what i want to do is after the list is completed i want to broadcast a message so that the shark is singing back or writing back the lyrics so somehow i need to announce it so i'm going to the event and here i'm gonna use broadcast message let's create a new message uh i write say the lyric so that the shark when sees this knows that should say the lyric okay okay let's also add the music to our code so let's go to the sound i've already downloaded the song that i want to use the baby shark you can also go ahead and download it i've downloaded the codes so i'm going to upload it here i'm going to import it here also i want to make this smaller and reduce the parts that i do not need it so i'm deleting the extras so that i can start only from the part that i need so i listen to it to make sure that's what i want so i only want to take from baby shark to grandpa shark okay so i listened to the song and then i cut the parts that i do not need and keep the parts that are needed for my code you can do the same as well okay now that the song is there let's go to the code and i want it to be started as soon as i click on the green flag so when green flag clicked again to the sound star sound and star sound but play sound until done done okay let's get to the most exciting part of it which is filling the items to the list so i played this and i listen to what i hear and then when the shark asks the question i answered the baby daddy grab my shirt okay now we have a list full of the items that we want them the next is we want the music to be played again and this time we are using the items in the list so that a cloud comes at the top of the shark's head and saying the lyrics of the song while you are doing nothing while you are sitting and watching it so let's see how we can write the code for this so remember here we use broadcast say the lyrics i'm gonna use it in the events when i receive say the lyrics i'm gonna stop all the sounds so that this song is gonna start again and then i'm gonna start it again start the sound then what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna loop around the list so i'm going to point to this and this and this and this and this and use it as a thinking message so let's see what i'm saying i'm going to control and i'm going to repeat several times later on we can change it let's say five times because we have five items here five times i wanna think so not me but the shark is gonna think about anything that is written here i don't want to manually write baby shark i want to use my list that's why we have created the list so if you look at the list here we can say think about item one of shark family i'm gonna repeat five times think item number one and then item number two and so on of the list so if i click on this i would see baby shy here i want to see the same thing for item 2 3 4 5 and so on but i don't want to repeat it i'm going to use a counter so let's create a variable make a variable name it counter okay and then set the counter to 1 i'm gonna also set the counter to one at the beginning of the program as well so that when i'm finished it's reset again so i set the counter to one and i think item instead of one i would use a counter and then so five times think item one item two item three item five for two seconds and then change counter by one so here on the variable change counter by one i want to also think about the fixed part of the song the lyric so i would also think dude one more okay let's also add a bit of cosmetic to it so let's use multiple costumes so that the shark doesn't look the same all the time so like this next costume so i think go to next costume we can also change the color effect a little bit so that it looks like the the shark color would be changed slowly slowly like this instead of repeat 5 which is length of the array there is something really cool here which is length of charge family so i didn't need to count five i could just take repeat this as long as there is something in the list length of shy family like this now let's run it and see what we did okay daddy now look at here so the lyrics are showing here so our code is working pretty good but the timing doesn't match which you can play with this times and put a bit more delays in between so that you can figure out how to match it i hope
