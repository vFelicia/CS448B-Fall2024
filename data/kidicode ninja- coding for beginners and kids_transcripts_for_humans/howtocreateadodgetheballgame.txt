00:00 - hi hi hi how are you doing i hope you
00:03 - are all feeling
00:04 - wonderful in this tutorial we are going
00:07 - to learn
00:08 - how to create a touch the ball
00:11 - game this is ellie and this
00:15 - is your place where to go and have fun
00:17 - so let's see a demo of the game
00:20 - first so i click on the green flag and i
00:23 - have 20 live zero score so i need to
00:26 - gain as much score as i can by avoiding
00:29 - the balls and
00:30 - not touch the ball so that i won't lose
00:32 - any game let's go to the left
00:34 - go to the right i lost
00:37 - nine lines
00:40 - and one line and game over
00:45 - let's create a new project
00:48 - and let's
00:52 - name our project
00:56 - dodge the bowl and
01:00 - this time let's keep the straw let's
01:03 - keep this right
01:05 - and choose a backdrop
01:09 - i'm gonna choose
01:12 - a very simple backdrop
01:16 - like like what
01:23 - maybe just this one
01:27 - and then
01:32 - let's go to the back drops
01:36 - create a second one and name the
01:40 - second one game over
01:43 - for our game over screen and let's
01:47 - type
01:51 - game over with red color on it
01:55 - okay over just make it a little bit
01:59 - bigger
02:07 - like this
02:12 - over and
02:15 - [Music]
02:17 - i don't want this one anymore so blue
02:20 - sky
02:21 - and game okay and also
02:26 - does the ball so we need both
02:29 - let's search for a ball
02:33 - it's right here plus one or this one
02:36 - let's take this one so i have a ball
02:43 - now let's write the code so
02:46 - to start
02:49 - let's program the move of the cat
02:53 - to the right and to the left also let's
02:55 - make it a little bit
02:57 - smaller 50
03:02 - the smaller it is is less challenging
03:05 - to not hit the ball to avoid the ball
03:10 - so like always
03:14 - so for the movement to the right and
03:17 - left
03:19 - there are two ways we can do it
03:23 - we can either say
03:30 - when right
03:33 - arrow and left arrow clicked
03:36 - then move several steps to the right
03:40 - and left like this
03:44 - so right now i can move to the right by
03:48 - right arrow but the performance is not
03:51 - gonna be
03:52 - great so instead to make it better
03:56 - i would say
04:00 - when start clicked
04:07 - forever
04:12 - if
04:16 - so i'm going to take the
04:19 - if condition which is on the control
04:25 - and then on the sensing if
04:29 - key right arrow
04:33 - pressed now here
04:37 - i say move
04:41 - 10 steps so these two
04:44 - codes do the same thing but
04:48 - the cat reacts faster to this one
04:51 - because it's forever
04:53 - checking this condition but this one is
04:56 - gonna be a bit
04:58 - sluggish so i'm gonna through this
05:01 - way and i'm gonna keep this one only
05:05 - let's write the same thing for the left
05:08 - arrow so that the cat
05:09 - can move to the right to the left as
05:12 - well
05:13 - so i'm gonna duplicate this
05:16 - and i'm putting it here
05:20 - and then i just change this one to
05:22 - [Music]
05:23 - and instead of 10 steps i would say
05:26 - minus
05:27 - 10 steps
05:30 - so i can move left and i can move
05:38 - wrong here
05:41 - uh i don't need that forever
05:45 - again so i can move
05:49 - right let's start again i can move right
05:52 - and i can move left
05:55 - oh come on it should be here
05:59 - so again i can move right and i can move
06:03 - left so make sure that you have forever
06:06 - and then
06:06 - inside you have one if and another if
06:11 - so we're good so far for the movement of
06:14 - the cat
06:15 - there is one issue if you look at the
06:17 - cat the cat is
06:18 - not working but it's gliding which is
06:21 - not what we want
06:23 - so to make it look like is actually
06:26 - working
06:29 - let's say let's use the costumes
06:33 - so switch costume to
06:38 - next so i would say
06:42 - move 10 steps and next
06:47 - and the same here let's give it a try
06:51 - now it's actually working
06:56 - cool so far now let's
06:59 - program the bulb so for the ball
07:02 - let's click on the ball and
07:06 - let's move it all the way up
07:09 - so when i move it all the way up
07:12 - my y position
07:16 - which showed this location so this 1
07:19 - 5 8 is exactly
07:23 - where my y is so here and here
07:26 - this ones are the same so initially i
07:29 - want the ball
07:31 - to start from the top
07:35 - and any x in this line so
07:39 - how would i write it is when
07:42 - green flag clicked
07:46 - what i want is on the motions
07:51 - i wanted to go to
07:56 - um y five
08:00 - one five nine but i don't want the x to
08:03 - be always minus
08:04 - thirty i want it to start from any
08:07 - random location
08:08 - at the top so i go
08:12 - to operator and i
08:15 - say there is
08:18 - one random peak random between
08:24 - not one to ten so somewhere between here
08:29 - which is minus two two three
08:32 - minus two two three and
08:35 - here which is
08:41 - plus 2 to 3. so i start from here
08:47 - and then i come down
08:50 - so forever
08:55 - i want to choose a motion
09:00 - change y by
09:05 - not 10 but -10 so that it comes down
09:09 - so the bigger this number
09:14 - uh it is like the positive of it
09:18 - it's gonna come faster so if it's minus
09:22 - 10 is like this it is let's say
09:26 - minus 30 it's gonna come super
09:30 - fast let's keep it for as
09:33 - minus 10 so we can increase this
09:37 - side if we want it if we want our gain
09:40 - to be even
09:41 - more challenging so this
09:45 - is this so far
09:48 - so now the ball is coming down but when
09:51 - it reaches here
09:53 - it doesn't do anything else so i want it
09:56 - to go back
09:57 - at the top again and come down and up
09:59 - and down and
10:00 - up and down so i write a piece of code
10:05 - so that when it's reached here so if
10:12 - my y position
10:15 - let's go to motions and
10:19 - if my y position
10:22 - let's take the operator as well
10:26 - is equal to
10:29 - not 50 but when i'm in this location the
10:32 - y
10:33 - is minus 187
10:38 - when it's here i want it to go back to
10:40 - the top
10:41 - so exactly like when it just started so
10:44 - all i'm gonna do is duplicate this
10:47 - whole thing and then remove this part
10:50 - and put this one back again
10:54 - so when you get here go back to the top
10:57 - again and
11:00 - start the loop so
11:04 - that's how we do it so let's play the
11:07 - game a little bit
11:08 - i can go left and right
11:12 - so two things we should do is
11:15 - one is the counting the um
11:19 - counting the scores or like some
11:22 - criteria for
11:23 - finishing the game and gaining points
11:27 - also one more thing let's have more
11:30 - balls
11:31 - which i can do it simply
11:35 - by duplicating and duplicating so the
11:38 - more balls
11:38 - more challenging
11:42 - like this now
11:45 - i want to have two variables one for
11:50 - measuring when the cat is losing
11:54 - and one for gaining the scores
11:58 - so i'm going to variables let's start
12:01 - stop this
12:03 - i'm making one variable live
12:07 - lives so the number of lives
12:11 - that the cat has so after the cat loses
12:14 - all the lives the game is game over
12:17 - and i keep it for for all sprites
12:20 - and one more variable that i named it
12:24 - score so how does it work is
12:28 - lives is like we can say at the
12:31 - beginning the cat has
12:32 - 10 lives 20 lives depending on how easy
12:36 - or difficult you want it
12:39 - you decide for the number and for the
12:42 - scores
12:43 - whenever the ball reaches the floor
12:47 - and the cat is avoiding it
12:51 - we can increase the scores so these two
12:54 - variables
12:56 - usually when we have variables we need
12:59 - to
12:59 - initialize it which means set the
13:02 - initial
13:03 - value for it that likes to
13:06 - something and score to something so
13:09 - when we just started there is no score
13:12 - but we need to have some
13:14 - number of lives and we lose
13:17 - when or like we die or we lose when we
13:20 - lost
13:21 - when we lose all of our lives
13:24 - so let's say 10.
13:27 - now let's
13:31 - write a code for increasing scores
13:34 - when the ball reaches the floor
13:38 - how do i write it here
13:42 - i've already written a condition
13:45 - for reaching the y to the floor
13:49 - so here i can increase the score so if y
13:53 - position is anything like if there's
13:56 - this number or anything
13:59 - less than this number
14:03 - change scores
14:08 - by 1 by 2 by whatever you want
14:14 - so whatever the balls are coming down
14:16 - the score is going
14:18 - up and up and up and also
14:22 - whenever the cat is touching the balls
14:25 - the cat should lose a life so less write
14:29 - one more condition
14:32 - so make sure we are on the ball
14:36 - for now i'm gonna remove the extra balls
14:38 - so that i
14:40 - i duplicate it when all the codes are
14:42 - updated
14:44 - so let's write one more
14:47 - if condition i
14:51 - control if then
14:55 - one operator not
14:58 - operator let's go to the sensing and
15:00 - let's
15:01 - write if touching sprite which means if
15:05 - the ball
15:06 - touches the sprite i'm gonna lose
15:09 - one live which is
15:13 - change lives
15:16 - change the variable lines by minus
15:20 - one let's give it a try so i start by
15:23 - ten
15:24 - live zero score whenever the ball is
15:26 - touching the floor the score is going
15:28 - up and any time
15:32 - oh the scratch is too high i need to
15:35 - change that as well
15:38 - so anytime it touches i'm losing one
15:41 - life okay so all the lives
15:46 - are gone but i never wrote any code for
15:49 - finishing the game so now we have two
15:51 - things
15:52 - left two more things left we need to
15:55 - initialize the cat to start
15:58 - from here and also
16:04 - some way to finish the game let's see
16:07 - okay
16:08 - so let's set the initial location for
16:11 - the cat
16:12 - so that you're assured that it's in a
16:14 - good position
16:15 - maybe let's say here so
16:19 - i drag this code here
16:22 - and then let's write our game over
16:25 - cut so if you remember on the backdrop
16:29 - we had two backdrops one the simple
16:33 - one for the in
16:36 - for the game over so let's go to the
16:39 - code of backdrop
16:41 - and always i know i'm on the backdrop
16:44 - when i don't see
16:45 - the motions so let's write it
16:49 - like this when
16:52 - green flag clicked
16:58 - initially i want to be on the simple
17:01 - backdrop
17:02 - so let's go to the looks and switch back
17:05 - drop
17:06 - to blue sky so be here first
17:12 - and stay here until the lives
17:16 - are zero so from the controls
17:21 - wait until
17:27 - operator
17:30 - something equal to zero and that
17:34 - something is lives
17:39 - and then when the life became zero
17:44 - then we're gonna switch the backdrop to
17:47 - game over
17:51 - backdrop
17:56 - to the game over backdrop
18:01 - and then
18:05 - everything is gonna stop so
18:08 - control and stop all
18:13 - let's play i have 10 lines
18:17 - i lost most of them except two and now
18:20 - i'm game over
18:21 - let's add one little cosmetic
18:25 - which is a sound that we want to hear
18:27 - when you're game over
18:28 - so let's go to the sound i don't want to
18:32 - play sound pop
18:34 - so i again go to the sound
18:38 - i search for
18:42 - lose and i
18:45 - add this here and now in the code i can
18:49 - see play sound lose
18:52 - until done and then stop so let's test
18:56 - it two lines
19:02 - now to make our game a bit more
19:04 - challenging
19:05 - and fun let's duplicate a bit
19:09 - more balls and go to the right
19:15 - i hope you liked this video if you did
19:18 - don't forget to press
19:19 - like subscribe and hit the bell so that
19:22 - you won't miss
19:23 - the next tutorial and see you soon bye

Cleaned transcript:

hi hi hi how are you doing i hope you are all feeling wonderful in this tutorial we are going to learn how to create a touch the ball game this is ellie and this is your place where to go and have fun so let's see a demo of the game first so i click on the green flag and i have 20 live zero score so i need to gain as much score as i can by avoiding the balls and not touch the ball so that i won't lose any game let's go to the left go to the right i lost nine lines and one line and game over let's create a new project and let's name our project dodge the bowl and this time let's keep the straw let's keep this right and choose a backdrop i'm gonna choose a very simple backdrop like like what maybe just this one and then let's go to the back drops create a second one and name the second one game over for our game over screen and let's type game over with red color on it okay over just make it a little bit bigger like this over and i don't want this one anymore so blue sky and game okay and also does the ball so we need both let's search for a ball it's right here plus one or this one let's take this one so i have a ball now let's write the code so to start let's program the move of the cat to the right and to the left also let's make it a little bit smaller 50 the smaller it is is less challenging to not hit the ball to avoid the ball so like always so for the movement to the right and left there are two ways we can do it we can either say when right arrow and left arrow clicked then move several steps to the right and left like this so right now i can move to the right by right arrow but the performance is not gonna be great so instead to make it better i would say when start clicked forever if so i'm going to take the if condition which is on the control and then on the sensing if key right arrow pressed now here i say move 10 steps so these two codes do the same thing but the cat reacts faster to this one because it's forever checking this condition but this one is gonna be a bit sluggish so i'm gonna through this way and i'm gonna keep this one only let's write the same thing for the left arrow so that the cat can move to the right to the left as well so i'm gonna duplicate this and i'm putting it here and then i just change this one to and instead of 10 steps i would say minus 10 steps so i can move left and i can move wrong here uh i don't need that forever again so i can move right let's start again i can move right and i can move left oh come on it should be here so again i can move right and i can move left so make sure that you have forever and then inside you have one if and another if so we're good so far for the movement of the cat there is one issue if you look at the cat the cat is not working but it's gliding which is not what we want so to make it look like is actually working let's say let's use the costumes so switch costume to next so i would say move 10 steps and next and the same here let's give it a try now it's actually working cool so far now let's program the bulb so for the ball let's click on the ball and let's move it all the way up so when i move it all the way up my y position which showed this location so this 1 5 8 is exactly where my y is so here and here this ones are the same so initially i want the ball to start from the top and any x in this line so how would i write it is when green flag clicked what i want is on the motions i wanted to go to um y five one five nine but i don't want the x to be always minus thirty i want it to start from any random location at the top so i go to operator and i say there is one random peak random between not one to ten so somewhere between here which is minus two two three minus two two three and here which is plus 2 to 3. so i start from here and then i come down so forever i want to choose a motion change y by not 10 but 10 so that it comes down so the bigger this number uh it is like the positive of it it's gonna come faster so if it's minus 10 is like this it is let's say minus 30 it's gonna come super fast let's keep it for as minus 10 so we can increase this side if we want it if we want our gain to be even more challenging so this is this so far so now the ball is coming down but when it reaches here it doesn't do anything else so i want it to go back at the top again and come down and up and down and up and down so i write a piece of code so that when it's reached here so if my y position let's go to motions and if my y position let's take the operator as well is equal to not 50 but when i'm in this location the y is minus 187 when it's here i want it to go back to the top so exactly like when it just started so all i'm gonna do is duplicate this whole thing and then remove this part and put this one back again so when you get here go back to the top again and start the loop so that's how we do it so let's play the game a little bit i can go left and right so two things we should do is one is the counting the um counting the scores or like some criteria for finishing the game and gaining points also one more thing let's have more balls which i can do it simply by duplicating and duplicating so the more balls more challenging like this now i want to have two variables one for measuring when the cat is losing and one for gaining the scores so i'm going to variables let's start stop this i'm making one variable live lives so the number of lives that the cat has so after the cat loses all the lives the game is game over and i keep it for for all sprites and one more variable that i named it score so how does it work is lives is like we can say at the beginning the cat has 10 lives 20 lives depending on how easy or difficult you want it you decide for the number and for the scores whenever the ball reaches the floor and the cat is avoiding it we can increase the scores so these two variables usually when we have variables we need to initialize it which means set the initial value for it that likes to something and score to something so when we just started there is no score but we need to have some number of lives and we lose when or like we die or we lose when we lost when we lose all of our lives so let's say 10. now let's write a code for increasing scores when the ball reaches the floor how do i write it here i've already written a condition for reaching the y to the floor so here i can increase the score so if y position is anything like if there's this number or anything less than this number change scores by 1 by 2 by whatever you want so whatever the balls are coming down the score is going up and up and up and also whenever the cat is touching the balls the cat should lose a life so less write one more condition so make sure we are on the ball for now i'm gonna remove the extra balls so that i i duplicate it when all the codes are updated so let's write one more if condition i control if then one operator not operator let's go to the sensing and let's write if touching sprite which means if the ball touches the sprite i'm gonna lose one live which is change lives change the variable lines by minus one let's give it a try so i start by ten live zero score whenever the ball is touching the floor the score is going up and any time oh the scratch is too high i need to change that as well so anytime it touches i'm losing one life okay so all the lives are gone but i never wrote any code for finishing the game so now we have two things left two more things left we need to initialize the cat to start from here and also some way to finish the game let's see okay so let's set the initial location for the cat so that you're assured that it's in a good position maybe let's say here so i drag this code here and then let's write our game over cut so if you remember on the backdrop we had two backdrops one the simple one for the in for the game over so let's go to the code of backdrop and always i know i'm on the backdrop when i don't see the motions so let's write it like this when green flag clicked initially i want to be on the simple backdrop so let's go to the looks and switch back drop to blue sky so be here first and stay here until the lives are zero so from the controls wait until operator something equal to zero and that something is lives and then when the life became zero then we're gonna switch the backdrop to game over backdrop to the game over backdrop and then everything is gonna stop so control and stop all let's play i have 10 lines i lost most of them except two and now i'm game over let's add one little cosmetic which is a sound that we want to hear when you're game over so let's go to the sound i don't want to play sound pop so i again go to the sound i search for lose and i add this here and now in the code i can see play sound lose until done and then stop so let's test it two lines now to make our game a bit more challenging and fun let's duplicate a bit more balls and go to the right i hope you liked this video if you did don't forget to press like subscribe and hit the bell so that you won't miss the next tutorial and see you soon bye
