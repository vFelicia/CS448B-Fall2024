00:00 - hello friends we are getting closer to
00:03 - the end of the 2020 and new year
00:06 - is about to arrive what i love most
00:08 - about the new year celebrations
00:10 - is the fireworks if you two like me
00:15 - love fireworks join me in this tutorial
00:18 - to see how we can create our own
00:21 - virtual firework in scratch
00:24 - let's dive in welcome to cuticle ninja
00:27 - tutorials
00:28 - this is eddie and this is your place to
00:31 - learn to code and have fun
00:48 - all right let's go to the
00:51 - scratch.mit.edu
00:55 - so that we can create a new project
00:59 - and then we click on the create on the
01:02 - left top corner
01:06 - and here we are when the project was
01:09 - opened
01:10 - we are going to create a firework
01:13 - for that we need a timer so we count
01:17 - using a timer we count down from
01:20 - let's say 10 to zero
01:24 - and then we shoot the fireworks
01:28 - so let's delete this cat
01:33 - so first thing we need a timer
01:36 - we go under click on the variables
01:45 - which is here
01:49 - and then i create i click on make a
01:52 - variable i name my variable
01:56 - timer
02:01 - also let's not forget to give our
02:02 - project a proper name
02:05 - which is firework
02:09 - fire break 20
02:13 - 21 okay
02:16 - now we have our timer
02:20 - i'm gonna set the start of the timer
02:24 - from
02:24 - by clicking on the variable so
02:28 - set timer to
02:32 - let's assume we're gonna count down from
02:36 - three so i set it to
02:41 - three and then
02:46 - change my variable by
02:50 - -1 and i want to wait
02:54 - one second between each count so
02:59 - on the control wait one second
03:04 - so set three wait one second
03:07 - change by minus one and i want it to be
03:10 - repeated
03:10 - over and over again so
03:14 - i change it to the large
03:18 - start so three
03:22 - we need to make sure that we have
03:24 - changed this to timer so i test it again
03:28 - now it's counting properly but the
03:31 - problem is
03:32 - it's gonna go below zero
03:35 - that's not what we want we want it to
03:37 - count until zero
03:38 - and then we wanna shoot the fireworks so
03:42 - what i'm gonna do is i put an if
03:45 - condition here
03:48 - so right after the change by -1
03:52 - i'm gonna say if
03:56 - timer is equal
04:00 - is equal zero
04:03 - so i'm dragging this timer here if timer
04:06 - is zero
04:08 - in that case first thing is
04:12 - that i don't want to count down anymore
04:16 - first thing is i don't want to see this
04:19 - numbers anymore instead i want to see
04:21 - the firework
04:23 - so i'm going to hide this so under the
04:26 - variable
04:27 - we have the option of hiding
04:30 - the variable of choice so i drag this
04:33 - and i change it to
04:35 - timer so i hide this
04:38 - and also
04:43 - i want to broadcast the message of
04:46 - starting fireworks so i'm going to
04:48 - events
04:51 - and i say broadcast
04:55 - a new message and my new messages
04:58 - start firework
05:04 - so i'm dragging it here
05:09 - what else i want is i want to play the
05:13 - sound here so that when the countdown is
05:15 - finished the
05:16 - crowd is cheering and the firework is
05:19 - going to be started
05:21 - so i go to the sound and the sound
05:25 - and then i search
05:28 - for
05:31 - i know that there is the sound of cheer
05:35 - already in the scratch library
05:40 - so i choose this
05:45 - and then here star stand
05:48 - cheer until done i drag it here
05:55 - and since i don't want to
05:58 - count down anymore when i get to zero
06:02 - it goes in the control and i drag
06:08 - stop this script so
06:12 - i want this script to be stopped
06:16 - let's run and see what's happening so
06:18 - i'm counting down until
06:20 - zero and i don't see this anymore i hear
06:23 - the cheers
06:25 - and one thing is i broadcasted the start
06:28 - firework
06:28 - so another sprite
06:32 - is going to receive this broadcast
06:36 - message
06:36 - and react to it
06:41 - let's also choose a backdrop
06:45 - so i go here and then i click on choose
06:49 - a backdrop
06:51 - and i obviously need a night because
06:54 - it's about the firework which is in the
06:57 - midnight so i choose the stars
07:02 - this is my desired backdrop
07:06 - now let's also
07:11 - create the firework by choosing the
07:14 - firework
07:17 - sprite so i've already downloaded
07:21 - a filework png image with
07:24 - transparent background so i go to upload
07:28 - the sprite
07:31 - and i choose this so when you are
07:34 - searching for the image make sure you
07:36 - are searching
07:37 - free image png firework
07:42 - so when you choose a png image
07:45 - it's giving you the image with
07:48 - transparent background so there is no
07:50 - background and it looks like the
07:51 - background is the backdrop of
07:54 - my code here all right
07:57 - initially when i click the start
08:01 - i have some expectations here so i go to
08:04 - the events and
08:05 - i drag when start clicked
08:09 - first thing i want to make sure that i'm
08:11 - on the
08:12 - star background so backdrop
08:16 - so from the looks i would say
08:20 - show or like switch back to up to
08:24 - stars and i want to make sure that this
08:27 - is initially hidden so
08:31 - i'm going to hide this as well
08:35 - so this is for when start click
08:38 - i also had a broadcast message
08:41 - so i go here and then
08:46 - when i receive the broadcasted message
08:48 - which
08:49 - is which is start firework
08:54 - i'm gonna do a set of things
08:57 - all right so when i receive the
08:59 - broadcast
09:01 - um i'm gonna start from heart so
09:04 - initially the fireworks should be hidden
09:09 - and then i i need to wait a bit
09:13 - let's say a second
09:16 - wait one second or maybe half a second
09:23 - and then now
09:26 - height
09:29 - now show and i want it to happen
09:32 - repeatedly
09:35 - so i go to the control
09:40 - i can do forever if i want it to go on
09:42 - and on forever but i want to have a
09:44 - limited amount of time so that i can
09:46 - count it and after a day
09:48 - firework is over i want to say the happy
09:52 - new year message so i choose repeat
09:55 - 10 times height weight
09:58 - show so let's pick a start
10:07 - um so the countdown didn't appear
10:11 - let's go back to the backdrop and
10:15 - see what needs to be fixed
10:18 - okay so when the start clicked we need
10:21 - to make sure that the
10:23 - countdown variable is shown so
10:27 - show variable
10:31 - timer i test it again so now i see a
10:35 - countdown three times
10:38 - and then the firework is gone now
10:41 - we have the basic code but let's enhance
10:45 - it a bit
10:46 - to make this wire more natural we don't
10:49 - want
10:50 - every time that i'm shooting the fire
10:52 - the same
10:54 - position and the same size and color of
10:56 - the fire
10:57 - appears so what i can do is
11:01 - first from the motions
11:08 - i drag the code go to random position so
11:12 - before i show
11:18 - i go to random position and then
11:22 - i can also set the random size
11:25 - so i go to the looks
11:28 - and then i choose set size
11:33 - to instead of hundred
11:38 - i'm going to choose a random number so i
11:42 - go to operator
11:44 - and then i delete this hundred
11:47 - i drag the code pick random
12:01 - um let's say
12:04 - 20 percent to
12:08 - maybe 150 percent
12:14 - and then also the color i can make it
12:18 - different
12:18 - again going to the looks and set
12:22 - color
12:26 - effect to similarly from the operator
12:32 - dragging the pick random one two
12:37 - 100 so that the color
12:40 - is not the same as last time
12:45 - so this is what i have
12:49 - also i want to play the sound of
12:53 - fire so i go to the sounds
12:58 - i have two options i can also either
13:01 - search something from internet or choose
13:04 - something from the library
13:06 - i choose the library so i choose the
13:09 - library
13:13 - there is a sound which
13:17 - is called
13:20 - symbol
13:23 - which is quite similar to the fire
13:27 - if i make it slower
13:30 - [Music]
13:32 - it's more close to the farm
13:35 - a little faster and i can give it a fade
13:38 - out so it's even more like an actual
13:43 - firework okay
13:44 - so that's my uh
13:47 - sound going back to the code
13:51 - and then i go to the sound here
13:54 - i would say play sound symbol
13:58 - until done so after setting the color
14:02 - this is it this all right let's test it
14:07 - counting down
14:14 - make sure to show first and play sound
14:17 - second
14:18 - all right one last step is that
14:22 - we want to show happy new year after the
14:25 - 10
14:26 - fireworks are done so i can do that
14:28 - using backdrop so i go to the backdrops
14:31 - again
14:33 - and i choose backdrop
14:37 - of the same backdrop again
14:44 - which was stars
14:49 - and then i go to my backdrops
14:55 - uh i have two stars now so i choose the
14:57 - second one
14:59 - and i give the name
15:02 - happy
15:06 - new year and here
15:09 - i want to add the text
15:13 - happy new year with the color of my
15:17 - choice which is yellow for me
15:22 - happy new year 20
15:26 - 21
15:31 - and then just format it
15:34 - and then let's make it a bit bigger
15:38 - here we go
15:41 - so one last step in my code
15:45 - going clicking on the firework again
15:49 - at the end of my loop i'm gonna add
15:54 - switchback drop
15:59 - to happy new year so after 10
16:03 - i'm gonna see that
16:06 - i've already said i want to begin with
16:09 - the backdrop of
16:10 - stars
16:15 - [Applause]
16:18 - let's sing it for the last time
16:26 - now i have actual firework with lots of
16:30 - fires but then i don't want them all to
16:34 - appear
16:34 - at the same time so
16:39 - what i can do is i click on them
16:43 - and then give them the different wait
16:46 - times maybe this one two seconds and
16:48 - this one
16:51 - five seconds so that they don't show up
16:53 - all at the same time
17:04 - happy new year and see you next year
17:06 - with the new tutorials
17:08 - i will put the link to the coding sketch
17:10 - website

Cleaned transcript:

hello friends we are getting closer to the end of the 2020 and new year is about to arrive what i love most about the new year celebrations is the fireworks if you two like me love fireworks join me in this tutorial to see how we can create our own virtual firework in scratch let's dive in welcome to cuticle ninja tutorials this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun all right let's go to the scratch.mit.edu so that we can create a new project and then we click on the create on the left top corner and here we are when the project was opened we are going to create a firework for that we need a timer so we count using a timer we count down from let's say 10 to zero and then we shoot the fireworks so let's delete this cat so first thing we need a timer we go under click on the variables which is here and then i create i click on make a variable i name my variable timer also let's not forget to give our project a proper name which is firework fire break 20 21 okay now we have our timer i'm gonna set the start of the timer from by clicking on the variable so set timer to let's assume we're gonna count down from three so i set it to three and then change my variable by 1 and i want to wait one second between each count so on the control wait one second so set three wait one second change by minus one and i want it to be repeated over and over again so i change it to the large start so three we need to make sure that we have changed this to timer so i test it again now it's counting properly but the problem is it's gonna go below zero that's not what we want we want it to count until zero and then we wanna shoot the fireworks so what i'm gonna do is i put an if condition here so right after the change by 1 i'm gonna say if timer is equal is equal zero so i'm dragging this timer here if timer is zero in that case first thing is that i don't want to count down anymore first thing is i don't want to see this numbers anymore instead i want to see the firework so i'm going to hide this so under the variable we have the option of hiding the variable of choice so i drag this and i change it to timer so i hide this and also i want to broadcast the message of starting fireworks so i'm going to events and i say broadcast a new message and my new messages start firework so i'm dragging it here what else i want is i want to play the sound here so that when the countdown is finished the crowd is cheering and the firework is going to be started so i go to the sound and the sound and then i search for i know that there is the sound of cheer already in the scratch library so i choose this and then here star stand cheer until done i drag it here and since i don't want to count down anymore when i get to zero it goes in the control and i drag stop this script so i want this script to be stopped let's run and see what's happening so i'm counting down until zero and i don't see this anymore i hear the cheers and one thing is i broadcasted the start firework so another sprite is going to receive this broadcast message and react to it let's also choose a backdrop so i go here and then i click on choose a backdrop and i obviously need a night because it's about the firework which is in the midnight so i choose the stars this is my desired backdrop now let's also create the firework by choosing the firework sprite so i've already downloaded a filework png image with transparent background so i go to upload the sprite and i choose this so when you are searching for the image make sure you are searching free image png firework so when you choose a png image it's giving you the image with transparent background so there is no background and it looks like the background is the backdrop of my code here all right initially when i click the start i have some expectations here so i go to the events and i drag when start clicked first thing i want to make sure that i'm on the star background so backdrop so from the looks i would say show or like switch back to up to stars and i want to make sure that this is initially hidden so i'm going to hide this as well so this is for when start click i also had a broadcast message so i go here and then when i receive the broadcasted message which is which is start firework i'm gonna do a set of things all right so when i receive the broadcast um i'm gonna start from heart so initially the fireworks should be hidden and then i i need to wait a bit let's say a second wait one second or maybe half a second and then now height now show and i want it to happen repeatedly so i go to the control i can do forever if i want it to go on and on forever but i want to have a limited amount of time so that i can count it and after a day firework is over i want to say the happy new year message so i choose repeat 10 times height weight show so let's pick a start um so the countdown didn't appear let's go back to the backdrop and see what needs to be fixed okay so when the start clicked we need to make sure that the countdown variable is shown so show variable timer i test it again so now i see a countdown three times and then the firework is gone now we have the basic code but let's enhance it a bit to make this wire more natural we don't want every time that i'm shooting the fire the same position and the same size and color of the fire appears so what i can do is first from the motions i drag the code go to random position so before i show i go to random position and then i can also set the random size so i go to the looks and then i choose set size to instead of hundred i'm going to choose a random number so i go to operator and then i delete this hundred i drag the code pick random um let's say 20 percent to maybe 150 percent and then also the color i can make it different again going to the looks and set color effect to similarly from the operator dragging the pick random one two 100 so that the color is not the same as last time so this is what i have also i want to play the sound of fire so i go to the sounds i have two options i can also either search something from internet or choose something from the library i choose the library so i choose the library there is a sound which is called symbol which is quite similar to the fire if i make it slower it's more close to the farm a little faster and i can give it a fade out so it's even more like an actual firework okay so that's my uh sound going back to the code and then i go to the sound here i would say play sound symbol until done so after setting the color this is it this all right let's test it counting down make sure to show first and play sound second all right one last step is that we want to show happy new year after the 10 fireworks are done so i can do that using backdrop so i go to the backdrops again and i choose backdrop of the same backdrop again which was stars and then i go to my backdrops uh i have two stars now so i choose the second one and i give the name happy new year and here i want to add the text happy new year with the color of my choice which is yellow for me happy new year 20 21 and then just format it and then let's make it a bit bigger here we go so one last step in my code going clicking on the firework again at the end of my loop i'm gonna add switchback drop to happy new year so after 10 i'm gonna see that i've already said i want to begin with the backdrop of stars let's sing it for the last time now i have actual firework with lots of fires but then i don't want them all to appear at the same time so what i can do is i click on them and then give them the different wait times maybe this one two seconds and this one five seconds so that they don't show up all at the same time happy new year and see you next year with the new tutorials i will put the link to the coding sketch website in the description and you can go there and remix it and share your projects with us if you like the video don't forget to like subscribe and hit the bell so that you won't miss the next tutorial see you next year and happy new year
