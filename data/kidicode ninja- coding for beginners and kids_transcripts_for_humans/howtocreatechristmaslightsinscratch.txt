00:00 - hello and welcome to kirikou ninja
00:03 - tutorials
00:03 - in this tutorial we're going to create a
00:06 - christmas decoration
00:08 - in scratch let's dive in
00:12 - again like always we click on the create
00:16 - after we went to scratch.mit.edu
00:20 - we click on create
00:23 - and we
00:26 - wait for the project environment to open
00:34 - we get rid of everything that we don't
00:36 - need we're going to create a very
00:39 - simple quick christmas decoration
00:42 - in scratch first thing we
00:46 - choose a backdrop from the backdrop
00:56 - i choose snow
01:01 - i actually
01:04 - choose winter which is
01:09 - relevant to what we're going to do so i
01:11 - choose this
01:13 - and then we need some spice
01:19 - okay now we need to choose sprite
01:22 - so i go to the sprites i click here
01:26 - and then i choose snow
01:32 - so we have snowman we have snowflake
01:36 - both relevant i choose this one
01:40 - which is nice and then
01:45 - i go to snow
01:52 - snowflake
01:54 - can reduce the size maybe to
01:57 - 10 it's too small
02:00 - 20 good
02:05 - and i can
02:09 - duplicate it multiple times
02:13 - so that i have a bit more snow
02:23 - good enough and then i arrange them the
02:26 - way i want
02:31 - less also now let's decorate
02:35 - trees and dry the coat
02:38 - so i go to the sprite again
02:46 - let's put a bell
02:53 - make it smaller 30
02:58 - few more so again i duplicate it
03:03 - and duplicate and duplicate
03:06 - so i put a couple of bells
03:10 - on each tree and then
03:15 - now let's create some lights as well
03:28 - in order to create lights we again go to
03:32 - sprites
03:34 - now we can take ball
03:38 - instead of light so i take one
03:43 - and then we duplicate as many as we want
03:47 - so the more the more beautiful
03:51 - but i just duplicate a few to just demo
03:54 - and then you can do as many as you want
03:57 - for yourself
04:01 - we can give them size so
04:04 - i select and then i adjust the size from
04:07 - here
04:10 - 30
04:13 - we can do different sizes
04:16 - to make it more beautiful
04:20 - maybe this one 45
04:25 - you can do really whatever you want 50
04:30 - and
04:30 - [Music]
04:36 - 60 is too big
04:40 - so 80 and then we arrange them
04:44 - on those trees
04:51 - one also here now we're gonna write a
04:54 - code
04:55 - so that those
05:00 - balls look like a light that is flashing
05:04 - so in order to do that i write
05:07 - when start clicked
05:13 - forever
05:18 - and then from the looks because you're
05:20 - going to change the color or appearance
05:22 - so
05:22 - it's look change color effect by
05:26 - 25 and then i put a weight in between
05:31 - [Music]
05:34 - and one more change of color
05:39 - so again change color and i can make the
05:43 - weight a bit shorter to
05:44 - look like an animation i play start to
05:49 - see
05:49 - what i did so if you look at this one
05:52 - you see how the color is changing
05:56 - oh we have one more here as well all
05:59 - right
06:00 - now in order to apply the code to the
06:03 - other ones as well
06:06 - i go to the one that i have the code in
06:09 - it
06:11 - and then i can simply
06:14 - drag the code from here to the slide
06:18 - so that the code would be copied on the
06:21 - other balls as well so like this fall
06:23 - doesn't have anything
06:25 - but this ball has the code so i put my
06:28 - mouse here
06:29 - and then i drag it on this ball
06:35 - and again
06:40 - i go to the ball that doesn't have
06:43 - anything and then i
06:44 - drag the coat on top of it
06:48 - and i repeat this for every other ball
06:53 - so again here
06:56 - and here
07:02 - so now if i look at the other
07:06 - balls now you see every ball
07:09 - has a coat so now that i
07:13 - click start all of them see that color
07:16 - effect
07:20 - if my initial color would be
07:23 - different they would act differently as
07:26 - well
07:27 - but now it's also a nice design
07:31 - uh one more thing we can do is
07:34 - we can ask this uh snowman to say
07:39 - happy holiday or some message
07:43 - so in order to do that i click on the
07:46 - snowman now i'm on the snowman code
07:50 - environment
07:50 - and then i say uh
07:54 - when start clicked and then from the
07:58 - looks say
08:01 - hello for two
08:05 - seconds then i change the two to maybe
08:10 - five and then instead of hello
08:13 - i say happy
08:18 - holidays or
08:22 - any message that you like and then i
08:25 - click
08:26 - start again so i see the message is
08:29 - coming
08:30 - stays for five seconds and the lies are
08:33 - flashing there are a lot more things
08:36 - we can do but we can continue
08:40 - on this on the next tutorials we can
08:44 - make the snows move we can create
08:48 - a card by putting this design
08:51 - into an actual foldable card
08:55 - so feel free to write on the comment
09:00 - if you have any idea of what we can do
09:02 - to make it more interesting

09:07 - with me
09:08 - and if you have any question feel free
09:10 - to ask and i'm going to answer your
