00:00 - hello everyone how are you doing i hope
00:03 - you're all doing
00:04 - wonderful i'm back with another tutorial
00:08 - and in this tutorial we're going to see
00:10 - how to create space shooter game
00:14 - this is a this is your place to learn to
00:18 - do it and have fun
00:21 - in order to support my channel so that i
00:23 - can create more content for you
00:26 - make sure to subscribe like and hit the
00:29 - bell so that you can see my new uploads
00:32 - and also make sure to share with your
00:34 - friends so that
00:35 - other smart people like yourself can see
00:38 - my videos
00:40 - so let's dive right in
00:45 - all right let's see a demo of what we're
00:47 - gonna make
00:48 - first i need to hit the rocks
00:53 - and i also make sure i'm not hitting the
00:56 - stars
00:57 - so if i hit the stars i'm losing
01:01 - points
01:05 - [Music]
01:08 - now let's see how we can make this
01:12 - okay let's see what we need in order to
01:15 - make this game
01:17 - we need a couple of items that i'm gonna
01:19 - use and
01:20 - i'm gonna add first let's choose a
01:22 - backdrop
01:24 - there is a space category so i go right
01:26 - away to this
01:28 - space and then i'm gonna choose
01:32 - galaxy this one is also a good one
01:35 - i'm gonna choose this so
01:39 - i also need a couple of sprites
01:43 - i need rock
01:48 - so rock and rocket ship
01:52 - so both of them
01:57 - [Music]
01:58 - searching again
02:00 - [Music]
02:01 - my internet is a bit slow today but
02:04 - that's okay
02:06 - rocket ship and then
02:10 - what else let's put a star
02:14 - so i want to have
02:18 - star and rocks both of them
02:22 - i want to come from this from the sky
02:25 - like from the top and then if i hit the
02:29 - star i'm gonna
02:30 - lose point and if i hit this the
02:34 - rocks i'm gonna get points
02:37 - so i also need bullets because
02:41 - this rocket ship is supposed to shoot at
02:45 - the items that are coming from the top
02:48 - so there is no bullet i'm gonna
02:52 - paint it by myself
02:56 - um the way i do it
02:59 - you can also download the image
03:02 - but anyway i just decided to do this
03:08 - uh so i draw two squares
03:11 - and then using the line
03:16 - i'm gonna draw a line like a rectangle
03:20 - here
03:22 - and then with paint i'm filling
03:26 - it using this one
03:32 - i'm gonna make it look like fire it's
03:35 - not really like
03:36 - it but let's let's just say
03:40 - it's similar who cares
03:44 - uh
03:50 - not bad at all oops
03:53 - what did i do
03:59 - okay i'm quite happy with
04:03 - what i made so i'm gonna select
04:06 - all and group them together so i have a
04:09 - bullet let's also give it a good name
04:13 - uh so let
04:17 - also my project doesn't have a good name
04:20 - yet so i'm gonna
04:21 - give it a name space
04:24 - [Music]
04:26 - shooter
04:30 - safe shooter okay
04:33 - okay i have all items
04:37 - here we go and let's set the sizes to
04:40 - a proper size right here
04:44 - so i want this one to be smaller much
04:47 - smaller 20 is good the rocks
04:52 - it can be half of the size 50
04:56 - stars still to be
05:00 - 30 too small 60
05:06 - 60 is good and then
05:10 - rocket ship is also too big for
05:14 - this screen okay
05:17 - now all the items are here ready to go
05:23 - let's start by writing the code for our
05:26 - rocket ship i want to control this to go
05:30 - right and left by pressing my right and
05:34 - left
05:34 - arrow key i also want to
05:38 - have a variable to track the scores so
05:42 - first let's create a variable
05:46 - make a variable and i'm gonna name it
05:51 - score i want it to be for all surprise
05:56 - so i want it to be available to allspice
06:00 - so okay so i have the score here
06:05 - and then so just
06:08 - when start clicked
06:12 - let's zoom in a bit so that you can see
06:16 - when clicked let's say i want it to be
06:20 - here at this position so i put it here
06:23 - by my mouse
06:24 - and then when i go to motions
06:29 - this x and y are already set to what i
06:33 - want so minus 2
06:34 - and minus 140
06:40 - and i also want to initiate my
06:43 - score i want the score to be
06:47 - to be zero
06:52 - variable variable
06:55 - where are you score score is here
06:59 - so set score
07:02 - to zero
07:05 - what else now i'm gonna say
07:11 - i'm gonna control it with
07:14 - if
07:19 - so to if then i want to say if i'm
07:22 - pressing
07:23 - right arrow do something and if i'm
07:25 - pressing
07:26 - left arrow do something else
07:32 - from the sensing
07:35 - i can say if key
07:42 - right arrow pressed
07:45 - do this and if left
07:49 - arrow pressed
07:52 - do the other things and
07:56 - the thing that is going to be done is a
07:59 - motion i want to
08:01 - direct it left or right
08:04 - so
08:08 - if right change x by 10
08:13 - if left change x
08:16 - by -10
08:19 - so i'm dragging it and then i'm changing
08:22 - this number
08:24 - let's see how it works i press start
08:29 - and is that i forgot to put a loop
08:34 - so i didn't say that i want to repeat
08:37 - something
08:38 - so let's go to the controls
08:42 - and then i want to repeat this
08:46 - lines of code so that's
08:50 - i don't need to click on this every time
08:53 - so
08:54 - repeat until
08:58 - i i want to have a condition what is the
09:00 - condition
09:01 - i want to go left and right
09:05 - by pressing the arrows
09:09 - until the rock the
09:13 - rocks is hitting the rocket ship after
09:16 - that i want to be game over so
09:19 - i repeat this only until is
09:23 - i'm touching that my rocket ship is
09:25 - touching the rock so going to the
09:27 - sensing
09:31 - and then
09:40 - so repeat until
09:43 - touching rocks
09:46 - so i put it here and
09:50 - now i expect if i press
09:54 - start or flag
09:58 - this goes right and goes left by
10:00 - pressing so
10:02 - i'm pressing right and left
10:06 - it should keep repeating itself
10:09 - and it only stops when this
10:12 - rock is hitting this rocket ship
10:16 - okay so far so good
10:21 - now let's write the code for rocks
10:25 - and for star if you have watched my snow
10:28 - falling
10:29 - video it's almost the same concept
10:32 - we create by the way i'm gonna put the
10:36 - link below
10:37 - so that you can check the snow as well
10:39 - it's very similar to
10:41 - this one when the snow is coming down
10:43 - it's the same as when the rocks and the
10:45 - stars are coming down
10:47 - so the strategy is creating a clone so
10:52 - when start when
10:55 - fly clicked create a
10:58 - clone of repeat like
11:02 - 10 times and then
11:07 - go to control
11:10 - create a clone of myself
11:14 - also i want to make sure that the rocks
11:17 - is visible initially and then
11:20 - when the clone is done i want to hide it
11:24 - so
11:25 - first i show it
11:28 - so i want to start with the
11:32 - rocket be available and then when the
11:35 - clones are
11:36 - made and the tasks are done
11:39 - i want to hide it so
11:43 - so far like this and then
11:46 - when i start as a
11:50 - clone where are you
11:53 - well i okay under control
11:57 - when i start as a clone
11:59 - [Music]
12:01 - what i want to happen is
12:03 - [Music]
12:04 - i basically want it to come down how do
12:07 - i do that
12:08 - i create a variable
12:14 - and i name it
12:22 - vertical speed
12:27 - and i want it to this is very important
12:30 - make sure to choose only
12:33 - for this sprite otherwise
12:37 - it's not gonna work properly so make
12:40 - sure to choose only for
12:41 - this sprite so that it's the local
12:44 - variable
12:45 - what i want to do with this
12:48 - i'm gonna hide it how to hide a variable
12:51 - just go to variable and
12:53 - uncheck this from here i only want to
12:57 - show the score
12:58 - on the stage now
13:02 - when uh
13:06 - i start as a clone i lost my sentence
13:11 - uh
13:15 - okay i want this vertical speed to be
13:19 - changed so let's
13:22 - go to
13:29 - operator and then i'm gonna set
13:34 - the value for it so set
13:39 - vertical speed
13:43 - to
13:46 - and then from operation a random number
13:51 - pick a random number
13:54 - i'm gonna give it a random
13:57 - negative number since i wanted to choose
14:02 - i wanted to use it for
14:05 - y direction and coming down so i say
14:09 - minus 1 2 minus 5. in a minute it will
14:14 - all make sense
14:15 - what why i'm doing it
14:19 - so for when i when we start as a clone
14:22 - i did set the
14:26 - value for my vertical speed other than
14:29 - that i need one more initialization
14:32 - which is the location of this rock i
14:35 - want this rock to be
14:38 - to start from the top but it can be
14:42 - anywhere
14:42 - on the x-axis so i wanted to
14:46 - go
14:50 - go to
14:54 - i want x and y
14:59 - i wonder why to be always at the top
15:03 - [Music]
15:05 - so
15:08 - [Music]
15:10 - i'm gonna so like where it is
15:14 - already or maybe even
15:17 - higher so that it's coming from really
15:20 - high
15:21 - and then for the y since i'm saying
15:24 - anywhere on the x-axis
15:27 - it can be a random number
15:31 - so pick a random number
15:37 - anywhere between
15:41 - left and left to
15:44 - almost and left to and
15:47 - right so now i know
15:51 - the clone starts from the top and
15:53 - anywhere here
15:56 - so like the rocket ship we want a
16:00 - set of steps to be completed
16:04 - repeatedly so i go to repeat
16:07 - until
16:10 - until a condition and the condition for
16:13 - game over in this game is when
16:16 - the rock is hitting the rock star
16:20 - so repeat until
16:27 - touching
16:30 - rocket ship
16:33 - and then after this condition
16:38 - is met we are game
16:42 - over so
16:46 - i would go to control and then
16:50 - i'm gonna broadcast a message game over
16:55 - not control sorry i go to events
16:58 - and i broadcast
17:02 - i need to create my new message i'm
17:07 - naming it game over
17:16 - so
17:18 - i want to say if this touching
17:21 - happened broadcast message game over
17:26 - then i'm going to broadcast this
17:29 - use this broadcasted message to
17:32 - show the game over screen now
17:36 - let's complete this one so what i want
17:39 - to happen
17:40 - before touching the screen obviously
17:44 - i want the rockets i want the rocks to
17:47 - come down
17:48 - so how to say i want it to come down by
17:51 - [Music]
17:52 - changing the y direction so i need a
17:55 - motion
17:58 - so i'm gonna say
18:01 - change y by
18:07 - not by 10 but
18:10 - by this
18:15 - very close bit
18:19 - which is already defined here
18:28 - one more thing i want to say is
18:31 - uh so this rocket is coming down down
18:35 - down and when it
18:37 - gets to the end i want it to go back
18:40 - up again and come down so
18:44 - it's repeating until touch unless it's
18:46 - touching the rocket shape
18:48 - i'm changing the one and then
18:52 - when it came here so i'm saying
18:56 - when it ha this thing happened if this
18:58 - thing happened
19:00 - if so it means control
19:04 - if if my new location
19:08 - became
19:12 - something like what it is right now
19:20 - so if
19:25 - my y location
19:32 - is less than something which is
19:35 - right now this is minus 172
19:41 - is less than minus
19:44 - 200 for instance or it can be even less
19:50 - um i want to say
19:56 - under motions
19:59 - i choose y position
20:02 - if y position is less than this number
20:06 - go to the location that it originally
20:08 - was
20:10 - so i just need to copy this part of the
20:13 - code
20:13 - in order to do that
20:17 - i'm gonna separate this and then i
20:20 - duplicate this
20:24 - so that i can put it here
20:28 - i want one more of it as well i'm
20:31 - putting it here for now
20:37 - come on come on come on go back okay
20:42 - so so far so good
20:46 - right the code for when we are heating
20:52 - the bullets are hitting the stone
20:57 - so another
21:01 - if condition for changing the score
21:05 - so if something happened the score
21:08 - should go
21:09 - up so from the variables
21:14 - um change score
21:18 - by 10 for instance or anything you want
21:23 - so if something successfully happened we
21:26 - want the score to be changed and then i
21:30 - also
21:31 - want the
21:36 - position of the rock at
21:40 - the position of the rock go back to the
21:42 - top again
21:44 - so i'm hitting the rock the rock should
21:47 - basically disappear and a new rock is
21:50 - going to come
21:51 - from the top so i'm going to drag this
21:56 - how do i say that
21:59 - i successfully shooted the rock
22:04 - i can say
22:07 - i can simply say if touching
22:11 - the rock is touching the bullet
22:15 - so from the sensing if
22:20 - touching bullets
22:23 - if touching bullets score is added
22:28 - ten ten score is shaved
22:32 - and then this rock should
22:35 - kind of disappears how do we say
22:37 - disappear is that
22:38 - it just goes up again so that is it
22:41 - looks like a new one is coming
22:44 - so let's give it a test and see
22:49 - so now this
22:52 - rocket is hitting the rock so
22:56 - the code stopped i'm not the things are
22:59 - not repeated
23:02 - uh and i only got 20.
23:09 - technically after this i should be game
23:11 - over but we have not yet
23:13 - programmed the game over part we just
23:16 - broadcasted the message
23:18 - but not yet completed
23:22 - let's also make it a bit fun because
23:25 - currently
23:29 - when i'm hitting this i don't hear
23:32 - any sound or anything so just let's add
23:35 - a sound
23:37 - so i'm gonna i'm going to the sounds
23:41 - actually this sounds and let's search
23:44 - for
23:46 - anything related to space so i want to
23:49 - play
23:50 - a sound for the time that the bullet
23:53 - is hit or the rocket or bullet is
23:56 - hitting the
23:57 - uh basically when the rock is heated
24:05 - i'm gonna choose this
24:09 - and i'm gonna play with it a bit
24:12 - make it
24:15 - [Music]
24:17 - slower so
24:20 - it's like this the rock is exploding
24:25 - so boom cloud i did add it here
24:29 - and then also let's add it to the code
24:31 - as well so
24:33 - from the code and the sound
24:37 - at this point that
24:40 - the bullet is touching the rock i'm
24:43 - gonna play
24:44 - sound boom cloud
24:48 - until done so
24:52 - we're done with this one
24:55 - now the star is also
25:00 - have has all the same codes
25:03 - so i'm gonna copy that and then i'm
25:06 - gonna modify it
25:07 - a little bit so that they are
25:10 - differentiated
25:12 - so how to copy every code that is for
25:15 - rocks to start i simply
25:19 - click i stay on the rock
25:22 - i drag this on the star
25:27 - and i also drag this
25:31 - again on top of the star
25:35 - so if i go on the star
25:37 - [Music]
25:39 - i should see both of the codes here
25:46 - so i'm just gonna make sure i'm putting
25:48 - my mouse at the top so that everything
25:50 - is coming
25:53 - to the start now is what i want
25:58 - alright so now is the time to
26:08 - rename
26:12 - this one to
26:16 - start vertical speed
26:21 - and then i say okay
26:24 - i press start
26:30 - now the variables
26:33 - working for both of them
26:42 - so stars are coming down rocks are
26:44 - coming down as well
26:46 - in order to differentiate them
26:50 - um maybe instead of 10
26:54 - star i only put three
26:57 - because i want to avoid hitting the
27:00 - stars but i
27:02 - i need to hit the rocks in order to win
27:06 - so if it's too many stars it's gonna get
27:08 - difficult
27:10 - and i'm gonna lose
27:13 - score when i'm hitting the stars so
27:17 - instead of
27:18 - positive i'm just gonna lose two
27:21 - scores maybe and then
27:24 - i want the speed of the star to be
27:27 - slower
27:28 - so i go only until minus three
27:32 - so now they are 12 different shapes
27:36 - [Music]
27:38 - now let's program the bullet this
27:41 - is the fun part this is a part that the
27:44 - bullet is shooting up
27:49 - by pressing spacebar
27:52 - so initially when
27:56 - flag is clicked i want it to be hidden
27:59 - so
28:00 - it looks like it doesn't exist and then
28:02 - when i
28:03 - so first hide it so let's say it looks
28:07 - like it doesn't exist
28:08 - and then when i'm pressing my spacebar
28:12 - so from events
28:15 - when space is clicked
28:19 - i want a clone of it to be created
28:24 - so
28:28 - control and
28:34 - create a clone of myself cyclone is
28:37 - created
28:39 - and then i want this clone to go
28:42 - to the same location that the rocket
28:45 - ship
28:46 - is located so i say go to
28:51 - go to
28:52 - [Music]
28:56 - i delete this numbers
28:59 - i just say
29:08 - how to say the location of
29:13 - the spaceship
29:18 - first
29:22 - go to sensing
29:27 - and then
29:31 - this is a bit tricky you won't see it
29:34 - first
29:35 - there is a code which says backdrop
29:38 - of stage change stage to
29:44 - rocket shape and then you will
29:48 - see exposition
29:51 - so drag it here
29:56 - and then again drag it here and change
29:59 - to
30:00 - y position so what i want to say
30:03 - is whenever i'm pressing the space spark
30:07 - key a clone is created
30:11 - and then when i start as a clone i go to
30:14 - this
30:15 - location so
30:19 - i should say when
30:23 - i start as a clone i go to this location
30:30 - and then in order to say how to shoot it
30:34 - a movement is required so
30:38 - change y by
30:42 - maybe like 10 steps
30:45 - each shooting let's see what happens
30:48 - start
30:51 - so something that's not correct here
30:54 - let's see what is wrong
31:00 - so few problems here
31:04 - firstly not set y to 10
31:07 - but change
31:10 - change y by 10
31:14 - second is when i start as a clone it's
31:16 - still hidden
31:17 - so make let's show it first
31:24 - then this needs to be in a loop
31:29 - because i want to keep shooting so
31:34 - repeat until
31:38 - repeat until hitting the rock
31:42 - or yeah that's a good strategy
31:47 - we can always try test and see
31:50 - how best works so repeat
31:56 - until repeat and
32:00 - not repeat just repeat until
32:03 - [Music]
32:06 - um repeat until repeat until
32:11 - touching so i go to sensing
32:15 - and then i take touching
32:20 - [Music]
32:22 - the bullets touching the rock so
32:26 - touching rocks
32:31 - it might work now i
32:35 - think let's test
32:38 - so i press start
32:41 - um it's not yet moving
32:45 - so again let's see what he's wrong
32:50 - so here accidentally when i start as a
32:54 - clone
32:54 - i show it and this go to this location
33:00 - is accidentally dragged inside so it
33:02 - should go back
33:03 - up only change y
33:07 - should be inside
33:10 - all right and then
33:14 - at the end the clone should be deleted
33:18 - so make sure we're deleting the clone as
33:22 - well
33:25 - which is on the control
33:29 - start so now it's working
33:34 - [Music]
33:36 - perfectly
33:38 - now the last part
33:42 - is to be able to show the game over
33:45 - we did already broadcast the message
33:50 - game over but no one is saying it
33:53 - uh in order to show the game over
33:56 - i'm going to my backdrop
34:00 - so backdrops i'm creating one more
34:03 - backdrop
34:04 - by duplicating this and i'm naming it
34:10 - game over
34:15 - and then i'm writing the word game over
34:19 - on it i'm gonna choose the font
34:24 - pixel you can choose anything but
34:28 - kicks pixel is quite good for
34:32 - the games so i'm gonna
34:35 - write
34:39 - game over and
34:43 - i want it a bit bigger so i'm just
34:47 - clicking on here i'm selecting it
34:51 - and then i'm dragging it
34:57 - so i have this nice game over
35:01 - screen and then i go to
35:04 - code i
35:07 - say when so when
35:10 - means an event when
35:15 - i received game over
35:19 - i go to backdrop
35:22 - switch back drop to game over
35:28 - also the initial state
35:32 - which is when flank is clicked
35:35 - i want the backdrop to be just like a
35:39 - galaxy so switch back drop to galaxy
35:47 - switch backdrop to game over for game
35:50 - over
35:51 - and i want to stop all the scripts so
35:54 - that
35:55 - it's actually all things are done so i
35:57 - stop
35:58 - all a sound for
36:02 - the losing so i go to sound library
36:06 - i add let's see if there is anything for
36:10 - [Music]
36:11 - there is and it's not bad so i'm gonna
36:16 - add it
36:19 - so backdrop
36:22 - go back to the code so
36:25 - switch back drop the game over play
36:28 - sound
36:31 - lose until done and stop
36:34 - everything so let's play the game
36:38 - so i press start
36:43 - [Music]
36:46 - why did i game over i think i hated the
36:50 - rocks so let's play again
36:59 - oh so something i need to fix here
37:03 - there is a bark when i'm hitting the
37:05 - stars
37:06 - i'm gonna get game over that's not what
37:08 - i want
37:09 - because i shouldn't hit the stars so i'm
37:12 - very likely to hit them
37:14 - so what i'm gonna do is on the stars
37:18 - i don't want it to be repeated until
37:20 - touching
37:21 - rocket ship instead
37:25 - i want this to happen forever
37:29 - so i won't lose if the star
37:33 - or the rocket the star and rocket ship
37:36 - are touching
37:36 - each other so i put it here and then
37:40 - i put forever instead
37:45 - and here we go let's play again
37:53 - [Music]
37:58 - so two more changes is needed i don't
38:01 - want to game over when i'm not hitting
38:03 - the
38:04 - stars so i take this off
38:07 - and i take this off as well
38:13 - so now
38:16 - should be okay
38:26 - i hit that rock okay
38:30 - that was a really fun tutorial i hope
38:33 - you
38:33 - liked it and i hope you learned
38:35 - something
38:36 - uh if you did make sure to press
38:40 - like subscribe share it with your
38:43 - friends
38:46 - also there is a lot of room for
38:49 - improvements in this game
38:55 - i'm not going to say what you can do to
38:57 - improve it but you can
38:59 - but if you have a lot of i'm sure you
39:01 - have a lot of ideas on how we can remix
39:04 - it and improve this
39:05 - game you can comment
39:08 - below and share your awesome
39:12 - ideas actually i'm gonna give you a hint
39:16 - how would you go to the next level or
39:20 - um yeah i'm not gonna say anything

39:42 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone how are you doing i hope you're all doing wonderful i'm back with another tutorial and in this tutorial we're going to see how to create space shooter game this is a this is your place to learn to do it and have fun in order to support my channel so that i can create more content for you make sure to subscribe like and hit the bell so that you can see my new uploads and also make sure to share with your friends so that other smart people like yourself can see my videos so let's dive right in all right let's see a demo of what we're gonna make first i need to hit the rocks and i also make sure i'm not hitting the stars so if i hit the stars i'm losing points now let's see how we can make this okay let's see what we need in order to make this game we need a couple of items that i'm gonna use and i'm gonna add first let's choose a backdrop there is a space category so i go right away to this space and then i'm gonna choose galaxy this one is also a good one i'm gonna choose this so i also need a couple of sprites i need rock so rock and rocket ship so both of them searching again my internet is a bit slow today but that's okay rocket ship and then what else let's put a star so i want to have star and rocks both of them i want to come from this from the sky like from the top and then if i hit the star i'm gonna lose point and if i hit this the rocks i'm gonna get points so i also need bullets because this rocket ship is supposed to shoot at the items that are coming from the top so there is no bullet i'm gonna paint it by myself um the way i do it you can also download the image but anyway i just decided to do this uh so i draw two squares and then using the line i'm gonna draw a line like a rectangle here and then with paint i'm filling it using this one i'm gonna make it look like fire it's not really like it but let's let's just say it's similar who cares uh not bad at all oops what did i do okay i'm quite happy with what i made so i'm gonna select all and group them together so i have a bullet let's also give it a good name uh so let also my project doesn't have a good name yet so i'm gonna give it a name space shooter safe shooter okay okay i have all items here we go and let's set the sizes to a proper size right here so i want this one to be smaller much smaller 20 is good the rocks it can be half of the size 50 stars still to be 30 too small 60 60 is good and then rocket ship is also too big for this screen okay now all the items are here ready to go let's start by writing the code for our rocket ship i want to control this to go right and left by pressing my right and left arrow key i also want to have a variable to track the scores so first let's create a variable make a variable and i'm gonna name it score i want it to be for all surprise so i want it to be available to allspice so okay so i have the score here and then so just when start clicked let's zoom in a bit so that you can see when clicked let's say i want it to be here at this position so i put it here by my mouse and then when i go to motions this x and y are already set to what i want so minus 2 and minus 140 and i also want to initiate my score i want the score to be to be zero variable variable where are you score score is here so set score to zero what else now i'm gonna say i'm gonna control it with if so to if then i want to say if i'm pressing right arrow do something and if i'm pressing left arrow do something else from the sensing i can say if key right arrow pressed do this and if left arrow pressed do the other things and the thing that is going to be done is a motion i want to direct it left or right so if right change x by 10 if left change x by 10 so i'm dragging it and then i'm changing this number let's see how it works i press start and is that i forgot to put a loop so i didn't say that i want to repeat something so let's go to the controls and then i want to repeat this lines of code so that's i don't need to click on this every time so repeat until i i want to have a condition what is the condition i want to go left and right by pressing the arrows until the rock the rocks is hitting the rocket ship after that i want to be game over so i repeat this only until is i'm touching that my rocket ship is touching the rock so going to the sensing and then so repeat until touching rocks so i put it here and now i expect if i press start or flag this goes right and goes left by pressing so i'm pressing right and left it should keep repeating itself and it only stops when this rock is hitting this rocket ship okay so far so good now let's write the code for rocks and for star if you have watched my snow falling video it's almost the same concept we create by the way i'm gonna put the link below so that you can check the snow as well it's very similar to this one when the snow is coming down it's the same as when the rocks and the stars are coming down so the strategy is creating a clone so when start when fly clicked create a clone of repeat like 10 times and then go to control create a clone of myself also i want to make sure that the rocks is visible initially and then when the clone is done i want to hide it so first i show it so i want to start with the rocket be available and then when the clones are made and the tasks are done i want to hide it so so far like this and then when i start as a clone where are you well i okay under control when i start as a clone what i want to happen is i basically want it to come down how do i do that i create a variable and i name it vertical speed and i want it to this is very important make sure to choose only for this sprite otherwise it's not gonna work properly so make sure to choose only for this sprite so that it's the local variable what i want to do with this i'm gonna hide it how to hide a variable just go to variable and uncheck this from here i only want to show the score on the stage now when uh i start as a clone i lost my sentence uh okay i want this vertical speed to be changed so let's go to operator and then i'm gonna set the value for it so set vertical speed to and then from operation a random number pick a random number i'm gonna give it a random negative number since i wanted to choose i wanted to use it for y direction and coming down so i say minus 1 2 minus 5. in a minute it will all make sense what why i'm doing it so for when i when we start as a clone i did set the value for my vertical speed other than that i need one more initialization which is the location of this rock i want this rock to be to start from the top but it can be anywhere on the xaxis so i wanted to go go to i want x and y i wonder why to be always at the top so i'm gonna so like where it is already or maybe even higher so that it's coming from really high and then for the y since i'm saying anywhere on the xaxis it can be a random number so pick a random number anywhere between left and left to almost and left to and right so now i know the clone starts from the top and anywhere here so like the rocket ship we want a set of steps to be completed repeatedly so i go to repeat until until a condition and the condition for game over in this game is when the rock is hitting the rock star so repeat until touching rocket ship and then after this condition is met we are game over so i would go to control and then i'm gonna broadcast a message game over not control sorry i go to events and i broadcast i need to create my new message i'm naming it game over so i want to say if this touching happened broadcast message game over then i'm going to broadcast this use this broadcasted message to show the game over screen now let's complete this one so what i want to happen before touching the screen obviously i want the rockets i want the rocks to come down so how to say i want it to come down by changing the y direction so i need a motion so i'm gonna say change y by not by 10 but by this very close bit which is already defined here one more thing i want to say is uh so this rocket is coming down down down and when it gets to the end i want it to go back up again and come down so it's repeating until touch unless it's touching the rocket shape i'm changing the one and then when it came here so i'm saying when it ha this thing happened if this thing happened if so it means control if if my new location became something like what it is right now so if my y location is less than something which is right now this is minus 172 is less than minus 200 for instance or it can be even less um i want to say under motions i choose y position if y position is less than this number go to the location that it originally was so i just need to copy this part of the code in order to do that i'm gonna separate this and then i duplicate this so that i can put it here i want one more of it as well i'm putting it here for now come on come on come on go back okay so so far so good right the code for when we are heating the bullets are hitting the stone so another if condition for changing the score so if something happened the score should go up so from the variables um change score by 10 for instance or anything you want so if something successfully happened we want the score to be changed and then i also want the position of the rock at the position of the rock go back to the top again so i'm hitting the rock the rock should basically disappear and a new rock is going to come from the top so i'm going to drag this how do i say that i successfully shooted the rock i can say i can simply say if touching the rock is touching the bullet so from the sensing if touching bullets if touching bullets score is added ten ten score is shaved and then this rock should kind of disappears how do we say disappear is that it just goes up again so that is it looks like a new one is coming so let's give it a test and see so now this rocket is hitting the rock so the code stopped i'm not the things are not repeated uh and i only got 20. technically after this i should be game over but we have not yet programmed the game over part we just broadcasted the message but not yet completed let's also make it a bit fun because currently when i'm hitting this i don't hear any sound or anything so just let's add a sound so i'm gonna i'm going to the sounds actually this sounds and let's search for anything related to space so i want to play a sound for the time that the bullet is hit or the rocket or bullet is hitting the uh basically when the rock is heated i'm gonna choose this and i'm gonna play with it a bit make it slower so it's like this the rock is exploding so boom cloud i did add it here and then also let's add it to the code as well so from the code and the sound at this point that the bullet is touching the rock i'm gonna play sound boom cloud until done so we're done with this one now the star is also have has all the same codes so i'm gonna copy that and then i'm gonna modify it a little bit so that they are differentiated so how to copy every code that is for rocks to start i simply click i stay on the rock i drag this on the star and i also drag this again on top of the star so if i go on the star i should see both of the codes here so i'm just gonna make sure i'm putting my mouse at the top so that everything is coming to the start now is what i want alright so now is the time to rename this one to start vertical speed and then i say okay i press start now the variables working for both of them so stars are coming down rocks are coming down as well in order to differentiate them um maybe instead of 10 star i only put three because i want to avoid hitting the stars but i i need to hit the rocks in order to win so if it's too many stars it's gonna get difficult and i'm gonna lose score when i'm hitting the stars so instead of positive i'm just gonna lose two scores maybe and then i want the speed of the star to be slower so i go only until minus three so now they are 12 different shapes now let's program the bullet this is the fun part this is a part that the bullet is shooting up by pressing spacebar so initially when flag is clicked i want it to be hidden so it looks like it doesn't exist and then when i so first hide it so let's say it looks like it doesn't exist and then when i'm pressing my spacebar so from events when space is clicked i want a clone of it to be created so control and create a clone of myself cyclone is created and then i want this clone to go to the same location that the rocket ship is located so i say go to go to i delete this numbers i just say how to say the location of the spaceship first go to sensing and then this is a bit tricky you won't see it first there is a code which says backdrop of stage change stage to rocket shape and then you will see exposition so drag it here and then again drag it here and change to y position so what i want to say is whenever i'm pressing the space spark key a clone is created and then when i start as a clone i go to this location so i should say when i start as a clone i go to this location and then in order to say how to shoot it a movement is required so change y by maybe like 10 steps each shooting let's see what happens start so something that's not correct here let's see what is wrong so few problems here firstly not set y to 10 but change change y by 10 second is when i start as a clone it's still hidden so make let's show it first then this needs to be in a loop because i want to keep shooting so repeat until repeat until hitting the rock or yeah that's a good strategy we can always try test and see how best works so repeat until repeat and not repeat just repeat until um repeat until repeat until touching so i go to sensing and then i take touching the bullets touching the rock so touching rocks it might work now i think let's test so i press start um it's not yet moving so again let's see what he's wrong so here accidentally when i start as a clone i show it and this go to this location is accidentally dragged inside so it should go back up only change y should be inside all right and then at the end the clone should be deleted so make sure we're deleting the clone as well which is on the control start so now it's working perfectly now the last part is to be able to show the game over we did already broadcast the message game over but no one is saying it uh in order to show the game over i'm going to my backdrop so backdrops i'm creating one more backdrop by duplicating this and i'm naming it game over and then i'm writing the word game over on it i'm gonna choose the font pixel you can choose anything but kicks pixel is quite good for the games so i'm gonna write game over and i want it a bit bigger so i'm just clicking on here i'm selecting it and then i'm dragging it so i have this nice game over screen and then i go to code i say when so when means an event when i received game over i go to backdrop switch back drop to game over also the initial state which is when flank is clicked i want the backdrop to be just like a galaxy so switch back drop to galaxy switch backdrop to game over for game over and i want to stop all the scripts so that it's actually all things are done so i stop all a sound for the losing so i go to sound library i add let's see if there is anything for there is and it's not bad so i'm gonna add it so backdrop go back to the code so switch back drop the game over play sound lose until done and stop everything so let's play the game so i press start why did i game over i think i hated the rocks so let's play again oh so something i need to fix here there is a bark when i'm hitting the stars i'm gonna get game over that's not what i want because i shouldn't hit the stars so i'm very likely to hit them so what i'm gonna do is on the stars i don't want it to be repeated until touching rocket ship instead i want this to happen forever so i won't lose if the star or the rocket the star and rocket ship are touching each other so i put it here and then i put forever instead and here we go let's play again so two more changes is needed i don't want to game over when i'm not hitting the stars so i take this off and i take this off as well so now should be okay i hit that rock okay that was a really fun tutorial i hope you liked it and i hope you learned something uh if you did make sure to press like subscribe share it with your friends also there is a lot of room for improvements in this game i'm not going to say what you can do to improve it but you can but if you have a lot of i'm sure you have a lot of ideas on how we can remix it and improve this game you can comment below and share your awesome ideas actually i'm gonna give you a hint how would you go to the next level or um yeah i'm not gonna say anything so make sure to comment below any idea you have on how to improve this game see you next week don't forget to like you
