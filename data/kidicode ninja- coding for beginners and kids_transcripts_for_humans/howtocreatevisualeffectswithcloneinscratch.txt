00:00 - hello and welcome to another tutorial
00:03 - in this tutorial we're going to see how
00:05 - we can create amazing visual effects
00:08 - using clone
00:09 - if you don't know what is clone this is
00:12 - clone
00:14 - okay so like always let's go to
00:18 - scratch.mit.edu
00:20 - and then click create and wait until the
00:25 - interface is opened
00:30 - okay now we are going to see
00:34 - how we can use clone and how we can
00:36 - create
00:37 - visual effects here so
00:40 - we can use this cat but we can also use
00:44 - a different
00:45 - sprite so i delete it
00:48 - because i just prefer difference right
00:57 - so i click on choose a sprite
01:01 - and i use
01:04 - this one
01:11 - so
01:14 - let's go to the event and
01:18 - everything starts with the clicking on
01:20 - the flag so i say
01:22 - once start clicked i want to create a
01:25 - clone
01:26 - of this so under the control there is
01:29 - something
01:30 - called there is a block create a clone
01:33 - of myself so i drag it here
01:37 - so i expect when i click the start
01:40 - a clone of this sprite should be created
01:43 - so i click
01:45 - the clone is created but i don't see it
01:47 - because this
01:48 - clone is under this one so if i drag it
01:51 - i see the other
01:52 - the other one now let's do more things
01:56 - with this clone
01:59 - now that i have created a clone i can
02:02 - use
02:03 - a block of code which is
02:06 - under the control that says when
02:09 - i start as a clone
02:14 - so i drag it here when i start as a
02:16 - clone
02:18 - let's move it away okay when i start as
02:22 - a clone
02:23 - i can do various things
02:26 - with the clone that is created
02:30 - after this quote i want to say
02:34 - for instance move 10 steps
02:38 - so i say move 10 steps
02:44 - so a clone is created and it's moving
02:47 - a bit forward like 10 steps in order to
02:50 - make it a bit more
02:50 - visible i say 50 steps so that you can
02:53 - see
02:54 - the change so creates a clone
02:58 - and moves 10 steps
03:01 - now if i want this cloning to be
03:04 - repeated
03:05 - i can use the repeat or
03:09 - any of these codes that can be used for
03:12 - repeating
03:13 - things i prefer to choose this one
03:15 - repeat
03:16 - 10 times for instance or 15 times
03:20 - now i can create another clone
03:24 - so i go to the control create
03:28 - clone of myself again so i start as a
03:31 - clone i move 10 steps
03:33 - and then i keep repeating creating
03:35 - another clone let's see how
03:37 - it works
03:40 - i press start you see very quickly
03:44 - 15 clones are created
03:47 - but i don't see all of it because it's
03:49 - outside this
03:51 - in this stage
03:54 - in order to make it more like animation
03:57 - i can put a weight in between this
04:00 - so i go to control again
04:05 - and then there is this weight so i say
04:10 - first wait maybe half a second or
04:14 - 0.3 seconds and then create a clone so
04:17 - now let's see how it works
04:20 - now you see super cool
04:23 - okay so this was one way that we can use
04:26 - cloning to create visual effects now
04:29 - let's do
04:31 - let's see more examples let's see some
04:34 - more
04:34 - visual effects that you can create with
04:37 - this code to make it more interesting
04:41 - in order to do that i go to the looks
04:46 - and then let's say
04:49 - after creating each clone
04:52 - i want to give it some color effects so
04:56 - i can create after i created the clone
04:59 - of myself i go to
05:01 - change color effect by 25 so
05:04 - i play start you see this colorful
05:10 - characters are created
05:13 - and then another thing we can do
05:18 - we can change the size so if i drag this
05:21 - here
05:23 - change size by 10 so i expect that
05:28 - the next clone would be 10 times bigger
05:30 - than the
05:31 - first the previous one so if i click
05:33 - start
05:36 - this is what i see uh
05:40 - one thing that i can do
05:43 - let's reduce the repetitions maybe make
05:46 - it five so that we can see
05:49 - uh more clearly what's going on and then
05:54 - i want the new clone that is created
05:57 - don't go
05:58 - under the previous clone i want it to go
06:00 - on top of it so
06:03 - now you see everything goes
06:07 - under the previous clone but i wanted to
06:09 - go on top of the other one so
06:12 - i can use the code go to front layer so
06:15 - move 50 steps
06:18 - or maybe less steps 10 steps and then
06:22 - go on front of go to the front layer so
06:25 - let's play so it goes on top of the
06:28 - other one
06:30 - so the overall strategy
06:34 - of using clones is initially
06:39 - when you click the start you create a
06:41 - clone
06:42 - and then you start as a clone and after
06:46 - that you are free to do
06:48 - various things with
06:52 - repeat shapes and movements
06:55 - so that you can generate amazing
06:58 - animations
07:00 - i'm going to leave the link of this
07:02 - project in the
07:03 - scratch website below in the description
07:06 - so that you can go there and check it
07:07 - out

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome to another tutorial in this tutorial we're going to see how we can create amazing visual effects using clone if you don't know what is clone this is clone okay so like always let's go to scratch.mit.edu and then click create and wait until the interface is opened okay now we are going to see how we can use clone and how we can create visual effects here so we can use this cat but we can also use a different sprite so i delete it because i just prefer difference right so i click on choose a sprite and i use this one so let's go to the event and everything starts with the clicking on the flag so i say once start clicked i want to create a clone of this so under the control there is something called there is a block create a clone of myself so i drag it here so i expect when i click the start a clone of this sprite should be created so i click the clone is created but i don't see it because this clone is under this one so if i drag it i see the other the other one now let's do more things with this clone now that i have created a clone i can use a block of code which is under the control that says when i start as a clone so i drag it here when i start as a clone let's move it away okay when i start as a clone i can do various things with the clone that is created after this quote i want to say for instance move 10 steps so i say move 10 steps so a clone is created and it's moving a bit forward like 10 steps in order to make it a bit more visible i say 50 steps so that you can see the change so creates a clone and moves 10 steps now if i want this cloning to be repeated i can use the repeat or any of these codes that can be used for repeating things i prefer to choose this one repeat 10 times for instance or 15 times now i can create another clone so i go to the control create clone of myself again so i start as a clone i move 10 steps and then i keep repeating creating another clone let's see how it works i press start you see very quickly 15 clones are created but i don't see all of it because it's outside this in this stage in order to make it more like animation i can put a weight in between this so i go to control again and then there is this weight so i say first wait maybe half a second or 0.3 seconds and then create a clone so now let's see how it works now you see super cool okay so this was one way that we can use cloning to create visual effects now let's do let's see more examples let's see some more visual effects that you can create with this code to make it more interesting in order to do that i go to the looks and then let's say after creating each clone i want to give it some color effects so i can create after i created the clone of myself i go to change color effect by 25 so i play start you see this colorful characters are created and then another thing we can do we can change the size so if i drag this here change size by 10 so i expect that the next clone would be 10 times bigger than the first the previous one so if i click start this is what i see uh one thing that i can do let's reduce the repetitions maybe make it five so that we can see uh more clearly what's going on and then i want the new clone that is created don't go under the previous clone i want it to go on top of it so now you see everything goes under the previous clone but i wanted to go on top of the other one so i can use the code go to front layer so move 50 steps or maybe less steps 10 steps and then go on front of go to the front layer so let's play so it goes on top of the other one so the overall strategy of using clones is initially when you click the start you create a clone and then you start as a clone and after that you are free to do various things with repeat shapes and movements so that you can generate amazing animations i'm going to leave the link of this project in the scratch website below in the description so that you can go there and check it out feel free to ask your questions on the comment below if you have any i'm happy to help you happy learning if you liked the video don't forget to like subscribe and hit the bell so that you won't miss another tutorial see you next week
