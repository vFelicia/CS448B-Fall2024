00:01 - hello hello hello how are you doing
00:03 - i hope you are all feeling awesome
00:07 - welcome back to another tutorial in this
00:09 - tutorial we are going to create
00:11 - a wonderful artwork
00:14 - which is drawing with diamond
00:18 - let's dive in in order to get started
00:23 - we say goodbye to this cat
00:26 - bye and then we go here
00:32 - and then we are going to add an
00:33 - extension which is
00:35 - pen with this pen extension
00:39 - we can do lots of amazing things
00:44 - so let's see one example
00:49 - before we start i'm gonna show you a
00:51 - quick demo
00:52 - of one of the things that you can create
00:55 - with pen so
00:58 - let's click start and you see
01:03 - this is so wonderful would you like to
01:06 - see how to make this
01:09 - stay tuned welcome to kirikou
01:14 - ninja tutorial this is eddie and this
01:17 - is your place to learn to code and have
01:19 - fun
01:20 - well we got rid of the cat and we have
01:23 - no sprites
01:24 - so let's go here and choose something
01:28 - i have chosen
01:33 - this crystal but you can obviously
01:37 - choose whatever your heart desires
01:40 - so let's start with this
01:44 - first thing first when
01:47 - start clicked we want something
01:51 - to happen which is
01:55 - so first of all we when i clear the
01:57 - screen
01:58 - so that you can start with this part
02:02 - with nothing in it so
02:05 - in order to go to do that i go to
02:10 - pen again and there is an option
02:13 - of erase all
02:17 - so as you saw in the demo what was
02:20 - happening
02:21 - was something kept being repeated
02:25 - so i go to control and i
02:29 - drag forever because i'm thinking of a
02:32 - repetitive behavior
02:35 - which is this
02:38 - cool feature stamp so i'm gonna forever
02:41 - stamp
02:43 - with this sprite and i'm
02:46 - also gonna stamp and move
02:50 - so like move 10 steps
02:53 - let's run it and see so this
02:56 - is so far now it's time to
03:00 - enhance it i want it to be colorful so
03:05 - i go to motion not motion sorry go to
03:09 - looks
03:11 - and i'm gonna change color
03:15 - effect by let's say
03:23 - by 5 or 10
03:27 - let's see how it looks like oopsies
03:31 - okay let's fix the location
03:34 - so i want it to rotate or like i want it
03:38 - to follow my mouse
03:40 - let's go to motion
03:43 - and drag this point two arts
03:47 - mouse pointer now it looks like this
03:51 - pretty cool isn't it but we can keep
03:54 - enhancing
03:54 - it so in order to do that i'm
03:58 - gonna turn
04:01 - another motion
04:06 - turn turn turn
04:09 - so every time
04:12 - that i'm in this loop i want to turn it
04:16 - some amount like
04:20 - not 15 degree to make it even more
04:24 - interesting i can turn it
04:27 - some like random number
04:31 - 15 to 30
04:34 - so the diamond is turning around
04:40 - it's also a bit small so you can also
04:43 - change the size to
04:48 - [Music]
04:52 - it's a hundred percent means exactly
04:54 - this
04:55 - size but i'm also gonna do that
04:58 - some random number more uh the more
05:02 - random the more random numbers we add
05:07 - the pattern is gonna be more exciting
05:10 - that's what i think so maybe 150
05:14 - to 300 so some are smaller and somewhere
05:19 - bigger so you see how cool it is
05:22 - one more thing that i can do to create
05:26 - more applications out of that like being
05:29 - able for instance to write with this
05:32 - is i should be able to discontinue
05:35 - uh creating patterns let's say i want to
05:38 - write my name
05:40 - i write e and then i want to go to the
05:43 - next letter so i want to be able to stop
05:46 - it
05:46 - and then continue from here
05:50 - so what if i if i just stop it
05:53 - and press start everything is gonna be
05:55 - deleted so i need a different solution
05:57 - which i'm gonna
05:59 - show you now i go to
06:02 - i'm gonna write a condition i would say
06:06 - if
06:09 - from sensing if mouse is down
06:13 - when i left click on my mouse and hold
06:16 - it
06:17 - in that condition i would say
06:21 - pen up so in that situation it won't
06:25 - write so it's gonna help me to be able
06:28 - to go to the next letter so
06:30 - now i'm gonna write oops again
06:34 - i'm gonna write e and now i wanna stop
06:38 - it so i hold my mouse
06:41 - and then i put it here so i don't hold
06:44 - and release i keep holding it
06:46 - and then i write the next letter
06:49 - and again i'm gonna repeat it not much
06:53 - space for me but i could write two
06:56 - letters
06:58 - okay i hope you
