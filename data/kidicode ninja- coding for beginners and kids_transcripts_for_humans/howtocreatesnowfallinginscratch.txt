00:08 - hello and welcome to kirikou ninja
00:10 - tutorials
00:12 - this is ellie and this is your place to
00:15 - learn to code and have fun
00:18 - like always we go to scratch.edu.mit
00:22 - we are going to create snowfall effect
00:25 - we can add it to our previous session
00:27 - christmas card and christmas light
00:30 - that we created in the last two videos i
00:33 - put a link at the end
00:35 - so that you can go and check them out
00:37 - but now we're going to see how we can
00:39 - create
00:39 - snowfall so we go to scratch dot
00:45 - we create we click on the create on the
00:48 - top left corner
00:52 - we wait for the page to load and then
00:55 - after the page was loaded we
00:59 - have two blocks of
01:02 - codes one for creating the
01:06 - snow and the other part for falling down
01:09 - the snow
01:10 - so let's give our project a proper name
01:14 - so i give it the name snow
01:18 - fall i delete the
01:22 - cat and then i want to choose
01:26 - a backdrop
01:27 - [Music]
01:29 - which is
01:33 - winter and i also need
01:36 - snow sprite so from the sprites
01:41 - i choose
01:45 - snow flakes
01:54 - i make it a bit smaller
01:57 - size 20. i'm also gonna
02:01 - change my backdrop color
02:04 - so that the snow flake is visible on it
02:07 - so
02:08 - i click on the backdrops
02:11 - tab and then
02:17 - from the fill i drag
02:21 - this to the left to make it
02:24 - darker now you can see
02:28 - the snow more clearly go back to the
02:31 - code but also i should click on the
02:34 - sprite
02:34 - because i'm going to write the code for
02:37 - sprite
02:39 - so starting with
02:42 - with when start
02:48 - clicked
02:50 - what i want to happen is first
02:53 - i want to make sure this is shown
02:56 - so i drag show
03:02 - and then the plan is we
03:05 - want this note to go from invisible to
03:08 - visible so it looks like it suddenly
03:11 - appears
03:12 - on the screen so i would go to the
03:15 - lyrics
03:15 - and say set
03:20 - ghost effect
03:24 - assign that change set
03:29 - ghost effect to so i
03:32 - changed the color to ghost
03:39 - to 100 so it becomes completely
03:42 - transparent so like if i click the start
03:45 - you see
03:46 - that the snow is not visible
03:50 - but it's there but it's just the ghost
03:51 - effect is 100
03:54 - and then i want
03:57 - to clone the snow
04:01 - at the top of my screen
04:06 - on random positions so i would say
04:12 - forever
04:15 - from the controller drag forever
04:20 - go to random position
04:23 - i'm temporarily changing this to 20 so
04:25 - that you can see what's going on
04:28 - so first forever go to a random position
04:34 - which from the motion go to random
04:38 - position
04:41 - and then i want to make sure that my
04:43 - snow is always at the top of the screen
04:45 - so i would say
04:48 - go to
04:54 - set y
04:57 - to 180
05:02 - so i click on the start so you see
05:06 - i'm moving the snow
05:09 - at the very top so the y
05:12 - is always 180
05:16 - but the x is changing
05:20 - to random locations at the same time i
05:23 - don't want to only move
05:24 - it i also want to clone it so i would
05:27 - say
05:30 - must be under control
05:35 - create clone of myself so now this
05:38 - snow is cloned in random
05:41 - horizontal locations but always at the
05:44 - very top
05:45 - where the y is 180
05:49 - so see that's what is happening
05:53 - other than this
05:56 - i want two more things i want the snow
05:58 - to come down down down and also
06:01 - move a bit left and right so
06:05 - i'm gonna drag this away
06:08 - now i want to do something with this
06:11 - clone
06:11 - which is coming down and moving around
06:14 - with these clones
06:17 - so i would say when i start
06:20 - as a clone so this is something that is
06:23 - happening to every
06:25 - clone on the screen when i start
06:28 - as a clone first of all
06:33 - i gave the ghost effect at 100 to make
06:37 - it transparent now i want it to
06:39 - be shown so i would say
06:44 - remove the or clear the
06:48 - graphic effects
06:51 - nice cleared now let's write the
06:55 - program the movement so i say forever
07:00 - forever
07:04 - first writing the horizontal movements
07:08 - of the
07:09 - snow so like a bit left
07:12 - and right i would for this i would say
07:16 - change x spy
07:25 - instead of this one from the operators
07:30 - [Music]
07:36 - pick a random i drag pick random
07:42 - between
07:45 - minus one to plus
07:48 - one so the wider this range is
07:52 - the snowflakes are moving more like
07:55 - left and right the wider range
07:59 - i can later play with it so that you
08:01 - will see
08:07 - so this is what is happening
08:10 - till and then we also want it to come
08:13 - down as well so
08:14 - i would say change
08:27 - let's say minus four
08:30 - uh the bigger
08:34 - if i exclude the minus the bigger this
08:38 - number is the faster the snow
08:41 - comes down so if it's minus 10 the snow
08:44 - is coming really fast but if it's
08:46 - minus 2 is coming really slow
08:50 - so change y by minus 4
08:54 - and i want the clone to be deleted
08:58 - when it's reached the bottom of the
09:01 - screen
09:02 - so i would say
09:06 - if
09:08 - from the controls
09:13 - [Music]
09:14 - um if why
09:22 - actually from the operators this one
09:26 - i tried this one
09:30 - if y is less than 175 almost
09:36 - close to the bottom bottom in that case
09:41 - i want the clone i want the clone to be
09:44 - deleted
09:45 - so
09:48 - on the control we have delete this clone
09:53 - so when it reaches here it needs to be
09:56 - deleted so let's run it
09:58 - beautiful snowfall what you can do with
10:02 - this
10:03 - is you can combine this with
10:07 - the previous video christmas card or
10:11 - christmas
10:11 - light or three of them together and
10:14 - create
10:15 - a very interesting christmas card
10:19 - and send it to someone that you care
10:20 - about them
10:23 - [Music]
10:26 - don't forget to share your projects on
10:28 - the comment
10:29 - i would love to see them if you liked
10:31 - the video don't forget to like subscribe
10:34 - and hit the bell so that you won't miss
10:36 - another tutorial see you next week

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome to kirikou ninja tutorials this is ellie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun like always we go to scratch.edu.mit we are going to create snowfall effect we can add it to our previous session christmas card and christmas light that we created in the last two videos i put a link at the end so that you can go and check them out but now we're going to see how we can create snowfall so we go to scratch dot we create we click on the create on the top left corner we wait for the page to load and then after the page was loaded we have two blocks of codes one for creating the snow and the other part for falling down the snow so let's give our project a proper name so i give it the name snow fall i delete the cat and then i want to choose a backdrop which is winter and i also need snow sprite so from the sprites i choose snow flakes i make it a bit smaller size 20. i'm also gonna change my backdrop color so that the snow flake is visible on it so i click on the backdrops tab and then from the fill i drag this to the left to make it darker now you can see the snow more clearly go back to the code but also i should click on the sprite because i'm going to write the code for sprite so starting with with when start clicked what i want to happen is first i want to make sure this is shown so i drag show and then the plan is we want this note to go from invisible to visible so it looks like it suddenly appears on the screen so i would go to the lyrics and say set ghost effect assign that change set ghost effect to so i changed the color to ghost to 100 so it becomes completely transparent so like if i click the start you see that the snow is not visible but it's there but it's just the ghost effect is 100 and then i want to clone the snow at the top of my screen on random positions so i would say forever from the controller drag forever go to random position i'm temporarily changing this to 20 so that you can see what's going on so first forever go to a random position which from the motion go to random position and then i want to make sure that my snow is always at the top of the screen so i would say go to set y to 180 so i click on the start so you see i'm moving the snow at the very top so the y is always 180 but the x is changing to random locations at the same time i don't want to only move it i also want to clone it so i would say must be under control create clone of myself so now this snow is cloned in random horizontal locations but always at the very top where the y is 180 so see that's what is happening other than this i want two more things i want the snow to come down down down and also move a bit left and right so i'm gonna drag this away now i want to do something with this clone which is coming down and moving around with these clones so i would say when i start as a clone so this is something that is happening to every clone on the screen when i start as a clone first of all i gave the ghost effect at 100 to make it transparent now i want it to be shown so i would say remove the or clear the graphic effects nice cleared now let's write the program the movement so i say forever forever first writing the horizontal movements of the snow so like a bit left and right i would for this i would say change x spy instead of this one from the operators pick a random i drag pick random between minus one to plus one so the wider this range is the snowflakes are moving more like left and right the wider range i can later play with it so that you will see so this is what is happening till and then we also want it to come down as well so i would say change let's say minus four uh the bigger if i exclude the minus the bigger this number is the faster the snow comes down so if it's minus 10 the snow is coming really fast but if it's minus 2 is coming really slow so change y by minus 4 and i want the clone to be deleted when it's reached the bottom of the screen so i would say if from the controls um if why actually from the operators this one i tried this one if y is less than 175 almost close to the bottom bottom in that case i want the clone i want the clone to be deleted so on the control we have delete this clone so when it reaches here it needs to be deleted so let's run it beautiful snowfall what you can do with this is you can combine this with the previous video christmas card or christmas light or three of them together and create a very interesting christmas card and send it to someone that you care about them don't forget to share your projects on the comment i would love to see them if you liked the video don't forget to like subscribe and hit the bell so that you won't miss another tutorial see you next week
