00:00 - hello everyone and welcome to this
00:02 - scratch tutorial
00:03 - i'm ellie and this is your place to
00:05 - learn to code and have fun
00:07 - today we are creating the hero fighting
00:10 - against the chrono wireless game
00:12 - this is an easy beginner tutorial if
00:14 - you've never written any code at all
00:16 - this tutorial is for you start you go to
00:18 - the scratch website by searching
00:21 - scratch mit
00:25 - and just click on this link
00:30 - from here if you click on the create
00:35 - it takes you to the scratch development
00:37 - environment let's get a quick tour of
00:39 - this
00:39 - location first this part
00:43 - on the top right where the cat is is
00:46 - called the
00:46 - stage that's where your game
00:50 - actions or generally everything you
00:52 - program takes place here
00:54 - for example if you write a code that
00:57 - tells the cat
00:58 - to move or dance that's where you see
01:00 - the cat is moving
01:02 - or dancing so in the reward
01:06 - here is the location that you see your
01:08 - output
01:10 - the part under the stage is where we see
01:14 - the sprites
01:15 - and backdrops in this part you can add
01:18 - many sprites or delete this
01:20 - rice and also add the backdrops
01:25 - sprites are like characters in your
01:27 - games
01:28 - every sprite such as this cat has three
01:31 - things
01:32 - which takes us to these three items code
01:35 - costumes and sound discolorful sections
01:40 - that look like pieces of puzzle are
01:42 - called code
01:44 - using these codes you can tell the
01:46 - computer what to do
01:49 - the one beside it which is
01:52 - custom using a custom
01:56 - you can tell your character how you want
01:59 - it to look like
02:00 - so like this is one shape this is
02:02 - another shape
02:04 - and then from sounds you can add as many
02:06 - sounds as you like like
02:08 - mew
02:08 - [Music]
02:14 - alright so let's get back to writing our
02:18 - code
02:19 - first thing we're going to do today is
02:21 - you're going to remove this cat by
02:23 - clicking on this
02:24 - pin and now we are going to add
02:28 - two new sprites
02:31 - one is a hero and the other one is the
02:34 - chrono virus
02:35 - for the hero i just click here and then
02:38 - i go to the sprite library
02:42 - then i can filter down to people maybe
02:46 - and then i just keep searching and see
02:48 - which one looks like
02:50 - that is like a hero maybe this one
02:52 - looking strong
02:54 - okay let's take this first so this is my
02:57 - hero my hero
02:59 - has several customs
03:02 - that's what we want so this is cool
03:06 - and then i need one more thing i need
03:10 - one other character for my chrono virus
03:14 - this is something that i made up so it
03:16 - doesn't exist in this library
03:18 - so we need to create it the way we can
03:21 - do it in scratch
03:23 - you see this paint i can open the paint
03:27 - and create and draw it by myself
03:31 - so i just take a circle from here
03:36 - i draw a circle
03:40 - and then i draw one more smaller circle
03:46 - i press ctrl c to copy it
03:49 - and then i press ctrl ctrl b multiple
03:52 - times to generate
03:54 - several of it and then i lay them around
04:01 - to make it look like a virus
04:03 - alternatively you can just go to google
04:06 - image
04:06 - and download some image into your
04:09 - computer and draw it
04:10 - but then i just wanted to show you how
04:12 - you can draw as well let's put some eyes
04:15 - maybe
04:22 - a mouth an evil one
04:25 - so looks good to me then i press ctrl
04:28 - a i select everything and then i
04:32 - group them together cool
04:36 - so now i have a corona virus and a hero
04:41 - i go here and duplicate this
04:45 - and then i reshape it so that i have two
04:47 - variation of it like two customs
04:50 - so i press ctrl a and then i squish it a
04:54 - bit
04:54 - so that when i'm writing my game i have
04:58 - two different versions like
05:02 - of the coronavirus with two customs okay
05:05 - cool
05:09 - the goal of this mini game is we want
05:11 - this virus to move around
05:14 - and then we want this hero to follow the
05:17 - virus
05:18 - in order to do that we need to write a
05:20 - code for it
05:22 - because computers do not know what to do
05:25 - unless we tell them what to do the same
05:28 - thing for this virus
05:29 - this virus is pretty stupid it doesn't
05:32 - know what to do
05:32 - until we tell them so let's write a code
05:36 - for it the first step in my code is i
05:39 - want to say
05:40 - when this flag is clicked
05:44 - i want something to happen so i go to
05:46 - the code
05:47 - section and then we have various groups
05:50 - of codes
05:52 - i'm talking about an event like when
05:55 - flag
05:55 - clicked so let's look at the events
05:58 - section
05:59 - i have this block so i drag it here when
06:02 - flag is clicked
06:06 - next step is i want the wires to point
06:09 - towards my
06:11 - mouse pointer this is the kind of
06:13 - emotion so let's go to the motion
06:17 - and see what we've got here we have
06:21 - point towards mouse pointer so i drag it
06:24 - here
06:25 - so my expectation is when i click here
06:28 - earth should
06:29 - point towards my mouse pointer with it
06:32 - which it did
06:39 - what happens right now is that this
06:42 - virus points toward my mouse pointer
06:45 - kind of turns around it but it doesn't
06:48 - move towards it i want it to also move
06:50 - towards my mouse pointer so
06:52 - i add one more line of code here i go to
06:55 - the motion category because i'm
06:57 - talking about movement so i drag this
07:00 - move 10 steps
07:02 - and now it moves what this 10
07:05 - step says that is whenever you read this
07:08 - line of code
07:09 - come for move 10 steps so i can adjust
07:12 - this
07:14 - the speed by changing this number to
07:17 - make it faster
07:19 - or make it slower
07:28 - but you see we have a little problem
07:30 - here
07:32 - when the wires get so close to my mouse
07:34 - pointer it makes this
07:35 - a little crazy dance
07:39 - let's try to fix this as well in order
07:41 - to fix
07:42 - this we can
07:45 - say maybe we just don't let the virus to
07:48 - get close to the pointer so we say
07:51 - only move point towards the mouse
07:53 - pointer and move 10 steps only in the
07:55 - condition that the distance between the
07:57 - mouse
07:58 - pointer and the virus is more than a
08:01 - certain amount so
08:03 - let's go to the if conditions from the
08:06 - controls and drag this if then
08:11 - around the forever so
08:16 - this should go out
08:20 - forever do do the things only if
08:23 - some condition is available
08:28 - and then i define the condition by using
08:31 - the greater
08:32 - block operator and the distance from the
08:35 - sensing group
08:36 - so i go to the operator and then i
08:40 - take greater than i put it in here
08:45 - and then from the sensing
08:48 - i take this distance to mass pointer
08:51 - so i'm saying if the distance to mouse
08:54 - pointer is more than
08:55 - 50 unit only in this condition
08:59 - you are required to do this steps
09:02 - so see what happens so now you say it's
09:05 - a bit better
09:05 - it doesn't get too close but it can be
09:08 - even more
09:10 - to make it more stable and maybe
09:13 - even more
09:18 - now i like it better so we play with it
09:22 - until we get to our desired number
09:24 - let's program our hero which is this guy
09:29 - in scratch is called batter but we want
09:31 - to rename it to hero
09:33 - so from here i change the sprite name to
09:37 - hero
09:40 - [Music]
09:42 - what we want this hero to do is chase
09:44 - the wires
09:45 - and smash it this is quite similar to
09:48 - what we did for the virus
09:50 - so we say when the start clicked
09:59 - point towards the
10:03 - so let's go to the motions
10:07 - points where this time you want to point
10:10 - point towards the
10:11 - wires not the mouse pointer so i change
10:14 - it to a point
10:16 - towards the chrono virus
10:21 - and move for instance
10:24 - 10 steps and the same as last time
10:28 - we want it to happen forever so
10:30 - constantly do these things
10:32 - i don't want to click start every moment
10:36 - so here and this should go inside
10:44 - let's see how it works
10:48 - here we go now we also want to do one
10:53 - more thing
10:54 - we want the virus to be squashed and
10:57 - make some noise
10:58 - when the hero hits it so let's go back
11:00 - to the virus again
11:06 - for smashing the wires we can use
11:09 - customs because that's where we can
11:11 - control the shape of sprites the
11:14 - precondition for smashing the wires
11:16 - is being hit by the hero so let's read
11:19 - it like this
11:20 - we need an if then block from control
11:26 - so here we go
11:29 - just like right after the moves and
11:32 - everything
11:40 - and then the condition can be dragged
11:43 - from the sensing group
11:44 - here touching hero is what we need
11:48 - so from the sensing
11:52 - touching
11:55 - the hero i put it here
11:59 - so in case the virus is touching the
12:02 - hero we want something to happen
12:04 - which is getting a new custom
12:07 - since custom is relevant to the looks i
12:10 - go here
12:12 - and then i say next costume vote next
12:15 - costume
12:16 - and then maybe wait a bit
12:22 - stay in that shape for
12:27 - a short time maybe
12:33 - 0.2 seconds and then again
12:38 - next costume
12:43 - let's see how it works
12:48 - yeah so it's being smashed when the
12:51 - battery is hitting it but it's just
12:53 - pretty quick maybe i can make it a
12:55 - little bit
12:57 - slower so that we can see what is
12:59 - actually happening
13:02 - weight maybe 0.6
13:08 - here and here
13:12 - yeah that's what i want super cool right
13:21 - looking at the way this hero is moving
13:24 - it looks like it's just gliding
13:26 - it doesn't really look like it's moving
13:28 - what we want is
13:30 - we wanted to move that stick so that it
13:32 - can smash the wires
13:34 - we also can do this by using a costume
13:37 - like last time
13:38 - so dragging the
13:42 - next costume from the looks
13:46 - here
13:50 - now it looks like it's actually moving
13:54 - that stick in order to make it a little
13:57 - slower
13:59 - i can add a weight here
14:06 - so that i can see the movements easier
14:09 - maybe not not so long
14:18 - like this
14:24 - there are more things we can do to make
14:26 - this more interesting
14:28 - let's say we want a hero to say go away
14:32 - and also make a kind of like a pop
14:36 - noise when it touches the virus so let's
14:39 - create a second module of code
14:41 - so that this one doesn't get super long
14:45 - alright i say when
14:49 - the flag is clicked
14:52 - forever
14:56 - if so i want to condition if
15:02 - the distance to chronovirus
15:07 - um in the
15:14 - here i drag this
15:18 - and then under sensing i choose what i'm
15:21 - measuring the distance again
15:23 - against it so i want to say if the
15:25 - distance to chrono virus
15:28 - is less than
15:32 - 20 and that's in that case
15:36 - i wanted to make some noise or play some
15:39 - sound
15:41 - play sound pop
15:45 - until done so let's see what happens
15:56 - it's just pretty too a bit too much
15:59 - when it's so close so i put a weight
16:03 - after it
16:04 - so that it plays and it also waits
16:10 - where it is here under control and then
16:12 - i added weight
16:19 - i also want to add a kind of a note on
16:22 - top of the
16:23 - hero to say go away so i go to the looks
16:28 - we have this like say
16:36 - i can put it here
16:39 - i change it to say go away
16:44 - for two seconds for instance let's test
16:48 - it
16:50 - way is coming a bit late that's because
16:54 - it should
16:55 - it doesn't need to wait here
17:00 - now it's better it's pretty cool
17:03 - isn't it
17:08 - oops let's fix this type also
17:13 - go away we can also add a backdrop
17:18 - i can add it from here
17:23 - i have all things so i can choose
17:26 - whatever i want
17:28 - we have hero we have virus which one
17:30 - seems more
17:32 - relevant um
17:36 - maybe a just blue sky
17:48 - oh such a cool game we made together
17:52 - i'm so proud of you this was a nice
17:55 - beginner tutorial that showed you some
17:58 - fundamentals of coding such as
18:00 - loops conditions controls
18:02 - troubleshooting
18:03 - and doing more of this stuff can
18:05 - definitely improve your analytical
18:08 - skills and with
18:09 - practice you can write even more awesome
18:12 - and complex games comment below what
18:15 - else you think we can do
18:16 - to make it more fun do you see any issue
18:19 - or bugs here
18:20 - also if you like this video press that
18:23 - little bell icon and subscribe
18:25 - so that you can see my new videos well
18:28 - done everyone and hope to see you
18:30 - soon for another scratch tutorial bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone and welcome to this scratch tutorial i'm ellie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun today we are creating the hero fighting against the chrono wireless game this is an easy beginner tutorial if you've never written any code at all this tutorial is for you start you go to the scratch website by searching scratch mit and just click on this link from here if you click on the create it takes you to the scratch development environment let's get a quick tour of this location first this part on the top right where the cat is is called the stage that's where your game actions or generally everything you program takes place here for example if you write a code that tells the cat to move or dance that's where you see the cat is moving or dancing so in the reward here is the location that you see your output the part under the stage is where we see the sprites and backdrops in this part you can add many sprites or delete this rice and also add the backdrops sprites are like characters in your games every sprite such as this cat has three things which takes us to these three items code costumes and sound discolorful sections that look like pieces of puzzle are called code using these codes you can tell the computer what to do the one beside it which is custom using a custom you can tell your character how you want it to look like so like this is one shape this is another shape and then from sounds you can add as many sounds as you like like mew alright so let's get back to writing our code first thing we're going to do today is you're going to remove this cat by clicking on this pin and now we are going to add two new sprites one is a hero and the other one is the chrono virus for the hero i just click here and then i go to the sprite library then i can filter down to people maybe and then i just keep searching and see which one looks like that is like a hero maybe this one looking strong okay let's take this first so this is my hero my hero has several customs that's what we want so this is cool and then i need one more thing i need one other character for my chrono virus this is something that i made up so it doesn't exist in this library so we need to create it the way we can do it in scratch you see this paint i can open the paint and create and draw it by myself so i just take a circle from here i draw a circle and then i draw one more smaller circle i press ctrl c to copy it and then i press ctrl ctrl b multiple times to generate several of it and then i lay them around to make it look like a virus alternatively you can just go to google image and download some image into your computer and draw it but then i just wanted to show you how you can draw as well let's put some eyes maybe a mouth an evil one so looks good to me then i press ctrl a i select everything and then i group them together cool so now i have a corona virus and a hero i go here and duplicate this and then i reshape it so that i have two variation of it like two customs so i press ctrl a and then i squish it a bit so that when i'm writing my game i have two different versions like of the coronavirus with two customs okay cool the goal of this mini game is we want this virus to move around and then we want this hero to follow the virus in order to do that we need to write a code for it because computers do not know what to do unless we tell them what to do the same thing for this virus this virus is pretty stupid it doesn't know what to do until we tell them so let's write a code for it the first step in my code is i want to say when this flag is clicked i want something to happen so i go to the code section and then we have various groups of codes i'm talking about an event like when flag clicked so let's look at the events section i have this block so i drag it here when flag is clicked next step is i want the wires to point towards my mouse pointer this is the kind of emotion so let's go to the motion and see what we've got here we have point towards mouse pointer so i drag it here so my expectation is when i click here earth should point towards my mouse pointer with it which it did what happens right now is that this virus points toward my mouse pointer kind of turns around it but it doesn't move towards it i want it to also move towards my mouse pointer so i add one more line of code here i go to the motion category because i'm talking about movement so i drag this move 10 steps and now it moves what this 10 step says that is whenever you read this line of code come for move 10 steps so i can adjust this the speed by changing this number to make it faster or make it slower but you see we have a little problem here when the wires get so close to my mouse pointer it makes this a little crazy dance let's try to fix this as well in order to fix this we can say maybe we just don't let the virus to get close to the pointer so we say only move point towards the mouse pointer and move 10 steps only in the condition that the distance between the mouse pointer and the virus is more than a certain amount so let's go to the if conditions from the controls and drag this if then around the forever so this should go out forever do do the things only if some condition is available and then i define the condition by using the greater block operator and the distance from the sensing group so i go to the operator and then i take greater than i put it in here and then from the sensing i take this distance to mass pointer so i'm saying if the distance to mouse pointer is more than 50 unit only in this condition you are required to do this steps so see what happens so now you say it's a bit better it doesn't get too close but it can be even more to make it more stable and maybe even more now i like it better so we play with it until we get to our desired number let's program our hero which is this guy in scratch is called batter but we want to rename it to hero so from here i change the sprite name to hero what we want this hero to do is chase the wires and smash it this is quite similar to what we did for the virus so we say when the start clicked point towards the so let's go to the motions points where this time you want to point point towards the wires not the mouse pointer so i change it to a point towards the chrono virus and move for instance 10 steps and the same as last time we want it to happen forever so constantly do these things i don't want to click start every moment so here and this should go inside let's see how it works here we go now we also want to do one more thing we want the virus to be squashed and make some noise when the hero hits it so let's go back to the virus again for smashing the wires we can use customs because that's where we can control the shape of sprites the precondition for smashing the wires is being hit by the hero so let's read it like this we need an if then block from control so here we go just like right after the moves and everything and then the condition can be dragged from the sensing group here touching hero is what we need so from the sensing touching the hero i put it here so in case the virus is touching the hero we want something to happen which is getting a new custom since custom is relevant to the looks i go here and then i say next costume vote next costume and then maybe wait a bit stay in that shape for a short time maybe 0.2 seconds and then again next costume let's see how it works yeah so it's being smashed when the battery is hitting it but it's just pretty quick maybe i can make it a little bit slower so that we can see what is actually happening weight maybe 0.6 here and here yeah that's what i want super cool right looking at the way this hero is moving it looks like it's just gliding it doesn't really look like it's moving what we want is we wanted to move that stick so that it can smash the wires we also can do this by using a costume like last time so dragging the next costume from the looks here now it looks like it's actually moving that stick in order to make it a little slower i can add a weight here so that i can see the movements easier maybe not not so long like this there are more things we can do to make this more interesting let's say we want a hero to say go away and also make a kind of like a pop noise when it touches the virus so let's create a second module of code so that this one doesn't get super long alright i say when the flag is clicked forever if so i want to condition if the distance to chronovirus um in the here i drag this and then under sensing i choose what i'm measuring the distance again against it so i want to say if the distance to chrono virus is less than 20 and that's in that case i wanted to make some noise or play some sound play sound pop until done so let's see what happens it's just pretty too a bit too much when it's so close so i put a weight after it so that it plays and it also waits where it is here under control and then i added weight i also want to add a kind of a note on top of the hero to say go away so i go to the looks we have this like say i can put it here i change it to say go away for two seconds for instance let's test it way is coming a bit late that's because it should it doesn't need to wait here now it's better it's pretty cool isn't it oops let's fix this type also go away we can also add a backdrop i can add it from here i have all things so i can choose whatever i want we have hero we have virus which one seems more relevant um maybe a just blue sky oh such a cool game we made together i'm so proud of you this was a nice beginner tutorial that showed you some fundamentals of coding such as loops conditions controls troubleshooting and doing more of this stuff can definitely improve your analytical skills and with practice you can write even more awesome and complex games comment below what else you think we can do to make it more fun do you see
