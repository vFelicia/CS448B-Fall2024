00:00 - hello everyone what's up i hope you are
00:02 - all feeling
00:03 - wonderful i'm very excited today today
00:07 - i'm gonna collaborate with chris
00:09 - from one of the most popular scratch
00:11 - tutorial channels on youtube
00:13 - which is coding with chris
00:18 - if you've been doing scratch for a while
00:20 - most probably you have already came
00:22 - across this channel
00:23 - if not i'm gonna put the link to his
00:25 - channel on the description below
00:27 - make sure to go there and check it out i
00:29 - really encourage you to go there and
00:31 - check it out and subscribe
00:33 - it's full of really cool tutorials what
00:36 - i love most about his channel is that
00:38 - over there you can
00:39 - learn to create existing
00:42 - games and lots of cool stuff like big
00:45 - projects
00:46 - and you can put into practice whatever
00:49 - you've learned here
00:50 - or anywhere else about scratch
00:54 - welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this
00:57 - is eddie and this is your place to learn
01:00 - to code and have fun
01:02 - hello to the scratchers on earth how are
01:04 - you guys doing today hope you're all
01:05 - doing fantastic uh but today's video is
01:07 - going to be a little bit of javascript
01:09 - and a little bit of
01:10 - scratch so we're going to compare the
01:11 - two and see how
01:13 - they compare all right so stick around
01:15 - to learn a little bit recently
01:17 - i've been having so much fun with
01:20 - scratch programming i made games
01:22 - animation lots of really cool things
01:25 - you know what i love most about it it
01:27 - was that i didn't need to
01:29 - type a lot of things most things were
01:31 - blocks of code i could drag
01:33 - them put them together and tada a cool
01:36 - project was made
01:38 - so easy so much fun but then
01:42 - i was wondering what if i want to do
01:45 - something more what if i want to make a
01:47 - more powerful
01:48 - program like a web application a game
01:51 - that i can solve
01:52 - something that i can share it with the
01:54 - whole world but not only with scratch
01:57 - community
01:58 - then i had a chat with chris and we
02:01 - decided to give it a try
02:04 - we decided to write the same program in
02:06 - scratch
02:07 - and in javascript to see how it would
02:10 - look
02:10 - like if you want to transition from
02:13 - scratch programming
02:14 - to a more real programming language
02:19 - if you two are on the same boat join us
02:22 - in this video to see
02:23 - how we convert a code from scratch
02:27 - to javascript let's dive in let's say
02:30 - when i have a counter
02:32 - that counts from
02:35 - 0 to 10.
02:40 - i'm gonna delete this cat it's always
02:43 - there i don't want it so
02:46 - first thing i need a variable to use it
02:50 - as a counter i'm going to create a
02:52 - variable
02:54 - i make a variable i name it i
02:58 - so there is a counter here i can click
03:01 - here
03:02 - to make it bigger version
03:05 - so what i'm gonna do is i start from
03:08 - zero
03:09 - so i set i to zero
03:14 - and then
03:18 - i'm going to repeat something 10 times
03:22 - so i'm going to say repeat until
03:26 - a condition is met
03:30 - what i want to happen what i want to do
03:33 - is
03:34 - i'm increasing this number so i would
03:38 - say
03:39 - change i by 1
03:45 - and before changing i want to show the
03:48 - eyes well and also i need to set the
03:53 - condition
03:54 - to clarify how many times i want it to
03:58 - happen so i go to operator
04:03 - if i want it to go until 10
04:07 - so i say repeat this until
04:10 - i is
04:15 - until you get to the point that i is
04:17 - more than 9 so i drag
04:19 - this
04:23 - and then i put i here
04:26 - from variable and nine
04:30 - so if i count from zero to nine
04:35 - it's gonna
04:39 - repeat this show variable and change
04:42 - change by 1 10 times what happens
04:46 - is this number is changed super quickly
04:49 - so i'm gonna put weights in between so
04:52 - that i can see
04:54 - the changes so i
04:57 - show i wait and i also put a weight here
05:01 - so that i see so i'm clicking here so
05:04 - that i can see the changes
05:05 - every one second this number is being
05:09 - changed chris can you show
05:14 - us how would it look like if i want to
05:17 - write this
05:18 - in javascript all right ellie so
05:22 - you just created basically a counter so
05:24 - and i need to do that
05:25 - in uh javascript uh so i'm gonna
05:28 - actually
05:28 - change my uh environment you guys can
05:31 - also
05:32 - go and follow this uh website uh it's
05:34 - called playcode.io
05:36 - it's a good place to do javascript if
05:38 - you're just getting started because
05:40 - one good thing that it has it has this
05:41 - kind of live feature where i can just
05:43 - kind of do things
05:44 - i can see things live and this console
05:48 - part is basically where we're going to
05:50 - see the result now it's
05:51 - not as visual as you know
05:55 - scratch you guys probably already know
05:57 - that javascript and this kind of
05:58 - language
05:59 - normally are not as visual but anyways
06:01 - let's let's actually create the counter
06:03 - so
06:04 - you know inside of uh ellie's tutorial
06:08 - just now
06:08 - uh she created a variable called i but
06:11 - why do we call it an i will
06:13 - i is normally what's called an iterator
06:15 - all right
06:16 - and inside of javascript if you want to
06:18 - create a um
06:20 - a for loop basically or a repeat
06:23 - function a repeat
06:24 - loop you would want to create an
06:27 - iterator that will keep
06:28 - a a record of the count of the iteration
06:31 - so
06:31 - i'll say 4 and then we'll say
06:36 - i equals to 0 so this is where we
06:39 - actually
06:40 - declare i and then we will separate the
06:42 - next part with a
06:44 - semicolon and then here we want to say
06:46 - how long we want
06:47 - this for loop to repeat so this is a
06:50 - condition that it needs to keep in mind
06:52 - so i want to say
06:53 - repeat until i is smaller
06:56 - than um you know well
07:00 - let's do i smaller than 10 okay
07:05 - so this this is going to go until 9 but
07:07 - you're going to see in a second
07:08 - and then well what do i want to do every
07:10 - time well
07:11 - all i want to do is to what i want to do
07:15 - after each iteration i want to add one
07:17 - to i so instead of
07:19 - a javascript uh variable name
07:22 - plus plus basically does the same thing
07:24 - as
07:25 - scratch where you say change variable by
07:28 - one you know so it's the same thing this
07:31 - this
07:31 - this one thing is doing the same job as
07:34 - that and then we need to open and close
07:36 - curly braces
07:37 - and here i'm gonna do console.log
07:42 - i okay so let me go live here
07:45 - you'll see that instantly it will print
07:47 - out the
07:48 - numbers zero to nine now of course if i
07:51 - wanted to do
07:52 - one to ten all you need to do is to say
07:55 - start from one so the first i is going
07:58 - to be equal to one
07:59 - okay but then we want to do until 10
08:02 - right so there's two ways you can go
08:04 - about this
08:05 - you can either change this one to 11 so
08:07 - it will go until 10. so
08:09 - i smaller than 11 the last one would be
08:13 - 10 right
08:13 - so it's going to print until 10 or you
08:15 - could say i
08:17 - smaller or equal to 10 and then this is
08:20 - gonna
08:21 - go ahead and print the same kind of
08:23 - result for you
08:24 - all right so let's see what else ellie
08:26 - wants to teach us in scratch
08:29 - so let's try something else let's say i
08:32 - have a variable named
08:35 - h so i'm gonna make a variable
08:38 - i name it age and then
08:42 - i ask a question which is
08:48 - let's say how old
08:53 - are you
08:59 - and then i want the answer
09:02 - to be displayed here
09:09 - so again i go back to variables
09:14 - and then i'm gonna set
09:18 - the whatever the answer was
09:21 - i want to assign it to h so i
09:25 - go to
09:28 - sensing again and i'm
09:32 - dragging this here
09:36 - to activate it i can use
09:42 - when start clicked
09:48 - so
09:52 - event when start clicked
09:55 - i click start and then when it asks the
09:58 - question
10:00 - i put a number and the number shows up
10:03 - here so let's see how it looks like in
10:07 - javascript
10:09 - all right so this is another one of my
10:11 - favorite parts
10:12 - of scratch where you can actually ask
10:14 - for somebody's input
10:16 - and then there you know you can do
10:18 - something based on that input now
10:20 - having inputs is actually a part of
10:23 - almost all programming languages input
10:26 - output is basically
10:27 - like one of the basics of every
10:30 - programming language that you're going
10:31 - to learn now in javascript
10:33 - specifically in a front-end javascript
10:35 - there's many
10:36 - ways that you can get an input the
10:38 - simplest way that i can tell you that
10:40 - and that is
10:40 - the the one that is closest to um
10:44 - scratch is to use the function called
10:46 - prompt so if i write the word
10:48 - prompt here all right here i can first
10:52 - of all write a message that i want so
10:53 - i'm going to write a message like
10:55 - uh how old are you
11:00 - all right so if i run this program right
11:03 - now
11:04 - you'll see that this kind of pop-up
11:06 - window comes up and it says how old are
11:08 - you
11:08 - and i'll just kind of let's say i
11:10 - entered the age 10
11:12 - because i'm 10 years old there
11:15 - all right and then but if i you know
11:18 - click ok right now nothing really
11:20 - happens so we need to
11:22 - store this answer somewhere
11:25 - right so what i'll do here is that i'll
11:27 - say i will store this prompt into a
11:29 - variable
11:30 - h so this is how you create a variable
11:34 - let me stop this right now so that it
11:36 - doesn't kind of
11:37 - live reload so this is how you create a
11:39 - variable
11:40 - you write the keyword let
11:43 - all right and then the name of the
11:45 - variable that you want so now i have a
11:47 - variable
11:48 - h and then the value is going to be
11:51 - taken from the prompt okay so again if i
11:55 - run this right now again if i write it
11:58 - you know the h10 and click ok nothing
12:00 - happens
12:01 - because we haven't still shown the
12:04 - output so i have gotten the number
12:06 - as an input but i still need to show it
12:09 - as an output so how can we do that well
12:11 - again
12:12 - we can use the beautiful function of
12:15 - console.log
12:17 - and then here i can simply either say
12:19 - you know h
12:20 - or let's make it a little bit more
12:22 - interesting u
12:24 - r um and then we will say
12:28 - well and then the age
12:31 - and then years old
12:34 - so if i now go live again and then
12:38 - enter 10 here you can look at here here
12:41 - it says
12:42 - you are 10 years old all right now of
12:45 - course you can get creative with this
12:46 - you know like if i say h times um
12:50 - let me let me close it live if i say
12:53 - h times 365 then
12:57 - we can change this one to days and then
13:00 - this is going to tell you
13:01 - how many days old you are so if you're
13:03 - 10 right now
13:04 - you are uh 3 650 days
13:08 - old all right and you can just kind of
13:09 - play around with this variable
13:11 - as you would inside of scratch as well
13:14 - so
13:14 - you can see that there are a lot of
13:16 - similarities between
13:17 - scratch and other programming languages
13:20 - more specifically javascript
13:21 - and it is really worth it to learn all
13:24 - of these similarities before you
13:26 - actually kind of
13:28 - dive deeper into what the language is
13:30 - and and you know how you can how you can
13:32 - use it
13:33 - so the similarities are very interesting
13:35 - to learn so make sure you do that
13:37 - um so yeah this is it for for today's
13:39 - tutorial this was a great uh
13:41 - collaboration that i had with ellie
13:43 - channel she does uh tutorials from time
13:45 - to time
13:46 - specifically for younger learners so if
13:49 - you have any younger
13:50 - siblings make sure you recommend the
13:52 - channel yeah as you saw
13:54 - and as chris said most programming
13:56 - languages have
13:57 - a lot of commonalities when you learn
14:00 - one language it's going to be very easy
14:02 - to switch a different language so if
14:04 - you're a kid
14:06 - and are not comfortable with typing or
14:09 - you're just intimidated with text-based
14:11 - languages
14:12 - or you would rather see things visually
14:15 - or if you if just a scratch is enough
14:17 - for the purpose of what you want to do
14:20 - keep learning scratch keep writing code
14:23 - in scratch and whenever you need it to
14:25 - learn a different language or do more
14:27 - it's going to be very
14:28 - easy for you to learn a different
14:31 - language
14:33 - thank you so much for watching this
14:35 - video again
14:36 - i reiterate make sure to go to
14:40 - chris channel the link is on the
14:42 - description below there are lots of cool
14:44 - tutorials
14:46 - and regular live scratch tutorials
14:51 - i really hope you enjoyed this video if
14:53 - so
14:54 - please press like subscribe and hit the
14:57 - bell so that you won't miss
14:59 - the next tutorial see you soon

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone what's up i hope you are all feeling wonderful i'm very excited today today i'm gonna collaborate with chris from one of the most popular scratch tutorial channels on youtube which is coding with chris if you've been doing scratch for a while most probably you have already came across this channel if not i'm gonna put the link to his channel on the description below make sure to go there and check it out i really encourage you to go there and check it out and subscribe it's full of really cool tutorials what i love most about his channel is that over there you can learn to create existing games and lots of cool stuff like big projects and you can put into practice whatever you've learned here or anywhere else about scratch welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun hello to the scratchers on earth how are you guys doing today hope you're all doing fantastic uh but today's video is going to be a little bit of javascript and a little bit of scratch so we're going to compare the two and see how they compare all right so stick around to learn a little bit recently i've been having so much fun with scratch programming i made games animation lots of really cool things you know what i love most about it it was that i didn't need to type a lot of things most things were blocks of code i could drag them put them together and tada a cool project was made so easy so much fun but then i was wondering what if i want to do something more what if i want to make a more powerful program like a web application a game that i can solve something that i can share it with the whole world but not only with scratch community then i had a chat with chris and we decided to give it a try we decided to write the same program in scratch and in javascript to see how it would look like if you want to transition from scratch programming to a more real programming language if you two are on the same boat join us in this video to see how we convert a code from scratch to javascript let's dive in let's say when i have a counter that counts from 0 to 10. i'm gonna delete this cat it's always there i don't want it so first thing i need a variable to use it as a counter i'm going to create a variable i make a variable i name it i so there is a counter here i can click here to make it bigger version so what i'm gonna do is i start from zero so i set i to zero and then i'm going to repeat something 10 times so i'm going to say repeat until a condition is met what i want to happen what i want to do is i'm

operator if i want it to go until 10 so i say repeat this until i is until you get to the point that i is more than 9 so i drag this and then i put i here from variable and nine so if i count from zero to nine it's gonna repeat this show variable and change change by 1 10 times what happens is this number is changed super quickly so i'm gonna put weights in between so that i can see the changes so i show i wait and i also put a weight here so that i see so i'm clicking here so that i can see the changes every one second this number is being changed chris can you show us how would it look like if i want to write this in javascript all right ellie so you just created basically a counter so and i need to do that in uh javascript uh so i'm gonna actually change my uh environment you guys can also go and follow this uh website uh it's called playcode.io it's a good place to do javascript if you're just getting started because one good thing that it has it has this kind of live feature where i can just kind of do things i can see things live and this console part is basically where we're going to see the result now it's not as visual as you know scratch you guys probably already

we will separate the next part with a semicolon and then here we want to say how long we want this for loop to repeat so this is a condition that it needs to keep in mind so i want to say repeat until i is smaller than um you know well let's do i smaller than 10 okay so this this is going to go until 9 but you're going to see in a second and then well what do i want to do every time well all i want to do is to what i want to do after each iteration i want to add one to i so instead of a javascript uh variable name plus plus basically does the same thing as scratch where you say change variable by one you know so it's the same thing this this this one thing is doing the same job as that and then we need to open and close curly braces and here i'm gonna do console.log i okay so let me go live

right so it's going to print until 10 or you could say i smaller or equal to 10 and then this is gonna go ahead and print the same kind of result for you all right so let's see what else ellie wants to teach us in scratch so let's try something else let's say i have a variable named h so i'm gonna make a variable i name it age and then i ask a question which is let's say how old are you and then i want the answer to be displayed here so again i go back to variables and then i'm gonna set the whatever the answer was i want to assign it to h so i go to sensing again and i'm dragging this here

then here i can simply either say you know h or let's make it a little bit more interesting u r um and then we will say well and then the age and then years old so if i now go live again and then enter 10 here you can look at here here it says you are 10 years old all right now of course you can get creative with this you know like if i say h times um let me let me close it live if i say h times 365 then we can change this one to days and then this is going to tell you how many days old you are so if you're 10 right now you are uh 3 650 days old all right and you can just kind of play around with this variable as you would inside of scratch as well so you can see that there are a lot of similarities between scratch and other programming languages more specifically javascript and it is really worth it to learn all of these similarities before you actually kind of dive deeper into what the language is and and you know how you can how you can use it so the similarities are very interesting to learn so make sure you do that um so yeah this is it for for today's tutorial this was a great uh collaboration that i had with ellie channel she does uh tutorials from time to time specifically for younger learners so if you have any younger siblings make sure you recommend the channel yeah as you saw and as chris said most programming languages have a lot of commonalities when you learn one language it's going to be very easy to switch a different language so if you're a kid and are not comfortable with typing or you're just intimidated with textbased languages or you would
