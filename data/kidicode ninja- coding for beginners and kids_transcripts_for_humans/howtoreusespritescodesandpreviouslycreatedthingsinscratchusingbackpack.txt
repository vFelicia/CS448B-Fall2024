01:10 - all right you can look at your backpack
01:12 - as something like a
01:14 - backpack that you carry around with you
01:16 - when you go
01:17 - shopping so now i'm in the scratch
01:20 - website so i'm gonna shop around
01:22 - for things that i need and drop them in
01:25 - my backpack
01:26 - if you look at here when you're logged
01:28 - in into your profile
01:30 - there is a folder right beside your name
01:33 - which yours which my stuff or your stuff
01:37 - are in there so
01:38 - if i click here
01:42 - i will see all of my my
01:46 - projects here so
01:49 - let's say i want to take something
01:53 - from my fishbowl project
01:56 - and then i also
02:00 - wanna take something from my
02:04 - flying santa project so i open both of
02:07 - them
02:09 - i'm also gonna take a couple of things
02:12 - from
02:14 - someone else's project within the
02:16 - scratch community
02:19 - so let's say
02:22 - i'm going to
02:27 - explore
02:31 - and then
02:35 - i just click on one random
02:38 - project maybe
02:42 - this one
02:48 - and then some items are there as well
02:51 - i've also created a new project by
02:54 - clicking on the create button
02:56 - now if you look at this
03:00 - part here the backpack is right here so
03:04 - right here currently the backpack is
03:07 - empty
03:08 - i'm gonna shop around and fill it with
03:10 - all the things that i'm interested to
03:13 - keep
03:16 - so
03:19 - let's
03:22 - go here say inside
03:28 - let's say from this one i
03:32 - want to take the um
03:36 - maybe this piece of code so all i need
03:39 - to do
03:40 - like is i click on the backpack and i
03:43 - drag
03:44 - this and put it into my backpack
03:50 - so you see that the code is showed
03:53 - up here in the form of
03:56 - script now if i go back to here
04:00 - and i refresh
04:04 - this one should be added to my backpack
04:07 - so that i can reuse it in my new
04:12 - projects
04:16 - so as you can see when i went back to
04:20 - this new project that i just created
04:22 - i'm just going to give it a name
04:26 - backpack
04:31 - tutorial
04:34 - so this piece of code has appeared
04:38 - into this script if i want to use it
04:43 - all i need to do
04:47 - is i can go to the code tab and i can
04:51 - drag it right to my sprite so i had a
04:54 - code
04:54 - for a jumping peppa pig
04:58 - now i've i've dragged it on top of my
05:00 - cat surprise so if i click here
05:04 - i should see
05:05 - [Music]
05:08 - by pressing space i can make this cat
05:10 - jump so without the need to rewriting it
05:13 - i could reuse it simply by taking it
05:16 - from my other
05:17 - projects and also let's go and see
05:21 - what this person named tn
05:24 - tent has in their project so i go see
05:27 - inside
05:34 - let's take a sprite from here
05:38 - so i go to my backpack i just drag it
05:41 - here
05:45 - and then when i refresh this one
05:49 - it should show up here and i should make
05:52 - sure that i
05:53 - save first
06:01 - one thing that is very important is when
06:04 - you take
06:05 - a piece of code or anything
06:08 - any item from someone else's project you
06:11 - need to make sure that
06:13 - you're acknowledging that this thing is
06:15 - copied from somewhere else and
06:17 - preferably you need to modify it a bit
06:19 - to make it
06:21 - your own version
06:25 - so what i can do
06:28 - is
06:32 - i go back
06:35 - and then i copy this link
06:39 - and this name
06:42 - so first thing
06:46 - you see that the sprite came here
06:49 - and when i'm gonna
06:53 - share it
06:57 - there is a part which is notes and
07:00 - credits
07:00 - so i should say thanks to
07:04 - the name of the person was
07:08 - t intent the id
07:15 - and taken from
07:19 - or like a
07:23 - project link
07:26 - and then i paste it here so that i've
07:28 - acknowledged that
07:29 - it's taken from somewhere else
07:33 - so i go back to
07:36 - inside my project again
07:40 - so now that i've taken this
07:43 - sprite from the other project
07:46 - this is available to me i can drag it
07:49 - here
07:56 - and then when i go to the code
08:02 - this sprite with the whole code that it
08:04 - has
08:06 - is now accessible from my project so
08:09 - if i click on the flag
08:13 - you see this sprite and all the code
08:16 - associated with it
08:17 - is here so we're not gonna
08:20 - go into the detail of that because the
08:23 - purpose was just to see how we can use
08:25 - it but you can go and check it out later
08:30 - we can also import sounds and even
08:33 - costumes so all you need to
08:36 - do is just go to the project of your
08:39 - choice
08:42 - maybe i go here
08:48 - and click on the part that you needed
08:50 - like sounds
08:51 - for instance here there is a sound
08:56 - if i want it i can just drag it to my
08:59 - into my back or like from here i can
09:01 - just drag it into my backpack
09:05 - the same for costumes let's say i have
09:08 - this santa
09:12 - this sunday is not a good example maybe
09:14 - this gift
09:16 - has two variations if i want to take
09:19 - only one costume
09:20 - it's still possible so i just drag it
09:22 - here
09:25 - and you see it appeared as the form of
09:28 - costume
09:29 - but not a sprite so
09:33 - i can have access to it from my backpack
09:37 - in any other
09:38 - project so you can look at it as a
09:40 - backpack
09:41 - you are taking with you to go to the
09:43 - shopping mall and shop around
09:45 - among the all the projects that are on
09:47 - the scratch community and using it for
09:49 - yourself
09:50 - this feature is very useful
09:54 - to create new projects much faster and
09:58 - without
09:59 - wasting time on things that are already
10:01 - built
10:02 - and is very useful when you want to
10:04 - continue on other
10:06 - projects that are already made and
10:08 - improve
10:09 - on the things within the scratch
10:12 - community

10:17 - like subscribe
10:18 - and hit the bell and share it with your
10:20 - friends
