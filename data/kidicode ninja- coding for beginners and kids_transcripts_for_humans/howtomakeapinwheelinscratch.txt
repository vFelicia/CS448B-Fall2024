00:00 - hello hello hello you lovely scratchers
00:02 - how are you doing i hope everything is
00:04 - going great with you
00:07 - in this tutorial we are going to learn
00:10 - how to develop a pinwheel
00:12 - so the pinwheel is going to look like
00:15 - this so it's our own version of pinwheel
00:19 - is not looking like the
00:21 - traditional one
00:23 - uh so when i click the green flag
00:26 - after i click
00:28 - on the pinwheel it's gonna rotate and
00:31 - change color
00:33 - let's dive right in
00:36 - [Music]
00:37 - this is ellie and this is your place to
00:40 - learn to code and have fun
00:43 - so today we're gonna start with
00:46 - the cat
00:48 - except i'm gonna delete it bye
00:52 - now
00:53 - let's get to the pinwheel so if you
00:56 - search for pinwheel image
01:01 - pinwheel is
01:06 - something like this
01:09 - so
01:11 - let's go to the
01:12 - sprites
01:14 - and see what is the closest to it
01:17 - so in the sprites we don't have a
01:20 - pinwheel so we have
01:22 - three options either search a pinwheel
01:26 - image so pinwheel png
01:31 - and then download and import it or
01:36 - you can go
01:38 - to the paint and draw your own pinwheel
01:41 - but i'm gonna do a different thing
01:44 - what i'm gonna do is
01:46 - i'm choosing this
01:50 - uh
01:52 - snowflake
01:56 - so
01:57 - that is a little bit more creative
01:59 - i want it to be a bit different and i
02:02 - want to focus on the code rather than
02:04 - the drawing
02:06 - now that i have this
02:09 - i'm gonna
02:10 - choose a different
02:11 - sprite also for the
02:14 - handle
02:16 - i can
02:18 - maybe take the line or magic wind maybe
02:22 - i'm gonna take the line
02:24 - for the line since it's horizontal i'm
02:27 - going to customs
02:30 - and just
02:31 - rotate
02:34 - rotate
02:39 - i'm going to hold the shift so that i'm
02:41 - assured that it's on the 90 degrees
02:46 - and then i'm gonna make it
02:48 - smaller it's a little
02:51 - too big it doesn't fit in
02:53 - so let's make it a smaller
02:56 - now we have this beautiful pinwheel here
03:01 - and i want to make sure that this is at
03:02 - the top
03:04 - okay
03:06 - now let's get to the code
03:10 - so for the line we don't need to write
03:12 - anything
03:14 - for now
03:15 - only the
03:16 - uh
03:17 - the pinwheel itself is our construct
03:21 - now let's get to the code
03:23 - in this session i'm gonna also show you
03:27 - something which is called iterative
03:29 - prototyping so
03:31 - instead of
03:33 - developing the final prototype at first
03:36 - i'm gonna start from simple and then we
03:38 - go from version to version to see
03:42 - the final
03:43 - products
03:46 - now
03:48 - initially
03:50 - i'm gonna write it as simple as possible
03:53 - so i write it as when
03:56 - green flight clicked
03:58 - i just want to spin it
04:01 - from the control forever
04:04 - [Music]
04:08 - and then i go to motion
04:11 - turn 15 degrees so simple so this is
04:16 - simply rotating
04:19 - interesting but it still is different
04:21 - from actual pinwheel in an actual
04:24 - pinwheel when you blow on it it starts
04:27 - rotating as as a certain speed and then
04:30 - slowly slowly the speed reduces and then
04:34 - it is stopped so we are gonna simulate
04:37 - such a thing in this pinwheel
04:41 - in order to do this
04:44 - since i'm saying the speed is gonna
04:47 - reduce
04:49 - so the speed shouldn't be
04:51 - the turn degree in degrees it shouldn't
04:54 - be always 15. i need a variable it
04:57 - should be maybe initially
05:01 - 15 and then slowly slowly
05:04 - reduce and reduce until it becomes zero
05:07 - or like don't turn at all
05:10 - so from variables i'm gonna make a
05:12 - variable and i'm gonna name it
05:15 - spin
05:16 - speed
05:19 - okay
05:23 - when we have a variable we always need
05:25 - to initialize it so we need to give it
05:27 - an initial value
05:30 - i'm gonna
05:32 - set my initial value
05:34 - of the variable spin speed to zero for
05:37 - now
05:39 - and then
05:41 - i'm gonna turn
05:47 - spin speed degrees
05:50 - i'm gonna reduce this speed as we go
05:54 - so
05:56 - let's go
05:58 - to the set let's drag the set
06:03 - spin speed 2
06:06 - i want to make it less so
06:09 - one way to make a value
06:12 - so one way to make that number less is
06:16 - to multiply it by
06:19 - something less than one
06:22 - so i would say
06:25 - set spin speed the new spin speed is
06:28 - gonna be
06:31 - spin
06:32 - speed multiplied
06:36 - something less than
06:38 - 1
06:39 - like 0.97
06:43 - and then
06:47 - at some point i need to stop
06:50 - so
06:51 - i need a condition
06:53 - the condition is checking for the value
06:56 - of the variable and then if it's too
06:59 - low
07:01 - so i'm gonna say
07:03 - how do i say too low i need a comparison
07:07 - if
07:08 - the spin speed
07:11 - is less than
07:14 - let's say
07:16 - 0.5
07:19 - now i would say i want it to stop
07:23 - almost
07:24 - zero right
07:26 - so i'm gonna set
07:29 - the spin speed to
07:32 - zero
07:37 - so
07:41 - now the spin speed
07:43 - started from zero but it's never
07:46 - increased how do i want it to increase
07:49 - i want it to increase i want this the
07:52 - initial speed to have a positive value
07:56 - only when i click
07:58 - on the
08:00 - pinwheel
08:01 - so let's write a second piece of code
08:04 - for when we click on the pinwheel
08:08 - oh my god i deleted my code
08:10 - okay i did control that so that i get it
08:13 - back
08:15 - now i'm gonna make it a bit smaller so
08:18 - that i can fit the second part
08:22 - okay so far here we never
08:27 - gave a positive value to spin speed
08:32 - we want to provide value to the speed
08:35 - after we clicked on this
08:39 - spin wheel so i'm gonna write a
08:41 - different block of code which is saying
08:45 - when this sprite is clicked
08:49 - now go and check the speed
08:53 - so i put it if can condition
08:58 - if
09:01 - spin speed
09:06 - is less than
09:08 - something
09:09 - we're gonna decide later
09:13 - so
09:14 - spin speed less than
09:17 - something
09:19 - let's say
09:20 - maybe 10
09:22 - we can later play but by the number and
09:24 - see what we like
09:29 - set it to
09:30 - 10
09:31 - so i'm gonna set
09:34 - to 10. so what i'm trying to do is
09:37 - whenever i clicked on this
09:40 - if the spin speed
09:42 - is anything small
09:44 - i wanted to change it to i want to
09:47 - change it to 10 so i start from 10 so
09:50 - like when i blow at my spin wheel
09:53 - is rotating at the speed of 10.
09:58 - so i'm gonna test it
10:02 - nothing happened because i forgot to
10:04 - change this to spin
10:07 - spit
10:08 - so let's test one more time
10:11 - let me save
10:12 - and test
10:15 - so now it's rotating
10:19 - starting from the speed of 10
10:22 - and then slowly slowly
10:24 - reduced because i'm multiplying it by a
10:28 - small number
10:30 - so this was iteration
10:33 - two
10:34 - now let's go to iteration
10:38 - three
10:41 - let's go
10:43 - uh let's play it with the colors so
10:47 - i'm going to the costumes
10:50 - and let's color the inside of the parts
10:53 - first
10:54 - so i'm just
10:57 - taking my bucket
10:59 - and then fill this
11:00 - change the color
11:04 - and then fill
11:07 - and again
11:09 - and one more time
11:12 - blue so all the colors anything you like
11:16 - just fill it
11:18 - i'm gonna take yellow here
11:20 - [Music]
11:32 - so
11:49 - [Music]
11:52 - all right
11:55 - now that is colored one more thing that
11:58 - we can do is
12:00 - i can change the color as it rotates so
12:07 - now it rotates
12:09 - and the colors are
12:11 - fixed without any change
12:15 - now let's go to the
12:17 - looks
12:19 - and take this
12:22 - change color effect
12:26 - by
12:28 - maybe not 25 but maybe
12:33 - three
12:37 - uh this is a little
12:39 - annoying on the eyes so let's also
12:44 - set this number in relation to the speed
12:47 - like the
12:48 - like
12:49 - the spin speed multiply but by something
12:53 - so change the color effect by
12:57 - again
13:04 - spin speed
13:08 - oops
13:21 - multiply 0.97
13:25 - let's see how it looks
13:28 - so i click and it changes the color
13:32 - it is in a starts it starts with some
13:36 - specific speed and then it slowly slowly
13:39 - stops
13:40 - let's make it bigger number
13:46 - so just like this
13:59 - um
14:05 - let's change this one also to 40 so that
14:08 - it spins longer
14:13 - that's much better
14:17 - so this was
14:19 - iteration three
14:23 - what else we can do
14:25 - now let's see for the next
14:27 - iterations
14:29 - what else can we do to improve this how
14:32 - can we make it much better
14:35 - i have a suggestion i'm
14:38 - i'm proposing
14:40 - the idea but i'm not gonna make it in
14:43 - this session but if you know how to do
14:47 - it go ahead and do it and send the link
14:50 - to your project
14:52 - on the comment and you may win a prize
14:56 - if yours is a really good idea
15:00 - so what i want to say is
15:05 - for the next iteration
15:09 - instead of clicking
15:11 - on this
15:13 - make it move
15:15 - by your voice so
15:17 - so you blow
15:19 - like this onto your microphone and then
15:23 - the louder you blow it rotates faster so
15:27 - if i blow like this
15:29 - it's supposed to rotate really fast but
15:32 - if i blow slowly
15:34 - it's it rotates very slow so if you know
15:38 - how to write the code for it
15:41 - write it in the scratch and put a link
15:44 - to your project in the comment and you
15:47 - may win a prize
15:49 - so i hope you liked this video if you
15:51 - did don't forget to like it subscribe
15:54 - and share it with your friends so that
15:56 - my channel can be seen on youtube see
15:59 - you next time bye

hello hello hello you lovely scratchers how are you doing i hope everything is going great with you in this tutorial we are going to learn how to develop a pinwheel so the pinwheel is going to look like this so it's our own version of pinwheel is not looking like the traditional one uh so when i click the green flag after i click on the pinwheel it's gonna rotate and change color let's dive right in this is ellie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun so today we're gonna start with the cat except i'm gonna delete it bye now let's get to the pinwheel so if you search for pinwheel image pinwheel is something like this so let's go to the sprites and see what is the closest to it so in the sprites we don't have a pinwheel so we have three options either search a pinwheel image so pinwheel png and then download and import it or you can go to the paint and draw your own pinwheel but i'm gonna do a different thing what i'm gonna do is i'm choosing this uh snowflake so that is a little bit more creative i want it to be a bit different and i want to focus on the code rather than the drawing now that i have this i'm gonna choose a different sprite also for the handle i can maybe take the line or magic wind maybe i'm gonna take the line for the line since it's horizontal i'm going to customs and just rotate rotate i'm going to hold the shift so that i'm assured that it's on the 90 degrees and then i'm gonna make it smaller it's a little too big it doesn't fit in so let's make it a smaller now we have this beautiful pinwheel here and i want to make sure that this is at the top okay now let's get to the code so for the line we don't need to write anything for now only the uh the pinwheel itself is our construct now let's get to the code in this session i'm gonna also show you something which is called iterative prototyping so instead of developing the final prototype at first i'm gonna start from simple and then we go from version to version to see the final products now initially i'm gonna write it as simple as possible so i write it as when green flight clicked i just want to spin it from the control forever and then i go to motion turn 15 degrees so simple so this is simply rotating interesting but it still is different from actual pinwheel in an actual pinwheel when you blow on it it starts rotating as as a certain speed and then slowly slowly the speed reduces and then it is stopped so we are gonna simulate such a thing in this pinwheel in order to do this since i'm saying the speed is gonna reduce so the speed shouldn't be the turn degree in degrees it shouldn't be always 15. i need a variable it should be maybe initially 15 and then slowly slowly reduce and reduce until it becomes zero or like don't turn at all so from variables i'm gonna make a variable and i'm gonna name it spin speed okay when we have a variable we always need to initialize it so we need to give it an initial value i'm gonna set my initial value of the variable spin speed to zero for now and then i'm gonna turn spin speed degrees i'm gonna reduce this speed as we go so let's go to the set let's drag the set spin speed 2 i want to make it less so one way to make a value so one way to make that number less is to multiply it by something less than one so i would say set spin speed the new spin speed is gonna be spin speed multiplied something less than 1 like 0.97 and then at some point i need to stop so i need a condition the condition is checking for the value of the variable and then if it's too low so i'm gonna say how do i say too low i need a comparison if the spin speed is less than let's say 0.5 now i would say i want it to stop almost zero right so i'm gonna set the spin speed to zero so now the spin speed started from zero but it's never increased how do i want it to increase i want it to increase i want this the initial speed to have a positive value only when i click on the pinwheel so let's write a second piece of code for when we click on the pinwheel oh my god i deleted my code okay i did control that so that i get it back now i'm gonna make it a bit smaller so that i can fit the second part okay so far here we never gave a positive value to spin speed we want to provide value to the speed after we clicked on this spin wheel so i'm gonna write a different block of code which is saying when this sprite is clicked now go and check the speed so i put it if can condition if spin speed is less than something we're gonna decide later so spin speed less than something let's say maybe 10 we can later play but by the number and see what we like set it to 10 so i'm gonna set to 10. so what i'm trying to do is whenever i clicked on this if the spin speed is anything small i wanted to change it to i want to change it to 10 so i start from 10 so like when i blow at my spin wheel is rotating at the speed of 10. so i'm gonna test it nothing happened because i forgot to change this to spin spit so let's test one more time let me save and test so now it's rotating starting from the speed of 10 and then slowly slowly reduced because i'm multiplying it by a small number so this was iteration two now let's go to iteration three let's go uh let's play it with the colors so i'm going to the costumes and let's color the inside of the parts first so i'm just taking my bucket and then fill this change the color and then fill and again and one more time blue so all the colors anything you like just fill it i'm gonna take yellow here so all right now that is colored one more thing that we can do is i can change the color as it rotates so now it rotates and the colors are fixed without any change now let's go to the looks and take this change color effect by maybe not 25 but maybe three uh this is a little annoying on the eyes so let's also set this number in relation to the speed like the like the spin speed multiply but by something so change the color effect by again spin speed oops multiply 0.97 let's see how it looks so i click and it changes the color it is in a starts it starts with some specific speed and then it slowly slowly stops let's make it bigger number so just like this um let's change this one also to 40 so that it spins longer that's much better so this was iteration three what else we can do now let's see for the next iterations what else can we do to improve this how can we make it much better i have a suggestion i'm i'm proposing the idea but i'm not gonna make it in this session but if you know how to do it go ahead and do it and send the link to your
