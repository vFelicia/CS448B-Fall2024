00:00 - hello how are you doing i hope you are
00:03 - all feeling
00:04 - wonderful let's
00:08 - create a new game which is
00:11 - snake game in this game we have a
00:14 - snake trying to chase a mouse
00:18 - by pressing up down left right arrow
00:22 - and the mouse is running away
00:26 - and whenever
00:29 - i hit the edges i'm game
00:33 - over like this
00:37 - stick around in a minute we are going to
00:39 - see how we can create
00:40 - this fun fun game welcome to kirikou
00:45 - ninja tutorial
00:46 - this is eddie and this is your place to
00:49 - learn to code and have fun
00:52 - we're gonna start with the cat except
00:55 - we're gonna delete it
00:56 - bye and then giving your project a good
01:00 - name
01:01 - snake
01:05 - game let's create the surprise we need
01:08 - i'm i'm gonna need a
01:13 - mouse
01:17 - so from animals you can easily
01:21 - [Music]
01:22 - pick the mouse or whatever else you
01:25 - would
01:26 - like to let's make it a bit lit
01:29 - smaller like a little mouse
01:33 - and then
01:36 - let's go to the paint
01:40 - and draw the second one i'm gonna zoom
01:43 - in
01:43 - in and
01:47 - choose the color blue
01:51 - or purple blue or whatever you like
01:56 - it's gonna be the snake here
02:00 - and then the outline zero
02:03 - i don't want outline
02:07 - hold shift to draw a square
02:12 - and then one square
02:15 - knot two and then make sure to put it on
02:19 - the
02:20 - center that's it
02:24 - and name it snake
02:27 - this is our snake and this is our mouse
02:33 - now let's also go to backdrop
02:37 - and also choose paint again not this
02:42 - so backdrop and choose paint
02:46 - choose the color i choose the color
02:49 - green and then i choose
02:53 - pattern colored
02:56 - maybe green together with
03:00 - [Music]
03:03 - blue yeah
03:06 - and just feel it
03:11 - just draw it square and fill it
03:15 - like this okay
03:18 - this is the background of our game
03:22 - i'm gonna also name this
03:26 - start backdrop
03:33 - and then i will duplicate it and create
03:36 - another one which i'm calling it
03:39 - game over
03:42 - and writing using the text
03:47 - game over
03:51 - i'm writing with green so you won't see
03:54 - it
03:54 - so i should change the color
03:59 - here we go
04:02 - and again
04:06 - when you don't change the color you make
04:07 - a typo so game over
04:10 - okay so we're all set and ready
04:14 - to go to the coding
04:17 - let's start by programming our snake
04:22 - that's also let's go back
04:26 - to empty backdrop so we're not
04:30 - distracted
04:31 - all right going back to the code and we
04:34 - are on the
04:35 - snake sprite first thing when
04:38 - fly clicked going to write the code for
04:42 - movement of the snake
04:47 - i would say forever
04:51 - and then i want to write the code for
04:53 - four directions of movement
04:56 - so that i want the movements to be
05:00 - written for whenever i click
05:04 - right left up and down arrow so
05:08 - i say if
05:12 - and then from the sensing
05:17 - key up arrow pressed
05:22 - then from the motion
05:27 - point
05:28 - [Music]
05:31 - towards point in direction
05:36 - and then i'm gonna change it so i'm
05:39 - gonna copy
05:40 - this duplicate
05:46 - three times so that i have four
05:50 - of this if conditions
05:54 - so i say if key is up do this
05:58 - if k is down do this if
06:02 - right do this
06:05 - and if left do something else
06:09 - so if the key up arrow is
06:13 - pressed i want to look up
06:17 - so point to direction zero
06:20 - if key arrow down press
06:24 - look down point direction 180
06:28 - if key right arrow pressed
06:32 - just 90 like as it is and
06:35 - if left arrow clicked i want to look
06:39 - left so 0.2 direction in direction
06:42 - minus 90.
06:46 - [Music]
06:47 - and in all the condition i want to move
06:51 - a few steps like let's say
06:55 - 10 steps
06:59 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to
07:01 - create a variable
07:03 - and name it speed
07:10 - and then i'm going to set
07:14 - speed to 10
07:19 - so here instead of explicitly
07:22 - saying move 10 step
07:25 - since i've already assigned variable
07:28 - defined variable speed and assign 10 to
07:32 - it
07:33 - i'm gonna say move speed
07:36 - step in this way
07:39 - i can easily play with this number
07:44 - and then this one will be changed
07:48 - one more thing from the motions i would
07:51 - say
07:51 - go to
07:55 - zero zero 0
07:58 - 0 okay
08:02 - so if i press flag
08:05 - i press right left and it's super fast
08:09 - and i can move this
08:12 - okay let's make it a little bit slower
08:16 - so that it's easier to play so the
08:19 - harder the speed
08:21 - the the faster the speed the harder to
08:24 - play you will see why in a minute
08:29 - it doesn't really look like the snake
08:32 - right now
08:33 - but let's see what i'm gonna do to make
08:37 - it look like
08:38 - snake
08:41 - we're gonna use clone for this
08:44 - so to make it look like is a snake
08:48 - not a square i would say when a star
08:52 - clicked go to control and
08:55 - create a clone of my
08:58 - self
09:04 - also do it forever
09:07 - create a clone of
09:10 - my self
09:14 - at this point i'm gonna get something
09:18 - like this still not looking like a snake
09:22 - but what i can do is
09:26 - i define a lifetime
09:30 - for my clone so i define a variable
09:34 - stop it i name it
09:39 - clone lifetime
09:48 - okay and then
09:54 - also i don't want to show any of this
09:57 - variable so i just uncheck
10:03 - and then here i would say going back to
10:06 - control
10:08 - when i start as a clone
10:14 - wait for
10:20 - for as long as the variable
10:24 - clone lifetime
10:27 - and then delete the clone
10:31 - so control and then delete
10:34 - this clone
10:38 - also let's set the clone lifetime
10:43 - to let's say half a second so after half
10:48 - a second
10:49 - the previous clones are deleted so
10:52 - now now it really looks like
10:56 - snake so what else is the mouse should
11:00 - run away
11:01 - otherwise it's boring
11:05 - okay let's see how so we click on the
11:09 - mouse
11:09 - and let's write the code for this one
11:14 - when start clicked
11:17 - i wanted to
11:20 - first go to a random position
11:26 - initially just go somewhere and then
11:29 - forever
11:33 - if
11:37 - um control if touching
11:43 - the snake so
11:46 - in case the snake catches
11:50 - the mouse the mouse should go
11:53 - somewhere else so i want it to
11:56 - glide in one second
12:00 - to a random position let's test it and
12:04 - see
12:04 - what we did so if i'm
12:08 - touching the mouth should
12:11 - move to a random position
12:16 - yeah it's running away and it's gliding
12:23 - to a random position so i try to follow
12:26 - it again
12:26 - and catch it it went really far away
12:30 - okay but then how would the game stop
12:34 - there should be some condition for a
12:36 - game over as well right so
12:38 - let's write that i want to say if my
12:41 - snake
12:42 - touched the edges then i'm gonna
12:45 - finish the game and i'm game over
12:49 - let's write this one
12:52 - so let's stop the game whenever the
12:55 - snake is
12:56 - touching the edges so i would say
13:00 - again when start clicked
13:04 - let's take the if condition if
13:08 - touching the
13:11 - edge touching edge
13:17 - what i want to do is remember we already
13:20 - created a backdrop for a game over
13:23 - so let's go to the looks so i'm
13:26 - switching
13:29 - backdrop to game over
13:32 - and then i'm gonna set the speed
13:36 - to zero so i don't want the snake to
13:39 - move anymore let's go here
13:43 - set speed to zero
13:49 - or maybe let's not do this let's instead
13:54 - stop all stop everything
13:58 - here before stop all
14:02 - let's go to a sound here
14:07 - and then let's choose a sound
14:12 - let's say lose
14:14 - [Music]
14:15 - okay let's add this one
14:19 - and then go back to the code so we were
14:21 - here
14:23 - play sound lose until
14:26 - done and then stop all so
14:31 - anything left i don't think so let's try
14:34 - it
14:36 - so i'm going here
14:39 - and then i try to catch the mouse
14:43 - and then let's say i lost uh
14:47 - nothing happened switch back drop to
14:51 - game over
14:54 - oh so we are missing forever
14:58 - so it needs to constantly check this
15:01 - condition
15:02 - so let's try again i'm gonna catch the
15:11 - and mouse game is stopped
15:14 - i hope you liked this video if you did
15:17 - don't forget to press
15:18 - like subscribe and hit the bell so that
15:21 - you get notification when i upload a new
15:24 - video
15:24 - and see you next time soon bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello how are you doing i hope you are all feeling wonderful let's create a new game which is snake game in this game we have a snake trying to chase a mouse by pressing up down left right arrow and the mouse is running away and whenever i hit the edges i'm game over like this stick around in a minute we are going to see how we can create this fun fun game welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun we're gonna start with the cat except we're gonna delete it bye and then giving your project a good name snake game let's create the surprise we need i'm i'm gonna need a mouse so from animals you can easily pick the mouse or whatever else you would like to let's make it a bit lit smaller like a little mouse and then let's go to the paint and draw the second one i'm gonna zoom in in and choose the color blue or purple blue or whatever you like it's gonna be the snake here and then the outline zero i don't want outline hold shift to draw a square and then one square knot two and then make sure to put it on the center that's it and name it snake this is our snake and this is our mouse now let's also go to backdrop and also choose paint again not this so backdrop and choose paint choose the color i choose the color green and then i choose pattern colored maybe green together with blue yeah and just feel it just draw it square and fill it like this okay this is the background of our game i'm gonna also name this start backdrop and then i will duplicate it and create another one which i'm calling it game over and writing using the text game over i'm writing with green so you won't see it so i should change the color here we go and again when you don't change the color you make a typo so game over okay so we're all set and ready to go to the coding let's start by programming our snake that's also let's go back to empty backdrop so we're not distracted all right going back to the code and we are on the snake sprite first thing when fly clicked going to write the code for movement of the snake i would say forever and then i want to write the code for four directions of movement so that i want the movements to be written for whenever i click right left up and down arrow so i say if and then from the sensing key up arrow pressed then from the motion point towards point in direction and then i'm gonna change it so i'm gonna copy this duplicate three times so that i have four of this if conditions so i say if key is up do this if k is down do this if right do this and if left do something else so if the key up arrow is pressed i want to look up so point to direction zero if key arrow down press look down point direction 180 if key right arrow pressed just 90 like as it is and if left arrow clicked i want to look left so 0.2 direction in direction minus 90. and in all the condition i want to move a few steps like let's say 10 steps what i'm going to do is i'm going to create a variable and name it speed and then i'm going to set speed to 10 so here instead of explicitly saying move 10 step since i've already assigned variable defined variable speed and assign 10 to it i'm gonna say move speed step in this way i can easily play with this number and then this one will be changed one more thing from the motions i would say go to zero zero 0 0 okay so if i press flag i press right left and it's super fast and i can move this okay let's make it a little bit slower so that it's easier to play so the harder the speed the the faster the speed the harder to play you will see why in a minute it doesn't really look like the snake right now but let's see what i'm gonna do to make it look like snake we're gonna use clone for this so to make it look like is a snake not a square i would say when a star clicked go to control and create a clone of my self also do it forever create a clone of my self at this point i'm gonna get something like this still not looking like a snake but what i can do is i define a lifetime for my clone so i define a variable stop it i name it clone lifetime okay and then also i don't want to show any of this variable so i just uncheck and then here i would say going back to control when i start as a clone wait for for as long as the variable clone lifetime and then delete the clone so control and then delete this clone also let's set the clone lifetime to let's say half a second so after half a second the previous clones are deleted so now now it really looks like snake so what else is the mouse should run away otherwise it's boring okay let's see how so we click on the mouse and let's write the code for this one when start clicked i wanted to first go to a random position initially just go somewhere and then forever if um control if touching the snake so in case the snake catches the mouse the mouse should go somewhere else so i want it to glide in one second to a random position let's test it and see what we did so if i'm touching the mouth should move to a random position yeah it's running away and it's gliding to a random position so i try to follow it again and catch it it went really far away okay but then how would the game stop there should be some condition for a game over as well right so let's write that i want to say if my snake touched the edges then i'm gonna finish the game and i'm game over let's write this one so let's stop the game whenever the snake is touching the edges so i would say again when start clicked let's take the if condition if touching the edge touching edge what i want to do is remember we already created a backdrop for a game over so let's go to the looks so i'm switching backdrop to game over and then i'm gonna set the speed to zero so i don't want the snake to move anymore let's go here set speed to zero or maybe let's not do this let's instead stop all stop everything here before stop all let's go to a sound here and then let's choose a sound let's say lose okay let's add this one and then go back to the code so we were here play sound lose until done and then stop all so anything left i don't think so let's try it so i'm going here and then i try to catch the mouse and then let's say i lost uh nothing happened switch back drop to game over oh so we are missing forever so it needs to constantly check this condition so let's try again i'm gonna catch the and mouse game is stopped i hope you liked this video if you did don't forget to press like subscribe and hit the bell so that you get notification when i upload a new video and see you next time soon bye
