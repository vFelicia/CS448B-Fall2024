00:06 - stay frozen
00:10 - let's freeze
00:14 - stay frozen
00:17 - hello and welcome to kitty code ninja
00:20 - tutorials
00:21 - this is ellie and this is your place to
00:24 - learn to code and have fun
00:26 - are you ready open
00:34 - guess what you can create your own dance
00:37 - party
00:37 - with scratch do you like to join
00:47 - in this tutorial i'm going to show you
00:50 - how to create
00:50 - a dance freeze game and from the photos
00:53 - of yourself
00:54 - while dancing i'm gonna tell you
00:57 - everything step by step
00:59 - step one find your favorite music
01:02 - and play step two
01:06 - find a plain wall or
01:10 - install a green background and start
01:13 - dancing in front of it
01:15 - step three ask somebody to capture a few
01:19 - shots of you
01:19 - while you are dancing step four
01:24 - remove the background from the images
01:27 - that you have
01:28 - using photoshop or any photo editing
01:31 - tool
01:33 - step 5. now it's time to write the code
01:37 - let's see how we're going to delete the
01:39 - background from image
01:41 - in order to do that you have various
01:43 - solutions
01:46 - if you have photoshop you can use that
01:48 - of course
01:49 - but if you don't have it it's not a
01:51 - problem just go to the google
01:53 - and search for free
01:57 - image background
02:06 - remover
02:08 - this one www.remove.pg
02:12 - works at the time that i'm recording the
02:14 - video but generally that's the process
02:17 - when you want to solve an issue you just
02:20 - google
02:20 - and then find a link and try and see
02:24 - which one works
02:25 - it's just all about experimenting so
02:29 - i click here
02:32 - and then here i see it says
02:36 - upload image
02:39 - i'm gonna upload an image of
02:43 - myself like
02:48 - this one
02:54 - and then i click
02:57 - remove background even without me
02:59 - clicking it it did remove it but if it
03:01 - didn't happen for you
03:03 - just click remove background and then
03:05 - you can download
03:07 - your photo
03:10 - so you just choose a good name for it
03:15 - whatever you like you see this png
03:20 - png images are the type of images that
03:24 - the
03:24 - image and the background are separated
03:27 - so like you have
03:28 - an empty background so it's easier for
03:30 - using it at
03:32 - sprites so i save it here
03:42 - cool
03:45 - here we go i have an image
03:48 - sprite of myself with the background
03:51 - removed from it
03:52 - i can use it in my scratch
03:57 - as an sprite
04:01 - now we are in the scratch environment
04:05 - uh we're gonna delete this cat because
04:07 - we you're not going to use it
04:09 - instead we're going to use our own
04:11 - sprite
04:12 - i delete this by clicking on this
04:15 - recycle bin
04:16 - icon and then i click here
04:21 - then i say upload this right because i
04:23 - want to upload something from my own
04:25 - computer
04:25 - so i say upload
04:29 - then i pick one of those
04:33 - images one of the surprise
04:39 - and here we go is here
04:43 - i can give it a reasonable name
04:47 - like dancer
04:55 - so this is my spread
04:59 - in order to make it dance i need to
05:02 - have several costumes in which each
05:05 - costume
05:07 - is going to be one of the dance poses
05:10 - that i
05:10 - captured while i was dancing
05:13 - so i click here to choose a costume
05:18 - then i try to upload multiple costumes
05:21 - here
05:23 - this one this one this one the more
05:25 - dance
05:26 - means more dance poses
05:35 - okay now i i have this
05:38 - sprite with all the costumes in it
05:41 - oops what did i do okay
05:46 - in case you didn't want to remove the
05:49 - background
05:50 - using any software you can upload your
05:53 - sprite here and then using this eraser
05:56 - deletes the area around your image but
05:59 - it's a little
06:01 - inconvenient so
06:04 - let's go to writing the code now
06:10 - all right now we're getting to the fun
06:12 - part we are going to actually write the
06:14 - code
06:15 - a code that makes this character which
06:18 - is
06:19 - one of ourselves dance
06:26 - simulating the dance is actually super
06:28 - easy
06:29 - all it needs is switching from one
06:32 - costume to another in a
06:34 - forever loop so
06:37 - let's go to the code
06:40 - which i'm here and then
06:43 - from the control i want to do something
06:46 - forever
06:47 - which is switching from one costume to
06:49 - another costume
06:50 - and then i go to the looks
06:55 - and i say next
07:00 - costume so forever next
07:03 - to forever go to the next costume
07:06 - and then i need some condition to
07:08 - trigger it so i want to say
07:10 - when start plate did this so
07:14 - again from the event
07:17 - when flag clicks
07:22 - forever go to the next costume let's see
07:24 - how it looks
07:26 - uh it's a super fast dance but it's
07:29 - dancing
07:30 - so it's a good start
07:33 - in order to make the dance smoother
07:36 - uh we can put a weight here so that it's
07:40 - not dancing super fast
07:41 - we don't want to become dizzy
07:45 - let's find the weight it should be in
07:48 - the control
07:51 - wait one second might be really
07:55 - long wait between dance poses
07:58 - i put like 0.3
08:01 - let's see how it looks now
08:04 - it's nice i like it all right
08:08 - now stopped
08:14 - all right now let's add a music
08:17 - for our on our dance stage let's go to
08:19 - the sounds
08:22 - and then from here you can
08:25 - either upload something from your own
08:27 - computer or
08:29 - you can just search something from
08:31 - whatever is already
08:32 - in the scratch library i choose this
08:35 - option
08:38 - i search for dance to narrow down to
08:41 - some options which are more
08:44 - dance related i play and just test
08:48 - and see which one i like more which i
08:51 - like this one
08:53 - so i choose it i currently have
08:56 - something here
08:57 - um i can add as many sounds as i want
09:01 - here
09:02 - but then in the code which is which one
09:04 - we want it to be played
09:06 - all right let's go to the code if i
09:09 - play start here i don't hear the music
09:12 - yet
09:14 - what i need to do is from the code
09:18 - tell the computer to play the sound
09:21 - so it should be probably under the
09:24 - sun category i go to the sound and then
09:28 - here
09:29 - we have start sound
09:32 - play sound star sound might work
09:37 - so let's drag it here
09:43 - uh i can put it on the top
09:46 - i can also put it inside if i put it on
09:48 - the top
09:50 - it won't sink forever it would go on
09:53 - until
09:53 - it's finished for a reason that i will
09:57 - tell you later
09:58 - i put it on the top so let's see how it
10:02 - looks
10:05 - okay looks fun i like it cool cool
10:11 - okay now we need to freeze the character
10:14 - but how let's do it this way
10:18 - uh we want to say we want to trigger
10:21 - freezing by pressing the
10:24 - spacebar so whenever i press the
10:26 - spacebar i want the action of freezing
10:29 - happen
10:30 - i also want all the music to be stopped
10:33 - and then instead i want someone
10:35 - or a music or something announces
10:39 - freeze and i want the sprite to stop
10:43 - moving or changing custom
10:46 - so let's see so i said i want an if
10:50 - condition i want to say
10:51 - if spacebar press so i drag the if
10:55 - condition
10:59 - after all these things
11:03 - i go to the sensing to field this
11:06 - condition
11:08 - i see here i have the option of key
11:11 - space
11:12 - pressed so if q space pressed
11:15 - i want to stop all the sun all the
11:19 - sounds stop all sounds
11:26 - and at the same time
11:32 - i want the character not to move
11:35 - for let's say three seconds so i say
11:41 - wait three seconds
11:51 - so stop all sounds wait three seconds
11:56 - let's see how it looks like so far i
11:59 - press space
12:00 - so it's waiting all the signs are
12:03 - stopped and it's waiting for
12:04 - three seconds after three seconds is
12:07 - moving again
12:08 - but you see it's moving but the
12:12 - sound didn't go back again
12:15 - because i never
12:18 - said now you can stop you can start
12:21 - playing the sound again
12:23 - so i need to do that but also i don't
12:26 - want
12:27 - only the music to stop
12:31 - and the character to sub i also want to
12:33 - announce freeze
12:35 - i want to announce freeze in two ways
12:37 - one
12:39 - from the looks i wanna say
12:43 - freeze so i say
12:52 - freeze
13:05 - so this phrase shows up it would be
13:08 - really cool if we can record
13:10 - our voice and say freeze also
13:16 - so i go to the sounds library
13:22 - and then i press the microphone and
13:24 - record my
13:25 - own voice so i say press record
13:29 - now freeze
13:37 - [Music]
13:40 - when i was happy with my recording i can
13:43 - save it otherwise i can re-record until
13:45 - i get my desired
13:47 - recording so i save it
13:50 - and i give it a name i name it
14:00 - freeze
14:03 - and then from my code i go to the sounds
14:11 - and then start sound freeze
14:16 - so say freeze and start sound freeze and
14:19 - wait three seconds so that the character
14:21 - is not moving
14:23 - one more thing is you want the music to
14:25 - go back playing after this three
14:28 - seconds is over so again i say start
14:31 - sound
14:33 - this one dance around this time
14:37 - okay so let's see how it goes
14:40 - now i play stop space bar
14:49 - maybe three seconds is a little too low
14:53 - short i say six seconds again
14:57 - space bar now
15:10 - free
15:16 - one more thing we can do is let's add a
15:18 - backdrop
15:19 - to make it more fun so i go here
15:22 - to choose a backdrop
15:26 - something maybe a concert
15:30 - background now it's more fun
15:38 - cool
15:44 - all right now let's fix a little part
15:47 - that we have when i
15:48 - click spacebar this phrase
15:52 - does not go even after the time of the
15:56 - freeze is over so now the character is
15:58 - dancing but the freezes are still there
16:00 - in order to fix
16:01 - it what i can do is here
16:06 - instead of say freeze
16:09 - i go and say say freeze for two seconds
16:13 - so i'm gonna delete this
16:17 - and then i drag this one instead
16:20 - so that after two seconds
16:24 - that freeze is going
16:27 - and it's not showing up when the
16:29 - character the sprite is not
16:32 - frozen anymore so
16:37 - two seconds is gone and now
16:40 - when it's moving it's not here anymore
16:43 - so that's what we want
16:45 - yeah we're pretty much done with this
16:48 - dance freeze game
16:49 - we can do more things here we can add
16:52 - more characters more surprise so that it
16:54 - looks like a real party
16:57 - this is the final code so far
17:01 - i'm going to put the link on the on the
17:03 - description
17:05 - the link to the project on the sprite
17:07 - website so that you can go there and
17:09 - check it out
17:11 - well done everyone in this lesson you
17:13 - learn to create your very
17:15 - own dance freeze game do you like to
17:19 - create your own dance freeze party with
17:21 - all your friends in it
17:23 - ask them to create their sprite and send
17:26 - to you

Cleaned transcript:

let's freeze stay frozen let's freeze stay frozen hello and welcome to kitty code ninja tutorials this is ellie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun are you ready open guess what you can create your own dance party with scratch do you like to join in this tutorial i'm going to show you how to create a dance freeze game and from the photos of yourself while dancing i'm gonna tell you everything step by step step one find your favorite music and play step two find a plain wall or install a green background and start dancing in front of it step three ask somebody to capture a few shots of you while you are dancing step four remove the background from the images that you have using photoshop or any photo editing tool step 5. now it's time to write the code let's see how we're going to delete the background from image in order to do that you have various solutions if you have photoshop you can use that of course but if you don't have it it's not a problem just go to the google and search for free image background remover this one www.remove.pg works at the time that i'm recording the video but generally that's the process when you want to solve an issue you just google and then find a link and try and see which one works it's just all about experimenting so i click here and then here i see it says upload image i'm gonna upload an image of myself like this one and then i click remove background even without me clicking it it did remove it but if it didn't happen for you just click remove background and then you can download your photo so you just choose a good name for it whatever you like you see this png png images are the type of images that the image and the background are separated so like you have an empty background so it's easier for using it at sprites so i save it here cool here we go i have an image sprite of myself with the background removed from it i can use it in my scratch as an sprite now we are in the scratch environment uh we're gonna delete this cat because we you're not going to use it instead we're going to use our own sprite i delete this by clicking on this recycle bin icon and then i click here then i say upload this right because i want to upload something from my own computer so i say upload then i pick one of those images one of the surprise and here we go is here i can give it a reasonable name like dancer so this is my spread in order to make it dance i need to have several costumes in which each costume is going to be one of the dance poses that i captured while i was dancing so i click here to choose a costume then i try to upload multiple costumes here this one this one this one the more dance means more dance poses okay now i i have this sprite with all the costumes in it oops what did i do okay in case you didn't want to remove the background using any software you can upload your sprite here and then using this eraser deletes the area around your image but it's a little inconvenient so let's go to writing the code now all right now we're getting to the fun part we are going to actually write the code a code that makes this character which is one of ourselves dance simulating the

search for dance to narrow down to some options which are more dance related i play and just test and see which one i like more which i like this one so i choose it i currently have something here um i can add as many sounds as i want here but then in the code which is which one we want it to be played all right let's go to the code if i play start here i don't hear the music yet what i need to do is from the code tell the computer to play the sound so it should be probably under the sun category i go to the sound and then here we have start sound play sound star sound might work so let's drag it here uh i can put it on the top i can also put it inside if i put it on the top it won't sink forever it would go on until it's finished for a reason that i will tell you later i put it on the top so let's see how it looks okay looks fun i like it cool cool okay now we need to freeze the character but how let's do it this way uh we want to say we want to trigger freezing by pressing the spacebar so whenever i press the spacebar i want the action of freezing happen i also want all the music to be stopped and then instead i want someone or a music or something announces freeze and i want the sprite to stop moving or changing custom so let's see so i said i want an if condition i want to say if spacebar press so i drag the if condition after all these things i go to the sensing to field this condition i see here i have the option of key space pressed so if q space pressed i want to stop all the sun all the sounds stop all sounds and at the same time i want the character not to

waiting for three seconds after three seconds is moving again but you see it's moving but the sound didn't go back again because i never said now you can stop you can start playing the sound again so i need to do that but also i don't want only the music to stop and the character to sub i also want to announce freeze i want to announce freeze in two ways one from the looks i wanna say freeze so i say freeze so this phrase shows up it would be really cool if we can record our voice and say freeze also so i go to the sounds library and then i press the microphone and record my own voice so i say

code i go to the sounds and then start sound freeze so say freeze and start sound freeze and wait three seconds so that the character is not moving one more thing is you want the music to go back playing after this three seconds is over so again i say start sound this one dance around this time okay so let's see how it goes now i play stop space bar maybe three seconds is a little too low short i say six seconds again space bar now free one more thing we can do is let's add a backdrop to make it more fun so i go here to choose a backdrop something maybe a concert background now it's more fun cool all right now let's fix a little part that we have when i click spacebar this phrase does not go even after the time of the freeze is over so now the character is dancing but the freezes are still there in order to fix it what i can do is here instead of say freeze i go and say say freeze for two seconds so i'm gonna delete this and then i drag this one instead so that after two seconds that freeze is going and it's not showing up when the character the sprite is not frozen anymore so two seconds is gone and now when it's moving it's not here anymore so that's what we want yeah we're pretty much done with this dance freeze game we can do more things here we can add more characters more surprise so that it looks like a real party this is the final code so far i'm going to put the link on the on the description the link to the project on the sprite website so that you can go there and check it out well done everyone in this lesson you learn to create your very own dance freeze game do you like to create your own dance freeze party with all your friends in it ask them to create their sprite and send to you and come back next week and we will see how we can create a really big dance party with everyone in it everyone is invited we will see how we can take turns while dancing and how we can move around the stage if you like the video give it a thumbs up
