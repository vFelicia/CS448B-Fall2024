00:00 - hello and welcome to another kitty code
00:02 - ninja tutorial in this tutorial we're
00:05 - going to create an abstract art in
00:08 - scratch i'm going to show you a demo
00:11 - you can create an artistic work like
00:15 - this in just a few minutes
00:18 - stick around
00:20 - welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this
00:23 - is eddie and this is your place to learn
00:26 - to code and have fun i'm gonna call it
00:31 - abstract
00:33 - part
00:37 - okay
00:38 - goodbye sprite and then i need three
00:42 - dots that i'm gonna draw it
00:46 - so what i do is i take this and i'm
00:49 - gonna zoom
00:52 - and i'm drawing a little circle here
01:17 - i can see
01:18 - [Music]
01:20 - here we go
01:23 - and then let's go to the code i'm gonna
01:26 - name it
01:27 - dots
01:29 - one
01:31 - what i wanted to do is
01:34 - to
01:36 - move around
01:38 - the scene
01:39 - so the way i write this code is
01:42 - when
01:43 - start clicked
01:47 - i would say
01:50 - move
01:52 - 10 step
01:53 - and i'm gonna put it in a forever loop
01:56 - because i want repeat 30 actions
01:59 - repetitive movements
02:01 - so when start clicked i want it to move
02:04 - 10 step before move it should look at
02:07 - some direction so
02:09 - i say point in direction
02:14 - uh not 90 but i'm gonna take a random
02:18 - number so that every time
02:21 - it goes to a different
02:23 - points to different direction and moves
02:25 - to a different
02:27 - direction
02:30 - okay
02:31 - move ten steps forever and
02:35 - i want it to
02:37 - bounce back when it's hitting the ball
02:40 - so currently
02:43 - when it goes to the wall it doesn't
02:45 - bounce back
02:46 - so
02:48 - let's go to motion again and
02:51 - bounce
02:52 - back
02:55 - uh if on edge bounce
03:00 - so something like this
03:03 - would be created
03:04 - and then i want three or some more of
03:09 - this like three four
03:11 - so i'm gonna
03:13 - duplicate it
03:14 - two more times
03:17 - so
03:18 - i get an
03:19 - effect like this
03:21 - for
03:22 - now
03:23 - but then if you remember the demo that i
03:26 - showed there were some lines being drawn
03:28 - in between so
03:31 - in order to make that
03:33 - i'm gonna get one more duplicate but
03:36 - this time i don't
03:38 - want this code so i'm getting this
03:41 - so other
03:42 - other dots have the code in it
03:45 - but this one for the last one i'm gonna
03:48 - write a different code
03:51 - then i'm gonna name this one a drawing
03:57 - or just let's name it a pen so i'm going
04:00 - to lose this let's
04:02 - i'm going to name this pen
04:04 - and in order to distinguish it
04:06 - i'm going
04:08 - back to the paint
04:12 - i'm going back to the pen
04:16 - costume
04:18 - and i want to change the color to
04:21 - something different here
04:24 - so that i can differentiate this one
04:27 - from the other two that have a different
04:29 - purpose
04:31 - now my goal is i want my pen
04:35 - to go to
04:36 - dot one
04:38 - and then draw a line from dot one to dot
04:41 - two and then draw a line from
04:44 - dot two to dot three and repeat it
04:48 - for so many times
04:50 - so
04:52 - the way i do it is first i need to bring
04:55 - in the pen
04:57 - extension so that i get this beautiful
05:00 - useful
05:02 - codes and blocks of codes
05:04 - so let's write the code for this
05:08 - again
05:10 - when
05:11 - start clicked
05:14 - so i said firstly i want it to go to dot
05:17 - one assuming this one is this one is
05:19 - actually dot one so i wanted to go to
05:22 - dot one so i would say
05:27 - go to
05:30 - that one and then i want to put down the
05:33 - pen
05:35 - there is a code here
05:37 - which is
05:39 - hand down
05:42 - now
05:45 - now i wanna
05:46 - so
05:47 - now i'm here and then pen is down so if
05:50 - i go here i'm drawing a line so now i go
05:54 - to
05:58 - dot 2.
06:00 - so go to dot 2
06:04 - and go to that
06:07 - theory
06:09 - let's see what you're doing
06:12 - okay now i draw drew only two lines but
06:16 - i want more lines
06:18 - and also when i'm done i want the pen up
06:21 - so
06:24 - i'm gonna say
06:31 - pen up
06:33 - as well
06:35 - and now i need a forever
06:38 - loop
06:40 - or
06:41 - i can do forever or i can do maybe
06:44 - repeat
06:47 - many times
06:51 - like
06:53 - let's say 300 times
06:56 - start
06:58 - and you see very easily this beautiful
07:01 - pattern
07:02 - is made i hope you liked this video if

hello and welcome to another kitty code ninja tutorial in this tutorial we're going to create an abstract art in scratch i'm going to show you a demo you can create an artistic work like this in just a few minutes stick around welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun i'm gonna call it abstract part okay goodbye sprite and then i need three dots that i'm gonna draw it so what i do is i take this and i'm gonna zoom and i'm drawing a little circle here i can see here we go and then let's go to the code i'm gonna name it dots one what i wanted to do is to move around the scene so the way i write this code is when start clicked i would say move 10 step and i'm gonna put it in a forever loop because i want repeat 30 actions repetitive movements so when start clicked i want it to move 10 step before move it should look at some direction so i say point in direction uh not 90 but i'm gonna take a random number so that every time it goes to a different points to different direction and moves to a different direction okay move ten steps forever and i want it to bounce back when it's hitting the ball so currently when it goes to the wall it doesn't bounce back so let's go to motion again and bounce back uh if on edge bounce so something like this would be created and then i want three or some more of this like three four so i'm gonna duplicate it two more times so i get an effect like this for now but then if you remember the demo that i showed there were some lines being drawn in between so in order to make that i'm gonna get one more duplicate but this time i don't want this code so i'm getting this so other other dots have the code in it but this one for the last one i'm gonna write a different code then i'm gonna name this one a drawing or just let's name it a pen so i'm going to lose this let's i'm going to name this pen and in order to distinguish it i'm going back to the paint i'm going back to the pen costume and i want to change the color to something different here so that i can differentiate this one from the other two that have a different purpose now my goal is i want my pen to go to dot one and then draw a line from dot one to dot two and then draw a line from dot two to dot three and repeat it for so many times so the way i do it is first i need to bring in the pen extension so that i get this beautiful useful codes and blocks of codes so let's write the code for this again when start clicked so i said firstly i want it to go to dot one assuming this one is this one is actually dot one so i wanted to go to dot one so i would say go to that one and then i want to put down the pen there is a code here which is hand down now now i wanna so now i'm here and then pen is down so if i go here i'm drawing a line so now i go to dot 2. so go to dot 2 and go to that theory let's see what you're doing okay now i draw drew only two lines but i want more lines and also when i'm done i want the pen up so i'm gonna say pen up as well and now i need a forever loop or i can do forever or i can do maybe repeat many times like let's say 300 times start and you see very easily this beautiful pattern is made i hope you liked this video if you did please press like subscribe and hit the bell so that you will see when i upload a new video
