00:00 - hello hello hello how are you doing i
00:02 - hope you are all feeling
00:05 - awesome
00:06 - in this tutorial which is the part two
00:09 - of our basketball game we're gonna
00:11 - complete the basketball game by adding
00:14 - a hoop and counting the scores
00:17 - stick around
00:19 - welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this
00:22 - is eddie and this is your place to learn
00:25 - to code and have fun so i'm clicking on
00:28 - this folder so that i can go to my stuff
00:33 - and then i can find my previous project
00:36 - which was
00:37 - this one
00:40 - cyclics inside
00:44 - so
00:45 - so far
00:46 - we have a player ai the basketball game
00:49 - and if i press start
00:52 - and then i press the space bar again
00:54 - through a ball and then the ai is
00:57 - throwing it back to me
00:59 - and by up and down
01:02 - as well as right and left i can move the
01:05 - cat
01:07 - but
01:09 - we are missing the main part of the
01:11 - basketball game which is we need to be
01:14 - able to
01:15 - through the ball into the hoop
01:18 - and we need to be able to count the
01:21 - score so that's what we are gonna do
01:24 - today
01:25 - so i need a hoop
01:27 - on my
01:28 - backdrop i already see a hoop but i'm
01:32 - not gonna use this because it's
01:35 - static so it's not much fun
01:38 - instead i'm gonna create a new sprite
01:44 - i
01:45 - actually i'm going to draw it by myself
01:48 - so i go to the paint
01:53 - and then just let's take this one
01:57 - and then
01:58 - i want the fill to be
02:01 - white
02:04 - and the outline
02:05 - to be black
02:08 - so
02:09 - i'm drawing this hoop
02:11 - and then i will target to shoot the ball
02:15 - inside this hoop
02:18 - and it should be a bit smaller
02:22 - a little bit more
02:27 - something about this size so that it
02:30 - won't be
02:31 - super challenging
02:33 - i can also to make it more like an
02:36 - actual hoop
02:38 - i can
02:41 - and one white line is left i'm gonna
02:44 - delete it
02:47 - okay i want the black fell
02:53 - a little better
02:58 - anyway
02:59 - it's just a demo you can take your time
03:01 - and draw properly one thing that is
03:05 - important is
03:09 - let's first
03:11 - make this
03:15 - don't feel
03:16 - so that is transparent
03:18 - by clicking here
03:21 - and also
03:24 - how do i wanna target inside this basket
03:28 - to make that possible
03:30 - so i'm gonna take one specific color
03:33 - that i don't have it in this backdrop
03:36 - so let's say i don't have any green here
03:40 - or yellow here so i'm gonna take a color
03:43 - from here
03:45 - and then
03:48 - i'm just putting a small
03:53 - let's take a sip
03:54 - i'm putting a small circle
03:57 - with this green color
04:00 - right here in the middle just it can be
04:03 - as tiny as you want
04:08 - okay
04:10 - here we go and the outline
04:14 - now outline
04:16 - so if i zoom
04:18 - you see i put this little circle a
04:20 - little green thing
04:22 - so that i choose it
04:24 - for my target
04:29 - and then
04:30 - let's
04:30 - [Music]
04:32 - press ctrl a and group them all together
04:37 - and i can
04:38 - play with the sides a little
04:42 - alright
04:43 - so i have this basket
04:47 - now i'm temporarily
04:50 - removing the stage backdrop so that you
04:53 - can see easier but it can
04:56 - actually stay
04:59 - so
05:00 - i'm just changing it for now
05:04 - to plain one into a plain backdrop so
05:07 - that it's just easier for the demo but
05:09 - you can layer a stitch
05:11 - all right
05:13 - so
05:14 - the code for
05:16 - the hoop oh one more thing i also need a
05:19 - variable
05:20 - named
05:21 - score so that i can count the scores
05:25 - that i'm gaining
05:28 - okay i have the score as well
05:30 - now let's write a code for this hoop
05:34 - so that it glides around the screen
05:37 - in this area
05:39 - and then
05:40 - so that the cat can follow it so
05:43 - what i'm gonna write is
05:45 - when
05:46 - start clicked i want some
05:50 - constant movement of the basket the hoop
05:54 - so i would say
05:56 - forever
05:59 - glide
06:03 - in
06:04 - a few seconds five sets second let's say
06:07 - uh i meant to take this one glide
06:10 - five seconds to
06:13 - some random egg some random y so i'm
06:16 - going to operator
06:18 - and pick a random x
06:21 - pick a random y
06:24 - but i want to make sure that
06:26 - the y is nothing below
06:29 - this line because
06:32 - it's it's a hoop right so it shouldn't
06:34 - be too low
06:37 - so
06:38 - let's say
06:45 - from
06:47 - 20
06:49 - to
06:52 - 200
06:55 - and for the
06:58 - x
06:59 - it can be
07:00 - anywhere along this line so let's say
07:04 - minus 20 to
07:06 - 200 let's see what happens
07:10 - so
07:11 - yeah you see the hoop is just moving
07:13 - around randomly and now
07:16 - i should try
07:18 - jumping and throwing the ball
07:22 - and of course every time that i
07:25 - can hit the basket i'm supposed to gain
07:29 - score
07:30 - [Music]
07:31 - okay now
07:33 - let's write the code for gaining the
07:35 - score currently it shows the score 14
07:38 - that's not what we want
07:41 - we want the initial
07:43 - at the start of the game we want the
07:44 - score to be zero so what i can do is
07:49 - i can first say
07:53 - when
07:54 - start clicked
07:59 - set
08:02 - score to zero
08:04 - so that's how we start the game at this
08:07 - point
08:08 - here we had a code for throwing the ball
08:11 - by pressing the space
08:15 - the ball is
08:16 - reaching the player
08:20 - and then it's diagonally going up
08:23 - rotates
08:24 - and moves up so what i want is whenever
08:28 - i'm
08:30 - throwing the ball if
08:34 - this spot touch the screen dot then i
08:38 - can gain a score so
08:40 - let's reset the score to zero
08:45 - so how can i say when i'm touching that
08:47 - green dots i gain score
08:51 - what i can do is
08:54 - [Music]
08:55 - here
08:56 - i repeat
08:58 - so the ball goes up
09:01 - and then i just want to detect this dot
09:03 - so i would say if
09:15 - on the sensing
09:18 - touching color so i click here and then
09:22 - i
09:23 - click on the color picker
09:25 - and put it here
09:29 - if touching the color green
09:33 - now
09:36 - change
09:40 - the score
09:42 - by one
09:44 - but then since we are in the loop
09:50 - i don't want the score to keep going up
09:52 - until it's hitting the ground so i'm
09:55 - gonna put a weight here so that the
09:57 - score goes only one up at each time that
10:01 - i'm hitting the green dot inside the
10:03 - basket or basically when i'm throwing
10:06 - the ball
10:07 - in the basket
10:09 - so let's just take a weight
10:12 - and control
10:14 - and wait
10:16 - let's say six seconds
10:21 - so here we go
10:24 - now i can through the ball and if i
10:27 - manage to hit the green
10:33 - that i can gain a score but currently
10:36 - you see the ball is coming very slowly
10:39 - towards me so what i'm gonna do is
10:42 - going to ai
10:46 - in
10:47 - or in the ai is waiting one second to
10:51 - throwing the ball
10:53 - i can
10:54 - remove this one second
10:59 - also on the ball
11:02 - here it takes three seconds for the aoi
11:05 - to glide the bolt
11:07 - to the player i'm gonna change this to
11:09 - one second as well so that is faster
11:13 - now
11:14 - it's much smoother so
11:21 - it's a little too fast now so let's put
11:24 - the weight here back again
11:28 - so here is the key
11:31 - oops i got one scar yay
11:36 - okay so
11:38 - this is
11:40 - how we count and how we play
11:43 - if i want it to be easier
11:47 - i can
11:48 - change this to
11:51 - to a higher number so that this glass is
11:53 - slower the the
11:55 - hoof is not moving super fast so it's
11:58 - easier for me to play
12:01 - but here is basically the style
12:06 - and any time that i press start i'm
12:10 - losing all my scores so
12:14 - make sure not to
12:16 - replay the start
12:18 - until you are finished
12:22 - so
12:23 - yeah here it is and now we can put back
12:26 - the backdrop
12:31 - the basketball
12:33 - i hope you liked this tutorial if you
12:36 - did don't forget to like subscribe and
12:39 - hit the bell so that you don't miss the
12:41 - next tutorial and see you soon next week
12:44 - bye

it's not much fun instead i'm gonna create a new sprite i actually i'm going to draw it by myself so i go to the paint and then just let's take this one and then i want the fill to be white and the outline to be black so i'm drawing this hoop and then i will target to shoot the ball inside this hoop and it should be a bit smaller a little bit more something about this size so that it won't be super challenging i can also to make it more like an actual hoop i can and one white line is left i'm gonna delete it okay i want the black fell a little better anyway it's just a demo you can take your time and draw properly one thing that is important is let's first make this don't feel so that is transparent by clicking here and also how do i wanna target inside this basket to make that possible so i'm gonna take one specific color that i don't have it in this backdrop so let's say i don't have any green here or yellow here so i'm gonna take a color from here and then i'm just putting a small let's take a sip i'm putting a small circle with this green color right here in the middle just it can be as tiny as you want okay here we go and the outline now outline so if i zoom you see i put this little circle a little green thing so that i choose it for my target and then let's press ctrl a and group them all together and i can play with the sides a little alright so i have this basket now i'm temporarily removing the stage backdrop so that you can see easier but it can actually stay so i'm just changing it for now to plain one into a plain backdrop so that it's just easier for the demo but you can layer a stitch all right so the code for the hoop oh one more thing i also need a variable named score so that i can count the scores that i'm gaining okay i have the score as well now let's write a code for this hoop so that it glides around the screen in this area and then so that the cat can follow it so what i'm gonna write is when start clicked i want some constant movement of the basket the hoop so i would say forever glide in a few seconds five sets second let's say uh i meant to take this one glide five seconds to some random egg some random y so i'm going to operator and pick a random x pick a random y but i want to make sure that the y is nothing below this line because it's it's a hoop right so it shouldn't be too low so let's say from 20 to 200 and for the x it can be anywhere along this line so let's say minus 20 to 200 let's see what happens so yeah you see the hoop is just moving around randomly and now i should try jumping and throwing the ball and of course every time that i can hit the basket i'm supposed to gain score okay now let's write the code for gaining the score currently it shows the score 14 that's not what we want we want the initial at the start of the game we want the score to be zero so what i can do is i can first say when start clicked set score to zero so that's how we start the game at this point
