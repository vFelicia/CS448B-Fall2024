00:08 - hey
00:13 - do you like to learn how to make this
00:17 - let's see welcome to kitty code ninja
00:20 - tutorials
00:21 - this is ellie and this is your place to
00:24 - learn to code and have fun
00:25 - hello everyone welcome to another
00:28 - tutorial
00:29 - in this tutorial we are going to see how
00:32 - we can have a really big dance party
00:35 - we will see how we can take turn when we
00:38 - have a lot of people on the floor
00:41 - we will invite each other in the middle
00:43 - of the dance floor
00:44 - and take turns while dancing did you
00:47 - watch the dance feeds party last week
00:50 - if no i put the link below so that you
00:53 - can go
00:53 - and watch it on your own time if not
00:57 - it's not a problem you can join us in
00:59 - this tutorial
01:00 - we will start everything from the
01:03 - scratch
01:04 - and we will code in scratch let's dive
01:06 - in
01:07 - all right in order to create this dance
01:10 - body
01:11 - we need to follow five simple steps
01:14 - and then we need to write it in a
01:16 - language that computer can understand so
01:20 - there are three main steps which
01:23 - are number one go to the center of dance
01:26 - floor and then so we tell the sprite to
01:29 - go to the center of dance floor
01:31 - and dance then we need to tell the
01:34 - sprite to send the message to the next
01:36 - dancer to come to the stage
01:39 - and third one we need to tell the stride
01:42 - to go to a side and let the next dancer
01:45 - come in
01:46 - these three steps are the main
01:49 - steps that are operating the whole dance
01:53 - scenario and then there are two more
01:56 - which is playing a dance music
01:58 - and setting the backdrop and changing
02:00 - the lighting effects
02:02 - which are basically to make it more
02:04 - exciting
02:06 - let's go and see how we can write it
02:09 - in the language of computer
02:13 - alright let's see how we can tell the
02:14 - computer to do these things
02:16 - first we go to scratch.mit.edu
02:22 - and then i click create
02:34 - i delete this cat because i don't need
02:35 - it i'm gonna
02:37 - import three sprites which are my
02:39 - dancers
02:41 - so i click here
02:44 - i choose the dance category
02:48 - then i can choose as many dancers as i
02:51 - want or i can import
02:53 - more dancers from my own computer
02:58 - i choose this one
03:04 - and also
03:12 - i choose the sprite of myself in order
03:16 - to see how you can have the sprite of
03:18 - yourself
03:19 - watch my previous video the link is in
03:22 - the description
03:23 - you don't have to use your own sprite
03:26 - but it's even more fun to have your own
03:30 - sprite on the dance stage
03:33 - all right so i import mine
03:41 - and let's have one more you can import
03:45 - as many dancers
03:46 - as i want in this video i'm showing with
03:49 - three
03:53 - i need to make sure that every sprite
03:56 - has various
03:57 - costumes because each costume
04:00 - is going to be used as a dance pose so
04:04 - this one has which is good
04:08 - this one should have as well and then
04:12 - the one that i imported i'm gonna add
04:14 - more costumes to it
04:16 - so i choose it i go to the costume tab
04:19 - and from here
04:22 - not here back
04:26 - back back
04:36 - i'm gonna choose more customs
04:39 - by uploading from my computer
04:44 - so i upload all the
04:47 - dance poses that i have here
04:53 - all right now we have three
04:56 - sprites with three dance poses now it's
05:00 - time to tell them
05:01 - first dance
05:08 - okay
05:12 - let's start with this one
05:17 - the code for writing the dance is
05:20 - first of all we need to trigger the
05:23 - start button
05:24 - so
05:27 - let's say this sprite is going to
05:30 - start the dancing every first
05:34 - action should be started by when start
05:37 - clicked
05:40 - so i go to the event so i drag when
05:43 - start clicked
05:47 - repeat maybe
05:52 - five times and then i go to the looks
05:59 - change to the next costume
06:03 - by this code this character
06:06 - goes from one costume to another costume
06:09 - five times so it should look like as
06:12 - it's dancing
06:13 - let's see
06:16 - it does but it's so fast so in order to
06:19 - make it more like a dance
06:21 - we go to the control and add
06:25 - some weight in between poses
06:29 - weight zero
06:34 - 0.3 seconds let's test it
06:39 - it's good
06:43 - all right we said that the second step
06:48 - is that each dancer is calling
06:51 - another dancer to the center of the
06:54 - dance floor
06:56 - so let's see how we can do it
07:00 - let's give each character a name so that
07:03 - we can
07:04 - call them juvie
07:08 - okay let's say
07:12 - this one is judy
07:17 - let's call this guy
07:23 - alex and then
07:28 - ellie all right
07:33 - now
07:37 - this one is dancing and then he's going
07:40 - to call
07:40 - another one for calling there is
07:43 - something
07:44 - on the events which is called broadcast
07:48 - so
07:49 - broadcast message one which is calling
07:52 - the other
07:52 - dancer
07:56 - i'm going to broadcast and then
07:59 - i'm creating a new message from here
08:05 - which i say
08:11 - judy's turn
08:18 - okay so broadcast judy's turn
08:25 - so this dancer is dancing five times
08:29 - and then calling the other one so i go
08:32 - to judy
08:35 - and then i say when
08:39 - i receive judy's turn
08:44 - now it's time to for this one to test
08:47 - when i receive judy's turn
08:54 - repeat so the same code for the dance is
08:58 - from the control
09:04 - repeat five times
09:09 - go to the next costume
09:12 - and then i need a bit of weight in
09:13 - between to slow down the changes of the
09:17 - moves
09:20 - wait wait wait
09:24 - it should go inside
09:30 - so when i receive judy's turn i repeat
09:33 - five times next costume and i wait
09:36 - let's run it and see what happens so
09:39 - this one is dancing
09:42 - and then next one dances five times
09:51 - so one more thing we need to add is
09:55 - when alex called ellie
09:59 - ellie should receive it so
10:02 - again here we need to write similar code
10:05 - for eddie as well
10:07 - so i say when i receive
10:13 - ellie's turn
10:17 - again same as the other ones repeat
10:22 - five times or how many times do you like
10:27 - go to next costume
10:32 - a little weight in between
10:37 - and 0.3
10:41 - and then i'm gonna call judy
10:45 - again so from the events
10:49 - broadcast
10:53 - judy's turn
10:57 - now we should this
11:01 - three people should dance forever
11:02 - everyone is calling the next person
11:08 - all right
11:14 - one more thing we're gonna do is that we
11:17 - want
11:17 - every character every dancer that wants
11:20 - to dance
11:21 - go to the middle of the stage which is
11:25 - this place location zero zero zero we
11:28 - can see the location from here so if i
11:30 - say zero
11:31 - zero zero is where is the center of the
11:35 - screen
11:36 - so we have x and y
11:40 - axis here
11:45 - so in order to
11:50 - locate everyone that is going to the
11:53 - stage
11:54 - in the middle of the screen we can go to
11:57 - the motion
12:00 - and then say go to x and y
12:03 - 0 0. so when i receive it's my turn to
12:06 - dance
12:08 - i go to
12:14 - this location
12:17 - zero and
12:20 - zero and when i'm done
12:24 - with dancing
12:27 - i call the next person and i also
12:32 - move away from the center so i can do
12:35 - glide one second
12:39 - because i wanted to horizontally just go
12:42 - to some direction left or right
12:46 - i keep the y as zero and i
12:49 - change this one to some number like
12:52 - 100 let's test it and see how it looks
12:55 - like
12:57 - so i stop i play
13:06 - it dances and it goes away i do
13:09 - this for another for the other
13:12 - characters as well
13:14 - so any character that is called to go to
13:18 - the dance floor
13:19 - goes to the center and then
13:22 - when it's done glides to the
13:26 - corner so i write it for alex
13:32 - when i receive turn go to
13:35 - zero zero
13:41 - and when i'm done
13:45 - glide to actually not random
13:48 - position glide to
13:53 - location maybe minus
14:00 - 100 and zero
14:04 - and do this the same thing for judy
14:09 - go to zero
14:13 - zero and then at the end
14:20 - glide location x
14:25 - 140 and 0.
14:27 - let's test it and see how it looks like
14:30 - i play
14:32 - so ellie dances
14:35 - goes to the corner so you see everyone
14:38 - that dances
14:40 - moves away and then the next one comes
14:43 - to the center
14:45 - just like a real party
14:49 - you can give your project a proper name
14:52 - from here
14:53 - which i call it dance party 2.
14:58 - and also
15:01 - we can add one thing
15:04 - which is everyone that is coming to the
15:07 - middle
15:08 - see a cloud on top of their head saying
15:12 - like i'm coming or basically showing
15:17 - that they are saying something
15:22 - so i go to le
15:25 - when i receive is my turn i go to this
15:28 - location
15:29 - and i want to see
15:33 - i want to say by
15:38 - writing
15:43 - ellie is coming
15:50 - actually less
15:56 - do it for like ellie is coming
16:00 - this one let's say this one
16:06 - l is coming for a short amount of time
16:10 - so i say say
16:14 - it is
16:19 - coming for maybe one second and then
16:22 - i don't want it to remain forever
16:28 - let's do this for other characters as
16:30 - well so
16:31 - from the looks
16:35 - as soon as it was called i can
16:38 - say
16:42 - hello alex
16:45 - is here and then the same for judy
16:56 - my turn
17:00 - judy is coming
17:05 - and also for one second
17:16 - now
17:19 - i i stop and play to see how it looks
17:22 - like
17:28 - all right now we have two more things to
17:31 - do
17:32 - adding a music and a backdrop
17:35 - and a light and the lighting let's see
17:40 - okay let's add a music to it as well so
17:43 - in order to have a music you first need
17:46 - to go to the sounds and add the music
17:48 - here first so i go here
17:51 - upload the sound upload sound
17:56 - actually if you want to choose some
17:58 - sound from your computer you go to
17:59 - upload sounds
18:01 - otherwise it's easier to just
18:07 - click here and choose a sound
18:10 - i can narrow down
18:13 - to dance and
18:16 - [Music]
18:19 - choose something
18:22 - [Music]
18:26 - i choose this one
18:29 - so now i have a song
18:33 - i go to my code currently
18:36 - the computer doesn't know that it should
18:38 - use the sound so i need to write a code
18:40 - to tell the computer to play the sound
18:43 - so in order to do that i say
18:47 - when i start click because i want this
18:49 - one to happen as soon as
18:51 - the start is clicked so from the events
18:55 - when start clicked
19:02 - repeat 10 times
19:05 - and then under sound
19:08 - play sound dance until done so i want it
19:11 - to be played 10 times
19:15 - but you can choose how many times that
19:17 - you like
19:18 - so i play and see
19:25 - so cool yay
19:29 - [Music]
19:33 - all right
19:38 - what else now we can add a backdrop as
19:41 - well
19:42 - let's go here
19:45 - and then let's choose a backdrop that is
19:48 - nice for a dance stage
19:52 - i like this one and this one
19:57 - let's do this one spotlight so i have a
20:00 - backdrop
20:01 - and one more thing we can do is
20:04 - to change the backdrop
20:08 - lighting so that it looks like the
20:12 - light is changing behind
20:18 - in scratch there is something which is
20:20 - really really cool
20:21 - which is color effect if i go to
20:24 - this backdrop if i click on here i can
20:28 - write a color effect code for the
20:30 - backdrop so that the lighting would be
20:32 - changed so
20:33 - again when start click
20:43 - then i go to the looks
20:47 - and then change color effect by
20:50 - something and i'm gonna repeat this
20:54 - action i'm going to say do this
20:58 - thing forever so
21:01 - i say forever
21:04 - change color effect by 25
21:08 - and maybe i can put some weight in
21:10 - between so that i see
21:11 - one color and then i wait a bit and then
21:14 - another color
21:14 - so wait
21:18 - maybe one second two seconds or
21:22 - whatever you like maybe just yeah let's
21:25 - play and see how it looks
21:32 - you see the color is being changed
21:36 - [Music]
21:38 - we are done with this tutorial well done
21:41 - everyone i'm so proud of you
21:43 - i hope you follow the line
21:46 - feel free to pause the repeat the video
21:49 - and pause whenever you like

21:54 - [Music]
21:55 - i put the link in the description so
21:57 - that you can go to the
21:59 - scratch website and check it out if you
22:01 - want it
22:02 - so that you have access to the whole
22:04 - code
22:05 - share your project with us so that we
22:07 - will see what you have done
22:08 - if you have any idea feel free to put it
22:11 - in the comments

Cleaned transcript:

hey do you like to learn how to make this let's see welcome to kitty code ninja tutorials this is ellie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun hello everyone welcome to another tutorial in this tutorial we are going to see how we can have a really big dance party we will see how we can take turn when we have a lot of people on the floor we will invite each other in the middle of the dance floor and take turns while dancing did you watch the dance feeds party last week if no i put the link below so that you can go and watch it on your own time if not it's not a problem you can join us in this tutorial we will start everything from the scratch and we will code in scratch let's dive in all right in order to create this dance body we need to follow five simple steps and then we need to write it in a language that computer can understand so there are three main steps which are number one go to the center of dance floor and then so we tell the sprite to go to the center of dance floor and dance then we need to tell the sprite to send the message to the next dancer to come to the stage and third one we need to tell the stride to go to a side and let the next dancer come in these three steps are the main steps that are operating the whole dance scenario and then there are two more which is playing a dance music and setting the backdrop and changing the lighting effects which are basically to make it more exciting let's go and see how we can write it in the language of computer alright let's see how we can tell the computer to do these things first we go to scratch.mit.edu and then i click create i delete this cat because i don't need it i'm gonna import three sprites which are my dancers so i click here i choose the dance category then i can choose as many dancers as i want or i can import more dancers from my own computer i choose this one and also i choose the sprite of myself in order to see how you can have the sprite of yourself watch my previous video the link is in the description you don't have to use your own sprite but it's even more fun to have your own sprite on the dance stage all right so i import mine and let's have one more you can import as many dancers as i want in this video i'm showing with three i need to make sure that every sprite has various costumes because each costume is going to be used as a dance pose so this one has which is good this one should have as well and then the one that i imported i'm gonna add more costumes to it so i choose it i go to the costume tab and from here not here back back back i'm gonna choose more customs by uploading from my computer so i upload all the dance poses that i have here all right now we have three sprites with three dance poses now it's time to tell them first dance okay let's start with this one the code for writing the dance is first of all we need to trigger the start button so let's say this sprite is going to start the dancing every first action should be started by when start clicked so i go to the event so i drag when start clicked repeat maybe five times and then i go to the looks change to the next costume by this code this character goes from one costume to another costume five times so it should look like as it's dancing let's see it does but it's so fast so in order to make it more like a dance we go to the control and add some weight in between poses weight zero 0.3 seconds let's test it it's good all right we said that the second step is that each dancer is calling another dancer to the center of the dance floor so let's see how we can do it let's give each character a name so that we can call them juvie okay let's say this one is judy let's call this guy alex and then ellie all right now this one is dancing and then he's going to call another one for calling there is something on the events which is called broadcast so broadcast message one which is calling the other dancer i'm going to broadcast and then i'm creating a new message from here which i say judy's turn okay so broadcast judy's turn so this dancer is dancing five times and then calling the other one so i go to judy and then i say when i receive judy's turn now it's time to for this one to test when i receive judy's turn repeat so the same code for the dance is from the control repeat five times go to the next costume and then i need a bit of weight in between to slow down the changes of the moves wait wait wait it should go inside so when i receive judy's turn i repeat five times next costume and i wait let's run it and see what happens so this one is dancing and then next one dances five times so one more thing we need to add is when alex called ellie ellie should receive it so again here we need to write similar code for eddie as well so i say when i receive ellie's turn again same as the other ones repeat five times or how many times do you like go to next costume a little weight in between and 0.3 and then i'm gonna call judy again so from the events broadcast judy's turn now we should this three people should dance forever everyone is calling the next person all right one more thing we're gonna do is that we want every character every dancer that wants to dance go to the middle of the stage which is this place location zero zero zero we can see the location from here so if i say zero zero zero is where is the center of the screen so we have x and y axis here so in order to locate everyone that is going to the stage in the middle of the screen we can go to the motion and then say go to x and y 0 0. so when i receive it's my turn to dance i go to this location zero and zero and when i'm done with dancing i call the next person and i also move away from the center so i can do glide one second because i wanted to horizontally just go to some direction left or right i keep the y as zero and i change this one to some number like 100 let's test it and see how it looks like so i stop i play it dances and it goes away i do this for another for the other characters as well so any character that is called to go to the dance floor goes to the center and then when it's done glides to the corner so i write it for alex when i receive turn go to zero zero and when i'm done glide to actually not random position glide to location maybe minus 100 and zero and do this the same thing for judy go to zero zero and then at the end glide location x 140 and 0. let's test it and see how it looks like i play so ellie dances goes to the corner so you see everyone that dances moves away and then the next one comes to the center just like a real party you can give your project a proper name from here which i call it dance party 2. and also we can add one thing which is everyone that is coming to the middle see a cloud on top of their head saying like i'm coming or basically showing that they are saying something so i go to le when i receive is my turn i go to this location and i want to see i want to say by writing ellie is coming actually less do it for like ellie is coming this one let's say this one l is coming for a short amount of time so i say say it is coming for maybe one second and then i don't want it to remain forever let's do this for other characters as well so from the looks as soon as it was called i can say hello alex is here and then the same for judy my turn judy is coming and also for one second now i i stop and play to see how it looks like all right now we have two more things to do adding a music and a backdrop and a light and the lighting let's see okay let's add a music to it as well so in order to have a music you first need to go to the sounds and add the music here first so i go here upload the sound upload sound actually if you want to choose some sound from your computer you go to upload sounds otherwise it's easier to just click here and choose a sound i can narrow down to dance and choose something i choose this one so now i have a song i go to my code currently the computer doesn't know that it should use the sound so i need to write a code to tell the computer to play the sound so in order to do that i say when i start click because i want this one to happen as soon as the start is clicked so from the events when start clicked repeat 10 times and then under sound play sound dance until done so i want it to be played 10 times but you can choose how many times that you like so i play and see so cool yay all right what else now we can add a backdrop as well let's go here and then let's choose a backdrop that is nice for a dance stage i like this one and this one let's do this one spotlight so i have a backdrop and one more thing we can do is to change the backdrop lighting so that it looks like the light is changing behind in scratch there is something which is really really cool which is color effect if i go to this backdrop if i click on here i can write a color effect code for the backdrop so that the lighting would be changed so again when start
