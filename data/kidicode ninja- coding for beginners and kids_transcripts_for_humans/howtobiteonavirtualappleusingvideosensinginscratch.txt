00:00 - hello and welcome back to another kitty
00:02 - code ninja tutorial
00:03 - this is eddie and this is your place to
00:06 - learn to code and have fun
00:08 - in this tutorial we're going to learn
00:11 - about video
00:12 - sensing video sensing is a way
00:16 - that we can interact with our scratch
00:18 - project
00:19 - using the webcam on our computer like
00:25 - [Music]
00:28 - this
00:35 - let's dive in
00:38 - let's go to scratch.edu.mit
00:49 - then we create a new project
00:58 - let's give our project a name
01:04 - video
01:10 - something
01:16 - we don't need the cat uh
01:20 - so we're going to make exactly the demo
01:23 - that i
01:23 - showed you so
01:27 - we need a sprite which is
01:31 - an apple
01:39 - for this
01:42 - sprite
01:47 - i look at the costumes it doesn't have
01:49 - any
01:50 - other costume so i duplicate it
01:54 - and then i delete
01:59 - the extra parts using this
02:02 - eraser so that it looks like
02:05 - it's been hidden
02:14 - okay so i call it
02:20 - apple
02:30 - and then we need the
02:33 - sound that is the sound of biting the
02:37 - apple so i'm gonna import that as well
02:41 - from the sound library
02:43 - [Music]
02:44 - i search for white
02:48 - since i already know it exists so if i
02:50 - import it
02:52 - and i don't need this one so i delete
02:55 - this
02:57 - that's pretty much what we need plus
03:02 - um
03:07 - so i click on this to make this my main
03:10 - sprite i also need to import
03:14 - the video sensing
03:18 - blocks so i click here
03:22 - and then i choose video sensing
03:28 - all right so the blocks relevant to it
03:30 - is
03:31 - there you might get a notification that
03:34 - asks you to
03:35 - allow the webcam in that case you need
03:38 - to say yes
03:41 - and now
03:49 - okay we say
03:52 - when start clicked
04:02 - first thing i want to make sure that
04:04 - this
04:05 - webcam is on this video sensing is on
04:09 - so i drag this
04:12 - turn video on and then
04:17 - i need to do two sets of
04:21 - actions one is relevant to the
04:24 - movements of this apple and the other
04:27 - one is about
04:30 - sensing the apple sensing my movements
04:34 - using my video and reacting to it
04:38 - through the apple like interacting with
04:41 - the app
04:44 - so i need to have a
04:48 - repetitive set of actions so i go
04:51 - and drag forever from control
04:56 - forever
05:00 - i'm going to move the apple and
05:03 - so like i want to move and turn and
05:06 - whenever i get to the
05:08 - edges i want to bounce back so that the
05:10 - apple
05:11 - is moving around so
05:14 - from the motions i would say
05:20 - move four steps
05:24 - and then turn
05:29 - um i don't want it to be 15
05:33 - i want it to be random number so i go to
05:39 - operations
05:42 - and then i drag this one
05:45 - pick a random
05:51 - degree between
05:57 - let's see if i can make this smaller
06:06 - minus 30 and
06:12 - 30 and then
06:16 - i need
06:22 - i also want to make sure when this
06:26 - apple is hitting the edges it's bouncing
06:29 - back so there is a block of code for it
06:32 - in the motion
06:34 - which says
06:38 - if on edge bounce
06:45 - okay so this is about our movement
06:49 - and also i want
06:52 - another set of actions which is about
06:55 - interacting with the apple
06:58 - uh what i want is whenever my video
07:01 - motions
07:02 - is touching the apple in that case i
07:05 - want some
07:06 - change to happen like biting the apple
07:08 - so like when i
07:10 - wetting it i want the apple to be
07:13 - to look different so
07:17 - going to the operation i need a specific
07:21 - condition actually going to control
07:26 - if then block sit inside the fervor
07:32 - and
07:35 - i drag this operation for the sensing
07:40 - there is always need of this
07:44 - comparison so that we we want to define
07:48 - how sensitive we want the interaction to
07:51 - be like if do i need to really
07:54 - uh wave fast move fast or just a slow
07:57 - movement
07:58 - is enough so
08:02 - if i reduce the number it means that
08:04 - very
08:06 - little movements work if i
08:09 - make it bigger it means a lot of
08:11 - movement so
08:13 - go to the video sensing
08:18 - if video motion
08:21 - on sprite is equal to
08:24 - let's say 20
08:28 - so like 20 movements is noticed
08:31 - under this apple in that case
08:34 - i want to do something which is
08:38 - i want to create a budding sound
08:41 - so i go to the sound first and then i
08:45 - say
08:46 - start sound bite
08:52 - let's play and see what is happening so
08:54 - far
09:01 - so so it worked one time so it means
09:05 - that i need one more forever
09:08 - for this apparently
09:13 - so i drag this
09:19 - let's try one more time
09:27 - [Applause]
09:29 - that's what i want but
09:32 - i don't want it that fast i also
09:36 - want to switch to the shape of apple
09:40 - that looks like an eaten apple like this
09:42 - one
09:44 - so i say switch costume as well
09:47 - from the looks
09:51 - switch switch stitch switch custom to
09:56 - apple hidden it should be eat an apple
09:58 - but we know what we say
10:02 - i also put a weight here
10:05 - control control
10:08 - wait a bit
10:15 - one third of second almost
10:18 - and then height
10:22 - so i hide it so that it looks like the
10:25 - apple is
10:30 - finished
10:33 - and then switch back to
10:37 - the full apple castle
10:41 - switch back to
10:46 - apple switch back to apple
10:51 - um one more ways and then
10:54 - join the apple
11:01 - so look and show
11:04 - let's show the apple
11:08 - let's show the apple
11:12 - a tiny bit of weight again so i just
11:15 - keep
11:15 - waiting and waiting so that it looks
11:17 - like different apples are coming
11:22 - and go to a new position
11:26 - just a random position
11:29 - go to random position
11:34 - less right
11:49 - feel free to remix it and leave your
11:53 - projects in the comments

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome back to another kitty code ninja tutorial this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun in this tutorial we're going to learn about video sensing video sensing is a way that we can interact with our scratch project using the webcam on our computer like this let's dive in let's go to scratch.edu.mit then we create a new project let's give our project a name video something we don't need the cat uh so we're going to make exactly the demo that i showed you so we need a sprite which is an apple for this sprite i look at the costumes it doesn't have any other costume so i duplicate it and then i delete the extra parts using this eraser so that it looks like it's been hidden okay so i call it apple and then we need the sound that is the sound of biting the apple so i'm gonna import that as well from the sound library i search for white since i already know it exists so if i import it and i don't need this one so i delete this that's pretty much what we need plus um so i click on this to make this my main sprite i also need to import the video sensing blocks so i click here and then i choose video sensing all right so the blocks relevant to it is there you might get a notification that asks you to allow the webcam in that case you need to say yes and now okay we say when start clicked first thing i want to make sure that this webcam is on this video sensing is on so i drag this turn video on and then i need to do two sets of actions one is relevant to the movements of this apple and the other one is about sensing the apple sensing my movements using my video and reacting to it through the apple like interacting with the app so i need to have a repetitive set of actions so i go and drag forever from control forever i'm going to move the apple and so like i want to move and turn and whenever i get to the edges i want to bounce back so that the apple is moving around so from the motions i would say move four steps and then turn um i don't want it to be 15 i want it to be random number so i go to operations and then i drag this one pick a random degree between let's see if i can make this smaller minus 30 and 30 and then i need i also want to make sure when this apple is hitting the edges it's bouncing back so there is a block of code for it in the motion which says if on edge bounce okay so this is about our movement and also i want another set of actions which is about interacting with the apple uh what i want is whenever my video motions is touching the apple in that case i want some change to happen like biting the apple so like when i wetting it i want the apple to be to look different so going to the operation i need a specific condition actually going to control if then block sit inside the fervor and i drag this operation for the sensing there is always need of this comparison so that we we want to define how sensitive we want the interaction to be like if do i need to really uh wave fast move fast or just a slow movement is enough so if i reduce the number it means that very little movements work if i make it bigger it means a lot of movement so go to the video sensing if video motion on sprite is equal to let's say 20 so like 20 movements is noticed under this apple in that case i want to do something which is i want to create a budding sound so i go to the sound first and then i say start sound bite let's play and see what is happening so far so so it worked one time so it means that i need one more forever for this apparently so i drag this let's try one more time that's what i want but i don't want it that fast i also want to switch to the shape of apple that looks like an eaten apple like this one so i say switch costume as well from the looks switch switch stitch switch custom to apple hidden it should be eat an apple but we know what we say i also put a weight here control control wait a bit one third of second almost and then height so i hide it so that it looks like the apple is finished and then switch back to the full apple castle switch back to apple switch back to apple um one more ways and then join the apple so look and show let's show the apple let's show the apple a tiny bit of weight again so i just keep waiting and waiting so that it looks like different apples are coming and go to a new position just a random position go to random position less right feel free to remix it and leave your projects in the comments see you next week if you liked the video don't forget to like subscribe and hit the bell so that you won't miss the next tutorial see you next week
