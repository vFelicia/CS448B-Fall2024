00:00 - hello and welcome to another tutorial
00:03 - in this tutorial we're going to see how
00:05 - we can create
00:06 - a skin game
00:10 - this is ellie and this is your place to
00:13 - learn to go and have fun let's dive in
00:18 - first of all let's see how the game
00:22 - works so i press
00:25 - my right and left arrow key to
00:30 - move the skewer to the left and right
00:32 - and i need to avoid
00:33 - the obstacles like the tree or
00:36 - anything that i see here and
00:39 - you see on the left there is a score
00:42 - so whenever i pass the obstacle my score
00:45 - goes
00:46 - up one level and if i hit
00:49 - i'm game over like
00:54 - okay let's see how we can make it
00:58 - if you would like to follow a line go
00:59 - ahead and create a new project
01:02 - from scratch.mit.edu
01:05 - and then give a good name to your
01:08 - project
01:08 - i'm gonna name it skin game
01:12 - by the way this tutorial was requested
01:16 - and if you two have a request
01:18 - on what you would like to learn go ahead
01:20 - and put it down the comment and i try to
01:23 - create that tutorial for you so
01:27 - i gonna delete this cat as well
01:30 - i'm gonna use different sprites so
01:36 - we need a backdrop and a skier and
01:40 - some obstacles so i'm gonna create them
01:43 - first for skier
01:46 - you can go and download something from
01:49 - the internet but i'm just gonna
01:50 - keep it simple so i'm downloading this
01:53 - one
01:55 - and let's make the size
01:58 - small enough that makes sense
02:02 - i'm gonna make it 40
02:06 - and then i'm gonna modify it a bit
02:10 - so i go to costume
02:13 - let's see what we have here
02:14 - [Music]
02:17 - i think just this neutral position
02:20 - is good enough for
02:24 - skiing this one is also not bad but
02:27 - just let's give it a simple yeah i'm
02:29 - gonna keep this
02:31 - too
02:35 - so let's draw the ski shoes
02:41 - i'm taking this paint and drawing
02:44 - one ski and the second
02:48 - ski you can choose whatever color you
02:50 - want
02:51 - and then i'm filling it with this it
02:54 - obviously doesn't really look
02:56 - like ski but it's good enough for what i
02:59 - want to do because i'm just going to
03:00 - give a demo and you can
03:03 - take your time and draw as perfect as
03:05 - you would like to
03:08 - so i'm gonna group the whole thing
03:11 - together here
03:13 - and now i'm putting the shoes here and
03:17 - here
03:18 - you can always click here and rotate it
03:22 - to make it just like the dimension
03:25 - that's
03:25 - the direction that you would like to
03:29 - and also with this front and back
03:33 - you can make sure that the ski
03:36 - is at the back so it shouldn't cover
03:40 - the character
03:43 - you also need the poles i'm gonna go
03:47 - ahead
03:48 - and draw a line
03:55 - i'm gonna give it a bit of a width yeah
03:58 - so one pole and the other pole
04:02 - unless
04:05 - a little sharp part here
04:09 - something like this
04:13 - now let's group each of them
04:16 - to make it one so that it's not gonna
04:21 - um separate
04:25 - and this one in this hand and this
04:28 - one in the other hand
04:31 - let's rotate it a little bit
04:42 - it's obviously not perfect
04:47 - but for what we want is good all right
04:51 - and also let's
04:54 - click on ctrl a and group the whole
04:57 - thing all together
05:00 - now i'm to make it simpler i'm gonna
05:03 - delete this one
05:05 - now duplicating this
05:08 - so i have the skier
05:11 - a abbey right
05:15 - and i named the other one abby
05:18 - left and what i'm gonna do is
05:22 - i select the whole thing by ctrl
05:25 - a and mirror this one so that it looks
05:28 - like
05:30 - she's looking at the left
05:33 - so here we go we're done with
05:36 - the sprite now let's also create a
05:40 - backdrop
05:42 - for the backdrop i'm gonna
05:46 - choose just a simple blue sky
05:50 - and then using the line
05:53 - i'm gonna draw one they're gonna
05:57 - line here and one they're gonna line
06:00 - here
06:01 - so it resembles the ski heel
06:04 - kind of i just want to pretend it's a
06:08 - ski
06:08 - heel let's also put a bit of
06:13 - obstacles here i'm gonna choose
06:18 - three uh
06:20 - actually the obstacle should be from the
06:23 - sprite
06:25 - so i'm gonna choose tree
06:29 - i choose this one it's not actually a
06:32 - winter tree
06:34 - but it's more fantasy
06:38 - so i'm just going to choose it let's
06:41 - also
06:42 - pick one more maybe
06:47 - what shall we use what do we have on a
06:50 - ski
06:51 - resort like how about
06:54 - stone
06:58 - rock yeah we have rocks
07:03 - so i'm also gonna take some rocks
07:09 - okay now let's get into writing the code
07:16 - one more thing we need is a variable for
07:19 - score in order to be able to keep track
07:22 - of the scores i'm gonna click on
07:24 - variable and i'm gonna make a variable
07:27 - naming it gate score
07:32 - and it's for all the sprites
07:36 - okay and
07:42 - as a starting point i'm gonna
07:45 - set my variable to zero
07:49 - so when start clicked i'm gonna set it
07:52 - to zero so when we are not
07:53 - playing yet there is no score
07:58 - fair enough so make sure you change this
08:02 - to
08:03 - score and now
08:07 - let's say let's see what other things
08:11 - need to be done when we click start
08:14 - when i click start i want my character
08:18 - to be
08:18 - at the top of the page
08:22 - let's say here so
08:29 - not here so when i click on the
08:32 - character
08:32 - i would like to say when start clicked
08:38 - now that i put this character here by my
08:41 - mouse
08:43 - if i go to x into the motion
08:47 - the x and y location now matches the
08:50 - location
08:51 - of here so i only
08:54 - drag it right here
08:58 - also i want my character to be
09:01 - at the 90 degree so what do i mean by
09:05 - that
09:06 - i'm gonna tell you in a minute so i say
09:09 - point
09:09 - in direction 90.
09:14 - so so what do i mean by
09:17 - saying point in direction
09:21 - in order to understand if this is my
09:25 - character
09:26 - here is the direction if it's
09:29 - like this i'm on the zero degree
09:33 - and if i want it to be upright standing
09:36 - i should rotate 90 degrees so
09:40 - now my character is pointing to 90
09:43 - degrees
09:43 - so that's what i want my starting
09:46 - position to be
09:48 - now let's control the character
09:51 - movements to left and right
09:54 - by pressing on right and left arrow keys
09:59 - on the keyboard so i want to say
10:02 - when not
10:05 - space but when uh
10:10 - right arrow clicked
10:13 - what i want to do is first i want the
10:17 - costume
10:18 - to be this one so i would say
10:22 - i go to the looks and i would say switch
10:25 - costume to abby
10:27 - wright
10:30 - and other than that i wanted to
10:36 - the direction i want it to be like this
10:39 - so let's say point to direction
10:42 - 105
10:45 - motion point in
10:49 - direction instead of
10:52 - 90 105
10:57 - and i also want to move a little bit
11:00 - to the right so change x
11:06 - by maybe 10
11:09 - so if i play start and i press my right
11:12 - arrow
11:13 - that's what happens i want to write a
11:16 - similar thing
11:17 - for the left arrow
11:20 - so to make it easy i duplicate this
11:24 - i put it here and i change this
11:28 - to left switch costume to left
11:32 - and for the direction
11:38 - if let's
11:41 - press left so
11:44 - if this is my character when i'm
11:48 - turning right left
11:51 - i want it to point to something less
11:54 - than 90
11:55 - let's say 63
11:59 - or maybe 75
12:04 - so point in direction 75
12:07 - and also go to the left
12:11 - means change x y minus
12:14 - something like 10 or whatever
12:18 - let's play start i go right i go
12:22 - left so
12:25 - the skewer is moving but it doesn't look
12:28 - like
12:28 - it's going down so in order to make it
12:31 - look like it's going down
12:32 - instead i'm gonna move other items
12:36 - up to create the illusion
12:40 - that the skier is going down so this
12:43 - goes
12:43 - up and this goes up so that i
12:47 - feel that the skewer all is going down
12:50 - so unless
12:51 - or let's write the code for that one as
12:53 - well in order to
12:55 - move the obstacle up obstacles
12:59 - up what i need to do is
13:02 - start from any position across
13:06 - this line at the bottom and then glide
13:09 - all the way up and then
13:12 - disappear wait a few minutes
13:16 - and then go back down
13:20 - appear and repeat so
13:23 - i need a forever loop
13:27 - i'm gonna say forever
13:33 - height first
13:41 - and then i want to start from a random
13:44 - location
13:45 - across this line
13:48 - for that i'm gonna create a
13:52 - variable i'm gonna name it
13:58 - x
14:01 - tree exposition tree
14:07 - or like x
14:15 - position tree
14:18 - start so by this
14:22 - i mean the initial location that
14:26 - this tree is gonna start
14:32 - now i'm gonna set the value of
14:35 - this start position so
14:39 - set exposition to
14:42 - let's go to operator a random location
14:47 - between let's say
14:50 - here at the very end which is going to
14:54 - be
14:54 - minus let's say 200
15:00 - to 200
15:04 - and then
15:10 - i would say go
15:14 - so now i'm going to say from where i
15:15 - want to start so go to
15:20 - x which is
15:25 - this variable
15:29 - which we have set it already on the line
15:32 - before
15:34 - anywhere across here randomly generated
15:37 - and i want it to be at the very bottom
15:40 - not here or
15:41 - here at the very bottom so the y
15:44 - should be minus
15:48 - 180 all right
15:51 - now it's here i want it to glide all the
15:53 - way
15:54 - up so i would say
15:58 - glide in
16:01 - one second or whatever you want
16:04 - depending on how slow or fast you want
16:06 - skier to ski go to
16:11 - same x position which was
16:18 - this one exposition 3 start but i
16:21 - this time i want it to be all the way up
16:24 - because i want it to glide all the way
16:27 - up
16:28 - so 180
16:31 - one thing is i need to make sure i'm
16:35 - showing it so
16:40 - i can show it here
16:45 - i can also change the costume so that
16:48 - every time that the tree is coming it
16:51 - looks differently and
16:56 - i'm going all the way up what else let's
16:59 - run it and see
17:00 - so far what we have
17:03 - oh i didn't put the start clicked on the
17:06 - top
17:07 - okay now let's see so yeah the three is
17:11 - going up and every time it's going it
17:14 - looks
17:15 - differently and
17:19 - so far so good i'm
17:23 - gonna let's also put a bit of
17:26 - weight after so that it looks more
17:29 - natural
17:30 - like right now is a bit
17:33 - super fast
17:37 - so let's also wait one second here
17:42 - all right now let's do
17:46 - a trick let's copy the whole thing
17:50 - here for the rock as well so that the
17:54 - rock
17:54 - is also gonna move
17:58 - let's see if it came which
18:01 - is correct now let's see how it works
18:08 - actually it didn't copy here
18:11 - let's try again so i'm dragging it
18:15 - and i'm putting it on the rack
18:18 - all right now it's here so start
18:23 - uh i don't want to see this i only need
18:26 - to see the score
18:28 - so let's uncheck this one we only have
18:31 - the score
18:32 - also it doesn't look nice that both of
18:35 - the tree
18:35 - and rock are moving at the same time so
18:39 - in order to fix that let's go to the
18:41 - rock
18:43 - and
18:48 - let's put a weight here with a random
18:51 - wedding amount
18:54 - here also let's make this one random as
18:59 - well
19:01 - so we can create a more natural
19:04 - appearance of those items
19:10 - random between one two three
19:13 - and also one two three
19:17 - let's see now
19:20 - okay now let's play the game so
19:24 - i start i go
19:27 - i try to avoid the obstacles and any
19:30 - time
19:33 - okay we didn't tried the code for the
19:35 - score yet
19:37 - but now i can move right and left
19:41 - now let's create the scores program the
19:45 - scores as well so what i want
19:47 - is any time that i'm avoiding the
19:50 - obstacle the character is
19:52 - avoiding the obstacle i want the point
19:53 - to be up one and whenever
19:56 - that is touching any of those
20:00 - items those obstacles i want the game
20:03 - to be game the player to be game over
20:08 - for the scores all i need to do is
20:12 - changing the score by one
20:15 - so from the variables i'm gonna just
20:17 - change
20:19 - score by one whenever
20:23 - i'm at the end of this movement so
20:25 - whenever the tree
20:26 - or the rock gets to the top of the
20:31 - scene the stage i'm gonna increase the
20:33 - score
20:34 - it means that it didn't hit the skier
20:38 - i'm gonna do that just do the same thing
20:41 - here
20:44 - what is this i have two okay
20:49 - so i'm gonna say change
20:57 - score by one here as well at the very
21:01 - end
21:04 - or just after it reached the top
21:08 - uh also let's program the game over
21:12 - which is when touching so for touching
21:15 - we can use
21:16 - the sensing and i'm writing the code for
21:20 - it
21:21 - i'm gonna do control we can do
21:26 - when start clicked
21:34 - rocks
21:41 - after that
21:47 - switch costume to collapsed
21:54 - so i want to show that it's collapsed so
21:56 - let's first create a costume for it
21:59 - i'm gonna duplicate it and create a
22:02 - costume
22:04 - collapsed for that
22:08 - let's make it look like
22:11 - the abbey fella fell down
22:15 - so everything scatters around the ski
22:19 - somewhere
22:22 - and this one here and she's gonna
22:25 - just collapse
22:29 - oh poor abby
22:33 - okay now this is a collapse so
22:37 - uh when touching those things i want to
22:41 - change the costume to the one that i
22:44 - created just
22:45 - now switch custom to
22:52 - collapsed and then
22:54 - here stop everything stop
22:57 - all the script which is
23:01 - under control stop all
23:06 - which you see
23:10 - now it's not gonna move back to the
23:14 - original position
23:15 - so let's again go to the costume
23:20 - and start as switch custom to here so
23:24 - when we start is
23:28 - standing and then when we are game over
23:31 - is collapsing so just let's deliberately
23:34 - get
23:35 - get game over yeah let's also play
23:38 - a sound for it to actually make it look
23:42 - like a game
23:44 - i'm gonna going to the sound
23:47 - and let's add something
23:50 - relevant for our game over i chose
23:54 - this one splash
23:57 - but i'm gonna make it a bit softer to
24:00 - make it look like someone is falling on
24:02 - the snow
24:04 - so i would say under sound
24:09 - play sound splash until done
24:14 - so let's play the game i'm going right
24:17 - left and i try to avoid the
24:21 - obstacles and now i lost the game and i
24:24 - got the game over
24:26 - it was such a cool game i really enjoyed
24:29 - playing it and developing it i
24:32 - really hope you too also enjoyed if you
24:35 - did don't forget to press
24:37 - like subscribe and hit the bell so that
24:39 - you can
24:40 - get notification when i upload a new
24:42 - video
24:43 - and this was a requested video by
24:47 - one of you and if you two have some
24:51 - requests go ahead and put it on the
24:53 - comment and i
24:54 - try to make it as soon as i can
24:57 - thank you so much and see you soon
25:02 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome to another tutorial in this tutorial we're going to see how we can create a skin game this is ellie and this is your place to learn to go and have fun let's dive in first of all let's see how the game works so i press my right and left arrow key to move the skewer to the left and right and i need to avoid the obstacles like the tree or anything that i see here and you see on the left there is a score so whenever i pass the obstacle my score goes up one level and if i hit i'm game over like okay let's see how we can make it if you would like to follow a line go ahead and create a new project from scratch.mit.edu and then give a good name to your project i'm gonna name it skin game by the way this tutorial was requested and if you two have a request on what you would like to learn go ahead and put it down the comment and i try to create that tutorial for you so i gonna delete this cat as well i'm gonna use different sprites so we need a backdrop and a skier and some obstacles so i'm gonna create them first for skier you can go and download something from the internet but i'm just gonna keep it simple so i'm downloading this one and let's make the size small enough that makes sense i'm gonna make it 40 and then i'm gonna modify it a bit so i go to costume let's see what we have here i think just this neutral position is good enough for skiing this one is also not bad but just let's give it a simple yeah i'm gonna keep this too so let's draw the ski shoes i'm taking this paint and drawing one ski and the second ski you can choose whatever color you want and then i'm filling it with this it obviously doesn't really look like ski but it's good enough for what i want to do because i'm just going to give a demo and you can take your time and draw as perfect as you would like to so i'm gonna group the whole thing together here and now i'm putting the shoes here and here you can always click here and rotate it to make it just like the dimension that's the direction that you would like to and also with this front and back you can make sure that the ski is at the back so it shouldn't cover the character you also need the poles i'm gonna go ahead and draw a line i'm gonna give it a bit of a width yeah so one pole and the other pole unless a little sharp part here something like this now let's group each of them to make it one so that it's not gonna um separate and this one in this hand and this one in the other hand let's rotate it a little bit it's obviously not perfect but for what we want is good all right and also let's click on ctrl a and group the whole thing all together now i'm to make it simpler i'm gonna delete this one now duplicating this so i have the skier a abbey right and i named the other one abby left and what i'm gonna do is i select the whole thing by ctrl a and mirror this one so that it looks like she's looking at the left so here we go we're done with the sprite now let's also create a backdrop for the backdrop i'm gonna choose just a simple blue sky and then using the line i'm gonna draw one they're gonna line here and one they're gonna line here so it resembles the ski heel kind of i just want to pretend it's a ski heel let's also put a bit of obstacles here i'm gonna choose three uh actually the obstacle should be from the sprite so i'm gonna choose tree i choose this one it's not actually a winter tree but it's more fantasy so i'm just going to choose it let's also pick one more maybe what shall we use what do we have on a ski resort like how about stone rock yeah we have rocks so i'm also gonna take some rocks okay now let's get into writing the code one more thing we need is a variable for score in order to be able to keep track of the scores i'm gonna click on variable and i'm gonna make a variable naming it gate score and it's for all the sprites okay and as a starting point i'm gonna set my variable to zero so when start clicked i'm gonna set it to zero so when we are not playing yet there is no score fair enough so make sure you change this to score and now let's say let's see what other things need to be done when we click start when i click start i want my character to be at the top of the page let's say here so not here so when i click on the character i would like to say when start clicked now that i put this character here by my mouse if i go to x into the motion the x and y location now matches the location of here so i only drag it right here also i want my character to be at the 90 degree so what do i mean by that i'm gonna tell you in a minute so i say point in direction 90. so so what do i mean by saying point in direction in order to understand if this is my character here is the direction if it's like this i'm on the zero degree and if i want it to be upright standing i should rotate 90 degrees so now my character is pointing to 90 degrees so that's what i want my starting position to be now let's control the character movements to left and right by pressing on right and left arrow keys on the keyboard so i want to say when not space but when uh right arrow clicked what i want to do is first i want the costume to be this one so i would say i go to the looks and i would say switch costume to abby wright and other than that i wanted to the direction i want it to be like this so let's say point to direction 105 motion point in direction instead of 90 105 and i also want to move a little bit to the right so change x by maybe 10 so if i play start and i press my right arrow that's what happens i want to write a similar thing for the left arrow so to make it easy i duplicate this i put it here and i change this to left switch costume to left and for the direction if let's press left so if this is my character when i'm turning right left i want it to point to something less than 90 let's say 63 or maybe 75 so point in direction 75 and also go to the left means change x y minus something like 10 or whatever let's play start i go right i go left so the skewer is moving but it doesn't look like it's going down so in order to make it look like it's going down instead i'm gonna move other items up to create the illusion that the skier is going down so this goes up and this goes up so that i feel that the skewer all is going down so unless or let's write the code for that one as well in order to move the obstacle up obstacles up what i need to do is start from any position across this line at the bottom and then glide all the way up and then disappear wait a few minutes and then go back down appear and repeat so i need a forever loop i'm gonna say forever height first and then i want to start from a random location across this line for that i'm gonna create a variable i'm gonna name it x tree exposition tree or like x position tree start so by this i mean the initial location that this tree is gonna start now i'm gonna set the value of this start position so set exposition to let's go to operator a random location between let's say here at the very end which is going to be minus let's say 200 to 200 and then i would say go so now i'm going to say from where i want to start so go to x which is this variable which we have set it already on the line before anywhere across here randomly generated and i want it to be at the very bottom not here or here at the very bottom so the y should be minus 180 all right now it's here i want it to glide all the way up so i would say glide in one second or whatever you want depending on how slow or fast you want skier to ski go to same x position which was this one exposition 3 start but i this time i want it to be all the way up because i want it to glide all the way up so 180 one thing is i need to make sure i'm showing it so i can show it here i can also change the costume so that every time that the tree is coming it looks differently and i'm going all the way up what else let's run it and see so far what we have oh i didn't put the start clicked on the top okay now let's see so yeah the three is going up and every time it's going it looks differently and so far so good i'm gonna let's also put a bit of weight after so that it looks more natural like right now is a bit super fast so let's also wait one second here all right now let's do a trick let's copy the whole thing here for the rock as well so that the rock is also gonna move let's see if it came which is correct now let's see how it works actually it didn't copy here let's try again so i'm dragging it and i'm putting it on the rack all right now it's here so start uh i don't want to see this i only need to see the score so let's uncheck this one we only have the score also it doesn't look nice that both of the tree and rock are moving at the same time so in order to fix that let's go to the rock and let's put a weight here with a random wedding amount here also let's make this one random as well so we can create a more natural appearance of those items random between one two three and also one two three let's see now okay now let's play the game so i start i go i try to avoid the obstacles and any time okay we didn't tried the code for the score yet but now i can move right and left now let's create the scores program the scores as well so what i want is any time that i'm avoiding the obstacle the character is avoiding the obstacle i want the point to be up one and whenever that is touching any of those items those obstacles i want the game to be game the player to be game over for the scores all i need to do is changing the score by one so from the variables i'm gonna just change score by one whenever i'm at the end of this movement so whenever the tree or the rock gets to the top of the scene the stage i'm gonna increase the score it means that it didn't hit the skier i'm gonna do that just do the same thing here what is this i have two okay so i'm gonna say change score by one here as well at the very end or just after it reached the top uh also let's program the game over which is when touching so for touching we can use the sensing and i'm writing the code for it i'm gonna do control we can do when start clicked rocks after that switch costume to collapsed so i want to show that it's collapsed so let's first create a costume for it i'm gonna duplicate it and create a costume collapsed for that let's make it look like the abbey fella fell down so everything scatters around the ski somewhere and this one here and she's gonna just collapse oh poor abby okay now this is a collapse so uh when touching those things i want to change the costume to the one that i created just now switch custom to collapsed and then here stop everything stop all the script which is under control stop all which you see now it's not gonna move back to the original position so let's again go to the costume and start as switch custom to here so when we start is standing and then when we are game over is collapsing so just let's deliberately get get game over yeah let's also play a sound for it to actually make it look like a game i'm gonna going to the sound and let's add something relevant for our game over i chose this one splash but i'm gonna make it a bit softer to make it look like someone is falling on the snow so i would say under sound play sound splash until done so let's play the game i'm going right left and i try to avoid the obstacles and now i lost the game and i got the game over it was such a cool game i really enjoyed playing it and developing it i really hope you too also enjoyed if you did don't forget to press like subscribe and hit the bell so that you can get notification when i upload a new video and this was a requested video by one of you and if you two have some requests go ahead and put it on the comment and i try to make it as soon as i can thank you so much and see you soon bye
