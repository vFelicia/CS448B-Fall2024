00:01 - hello friends how
00:03 - are you doing i hope you are all doing
00:05 - wonderful welcome back to another
00:07 - tutorial in this tutorial we are going
00:09 - to create a
00:11 - colorful piano
00:14 - welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this
00:17 - is
00:18 - eddie and this is your place to learn to
00:20 - code and have fun
00:22 - so let's start by giving our project
00:26 - a good name so just let's give it
00:31 - colorful piano
00:34 - and then let's invite this
00:38 - cat to join us in another project by
00:41 - deleting it now
00:45 - it's time to choose our sprites
00:48 - so i'm gonna choose
00:52 - something for instead of the buttons
00:56 - on the piano i'm going to choose this
00:59 - ball because it has
01:03 - a lot of costumes but
01:06 - feel free to choose anything colorful
01:09 - like this
01:09 - button this button you can definitely
01:13 - play with
01:13 - colors so i'm gonna show you on the ball
01:18 - and then you can do whatever you prefer
01:22 - what i'm gonna do is you see this
01:26 - ball has a lot of costumes
01:30 - so first thing
01:34 - um let's get back to
01:37 - the piano so in order to have piano i
01:40 - need to
01:43 - insert or like
01:46 - import the set of codes
01:50 - which are relevant to the music so i'm
01:52 - going to add an
01:53 - extension from here music
01:56 - extension so now you see i have this
02:00 - one here so what i need is
02:05 - something to play notes with so
02:08 - if you look at this one the nice thing
02:12 - about it
02:12 - is if i put my mouse here i see the
02:16 - shape of piano and all the buttons here
02:20 - so we have eight white
02:23 - buttons and there are five
02:27 - black as well i'm not going to
02:30 - make the black ones to make my video a
02:34 - bit shorter
02:35 - but it's the same
02:39 - so i'm going to create eight balls
02:43 - so i'm duplicating and duplicating until
02:46 - i get
02:47 - eight of them so three four
02:50 - five six seven
02:54 - eight so
02:58 - five six seven three four five six seven
03:01 - eight okay cool
03:04 - now what i'm gonna do is
03:09 - i'm gonna lay them
03:13 - in a line so i'm gonna assume
03:17 - these are the buttons of my piano
03:23 - something like this
03:27 - okay and now
03:31 - each of these buttons
03:35 - correspond to one of these so like
03:39 - the first one is gonna be c72
03:43 - so i'm gonna give them the relevant name
03:45 - so that is
03:46 - easier and i won't be confused when i'm
03:49 - writing my code
03:53 - so i'm renaming the first
03:56 - one to c72 which is the same as what i
04:01 - see here
04:03 - so c 72
04:07 - and then i click here c74
04:12 - and so on for the rest
04:18 - [Music]
04:20 - so
04:23 - see actually
04:26 - i need to make it d74
04:33 - so obviously i'm not a musician e 76
04:45 - f77
04:51 - [Music]
04:54 - g79
05:02 - three more a81
05:05 - you may want to follow along so that
05:10 - you finished together with me
05:12 - [Music]
05:15 - b83
05:22 - c84 okay
05:27 - what i want to do is i want them to have
05:30 - different colors so i'm going to
05:34 - costumes
05:37 - and then i
05:40 - changed this
05:44 - to this and then this one for here
05:54 - so what i'm gonna do is put the color
05:56 - that i wanted the first one and then i'm
05:59 - gonna delete
06:00 - the rest of the costumes and create the
06:03 - custom of
06:04 - my choice instead of
06:08 - this so in a minute you're gonna see
06:11 - what i'm talking about so one two three
06:14 - four
06:15 - so i'm short of three colors
06:18 - what i'm gonna do is
06:24 - for this one
06:27 - i'm creating my own color
06:32 - which
06:34 - is what to choose maybe
06:38 - red
06:43 - yeah so this one is good
06:48 - i need two more colors
06:52 - this one maybe dark blue
06:55 - or something like this
06:59 - and this one i need
07:02 - one more for here
07:05 - which can be um
07:09 - what color do we like
07:13 - maybe this one
07:18 - or something dark hair maybe
07:29 - now i have eight
07:32 - different colors here
07:36 - what i have to do is i need to make sure
07:39 - the order is the same as what is on the
07:44 - piano so
07:45 - c72 is here so just make sure to double
07:49 - check
07:52 - d74
07:54 - should come here so put them in order
08:02 - the pink one is here
08:07 - this is good and then
08:10 - g and then the red one so i'm looking at
08:12 - here
08:13 - the order so to make it uh
08:16 - look like as it appear on the
08:19 - actual piano because each of them is
08:23 - reflecting a note on piano
08:29 - so now
08:33 - one more thing is
08:37 - i want to have costumes now so i'm gonna
08:40 - delete extra costumes
08:42 - that i do not want and for each of them
08:45 - i'm only keeping the first one
08:52 - here the same same same
08:57 - same same thing so i'm just gonna
09:00 - repeat this i'm deleting every extra
09:03 - costume and i'm only keeping
09:06 - one first one
09:11 - so delete delete delete and delete
09:15 - this this is this actually
09:18 - this color is too similar to my blue one
09:22 - so i'm going to change
09:23 - this so i'm going to change
09:26 - the blue to a bit more yellowish
09:30 - or
09:33 - i think why we don't have enough colors
09:38 - okay now it's good it's much more
09:40 - different
09:46 - so going back to costumes
09:53 - i'm gonna rename this
09:59 - to custom one
10:02 - and i copy this i'm gonna do the same
10:05 - for
10:06 - all of them it helps me to be able to
10:09 - copy
10:09 - and paste the code to all of them
10:13 - when i write the code for one i copy and
10:16 - paste it
10:16 - since the names are the same
10:20 - so same here
10:24 - same here
10:28 - this and this
10:31 - okay so
10:35 - one more thing is for each of them i'm
10:38 - gonna duplicate the costume
10:41 - so i'm doing it for all of them again
10:44 - duplicate
10:46 - and duplicate
10:49 - and duplicate so every
10:52 - button on the piano i want it to have
10:55 - two customs the reason is when i'm
10:58 - pressing the button i want it to look
11:01 - differently so i want it to look like as
11:04 - it's
11:05 - pressed how do i show expressed
11:09 - by simply pressing it
11:13 - so just like this and i'm gonna do it
11:15 - for all the custom tools
11:18 - so here
11:21 - and here
11:25 - and here
11:31 - two more
11:38 - okay now are our surprise
11:42 - are ready and it's time to get the fun
11:46 - started we're gonna write the code
11:49 - uh so first thing in my code is
11:53 - i wanna start from the position
11:59 - of custom one
12:02 - so no button is pressed when
12:05 - the game is just being started so when
12:09 - start clicked and from the looks
12:11 - i'm gonna switch custom to
12:14 - custom one this code
12:18 - should be copied
12:22 - to all of them where did i write it here
12:26 - so for copying i put my mouse here
12:32 - and then i drag it to here
12:37 - i should do it for all the sprites
12:42 - so to here
12:46 - and this and this
12:49 - and this and this
12:53 - and this
12:57 - which one is missing
13:04 - this one so
13:08 - also this one doesn't have the second
13:12 - one i'm gonna copy
13:14 - to this as well so let's double check
13:17 - and make sure
13:18 - everyone has that piece of code when a
13:21 - start clicked
13:22 - switch to cost someone so by this
13:26 - i'm making sure when i'm starting
13:29 - everyone starting from the
13:33 - round shape this one doesn't do it
13:37 - what could be the reason
13:40 - switch custom to custom one
13:45 - customs custom one
13:49 - the reason is i need to swap this
13:52 - too i rename it to one
13:58 - so i first give it three
14:02 - and then this one two
14:05 - and this one one so now
14:09 - the full shape is custom one and custom
14:12 - two
14:13 - so okay now they're all good
14:17 - now how to play the piano
14:20 - it's very easy all i need to do
14:24 - is for each sprite let's say
14:28 - c72
14:31 - all i have to say is
14:38 - there is a code on the events when
14:42 - this sprite clicked so i drag it here
14:47 - and then from my music i'm taking play
14:50 - note
14:50 - which i've already done so
14:57 - the name of the naming of the sprites is
14:59 - going to help me
15:00 - right now here so you see this one is
15:02 - c72
15:04 - so i say by playing this sprite
15:07 - play the note 72 so
15:12 - this one is equivalent of this button on
15:14 - the piano
15:17 - and then
15:21 - i should do pretty much the same thing
15:23 - for all of them
15:26 - except there are two more steps
15:30 - what i want is when this one is pressed
15:34 - i want it to be squished so from the
15:37 - looks
15:39 - switch costume to custom 2
15:45 - so it's squished but i also want it to
15:48 - come back
15:50 - so what i do is first squish
15:54 - then play so that i have like a few
15:59 - uh moments of
16:02 - delay in between so now i'm gonna go
16:05 - back
16:06 - to custom one let's see how it looks
16:10 - i start i play it goes down
16:14 - and then it goes up so
16:18 - simply the same thing can be done for
16:21 - every other button so all i have to do
16:26 - oh we have a problem here
16:29 - one start click switch to custom one
16:34 - okay now
16:39 - i'm pretty much done all i need to do is
16:41 - to drag
16:42 - this to every other sprite so that
16:45 - all of my buttons are working
16:50 - so this
16:55 - and this
16:58 - and this and this and this
17:04 - okay now i have a
17:08 - working piano not yet
17:14 - let's check all of them have the code
17:16 - first
17:20 - so this one has something extra
17:24 - so i just click over everyone and check
17:27 - everything is okay this one is an extra
17:34 - this one doesn't have the coat at all so
17:39 - i'm gonna copy for it this pink one as
17:44 - well
17:48 - so i'm gonna do it here this one worked
17:54 - [Music]
17:57 - this is copied multiple times
18:00 - so this is correct
18:05 - here is not copied at all so
18:10 - which one was it
18:15 - here so let's drag on top of this as
18:19 - well
18:23 - this is good
18:26 - and this is good and this
18:29 - has some extra stuff so
18:33 - all cleanups and nice and
18:38 - okay
18:41 - now now let's fix this number so when
18:44 - i'm pressing this one
18:46 - i'm playing the note 72 when i'm
18:49 - pressing this one
18:50 - since this right num name is 74
18:55 - i'm also
18:58 - playing the note 74 i can also
19:02 - verify it by checking this numbers
19:07 - so the same here i'm
19:11 - it's very simple i'm just checking the
19:14 - buttons on the piano
19:17 - comparing with this number the location
19:20 - so this is the third one so it's 76 76
19:25 - so all good and in order
19:32 - here the green one is the fourth one so
19:35 - one two three four seven seven
19:47 - one two three four five fifth one
19:52 - 79
19:58 - and after 79 81
20:02 - two more to go
20:08 - so in a minute we are gonna have our
20:11 - very
20:11 - own colorful piano
20:15 - and the last one 84
20:18 - tada
20:25 - [Music]
20:30 - one more thing that we can do
20:34 - i'm gonna show you on one of them
20:38 - is that instead of kicking with the
20:41 - mouse
20:42 - you could also
20:45 - make them to react to the button on our
20:48 - keyboard
20:48 - so i could instead
20:52 - so what i can do is i duplicate this
20:54 - piece of code
20:57 - i'm putting it here and then instead of
21:00 - when this sprite clicked
21:04 - i would say when
21:09 - for instance button a clicked
21:13 - so for the first one if i click button a
21:16 - on my keyboard so if you listen i'm
21:20 - pressing button a on my keyboard
21:23 - i also can play music so you can do that
21:27 - with
21:27 - all the for all the colorful piano
21:31 - buttons and associated with a key
21:33 - on your keyboard as well this
21:36 - was a nice easy beginner tutorial and i
21:40 - had so much fun
21:41 - i hope you too had fun and learned
21:44 - something
21:46 - if you did press
21:49 - like subscribe and hit the bell so that
21:52 - you won't miss
21:53 - the next tutorial and see you next week

Cleaned transcript:

hello friends how are you doing i hope you are all doing wonderful welcome back to another tutorial in this tutorial we are going to create a colorful piano welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun so let's start by giving our project a good name so just let's give it colorful piano and then let's invite this cat to join us in another project by deleting it now it's time to choose our sprites so i'm gonna choose something for instead of the buttons on the piano i'm going to choose this ball because it has a lot of costumes but feel free to choose anything colorful like this button this button you can definitely play with colors so i'm gonna show you on the ball and then you can do whatever you prefer what i'm gonna do is you see this ball has a lot of costumes so first thing um let's get back to the piano so in order to have piano i need to insert or like import the set of codes which are relevant to the music so i'm going to add an extension from here music extension so now you see i have this one here so what i need is something to play notes with so if you look at this one the nice thing about it is if i put my mouse here i see the shape of piano and all the buttons here so we have eight white buttons and there are five black as well i'm not going to make the black ones to make my video a bit shorter but it's the same so i'm going to create eight balls so i'm duplicating and duplicating until i get eight of them so three four five six seven eight so five six seven three four five six seven eight okay cool now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna lay them in a line so i'm gonna assume these are the buttons of my piano something like this okay and now each of these buttons correspond to one of these so like the first one is gonna be c72 so i'm gonna give them the relevant name so that is easier and i won't be confused when i'm writing my code so i'm renaming the first one to c72 which is the same as what i see here so c 72 and then i click here c74 and so on for the rest so see actually i need to make it d74 so obviously i'm not a musician e 76 f77 g79 three more a81 you may want to follow along so that you finished together with me b83 c84 okay what i want to do is i want them to have different colors so i'm going to costumes and then i changed this to this and then this one for here so what i'm gonna do is put the color that i wanted the first one and then i'm gonna delete the rest of the costumes and create the custom of my choice instead of this so in a minute you're gonna see what i'm talking about so one two three four so i'm short of three colors what i'm gonna do is for this one i'm creating my own color which is what to choose maybe red yeah so this one is good i need two more colors this one maybe dark blue or something like this and this one i need one more for here which can be um what color do we like maybe this one or something dark hair maybe now i have eight different colors here what i have to do is i need to make sure the order is the same as what is on the piano so c72 is here so just make sure to double check d74 should come here so put them in order the pink one is here this is good and then g and then the red one so i'm looking at here the order so to make it uh look like as it appear on the actual piano because each of them is reflecting a note on piano so now one more thing is i want to have costumes now so i'm gonna delete extra costumes that i do not want and for each of them i'm only keeping the first one here the same same same same same thing so i'm just gonna repeat this i'm deleting every extra costume and i'm only keeping one first one so delete delete delete and delete this this is this actually this color is too similar to my blue one so i'm going to change this so i'm going to change the blue to a bit more yellowish or i think why we don't have enough colors okay now it's good it's much more different so going back to costumes i'm gonna rename this to custom one and i copy this i'm gonna do the same for all of them it helps me to be able to copy and paste the code to all of them when i write the code for one i copy and paste it since the names are the same so same here same here this and this okay so one more thing is for each of them i'm gonna duplicate the costume so i'm doing it for all of them again duplicate and duplicate and duplicate so every button on the piano i want it to have two customs the reason is when i'm pressing the button i want it to look differently so i want it to look like as it's pressed how do i show expressed by simply pressing it so just like this and i'm gonna do it for all the custom tools so here and here and here two more okay now are our surprise are ready and it's time to get the fun started we're gonna write the code uh so first thing in my code is i wanna start from the position of custom one so no button is pressed when the game is just being started so when start clicked and from the looks i'm gonna switch custom to custom one this code should be copied to all of them where did i write it here so for copying i put my mouse here and then i drag it to here i should do it for all the sprites so to here and this and this and this and this and this which one is missing this one so also this one doesn't have the second one i'm gonna copy to this as well so let's double check and make sure everyone has that piece of code when a start clicked switch to cost someone so by this i'm making sure when i'm starting everyone starting from the round shape this one doesn't do it what could be the reason switch custom to custom one customs custom one the reason is i need to swap this too i rename it to one so i first give it three and then this one two and this one one so now the full shape is custom one and custom two so okay now they're all good now how to play the piano it's very easy all i need to do is for each sprite let's say c72 all i have to say is there is a code on the events when this sprite clicked so i drag it here and then from my music i'm taking play note which i've already done so the name of the naming of the sprites is going to help me right now here so you see this one is c72 so i say by playing this sprite play the note 72 so this one is equivalent of this button on the piano and then i should do pretty much the same thing for all of them except there are two more steps what i want is when this one is pressed i want it to be squished so from the looks switch costume to custom 2 so it's squished but i also want it to come back so what i do is first squish then play so that i have like a few uh moments of delay in between so now i'm gonna go back to custom one let's see how it looks i start i play it goes down and then it goes up so simply the same thing can be done for every other button so all i have to do oh we have a problem here one start click switch to custom one okay now i'm pretty much done all i need to do is to drag this to every other sprite so that all of my buttons are working so this and this and this and this and this okay now i have a working piano not yet let's check all of them have the code first so this one has something extra so i just click over everyone and check everything is okay this one is an extra this one doesn't have the coat at all so i'm gonna copy for it this pink one as well so i'm gonna do it here this one worked this is copied multiple times so this is correct here is not copied at all so which one was it here so let's drag on top of this as well this is good and this is good and this has some extra stuff so all cleanups and nice and okay now now let's fix this number so when i'm pressing this one i'm playing the note 72 when i'm pressing this one

music so you can do that with all the for all the colorful piano buttons and associated with a key on your keyboard as well this was a nice easy beginner tutorial and i had so much fun i hope you too had fun and learned something if you did press like subscribe and hit the bell so that you won't miss the next tutorial and see you next week
