00:00 - hello you lovely scratchers how are you
00:02 - doing i hope you are all feeling
00:05 - awesome
00:06 - welcome back to another kitty code ninja
00:09 - tutorial this is eddie and this is your
00:12 - place to learn to code and have fun
00:15 - in this tutorial we're going to learn to
00:17 - interact with virtual elements
00:20 - means the things on the screen such as
00:23 - sprites
00:24 - with our voice so instead of using mouse
00:28 - keyboard or anything else we are going
00:30 - to control the surprise using our voice
00:34 - the project that we are going to design
00:36 - is a pinwheel
00:40 - that can spin whenever i blow on it
00:43 - like this
00:47 - such a crabby pinwheel i have anyway
00:51 - stick around we're gonna see how to make
00:54 - it
00:56 - you're also going to learn to create on
00:58 - and off
01:00 - switch buttons
01:01 - in scratch
01:03 - without further ado let's cut to the
01:06 - chase
01:07 - so let's create a new project give it a
01:10 - relevant name i'm
01:12 - i'm gonna name it voice
01:15 - controlled
01:17 - pinwheel
01:19 - get rid of the tag and the cat and i
01:22 - need a pinwheel since the sprite is not
01:25 - already in scratch i'm gonna upload it
01:28 - from what i've downloaded
01:32 - from google image and i'm gonna put the
01:36 - link to the project in the description
01:38 - so that you can go and take the assets
01:41 - from there or you can download it by
01:44 - yourself
01:48 - so i have this beautiful pinwheel
01:50 - this was the part at the top and now i'm
01:53 - gonna add the pin as a
01:56 - handle
02:01 - now
02:03 - there is a line here
02:05 - let's take
02:06 - it and rotate it
02:13 - so that is all the way straight
02:17 - small
02:19 - and here we go let's adjust this a
02:23 - little bit to make sure that the
02:26 - pinwheel is at the top
02:29 - and the right position
02:32 - and also we need two buttons
02:35 - which is already here
02:36 - so just i'm searching for
02:40 - pattern
02:41 - and here i have it let's take
02:44 - maybe this one
02:46 - and i need two of it
02:55 - later we will see what i want to do with
02:57 - it
03:01 - okay
03:02 - now let's get to the code
03:05 - i'm also going to create two variables
03:08 - one the color effect and the other spin
03:12 - so these are going to be binary
03:14 - variables
03:17 - to use it for this with this buttons to
03:20 - switch on and off
03:22 - uh color effect and the spin
03:26 - so
03:27 - now i'm creating it later on you will
03:29 - see how i'm gonna use it spin
03:33 - the other one
03:36 - color
03:38 - effect
03:40 - oops
03:41 - color perfect
03:43 - okay
03:47 - in this
03:48 - lesson we are going to make use of
03:50 - functions and we will see how much
03:53 - easier our code will be
03:56 - read
03:58 - so to create a function i'm using
04:01 - blocks
04:02 - i'm gonna create a function for
04:05 - a spin
04:07 - i'm gonna name it
04:11 - like
04:12 - please spin
04:15 - or just spin
04:18 - easy and simple
04:23 - so here i should define
04:26 - what the spin function do
04:29 - so it's doing something and i'm going to
04:32 - define it
04:34 - the mistake i made is i define it on the
04:37 - line
04:40 - let's just
04:43 - make sure that this here as well okay
04:46 - now it's better i dragged it there
04:49 - and i'm gonna delete it from here
04:54 - now
04:55 - let's
04:56 - write the basic code of the spinning
04:59 - like the structure
05:02 - i run it like this
05:04 - when
05:05 - green flag clicked
05:09 - forever
05:10 - so going to control
05:15 - spin
05:17 - but in a certain condition
05:21 - let's take it
05:25 - another if then
05:29 - so i wanted to say
05:34 - by blowing here
05:36 - and based on the loudness of my voice
05:40 - i want the pinwheel to spin
05:43 - so in order to
05:45 - measure the loudness i'm going to
05:47 - sensing and there is something called
05:50 - loudness already in
05:53 - scratch for us
05:55 - but before i can use it in a comparison
05:58 - i should go to operator
06:00 - and take something like this
06:05 - so now i say
06:08 - if loudness
06:10 - is less than some number
06:14 - then
06:15 - going back to my blocks the function
06:17 - that i've already defined which was spin
06:21 - and put it here if loudness is less than
06:24 - let's choose a small number so that they
06:26 - don't have to shout
06:30 - then if loudness was less than two then
06:35 - spin
06:35 - but we didn't say what spin looks like
06:38 - we already only gave it a name defined
06:41 - it but it's an empty function
06:43 - now let's define it first and
06:47 - give it a test and see how it works
06:51 - what the job of the spin function is is
06:54 - to simply
06:57 - turn
06:59 - whatever sprite that it
07:02 - that is called on
07:04 - so
07:05 - in order to say turn
07:08 - forever
07:09 - i should take the forever and then go
07:11 - into motion
07:13 - and use something like this turn some
07:17 - amount of degrees so
07:18 - i play start
07:22 - and base on the loudness of my sound is
07:26 - turning let's change this to different
07:28 - number now
07:31 - stop
07:33 - save
07:35 - and start
07:38 - now i'm quiet
07:44 - oh
07:45 - why did i say less than i should say
07:47 - more that
07:49 - let's change this part first
07:53 - so let's take another operator
08:02 - and get rid of the right one
08:06 - so i want to say if loudness is more
08:08 - than something then start spinning start
08:13 - nothing yet
08:23 - the problem here is it did work but it
08:26 - is spinning really forever
08:29 - that's not what we want because now if
08:32 - i'm quiet i don't want it to spin
08:34 - because i wanted to make like like a
08:36 - real pinwheel
08:38 - so let's improve it a little bit here
08:44 - instead of turn 15 degrees
08:47 - now i can say
08:49 - turn
08:54 - loudness
08:56 - turn whatever the loudness number is so
09:02 - what happens is the louder
09:05 - i blow or talk or play music or whatever
09:09 - that i want to control my pinwheel with
09:11 - it
09:13 - the longer
09:15 - it spins
09:22 - i'm going to turn it down
09:26 - and i can also use some operator
09:30 - to make it a portion of the loudness
09:33 - or the loudness complete itself
09:36 - let's do it like this
09:48 - for and then
09:53 - you see it's so natural
10:00 - it spins and then stuff but right now
10:02 - since it's working with my voice now
10:04 - that i'm talking it's also rotating
10:07 - which it's not a problem that's how it
10:09 - works it can't distinguish between
10:12 - blowing or talking
10:14 - but it's really nice when you are
10:15 - playing a music with it is kind of like
10:19 - it's dancing with that music
10:26 - now you see how cool and easy is to read
10:29 - this function these two blocks of code
10:33 - it's a very tiny block
10:36 - it's very clear that here i only have a
10:38 - spin
10:40 - and if i don't want to know
10:42 - what is spin
10:44 - i don't have to be worried about it
10:46 - because it's already defined or
10:50 - i can just go in it and read it so
10:53 - basically what i'm trying to say is
10:55 - since the function is defined this part
10:58 - becomes something reusable and then
11:00 - someone that is taking the assets from
11:02 - my project can simply
11:05 - grab this code and continue on it and
11:08 - it's very easy to understand
11:12 - okay here is this one
11:16 - let's define one more function
11:25 - for the
11:26 - color changing or playing with the
11:29 - colors or giving it some sort of visual
11:32 - effect
11:35 - let's say we want to do the same thing
11:38 - that we did for spinning for
11:41 - changing the color this time so
11:45 - i want to have something saying change
11:48 - color or color effect here
11:50 - so let's say something exactly like this
11:53 - i just duplicate it here
11:57 - and then
11:58 - i'm gonna get rid of this
12:01 - creating a new block and naming it
12:07 - color
12:09 - effect
12:13 - now you see how easy it was to use this
12:16 - function again
12:18 - all i needed to do was change this part
12:20 - of the code which is only one black
12:26 - now i'm gonna define
12:28 - color effect here
12:32 - so again
12:35 - it should be or it can be
12:40 - maybe forever
12:48 - or maybe let's just say repeat
12:51 - times four times whatever number of
12:54 - times
12:57 - and then if you
12:58 - go to the
12:59 - looks
13:00 - there are some codes already for color
13:04 - effect that you are going to modify and
13:06 - use them
13:09 - let's say change
13:13 - brightness
13:18 - effect by
13:25 - again it's nice to make it a variable of
13:28 - the loudness
13:29 - to make it relevant to our project
13:34 - i'm going to take an operator here
13:39 - by
13:40 - maybe
13:41 - let's say this time
13:44 - loudness
13:53 - divided by
13:57 - four
13:58 - we write first and then we play with
14:00 - numbers and
14:02 - when testing
14:04 - we can figure out what numbers work best
14:08 - okay now that the color effect is
14:10 - defined i can also call it here
14:14 - so
14:15 - when i'm dragging something that i've
14:17 - already defined to my code
14:21 - it's called calling a function so here
14:23 - i'm defining the function here i'm
14:25 - calling the function
14:34 - let's add
14:38 - a part which says
14:42 - clear color effect so that when i
14:45 - clear graphic effects so when i start i
14:48 - start as a fresh
14:51 - status
14:55 - also we can add a weight here
14:59 - so that you can more visibly
15:02 - see the changes
15:04 - let's say
15:06 - for 0.4 seconds and
15:11 - let's try what's happening
15:14 - i'm gonna start
15:24 - so for three times
15:26 - the color is becoming less and less and
15:29 - less
15:30 - but it's not very obvious
15:34 - maybe i say
15:37 - this
15:39 - and testing it
15:43 - save first
15:49 - wow it disappeared so quickly because
15:52 - this number is very small
15:55 - anyway
15:57 - you got the idea of what is happening
16:05 - you see every time that is rotating for
16:07 - three times the color is becoming
16:09 - brighter
16:13 - and i can make it even more
16:17 - so you got the idea you can play with
16:19 - this numbers you see now i have more
16:21 - numbers for 10 times and until it
16:23 - disappears
16:28 - this is such a cool animation we created
16:30 - by this function and it's all controlled
16:33 - by my voice
16:39 - now let's write the code for those two
16:43 - buttons so what i want to do is
16:45 - i want to decide
16:48 - to use the color effect or
16:52 - spin or both of them so i
16:54 - create a switch to turn each of them
16:57 - that i want on and off
17:05 - all right i have two buttons let's give
17:07 - them a meaningful name the first one i
17:10 - wanna
17:11 - name it
17:12 - spin control
17:15 - and the other
17:16 - one i'm naming it
17:21 - color
17:22 - effect
17:25 - control
17:26 - or switch
17:28 - you choose what you want to put
17:32 - and let's go to the costumes for each of
17:35 - them i want to have two costumes for on
17:38 - and off situation
17:40 - so i'm going to this custom
17:47 - let's
17:50 - name this
17:52 - spin on
17:56 - spin off
18:01 - so for the off
18:04 - let's change the color
18:06 - to
18:07 - something that makes more sense for when
18:10 - it's off
18:12 - maybe red or orange something like that
18:17 - and
18:18 - also the outside
18:20 - or
18:21 - let's ignore the outside is not that
18:23 - white
18:26 - here i can write just to be clear
18:30 - wow
18:30 - same color
18:33 - with black
18:35 - [Music]
18:37 - spin is
18:48 - so when it's
18:49 - red it means spin is off
18:58 - then let's select it and make it a
19:00 - little smaller to fit in
19:03 - spin is off
19:06 - so you can just write off or on but
19:09 - since i'm explaining i don't want to
19:11 - cause confusion i'm writing it more
19:13 - explicit
19:15 - and a green for
19:17 - okay here we go
19:19 - i'm gonna change it to green
19:22 - and fill
19:24 - okay
19:25 - and i need to add a text now
19:30 - here
19:37 - color is
19:38 - on
19:40 - and make it smaller
19:47 - something i could do is
19:54 - [Music]
19:57 - here i should write spin is on
20:00 - so i have a button
20:03 - for a spin has two customs the spin on
20:07 - spin off
20:08 - see it was too much trouble to create
20:11 - this i don't want to do this again here
20:13 - i delete this and instead i duplicate
20:16 - from the completed one
20:18 - and then i modify here
20:21 - so i just need to name it
20:23 - color control
20:28 - and then on the customs
20:30 - change this to
20:34 - color on
20:39 - color off
20:42 - easy peasy and here as well
20:56 - color is on
20:58 - now i have two buttons one for color one
21:01 - for spin
21:03 - and they are both in weird locations so
21:06 - let's just adjust them
21:11 - and when i did make it so small make it
21:13 - size 100
21:18 - the same here
21:21 - okay
21:22 - so what i want to do is i want to write
21:24 - a code
21:26 - so that when i press this
21:28 - i decide whether
21:34 - i want the my voice to affect the color
21:38 - or not or i want my voice to affect the
21:42 - spin or not so
21:44 - when i do this if with the spin button
21:47 - is on
21:48 - the
21:50 - pinwheel will rotate
21:53 - and when the collar is also on it will
21:55 - also
21:57 - use the color effect function that i've
22:00 - defined for it already
22:02 - but when both are off
22:05 - then none of them is supposed to work
22:07 - so that i can control which of these two
22:09 - functions or one of them or two of them
22:12 - at the same time can work
22:14 - now let's get to the code of writing the
22:17 - button how i'm gonna write it i'm gonna
22:20 - write it like this
22:24 - from the events
22:25 - when start click
22:27 - start or when green flight clicked
22:33 - let's give the spin you remember we
22:36 - defined the spin variable already
22:38 - let's set it let's give it an initial
22:42 - value
22:43 - so i'm going to set the initial value
22:46 - to 1.
22:49 - so spin is a binary has two values one
22:52 - and zero when it's one i want it to be
22:55 - turned on and when is
22:58 - zero i want it to be turned off
23:03 - so i wanna
23:04 - i want the default like when i run start
23:07 - my program
23:08 - i want the default to be on one
23:12 - i also want to make sure that
23:18 - so this is the spin
23:20 - that's in this location
23:22 - and this one is in this location so i
23:25 - click here to see the code
23:28 - so i say go to
23:32 - whatever is already here
23:35 - you see that
23:36 - this number which is the location of of
23:39 - this one also here
23:42 - i also want to make sure at the
23:45 - start at the beginning the costume is on
23:49 - the green one which is the on
23:53 - custom
23:54 - so switch custom to
23:56 - spin on
24:00 - now i want to say if i clicked on it so
24:04 - let's go to the events
24:06 - and that's nice that we have this when
24:08 - this is right clicked
24:11 - now go to the next custom so if i click
24:14 - i don't want it to be on anymore i want
24:16 - it to be off
24:19 - go to the next costume
24:21 - which is the off one
24:28 - and also
24:31 - change the spin value and variable
24:38 - so change the spin
24:42 - by one so what happens is when i click
24:46 - on this
24:48 - the custom color is changed and the spin
24:51 - value is changed by one
24:57 - so you see spin is one if i click again
25:00 - it becomes two three four but i don't
25:02 - want it to go until whatever number i
25:05 - want it to be only one and zero
25:07 - how to address this
25:11 - in order to address this i'm adding a
25:14 - second piece of code
25:19 - which is again
25:21 - when this sprite clicked
25:24 - forever
25:35 - if
25:41 - if the spin became more than one so
25:45 - if it's zero is okay if it's one is okay
25:48 - but if it becomes more than one
25:56 - then
26:03 - set the screen to zero
26:05 - so in this situation it will be only
26:07 - zero or one
26:12 - like
26:13 - set the
26:15 - spin to zero
26:19 - now let's see what happens
26:22 - so i click spin on
26:26 - the spin is zero
26:28 - i click off
26:30 - is
26:31 - one
26:33 - so it's
26:34 - either zero or one
26:37 - it won't go like two three four five
26:40 - here
26:43 - but what's happening is
26:46 - this pinwheel is not related to this
26:50 - button at all yet in order to make it
26:53 - relevant
26:55 - we need to make use of this variable
26:58 - that we have already defined so let's go
27:00 - to the pinwheel
27:02 - now that we define the spin variable and
27:05 - we
27:06 - have the spin button working we need to
27:09 - make use of the spin
27:12 - value inside the spin function on the
27:15 - pinwheel sprite
27:17 - so here
27:19 - i want to check the spin whether is one
27:22 - or zero only if it's
27:25 - one i want the spin to work
27:28 - so
27:29 - here
27:31 - i need an if condition
27:34 - control
27:36 - i'm adding an if condition an operator
27:41 - for checking the value of the spin
27:46 - and then the spin itself
27:50 - so if spin is one
27:54 - only then
27:57 - turn
27:58 - some decrease
28:00 - so right now
28:02 - let's save it first
28:07 - right now the spin is one and i'm
28:09 - talking so with my voice or
28:13 - this is rotating
28:15 - but if i click here
28:18 - this button is off and the value here is
28:22 - zero
28:23 - so
28:24 - what i'm calling the spin function is
28:27 - shaking the spin
28:30 - is it one
28:31 - it's not one so it never gets to the
28:34 - turn function
28:36 - so as you see it's not rotating anymore
28:39 - but the color is changing because
28:42 - we didn't write any code for the color
28:45 - button
28:47 - so i leave this one to you
28:49 - you can write exactly the similar code
28:52 - that we wrote for the spin

Cleaned transcript:

hello you lovely scratchers how are you doing i hope you are all feeling awesome welcome back to another kitty code ninja tutorial this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun in this tutorial we're going to learn to interact with virtual elements means the things on the screen such as sprites with our voice so instead of using mouse keyboard or anything else we are going to control the surprise using our voice the project that we are going to design is a pinwheel that can spin whenever i blow on it like this such a crabby pinwheel i have anyway stick around we're gonna see how to make it you're also going to learn to create on and off switch buttons in scratch without further ado let's cut to the chase so let's create a new project give it a relevant name i'm i'm gonna name it voice controlled pinwheel get rid of the tag and the cat and i need a pinwheel since the sprite is not already in scratch i'm gonna upload it from what i've downloaded from google image and i'm gonna put the link to the project in the description so that you can go and take the assets from there or you can download it by yourself so i have this beautiful pinwheel this was the part at the top and now i'm gonna add the pin as a handle now there is a line here let's take it and rotate it so that is all the way straight small and here we go let's adjust this a little bit to make sure that the pinwheel is at the top and the right position and also we need two buttons which is already here so just i'm searching for pattern and here i have it let's take maybe this one and i need two of it later we will see what i want to do with it okay now let's get to the code i'm also going to create two variables one the color effect and the other spin so these are going to be binary variables to use it for this with this buttons to switch on and off uh color effect and the spin so now i'm creating it later on you will see how i'm gonna use it spin the other one color effect oops color perfect okay in this lesson we are going to make use of functions and we will see how much easier our code will be read so to create a function i'm using blocks i'm gonna create a function for a spin i'm gonna name it like please spin or just spin easy and simple so here i should define what the spin function do so it's doing something and i'm going to define it the mistake i made is i define it on the line let's just make sure that this here as well okay now it's better i dragged it there and i'm gonna delete it from here now let's write the basic code of the spinning like the structure i run it like this when green flag clicked forever so going to control spin but in a certain condition let's take it another if then so i wanted to say by blowing here and based on the loudness of my voice i want the pinwheel to spin so in order to measure the loudness i'm going to sensing and there is something called loudness already in scratch for us but before i can use it in a comparison i should go to operator and take something like this so now i say if loudness is less than some number then going back to my blocks the function that i've already defined which was spin and put it here if loudness is less than let's choose a small number so that they don't have to shout then if loudness was less than two then spin but we didn't say what spin looks like we already only gave it a name defined it but it's an empty function now let's define it first and give it a test and see how it works what the job of the spin function is is to simply turn whatever sprite that it that is called on so in order to say turn forever i should take the forever and then go into motion and use something like this turn some amount of degrees so i play start and base on the loudness of my sound is turning let's change this to different number now stop save and start now i'm quiet oh why did i say less than i should say more that let's change this part first so let's take another operator and get rid of the right one so i want to say if loudness is more than something then start spinning start nothing yet the problem here is it did work but it is spinning really forever that's not what we want because now if i'm quiet i don't want it to spin because i wanted to make like like a real pinwheel so let's improve it a little bit here instead of turn 15 degrees now i can say turn loudness turn whatever the loudness number is so what happens is the louder i blow or talk or play music or whatever that i want to control my pinwheel with it the longer it spins i'm going to turn it down and i can also use some operator to make it a portion of the loudness or the loudness complete itself let's do it like this for and then you see it's so natural it spins and then stuff but right now since it's working with my voice now that i'm talking it's also rotating which it's not a problem that's how it works it can't distinguish between blowing or talking but it's really nice when you are playing a music with it is kind of like it's dancing with that music now you see how cool and easy is to read this function these two blocks of code it's a very tiny block it's very clear that here i only have a spin and if i don't want to know what is spin i don't have to be worried about it because it's already defined or i can just go in it and read it so basically what i'm trying to say is since the function is defined this part becomes something reusable and then someone that is taking the assets from my project can simply grab this code and continue on it and it's very easy to understand okay here is this one let's define one more function for the color changing or playing with the colors or giving it some sort of visual effect let's say we want to do the same thing that we did for spinning for changing the color this time so i want to have something saying change color or color effect here so let's say something exactly like this i just duplicate it here and then i'm gonna get rid of this creating a new block and naming it color effect now you see how easy it was to use this function again all i needed to do was change this part of the code which is only one black now i'm gonna define color effect here so again it should be or it can be maybe forever or maybe let's just say repeat times four times whatever number of times and then if you go to the looks there are some codes already for color effect that you are going to modify and use them let's say change brightness effect by again it's nice to make it a variable of the loudness to make it relevant to our project i'm going to take an operator here by maybe let's say this time loudness divided by four we write first and then we play with numbers and when testing we can figure out what numbers work best okay now that the color effect is defined i can also call it here so when i'm dragging something that i've already defined to my code it's called calling a function so here i'm defining the function here i'm calling the function let's add a part which says clear color effect so that when i clear graphic effects so when i start i start as a fresh status also we can add a weight here so that you can more visibly see the changes let's say for 0.4 seconds and let's try what's happening i'm gonna start so for three times the color is becoming less and less and less but it's not very obvious maybe i say this and testing it save first wow it disappeared so quickly because this number is very small anyway you got the idea of what is happening you see every time that is rotating for three times the color is becoming brighter and i can make it even more so you got the idea you can play with this numbers you see now i have more numbers for 10 times and until it disappears this is such a cool animation we created by this function and it's all controlled by my voice now let's write the code for those two buttons so what i want to do is i want to decide to use the color effect or spin or both of them so i create a switch to turn each of them that i want on and off all right i have two buttons let's give them a meaningful name the first one i wanna name it spin control and the other one i'm naming it color effect control or switch you choose what you want to put and let's go to the costumes for each of them i want to have two costumes for on and off situation so i'm going to this custom let's name this spin on spin off so for the off let's change the color to something that makes more sense for when it's off maybe red or orange something like that and also the outside or let's ignore the outside is not that white here i can write just to be clear wow same color with black spin is so when it's red it means spin is off then let's select it and make it a little smaller to fit in spin is off so you can just write off or on but since i'm explaining i don't want to cause confusion i'm writing it more explicit and a green for okay here we go i'm gonna change it to green and fill okay and i need to add a text now here color is on and make it smaller something i could do is here i should write spin is on so i have a button for a spin has two customs the spin on spin off see it was too much trouble to create this i don't want to do this again here i delete this and instead i duplicate from the completed one and then i modify here so i just need to name it color control and then on the customs change this to color on color off easy peasy and here as well color is on now i have two buttons one for color one for spin and they are both in weird locations so let's just adjust them and when i did make it so small make it size 100 the same here okay so what i want to do is i want to write a code so that when i press this i decide whether i want the my voice to affect the color or not or i want my voice to affect the spin or not so when i do this if with the spin button is on the pinwheel will rotate and when the collar is also on it will also use the color effect function that i've defined for it already but when both are off then none of them is supposed to work so that i can control which of these two functions or one of them or two of them at the same time can work now let's get to the code of writing the button how i'm gonna write it i'm gonna write it like this from the events when start click start or when green flight clicked let's give the spin you remember we defined the spin variable already let's set it let's give it an initial value so i'm going to set the initial value to 1. so spin is a binary has two values one and zero when it's one i want it to be turned on and when is zero i want it to be turned off so i wanna i want the default like when i run start my program i want the default to be on one i also want to make sure that so this is the spin that's in this location and this one is in this location so i click here to see the code so i say go to whatever is already here you see that this number which is the location of of this one also here i also want to make sure at the start at the beginning the costume is on the green one which is the on custom so switch custom to spin on now i want to say if i clicked on it so let's go to the events and that's nice that we have this when this is right clicked now go to the next custom so if i click i don't want it to be on anymore i want it to be off go to the next costume which is the off one and also change the spin value and variable so change the spin by one so what happens is when i click on this the custom color is changed and the spin value is changed by one so you see spin is one if i click again it becomes two three four but i don't want it to go until whatever number i want it to be only one and zero how to address this in order to address this i'm adding a second piece of code which is again when this sprite clicked forever if if the spin became more than one so if it's zero is okay if it's one is okay but if it becomes more than one then set the screen to zero so in this situation it will be only zero or one like set the spin to zero now let's see what happens so i click spin on the spin is zero i click off is one so it's either zero or one it won't go like two three four five here but what's happening is this pinwheel is not related to this button at all yet in order to make it relevant we need to make use of this variable that we have already defined so let's go to the pinwheel now that we define the spin variable and we have the spin button working we need to make use of the spin value inside the spin function on the pinwheel sprite so here i want to check the spin whether is one or zero only if it's one i want the spin to work so here i need an if condition control i'm adding an if condition an operator for checking the value of the spin and then the spin itself so if spin is one only then turn some decrease so right now let's save it first right now the spin is one and i'm talking so with my voice or this is rotating but if i click here this button is off and the value here is zero so what i'm calling the spin function is shaking the spin is it one it's not one so it never gets to the turn function so as you see it's not rotating anymore but the color is changing because we didn't write any code for the color button so i leave this one to you you can write exactly the similar code that we wrote for the spin as an exercise for the color and make sure to share whatever you did on the comment so that you can enjoy the exciting project that you made as well i really hope you like
