00:00 - hello and welcome to another kitty code
00:02 - ninja tutorial
00:03 - this is eddie and this is your place to
00:06 - learn to code and have fun
00:08 - today we are going to create a tutorial
00:10 - on transitioning from
00:11 - fall to winter
00:15 - today is the first day of winter and
00:18 - it's called
00:18 - winter solstice so it's the day that we
00:21 - are transitioning from fall to winter
00:24 - and i'm gonna show you how in scratch
00:26 - you can implement transitioning from
00:28 - fall to winter so
00:30 - this is only one example but this is
00:32 - really useful
00:34 - when you are going to create animation
00:36 - and tell a story
00:37 - and you need to transition from one
00:39 - scene to another scene
00:41 - so when you're going from like for
00:44 - instance
00:45 - from outside your house to inside the
00:48 - house and then you move around the
00:50 - scenes
00:51 - it's very useful in games very useful in
00:53 - storytelling
00:55 - and it's so much fun let's dive in
00:58 - all right we're going to see how we can
01:00 - move from fall through winter
01:05 - by using backdrops
01:08 - um so let's go to the scratch website
01:11 - spanish.mit
01:14 - so create and then for this
01:18 - we need two backdrops for the things
01:21 - that we are transitioning
01:23 - to and from i'm gonna choose
01:26 - one backdrop of fall and one for winter
01:29 - and i'm gonna use
01:30 - the backdrops from from the images that
01:33 - i have already downloaded
01:35 - on my computer so
01:40 - you most probably already know how to
01:42 - download the image from internet so i
01:44 - start from here
01:46 - uh first thing let's give our project a
01:48 - name
01:49 - so i'm going to give my project a name
01:52 - winter
01:54 - solstice and then
01:57 - let's get started so i need two
02:00 - backdrops
02:01 - that i'm gonna upload the backdrop from
02:03 - images that are in my computer
02:06 - one for fall and
02:10 - one for winter
02:14 - and winter so if i go to the backdrops
02:22 - i should see both images
02:26 - here and there is also the default
02:28 - backdrop
02:29 - you can either delete it or you can keep
02:31 - it i would
02:32 - keep it but it's your choice
02:36 - i will keep the cat you can
02:39 - insert any sprite that you like it's
02:42 - totally
02:42 - your choice so what i want is
02:47 - i want this cat to be
02:50 - here in the fall first
02:53 - and then glides here
02:57 - and after it reaches the end of the
03:01 - the corner goes to the winter so
03:04 - let's write the code uh first thing i
03:08 - want to start with the
03:10 - full backdrop so i need to make sure
03:12 - that i'm on the fall backdrop first
03:16 - one point is if i click on the code here
03:20 - there is nothing under the motion
03:22 - because
03:23 - we are not supposed to move the backdrop
03:25 - motion code is only
03:27 - for this price so i need to make sure
03:29 - that i click on the sprite first
03:32 - and then i see the motion is here so
03:35 - let's uh trigger our event
03:39 - by writing the code
03:42 - when start clicked so
03:46 - when start clicked
03:49 - uh what i want is i want the cat to be
03:52 - here
03:52 - so i move the cat here
03:57 - when i move the cat here i see
04:00 - what is the position here so
04:03 - it says minus 189 on the x
04:07 - and minus 1 to 5 on the y
04:10 - so if i go to the motion
04:13 - and then i drag the go to
04:16 - the numbers here are also showing
04:21 - where is here and where i put my cat so
04:24 - whenever i'm dragging it like from here
04:26 - the value that i see
04:28 - on the x and y are the same as what i
04:30 - see
04:31 - here initially i can definitely change
04:33 - it but it's a good
04:34 - trick to set the values to where you
04:38 - want just move your
04:39 - sprite and then this will change and it
04:42 - will also change here so
04:44 - when i start clicked go to this location
04:48 - and now from the looks
04:54 - we need to go to the
04:57 - switch backdrop to
05:04 - um
05:07 - fall because i want to start from fall
05:12 - i also want to
05:17 - move the cat to the end of the scene
05:20 - so i'm kind of trying to tell my story
05:23 - so whenever you are creating your
05:24 - animation
05:25 - you also write your storyboard and try
05:28 - to create your story in the language of
05:30 - code so my next step is
05:33 - gliding the cat
05:37 - so i go to the motions
05:40 - and then i look for a glide
05:48 - i glide one second
05:52 - to so i could do it
05:56 - better by moving the cat here
06:00 - first to see the location
06:04 - so i would say this one this part is 205
06:08 - one minus 115 so because i want the very
06:12 - end
06:13 - i would say maybe 2 10
06:16 - and on the y
06:20 - this one
06:23 - all right let's say after the gliding
06:26 - i want this um cat
06:29 - to say something like
06:33 - goodbye fall
06:37 - i will say drag this block from the
06:41 - looks
06:42 - that says
06:48 - goodbye fall for
06:51 - one second let's try and see what
06:54 - happens
06:54 - now so the cat is gliding and saying
06:57 - goodbye fall
07:00 - let's also make it look like the fall
07:03 - or maybe somebody is answering
07:06 - back there is something very interesting
07:10 - here that if you click here
07:12 - so you have a set of codes here but then
07:15 - there are things that are kind of hidden
07:17 - that you can bring them from here so if
07:20 - you click here
07:23 - you can click on the text to speech
07:28 - and now you see some more stuff here
07:31 - so i say
07:37 - speak
07:43 - goodbye
07:48 - and then at the end i need i will be
07:52 - able to hear um
07:58 - the goodbye is being set back to the cat
08:01 - so let's test it so i click on the start
08:06 - say goodbye you see did you read it says
08:09 - goodbye
08:10 - and then after this i want to transition
08:13 - to the winter now
08:18 - again i sage backdrop so from the looks
08:21 - i switch back to up to winter
08:29 - when i went to the winter i want the cat
08:31 - to be at the
08:33 - beginning the left corner of the scene
08:36 - so
08:37 - that it looks like it's gone from here
08:39 - to the next scene and started again
08:42 - so i moved the cat here so that the
08:45 - glide
08:48 - so that the position here is set to
08:50 - where i want it to be so i drag this
08:53 - simply here and the position is already
08:57 - the value of the values of the position
09:00 - are already
09:00 - written equal to what i want
09:04 - so i go to this point and then
09:07 - let's assume i want to
09:11 - let special first run it
09:15 - so you say goodbye here back and i go
09:19 - here
09:20 - let's assume that i want the cat after
09:22 - this
09:24 - to go to here so i drag it here
09:28 - and then i say go to this
09:31 - location or maybe glide to this location
09:36 - goodbye so if you like to i drag this
09:39 - here
09:40 - and i say
09:44 - um this location is 0 and 17 so i glide
09:48 - to this location
09:52 - and i would say i would say
10:02 - hello winter
10:07 - for one second
10:10 - and then i also want to hear back hello
10:14 - so
10:17 - i can change the voice so that
10:20 - it looks like it sounds like the waves
10:23 - are winter and autumn are different so i
10:25 - change it to a different one
10:30 - so i set
10:33 - voice to giant and i
10:38 - speak
10:44 - hello cat
10:47 - let's test it
10:51 - goodbye
10:54 - hello okay really cool
10:58 - tutorial this is very helpful when
11:00 - you're gonna create
11:01 - animation and have a great winter ahead
11:06 - if you like the video don't forget to

hello and welcome to another kitty code ninja tutorial this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun today we are going to create a tutorial on transitioning from fall to winter today is the first day of winter and it's called winter solstice so it's the day that we are transitioning from fall to winter and i'm gonna show you how in scratch you can implement transitioning from fall to winter so this is only one example but this is really useful when you are going to create animation and tell a story and you need to transition from one scene to another scene so when you're going from like for instance from outside your house to inside the house and then you move around the scenes it's very useful in games very useful in storytelling and it's so much fun let's dive in all right we're going to see how we can move from fall through winter by using backdrops um so let's go to the scratch website spanish.mit so create and then for this we need two backdrops for the things that we are transitioning to and from i'm gonna choose one backdrop of fall and one for winter and i'm gonna use the backdrops from from the images that i have already downloaded on my computer so you most probably already know how to download the image from internet so i start from here uh first thing let's give our project a name so i'm going to give my project a name winter solstice and then let's get started so i need two backdrops that i'm gonna upload the backdrop from images that are in my computer one for fall and one for winter and winter so if i go to the backdrops i should see both images here and there is also the default backdrop you can either delete it or you can keep it i would keep it but it's your choice i will keep the cat you can insert any sprite that you like it's totally your choice so what i want is i want this cat to be here in the fall first and then glides here and after it reaches the end of the the corner goes to the winter so let's write the code uh first thing i want to start with the full backdrop so i need to make sure that i'm on the fall backdrop first one point is if i click on the code here there is nothing under the motion because we are not supposed to move the backdrop motion code is only for this price so i need to make sure that i click on the sprite first and then i see the motion is here so let's uh trigger our event by writing the code when start clicked so when start clicked uh what i want is i want the cat to be here so i move the cat here when i move the cat here i see what is the position here so it says minus 189 on the x and minus 1 to 5 on the y so if i go to the motion and then i drag the go to the numbers here are also showing where is here and where i put my cat so whenever i'm dragging it like from here the value that i see on the x and y are the same as what i see here initially i can definitely change it but it's a good trick to set the values to where you want just move your sprite and then this will change and it will also change here so when i start clicked go to this location and now from the looks we need to go to the switch backdrop to um fall because i want to start from fall i also want to move the cat to the end of the scene so i'm kind of trying to tell my story so whenever you are creating your animation you also write your storyboard and try to create your story in the language of code so my next step is gliding the cat so i go to the motions and then i look for a glide i glide one second to so i could do it better by moving the cat here first to see the location so i would say this one this part is 205 one minus 115 so because i want the very end i would say maybe 2 10 and on the y this one all right let's say after the gliding i want this um cat to say something like goodbye fall i will say drag this block from the looks that says goodbye fall for one second let's try and see what happens now so the cat is gliding and saying goodbye fall let's also make it look like the fall or maybe somebody is answering back there is something very interesting here that if you click here so you have a set of codes here but then there are things that are kind of hidden that you can bring them from here so if you click here you can click on the text to speech and now you see some more stuff here so i say speak goodbye and then at the end i need i will be able to hear um the goodbye is being set back to the cat so let's test it so i click on the start say goodbye you see did you read it says goodbye and then after this i want to transition to the winter now again i sage backdrop so from the looks i switch back to up to winter when i went to the winter i want the cat to be at the beginning the left corner of the scene so that it looks like it's gone from here to the next scene and started again so i moved the cat here so that the glide so that the position here is set to where i want it to be so i drag this simply here and the position is already the value of the values of the position are already written equal to what i want so i go to this point and then let's assume i want to let special first run it so you say goodbye here back and i go here let's assume that i want the cat after this to go to here so i drag it here and then i say go to this location or maybe glide to this location goodbye so if you like to i drag this here and i say um this location is 0 and 17 so i glide to this location and i would say i would say hello winter for one second and then i also want to hear back hello so i can change the voice so that it looks like it sounds like the waves are winter and autumn are different so i change it to a different one so i set voice to giant and i speak hello cat let's test it goodbye hello okay really cool
