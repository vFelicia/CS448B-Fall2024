00:01 - hello scratchers how are you doing
00:04 - i hope you are all doing wonderful in
00:06 - this video we are going to implement
00:08 - gravity in scratch
00:12 - what do we need to learn about gravity
00:14 - gravity has a lot of applications in
00:17 - games
00:18 - if you're a gamer you probably know
00:21 - flappy bird
00:22 - super mario and many many platformer
00:25 - games that requires
00:27 - jumping and falling why is that relevant
00:31 - because when i when you jump off really
00:33 - high
00:34 - you don't just keep up going up come
00:36 - down because of
00:38 - the gravity wait
00:44 - so without further ado let's cut the
00:47 - chase
00:48 - welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this
00:52 - is eddie and this is your place to learn
00:54 - to code and have fun
00:57 - all right so first thing let's
01:00 - define the event so when
01:04 - start clicked let's say i
01:07 - want to start from when the cat is
01:10 - in this location so i drag it to the
01:14 - location that i want
01:15 - and as a result i can see that this
01:19 - two numbers minus 31 and 89
01:22 - are updated with my movements
01:26 - so you see as i drag it here
01:34 - okay now let's see how falling
01:38 - would look like how about if we say
01:42 - forever so from control
01:46 - forever change
01:50 - y by a
01:55 - negative number like small minus
01:58 - one steps being repeated
02:02 - forever so like minus one minus one
02:04 - minus one
02:06 - until forever so
02:09 - what happens if i click start
02:15 - okay i'm gonna attach it to this one
02:18 - so that it knows after start i want it
02:21 - to happen
02:23 - so it goes down but it doesn't look like
02:26 - it's falling
02:27 - because how about the gravity
02:30 - if it's if it if the effect of gravity
02:33 - was uh included
02:37 - it should not go down at the constant
02:41 - speed it should become faster and faster
02:44 - and faster as
02:46 - it's falling down so it should be much
02:49 - faster when it's going when it's getting
02:51 - closer to the ground
02:55 - so in order to in order to fix this
02:58 - as i said i do not want a constant
03:01 - value for the speed but i want a
03:05 - variable so i'm gonna define
03:07 - a variable and i'm
03:10 - gonna name it y velocity
03:15 - so this is the name that is commonly
03:17 - used for
03:19 - this situation is basically the vertical
03:22 - speed
03:23 - but i'm just using the name that is
03:26 - often used
03:27 - so that when you see it in other codes
03:30 - you will
03:31 - recognize it easier so wait
03:34 - y velocity is basically the speed across
03:37 - the y direction so i'm gonna
03:41 - put the y velocity
03:46 - instead of -1
03:49 - and i'm gonna set my variable also
03:53 - to minus one
03:56 - so far nothing is changed so i only used
04:00 - the variable and i assigned the same
04:03 - value
04:04 - to it but now i'm gonna
04:07 - use this variable
04:11 - in a better way
04:14 - and something is wrong here which is i
04:17 - forgot to change
04:18 - this to y velocity so i change it first
04:23 - one more thing i'm gonna do is
04:27 - so so far
04:30 - i've only replaced y velocity with
04:34 - minus one so still the same
04:38 - but i want the y velocity to be
04:42 - changed in within every loop so what i'm
04:45 - gonna do
04:46 - is change y velocity by minus one
04:50 - so every round that this
04:53 - loop is executed the speed is
04:57 - changed to one
05:01 - negative one more negative one
05:04 - so i'm going to drag this here and then
05:07 - if i play
05:08 - so now you see it's kind of like this
05:10 - actually the cat is
05:12 - falling and the speed is increasing in
05:15 - order to show it better
05:17 - i'm gonna put a weight here
05:23 - so a bit of weight
05:29 - okay now you
05:33 - look at this number
05:38 - you see it's slowly slowly increasing
05:41 - it's not the more it comes down
05:45 - the increase is also more so
05:48 - the closer it gets to the ground is
05:51 - coming down
05:52 - faster
05:57 - okay now let's
06:01 - get rid of this weight
06:04 - i'm to create also a new variable
06:08 - and i'm going to name it gravity
06:17 - and then i'm gonna add one more step
06:22 - which is setting the initial
06:26 - value for gravity not initial just like
06:30 - setting the value of gravity to
06:33 - let's say one or it can be
06:36 - less if let's say i was on the moon
06:40 - or depending on the
06:44 - amount of gravity that i want depending
06:47 - on
06:48 - how hard i want it to fall down
06:51 - i can change the amount of gravity
06:55 - and then here instead of saying change
06:59 - v velocity by -1
07:02 - i'm gonna use gravity here
07:08 - and i'm gonna change it by
07:18 - velocity minus gravity
07:22 - o y velocity
07:27 - minus gravity
07:32 - come on here okay go go go up
07:36 - okay now it's good also
07:39 - i can change it back to zero
07:43 - y velocity because gravity
07:46 - is gonna reduce it anyway
07:49 - now let's see what happens the good
07:52 - thing about
07:53 - writing this way is let's say
07:57 - i'm gonna go to the moon and the gravity
08:00 - is much less just let's say
08:03 - 0.2 now
08:07 - it might be even less
08:15 - it's becoming faster actually
08:19 - so if i put it one
08:26 - um it's not actually much noticeable
08:29 - let's say
08:30 - if it was 10 a really huge gravity
08:33 - is super fast but if it's like
08:37 - this number very
08:40 - much slower
08:44 - i mean the increase of the speed is much
08:47 - slower
08:49 - okay
08:52 - let's also experiment with changing this
08:56 - initial y velocity
09:00 - to a different number right now that is
09:02 - zero
09:07 - i'm aiming to just right away
09:11 - go down but what if i change it to a
09:14 - positive value
09:17 - let's say i'm putting 12 here
09:21 - so let's see what happens is it goes up
09:24 - a bit first it didn't come back
09:30 - oh the reason is not coming down is
09:34 - actually here
09:37 - i need to set the velocity to this
09:40 - number but not
09:41 - not but not changing it so
09:45 - let's drag set
09:49 - y velocity 2
09:53 - and then this value
09:56 - and this one the top one
10:00 - was wrong so i put it here
10:05 - so i'm gonna set the y
10:08 - velocity to some positive number so that
10:11 - the cat
10:12 - jumps a little bit up and then down so
10:16 - look once more it goes a little
10:19 - up and then comes down
10:27 - so now let's make it a little more
10:30 - interactive so
10:31 - i'm gonna change this back to zero
10:35 - and then i'm going to control
10:38 - the cat with my space bar
10:42 - so that when i'm pressing this face bar
10:44 - i want the cat to jump
10:46 - up and then when i'm releasing it i just
10:48 - wanted to
10:49 - let the gravity uh
10:53 - pull and pull it down so
10:56 - i'm gonna put a key if
11:01 - space i just want to put it right
11:04 - up
11:09 - if the space key is
11:12 - pressed from that sensing
11:16 - if q space press only in that
11:20 - situation i'm going to set
11:23 - y velocity to a
11:27 - positive number so
11:30 - set
11:35 - set y velocity to
11:38 - maybe seven and now let's see
11:42 - so with space
11:46 - actually so if it's not pressed
11:53 - i will put this back
11:58 - and also this one out so now
12:02 - with pressing the space i'm controlling
12:04 - it but when i'm not pressing so if you
12:07 - listen to my
12:09 - keyboard i'm pressing it goes up
12:12 - i'm releasing it goes down it's very
12:16 - useful in
12:17 - game development if you follow the line
12:21 - and could make the same thing
12:23 - congratulation
12:24 - i hope you liked it if you did don't
12:27 - forget to press
12:28 - like and help me to be
12:31 - known in this youtube ocean share with
12:34 - your friends
12:35 - subscribe and thank you so much
12:38 - and see you next week

hello scratchers how are you doing i hope you are all doing wonderful in this video we are going to implement gravity in scratch what do we need to learn about gravity gravity has a lot of

forever so from control forever change y by a negative number like small minus one steps being repeated forever so like minus one minus one minus one until forever so what happens if i click start okay i'm gonna attach it to this one so that it knows after start i want it to happen so it goes down but it doesn't look like it's falling because how about the gravity if it's if it if the effect of

it can be less if let's say i was on the moon or depending on the amount of gravity that i want depending on how hard i want it to fall down i can change the amount of gravity and then here instead of saying change v velocity by 1 i'm gonna use gravity here and i'm gonna change it by velocity minus gravity o y velocity minus gravity come on here okay go go go up okay now it's good also i can change it back to zero y velocity because gravity is gonna reduce it anyway now let's see what happens the good thing about writing this way is let's say i'm gonna go to the moon and the gravity is much less just let's say 0.2 now it might be even less it's becoming faster actually so if i put it one um it's not actually much noticeable let's say if it was 10 a really huge gravity is super fast but if it's like this number very much slower i mean the increase of the speed is much slower okay let's also experiment with changing this initial y velocity to a different number right now that is zero i'm aiming to just right away go down but what if i change it to a positive value let's say i'm putting 12 here so let's see what happens is it goes up a bit first it didn't come back oh the reason is not coming down is actually here i need to set the velocity to this number but not not but not changing it so let's drag set y velocity 2 and then this value and this one the top one was wrong so i put it

only in that situation i'm going to set y velocity to a positive number so set set y velocity to maybe seven and now let's see so with space actually so if it's not pressed i will put this back and also this one out so now with pressing the space i'm controlling it but when i'm not pressing so if you listen to my keyboard i'm pressing it goes up i'm releasing it goes down it's very useful in game development if you follow the line and could make the same thing congratulation i hope you liked it if you did don't forget to press like and help me to be known in this youtube ocean share with
