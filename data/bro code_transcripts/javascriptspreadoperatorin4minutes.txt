00:00 - hey everybody today I'm going to explain
00:01 - the spread operator in JavaScript the
00:04 - spread operator is represented by three
00:06 - dots the spread operator allows an
00:08 - iterable such as an array or string to
00:11 - be expanded in separate elements what
00:13 - this does is unpack the elements here's
00:16 - an example let's create an array of
00:19 - numbers pick some numbers I'll just pick
00:21 - 1 through five 1 2 3 4 5 then just to
00:27 - test this let's console.log
00:30 - my array
00:32 - numbers in this array what if I would
00:34 - like to find the greatest value well one
00:37 - way in which I could do that is let's
00:39 - declare a maximum let maximum this is
00:42 - going to be a variable equals I will use
00:46 - the max method of math what would happen
00:49 - if I place our array within this
00:51 - method then I will display our
00:55 - maximum so we have not a number using
00:58 - the max method we can't place an array
01:00 - directly within this method however by
01:02 - utilizing the spread operator we can
01:04 - spread this array into different
01:06 - elements so we will preedee this array
01:09 - with the spread operator we are going to
01:12 - unpack the elements now if I run this
01:14 - program again we have our result of five
01:17 - when you use the spread operator imagine
01:19 - that you're opening a box and taking out
01:21 - all the contents inside like you're
01:23 - unpacking something let's find the
01:25 - minimum this time let minimum equals
01:31 - math.min we will pass our array of
01:35 - numbers then use the spread operator to
01:38 - spread our array into different elements
01:40 - what is the minimum value from this
01:42 - array that would be one you can also do
01:45 - this with strings too you can separate a
01:47 - string into different
01:49 - characters let let's create a username
01:53 - equals type your name first name and
01:56 - last name I will create an array name
01:59 - named letters letters
02:02 - equals we'll create a new array let's
02:05 - take our username it's a string and use
02:08 - the spread
02:09 - operator then I will display our letters
02:14 - console.log
02:17 - letters and here's my name divided into
02:20 - different characters what we have is an
02:21 - array of characters with my array of
02:24 - characters I can join them back together
02:26 - and insert characters between each
02:28 - element I will meth chain the join
02:30 - method after our
02:32 - array we'll add a dash between each
02:36 - character so now my username is all one
02:39 - string but there's a dash between each
02:42 - character okay now this time we're going
02:44 - to create an array of fruits we'll make
02:46 - a shallow copy of an array using the
02:48 - spread
02:50 - operator add some fruit I'll add an
02:53 - apple an
02:55 - orange and a
02:57 - banana then I will console
03:00 - dolog my
03:03 - fruits I can create a shallow copy of
03:06 - this array using the spread operator a
03:08 - shallow copy means it's a different data
03:10 - structure but it contains identical
03:13 - values I'll create a copy of fruits
03:16 - named new fruits
03:20 - equals an
03:22 - array let's take our fruits array then
03:25 - use the spread
03:27 - operator let's display new fruits and it
03:30 - should be an identical copy yep there's
03:33 - no apparent change we have two different
03:36 - arrays but they contain identical
03:38 - elements we can combine two or more
03:41 - arrays using the spread
03:43 - operator let's create an array of
03:48 - vegetables let's add some
03:50 - carrots
03:53 - celery
03:56 - potatoes I'll rename new fruits as Foods
04:00 - let's add our array of fruits we're
04:03 - spreading
04:04 - it comma then we will spread our
04:08 - vegetables
04:09 - array then we will display our array
04:12 - Foods this array contains all of the
04:14 - elements from these two arrays fruits
04:17 - and vegetables we can use the spread
04:19 - operator to combine arrays we even have
04:21 - the capability to append separate
04:23 - elements along with unpacking these
04:25 - arrays I will also add eggs and
04:31 - milk we have all of the elements from
04:34 - our two arrays plus a few extras eggs
04:37 - and milk all right everybody so that's
04:39 - the spread operator it's three dots it
04:41 - allows an iterable such as an array or
04:44 - string to be expanded into separate
04:46 - elements and well everybody that is the
04:49 - spread operator in
04:52 - JavaScript
