00:01 - hey everybody just so you know that this
00:03 - topic is completely optional if you're
00:05 - ever interested in making any sort of
00:07 - games with javascript then this video is
00:09 - a must let's begin to create a random
00:11 - number let's declare a variable and we
00:13 - will set the sequel to
00:15 - math dot and there is a random method
00:18 - then let's display whatever x is
00:20 - console.log
00:21 - x the random method of math will
00:24 - generate a random decimal number between
00:26 - 0 and 1. but we can actually use that
00:29 - maybe we're rolling a dice how do i
00:31 - generate a random number between 1 and
00:33 - 6. so to do this i'm going to take
00:36 - math.random and multiply this by 6. this
00:40 - gives us a random decimal number between
00:43 - 0 and 5 technically to truncate the
00:46 - decimal portion we can round down i will
00:48 - surround this with a set of parentheses
00:50 - and we will use math.floor
00:54 - and this will round down this generates
00:56 - a random number between zero and five
00:58 - because computers always start with zero
01:00 - if i need one through six i can add an
01:02 - offset i'll just add plus one this
01:05 - generates a random number between one
01:07 - and six as if we were rolling a dice now
01:09 - i like to play a lot of dungeons and
01:11 - dragons and there's different sized dice
01:13 - there's eight-sided dice 10-sided dice
01:16 - 20-sided dice etc if i'm simulating
01:18 - rolling a 20-sided dice i would multiply
01:21 - math.random method times 20 plus 1. so
01:25 - this generates a random number between
01:27 - one and twenty maybe i need to roll a
01:29 - couple dice i'll copy this line of code
01:32 - we'll create variables y and z
01:36 - then display them
01:38 - console.log x y and z this would be as
01:42 - if we're rolling three dice we get three
01:45 - random numbers between one and six just
01:47 - for fun let's create some labels and
01:49 - generate some random numbers within our
01:51 - dom so within the body of my html
01:54 - document i'll create a couple labels
01:56 - label id this will be x label then close
02:00 - this label add a line break i'll add two
02:03 - more
02:05 - y label
02:07 - and z label
02:09 - then i'll create a button
02:10 - close the tag
02:12 - type equals button
02:15 - id equals roll
02:18 - button
02:19 - then i will add some text to the button
02:21 - roll make sure to save heading back to
02:24 - our javascript file
02:27 - when we click on this button we will
02:29 - execute a function
02:30 - so we need to select our button document
02:33 - dot get
02:35 - element by id
02:37 - the name of our button is roll button
02:42 - dot on click
02:44 - equals set the sql to a function
02:47 - parentheses curly braces
02:51 - let's copy these lines of code
02:56 - we don't need to declare these again
02:58 - let's get rid of this text
03:00 - we'll declare the variables at the top
03:03 - so after rolling three random numbers
03:05 - between one and six
03:07 - i will update our labels
03:08 - x label y label and z label we need to
03:11 - select each of these labels
03:13 - document dot
03:15 - get element by id xlabel dot inner
03:20 - html set the sequel to
03:23 - x
03:25 - then do the same thing with y and z
03:28 - make sure to change the labels to y
03:31 - label equals y
03:33 - z label equals z
03:36 - so make sure to save both of your files
03:39 - oh i'm forgetting z there okay
03:41 - so now when i press this button we will
03:43 - roll three dice and we end up with three
03:46 - random numbers between one and six
03:49 - so yeah that's how to generate some
03:50 - random numbers in javascript if this
03:53 - video helped you out you can help me out
03:54 - by smashing that like button leave a
