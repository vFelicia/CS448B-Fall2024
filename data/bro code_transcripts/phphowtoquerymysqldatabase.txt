00:00 - hey everybody in today's video I'm going
00:02 - to show you how we can retrieve data
00:04 - from a mySQL database using PHP I have
00:07 - already established a MySQL connection
00:09 - I'm going to include that file that
00:12 - establishes the connection then at the
00:14 - end of my script I will close that
00:16 - connection with the MySQL close function
00:18 - the first thing we'll do is write an SQL
00:21 - query I will store that within a
00:23 - variable named SQL in my table I would
00:26 - like to select a user let's select
00:28 - SpongeBob the query would look something
00:30 - like this let's select let's say
00:33 - everything
00:35 - from our table which I named users
00:39 - where if you don't write a where Clause
00:42 - your query is going to return more than
00:44 - one row I'll show you how we can handle
00:46 - that later select all from users where
00:49 - user is equal to SpongeBob but put that
00:54 - within single quotes
00:57 - this is our SQL query to make a query we
01:01 - can use the my sqli worry function
01:06 - we will pass in our connection object
01:10 - then our query SQL
01:13 - if successful this function will return
01:15 - an object we will store that as a
01:18 - variable named result so result is
01:22 - technically an object somewhere within
01:24 - this object there's an associative array
01:27 - to find how many rows are returned from
01:30 - our query function we can place that
01:32 - within an if statement
01:33 - we will use this function mysqli
01:37 - underscore num
01:39 - rows function this function will return
01:43 - how many rows are within our result
01:46 - really it should only be one in this
01:48 - example
01:49 - if there's at least one result
01:52 - we could write a condition such as if
01:55 - the number of rows is greater than zero
01:57 - there's at least one matching row
02:00 - to get that Row from our result let's
02:03 - store that within a variable named row
02:05 - set this equal to the my sqli
02:09 - underscore
02:11 - fetch underscore Asos for associative
02:17 - then pass in our result
02:19 - this function Returns the next available
02:22 - row within our object our row is an
02:25 - associative array we can access this
02:28 - data by a key then be returned one of
02:30 - the values
02:32 - let's Echo
02:34 - row
02:35 - at index of ID
02:38 - then I'll add a break afterwards
02:42 - let's see what we have
02:44 - we have the user ID of one
02:48 - let's get the username
02:51 - I think it's just user
02:53 - one SpongeBob
02:56 - then the registration date
02:59 - reg date so these are the names of the
03:02 - columns
03:04 - yeah here's SpongeBob's ID is username
03:07 - and the registration date
03:10 - those were the fields found within our
03:12 - table
03:13 - now if there are no results let's say
03:15 - we're looking for Sandy
03:18 - well we don't do anything
03:20 - let's add an else clause
03:22 - else else let's Echo
03:25 - no results found or maybe no user found
03:31 - no user found that's how to retrieve one
03:35 - row from a table what if you need to
03:37 - retrieve multiple rows
03:39 - we can make some adjustments we would
03:42 - want to utilize a loop I'll enclose this
03:45 - line of code within a while loop
03:52 - while there are rows
03:56 - we will display each user's information
04:01 - let's get rid of the where Clause we
04:03 - will return every user
04:05 - you would just need a looping structure
04:07 - of some sort to Loop through each row
04:09 - within your result alright everybody so
04:12 - that's how to query data from a database
04:14 - you write an SQL query use the query
04:17 - function this returns an object then
04:20 - you'll need to get each row from the
04:22 - object and then you can do that with
04:24 - this function if you need to return more
04:26 - than one row you can stick that within a
04:29 - loop like a while loop and that is how
04:31 - to query data from a mySQL database in
04:34 - PHP
