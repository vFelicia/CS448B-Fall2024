00:00 - hey what's going on everybody in this
00:01 - topic I'm gonna give you an introduction
00:03 - to using flexbox in CSS in about 10
00:06 - minutes or so why don't you go ahead and
00:08 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - all right let's jump in everybody we
00:14 - have a little bit of setup to do we'll
00:16 - create a development with the class of
00:19 - container
00:21 - within our container class we'll create
00:24 - a few developments we'll create four
00:27 - these will be boxes
00:29 - for the class I will set that to be box
00:32 - the first inner development will have an
00:34 - ID of box one
00:37 - the inner text will be one let's copy
00:40 - our inner development pasted three times
00:42 - for a total of four
00:44 - change box 1 to box two for the next
00:46 - element
00:47 - then three
00:49 - then four and that's all we need for our
00:51 - HTML file let's go to our style sheet
00:55 - we'll style our boxes we will select the
00:57 - Box class
01:00 - I'll set the width to be 150 pixels
01:04 - same thing goes with the height
01:07 - let's change the background colors we'll
01:09 - begin with the ID of box one
01:12 - I will set the background color to be
01:15 - something red
01:16 - I'll use hsl values because I like them
01:20 - let's go with that then let's color box
01:23 - two
01:24 - box two let's make that yellow
01:27 - box three will be green
01:33 - then box four will be blue
01:38 - let's change the font size real quick
01:41 - font size 8 em
01:45 - then text align Center
01:49 - I'll add a border radius just to round
01:51 - the corners border radius 15 pixels
01:56 - and that is all the setup we'll need we
01:58 - are ready to begin
01:59 - with our container class we can Flex all
02:02 - of the elements within this container
02:04 - meaning all of these inner div elements
02:06 - so we'll take our container class dot
02:10 - container
02:11 - then set the display property to be Flex
02:16 - you can see that the positioning of
02:17 - these elements has already changed by
02:20 - default the flex Direction property is
02:24 - set to row
02:25 - you can see that there's no apparent
02:28 - change when I refresh the page
02:29 - for a row but in reverse order we can
02:32 - set Flex direction to be row reverse
02:36 - so now one is on the right hand side
02:38 - followed by two three then four
02:41 - to arrange these elements within a
02:43 - column we can set Flex direction to be
02:45 - column
02:46 - or even column reverse
02:50 - then at the bottom we have one then two
02:52 - three then four
02:54 - so that's Flex Direction let's delete
02:57 - the flex Direction property
02:59 - then we have the justify content
03:02 - property
03:04 - justify content sets the alignment on
03:07 - the main axis think of the x-axis by
03:10 - default it's Flex start there's no
03:13 - apparent change
03:14 - flex and would justify the content at
03:17 - the end
03:18 - see we're beginning with four then three
03:21 - two and one when we had Flex Direction
03:23 - set to row reverse it was one two three
03:27 - four but in this case it's four three
03:29 - two one then there's Center if you need
03:32 - to Center align these elements on the
03:34 - main axis
03:35 - we can place the extra space evenly
03:38 - between each of these elements by
03:40 - setting justify content to space
03:43 - between
03:45 - and if I were to expand this page
03:48 - the space between them is increasing
03:51 - you also have space around
03:55 - the area outside of these elements is
03:57 - also included now with space around
04:00 - then we have space evenly
04:07 - all right and that is the Justified
04:09 - content property we can justify elements
04:12 - on the main axis then there's the cross
04:14 - axis think of it as the y-axis up and
04:17 - down what we'll need to do in this
04:19 - example is expand our container just to
04:22 - show you the size of the container I
04:23 - will add a border to The Container class
04:26 - border 10 pixels
04:28 - solid black
04:31 - here's my current container
04:33 - I will increase the height of the
04:35 - container
04:36 - let's set the height to be 90 viewport
04:40 - height units
04:42 - so this is the total size of my
04:44 - container now
04:46 - ninety percent of the height of the web
04:48 - page
04:49 - what we'll use now is the Align items
04:51 - property which is used for the cross
04:53 - access
04:55 - align Dash items
04:59 - the default is flex start there's no
05:01 - change
05:03 - flex and we'll place these elements at
05:06 - the bottom of our container
05:09 - then there's Center align item Center
05:12 - that will place them in the middle of
05:14 - the Cross axis
05:17 - then there's Baseline
05:20 - so with Baseline the text is going to be
05:23 - aligned they're all the same size though
05:25 - we can't really notice the difference
05:27 - with box one let me change the font size
05:31 - font size 1 em you can see that the
05:34 - number one is aligned with the rest of
05:35 - the characters
05:37 - so if I were to increase the font size
05:39 - you can see that they're still aligned
05:42 - but let's eliminate that font size
05:44 - property
05:45 - let's delete our align items property
05:49 - we'll need more elements let's cop BR4
05:52 - inner developments paste them we should
05:55 - have a total of eight one two three four
05:58 - one two three four you can see that
06:00 - these items are getting squished now
06:01 - they're all being compressed we can set
06:04 - the flex wrap property so with our
06:07 - container I will set the flex wrap
06:10 - property to be wrap
06:13 - these elements will now wrap if there's
06:15 - not enough space if I were to expand the
06:18 - size of my container
06:20 - there's now enough room but if we run
06:21 - out of room they'll be pushed down
06:23 - further down the page
06:25 - by default Flex wrap is no wrap
06:30 - otherwise there's rap reverse
06:35 - now they're in reverse order
06:39 - let's use flex wrap now Flex wrap is
06:43 - used along with another property named
06:46 - align content
06:47 - align content
06:50 - if I were to set align content to be
06:53 - Flex
06:54 - start
06:55 - all of that space between the first row
06:57 - and the second is now gone
07:03 - then there's Flex end
07:11 - Center
07:18 - space evenly
07:28 - then space between
07:35 - use any combination of properties that
07:37 - I've demonstrated
07:38 - let's keep Flex wrap as wrap but I'll
07:41 - use flex start
07:44 - you can also add a gap between the rows
07:46 - and the columns between each of these
07:48 - elements
07:50 - let's set a column Gap
07:52 - column Dash Gap to be one em
07:58 - that adds a gap between each of the
08:00 - columns for the rows that would be row
08:03 - Gap
08:04 - I'll set that to be 1em you can also use
08:06 - pixels as well
08:08 - so here's 2 em
08:13 - 3
08:16 - let's delete our Gap properties
08:20 - all right let's also delete the extra
08:22 - four boxes that we have
08:25 - we're also going to get rid of the flex
08:26 - wrapped property
08:28 - as well as align content
08:32 - there's also the Align self property
08:34 - that can be applied to single elements
08:36 - so with box one I will set a line self
08:40 - to be start that's the default
08:44 - this element will be aligned at the top
08:47 - of our container
08:48 - if I were to change line self to be
08:50 - Center this single element is aligned in
08:53 - the center of my container on the cross
08:56 - axis
08:58 - then we have end that will align at the
09:01 - bottom
09:02 - the Align self property can be applied
09:04 - to any of these elements let's do that
09:06 - with number two
09:09 - line Dash self
09:11 - at the start there is no change
09:14 - Center
09:16 - end
09:18 - okay let's delete the Align self
09:20 - property
09:21 - we can use order to change the order of
09:24 - these elements
09:25 - with box one I will set the order to be
09:28 - one that will place number one at the
09:30 - end
09:31 - negative one would be the beginning
09:34 - which it normally is already
09:37 - with box 2 I'll set the order to be one
09:40 - that will place two at the end but if I
09:43 - set it to be negative one it's now at
09:45 - the beginning
09:46 - all right everybody so that is a quick
09:48 - introduction to flexbox there is a lot
09:51 - to talk about and that is all the time
09:52 - that I have for this topic and well
09:54 - that's an introduction to flexbox in CSS
