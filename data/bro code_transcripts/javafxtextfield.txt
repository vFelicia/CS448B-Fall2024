00:00 - yo what's going on everybody it's you
00:02 - bro hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to show you
00:04 - all how we can verify user input using a
00:07 - text field in javafx
00:09 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:14 - let me give you all a tour of my setup
00:16 - here i have a total of four nodes
00:18 - two of which are labels this top label
00:20 - has a fixed id of my label
00:23 - this other label does not have a fixed
00:24 - id it's just going to function as a
00:27 - prompt
00:27 - to let the user know we would like them
00:29 - to enter their age into this text field
00:31 - down below
00:32 - and this text field has an id of my text
00:34 - field
00:35 - and lastly we have a button this button
00:37 - has an id of my button
00:39 - as well as a linked action of submit
00:42 - which we'll define later within our code
00:44 - let's pretend that a user is signing up
00:46 - for a credit card and in order to sign
00:48 - up for a credit card you have to be 18
00:50 - years or older
00:51 - a user is going to enter their edge into
00:53 - this text field and click submit
00:54 - if their age is less than 18 the text
00:58 - for this welcome label will change
01:00 - to something such as you are too young
01:02 - to sign up
01:03 - however if they're 18 years or older
01:05 - that's the minimum criteria
01:07 - so this welcome message the text in this
01:09 - welcome message
01:10 - will change to display you are now
01:13 - signed up
01:14 - so before we begin let's make sure that
01:16 - our controller class is linked
01:18 - we have at least three fixed ids my
01:20 - label
01:21 - my text field my button and your button
01:24 - should have a linked action
01:25 - of submit or some other function that
01:27 - you're going to remember
01:28 - so let's save and head to our ide within
01:31 - your controller class we're going to
01:33 - inject our fxml code into this
01:35 - controller class by adding
01:36 - this annotation for each id that we have
01:39 - at fxml
01:40 - and we had three different nodes with
01:42 - ids we have
01:43 - a label so private label
01:47 - and the idea i gave was my label
01:50 - at fxml
01:54 - private text field
01:58 - my text field
02:01 - and we have a button at fxml private
02:05 - button my button
02:08 - will declare an integer variable named
02:10 - edge but we're not going to assign it a
02:12 - value quite yet we'll do so within
02:14 - our submit method that we'll create so
02:16 - public void
02:18 - submit there is one parameter of action
02:21 - event event and we're going to assign
02:25 - this variable of
02:27 - edge age equals
02:30 - my text field dot get
02:34 - text however
02:37 - this function is going to return a
02:38 - string so we need to cast
02:40 - the string to an integer variable
02:44 - so let's say integer dot parse
02:48 - int and add in our
02:51 - my text field dot get text method that
02:54 - we have
02:55 - so this will assign whatever text is
02:57 - within my text field into this
02:59 - edge variable and just to test this i'm
03:02 - going to print
03:03 - whatever our edges to the console window
03:06 - okay now let's test it so i'm going to
03:08 - refresh my fxml document
03:10 - and then run this program so enter your
03:12 - age let's say that i'm 21
03:14 - then i press submit no problem it
03:16 - displays 21 to the console window
03:18 - but what if i type in something that's
03:20 - not a number such as a name like
03:22 - smitty warbin jaeger man
03:26 - jensen well this is going to interrupt
03:28 - our program so we should probably catch
03:30 - and handle any exceptions when they
03:32 - occur
03:32 - let's place our code within a try block
03:34 - because it would be good practice
03:36 - so try all of this code and we will
03:39 - catch any exceptions as they occur
03:41 - so for the time being we will catch
03:44 - exception e and i will print
03:47 - whatever this exception is to the
03:48 - console window by using a print line
03:50 - statement
03:51 - and i will print whatever e is
03:54 - okay let's try it again and let's see if
03:57 - we can get the name of that exception
03:58 - that occurs
04:01 - enter your age smitty submit
04:05 - okay so we have a number format
04:07 - exception
04:08 - so it's better if we catch that as well
04:10 - specifically
04:11 - so let's add an additional catch block
04:14 - preceding
04:15 - our catch all catch block so catch
04:19 - this right here number format exception
04:23 - number format
04:27 - exception e and we will print a message
04:31 - like enter only
04:35 - numbers please okay let's try it again
04:39 - enter your age smitty submit
04:42 - enter only numbers please and this did
04:44 - not interrupt our program
04:46 - if there's any additional exceptions you
04:48 - would like to catch specifically just be
04:50 - sure to write an additional catch block
04:52 - preceding our catch-all exception e what
04:55 - we'll do at this point is that we'll
04:56 - change
04:57 - the text of our label to reflect what
04:59 - the user typed in
05:00 - let's begin with the catch blocks so
05:02 - let's say if somebody does not type in a
05:05 - number for their edge
05:06 - we'll change our label mylabel dot set
05:10 - text to
05:13 - enter only numbers
05:16 - please and if there's anything else that
05:21 - happens
05:21 - let's change this to maybe just air but
05:24 - remember it's better to
05:25 - catch specific exceptions beforehand
05:28 - okay let's try this again
05:32 - okay enter your age smitty warbin
05:35 - jagerman jensen
05:37 - submit enter only numbers please now if
05:40 - user takes this seriously
05:42 - let's write an if statement to check
05:43 - their age if age
05:45 - is greater than or equal to 18
05:49 - we will change the text of my label
05:52 - to reflect a message such as you
05:56 - are now signed up
06:00 - else let's print
06:05 - you must be 18 plus for 18 years or
06:09 - older
06:10 - and let's try this again okay enter your
06:13 - edge let's say that i'm 21
06:15 - i press submit you are now signed up but
06:17 - what if i'm 12 and i'm trying to sign up
06:19 - for a credit card
06:20 - well you must be 18 years or older 18
06:23 - plus
06:24 - so everybody that's a basic form of
06:27 - validating user input via a text field
06:30 - i will post all of this code to the
06:32 - comments section down below
06:33 - and well yeah that's a basic way to
06:35 - validate user input using a text field
