00:00 - hey how's it going everybody it's you
00:01 - bro hope you're doing well and in
00:03 - today's video I'm going to teach you
00:04 - everything you need to know to get
00:06 - started using mongodb in about an hour
00:08 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - hey if you'd like free stuff you should
00:14 - probably subscribe because I release
00:16 - free courses every once in a while when
00:18 - I feel like it that is all what the heck
00:21 - is mongodb it's a no SQL database
00:24 - management system that can manage a
00:26 - humongous amount of data and it's
00:28 - becoming increasingly popular it's
00:30 - favored by many big tech companies
00:32 - unlike relational database Management
00:35 - Systems mongodb uses a nosql format to
00:39 - store and retrieve data nosql means not
00:42 - only SQL it's where data is stored in
00:45 - various formats besides a traditional
00:47 - SQL table rather than storing our data
00:50 - in rows and columns with the table using
00:52 - SQL we store related data as a single
00:56 - document think of each document as a
00:58 - single row and a table in SQL data in
01:01 - each document is stored as field value
01:03 - pairs similar to a Json format but it's
01:07 - technically bsawn binary JavaScript
01:09 - object notation but it behaves very
01:12 - simple similarly for all intents and
01:13 - purposes the general idea is that data
01:16 - which is frequently accessed together is
01:19 - stored together rather than in Separate
01:21 - Tables because SQL joins quite frankly
01:24 - are a pain in the ass this is how our
01:26 - nosql database is arranged we have a
01:29 - document a document is a group of field
01:32 - value pairs to represent an object a
01:35 - collection is a group of one or more
01:37 - documents and a database is a group of
01:41 - one or more collections this makes
01:43 - working with and scaling our database
01:45 - like really really easy before we do
01:48 - begin there are a few prerequisites for
01:50 - this series we will be working with
01:52 - document objects I would recommend at
01:55 - least some experience with an
01:56 - object-oriented programming language of
01:58 - your choosing it doesn't matter if it's
02:00 - python Java C plus plus C sharp
02:03 - JavaScript doesn't matter just pick one
02:05 - so let's get started I will show you
02:07 - what you need to download
02:08 - all right let's get started everybody
02:10 - here is the installation process for
02:12 - mongodb so go to this website
02:15 - mongodb.com go to resources
02:19 - server
02:21 - on the left sidebar go to installation
02:25 - here's a list of different installation
02:27 - tutorials depending on your operating
02:29 - system I'm running Windows I'll select
02:31 - Windows let's scroll down
02:34 - we're looking for install mongodb
02:37 - Community Edition all you have to do is
02:39 - follow the numbered steps beginning with
02:40 - one we will go to the download Center
02:42 - I'll open this in a new tab because I
02:45 - don't want to close out of this window
02:48 - select the current version
02:51 - select your platform again I'm running
02:53 - Windows
02:54 - and the installation package I'll keep
02:57 - that the same
02:58 - and download
02:59 - pick a place to save the installer to
03:01 - I'll keep it within my documents folder
03:04 - but you choose your own place
03:06 - and I will open this when it's done
03:10 - so we're going to click next
03:12 - up the license agreement next
03:16 - complete install mongod as a service
03:19 - make sure that's checked
03:20 - next
03:22 - also be sure to install the mongodb
03:24 - compass program it's a graphical user
03:26 - interface
03:28 - then give it a couple minutes
03:32 - now that mongodb is installed we can
03:34 - finish this may open compass compass is
03:37 - a graphical user interface for managing
03:39 - our database we'll be using Compass
03:42 - intermittently
03:43 - in fact I recommend creating a desktop
03:45 - shortcut
03:46 - you just have to open it
03:48 - then to establish a connection you hit
03:50 - the green connect button I'll be using
03:52 - Compass intermittently just to show you
03:54 - how everything works let's also install
03:57 - the mongodb shell
03:59 - to install the shell we're going to go
04:00 - to the left sidebar and where is it
04:03 - there mongodb shell also known as
04:06 - mangosh like oh my gosh
04:09 - we are going to go to the download
04:10 - Center
04:13 - select the current version select your
04:15 - platform I'm running Windows
04:17 - and the package will keep that the same
04:19 - and download
04:22 - we'll open this when it's done
04:24 - we will unzip this folder
04:27 - so right click extract all
04:32 - we will need the file pass to the
04:34 - executable let's open this folder
04:37 - go to bin
04:39 - and we can copy this file location let's
04:41 - right click on our executable
04:43 - go to properties
04:45 - copy this file location
04:48 - it should be within the bin folder
04:50 - then we're going to add that file path
04:52 - to our environment variables
04:56 - really we can just search for
04:58 - environment variables
05:01 - we're within system properties go to the
05:04 - advanced tab environment variables
05:07 - underneath system variables let's
05:09 - pretend that this wasn't here
05:11 - click new
05:13 - come up with a variable name sh is
05:16 - good
05:17 - then paste that file location
05:20 - hit okay
05:23 - and close
05:24 - so if we go to that folder
05:27 - and open the executable
05:30 - this is the mongodb shell I'm going to
05:33 - make the font size a little bit bigger
05:38 - to establish a connection to our
05:39 - database type sh
05:43 - and that should establish a connection
05:46 - to clear your screen type CLS
05:49 - to exit type exit
05:52 - personally I don't like using this
05:54 - executable by itself I like using vs
05:57 - code if you would like to use vs code
05:59 - for using the Shell here's how
06:02 - if you would like to use vs code for
06:04 - using the Shell here's how So within vs
06:06 - code we're going to download the mongodb
06:09 - extension so go to extensions
06:11 - search for mongodb
06:14 - it should be this one
06:16 - we will install this extension there
06:19 - should be a new icon for mongodb let's
06:21 - click on it
06:22 - to establish a connection we just have
06:24 - to click on localhost
06:26 - the mongodb connection was successful
06:29 - then to open our terminal right click
06:32 - launch mongodb shell
06:35 - let's minimize this
06:38 - close out of this window pull up this
06:40 - terminal
06:41 - we are utilizing the mongodb Shell with
06:44 - vs code
06:45 - so to exit you type exit
06:48 - to establish a connection you can type
06:49 -  sh
06:52 - to clear your screen you can type CLS
06:54 - and that is everything you need to know
06:56 - to get started
