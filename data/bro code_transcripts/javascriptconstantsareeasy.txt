00:00 - why hello so today I need to explain
00:02 - const const short for constants are
00:05 - variables that can't be changed once you
00:07 - assign them in this example we're going
00:09 - to create a program to calculate the
00:11 - circumference of a circle given a radius
00:14 - let's define our variables first we have
00:16 - Pi we'll begin with using let then I'll
00:18 - show you the benefit of using const so
00:21 - let pi equals I'll use the first few
00:25 - digits of pi
00:28 - 3.14159
00:30 - then we have let radius which we will
00:33 - assign later we'll ask for user input
00:35 - then let
00:38 - circumference I think I spelled that
00:39 - right I can never spell
00:41 - circumference all right now we need to
00:44 - ask the user what the radius is I will
00:46 - just use a window prompt radius equals
00:50 - window.
00:53 - prompt enter the radius of a circle
01:02 - then once we have our radius when we
01:04 - accept user input it's a string data
01:07 - type we need to convert our radius into
01:09 - a number by using the number
01:13 - function then once we have our radius we
01:16 - can calculate the circumference by
01:18 - setting circumference equal to and
01:21 - here's the Formula 2 * pi * our radius
01:25 - that the user enters in then once we
01:27 - have our circumference let's cons
01:30 - log R
01:33 - circumference let's see if this
01:37 - works enter the radius of a circle I'll
01:40 - enter 10 press okay their circumference
01:44 - is
01:45 - 62.8 so why might you want to use a
01:47 - const in this program you may
01:49 - accidentally or somebody else may
01:52 - maliciously change the value of a
01:54 - variable so that the program doesn't
01:56 - behave as intended for example somewhere
01:59 - within my program I will set pi to be a
02:02 - new number pi equal 420.69 let's run
02:07 - this program again enter the radius of a
02:09 - circle I'll enter 10 press okay and my
02:12 - circumference is
02:15 - 8,413 I may not realize that this is the
02:18 - incorrect answer just for an extra
02:21 - security measure I can turn any
02:23 - variables that shouldn't change to be a
02:26 - const a constant replace let with
02:30 - const and it is a good practice if you
02:32 - have any constants to make all of the
02:34 - letters in the variable name uppercase
02:37 - so Pi is now Capital Pi hey this is bro
02:40 - from the future there's one thing I
02:42 - needed to clarify that I forgot to
02:43 - mention capitalizing your constants is
02:46 - usually only done with primitive data
02:48 - types such as numbers and booleans
02:50 - reference data types such as strings
02:52 - don't normally follow this convention
02:54 - you'll see this in the next few upcoming
02:56 - videos Pi is a constant and we're
02:58 - assigning a number that's why I'm making
03:00 - it all uppercase but if this was a
03:01 - string normally we wouldn't that is all
03:04 - let's try and change that variable again
03:07 - pial 420.69
03:11 - so we have an uncaught type error
03:14 - assignment to constant variable so
03:18 - JavaScript won't let us reassign
03:20 - constants once they are assigned once we
03:23 - can't make any changes to it once you
03:25 - declare a constant you can't change the
03:27 - value and that's pretty helpful in a lot
03:29 - of circumstance stances it's an extra
03:31 - security measure what we'll do this time
03:33 - is within our web page we will accept
03:35 - some user input via a text boox we'll
03:38 - rewrite the same
03:40 - program let's create an H1
03:42 - element I will set the ID of the H1
03:46 - element to be my
03:48 - H1 and the text will be enter the radius
03:53 - of a
03:57 - circle I'll create a text box
04:00 - input I'll set the type equal to text
04:04 - the ID equal to my
04:09 - text I'll create a label for this input
04:12 - text
04:17 - box let's say
04:21 - radius I'll add a
04:26 - button the button will say submit
04:31 - the ID will be my
04:34 - submit then I'll add two
04:37 - breaks right after the text box to make
04:39 - it look
04:41 - nice let's get rid of
04:44 - console.log when we click on the submit
04:46 - button we will execute a function we
04:49 - need to select the
04:50 - button let's take our document get
04:55 - element by
04:57 - ID the ID is is my
05:02 - submit follow this with DOT
05:06 - onclick
05:08 - equals a function parenthesis curly
05:11 - braces when we click on the button we'll
05:14 - execute any code within the curly braces
05:17 - we can eliminate our window
05:20 - prompt we need to get the value from the
05:22 - text box again we can use document.
05:25 - getet element by ID but the ID is going
05:29 - to be my text the text from the text
05:32 - box dot value get the value from the
05:36 - text box and we will assign that to
05:41 - radius then we will typ cast our input
05:44 - as a
05:48 - number then we will calculate the
05:52 - circumference but since Pi is a constant
05:55 - make sure that the letters are uppercase
05:57 - uppercase pi
06:00 - once we have our circumference let's
06:01 - change an H3 element so let's add that
06:04 - as
06:05 - well
06:07 - H3 the ID will be my H3 there will be no
06:13 - text
06:14 - content then again we will get element
06:17 - by
06:18 - ID the ID will be my
06:22 - H3 change the text content of this
06:26 - element to equal our circumference
06:32 - okay let's try this the radius is 10
06:34 - press submit and here is our
06:37 - circumference maybe this will be in
06:40 - centimeters so let me change that I'll
06:43 - use string concatenation and just add
06:45 - plus
06:47 - CM so 10 submit 62.83 CM if I attempt to
06:54 - change the value of
06:56 - pi maybe I'll do that here pi = 420.69
07:02 - rerun the program 10 submit there
07:06 - doesn't appear to be a result so if we
07:09 - go to Dev tools go to console we have
07:12 - that uncaught type error assignment to
07:15 - constant variable so again we can't
07:17 - change the value of a constant there are
07:20 - more graceful ways of handling this
07:22 - we'll learn about that when we get to
07:24 - exception handling however this is what
07:26 - we wanted we do not want to be able to
07:28 - change the value of a constant all right
07:30 - everybody so those are constants it's
07:32 - just a variable that can't be changed
07:34 - once you assign it a value and well
07:36 - those are constants in
07:40 - JavaScript
