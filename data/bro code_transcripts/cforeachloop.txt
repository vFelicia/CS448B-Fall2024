00:00 - oh yeah all right everybody
00:03 - for each loops a for each loop is a
00:06 - simpler and more elegant way
00:08 - to iterate over an array however it's
00:11 - less flexible compared to a standard for
00:13 - loop
00:14 - i have an array of names of vehicles
00:16 - named cars we have a bmw
00:18 - mustang and corvette then we can use a
00:21 - standard for loop to iterate and display
00:23 - the elements of this array so this works
00:26 - fine
00:27 - however it's a lot of work to write all
00:28 - of this another approach
00:30 - although it's less flexible is to create
00:32 - a for each loop
00:34 - this will iterate once for each element
00:36 - within my array
00:37 - so type for each parenthesis curly
00:39 - braces
00:40 - and within the parenthesis we list the
00:42 - data type of each element
00:44 - then we need a name for each element
00:46 - that we're working with
00:47 - since we're working with cars let's call
00:49 - each element a car
00:51 - string car in the name of the array
00:54 - cars string car in cars then i will with
00:58 - the right line statement
00:59 - display whatever car is so this is kind
01:02 - of like a nickname for the element that
01:04 - we're currently working with
01:05 - so let's get rid of this for loop
01:07 - because we don't need it anymore
01:09 - and use our for each loop instead
01:13 - and this works the same as before one
01:16 - downside with a for each loop is that
01:18 - it's not flexible with a standard for
01:20 - loop we can iterate forwards
01:22 - backwards or even skip iterations so use
01:25 - whatever loop is more appropriate for
01:27 - your situation
01:28 - well everybody that is a for each loop
01:31 - it's a simpler and more elegant way to
01:34 - iterate over an array
01:35 - however it's not as flexible if you just
01:37 - need something simple to display the
01:39 - elements of an array you can easily use
01:41 - a for each loop
01:42 - alright everybody so that's a for each
01:44 - loop if you can give this video a thumbs
01:46 - up drop a random comment down below
01:48 - and well those are four each loops in c
01:50 - sharp
