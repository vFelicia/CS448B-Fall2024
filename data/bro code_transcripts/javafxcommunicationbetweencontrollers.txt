00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:01 - bro hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to show you
00:04 - all how we can send data between
00:06 - controllers
00:07 - in javafx so sit back relax
00:10 - and enjoy the show
00:14 - if you find this video helpful please
00:15 - remember to like comment
00:17 - and subscribe your support will help
00:19 - keep this channel running
00:21 - all right ladies and gentlemen let me
00:22 - give you a tour of what i've set up
00:24 - currently i have my main java file
00:26 - i have two fxml files named scene 1 and
00:30 - scene 2.
00:31 - i have a controller dedicated to each
00:34 - scene
00:34 - i have a scene 1 controller and a scene
00:37 - 2 controller
00:38 - what this program does currently is that
00:40 - i have
00:42 - a label a text box and a button what i
00:45 - would like to do is
00:46 - type in my username and then submit it
00:49 - and pass
00:49 - this information along to the next scene
00:52 - and display
00:53 - hello plus whatever your username is
00:55 - kind of like a welcome screen
00:57 - so here's how we can do that oh and i
00:59 - forgot to mention
01:00 - the name of this text field that i have
01:02 - set has an id
01:03 - of name text field but you can change it
01:05 - to whatever you like
01:06 - and this button to change scenes has an
01:08 - id
01:09 - of login button and it's linked to an
01:11 - action of
01:12 - login so when i click this button it
01:14 - will call the login method within my
01:17 - scene 1 controller and within scene 2 i
01:19 - have a
01:20 - single label with an id of name label
01:23 - but
01:23 - like i said before you can name these
01:25 - whatever you want within my scene 1
01:27 - controller i'm reusing some code from
01:29 - the last video on switching scenes
01:31 - except i have a method that is named
01:34 - login
01:34 - when i click that login button we will
01:36 - call this login method
01:38 - however we actually do not need this
01:40 - line of code
01:41 - let's switch to the scene 2 controller
01:43 - there's just a few things that we need
01:44 - to fill in within this class
01:46 - so let's create a label that is named
01:49 - name label
01:50 - whatever you called your label within
01:53 - cn2
01:54 - name label and i will inject my
01:57 - fxml document by adding that annotation
02:00 - so let's get these imports i'm missing a
02:04 - semicolon
02:06 - and there will be one method set within
02:09 - this class
02:11 - and let's call it display name this will
02:13 - be a public
02:15 - method named display
02:18 - name that will accept one argument
02:22 - string username
02:26 - and when we call this method we'll take
02:28 - our name label
02:31 - set the text equal to
02:35 - i'll say hello plus
02:38 - user name and that is it for this class
02:42 - for the scene 2 controller we'll be
02:45 - handling everything else within our
02:46 - scene 1 controller
02:48 - so let's head back to our scene one
02:49 - controller and we'll need to declare a
02:52 - few things within this class
02:54 - so at the top let's declare the name
02:57 - text field of scene one
02:59 - uh so that would be this that's that
03:01 - text box so within scene 1
03:06 - let's declare a text field
03:11 - and we will inject our fxml
03:17 - now when we click on that login button
03:19 - to call the login method
03:20 - the first thing that we should do before
03:22 - we switch scenes is to get the text
03:24 - found within the name
03:25 - text field so we would like to extract
03:28 - that
03:29 - so i will declare a string and we will
03:31 - call this username
03:33 - string username equals name
03:36 - text field dot get
03:40 - text so this will store
03:43 - the text found within our text field
03:45 - into a string
03:46 - variable that we can reuse now the
03:49 - second step is that we're going to
03:51 - create an
03:52 - fxml loader instance so let's declare
03:55 - fxml loader and i will call this loader
04:01 - equals new fxml
04:05 - loader then within a set of parenthesis
04:10 - get class
04:14 - get resource and the resource name
04:17 - will be scene2.fxml
04:29 - looks good okay and the next line here
04:33 - we'll set our root node equal to
04:36 - loader dot and use the load method
04:42 - lastly there's just two more lines we're
04:44 - going to create an instance of our scene
04:46 - 2 controller scene
04:49 - 2 controller
04:53 - and i will name this instance scene
04:56 - to controller
05:00 - equals loader dot
05:03 - get controller
05:10 - okay and the last thing that we need to
05:12 - do since we're creating
05:13 - an instance of our scene 2 controller we
05:16 - have access to any methods within this
05:18 - class
05:19 - so all we need to do is to call this
05:20 - display name method
05:23 - so let's type the name of our instance
05:25 - and use the
05:26 - display name method and we will pass in
05:29 - our username as an argument
05:32 - and then when we call that method all
05:33 - we're doing is setting the text equal to
05:36 - the username that is passed in
05:38 - so this should work now let's verify
05:40 - that
05:44 - all right enter your username i'm just
05:46 - going to say bro
05:47 - and click login hello bro
05:50 - well everyone that's how to pass some
05:52 - information between controllers
05:54 - basically what we did is that we created
05:56 - an fxml
05:57 - loader instance and we set the resource
06:00 - equal
06:00 - to our intended scene that we would like
06:02 - to pass information to
06:04 - and then we created an instance of our
06:07 - scene 2 controller
06:08 - within our scene 1 controller we used
06:11 - one of the methods
06:12 - found within our scene 2 controller and
06:15 - lastly we changed the scene from scene 1
06:17 - to scene 2
06:19 - via these lines from the previous video
06:21 - on switching scenes
06:22 - so that's how to send data between
06:24 - controllers if you would like a copy of
06:26 - all this code i will post all of this
06:28 - code to the comments section down below
06:30 - but yeah that's how to send data between
06:33 - controllers and
06:34 - javafx hey you
06:38 - yeah i'm talking to you if you learned
06:39 - something new then help me
06:41 - help you in three easy steps by smashing
