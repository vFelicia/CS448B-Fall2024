00:00 - how's it going everybody it's you bro
00:01 - hope you're doing well and in this video
00:03 - i'm going to teach you guys about the
00:04 - final keyword in java so
00:06 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - make sure you like comment and subscribe
00:14 - one like equals one prayer for the
00:16 - youtube algorithm
00:18 - okay ladies and gentlemen i'm going to
00:20 - be teaching you guys about the
00:22 - final keyword anything that is declared
00:24 - as final cannot be changed or updated
00:26 - later in your program here's an example
00:29 - let's say we have a
00:30 - double variable called pi and we will
00:33 - store the first few digits of pi
00:37 - 3.14159 there's still more digits than
00:39 - that but that's good enough for this
00:41 - example
00:42 - and let's update the value of pi to
00:44 - maybe four
00:46 - and then within a print line statement
00:47 - let's print the value
00:49 - of pi so this will display four because
00:52 - we updated
00:53 - our variable pi to equal four so if we
00:56 - were to use the
00:57 - final keyword when we declare our
00:59 - variable we're going to precede
01:01 - our data type with the keyword final and
01:04 - we can no longer update this value and
01:06 - it states
01:07 - the final local variable pi cannot be
01:10 - assigned
01:11 - it must be blank and not using a
01:13 - compound assignment
01:14 - so we can no longer change the value of
01:17 - pi we're going to run into a problem
01:19 - and it states here that we ran into an
01:22 - unresolved compilation problem
01:24 - so if you declare anything as final you
01:26 - cannot update it
01:27 - it is final that's the law you can't
01:29 - update it and
01:30 - one common practice that people will do
01:33 - when they declare something is final is
01:34 - that with the variable name
01:36 - they will make all the letters uppercase
01:38 - it's not necessary that's just common
01:40 - practice
01:40 - and when we run this program it displays
01:43 - our number pi
01:44 - of 3.14159 so really that's the basics
01:47 - of the final keyword anything that is
01:49 - final cannot be changed once you declare
01:51 - it
01:52 - if you would like a copy of this code i
01:53 - will post this in the comments down
01:55 - below
01:55 - but yeah that's how the final keyword
01:57 - works in java
01:59 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
02:02 - learn something new
