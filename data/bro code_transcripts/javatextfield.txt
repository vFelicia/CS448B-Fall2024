00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well and in
00:03 - this video i'm going to teach you guys
00:04 - how we can create a text field in java
00:06 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:12 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:16 - help keep this channel running
00:18 - okay everybody we're going to be
00:20 - creating a j
00:21 - text field this is a gui text box
00:24 - component that can be used to add
00:26 - set or get some text so imagine you're
00:29 - logging into
00:30 - a website and you type in your username
00:32 - and password well those boxes are
00:34 - perfect examples of text boxes
00:37 - we're also going to create a submit
00:38 - button so that when we enter in a
00:40 - username
00:40 - we can submit whatever text we enter in
00:43 - but
00:44 - we're going to implement an action
00:45 - listener so it's best if we create a new
00:48 - class to do this
00:49 - so within my source folder i'm going to
00:51 - go to file
00:52 - new class and i will call this class
00:55 - my frame my frame will extends
00:59 - jframe so it's going to behave exactly
01:02 - as a jframe
01:03 - this will also implements the action
01:06 - listener interface so that this frame
01:09 - can listen for events
01:10 - like a button click when we want to
01:12 - submit a username
01:14 - so make sure to add all of these imports
01:17 - and since we're implementing an
01:19 - interface we need to add any
01:21 - unimplemented methods so make sure to
01:23 - add public void action performed we're
01:26 - also going to create a constructor for
01:27 - this class so
01:28 - my frame and we have to go through the
01:32 - motions of setting up
01:33 - a frame i just i'm going to copy and
01:36 - paste this
01:36 - so you just type in this dot set default
01:39 - closed operation
01:40 - j frame exit on close we're going to use
01:42 - a
01:43 - flow layout for this example so make
01:45 - sure you use a flow layout
01:46 - you can also set this to null if you
01:48 - want but you have to manually place your
01:50 - components
01:50 - we're going to pack this frame so that
01:52 - the size of the frame
01:54 - will adjust to fit the components that
01:56 - you add and then finish this up with
01:58 - this dot set visible true and then we
02:01 - have to create an instance of
02:02 - this frame so we'll say my frame
02:05 - frame equals new my
02:09 - frame let's head back to our my frame
02:12 - class and we're going to create a
02:14 - j text field so j
02:17 - text field we'll call this text field
02:22 - equals new j text field
02:27 - and we'll need an import for this import
02:30 - j text field
02:31 - and let's set some dimensions for this
02:33 - text field so text field
02:36 - dot set preferred size
02:39 - and we'll pass in a new dimension
02:43 - let's say 250 by 40 so 250 for the width
02:47 - and 40 for the height and we'll need an
02:49 - import for dimension
02:51 - now we need to add this text field to
02:53 - our frame
02:54 - so make sure you add this before you
02:56 - actually pack the frame
02:58 - so this dot add
03:01 - we're adding our text field
03:05 - and we should have a text field now
03:07 - within our frame
03:09 - which we do and we can
03:12 - type in text like this
03:18 - if we want to submit some text we'll
03:19 - probably want a button so let's create a
03:21 - button to the left hand side of this
03:23 - text field
03:25 - so j button we'll call this button
03:28 - equals new
03:29 - j button and we can set some text right
03:33 - away too
03:34 - let's say submit
03:39 - and we're going to add this button to
03:41 - our frame so
03:42 - this dot add button
03:49 - now you notice we have a submit button
03:51 - but it currently doesn't do anything
03:53 - so we need to add an action listener
03:56 - so let's do that here
03:59 - button dot add action
04:02 - listener since this class is
04:05 - implementing an action listener
04:06 - interface
04:07 - we can simply just pass in this
04:10 - and when this frame detects an event
04:14 - we can check to see if that event is the
04:16 - button so if
04:17 - e dot get source is equal to
04:21 - our button we're going to do something
04:23 - we're going to take our text field
04:27 - dot get text
04:31 - okay but let's take a look at this our
04:34 - button
04:35 - and our text field are not recognized
04:37 - that's because
04:38 - we declared our button and text field
04:40 - within the constructor
04:42 - so they're only local to the constructor
04:44 - we need to declare these outside of the
04:46 - constructor so that they're global
04:48 - so we'll copy this and paste it
04:52 - j button button that's all we need as
04:54 - well as
04:55 - j text field text field so here we're
04:58 - declaring this twice we don't need to do
04:59 - that
05:00 - since we declared these components
05:02 - outside of the constructor
05:03 - they are now global so that this action
05:06 - performed method
05:07 - now has access to them so make sure to
05:09 - take out
05:10 - j button for the button and j text field
05:12 - for the text field
05:15 - and now these should be recognized all
05:17 - right so we're going to
05:18 - use this method get text to retrieve
05:21 - whatever text
05:21 - is within our text box our text field so
05:24 - let's
05:25 - print out a message i'm going to
05:26 - surround this with a print line
05:28 - statement
05:29 - so we could say maybe
05:33 - welcome plus whatever
05:36 - [Music]
05:37 - the text is that somebody types in let's
05:39 - try this
05:43 - so let's say we enter in our username
05:46 - bro code and click submit it says
05:49 - welcome bro code
05:51 - let's customize the appearance of this
05:52 - text field well because we can
05:54 - so let's begin by changing the font so
05:57 - text field
05:58 - dot set font and we can pass in
06:01 - a new font and pick whatever font you
06:06 - want i will pick
06:07 - consoles and then
06:11 - we can say font.plain or bold or italic
06:16 - and then we can also pick a font size so
06:18 - i will pick
06:20 - 35 35's a good number and let's take a
06:23 - look
06:27 - that's pretty sweet let's change the
06:29 - font color so
06:30 - we do that with set foreground
06:33 - text field dot set
06:36 - foreground and we can pass in a color
06:40 - like color dot green or we can pass
06:44 - in some rgb values or a hex value
06:48 - so we can do that with new color and i'm
06:50 - just going to use a hex value this time
06:52 - you can look these up online
06:54 - that is for green 0x 0 0
06:58 - ff00 so this is a bright green color
07:06 - sweet let's change the background color
07:09 - so text field dot set
07:13 - background and we can pass in
07:16 - like a preset color or a new color i'm
07:18 - just going to turn this to black so
07:20 - color dot
07:21 - black
07:25 - and now we have a black j text field but
07:30 - you can see that the carrot that's that
07:31 - line that is blinking it's a little
07:33 - difficult to see we can actually change
07:35 - the color of that as well
07:36 - so text field dot set
07:40 - carrot well set carrot color then we can
07:44 - pass in a color
07:45 - so i will pick color dot white
07:51 - and this carrot this line when you type
07:54 - in something
07:55 - is now visible let's set the text of our
07:57 - text field so
07:58 - text field dot
08:01 - set text and we pass in a string
08:06 - we can place the string username here so
08:08 - that somebody knows to type in their
08:10 - username
08:13 - so it just says username but you can
08:15 - edit this and type in whatever you want
08:17 - hacker123 if for some reason you need to
08:21 - prevent somebody from editing
08:23 - this text field you can do so with the
08:25 - set editable
08:26 - method so we type in the name of the
08:28 - text field
08:30 - dot set editable and we can set this to
08:33 - pulse so that when set editable
08:37 - is set to false we can no longer edit
08:40 - this text field even though i'm trying
08:42 - really hard to do so
08:43 - here's an idea what if we disabled the
08:45 - text field as well as this button after
08:47 - we submit a username
08:49 - so within this action performed method
08:51 - we're going to
08:52 - get rid of this line textfield.set
08:54 - editable false
08:56 - place this within our actionperformed
08:57 - method and let's also disable that
09:00 - button as well so button.set
09:03 - enabled and we'll set this to false
09:07 - so that after we submit a username
09:11 - like hacker123 and click submit we can
09:13 - no longer submit
09:14 - another username so that's an option
09:17 - that's also available to you
09:19 - so yeah that's the basics of creating j
09:21 - text fields in java if you want a copy
09:24 - of all this code
09:24 - i'll post all of this in the comments
09:26 - down below but yeah that's the basics of
09:28 - creating a j
09:29 - text field in java hey you
09:32 - yeah i'm talking to you if you learn
09:34 - something new then
09:36 - you can help me help you in three easy
09:39 - steps
09:39 - by smashing that like button drop a
