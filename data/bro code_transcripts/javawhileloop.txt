00:00 - hey how's it going everybody it's your
00:01 - bro hope you're doing well and in this
00:02 - video i'm going to teach you guys about
00:04 - while loops in java so sit back relax
00:07 - and enjoy the show
00:11 - make sure you like comment and subscribe
00:14 - one like equals one prayer for the
00:16 - youtube algorithm
00:18 - all right guys and gals let's talk about
00:20 - while loops a while loop
00:21 - executes a block of code as long as its
00:24 - condition
00:25 - remains true it's like an if statement
00:28 - but it will continue
00:29 - that block of code continuously as long
00:32 - as its condition
00:33 - remains true here's an example let's
00:35 - create a program that will ask somebody
00:37 - for their name
00:38 - if they attempt to not type in anything
00:41 - well we'll keep on prompting the user to
00:43 - type
00:44 - in their name the only way for them to
00:45 - escape the while loop is to type in
00:47 - something
00:48 - aka their name so let's create a scanner
00:51 - scanner
00:52 - scanner equals new scanner within the
00:54 - parenthesis
00:55 - system dot in we'll need an import so be
00:58 - sure to include that at the top
01:00 - import java.util.scanner we'll need a
01:03 - name variable
01:04 - string name equals and we'll just set
01:06 - this to a pair of
01:08 - quotes for now this is how to create a
01:10 - while loop type while
01:12 - then you need a set of parentheses and
01:14 - then a set of curly braces
01:16 - it's kind of like an if statement we'll
01:18 - put our condition within the parentheses
01:20 - if this statement this condition remains
01:22 - true
01:23 - then we will execute this block of code
01:25 - continuously until our condition is no
01:28 - longer true
01:28 - until it evaluates as false this is our
01:31 - condition
01:32 - name dot is blank if somebody attempts
01:36 - to skip the process of entering their
01:38 - name
01:39 - it will keep on prompting the user to
01:42 - type in a name
01:43 - so let's create a print line statement
01:45 - actually i'm going to change this to a
01:46 - print statement
01:48 - enter your name
01:52 - and we will store the result within our
01:55 - name
01:55 - variable name equals scanner dot
01:59 - next line and
02:02 - when we escape the while loop we will
02:04 - display a welcome message
02:08 - hello class name all right
02:12 - that is it let's try this
02:15 - our program states enter your name i'm
02:17 - not going to type in anything i'm just
02:18 - going to hit
02:19 - enter so you can see it keeps on
02:21 - prompting me to enter my name
02:23 - enter your name no enter your name no
02:25 - this time i'm going to type in my name
02:27 - because i give up
02:28 - empty your name bro therefore our
02:31 - condition
02:32 - is now false because our name is no
02:34 - longer blank and we have exited the
02:36 - while loop and continued on with the
02:38 - rest of our code
02:39 - there is a variation of the while loop
02:41 - it's called a do loop
02:42 - and how we write this is that we move
02:45 - the condition to the
02:46 - end of the block of code and preceding
02:49 - this block of code
02:50 - we write the word do so what makes this
02:54 - different
02:54 - is that with the do loop we will always
02:57 - perform
02:57 - our block of code at least once and then
03:00 - we check the condition after so this
03:03 - will work
03:04 - much the same however we're always
03:06 - performing this block of code
03:08 - at least once so the do loop is a
03:10 - variation of the while loop but it works
03:12 - very similar it always executes the
03:15 - block of code once
03:16 - compared to the while loop it will first
03:19 - check the condition
03:20 - and then execute the block of code if
03:22 - this is true
03:23 - so everybody that is the while loop if
03:25 - you would like a copy of this code
03:27 - i will post this in the comments down
03:29 - below also be sure to smash that like
03:31 - button drop a comment down below
03:33 - and subscribe if you'd like to become a
03:35 - fellow bro
