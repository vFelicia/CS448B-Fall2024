00:02 - hey everybody in this video i'm going to
00:03 - explain while loops a while loop is much
00:06 - like an if statement except we can
00:08 - repeat some code potentially an infinite
00:11 - amount of times here's an example of
00:13 - where a while loop would be useful let's
00:15 - say that we'll have a user enter in
00:16 - their name
00:18 - standard
00:19 - string
00:20 - name
00:21 - at first i'll use an if statement
00:24 - if
00:25 - name i'll check to see if the name is
00:27 - empty did the user actually type in
00:29 - something
00:31 - if name is empty we'll create a prompt
00:35 - standard output
00:38 - enter your name
00:43 - standard
00:44 - getline
00:47 - standard
00:48 - input
00:50 - name
00:52 - once we exit the if statement
00:54 - we'll display a message involving the
00:56 - user's name standard output
01:00 - hello
01:02 - name
01:04 - and to your name i'm just going to hit
01:06 - enter and not enter in anything
01:08 - hello
01:09 - and i don't have a name
01:11 - what if we need to force the user to do
01:13 - something in order to continue with the
01:15 - rest of the program well we could change
01:17 - this if statement to a while loop
01:22 - if this condition remains true we will
01:25 - execute this code a potentially infinite
01:29 - amount of times once we reach the end of
01:31 - this code block we check the condition
01:33 - again if it's still true we repeat the
01:36 - code again
01:37 - enter your name i'm going to hit enter
01:40 - enter your name no enter your name no
01:42 - enter your name no so i can't actually
01:44 - continue with the rest of my program
01:46 - until i type in something i'll type in
01:48 - my full name
01:50 - hit enter
01:51 - hello whatever your name is
01:53 - basically speaking a while loop is kind
01:55 - of like an if statement except it can
01:58 - repeat some code infinitely as long as
02:00 - this condition remains true we check
02:02 - this condition once when we enter the
02:04 - while loop then any time we finish the
02:06 - while loop we check the condition again
02:08 - if the condition is false we exit then
02:10 - continue on with the rest of the program
02:12 - you do want some way to exit the while
02:14 - loop let's write a condition that we
02:16 - won't be able to change at all
02:18 - while one is equal to one there's no way
02:21 - we can escape this while loop so this is
02:23 - what's known as an infinite loop i'll
02:25 - display a message
02:27 - help
02:29 - i'm stuck
02:31 - in an
02:32 - infinite
02:34 - loop then when i run this
02:37 - yeah we're stuck in an infinite loop and
02:38 - we can't actually move on or do anything
02:41 - so yeah that's basically a while loop
02:43 - everybody while some condition that you
02:45 - set remains true
02:47 - you will continue to execute some code a
02:50 - great use of a while loop is that you
02:52 - can force a user to do something in
02:54 - order to continue with the rest of the
02:56 - code your assignment is to use a while
02:58 - loop then post it in the comment section
03:00 - down below and well yeah those are while
03:03 - loops in c plus plus
