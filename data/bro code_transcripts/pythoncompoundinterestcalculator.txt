00:00 - why hello everybody in today's video
00:01 - we'll be creating a compound interest
00:03 - calculator in Python for those that
00:06 - don't know interest is a charge for the
00:08 - privilege of borrowing money to some
00:10 - individual or organization when you
00:12 - place money in a bank account you
00:14 - typically accrue interest we'll create a
00:16 - program to tell you what your new
00:18 - balance will be after accruing interest
00:20 - for so many years but the user is going
00:22 - to decide the initial principle that's
00:24 - the investment the rate of interest and
00:27 - the time in years that this balance has
00:29 - been accruing interest so let's begin
00:31 - let's declare three variables a
00:33 - principle a rate that is rate of
00:36 - interest and time time will be in years
00:39 - we've recently learned about while Loops
00:41 - I would like to include those within
00:43 - this program just so we get the hang of
00:44 - using them we will ask the user to type
00:46 - in an initial principal investment we
00:49 - will continue to prompt the user to type
00:51 - in a principle that's above zero our
00:54 - condition will be while principal is
00:57 - less than or equal to zero
01:00 - we will take our principal
01:02 - assign it some user input
01:05 - enter the principal amount
01:11 - then we would like to type cast our
01:13 - input as a floating Point number
01:17 - if our user input principle is less than
01:21 - or equal to zero we need to inform the
01:24 - user
01:27 - principal
01:28 - can't be less than or equal to zero
01:37 - so I'm going to test my program by
01:39 - printing the principle at the end just
01:41 - temporarily
01:43 - enter the principal amount I can't type
01:46 - A negative number and continue what if
01:48 - my investment was negative one thousand
01:50 - dollars principal can't be less than or
01:53 - equal to zero how about zero nope can't
01:56 - do that either is a thousand okay
01:58 - yep a thousand works that is for the
02:01 - principal
02:02 - let's copy this while loop paste it
02:05 - replace principal with rate this is the
02:08 - rate of interest
02:10 - enter the
02:12 - interest rate
02:15 - interest rate
02:17 - can't be less than or equal to zero
02:21 - and let's copy this again paste it
02:24 - change rate to time
02:31 - let's type cast our input as an integer
02:33 - because we're working with whole years
02:35 - enter the time in years
02:41 - time can be less than or equal to zero
02:45 - I'm going to print my principal rate and
02:50 - time
02:52 - we have principal
02:55 - rate
02:56 - time
02:59 - okay we know that principle works
03:03 - enter the interest rate can my interest
03:04 - rate be negative one no it can't can it
03:07 - be zero nope how about 10 10 percent
03:11 - all right that works
03:13 - time can time be zero no it can't can my
03:16 - time be negative one no it can't
03:18 - what about three years
03:21 - all right so we know that our while
03:22 - Loops are working now here's the formula
03:25 - to calculate interest
03:27 - let's say our total
03:29 - that's our total balance equals our
03:33 - principal
03:34 - times
03:36 - 1 plus our rate divided by 100
03:40 - I'm going to enclose this function with
03:42 - the set of parentheses
03:44 - this portion of our function will take
03:46 - our interest rate which is a whole
03:48 - number then create a decimal enclose
03:50 - this function within the power function
03:54 - raise this function to the power of time
03:58 - and that is how to calculate compound
03:59 - interest
04:01 - then we will print the new balance
04:04 - I'll use an F string
04:07 - balance after our variable time
04:12 - the word years
04:15 - I'll add a placeholder we will add our
04:17 - total
04:19 - then I'll include a dollar sign maybe
04:22 - this will be in dollars but pick any
04:23 - unit of currency you would like I will
04:25 - format this variable with the format
04:27 - specifier we will display two decimal
04:30 - places point to f
04:33 - okay let's try this
04:34 - enter the principal amount I invest one
04:37 - thousand dollars into maybe the stock
04:39 - market
04:41 - the interest rate is maybe ten percent
04:43 - this year the time in years will be one
04:47 - so after one year at 10 interest my new
04:51 - balance is one thousand one hundred
04:53 - dollars let's try it one more time for
04:55 - good measure maybe five hundred dollars
04:57 - with an interest rate of seven over two
04:59 - years your new balance would be five
05:02 - hundred seventy two dollars and forty
05:03 - five cents
05:05 - all right now there is another way of
05:06 - writing this program
05:08 - what if we would like to allow the user
05:10 - to enter in values that are equal to
05:12 - zero while principal is less than zero
05:16 - if principal is less than zero principal
05:19 - can't be less than zero
05:23 - let's do that for rate
05:26 - interest can't be less than zero
05:31 - time
05:33 - time can't be less than zero
05:36 - here's what happens to our program
05:37 - remember that we're declaring our
05:39 - variables at the top
05:41 - uh nothing happens we go straight to the
05:44 - results
05:45 - so the reason that this is happening is
05:47 - that when we reach the while Loops this
05:50 - condition is false from the beginning we
05:52 - never end up entering these while Loops
05:54 - we skip over them because these three
05:56 - conditions are all false we can write a
06:00 - different variation of this while loop
06:01 - where we could say while true
06:05 - true is a Boolean that means this while
06:07 - loop will continue forever unless we
06:10 - explicitly break out of the while loop
06:12 - we're going to add an else clause
06:15 - else we will break break will break out
06:19 - of a loop
06:21 - with our second while loop change rate
06:24 - is less than zero two while true
06:26 - then we will add an else clause
06:29 - else else break out of the loop
06:32 - while true
06:36 - else
06:38 - break out of the loop
06:40 - we should be able to enter zero values
06:42 - in now
06:44 - enter the principal amount zero zero
06:47 - zero balance after zero years is zero
06:50 - dollars
06:52 - this should work the same as before but
06:54 - we should be allowed to enter in zero
06:56 - values
06:57 - one thousand dollars
06:59 - interest rate of zero after one year is
07:02 - still one thousand dollars
07:05 - well okay then everybody I thought that
07:06 - would be an interesting project to
07:08 - create now that we know how while loops
07:10 - work you could write either a standard
07:11 - while loop with a condition such as
07:14 - principal is less than or equal to zero
07:17 - or you could say while true this Loop
07:20 - would continue forever you would need to
07:22 - explicitly break out of the while loop
07:24 - using this break keyword which we'll
07:26 - cover again in four Loops but yeah that
07:29 - is a compound interest calculator in
07:31 - Python
