00:00 - what's up everybody so in today's video
00:02 - I got to explain the concept of method
00:04 - chaining in JavaScript method chaining
00:07 - is a programming technique it's where
00:08 - you call one method after another in one
00:11 - continuous line of code I'll give you
00:13 - two examples of the same program one
00:15 - that uses no method chaining and another
00:17 - that does then we'll be able to see some
00:19 - of the benefits of method chaining what
00:21 - we'll do in the first version of this
00:23 - program is create a variable for a
00:25 - username and I will ask the user for
00:27 - some input using window
00:30 - prompt the text will be enter your
00:36 - username after typing in some
00:39 - username I would like to trim any white
00:42 - space around the username take the first
00:44 - character make it upper case take all of
00:47 - the other characters make them all
00:49 - lowercase and then display the output so
00:52 - this program will have a few steps let's
00:54 - reassign our username equal to
00:58 - username use the trim method to remove
01:00 - any Whit space before or after the name
01:03 - then I will get the first character of
01:05 - my username to capitalize it we'll
01:07 - create a variable of let letter equals
01:12 - our username follow this with the Char
01:16 - at method the character at index0 letter
01:20 - is going to be a variable it will hold
01:22 - the first letter of my username to make
01:24 - my letter uppercase I will reassign it
01:26 - letter equals letter use the to
01:31 - uppercase method to make that letter
01:34 - uppercase now with the rest of the
01:36 - characters I would like to make them
01:38 - lowercase anything besides the first
01:40 - character I will create a separate
01:42 - variable for extra characters let's say
01:45 - extra chars short for characters equals
01:49 - take our original
01:51 - username use the slice method we will
01:54 - slice our username everything after the
01:56 - first character if my name was bro code
01:59 - and I cre created a slice of everything
02:00 - but the first character extra characters
02:03 - would be row code without the B so then
02:06 - let's take our extra characters make
02:08 - them all lowercase extra characters
02:10 - equals extra characters followed with
02:13 - the two lowercase
02:15 - method then we will combine the first
02:17 - letter which is uppercase and the extra
02:20 - characters which are lowercase then
02:22 - store them within our username username
02:25 - equals our
02:27 - letter plus the extra character
02:31 - then we will display our
02:32 - username
02:34 - console.log our
02:36 - username so this program does have a lot
02:39 - of steps we will run this program enter
02:42 - your
02:43 - username I will enter a few Whit spaces
02:46 - type in my name but I'll mix up the
02:52 - capitalization press okay and there's my
02:55 - username the first letter is uppercase
02:58 - the rest of the letters are lower case
03:00 - so this program does work but it is a
03:02 - lot to write now with method chaining we
03:05 - can combine some of these steps together
03:07 - and avoid creating variables that we
03:09 - don't need such as letter and extra
03:12 - characters so with method training what
03:14 - we'll
03:15 - do is start to combine some of these
03:17 - steps after getting our username we will
03:20 - take our username equals take our
03:23 - username again use the trim method we're
03:26 - not going to end this method with a
03:27 - semicolon we're going to end it with a
03:29 - DOT write another method after trimming
03:31 - the username get the character at index
03:34 - zero and then why stop there let's
03:37 - method chain again make that letter
03:40 - uppercase following the two uppercase
03:42 - method so this will work it's kind of
03:44 - like in a video game how you can have a
03:45 - combo well this is a three- hit combo
03:48 - boom boom boom take our username trim it
03:51 - get the first character and then make an
03:53 - uppercase all in one line of code not
03:56 - only that let's use some strink conation
03:59 - we need to take the rest of the
04:00 - characters in my username make them all
04:02 - lowercase then combine them together
04:04 - again let's take our username use the
04:06 - trim method method chain the slice
04:10 - method slice the string after the first
04:13 - character then method chain again use
04:16 - the two lowercase
04:20 - method and that should
04:22 - work
04:25 - console.log my
04:27 - username we're using a lot less L of
04:30 - code and I'll zoom out just so you can
04:32 - see
04:33 - everything and to your username I'll
04:35 - throw in some white spaces then mix up
04:38 - the
04:42 - capitalization and that has appeared to
04:44 - work so that's method chaining it's a
04:47 - programming technique where you can call
04:48 - one method right after another in one
04:51 - continuous line of code it's like a
04:53 - video game combo so to say so in this
04:56 - case trim our username give me the first
04:58 - character and then make it uppercase we
05:01 - did method chaining here here and then
05:04 - we combined the results using string
05:06 - catenation which is something separate
05:08 - entirely by using method chaining this
05:10 - helps you avoid creating named variables
05:12 - but if your method chain is too long it
05:14 - can become difficult to read like here I
05:17 - am kind of pushing the limits and well
05:19 - everybody that is Method chaining in
05:25 - JavaScript
