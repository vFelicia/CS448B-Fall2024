00:02 - hey everyone here's a quick program that
00:04 - we can make to calculate the
00:05 - circumference of a circle i thought this
00:07 - would be good practice for us now that
00:09 - we know how user input works let's
00:11 - declare all of the variables that we'll
00:13 - need
00:13 - i'm going to create a constant variable
00:16 - named pi and it's going to be of the
00:17 - double data type pi equals 3.14159
00:22 - the reason that i'm making this a
00:24 - constant is that i don't want anybody
00:25 - else to be able to change the value of
00:28 - pi and let's declare but not assign a
00:31 - radius quite yet we'll have the user
00:32 - type that in
00:34 - and double circumference
00:36 - this will be calculated and displayed so
00:39 - we will need to prompt the user to enter
00:41 - in a radius i'll proceed this with a new
00:44 - line
00:45 - enter
00:46 - radius
00:48 - of a circle and then i will use scanf to
00:51 - accept some user input we need to list
00:54 - the format specifier of doubles which is
00:57 - lf comma address of operator
01:00 - radius
01:02 - then the formula for radius is 2 times
01:06 - pi times radius and then we will display
01:10 - our circumference using printf
01:13 - circumference
01:15 - then we need a format specifier we're
01:17 - displaying a double so the format
01:19 - specifier is lf
01:22 - comma circumference
01:24 - and let's run it
01:26 - enter well the radius of a circle
01:30 - uh let's say that our radius is 10 maybe
01:33 - this is 10 i don't know meters
01:36 - all right our circumference is
01:38 - 62.83 meters now why not take this a
01:41 - step further let's also calculate the
01:43 - area of the circle i wasn't planning on
01:45 - taking it this far but hey let's
01:46 - calculate that as well for practice
01:48 - so let's declare a double variable named
01:51 - area
01:53 - and we will calculate what areas the
01:55 - formula for the area of the circle is
01:58 - pi times radius squared pi times radius
02:02 - times radius
02:05 - then let's display the area
02:09 - so area
02:11 - we're using the double format specifier
02:13 - and area then let's add some new line
02:16 - characters to separate everything
02:19 - enter the radius of a circle let's say
02:22 - 10 meters
02:24 - the circumference is
02:26 - 62.83 meters and the area is
02:30 - 314.15 meters all right everybody that
02:33 - is a small program to calculate the
02:35 - circumference of a circle and i guess
02:37 - the area as well just because well why
02:39 - not so yeah if you found this video
