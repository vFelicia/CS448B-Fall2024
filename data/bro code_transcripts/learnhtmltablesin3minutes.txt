00:00 - hey it's you bro hope you're doing well
00:02 - and in this video i'm going to show you
00:03 - all how we can create a table using html
00:06 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - hey everyone i'm going to show you all
00:13 - how we can create a table using html
00:15 - let's say that we have a store not an
00:18 - online store but a brick and mortar
00:20 - store and our job is to create a table
00:23 - of the hours of operation for our store
00:25 - which we can best represent with the
00:27 - table on our website so to create a
00:29 - table we'll use a pair of table tags
00:32 - there's an opening table tag and a
00:33 - closing table tag to add a row to our
00:35 - table we can use a pair of tr tags for
00:38 - table row and let's say that we'll have
00:41 - two rows one for the days of the week
00:43 - and the other for the hours of operation
00:46 - so within this first row let's add some
00:48 - headers using th tags for table header
00:51 - and i'll list the days of the week so we
00:53 - have sunday through saturday so to add
00:55 - another header just use another pair of
00:58 - th tags
01:00 - sunday
01:01 - monday
01:03 - tuesday
01:04 - you get the rest
01:14 - table headers are inherently bold if we
01:17 - would like to add some data to the
01:18 - second row we'll add that between the tr
01:21 - tags for the second row
01:23 - so we would like some data which is td
01:26 - we need an opening td tag and a closing
01:29 - td tag for each cell let's pretend that
01:32 - our store is open monday through friday
01:35 - nine to five and closed on the weekends
01:37 - saturday and sunday this first cell is
01:39 - for the first day sunday the first
01:41 - column
01:42 - so we are closed this day let's copy our
01:45 - table data element and copy it this will
01:48 - be for the second row monday and we are
01:50 - open nine to five and let's fill this in
01:53 - for the days monday through friday
01:57 - and then saturday we are closed
01:59 - all right let's color in these cells
02:01 - i'll make the first row a dark gray
02:04 - color so to change the color of the
02:06 - first row within the opening tr tag for
02:09 - the first row there is a bg color
02:11 - attribute which means background color
02:14 - and i will set the sequel to gray and
02:16 - our second row let's make this light
02:17 - gray so within the opening tr tag for
02:21 - the second row let's set the bg color
02:23 - attribute equal to a different color
02:25 - like light gray pick whatever color you
02:27 - want it doesn't necessarily have to be
02:28 - gray so within the opening table tag i
02:32 - will set the bg color equal to what
02:35 - about black
02:37 - cool these cells are left aligned we can
02:39 - center them to center the cells within a
02:42 - row within the opening tr tag there is
02:45 - an align attribute and let's set this
02:47 - equal to center and the text is now
02:50 - centered and lastly let's make all of
02:53 - these cells the same size this wednesday
02:55 - cell is taking up a lot of space let's
02:58 - set the width equal to maybe 100 pixels
03:02 - and i will just copy this
03:06 - and with the opening table element i
03:08 - will set this equal to the width of each
03:11 - cell times the number of cells that we
03:13 - have so if each cell has a width of 100
03:16 - and there's seven cells i will set the
03:18 - width equal to 700
03:22 - and well there we go all of these cells
03:24 - are now aligned so yeah that's how to
03:26 - create a table in html just use a pair
03:30 - of table tags for each row add a pair of
03:34 - tr tags if you need a row to function as
03:36 - a header such as the days of the week
03:39 - use th tags if you're filling in data
03:42 - for a cell use td tags for table data so
03:46 - yeah that's how to create a table in
