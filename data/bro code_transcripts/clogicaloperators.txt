00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:02 - bro hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to explain
00:05 - logical operators in c sharp
00:07 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - all right logical operators we can use
00:14 - logical operators to check to see if
00:16 - more than one condition
00:17 - is true or false we'll use two logical
00:20 - operators and as well as or
00:22 - and is represented by two ampersands and
00:25 - or is represented by two vertical bars
00:28 - we'll create a small program to ask the
00:30 - user what the temperature is outside
00:32 - and depending on what the user types in
00:33 - will display a custom message
00:35 - so we'll need to work with ranges of
00:37 - temperatures so let's begin we'll ask
00:39 - the user for some input
00:41 - so console.writeline what's the
00:44 - temperature outside and you can write
00:47 - this in fahrenheit or celsius but i'll
00:50 - use celsius
00:51 - okay then we'll store our input within a
00:53 - double
00:54 - variable named temp short for
00:56 - temperature and we'll need to use
00:59 - console.read line and then we'll need to
01:01 - convert this to
01:02 - a double using convert dot to double
01:05 - method
01:06 - so convert dot 2 double then within the
01:10 - parenthesis place your
01:11 - read the line method within here
01:15 - okay now we need to check to see if our
01:18 - temperature falls within a certain range
01:20 - using an if statement
01:22 - and using the and logical operator that
01:24 - will help us with that
01:25 - so let's check to see if our temp is
01:28 - greater than or equal to
01:29 - 10 degrees celsius and if our
01:33 - temperature
01:34 - is less than or equal to what about 25
01:38 - so both of these conditions must be true
01:41 - in order for us to execute this if
01:43 - statement
01:44 - if one of them is false we will skip
01:46 - over this if statement
01:47 - so this condition needs to be true and
01:50 - this condition needs to be true
01:52 - so our temperature has to fall within
01:54 - that range
01:55 - so we will display a custom message like
01:58 - it's warm outside it's not hot it's not
02:02 - cold
02:02 - it's just warm let's try it okay so what
02:05 - if the temperature was
02:07 - like 35 degrees celsius
02:10 - while nothing appears to happen we did
02:12 - not execute this if statement
02:14 - even though this condition is true this
02:17 - condition
02:18 - must also be true because we're using
02:19 - the and logical operator so let's try
02:22 - this again and type in a temperature
02:24 - between that range
02:24 - what's the temperature outside let's say
02:27 - that it's 15 degrees celsius
02:29 - it's warm outside now using the
02:32 - orological operator
02:33 - only one of these conditions needs to be
02:35 - true in order for this entire expression
02:38 - to evaluate to be true unlike with the
02:40 - endological operator both conditions
02:42 - must be true
02:43 - so let's check for some extreme
02:45 - temperatures using an else if statement
02:48 - else if temp let's say is less than or
02:51 - equal to
02:52 - negative 50 or temp
02:56 - is greater than or equal to 50
02:59 - then we will display do
03:02 - not go outside
03:06 - let's try it okay what's the temperature
03:09 - outside
03:09 - let's say that it's negative 52 degrees
03:12 - celsius do not go outside
03:14 - so even though this condition is true
03:17 - and this one is false
03:18 - using the or logical operator only one
03:20 - of these conditions needs to be true in
03:22 - order for our entire expression
03:24 - to evaluate to be true so let's do the
03:27 - same thing with a very
03:28 - high temperature this time what's the
03:31 - temperature outside
03:32 - let's say that it's like a kajillion
03:34 - degrees celsius
03:35 - maybe our sun explodes or something do
03:37 - not go outside
03:39 - well okay then everybody those are
03:40 - logical operators we can use them to
03:42 - check to see if more than one condition
03:45 - is true or false so if you would like a
03:48 - copy of this code i will post this to
03:49 - the comment section down below
03:51 - and well those are logical operators in
03:54 - c
03:54 - sharp
