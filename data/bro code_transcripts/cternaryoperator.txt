00:02 - hey sup people the trinary operator also
00:05 - known as the conditional operator it's a
00:07 - shortcut to using an if else statement
00:10 - when assigning or returning a value
00:12 - here's the formula we write a condition
00:15 - followed by a question mark if this
00:17 - condition is true we return some value
00:20 - if true or if that condition is false we
00:24 - return some other value here's an
00:25 - example first we'll use an if-else
00:27 - statement and then later we'll switch to
00:29 - the ternary operator so let's create a
00:31 - function that will find the maximum of
00:34 - two integers and i'm going to assign
00:36 - that to int max
00:38 - and we will invoke a function find max
00:41 - but we'll still need to declare it so
00:43 - let's pass in two integers maybe three
00:45 - and four
00:46 - and then i'm going to display whatever
00:48 - max is
00:50 - okay so let's declare this function so
00:53 - we're returning an integer
00:55 - the name is find max and let's set up
00:57 - some parameters into x and int y so if
01:01 - we're using an if else statement if we
01:03 - need to return x if it's larger we can
01:06 - check to see if
01:07 - x is larger than y
01:10 - if so then return x
01:13 - else
01:16 - return
01:17 - y so this does work
01:20 - so the max between three and four is
01:23 - four
01:24 - so if i switch three to five well then
01:27 - the max is five so a shortcut to writing
01:30 - an if else statement like this if we're
01:32 - returning or assigning a value is that
01:35 - we could instead use the tenary operator
01:38 - so let's return and then we have a
01:40 - condition
01:41 - so this is our condition
01:43 - is x greater than y then we add a
01:46 - question mark
01:48 - then the value we're returning if true
01:51 - so if x is greater than y let's return x
01:56 - colon then our value if this condition
01:58 - is false and here within our else
02:01 - statement we're returning y
02:03 - and we no longer need this if else
02:05 - statement and that's all there is to it
02:07 - so we cut down on all that code and now
02:09 - just have one line of code so it's kind
02:12 - of like a shortcut and this works much
02:14 - the same so the maximum between five and
02:16 - four is five and if i change five back
02:19 - to three well then the max is four so
02:22 - yeah that's the ternary operator it's a
02:24 - shortcut to using an if-else statement
02:26 - when assigning or returning a value you
02:28 - write some condition add a question mark
02:31 - like you're asking a question then list
02:33 - some value to return if this condition
02:36 - is true and then some other value if
02:39 - this condition is false so you just
02:41 - follow this formula so yeah that's the
02:43 - trenary operator if you would like a
02:45 - copy of this code i'll post this to the
02:47 - comment section down below and well yeah
02:49 - that's the canary operator nc
