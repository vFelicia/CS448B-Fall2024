00:00 - it's your bro hope you're doing well and
for this topic will be discussing fonts
00:04 - in CSS so let's get into it
00:08 - every one so we're going to be
discussing fonts so if you don't know
00:12 - fonts are a set of characters of a
particular style just had to get that
00:16 - out there in case you didn't know what a
font is don't hate me for bringing it up
00:20 - so there's two categories of fonts
there's serif and sans-serif here's an
00:25 - example okay well I took this image from
the Wikipedia page for serif and sans
00:30 - serif fonts now serif is a typography
term for small lines or embellishments
00:37 - on certain areas of these individual
characters you can see that here with
00:42 - this line all the serifs are colored red
now Sons serif means without then those
00:50 - lines that we were discussing so if
you're going to pick a font for your web
00:55 - page I would recommend something that is
sans serif that doesn't have these
00:59 - little lines just because it's easier to
read on a computer screen but if you
01:03 - really want to go crazy with serif fonts
be my guest
01:06 - I'm not going to stop you but generally
it's on serif fonts tend to be better
01:10 - okay then let's get started
let's add some sample text to our page
01:14 - I'm going to create an h1 header I will
add the text perhaps font demo we'll
01:22 - close this header tag and we'll add some
sample text if you're using sublime text
01:28 - you can just type in lorem and hit tab
otherwise you can just go online to find
01:33 - a paragraph or two and then just copy it
here let's save this refresh the page so
01:37 - I have a style sheet already linked to
my HTML file I will place all of the
01:44 - changes in properties for CSS using the
style sheet but if you're doing this
01:48 - internally or in line you can feel free
to do that as well
01:51 - so let's change the font of our
paragraph so I'm going to type in P
01:57 - because we're targeting the paragraph
elements and a set of curly brackets and
02:02 - now we can start adding some font
properties and I just realized I forgot
02:07 - to surround our paragraph with a set of
paragraph tags so make sure you do that
02:12 - ok now we're good so the first thing
that we're going to add is a font family
02:17 - so this is actually a property and what
you can do with a
02:21 - family is that you can list a few
different fonts that you want to use
02:25 - you'll use the first font in this list
and if for some reason if somebody's web
02:31 - browser can't support this font it will
try and use the next font and then it
02:36 - will just continue down the list so for
the last font you'll want to use
02:39 - something that's more or less
universally accepted so I'm going to
02:43 - list a few fonts here I'll start with
the one that I preferably want to use
02:47 - one font that I do like is ink free now
one thing to pay attention to is that
02:53 - with font names if they have a space you
need to put these within a set of quotes
02:57 - so let's try in crete to begin with so
let's save reload the page and now
03:03 - everything looks handwritten so i kind
of like this font i would like to add
03:06 - another font to this font family in case
somebody's web browser can't support
03:11 - this ink free font and another that i
like is this other one called
03:16 - MV Bohle so let's say that somebody's
web browser can't handle this first one
03:22 - it's going to use the second font in
this list which is from my example MV
03:28 - Bohle so it kind of looks like this so
I'm going to add maybe two fonts that I
03:34 - like and then for the last one this is
like a last resort in case somebody's
03:38 - web browser can't handle the first view
you can't go wrong with just typing in
03:43 - sons serif so if these two fonts don't
work it'll just default to a sans serif
03:50 - font but I kind of like that ink free
font because it has personality so I'm
03:56 - going to keep that so let's add a few
other things we can add a font style and
04:03 - you can type in the word italic to make
your font italic we can add a font
04:10 - weight and you can set this to bold so
this will basically just bold all of
04:17 - your text we can change the font size so
we'll use the font size property so the
04:24 - default for font sizes is 16 pixels but
I'm going to pick maybe 18 to make this
04:32 - a little bit larger just like so I know
the unit of measurement is e/m and the
04:37 - default is 1 p.m. so this is the same as
16 pixels so if I were to change this to
04:46 - 2 II M this would be the same as 32
pixels then so you might see either with
04:52 - a unit of measurement being pixels or
e/m so use whatever one you prefer all
04:58 - right we can also add a text decoration
and let's say I want to add a underline
05:07 - well we can do so this will add a
underline underneath all of our text we
05:13 - can also add a particular style to this
underline like we can type in the word
05:18 - wavy and this will become a wavy
underline I'm not sure what any good use
05:24 - of this would be but you can I don't
know maybe it's like ocean waves or
05:28 - something yeah you know what let's
change that to blue so our text is
05:33 - riding on some blue waves but I'm
getting off track again so I'm actually
05:38 - going to go back and set this to normal
and it's as if there's no change at all
05:45 - to that and we can change the font color
by using the color property you can type
05:50 - in a color name here or you can use a
hexadecimal value if you know how those
05:55 - work one value that I like is zero zero
a zero zero and this is a green color
06:02 - kind of like that so with the fonts
normally available to you with HTML and
06:07 - CSS it's somewhat limited but you also
have access to the google fonts API and
06:13 - I'll show you how you can add a
stylesheet link for a custom font from
06:18 - the Google Fonts API first I'll show you
the website for where to go for that so
06:22 - this site is easier to find that what I
anticipated all you do is go to fonts
06:27 - google.com I'll post this link in the
description down below so we can
06:32 - actually browse through these fonts if
there's anything you like you can just
06:35 - click on it then I'll show you the next
steps I did find one that I liked and it
06:40 - was called al D RI CH I think it's
pronounced alderic Aldrich
06:48 - probably pronouncing it wrong but I kind
of like the spot because it's techy kind
06:53 - of fits my channel so I'm going to click
on this alright so then I'm going to
06:58 - select the style then go to this embed
tab alright so we're going to take this
07:05 - link we're going to copy this go to our
HTML file and we're going to paste it
07:11 - within the head so that's step one
now with step two which HTML element do
07:17 - we want to target let's target our h1
header that we have so we're going to
07:22 - make a block for this on our style sheet
and we're going to go back to this embed
07:29 - tab and we're going to just copy this
font family otherwise you can just type
07:34 - it in basically all you have to make
sure to do is just to type in the font
07:38 - name that you used so let's save this I
can actually close out of this page now
07:43 - refresh our page and we now have this
custom font from the google fonts API
07:49 - and with the font family you can also
add a few other fonts to fall back upon
07:54 - in case for some reason this one isn't
supported so perhaps I'll just add that
08:00 - ink free font that I like and then make
sure each font is separated with a comma
08:05 - so basically since my web browser
supports this font it's going to display
08:11 - this one then it's gonna fall back on
these other fonts encase this first one
08:16 - isn't supported and let's add a font
color to our header tag our h1 tag and
08:24 - perhaps I'll pick a very bright green
color so that's 0 0 FF 0 0 let's see
08:33 - what that looks like oh yeah that's
pretty sweet but I think this would look
08:36 - better on a black background so I'm
actually going to target the body
08:42 - element of our web page and I'm going to
set the background - color to black
08:51 - otherwise if you don't want to type in
the word you can just type in hashtag
08:55 - and the hexadecimal value for black is
just 6 zeroes all right let's
09:01 - this looks like oh but I misspelled body
so make sure you spell it right all
09:06 - right sorry about that okay yeah that's
pretty sweet and maybe I'll just change
09:11 - the background color of this paragraph
element just something slightly lighter
09:18 - maybe one one one one one one okay yeah
that's not too bad so that concludes
