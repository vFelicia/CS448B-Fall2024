00:00 - hey everyone I have a super quick video
00:02 - on the order by Clause the order by
00:05 - Clause sorts the results of a query in
00:08 - either ascending or descending order
00:10 - based on which column we list here's an
00:13 - example I have a list of employees how
00:16 - can I list all of these employees
00:17 - alphabetically currently they are listed
00:20 - by their employee ID well at the end of
00:22 - my statement I can add an order by
00:25 - Clause order buy then a column to order
00:29 - our Rose by let's order all of these
00:32 - employees by their last name
00:36 - Now by default they will be ordered in
00:39 - ascending order or alphabetical order if
00:41 - you're working with characters for
00:43 - descending order or reverse alphabetical
00:45 - order just add dese for descending
00:49 - now these employees are listed in
00:51 - Reverse alphabetical order or descending
00:54 - order for us sending order that would be
00:56 - ASC but that is the default so you don't
01:00 - explicitly need ASC
01:03 - let's order these employees by their
01:05 - first name
01:06 - first name
01:09 - these employees are listed
01:10 - alphabetically by their first name
01:12 - let's do reverse alphabetical order
01:15 - yeah there we are let's order these
01:18 - employees by their higher date
01:20 - higher date and ascending order
01:23 - you don't even technically need that
01:25 - keyword ascending it would still work
01:27 - just fine now descending
01:30 - I think we have the hang of it now let's
01:32 - select all from transactions there's one
01:35 - more thing I want to show you
01:37 - select all from transactions
01:40 - we have two transactions with the same
01:42 - amount
01:43 - let's order by amount
01:49 - when ordering a column if two values
01:51 - share the same amount we can add an
01:54 - additional column to compare by order by
01:56 - amount but if two amounts are the same
01:59 - order by maybe
02:01 - customer ID
02:05 - these two rows are now flipped
02:08 - so you can order by more than one column
02:10 - if two columns share the same amount
02:13 - then order by some other column then you
02:17 - can add ascending descending however you
02:21 - want to order your table
02:22 - so yeah that is the order by Clause you
02:25 - can order your rows by some column you
02:27 - specify in ascending or descending order
02:30 - but yeah that is the order by clause in
