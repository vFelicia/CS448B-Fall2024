00:00 - hey what's going on everybody in today's
00:01 - video we're going to create a
00:02 - temperature conversion program using
00:04 - HTML CSS and JavaScript so sit back
00:08 - relax and enjoy the show all right let's
00:10 - begin everybody we will begin within our
00:12 - HTML file make sure you've linked a
00:15 - script to your Javascript file which
00:17 - we'll fill in later so within the body
00:19 - of our document we will create a form
00:22 - element within our form we will create
00:25 - an H1 heading for the title of this
00:27 - program which we will name
00:32 - temperature conversion is
00:36 - good after our H1 element we'll create
00:39 - an input
00:42 - element this is a self-closing tag it's
00:44 - a text box since we're going to be
00:47 - converting temperatures I will set the
00:49 - type to be number so that should give us
00:53 - some arrows to increase or decrease the
00:55 - number or type one in if we need to I'm
00:57 - going to give this text box an ID of of
01:02 - textbox we'll be referring to this text
01:04 - box by its ID later I'm also going to go
01:07 - ahead and set an initial value of zero
01:10 - then we can increase or decrease the
01:11 - number like I said before it is a little
01:14 - small but with CSS we will increase the
01:16 - size what I'm going to do now is create
01:18 - two radio buttons along with
01:21 - labels so we have input input is a
01:24 - self-closing tag the type will be
01:28 - radio and for the
01:31 - ID this will be a radio button to
01:33 - convert to
01:37 - Fahrenheit I can never spell Fahrenheit
01:40 - we'll want the radio buttons in the same
01:41 - group I will set the name of the group
01:43 - to be
01:45 - unit oh looks like I misspell type there
01:48 - we go so I'm going to place our radio
01:50 - button on a new line so within our first
01:53 - input element I will add a line break
01:55 - all right so after our first radio
01:57 - button I'll create a label for it
02:01 - label this label will be
02:04 - four 2
02:07 - Fahrenheit and the text will be Celsius
02:11 - to
02:15 - Fahrenheit or if you prefer you could
02:17 - create like an
02:19 - arrow I don't really like the look of
02:21 - that let me use an emoji instead so on
02:23 - Windows to create an emoji you can hold
02:24 - windows and
02:26 - semicolon is there an
02:28 - arrow
02:30 - that'll work so when you click on the
02:32 - label you should also be able to select
02:34 - the radio button that's because the four
02:36 - attribute is the same as the ID
02:38 - attribute of the radio button okay let's
02:40 - copy both the first radio button and the
02:43 - label then paste it but change
02:46 - Fahrenheit to
02:48 - Celsius let's switch these
02:52 - around Fahrenheit to
02:58 - Celsius
03:00 - to
03:01 - Celsius I'm also going to add a line
03:03 - break after our first
03:05 - label so right
03:07 - here as well as here Google wants to
03:11 - translate my web page from German to
03:13 - English it's probably because of the
03:14 - word fahrenheit I'm guessing now I'll
03:16 - create a
03:21 - button the type will be button the text
03:25 - will be submit there is an onclick
03:28 - attribute for buttons
03:31 - onclick when we click on this button we
03:34 - can execute a JavaScript
03:36 - function eventually we'll be creating a
03:39 - function named convert actually let's
03:41 - take care of that now before we forget
03:42 - So within our Javascript file function
03:45 - convert we'll fill this in
03:48 - later so when we click on the button we
03:51 - will execute the convert
03:53 - function then lastly we're going to
03:56 - display a result whatever the new
03:57 - temperature is we'll use a paragraph
04:01 - element the ID will be result and just
04:06 - as a placeholder for now I'm going to
04:08 - type select a
04:12 - unit all right so far so good let's
04:15 - style this program with CSS now be sure
04:17 - to save your HTML file we'll move on to
04:20 - CSS we will first change the body of our
04:23 - document let's change the font family of
04:25 - the body of our document I'll pick aial
04:29 - with a backup of son's
04:34 - serif I'll change the background color
04:37 - too
04:39 - background-color I like using hsl
04:42 - values let's type a color such as black
04:45 - we will change the color to be hsl I'll
04:49 - go with a very light gray color like
04:53 - 95% so the background is going to be
04:56 - slightly light gray we'll fill in the
04:58 - form section to be Pure White we will
05:01 - select our H1 element that's going to be
05:03 - the header I'll pick a color again I'll
05:06 - be using hsl
05:08 - values let's go with I don't know blue
05:11 - feel free to pick a different color if
05:13 - you would like that's not
05:16 - bad then we'll fill in the form our form
05:19 - contains pretty much all of these
05:22 - elements so let's select our
05:25 - form I will change the background color
05:28 - I'll just copy this sline and paste
05:30 - it but I'll make this Pure
05:35 - White I'll text Al line Center
05:37 - everything within this
05:39 - form so everything should be
05:42 - centered I'll set a Max width of the
05:44 - form because right now it's taking up
05:46 - 100% of the width of the web browser so
05:50 - max width will be how about 350
05:55 - pixels we would like this form to be
05:57 - within the middle aligned horizontally
06:00 - we can set margin to be
06:03 - Auto to automatically Center that I'll
06:06 - add a little bit of padding around the
06:08 - elements within our
06:10 - form
06:11 - padding let's do 25
06:15 - pixels I'll smooth the corners of the
06:17 - form using border
06:18 - radius border
06:21 - radius 10
06:23 - pixels then I'll add a box
06:26 - shadow box shadow
06:29 - the first value is the horizontal offset
06:33 - let's set that to be five
06:35 - pixels then the vertical offset I will
06:37 - set that to be 5 pixels the third value
06:41 - is the blur radius because right now
06:42 - it's fairly concentrated let's stick
06:45 - with 15 pixels not bad you can also
06:49 - select a color again I'm going to use
06:51 - hsl
06:52 - values you can also change the
06:56 - transparency I'll set mine to be 30%
07:00 - or approximately
07:01 - 30%
07:03 - 0.3 not bad so that's my box Shadow now
07:07 - we're going to change the text box so
07:10 - this text box does have an ID text box
07:14 - let's select this element by its
07:16 - ID I'll set the width to be
07:19 - 50% it's going to take up 50% of the
07:22 - width
07:23 - available let's text align
07:28 - Center the number is going to be right
07:30 - in the middle let's change the font
07:33 - size let's do 2 em for
07:37 - 200% I'll add a
07:40 - border to pixel
07:44 - solid then I'll pick some hsl values for
07:47 - the
07:49 - color I'll make it a little
07:52 - transparent maybe like
07:55 - 80% let's select a border
07:58 - radius
08:00 - for pixels to smooth the
08:03 - corners I'll add a little bit of margin
08:06 - below the text
08:09 - box
08:12 - margin-bottom 15 pixels is
08:15 - good that's going to push the radio
08:17 - buttons down further just to give this
08:19 - text box more space let's work on the
08:21 - radio buttons next so we are selecting
08:24 - the
08:26 - labels so let's take every label
08:30 - I'll change the font size so it's a
08:31 - little bigger 1.5 em for
08:35 - 150% I'll make the font weight to bold
08:38 - just to bold
08:40 - it there let's select our
08:44 - button we are selecting our button I'll
08:47 - add a little bit of margin above the
08:49 - button margin-top 15
08:53 - pixels let's change the background color
08:55 - of the button pick a color I'll pick red
08:59 - and again I'm going to use hsl values
09:01 - because I like
09:05 - them Ah that's
09:07 - decent I'll change the font size of the
09:09 - button 1.5 em for
09:14 - 150% I'll remove the border border
09:18 - none I'll add some
09:22 - padding 10 pixels for the top and bottom
09:25 - of the button 15 for the
09:27 - sides I'll round the the corners with
09:29 - border
09:31 - radius border radius 5
09:34 - pixels I'm going to change the font
09:36 - color color
09:40 - white then when I hover my cursor over
09:42 - the button I will change the cursor to
09:45 - be a
09:46 - pointer and that appears to work
09:48 - now so when I hover over the button I'll
09:51 - use the hover pseudo class to change the
09:54 - background color of the button we are
09:56 - selecting our button then s select the
09:59 - hover sudo class we'll make the
10:01 - background color just a little bit
10:03 - darker we'll change the lightness of our
10:06 - hsl value to be like 10% darker so I
10:09 - have 60% I'll change that to be 50 so
10:12 - now the background should change when I
10:14 - hover over the button lastly let's
10:16 - change the CSS properties of the
10:19 - result so this should have an ID of
10:23 - result
10:25 - result I'll make the font size a little
10:27 - bit bigger font size 1.75 em is
10:32 - good and I'll make the font weight bold
10:36 - font weight bold all right and that is
10:40 - all the CSS we need be sure to save
10:43 - everything and then we will move on to
10:45 - our Javascript file all right so what I
10:47 - like to do is at the top of my
10:49 - JavaScript program I will declare all of
10:51 - the constants and variables that I'll
10:53 - need so let's get our text box I'll set
10:56 - this to be a constant const text text
10:59 - box equals document. getet element by
11:06 - ID the ID that we're selecting is our
11:09 - text
11:13 - box we'll need the two Fahrenheit radio
11:16 - button let's copy this line paste it get
11:20 - the ID of two
11:22 - Fahrenheit const to Fahrenheit get
11:26 - element by ID to Fahrenheit
11:29 - then 2
11:31 - Celsius 2
11:33 - Celsius const 2 Celsius the ID is 2
11:37 - Celsius so that will be this radio
11:41 - button copy this line paste it then we
11:44 - need the result to display the
11:47 - result result get element by ID
11:51 - result within our HTML file we don't
11:54 - necessarily need to select a unit
11:56 - anymore We'll add that later if somebody
11:59 - presses submit without selecting a radio
12:01 - button then we need let temp for the
12:06 - temperature when we click on the submit
12:08 - button we will execute this function
12:11 - convert so what are we going to do
12:13 - within this function we'll begin with an
12:15 - if statement we'll check to see if our
12:18 - two Fahrenheit radio button is selected
12:21 - so take two Fen height we'll use the
12:25 - checked
12:26 - property if this radio button is checked
12:29 - it's going to return true if it's not
12:31 - it's going to be
12:32 - false else if 2 Celsius is
12:38 - checked to celsius. checked we'll
12:41 - perform some different
12:43 - actions else let's change the content of
12:47 - our
12:48 - result so here result. text content
12:55 - equals select a
12:57 - unit let's see if this works be sure to
13:00 - save
13:01 - everything I am not going to select a
13:03 - radio button I'm just going to submit
13:06 - and that's correct select a unit we
13:07 - didn't select one let's be sure that
13:09 - these two radio buttons are working just
13:11 - temporarily I'm going to change the
13:13 - result within the if and else if
13:16 - statement you
13:19 - selected 2
13:24 - Fahrenheit and you selected two Celsius
13:30 - I just want to be sure that these radio
13:32 - buttons are working so let's convert two
13:34 - Fahrenheit submit you selected 2
13:37 - Fahrenheit we'll select the second
13:39 - radial button you selected 2 Celsius
13:42 - okay we know that this program is
13:44 - reading these radio button successfully
13:46 - so we no longer need these two lines of
13:49 - code we're going to get the number from
13:52 - our text box we'll store that within
13:54 - temp temp for temperature temp equals
13:59 - take our text
14:01 - box access the value
14:04 - within so when we accept user input it's
14:07 - of the string data type I'm going to typ
14:10 - cast the value as a number so we can use
14:12 - it with
14:14 - math okay then we're going to take our
14:16 - temperature and convert it to Fahrenheit
14:19 - here's the formula temp equals
14:22 - temp * 9 / 5 + 32
14:29 - then we're going to update the text
14:31 - content of the
14:33 - result result. text content equals our
14:39 - temperature then I'm going to add plus
14:42 - Fahrenheit so to add the degree symbol
14:45 - on Windows you can hold alt then type
14:48 - 0176 on the
14:50 - numpad so this will be
14:52 - Fahrenheit let's type 100° CI to
14:57 - Fahrenheit that gives us 212° f 10 would
15:01 - be 50 1° c would be
15:06 - 33.8 0 is 32° F if you would like to add
15:11 - some Precision following our temperature
15:13 - there's a built-in method two
15:17 - fixed We'll add one point of precision
15:20 - this will give us one digit past the
15:21 - decimal place 0° C converted to
15:24 - Fahrenheit is 32.0 De
15:27 - fah
15:29 - 10° C is 50° F let's copy these three
15:35 - lines then paste them within the else if
15:38 - statement we'll keep this line the same
15:41 - but we'll change the
15:43 - formula temp equals within parentheses
15:47 - temp -
15:49 - 32 * 5 9 then change Fahrenheit to
15:57 - Celsius so what is 32° fah converted to
16:01 - Celsius that is
16:03 - zero 100 is
16:06 - 37.8 all right everybody so that is a
16:09 - simple temperature conversion program
16:11 - using JavaScript HTML and
16:16 - CSS
