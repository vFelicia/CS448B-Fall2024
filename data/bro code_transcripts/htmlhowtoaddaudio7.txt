00:00 - hey how's it going everybody it's you
bro here and in this video I'm gonna
00:02 - teach you guys how we can include audio
on our web pages using HTML let's get
00:07 - into it
now before we begin if you want to
00:12 - follow along you can download an mp3
audio file or you can find one on your
00:17 - computer and use that and place it in
the same folder that contains the HTML
00:22 - document that you plan on working with
just so you're aware html5 only supports
00:27 - these audio files mp3 wav and OGG and
wave and OGG don't work on all different
00:35 - web browsers but mp3 does so you really
can't go wrong with using mp3 audio
00:40 - files if you need an mp3 audio file
YouTube does have a free audio library
00:45 - that contains music as well as sound
effects you can use whatever you want
00:50 - for your projects websites videos
whatever you need so you know you can
00:55 - browse through here and pick something
that you like I just so happen to find
00:58 - this song called bro time I like it
mostly because of the title and if you
01:06 - want to download it just go to the right
and click download I'll include a link
01:10 - for this audio library in the
description down below
01:13 - here's that audio file I downloaded it's
within the same folder that contains the
01:18 - HTML document that I plan on using if
you want to place this somewhere else
01:22 - feel free to do so I'll show you how you
can include the file path when we start
01:26 - to link our audio files to our webpages
if you're all set let's begin the first
01:32 - step is that we need a pair of audio
tags and make sure to put this within
01:36 - the body of your HTML document we're
going to type audio we need an opening
01:42 - tag as well as a closing tag let's save
this and refresh the page nothing
01:47 - appears to have been quite yet the next
step is that within the opening audio
01:51 - tag let's put the word controls and see
what this does so let's save reload and
01:58 - we now have this little control bar for
our audio it doesn't appear to do
02:02 - anything quite yet everything's disabled
there's a play button some time stamps
02:07 - and a volume bar we need to list an
audio file as a source for this so
02:13 - between the audio tags we're going to
use the source tag and within the source
02:17 - tag we're going to type this s our C
double quotes and
02:23 - within the double quotes type in the
name of the audio file that you want to
02:27 - link to this for me I was using that
title bro time dot mp3 let's save this
02:35 - reload and look at that
everything's filled in and no longer
02:39 - disabled so let's play this and give it
a listen
02:47 - so there's also a volume bar to the
sound and you can see that it's still
02:57 - playing not all versions of web browser
support audio so it's good to write a
03:02 - message within your audio tag that
displays a message such as your browser
03:08 - doesn't support audio in case somebody's
browser doesn't support audio it's not
03:16 - going to display the audio controls or
play the audio it's just going to
03:21 - display this message that lets the user
know that's viewing your web page that
03:25 - basically their browser doesn't support
audio here's a scenario let's say that
03:30 - the audio file you want to use is
someplace else on your computer or in a
03:35 - different location besides the same
folder that contains your HTML document
03:40 - for example I moved that audio file to
my desktop since we moved that audio
03:45 - file it's no longer within that same
folder that contains this HTML document
03:50 - and it can no longer link this as a
source so we need to list the file path
03:55 - for where the audio file is located
before the file name so for me it's
04:00 - currently on my desktop so what I'm
gonna have to do since this is in a
04:03 - different folder I need to list the file
path before this audio file name so
04:08 - let's save this and see if it works now
04:15 - here's a few tricks you can do with
audio in HTML now if we were to
04:20 - fast-forward to the very end of the song
you will notice that it actually stops
04:26 - once the song is complete right in the
opening audio tag if we use the keyword
04:31 - loop within it save this and then reload
this song this audio file
04:37 - is going to loop through continuously
let's try it out so I'm just gonna fast
04:42 - forward bear with me
04:51 - another option for our audio is that we
can begin audio automatically being
04:56 - muted so we can use the muted keyword
within the opening audio tag if we were
05:02 - to reload this page the volume is
already muted by default and even if we
05:08 - were to hit the play button it's still
going to be muted lastly for this topic
05:12 - I'm going to teach you guys about
autoplay now I would actually not
05:16 - recommend using autoplay because if
somebody visits your webpage and they're
05:20 - in a quiet or private location and then
all of a sudden the webpage that they're
05:25 - on just starts blasting audio or music
they're going to become fairly irritated
05:29 - but I'm gonna teach you guys how to do
so anyways now within the opening audio
05:34 - tag just write the word autoplay within
here now the audio will play regardless
05:40 - if the user wants it to or not
autoplay doesn't work for some web
05:45 - browsers as well as mobile devices if I
were to save this and reload I'm
05:50 - actually using Google Chrome it doesn't
appear to work on Google Chrome so
05:54 - results may vary with autoplay so what
I'm going to do is open this HTML
05:59 - document with our old friend Internet
Explorer and I do have to allow blocked
06:05 - content so you can see that this model
played as soon as we got to this web
06:10 - page I'm going to refresh this and it
just keeps on autoplay and if you want
06:18 - to be really annoying just take out the
controls for the audio then you end up
06:21 - with some nice background music that the
user cannot stop allow blocked content
06:28 - that's user cannot stop this normally
well that's the basics of using audio in
06:35 - HTML if you're looking for practice or a
project to work on I have an idea let's
06:39 - create perhaps some sort of music
website like iTunes but it's going to be
06:44 - the poor man's version of iTunes in fact
I'm going to call it me tunes if you
06:49 - want to follow along with this download
or locate a few audio files and put them
06:55 - in the same folder as your HTML document
or someplace else but remember what the
06:59 - file path to get there was and if you
need some mp3 files to download you can
07:04 - always go to YouTube's audio library and
here you have free music and sound
07:08 - effects that you can use here are the
names of the audio files that I'm using
07:12 - they're all mp3 city nightlights
bro time block party and beat your
07:18 - competition if you have a few audio
files picked out you're ready to start
07:22 - then so you can either clear out the
document you're currently working on or
07:26 - start a new project let's create a title
for this webpage and this will be called
07:30 - me Tunes it's the generic brand of
iTunes so I'm just going to type in me
07:37 - tunes and use an h1 heading for this
alright that's decent enough I'm going
07:42 - to use a brake line tag just so we can
move down the line now what I think I'll
07:47 - do is that I will include the song title
before the actual controls for the audio
07:53 - player so this first song that I'm going
to be using is bro time alright and then
08:00 - I want the controls for the audio player
to come right after this so after my
08:06 - text I'm going to use a pair of audio
tags so I want an opening audio tag and
08:12 - a closing audio tag and I'm going to
write the word controls within the
08:17 - opening audio tag yeah I think I'll move
down a line after the title ok I like
08:26 - that better alright now we need to use
the source tag between the audio tags
08:32 - and we need to list the source
so we'll say SRC equals double quotes
08:38 - and then we need to place the name of
the audio file that we want to use here
08:43 - so for me I was using
bro underscore time dot mp3 and then
08:50 - just in case somebody somebody's web
browser doesn't support audio we should
08:55 - probably leave a message that says your
browser doesn't support audio let's see
09:05 - if this first one works all right so I'm
going to organize this a little bit and
09:14 - let's repeat the same process for each
of these songs so what I'm going to do
09:18 - is copy this and paste it and then make
a few changes but I should probably add
09:23 - a break line after this just to give us
some room alright so the next song that
09:30 - I plan on using is block party so I'll
create a title block party and this was
09:40 - block underscore party dot mp3 it's
basically the same thing is what we did
09:47 - up here alright so here's our second
song good enough alright same process as
09:59 - what we did before so I'm going to copy
this paste it and the next song was
10:07 - called City night lights and the source
is City night lights dot mp3 except for
10:20 - me they were underscore between here
here's the next song okay let's add just
10:31 - one more but you get the idea here and
the last song was called beat your
10:35 - competition so I'm going to change the e
title and we need to list that audio
10:45 - file as the source so beat underscore
your underscore competition okay this is
10:54 - the last one then
11:02 - alright good enough but yeah that is the
generic brand of iTunes that we just
11:07 - made called me Tunes it could use some
work but we're on our way but yeah that
11:13 - is everything you need to know to get
started working with audio files in HTML
