00:00 - hello everybody today we will be
00:02 - creating a dice roller program in Python
00:04 - we will be utilizing some ASCII art I'll
00:07 - post all of the ASCII art that we'll
00:09 - need in the description of this video
00:10 - you can copy and paste it to save time
00:12 - if you'd like
00:14 - all right let's get started everybody we
00:16 - will Begin by importing the random
00:18 - module because we will be rolling some
00:20 - random numbers between one through six
00:22 - if we're going to create some ASCII art
00:24 - we'll be utilizing Unicode characters to
00:27 - enter in a Unicode character it really
00:29 - varies depending on your operating
00:30 - system I think the easiest way would
00:33 - just be to use Python to enter a Unicode
00:35 - character type a forward slash then a
00:38 - given code for each character here are
00:40 - all of the codes that we'll need
00:52 - after writing these seven Unicode
00:54 - characters let's run this program these
00:56 - symbols that are output let's copy them
00:59 - I'll add them to a comment
01:01 - then we can delete this line
01:03 - these are the Unicode characters we'll
01:05 - need to build some ASCII art some dice
01:08 - each die will be made out of five lines
01:14 - let's begin with the first we'll need a
01:16 - left corner
01:18 - nine dashes
01:21 - then the right corner
01:24 - for the second line
01:26 - copy this vertical bar add nine spaces
01:32 - then a vertical bar
01:34 - we can copy this whole line
01:36 - paste it two times
01:39 - let's use the left bottom corner
01:42 - add a nine of these dashes
01:46 - then the bottom right corner
01:49 - and here's a basic box shape depending
01:51 - on what the number die is we can add one
01:53 - of these bullet points for a one we can
01:56 - add that right to the middle so that's
01:57 - good for now we'll delete this later
02:00 - let's create a dictionary I will name
02:02 - this dictionary
02:04 - dice art
02:07 - our dictionary is made out of key value
02:09 - pairs so the keys will be the numbers
02:11 - one through six
02:13 - beginning with one the value will be a
02:17 - tuple it's a dictionary made out of key
02:20 - value pairs where the value is a tuple
02:23 - within the Tuple let's add these lines
02:27 - each separated with the comma
02:40 - I'm going to format these so they form a
02:42 - box shape
02:46 - let's take our bullet point
02:48 - place it right in the middle then add a
02:51 - comma to the end of this key value pair
02:53 - that is the first key value pair let's
02:56 - copy all of this
02:58 - paste it again change one to two let's
03:01 - move this bullet point we need two
03:03 - bullet points
03:05 - about right here
03:07 - and here let's repeat this process for
03:10 - Keys three through six
03:36 - be sure to get rid of the comma at the
03:37 - end
03:39 - and here is our dictionary of Dysart
03:42 - each key is a number each value is a
03:45 - tuple made of strings
03:48 - let's create a list of dice our dice
03:52 - will be numbers randomly generated
03:54 - between one and six
03:57 - a total to calculate the total I'll set
03:59 - that to be zero
04:01 - then we will ask a user for a number of
04:04 - dice
04:07 - this will be some input
04:10 - how many dice
04:14 - then Typecast the input as an integer
04:17 - we don't want somebody to write you know
04:19 - 2.5 dice you can't roll half a die to
04:22 - generate a random number you can use the
04:24 - Rand int method of the random module
04:28 - we need a random number between one and
04:31 - six
04:32 - then we need to append this number to
04:34 - our list of dice
04:36 - dice dot append
04:39 - then we can move this line to within the
04:41 - append method
04:44 - we need to do this a number of times
04:46 - depending on how many dice the user
04:48 - enters in
04:49 - we can place this line within a for Loop
04:52 - for every
04:55 - die
04:56 - in our range
04:58 - number of dice this will be a number
05:02 - let's print our list of dice to see what
05:05 - numbers we have in here
05:07 - how many dice I would like five dice
05:09 - five three three four six
05:12 - okay we know that that works let's
05:14 - calculate a total
05:15 - we'll need to iterate and sum all of the
05:19 - elements within our list we can do that
05:21 - with the for Loop
05:23 - for every die
05:26 - in our list dice
05:28 - take our total variable
05:31 - plus equals
05:33 - the current value within our dice
05:36 - then we will print a total I'll use an F
05:39 - string
05:40 - total colon space
05:43 - our total variable
05:46 - let's see what we have so far
05:50 - how many dice I would like five dice
05:52 - our total is 19. now between these two
05:56 - for Loops we will display our ASCII art
05:58 - the easiest way would be to create some
06:01 - nested for loops
06:03 - the outer for Loop will be in charge of
06:05 - the number of dice
06:07 - for every die
06:10 - in our range
06:12 - number of dice
06:17 - the inner for Loop
06:19 - will be in charge of printing every
06:21 - Tuple
06:24 - for every line
06:26 - in
06:28 - than to get a value in our dictionary we
06:30 - would type the name of the dictionary
06:32 - dice art
06:34 - then use the get method
06:36 - what are we getting we're getting a
06:39 - value at a given key
06:41 - let's take our list of numbers dice
06:44 - at index
06:47 - of die our counter
06:49 - depending on what the user types in for
06:51 - the number of dice dye will begin at 1
06:53 - then increment
06:55 - within the inner for Loop we will print
06:59 - the line
07:01 - so let's take a look
07:03 - how many dice I would like three dice
07:06 - and here's our ASCII art six plus two
07:08 - plus four that equals 12.
07:11 - if you would prefer we can display all
07:14 - of these dice on a single horizontal
07:17 - line instead of one vertical line it's a
07:20 - little more tricky though if you would
07:21 - prefer that approach let's turn this
07:24 - chunk of code into comments
07:27 - we will write this nested Loop a little
07:29 - different
07:31 - so each Tuple is made up of five
07:33 - elements right
07:36 - so if we're printing a horizontal line
07:39 - let's say we roll the numbers one
07:41 - through three we would first need to
07:43 - display this line of the first dice
07:46 - then the first line of the second dice
07:49 - then the first line of the third dice
07:52 - during the next iteration of the outer
07:54 - loop we would display the second line of
07:57 - the first dice the second line of the
07:59 - second dice the second line of the third
08:02 - dice
08:03 - so it's a little more complex
08:05 - let's create an outer loop that will
08:07 - iterate five times for every line in
08:11 - range five
08:15 - then the nested Loop will be for every
08:17 - die in dice
08:22 - how many dice do we have within our list
08:27 - we will print we're going to get one of
08:30 - the values found at one of the numbers
08:32 - that we roll
08:35 - take our dictionary of Dysart
08:38 - dot get then a number one through six
08:43 - that will be the value found within our
08:45 - list of dice
08:47 - get the current die remember that this
08:50 - is a number one through six
08:52 - we would then need one of the elements
08:54 - found within our Tuple so get the first
08:57 - line then the second line third fourth
09:01 - fifth
09:04 - so let's add the index operator
09:07 - place our counter of line within the
09:09 - index operator
09:11 - let's see what we have so far
09:13 - we need to add one more thing how many
09:15 - dice three
09:18 - this is an Abomination there's one more
09:21 - change we need to make
09:24 - at the end of our print statement let's
09:26 - set the ending character to be an empty
09:29 - string
09:30 - and that should fix that how many dice
09:32 - three
09:34 - okay we're getting better results
09:36 - then when we escape the inner loop we
09:38 - will print a new line
09:41 - how many dice three
09:43 - and there we are three plus six plus one
09:46 - is ten
09:48 - all right everybody so that is a dice
09:50 - roller program it is kind of complex but
09:53 - I thought this might be a good exercise
09:54 - if you would like a copy of this code I
09:57 - will post all of this in the comments
09:58 - section down below and well yeah that's
10:00 - a dice roller program in Python
