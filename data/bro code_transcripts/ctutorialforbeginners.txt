00:00 - hey guys in this video you're going to
00:02 - write your first c plus program so sit
00:05 - back relax and well enjoy the show
00:09 - hey if you wouldn't mind please like
00:11 - comment and subscribe one like equals
00:14 - one prayer for the youtube algorithm
00:17 - i'm gonna tell you why you need to learn
00:19 - c plus plus
00:20 - c plus plus is a fast language like
00:23 - really fast it's commonly used in
00:26 - advanced graphics applications a few
00:28 - examples would include adobe
00:30 - applications video editing software
00:33 - anything that's graphics intensive c
00:35 - plus plus is considered a middle level
00:37 - language therefore it's commonly used
00:39 - with embedded systems and most
00:41 - importantly it's commonly used with
00:43 - creating video games i like video games
00:46 - like a lot compared to other programming
00:48 - languages you could say that c plus plus
00:51 - is a middle level language programming
00:54 - languages tend to be on a spectrum the
00:56 - higher level of programming languages
00:58 - the more it resembles human language
01:00 - languages that are closer to being lower
01:02 - level resemble hardware instructions
01:04 - higher level languages such as python
01:06 - java and c-sharp are very easy to write
01:09 - with and to understand but they tend to
01:11 - be slower c plus and c they take a
01:14 - little more effort to write but they're
01:16 - very fast they have the benefit of
01:18 - working closely with machine hardware
01:20 - while still somewhat resembling human
01:22 - language just a fair warning there is a
01:24 - learning curve with c plus plus but if
01:26 - you can learn it it's worth it i did
01:28 - some research on glassdoor.com
01:30 - the average salary for a c plus software
01:33 - engineer is 124 000
01:36 - however i'm just going to say this right
01:38 - now watching this video by itself will
01:41 - not guarantee you a job it's a good
01:43 - entry point though you'll want to watch
01:45 - the video practice create a portfolio
01:48 - work on your job interview skills then
01:50 - you have a good chance of getting an
01:51 - entry level job but as you can see
01:53 - there's a lot of potential so why not
01:56 - learn c plus there's two things you'll
01:58 - need to get started one is a text editor
02:01 - a few options include but are not
02:03 - limited to would be
02:05 - vs code code blocks or even notepad vs
02:09 - code and code blocks are also considered
02:11 - ides integrated development environments
02:15 - they are a text editor as well as a
02:16 - workshop that contain a lot of useful
02:18 - developer tools in this video i'm going
02:21 - to show you how to download vs code but
02:23 - feel free to use any text editor that
02:25 - you're comfortable with secondly we'll
02:27 - need a compiler a compiler is a piece of
02:30 - software that will parse source code to
02:33 - machine instructions and that's really
02:35 - it if you're using windows or linux
02:37 - you'll probably want to go with gcc if
02:40 - you're running mac you'll probably go
02:41 - with clang okay clang has a really cool
02:44 - logo it's blue eyes white dragon so
02:47 - let's get started
02:48 - well alright then everybody now we are
02:50 - going to download vs code that text
02:52 - editor i was talking about head to this
02:54 - url code.visualstudio.com
02:58 - then select the correct download for
03:00 - your operating system i'm running
03:01 - windows i'll select windows then i will
03:04 - open this
03:06 - read the agreement yes i actually did
03:08 - read it that fast i accept the agreement
03:11 - next
03:12 - next
03:14 - next
03:15 - i'll create a desktop icon why not next
03:19 - and install we might as well launch it
03:22 - finish
03:24 - in vs code there's two extensions i
03:26 - would recommend go to the left toolbar
03:28 - underneath extensions we will look up c
03:32 - c plus plus
03:34 - and we would like to download this
03:36 - extension uh let's pretend that this
03:38 - wasn't already installed so i'm going to
03:40 - install it
03:41 - then the next extension i recommend is
03:44 - code
03:44 - runner
03:47 - here it is
03:48 - then just click this blue button to
03:49 - install it
03:51 - okay let's close out of this
03:54 - we're going to create a new folder to
03:56 - hold our c plus projects go to the left
03:58 - toolbar explore
04:00 - open folder i'll create a new folder on
04:03 - my desktop
04:05 - new
04:05 - folder i'll name this c plus plus
04:09 - projects
04:10 - that sounds good to me
04:12 - then select folder within this folder
04:15 - we'll create a new file
04:17 - i'll name this hello world dot cpp make
04:21 - sure to get that cpp extension at the
04:24 - end that means it's a c plus file okay
04:27 - we now have a c plus plus file to work
04:29 - with now we just need to download that
04:31 - compiler that parses source code to
04:34 - machine instructions
04:36 - there's a great set of instructions at
04:38 - this url
04:41 - dot code.visualstudio.com slash docs
04:43 - let's head to c plus plus there's
04:46 - different installation instructions
04:47 - depending on your operating system
04:49 - you'll be downloading gcc on linux if
04:52 - you're running linux gcc on windows for
04:55 - windows and clang for mac os downloading
04:58 - a compiler for linux and mac is actually
05:01 - really easy i can cover that in like 30
05:03 - seconds windows is a little more
05:05 - complicated but let's begin with linux
05:08 - so all you're going to do is open up
05:10 - terminal and enter the following command
05:13 - gcc
05:14 - v that will check to see if it's
05:16 - currently installed
05:17 - if it's not you enter this command in
05:20 - then you install the gnu compiler tools
05:23 - by typing in this command right here and
05:25 - that's all you need to do with linux
05:28 - if you're on mac you'll download clang
05:32 - open terminal
05:33 - type in this command
05:35 - if clang isn't installed all you type is
05:37 - this command and that's it so pretty
05:40 - easy right if you're using the windows
05:42 - operating system there's way more steps
05:45 - so let's head to step three we'll need
05:48 - to install min gw64
05:51 - you can click this link to the installer
05:54 - this is an executable i'll open this
05:56 - when it's done
05:58 - click next
06:00 - next
06:02 - next
06:03 - wait for it
06:04 - we might as well run this
06:06 - then finish
06:08 - now we will follow the installation
06:09 - instructions on this website
06:14 - under step 5 we will type
06:17 - pack man
06:19 - dash
06:20 - capital s y u enter
06:32 - type y then enter to proceed with the
06:35 - installation
06:40 - type y then enter again to confirm to
06:42 - proceed
06:44 - now we'll need to find this program from
06:45 - the start menu
06:47 - m sys2
06:49 - then type this command
06:52 - pack man
06:53 - dash s u enter
06:57 - type y then enter to proceed with the
06:59 - installation
07:04 - now we'll need to enter this command in
07:08 - there's a lot to type here
07:11 - pac-man dash s
07:14 - dash dash needed
07:17 - base
07:18 - dash
07:20 - dev l
07:23 - min
07:24 - gw
07:26 - dash w
07:27 - 64
07:29 - dash
07:30 - x
07:32 - 86
07:33 - underscore
07:34 - 64
07:36 - dash
07:38 - tool
07:39 - chain
07:40 - then enter
07:42 - then just hit enter
07:44 - proceed with the installation type yes
07:47 - type y
07:48 - enter again
07:50 - then give it a moment
07:53 - then we can close out of this window
07:55 - we'll have to find the bin folder of
07:58 - mingw
08:00 - it's likely going to be within your c
08:02 - drive go to m64
08:06 - mingw64
08:08 - bin
08:09 - then copy this address
08:12 - we'll need to add that path to the
08:14 - windows path environment variable
08:17 - to do so search settings
08:20 - settings
08:24 - we'll search edit environment variables
08:32 - go to path
08:33 - edit
08:35 - let's pretend that this wasn't here
08:38 - i'm going to go to new
08:40 - paste that address
08:42 - okay
08:44 - okay
08:45 - close out of this window
08:47 - just to be sure that our compiler is
08:49 - working and available let's open up
08:51 - command prompt
08:52 - command prompt
08:56 - then type in this command
08:58 - g
08:58 - plus plus
09:00 - dash dash
09:01 - version
09:03 - enter
09:06 - yeah it looks like it's good to go we
09:07 - have now successfully installed our
09:09 - compiler
09:11 - all right everybody let's write our
09:12 - first c plus plus program at the top of
09:15 - our c plus file we are going to type
09:19 - include
09:20 - within angle brackets
09:22 - io
09:23 - stream io stream is a header file that
09:26 - contains functions for basic input and
09:29 - output operations by writing include
09:31 - iostream we're including that header
09:33 - file then we have access to a whole
09:35 - bunch of useful input and output
09:37 - operations now we'll need a main
09:39 - function the main function is where the
09:41 - program begins we'll type int
09:44 - main
09:45 - parentheses curly braces
09:47 - we begin the program by invoking the
09:49 - main function
09:50 - and read any code within the main
09:52 - function starting at the top and working
09:54 - our way down at the end of our main
09:56 - function we'll want return
09:59 - 0 then add a semicolon if we reach
10:02 - return 0 that means there were no
10:04 - problems in this program however if 1 is
10:07 - returned that means there was a problem
10:09 - there is an issue so place return 0 at
10:12 - the end of your main function what we'll
10:14 - do in this lesson is write some basic
10:15 - output to write some output you'll type
10:18 - std contrary to what you might believe
10:21 - in this case it doesn't mean sexually
10:23 - transmitted diseases it means standard
10:26 - follow std with two colons then type
10:30 - c out c means character out means output
10:34 - altogether this means standard character
10:37 - output we're going to display some
10:39 - characters as output then follow c out
10:42 - with two left angle brackets these
10:44 - characters mean output it's also known
10:46 - as the left shift operator when used
10:48 - with numbers what characters would we
10:50 - like to display as output within
10:52 - quotation marks let's write something
10:54 - what's a food you like
10:56 - i like pizza i'll type that then follow
11:00 - this statement with a semicolon at the
11:02 - end of statements we add a semicolon
11:04 - that lets the compiler know that this
11:06 - statement is done it's sort of like the
11:08 - period at the end of a sentence that's
11:10 - when you know the sentence is complete
11:12 - so i'm going to save this i'll hold ctrl
11:15 - s or you can go to file save then click
11:18 - this button to run it
11:20 - and there's my output i like pizza
11:23 - on the next line i'll type std
11:26 - two colons c out two left angle brackets
11:30 - for output i'll write a second line
11:34 - it's really
11:36 - good
11:38 - then i'll run this again you can press
11:40 - this icon to clear your output
11:43 - uh oh we have a problem i like pizza
11:46 - it's really good all of this text is on
11:48 - one line what if you need the next line
11:50 - of text to be on well the next line when
11:52 - you need to move your cursor down to the
11:54 - next line you can follow some string of
11:56 - text with
11:58 - double left angle brackets
12:00 - for output
12:02 - std
12:04 - colon colon
12:05 - en dl that means end line
12:09 - and i'll do the same for my second line
12:11 - i'm going to save clear my output run
12:14 - this again
12:15 - yeah there we go i like pizza it's
12:18 - really good each line of text is on a
12:20 - different line another option for a new
12:22 - line that's better performance wise
12:25 - is to add a new line character
12:27 - within single quotes type
12:29 - backslash n
12:31 - and let's replace that here as well
12:34 - so i'm going to save clear my output run
12:37 - this again
12:38 - i like pizza it's really good adding a
12:41 - new line character does the same thing
12:43 - and it's better performance wise however
12:45 - the benefit of using endline is that end
12:48 - line will flush the output buffer really
12:51 - you can use either one but i thought
12:52 - that might be a nice trick to show you
12:54 - now you can write a comment a comment is
12:56 - ignored by the compiler
12:58 - to write a comment you use two forward
13:00 - slashes
13:03 - this is a
13:04 - comment comments are used for yourself
13:07 - for notes or for notes for another
13:09 - developer so if i were to run this again
13:13 - this comment is ignored it's not used as
13:15 - output or anything like that if you need
13:17 - a multi-line comment you type forward
13:20 - slash asterisk wherever you need your
13:22 - comment to end you'll place asterisk
13:25 - forward slash again
13:27 - this
13:29 - is
13:30 - a
13:32 - multi-line
13:35 - comment
13:36 - and you can see that all of this is
13:38 - ignored as well so comments are used as
13:40 - notes for yourself or for other
13:42 - developers yeah that's a quick
13:44 - introduction to getting started with c
13:47 - plus plus i'll post this code in the
13:48 - comment section down below if you would
13:50 - like a copy hey if you enjoyed this
13:52 - video please be sure to smash that like
13:54 - button leave a random comment down below
13:56 - and subscribe if you'd like to become a
13:57 - fellow bro
