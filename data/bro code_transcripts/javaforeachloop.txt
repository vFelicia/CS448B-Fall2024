00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
00:01 - bro hope you're doing well and in this
00:02 - video i'm going to teach you guys all
00:04 - about the for each loop in java so sit
00:06 - back
00:07 - relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - make sure you like comment and subscribe
00:15 - one like equals one prayer for the
00:17 - youtube algorithm
00:18 - hey what's going on guys and gals in
00:20 - this video i'm going to explain
00:21 - the for each loop also known as an
00:24 - enhanced for loop
00:25 - this is a traversing technique to
00:27 - iterate through all the elements
00:29 - in an array or other collection the
00:31 - benefits
00:32 - is that a for each loop takes less steps
00:35 - and is more readable
00:37 - than a standard for loop however it is
00:39 - less flexible
00:40 - so let's begin by creating an array of
00:42 - animals so these will be animal names so
00:45 - the data type will be string
00:47 - then we need a set of straight brackets
00:49 - we will call this array animals
00:51 - equals and then we will assign a few
00:53 - values so within our array of animals
00:55 - let's say we have a cat
00:57 - a dog a rat and a bird
01:01 - i'm not sure what kind of bird just use
01:03 - your imagination now we could create a
01:05 - for loop to iterate
01:07 - once through each element of this array
01:09 - but we could also use a for each loop to
01:11 - do this
01:12 - so this is how to create a for each loop
01:16 - type 4 a set of parenthesis and then a
01:18 - set of curly braces
01:20 - so the only part that is different is
01:22 - the statements within
01:24 - the parentheses of the for loop we're
01:25 - going to begin by listing
01:27 - the data type of our array or other
01:29 - collection
01:30 - so we're going to list this as string
01:32 - because we're iterating through strings
01:35 - next we need an index let's say index i
01:38 - then colon colon represents the word
01:42 - in for every string index
01:45 - in our array of animals
01:48 - so lastly list the array or collection
01:51 - name
01:51 - at the end so this will iterate once for
01:54 - each index in our array of animals so
01:57 - what would we like to do
01:59 - within each iteration of this for each
02:01 - loop let's display whatever
02:03 - i is so this is going to be a string
02:06 - whatever this data type is
02:07 - so we can print this directly and when
02:10 - we run this
02:10 - our for each loop will display all the
02:13 - elements within
02:14 - our array and now let's try this for
02:16 - each loop using
02:17 - a collection an arraylist is a type of
02:20 - collection so let's create an array list
02:21 - called animals this time
02:23 - so array list within angle brackets
02:27 - we're going to list the data type which
02:29 - is string
02:30 - and then we will call this animals
02:34 - equals new array
02:38 - list angle brackets list the data type
02:41 - parentheses semicolon and then we'll
02:44 - need an
02:44 - import at the top import
02:47 - java.util.arraylist
02:48 - and then we need to add some values to
02:50 - each element of this arraylist
02:54 - animals.add we're going to add
02:56 - a cat then repeat the process for
03:01 - dog rat and bird
03:04 - dog
03:07 - rat and
03:10 - bird and you can see that nothing has
03:14 - changed
03:15 - so remember a for each loop is useful
03:17 - for iterating through all of the
03:19 - elements in an array or other collection
03:21 - it involves less steps and is more
03:23 - readable but it's
03:24 - less flexible compared to a standard for
03:27 - loop
03:28 - so that is everything you need to know
03:29 - to get started with the for
03:31 - each loop also known as the enhanced for
03:33 - loop
03:34 - if you would like a copy of all this
03:35 - code i will post all of this in the
