00:00 - hey everybody in this topic I'm going to
00:02 - show you how we can create alter and
00:04 - drop a database what is a database
00:06 - exactly think of it as a folder it acts
00:09 - as a container tables on the other hand
00:12 - would be the files found within the
00:14 - folder in this topic I'm going to show
00:16 - you how we can create the database
00:18 - itself but we won't be working with any
00:20 - tables until the next topic
00:22 - we'll need to begin by heading to our
00:24 - query window which is this large window
00:26 - right here we're going to write a
00:28 - statement to create a database we will
00:30 - type create there is no case sensitivity
00:33 - in MySQL these keywords such as create
00:36 - they can be all uppercase
00:39 - just the first letter could be capital
00:40 - or you could do all lowercase
00:43 - with the keywords I like to make them
00:45 - all uppercase but that's just me create
00:49 - database
00:50 - and then we'll need a unique database
00:52 - name what about my DB then it's
00:56 - important with all SQL statements to end
00:58 - each statement with a semicolon it's
01:01 - like the period at the end of a sentence
01:03 - that's how we know that the statement is
01:05 - complete so you'll need these three
01:07 - words create database then a database
01:10 - name we just named our database mydb hit
01:13 - this lightning bolt button to execute
01:15 - this statement
01:18 - and in my output window unfortunately I
01:20 - can't increase the font size but I can
01:22 - zoom in this action was successful
01:25 - we have created database mydb if you
01:28 - head to your schemas tab then hit the
01:31 - refresh button you should see a database
01:33 - in here named mydb
01:36 - there's also a database for sys sys is
01:39 - the internal database that MySQL uses
01:42 - we'll want to be sure that we're using
01:44 - the database that we just created to use
01:46 - a database we can either right click on
01:48 - the database
01:49 - then click on set as default schema or
01:53 - you could use a statement
01:54 - use
01:57 - then the name of the database my DB
01:59 - semicolon
02:01 - execute this statement
02:03 - we are now using my database to drop a
02:07 - database type drop
02:09 - database
02:11 - then the name of the database
02:13 - and our database is gone unfortunately
02:16 - we do need a database for this series so
02:18 - let's go ahead and recreate our database
02:21 - create database mydb
02:25 - refresh
02:27 - then just to be sure we're using this
02:29 - database we can either use that keyword
02:31 - use
02:33 - or you can right click on the database
02:34 - and set as default schema
02:37 - all right so we can create use and drop
02:39 - a database how about alter there's two
02:42 - features for beginners I'll mention
02:43 - setting a database to read only the
02:46 - other is enabling encryption let's set
02:48 - our database to be read-only type alter
02:52 - database
02:54 - the name of the database
02:57 - read only equals one this statement
03:02 - would make our database read only
03:05 - if a database is in read-only mode we
03:07 - can't make any modifications to it but
03:09 - we can still access the data Within
03:12 - let's attempt to drop our database drop
03:16 - database mydb
03:20 - uh then we have a red X right here that
03:23 - means we could not complete this action
03:24 - drop database my DB
03:27 - schema my DB is in read-only mode to
03:31 - disable read-only mode you would set
03:33 - read only equal to zero
03:37 - now we would be able to drop this
03:39 - database if
03:41 - all right everybody that is how to
03:42 - create use drop and alter a database
03:45 - think of a database as just a folder a
03:48 - folder can hold files the files will be
03:51 - the tables that we'll create which will
03:53 - store within the database and in the
03:55 - next topic I'll show you how we can
03:56 - create some tables
