00:00 - hey what's going on everybody today
00:01 - we're going to create some animations
00:03 - using CSS all right let's get started
00:06 - everybody we will create a development
00:09 - with an ID of box
00:12 - then within this box let's say the word
00:14 - hi
00:16 - let's go to our style sheet let's select
00:19 - our ID of box I will set the width to be
00:23 - 250 pixels
00:25 - the height to be 250 pixels
00:29 - I'll change the background color
00:31 - let's pick something red
00:37 - let's change the font size
00:40 - 13 em is fine
00:42 - then text align Center
00:46 - to use an animation we first need to
00:49 - create an animation using a keyframe
00:51 - rule that can be done with typing at
00:54 - keyframes then a unique animation name
00:57 - let's create an animation to slide this
01:00 - element from the right to the left the
01:02 - name will be slide left
01:05 - then add a set of curly braces
01:08 - within our keyframe there's a few
01:10 - possible values you have two
01:12 - from
01:14 - or a percent such as zero fifty
01:19 - 100 really any number we'll begin with a
01:22 - left translation for our element to end
01:26 - up in its resting position we will use
01:28 - from
01:29 - then add a set of curly braces just like
01:32 - we're adding CSS properties
01:34 - within our keyframe of from we will set
01:37 - the transform property to be an X
01:40 - translation translate x parentheses this
01:45 - can be an amount or a percent let's
01:48 - begin with 100 pixels
01:50 - so now I need to set the animation name
01:52 - property within our box
01:54 - animation name will be slide left
02:00 - but when I refresh everything nothing
02:02 - appears to happen that's because we need
02:04 - to set the animation duration property
02:07 - animation duration how long will this
02:10 - animation take to complete let's start
02:12 - with one second that's one s
02:16 - there's our slide animation
02:18 - feel free to adjust this value
02:20 - if I set this to be two seconds and
02:22 - slightly slower
02:24 - let's change translate X to a different
02:26 - value like 100 this element is
02:30 - translating on the x-axis by one hundred
02:33 - percent the width of the element if I
02:35 - were to set this to a larger number like
02:37 - 300
02:39 - it's going to appear off screen in my
02:40 - example then slide into place but that
02:43 - also depends on how far you're zoomed in
02:46 - or zoomed out and the with your web
02:48 - browser let's create an animation to
02:51 - slide right
02:52 - let's copy our keyframe rule
02:55 - rename slide left as slide right
02:59 - we'll use the value of 2. we'll begin in
03:02 - our original position we're setting this
03:04 - animation to end up in this position
03:06 - with our element translated to the right
03:10 - by 300 percent let's change the
03:12 - animation to slide right
03:14 - and now we slide to the right
03:16 - okay let's slide up
03:20 - keyframes slide up
03:24 - we'll set the value to be from
03:27 - then we will translate y
03:31 - change the animation name to slide up
03:34 - there we go
03:35 - then slide down all we really need to do
03:38 - is change this value
03:40 - so that's slide down change from to be
03:45 - two
03:46 - then change the animation name again
03:48 - slide down
03:52 - let's create a rotation animation
03:55 - at
03:56 - keyframes
03:58 - rotate
04:00 - so we can use from
04:02 - or to or a percent let's use percentages
04:06 - at one hundred percent what sort of
04:09 - transformation do we want to complete
04:13 - let's use the transform property then do
04:16 - an X rotation rotate X
04:19 - by 360 Degrees that's one full rotation
04:22 - okay let's change the animation name to
04:25 - rotate
04:27 - now we should rotate once on the x-axis
04:30 - let's rotate on the y-axis rotate y
04:35 - then rotate on the z-axis rotate Z
04:39 - so those are a few rotations now check
04:43 - this out if I were to set the keyframe
04:45 - value to be 50 we will complete this
04:47 - animation at the 50 Mark then from 50 to
04:52 - 100 in a way we undo the animation we'll
04:55 - rotate once and then revert back
04:58 - complete the animation at 50 of the
05:01 - length of the duration then with the
05:04 - other fifty percent of the time
05:05 - remaining return that element to where
05:07 - it was previously if I were to mess with
05:09 - these values let's say 25 percent will
05:12 - complete the animation in half a second
05:14 - then with the other 1.5 seconds we
05:17 - return to normal that's why the
05:18 - animation goes fast
05:20 - then when it's undone
05:22 - it goes fairly slow you can mess with
05:25 - these values depending on what you're
05:26 - looking for exactly yeah you can use
05:28 - from two or a percent okay let's create
05:32 - an animation to grow this element we'll
05:34 - scale both the width and the height at
05:37 - keyframes grow
05:40 - at the 100 mark
05:42 - let's set the transform property to be
05:47 - scale
05:48 - then we can use two values two means two
05:51 - hundred percent
05:52 - for the width scale that up by 200
05:55 - percent same with the height 200 percent
05:57 - let's change the animation to be grow
06:00 - then this should grow then when the
06:03 - animation is complete it snaps back into
06:05 - place but if I were to set this value to
06:07 - be 50 percent
06:09 - it's going to grow then shrink back into
06:12 - place in one smooth motion
06:14 - let's create an animation to shrink
06:17 - at keyframes
06:19 - shrink
06:22 - a 50 mark
06:25 - let's use the transform property
06:29 - then scale by 0.5 comma 0.5 that will be
06:34 - 50 for the width and the height let's
06:37 - change the animation name to be shrink
06:39 - and now we'll shrink this element
06:42 - then it reverts back into place
06:45 - okay let's change the opacity
06:47 - at keyframes this animation name will be
06:51 - fade
06:52 - at the 50 mark
06:55 - let's change the opacity we're not using
06:57 - the transform property this time let's
06:59 - set the opacity to be zero
07:03 - then change the animation name to be
07:05 - fade now we'll Fade Out then back in
07:07 - again
07:08 - if I were to set this value to be 100
07:11 - this element will fade
07:14 - then when the animation is normal it
07:16 - reverts not smoothly though
07:18 - let's set that to 50.
07:21 - now if you want a fade in effect what we
07:24 - can do is with our box
07:26 - originally we can set the opacity to be
07:28 - zero
07:31 - then add the 100 keyframe the opacity
07:35 - will then be one so this is fade in
07:38 - let's say
07:41 - so the element is originally hidden then
07:43 - it fades in
07:45 - let's get rid of the opacity
07:49 - let's change the color of our element
07:52 - at
07:53 - keyframes
07:55 - color change
07:57 - so at zero percent
08:00 - let's have the background color be red
08:03 - I'll copy the current background color
08:09 - I'll change the animation name too color
08:12 - change
08:14 - then at twenty percent
08:17 - let's set the background color to be
08:18 - orange
08:20 - foreign
08:23 - so we're going from red to orange
08:26 - then at 40 let's pick yellow
08:35 - 60 will be green
08:43 - 80 will be blue
08:52 - then 100 will be purple
09:01 - there
09:02 - you can take the Liberty to pick
09:04 - whatever values you would like
09:06 - let's create a glow effect around our
09:08 - element
09:10 - at keyframes glow
09:14 - this animation will complete at the 50
09:16 - mark
09:17 - we'll add a box shadow
09:20 - the first value is for the horizontal
09:23 - offset we'll set that to be zero
09:26 - the next value is for the vertical
09:29 - offset which will also be zero
09:31 - then the blur radius
09:33 - I'll set that to be 50 pixels
09:36 - then a color let's go with the yellowish
09:39 - color
09:43 - all right then we need to change the
09:44 - animation name
09:45 - glow
09:47 - then our element glows it's a little
09:49 - difficult to see though with the white
09:51 - background let me change the background
09:52 - color so with the body of our document I
09:55 - will set the background color to be a
09:59 - dark color
10:04 - there's our glow effect
10:06 - you can start animations with the pseudo
10:09 - class for example I want this glow
10:11 - animation to occur when I hover my
10:14 - cursor over the element
10:16 - I am selecting my box ID then applying
10:19 - the pseudo class of hover
10:24 - I'll take the animation name and the
10:26 - duration
10:27 - then place it within the Huber pseudo
10:29 - class for our box
10:30 - then this animation only begins when I
10:33 - hover my cursor over the Box
10:36 - pretty cool right
10:38 - if I were to use the active pseudo class
10:41 - this animation only occurs when I left
10:44 - click and hold the element which I am
10:47 - doing right now
10:49 - let's place these properties back
10:54 - to change the iteration count for an
10:57 - animation to have it occur more than
10:58 - once we can set the animation
11:01 - iteration count property
11:03 - to be some other value besides one if I
11:06 - set this value to be 2 we will perform
11:09 - this animation twice
11:13 - to have it perform infinitely set that
11:15 - to be infinite
11:19 - I would not recommend setting an
11:21 - animation to be infinite just because a
11:23 - viewer can find it annoying unless
11:25 - that's the goal to annoy the viewer
11:27 - alright there's also animation Direction
11:30 - animation
11:32 - Direction
11:35 - normally this is well normal
11:39 - we can change the direction of the
11:40 - animation by setting normal to be
11:42 - reverse
11:43 - now we're sliding to the right
11:48 - to alternate set the value to be
11:50 - alternate we're sliding left
11:53 - then sliding right
11:55 - then sliding left again
11:58 - there's also alternate reverse
12:01 - We Begin by sliding to the right then to
12:04 - the left
12:05 - and then to the right again
12:08 - let's set that to be normal
12:10 - to pause the animation we can set the
12:13 - animation
12:15 - play state to be paused
12:19 - now the animation is paused
12:22 - to run it again
12:23 - set this value to be running
12:26 - this would be useful in conjunction with
12:29 - the programming language such as
12:30 - JavaScript because we can toggle this
12:32 - animation on and off
12:35 - there's also the animation timing
12:38 - function
12:40 - normally with this animation it
12:42 - accelerates then slows down it
12:45 - decelerates
12:46 - the default value is is in out
12:53 - it speeds up then slows down before it
12:56 - reaches its destination
12:58 - for a constant speed we can change that
13:01 - to be linear
13:03 - through the entire animation duration it
13:06 - stays the same speed
13:09 - there's also steps for a sort of stop
13:12 - motion effect
13:14 - within this function if I place the
13:16 - value 5
13:19 - there's five steps
13:22 - if this was 10 there's 10 steps to
13:24 - complete the animation it creates a
13:26 - stop-motion effect let's change that
13:29 - back to ease and out
13:33 - let's set the iteration count to be one
13:35 - the next timing function is for cubic
13:38 - bezier let's right click on our box
13:40 - inspect
13:41 - underneath our Styles tab look for
13:44 - animation timing function
13:46 - if we were to click on this purple box
13:48 - we can change the timing function
13:51 - currently it's ease and out
13:53 - and there's a little sample animation at
13:55 - the top
13:56 - this is fast out linear in
13:59 - ease out
14:00 - or by dragging and dropping this line we
14:02 - can make something custom
14:04 - like I don't know what this does
14:07 - to use this animation copy this line of
14:10 - text for cubic bezier replace the
14:13 - animation timing function
14:15 - with that line of text
14:18 - so now we have that custom animation
14:21 - I don't really know what to name this
14:23 - animation let's name it the Electric
14:24 - Slide
14:26 - for a final exercise let's apply an
14:28 - animation to an image
14:30 - I just so happen to have an image of
14:32 - Shrek let's have Shrek perform our
14:35 - electric slide animation
14:38 - let's replace our box with an image
14:41 - element
14:42 - set the source to equal the relative
14:44 - file path
14:46 - so Shrek is right next to my index file
14:49 - shrek.png
14:51 - let's copy all of these animation
14:53 - properties
14:55 - cut them
14:58 - we'll select our image
15:01 - then paste those animation properties
15:05 - now Shrek will perform that Electric
15:06 - Slide animation
15:09 - pretty cool right
15:11 - all right everybody that is an
15:12 - introduction to animations using CSS
15:16 - foreign
