00:02 - hey let's talk about if statements if
00:04 - statements are used to add some choices
00:06 - to a program let's take the small
00:08 - program for example we have a variable
00:11 - edge and we'll ask a user to enter in
00:13 - their edge what if i would like to check
00:15 - their edge maybe they're signing up for
00:17 - a credit card or something so to check
00:19 - some value we can write an if statement
00:21 - if parentheses then a set of curly
00:24 - braces if some condition that we specify
00:27 - is true we will execute some block of
00:30 - code some subsection of code what sort
00:32 - of condition should we write let's check
00:34 - to see if age is greater than or equal
00:37 - to 18. so there's different comparison
00:40 - operators there's greater than or equal
00:42 - to
00:43 - greater than less than less than or
00:45 - equal to
00:46 - or you could check to see if two values
00:48 - are equal by using double equal signs
00:51 - this is the comparison operator if you
00:54 - use just one this is the assignment
00:56 - operator and this would be the same as
00:58 - assigning age equal to 18 so if you need
01:00 - to compare if two values are equal use
01:03 - the comparison operator which is double
01:06 - equal signs but what i would like to do
01:08 - is check to see if age is greater than
01:10 - or equal to 18. if this condition
01:13 - evaluates to be true we will have our
01:16 - program do something
01:17 - so let's print a message
01:20 - since we're signing up for a credit card
01:22 - let's say you are now signed up
01:26 - and let's run it
01:28 - end to your age let's say that i'm 21 i
01:31 - hit enter boom you are now signed up but
01:33 - what if this condition is false
01:35 - let's say that i'm 12 years old and i'm
01:37 - attempting to sign up for a credit card
01:39 - well we skip this if statement if this
01:41 - condition evaluates to be false we will
01:44 - skip this block of code and continue on
01:47 - with the rest of the program ignoring it
01:49 - or we could do something else by using
01:52 - an else statement if this condition is
01:54 - false we will skip this subset of code
01:57 - and instead perform this let's print a
02:00 - different message instead
02:02 - you are too young to sign up
02:07 - and let's try that again
02:09 - enter your edge i am 12.
02:12 - you are too young to sign up you can
02:14 - check more than one condition before
02:16 - reaching your else statement by using
02:18 - else if blocks and that is by using else
02:21 - if statements we can check another
02:23 - statement before reaching our else
02:25 - statement
02:26 - so let's check to see if age is less
02:29 - than zero so obviously somebody's
02:31 - messing with this program then because
02:33 - you can't be under zero years old right
02:35 - you
02:36 - haven't been
02:38 - born yet
02:39 - so after running this program if i say
02:41 - that i'm negative
02:43 - six
02:45 - you haven't been born yet so we will
02:47 - check our if statement first if this
02:49 - condition is false we will move down to
02:51 - the next block and then check this else
02:54 - if condition if all above statements
02:56 - evaluate to be false we will execute
02:58 - this else block as the last resort so to
03:00 - say and with these else if blocks you
03:02 - can add more than one let's check
03:04 - something else
03:05 - just to demonstrate
03:08 - else if
03:09 - what about age is equal to zero
03:13 - and we will print
03:16 - you can't sign up
03:19 - you were just born
03:24 - and to your age i am zero years old
03:27 - you can't sign up you were just born if
03:29 - one of these conditions evaluates to be
03:31 - true we will skip all of these
03:33 - statements that come after then with our
03:35 - else block if all above statements
03:37 - evaluate to be false we definitely
03:39 - execute whatever's within here
03:41 - so yeah those are if statements they add
03:44 - some choice to a program you can check
03:46 - to see if some condition is true if not
03:48 - you can check something else using else
03:50 - if statements you can perform whatever
03:52 - is within an else block and that's
03:54 - optional so yeah those are if statements
03:56 - in c if you found this video helpful
