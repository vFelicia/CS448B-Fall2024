00:00 - hey y'all what's going on everybody in
00:02 - this video i'm going to show you how we
00:03 - can add color to a webpage so sit back
00:06 - relax and enjoy the show
00:10 - all right now here's how we can add
00:12 - color to a web page we'll be talking a
00:14 - little bit about css but we'll cover
00:16 - this more in depth in the css series i
00:19 - thought this would be a good place for
00:21 - us to introduce colors because we'll be
00:23 - able to color things like buttons and
00:25 - forms and whatnot here's how to add some
00:27 - color to a webpage within the opening
00:30 - tag of an element of your choosing
00:32 - there is a style attribute and within
00:35 - double quotes we can add css properties
00:38 - for my website i would like to change
00:40 - the background color to black because i
00:42 - think it would look cool so within
00:44 - double quotes list the css property you
00:46 - would like to change background color
00:49 - after the colon you can either add a
00:51 - color name rgb values or hexadecimal
00:55 - values let's just say the color black
00:57 - there we go we can no longer see my
00:59 - website let's change the font color of
01:01 - these individual h1 header tags again
01:04 - it's the same process as before
01:06 - style
01:07 - equals
01:08 - within double quotes list the css
01:11 - property you would like to add
01:13 - i would like to add color this time to
01:15 - change the font color and i will pick
01:18 - red there we go this time let's use rgb
01:22 - values
01:23 - so again style attribute equals the css
01:26 - property would like to change
01:29 - to instead use an rgb value type rgb
01:33 - parenthesis then i would recommend
01:35 - looking up a color picker
01:37 - and you can pick a color of whatever you
01:39 - would like uh what about blue
01:42 - perhaps that shade of blue so rgb values
01:46 - are in a group of three a triad so i
01:49 - will copy these three numbers and paste
01:51 - them within the parentheses of rgb and
01:55 - the second h1 header tag is now that
01:57 - specific shade of blue i tend to prefer
02:00 - to use rgb values or hexadecimal values
02:03 - over color names because you have more
02:05 - variety now let's use hexadecimal values
02:08 - style equals the css property
02:12 - of color
02:14 - so hexadecimal values always start with
02:16 - a hashtag what about green
02:20 - so we'll have red blue and green and i
02:22 - will copy this number they are in groups
02:25 - of six and well yeah it's green now cool
02:28 - right okay now let's change both the
02:31 - font color and the background color of
02:33 - this paragraph within the opening tag of
02:36 - this paragraph element
02:38 - we will set the style attribute equal
02:41 - to any css properties within double
02:43 - quotes
02:44 - let's change the background color first
02:47 - background
02:49 - dash color colon space
02:51 - i'll set this to
02:53 - dark gray which is
02:55 - 2 2 2
02:57 - 2 2 2 then to add multiple css
03:00 - properties separate each with a
03:01 - semicolon and this time i will change
03:04 - just the color and i'll use the same
03:07 - shade of green alright well there we go
03:09 - so yeah everybody that's how to add some
03:11 - colors to your webpage there's more
03:13 - advanced things we can do when we reach
03:15 - the video series on css but what you can
03:18 - do for now within the opening tag of an
03:21 - element of your choosing set the style
03:23 - attribute equal
03:25 - to whatever css properties you would
03:27 - like to add within quotes so yeah that's
