00:00 - hey it's you bro hope you're doing well
00:01 - and in this video we're going to be
00:03 - discussing borders in CSS so let's get
00:05 - into it
00:08 - to kick off this lesson we're going to
00:10 - need some sample text I'm going to
00:12 - create a heading and then a paragraph so
00:14 - I'll use an h1 header tag and I will
00:17 - call this boarder demo and then we're
00:21 - going to close this next we'll add a
00:23 - paragraph we'll just need some sample
00:26 - text to work with if you're using
00:27 - sublime text you can just type in lorem
00:29 - and hit tab then you'll have a sample
00:31 - paragraph to work with and I'm going to
00:33 - surround this with a pair of paragraph
00:35 - tags let's save this reload the page
00:38 - that'll be good for now so I have a
00:41 - style sheet that's linked to this HTML
00:44 - file so that was covered in the first
00:47 - lesson for this CSS tutorial series so
00:50 - let's get on to creating borders the
00:52 - first thing that we want to do is to
00:54 - create a border perhaps around this
00:56 - paragraph so we'll want to target the P
01:00 - tag the paragraph tag and then we'll add
01:02 - a set of curly brackets so there's
01:05 - different styles of border and you'll
01:07 - want to specify what kind of border that
01:09 - you want let's start with something
01:11 - simple just a plain solid border so to
01:14 - add a border you're going to type border
01:17 - - style colon and then the type of style
01:21 - that you want for this border I'll
01:23 - showcase a few of these but let's begin
01:25 - with a simple solid border so let's save
01:28 - this refresh the page and we have a
01:30 - border around our targeted HTML element
01:33 - now if you were to take a look at this
01:35 - paragraph you'll notice that the text is
01:37 - very close to the border and it might be
01:40 - difficult to read some of the letters so
01:42 - there's this property in CSS called
01:44 - padding it's the distance between the
01:48 - text and the border so by default it's
01:51 - set to 0 so we can actually add some
01:54 - space between the text and the border
01:56 - think of it like you know when you get a
01:57 - package from like Amazon or in the mail
01:59 - there's like bubble wrap or packing
02:02 - peanuts within the box it's between your
02:05 - item and the actual box itself it's the
02:08 - padding between the text and the border
02:12 - so let's create a padding property and
02:16 - let's give us five pixels of room so I'm
02:19 - going to type five px for pixels
02:21 - I'll save this reload the page now we
02:24 - have some distance between the text and
02:26 - the border and I find that easier to
02:28 - read if we want something ridiculous
02:30 - like 50 pixels you know we can do that
02:33 - although this probably doesn't look too
02:36 - great but it might be useful for
02:37 - something so like I said padding is the
02:41 - distance between the text and the border
02:43 - think of it like you receive a package
02:45 - the text is the item the box is the
02:49 - border and the padding is like the
02:51 - styrofoam packing peanuts or bubble wrap
02:54 - that's between your item and the box but
02:58 - in this case it's the text and the
02:59 - border I hope that makes sense all right
03:01 - so let's cover a few other styles so
03:03 - this was a solid border but I don't want
03:06 - this much padding between my text and
03:09 - the border so let's just stick with five
03:11 - for now I think that's decent so I'm
03:13 - going to cover a few different border
03:14 - styles and some of these might pique
03:17 - your interests so border style : and
03:21 - then let's go with a perhaps dashed
03:24 - border so let's save reload so we have
03:28 - this nice dashed border around our text
03:32 - this border somewhat reminds me of like
03:34 - a coupon in an ad or something where you
03:36 - cut along the dash border to take out
03:39 - the coupon from the ad or something I
03:41 - don't know maybe if you're making a
03:42 - website that has printable coupons you
03:44 - can create a dash border around each
03:46 - coupon oh and one thing that I want to
03:48 - mention before I forget with CSS
03:50 - properties if you have multiple values
03:53 - assigned to the same property you'll
03:55 - actually end up using the most recent
03:57 - value that's assigned to that specific
04:00 - property for example we have two border
04:02 - styles solid and dashed well it's the
04:05 - same property but we're going to end up
04:07 - using the most recently assigned value
04:09 - which is dashed like if I were to switch
04:12 - these around and I were to place dashed
04:14 - first and then solid we would actually
04:17 - end up using the solid border because
04:19 - that was the value that was last
04:21 - assigned to that property so for this
04:23 - example I'll be showing a bunch of
04:26 - different border styles and I'll just
04:28 - have them all listed here but it's only
04:30 - going to be displaying the most recently
04:32 - assigned value so let's cover a few
04:35 - border styles and you might like some of
04:36 - these so we're going to type border
04:39 - style and this next one is the dotted
04:43 - border style so this is what it looks
04:46 - like
04:47 - we have border style double and this is
04:56 - a double border I think I'm just gonna
04:59 - copy this to save a little bit of time
05:01 - so border style Ridge so that one looks
05:08 - like it has a shadow around it which is
05:10 - kind of cool
05:12 - border style groove like it's groovy
05:16 - like we're in the 70s that's pretty much
05:18 - the same but it's slightly darker border
05:22 - style inset and this has a 3d effect
05:26 - it's kind of like it's pushed in like a
05:28 - button or something and the inverse of
05:31 - this is outset and it has a 3d pop-out
05:36 - effect of some sort this one I would say
05:38 - is my favorite because it's kind of like
05:40 - it's 3d so those are a few of the border
05:43 - styles let's discuss the border width
05:46 - property so we can increase the width of
05:49 - the border so a border - width and maybe
05:54 - let's assign 3 pixels to the width of
05:56 - this so 3 px and the border is slightly
06:01 - thicker so if you're using like an inset
06:04 - or outset border it actually looks like
06:06 - it's popping out of the screen slightly
06:09 - more if we did a - border this is
06:12 - obviously going to be a thicker line so
06:15 - that's the border width property now you
06:18 - can actually assign a few different
06:20 - widths and here's an example let's say 3
06:24 - pixels 5 pixels 3 pixels 5 pixels so
06:29 - let's see what this looks like first and
06:31 - then I'll explain this so if you have a
06:34 - border width with 4 different values the
06:37 - first value is going to apply to the
06:39 - northern top border the second is the
06:42 - right eastern border the third one is
06:46 - South or the bottom
06:48 - the fourth one is the left border or
06:51 - West one so you can either assign four
06:54 - different values you can have them all
06:57 - be the same otherwise you can just
06:59 - assign one universally to all sides so
07:02 - for this example I'll just keep five
07:04 - pixels so it's all the same size then
07:06 - all right let's change the border color
07:09 - so border - color you can either just
07:13 - type in a generic name such as green
07:16 - another option is to use a hexadecimal
07:18 - value you can look those up online if
07:21 - there's a specific color you like I
07:22 - think I will pick the color 0 0 FF 0 0
07:27 - which is a bright green color so let's
07:30 - save this reload the page and this
07:32 - border is now a very bright green color
07:35 - now there's another property called
07:37 - border radius the radius will give you a
07:40 - rounded borders kind of like they're
07:42 - smooth but these borders are very sharp
07:44 - right now so border - radius so if we
07:49 - were to assign maybe a 1 pixel radius
07:52 - this will slightly smooth out the edges
07:57 - of the border it's a little bit
07:59 - difficult to see if it's just one pick
08:01 - so let's try something more drastic like
08:03 - 5 pixels so you can see that the borders
08:06 - are much more smooth now let's try maybe
08:09 - 10 that might be a lot more noticeable
08:12 - yeah 10 is very noticeable these corners
08:14 - are no longer sharp it's kind of like
08:16 - you filed the corners down so that's
08:19 - kind of what the border radiuses you're
08:21 - smoothing out the edges of this so
08:23 - that's a basic border that you can use
08:25 - around whatever element that you want so
08:27 - with our header tag let's get a little
08:30 - crazy we can target specific sides of
08:33 - your border so let's target the h1
08:35 - header tag and the first thing that we
08:37 - can do is that let's target a like
08:41 - bottom border perhaps so if you want to
08:43 - target a specific side of the border
08:46 - you'll type in border - perhaps bottom
08:49 - otherwise there's top left and right but
08:55 - let's target the bottom for now and
08:57 - let's set the style to perhaps
09:02 - maybe dotted oh but make sure you spell
09:06 - border right not bored bored or there
09:09 - we're good alright so we have a single
09:12 - bottom border to this h1 element let's
09:15 - do the same thing from the top so I'll
09:17 - just copy that and we're going to change
09:20 - bottom to top let's save reload alright
09:23 - so we have a border that only has two
09:25 - sides it doesn't have a left side or a
09:27 - right side let's target the left side
09:30 - perhaps so border left style let's do
09:35 - something different perhaps solid
09:39 - alright we're getting somewhere
09:41 - and let's target the width of just the
09:44 - left border so you're actually able to
09:47 - do that border - then it is left - with
09:53 - maybe 10 pixels so you can individually
09:58 - change the sizes or width of a single
10:02 - side of your border you just have to
10:04 - list it specifically otherwise if you do
10:07 - just border style it applies to all
10:09 - sides so you also have the capability to
10:11 - color an individual side of your border
10:14 - let's say we want to color just this
10:16 - left border will type in border - left -
10:20 - color and we can assign a color to this
10:23 - I will pick the hexadecimal value of 0 0
10:26 - FF 0 0 that was the bright green color
10:30 - that we had before but taking a look at
10:33 - this I actually don't like it on second
10:35 - thought maybe I'll switch this to a
10:36 - different color but point being you do
10:39 - have the capability to colored
10:41 - individual side of your border
10:42 - alright well with the time remaining
10:44 - let's make the rest of this light
10:46 - actually look cool so let's target the
10:48 - body and add a background color so
10:50 - background - color and I'm just going to
10:54 - pick black let's take our text which is
10:59 - just color and let's change this to
11:02 - white alright and then with our border
11:05 - for the h1 header tag
11:07 - let's perhaps make this white so that is
11:11 - border color
11:15 - white alright let's see what this looks
11:18 - like I would say that's pretty decent
11:21 - for a beginners website that looks
11:23 - pretty cool but yeah that is pretty much
11:26 - this lesson on borders in CSS if you
11:29 - would like a copy of this markup I'll
11:31 - post it in the comments down below and
11:32 - pin it to the top but yeah that is how
11:35 - borders work in CSS hey you if you
11:39 - enjoyed this lesson then you can help me
11:41 - help you in three easy steps
