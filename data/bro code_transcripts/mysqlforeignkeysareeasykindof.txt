00:00 - hey everybody so in this topic I'm going
00:02 - to explain what the foreign key
00:03 - constraint is a foreign key think of it
00:06 - as a primary key from one table that can
00:09 - be found within a different table using
00:11 - a foreign key we can establish a link
00:14 - between two tables there's two primary
00:16 - benefits to this in my transactions
00:19 - table if I were to take a look at the
00:21 - customer idea of who initiated this
00:23 - transaction I could refer to the
00:25 - customers table then find the first and
00:27 - last name of that customer we can do
00:30 - that when we reach the topic of joins
00:32 - but in this video we're going to focus
00:34 - more or less on just creating foreign
00:36 - Keys another benefit when you create a
00:38 - foreign key constraint that would create
00:40 - a link between two tables which prevents
00:43 - any actions that would destroy that link
00:46 - between them so here's an example I have
00:48 - three tables employees products and
00:50 - transactions I'm going to create a new
00:52 - table of customers I'm going to create
00:54 - this table and speed it up feel free to
00:57 - pause the video if you need to
01:11 - here's my table we have a customer ID
01:14 - which is the primary key a first name
01:16 - and a last name let's populate our
01:19 - customers table
01:35 - we have three customers Fred fish Larry
01:38 - Lobster bubble bass each has a unique
01:40 - customer ID we're going to create a link
01:43 - between our customers table and our
01:45 - transactions table via our customer ID
01:48 - I'm going to drop our table transactions
01:51 - drop table transactions
01:54 - we will recreate this table but apply
01:56 - that foreign key constraint so again
01:59 - I'll speed up the footage
02:11 - now what I'm going to do is create a
02:12 - third column to hold our customer ID
02:19 - and the data type isn't I would like to
02:21 - add a foreign key constraint to our
02:23 - customer ID column
02:25 - on the next line
02:27 - I will type
02:28 - foreign key list the column we're
02:31 - applying this foreign key constraint too
02:33 - within parentheses customer ID
02:37 - references
02:39 - our second table the customers table
02:43 - customers
02:44 - then the column of the primary key which
02:47 - was customer
02:49 - ID and that's all you need to do
02:52 - then I will select all from my table
02:55 - transactions
02:59 - here is our table
03:01 - we have a transaction ID this is the
03:03 - primary key the amount of the
03:05 - transaction then the customer ID of who
03:08 - initiated that transaction our customer
03:11 - ID column is the foreign key it points
03:13 - to the customers table based on what the
03:16 - customer ID is we can find the first and
03:18 - last name of that customer to find any
03:20 - active foreign keys
03:22 - go to your table in this case
03:23 - transactions underneath foreign keys
03:26 - this section will display any foreign
03:28 - keys that are applied to this table we
03:30 - currently have one
03:31 - transactions underscore ibfk underscore
03:35 - one
03:36 - if you need to drop a foreign key you
03:38 - would type alter table the name of the
03:42 - table that has the foreign key
03:43 - constraint that would be transactions
03:48 - drop
03:49 - foreign key then the name of this
03:52 - foreign key
03:55 - transactions underscore
03:58 - ibfk underscore one
04:04 - and that foreign key should be gone
04:07 - you could also give your foreign key a
04:09 - unique name
04:11 - alter table the name of the table
04:14 - add
04:15 - constraint
04:17 - then some unique name let's rename that
04:20 - constraint as FK underscore
04:24 - customer
04:25 - ID
04:29 - foreign
04:30 - key
04:32 - the name of the column customer ID
04:37 - references
04:39 - the name of the second table
04:41 - customers then the column that has the
04:44 - primary key
04:45 - customer
04:47 - ID
04:48 - so to apply a foreign key to a table
04:51 - that already exists this would be the
04:53 - syntax you don't necessarily need to
04:56 - name the constraint
04:57 - but if you would like to just add that
04:59 - line add constraint then some unique
05:02 - name
05:03 - let's add this foreign key constraint to
05:05 - a table that already exists
05:07 - it worked if I were to refresh my
05:10 - navigator window we now have a foreign
05:12 - key and it's the one that we gave a name
05:14 - to foreign key customer ID
05:18 - what we're going to do is drop the rows
05:20 - from our transactions table then
05:22 - reinsert them but we will add a value
05:24 - for each foreign key
05:26 - so let's get rid of this
05:29 - delete from transactions
05:35 - then select all from
05:38 - transactions
05:41 - here we are okay so let's insert some
05:43 - new rows
05:45 - I do want to set auto increment to be a
05:48 - thousand so I'm going to do that before
05:49 - we insert some rows alter table
05:53 - transactions
05:55 - Auto
05:57 - increment equals one thousand
06:01 - so let's take a look at transactions
06:07 - then we will insert some new rows
06:10 - insert into
06:12 - transactions
06:15 - R values
06:19 - we had four transactions
06:25 - we will need an amount and the customer
06:30 - ID of who initiated the transaction
06:33 - the first order is for 4.99
06:36 - customer number three initiated this
06:38 - transaction
06:39 - the second order is 289
06:43 - customer number two initiated that
06:45 - transaction
06:47 - 338
06:49 - this is also customer three they
06:51 - returned back the same day
06:54 - 4.99
06:55 - customer number one initiated that
06:57 - transaction
06:59 - we have our primary key from the
07:01 - transactions table as well as our
07:03 - foreign key
07:04 - each of these customer IDs references
07:07 - the customer ID column from the
07:09 - customers table we won't get to explore
07:12 - that until we reach the topic on joins
07:14 - so the other benefit of a foreign key
07:16 - constraint is that we now have a link
07:18 - between our transactions table and to
07:20 - the customers table MySQL will prevent
07:23 - any actions that would destroy that link
07:25 - between them unless we explicitly drop
07:28 - that foreign key constraint I'm going to
07:30 - delete some of our customers
07:33 - delete from customers
07:38 - where
07:40 - customer
07:41 - ID equals three
07:45 - we were right it doesn't appear that we
07:47 - can do so cannot delete or update a
07:49 - parent row a foreign key constraint
07:52 - fails
07:54 - so yeah that's the foreign key
07:55 - constraint it's a primary key from one
07:58 - table that's found also within a
08:00 - different table but when we're working
08:02 - with that different table we would refer
08:04 - to that key as a foreign key we'll have
08:07 - more practice with this when we reach
08:09 - the topic on joins but yeah that is the
08:11 - foreign key constraint in MySQL
