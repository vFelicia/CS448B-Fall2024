00:02 - hey again it's me so we're going to talk
00:04 - about the or logical operator the or
00:08 - logical operator which is represented by
00:10 - two vertical bars checks if at least one
00:13 - condition is true let's take the small
00:15 - program for example it's kind of similar
00:17 - to the last video so we have a variable
00:20 - named temperature for temperature we
00:22 - will first check if temp is less than or
00:25 - equal to zero if that's true we will
00:27 - print the weather is bad
00:29 - else if temp is greater than or equal to
00:32 - 30 the weather is bad else the weather
00:35 - is good so you know this program does
00:37 - work the weather is good but another way
00:40 - of writing this is that we can use the
00:42 - or logical operator and we can check to
00:44 - see if at least one of two or more
00:47 - conditions is true so let's take this
00:50 - condition
00:51 - get rid of this else if statement
00:54 - so we will check to see if temp is less
00:56 - than or equal to zero
00:58 - or
00:59 - temp is greater than or equal to thirty
01:02 - so if our temperature is negative one
01:05 - thousand degrees celsius then the
01:07 - weather is bad
01:09 - this is true but this is false and using
01:11 - the or logical operator only one of
01:14 - these conditions needs to be true if
01:16 - both are true that's fine as well or our
01:19 - temperature could be positive 1000
01:21 - degrees celsius the weather is also bad
01:23 - this is false and this is true and only
01:26 - one of these conditions needs to be true
01:29 - but if our temperature is 25 well
01:32 - neither of these conditions are true at
01:34 - least one condition needs to be true in
01:37 - order to execute the statement so yeah
01:39 - that is the or logical operator it
01:42 - checks to see if at least one condition
01:44 - is true and you can check more than one
01:47 - condition by adding another set of
01:49 - vertical bars for the or operator so if
