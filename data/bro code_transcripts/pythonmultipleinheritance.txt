00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:02 - bro hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video i'm going to show you all how
00:04 - multiple inheritance works in python so
00:07 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - if you find this video helpful please

00:20 - all right people multiple inheritance
00:22 - multiple inheritance is the concept
00:24 - where a child class
00:26 - is derived from more than one parent
00:28 - class
00:29 - here's an example let's say that all of
00:31 - our children classes are going to be
00:33 - certain types of animals and we would
00:35 - like our animal classes
00:37 - to inherit from either the prepared
00:39 - class
00:40 - the predator parent class or both
00:42 - depending on what type of animal it is
00:44 - because some animals in the animal
00:46 - kingdom can be both prey
00:48 - and predators and one example that comes
00:50 - to mind would be fish
00:52 - fish will eat smaller fish but also can
00:54 - get eaten by
00:55 - larger fish so here we have two classes
00:58 - prey and predator
00:59 - each has a dedicated method if a class
01:02 - inherits from
01:02 - the prey parent class they will have
01:04 - access to a flea method
01:06 - which will print this animal please if a
01:09 - class inherits from the predator parent
01:11 - class
01:12 - that class will have access to a hunt
01:14 - method that will print
01:16 - this animal as hunting and it's possible
01:18 - that some animals can do both
01:19 - they can both flee and hunt but they'll
01:22 - need to inherit both of these classes
01:24 - both prey and predator and that's where
01:26 - multiple inheritance comes in
01:28 - now let's create some classes based on
01:29 - certain types of animals
01:31 - let's say we have class rabbit and
01:33 - rabbit we'll inherit from the prey class
01:35 - because
01:36 - rabbits are typically prey and not
01:38 - predators but i don't know there could
01:39 - be some killer rabbits out there
01:41 - haven't run into any yet let's have
01:43 - class hawk inherit from the
01:46 - predator class and lastly fish
01:50 - and fish can be both prey and predators
01:53 - so they will inherit from both classes
01:55 - and we just separate each class with a
01:56 - comma so prey
01:58 - comma predator and it's as simple as
02:01 - that
02:02 - now let's create an object from each of
02:03 - these classes we have rabbit
02:06 - equals rabbit hawk
02:10 - equals hawk and fish
02:13 - equals fish now let's just verify
02:17 - all of the different methods that each
02:18 - of these objects inherited
02:20 - so our rabbit should have access to a
02:22 - flea method
02:23 - but no hunt method and let's just test
02:27 - that
02:27 - yep this animal flees and my hawk object
02:31 - should have access to a hunt method but
02:33 - no flea method
02:36 - this animal is hunting and lastly
02:39 - my fish object has access to both a flea
02:42 - and a hunt method and if you take a look
02:44 - on the right hand side of this pop-up
02:46 - window it shows the class that it
02:48 - inherited this method from
02:49 - so flea comes from the parent class of
02:52 - prey and hunt comes from the apparent
02:54 - class of predator
02:55 - so my fish can both flee and hunt
02:58 - because it's typically considered both
03:00 - prey and predators this animal flees
03:04 - this animal is hunting
03:06 - so that's basically what multiple
03:08 - inheritance is it's a concept where a
03:10 - child
03:10 - class is derived from more than one
03:13 - parent class
03:14 - so that's basically multiple inheritance
03:16 - i'll post all of this code to the
03:18 - comment section down below
03:19 - and well yeah that's how multiple
03:21 - inheritance works
03:22 - in python
