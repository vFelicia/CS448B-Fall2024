00:02 - all right welcome back everybody in this
00:04 - video we're going to create a simple
00:06 - number guessing game let's declare our
00:08 - variables int num our number will be
00:11 - randomly generated
00:13 - and guess
00:14 - this variable will hold the current
00:16 - player guess
00:18 - and
00:19 - tries how many tries is it going to take
00:21 - for the user to guess the correct number
00:23 - we'll be using the sran function to
00:25 - generate some random numbers
00:28 - pass in time
00:29 - pass and null
00:31 - we will assign our variable num
00:33 - a random number between 1 and 100
00:36 - rand function
00:39 - modulus 100
00:42 - then add one
00:44 - this function will give us a random
00:46 - number between one and one hundred start
00:48 - with the num
00:49 - just for some decorations i'm going to
00:51 - create a title for this game
00:56 - number guessing game
01:01 - then add a new line
01:04 - i'll place all of this code within a do
01:06 - while loop
01:07 - do
01:09 - while
01:11 - our guess does not equal num we will
01:15 - have the user type in another guess
01:17 - we'll create a prompt
01:19 - standard
01:20 - output
01:22 - enter a guess
01:25 - between
01:28 - 1
01:28 - through 100
01:35 - standard input
01:38 - guess
01:39 - once the user types in a guess we will
01:41 - increment our tries variable by one to
01:44 - keep track of the score
01:47 - now we'll have to examine the guess
01:49 - versus the number
01:53 - if
01:55 - guess
01:56 - is greater than num
01:59 - let's display
02:04 - too
02:04 - high
02:06 - i'll add a new line
02:10 - else if
02:14 - guess is
02:15 - less than num
02:18 - then we'll display
02:22 - to
02:23 - low
02:25 - else
02:27 - if the guess is not above the number and
02:29 - the guess is not below the number the
02:31 - guess must be equal to the number
02:35 - standard
02:36 - output
02:40 - correct
02:42 - we'll display the number of tries
02:44 - number of tries
02:48 - we'll display our tries variable
02:52 - i'll add a new line
02:57 - and i'll just add a line of text for
02:58 - decoration at the bottom once we exit
03:00 - the game
03:05 - that should be everything let's run this
03:08 - number guessing game i'll guess
03:10 - something right in the middle 50
03:12 - too low
03:14 - okay so the number is between 50 and
03:15 - 100.
03:17 - i'll guess right in the middle of that
03:18 - range 75
03:20 - too high
03:21 - something between 50 and 75
03:24 - perhaps 62
03:26 - that's still too high
03:28 - 56
03:30 - too high
03:31 - 53
03:32 - too low
03:34 - 54.
03:36 - 55.
03:38 - all right the correct guess was 55 it
03:41 - took me seven tries
03:42 - i don't really think that's too good but
03:45 - it works okay everybody that is a simple
03:48 - number guessing game involving the use
03:50 - of do while loops and generating random
03:52 - numbers
03:53 - if you would like a copy of this code
03:55 - i'll post this in the comment section
