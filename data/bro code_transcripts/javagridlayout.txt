00:00 - what's going on everybody it's your bro
00:02 - here hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video i'm going to teach you guys all
00:05 - about
00:05 - grid layouts in java so sit back relax
00:08 - and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:13 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:16 - help keep this channel running
00:18 - all right everybody let's discuss the
00:21 - grid layout manager
00:22 - so this places components in a grid of
00:25 - cells
00:25 - in a number of rows and columns with
00:28 - each component taking all of the
00:30 - available space
00:31 - within itself and each cell is the same
00:34 - size
00:34 - so to begin we'll need a frame we're
00:36 - going to add buttons
00:38 - to our frame the frame is going to have
00:40 - a grid
00:41 - layout so to create a frame like always
00:43 - we just say jframe we give it a name
00:45 - like frame
00:46 - equals new jframe frame dot set default
00:48 - close operation jframe makes it on close
00:51 - give it a size the size doesn't matter
00:53 - and frame dot set visible to true
00:55 - so let's create a whole bunch of buttons
00:57 - i don't know how many
00:58 - maybe nine so to create a button we just
01:01 - type in
01:01 - j button we can give this a name like
01:03 - button one equals new
01:05 - j button and then when we instantiate
01:07 - this we can set some text to the button
01:09 - so let's just
01:10 - pass in one and then we can add this
01:13 - button to the frame so frame
01:15 - dot add button one
01:18 - so there's a shortcut you can do that we
01:20 - learned in the last video on flow layout
01:22 - managers
01:23 - this will still work but just to save
01:25 - time i'm going to
01:26 - shorten the lines of code that we have
01:28 - to write so instead of creating a button
01:30 - with
01:30 - a name we can create an anonymous button
01:33 - so all we need to pass
01:35 - in when we add this component to the
01:36 - frame is
01:38 - instead a new j button and then you can
01:41 - set the text right away too
01:43 - the other way works just fine that just
01:45 - requires more lines of code but
01:46 - do what you prefer i'm just shortening
01:48 - this to save some time for us
01:50 - so we're going to add a bunch of buttons
01:53 - to the frame to
01:54 - demonstrate a grid layout so i'm going
01:56 - to create
01:57 - nine separate buttons all of them will
01:59 - be numbered
02:00 - and once you have a whole bunch of
02:02 - buttons it doesn't matter how many we're
02:04 - ready to move on
02:05 - with frames by default they use a border
02:08 - layout manager so the components like to
02:11 - take up as much
02:12 - room as possible so with this button
02:15 - this number nine but it's taking up the
02:17 - entire frame and all the other buttons
02:19 - are hidden underneath
02:20 - so we need to change the layout manager
02:23 - that we're using
02:24 - for the containing class which is our
02:25 - frame so frame
02:27 - dot set layout and we're going to pass
02:30 - in a layout manager which layout manager
02:33 - a
02:33 - new grid layout well because that's what
02:36 - we're learning about
02:37 - and when we run this all of these
02:39 - components all of these buttons
02:41 - are all arranged in one row and
02:45 - one column for each component that we
02:46 - have but
02:48 - we can specify the amount of rows and
02:50 - columns that we want for this grid
02:52 - we could say the first number is the
02:53 - amount of rows and the second number is
02:55 - the amount of columns
02:57 - so here we have nine rows and one column
03:00 - so they will all be stacked vertically
03:03 - like
03:04 - this and then they will expand to fit
03:06 - the size of the frame
03:08 - but all of the components will also stay
03:10 - the same size as each other
03:12 - let's say we want three rows and three
03:14 - columns
03:15 - this is what this might look like so we
03:17 - have three rows and
03:19 - three columns and later on in the series
03:21 - we do create a calculator program as
03:24 - well as a game of tic-tac-toe so a grid
03:26 - layout works perfect for those programs
03:29 - now when we create our instance of a
03:31 - graded layout
03:32 - we can also add some arguments for the
03:35 - horizontal margins
03:36 - and vertical margins between these
03:38 - components
03:40 - so let's add two more arguments and
03:42 - we'll just set them to zero for now
03:43 - so this third position is the horizontal
03:47 - spacing between components and the
03:49 - fourth one is the vertical spacing
03:51 - so if i were to set this third argument
03:54 - to 10
03:55 - we're going to have 10 pixels worth of
03:57 - margin between
03:58 - these components between each column and
04:01 - this fourth argument is
04:02 - the vertical margin so if you combine
04:05 - these both together you have
04:07 - 10 pixels worth of margin around all of
04:09 - the components
04:11 - now what happens if you have an uneven
04:13 - amount
04:14 - of components that you add to a grid
04:16 - layout so we have three by
04:18 - three so that works perfect for nine
04:20 - components let's say that we add one
04:22 - more
04:22 - we're going to add a tenth button
04:26 - like that so what happens now
04:30 - is that this will actually create a new
04:32 - column for us
04:33 - so we have three rows and four columns
04:37 - and it tries to make this as evenly
04:39 - balanced as possible
04:41 - so that's the basics of grade layout
04:43 - managers if you want to copy of all this
04:45 - code i'll post all of this in the
04:46 - comments down below
04:47 - but yeah that's the basics of grid
04:49 - layouts in java
04:52 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
04:54 - learn something new
04:55 - then you can help me help you in three
04:58 - easy steps
04:59 - by smashing that like button drop a
