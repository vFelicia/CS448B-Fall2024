00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
00:02 - here hope you're doing well and
00:03 - in this video i'm going to teach you
00:05 - guys all about pseudo classes
00:07 - in css so let's get started
00:09 - [Music]
00:12 - before you reach the end of this video
00:14 - make sure to like
00:15 - comment and subscribe so that we
00:17 - together can challenge and defeat the
00:19 - mighty youtube algorithm
00:22 - think of a pseudo class as a special
00:25 - keyword that is used to define
00:27 - a special state of an element and for
00:29 - example
00:30 - i have the hover pseudo class right here
00:33 - we can do things like change the
00:34 - appearance of a button when we hover
00:36 - over it
00:36 - we can create drop down menus to appear
00:39 - i'll probably make a separate video on
00:40 - drop down menus
00:41 - we can even style certain items in a
00:43 - list or grouping based on certain
00:45 - criteria using a pseudo class
00:48 - so this video is meant to introduce how
00:50 - to use pseudo classes
00:51 - we won't cover all the pseudo classes
00:53 - that are out there but at least a few of
00:55 - the more useful ones
00:56 - and if you ever encounter a pseudo class
00:58 - that you might find useful for your own
01:00 - projects
01:01 - well at least you know how to use them
01:02 - so let's begin by creating some sample
01:04 - text on our html document
01:06 - we're going to create three things a
01:08 - link a button and a list
01:10 - let's get started let's first create a
01:13 - link so i'm just going to use an
01:14 - a tag and we're going to use the href
01:18 - attribute and let's set this equal to
01:21 - maybe google
01:23 - https colon two forward slashes
01:29 - www.google.com
01:31 - all right then let's add the text for
01:33 - the link
01:36 - www.google.com
01:37 - and then let's close this a tag let's
01:39 - save reload the page
01:41 - okay that works for our link here
01:45 - now let's create maybe two line breaks
01:48 - just to give us some space
01:50 - then let's create a button so
01:53 - button type equals
01:57 - button and then let's add some text to
02:00 - this button
02:02 - click me
02:06 - and then close the button let's save
02:10 - reload the page there's our button now
02:12 - let's create a list
02:14 - but i'm just going to separate a few of
02:16 - these things
02:18 - let's make an unordered list so use the
02:21 - ul
02:21 - tag then let's add maybe 10 list items
02:25 - so this is item number one
02:29 - and let's close this and then i'm just
02:32 - going to copy and paste this a bunch of
02:33 - times
02:34 - so two three four five
02:38 - six seven eight nine
02:41 - ten that should be fine and let's close
02:44 - this ul tag and i'm just going to change
02:46 - some of the numbers
02:47 - so two three four five
02:51 - six seven eight nine
02:54 - and ten let's save reload okay
02:57 - this is fine let's go to our style sheet
03:00 - and let's get rid of that now by default
03:03 - with links
03:04 - the color the text color is blue for a
03:06 - hyperlink but if you've already visited
03:08 - that page
03:09 - it's going to be purple and you can see
03:11 - right now that it's purple
03:12 - so you can actually delete your browser
03:15 - history to get rid of that and it will
03:17 - go back to being that blue color for the
03:19 - hyperlink
03:19 - since i already clicked on this it's
03:21 - already purple so i'm just going to
03:23 - delete my history real quick
03:26 - well welcome back now with this link it
03:28 - is now blue that is the
03:30 - default for hyperlinks but it might be
03:33 - something different if you're using a
03:34 - different web browser
03:35 - idk though so we can actually use a
03:38 - pseudo class to change the appearance
03:40 - of this hyperlink so what we want to do
03:43 - is
03:44 - target all a elements then colon and
03:46 - then we can pick a pseudo class
03:48 - so we can use the link pseudo class to
03:51 - change the appearance of a hyperlink
03:53 - so let's change the color and i have
03:57 - a hexadecimal color picker here and we
03:59 - can just pick a different color
04:01 - so maybe i'll pick like a seafoam green
04:04 - of some sort
04:05 - that works for me so i'm just going to
04:07 - copy this hex value
04:09 - and place it right here let's save this
04:11 - then reload the page
04:13 - and now what you see here is that all
04:15 - hyperlinks are now
04:16 - this sea foam green color which is
04:18 - pretty sweet that is the
04:20 - link pseudo class let's discuss the
04:22 - visited pseudo class
04:25 - these css properties that are listed
04:27 - will apply to
04:28 - any link that's already visited
04:31 - alright so let's actually click on this
04:34 - link then head back
04:35 - it's back to that basic purple right so
04:37 - now we can actually add some css
04:39 - properties for any link that is already
04:42 - visited
04:42 - so let's maybe change the color and i
04:46 - will pick
04:47 - like a purplish color and i'll take this
04:50 - value
04:51 - and then just paste it let's save reload
04:53 - the page
04:54 - now it's like a pinkish purple color
04:57 - which is a little more artistic i would
04:59 - say
05:00 - okay let's style this button so we're
05:03 - going to target our button
05:05 - then we'll use the hover pseudo class we
05:08 - can change the appearance of this button
05:10 - whenever we move
05:11 - our cursor over it so let's change the
05:15 - color as well
05:16 - so we're going to change the background
05:18 - dash color
05:20 - and i think i will pick a reddish color
05:25 - that should be fine so i'm going to copy
05:27 - this paste it
05:29 - and i believe i will change the text
05:32 - color as well
05:33 - and i will just pick white okay so let's
05:35 - save it
05:36 - reload the page so there doesn't appear
05:38 - to be any changes to our button right
05:40 - but if we take our cursor and hover over
05:42 - this button
05:43 - that's when these css properties will
05:45 - kick in whenever we hover
05:47 - over an html element that is listed so
05:50 - this doesn't really appear to do
05:51 - anything when you click on it
05:52 - it does become focusable where there's
05:54 - this blue border around this
05:56 - but we can actually change the
05:57 - appearance of this button when we click
05:59 - on it
06:00 - so we're going to use the active pseudo
06:02 - class so let's target
06:04 - our button element and we're going to
06:06 - use the active
06:07 - pseudo class and i guess i'll just
06:09 - change the background color again
06:12 - and i will pick a slightly darker shade
06:15 - of red
06:16 - that should be fine and let's paste that
06:20 - save let's reload and now when we click
06:23 - on this button you can see that it just
06:24 - flashed really dark right
06:26 - so the active pseudo class is applied
06:29 - whenever you click on something
06:31 - or you hold something down so you can
06:33 - see that it's that darker shade of red
06:35 - now it's kind of like it's a 3d effect
06:37 - where we're pushing in the button and
06:38 - it's not getting as much sunlight
06:40 - where it's kind of like in the shade
06:42 - then you know what i mean so
06:44 - the active pseudo class applies to any
06:46 - html element
06:48 - that is clicked or is held down all
06:50 - right moving on i have a few pseudo
06:52 - classes that are useful for
06:54 - different list items or groupings of
06:56 - items and the first one that we're going
06:58 - to discuss
06:58 - is the first child pseudo class so we
07:01 - have a
07:02 - unordered list here and we have 10 list
07:04 - items
07:05 - we can actually target specific list
07:07 - items and then give them some css
07:09 - properties so i'm just going to type in
07:11 - li
07:12 - and then we're going to use the first
07:15 - dash
07:16 - child pseudo class and this is going to
07:18 - apply to the
07:19 - first list item in some sort of list or
07:22 - grouping
07:23 - so maybe i'll change the background
07:25 - color
07:27 - i should really discuss more css
07:28 - properties too but
07:30 - colors are kind of fun to work with and
07:32 - maybe let's pick like a
07:35 - maybe a greenish color um i already
07:37 - picked one out already so i'm just going
07:39 - to use this one
07:40 - because it was a pretty sweet color so a
07:42 - 93 ff7d
07:45 - all right so this first child pseudo
07:48 - class
07:48 - will apply to the first item in some
07:51 - sort of lister grouping
07:52 - so let's reload the page now this list
07:56 - item
07:56 - is now highlighted now there's another
07:58 - pseudo class
07:59 - that is the last dash
08:02 - child and this will apply to the last
08:05 - element
08:05 - in some sort of list so i'm just going
08:08 - to copy this background color
08:09 - and paste it and this color will now be
08:13 - applied to
08:14 - the last item in your list and actually
08:16 - if we were to add
08:18 - one more item to this list this would
08:20 - actually change
08:21 - so currently list item number 10 is
08:23 - highlighted right
08:24 - so let's save this reload now we have a
08:28 - new item within our list
08:30 - and the last child pseudo class now
08:33 - applies to
08:34 - well the last item now which is now item
08:36 - number 11.
08:38 - i do have a few other pseudo classes
08:40 - related to lists i'd like to show you
08:41 - guys
08:42 - so i'm just going to comment this out
08:44 - for now the first child
08:46 - as well as the last child pseudo class
08:49 - all right
08:49 - this next one is called the nth
08:53 - child pseudo class but we're going to
08:55 - add a set of parentheses right after
08:58 - and then a set of curly braces like we
09:00 - normally do
09:01 - now we can target a specific item within
09:04 - some sort of grouping by putting the
09:06 - item number within the parentheses
09:08 - let's say that we want to target maybe
09:10 - this fifth item right here
09:12 - we're going to put the number five all
09:14 - right and then
09:15 - i'll just copy what we had here before
09:17 - with the background color
09:19 - so let's save reload now the fifth item
09:22 - in this list or grouping
09:23 - is now highlighted or it has this css
09:26 - property applied to it
09:28 - now if we were to change this number to
09:30 - maybe three save and reload
09:32 - this now applies to the third item in
09:34 - our list are grouping
09:36 - and before we finish this video i'm
09:37 - going to show you guys a few different
09:39 - tricks related to the nth child pseudo
09:41 - class
09:42 - so for now i'm just going to move this
09:43 - comment a little bit down further
09:46 - and then save reload we're going to copy
09:48 - this
09:49 - and then just make one change so we
09:51 - don't necessarily need to place a number
09:53 - here between the parentheses of the nth
09:55 - child pseudo class
09:56 - we can also type in a word such as odd
09:59 - to target
10:00 - all odd numbered items within this list
10:02 - or grouping
10:03 - so let's see what happens now when we
10:05 - put the word odd here
10:06 - so all odd numbered items now have this
10:09 - css property applied to them and we can
10:12 - do the same thing
10:13 - with even numbered items so i'm going to
10:15 - paste this
10:16 - change odd to even but i'm going to
10:19 - change the background color so it stands
10:21 - out
10:22 - so i'm just going to pick a slightly
10:24 - lighter shade of the same color
10:26 - let's copy this hex value and then place
10:30 - it here
10:31 - so this color will be applied to all
10:33 - even numbered items in this list
10:35 - so let's save reload and what ends up
10:38 - happening
10:38 - is that we get this nice looking table
10:41 - it's something you might see in like a
10:42 - textbook
10:43 - for school or something so all odd
10:46 - numbered items are this color all even
10:49 - numbered items
10:50 - are this other color that's lighter and
10:52 - i have
10:53 - one last trick for this video to show
10:55 - you guys we can create
10:56 - a custom formula within the nth child to
10:59 - target very specific items
11:01 - within a grouping of some sort so for
11:04 - now i'm just going to
11:05 - turn the rest of this into a comment and
11:08 - this will be the last one i'll show you
11:09 - guys
11:10 - so we're going to type in li colon and
11:12 - child
11:13 - and then set a parenthesis set of curly
11:16 - braces
11:17 - now within the parentheses there's a
11:19 - formula we can put in here
11:21 - it is a n plus b
11:24 - all right so we're actually going to be
11:26 - replacing each of these letters
11:28 - with some sort of value and here is a
11:31 - definition of each of these values
11:33 - so i'm just going to write a comment
11:35 - right here so
11:37 - a equals the cycle
11:40 - size how many times do we want this to
11:43 - repeat
11:44 - n is our counter and it starts
11:48 - at zero and then lastly
11:52 - b is equal to our offset
11:56 - value then i should probably write this
11:58 - one more time right here
12:01 - so that was a n plus b
12:04 - okay i'm just going to save and reload
12:07 - so this is all cleared then
12:09 - now let's say that we want to target
12:12 - every
12:12 - third item within our list here so
12:16 - for our cycle size we're just going to
12:18 - put uh 3 here instead of a
12:20 - we can keep n here we can keep that at 0
12:23 - plus the offset
12:24 - and if we don't want an offset we'll
12:26 - just place zero here
12:27 - now we can add some css properties uh i
12:30 - think i'll change
12:32 - the background to like maybe like a
12:33 - highlighter yellow
12:35 - color so maybe i'll use background image
12:38 - and a linear gradient so
12:40 - linear dash gradient and then
12:44 - two right and i have two colors picked
12:48 - out already so that was
12:50 - fff421 this is yellow
12:53 - and six f's which is just all white then
12:57 - so this is like a highlighter effect of
12:59 - some sort
13:00 - but make sure you spell background right
13:02 - because i didn't okay so
13:04 - this css property is going to apply to
13:07 - every third item in our group so let's
13:10 - test it out then just to prove i'm not a
13:12 - liar so let's save
13:13 - reload now each third item
13:16 - in this group has this css property
13:19 - applied to it
13:20 - now we can actually add an offset to
13:22 - this so
13:23 - for example if i were to add one here
13:27 - the offset would be one then if i change
13:30 - this to two
13:32 - you can see that everything shifted down
13:34 - by one then
13:36 - and if the offset was three it shifts
13:38 - down further
13:39 - um so if you want to add an offset you
13:41 - could just change that here
13:43 - um so now if you want like every fourth
13:45 - item you would just place
13:47 - four here instead of three so now every
13:50 - fourth item
13:51 - has that css property applied oh and one
13:54 - last thing before you go with these
13:55 - pseudo classes you're not limited to
13:57 - only changing the colors i was only
13:59 - using colors just because i think
14:01 - they're
14:02 - fairly simple to use you can add other
14:04 - css properties as well for example i
14:06 - could also change the opacity
14:08 - and maybe i'll set this to 0.5 for 50
14:11 - percent
14:12 - maybe i'll add a border around each of
14:14 - these so border
14:16 - one pixel solid so
14:20 - now we have a border around these
14:22 - selected items
14:23 - so you can pretty much add any css
14:26 - property that you want to these pseudo
14:27 - classes
14:28 - i was only using colors because they're
14:30 - pretty simple to use and
14:31 - well they're kind of pretty so that's
14:33 - the basics of pseudo classes if you
14:35 - would like a copy of this markup i'll
14:37 - post this in the comments down below
14:40 - there's still more pseudo classes out
14:41 - there these are a few of the more basic
14:43 - ones that you might encounter
14:44 - they're fairly useful if there's any new
14:47 - pseudo class that you encounter
14:48 - you at least know how to add it and use
14:51 - it then but yeah those are the basics of
14:54 - pseudo classes in css hey you
14:57 - yeah i'm talking to you if you learn
14:59 - something new then you can help me
15:02 - help you in three easy steps by smashing
