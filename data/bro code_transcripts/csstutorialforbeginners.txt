00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:02 - bro hope you're doing well and in this
00:04 - video i'm going to teach you guys
00:05 - everything you need to know to get
00:06 - started using css so sit back relax and
00:10 - enjoy the show
00:13 - if you wouldn't mind please like comment
00:15 - and subscribe one like equals one prayer
00:18 - for the youtube algorithm
00:20 - okay let's do this css css is an acronym
00:24 - for cascading style sheets it's defined
00:27 - as a stylesheet language used for
00:29 - describing the presentation of a
00:31 - document written in a markup language
00:34 - such as html i stole that definition
00:36 - from wikipedia i like to think of
00:38 - building a website very similar to
00:40 - building a house we need three things
00:42 - structure style and functionality we can
00:45 - use html for structure this would be
00:47 - like the skeleton the frame of our house
00:51 - with css we can add styles such as
00:54 - colors decorations lighting and with
00:56 - javascript we can add functionality in
00:58 - our house analogy this would be similar
01:00 - to plumbing heating electricity but in
01:04 - this video we're going to focus on style
01:07 - now to work with css you'll need a text
01:09 - editor i just so happen to be using vs
01:12 - code so let's jump over to that here we
01:15 - are within vs code or some other text
01:17 - editor that you prefer so you'll need an
01:20 - html document to work with if you don't
01:22 - have one just go to new file and then
01:24 - you can create one just make sure the
01:25 - extension ends with html there are three
01:28 - ways in which we can apply css
01:30 - properties to html elements inline
01:33 - internal or external external works the
01:37 - best especially if you have a large
01:38 - website we'll need some sample text to
01:41 - work with so let's create a title for
01:43 - this webpage using a pair of h1 header
01:46 - tags
01:48 - this is my website
01:51 - and let's create maybe four paragraphs
01:53 - as well
01:54 - so these are in pairs of p tags and
01:58 - we'll need some sample text if you need
01:59 - some sample text type lorem and then tab
02:02 - to generate some sample text so let's
02:04 - copy that line and paste it three
02:06 - additional times
02:08 - okay there we go so we can apply css
02:11 - inline so whatever element you would
02:14 - like to apply css properties to within
02:17 - the opening tag you would set the style
02:20 - attribute equal to some css properties
02:23 - within quotes let's say that i would
02:25 - like to change the background color of
02:27 - my webpage so within the opening body
02:30 - element i will set the style attribute
02:33 - equal to one or many css properties
02:37 - let's change the background color so
02:39 - type background color colon and then end
02:42 - it with a semicolon and then we will
02:44 - list either a color name like black
02:48 - you can use rgb values and these come in
02:50 - groups of three so black would be three
02:53 - zeros
02:54 - so depending on what values you have
02:56 - here this will change the color or
02:58 - there's hexadecimal values hexadecimal
03:01 - values are preceded with a hashtag and
03:04 - there are six digits that follow so
03:07 - black is 60 rows
03:10 - where white is six fs
03:13 - but you can always look up a color
03:15 - picker and then just copy the values
03:17 - after you find a color that you like
03:19 - it's a lot easier perhaps we would like
03:21 - a black background so i'll just keep the
03:23 - simple and use color names instead but
03:25 - you can use rgb values and hexadecimal
03:28 - values okay now i would like to make my
03:31 - h1 header tag white so i will set the
03:34 - style attribute equal to the color
03:37 - property this time color is for the font
03:39 - color background color is for well the
03:41 - background color
03:43 - so color white now with our paragraph
03:46 - tags let's apply more than one css
03:48 - property
03:49 - so let's set the style equal to and list
03:53 - whatever properties you would like to
03:54 - apply within double quotes and then
03:57 - separate each with a semicolon uh let's
03:59 - begin with the background
04:01 - color
04:02 - let's make this maybe gray
04:05 - and let's change the color to
04:08 - what about white
04:11 - then i'm just going to copy the style
04:13 - attribute and paste it for each of these
04:15 - paragraphs
04:17 - this is somewhat redundant but there's
04:18 - an easier way of doing this with
04:20 - internal style sheets
04:22 - to apply an internal style sheet within
04:25 - the head of your html document you'll
04:28 - need a pair of style tags
04:32 - whatever element you would like to apply
04:34 - css properties to you will list that
04:37 - element for example the body
04:39 - then follow that with a pair of curly
04:42 - braces
04:43 - then you will type the name of a css
04:45 - property like background color and set
04:47 - it to some value like black
04:50 - and then we no longer need this style
04:52 - attribute there we go you may need to
04:55 - save and refresh this time let's apply
04:57 - css to the h1 header tag via an internal
05:01 - style sheet uh so let's copy this value
05:04 - and get rid of it
05:06 - okay this time we would like to change
05:08 - our h1 header tags so list that here
05:11 - within our style element h1 curly braces
05:15 - list any css properties within the curly
05:17 - braces color white and we'll do the same
05:20 - thing with our paragraph tags
05:23 - so let's get rid of these
05:29 - so type p
05:30 - curly braces
05:32 - and then we will paste the css
05:34 - properties
05:36 - so you can apply more than one css
05:37 - property just place them within the
05:40 - curly braces so there we go and you can
05:42 - see that this is a lot less redundant
05:45 - instead of making all of the changes in
05:46 - line you can place them within an
05:48 - internal style sheet now the last method
05:51 - which i think is the best method is an
05:53 - external style sheet so we will create a
05:56 - new css file so i'm going to right click
05:59 - go to new file let's name this style.css
06:05 - i'm going to copy everything within my
06:07 - style element and then get rid of our
06:10 - style element tags
06:12 - and within the style sheet we will paste
06:15 - everything that we just copied now we
06:17 - just need to link our html file with our
06:20 - css file and to do that within the head
06:23 - tag
06:24 - we will type
06:26 - link
06:27 - rel equals rel is an attribute that
06:31 - names a relationship of the linked
06:33 - document to the current document so rel
06:37 - will be
06:38 - stylesheet
06:40 - then set the href attribute equal to the
06:43 - relative file path of your css file
06:46 - they're right next to each other i only
06:47 - need to list the file name there we go
06:50 - we have applied css properties via an
06:53 - external style sheet and this is the
06:55 - preferred way of doing things so you can
06:57 - reuse this one style sheet for many
06:59 - different html pages so let's say that
07:02 - we create a new html document like
07:04 - page2.html
07:08 - by the way if you need to generate the
07:10 - body of your html document if you're
07:12 - using vs code you can type exclamation
07:14 - point and then tab let's create a really
07:17 - quick html document for page two
07:20 - this is page
07:22 - two
07:24 - and then i'll create two paragraphs
07:26 - let's say
07:32 - okay i'm going to open page 2 with live
07:35 - server and take a look page 2 does not
07:37 - have any css filing but we can reuse the
07:41 - same css file all we have to do is link
07:44 - our html file with our css file within
07:48 - the head element i am just going to make
07:50 - that link so this is really convenient
07:52 - if you have to make any changes to your
07:54 - website let's say that you need to make
07:56 - all of the pages on your website instead
07:58 - of the background color black let's say
08:00 - maybe gray well you can just make that
08:02 - change here and that one change will
08:04 - apply to all of your html documents so
08:07 - you only need to make that change in one
08:09 - place that's why external style sheets
08:12 - are really useful one unique feature of
08:14 - css is that we can target any specific
08:17 - element by id or a class that they may
08:20 - be in any element that has these names
08:23 - will have these styles but what if i
08:26 - would like maybe one of these paragraphs
08:28 - to have a different font color i can
08:30 - give one of these paragraphs a unique id
08:33 - so within the opening tag i will set the
08:36 - id attribute equal to a unique
08:38 - identifier let's say p1 because it's
08:41 - well the first paragraph so then to
08:43 - target that specific id i will type
08:48 - that id
08:49 - and let's set the color equal to
08:52 - what about tomato
08:55 - now for practice let's give each of
08:56 - these a unique id
08:59 - let's say p1 p2
09:01 - p3
09:02 - and p4
09:04 - if we need to change p2's color to
09:07 - tomato well then we target
09:10 - p2
09:12 - what about p3 just change the id to p3
09:16 - and then p4
09:18 - so you can target a specific element by
09:21 - id you just have to be sure to fill out
09:23 - that id attribute
09:25 - or you can target anything within the
09:27 - same class a class is like a group in
09:30 - this example let's say that all odd
09:33 - numbered paragraphs should be read all
09:35 - even-numbered paragraphs should be blue
09:38 - so i'm going to instead give these each
09:40 - a class you can keep the ids if you want
09:43 - to
09:44 - so type class equals the first paragraph
09:47 - will be
09:48 - odd class odd the second paragraph will
09:52 - be class even
09:55 - then odd
09:56 - then even
09:58 - so to target elements by a class you
10:01 - type dot the name of the class
10:03 - so anything within the odd class
10:06 - let's say we'll have a color
10:08 - of red
10:11 - and i'm going to get rid of this tomato
10:13 - color
10:14 - our first paragraph is within the odd
10:16 - class the same applies with our third
10:18 - paragraph and then i would like to make
10:21 - any elements within the even class blue
10:24 - color
10:25 - blue
10:27 - so our second paragraph is blue and our
10:30 - fourth paragraph is blue so yeah
10:32 - everybody that is a quick introduction
10:34 - to css it means cascading stylesheets we
10:38 - can apply css properties in one of three
10:40 - ways
10:41 - inline internal or external in this
10:44 - series we will be using external style
10:47 - sheets so yeah that's a quick
10:49 - introduction to css if you found this
