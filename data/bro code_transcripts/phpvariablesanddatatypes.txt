00:00 - well hello everybody Welcome to lesson
00:02 - two today I'm going to discuss variables
00:04 - in PHP a variable think of it as a
00:08 - reusable container that holds data we
00:11 - give that container a name that is the
00:13 - variable name there's different data
00:16 - types we'll discuss they include but are
00:18 - not limited to Strings integers floats
00:22 - and booleans there are still more than
00:24 - this but these are a few of the basics
00:26 - for beginners let's get started
00:29 - to declare a variable you type a dollar
00:32 - sign then a unique variable name
00:35 - I'm going to store a user's name a
00:38 - unique identifier could be just name
00:41 - I will set this variable name equal to
00:45 - a string of text so place your string of
00:48 - text within a set of double quotes
00:51 - add a semicolon to the end because we
00:53 - always do that why don't you enter in
00:55 - your first name
00:57 - then to display this variable as output
01:00 - we can type our Echo statement then add
01:03 - the variable name so type dollar sign
01:06 - name semicolon
01:08 - let's save
01:11 - and there is our name rendered as HTML
01:14 - the data type of this variable is a
01:17 - string it's a string of text and it can
01:20 - include spaces
01:21 - add a space followed by your last name
01:26 - as output we're displaying my first name
01:28 - and my last name all as one long string
01:32 - of text
01:33 - if you Echo a message directly that is
01:36 - known as a string literal
01:38 - I will display a message such as
01:41 - hello
01:43 - then I want to add this variable name
01:46 - the easiest way to do that is to add a
01:49 - set of curly braces as a placeholder and
01:51 - within the curly braces add your
01:53 - variable name so dollar sign name
01:58 - hello whatever your name is
02:01 - let's add a few more variables how about
02:04 - a food variable
02:06 - what's the food you like
02:09 - I like pizza of course which we learned
02:11 - from the last video
02:14 - hello
02:15 - name
02:17 - I'll display another message
02:20 - Echo
02:23 - you like at our placeholder
02:27 - our variable name
02:29 - food
02:31 - let's save
02:35 - I'm going to disable this
02:37 - page is not in Dutch for some reason
02:42 - our output is all on one line I'm just
02:45 - going to add a line break
02:49 - a low bro code you like pizza
02:53 - what's another example of a string maybe
02:55 - an email
02:58 - let's declare our variable which we will
03:00 - name email
03:02 - add a set of quotes semicolon to the end
03:06 - uh fake at gmail.com
03:13 - so let's add another line break
03:19 - let's Echo
03:22 - your email is at our placeholder for a
03:26 - variable
03:28 - then our variable name
03:30 - email
03:33 - your email is fake gmail.com
03:37 - that's the string data type it's just a
03:40 - series of text
03:41 - your text can contain numbers
03:44 - such as fake123 gmail.com
03:49 - so even though these are numbers we
03:51 - treat them more as characters we can't
03:53 - use these for any sort of math
03:55 - that's where our next data type comes in
03:58 - integers whole integers
04:00 - an example of a whole integer would be
04:03 - somebody's age let's say that I'm 21 age
04:06 - equals 21. I'm not 21 anymore but I like
04:10 - to think that I still am
04:11 - the data contained within this variable
04:13 - age is an integer we don't have any
04:16 - quotes around this number
04:19 - I will Echo my age variable
04:23 - Echo
04:25 - you are are variable age
04:29 - years old
04:33 - let me add a blind break here
04:38 - there you are 21 years old
04:41 - and int is simply a whole integer
04:45 - you know somebody wouldn't be like half
04:47 - a year old like 21.5
04:50 - and age would be a whole number
04:53 - another example of a whole integer
04:55 - variable could be users
04:59 - let's create a variable named users and
05:02 - there are maybe two users online
05:05 - you wouldn't have half a user users
05:08 - would be a whole number
05:10 - let's Echo the amount of users
05:15 - there are at a placeholder
05:18 - are variable users
05:21 - online
05:26 - there are two online
05:28 - after the variable users let's add the
05:32 - word users
05:33 - there are two users online
05:37 - one more example of a whole integer
05:39 - could be a quantity
05:43 - you wouldn't have half a product you
05:45 - would have a whole product
05:47 - let's create a variable named quantity
05:50 - I'll just set it to three
05:53 - let's Echo
05:55 - you would like to buy
05:58 - are variable
06:00 - quantity
06:04 - items
06:06 - then a line break
06:09 - you would like to buy three items
06:12 - okay those are whole integers
06:15 - let's discuss floats next a float is a
06:18 - floating Point number it's a number that
06:20 - contains a decimal portion
06:23 - these variables are ins integers they're
06:25 - whole numbers
06:27 - an example of a float could be
06:30 - a grade point average
06:32 - maybe my grade point average is 2.5
06:37 - so let's Echo
06:43 - your GPA is
06:47 - then our GPA variable
06:50 - then line break
06:55 - your GPA is 2.5
06:58 - I think we're getting the hang of this
06:59 - I'm going to speed things up another
07:02 - float could be a price
07:06 - with the merry concurrency a price
07:08 - contains dollars and cents with the
07:11 - cents being a decimal portion
07:13 - suppose a pizza is 4.99
07:19 - let's Echo
07:23 - your Pizza is
07:27 - I'll add my price variable
07:29 - your pizza is
07:31 - price
07:33 - line break
07:37 - your pizza is 4.99 I'm going to add the
07:41 - dollar sign before 4.99
07:45 - but we have a problem
07:47 - PHP is getting confused because we
07:49 - precede our variable names with the
07:51 - dollar sign
07:53 - undefined variable 4.99
07:57 - if you would like to display a dollar
07:59 - sign as output you need an escape
08:01 - sequence I will precede my dollar sign
08:04 - with a backslash then it works just fine
08:08 - let me add your
08:10 - your pizza is 4.99
08:14 - so that's another example of a floating
08:16 - Point number a float another could be
08:19 - a tax rate
08:21 - tax
08:23 - rate
08:25 - I'll make up a tax rate like a sales tax
08:27 - rate 5.1 sounds good
08:31 - let's Echo
08:34 - the sales tax rate is
08:43 - tax rate
08:46 - oop I'm forgetting a dollar sign
08:49 - tax rate percent
08:52 - then a line break
08:55 - the sales tax rate is 5.1 percent
08:59 - those are floats floating Point numbers
09:02 - they're numbers that contain a decimal
09:04 - portion integers are whole numbers
09:07 - the last data type we'll cover are
09:10 - booleans booleans are either true or
09:13 - they're false
09:15 - it's like a light switch it can only be
09:17 - on or off
09:19 - so what are some variables that could be
09:21 - considered booleans
09:24 - what if somebody is employed they either
09:27 - are employed or they're not employed
09:30 - equals true
09:34 - another could be online
09:36 - is somebody online or offline
09:39 - maybe a user's offline I will set that
09:42 - to be false
09:44 - what about for sale
09:47 - something is for sale or it's not for
09:50 - sale
09:50 - I'll set that to be true
09:54 - now with booleans when you display them
09:55 - as output
09:57 - you don't see true or false rather this
10:00 - is what you see
10:02 - let's Echo
10:05 - online
10:07 - status
10:08 - colon then I'll add my Boolean variable
10:13 - online
10:16 - so online is false
10:19 - online status and then nothing appears
10:21 - the Boolean values when you output them
10:24 - if it's false it doesn't display
10:26 - anything however if online was true that
10:30 - will output a one one means true zero
10:34 - means false however we won't display
10:36 - zero nothing is displayed for false
10:39 - usually with Boolean variables we don't
10:42 - normally display them as output we use
10:45 - them internally within a program we
10:47 - might use these within an if statement
10:49 - or a loop which we'll discuss in the
10:51 - future but at this point you should be
10:53 - aware of the existence of Boolean
10:55 - variables in summary a Boolean variable
10:58 - is either true or false
11:01 - I'm going to get rid of these Echo
11:03 - statements you can mix and match
11:05 - variables when you display output with
11:07 - Echo I will add two variables this time
11:10 - here's a hypothetical situation you own
11:13 - a pizza restaurant and somebody places
11:16 - an online order for a given amount of
11:19 - pizzas
11:20 - you have
11:22 - ordered let's add our variable
11:26 - quantity
11:29 - X then our variable
11:32 - food
11:35 - you have ordered three x Pizza let's add
11:38 - an S to the end to make it plural
11:41 - you have ordered three x pizzas
11:44 - then let's calculate a total what I'm
11:46 - going to do now is declare a variable
11:49 - but I'm not going to assign it a value
11:51 - quite yet we will calculate a total
11:54 - total equals null null means no value
11:58 - We'll add a value later
12:01 - after displaying our message you have
12:04 - ordered quantity X food
12:06 - let's reassign our total variable
12:10 - equal to
12:12 - are quantity
12:15 - times
12:16 - to use multiplication you use an
12:18 - asterisk
12:20 - our variable price
12:24 - so now our total should contain a number
12:28 - let's output it
12:30 - Echo
12:32 - your total is
12:37 - let's add our variable
12:40 - total
12:41 - and see what we have
12:43 - ooh I need a line break I'm forgetting
12:45 - about that
12:49 - you have ordered three x pizzas your
12:52 - total is 14.97 So I need to add a dollar
12:56 - sign or you can pick some other unit of
12:58 - currency however PHP is currently
13:00 - confused because we're preceding our
13:02 - placeholder with a dollar sign
13:04 - so I need to use an escape sequence
13:08 - your total is 14.97
13:13 - now in my program if I were to change
13:15 - the quantity
13:17 - well this total is going to be updated
13:19 - four pizzas is 19.96
13:24 - if I were to change the price that would
13:26 - also be reflected
13:27 - now the total is 23.96
13:31 - all right everybody so those are
13:33 - variables they are just a named
13:35 - container for storing reusable data
13:38 - there are a few different data types
13:40 - strings which are a series of text
13:44 - ins which are whole integers
13:47 - floats which are floating Point numbers
13:50 - and booleans which are either true or
13:53 - false in the next topic we'll have more
13:55 - practice with arithmetic and PHP and
13:58 - well those are variables in PHP
