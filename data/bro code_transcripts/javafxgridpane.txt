00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:02 - bro hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to explain
00:04 - the grid pain container in javafx
00:07 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - okay we're talking about the grid paint
00:14 - today grid panes are found underneath
00:16 - the containers drop down menu
00:18 - it's a flexible grid of rows and columns
00:21 - to arrange
00:22 - different nodes so we have two columns
00:25 - and three rows to begin with
00:27 - if you were to right click on grid pane
00:28 - then go to grid pane we can add rows and
00:30 - columns
00:31 - let's say that i would like to create a
00:33 - game of tic-tac-toe and i need
00:34 - three rows and three columns so i will
00:36 - add a column
00:38 - i now have three rows and three columns
00:40 - so we can drag and drop nodes into each
00:42 - individual region
00:44 - so let's say we have a button now the
00:46 - defaults for adding nodes
00:48 - is that these nodes will stick to the
00:50 - middle
00:51 - left but we can change that by going to
00:53 - the alignment and each alignment when
00:55 - you click on one of these nodes
00:57 - so we can change this to top center
01:00 - bottom left center
01:03 - right wherever you need or you can
01:05 - expand these but they will not expand
01:07 - to take up more room than the grid that
01:09 - they're in their individual cell
01:11 - now by heading to the grid pane
01:13 - constraints region of your layout drop
01:16 - down menu you can change the index of a
01:18 - node
01:18 - after you click on it currently my
01:20 - button is at
01:22 - row 0 column 0 but you can change that
01:24 - let's say
01:25 - row one column zero row two column zero
01:28 - row two column one row two column two
01:31 - so that would work or you can drag and
01:33 - drop it to a different cell within your
01:35 - grid
01:36 - another important note is that if you
01:38 - adjust the dimensions of your grid
01:40 - pane each cell of your grid pane will
01:42 - adjust as well
01:43 - i will click on my grid pane head to
01:45 - layout and change the dimensions
01:47 - if i need this grid to be an even square
01:49 - let's change the width
01:50 - to 500 and the height to 500 as well
01:54 - so each cell within my grid pane is an
01:56 - even square
01:57 - and within the properties drop down menu
02:00 - you can display grid lines between
02:02 - each of these cells by clicking this
02:04 - check box grid
02:05 - lines visible and if we preview this we
02:08 - have our button
02:09 - and then grid lines between each of
02:11 - these cells too
02:12 - so let's copy and paste our node and
02:15 - drag and drop it to
02:16 - each individual cell within our grid
02:20 - pane
02:23 - i think i'm going to get rid of these
02:24 - grid lines between each of these cells
02:26 - let's preview and i have a grid of nine
02:29 - cells each contains a button
02:31 - so this could work as some sort of
02:33 - framework for tic-tac-toe or maybe even
02:35 - a calculator but you'd probably need to
02:37 - add more buttons
02:38 - you can also add a horizontal gap
02:40 - between each of these columns
02:42 - and a vertical gap between each row
02:44 - click on your grid pane then head to
02:46 - layout and we will change the h gap
02:50 - so if you type in a number you will add
02:52 - that amount of pixels as space between
02:54 - each column with an h gap and then v gap
02:58 - will add a vertical gap between each of
03:00 - these rows
03:01 - and it looks a little something like
03:03 - this all right everybody so
03:05 - that is a grid pane it's a flexible grid
03:08 - of rows and columns in which we can lay
03:10 - out nodes
