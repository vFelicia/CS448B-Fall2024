00:01 - hey what's going on everybody so in this
00:04 - video i'm going to show you some useful
00:06 - math functions in c now if we include
00:09 - this math header file this contains a
00:11 - lot of the useful functions i'm about to
00:13 - show you one useful function is the
00:15 - square root function let's say that we
00:17 - have a bunch of variables we declared
00:19 - them but we have not yet assigned them i
00:21 - will assign a the square root of nine so
00:24 - after including this math header file i
00:27 - have access to a square root function
00:30 - so type sqrt then add a set of
00:33 - parentheses and within the parentheses
00:35 - we can find the square root of a number
00:37 - let's find what the square root of 9 is
00:39 - and then display it with a printf
00:41 - statement
00:43 - so the square root of 9 is 3.
00:45 - so let's move on we can raise a base to
00:48 - a given power by using the pow function
00:51 - the first number is the base let's raise
00:53 - 2 to the power of 4 and then display it
00:57 - 2 to the power of 4 is 16. we can round
01:00 - a number and i will store this within an
01:02 - integer
01:03 - let's round
01:05 - 3.14
01:06 - oh and then make sure you use the
01:08 - appropriate format specifier for ins
01:12 - 3.14 rounded is three
01:16 - now by using the seal short for sealing
01:19 - function we can always round a number up
01:23 - 3.14 rounded up is four
01:27 - likewise there's a floor function where
01:30 - we will always round down
01:32 - three point nine nine rounded down
01:36 - is
01:38 - three
01:38 - we can find the absolute value of a
01:41 - number that's how far a number is away
01:43 - from zero
01:44 - so it will take any negative numbers and
01:46 - make them positive
01:47 - the absolute value of negative 100
01:52 - and that would be positive 100 if you're
01:55 - familiar with logarithms we can find the
01:57 - logarithm of a number
02:00 - log 3
02:02 - is
02:03 - 1.098612
02:05 - and if you know some trigonometry
02:07 - there's various functions for sine
02:11 - cosine
02:13 - and tangent
02:15 - so what's the tangent of 45
02:19 - that is supposedly this number 1.619775
02:23 - so yeah everybody those are a few math
02:26 - functions that you might be interested
02:28 - in to use these just include this header
02:30 - file at the top math.h if you found this
02:33 - video helpful please be sure to smash
02:35 - that like button leave a random comment
02:37 - down below and subscribe if you'd like
02:39 - to become a fellow bro
