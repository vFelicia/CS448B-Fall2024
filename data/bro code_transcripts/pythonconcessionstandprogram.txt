00:00 - hey everybody today we will be creating
00:02 - a program to mimic a concession stand
00:04 - much like what you would see at a movie
00:06 - theater we will be utilizing a
00:08 - dictionary to keep track of a menu item
00:10 - and an Associated price more or less
00:13 - this is just a program to help us get
00:15 - used to working with dictionaries let's
00:16 - begin we'll create a dictionary named
00:19 - menu
00:20 - what items are on the menu we'll need an
00:22 - item and a price I'll think of some I'm
00:25 - going to speed up this video feel free
00:27 - to pause if you need more time
00:45 - and here's my menu everybody I thought
00:48 - of a few food items you might find at a
00:50 - movie theater concession stand pizza
00:51 - nachos popcorn fries chips soft pretzels
00:55 - soda lemonade movie theater popcorn is
00:58 - really expensive for some reason okay we
01:00 - have our menu a user is going to select
01:03 - specific keys from this menu depending
01:05 - on what the key is we can get the
01:07 - associated value to calculate a total to
01:10 - keep track of the user selected items I
01:12 - will create an empty list named cart I
01:15 - will also declare a variable named to
01:17 - Total to keep track of the total we need
01:20 - to lay this dictionary down flat to
01:22 - display it to a user well we do have the
01:24 - items method of a dictionary which we
01:26 - covered in the last video
01:28 - for every key value in our dictionary
01:33 - menu dot items method the items method
01:37 - of our dictionary will return a key and
01:40 - a value during each iteration
01:43 - I'm simply going to print every key and
01:46 - value
01:47 - I'll use an F string
01:48 - I will print every key
01:51 - colon space
01:52 - then a value
01:56 - let's take a look so far
01:59 - here's our menu I'll make a few changes
02:01 - the price will be in dollars and cents
02:04 - but feel free to pick your own unit of
02:06 - currency I'll precede my value with the
02:09 - dollar sign
02:10 - then using a format specifier I will
02:12 - display two decimal places 0.2 f
02:18 - that's better I will line up all the
02:21 - keys after the key I will add a format
02:24 - specifier then allocate 10 spaces
02:29 - yeah look at that it's all lined up now
02:31 - before and after displaying our menu
02:33 - with this for loop I will add some
02:35 - decorative text
02:39 - let's say menu
02:46 - then outside of the for Loop I'll
02:48 - display a bunch of dashes
02:56 - yeah look at that
02:57 - let's move on to the next step
03:00 - we will ask a user for some input what
03:03 - item would they like to buy from the
03:04 - menu
03:06 - while our condition will be true
03:08 - if our condition is set to True we'll
03:11 - need to break out of this Loop one way
03:12 - or another
03:14 - we will ask for some user input food
03:17 - equals input
03:20 - select
03:22 - an item
03:24 - Q2 quit
03:29 - if food is equal to a lowercase Q then
03:35 - we will break
03:37 - Let's test it
03:40 - select an item
03:42 - Pizza
03:43 - nachos soda
03:47 - Q to quit yeah it works okay what if the
03:51 - user types in capital Q
03:53 - well we can't escape the while loop
03:56 - if a user types in capital Q we're
03:59 - assuming that they would like to quit
04:00 - when we accept our user input I'm going
04:02 - to add dot lower method this will take
04:06 - our user input and make it all lowercase
04:10 - so we should be able to acknowledge any
04:12 - uppercase letters
04:14 - yeah it works cool
04:16 - let's add an elseif statement
04:19 - what if a user types in an item that's
04:22 - not on our menu
04:23 - well there is a get method of
04:25 - dictionaries
04:26 - if menu dot get
04:30 - pass in our food which is user input
04:34 - if the user selection is not within our
04:36 - menu as a key it will return none so we
04:41 - can use that
04:42 - else if menu dot get food is not none
04:49 - then we would like to append that food
04:51 - item to our cart
04:53 - cart
04:55 - dot append
04:57 - our food item
05:00 - so outside of the while loop
05:02 - I'm going to print our cart temporarily
05:05 - just to test it
05:09 - okay select an item
05:11 - Pizza
05:12 - soda
05:14 - pretzel
05:15 - how about a potato
05:18 - cuticquit we have our pizza soda and
05:21 - pretzel but not our potato we don't want
05:23 - that in our cart because that's not on
05:25 - the menu yeah you can just add that line
05:27 - else if menu item dot get food is not
05:31 - none
05:32 - that will complete our while loop let's
05:35 - calculate a total
05:37 - for every food in our cart
05:41 - let's take our total variable set this
05:43 - equal to total
05:45 - plus then we need a value associated
05:49 - with a key
05:52 - Plus
05:53 - menu dot get method
05:57 - get the food item found within our cart
06:00 - but I'm going to shorten this to Total
06:02 - plus equals
06:05 - menu dot get the value associated with
06:08 - this food in our cart
06:10 - I will also display that food item print
06:14 - food
06:15 - I'm going to avoid printing our food
06:17 - item on every line I will set the ending
06:20 - character in our print statement just to
06:23 - be a space
06:24 - okay let's see what we have so far
06:27 - I would like popcorn
06:30 - soda
06:32 - pretzel
06:33 - cue to quit
06:35 - popcorn soda pretzel
06:37 - then we will display the total
06:40 - I will print a new line
06:44 - print
06:46 - I'll use an upstring
06:49 - total is
06:54 - add a unit of currency total
06:57 - I'll add a format specifier 0.2 F to
07:01 - display two decimal places
07:03 - I'm going to add one line of decorative
07:05 - text
07:07 - let's copy maybe this
07:19 - all right let's test it out
07:26 - select an item
07:28 - popcorn
07:30 - pretzel
07:33 - soda
07:34 - potato
07:36 - quit
07:38 - all right here's our cart
07:40 - popcorn pretzel soda we did not include
07:43 - the potato that was not found within our
07:45 - dictionary the total is twelve dollars
07:47 - and fifty cents well there you have it
07:50 - everybody that is a concession stand
07:52 - program the point of this program was to
07:54 - help us get used to working with
07:55 - dictionaries a dictionary is a
07:58 - collection of key value pairs such as an
08:01 - item and a price and yeah that's a
08:04 - concession standard program in Python
