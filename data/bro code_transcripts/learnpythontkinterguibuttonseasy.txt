00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well and in
00:03 - this video i'm going to be teaching you
00:04 - guys about buttons in python so
00:06 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:13 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:16 - help keep this channel running
00:18 - buttons you click them and then they do
00:21 - stuff that's pretty much it
00:23 - so before we begin make sure you have
00:25 - this import at the top
00:26 - so first we'll begin by creating a
00:28 - window so we can add this button to the
00:30 - window
00:30 - so we'll create an instance of a window
00:32 - called window
00:34 - equals tk parentheses and then we'll
00:37 - need to display this window by typing in
00:39 - window
00:39 - dot main loop
00:43 - so this will create a window for us
00:45 - however we'll create a button next to
00:47 - add to this window
00:48 - so let me think of a descriptive name
00:50 - for this button
00:51 - maybe something unique like button
00:54 - so button equals button parenthesis and
00:57 - then we're going to list the component
00:59 - that we're adding this button to
01:01 - we're adding this button to our window
01:03 - and then let's also set some text
01:05 - so the text equals maybe click
01:08 - me let's make this a very aggressive
01:11 - button by adding some exclamation points
01:14 - and then we're going to pack this button
01:16 - so we can add this button to the window
01:17 - so button.pack
01:21 - and let's try it here's our button
01:25 - it says click me but when you click it
01:27 - it doesn't do anything
01:28 - so we can link this button to a function
01:32 - in our program
01:33 - so we use the command property so button
01:36 - dot config and then we're going to say
01:39 - command
01:40 - equals and then a function name but
01:43 - first we'll need to create a function
01:45 - so let's define a function maybe i'll
01:47 - call this click
01:49 - and what do we want to do when we call
01:51 - this function
01:52 - let's say we want to print
01:56 - hello that's good enough so with
01:59 - command we're going to set this equal to
02:01 - the function
02:02 - name make sure you do not include the
02:05 - parentheses
02:06 - so make sure you don't write this but
02:09 - this
02:09 - so that's the proper way to do this so
02:11 - what this does
02:12 - is that it performs callback
02:17 - of function
02:20 - and let's try this
02:24 - here's our button when we click this
02:26 - button it displays
02:27 - hello cool
02:31 - let's customize this button so let's
02:34 - change the font
02:35 - so button
02:39 - dot config and i'm going to copy this
02:43 - because we'll be using this quite often
02:46 - font equals
02:49 - let's say ink free for the
02:52 - font style and then
02:55 - a size maybe 50.
03:00 - and i'll make this bold
03:04 - it's a very aggressive button
03:08 - let's change the background color so
03:10 - button.config
03:12 - bg for background color and we can place
03:14 - a hexadecimal value here so let's pick a
03:17 - color
03:18 - it's an aggressive button so let's do
03:20 - something like
03:22 - an orangish red color that'll work
03:25 - so i'm going to copy that place this
03:28 - value here
03:30 - there we are let's also change the font
03:33 - color
03:36 - so button.config this time it is fg for
03:39 - foreground color
03:40 - and for this color maybe a bright neon
03:44 - yellow of some sort so copy this value
03:50 - paste it here and the
03:53 - font of the text should change
03:56 - now when we click this button it's white
03:58 - and black so we'll want to change that
04:01 - too
04:01 - so there's different properties for
04:03 - those active background
04:04 - and active foreground so let's change
04:07 - those next
04:08 - so button dot config
04:16 - and first we'll change active
04:20 - background equals another value
04:25 - so i'll just pick red that is ff000
04:32 - so when we click this button the
04:34 - background should now be red
04:37 - i think i'll change the font color after
04:39 - we click the button too because the
04:41 - default
04:42 - is black so this
04:45 - is active foreground
04:50 - and i will set it to be the same as our
04:52 - base foreground
04:53 - so it's this number
04:58 - there we go
05:01 - so the text is staying the same the same
05:03 - color but the background is changing
05:07 - now instead of some text let's add a
05:10 - image here instead
05:11 - so i have one image that's within my
05:14 - main folder this time
05:15 - so first we'll create a photo image so i
05:18 - will call this
05:19 - image equals photo
05:23 - image file equals
05:26 - and then the file path so since this
05:29 - file of mine it's called
05:30 - point emoji.png it's within my main
05:34 - folder the same place where my python
05:36 - file is located
05:37 - i can just list the file name here so
05:40 - that is point
05:41 - underscore emoji.png
05:46 - and then we're going to take button dot
05:50 - config
05:52 - and this image is going to be set to
05:56 - whatever the name of our images which is
05:58 - also image
06:00 - and let's run this so here is the
06:04 - picture that i have it's called point
06:06 - underscore emoji.png
06:08 - and it does the exact same thing however
06:10 - it replaced
06:11 - the text with the image that we listed
06:16 - if you need to display text as well as
06:18 - an image on your button what you could
06:19 - do is
06:20 - use the compound property so
06:22 - button.config
06:25 - compound and we can set this to
06:28 - top bottom left or right or none so
06:30 - let's try
06:31 - top so this places our picture on the
06:34 - top and the text on the bottom
06:37 - and we can reverse that with bottom
06:46 - left
06:48 - right
06:52 - and this is none
06:56 - which is what we had before basically
06:58 - however i believe i'm going to set this
07:00 - to
07:01 - bottom
07:04 - all right well up next let me teach you
07:06 - guys how we can
07:07 - disable a button so button dot config
07:13 - state equals either active or
07:16 - disabled so if this is set to disabled
07:20 - we can no longer click this button it
07:22 - doesn't do anything
07:25 - so this disables
07:28 - button and it's either active or
07:31 - disabled
07:33 - but i'm just going to turn this whole
07:35 - line of code into a comment because we
07:38 - still have work to do on this
07:44 - okay guys it's project time so we're
07:47 - going to create a project that's going
07:48 - to display
07:49 - how many times we have clicked this
07:51 - button since we ran it
07:53 - so instead of printing the word hello
07:55 - let's display
07:56 - a variable such as count but first we'll
07:59 - need to declare this
08:01 - so count and we'll set this equal to 0
08:03 - to begin
08:05 - and then we're going to make count a
08:07 - global variable
08:08 - so within our function click we're going
08:11 - to say
08:12 - global count and then after
08:15 - we click this button we're going to
08:18 - increment
08:18 - count by one so count plus equals
08:22 - one and then let's just print count for
08:25 - now
08:26 - just to be sure that this is working
08:30 - okay so one two three
08:34 - cool that's working then so now instead
08:36 - of displaying
08:37 - our count variable in our console window
08:40 - let's actually display this
08:42 - on our window so we're going to create a
08:44 - label to do this for
08:46 - us
08:49 - so i'm going to call this label
08:52 - label equals label we're adding this to
08:55 - our window
08:57 - and then we're going to set the text to
08:59 - equal
09:00 - count and then we're going to
09:04 - pack this label so label
09:08 - dot pack
09:15 - so it's up here you can't really see it
09:17 - though so let's change the font
09:22 - so label dot config
09:26 - font equals and i think i'll pick
09:31 - model space
09:35 - and 50 for the size
09:40 - okay it's up here however the label
09:43 - doesn't change so we're going to work on
09:44 - that next
09:46 - so within the function instead of print
09:50 - we're going to add label dot config
09:55 - text equals count
09:58 - and then that is pretty much it
10:01 - so let's try it again one two
10:05 - three all right
10:08 - you can also display a picture too why
10:12 - don't we create a second
10:13 - label so we'll do that here
10:17 - we'll call this label 2 equals
10:21 - label and we're adding this window or
10:24 - this label
10:25 - to our window and let's set the image to
10:28 - equal
10:29 - our point emoji image again we're just
10:31 - going to reuse this
10:33 - so what we're going to do after we click
10:36 - the button
10:37 - and we call this click function we're
10:39 - going to pack
10:40 - label to label2.pack
10:44 - so now when we click this button it's
10:47 - also going to display
10:48 - an image for us
10:52 - so that's your introduction to buttons
10:55 - in python if you'd like a copy of all
10:56 - this code i'll post everything in the
10:58 - comments down below but yeah that's an
11:00 - introduction to
11:01 - buttons in python hey you
11:05 - yeah i'm talking to you if you learn
11:07 - something new then you can help
11:09 - me help you in three easy steps
11:12 - by smashing that like button drop a
