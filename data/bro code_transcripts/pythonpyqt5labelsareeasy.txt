00:00 - what's up everybody in today's topic
00:02 - we're going to create some labels using
00:04 - pi qt5 we will import the widget of Q
00:09 - label this label class is used to create
00:12 - label widgets that can display text or
00:15 - images within the Constructor of our
00:17 - main window this is where we'll create a
00:20 - label we will declare a label object
00:23 - label equals call The Constructor for Q
00:28 - label for the text of the label we'll
00:31 - pass in a string that's the first
00:33 - argument let's say the word
00:36 - hello for the second argument we will
00:38 - pass in self self refers to this window
00:42 - object that we're calling and
00:44 - instantiating all right let's do a test
00:48 - run here is my label although you can
00:51 - barely see it the font is really small
00:53 - but it does say
00:55 - hello let's set the font we'll need
00:58 - another import
01:00 - from PI
01:03 - qt5 do QT
01:08 - GUI import Q
01:12 - font by importing the Q font class we
01:16 - can begin working with
01:17 - fonts we're going to take our label call
01:20 - the set font
01:23 - method within this method we will call
01:26 - the Constructor of Q
01:28 - font pick a font that would like I will
01:32 - pick aial but feel free to choose really
01:34 - any font then the second argument is a
01:37 - font size I'll pick
01:40 - 30 let's do another test
01:43 - run that's much better let's increase
01:47 - this to 40 for the font
01:49 - size now I'm going to set the geometry
01:52 - of this label such as the positioning
01:55 - and the width and the
01:58 - height let's let's take our
02:01 - label use the set geometry method we
02:06 - will pass in X and Y coordinates 0 0
02:09 - corresponds to the top left corner for
02:12 - the width let's set the width to be 500
02:14 - and the height to be
02:17 - 100 that's better I'll cover more
02:20 - advanced alignments
02:22 - momentarily let's add a Styles
02:24 - sheet pqt does have styles that are very
02:27 - similar to CSS if you would like to
02:30 - learn more about CSS I do have a full
02:31 - course on that topic we will add some
02:34 - CSS like Properties by accessing our
02:37 - label object call the method of set
02:41 - style
02:44 - sheet within this method we will pass in
02:47 - some CSS like properties such as a
02:51 - color for the color let's say blue these
02:55 - CSS like properties should end with a
02:58 - semicolon and now the font color is blue
03:02 - you could also use RGB values or heximal
03:05 - values you could always look up a Color
03:08 - Picker and pick a very specific
03:11 - color let's pick something
03:14 - green we can either use RGB values or
03:18 - heximal values so I will copy this
03:23 - value so I will paste that heximal value
03:27 - and now we have a very specific shade of
03:30 - green but I think I'll go with something
03:34 - dark such as
03:38 - that so this color is going to be a dark
03:42 - gray
03:43 - color we could set a background color
03:45 - this will be a new
03:50 - string background dasc
03:54 - color and I will pick a new
03:56 - color I will pick something blue
04:04 - that's a decent
04:09 - color we have a blue background with
04:12 - dark gray
04:13 - text we can set the font to be bold font
04:17 - weight will be
04:21 - bold so the font is now
04:24 - bold the font style can be italic font
04:29 - style
04:32 - italic so our font is italic and we can
04:37 - underline text
04:40 - decoration
04:44 - underline the text on our label is now
04:47 - underlined let's work on positioning
04:50 - next currently my text is left Justified
04:53 - and set to the center
04:55 - vertically to work with alignments we
04:57 - need this import from
05:00 - Pi
05:02 - qt5 QT
05:06 - core import
05:09 - QT the class of QT is used for
05:14 - alignments to Center the text of our
05:16 - label at the top vertically we will take
05:19 - our label use the set alignment
05:23 - method then pass in a flag access the
05:26 - class of qot access the flag
05:30 - of align
05:32 - top this will align our text vertically
05:36 - to the
05:39 - top so then our text is aligned
05:42 - vertically to the top rather than the
05:45 - center for the
05:49 - bottom we will use the flag of Al line
05:55 - bottom we will align vertically on the
05:58 - bottom
06:00 - the text is now on the
06:02 - bottom to align vertically in the
06:05 - center align V
06:11 - Center this will be vertically
06:14 - Center which it was
06:17 - originally now for horizontal alignment
06:19 - we can add the
06:21 - following okay to align right we will
06:24 - pass in a flag of align
06:28 - right or is
06:31 - onally align
06:35 - right the text is now all the way to the
06:40 - right for the
06:42 - center align H H for
06:46 - horizontal
06:50 - Center the text is now horizontally
06:53 - aligned in the
06:56 - center for the left
07:03 - Al line
07:08 - left the text will be aligned to the
07:11 - left we could combine both horizontal
07:14 - and vertical
07:17 - positioning here's how take our label
07:21 - call the set alignment
07:24 - method we will align horizontally in the
07:27 - center follow this with the or or
07:29 - bitwise operator which is a vertical bar
07:32 - this allows us to combine Flags we will
07:35 - align horizontally in the center then
07:38 - vertically let's align to the
07:41 - top so our text should be aligned
07:44 - horizontally we're aligned in the center
07:47 - and vertically we're aligned to the
07:50 - top align bottom
07:55 - vertically horizontally we are in the
07:57 - center vertically we're on the bottom
08:01 - then for the very center of our
08:09 - label Al line horizontal
08:13 - Center and Al line vertical
08:21 - Center our text will now be in the very
08:24 - middle of our label both horizontally
08:27 - and
08:27 - vertically now there is a shortcut for
08:30 - the very center we don't need both of
08:32 - these
08:34 - flags the shortcut is the
08:36 - following set
08:39 - alignment align
08:42 - Center that will align the text both
08:44 - horizontally and
08:46 - vertically so that is Center and Center
08:50 - all right everybody so that is an
08:51 - introduction to labels in pi qt5
