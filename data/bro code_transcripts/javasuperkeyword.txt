00:00 - hey what's going on everybody to bro
00:02 - hope you're doing well and in this video
00:03 - we're going to be creating some
00:05 - superhero objects using the super
00:07 - keyword in java so
00:08 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:13 - you too can become a hero and save our

00:23 - well okay everybody let's talk about the
00:24 - super keyword this refers to the super
00:27 - class
00:27 - also known as the parent class of an
00:30 - object that's assuming that you're using
00:31 - inheritance
00:32 - it's very similar to the this keyword
00:36 - this refers to the class that this
00:38 - keyword contains
00:39 - and super is referring to this object's
00:42 - parent class
00:43 - so here's an example i have two
00:44 - additional classes a class called
00:46 - person and a class called hero like a
00:49 - superhero
00:50 - that extends the person class so let's
00:52 - set these two classes up what are some
00:54 - attributes that
00:55 - a person would have they would probably
00:57 - have a name
00:59 - and an age so string name and edge then
01:02 - let's also create the constructor for
01:04 - this class but we'll set the parameters
01:06 - up later
01:07 - and then for heroes let's assume that
01:09 - all heroes have a superpower
01:11 - so this will be string power and let's
01:14 - also create the constructor for this
01:15 - class called hero
01:18 - now when we create a hero object let's
01:20 - say that we want to pass in some
01:22 - arguments
01:22 - so let's create our first hero object
01:25 - hero let's call this hero
01:26 - hero1 equals new hero
01:30 - and then we'll send some arguments to
01:32 - our constructor for hero
01:34 - so let's say we want a name an age
01:37 - and a power in that order so our first
01:40 - hero will have a name of
01:43 - batman and then an age of maybe 42
01:46 - and batman's power is well he's rich so
01:49 - his power is money
01:51 - all right now we need to set up the
01:53 - parameters for our hero constructor
01:55 - so we need a string an integer
01:58 - and a string again string
02:02 - name ins age and
02:05 - string power and we are going to assign
02:09 - these values to each of the attributes
02:11 - that our heroes have
02:13 - so this dot name
02:16 - equals name this dot age
02:20 - equals age and this dot power equals
02:24 - power
02:25 - now the way that i have written this
02:27 - does work but it's actually not the best
02:29 - way to do this
02:30 - since we declared our name and age
02:33 - variables within
02:34 - the person class we should really assign
02:36 - these values
02:37 - within the constructor for the person
02:39 - class and with our hero class
02:41 - we only declared a power variable
02:44 - so we should assign the power value
02:47 - within
02:48 - the constructor of this specific class
02:50 - so what we would like to do is send our
02:52 - name value and age value to the
02:56 - super class to the constructor of the
02:58 - superclass
02:59 - and if you want to get the attention of
03:01 - the superclass
03:02 - you have to use the super keyword and
03:04 - the super keyword
03:05 - works very similar to the this keyword
03:08 - this refers to this class that we're in
03:11 - super refers to the super class also
03:14 - known as the parent class
03:15 - which in this case is person so we would
03:18 - like to call
03:19 - the constructor of the superclass person
03:23 - so we have super setup that's referring
03:25 - to our person class and now we need to
03:27 - call the constructor
03:28 - so all we do after super is add a set of
03:31 - parentheses
03:32 - and that is it and we would like to pass
03:35 - in
03:36 - the name and age value as arguments so
03:38 - let's do that
03:39 - name and age and we no longer need
03:43 - these two lines we can simply put these
03:45 - within the constructor of
03:47 - our superclass person and our person
03:50 - constructor will take care of that for
03:52 - us
03:52 - but we also have to set up the
03:54 - parameters for name and age
03:56 - string name and int edge
04:00 - and that's it so you can see that
04:03 - that error went away so when we create
04:06 - a hero object we're going to pass in a
04:08 - name an
04:09 - age and a power and when we construct a
04:12 - hero object we have
04:14 - our parameters set up a name an age and
04:16 - a power
04:17 - because all heroes should have a name
04:19 - and age and a power
04:20 - so we're immediately going to send our
04:23 - name
04:23 - and age values to the constructor of the
04:26 - super class which is person
04:28 - and the person constructor will take
04:30 - care of that for us because
04:31 - that's its job to assign names and age
04:35 - values to
04:36 - those variables so then we can actually
04:38 - print out all of these values
04:40 - system.out.printline hero1
04:44 - dot name and let's do the same thing for
04:46 - age and power
04:49 - hero1.age and hero1.power
04:54 - and this should display everything
04:57 - batman he's 42 and his power is money
04:59 - so let's create another hero for another
05:01 - example so
05:02 - this will be hero2 and this will be
05:06 - superman i don't know how old superman
05:09 - is but let's say he's 43
05:11 - and his power well he can do a lot of
05:13 - things so let's just say his power is
05:15 - everything and let's get rid of these
05:18 - print line statements because we won't
05:19 - need them anymore
05:21 - all right so one thing we can do too is
05:23 - use the super keyword
05:25 - to call a method within the superclass
05:28 - so let's say our person class has a
05:30 - tostring method to display the name
05:32 - and the age variables so let's create
05:35 - that
05:36 - so we need to add the public keyword to
05:38 - this there's a
05:39 - separate video on that public we're
05:41 - returning a string
05:43 - and this is the two string method and
05:46 - all we're going to do is return
05:48 - our name and our edge so return this
05:52 - dot name i'll add a new line just to
05:56 - format this
05:59 - plus this dot edge
06:04 - and a new line and we should be good
06:08 - so here's where the super keyword comes
06:10 - in let's say we have a
06:12 - tostring method within our hero class as
06:15 - well
06:15 - and i'm just going to copy this and make
06:18 - a few changes
06:20 - so we also have a tostring method within
06:23 - our
06:23 - hero class so what we could do
06:26 - is first return the name
06:30 - and the edge so we would like to call
06:33 - the tostring method of our super class
06:36 - so we're going to use
06:37 - the super keyword dot and use the to
06:41 - string method but we would also like to
06:43 - add the power that we have
06:45 - so we're just going to tack on plus
06:48 - this dot power
06:52 - and that's it and let's display hero 2's
06:56 - attributes so system.out.printline
06:59 - hero2.2
07:00 - string and this should display all of
07:04 - the attributes that our hero has
07:06 - superman he's 43 years old and his power
07:09 - is basically
07:10 - well everything so that's the basics of
07:13 - the super keyword it's really referring
07:15 - to
07:15 - the superclass of an object whereas this
07:18 - refers to
07:19 - this class well that's the basics of the
07:22 - super keyword if you would like a copy
07:24 - of all this code i will post all of this
07:27 - in the comments down below
07:28 - but yeah that's the basics of the super
07:30 - keyword
07:31 - in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you
