00:02 - hey yeah pseudoelements pseudo elements
00:04 - are used to style specific parts of an
00:07 - element here's the formula we have a
00:09 - selector
00:10 - two colons and then a pseudo element for
00:13 - example we can style the first letter of
00:16 - any h1 elements
00:18 - in this example let's create a sample
00:20 - paragraph
00:21 - i'll use a pair of paragraph tags and
00:23 - generate some sample text by typing
00:25 - lorem and then tab i would like to style
00:28 - only specific parts of this paragraph
00:31 - tag in my style sheet i would like to
00:33 - select any p elements and to use
00:36 - pseudoelements i will type two colons
00:39 - and here's a list of the possible pseudo
00:41 - elements i would like to change the
00:43 - first letter of any paragraph tags
00:46 - perhaps i will change the font size
00:48 - to maybe 40 pixels
00:51 - and the font style to italic
00:56 - these properties will only be applied to
00:58 - this specific part of this element let's
01:02 - change the first line the selector will
01:04 - be p elements again two colons
01:07 - first
01:08 - line
01:10 - and i will make the first line what
01:12 - about blue sky blue
01:15 - and the first line is now blue and if
01:18 - you do resize this window
01:20 - the length of this first line is going
01:22 - to change in this next example we'll
01:24 - need two lists i will use unordered
01:26 - lists
01:30 - the first unordered list will have an id
01:32 - of list one
01:33 - and the second list an id of list two i
01:36 - will add three list items to each
01:38 - unordered list
01:41 - okay list one will have html
01:44 - css and javascript
01:48 - list two will have c
01:50 - c plus plus
01:52 - and c our next pseudo element is before
01:55 - we can add some content before an
01:58 - element so i would like to select any
02:00 - list items and i will add some content
02:02 - before each of these list items one
02:05 - useful property to combine with the
02:07 - before pseudo element is content
02:10 - we can append some content before an
02:12 - element
02:13 - maybe before each of these elements i
02:15 - would like to append maybe some text an
02:18 - image or an icon
02:20 - maybe in this example i'll append an
02:22 - emoji before each of these elements
02:25 - so i'm using windows to select an emoji
02:27 - i can hold windows and semicolon
02:30 - and i would like to append a check mark
02:32 - before each of these elements
02:34 - what we're doing here is saying before
02:36 - all list items append this content now
02:40 - what we did is select all list items
02:42 - within our page if i would like only a
02:45 - specific list styled this way i can
02:48 - precede the selector with the name of
02:50 - the parent
02:51 - let's change the list items of anything
02:53 - found within the list1 parent class
02:56 - we will proceed list item with the name
02:58 - of the parent list one
03:01 - then hashtag so this selector is all
03:04 - list items found within list one
03:08 - now after is kind of the same thing
03:10 - uh this time i will give each of these
03:12 - list items a unique id
03:22 - we can use an id as a selector so maybe
03:25 - i will select css
03:27 - and use the after pseudo element
03:30 - and then add some content after this
03:32 - list item
03:34 - so maybe i will add
03:36 - a hand pointing to the left kind of like
03:38 - we're currently learning css
03:40 - so we added some content after this
03:42 - element
03:44 - there is also a marker pseudo element
03:46 - with all list items i would like to
03:48 - change the marker
03:51 - the markers are these bullets in an
03:53 - unordered list or the numbers in an
03:55 - ordered list
03:56 - so i'll list items let's say that the
03:58 - color of the marker will be silver
04:02 - so that is the marker pseudo element
04:04 - and the last one is selection
04:07 - this text is selected with a blue
04:08 - background and white text so let's
04:11 - change that to something else
04:13 - so i will select my paragraph
04:15 - two columns
04:16 - and selection
04:18 - so let's change the color to white
04:21 - and the background to what about black
04:25 - so when we select this text the
04:27 - background color is black and the text
04:29 - is white so that is the selection pseudo
04:31 - element so yeah those are pseudo
04:33 - elements they're used to style specific
04:36 - parts of an element so yeah those are
04:38 - pseudo elements if this video helped you
