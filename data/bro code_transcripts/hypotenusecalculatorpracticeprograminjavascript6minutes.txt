00:01 - hey welcome back everybody in this video
00:03 - we're going to create a practice program
00:05 - to find the hypotenuse of a right angled
00:08 - triangle and the formula to solve that
00:10 - is c equals the square root of a squared
00:14 - plus b squared we'll create two
00:15 - variations of this program first we'll
00:17 - accept some user input via some prompts
00:20 - then later on we'll adjust this program
00:22 - and accept some user input through some
00:24 - html text boxes let's begin let's
00:27 - declare three variables each for side a
00:29 - b and c
00:30 - let a
00:32 - let b
00:33 - and let's see we'll accept some user
00:35 - input for sides a and b
00:38 - a equals window dot prompt
00:42 - and the prompt will be enter side a
00:46 - when we accept user input it's a string
00:48 - we'll need to convert that to a number a
00:51 - equals number pass in a
00:54 - let's do the same thing for side b
00:56 - let's copy and paste what we have but
00:58 - change a to b
01:02 - and the formula to calculate the
01:03 - hypotenuse goes a little something like
01:05 - this
01:06 - c
01:07 - equals we'll need to square sides a and
01:10 - b and add them together we can use
01:12 - javascript math
01:14 - dot
01:15 - power function
01:17 - a to the power of two
01:20 - plus
01:21 - copy this paste it
01:23 - b to the power of two then we need to
01:26 - square all of this and that equals c
01:28 - so in the next step we could set c
01:30 - equal to
01:32 - math dot square root
01:36 - and pass in c
01:37 - if you would like to do this in less
01:39 - steps you could copy all of this
01:42 - cut this line
01:43 - and paste what we just copied so this
01:45 - would only take one line of code then at
01:47 - the end we will display side c
01:50 - side
01:51 - c
01:53 - c okay let's run this
01:56 - enter side a
01:58 - a is three
02:00 - b is four
02:01 - side c equals five okay now let's make a
02:04 - more advanced version of this program
02:06 - we'll accept some user input via some
02:08 - html text boxes
02:10 - so let's head to our html file and add a
02:13 - couple elements we'll create three
02:15 - labels
02:17 - label the first will have an id
02:20 - equal to maybe a
02:22 - label then close this tag and i'll add a
02:25 - line break
02:26 - then i'll copy this paste it
02:29 - will have a b label and a c label i'll
02:32 - change the text to side a colon
02:37 - side b
02:39 - and side c
02:41 - okay and this is what we have so far
02:43 - i'll add two text boxes right underneath
02:46 - a and b and then a button later we'll
02:48 - create a self-closing input tag
02:51 - then i'll add a line break at the end
02:53 - before i forget
02:55 - set the type
02:56 - equal to
02:58 - text because it's a text box
03:00 - and i will give this a unique id of a
03:04 - text box
03:07 - okay let's copy this
03:09 - then underneath b label and give this
03:11 - text box an id of b text box okay this
03:14 - is what we have so far
03:16 - then i'll create a button underneath
03:18 - this second text box so right here
03:22 - so we'll create a pair of button tags
03:25 - and a line break i'll set the type equal
03:28 - to button
03:30 - and an id of what about submit
03:34 - button then i should probably add some
03:36 - text
03:37 - so between the button tags
03:39 - submit so let's save then heading back
03:41 - to our javascript file this is what we
03:44 - have to type this will be a little bit
03:46 - advanced for us because we haven't
03:47 - discussed functions yet when we click on
03:49 - this button we need to do something to
03:51 - select this button we will type document
03:54 - dot
03:55 - get
03:56 - element by
03:58 - id within the parentheses we will list a
04:02 - unique id
04:04 - i would like the id of my submit button
04:08 - then follow this with dot
04:10 - on click when we click on this button we
04:13 - would like to do something we would like
04:14 - to perform a function function
04:17 - parentheses curly braces within the
04:20 - curly braces we will execute some code
04:22 - and actually we can copy a lot of what
04:24 - we have here so let's copy our previous
04:26 - code and paste it but we need to change
04:29 - a couple things around we would not like
04:30 - window prompts so let's change this line
04:33 - to a
04:34 - equals
04:36 - document
04:38 - dot get
04:39 - element by id
04:43 - and i would like to get the value of
04:45 - this text box which has a unique id of a
04:49 - text box
04:52 - follow this with dot value we're taking
04:54 - the value of this text box and assigning
04:57 - it to variable a when we accept user
04:59 - input it's normally a string we're going
05:01 - to convert it to a number
05:03 - let's do the same thing with b so copy
05:06 - that line paste it
05:08 - change a to b here and here as well
05:12 - then convert it to a number
05:15 - we can keep this line of code the logic
05:16 - is still the same and lastly we can
05:19 - update this label i'm going to change
05:21 - this around real quick
05:22 - i don't want to display anything but
05:24 - we'll still keep the label i'm going to
05:26 - change the inner html of this label
05:29 - c label
05:32 - document dot get
05:34 - element
05:35 - by
05:36 - id we are selecting
05:39 - c label and i'm going to change the
05:42 - inner html
05:44 - and set this equal to
05:46 - side c
05:48 - colon space
05:49 - plus c okay so make sure you save both
05:53 - your html document and your javascript
05:55 - file and let's run this
05:57 - so side a is three side b is four let's
06:00 - press submit and side c is five so yeah
06:04 - everybody that is a practice program to
06:06 - find the hypotenuse of a right angled
06:08 - triangle if you would like a copy of all
06:10 - this code i'll post this in the comments
06:12 - section down below if this video helped
06:14 - you out feel free to help me out by
