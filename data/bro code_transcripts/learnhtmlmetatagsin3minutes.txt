00:02 - yeah let's begin so meta tags the meta
00:05 - element represents various kinds of
00:08 - metadata that cannot be expressed using
00:11 - the title base link style and script
00:14 - elements metadata is data about data we
00:17 - can add metadata to the head of our
00:20 - document and this tells the web browser
00:22 - what our web page is about with the meta
00:24 - tags we place them within the head not
00:27 - the body so we can tell the web browser
00:29 - some information about our web page meta
00:31 - tags are self-closing we do not need a
00:34 - closing tag meta tags do have a name
00:37 - attribute that we can set to one of many
00:39 - settings let's say we would like to add
00:41 - a description to this webpage
00:43 - and the web browser is going to read
00:45 - this description after setting the name
00:47 - equal to description i can set the
00:50 - content equal to a brief description of
00:53 - my webpage
00:54 - uh perhaps free
00:56 - html tutorial for beginners
01:00 - okay so that's one example of a meta tag
01:02 - so let's create another so meta again
01:05 - these are self closing tags and i can
01:07 - add some keywords for search engine
01:09 - optimization
01:11 - so name keywords
01:13 - content
01:14 - and i'll explain my web page in just a
01:16 - few keywords uh perhaps html separate
01:19 - each of these with a comma
01:21 - tutorial
01:23 - beginners that'd be good we can add a
01:25 - author
01:27 - meta
01:28 - name
01:28 - equals author
01:31 - content equals and then type your name
01:36 - so if somebody is viewing your web page
01:38 - on a mobile device you can have your web
01:40 - page scale to their mobile device by
01:43 - adding this meta tag name equals
01:46 - viewport
01:48 - content
01:50 - equals
01:52 - and this will set the width of our web
01:54 - page
01:55 - equal to device dash width
01:59 - then comma we can set the initial
02:02 - scale
02:03 - equal to 1.0 so by adding this meta tag
02:07 - if you were to view this webpage on a
02:09 - mobile device this web page will scale
02:12 - proportionately with that mobile device
02:14 - another meta tag is a char set
02:18 - we can tell a web browser what sort of
02:20 - character encoding that we're using so
02:22 - authors are encouraged to use utf-8 for
02:25 - unicode
02:26 - so if you want to use basic ascii
02:28 - encoding you would write ascii here
02:30 - although that's discouraged authors are
02:32 - encouraged to use utf-8 for unicode all
02:35 - right and the last thing i'm going to
02:37 - show you is that we can set our webpage
02:39 - to automatically refresh after a given
02:42 - amount of seconds
02:43 - so meta
02:45 - http dash equiv is the attribute name
02:50 - equals
02:51 - refresh
02:54 - and the content equals how many seconds
02:56 - you would like to wait to have your
02:58 - browser refresh
02:59 - uh perhaps 30.
03:01 - okay so i'm going to open this with live
03:04 - server so if i set this to 30 seconds
03:06 - it's not going to be that visible you're
03:09 - gonna have to wait until we see this
03:10 - refresh let's set this to something more
03:12 - drastic like two seconds let's crank
03:15 - this up yep see it's refreshing every
03:17 - two seconds uh but let's set that back
03:19 - to 30. two seconds was just an example
03:22 - so yeah those are meta tags they
03:24 - represent metadata metadata is data
03:27 - about data by adding meta tags we can
03:29 - tell a web browser information about our
03:32 - website such as a brief description
03:34 - keywords author we can set the viewport
03:37 - for mobile devices you can set a refresh
03:40 - rate stuff like that and then be sure to
03:42 - add meta tags to the head element of
03:44 - your document so yeah those are meta
03:47 - tags if you found this video helpful
