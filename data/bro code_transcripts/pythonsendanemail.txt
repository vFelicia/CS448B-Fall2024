00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:02 - bro hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to show you
00:04 - all how we can send an email using
00:06 - python so
00:07 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - oh a quick note for you all you're going
00:13 - to need a gmail account to sign into as
00:16 - well as your username and password
00:18 - so once you have those set you're ready
00:20 - to begin all right let's begin by
00:22 - importing the
00:23 - simple mail transfer protocol library
00:26 - we'll need a couple variables to hold
00:28 - strings let's say we have a sender
00:30 - a receiver a password
00:36 - a subject for your email as well as
00:40 - a body for the email okay sender is
00:42 - going to be you signing the email
00:44 - so enter your email in here i'm just
00:46 - going to make up one you
00:48 - at gmail.com actually sender would be
00:51 - better i would say let me change that
00:53 - sender gmail.com let's say we have a
00:56 - receiver this is who you're going to
00:57 - send the email to
01:00 - receiver gmail.com
01:03 - don't actually enter in these emails use
01:04 - your own or the person that you intend
01:06 - to send the email to for your test
01:08 - because these will probably not work i'm
01:10 - assuming
01:11 - then enter the password for your gmail
01:13 - account so let's say
01:16 - password123 and a subject
01:19 - uh let's say python email
01:23 - test and a body what do you want to say
01:26 - within your email
01:28 - i wrote an email
01:32 - okay so that should be good so remember
01:34 - that you're going to want to change
01:36 - these to your actual
01:37 - gmail account and you'll want to send it
01:39 - to a valid email address too
01:41 - and make sure that you use your password
01:43 - for your gmail account
01:45 - okay now we're going to create a header
01:46 - for our email and the syntax on this is
01:49 - a little strange we're going to say
01:50 - message
01:52 - f and then triple quotes so what this
01:55 - triple quotes is
01:56 - is that a triple quote string can span
01:59 - multiple lines of text so the first
02:02 - thing we'll enter is
02:03 - from within our header from and then
02:06 - since we're using an f-string we can
02:08 - insert
02:09 - a variable at a given location when we
02:12 - insert
02:12 - a pair of these curly braces so from
02:16 - will be sender the next line
02:19 - to colon
02:23 - receiver then the next line
02:26 - subject colon
02:30 - subject this will be the title of the
02:32 - email then i'm going to add a new line
02:35 - and then insert the body
02:39 - and if you want you can give yourself a
02:41 - name when you send this email
02:43 - let's say maybe snoop dogg and if
02:46 - there's somebody you want to send the
02:47 - email to
02:48 - and give them a name you can say like
02:51 - nicholas
02:52 - cage but these aren't necessary
02:55 - okay so we have our header completed let
02:58 - me just add a note that this is our
02:59 - header
03:01 - okay we're going to create a server
03:03 - object
03:04 - server equals smtp
03:08 - lib dot smtp
03:13 - there are two arguments the first is
03:16 - smtp
03:21 - the other argument is the port number
03:23 - and that is going to be
03:25 - 587 that is the default mail submission
03:28 - port
03:29 - 587 now we're going to take our server
03:32 - object
03:32 - and start tls transport layer security
03:38 - okay now we need to log in so server
03:42 - dot login we will pass in
03:46 - our sender email that's us as well as
03:49 - our password
03:52 - password and let's print
03:58 - logged in
04:02 - we'll eventually place all this within a
04:04 - try and accept block later
04:06 - all right and then to send an email type
04:10 - server.send mail
04:12 - and we pass in our self sender
04:16 - receiver and our message
04:19 - sender comma receiver
04:23 - comma message and let's print a
04:26 - confirmation
04:28 - print email has
04:31 - been sent now if you were to run this
04:35 - program
04:36 - you may encounter this error smtp
04:39 - authentication error that either means
04:41 - your username
04:42 - password combination was not correct or
04:45 - you need to turn on
04:46 - the less secure app access on your gmail
04:49 - account
04:50 - which you can find here however i would
04:52 - recommend turning that back off when
04:54 - you're done with this program just
04:55 - because
04:56 - your account will be less secure and i'm
04:58 - not liable if you get hacked hey you
04:59 - know what
05:00 - let's place this code within a try block
05:02 - we will try
05:03 - all of this code and then if we
05:06 - encounter
05:06 - this exception we can catch and handle
05:09 - it properly
05:10 - so we will try these four lines of code
05:13 - and we will handle
05:14 - our exception of smt lib dot
05:17 - smtp authentication error
05:21 - that means we could not sign in so let's
05:23 - print
05:24 - unable to sign in
05:28 - so i'm going to run this one more time
05:30 - and instead of getting that ugly error
05:32 - we should get a simple message that says
05:34 - unable to sign in once you have the
05:36 - proper username password combination for
05:38 - your gmail account
05:39 - and if you need to set less secure app
05:42 - access to on
05:43 - but make sure that you turn it back off
05:44 - when you're done with this you should be
05:46 - able to send an email
05:47 - let's try it logged in email has been
05:50 - sent
05:50 - here is a snapshot of the email that i
05:53 - received
05:54 - i blurred out my actual email because i
05:56 - don't want it public because
05:57 - some of you guys are weird so we have
06:00 - our sender
06:01 - our receiver and i gave myself a
06:03 - nickname of snoop dogg that's why it
06:05 - says snoop
06:06 - to nicholas the receiver but you don't
06:08 - actually need a name for these as long
06:10 - as you have the sender and receiver
06:12 - fields filled in you should be good
06:14 - we have our subject python email test
06:17 - as well as our body i wrote an email
06:20 - well everybody that's how to write and
