00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
00:02 - hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to
00:04 - demonstrate some useful string methods
00:06 - in python so
00:07 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - if you find this video helpful please
00:14 - remember to like
00:15 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:18 - help keep this channel running
00:19 - all right let's do this in this video
00:22 - i'm going to be explaining and
00:24 - demonstrating a few useful methods
00:26 - available to us for strings
00:27 - now let's create a variable called name
00:30 - for this example and you can use your
00:31 - own name if you want
00:32 - so we now have a variable called name
00:35 - and for my first example
00:37 - let's print the length of our name
00:39 - variable
00:40 - so to do that we can surround our name
00:43 - variable with the length method and this
00:46 - will print and return
00:47 - how long the length of our string is and
00:50 - for me
00:50 - the length of my name variable is three
00:53 - for three characters
00:54 - if i were to increase the size of my
00:56 - name well then
00:58 - that's going to change to a so that is
01:00 - the length method and i'm just going to
01:02 - turn
01:02 - this line into a comment and let's move
01:05 - on so next we have
01:06 - the find method i just copy and pasted
01:09 - print name
01:10 - so i can reuse it name dot and actually
01:13 - if you have intellisense setup
01:14 - if you add dot after your variable
01:17 - you'll get a suggestion or a few
01:19 - suggestions of
01:20 - different methods and other features
01:22 - that you have access to
01:24 - so let's find find which is
01:28 - uh screw this i'll just type find find
01:31 - then we can find the first index of
01:34 - where this character is
01:35 - let's say i would like to find where
01:37 - capital b is
01:38 - well that is at index zero because
01:41 - computers always start with zero
01:43 - so this first character would be zero
01:45 - then r
01:46 - would be one and then o would be
01:50 - two for this example alright so that is
01:52 - how to find a character
01:54 - within a string moving on so let's
01:57 - capitalize our name and i should
02:00 - probably make this lowercase
02:03 - so name dot capitalize
02:06 - and this will make my name capitalized
02:09 - but if there's any spaces
02:11 - and then additional words it's not going
02:13 - to capitalize that only the first
02:15 - letter in your string next we have
02:19 - upper this will make your string all
02:21 - uppercase
02:22 - name upper and now
02:25 - it is uppercase guess what's next
02:29 - lower name dot lower
02:33 - and i should probably make this capital
02:35 - again
02:37 - and everything is lowercase
02:40 - we're making some good progress today
02:42 - next we have
02:44 - is digit this will return true or false
02:47 - depending on if our string is a digit
02:51 - which it's not so this will print false
02:54 - if i changed my string to a bunch of
02:56 - numbers like 1 2 3
02:57 - then this will return true let's change
03:00 - that back
03:01 - and move on next we have
03:05 - is alpha
03:08 - are these alphabetical characters
03:13 - oh make sure you add the parentheses
03:15 - afterwards my bad
03:17 - false because we added a space within
03:21 - here
03:22 - now it's true so you can use is alpha to
03:26 - check to see if your string contains
03:28 - only letters
03:29 - alphabetical letters next we have
03:34 - count we can count how many characters
03:37 - are within our string
03:39 - i would like to count how many o's are
03:40 - in here and this should return
03:42 - two that's right okay we're almost at
03:46 - the end
03:47 - we can replace characters within our
03:49 - string
03:50 - so we use the replace method and we pass
03:54 - in two arguments
03:56 - the character we would like to replace
03:58 - and the character we would like to
04:00 - replace our character with
04:02 - i would like to change all o's to a's
04:04 - and now
04:05 - my name is brockhod oh you guys are
04:08 - gonna like this next one
04:09 - this isn't technically a method but it's
04:12 - a really neat feature
04:13 - so one thing that we can do that's
04:14 - available to us with python is that we
04:16 - can display
04:17 - a string multiple times by multiplying
04:20 - that string by a given number
04:22 - so let's say i would like to display my
04:24 - name three times i can just take my
04:26 - string variable
04:27 - then add times three and this will print
04:29 - my name
04:30 - three times bro bro bro like i said not
04:33 - technically
04:34 - a method but it's a useful feature that
04:36 - you might be interested in that's
04:37 - related
04:38 - all right everybody so that is a few
04:41 - useful methods available to us for
04:43 - strings
04:43 - if you would like a copy of all this
04:45 - code i will post this in the comments
04:47 - section down below
04:48 - but yeah those are a few useful methods
04:51 - available to us
04:52 - for strings hey you yeah i'm talking to
04:55 - you
04:55 - if you learned something new then help
04:57 - me help you in three easy steps
05:00 - by smashing that like button drop a
