00:00 - hey what's going on everybody today I'm
00:02 - going to talk about static methods in
00:04 - Python a static method is a method that
00:07 - belongs to a class rather than any
00:10 - object from that class any instance
00:13 - instance methods we're already familiar
00:15 - with them they are methods that belong
00:17 - to individual objects created from that
00:19 - class they're best for operations on
00:22 - instances of that class any objects
00:25 - whereas static methods they're best for
00:27 - utility functions within a class that do
00:30 - not need access to class data I'll
00:32 - demonstrate the differences between an
00:34 - instance method and a static method
00:37 - we'll Begin by creating a class of
00:40 - employee we'll need a Constructor let's
00:43 - define
00:45 - that to create an employee object we'll
00:48 - need a name and a job
00:51 - position we will assign self. name
00:55 - equals name self.pos
01:00 - equals
01:02 - position we will create an instance
01:04 - method of get info we will return
01:07 - employee
01:09 - info we will return an F string where we
01:13 - will display self.
01:17 - name equals
01:23 - self.pos get info is an instance method
01:26 - each object that we create from this
01:28 - class will have their their own get info
01:31 - method to return the information on that
01:33 - object the object's name and the
01:35 - object's position now we'll create a
01:38 - static
01:39 - method to create a static method we need
01:41 - a decorator of static method static
01:46 - methods are best for General utility
01:48 - functions within a class we'll Define a
01:51 - method to check to see if a job a
01:54 - position is valid which we will name is
01:58 - valid
02:01 - position so static methods they don't
02:03 - have self as the first argument we're
02:05 - not working with any objects created
02:07 - from this class to check to see if a
02:09 - position is valid we will pass in a job
02:12 - position which I will name as
02:16 - position I will create a list of
02:19 - valid
02:22 - positions let's assume that our company
02:24 - is the Crusty Crab what are some valid
02:27 - positions a manager is a valid
02:30 - position a
02:32 - cashier a cook then let's say a
02:38 - janitor then we will return we'll use a
02:42 - membership
02:43 - operator check if position that we
02:48 - receive is in our list of valid
02:54 - positions what we have done is that we
02:56 - have created a static method we don't
02:59 - need to rely on any objects to use this
03:01 - method for
03:04 - example to use a static method we will
03:07 - use the name of the class rather than
03:09 - any object that we create from this
03:11 - class such as
03:13 - this we don't need to do
03:16 - that we type the class name followed by
03:20 - the static method is valid
03:26 - position then I did set this up to
03:29 - accept one argument
03:30 - let's check to see if a cook is a valid
03:36 - position then I do need to print this
03:38 - what is the
03:41 - output a cook is a valid position what
03:44 - about a rocket
03:46 - scientist that would probably be sy's
03:49 - job that is false a rocket scientist is
03:53 - not a valid position at the K crusty
03:55 - crab this is a static method it belongs
03:58 - to the class not any object created from
04:01 - that class now let's create a few
04:03 - employee objects let's say employee one
04:07 - equals a new
04:09 - employee we have to pass in a name and a
04:12 - job Eugene will be the first name that's
04:15 - Mr Krabs he will be a
04:19 - manager employee
04:22 - 2 equals
04:25 - employee
04:27 - Squidward will be a
04:31 - cashier employee
04:34 - 3 equals
04:36 - employee employee 3 will be
04:39 - SpongeBob SpongeBob will be a
04:43 - cook to call an instance method we have
04:46 - to access one of the instances of the
04:48 - class in order to use
04:49 - it if I want to check the info on
04:52 - employee 1 I will access that object
04:55 - that
04:56 - instance use the get info method
05:00 - then I need to print
05:03 - it take employee one get the info Eugene
05:08 - is the manager let's do this with
05:10 - employee 2 and employee
05:15 - 3 Eugene Mr Krabs is the manager
05:19 - Squidward is the cashier SpongeBob is
05:21 - the cook for an instance method you
05:24 - access an object then call the instance
05:26 - method with the static method you you
05:29 - only need to access that class you don't
05:32 - even need to create any objects from
05:33 - that class it's a general utility
05:37 - method all right everybody those are
05:39 - static methods they're a method that
05:42 - belongs to a class rather than any
05:44 - objects created from that class they're
05:46 - usually used for General utility
05:48 - functions that do not need access to
05:51 - class data and well everybody those are
05:53 - static methods in Python
