00:00 - hey what's going on everybody in this
00:02 - video I'm going to teach you everything
00:03 - you need to know to get started working
00:04 - with JavaScript as a beginner so why
00:07 - don't you go ahead and sit back relax
00:09 - and enjoy the show
00:12 - JavaScript is a programming language
00:14 - used to create Dynamic and interactive
00:16 - web pages JavaScript runs on a web
00:19 - browser such as Google Chrome Safari
00:21 - Edge whatever you use to browse the
00:23 - internet basically by using JavaScript
00:25 - we can respond to user actions and
00:28 - transform user input whenever somebody
00:29 - interacts with our site in this example
00:32 - I have a calculator written with HTML
00:34 - it's not very pretty and it doesn't
00:36 - function we have the framework that we
00:38 - need at least though by applying CSS we
00:40 - can add color and style to this
00:42 - calculator but unfortunately it still
00:44 - doesn't function by including JavaScript
00:46 - code this calculator can perform actions
00:49 - and as well useful so in this video I'm
00:52 - going to show you everything you need to
00:53 - know to get started working with
00:55 - JavaScript I would recommend knowing
00:57 - HTML and CSS before starting the series
00:59 - I do have a full free course on my
01:02 - channel if you're interested in learning
01:03 - those or if you need a refresher if you
01:06 - don't know either you could probably
01:08 - still get by watching this video I'll
01:10 - walk you through both as we go along
01:11 - throughout the series series now before
01:13 - we do begin you will need a text editor
01:16 - one text editor that I recommend is vs
01:18 - code which you can download from
01:21 - code.visualstudio.com for a step-by-step
01:24 - instruction of how to install it feel
01:25 - free to check out the HTML and CSS
01:27 - series with that out of the way let's
01:29 - Dive Right In so what we'll need to do
01:32 - is create a new project folder in vs
01:34 - code you can go to the left toolbar go
01:37 - to explore we will open a folder I'll
01:39 - place this folder on my desktop just for
01:41 - convenience
01:43 - I will create a new folder which I will
01:45 - name website to contain my website files
01:49 - let's select this folder
01:52 - and we are now within our website folder
01:55 - we'll need three files an HTML file CSS
01:58 - file and JavaScript file we'll begin
02:00 - with the HTML file
02:03 - we can close out of this welcome window
02:05 - I will name my HTML file index.html
02:10 - in a website the index.html file is
02:13 - typically used as the home page
02:15 - we have our HTML file next comes the CSS
02:18 - file mine will be named style.css the
02:23 - CSS style sheet is in charge of the
02:25 - overall appearance of the web page this
02:27 - can include fonts colors positioning
02:30 - stuff like that then lastly we have the
02:32 - Javascript file which I will name
02:34 - index.js
02:36 - the Javascript file is in charge of the
02:38 - interactivity of a web page so
02:40 - altogether we have structure style and
02:43 - actions
02:44 - so rearrange these tabs however you like
02:47 - I switch back and forth between the
02:49 - JavaScript and HTML file quite often so
02:51 - I tend to put them right next to each
02:52 - other but do whatever's most convenient
02:54 - for you so to generate the necessary
02:57 - text to create a web page in your HTML
02:59 - file in vs code you can type exclamation
03:02 - point then hit tab
03:04 - so here you can change the title of your
03:06 - web page if you want I'll change my
03:08 - title to be my
03:10 - website
03:11 - and that's all we'll need for now now
03:14 - we'll need to link the style sheet to
03:16 - the HTML file now we are going to create
03:19 - a link tag we can link an external style
03:22 - sheet to our HTML file within the link
03:24 - tag there is a relationship attribute
03:27 - shortened to Rel the relationship will
03:30 - be style sheet we are linking a style
03:33 - sheet then the next attribute we need is
03:35 - the href attribute where is the CSS file
03:39 - located
03:40 - well it's right next to each other we
03:42 - only need the file name
03:43 - so we are linking the CSS style sheet
03:47 - now our CSS style sheet is linked to our
03:49 - HTML file now we need to link the
03:52 - Javascript file to our HTML file
03:55 - we can do that by adding a pair of
03:57 - script tags
03:59 - we will set the source attribute to be
04:01 - the name of the JavaScript file
04:04 - index.js
04:06 - all right everything should now be
04:08 - linked together
04:09 - the last thing we'll need is the live
04:11 - server extension in vs code
04:13 - go to extensions
04:16 - we will search for live server
04:21 - it should be this one
04:23 - we are going to install this extension
04:27 - so whenever we save any changes to our
04:29 - files the web page should refresh
04:31 - automatically
04:33 - so now let's test this you can go to
04:35 - file save or use the shortcut
04:39 - I'm just going to save everything
04:42 - I'm going to right click on our HTML
04:44 - file then open with live server
04:48 - and here's our web page but it currently
04:50 - doesn't have anything
04:51 - let me just minimize this
04:54 - I will readjust this window
04:56 - throughout this course I'll have vs code
04:58 - alongside a web browser with our HTML
05:01 - file we can add elements such as an H1
05:03 - element these are typically used as
05:06 - headers I'm going to say hello
05:08 - then save and that should update
05:10 - automatically or you can press the
05:12 - refresh button but since we have live
05:14 - server installed we shouldn't need to
05:17 - then paragraphs are typically used for a
05:20 - paragraph a text in vs code to generate
05:23 - a random paragraph of text you can type
05:25 - lorem then hit tab
05:27 - now we should have a random paragraph
05:29 - I believe it's Latin at least it looks
05:31 - like it to change the style of our web
05:34 - page we can go to our style sheet to
05:36 - change the style of the body of our
05:38 - document we will select body
05:41 - I'll change the font family to something
05:43 - else font family
05:45 - how about verdana
05:48 - there we now have a different font
05:50 - to increase the font size you can set
05:52 - the font size property to be either in
05:56 - pixels or em personally I'm a fan of
05:58 - using em 2em means 200 percent
06:02 - where 3 em is 300 but that's a little
06:06 - too big let's stick with 2 em
06:09 - all right and that is everything we need
06:11 - to get started oh important note you do
06:13 - want your script element at the bottom
06:15 - of the body of your document just in
06:17 - case there's an error with your
06:19 - Javascript file you do want all of the
06:21 - HTML elements to at least render first
06:23 - before running any JavaScript code
06:25 - alright so let's delete our H1 elements
06:28 - and our paragraph element we no longer
06:30 - need them for now
06:32 - be sure to save everything
06:34 - we'll work with some basic output I'm
06:37 - going to zoom in a little bit
06:38 - to Output some text you can type console
06:42 - .log add a set of parentheses then a
06:45 - semicolon at the end within the set of
06:47 - parentheses to Output some text you can
06:49 - either use double quotes
06:51 - single quotes or backticks personally
06:55 - I'm a fan of using these back ticks this
06:57 - is known as a template literal they're
06:59 - helpful with inserting variables which
07:01 - we will discuss in the next lesson using
07:03 - either double quotes or single quotes or
07:06 - back ticks we can output some text let's
07:08 - say the word hello
07:10 - be sure to save I'm holding Ctrl s on
07:13 - Windows there's no apparent output we
07:16 - have to go to Dev tools so right click
07:18 - on your web page go to inspect
07:21 - then console and here's our basic output
07:24 - hello
07:25 - for an additional line of output we can
07:27 - console.log again let's print a
07:30 - different message
07:31 - I like pizza
07:34 - let's save and here's my second line of
07:37 - text I like pizza
07:39 - and I'm just going to move these windows
07:41 - a little bit that's better throughout
07:44 - much of the series we will be working
07:45 - with this window again you have to right
07:47 - click on your web page go to inspect
07:49 - then go to console
07:52 - now within our web page to create an
07:54 - alert box you can type window dot alert
07:58 - add a set of parentheses semicolon to
08:01 - the end we'll use a template literal
08:03 - we'll need a set of backticks
08:06 - this is an alert
08:09 - this should create a pop-up window
08:12 - this is an alert
08:16 - let's create another
08:18 - let's copy what we have pasted
08:21 - I like pizza
08:24 - let's save
08:26 - this is an alert okay
08:28 - I like pizza not sure why we need to
08:31 - tell a user that but we can now we have
08:33 - comments to create a comment you type
08:36 - two forward slashes
08:38 - comments aren't used for output they're
08:40 - used as notes for yourself or for other
08:42 - Developers
08:43 - this is a comment so when I run this
08:47 - program then if we were to go to our Dev
08:49 - tools
08:50 - we don't see this comment at all they're
08:52 - not displayed as output they're either
08:54 - used for notes for yourself or for other
08:56 - people for a multi-line comment you can
08:59 - type a forward slash asterisk anything
09:02 - that comes after will be a comment
09:05 - this is a comment you can see that the
09:10 - text is green that means it's a comment
09:14 - again we should not be able to see these
09:16 - comments they're hidden I'm going to
09:19 - turn this JavaScript code into comments
09:21 - just for the next part because these
09:23 - window alerts are kind of annoying to be
09:25 - honest
09:26 - all right now what we're going to do is
09:28 - populate our web page with some text
09:30 - within our HTML file I will create an H1
09:34 - element
09:36 - H1s are usually used for headers or
09:38 - titles there will be no text content yet
09:41 - but I will set an ID
09:43 - I will give this H1 element a unique ID
09:47 - of my H1 feel free to pick a different
09:50 - ID something you'll remember
09:52 - I will also create a paragraph element
09:55 - I will set the ID to equal my P meaning
09:59 - my paragraph so remember there is no
10:02 - text content currently using JavaScript
10:04 - we will add some text content first we
10:07 - need to select these elements by their
10:09 - ID my H1 and my P
10:13 - uh let's do that here we will type
10:16 - document meaning the document of our web
10:19 - page
10:20 - dot get element by ID do pay attention
10:25 - to the capitalization
10:27 - what id are we getting let's start with
10:30 - my H1 so copy the ID
10:33 - paste it within the set of parentheses
10:35 - be sure you're including quotes as well
10:37 - follow this with DOT text content we
10:42 - will set the SQL to
10:44 - how about the word
10:46 - hello
10:48 - let me zoom out a little
10:49 - again this can be back ticks single
10:52 - quotes or double quotes all right let's
10:55 - type the word hello now when I save
10:59 - and refresh the page
11:01 - that H1 element should display the word
11:03 - hello
11:04 - now this time let's get our paragraph
11:07 - element with the ID of my P my paragraph
11:11 - document dot get element by ID the ID
11:16 - that we're getting is my P will change
11:20 - the text
11:22 - content equal to uh what can we say
11:26 - I like pizza
11:31 - there we go hello I like pizza all right
11:34 - everybody so that's the basics of
11:35 - JavaScript when working with basic
11:38 - output you can use console.log which we
11:40 - will be using a lot to create an alert
11:42 - you can use window.alert to change the
11:45 - text content of an HTML element you
11:48 - first have to select that element then
11:50 - change the text content then set it
11:52 - equal to some text of your choosing all
11:55 - right everybody so that is the very
11:56 - basics of JavaScript and in the next
11:58 - topic we will cover variables
