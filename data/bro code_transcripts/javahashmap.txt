00:00 - hey I was it going everybody its bro
00:01 - here hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video we're going to be discussing hash
00:05 - maps in Java and at the end of this
00:07 - video we're going to be creating a hash
00:10 - map of countries and capitals and we're
00:13 - going to be displaying it in a neat
00:15 - organized table so let's get into it
00:19 - before you reach the end of this video
00:22 - make sure to LIKE comment and subscribe
00:25 - so that we together can challenge and
00:27 - defeat the mighty YouTube algorithm what
00:31 - is going on everybody so for this video
00:34 - we're gonna be discussing hash maps so
00:36 - hashmaps are very similar to array lists
00:40 - they store a series of objects kind of
00:44 - like a normal array but there are a lot
00:46 - more user friendly but the difference
00:48 - between a hash map and an ArrayList is
00:51 - that hash maps can store key value pairs
00:55 - so for example what might come to mind
00:57 - is a name and an email it's going to
01:00 - store a pair of information a key value
01:04 - pair so with a name there's usually an
01:06 - associated email or vice-versa
01:08 - or a username and an associated ID and
01:12 - for the example we're going to be
01:14 - working on for this video is that we're
01:16 - going to create key value pairs of
01:18 - countries and their associated capitals
01:21 - so in order to use a hash map we need to
01:24 - import one thing at the top of our
01:25 - program so we're going to tell you
01:27 - import Java dot util dot hash map I
01:34 - don't know why but saying hash map makes
01:36 - me think of hash browns now to create a
01:39 - hash map this is what we're gonna type
01:40 - we're going to type in hash map make
01:43 - sure to get the capitalization right the
01:45 - H and the M are capital then we need a
01:48 - unique name for this hash map so I'm
01:51 - going to call this country's equals new
01:55 - hash map parentheses semicolon
01:59 - step two is that next to the word hash
02:02 - map we're going to add a set of angle
02:04 - brackets and then we're going to list
02:06 - the datatypes
02:08 - of the information that we're storing so
02:10 - if we're storing a country and an
02:12 - associated capital we're going
02:13 - to store two strings here and then make
02:17 - sure the S is capital now if you're
02:19 - storing different data types for example
02:21 - an integer
02:22 - well these hash Maps only store objects
02:25 - so you need to use encapsulation whoa
02:27 - hey guys it's bro from the future here
02:29 - so I actually made a mistake at this
02:31 - point I wrote down need to use
02:33 - encapsulation what I meant to write was
02:36 - need to use wrapper class encapsulation
02:39 - is something completely different from
02:40 - wrapper classes and I tend to mix up
02:42 - those two encapsulation has something to
02:44 - do with privacy statuses and wrapper
02:47 - classes that's the concept of taking a
02:50 - primitive data type and converting it to
02:52 - an object so when I say need to use
02:55 - encapsulation for this part I meant to
02:57 - say need to use in the wrapper class
03:00 - that is all time to go back to the
03:02 - future so for example if you need to
03:04 - store a string and a value that's an
03:07 - integer instead of writing int here you
03:09 - would write the whole word integer with
03:12 - a capital I if you need to store a
03:14 - double you type in double with a capital
03:16 - D or boolean with a capital B so you get
03:21 - the idea so we're going to store two
03:23 - strings both have capital S and then
03:25 - we're going to place this within the
03:28 - other set of angle brackets as well all
03:30 - right here is our hash map and it's
03:32 - called countries now we want to place
03:34 - some key value pairs within our hash map
03:37 - countries so I'm just going to add a
03:40 - note that says add a key and value and
03:44 - in order to do this this is where we're
03:46 - gonna type the name of our hash map
03:48 - countries dot put whoa there we go not
03:55 - sure what happened there it just freaked
03:56 - out so countries dot put and then we
03:59 - need it to values to place within here
04:01 - the first is going to be a country so
04:03 - maybe for an example let's type in USA
04:06 - and for the second value we will type in
04:09 - the capitol of the United States which
04:11 - is Washington DC let's add a few more
04:15 - countries so we're going to type in the
04:17 - name of our hash map dot and then use
04:19 - the put function not sure why he keeps
04:22 - freaking out like that and then we're
04:24 - going to add another country how about
04:26 - India
04:27 - and the capital of India is New Delhi
04:34 - and just to save time I'll copy these
04:37 - but I think you get the idea so maybe
04:40 - we'll add Russia and the capital of
04:44 - Russia is Moscow and China and the
04:50 - capital is Beijing okay we have our
04:54 - countries now we can actually display
04:56 - all the values all the objects within
04:59 - our hash map so all we need to do is
05:01 - type in system dot out dot print line or
05:06 - just print and what we're going to type
05:09 - in here it's just the name of our hash
05:11 - map all right let's try it so even
05:16 - though this is displaying all of the
05:18 - values all of the key value pairs within
05:21 - our hash map it's not too pretty though
05:23 - so we're going to be formatting this
05:25 - later but let me show you a few other
05:28 - useful functions for hash maps so I'm
05:30 - just going to turn this into a comment
05:32 - for now and let's start fresh now we can
05:37 - remove a country from our hash map so
05:40 - we're going to type in the name of our
05:42 - hash map so countries dot remove and
05:46 - then type in a key so let's say that the
05:50 - USA goes rogue and they are no longer
05:53 - considered a country all right so we're
05:55 - going to remove the USA and then we are
05:58 - going to display countries so let's see
06:01 - if it's still there yep and it appears
06:05 - that the USA is missing so let me show
06:08 - you guys a few other functions so we can
06:10 - also get a capital from one of these
06:15 - keys then so we're going to type in the
06:17 - name of our hash map again so countries
06:19 - dot and this one is get and then we need
06:24 - to add a key here so let's get Russia
06:32 - then I'm just going to get rid of this
06:34 - print line okay so this doesn't appear
06:37 - to do anything so what we're gonna do is
06:39 - put this within a print
06:40 - statement because right now it's
06:43 - returning whatever the value is for
06:45 - Russia so system dot out dot print or
06:48 - print line and then within the
06:51 - parentheses countries dot get Russia so
06:54 - this is going to return the capital of
06:56 - Russia which is Moscow okay moving on so
07:02 - let's clear everything so we're going to
07:05 - type countries dot clear and then we are
07:11 - going to display our hash map so system
07:15 - dot out dot print line countries and
07:18 - let's see if all the countries are still
07:21 - there which they are not everything's
07:25 - missing now everything's been cleared
07:26 - out okay moving on let's display the
07:31 - country's size the size of our hash map
07:34 - how many key value pairs we have in here
07:36 - so what we'll do for this is type in the
07:40 - name of our hash map countries dot size
07:43 - and then we need to put this within a
07:46 - print line statement I guess printer
07:51 - print line and let me get rid of this
07:54 - for now okay so this will display the
07:58 - size of our hash map how many key value
08:03 - pairs are worth in here basically and
08:04 - there are four one two three four that
08:07 - is correct let's replace one of the
08:10 - values for a specific aid more
08:12 - specifically the USA so type in the name
08:16 - of the hash map dot and we're going to
08:18 - use the replace function so we need to
08:21 - specify the key let's replace the value
08:25 - for the USA so we need to replace this
08:28 - with a new value so let's say that
08:30 - President Trump decides that the new
08:33 - capital of the u.s. is going to be in
08:35 - Detroit and then let's display our hash
08:40 - map so system dot out dot print line
08:43 - countries yep and the new capital of the
08:47 - USA is Detroit okay I have two last
08:51 - functions to show you guys so we're
08:53 - going to check to see
08:54 - if a certain key is within our hashmap
08:57 - and there is a specific function to use
09:00 - this or to do that so countries then dot
09:04 - then we're going to use the contains key
09:07 - function and we're going to look for a
09:10 - certain key to see if it's there
09:12 - let's check to see if England is in here
09:15 - now this returns a boolean value true or
09:19 - false so if we were to have it just like
09:22 - this
09:22 - this wouldn't appear to do anything so
09:24 - let's actually display what this returns
09:26 - by putting this within a print statement
09:28 - so system dot out dot print and then
09:33 - just surround this function with a set
09:36 - of parentheses so if England is a key
09:41 - within our hash map it's going to return
09:43 - true if it doesn't find it it returns
09:45 - false now let's check to see if our hash
09:48 - map contains a certain value so it's
09:51 - going to be very similar to what we had
09:53 - up here so I'm just going to copy and
09:55 - paste this but we're going to use the
09:57 - contains value function and let's search
10:02 - for perhaps Beijing so if this value is
10:07 - within our hash map it's going to return
10:09 - true if not it returns false but Beijing
10:12 - is a value within our hash map so it
10:15 - returns true okay
10:18 - so the last thing I'm going to show you
10:19 - guys is a decent way of displaying all
10:22 - of the key value pairs within a hash map
10:24 - and you can actually use a or each loop
10:27 - to do this so this is what we're going
10:29 - to type we're gonna type four then a set
10:33 - of parentheses string with a capital S
10:36 - we have to list the datatype of what
10:38 - we're displaying so string with the
10:40 - capital S we'll use I for an index then
10:43 - a colon and then countries dot key set
10:49 - so this will iterate once for each key
10:52 - within our hash map and let's just
10:56 - display system dot out dot print I to
11:01 - begin with and let's see what we have so
11:04 - far oh let's make this print line
11:08 - my bed okay USA China India Russia so
11:12 - let's also display the value as well so
11:16 - I'll just make another line for this
11:18 - system dot out dot may be print line
11:22 - okay if we want to display a value for
11:25 - an associated key what we're gonna type
11:28 - is countries dot get PI and let's try it
11:36 - now
11:38 - okay we're getting somewhere
11:40 - but I'm gonna make a few changes we're
11:42 - going to change the first line to just
11:44 - print and then I'm going to add how
11:47 - about a tab so we'll use the escape
11:52 - sequence for a tab character plus maybe
11:55 - an equal sign and then I'll add a space
11:58 - after so let's check to see this now and
12:02 - what we get is a somewhat decent looking
12:05 - table when we display all the key value
12:08 - pairs for our hash map so that's the
12:10 - basics of hashmaps if you would like a
12:12 - copy of all this code i'll post it in
12:14 - the comments down below and pin it to
12:16 - the top and your assignment is to create
12:18 - a hash map and then display all of the
12:21 - key value pairs and then take this
12:23 - display and post it in the comment
12:25 - section but yeah that is how hashmaps
12:28 - work in java hey you yeah I'm talking to
12:32 - you if you learn something new then you
12:34 - can help me help you in three easy steps
12:38 - by smashing that like button drop a
