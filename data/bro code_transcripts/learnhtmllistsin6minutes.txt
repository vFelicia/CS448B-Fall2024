00:00 - hey everybody today I'm going to explain
00:01 - how we can create different lists in
00:04 - HTML there's three different types of
00:06 - lists that we'll discuss today unordered
00:08 - ordered and description lists for an
00:10 - unordered list think of maybe a grocery
00:13 - list the order of items doesn't matter
00:15 - to create an unordered list you need a
00:18 - pair of UL tags
00:21 - UL meaning unordered list then between
00:24 - the pair of UL tags you need to list
00:27 - items
00:28 - Li means a list item
00:30 - so we have a little bullet point let's
00:32 - create a grocery shopping list maybe we
00:36 - need to buy milk let's create another
00:38 - list item
00:40 - we need another pair of list item tags
00:43 - let's buy eggs
00:47 - what else can we buy milk eggs bread
00:52 - and what about coffee
00:57 - there we are here's our unordered list
00:59 - each list item is bulleted hey let's add
01:02 - a title to this list preceding the pair
01:04 - of UL tags let's use maybe an H4 header
01:08 - tag
01:09 - let's say groceries
01:12 - here are the groceries I want to buy the
01:15 - order doesn't matter so we're using an
01:17 - unordered list now you can create nested
01:19 - lists too let's change coffee to Coffee
01:22 - supplies
01:24 - then after this list item we'll create
01:27 - another unordered list
01:30 - then we need more list items
01:32 - so for coffee supplies of course we
01:34 - would need coffee or maybe coffee beans
01:39 - now we have a hollow bullet point
01:42 - maybe you need some creamer for your
01:44 - coffee and or sugar
01:49 - so that's how to create a nested list
01:51 - within a list within your list you can
01:54 - create another list now let's go over
01:56 - order lists to create an ordered list
01:58 - you need a pair of ol tags meaning
02:01 - ordered list
02:03 - then you need some list items
02:05 - what about a to-do list
02:07 - so we need a list item
02:10 - so number one that's first in our list
02:13 - we need to eat breakfast
02:17 - I'm gonna add a title to so let's use a
02:20 - pair of H4 header tags
02:22 - this will be my two do list
02:26 - one we need to eat breakfast
02:31 - two
02:32 - go to school or go to class
02:36 - so that's number two
02:40 - number three
02:42 - after class you have to walk your dog
02:47 - then four maybe you have to go to work
02:50 - all right that is an ordered list use a
02:52 - pair of ol tags then lastly we have a
02:55 - description list this one's a little
02:57 - more tricky a description list is made
03:00 - of key value pairs you have a term and a
03:03 - definition to create a description list
03:05 - you need a pair of DL tags meaning
03:08 - description list
03:10 - we need some terms to create a term you
03:13 - type DT
03:14 - then close it
03:16 - so I play a lot of Dungeons and Dragons
03:18 - let's create some definitions for some
03:21 - mythological creatures like a dragon
03:24 - so that's my term
03:26 - let's create a few other terms
03:29 - dragon
03:31 - v-nix
03:33 - vampire
03:35 - and werewolf
03:38 - so these are the terms underneath each
03:40 - term we can add a definition
03:43 - we'll need a pair of DD tags for
03:46 - description definition I'm going to
03:48 - Google each of these creatures then just
03:50 - paste the definition that I find
03:53 - so for a dragon I'm just gonna copy this
03:55 - definition
03:58 - then paste it within the DD tags
04:02 - here's my term and here's my definition
04:05 - of that term Dragon a mythical monster
04:07 - resembling a giant reptile sometimes
04:10 - shown as having wings let's do this with
04:12 - our other definition terms as well
04:15 - next we have Phoenix
04:19 - definition an immortal bird associated
04:22 - with Greek mythology
04:25 - we'll need a pair of DD tags add your
04:28 - definition
04:29 - then close it
04:33 - here's my second description definition
04:35 - then we need vampire and werewolf
04:42 - vampire creature definition
04:45 - let's copy this
04:49 - create another pair of DD tags
04:52 - then paste that definition
04:55 - here's the definition for vampire then
04:57 - lastly werewolf
05:01 - werewolf creature definition
05:04 - an individual that can shapeshift into a
05:07 - wolf
05:08 - so DD close it
05:11 - add that definition
05:16 - and there's our definition for werewolf
05:18 - so that's a description list in a way
05:21 - it's made of key value pairs you have a
05:23 - term which is represented with
05:25 - description term then a description with
05:27 - DD description definition I forgot to
05:30 - add a title to this list let's do that
05:33 - I'll use a pair of H4 header tags
05:36 - let's make the title mythical creatures
05:41 - not bad let's add a background color
05:43 - because well we can I'll add a
05:46 - background color to the opening DL tag
05:49 - so style equals
05:53 - background Dash color
05:56 - what's a good color for this what about
05:58 - light green
06:02 - I haven't discussed borders yet but to
06:04 - add a border you can type border colon
06:08 - then a size maybe two pixels then
06:10 - there's different borders but let's go
06:12 - with solid for now
06:14 - here's a border around my list all right
06:17 - everybody so that's how to create
06:18 - different lists in HTML we have
06:20 - unordered lists ordered lists and
06:23 - description lists you can style your
06:25 - lists as well but we haven't really
06:27 - discussed much CSS yet but yeah those
06:30 - are different lists in HTML
