00:00 - how's it going everybody it's you bro
00:01 - hope you're doing well and in this video
00:03 - i'm going to teach you guys a little bit
00:04 - about method chaining in java so
00:06 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - make sure you like comment and subscribe
00:15 - one like equals one prayer for the
00:17 - youtube algorithm
00:18 - all right welcome back guys and gals in
00:20 - this video we're going to discuss method
00:22 - chaining this is a common syntax
00:25 - for invoking multiple method calls in
00:27 - object oriented programming
00:28 - that's the definition i found on
00:30 - wikipedia this is useful for condensing
00:32 - code into
00:33 - less lines so let's create an object a
00:36 - string is a type of object
00:38 - let's say string name equals
00:42 - bro a lowercase you can use your own
00:44 - name if you want
00:45 - we can perform multiple methods on this
00:48 - variable
00:49 - name let's begin by concatenating our
00:51 - name with another name maybe your last
00:53 - name
00:54 - name equals name dot and let's use the
00:57 - concat method
00:58 - and i'm going to concatenate another
01:00 - string with our variable of name and
01:02 - i'll just add code to this
01:04 - and let's display our name
01:07 - system.out.printline
01:08 - name and my result is bro code
01:11 - so let's perform another method on this
01:13 - name for this example
01:15 - name equals name dot
01:19 - what do we got here how about two
01:21 - uppercase
01:24 - so this will make my name all uppercase
01:27 - so everything is all caps and let's
01:29 - perform
01:30 - one more method name equals name dot
01:34 - let me find a good one uh trim that's
01:37 - good
01:37 - so trim will remove any blank space
01:40 - before and after
01:41 - a string so i'll add a few spaces before
01:45 - and after my string and this will remove
01:48 - these blank spaces currently this
01:51 - program is taking up
01:52 - three lines of code to call three
01:54 - separate methods to condense this
01:56 - into less lines of code we can perform a
01:59 - little bit of method chaining
02:00 - so what i'm going to do is turn these
02:02 - three lines into
02:04 - comments for now and we will condense
02:06 - all of these three methods
02:08 - into one using some method chaining so
02:10 - let's begin by reassigning our name
02:12 - variable
02:13 - name equals and then we'll begin with
02:15 - name
02:16 - dot concat instead of adding the
02:18 - semicolon at the end
02:19 - i'm going to follow this with another
02:21 - dot and then i can call
02:22 - another method right away this time i'm
02:25 - going to call the
02:26 - two uppercase method and then why stop
02:28 - there i will follow this with another
02:31 - dot
02:31 - and use my trim method next so where is
02:34 - it
02:35 - there it is so this is name
02:38 - dot concat dot to uppercase
02:41 - dot trim and then add the semicolon at
02:43 - the end
02:44 - so we're combining all three method
02:46 - calls into one so that this takes up
02:49 - one line of code it's like a three hit
02:51 - combo boom boom boom
02:53 - so even though we have written this in
02:55 - less lines of code it is a little more
02:57 - difficult to read and understand
02:59 - especially if you're a beginner
03:00 - but i thought i would mention this
03:01 - because this is probably something that
03:03 - you will see
03:04 - one day this particular phenomenon so
03:07 - if you would like a copy of all this
03:08 - code i will post all of this in the
03:10 - comments down below
03:11 - and please be sure to drop a like leave
03:14 - a comment down below and subscribe if
03:16 - you'd like to become a fellow bro
