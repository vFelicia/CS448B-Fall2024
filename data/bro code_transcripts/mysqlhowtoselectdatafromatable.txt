00:00 - hey everybody in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how we can select data from a
00:03 - table to query all of the data from a
00:06 - table we would type select asterisk
00:09 - meaning all from the name of the table
00:12 - in my case we have table employees this
00:15 - statement select all from employees will
00:19 - give me all columns and all rows but
00:22 - sometimes you may not want all of the
00:24 - data here's a scenario your boss gives
00:26 - you a task of retrieving the full name
00:28 - of every employee well we don't need
00:30 - employee ID hourly pay or higher date
00:33 - for that right we just need a list of
00:35 - the first and last names of our
00:36 - employees table in place of the asterisk
00:39 - meaning all we can select specific
00:41 - columns such as first name and last name
00:48 - we have all of the first and last names
00:50 - from our employees table you can change
00:52 - up the order of the columns too this
00:55 - time I would like last name
00:57 - then first name
01:00 - with our query this returned all of the
01:02 - last and first names of all the
01:04 - employees point being you can select
01:06 - specific columns depending on what
01:08 - you're looking for or everything with
01:11 - the asterisk there is a clause known as
01:14 - the where Clause if we're looking for
01:16 - something specific
01:17 - let's add where
01:19 - then what are we looking for exactly we
01:22 - can write some criteria let's select all
01:25 - from employees where employee ID equals
01:30 - one then end your statement with a
01:32 - semicolon
01:33 - this will give us a specific employee
01:36 - the employee that has an ID of one if I
01:39 - set employee ID to be 2 that would give
01:42 - us Squidward
01:43 - three would be SpongeBob 4. Patrick I
01:48 - think you get the idea here's an
01:50 - exercise let's find all the data from
01:53 - employees where the first name equals
01:55 - SpongeBob
01:56 - where first name equals
02:01 - Sponge Bob
02:03 - this query will return employee ID3 the
02:07 - first name last name hourly pay and
02:09 - higher date here's another example let's
02:12 - find all employees that have an hourly
02:14 - pay greater than or equal to 15. our
02:17 - criteria will be where
02:19 - hourly
02:21 - pay
02:22 - is greater than we'll use the greater
02:24 - than operator
02:26 - or equal to
02:28 - 15.
02:30 - this returns three employees
02:33 - Mr Krabs Squidward and Sandy
02:36 - all three of them have an hourly pay of
02:39 - fifteen dollars per hour or greater it
02:41 - is possible your query can return
02:43 - multiple results let's find anybody that
02:46 - has a higher date
02:49 - less than or equal to
02:52 - perhaps the year 2023
02:56 - January 3rd
02:59 - this query returns two results
03:02 - Eugene Krabs and Squidward Tentacles
03:04 - they both match this criteria and in
03:07 - this case we use the less than or equals
03:09 - to operator another operator you should
03:11 - know about is the not comparison
03:13 - operator it's an exclamation point and
03:16 - an equal sign we will check if something
03:18 - is not equal
03:21 - let's find where employee ID does not
03:26 - equal one
03:29 - who are all the employees that have an
03:31 - ID not equal to one
03:34 - that gives a Squidward SpongeBob Patrick
03:37 - Sandy and Plankton
03:39 - on the other hand if I set this to one
03:40 - that would give us Mr Krabs that is the
03:44 - not comparison operator if you need to
03:46 - check if something is not equal
03:48 - in this next example let's pretend that
03:50 - we're human resources we need to find
03:53 - any employees that do not have a higher
03:55 - date and then begin the paperwork for
03:57 - them currently Plankton's hourly pay and
04:00 - higher date are both set to null null
04:03 - meaning no value
04:04 - in place of saying you know higher date
04:07 - equals null in place of using the equal
04:11 - sign we would type is select all from
04:14 - employees where higher date is null
04:18 - that would return Sheldon Plankton
04:21 - because his higher date is null
04:24 - not equals null that doesn't work
04:27 - it would be is null
04:30 - you could even say is not null
04:34 - that would return every employee that
04:36 - does have a higher date all right
04:38 - everybody so that is how to query data
04:40 - from a table select whatever you're
04:42 - looking for it can be everything
04:44 - or specific columns
04:47 - from a table of your choosing where the
04:50 - results equal some criteria that you set
04:52 - it really depends on what you're looking
04:54 - for and that is how to query data from a
04:57 - table
