00:00 - hey how's it going everybody it's your
00:01 - bro hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video i'm going to teach you guys about
00:04 - switches in java so
00:06 - sit back relax and enjoy the show

00:17 - if you'd like to become a fellow bro
00:20 - okay welcome back ladies and gentlemen
00:22 - in this video i'm going to explain how
00:24 - switches work a switch is a statement
00:26 - that allows a variable
00:28 - or other value to be tested for equality
00:31 - against
00:32 - a list of values so if you find yourself
00:34 - in a situation where you're using a lot
00:37 - of
00:37 - if statements back to back it's probably
00:39 - more efficient to use a switch statement
00:41 - instead
00:42 - here are the different data types that
00:44 - we can use to test for equality within a
00:46 - switch
00:47 - and according to this description one
00:49 - thing that we can check
00:50 - is the equality of a string for this
00:52 - program
00:53 - let's test to see if a string let's say
00:56 - it's going to be a day of the week
00:58 - is equal to a list of days of the week
01:02 - if there's a match we can display a
01:03 - custom message so let's say
01:05 - string day equals maybe friday because i
01:08 - like friday
01:09 - and we will create a switch to see if
01:11 - our day equals
01:13 - a certain day so this is how to create a
01:15 - switch type in the word switch
01:17 - a set of parentheses then a set of curly
01:19 - braces within the parentheses
01:21 - we're going to list the value or the
01:24 - variable we would like to test for
01:26 - equality
01:26 - against a listing of cases so
01:30 - our first case will be
01:33 - sunday this is what we're comparing our
01:36 - value
01:36 - or variable to we're going to compare
01:39 - this variable
01:40 - to our case so type in the word case
01:43 - followed by the value colon
01:46 - and if there is a match what would you
01:48 - like to do so i would like to perform a
01:51 - print line statement that states
01:53 - it is sunday
01:56 - and then this next part is important
01:58 - it's important to add
01:59 - the keyword break so we break out of the
02:02 - switch and continue on with the rest of
02:04 - our code
02:04 - so let's create another case for monday
02:08 - so i'm going to copy and paste change
02:10 - sunday
02:11 - to monday and i will print it is
02:15 - monday so i'm going to repeat this
02:18 - process
02:18 - a few times and it's done so i have a
02:21 - case for each day of the week
02:23 - sunday monday tuesday wednesday thursday
02:25 - friday saturday and i have a
02:27 - corresponding print line statement for
02:29 - each day of the week
02:30 - sunday monday tuesday so on and so forth
02:33 - so
02:33 - with our string of day we're going to
02:36 - place this within
02:37 - the switch statement to compare for
02:39 - equality against a list of values
02:42 - one by one our switch is going to
02:44 - evaluate our day
02:45 - against each case if there is a match
02:48 - it's going to perform
02:50 - this subset of code if there is no match
02:53 - it's going to
02:54 - continue down to the next case and check
02:56 - to see if
02:57 - these values are equal so let's test it
03:00 - currently our day is set to friday so
03:02 - this should display it is friday
03:05 - alright so let's change this to monday
03:07 - next
03:10 - and this will display it is monday all
03:13 - right this is why it's important to have
03:14 - these breaks after each case so i'm
03:17 - going to remove this
03:18 - for this demonstration and show you why
03:20 - these are important
03:23 - so if we were to run this again this
03:25 - time we do not have those breaks
03:27 - as soon as there is a matching case we
03:29 - will perform
03:30 - this subset of code as well as each
03:33 - subset of code that comes
03:35 - after our matching case so that's why
03:37 - it's important to have
03:39 - these breaks within well after each case
03:41 - within
03:42 - our switch so what if there is no match
03:45 - let's say our day
03:46 - is equal to pizza which is not a day but
03:49 - honestly it really should be
03:51 - well it will basically just do nothing
03:54 - so one thing that we could do is add a
03:56 - default default
03:58 - colon if there is no match what do we
04:00 - want to do
04:02 - system.out.printline that is not
04:05 - a day so let's try this again if there
04:08 - is no match
04:09 - within our switch we will perform
04:11 - whatever is set within the default case
04:14 - which displays pizza is not a did
04:17 - so that's all what a switch is it allows
04:20 - a variable or other value to be tested
04:22 - for equality
04:23 - against a list of values if you find
04:26 - yourself in a situation where you're
04:27 - using a lot of
04:29 - if statements it might be better to use
04:31 - a switch instead
04:32 - so that's all about switches if you'd
04:34 - like a copy of this code i will post
