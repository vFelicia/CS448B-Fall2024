00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:02 - bro hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to discuss
00:05 - the walrus operator in python
00:07 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - if you wouldn't mind please like comment
00:15 - and subscribe one like
00:16 - equals one prayer for the youtube
00:18 - algorithm
00:19 - alright people i hope you like walruses
00:22 - because that's the topic of this video
00:24 - we'll be discussing
00:24 - the walrus operator also known as an
00:27 - assignment expression
00:28 - it's a colon followed by an equal sign
00:31 - and it kind of looks like a walrus on
00:33 - its side
00:33 - now this is a new feature for python 3.8
00:36 - what it does is that it assigns values
00:39 - to variables
00:40 - as part of a larger expression here's an
00:42 - example of why the walrus operator would
00:44 - be useful
00:45 - let's say we have a variable named happy
00:47 - happy
00:48 - equals true if you're not happy or
00:50 - you're feeling so so you can set this to
00:52 - false if you want
00:53 - so let's print the value contained
00:56 - within happy
00:57 - so this will print true to the console
00:59 - window
01:00 - now wouldn't it be cool if we could
01:02 - combine both of these
01:03 - statements together so we would want to
01:06 - say something such as
01:07 - happy equals true and then print it to
01:10 - the console window
01:11 - using one line of code well normally we
01:14 - can't do this using the standard
01:16 - assignment operator now
01:17 - one thing that we can do is use the
01:19 - walrus operator this assigns a value
01:21 - to a variable as part of a larger
01:24 - expression
01:25 - so this would technically be allowed if
01:27 - this assignment operator was instead
01:29 - an assignment expression the walrus
01:31 - operator happy
01:33 - walrus true and when they're all within
01:36 - a print statement
01:37 - we can assign a value to a variable and
01:40 - use it as a part of a larger expression
01:42 - so as you can see
01:43 - this new variable of happy was assigned
01:46 - and used in one expression
01:48 - now here's a more practical example of
01:50 - why the walrus operator would be useful
01:53 - let's say we have the small program what
01:55 - this will do is consistently ask you
01:57 - what food you like and put it into a
01:59 - list called foods
02:00 - foods equals list while true food equals
02:04 - input what food do you like if food
02:07 - equals quit
02:08 - break then append our list of foods with
02:11 - this new food item that we have
02:12 - okay let's run this then so this while
02:15 - loop will continue as long as i don't
02:17 - type in quit
02:18 - and it will consistently ask me what
02:20 - food do i like and place
02:22 - that food item into a list named foods
02:25 - so let's begin what food do i like well
02:27 - i do like pizza
02:29 - i like sushi and i like ice cream
02:32 - and that should be enough for me i'm
02:34 - going to type in quit to exit this
02:36 - program
02:37 - now let's write the same program but
02:39 - instead use
02:40 - a walrus operator so that we can write
02:42 - this program using
02:43 - less lines of code now if i were to use
02:46 - the walrus operator this is how i would
02:48 - write the same program we would still
02:49 - need our list
02:50 - foods equals list
02:54 - now for my while loop it's going to look
02:55 - something like this
02:57 - while food walrus operator
03:02 - input what
03:04 - food do you like
03:08 - all right this is the assignment portion
03:11 - now we can use
03:12 - this assignment portion within a larger
03:15 - expression
03:16 - so let's also check to see if our input
03:19 - does not equal quit all right
03:22 - so then after each iteration of this
03:25 - while loop
03:26 - we will take our list foods dot
03:29 - append food and
03:32 - that is it so we have written the same
03:34 - program in about half the lines of code
03:37 - that we did previously
03:38 - so let's test it what food do you like
03:41 - pizza
03:42 - sushi ice cream and quit
03:47 - well everybody that is the basics of the
03:49 - walrus operator also known as an
03:51 - assignment expression
03:52 - it's a new feature for python 3.8 and
03:55 - beyond
03:56 - so if this doesn't work for you i would
03:57 - check to see what version of python
03:59 - you're using first
04:00 - it assigns values to variables as part
04:02 - of a larger expression
04:04 - if you would like a copy of this code i
04:06 - will post all of this in the comments
04:07 - section down below
04:09 - but yeah that is how the walrus operator
04:11 - works in python
