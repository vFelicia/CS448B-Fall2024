00:00 - hey again it's me today I'm going to be
00:02 - explaining the roll-up claws like a
00:04 - fruit roll-up it's an extension of the
00:07 - group by Clause it produces another row
00:10 - and shows the grand total it's also
00:12 - known as a super aggregate value here's
00:15 - an example I have a table of
00:17 - transactions what I would like to do is
00:19 - to group each transaction by the order
00:21 - date then produce a grant total here's
00:25 - what we'll do I'll give you a few
00:26 - different examples let's begin by
00:28 - selecting the sum of the amounts
00:33 - and the order date
00:35 - from our table
00:37 - transactions then we will Group by the
00:42 - order date
00:45 - and there we are we have the sum of
00:47 - every amount per order date using this
00:51 - roll-up Clause I can add an additional
00:53 - row that shows a grand total so to say
00:56 - all I have to do after the group by
00:59 - Clause is ADD with rollup
01:03 - and there you go here's the grand total
01:06 - 7.88 plus 8.37 plus 8.97 is
01:10 - 25.22 here's another example let's count
01:14 - the transaction ideas
01:19 - buy order date
01:23 - we have two transactions on the first
01:25 - two on the second three on the third
01:28 - for a total of seven transactions
01:31 - I'll give you two more examples
01:34 - let's select the count of our
01:38 - transaction ideas
01:39 - per customer
01:41 - I'm going to give this count an alias as
01:45 - number of orders
01:49 - as well as the customer ID column
01:53 - from our table
01:55 - transactions we will Group by customer
01:59 - ID let's see what we have so far
02:03 - then I will add with roll up
02:08 - here are the amount of orders per
02:10 - customer ID the customer with an ID of 3
02:13 - has visited here more than once the
02:15 - grand total of the number of orders is
02:17 - seven that's the roll up one last
02:20 - example let's select our employees table
02:23 - select all from employees
02:26 - we will group all of these employees by
02:29 - their employee ID then display a roll-up
02:32 - of all of the hourly pay as a business
02:35 - how much are we spending on all of our
02:37 - employees per hour
02:39 - so let's select the sum of our hourly
02:43 - pay
02:46 - I'll give this an alias as
02:50 - hourly pay I guess it really isn't
02:53 - different from the column name
02:56 - we will display the employee ID as a
02:59 - column
03:00 - from our table employees
03:03 - Group by the employee ID with rollup
03:12 - here's the hourly pay of each employee
03:15 - as well as a grand total if all of our
03:18 - employees are working currently we are
03:20 - spending as a business
03:22 - 92.75 cents per hour well yeah that's
03:26 - the roll-up Clause everybody it's an
03:28 - extension of the group by Clause it
03:30 - produces another row and shows
03:32 - essentially the grand total it's also
03:35 - known as a super aggregate value to
03:37 - include a roll-up after the group by
03:39 - Clause just add with rollup it's
03:42 - probably good for accounting and well
03:44 - yeah that's the roll-up clause in MySQL
