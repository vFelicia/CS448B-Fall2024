00:00 - all right let's do this thing today I
00:02 - got to talk about radio buttons in pi
00:04 - qt5 to work with radio buttons we will
00:06 - need the following imports from the
00:08 - module of QT widgets we will need the
00:12 - class of Q radio button as well as Q
00:17 - button group to group together different
00:21 - buttons let's create three radio buttons
00:24 - within the Constructor of my main window
00:27 - we will construct three radio buttons
00:29 - for the first radio button this will be
00:31 - named radio one we will call the
00:34 - Constructor of the class Q radio button
00:38 - then we can pass in some text what is
00:40 - the radio button going to say let's say
00:43 - that we're working with payment options
00:45 - let's say visa for the first option then
00:48 - for the second argument I will pass
00:50 - inself we will add this radio button
00:53 - directly to our window that would be
00:55 - self let's create two more additional
00:58 - radio buttons radio Radio 2 and radio 3
01:02 - the text of radio button two will be
01:05 - MasterCard and three will be a gift card
01:09 - we are selecting different payment
01:11 - options we need to set the geometry of
01:14 - these radio buttons because we're not
01:16 - using a layout
01:17 - manager I have a method to initialize my
01:20 - user interface this is where I will set
01:22 - the geometry of my radio buttons so
01:25 - let's say self. radio1 we will call the
01:29 - set set geometry method pass in some
01:32 - coordinates 0 0 is good that applies to
01:35 - the top left corner of my window for the
01:38 - width 300 and the height 50 is good
01:42 - let's do this with radio buttons 2 and
01:44 - three Radio 2 radio 3 we'll just move
01:48 - each radio button down on the Y AIS by
01:51 - 50 pixels each so 50 then
01:55 - 100 here are the three radio buttons
01:58 - however the font is kind of small we can
02:00 - barely see it so let's apply a
02:03 - stylesheet here's a trick that we can do
02:05 - with stylesheets we can apply multiple
02:08 - CSS like properties to an entire group
02:11 - of widgets rather than having to type
02:13 - them and apply them individually we will
02:16 - select our window of self set the
02:19 - stylesheet of our window with the set
02:22 - stylesheet
02:24 - method we will add a selector the
02:27 - selector is going to be the name of the
02:28 - widget
02:30 - Q radio button in this case then add a
02:32 - set of curly
02:36 - braces we can apply CSS like properties
02:39 - to an entire group of widgets this way
02:43 - so let's set the font size of all radio
02:46 - buttons to be 40
02:50 - pixels
02:52 - better let's set the font
02:54 - family to be
02:57 - aial then I will add a little bit of P
02:59 - padding around each radio
03:01 - button padding 10
03:06 - pixels that's pretty good so with radio
03:10 - buttons we can only select one from any
03:12 - one radio button group if I was making a
03:15 - payment I can't pay with a Visa and
03:18 - Mastercard at the same time I can only
03:20 - select one option that's the point of
03:23 - radio buttons we're limited to just one
03:25 - option with the default behavior of Pi
03:28 - qt5 all radio buttons unless explicitly
03:32 - stated are all part of the same group to
03:35 - demonstrate that let's create two
03:37 - additional radio buttons Radio 4 and
03:40 - Radio 5 radio button 4 will be for a
03:43 - payment method rather than a payment
03:45 - type for example we could say we're
03:47 - paying in
03:50 - store radio button 5 will be we're
03:53 - paying online radio buttons 1 through 3
03:56 - will be for the payment type radio
03:59 - buttons 4 5 will be for the payment
04:01 - method we're either paying in store or
04:03 - we're ordering something online we do
04:06 - need to set the geometry for these two
04:08 - radio buttons I'll just copy these two
04:11 - lines add Radio 4 Radio 5 we'll set the
04:15 - y-coordinate of four to be 150 and 5 to
04:20 - be 200 all radio buttons will be within
04:23 - the same button group if I was to select
04:25 - in store we deselect one of these
04:28 - options what I would like is one option
04:31 - from this first group and another option
04:33 - from this other group these buttons are
04:35 - all in the same group I can only select
04:38 - one if I would like to pay with the VISA
04:41 - in store and I click the in store radio
04:44 - button we unelect the radio button for
04:47 - Visa I would like these radio buttons
04:49 - within different groups we need to
04:52 - create two different groups and add them
04:54 - accordingly here's
04:57 - how within our Constructor we will act
04:59 - access self declare a button group let's
05:03 - name it button group one for
05:05 - Simplicity equals call The Constructor
05:09 - of the class Q button group then pass in
05:13 - to set the parent widget to be the
05:15 - window then we will create button group
05:21 - two we're going to access self select
05:24 - the radio button
05:26 - group button group one
05:30 - call the add button method then pass in
05:34 - a radio
05:35 - button self. Radio
05:38 - 1 then we'll add Radio 2 and radio
05:44 - 3 we'll select button group two this
05:47 - time button group
05:49 - two add radio button 4 and radio button
05:56 - 5 the first three radio buttons are
05:58 - within the same group radio buttons four
06:00 - and five are within a different group we
06:03 - can only select one radio button from
06:05 - any one radio button
06:07 - group maybe I would like to pay with a
06:09 - Visa card in store or a master card
06:13 - online or a gift card in store these
06:17 - radio buttons are within different
06:18 - button groups we're limited to one
06:21 - selection in any one radio button group
06:24 - when we select these radio buttons they
06:26 - don't quite do anything for each radio
06:28 - button we have to connect a signal to a
06:30 - slot here's
06:32 - how let's define a method of
06:36 - radio button changed there will be no
06:41 - parameters beside
06:43 - self temporarily I'll write pass we'll
06:46 - fill this in in a
06:48 - moment we will take each radio button
06:51 - let's start with radio one Radio One the
06:55 - signal will be toggled when this radio
06:58 - button is toggled we will connect a slot
07:02 - we will pass in a function or a method
07:06 - self do radio button
07:09 - changed then we will do this with the
07:11 - other radio
07:13 - buttons 1 through
07:18 - 5 let's print a test
07:21 - message you selected
07:24 - something just to be sure that
07:26 - everything is working
07:29 - you selected
07:31 - something okay we know that that works
07:36 - currently what we're going to need to do
07:38 - is get the sender widget which radio
07:41 - button sent the signal of
07:44 - toggled I will create a local radio
07:47 - button to store that radio button
07:51 - whichever one emitted the signal we can
07:53 - determine that with self. sender method
07:57 - the sender method is going to return the
07:59 - widget that sent the signal so if we
08:02 - select radio button one our radio button
08:05 - will be radio button one if it was five
08:08 - then it's five in this
08:10 - case then we'll determine if our radio
08:13 - button is checked take our radio button
08:17 - use the is checked method this will
08:20 - return a Boolean true or false if it's
08:24 - checked if this returns true then let's
08:27 - print the following all an F string we
08:31 - will get the text of the radio button
08:34 - radio button called the text method to
08:37 - return the text of the radio
08:39 - button is
08:42 - selected all right then let's see if
08:45 - this
08:46 - works let's select Visa Visa is selected
08:50 - MasterCard is selected gift card is
08:53 - selected in store is selected and online
08:56 - is
08:57 - selected that's how to to determine
09:00 - which radio button was selected which
09:02 - one is the sender which one sent the
09:05 - signal all right everybody so that is an
09:08 - introduction to radio buttons in pi qt5
