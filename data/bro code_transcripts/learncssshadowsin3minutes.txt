00:00 - hey everybody today I'm going to show
00:01 - you how we can create text shadows and
00:03 - box Shadows we'll need some sample text
00:06 - to work with I'll use an H1 element type
00:09 - in your name
00:11 - and we will need a div element
00:15 - we will eventually create a box I'll
00:17 - give this div an ID of box one good
00:22 - enough I would like to give this H1
00:24 - element a shadow I will select my H1
00:27 - element I will set the text Shadow
00:30 - property to be we need two numbers a
00:34 - horizontal offset and a vertical offset
00:37 - let's do one pixel and one pixel
00:40 - we have an offset to the right of one
00:42 - and down by one
00:44 - if I were to increase the horizontal
00:46 - offset let's change this to two
00:50 - while the shadow is moving more to the
00:51 - right let's try five
00:54 - ten
00:56 - fifty
00:58 - the first number is for the horizontal
01:00 - offset let's change that to three
01:04 - the second number is for the vertical
01:06 - offset if I change that to five well the
01:09 - text is going more downwards
01:12 - 50 would be this
01:15 - all right let's keep that at three
01:16 - though
01:18 - you could add a third number for a blur
01:22 - here's a one pixel blur
01:24 - two
01:26 - three
01:28 - four
01:30 - five if this is a really large number
01:32 - like 100 you can't even see the shadow
01:34 - anymore let's stick with five that's a
01:37 - decent amount you can even change the
01:39 - color too let's pick a red color
01:44 - oh that's good you can add more than one
01:47 - Shadow within the tech Shadow property
01:49 - for more than one Shadow effect each
01:52 - Shadow is comma separated so add a comma
01:54 - afterwards
01:55 - let's copy what we have paste it again
02:00 - I'm gonna give the second Shadow a
02:01 - negative offset so it's up and to the
02:04 - left
02:05 - I'll change the color so it's more
02:06 - distinct let's go with the blue color
02:09 - yeah I don't like that one
02:11 - yeah that's fine
02:13 - all right now let's cover box Shadows
02:15 - let's select our ID of box one
02:20 - I'll give this box a width of 100.
02:24 - and a height of 100.
02:27 - let's pick a color too
02:30 - background Dash color
02:34 - let's go with a whitish color so it's
02:37 - just barely visible
02:38 - something like that's fine
02:41 - for other elements besides text we have
02:43 - box shadow
02:45 - and really it's the same process as
02:48 - before we have a horizontal offset
02:51 - let's do three pixels
02:53 - a vertical offset let's do three pixels
02:55 - again
02:56 - a blur
02:57 - let's do five pixels
03:00 - and a color if we so choose but I'll
03:02 - keep that the same now our box has a 3D
03:05 - pop effect which is pretty sweet all
03:07 - right everybody so we have text Shadows
03:09 - for text and box Shadows for other
03:12 - elements and well everybody those are
03:14 - shadows in CSS
