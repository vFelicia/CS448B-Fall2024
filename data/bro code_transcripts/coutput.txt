00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:02 - bro hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to show you
00:04 - all a few different ways in which we can
00:06 - format
00:06 - output in c sharp so sit back relax and
00:09 - enjoy the show
00:12 - if you find this video helpful please
00:14 - remember to like comment
00:16 - and subscribe your support will help
00:18 - keep this channel running
00:20 - all right everybody here's a few
00:21 - different ways in which we can format
00:23 - output in c sharp as we covered in the
00:25 - last video to display something to our
00:26 - console window we would type
00:28 - console.writeline then you need a set of
00:31 - parentheses
00:31 - then a semicolon at the end you place
00:34 - your message within
00:35 - the parenthesis this is known as a
00:36 - method and we have a semicolon at the
00:39 - end
00:39 - the semicolon is kind of like the period
00:42 - at the end of a sentence
00:43 - when we finish a statement in
00:45 - programming we end it with a semicolon
00:47 - so to display a message within double
00:49 - quotes you would type something
00:51 - so this is known as a string literal
00:53 - we're literally printing something to
00:55 - our console
00:56 - so we kind of covered this in the last
00:57 - video this will display the word
00:59 - hello now there's another way in which
01:01 - we can display output
01:02 - that is just right console dot right
01:06 - parentheses semicolon and within quotes
01:08 - let's display something else
01:10 - what about hey now let's take a look at
01:13 - the difference between the two
01:15 - all right we have hey immediately
01:17 - followed by hello
01:18 - all in the same line in the last video
01:20 - we used two right line statements
01:22 - each string literal had their very own
01:25 - line but in this case
01:26 - it's all one line so with writeline
01:29 - after you finish your string literal
01:31 - it's going to hit enter like we're
01:32 - hitting the enter key and we'll move
01:34 - down to a new line
01:35 - right doesn't do that so you have two
01:37 - different ways in which you can display
01:38 - output to the console window
01:40 - right and right line write does not hit
01:42 - the enter key after the end
01:44 - it doesn't create a new line and right
01:46 - line does so you can use either one
01:47 - depending on what you need
01:48 - now there is a shortcut to create a
01:51 - writeline statement you type
01:52 - c then hit tab twice and that will auto
01:55 - generate a right light statement for you
01:58 - okay so the next topic to cover is
02:00 - comments we can add a comment to our
02:02 - code
02:02 - and this will not be displayed as output
02:05 - so to write a comment within your code
02:06 - you need
02:07 - two forward slashes and you can see that
02:09 - the color of our text changed to green
02:12 - so i'm going to tell you this is a
02:15 - comment
02:16 - and this has no effect on our output
02:18 - this comment will not be seen all we see
02:21 - here is hey and hello
02:23 - you can also write a multi-line comment
02:25 - you would type forward slash
02:27 - asterisk this is
02:30 - a multi-line
02:33 - comment then to end a multi-line comment
02:37 - you would end it with asterisk then
02:39 - forward slash again
02:40 - and last but not least we have escape
02:42 - sequences we can add an escape sequence
02:44 - to a string
02:45 - to format our output so let's create a
02:47 - writeline statement and type whatever
02:49 - your name is
02:51 - okay now to create an escape sequence we
02:54 - need to add a backslash
02:56 - followed by a certain character
02:58 - depending on what character you select
03:00 - it's going to have
03:00 - a special effect on your string so if i
03:03 - typed
03:04 - backslash t that will add a tab escape
03:07 - sequence before displaying my name
03:12 - all right so we have a tab before my
03:14 - string so let's change this to maybe
03:17 - a backspace i'll add that here so
03:20 - backslash b that will add a backspace
03:24 - and my name is now br
03:28 - code alright so we can also do new line
03:32 - backslash and for new line
03:36 - so my first name is on one line and my
03:38 - last name is on a second line
03:41 - now you may have noticed that there's
03:42 - all this garbage at the end of my
03:44 - console window when my program is done
03:45 - running
03:46 - so one way in which we can hide that at
03:48 - the end of our program type
03:50 - console.read key so basically this will
03:53 - prevent
03:54 - our program from ending until we type a
03:56 - key
03:58 - and it should be hidden now so if i hit
04:00 - the enter key well then my program is
04:02 - going to finish running
04:04 - all right everybody so those are a few
04:06 - ways in which we can format output in c
04:08 - sharp if you can give this video a
04:10 - thumbs up drop a random comment down
04:12 - below
04:12 - and well those are a few ways to format
04:15 - output in c sharp
