00:00 - hey everybody in this topic I'm going to
00:02 - explain the not null constraint the
00:05 - notch null constraint can be added to a
00:07 - column when you create a table whenever
00:10 - we enter a new row the value within that
00:12 - column can't be null for example I have
00:15 - table products we have a hamburger fries
00:17 - soda ice cream if I were to recreate
00:20 - this table I would type something like
00:22 - this
00:23 - create table
00:25 - products
00:29 - I would list the columns we have product
00:32 - ID the data type is integer
00:35 - product name the data type is varchar I
00:39 - believe I set this to be 25 last time
00:43 - then price
00:44 - that is a decimal
00:46 - we gave this column a Max size of four
00:49 - digits and a Precision of two any column
00:51 - that I do not want to have null values I
00:54 - will simply just add not no
00:56 - this is a constraint now I've already
00:59 - created this table so I'm not going to
01:01 - execute the statement but that's how you
01:03 - would create a table that has the notch
01:04 - null constraint after the column name
01:06 - you just type not null
01:09 - to add the not null constraint to a
01:11 - table that already exists you would
01:13 - instead type alter table the name of the
01:17 - table
01:18 - modify
01:21 - the name of the column
01:23 - the data type of the column
01:25 - in this case decimal
01:27 - four comma two
01:30 - then not null
01:33 - it's a little bit different than the
01:35 - unique constraint in the last topic so
01:38 - let's execute the statement
01:40 - that seemed to work
01:42 - let's add a new item to the menu I will
01:45 - select everything from my products table
01:47 - select from products
01:51 - let's add a new item to the menu and we
01:53 - will test that not null constraint
01:55 - insert into products
02:00 - values
02:02 - we have 104 product ID 104 will be
02:07 - how about a cookie
02:10 - I'm not going to set a price I will say
02:13 - null for the price maybe I'm not decided
02:15 - on what the price is yet after executing
02:18 - the statement well we have an error
02:21 - column price cannot be null
02:23 - since we said that not null constraint
02:25 - on the product price we can't enter a
02:28 - null value we could set this to be zero
02:33 - that's acceptable but it can't be null
02:35 - so yeah everybody that's the not null
02:38 - constraint it's a useful constraint to
02:40 - verify input if there's any column that
02:43 - you don't want to have any null values
02:44 - just add that constraint and yeah that
02:47 - is the not null constraint in MySQL
