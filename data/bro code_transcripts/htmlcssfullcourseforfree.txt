00:00 - hey it's you bro I hope you're doing
well and in this playlist I will be
00:03 - teaching you guys HTML and then later on
CSS so if you're looking for a career in
00:07 - web development or you're taking college
classes and learning hTML is required or
00:12 - perhaps you want to learn to build your
own website then look no further because
00:15 - you're in the right place let's get into
it
00:28 - what is HTML HTML is an acronym for
hypertext markup language it is a
00:33 - declarative language and not a
computational one such as Python PHP or
00:38 - JavaScript and there's many more besides
those examples HTML is a markup language
00:44 - and it's used to declare what should
exist on a web page your browser will
00:48 - take an HTML file read it and then
display it as a web page what are the
00:53 - advantages of using HTML it's easy to
learn it's easy to use and it's easy to
00:58 - write web developer jobs are high in
demand right now you'll want to learn
01:02 - CSS and JavaScript along with HTML
though the disadvantages of HTML HTML by
01:09 - itself is ugly there's no style that's
why you want to learn CSS after this
01:14 - it's also static in nature there's no
animations and that's why you want to
01:18 - learn JavaScript JavaScript will add
life and animations to HTML web sites
01:24 - HTML also exhibits unpredictable
behavior across certain web browsers
01:28 - because some tags and you'll learn about
tags later are supported on some
01:32 - browsers and not on others also along
with HTML there are little to no jobs if
01:38 - you only know HTML that's why I
emphasize learning CSS as well as
01:44 - JavaScript and possibly other
technologies after that - depending on
01:48 - what you're looking for so that's why
I'm bringing up the skill tree for
01:52 - beginning front-end developers you'll
want to start with HTML then learn CSS
01:57 - and then afterwards I would recommend
learning JavaScript each of these
02:01 - languages has a specialty and they work
well together think of building a
02:05 - website as being similar to constructing
a house
02:08 - so HTML acts as the foundation as the
skeletal framework of our house
02:13 - including walls doors roofing however we
would want to eventually decorate our
02:19 - house when we are done building it
that's when CSS comes in CSS would be us
02:25 - painting decorating and furnishing our
house
02:28 - lastly JavaScript adds dynamic life to
our webpages in our house analogy this
02:34 - would be similar to us adding
electricity gas lighting and plumbing it
02:38 - adds functionality to our website
and at some point in time I will have a
02:43 - complete playlist for each of these
languages so that's a great reason for
02:48 - you to subscribe so you can always stay
up to date just so you're aware there's
02:51 - many more technologies out there besides
these three however these will be enough
02:56 - to get you started but you should not
settle for just stopping at JavaScript I
03:00 - would continue on to learn more
technologies like angular nodejs PHP you
03:06 - should learn some back-end stuff if you
want to be a full-stack developer you
03:11 - shouldn't stop just here but this is
enough to at least get you to become a
03:15 - front-end developer so what do you need
to get started one you'll want to have a
03:19 - web browser I'm assuming you have one
since you're watching this video here's
03:23 - a list of a few I would recommend Google
Chrome or Firefox or Safari or Microsoft
03:29 - edge there's probably more out there but
please do not use internet explorer we
03:35 - will also want to download a text editor
as well a text editor is software that
03:40 - allows us to write HTML files and it has
some bonus features too instead of using
03:45 - dot txt or docx files we will be working
with HTML files your web browser will
03:51 - take that HTML file read it and display
it as a web page so I would recommend
03:56 - downloading a text editor so you can
write HTML files here's a few
03:59 - recommendations but not a complete list
there's sublime text atom visual studio
04:05 - and notepad plus plus there's still more
out there than just this list but here's
04:09 - just a few recommendations and you can
pick one from here if you have no
04:13 - preference I would recommend a sublime
text and I can show you how we can
04:17 - install that and set it up so feel free
to use whichever text editor you prefer
04:22 - if you have no preference here's the
link to sublime text just go to sublime
04:26 - text calm simple as that and we're going
to click this download button
04:30 - alternatively if you go to the download
tab there's other download options if
04:35 - you prefer let's just hit the stall mode
button and we are going to open this you
04:41 - can browse for a file location I'm going
to use the default location under
04:45 - Program Files click Next I guess I'll
add to Explorer context menu next
04:52 - install
and finish you may have to look to see
04:58 - where that file was downloaded to I just
so happen to do that and I created a
05:03 - shortcut for my desktop here so I'm just
going to open up this bad boy so here's
05:08 - the home screen for sublime text the
first thing we'll want to do is go to
05:12 - view then go to syntax and then change
this to HTML so to begin you can type
05:18 - some text on here and it will display on
your web page so I think I'll create a
05:22 - title for the top of my web page and
I'll say something such as welcome to my
05:28 - website and then I'm going to save this
file save as and you can choose a
05:36 - location to save this to I think I'll
save it to my desktop and I think I'll
05:42 - create a new folder you don't have to do
this but I like to keep everything
05:45 - organized and I'll call this HTML files
so make sure that your home page is
05:50 - named index and then make sure it's an
HTML file so we're going to save this
05:55 - here here's that file right-click it
then open with and pick a web browser to
06:03 - open this file with so let's open it
with Chrome and here is our website so
06:09 - this is zoomed in you can zoom in or out
one thing you might want to do for ease
06:13 - of use is to have your text editor
side-by-side with your web browser so
06:18 - you can easily make any changes to your
HTML file save it you can either go to
06:22 - file save or if you're using Windows you
can hit ctrl s to automatically save and
06:27 - then you can refresh your web browser
and that will change the web page based
06:31 - on the changes you've just made so do
you guys remember our analogy where we
06:35 - compared building a website as being
similar to building a house well before
06:39 - constructing any house we want to be
sure that we're building it on a solid
06:43 - foundation
we're going to add a few things to our
06:45 - HTML document so we can build a proper
website so what we're going to do is
06:50 - clear this out we'll save it and start
fresh in HTML we use a series of tags
06:56 - that describe how we want our website to
look and what content we want on it
07:01 - different tags have different effects on
our website what we're going to be doing
07:05 - here is creating a skeletal structure
of our website think of it as all the
07:09 - support beams of our house in our
previous example so at the very top of
07:13 - your file type a set of angle brackets
and within these we're going to type
07:19 - exclamation point then doc type all caps
and then HTML this defines the document
07:29 - as being of the current version which is
currently html5 it tells the web browser
07:34 - that this is an HTML document now on the
next line we need to create a set of
07:39 - HTML tags it's the same process as above
where you need a set of angle brackets
07:45 - and we're going to type HTML except we
also need another one
07:52 - alright so with tags they're usually in
pairs think of it as yin and yang there
07:55 - is an opening tag and there's a closing
tag and you define the closing tag by
07:56 - adding a forward slash before the tag
name so this is the beginning tag and
08:00 - this is the ending tag it lets the web
browser know where the effects of this
08:05 - tag should begin and where it should end
so we're going to be writing all of our
08:09 - code within these two HTML tags these
two tags are going to function as a
08:13 - container that's going to hold all of
our tags and text for our web page so if
08:19 - these are acting as a container we'll
probably want to have a little more room
08:22 - between these two tags the next set of
tags that we need is the head tags and
08:27 - you'll write this within the HTML tags
near the top so we're going to write
08:31 - head within a set of angle brackets and
then make sure there is a closing tag
08:37 - and then you'll want to be sure that
these are indented if they're within
08:40 - another set of tags just because it's
easier to read although eyes it still
08:44 - works the same but I find this easier to
read speaking of easier to read I'm
08:48 - going to zoom in a little bit alright I
would say that's better now this head
08:54 - element contains meta information about
this document it describes information
08:59 - about this document to the web browser
think of it like the settings for this
09:03 - document and if we have a head element
we're also going to want a body element
09:08 - so we're going to put that within the
HTML tags but after the
09:13 - head takes here so we're going to write
it here so we need an opening tag and
09:17 - then a closing tag within these body
tags this is where all of our content is
09:23 - going to go so anything that you want to
add to your webpage you'll want to put
09:28 - within the body tag so it can be
displayed well this is the skeletal
09:32 - structure of our website it is the
minimum requirements to build a solid
09:37 - foundation for our website you'll want
this doctype HTML at the very top to let
09:42 - the web browser know that this is an
HTML document you'll want a set of HTML
09:47 - tags to let the web browser know that
the HTML code starts here and ends here
09:53 - the head tags contain information about
what this document is about there's
09:57 - another term for this and it's called
metadata and you would put it within the
10:00 - head tags and the body tags contain all
of the content for our web page before
10:06 - when we added text display to the web
page we'd put it right at the top but
10:10 - now we'll want to put it within these
body tags so I'll add that back I think
10:15 - it was something such as welcome to my
website let's save this and then refresh
10:21 - the page and here's the text and we can
also add a title to this web page you
10:26 - can see it on the tab here it currently
says index.html and we can change that
10:31 - within the head tags so let's put that
here but we need a set of title tags so
10:37 - we need a opening title tag and a
closing title tag I think I'll name this
10:42 - duh best website save it and then we can
refresh the page and you can see it no
10:48 - longer says index.html it says duh best
web site well those are the very basics
10:54 - of HTML in the next video we will be
discussing some basic concepts of the
10:59 - head tags as well as some basic tags for
the body but yeah that is everything you
11:04 - need to know to get started in HTML hey
you
11:21 - if
