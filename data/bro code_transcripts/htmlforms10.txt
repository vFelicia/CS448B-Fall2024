00:00 - it's your bro here hope you're doing
well and in this video I'm gonna teach
00:03 - you how to create a form using HTML
let's get into it
00:08 - the form ailment is used to collect user
input from a visitor to your site this
00:13 - can be anything from personal
information to surveys
00:16 - payment info etc there are different
form input elements such as text fields
00:21 - radio buttons drop-down lists checkboxes
and there's even a form element for a
00:26 - submit button just like we covered in
the last video so let's get started the
00:30 - first thing that we're going to do is
use a pair of form tags so we need an
00:35 - opening form tag and a closing form tag
usually on an HTML form there's an
00:40 - action attribute that you may find
within the opening form tag and this
00:44 - defines the action to be performed when
the form is submitted the data from the
00:49 - form may be sent to a page on the server
when the user clicks on some sort of
00:53 - submit button there might be a PHP file
or some other script within the action
00:58 - attribute that the form sends data to it
might be a file such as du underscore
01:04 - something dot PHP or it might be named
something like action page something
01:11 - around there but I like do something dot
PHP so we won't be doing much with the
01:16 - action attribute in this lesson but we
might cover it in a different tutorial
01:20 - okay let's create a textbox for somebody
to enter in their first name let's
01:26 - create a prompt or a label that says
first name and let's see what this looks
01:32 - like alright so then what I'm going to
do then is that we're going to use the
01:38 - input tag and this is a self closing tag
and we're going to use the type
01:42 - attribute and set this to text so this
will place a text box when we use the
01:49 - typed text attribute and set this to
text now there's one trick and it's
01:53 - called using a label so sometimes people
might have difficulty with clicking on
01:59 - the text box so one thing that we can do
is that with our label well text that is
02:05 - functioning as a label there's actually
a label tag that has some benefits so
02:10 - what we're going to do is take our first
name and surround this with a pair of
02:15 - label tags and I'll show you what this
does in just a moment alright
02:21 - then what we're going to do is in the
opening label tag we're going to type
02:25 - before
equals and then we need to come up with
02:28 - an ID for our input and we can say
something such as first underscore name
02:36 - now we'll want to create an ID for this
textbox and we'll have it match whatever
02:43 - we placed for the four attribute so
first underscore name so this label and
02:50 - this textbox are now linked but you have
to make sure that these have the same
02:55 - name so this ID has to match whatever
the four label has and an added benefit
03:01 - of this is that if we click on first
name it's going to place our cursor
03:06 - within the textbox so that's kind of a
nice feature to the ID attribute is the
03:12 - client-side identifier mostly used for
CSS and JavaScript to uniquely identify
03:17 - this specific element and there's also
another attribute called name so let's
03:23 - create that here and with the name a
common practice is to set the ID and the
03:30 - name to be the same so I'm going to type
in first underscore name so the name
03:35 - attribute is used during form submission
to post or get the values that we submit
03:41 - when we hit some sort of submit button
so this is only used when we're using a
03:46 - server-side language such as PHP or a
few other languages out there while the
03:51 - ID and the name attributes really aren't
required for this tutorial it would be
03:56 - good practice just to become familiar
with them as you advance your skills
03:59 - then you know what these things are then
well now we have a text box where we can
04:04 - enter in our first name so let's do the
same thing for a last name and honestly
04:08 - I'm just going to add a few line breaks
and then we can copy and paste this and
04:13 - we can change a few things so we're
going to change any instance of first
04:18 - name to last name so last name last name
and we'll changed ad two last name and
04:28 - the name to last name let's save reload
and we now have a box for a last name
04:35 - now with these text boxes we can add a
placeholder if we want to let the user
04:39 - know what kind of format that we want
them to enter their user input in so for
04:45 - example let's use the placeholder
attribute and we can set this equal to
04:49 - some default value and the text that's
going to appear within the text box is
04:53 - going to be like gray and faded so let's
come up with a first name I like the
04:59 - name spongebob and then let's do the
same thing for the last name input box
05:05 - and I will pick a last name of
SquarePants but you don't have to pick
05:10 - the same thing I do you could always
pick like John Smith or something I just
05:15 - want this be entertaining alright so
then within the text box it says
05:19 - Spongebob Squarepants it's like some
sample text and if we were to click on
05:24 - this text box and enter something in
this would actually disappear until we
05:29 - clear out the text box then it goes back
to our sample text so this is useful if
05:33 - you want to let the user know what kind
of format that we want them to enter
05:38 - their information and so it's useful for
like phone numbers or email addresses
05:42 - stuff like that let's create a few
buttons doesn't that sound good but I'll
05:47 - add a few line breaks so there's another
option to create buttons on a form and
05:51 - that's by setting the type attribute of
the input element to either reset if you
05:57 - want a reset button or submit if you
want a submit button so let's create an
06:02 - input element and we're going to use the
type attribute and set this to reset
06:07 - let's save reload we now have a reset
button so let's type in some text so
06:13 - I'll make up a first name and a last
name so if we were to hit this reset
06:18 - button it's actually going to clear out
this form for us which is pretty sweet
06:21 - let's do the same thing and create a
submit button so I'll add a few line
06:26 - breaks we'll use the input element and
we'll set the type equal to submit let's
06:33 - save
reload we now have a submit button so
06:37 - with the submit button if we were to
click on this this HTML file is going to
06:41 - send the information from this form to
whatever page is listed
06:47 - than the action attribute of your
opening form element so you might have
06:52 - some sort of file here like do something
dot PHP or some other action page so
06:59 - let's refresh this and actually attempt
to send some information and see what
07:03 - happens so I'm just going to send a
first name and a last name and hit
07:06 - submit so this is going to attempt to
send this information to this page on
07:13 - the server but we don't currently have
anything set up though but that's how
07:17 - you would actually submit information
from a form so that's the basics of
07:22 - forms if you want to continue I'll show
you a few other different input methods
07:26 - for forms and I've already went ahead
and made a few labels for stuff that
07:30 - might be related to form submissions
such as like a title payment type email
07:35 - birthdays phone numbers passwords stuff
like that so if you're interested let's
07:41 - begin I'll include timestamps in the
description if there's anything or any
07:45 - type of input that you'd be interested
in let's begin by creating some radio
07:49 - buttons for a title and by title I mean
like mr. mrs. doctor titles like that so
07:57 - let's create a few labels to begin so
label four equals and then perhaps the
08:03 - first one will be mr. then let's add
some text to the screen so we'll just
08:08 - put the text mr on here and then close
this label and we'll copy this and paste
08:13 - it a few times perhaps four and we'll
make the second label for mrs. the third
08:20 - one for miss and then we got to change
the text to and PhD and we can probably
08:29 - stop there even though there's many more
titles PhD let's save this reload all
08:37 - right so we want to add a radio button
after each of these options so we're
08:42 - going to be adding an input element
after each of these specific labels so
08:47 - let's begin with mr. so we're going to
set the type equal to radio for radio
08:54 - button we're going to set the value
equal to missed
08:59 - and then we want to set the ID equal to
whatever we have within the four
09:05 - attributes so it matches so mr. as well
so there's one other attribute that we
09:11 - want to add and it's that name attribute
but first I want to show you what
09:15 - happens if we don't have the name
attribute setup so we're going to be
09:19 - adding that in in just a moment so what
I'm going to do is copy this and paste
09:23 - it underneath each of these specific
labels and we'll make a few changes so
09:27 - we have the mr. radio button setup so
let's do the same thing for mrs. we're
09:34 - just going to be editing some of these
fields we need miss and PhD okay let's
09:49 - save this reload the page and we now
have a radio button after each of these
09:53 - titles but take a look to see what
happens if we select more than one we
09:58 - can actually select all of these and
with radio buttons for each group you
10:02 - only want to be able to select one of
these selecting one will deactivate any
10:06 - others so we need to add a name
attribute and each group of Rayo buttons
10:11 - needs to have the same name so I will
give this name perhaps title so I'll
10:18 - copy this and paste this name attribute
into each of these input elements so
10:23 - they each have the same name so they're
all within the same group so let's save
10:28 - this reload and when we select a radio
button it actually D selects any others
10:33 - that are selected so we can only select
one then let's move on to drop-down
10:37 - menus and this would be perfect for some
sort of payment where we can click a
10:42 - drop down menu and select a payment type
so I already created a payment label so
10:47 - the first thing we're going to do is use
the Select tag and we're going to set
10:52 - the ID equal to perhaps payment and then
we need to set some options but we also
11:00 - need a closing select tag and all the
different items within the drop down
11:05 - menu are going to be within these pair
of select tags and we have to add
11:10 - options so we're going to have
opening option tag and a closing option
11:15 - tag for each of these available options
so for the first value we'll use the
11:21 - value attribute and set this perhaps to
visa like you can pay with the Visa
11:25 - credit card and let's add some text so
we'll just say visa so let's save this
11:31 - reload the page and we now have a drop
down menu but it only has one option so
11:35 - we want to add a few while there's so
I'm going to copy this paste it a few
11:39 - times and change a few things for is a
good amount perhaps the second value can
11:45 - be a MasterCard and will change the text
as well and then for the third option
11:53 - perhaps a gift card so make sure to
change it within the value attribute and
11:59 - the text as well gift card
and lastly perhaps a check so change the
12:08 - value and the text let's save reload and
we now have a drop-down menu with a few
12:15 - options and we can select one of these
for our payment let's create an email
12:20 - field so we're going to use the input
element and we're going to set the type
12:26 - equal to email the ID equal to email and
B name equal to email let's save reload
12:38 - the page and we now have a field where
we can enter in our email we can also
12:42 - place a placeholder as well so we'll use
the placeholder attribute and set this
12:47 - equal to some default text that will
display within here so for our default
12:52 - text our placeholder for our first name
and last name it was Sponge Bob
12:55 - Squarepants
so perhaps I'll make a false or fake
12:59 - email address based off of that so s
Square Pants @ uses Gmail Gmail com
13:08 - let's say reload the page now somebody
can enter in their email if we attempted
13:13 - to write in an email that didn't contain
the @ sign this would actually yell at
13:19 - us then so I'll just type in the word
fake calm and we'll attempt to submit
13:24 - this and we have this little warning
message
13:26 - that says please include an @ sign in
the email address so let's actually add
13:31 - that the @ sign and I'll just make up a
fake email so fake @ gmail.com and then
13:38 - only then can we actually submit this
form to have some sort of server page
13:42 - process this information so that's an
way of error checking if you have an
13:47 - email field setup it will actually
prompt the user to enter in a valid
13:53 - email that has that @ sign which is
pretty cool let's cover the date input
13:57 - type and this would work perfect for a
birthday or birth date so after our
14:02 - label for a birthday we're going to use
the input element and set the type equal
14:09 - to date the ID equal to birthday and the
name also equal to birthday let's save
14:19 - reload the page and we now have this
input element for like a year month and
14:25 - day there's also a drop-down menu too if
you want to select something as well and
14:30 - you can also add a minimum or maximum
value to the dates you can select for
14:37 - example let's say that we want to limit
the latest date that we can select so
14:43 - we'll use the min attribute and set this
equal to
14:46 - perhaps January 1st 2000 so 2000 0 1 - 0
1 so let's save this reload and we can
14:56 - only go so far back now all the way to
the year 2000 so that's the latest date
15:03 - so you can keep that in or take it out
if you want but you have options based
15:07 - on what you want to do with the number
type this would be perfect if you're
15:11 - setting up some sort of online shop and
you need to select a quantity like how
15:15 - many of something do you want to buy how
many t-shirts you want to buy so we can
15:20 - set a quantity so we'll use the input
element set the type equal to number and
15:26 - we want our ID to match our for
attribute so quantity and we'll need to
15:35 - set a name and we'll set this equal to
quantity let's save real low
15:40 - and we now have an input box for an
amount but there's really no limit on
15:45 - here like we can buy like these many of
something and a user could also buy a
15:50 - negative amount of something like for
example they could buy negative ten
15:54 - t-shirts and you'd probably end up
giving the money or something so you'd
15:58 - probably want to limit the quantity so
in order to do that within the input
16:03 - ailment we're going to use the min
attribute and set this equal to perhaps
16:09 - zero like they want to buy zero at the
for the minimum amount and maybe max we
16:16 - can set this equal to maybe 99 so let's
say real of the page and we cannot go
16:22 - below zero nor can we type in a number
bigger than 99 and successfully submit
16:28 - it it says value must be less than or
equal to 99 so if we were to type in 99
16:33 - which is actually the max that's
submitted this would work then you can
16:37 - also set a default quantity like for
example use the value attribute and set
16:42 - this equal to one so by default you're
going to have a quantity of 1 in case
16:47 - somebody's like checking out something
in an online shop they'll end up buying
16:51 - at least one item but they can increase
this if they want telephone numbers will
16:57 - use the input element and we're going to
set the type equal to te l which is
17:03 - short for telephone we'll set the ID
equal to phone and the name equal to
17:10 - phone as well let's save reload and we
can now import a phone number let's
17:15 - create a password field so we'll type
this in after the password label input
17:22 - type equals password B ID equal to pass
I guess passport works I already wrote
17:31 - past and I don't feel like changing it
now and name also will be passed let's
17:36 - save this reload and we now have a
password field all the text that we add
17:41 - within here is bulleted but there's
really no limit to the amount of
17:45 - characters we can add to this password
so we can actually limit this so let's
17:50 - say that we want the max length of the
password to be perhaps 12
17:53 - characters first let's just add a note
after that that lets the user know that
17:58 - max is 12 characters so max 12
characters all right
18:04 - within the input element of our password
field we're going to use the max length
18:09 - attribute and let's set this equal to 12
let's save reload and let's attempt to
18:15 - type in more than 12 characters so 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 and that's our
18:22 - limit so we can't type it anymore so
that's a good way to limit user input
18:26 - for a password field hang on because
we're almost finished we are on the
18:32 - range input data type so this works like
a slider think of like the star system
18:38 - when you rate somebody it's like on a
scale this one isn't as pretty though
18:43 - you can do some designing with CSS and
whatnot but we're going to use the input
18:49 - element and set the type equal to range
and let's see what this appears like
18:54 - alright so we have this sliding scale
here but let's say that we want to add
18:59 - some numbers to this like maybe a number
before this and after this so we're
19:04 - going to add some text right next to
this input type let's pretend that we
19:09 - want to rate somebody's service between
1 and 5 stars
19:13 - so before and after this slider scale
we're going to add one before this range
19:21 - and then 5 after this so let's save
reload and we now have a slider bar
19:26 - between a certain range however there's
perhaps 100 different positions that
19:30 - this slider can be in so let's say that
we want to limit that we can actually
19:36 - set up some steps so we'll use the step
attribute and we can set this to some
19:41 - value that is preferably divisible by
100 let's say that we want 5 different
19:47 - steps
well we'll actually put 25 here and this
19:51 - is the reason why so each notch or step
in this slider bar will actually count
19:57 - as 25 but we always count 0 as well so
if we set the step equal to 25
20:03 - physicians will end up with 5 different
stars 5 different position
20:07 - so let's just count this to test it out
so we have one two three four five just
20:14 - like we intended however if you made
this twenty we would actually end up
20:18 - with six different positions then so one
two three four five six even though one
20:23 - hundred different positions divided by
20 is still five we always count zero
20:28 - though with that and with this range
input type you can also set a default
20:32 - value so let's set the value equal to
100 so when we reload the page our
20:39 - rating is already at five stars and we
can lower this otherwise we can change
20:44 - this to a different number like 50 and
it would end up being right in the
20:48 - middle so you can also place a default
value for your sliding scale as well
20:53 - checkboxes are very simple and a perfect
example of us using a check box would be
20:58 - for some sort of subscribe button so
under my subscribe label we're going to
21:03 - use the input element again and set the
type equal to check box then the ID
21:14 - equal to subscribe because that's what I
decided the four attributes gonna be
21:20 - four and the name also set to sub
described alright
21:26 - let's save reload and we now have a
check box next to our subscribe label
21:31 - that we can check on or off okay I
promise this is the last one
21:35 - we can use the file input type to upload
a file to a server page so I have the
21:43 - upload a file label and we're going to
use the input element and set the type
21:49 - equal to file and the ID equal to my
file because I already wrote that and
21:58 - the name also equal to my file
let's save reload okay so we can now
22:06 - click this button to upload a file and
let's click this button choose file to
22:11 - upload a file okay well here's a folder
where I'm keeping some related HTML
22:18 - files let's say that we want to upload
this test excel file so we'll click open
22:25 - and this file is now uploaded now if you
want to limit the types the file
22:32 - extensions of what files you can upload
you can actually use the accept
22:37 - attribute so we'll say accept and then
we'll place perhaps dot txt like we only
22:44 - want to upload plain text files so let's
try this one more time then so let's say
22:50 - reload the page and I'm going to choose
a file again within the same folder and
22:56 - here we only have that test file now the
plain text file so before you can see
23:02 - that HTML file and that excel file but
now we can only upload the file type
23:08 - that we specified which was plain text
so then we can just upload that and then
23:13 - you know we can submit this then but
yeah that is pretty much all the basics
23:18 - for using forms in HTML I'll post all
the code that I have in the comments
23:23 - down below but yeah those are the basics
of forms in HTML hey you if you enjoyed
23:30 - this lesson then you can help me help
