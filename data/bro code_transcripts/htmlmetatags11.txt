00:00 - hey it's you bro I hope you're doing
well and in this video we're going to be
00:03 - discussing meta tags and HTML let's get
into it
00:08 - meta tags are used for metadata which is
information about data think of it as
00:14 - data about data that's why it's called
meta data we place meta tags within the
00:20 - head of our HTML document so if you're
following along make sure you place
00:24 - these meta tags within the head of your
document and not the body so meta data
00:30 - has some uses for search engines and web
browsers and a few other benefits
00:34 - metadata lets these entities and your
web browser know what your web page is
00:39 - about and what kind of content
it contains there's other uses of meta
00:43 - tags too that allow us to control the
viewport which is the visible area of a
00:48 - web page when you switch devices such as
if you're viewing a page on a mobile
00:52 - device or a tablet meta tags will give
the browser instructions on the
00:57 - dimensions of your page when it's
displayed on a mobile device or if it's
01:02 - displayed on a laptop or a desktop so
let's cover a few of the basic meta tags
01:07 - and we're going to be placing these
within the head of our document we're
01:10 - going to type in a set of angle brackets
and we're just going to type in meta
01:14 - with an angle brackets and this is a
self closing tag so you don't need a
01:18 - closing tag after this the first thing
that we're going to cover is an
01:22 - attribute called charge set so we're
going to set char set equal to something
01:28 - and what this char set does is that this
will let the web browser know which
01:32 - character set we are using these would
be character sets such as ASCII ANSI and
01:38 - Unicode if we would like to use Unicode
which covers most characters and symbols
01:43 - that exist in pretty much every written
language we can use the charset
01:48 - attribute and set this to Unicode which
is utf-8 and this covers things such as
01:54 - kanji characters different symbols
pretty much you can't go wrong even if
02:00 - you have like a document in plain
English you can't go wrong with just
02:04 - throwing in a meta tag that has char
sets at Unicode let's move on from
02:09 - character sets and make another meta tag
another meta tag attribute is the name
02:15 - attribute and if we set name to keywords
we can define some keywords about
02:22 - web page for search engines like Google
or Bing to identify so let's set some
02:28 - keywords
we'll use the content attribute so we'll
02:31 - say content and then let's just describe
what our webpage is about using a few
02:37 - words so if this for example the video
you're watching right now is an HTML
02:42 - tutorial on the YouTube page called bro
code perhaps we'll put some keywords in
02:48 - here such as HTML we can separate these
with a comma maybe a tutorial bro code
02:56 - then maybe YouTube I guess that works so
these are like keyword search terms
03:03 - think of it like that and depending on
what you place in here that might help
03:07 - with your rankings for search engines
but they basically describe what your
03:13 - web page is about in just a few words
let's create another meta tag and this
03:17 - is going to be similar to what we had
previously we're going to use the name
03:21 - attribute but this time we're going to
set this to description alright and then
03:28 - we will use the content attribute and
now we can add a full description about
03:33 - this web page and you can type in
perhaps like a whole sentence so for my
03:38 - example I'll type in bro code HTML
tutorial for beginners that should be
03:48 - good enough so you can give a
description about your webpage too and
03:51 - search engines can actually pick up this
stuff and learn what your webpage is
03:55 - about then let's create another meta tag
and this time we're going to use the
04:00 - name attribute but this time we're going
to set this to off there so we can list
04:06 - an author for this webpage so we'll use
the content attribute for this and I'll
04:12 - just make up a name so bro then I'll
make up a last name washing tin so you
04:18 - can set an author for this webpage it's
a fairly simple meta tag and a fairly
04:23 - simple attribute this next one is going
to be a little complex we can set the
04:28 - viewport which is the visible area of a
web page depending on which device is
04:33 - being used to view the page if you're
using a mobile
04:36 - device such as a tablet or a phone you
want to be sure that the dimensions will
04:40 - fit on your device so that the
dimensions and the scaling will adjust
04:44 - to accommodate that specific device so
follow me this is what we're going to
04:49 - type so within a meta tag we're going to
set the name equal to view port all
04:56 - right then we'll use the content
attribute and then within here this is
05:01 - what we're going to type with equals
device
05:05 - - wit comma initial - scale equals 1 or
1.0 all right so what this does is that
05:18 - these are instructions for the web
browser to change the scaling and
05:24 - dimensions to appear to match the device
you are using to view that webpage and
05:29 - the initial scale is set to 1 or 1.0
that will set the zoom level when the
05:36 - page is first loaded so if you would
like your web page to be more easily
05:40 - readable on mobile devices you'll want
to be sure to include this meta tag all
05:45 - right I have one more for you guys you
can also set a meta tag that will
05:50 - refresh your web page automatically
after so many seconds this is what we're
05:54 - going to do to do that we'll use a meta
tag and within here we're going to type
06:00 - HTTP - e q u hi V alright and we're
going to set this equal to refresh next
06:14 - we're going to set the content equal to
how many seconds that we want our web
06:20 - page to refresh I'm going to pick
something ridiculous like three like I
06:24 - want this web page to refresh every
three seconds I wouldn't normally
06:28 - recommend this but it's going to work
for our demonstration so I'm going to
06:32 - save this and reload the page but you
know we're not seeing anything currently
06:35 - you might see like a blip every once in
a while so I'm just going to start
06:38 - adding some text here maybe some
headings just to prove that this is
06:42 - refreshing
so perhaps I'll just write tests and
06:45 - I'll put this within a h1 tag and I'll
save this you can see that it just
06:49 - popped
I don't even have to refresh the page
06:51 - and I'm just copying and pasting this
and saving it and you know it's
06:56 - refreshing every three seconds or so
so yeah that's what you can do to have a
07:02 - webpage refresh you just use this
attribute set it to refresh and then set
07:07 - the amount of seconds that you want this
webpage to refresh after these many
07:11 - seconds please do not put three here
pick a higher number because that's
07:17 - going to be really annoying if your web
page refreshes every three seconds but
07:21 - it works just for this demonstration so
that's the basics of metadata it's
07:25 - information about data there's still way
more meta tag attributes that are out
07:30 - there but these are a few of the basics
just enough to get you started and that
07:34 - is how meta tags work in HTML hey you if
you enjoyed this lesson then you can
