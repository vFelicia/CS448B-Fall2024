00:02 - hey welcome back everybody
00:03 - here's a super quick video on augmented
00:06 - assignment operators
00:07 - they're used to replace a statement
00:09 - where an operator takes a variable as
00:11 - one of its arguments
00:12 - and then assigns the result back to the
00:14 - same variable now what the heck does
00:15 - that mean
00:16 - okay so let's say that we need to
00:18 - increment the value of x by one without
00:21 - using an increment operator we could say
00:23 - x equals x plus one so writing this out
00:26 - can be somewhat redundant there is a
00:28 - shortcut by using
00:29 - an augmented assignment operator
00:31 - whatever variable you would like to
00:32 - perform an operation on
00:34 - you will list that variable use an
00:36 - arithmetic operator
00:37 - equals and then some value so writing
00:39 - this would increment
00:41 - x by one so let's go over a few examples
00:43 - we have into x
00:44 - equals 10. so i could write x equals x
00:48 - plus 2 to increment x by 2 right or i
00:51 - could say
00:51 - as a shortcut x plus equals 2 and that
00:55 - will do the same thing
00:56 - and that's 12. now let's try minus x
00:59 - equals x
01:00 - minus 3 using the augmented assignment
01:02 - operator
01:03 - that would be x minus equals 3
01:06 - which is 7. what about x equals x times
01:09 - 4
01:10 - well that would be x times equals four
01:13 - x times four is forty and division
01:18 - x equals x divided by five the augmented
01:21 - assignment operator of this equation
01:24 - is x divided by equals five
01:27 - which is two and lastly modulus so what
01:31 - about
01:31 - x equals x modulus two
01:34 - that would be x modulus equals two
01:38 - x modulus 2 equals 0. well yeah
01:41 - everybody those are
01:42 - augmented assignment operators they're
01:44 - basically a shortcut
01:46 - they're used to replace a statement
01:47 - where an operator takes a variable as
01:49 - one of its arguments
01:51 - and then assigns the result back to the
01:52 - same variable it's a shortcut
