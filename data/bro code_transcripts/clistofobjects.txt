00:02 - all right what's going on everybody so
00:03 - in this video i'm going to show you all
00:05 - how we can create a list of objects from
00:07 - a custom class of ours
00:08 - in the last video i showed you all how
00:10 - we can create a list of strings
00:12 - but what if we would like to create a
00:13 - list of players to keep track of the
00:15 - amount of players in our game and their
00:17 - names
00:17 - so let's create a list list then we need
00:20 - angle brackets and
00:22 - the data type of the object we would
00:23 - like to store within our list
00:25 - i would like to store player objects and
00:27 - i'll name
00:28 - this list players because we're keeping
00:30 - track of the players
00:32 - players equals new list
00:36 - angle brackets our data type again
00:38 - player
00:39 - parentheses semicolon so we now have a
00:42 - list that can store player
00:44 - objects so let's instantiate some player
00:46 - objects
00:47 - and i have a field setup username you
00:49 - can also set up getters and setters too
00:51 - if you prefer
00:52 - so let's create some player objects
00:54 - player and we'll call this player player
00:56 - one
00:56 - equals new player but we need to pass in
00:59 - a username as an argument let's say that
01:02 - this is chad
01:03 - and i'll create maybe two more players
01:07 - so player 1 player 2 player 3. player 2
01:10 - will be
01:11 - what about steve and karen
01:15 - okay now to add our player objects to
01:17 - our list
01:18 - type the name of the list dot add
01:22 - and then pass in the name of the object
01:24 - players dot add player one
01:26 - then do the same thing with player two
01:28 - and player three
01:30 - then i'll use a for each loop to display
01:33 - all these four each
01:36 - the data type is player player
01:40 - in players so let's take a look at this
01:44 - i'm going to
01:45 - console.writeline each player
01:48 - but since we're displaying each object
01:50 - directly
01:51 - what's going to be displayed is the
01:53 - namespace
01:54 - plus the data type of our object we can
01:57 - access
01:57 - the username field
02:01 - and that will display each player's
02:02 - username or we can overwrite
02:05 - the tostring method so we have chad
02:08 - steve and kieran
02:09 - or we can override the tostring method
02:13 - so let's try that too public
02:16 - override to string
02:20 - and i'm going to return
02:23 - username so then when i use
02:26 - console.writeline i can just type in the
02:29 - object's name
02:33 - so we have chad steven karen now another
02:35 - thing that you can do
02:36 - when we instantiate these player objects
02:39 - we can do so anonymously
02:41 - so within the add method of our list
02:44 - players
02:45 - we can simply just pass in new
02:48 - player then pass in a name and then we
02:50 - don't necessarily need to create a
02:52 - name for each of these objects so i'm
02:54 - going to pass in
02:55 - new player steve and new player karen
03:00 - so this is optional but i like to create
03:02 - anonymous objects
03:04 - it's less work so we should have our
03:06 - three players
03:07 - chad steve and karen so yeah that's how
03:10 - to add objects to a list
03:12 - within the angle brackets you just list
03:14 - the type of object that you would like
03:16 - to store within your list
03:17 - so yeah that's a list of objects in c
