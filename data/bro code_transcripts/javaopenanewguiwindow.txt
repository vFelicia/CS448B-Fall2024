00:00 - hey how's it going everybody it's your
00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well and in
00:03 - this video I'm going to teach you guys
00:05 - how we can open a new window using Java
00:07 - swing so let's get into it before you
00:12 - reach the end of this video make sure to
00:14 - LIKE comment and subscribe so that we
00:17 - together can challenge and defeat the
00:19 - mighty YouTube algorithm alright
00:23 - everyone so we're going to create a new
00:24 - project so if you're using Eclipse go to
00:27 - file new Java project and I'll call this
00:30 - project how to open a new window I know
00:36 - I'm really creative like that and then
00:38 - click finish and we're not going to
00:40 - create a module for this now we're going
00:43 - to go to our project locate the source
00:45 - folder and we're going to create three
00:47 - files so file new class I'll call the
00:51 - first one main and it's going to hold
00:53 - our main method so you'll want to be
00:55 - sure to click this checkbox here click
00:58 - finish let's go back to our source
01:00 - folder file new class and let's call
01:04 - this second file launch page it's going
01:08 - to launch a new window when we click on
01:10 - a button and then click finish and then
01:13 - back to the source folder file new oops
01:17 - file new class and we'll call this new
01:21 - window this is the window we're trying
01:22 - to open so new window and then click
01:27 - finish all right now within your main
01:31 - class this is what we're going to type
01:33 - we're going to create an instance of our
01:35 - launch page so we're going to type in
01:37 - the name of the class launch page and
01:40 - we'll call this launch page with a
01:42 - lowercase L equals new launch page and
01:48 - that's it for our main method in fact
01:52 - our entire main class here so we're
01:55 - going to do some things on our launch
01:57 - page here so the first thing that we're
02:00 - going to want to do is to create our
02:02 - constructor we'll call this
02:04 - launch page so it matches the class name
02:06 - and then we're going to declare two
02:10 - objects within our class but before the
02:13 - construct
02:14 - a jframe frame equals new J frame and
02:21 - I'm thinking what we can do or this
02:23 - project is that this page will only
02:26 - contain a button and when we click on
02:28 - the button it'll bring us to a new page
02:30 - so we'll do something simple like that
02:32 - then I'm just going to import these
02:34 - things so Java X dot swing and then
02:37 - let's create a J button to put on this
02:39 - frame so J button and we'll call this my
02:43 - button equals new J button and we can
02:47 - set some text on this button right away
02:49 - we'll just type in new window and then
02:55 - we'll need to import this okay let's go
02:59 - to our constructor and add a few things
03:01 - so let's create the frame first
03:04 - so frame dot set default close operation
03:08 - and then within the parentheses J frame
03:13 - dot exit on close so this will actually
03:17 - stop when we exit out of it and then
03:20 - we'll need to set a size for this frame
03:22 - so frame dot set size I usually pick for
03:27 - 20 by 420 and then we need to set a
03:31 - layout frame dot set layout and then I
03:35 - usually type in null because I like to
03:37 - manually place everything and then we
03:39 - need to set the visibility to true so
03:42 - frame dot set visible true okay
03:47 - let's create our button and add it to
03:49 - our frame so we'll do that before our
03:52 - frame within our constructor so that is
03:55 - called my button that's the name of our
03:57 - button my button dot set bounds and
04:01 - we'll place this where X is 100 and then
04:05 - maybe where Y is 160 this will be 200
04:10 - pixels long and 40 pixels for the height
04:14 - then this is normally focusable so we
04:18 - want to set focusable to false it's not
04:23 - entirely necessary but sometimes buttons
04:26 - are high light
04:27 - and it's kind of annoying and then we
04:29 - need to add an action listener so my
04:33 - button dot add action listener and then
04:40 - within parenthesis parenthesis just type
04:42 - in this now we'll need this class to
04:45 - implement the action listener interface
04:47 - so right next to your class name type in
04:50 - implements action listener and we'll
04:55 - probably need an import okay so we'll
05:00 - need this import as well and we need to
05:02 - add unimplemented methods so this is
05:05 - going to be our action performed method
05:08 - when we click on the button but first we
05:10 - should make sure that everything is here
05:11 - so let's see if our button is actually
05:14 - on the panel oh nope not yet because we
05:16 - need to add the button to the frame
05:18 - because I forgot
05:19 - so frame dot add my button honestly
05:25 - that's very easy to do to forget to add
05:27 - something to your frame okay it should
05:29 - be there now yeah we're good so it
05:32 - currently doesn't do anything so what we
05:34 - should do is that we're going to create
05:35 - a new instance of our new window class
05:38 - whenever we click on this button so go
05:41 - to your actionperformed method and this
05:44 - is we're gonna type if a dot get source
05:49 - parenthesis is equal to my button we're
05:53 - going to trigger an event so what we'll
05:56 - do is create a new instance of our new
05:59 - window class so new window and we'll
06:03 - call this maybe my window equals new new
06:10 - window that's kind of a tongue twister
06:12 - maybe I should have named it something
06:14 - different but hey it works okay so then
06:17 - when we click on this it's going to
06:20 - launch an instance of our new window
06:22 - class but we actually have to work on
06:24 - that class now because it doesn't appear
06:25 - to do anything so that's pretty much
06:28 - everything for our launch page there's
06:30 - one more line that we're going to add
06:32 - near the end of this so we'll be heading
06:34 - back here later so let's go to our new
06:37 - window class then so what we're going to
06:40 - do here
06:41 - create a constructor first so new window
06:44 - parentheses curly braces and outside of
06:48 - our constructor we're going to create a
06:49 - J frame so we can actually see what's
06:51 - going on so J frame and we'll call this
06:54 - frame equals new J frame parentheses
06:58 - semi-colon and let's create a label
07:01 - that'll just say hello so we can see
07:02 - something so we'll create a J label will
07:07 - call this label equals new J label and
07:11 - let's set some text such as hello then
07:16 - we're going to do a few things within
07:18 - our constructor but we need to import a
07:20 - few things
07:23 - all right so within our constructor
07:26 - we're going to create a frame and
07:28 - honestly we can just copy this from our
07:30 - launch page so frame dot set default
07:33 - close operation we need to set the size
07:35 - a layout and the visibility and I'm just
07:38 - gonna copy all this because I'm lazy and
07:40 - paste it right in here near the end
07:43 - let's work on our label so label dot set
07:50 - bounds we'll place this where X is zero
07:53 - where Y is 0 this will be 100 pixels
07:57 - long and a height of 50 pixels and let's
08:01 - also set the font just because it's
08:02 - normally like very small so label dot
08:05 - set font new font parentheses so we
08:12 - don't really care for a font type but if
08:13 - you want a specific font you can place
08:15 - that here I'll just set it to the
08:17 - default and put a null here we'll have
08:19 - this be plain so font dot plain and a
08:23 - size of 25 and we need to import
08:27 - something as well there we go and we
08:30 - need to add the label to the frame so
08:32 - I'll do that here frame dot add label
08:40 - okay so let's run this
08:44 - okay let's click on the new window
08:46 - button to launch a new window all right
08:48 - we got one one problem though if we keep
08:51 - on clicking on this button will keep on
08:52 - getting new windows so we
08:55 - have like a bunch here so if you only
08:56 - want there to be one window this is what
08:59 - you can do so going back to our launch
09:01 - page so the first line within our
09:04 - actionperformed method within our if
09:06 - statement this is what we're gonna type
09:09 - frame dot dispose parentheses semicolon
09:13 - so it's going to basically close out of
09:17 - our frame so now if we were to run this
09:19 - and we click on the new window button
09:22 - it's going to get rid of the launch page
09:25 - and open a new window so to sum up
09:28 - everything if you want to open a new
09:30 - window you'll want to create an instance
09:32 - of the class that contains the window
09:34 - that you want to appear and then you'll
09:37 - want to hook this up to like some sort
09:39 - of event to trigger it and in my case
09:41 - it's a button so when we click the
09:43 - button here it's going to perform the
09:45 - action performed method and then create
09:47 - a instance of our new window class then
09:50 - so there's other ways that you can
09:52 - instantiate a new window of this class
09:56 - or whatever else you want to name this
09:57 - but you usually need some way to
09:59 - actually trigger this being instantiated
10:02 - but for this example we just have this
10:04 - hooked up to a button but yeah that's
10:06 - the basics of opening a new window in
10:09 - Java if you want a copy of all this code
10:10 - I'll post it in the comments down below
10:12 - and that's one of a few ways to open a
10:15 - new window in Java hey you yeah I'm
10:19 - talking to you if you learn something
10:21 - new then you can help me help you in 3
10:24 - easy steps by smashing that like button
