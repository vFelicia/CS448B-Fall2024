00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
00:02 - hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to explain
00:04 - how we can move files using python so
00:07 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - if you find this video helpful please
00:14 - remember to like
00:15 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:18 - help keep this channel running
00:19 - welcome back everybody to another video
00:22 - regarding that thing that we do called
00:23 - programming and in this video we're
00:25 - going to be moving files using python
00:28 - and in order to do so i recommend
00:30 - importing the os module
00:32 - this is included with the standard
00:33 - python library all you need to do is
00:36 - import it
00:36 - and now let's create two variables a
00:39 - variable called source
00:40 - that will hold the location of where our
00:42 - source file is located
00:44 - as well as a variable called destination
00:47 - to function as well
00:48 - the destination now for this video i'm
00:51 - going to move a file within my project
00:53 - folder
00:54 - to my desktop so to do so i'm going to
00:56 - create a
00:57 - new file i will name this test.txt
01:01 - but take the liberty to name this
01:02 - whatever you want so
01:04 - i'm going to list the location of where
01:07 - my test file is located
01:09 - since this is within my projects folder
01:11 - i only need the file name
01:12 - if this was someplace else on your
01:14 - computer you would probably need the
01:15 - file path
01:16 - and now where would i like to move this
01:18 - file to i would like to move this file
01:20 - to my desktop
01:22 - so i just need the file path so i'm
01:24 - going to go to my desktop
01:26 - right click go to properties i'm going
01:28 - to copy
01:29 - this location and paste it within my
01:32 - destination
01:33 - and i will add slash desktop
01:36 - slash test.txt you can also rename this
01:40 - too if you want i will just keep it the
01:41 - same
01:42 - now if you have single backslashes
01:44 - you'll likely need to change these
01:46 - to double backslashes because that is
01:49 - the escape sequence
01:50 - to print a backslash within a string so
01:53 - we have a
01:54 - source location as well as a destination
01:56 - location
01:57 - now we can begin i would recommend
02:00 - writing our code within
02:01 - a try and accept block to handle any
02:04 - exceptions
02:04 - so i would like to handle any file not
02:07 - found error exceptions
02:08 - just in case our program cannot locate
02:11 - our source file
02:12 - so let's print a message if that is the
02:14 - case
02:15 - perhaps source plus was not
02:19 - found now within our try block let's
02:21 - check to see if there is already a file
02:23 - at this destination
02:25 - because i would not like to save over it
02:27 - if there's already a file there
02:29 - so let's do some basic file detection if
02:32 - os dot path dot exists
02:36 - and i will pass in my destination as an
02:39 - argument to the exists
02:40 - function so if there is already a file
02:43 - here i should probably let the user know
02:46 - print there is already a
02:49 - file there else
02:52 - we can replace our files honestly if you
02:55 - do not care about saving over
02:57 - any files you can omit this part so else
03:00 - os dot replace and we will pass
03:04 - in our source and our destination
03:07 - as arguments and let's print a message
03:11 - to the console window to let the user
03:13 - know that
03:14 - source plus was
03:18 - moved all right let's try this oh i
03:20 - accidentally deleted my
03:22 - file test.txt all right
03:25 - now this should disappear in three
03:28 - two one and it's gone
03:32 - test.txt was moved and it should now be
03:35 - on my desktop
03:36 - which it is now you can also use this to
03:39 - move a directory as well
03:40 - i'm going to create a new directory i
03:43 - will name this folder and i will change
03:46 - source to folder and the destination
03:50 - from test.txt
03:51 - to folder and now this should move my
03:55 - folder
03:57 - there is already a file there
04:01 - oh let's delete that okay
04:04 - folder was moved alright everybody so
04:07 - that is how to move a
04:08 - file and or directory using python if
04:11 - you would like a copy of this code
04:13 - i will post this in the comment section
04:15 - down below but
04:16 - yeah that is how to move a file and or
04:19 - directory
04:19 - using python
