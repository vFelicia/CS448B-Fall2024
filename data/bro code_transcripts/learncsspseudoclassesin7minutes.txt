00:00 - hey how's it going everybody today I'm
00:01 - going to explain pseudo classes pseudo
00:04 - classes are keywords added to a selector
00:06 - they modify the behavior of an element
00:09 - when they're in a certain state for
00:11 - example I have a button when I hover my
00:13 - cursor over the button I set this button
00:15 - to increase in font size and also change
00:18 - the background color to Green
00:20 - hover is an example of a pseudo class it
00:23 - modifies our buttons Behavior active is
00:26 - when an item is currently selected so
00:27 - with my mouse I'm going to left-click
00:30 - the mouse button and hold it the button
00:32 - is now red basically they modify a
00:34 - special state of an element so let's
00:37 - begin with a few examples let's go to
00:39 - our index file and we will create a
00:41 - hyperlink
00:42 - I will set the hrep attribute to be I
00:45 - don't know Google or something
00:47 - https
00:49 - colon do forward slashes google.com
00:53 - be sure to close it I'll type the word
00:56 - Google
00:57 - here is my hyperlink to Google a link is
01:01 - also a pseudo class I will select any
01:03 - anchor tags that we have we have one
01:05 - I'll set the link pseudo class to have
01:09 - these CSS properties so a colon then the
01:13 - name of the pseudo class
01:15 - instead of this text being blue let's
01:17 - set it to be like a light blue I will
01:20 - set the color property to be a light
01:22 - blue color let's pick one
01:31 - that's pretty good when I hover my
01:33 - cursor over this link I want the color
01:35 - to change we are selecting any anchor
01:38 - tags colon then we will use the hover
01:41 - pseudo class
01:43 - and I will change the color you know
01:45 - what let's use what we currently have
01:47 - I'll just make it a little brighter
01:51 - now when I hover over this link the
01:54 - color changes I'll increase the font
01:56 - size too
01:58 - it's kind of like we're zooming in on
01:59 - this element
02:00 - let's do 1.1 em
02:03 - so the font size increases slightly
02:06 - active kicks in when you're holding down
02:07 - the cursor over an element a colon
02:10 - active
02:13 - let's change the font size to be 1.1 em
02:18 - again
02:20 - I will set the color to be let's go with
02:23 - the dark blue color
02:28 - when I left click on the mouse and hold
02:30 - it this link is now in the active state
02:35 - if a link is visited by default it's
02:38 - purple let's change that a colon visited
02:43 - when our anchor element is in the
02:45 - visited state I'll change the font color
02:49 - how about a gray color
02:55 - there
02:57 - all right so those are a few basic
02:58 - pseudo classes
03:00 - in this next example we'll need a list
03:02 - an unordered list
03:07 - we will need 10 list item elements
03:14 - this is number okay let's copy this
03:18 - paste it nine times
03:23 - one two three four five six seven eight
03:28 - nine
03:29 - now we will select any list items and
03:32 - use the hoverseudo class when I hover
03:35 - over one of these list items I will
03:37 - change the background color of that list
03:39 - item to be a highlighter yellow color
03:43 - I will change the background color to be
03:47 - yellow
03:50 - let's go with that
03:53 - so check this out when I hover over a
03:55 - list item the background color changes
03:59 - there's also the not pseudo class
04:04 - we can select anything that is not being
04:07 - hovered over
04:09 - not kind of does the opposite anything
04:12 - that is not in this state anything
04:14 - that's not being hovered over
04:16 - let's set the color to be like a gray
04:19 - color
04:20 - anything that's not currently being
04:22 - hovered over is gray but when it is
04:24 - hovered over it's yellow
04:27 - so that is the not pseudo class anything
04:30 - that is not in this state will have
04:33 - these CSS properties
04:35 - then we have the nth child pseudo class
04:39 - list item colon
04:41 - and
04:42 - child parentheses
04:45 - anything that's selected let's set to be
04:48 - yellow
04:54 - depending on what value you put within
04:56 - the parentheses that element will be
04:58 - selected one corresponds to the first
05:01 - element
05:02 - to us for the second
05:04 - three is for the Third
05:06 - nine is for the ninth element for all
05:09 - odd number elements type odd for all
05:11 - even elements type even
05:14 - for every third element that would be
05:16 - three n
05:17 - three six nine for every fourth that
05:21 - would be 4N
05:22 - you can add an offset too normally with
05:25 - 3n that's every third but if I want to
05:27 - start at the beginning I can add plus
05:29 - one
05:30 - one four seven
05:33 - or even plus two two five eight it's
05:36 - kind of like a formula this is really
05:38 - handy with JavaScript because you can
05:40 - place a variable within here the value
05:42 - of that variable can change which is
05:43 - pretty cool all right last example
05:46 - let's create a development
05:51 - with an ID of greeting
05:57 - the text will be hover here
06:00 - within our development let's create a
06:03 - paragraph element
06:05 - with some text of hello
06:09 - normally I want this Hello message to be
06:11 - hidden until we hover over this element
06:13 - our div element
06:15 - I'm going to style
06:18 - our greetings
06:20 - P element
06:23 - I'll set the background color to be
06:27 - maybe a blue this time
06:30 - like the light blue
06:35 - I'll add a little bit of padding too
06:37 - maybe 10 pixels
06:41 - to make this element invisible I can set
06:44 - the display property to be none
06:48 - what I would like to do when I hover
06:50 - over the settlement I want this element
06:53 - to be displayed
06:55 - we are selecting our greeting
06:58 - then when we hover over it
07:01 - I want the P element of this div section
07:05 - to have the display property
07:07 - of block display it as a block level
07:10 - element
07:11 - when we hover over the settlement it
07:13 - displays the P element within our div
07:16 - section
07:17 - this will come really handy when we
07:19 - create drop down menus those are pseudo
07:21 - classes elements can have special States
07:24 - like when they're being hovered over or
07:26 - you click on them using these pseudo
07:28 - classes we can apply CSS properties to
07:30 - those elements when we interact with
07:32 - them and those are pseudo classes and
07:34 - CSS
