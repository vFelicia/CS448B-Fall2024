00:00 - hey everyone today I need to explain
00:01 - comparison operators operators are
00:04 - denoted with the dollar sign comparison
00:06 - operators return data based on value
00:09 - comparisons in previous examples we
00:12 - would type
00:14 - db.students.find then list some criteria
00:17 - like if we're looking for SpongeBob we
00:19 - would say a name SpongeBob now what if
00:22 - you would like to find everybody but
00:24 - SpongeBob well you can use the not
00:27 - equals comparison operator we would
00:29 - enclose it within a document body
00:33 - precede our value with the not equal
00:36 - comparison operator
00:38 - dollar sign and E colon find every name
00:42 - that's not SpongeBob
00:44 - that gives us four records Patrick Sandy
00:48 - Gary Larry
00:50 - SpongeBob isn't within here that is the
00:53 - not equals comparison operator return
00:55 - every document that has a name not equal
00:58 - to SpongeBob
01:00 - let's go over a few more
01:02 - let's cover less than and less than
01:04 - equals to
01:06 - DB dot students dot find
01:10 - everybody that has an age
01:13 - that is less than so dollar sign LT for
01:18 - less than
01:19 - 20.
01:21 - that gives us one document Gary who's
01:24 - 18.
01:25 - or we could use less than equal to
01:29 - change LT to LTE that means R20 is
01:32 - inclusive uh maybe let's change this to
01:35 - 27. return every document where the age
01:38 - field is less than or equal to 27 that
01:42 - would give us two results Sandy who's 27
01:45 - exactly and Gary who's 18. let's do
01:49 - greater than
01:51 - return every document where age is
01:54 - greater than 27.
01:57 - that gives us three documents SpongeBob
01:59 - who's 30 Patrick who's 38 Larry who's
02:03 - 32.
02:05 - let's do greater than equals
02:08 - that would be GTE
02:10 - find everybody that's greater than or
02:13 - equal to 27. that gives us four records
02:17 - SpongeBob Patrick Sandy who's 27 exactly
02:20 - and Larry so that's less than less than
02:24 - equals to greater than and greater than
02:26 - equals to
02:27 - you can use more than one comparison
02:29 - operator to find values within a certain
02:32 - range let's find every student
02:35 - whose GPA is between three and four
02:39 - DB that's students dot find
02:41 - we are searching for GPA
02:46 - let's use the greater than equals to
02:48 - comparison operator
02:50 - return every GPA that's greater than
02:52 - three
02:53 - comma
02:55 - and less than or equal to four
02:59 - so these would be the students that have
03:01 - a good GPA
03:03 - SpongeBob and Sandy SpongeBob has a GPA
03:06 - of 3.2 Sandy's is 4.0
03:09 - you can use more than one comparison
03:11 - operator to give you a range
03:13 - now another good operator is the in
03:16 - operator with the in operator we can
03:19 - return all records that have one of
03:21 - these matching values
03:23 - so db.students.find
03:26 - let's find any student whose name is
03:30 - within this array
03:32 - we will pass in a document body
03:35 - use the in operator colon
03:38 - then list an array an array of values
03:41 - let's find anybody whose name is either
03:43 - SpongeBob Patrick or Sandy So within an
03:46 - array we will list our values
03:49 - return anybody whose name is SpongeBob
03:53 - Patrick
03:55 - or Sandy
03:59 - there SpongeBob Patrick Sandy with the
04:02 - in logical operator you will return all
04:05 - documents where one of the values in
04:08 - this array is found within this field
04:11 - you can also use not in which is nin so
04:15 - let's copy this line
04:17 - clear our screen
04:19 - paste it
04:21 - change in to nin
04:23 - not in
04:25 - return all documents where name doesn't
04:29 - have one of these values
04:31 - that would give us Gary and Larry we are
04:34 - given everybody's name that's not
04:36 - SpongeBob Patrick or Sandy let's switch
04:39 - to Compass and I'll show you how we can
04:41 - do the same thing
04:42 - within Compass you would write your
04:44 - filter within this text box
04:46 - return everybody who has a GPA field
04:51 - that is greater than or equal to 3 GTE
04:56 - 3.
04:57 - that gives us SpongeBob and Sandy
05:00 - give us everybody who is let's say age
05:06 - is less than
05:08 - 27.
05:11 - that gives us Gary all right everybody
05:14 - so in conclusion comparison operators
05:16 - return data based on value comparisons
05:18 - and those are comparison operators in
05:21 - mongodb
