00:02 - all right welcome back we're talking
00:03 - about the conditional operator which is
00:05 - represented by a question mark
00:07 - so the conditional operator is used in
00:09 - conditional assignment
00:11 - if a condition is true or false and we
00:14 - follow
00:14 - this formula we have some sort of
00:16 - condition or expression then we add a
00:18 - question mark kind of like we're asking
00:20 - a question
00:20 - is this true if it is do x if not do y
00:24 - so we'll write a simple program to check
00:27 - the temperature outside
00:28 - so we'll write this using an if-else
00:30 - statement first and then later on we'll
00:32 - use the conditional operator and take a
00:34 - look at the differences
00:35 - so let's say we have a double named
00:38 - temperature and i'll set this equal to
00:41 - 20 degrees celsius
00:42 - as well as a string message i will
00:46 - declare this but not yet assign it
00:47 - so what if we would like to assign our
00:50 - variable message
00:51 - a custom message based on the
00:52 - temperature well if we're using if else
00:55 - statements that would look like this
00:57 - so we need a condition if temperature
01:01 - is greater than or equal to let's say 15
01:04 - degrees celsius
01:06 - then we will assign message a string
01:09 - message equals
01:13 - it's warm outside
01:17 - else message
01:20 - equals it's cold outside
01:24 - and then at the end i would like to
01:26 - display my message within a writeline
01:28 - statement
01:28 - console that write line message
01:32 - and this will work just fine no issues
01:35 - so my temperature is currently 20
01:37 - and this will print the message it's
01:39 - warm outside now there is a way to
01:41 - shorten this and that's by using a
01:43 - conditional operator
01:44 - so if we were to take that approach we
01:46 - would have to follow this formula
01:48 - so let me just copy this we need our
01:49 - condition our condition
01:51 - is temperature is greater than or equal
01:54 - to
01:54 - 15. question mark like we're asking a
01:57 - question
01:58 - if it's true then do this so we will
02:00 - take
02:01 - its form outside in place of x
02:05 - if not then we'd do this it's cold
02:08 - outside
02:09 - but these are returning values so we
02:11 - need to assign them to something
02:13 - so we will say message equals
02:17 - this is our condition temperature
02:18 - greater than or equal to 15
02:20 - question mark if that's true assign this
02:23 - if not assign that and that's all there
02:25 - is to it and we don't really need all of
02:27 - this anymore
02:28 - and then i will display my message
02:30 - within a redline statement
02:32 - and this will do the same thing it's
02:34 - warm outside
02:36 - you could even take this a step further
02:37 - too you could place just this within a
02:39 - writeline statement and get rid of the
02:41 - message completely
02:42 - we don't even really need that message
02:43 - variable
02:45 - so yeah that's the conditional operator
02:47 - you can use this in conditional
02:49 - assignment if you need to assign
02:50 - some variable if some condition that you
02:52 - set is true or false
02:54 - it's kind of like a shortcut so yeah
02:56 - that's the conditional operator
02:58 - in c sharp
