00:00 - hey what's going on everybody in this
00:01 - video I'm going to show you how we can
00:03 - create some font awesome icons using
00:05 - HTML and CSS all right let's get started
00:08 - everybody I'm going to direct you to
00:11 - this website font awesome.com this isn't
00:14 - a sponsorship or anything like that but
00:16 - this is a pretty good place to get some
00:18 - icons Google Icons is another good
00:20 - source but I find that font awesome does
00:23 - have a larger variety of icons to start
00:25 - using icons from this site from the home
00:27 - page we will start for free because I
00:30 - don't like to pay for things
00:31 - you will need a kit you can type in your
00:34 - email like fake gmail.com
00:37 - then send kit code then you just have to
00:39 - confirm your email
00:42 - now once you log in you'll have access
00:44 - to a kit if I were to click on my kit
00:48 - I have a line of JavaScript that
00:50 - contains a link to my kit there's going
00:52 - to be a unique number let's copy the
00:55 - script then place it in the head of our
00:57 - HTML document right here
01:00 - we now have access to those icons on
01:03 - font awesome to browse for icons go to
01:06 - the icons tab then we can perform a
01:08 - search
01:09 - I would like an icon of a home or a
01:12 - house
01:15 - I would like this one so I'll click on
01:17 - it
01:19 - you can choose a classic style or a
01:21 - sharp Style with sharp corners
01:24 - this is solid that's regular this is
01:27 - light I'll stick with solid
01:30 - you can select animations but I won't
01:32 - use animations for this example you can
01:35 - rotate this icon
01:36 - you can change the color
01:38 - and you can change the default size
01:42 - this is 2xs this is 2XL
01:46 - to include this icon we can copy this
01:48 - element
01:49 - it's an eye element so let's copy this
01:52 - eye element
01:54 - within the body of my document I can
01:56 - paste that I element and there's my icon
02:00 - if you want to remove the color and
02:03 - change it with your CSS style sheet we
02:05 - can remove the style attribute
02:11 - if you need something even larger than
02:13 - 2XL we can change this element up to 10
02:16 - times the size with 10x
02:19 - that's a little too large for my liking
02:21 - let's go with 5X
02:23 - let's find three other icons that we
02:25 - would like
02:26 - I'm going to find the Twitter logo
02:29 - that's right here
02:30 - I need to copy this eye element
02:33 - then I will paste it
02:37 - then I'll change the size
02:41 - fa-5x
02:46 - okay Twitter
02:48 - YouTube would be good
02:52 - copy this eye element
02:54 - paste it again
02:56 - I would like the 5x version fa-5x
03:01 - let's select one more icon
03:04 - let's go with tick tock
03:09 - and that is all we'll need
03:15 - again I would like the 5x sized version
03:19 - all right that's a good amount of icons
03:22 - I will Center all of these icons one way
03:25 - in which I can do that is to place all
03:27 - of these elements within a div
03:29 - with the class of icons
03:36 - all right let's go to our style sheet
03:38 - I will take my class of icons
03:42 - then text align Center
03:46 - to right justify these we can set that
03:48 - to right
03:49 - but I'll keep them in the center
03:52 - I'll change the color of these icons
03:56 - let's begin with our house we'll need to
03:58 - copy this entire class
04:01 - I don't want the sharp version
04:03 - I will copy this entire class
04:07 - then within my style sheet I will select
04:09 - that class
04:10 - dot then paste the name of that class
04:13 - now we can't include spaces you can
04:16 - replace the spaces with the DOT
04:19 - with our house icon
04:21 - let's change the color to something Gray
04:28 - let's go with the lighter color like
04:30 - that okay let's do this with the other
04:33 - icons
04:37 - then we have Twitter
04:40 - replace the spaces with dots
04:43 - I will change the color
04:47 - so let's try and find Twitter blue
04:50 - I think that's fairly close
04:55 - okay then we have YouTube
05:05 - color red
05:11 - then tick tock
05:27 - I think that's fairly close
05:30 - all right now what we'll do is turn
05:32 - these icons into hyperlinks we'll
05:35 - surround each eye mint with a pair of a
05:37 - tags
05:43 - foreign
05:55 - then within the href attribute we can
05:57 - set that to some website
05:59 - I won't set the href attribute to our
06:01 - house icon let's do that with Twitter
06:03 - Youtube and tick tock
06:05 - so with Twitter I will set the href
06:08 - attribute to be https colon to forward
06:11 - slashes twitter.com
06:15 - let's do this with our YouTube icon
06:17 - replace Twitter with YouTube
06:22 - then tick tock
06:25 - so this should work let's click on
06:27 - Twitter that works
06:29 - YouTube
06:32 - and tick tock
06:35 - with hyperlinks there is some underlying
06:38 - text decoration included let's remove
06:40 - that
06:42 - let's take our icons
06:45 - then any anchor tags within our icons
06:47 - class
06:48 - we'll set the text decoration
06:54 - to be none
06:56 - that should remove them I'll also apply
06:59 - a little bit of margin between each of
07:01 - these icons
07:02 - let's do margin
07:04 - Dash right set to 20 pixels
07:09 - not bad for some additional practice
07:11 - when we hover a cursor over one of these
07:13 - icons let's increase the lightness let's
07:16 - begin with our house let's copy these
07:19 - CSS properties
07:20 - paste them we'll apply the hoverseudo
07:23 - class
07:25 - I'll increase the lightness by 10
07:27 - percent
07:28 - I went from 66 to 76 percent
07:32 - when we hover our cursor over our house
07:34 - icon it should be a little bit lighter
07:38 - okay let's apply this for the other
07:39 - icons
07:41 - then we have Twitter
07:44 - apply the hoverseudo class oh I'm using
07:47 - RGB values let me change that to hsl
07:54 - I'll increase the lightness to 60.
07:57 - let's do this with YouTube
08:06 - then tick tock
08:13 - all right now when we hover our cursor
08:15 - over these icons they should be a little
08:17 - bit lighter
08:19 - Tick Tock is still a little bit dark let
08:20 - me increase it further to 30 percent
08:22 - that's much better
08:25 - all right everybody so that is an
08:26 - introduction to including icons in your
08:28 - web page using CSS
