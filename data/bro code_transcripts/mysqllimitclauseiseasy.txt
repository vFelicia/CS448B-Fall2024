00:00 - hello it's me again today I will be
00:02 - explaining the limit Clause the limit
00:04 - Clause is used to limit the number of
00:07 - records that are quarried it's very
00:09 - useful if you're working with a lot of
00:11 - data one use is that you can display a
00:13 - large data set on different pages also
00:17 - known as pagination here's an example
00:20 - I have a few customers
00:22 - not very many I'm working with a small
00:24 - data set if I would ever need to limit
00:27 - the amount of customers that are
00:28 - displayed I can add a limit Clause then
00:32 - set how many I would like to display
00:34 - I would like the first customer limit
00:37 - one
00:38 - that would return Fred fish in my
00:40 - example if I need the first two that
00:43 - would be Fred then Larry
00:45 - three is Fred Larry bubble that's kind
00:49 - of a weird first name
00:50 - and then four would be poppy currently
00:53 - these records are organized by customer
00:55 - ID we could combine the limit Clause
00:58 - with the order by clause
01:00 - let's order by last name
01:04 - then limit one
01:06 - that would return bubble bass it's in
01:10 - alphabetical order
01:11 - or we could do last name
01:13 - descending limit one
01:16 - poppy puff has the name and least
01:18 - alphabetical order I guess basically
01:20 - speaking limit limits the number of
01:23 - records that are returned it's very
01:25 - useful in combination with the order by
01:27 - clause which we learned about in the
01:29 - previous topic now with the limit Clause
01:32 - you can add an offset
01:34 - limit
01:35 - one one
01:37 - the first number is the offset limit to
01:40 - one record after the first that should
01:43 - technically return Larry Lobster
01:46 - yep Larry so limit two would add an
01:50 - offset of two
01:51 - which returns bubble Bass
01:54 - limit three would return poppy puff
01:57 - using an offset would be very helpful
01:59 - when working with a large data set if
02:02 - you need to display your records on
02:03 - different pages suppose that our data
02:05 - set is maybe 100 customers I need to
02:09 - display 10 customers per page so the
02:12 - first 10 would be just limit 10.
02:15 - but you know my data set's really small
02:17 - so it's not going to be apparent if I
02:19 - need the next set of 10 customers I can
02:21 - add an offset of 10. although I don't
02:24 - have that many customers to begin with
02:25 - the next set of 10 customers would be an
02:28 - offset of 20 then displayed 10 you know
02:31 - then 30 40 so on and so forth so yeah
02:36 - that's the limit Clause you will limit
02:38 - the results that are queried type limit
02:40 - then some number you could add an offset
02:43 - so display some number of Records after
02:46 - an offset but yeah that is the limit
02:48 - clause in MySQL
