00:00 - hey how's it going everybody today I
00:01 - need to explain the span and div tags in
00:05 - HTML the span tag is an inline container
00:08 - to group elements for styling purposes
00:10 - the div tag it's very similar except
00:14 - it's a block container to group elements
00:16 - for styling purposes here's an example
00:19 - let's create two H1 titles
00:22 - this is a span title
00:28 - then close it
00:30 - let's copy this line of markup then
00:33 - paste it the second line will be this is
00:36 - a div title I'm going to enclose my
00:39 - first sentence with a pair of span tags
00:42 - so we need an opening span tag and a
00:45 - closing span tag somewhere
00:48 - alright with this set of span tags we
00:51 - are enclosing this text within a
00:53 - container it's an inline container we
00:55 - can apply some CSS styling to the
00:57 - sentence whatever is sandwiched between
00:59 - the pair of span tags let's change the
01:02 - background color of the title
01:05 - I will set the style attribute to equal
01:08 - background Dash color then pick a color
01:12 - how about red
01:14 - than a semicolon there so the background
01:17 - of my title is red but you know what
01:20 - that red is a little bright let's do
01:22 - tomato
01:24 - I think that's a better color whatever
01:26 - is enclosed with a pair of span tags we
01:29 - can apply some inline CSS styling too
01:31 - now with div this creates a block level
01:34 - container
01:35 - so I will surround this sentence with a
01:38 - pair of div tags div meaning division
01:44 - let's apply that same styling
01:46 - I'll copy my style attribute
01:49 - paste it let's change the color to B
01:52 - maybe cyan
01:55 - alright here we are
01:57 - this is a title using span this is a
02:00 - title using div span is an inline
02:02 - container div is a block level container
02:06 - it takes the entire width of my document
02:08 - you can see that this is all blue
02:11 - let's create a pair of paragraph tags
02:15 - this is a span
02:18 - sentence
02:20 - then close it
02:22 - let's copy this paragraph paste it again
02:26 - then change the second sentence to div
02:29 - all right let's enclose our first
02:31 - sentence with a pair of span tags
02:35 - all right I will set the style to be red
02:37 - well tomato tomato color technically
02:42 - it's kind of like we're highlighting the
02:43 - text much like the mark tags in the last
02:46 - topic
02:48 - let's copy this tag
02:51 - change span to div
02:54 - then the color how about cyan
02:58 - and then we need to close the div tag
03:05 - there we are
03:09 - all right now let's create two large
03:11 - paragraphs
03:13 - we need a pair of paragraph tags
03:17 - in vs code to generate some sample text
03:19 - you can type lorem then tab
03:23 - so I will copy this line
03:26 - paste it again
03:29 - let's say after the first sentence I
03:31 - would like to add a background color
03:34 - so right here I will add
03:36 - a Spam tag an opening span tag then
03:39 - where would I like to close it
03:41 - let's do so before the closing paragraph
03:43 - tag
03:45 - then I will change the background color
03:55 - all right we have highlighted the second
03:57 - sentence let's do this with div tags now
03:59 - with our next paragraph let's create an
04:01 - opening div tag
04:03 - then we'll need to close it somewhere
04:06 - let's close it before the closing
04:07 - paragraph tag
04:11 - and then I will change the background
04:13 - color
04:16 - within the opening div tag I will set
04:18 - the background color to be cyan
04:21 - what we have done is created a block
04:23 - level element for the second sentence
04:25 - within our paragraph basically speaking
04:28 - we can use the span and div tags to
04:30 - group together HTML for styling purposes
04:32 - span is an inline container div is a
04:36 - block level container we'll be using
04:38 - these more when we reach CSS and well
04:41 - everybody those are the span and div
04:42 - tags in HTML
