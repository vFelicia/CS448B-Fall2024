00:00 - hey how's it going everybody today I'm
00:01 - going to show you how we can include a
00:03 - background image using CSS so sit back
00:06 - relax and enjoy the show all right let's
00:08 - get started everybody what you'll need
00:10 - to begin with is a high resolution
00:12 - picture for a background I just so
00:15 - happen to find a picture of Central Park
00:16 - in New York City the higher the
00:18 - resolution the better so place that
00:20 - image within your website folder in our
00:22 - HTML document let's create a title
00:26 - I'm just going to say the word hello
00:30 - and we'll need some text just as a point
00:33 - of reference
00:34 - I'll generate some text by typing lorem
00:37 - then hitting Tab and that's good enough
00:39 - for now so within our style sheet I will
00:42 - select the body of our document we are
00:45 - going to include that background image
00:47 - with the background image property
00:50 - then we need a URL
00:53 - the URL is going to be a relative file
00:55 - path or an absolute file path to where
00:58 - this image is located they're right next
01:00 - to each other I just need the file name
01:02 - so my image name is background and this
01:06 - is a jpeg
01:09 - alright so here's my image so far it's
01:11 - gigantic it's huge let me show you what
01:13 - happens if I use a smaller version of
01:16 - the same image
01:17 - this image I think is like 500 pixels
01:20 - for the width or so
01:21 - background Dash small
01:24 - so here's my image
01:27 - but it repeats itself
01:29 - there is a background repeat property
01:32 - So within the body of my document
01:35 - I will set the background Dash repeat
01:38 - property to be no
01:41 - repeat now this image isn't repeating
01:44 - we're headed in the right direction
01:47 - what we'll do now is take this image and
01:50 - Center it in the middle of my viewport
01:54 - take the background Dash position
01:57 - property and set that to Center
02:03 - it's centered horizontally
02:05 - another property we'll need is
02:07 - background attachment
02:12 - background Dash attachment
02:16 - I think I misspelled attachment there we
02:18 - are
02:19 - the background attachment property sets
02:22 - whether a background image scrolls with
02:24 - the rest of the page or is it fixed we
02:27 - will set the image to be fixed
02:29 - now this image is in the middle of my
02:32 - viewport
02:35 - see even if I were to expand and
02:36 - contract it
02:37 - it's still within the middle
02:40 - lastly we need this image to take up the
02:42 - entire space of the background
02:46 - and there's one last property
02:49 - background Dash size we will set that to
02:54 - cover
02:55 - now this image is taking up the entire
02:57 - space of my background which is what I
02:59 - wanted I'm going to use that high
03:02 - resolution picture that I used
03:03 - previously
03:06 - that's much better
03:09 - all right everybody so that's how to add
03:11 - a background image using CSS
