00:00 - how's it going everybody it's your bro
here hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video I'm going to teach you guys how we
can swap two variables using Java let's
00:07 - get into it
00:09 - if you find this video helpful please
remember to Like comment and subscribe
00:15 - your support will help keep this channel
running alright well here we got two
00:19 - variables we got variable X which
contains water and variable Y which I'm
00:24 - gonna put kool-aid in more specifically
black cherry kool-aid so let's just put
00:28 - this in good enough and let's mix it
00:37 - perfect so we're going to create two
variables and these are going to be of
00:43 - the string datatype so we'll have string
x equals the word water and string y
00:51 - equals the word kool-aid and then let's
display these with a simple print line
00:59 - statement and within here I'll just type
in X colon space plus the variable X and
01:08 - then let's do the same thing for y so
we'll change X to Y and let's display
01:14 - these so X currently has water and Y
currently has kool-aid so what happens
01:20 - if we set X to equal Y well we get
kool-aid for both x and y okay we're
01:28 - gonna assign variable Y to variable X
shit so yeah it looks like we have
01:35 - kool-aid in both variable X and variable
Y let's try again maybe we can set Y to
01:40 - equal X no we just got water everywhere
let's try this again we're gonna assign
01:47 - variable X to variable Y this time okay
that doesn't seem to work guys my floor
01:54 - is getting really sticky so it appears
that we're going to have to store one of
01:58 - these values within another variable in
order to switch these so one thing
02:02 - though we can do is introduce another
variable and let's call this temp and
02:06 - temp is empty let's create another
string so we'll create string temp and
02:10 - we can either set this to null or
can assign no value at all where we
02:15 - simply just declared temp a variable so
what we're gonna do is actually take X
02:20 - and store X whatever value isn't here
within temp so we're gonna type temp
02:27 - equals x so now X can be filled with
something so we're going to fill it with
02:33 - variable Y so on our next line we're
going to set X to equal Y then we're
02:43 - going to take our temp variable and
store this within Y and lastly y equals
02:53 - temp breaking news ladies and gentlemen
we have switched the contents of X and
02:58 - white with the help of our variable temp
now back to you bro thank you for the
03:02 - live update news anchor bro it appears on our
end that we have also switched the
03:06 - contents of X and y as well so in
conclusion if the programming language
03:11 - you're using doesn't have any direct
function to switch to variables you
03:15 - could do this manually and you can
create another variable such as temp and
03:20 - temp is a temporary value to temporarily
store one of these values you can set
03:25 - temp to equal X or you can do this with
Y and then set X to equal Y and then Y
03:31 - to equal temp so your assignment for
today is to post two variables in the
03:35 - comments down below and the code that
you used to swap them and that ladies
03:39 - and gentlemen is how you can swap two
variables hey you yeah I'm talking to
03:45 - you if you learn something new then you
can help me help you in 3 easy steps by
