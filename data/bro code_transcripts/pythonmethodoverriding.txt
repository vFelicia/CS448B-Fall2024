00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
00:02 - hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to teach you
00:04 - guys about method overriding in python
00:06 - so
00:07 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - if i could have just a moment of your
00:13 - time please like
00:15 - comment and subscribe i would greatly
00:17 - appreciate it
00:19 - here's a super quick video on method
00:21 - overriding i have two classes
00:23 - a class called animal and a class called
00:25 - rabbit rabbit inherits from the animal
00:27 - class
00:27 - therefore rabbit is the child class an
00:29 - animal is the parent class
00:31 - within the animal class there is one
00:33 - method a method called eat
00:34 - and when you call this method all this
00:36 - will do is print this animal is eating
00:39 - the rabbit class inherits from the
00:40 - animal class therefore
00:42 - rabbit has access to this eat method and
00:44 - if i were to create a rabbit object
00:46 - and this rabbit used its eat method well
00:49 - then this is going to print
00:50 - this animal is eating now method of
00:53 - writing is the ability of an
00:54 - object-oriented programming language
00:56 - to allow a subclass also known as a
00:59 - child class
01:00 - to provide a specific implementation of
01:03 - a method
01:04 - that is already provided by one of its
01:06 - parents in this case we're going to
01:08 - override the eat method
01:09 - and what we can do is provide a more
01:11 - specific implementation
01:13 - for the rabbit class and now to override
01:16 - a method what we'll do is that within
01:18 - the child class we need to define a
01:20 - method with the same
01:21 - matching method signature that is the
01:23 - combination of a method's name
01:25 - plus its parameters both of these
01:27 - together are known as a
01:28 - method signature within the child class
01:31 - we will define
01:32 - and eat method with the same parameters
01:34 - def eat
01:35 - and in this case the only parameter is
01:37 - self just to keep this simple
01:39 - and what we'll do is that we'll provide
01:41 - a more specific
01:42 - implementation of the eat method
01:44 - specifically for rabbits
01:46 - so let's print something more closely
01:47 - associated with rabbits such as
01:50 - this rabbit is eating a
01:53 - carrot now if i were to run this program
01:55 - again
01:56 - we will instead use this implementation
01:58 - of the
01:59 - method instead of the one that it
02:01 - inherits from its parent class
02:02 - of animal basically speaking an object
02:05 - will use a method that is more closely
02:07 - associated with itself first
02:09 - before relying on a method that it may
02:11 - inherit from a parent class
02:13 - in this example we're using this version
02:15 - of the eat method
02:16 - specifically for rabbits instead of the
02:18 - version that we inherit from the parent
02:20 - class
02:21 - of animal that is the basics of method
02:23 - overriding i will post this code in the
02:25 - comment section down below
02:27 - and well yeah that's how to override a
02:29 - method using python
