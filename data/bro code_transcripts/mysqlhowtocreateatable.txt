00:00 - hey welcome back everybody in this video
00:02 - I'm going to show you how we can make
00:03 - some tables in MySQL a table in a
00:07 - relational database they consist of rows
00:10 - and columns kind of like an Excel
00:12 - spreadsheet in this topic we're going to
00:14 - create the table and the columns but
00:16 - we'll be populating the rows in the next
00:18 - video to create a table you'll type
00:21 - create
00:22 - table then the name of the table I'll
00:25 - create a table named employees
00:28 - then add a set of parentheses semicolon
00:30 - at the end within the set of parentheses
00:33 - we will list the columns
00:36 - for employees let's have an employee ID
00:40 - comma each column is separated with a
00:43 - comma
00:44 - then a first name
00:47 - last name
00:51 - how about hourly pay that'd be good
00:55 - higher date which date were they hired
00:57 - there's one thing that's missing after
01:00 - each column we need to set the data type
01:02 - of what we're storing within each column
01:04 - exactly is the data going to be whole
01:07 - integers decimals text a timestamp those
01:11 - are data types an employee ID that could
01:14 - be a whole integer the data type will be
01:17 - int add int after the column name
01:20 - a first name that's a series of
01:22 - characters the data type for some text
01:25 - would be VAR Char then within
01:28 - parentheses the maximum amount of
01:31 - characters I think 50 characters is
01:33 - enough for a first name
01:35 - last name
01:37 - varchar
01:38 - 50 is good
01:40 - hourly pay maybe our hourly pay is in
01:44 - dollars and cents we'll need a decimal
01:46 - portion there is a data type
01:49 - that is decimal add a set of parentheses
01:52 - we'll add the maximum amount of digits
01:55 - for our decimal I think five should be
01:58 - good
01:59 - then a Precision two for two decimal
02:02 - places
02:03 - the reason that I set the maximum digits
02:05 - of my hourly pay to be five is that I
02:08 - don't anticipate anybody's hourly pay
02:10 - being over
02:12 - 999.99 per hour that's pretty absurd I
02:15 - think five is enough then we have higher
02:18 - date
02:19 - there is a data type which is date if
02:21 - you need to work with dates otherwise
02:23 - there's date time if you need to include
02:25 - the time just the date is fine let's
02:28 - execute the script
02:31 - we have created our table employees if I
02:34 - were to refresh my schemas window
02:37 - underneath tables we have our employees
02:39 - table
02:40 - now I'll show you how we can select a
02:42 - table
02:43 - if you need to select your table you can
02:45 - type select
02:47 - asterisk from the name of the table
02:51 - employees
02:53 - let's take a look
02:55 - here's our table so far there's no rows
02:58 - but there are columns we have employee
03:01 - ID first name last name hourly pay and
03:03 - hire date if you need to rename a table
03:06 - you could type
03:07 - rename
03:09 - table the original name
03:12 - employees
03:14 - to whatever the new name is
03:16 - perhaps workers let's try that
03:20 - rename table employees to workers was
03:22 - successful if I refresh my schemas
03:25 - window
03:26 - the table employees is now known as
03:29 - workers but I think that's stupid let's
03:31 - go back and change it
03:33 - rename table workers to employees
03:38 - to drop a table I discussed this earlier
03:41 - you would type drop table the name of
03:44 - the table I don't want to drop this so
03:47 - I'm not going to execute the statement
03:49 - but that's how you would drop a table
03:51 - drop table the name of the table
03:54 - if you need to alter a table
03:56 - there is the alter keyword
03:58 - let's add a phone number
04:01 - alter
04:03 - table
04:05 - employees
04:07 - I'm going to write this next part of the
04:09 - statement on a new line
04:12 - what do we want to add uh what about a
04:14 - phone number
04:15 - add
04:17 - phone
04:18 - number
04:21 - then we'll need to list the data type of
04:23 - this column
04:24 - varchar is good
04:27 - Max size of 15 characters
04:31 - then we will end this statement
04:34 - execute the script all right we have
04:37 - altered our table let's take a look at
04:39 - our table select asterisk asterisk means
04:43 - all I don't know if I explained that
04:44 - select all
04:45 - from
04:47 - employees
04:49 - we have employee ID first name last name
04:51 - hourly pay higher date
04:54 - then our column phone number
04:56 - let's rename phone number and change it
04:58 - to something else
05:00 - we will again use the altar keyword
05:02 - alter
05:04 - table
05:05 - employees
05:08 - rename column
05:13 - phone number
05:15 - to let's say email
05:22 - okay then let's take a look again select
05:24 - all from employees
05:29 - yeah employee ID first name last name
05:31 - hourly pay higher date then email
05:33 - however the data type has not changed
05:36 - for email
05:37 - I'm going to refresh my schemas then
05:39 - underneath information underneath
05:41 - employees our email column has a max
05:44 - size of 15 characters let's change that
05:48 - alter
05:49 - table
05:51 - employees
05:54 - modify
05:56 - column
05:58 - email then the new data type varchar
06:04 - maybe 100 characters for an email
06:08 - let's execute this statement
06:11 - refresh our schemas yeah now our email
06:14 - column has a size of 100 characters
06:17 - maybe we need to change the position of
06:19 - our email column if you need to move
06:22 - columns around this is how you can do so
06:24 - let's move our email column so it's
06:26 - after our last name column
06:29 - to do that we would type alter table the
06:32 - name of the table
06:34 - modify the name of the column to be
06:37 - moved email in this case
06:39 - then the data type
06:43 - this email column has a data type of
06:45 - varchar 100
06:47 - then after then the name of the column
06:50 - we would like our email column to follow
06:52 - I need my email column to come after my
06:56 - last name column I will type after
06:59 - last name
07:01 - then afterwards I might as well just
07:03 - display everything select all from
07:05 - employees you can write more than one
07:08 - SQL statement
07:10 - here we are employee ID first name last
07:13 - name email hourly pay higher date
07:16 - if you're modifying a column and need it
07:18 - to be first
07:19 - you could just say
07:21 - first
07:25 - email employee ID first name last name
07:27 - hourly pay higher date you can use the
07:30 - after keyword then a column or first if
07:33 - you need the column to be first
07:35 - now to drop a column you would type
07:37 - alter table employees
07:41 - drop
07:44 - column
07:45 - the name of the column to be dropped
07:47 - email
07:49 - our email column is no longer there
07:52 - alright everybody that's how we can
07:54 - create a table and work with the columns
07:56 - in the next video we're either going to
07:59 - talk about data types or learn about
08:01 - inserting rows into our tables I haven't
08:03 - decided yet but we'll probably cover one
08:06 - of those two
