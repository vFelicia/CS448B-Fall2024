00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
00:02 - hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to show you
00:04 - all how we can convert a python file to
00:06 - an executable
00:07 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - here's a quick disclaimer before we
00:14 - begin windows defender
00:16 - and other anti-virus programs may
00:18 - prevent your executable from running but
00:20 - if you head to the settings section
00:21 - of your anti-virus you can disable that
00:23 - so that your python file can run
00:26 - also please be sure that pip and pi
00:28 - installer are both installed and up to
00:30 - date
00:30 - i have a separate video on that if
00:32 - you're interested now the program that
00:34 - i'm going to be converting to an
00:35 - executable has a gui portion to it i
00:38 - created a clock program in a previous
00:40 - video so i'm going to turn
00:42 - this clock program into an executable
00:44 - now i recommend
00:45 - creating a new folder on your desktop
00:47 - just because this process is normally
00:49 - somewhat messy so we'll create a folder
00:51 - to contain it all
00:52 - now copy any relevant python files and
00:55 - or images and paste them to within
00:57 - this folder if you have an image that
00:59 - you would like to set as an icon for
01:00 - your executable
01:01 - i recommend moving that to the same
01:03 - folder as well our next step is to open
01:05 - command prompt
01:07 - and we need to change the directory of
01:09 - command prompt so that it's pointing to
01:11 - that folder that contains our python
01:13 - file
01:14 - so on your python file right click on it
01:16 - go to properties and copy
01:18 - this location and in command prompt to
01:21 - change directory type
01:22 - cd space and then paste that location
01:25 - now here's the cheat code to convert
01:27 - a python file to an executable make sure
01:30 - that pi installer and pip
01:31 - are installed and both up to date so
01:33 - type pi
01:35 - installer dash capital f to make
01:39 - all of this one file if you need the
01:41 - terminal window
01:43 - in your program then omit this next part
01:45 - since i'm running a gui application i do
01:47 - not need that terminal window
01:49 - so to remove that window type dash w
01:53 - if you have an icon that you want to set
01:55 - type dash
01:56 - i and the name of your icon however it
02:00 - should be an ico file
02:01 - so if you have some other image that you
02:03 - would like to convert to an ico file
02:06 - here's how if you need to convert an
02:08 - image to an
02:09 - ico file you can just google convert to
02:11 - ico but one website that i commonly use
02:14 - is icoconvert.com just pick a file to
02:18 - upload
02:18 - so choose file i'm going to convert this
02:21 - png file of an alarm clock
02:24 - upload it there's a bunch of different
02:26 - settings you can use
02:28 - convert ico and then download my icon
02:31 - and once your ico file is downloaded i
02:34 - will drag and drop it to my folder
02:36 - and i will rename this let's rename this
02:38 - as
02:39 - icon dot ico and here's that cheat code
02:42 - one more time
02:43 - pi installer dash f dash w
02:46 - if you do not need the terminal window
02:49 - dash i if you would like to add an icon
02:51 - the name of your icon it should be an
02:53 - ico file followed by
02:55 - the name of the python file and mine is
02:57 - named
02:58 - clock.p.y then hit enter
03:06 - all right looks like building our
03:08 - executable has completed successfully so
03:11 - open that folder back up your executable
03:13 - is located within
03:14 - this dist folder i would recommend just
03:17 - dragging and dropping it to your desktop
03:19 - and we can get rid of this old folder
03:23 - but close out a command prompt and by
03:26 - clicking on this executable
03:27 - this executable will now run my python
03:30 - program
03:30 - well everyone that is how to convert a
03:33 - python file to an exe file i will post
03:36 - my notes to the comment section down
03:37 - below
03:38 - and well yeah that's how to convert a
03:40 - python file to an executable
