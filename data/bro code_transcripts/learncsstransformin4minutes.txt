00:02 - hey uh here's a few transformations that
00:04 - you may be interested in let's begin by
00:06 - creating a simple box i'll use a div
00:09 - element and assign this a unique id of
00:11 - box one and within this box we'll say hi
00:15 - within my style sheet i will select box
00:18 - one i'll give this a border of
00:21 - 4 pixels solid
00:23 - a width
00:25 - of 250 pixels
00:27 - and a height of 250 pixels as well
00:31 - let's change the font size to something
00:33 - larger like 225 pixels we will change
00:37 - the text alignment
00:39 - to center
00:41 - and change the background to pick a
00:43 - color that you like
00:47 - to work with transformations there is a
00:49 - transform property
00:51 - and you can select a transformation that
00:53 - you like
00:54 - let's begin with translate x you pass in
00:57 - an amount of pixels to translate your
01:00 - element on the x-axis
01:02 - if i set this to 50 pixels
01:04 - this element will be translated to the
01:06 - right by 50 pixels or a negative number
01:09 - for a left translation okay let's select
01:13 - translate y
01:15 - and do the same thing
01:17 - this transformation moves elements up or
01:19 - down on the y axis
01:21 - or you could combine them both
01:24 - and that is just simply translate but
01:26 - you pass in two numbers between the
01:28 - parentheses
01:31 - so this combines both an x and y
01:34 - translation
01:35 - we can rotate on the x-axis you pass in
01:38 - an angle like 180 degrees
01:45 - so that is a rotation on the x-axis
01:49 - there is also a y-axis rotation
01:53 - and a z-axis rotation
01:57 - we can scale on the x-axis scale x
02:02 - one is the default
02:03 - two means two hundred percent so this
02:06 - image will stretch twice as wide
02:08 - or three times as wide
02:11 - there is scale y
02:14 - and that will stretch on the y axis
02:17 - or you could combine them both with
02:19 - simply scale
02:23 - if i set both of these values to 2 our
02:25 - image is twice as big we can skew on a
02:28 - given axis
02:31 - skew x and then pass in an amount of
02:33 - degrees
02:34 - like 45 degrees
02:38 - we can skew on the y axis
02:41 - or we can do both
02:42 - pass in two values within skew
02:46 - let's say 20 degrees for both
02:49 - there's also matrix matrix is a little
02:52 - more complex
02:53 - there are six values that we can pass in
02:56 - and they start in this order the first
02:58 - value is for scale x the second is for
03:01 - skew y
03:02 - skew x
03:04 - scale y
03:06 - translate x and translate y the first
03:09 - number is for scale x and the fourth
03:11 - numbers for scale y so i'm going to set
03:13 - this to 1 for 100
03:15 - so if these are both zero or at least
03:18 - one of them is zero then this image is
03:20 - going to disappear so matrix combines
03:22 - the following scale x skew y skew x
03:26 - scale y translate x translate y
03:29 - so using matrix you can add more than
03:31 - one transformation let's say i need this
03:34 - scaled twice as big
03:36 - and translated
03:39 - uh let's make that a little more drastic
03:41 - maybe 250
03:43 - or i could skew this too so yeah those
03:46 - are some simple transformations whatever
03:49 - you would like translated just place
03:50 - this property within an element and you
03:53 - can select one of these based on what
03:54 - you need so yeah those are some simple
