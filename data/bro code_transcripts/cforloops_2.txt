00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:01 - bro hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video i'm going to explain
00:04 - for loops in c-sharp so sit back relax
00:08 - and enjoy the show
00:11 - okay for loops a for loop will repeat
00:14 - some code a
00:16 - finite amount of times unlike with while
00:18 - loops a while loop will execute
00:20 - an infinite amount of times as long as
00:23 - its condition remains true
00:24 - for loops are limited so let's create a
00:27 - for loop to
00:28 - i don't know count a ton so let's create
00:30 - a for loop by typing four
00:32 - parentheses curly braces and within the
00:35 - for loop the parenthesis of the for loop
00:37 - there's three separate statements we're
00:39 - going to fill in the first
00:41 - is that we need some sort of counter or
00:43 - index to keep track of which iteration
00:45 - we're on within the for loop
00:47 - so let's declare an index int index
00:50 - and i will assign 0 to begin with so
00:53 - people usually just shorten
00:54 - index to simply i for short so that is
00:58 - the first statement
00:59 - the second statement is our condition
01:02 - when do we want to stop
01:03 - so let's stop when i is greater than or
01:07 - equal to
01:08 - 10. so we'll just say i is less than
01:11 - 10. so it's kind of like we'll continue
01:13 - this for loop as long as i
01:15 - is less than 10 and once we hit 10 we'll
01:18 - stop
01:19 - and then the third statement is how much
01:21 - do we want to
01:22 - increment or decrement our index by so
01:25 - you can write i
01:26 - plus equals one to increment by one or
01:29 - another variation is just
01:30 - i plus plus so after each iteration
01:33 - we'll increment i
01:34 - our counter our index by one and during
01:37 - each iteration
01:38 - let's display whatever i is so after
01:41 - running this code
01:42 - we will execute this for loop ten times
01:45 - and we will count the numbers
01:47 - zero through nine so if we want one
01:49 - through ten we can change our index
01:51 - to one into i equals one and we will
01:54 - continue this for loop as long as i
01:57 - is less than or equal to ten and then
02:00 - our for loop will execute a total of ten
02:03 - times and count the numbers
02:04 - one through ten and you can also skip
02:07 - iterations too
02:08 - like we can increment our index i by two
02:11 - i plus equals two
02:16 - now this for loop is going to execute
02:18 - five times we're incrementing our index
02:21 - by two during each iteration
02:23 - let's change this to three i plus equals
02:26 - three
02:28 - and this will execute four times one
02:30 - four seven
02:31 - ten okay let's do something a little bit
02:33 - different let's count down let's pretend
02:35 - that we're counting down to a new year
02:38 - so we'll start at 10 and count down to
02:40 - one then display happy new year
02:42 - so four parentheses curly braces
02:46 - we'll set index i to equal 10 to begin
02:49 - with
02:50 - we'll continue this as long as i is
02:52 - greater than
02:53 - zero then we will decrement i by one
02:57 - during each iteration
02:58 - so you can use minus minus or minus
03:00 - equals one
03:01 - either variation works okay so after
03:04 - each iteration
03:05 - we will display i then when we exit our
03:08 - for loop
03:09 - we will display happy new year within a
03:11 - rightline statement
03:12 - so happy new year
03:16 - let's try it okay 10 9 8 7
03:19 - 6 5 4 3 2 1 happy new year
03:23 - so everybody those are for loops they
03:25 - will repeat
03:26 - some code a finite amount of times
03:29 - unlike with a while loop a while loop
03:31 - will execute
03:32 - some code infinitely as long as its
03:34 - condition remains true
03:35 - a for loop is limited in that regard
03:38 - well
03:38 - everybody those are for loops if you can
03:41 - give this video a big fat thumbs up
03:43 - drop a random comment down below and
03:45 - well those are for loops
03:47 - in c sharp
