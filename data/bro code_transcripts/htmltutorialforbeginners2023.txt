00:00 - hey how's it going everybody in this
00:01 - series I'm going to show you everything
00:03 - you need to know to get started working
00:05 - with HTML then a little bit later on
00:07 - we'll cover CSS so why don't you go
00:09 - ahead and sit back relax and enjoy the
00:12 - show
00:14 - hey if you enjoy my videos please be
00:16 - sure to subscribe because subscribing is
00:18 - free just like how this video is free
00:21 - help me out yes I'm guilt tripping you
00:23 - that is all why should you learn HTML in
00:26 - today's age people spend way too much
00:28 - time on the internet myself included
00:30 - unfortunately knowing how to create or
00:33 - otherwise manage a website isn't a bad
00:36 - thing to know heck add it to your resume
00:38 - it really can't hurt even if you're not
00:40 - interested in web development as a
00:42 - career almost every business has some
00:45 - sort of online presence knowing how to
00:47 - manage that online presence could
00:49 - convince a potential employer to hire
00:52 - you over somebody else so why not HTML
00:55 - is an acronym for hypertext markup
00:57 - language the general idea is that
00:59 - certain types of tags also known as
01:01 - markup is used to convey to a web
01:04 - browser how some content should be
01:06 - displayed usually tags are in pairs with
01:09 - some content sandwiched between them
01:11 - header tags are typically used for
01:14 - titles
01:14 - P tags are used for paragraphs of text a
01:18 - tags are used for hyperlinks HTML adds
01:20 - structure to a web page if we were
01:22 - building a house you could say that HTML
01:25 - is the foundation the skeletal structure
01:28 - to support all content on a website then
01:31 - their CSS CSS means cascading style
01:34 - sheets it's a language that adds style
01:36 - to a web page in our house analogy CSS
01:39 - would be equivalent to the decorations
01:42 - design and colors of the Interior to
01:45 - begin working with HTML and CSS you'll
01:48 - need a modern web browser you can use
01:50 - Google Chrome Firefox Microsoft Edge
01:53 - Safari those are all fine you'll also
01:55 - need a text editor as well such as vs
01:58 - code it's free software that functions
02:00 - as a workbench for us to write code in
02:03 - this next part I'll show you how we can
02:05 - download and install vs code
02:07 - to download vs code head to this website
02:09 - code.visualstudio.com
02:12 - look for whatever operating system
02:14 - you're using and download that version
02:16 - I'm running Windows I will download the
02:18 - windows version
02:20 - then I will open it when it's done
02:22 - accept the agreement
02:24 - yes I did read it that fast
02:27 - next
02:29 - I'll create a desktop icon next install
02:34 - launch Visual Studio code and finish
02:38 - we need a folder to hold all of the
02:40 - documents related to our website go to
02:42 - Open folder I'll place this folder on my
02:45 - desktop
02:46 - new folder I'll name this folder website
02:51 - select folder
02:53 - there we go we are now within our
02:55 - website folder I'm going to create a new
02:58 - file
02:59 - I will name this file index.html
03:03 - whatever your home page is going to be I
03:05 - would recommend naming it index.html
03:08 - most servers return the index file as
03:11 - the home page so it would be good
03:13 - practice for us to name the home page
03:15 - index
03:16 - now what we're going to do is install
03:17 - the live server extension
03:20 - go to extensions look up live server
03:24 - and install
03:26 - basically what this does is that when
03:28 - you update your HTML file if you have a
03:30 - web browser open it's going to update
03:32 - automatically it'll save you some time
03:35 - all right everybody now what we're gonna
03:36 - do is fill in our HTML file at the top
03:39 - what we'll do is add a set of angle
03:41 - brackets then type this exclamation
03:43 - point doc type HTML this is a
03:48 - declaration that this document is an
03:51 - HTML5 document which is the most recent
03:53 - version then we'll create a pair of HTML
03:56 - tags we'll need an opening HTML tag
04:00 - and an ending HTML tag you can tell that
04:03 - this is an ending tag because it has a
04:05 - forward slash most tags are in groups of
04:07 - pairs that's if there's typically
04:09 - content between them this pair of HTML
04:12 - tags represents the root element of an
04:15 - HTML page between these two tags we will
04:18 - add a pair of head tags
04:25 - the head element contains information
04:26 - about your web page such as a title
04:29 - let's add a title to our web page title
04:34 - add a closing tag let's set the title of
04:37 - our web page to be
04:38 - my first website
04:41 - now what we'll do right click on your
04:43 - HTML file then open with live server
04:48 - here's our webpage the title says my
04:51 - first website just to make this easier
04:53 - on us I'm going to place our web page
04:55 - side by side with vs code
05:03 - when we save any changes we can see that
05:05 - update automatically the head element
05:07 - contains information about your web page
05:10 - whereas in the body let's add a pair of
05:13 - body tags after the pair of head tags
05:18 - the body element contains visible
05:20 - content in your web page
05:22 - between our body tags let's add a pair
05:25 - of H1 header tags
05:30 - H1 defines a large heading I'll add some
05:33 - text
05:35 - this is
05:37 - an H1 heading I'm going to save that
05:41 - should update my HTML document
05:42 - automatically this is an H1 heading
05:45 - let's try H2
05:48 - add a pair of H2 header tags
05:51 - this is an H2 heading
05:55 - let's do H3
05:58 - H3
05:59 - this is an H3 heading
06:02 - H4
06:07 - this is an H4 heading then we have H5
06:13 - this is an H5 heading typically header
06:16 - tags are used for titles or other large
06:18 - text
06:19 - let's discuss paragraph tags if you have
06:22 - a paragraph of text you can place that
06:24 - within a pair of P tags
06:28 - thumb text goes here if you need some
06:31 - sample text to work with if you're using
06:33 - vs code you can type lorem then tab this
06:37 - will create some garbage text for you I
06:40 - think it's supposed to resemble Latin
06:42 - if I were to copy everything within the
06:44 - set of paragraph tags
06:45 - then save it
06:47 - paragraphs are separated with a line
06:49 - break
06:50 - otherwise if you do need a line break
06:52 - you can type BR meaning line break so
06:56 - this is a self-closing tag
06:58 - pairs of tags usually have some sort of
07:01 - content between them with the line break
07:03 - that's a self-closing tag we don't need
07:06 - a closing tag
07:07 - so add as many line breaks as you need
07:09 - wherever you need them so that's a line
07:11 - break
07:13 - there's also a horizontal rule which is
07:15 - HR think Human Resources HR that would
07:19 - add a horizontal line across your page
07:21 - that might look pretty good after a
07:23 - title
07:24 - paragraph tags don't care about any
07:26 - spaces or new lines
07:28 - I'm going to put all of this on separate
07:30 - lines just so it's more legible
07:35 - so when I save nothing appears to happen
07:38 - even if I were to add some line breaks
07:40 - between these sentences
07:42 - nothing appears to change you could
07:44 - always change your paragraph tags to pre
07:48 - meaning pre-formatted as in
07:50 - pre-formatted text
07:52 - that would retain any line breaks or
07:54 - spaces Within These tags it's up to you
07:57 - if you prefer the P tags or the pre-tags
08:00 - now the last thing I'm going to discuss
08:02 - are comments comments aren't displayed
08:04 - as output they're usually used as notes
08:07 - for yourself or for other developers you
08:10 - would type a left angle bracket
08:12 - exclamation point two dashes
08:14 - wherever your comment ends you would
08:17 - type two dashes right angle bracket this
08:20 - is a comment so when I save nothing
08:24 - appears to happen comments are used for
08:26 - yourself or for other developers that
08:28 - are looking over this document alright
08:30 - everybody well at this time let's go
08:31 - over an exercise just so that we have a
08:33 - solid foundation and really remember
08:35 - everything it'd be good practice for us
08:38 - we're going to create a separate HTML
08:40 - file that displays the lyrics of a song
08:43 - you like so let's create a new HTML file
08:46 - let's name this file lyrics dot HTML
08:51 - again we'll need to add this declaration
08:55 - doc type HTML that's a declaration that
09:00 - this document is an HTML5 document then
09:03 - we'll need a pair of HTML tags
09:07 - we'll need a head element
09:13 - and a body
09:18 - let's add a title to the head of our
09:20 - document
09:22 - title
09:24 - let's set the title to be my song lyrics
09:28 - then we will open this HTML file with
09:31 - live server
09:33 - my song lyrics pick a song that you like
09:37 - within our body tags let's add an H1
09:40 - element this will be the title copy the
09:43 - name of your song
09:45 - place it within this pair of tags
09:48 - so that's the title add song by the name
09:52 - of the band or artist I'll use H3 header
09:56 - tags
09:57 - that's slightly smaller than H1
10:02 - you know maybe H4 I think that'd be
10:04 - better
10:06 - I'll add a horizontal rule that's HR
10:11 - I'll add a pair of P tags
10:15 - take all of these lyrics copy them
10:19 - and paste them within the pair of P tags
10:23 - I'd like to retain the spacing let's
10:25 - change the P tags to pre tags for
10:29 - pre-formatted text
10:31 - that's much better let's add one line
10:34 - break
10:36 - after our horizontal rule
10:38 - one last thing I'm going to do within
10:40 - the pre-tags I'm going to add some blank
10:42 - lines between some of these verses
10:49 - there we go that's pretty cool I think
10:51 - we have the hang of basic HTML now in
10:54 - the next topic we'll discuss hyperlinks
