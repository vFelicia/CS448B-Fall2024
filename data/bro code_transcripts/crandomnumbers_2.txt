00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
00:01 - hope you're doing well and in this video
00:03 - i'm going to explain how we can generate
00:04 - some random numbers in c
00:06 - sharp so sit back relax and enjoy the
00:09 - show
00:11 - all right people here's how to generate
00:13 - some random numbers
00:14 - just so you know these are not true
00:16 - random numbers but rather
00:18 - pseudo-random numbers and they're fairly
00:19 - darn close so to create some random
00:22 - numbers
00:22 - we'll need to instantiate a random
00:24 - object type random with an uppercase r
00:27 - random with lowercase r equals new
00:30 - random parentheses semicolon
00:33 - so the name of our random object is
00:35 - random really you couldn't name this
00:36 - anything but i usually just call it
00:38 - random
00:39 - and we can use this object to generate
00:41 - random numbers and there's a few
00:42 - built-in methods of this random object
00:44 - to access them add a dot and we'll focus
00:47 - on
00:48 - the next method and next double method
00:51 - next we'll generate a random whole
00:52 - integer so we'll want to specify a range
00:55 - this by itself will generate a random
00:57 - number between i believe
00:59 - zero and just over two billion so we'll
01:01 - probably want to set a range
01:03 - let's pretend that we're rolling a six
01:05 - sided dice i need a random number
01:07 - between
01:07 - one and six so i can set that range
01:10 - within the parentheses
01:11 - so the minimum would be 1 comma and the
01:14 - max would be
01:15 - technically 7 because the second number
01:17 - is going to be exclusive
01:19 - so this will give us a random number
01:21 - between 1 and
01:22 - 6. just specify the range and we'll
01:25 - store this within a variable
01:26 - int num equals random.next a random
01:30 - number between
01:30 - one and a six all right then let's
01:33 - display this
01:35 - console.writeline num and we should have
01:37 - a random number between
01:39 - one and six
01:42 - and we got six all right then you can
01:45 - always make adjustments to this too like
01:46 - you can add i don't know 100
01:49 - and that should give us a number between
01:51 - 101 and 106.
01:53 - so that's always an option too okay now
01:56 - what if you need to roll a 20-sided dice
01:58 - like we're playing dungeons and dragons
02:00 - we use polyhedral dice so that would be
02:03 - 1
02:03 - comma 21 and this will give us a random
02:06 - number between
02:07 - 1 and 20 and we rolled an 8.
02:10 - now there is a next double method which
02:13 - will generate a random decimal number
02:15 - so let's say double num equals random
02:19 - dot next double
02:23 - and the random number will be between
02:25 - zero and
02:26 - one so we have 0.7016 something
02:31 - something something something
02:32 - so if you need a random decimal or
02:35 - random double number
02:36 - you can use random.next double otherwise
02:39 - if you need a random whole integer
02:41 - you're better off using the next method
02:44 - of random
02:45 - now if you need let's say three random
02:46 - numbers we can keep on reusing the same
02:48 - random object we only need to
02:50 - instantiate it once
02:51 - let's say we're going to roll three dice
02:54 - so three
02:55 - six sided dice let's copy what we have
02:57 - and paste it twice
02:59 - so we have num1 num2 num3
03:03 - then let's display these
03:04 - console.writeline num1
03:07 - num2 and num3
03:10 - so we will have 3 random numbers and the
03:14 - result is
03:15 - 3 6 and 4. well okay then everybody that
03:18 - is how to
03:19 - generate random numbers in c sharp i
03:22 - will post this code to the comment
03:23 - section down below
03:24 - if you can give this video a thumbs up
03:26 - drop a random comment down below
03:28 - and well that's how to generate random
03:30 - numbers in c sharp
