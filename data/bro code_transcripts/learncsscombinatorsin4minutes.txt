00:00 - hey what's going on everybody today
00:01 - we're going to discuss combinators in
00:03 - CSS combinators explain the relationship
00:06 - between listed selectors there's four
00:09 - we'll discuss today descendants which is
00:12 - just a space a child which is a right
00:14 - angle bracket a tilde which is a general
00:17 - sibling and plus which is for adjacent
00:20 - siblings you would type something like
00:22 - this
00:23 - you'll have selector one a combinator
00:26 - for example the child combinator then
00:29 - another selector
00:31 - if I said div
00:33 - child combinator
00:35 - then p
00:36 - we're applying CSS properties to any
00:39 - paragraph elements found within the
00:41 - stiff section
00:43 - what we'll do in this example is create
00:45 - a div section
00:49 - I will give this div an ID of container
00:55 - we'll create a few paragraphs
00:59 - for paragraph one let's say this is
01:02 - number one
01:04 - we'll create another paragraph
01:07 - then we'll create an inner div section
01:11 - this div section will not have an ID
01:14 - but within this inner div section we'll
01:16 - have another paragraph This is number
01:19 - three
01:20 - outside of our div with an ID of
01:22 - container
01:23 - we'll create two more paragraphs this is
01:26 - number four
01:27 - this is number five
01:29 - that's all we'll need for now
01:32 - just to make it a little more clear that
01:34 - this is a div section I'll take our
01:36 - container
01:38 - then give it a border border two pixels
01:43 - solid
01:45 - paragraphs one two and three are within
01:47 - a div section four and five are not
01:50 - I would like to highlight all paragraphs
01:52 - within my ID of container
01:55 - I will take my ID of container
01:59 - then I will use the descendant
02:01 - combinator which is an empty space then
02:04 - list another selector I'm going to
02:06 - highlight all paragraphs within my div
02:08 - section that would be my div section
02:11 - space then what am I applying CSS
02:14 - properties to my paragraphs
02:17 - let's take the background color and set
02:21 - that to be yellow
02:24 - something like that's fine
02:26 - all paragraph descendants of our
02:29 - container change the background color to
02:31 - Yellow
02:33 - that is The Descendant combinator it's
02:35 - just an empty space
02:37 - then you have children children is a
02:40 - right angle bracket
02:43 - highlight any paragraph children of our
02:46 - container class only one and two are
02:49 - highlighted
02:50 - that's because three is not technically
02:53 - a child it's a descendant
02:56 - think of it like a grandchild in this
02:58 - case
02:58 - paragraphs one and two are direct
03:00 - children of our container
03:02 - but our third paragraph is One More
03:05 - Level deep because it's wrapped within
03:07 - another div section it's a descendant
03:09 - but not a child all children are
03:12 - descendants but not all descendants are
03:14 - children that would apply to number
03:16 - three that's why only one and two are
03:18 - highlighted that is the child combinator
03:22 - then we have General sibling which is
03:25 - represented with a tilde
03:28 - take any paragraphs that are General
03:31 - siblings of our container that would
03:34 - highlight four and five
03:36 - paragraphs four and five are both
03:39 - siblings to our container
03:42 - they're both considered Children of the
03:44 - body of my document therefore their
03:46 - siblings like brothers and sisters but
03:50 - if I were to wrap these two paragraphs
03:52 - within a div section
03:55 - foreign
03:58 - well now they're no longer siblings
04:01 - this div section is now a sibling to
04:04 - this first div section think of it this
04:06 - way paragraphs four and five are nieces
04:08 - and nephews to the First Development
04:12 - all right let's reverse that
04:14 - then we have adjacent siblings
04:17 - using a plus sign
04:19 - we will select only adjacent siblings
04:23 - four is selected but not five
04:26 - the adjacent sibling is the next direct
04:29 - sibling but not all siblings
04:32 - that's why four is selected and not five
04:34 - but if I change their positions around
04:38 - 5 is now selected
04:41 - alright everybody so those are
04:43 - combinators they explain the
04:44 - relationship between listed selectors
04:46 - you have descendant child General
04:49 - sibling and adjacent sibling and those
04:52 - are combinators in CSS
