00:00 - hey everybody Welcome to the wonderful
00:02 - world of cookies a cookie if you don't
00:04 - know basically speaking it's information
00:07 - about a user stored in a user's web
00:09 - browser that's why you might receive
00:12 - targeted advertisements platforms such
00:14 - as YouTube they might remember your
00:16 - browsing preferences and you can store
00:18 - other non-sensitive data now to create a
00:21 - cookie in PHP we will use the set cookie
00:24 - function it's actually pretty simple our
00:27 - cookies are stored as an associative
00:29 - array first is the key our key will be
00:32 - favorite food the second element is the
00:35 - value
00:36 - my favorite food will be Pizza
00:40 - the third argument is an expiration time
00:42 - cookies typically expire after a certain
00:45 - amount of time to set the time we can
00:47 - use the time function then add this is
00:51 - in seconds for one day that would be 86
00:54 - 400 seconds
00:57 - if you need your cookie to expire after
00:59 - two days we can just multiply this by
01:01 - two
01:02 - then let me enclose these within
01:03 - parentheses just for clarity
01:06 - then the next argument is the file path
01:09 - I'll use a forward slash for the default
01:11 - file path
01:13 - and there we are so I'm going to save
01:15 - this
01:16 - now if we open up our web browser
01:20 - I'm going to right click go to inspect
01:23 - you can find your cookies underneath
01:25 - application
01:27 - then go to cookies underneath storage oh
01:30 - look at that we have a cookie
01:31 - the key is favorite food
01:34 - the value is pizza
01:36 - and there is an expiration date here too
01:39 - there it is
01:41 - let's add a few more cookies
01:46 - set cookie favorite drink
01:50 - I will set the value to be coffee
01:54 - this cookie will expire after three days
01:58 - there's our next cookie one more
02:04 - favorite dessert
02:07 - I will pick ice cream
02:11 - this cookie will expire after four days
02:14 - so 86 400 times 4.
02:18 - there we have three cookies
02:22 - favorite dessert favorite drink favorite
02:24 - food
02:25 - now to delete a cookie all you have to
02:28 - do is set the time to minus zero
02:31 - so let's do that for all of these
02:37 - yeah look at that the cookies are gone
02:39 - now
02:41 - let's revert that back
02:44 - and we have cookies again
02:46 - let's print each key value pair from all
02:49 - of our cookies
02:51 - I will use a for each Loop
02:55 - we are accessing the cookie super Global
02:59 - variable our cookies are stored as key
03:02 - value pairs
03:04 - using a for each Loop we can write as
03:07 - key
03:08 - Arrow value
03:13 - I will Echo each key value pair
03:18 - key
03:20 - equals
03:23 - value
03:25 - then a break
03:29 - here are the three cookies we set
03:31 - favorite food equals Pizza favorite
03:33 - drink equals coffee favorite dessert
03:36 - equals ice cream
03:37 - to access one of the values you would
03:40 - need the key maybe I will display an
03:42 - advertisement based on somebody's
03:44 - favorite food maybe we remember what
03:46 - their favorite food is
03:48 - I will use the is set function
03:51 - is set
03:54 - place it within an if statement we will
03:56 - check within our cookies
04:01 - add the key of favorite
04:04 - food
