00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
00:02 - hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to explain
00:04 - the basics of class variables in python
00:07 - so
00:07 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - if you wouldn't mind please like comment
00:15 - and subscribe one like
00:16 - equals one prayer for the youtube
00:18 - algorithm
00:19 - here's a super quick video on the
00:21 - differences between class and instance
00:23 - variables
00:24 - for this example let's say we have two
00:26 - car objects
00:27 - named car 1 and car 2 and i'm just
00:30 - passing in a bunch of values to each of
00:32 - these car constructors
00:33 - now within my class car i have my init
00:36 - method
00:36 - also known as the constructor and what
00:38 - i'm doing is assigning all of these
00:40 - values
00:41 - to the variables found within my car
00:43 - constructor
00:44 - these variables declared inside the
00:46 - constructor
00:47 - are known as instance variables and each
00:50 - object
00:51 - can have their own unique values
00:53 - assigned to each of these variables
00:55 - now where a class variable is different
00:57 - is that a class variable
00:59 - is declared inside the class but outside
01:02 - of the constructor
01:03 - and what we can do is set some default
01:05 - values for some variables
01:07 - let's say we would like to add an
01:08 - additional variable let's say wheels
01:10 - wheels equals and we can set a default
01:13 - value
01:14 - for all instances of this class for each
01:16 - car object that we create
01:18 - so we set wheels to equal four this is
01:20 - an example of a class
01:22 - variable whenever we create a car object
01:25 - we can pass
01:26 - in a unique make model year in color but
01:28 - by default
01:29 - they will all have four wheels now if i
01:32 - was to print
01:33 - the amount of wheels that car 1 and car
01:36 - 2 have
01:36 - they will both have 4 wheels it's as if
01:39 - we're setting a default value
01:41 - if i change this to two wheels well then
01:44 - these cars have two wheels
01:45 - maybe they're motorcycles or something
01:47 - now you can actually
01:48 - change these values each object will
01:50 - have their own
01:51 - copy of this variable but you can set it
01:53 - to a default value
01:55 - so let's say car one
01:58 - is a motorcycle car one dot wheels
02:01 - equals two so if i were to print car
02:04 - ones wheels along with car two
02:06 - car one will have 2 wheels but car 2
02:09 - is still using that default amount of
02:11 - wheels which is 4.
02:13 - now there's another way in which you can
02:14 - access a class variable
02:16 - you don't necessarily need to create an
02:18 - object to do so you can just use the
02:20 - name of the class
02:21 - so what i'm going to do is turn all of
02:23 - these lines into comments
02:25 - and i will print the amount of wheels
02:28 - that our class has so type in the name
02:31 - of the class
02:32 - car with a capital c it should be the
02:34 - same name as your class name
02:36 - followed by the name of the class
02:37 - variable car
02:39 - dot wheels but make sure you spell it
02:41 - right
02:42 - all right so this will display for
02:44 - wheels
02:45 - now what if we decide to change the
02:47 - class variable
02:48 - through our class well that will affect
02:51 - all
02:52 - instances of our class so let's say car
02:55 - dot wheels equals two it's as if we
02:59 - change our mind and we have decided to
03:01 - create motorcycles instead of cars
03:03 - well if we were to change the wheels
03:06 - class variable through the use of our
03:08 - car class
03:09 - well then it's going to affect it for
03:11 - all instances of this class
03:13 - you can see that both car 1 and car 2
03:15 - now have two wheels
03:17 - when we just changed car 1's wheels it
03:19 - did not affect
03:20 - car 2 at all so that's the main
03:22 - difference between a class variable and
03:24 - an instance variable
03:25 - an instance variable is declared inside
03:28 - of constructor
03:29 - and they can be given unique values with
03:31 - class variables
03:32 - they are declared within a class but
03:34 - outside of the constructor
03:36 - and you can set a default value for all
03:38 - instances of this class
03:40 - for all unique objects that are created
03:42 - and then you can change those values
03:44 - later too
03:45 - so if you would like a copy of all this
03:46 - code i will post all of this in the
03:48 - comment section down below
03:49 - but yeah that is the basics of class
03:52 - variables
03:52 - in python
