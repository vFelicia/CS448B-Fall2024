00:00 - hello again people today I'm going to be
00:02 - explaining Wild Card characters there
00:05 - are two the percent and the underscore
00:08 - each of these is used to substitute one
00:11 - or more characters in a string here's an
00:13 - example I have a table of employees what
00:16 - if I need to find any employees whose
00:19 - first name begins with an S well you
00:22 - would think you could write something
00:23 - like this
00:24 - where first name
00:26 - is equal to s
00:29 - now this technically doesn't work here
00:32 - what we're doing is telling MySQL to
00:34 - find any first names that are equal to
00:37 - the character s if I instead need to
00:39 - find any first names that begin with the
00:42 - character S I can type S then the
00:45 - percent wildcard operator the percent
00:48 - wildcard operator represents any number
00:50 - of random characters but there's one
00:53 - more change we need to make still
00:54 - replace the equals operator with the
00:58 - like operator like when used with an
01:00 - aware Clause searches any patterns we
01:03 - will return any first names that begin
01:06 - with the letter s so the results are
01:08 - Squidward SpongeBob Sandy Sheldon their
01:11 - first names all begin with the letter s
01:14 - we could do this with dates too let's
01:16 - find any higher dates in the year 2023
01:23 - technically that would return everything
01:24 - in my example because all the higher
01:27 - dates are in 2023. we can even find if
01:29 - something ends with a character let's
01:31 - find any last names that end with the
01:35 - character r
01:36 - that would return Patrick star star with
01:40 - an r at the end you could add more than
01:42 - one character let's find any first names
01:45 - that start with SP
01:48 - then change last name to first name
01:52 - that would return one result SpongeBob
01:54 - SP on the other hand we have the
01:57 - underscore wildcard character the
02:00 - underscore wildcard character represents
02:03 - one random letter let's find any jobs
02:07 - that have one random character followed
02:10 - by oh okay
02:13 - that would return any Cooks the
02:16 - underscore kind of reminds me of that
02:17 - game Wheel of Fortune MySQL is going to
02:20 - attempt to fill in any blanks with a
02:22 - matching character if we had two
02:24 - underscores
02:25 - well there technically wouldn't be any
02:27 - matches MySQL would technically be
02:30 - looking for a five-letter word where the
02:33 - middle three characters are oh okay but
02:35 - there's no matches
02:37 - here's another example find any higher
02:40 - dates in January
02:42 - higher date is like the year is going to
02:46 - be random we have four digits one two
02:48 - three four
02:49 - a dash character zero one
02:53 - Dash then a day of the month so two
02:56 - underscores
02:57 - again that would return pretty much all
02:59 - of our employees they were all hired in
03:01 - January maybe we don't care about the
03:03 - year or the month but we care about the
03:06 - day of the month
03:08 - so let's replace the month with
03:10 - underscores
03:12 - zero two
03:15 - that would return Mr Krabs zero three
03:18 - that would be Squidward
03:21 - now you could combine these two
03:23 - different wild cards together too let's
03:25 - take a look at our jobs
03:28 - let's find any jobs where the second
03:31 - character is an a
03:33 - I know it's kind of a weird example but
03:35 - hopefully it'll make sense
03:37 - select all from employees where job is
03:41 - like now we're going to combine these
03:43 - two wild characters the second character
03:45 - has to be an a
03:47 - we could use the underscore for the
03:49 - first character a
03:51 - then any amount of random characters
03:53 - afterwards
03:55 - that would return a manager cashier or
03:58 - janitor
03:59 - so yeah those are wild card characters
04:01 - you can use these to substitute one or
04:04 - more characters in a string it's pretty
04:06 - helpful if you need to find if a string
04:08 - starts with some value or ends with some
04:11 - value and those are wild card characters
04:13 - and MySQL
