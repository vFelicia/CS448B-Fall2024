00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well and in
00:03 - this video i'm going to teach you guys
00:04 - how we can use a file dialog
00:06 - in python to open and read the contents
00:08 - of a file so sit back relax and enjoy
00:10 - the show
00:13 - if you find this video helpful please
00:15 - remember to like comment
00:17 - and subscribe your support will help
00:19 - keep this channel running
00:21 - okay people so this is how you can use
00:23 - file dialog to open and read the
00:25 - contents of a file
00:27 - but first we'll need a second import
00:29 - along with this import at the top
00:31 - so what we're going to be importing is
00:33 - from tk
00:34 - enter import file
00:38 - dialog and then we'll need a window
00:41 - like what we usually do so window equals
00:44 - tk followed by window dot
00:48 - main loop now we'll need a button that
00:50 - we're going to add to the window and
00:52 - when we click on this button
00:53 - it's going to launch our file dialog so
00:56 - we can select a file
00:57 - so we'll call this button button button
01:00 - equals button
01:01 - let's set some text maybe to just open
01:04 - like we're opening a file and we'll
01:06 - associate a function to our command
01:08 - for this button so let's create a
01:11 - function called
01:12 - open file that's fine and then we need
01:16 - to
01:16 - pack this button so we can add it to the
01:18 - screen so button.pack
01:21 - now we need to create a function called
01:23 - open file and we'll do this before we
01:25 - create our window let's type
01:26 - def open file
01:30 - and when we call this function we're
01:32 - going to
01:34 - take file dialog and use the
01:37 - ask open file name function
01:40 - so this is going to return a string
01:43 - and that string is the file path of
01:46 - where your file
01:47 - is located so what we could do is store
01:50 - this within a variable
01:52 - so let's store this within a variable
01:54 - called file path
01:55 - and to test this let's just print this
01:59 - just to take a look at the contents of
02:01 - this variable
02:02 - so let's just print the file path now i
02:05 - have a file on my desktop that i want to
02:07 - use called
02:08 - test file so let's click the open button
02:11 - and this might not necessarily bring you
02:13 - to your desktop it might bring you
02:14 - someplace else within your
02:16 - file directory so this just happens to
02:19 - be
02:19 - bring me to my desktop so i'm going to
02:21 - click the test file that i have
02:23 - and click open so this prints the
02:26 - file path so it's going to return a
02:29 - string
02:29 - and it's the file path basically so now
02:32 - we want to open
02:33 - and read the contents of this file so we
02:35 - don't really need this print line
02:37 - anymore so what we'll do
02:41 - is create a file variable and we're
02:44 - going to use
02:44 - open we're going to list the file path
02:48 - and then we're going to use r for read
02:51 - so the default is normally rt for read
02:53 - text otherwise you can read binary
02:55 - uh but we can just set this to r r is
02:58 - the same as rt basically
03:00 - uh so then we're going to open this file
03:01 - and then we're going to read it
03:03 - so let's just print this to the console
03:06 - window
03:07 - so print the name of the file which is
03:10 - file
03:11 - where this is located file dot
03:15 - read function and then it's a good idea
03:17 - to close your files
03:18 - after you're done with them so file dot
03:21 - close
03:22 - and let's test this so i'm going to
03:25 - click open
03:27 - find the file that i want click it
03:30 - and then open
03:34 - and that text file says my name is bro i
03:37 - like pizza
03:38 - now let's say you want to make this a
03:40 - little more advanced so what i'm going
03:41 - to do
03:42 - is that i'm going to set the initial
03:44 - directory of where we begin
03:46 - looking for a file when we launch our
03:48 - file dialog
03:49 - so with that test file i'm going to move
03:51 - this to my project folder so i'm just
03:52 - going to paste it
03:55 - so now this is within my project folder
03:58 - now i'm going to set the initial
04:00 - directory within the function of ask
04:03 - open file
04:04 - name so we're going to set the initial
04:07 - d i r for initial directory and then we
04:10 - can list a file path
04:12 - so one thing you could do i want to get
04:14 - this
04:15 - path here this file path so if you're
04:17 - using pycharm what you could do is right
04:19 - click this
04:20 - copy path and then get the absolute path
04:23 - and then i'm just going to paste this
04:25 - and then with these backslashes you'll
04:27 - have to do double backslashes because
04:29 - this is the escape character for a
04:32 - backslash
04:33 - all right so this should open my project
04:36 - folder
04:37 - which it does and here's that test file
04:42 - thing we could do is that we can change
04:44 - the title of our file dialog
04:46 - right now the default is just open so we
04:48 - can change that to something else
04:50 - so i'm going to add a comma maybe put
04:52 - this on a different line
04:54 - so this is still within the function of
04:56 - ask open file name
04:58 - so i'm going to set the title to
04:59 - something else i'll say
05:02 - open file
05:05 - okay so if we were to run this again
05:09 - instead of just saying open it says open
05:12 - file okay and we can also limit the
05:16 - file types that we accept and look for
05:19 - so we can use
05:20 - file types
05:24 - so let's say that we want to initially
05:26 - look for a
05:28 - txt file so what we'll do is type in
05:34 - like a name for the file that we're
05:35 - looking for so this is what's going to
05:37 - appear to
05:38 - the user uh text files followed by
05:41 - an extension so we want
05:44 - asterisk dot txt
05:48 - and then we can also have an option for
05:50 - all files
05:52 - so i'm going to add a comma for a second
05:54 - option
05:55 - and then let's say all
05:59 - files and then an extension so comma
06:04 - asterisk dot asterisk this will look for
06:07 - all files
06:08 - uh but i think i am missing a
06:10 - parenthesis
06:12 - there that should be good so then when
06:14 - we open our file dialog
06:16 - it's going to initially be looking for
06:19 - plain text files
06:20 - and with this drop down menu it says
06:22 - text files and
06:24 - all files so that's what we have listed
06:26 - within our file types of what we want to
06:28 - search for
06:29 - so you can see that if i switch to all
06:32 - files
06:33 - our python file actually appears because
06:35 - we don't have any limits on the files
06:38 - that we're trying to open or search for
06:40 - so if i change this back to text files
06:42 - only folders and
06:44 - plain text files are visible so then we
06:46 - can open our test file again
06:49 - but yeah that's the basics of file
06:51 - dialog in the next video we're going to
06:53 - be saving a file
06:55 - so if you'd like a copy of all this code
06:56 - i'll post all of this in the comments
06:58 - down below
06:59 - but yeah that's the basics of opening a
07:01 - file using python
07:03 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
07:06 - learn something new
07:07 - then you can help me help you in three
07:10 - easy steps
