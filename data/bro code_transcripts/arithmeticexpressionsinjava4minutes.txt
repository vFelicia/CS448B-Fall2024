00:00 - how's it going everybody it's you bro
00:01 - hope you're doing well and in this video
00:03 - i'm going to teach you guys about
00:04 - expressions in java so
00:06 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - you can become a hero and save our

00:17 - if you'd like to become a fellow bro
00:20 - now an expression is a combination of
00:23 - operands and
00:24 - operators an operand is the values
00:27 - variables numbers or different
00:29 - quantities that you might see
00:31 - in a program and operators they are
00:33 - those
00:34 - arithmetic symbols that you might see
00:36 - such as the plus sign for addition
00:38 - subtraction multiplication division
00:41 - and then modulus so let's go over a few
00:44 - examples
00:45 - just so that we know how they work let's
00:47 - say i have
00:48 - an integer variable called friends and i
00:51 - will set this equal to maybe 10.
00:53 - so we can change the value of the
00:56 - friends variable by using an arithmetic
00:58 - expression
00:59 - so let's say that we make a new friend
01:01 - so we're going to add one
01:02 - to my variable of friends to increment
01:05 - my variable friends i can just use the
01:07 - plus
01:07 - operator and then add a new operand to
01:10 - my variable friends
01:11 - so if i would like to assign a new value
01:13 - to my friends variable i'm going to type
01:15 - in the name of my variable
01:17 - equals friends plus one because we made
01:21 - a new friend
01:22 - and then i will print the value of
01:24 - friends so
01:25 - our friends variable now contains 11.
01:28 - so we could also subtract take a wild
01:31 - guess as to what's gonna happen
01:33 - we just lost a friend let's multiply
01:36 - uh let's multiply our friends by two and
01:39 - now we
01:40 - have 20 friends and let's divide
01:43 - we're going to divide our friends into
01:45 - two and we have five friends
01:47 - now the modulus gives you the remainder
01:49 - of division
01:50 - so we have 10 friends what if we had
01:53 - modulus 3
01:54 - well that does not divide evenly so
01:56 - we're going to have a remainder of
01:58 - one friend it's kind of like in group
02:00 - projects where everybody has to get into
02:02 - a group of three
02:03 - and there's always somebody that's left
02:04 - over think of it that way
02:06 - although if our group of friends was
02:08 - divided into groups of 2
02:11 - there would be no remainder because 10
02:13 - divided by 2
02:14 - equals 5 evenly and there is no
02:16 - remainder so that's all what the modulus
02:18 - is it gives you the remainder of any
02:20 - division that occurs
02:22 - now there is a shorthand to increment a
02:24 - variable by one
02:26 - so normally the long way of writing this
02:28 - out would be type in the name of the
02:30 - variable
02:30 - equals because we're going to reassign a
02:32 - value friends
02:34 - plus one right well there's a shorthand
02:36 - way of incrementing this
02:38 - and that is to use the increment
02:40 - operator which is just
02:41 - plus plus and then a semicolon so this
02:44 - will add one
02:45 - to a value and now we have 11 friends
02:48 - if you want to decrement that would be
02:51 - minus minus and now we have nine friends
02:55 - hold up wait a minute before you go i
02:57 - gotta discuss
02:58 - integer division because i forgot to
03:00 - talk about it so
03:01 - if we divide a number by an integer
03:04 - if there is normally a remainder well
03:07 - our program is going to truncate the
03:10 - remainder
03:11 - here's an example let's say we have 10
03:13 - friends and we're going to divide our
03:15 - friends
03:16 - by three so we're dividing by a
03:19 - whole integer so our result should be
03:21 - 3.33 repeating right
03:24 - wrong it's three that's because with
03:26 - integer division
03:27 - we truncate any decimal portion because
03:30 - we cannot store it one easy fix for that
03:33 - is we can cast our result as a double
03:36 - value or a float as well
03:38 - to cast a value as a different data type
03:41 - to the left hand side
03:42 - of our expression we're going to list
03:44 - the new data type that we would like to
03:46 - convert this value to
03:48 - so we would like to convert our integer
03:50 - as
03:51 - a double value because we would like to
03:53 - retain
03:54 - that decimal portion of our result
03:56 - however
03:57 - our data type friends is an integer so
04:00 - it cannot store a double
04:02 - data type so we should probably convert
04:04 - this to a double
04:05 - so that we can store this value and now
04:08 - this program
04:09 - will successfully store this decimal
04:12 - portion of our expression
04:14 - well that's really all you need to know
04:15 - to get started with expressions
04:17 - if you would like a copy of all this i
04:19 - will post this in the comments down
04:21 - below
04:21 - and if i could ask for a favor of you
