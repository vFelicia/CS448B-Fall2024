00:01 - sup everybody let's talk about the slice
00:04 - method the slice method extracts a
00:06 - section of a string and returns it as a
00:08 - new string without modifying the
00:11 - original string how is this useful maybe
00:13 - we have a variable full name set the
00:17 - sequel to whatever your full name is
00:20 - what i would like to do is extract
00:22 - certain portions of this full name to
00:24 - create a first name and a last name
00:27 - without changing the full name i'll
00:29 - declare two additional variables but not
00:31 - assign them yet
00:32 - first name as well as last name
00:36 - i can create an entirely new string from
00:39 - an existing string via the slice method
00:42 - let's extract this last name and assign
00:44 - it to this last name variable last name
00:48 - equals
00:49 - then type
00:50 - the original string full name
00:53 - dot slice
00:54 - within the parentheses there's up to two
00:57 - values that we can add the starting
00:59 - index and the ending index if i need my
01:02 - last name that would be at index 0 1 2 3
01:06 - 4. so 4 would be the last value if you
01:09 - don't add a second value it's assumed to
01:12 - copy everything until the end of the
01:13 - string i would like the entire rest of
01:16 - the string after index 4 and then we'll
01:18 - assign it to this new variable last name
01:21 - let's display it to test it
01:23 - console.log
01:24 - last name and this should display my
01:27 - last name yep what if i need the first
01:29 - name you can place up to two indices so
01:32 - first name equals
01:35 - type the original string full name
01:37 - dot slice
01:39 - the starting index will be zero and the
01:42 - ending index will be in my example zero
01:45 - one two three this doesn't include the
01:48 - last character all right then let's
01:50 - display my first name
01:53 - and there's my first name even though
01:55 - this does work it wouldn't be realistic
01:57 - to do this by hand manually every time
01:59 - we would like to create a first name and
02:01 - a last name from a full name right so
02:03 - why don't we use the string index of
02:05 - method to search for any spaces and
02:07 - return an index so let's try this again
02:09 - let's begin with last name
02:11 - last name equals full name
02:15 - dot slice
02:17 - and we only need one index we need the
02:19 - starting position of where to begin so
02:21 - we would like to begin where there's any
02:23 - spaces plus one so we need to begin at
02:26 - this character in my example but it
02:28 - might be different depending on what
02:29 - your full name is so i would like to
02:31 - search for any spaces and i can do that
02:34 - by taking my string full name dot and
02:37 - use the index of operator and we will
02:40 - search for the index of any spaces
02:43 - so let me hide my first name here
02:45 - oh pay attention to capitalization there
02:48 - however i need to get rid of the space
02:50 - because the first value is inclusive so
02:53 - i will add plus one
02:55 - everything after the first space
02:58 - slice it and create a new string so
03:00 - there's my last name then let's do this
03:02 - with our first name
03:03 - first
03:04 - name
03:05 - equals
03:07 - full
03:08 - name dot slice
03:10 - then we'll need two indices
03:13 - zero the beginning
03:15 - and we will end wherever there's a space
03:20 - so there's my first name and my last
03:22 - name let's try a different name just to
03:24 - be sure that it's working right how
03:26 - about snoop dogg
03:29 - yep snoop dogg alright everybody that is
03:32 - the slice method it extracts a section
03:35 - of a string and returns it as a new
03:37 - string without modifying the original
03:39 - string in our example we created a first
03:42 - name and a last name from a user's full
03:44 - name and that is the string method if
