00:00 - hey everybody here's how we can create
00:01 - and use databases in mongodb to show all
00:05 - databases type show
00:08 - DBS that will give you a list of all
00:11 - current databases I have three admin
00:13 - config and local
00:15 - to use a database type use then select a
00:18 - database name to use admin I can say use
00:21 - admin we have switched to dbadmin now if
00:25 - you use a database that doesn't exist
00:27 - let's say we will create a database for
00:29 - a school use school that's how you can
00:32 - create a database we are now within a
00:35 - new database named School however if I
00:37 - were to show my current databases my
00:40 - school database doesn't show up it's not
00:43 - visible because it's empty we'll need to
00:45 - fill it with something
00:46 - let's add a collection to our school to
00:49 - do that type DB dot we will use the
00:52 - create collection method
00:55 - this method ends with a set of
00:57 - parentheses just like a function or
00:58 - method in typical programming languages
01:00 - within the set of parentheses we are
01:03 - going to pass in an argument for a name
01:05 - for this collection let's create a
01:07 - collection of students
01:10 - and we are returned with okay we have
01:12 - created one new collection
01:15 - let's clear our screen show our
01:17 - databases again show DBS and here is our
01:20 - new database of school
01:22 - currently we are within our school
01:24 - database as you can see next to my
01:26 - cursor to drop this current database you
01:28 - can type DB dot drop
01:32 - database
01:33 - method
01:35 - and our database is dropped
01:38 - let's show our databases again
01:41 - and our school database is no longer
01:43 - there that is how to use create and drop
01:46 - a database in the mongodb Shell if you
01:49 - would like to use Compass here's how
01:53 - we have our three default databases
01:55 - admin config local to create a database
01:58 - you can click this green button
02:00 - we'll need a database name let's say
02:02 - school again
02:03 - we will create a collection of students
02:06 - within our database
02:07 - you can add additional preferences but
02:10 - we'll cover that later
02:11 - we will create our database
02:14 - and here's our database of school there
02:17 - is one collection of students but
02:18 - students doesn't have any documents yet
02:20 - which we'll cover in the next topic to
02:23 - delete a database in mongodb compass
02:25 - select a database from the sidebar then
02:28 - hit the trash can icon to delete it
02:31 - type the name of the database to drop
02:33 - the database
02:34 - so make sure that the name of the
02:35 - database is typed then drop database
02:38 - and that is how to use create and drop a
02:41 - database in mongodb compass
