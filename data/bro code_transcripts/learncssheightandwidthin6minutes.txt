00:00 - hey what's going on everybody today I'm
00:01 - going to give you an introduction to the
00:03 - width and height properties in CSS all
00:06 - right let's begin everybody we will
00:07 - Begin by creating two div elements and
00:10 - each development will have a class
00:12 - of box
00:14 - within our first box let's create an H2
00:17 - header with the text of this is number
00:19 - one
00:21 - and we'll create a paragraph underneath
00:23 - to generate some text in vs code you can
00:26 - type lorem then hit tab
00:28 - all right let's copy our div paste it
00:31 - change number one to number two and
00:33 - that's where we're at
00:35 - So within our style sheet we can set a
00:37 - height and a width for an element an ID
00:40 - or a class so let's take our box class
00:44 - dot box I'll add a border
00:47 - border 2 pixel solid just so that it's
00:49 - easier to see
00:51 - here we are okay normally with the
00:53 - height
00:54 - by default it's Auto we don't need to
00:57 - explicitly state that you can see that
00:59 - there's no apparent change when I reload
01:01 - the page
01:02 - so the height is going to be calculated
01:04 - automatically when we render our web
01:06 - page but you can set an explicit height
01:08 - for example 100 pixels
01:12 - that's a little too small our content is
01:14 - kind of overlapping let's change that to
01:16 - 200. now it's a little too big but it is
01:19 - possible to set a fixed height so let's
01:22 - set height back to auto
01:24 - now we will change the width so with the
01:27 - width we can set a number of pixels for
01:29 - example 100
01:31 - we would have two very long skinny
01:33 - columns and they're right on top of each
01:35 - other that's because divs are Block
01:37 - Level elements we'll Reserve this entire
01:40 - space for each of these developments
01:41 - because they're Block Level so let's
01:44 - change the width to 200 and see what
01:46 - happens now they're more of a box shape
01:48 - if I set width to be Auto the width will
01:51 - be calculated automatically and like I
01:53 - said that's the default these Block
01:55 - Level elements want to take up as much
01:57 - width as possible kind of like your mom
01:59 - if I changed width to be 50 the width of
02:02 - this element will take up 50 percent the
02:05 - width of our viewport but we're still
02:06 - allocating all the space for each
02:08 - development because they're Block Level
02:09 - if I were to use the float property
02:13 - let's float to the left the reason that
02:16 - these elements aren't floating there's
02:18 - still not enough space to place Box 2
02:20 - next to box one because we have our
02:22 - border our border takes up two pixels if
02:25 - I were to remove the Border they should
02:27 - display back to back which they do
02:30 - you do have to take in the width of the
02:32 - Border when calculating the width the
02:34 - same thing applies with padding
02:35 - let's apply a little bit of padding
02:38 - padding 25 pixels
02:41 - now we have 25 pixels worth of padding
02:44 - between our content and the Border I
02:47 - mean it looks nice right when
02:49 - calculating the height or the width we
02:51 - can disregard any padding or any borders
02:54 - but we have to add this property
02:57 - we'll add box Dash
02:59 - sizing
03:01 - border Dash box
03:05 - when we calculate the height or the
03:07 - width we're allocating disregard any
03:09 - padding or any borders the Box sizing
03:12 - property will take that into
03:13 - consideration we can now fit these
03:15 - elements right next to each other the
03:16 - width of each box is 50 and they both
03:19 - have borders and padding what you also
03:22 - might see with box sizing is that what
03:24 - some people like to do they'll use an
03:27 - asterisk as a selector that means all
03:28 - elements and then they'll apply the Box
03:31 - sizing property to all elements
03:34 - because well it can be kind of annoying
03:36 - to calculate width and Heights while
03:38 - factoring in padding and borders as well
03:40 - all right now if we were to float right
03:43 - box one is on the right box two is on
03:46 - the left
03:46 - let's undo that you can set a minimum
03:50 - height and a minimum width as well
03:52 - so with our two boxes let's get rid of
03:54 - our paragraphs
04:00 - I'm going to text align Center just to
04:04 - Center our text this is number one this
04:06 - is number two
04:08 - if I were to set the max width to let's
04:12 - say 25 percent
04:15 - even though we stated the width should
04:17 - be 50 the max width is going to cap that
04:20 - out at 25 percent you can see that the
04:23 - sizes of these box have shrunk
04:25 - or maybe if I set a minimum width
04:28 - of 75 percent
04:33 - we're saying that each of these boxes
04:35 - should be at least 75 percent even
04:38 - though before we declared them to be 50
04:39 - percent
04:40 - you also have Max height and Min height
04:44 - there's really going to be no change
04:45 - between the two since the height of our
04:48 - web page starts at the top here and ends
04:50 - right here we're not using all the space
04:51 - down below so what I propose is that
04:54 - let's place our boxes within a container
04:57 - we'll create another div
05:00 - with a class
05:02 - of container to contain our boxes
05:06 - let's take our two boxes
05:08 - and place them within this development
05:11 - so with my container
05:14 - the container class
05:18 - with our container let's change the
05:20 - background color
05:22 - to something great just so it's easier
05:24 - to see
05:28 - we can't see our container because our
05:30 - boxes are taking up all the space
05:33 - with our container if we need to take up
05:35 - the entire height of our web browser
05:37 - we can set the height to be 100 VH
05:41 - meaning viewport height
05:43 - so now our container is taking up 100 of
05:46 - the height available
05:48 - if I were to zoom out the container is
05:51 - still taking up all that space
05:53 - so with our boxes let's change the
05:55 - background color because I can't really
05:57 - see them that well anymore
05:59 - for the background let's change that to
06:01 - be white
06:02 - I'm going to zoom out to 100 percent
06:05 - with my minimum height property I will
06:07 - set the minimum height of our boxes to
06:10 - be 50 percent
06:11 - now they take up 50 of the space
06:13 - available which is one hundred percent
06:16 - our viewport height
06:18 - if I were to change the minimum height
06:19 - to be 100 we take up the entire space
06:22 - available
06:23 - or I could set the max height to be 50
06:25 - percent
06:27 - even though we set max height to be 50
06:29 - we don't necessarily need all this space
06:32 - because there's not enough content if I
06:34 - absolutely need these boxes to take up
06:37 - at least 50 percent of the height of my
06:39 - window I would use minimum height
06:41 - instead of maximum height so really it's
06:44 - up to you alright everybody so that is
06:46 - an introduction to the height and width
06:48 - properties in CSS
06:51 - foreign
