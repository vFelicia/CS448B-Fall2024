00:00 - hey everybody with the last few minutes
00:01 - remaining of the mongodb in one hour
00:04 - series I thought I'd get a little more
00:05 - in depth with collections as we've
00:07 - learned at the beginning of the series a
00:09 - collection is a group of documents and a
00:12 - database is a group of collections
00:13 - within your database to show collections
00:15 - you can type show collections
00:19 - currently we only have one students
00:21 - let's create another though let's create
00:23 - a collection of teachers
00:25 - we'll use the DB dot create collection
00:30 - method pass in a name for this
00:33 - collection let's create a collection of
00:36 - teachers so this would work however
00:39 - there are some additional options that
00:41 - we can pass in as arguments to this
00:43 - method let's add the next argument it's
00:45 - comma separated another argument that we
00:47 - can pass into this method when creating
00:49 - a collection is a Max size for this
00:52 - collection we will set the capped field
00:54 - to be true that's informing mongodb this
00:58 - collection should have a maximum size
00:59 - this field is either true or false if
01:03 - capped is set to true you do need a
01:05 - minimum size specified
01:06 - so size that's a field then set a size
01:10 - in bytes if you would like a maximum
01:12 - size of 10 megabytes that would be 10
01:14 - million 10 million bytes
01:17 - let me count my zeros yeah that's
01:19 - accurate and or you can have a maximum
01:22 - number of documents
01:23 - you will set the Max field to be some
01:27 - amount of documents I don't want any
01:29 - more than 100 teachers
01:31 - our collection has a maximum size of 10
01:34 - megabytes we've also set that there can
01:37 - be no more than 100 documents in this
01:39 - collection we don't want any more than
01:41 - 100 teachers there are a few more
01:43 - advanced options for collections but
01:45 - that's beyond our level right now but
01:47 - another you may be interested in is auto
01:49 - index ID so that is a separate argument
01:52 - it's comma separated we need a document
01:55 - body
01:56 - Auto index ID
02:00 - this is either true
02:02 - or false
02:04 - based on indexes in the last topic
02:06 - automatically we apply an index to
02:09 - object ideas but we can toggle that to
02:11 - be true or false there are some pros and
02:14 - cons with indexes and index allows for
02:16 - quick lookup but any write operations
02:18 - are a little bit slower I'll set auto
02:20 - index ID to be false let's execute this
02:23 - command
02:24 - all right that was approved let's show
02:27 - our Collections show collections
02:30 - and we have two collections a collection
02:33 - for students and a collection for
02:34 - teachers hey let's create one more for
02:36 - practice let's create one more
02:38 - collection DB dot create collection
02:43 - what's the collection name let's create
02:44 - a collection of courses like what
02:47 - classes can we take at our school
02:49 - that was approved let's show our
02:51 - collections
02:53 - and we have three courses students
02:55 - teachers
02:56 - then to drop a collection you type DB
02:58 - the name of the collection let's drop
03:00 - our courses dot drop method
03:03 - that was dropped let's show our
03:05 - collections again
03:07 - and we are back to two collections a
03:09 - collection of students and a collection
03:11 - of teachers all right everybody that was
03:13 - mongodb in one hour hey if you've made
03:16 - it this far be sure you've smashed that
