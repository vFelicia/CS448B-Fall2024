00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
00:02 - hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to explain
00:05 - variables in c sharp
00:06 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - do you all remember back in middle
00:13 - school when we learned about algebra we
00:15 - had to solve an equation to find the
00:16 - value of
00:17 - x and x as some representation of a
00:19 - number well with programming we can
00:22 - create our own variables but we are not
00:24 - limited to just numbers
00:25 - we can store characters words and even
00:28 - these things called booleans which are
00:29 - either true or
00:31 - false so i'm going to show you all how
00:33 - we can create our own variables in c
00:35 - sharp creating a variable takes two
00:37 - steps declaration
00:38 - and initialization to create a variable
00:41 - we first have to declare what type of
00:42 - data we'll be storing
00:44 - if we need to store a number we'll type
00:45 - int short for integer
00:48 - and we'll need a unique name for this
00:50 - specific variable
00:51 - so let's just call this x and then end
00:54 - the statement with a semicolon because
00:56 - with programming semicolons are kind of
00:58 - like
00:58 - periods when you finish a sentence okay
01:00 - so this step
01:01 - was declaration and i'll just add a note
01:04 - here
01:05 - so this step is declaration
01:08 - and now to assign a value we will
01:11 - initialize this variable
01:12 - so to assign this variable x a value
01:15 - type
01:15 - x equals and then some value
01:19 - let's say one two three then semicolon
01:22 - okay so we now have a variable named x
01:25 - and
01:26 - this step is initialization
01:29 - now you can combine these two steps so
01:32 - to do that we would say
01:33 - int let's say y this time equals
01:37 - 321 semicolon so we have two variables
01:40 - x and y so this step right here is both
01:44 - declaration and initialization now these
01:47 - variables
01:47 - behave as the value that they contain so
01:50 - let's display some of these
01:51 - so within a console console.writeline
01:54 - statement
01:55 - i'm going to display x and then with a
01:58 - second rightline statement
01:59 - i will display y so console.writeline
02:03 - y and we have one two three
02:07 - three two one now you can use these for
02:10 - like math two we could say
02:11 - like int z equals x
02:14 - plus y and then display whatever
02:18 - z is console.writeline
02:22 - z and the result is
02:26 - 444. so these names for these variables
02:29 - really aren't descriptive
02:31 - x y and z we can give some more unique
02:33 - names that describe what kind of value
02:35 - that
02:36 - these variables contain so let's say int
02:39 - edge and i'll assign this variable age a
02:42 - value of 21
02:43 - and then i can display my edge within a
02:45 - writeline statement or use it for
02:47 - something
02:47 - so let's say console console.writeline
02:51 - and then i can display a message along
02:53 - with my age
02:55 - so let's say your age
02:59 - is so this part is within quotes
03:02 - to display the value of my age i will
03:05 - add
03:06 - plus edge make sure age is not within
03:09 - quotes
03:09 - because then we're printing a string
03:11 - literal and not the
03:13 - value contained within edge so this
03:15 - should display
03:18 - your age is 21. so there's more data
03:21 - types than just
03:22 - int this time let's use a double a
03:25 - double
03:26 - is really just a decimal number it's
03:28 - like a floating point number but with
03:29 - more precision
03:30 - there are floats in c sharp but i don't
03:32 - really think they're that important for
03:34 - beginners
03:35 - so with a double we can store a decimal
03:38 - number
03:38 - and int only stores a whole integer
03:42 - so if i try to display like 21.5
03:45 - and then display it this is what happens
03:50 - so we'll run into a build error so with
03:52 - int we can only store
03:54 - whole integers but with a double we can
03:56 - store something that includes a decimal
03:59 - so let's say we have a double height and
04:01 - i'll assign this
04:02 - a perfectly average height of 300.5
04:07 - centimeters i guess and now since this
04:09 - variable is initialized we can use it
04:11 - for something
04:12 - we can change the value or we can use it
04:14 - within a message
04:16 - so let's use console.writeline and i'll
04:19 - display
04:19 - my height within some sort of message
04:22 - let's say
04:23 - your height is
04:26 - space plus height
04:30 - plus another string let's say cm
04:34 - 4 centimeters then let's try it okay
04:38 - your age is 21 your height is 300.5
04:42 - centimeters so a double variable can
04:45 - store
04:45 - a decimal number unlike with integers
04:49 - they only store
04:50 - whole numbers now the next data type is
04:53 - boolean and to declare a boolean
04:55 - variable we type
04:56 - bool then a variable name so booleans
05:00 - can only store
05:01 - true or false so this might be good if
05:03 - you need
05:04 - something that only has like two options
05:06 - like a light switch
05:07 - it's on or it's off if somebody's online
05:10 - that could be true
05:10 - if they're offline that's false or maybe
05:13 - somebody
05:14 - is alive let's say bull alive either
05:17 - true
05:17 - or false but the last time i checked i
05:20 - am alive so i'm going to say that is
05:22 - true
05:22 - and then we can use this boolean
05:24 - variable for something
05:26 - so let's use this within a
05:27 - console.writeline statement
05:30 - console.writeline and what should we say
05:34 - are you alive
05:39 - plus alive
05:43 - are you alive that is true so if i
05:46 - change this to
05:47 - false this would display
05:51 - are you alive that is false so that is a
05:54 - boolean variable it's only true or
05:58 - false so for practice i'll encourage you
06:00 - to try and type something besides true
06:03 - or false like the word pizza
06:04 - we can't shove a whole pizza into a
06:06 - boolean variable
06:08 - it can only be true or false so let's
06:10 - change that back
06:11 - okay the next data type is char it's a
06:15 - character
06:15 - a single character what about symbol
06:19 - char symbol and we need to place this
06:21 - within
06:22 - single quotes so let's say our character
06:25 - is the at sign and then let's display it
06:32 - console.writeline
06:34 - your symbol is
06:39 - plus symbol
06:45 - your symbol is at sign so make sure that
06:48 - this is within single quotes when you
06:50 - assign a value
06:51 - so with chars we can only assign a
06:54 - single character if i
06:55 - attempted to add like a different symbol
06:57 - too well this wouldn't work then
06:59 - see we're getting an error here so
07:02 - that's where strings come in with a
07:03 - string
07:04 - we can store a series of characters and
07:06 - to declare this we type
07:08 - string with a capital s string let's say
07:11 - name string name and this value is
07:14 - within double quotes so type whatever
07:16 - your first name is
07:18 - and then we can use our name for
07:19 - something let's display
07:21 - a message that says hello whatever your
07:23 - name is
07:25 - console.writeline
07:28 - hello plus name
07:32 - okay hello bro your age is 21 your
07:36 - height is
07:36 - 300.5 centimeters are you alive
07:39 - false your symbol is at sign let's say
07:43 - that we have a username
07:45 - and i'll say string
07:48 - username equals
07:52 - symbol plus name
07:56 - and then i'll display this
08:00 - console.writeline
08:04 - your user name
08:07 - is colon space
08:10 - quotes plus user
08:13 - name whatever you typed here
08:19 - okay your username is at bro
08:22 - those are variables they're containers
08:25 - for values
08:26 - but you can store more than just numbers
08:28 - you can store boolean values
08:30 - characters and strings and a string is a
08:33 - series of characters
08:35 - so if you would like a copy of this code
08:37 - i will post this to the comment section
08:39 - down below
08:40 - and well those are variables in c sharp
