00:00 - hey how's it going everybody it's you
00:01 - bro hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to teach you
00:04 - guys how we can pass
00:06 - objects as arguments to a method so sit
00:08 - back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - make sure you like comment and subscribe
00:16 - one like equals one prayer for the
00:18 - youtube algorithm
00:20 - well well well welcome back ladies and
00:22 - gentlemen in this video i'm going to
00:23 - teach you guys how we can pass
00:25 - objects as arguments so let me give you
00:28 - the rundown of what i have so far here
00:30 - i have a main class as well as a class
00:32 - called garage and a class called car
00:35 - what we're going to be doing is sending
00:37 - our garage class
00:38 - some cars so we can park some cars in
00:41 - our garage
00:42 - so let's create an instance of our
00:44 - garage class and an instance of our car
00:46 - class
00:47 - so let's create a garage object garage
00:49 - let's call this garage
00:50 - equals new garage
00:55 - let's also create a car car i'll name
00:57 - this car
00:58 - equals new car and i'm going to set up a
01:02 - constructor for this car class
01:04 - let's say that all cars should have a
01:06 - name so
01:07 - string name let's declare this variable
01:09 - and within the constructor of our car
01:11 - class
01:12 - we'll set up one parameter of a string
01:15 - that will be called
01:16 - car this dot name
01:19 - equals name now if we were to
01:22 - instantiate
01:23 - an instance of the car class we need to
01:24 - send a car name
01:26 - so let's say we're attempting to park a
01:29 - bmw
01:30 - within our garage class so let's create
01:33 - a method within our garage class
01:35 - called park so this is void it's not
01:38 - returning anything
01:39 - and we will call this park because we're
01:41 - going to be parking cars
01:42 - all right we need to set up the
01:44 - parameters for this method
01:46 - so we first list the data type kind of
01:49 - like what we did with the parameter for
01:51 - our string
01:52 - so the data type is string but this time
01:55 - since we would like to pass in our car
01:57 - to the garage
01:59 - the parameter is going to be car kind of
02:02 - like what we did with our string
02:04 - because strings are also objects and
02:06 - then a name for this car
02:08 - we can keep the same just to be
02:09 - consistent but really you can name this
02:11 - whatever you want like that but
02:12 - i don't know the point of naming it that
02:14 - but whatever so let's just call this car
02:17 - car and what we can do is just maybe
02:20 - have a print line statement such as
02:22 - the car dot name
02:27 - is parked in the garage
02:32 - and that should be good for now so in
02:34 - order to call this park method of our
02:36 - garage
02:37 - we need to send a car to park so we type
02:41 - in the name of the class
02:43 - garage well the name of the instance of
02:45 - the class garage
02:46 - dot and we do have a park method here
02:50 - and you can see that we need to send a
02:52 - car in order to
02:53 - call this method if i attempted to run
02:56 - this
02:56 - it's not going to work
02:59 - just like that so in order to park a car
03:03 - using the garage's park method we need
03:05 - to send
03:06 - a car object so let's send our bmw
03:10 - garage dot park and we're sending our
03:12 - car
03:14 - the bmw is parked in the garage now
03:16 - let's park a second car
03:18 - so let's create a second car i'm going
03:20 - to call this car 2 and rename car as car
03:22 - 1.
03:24 - car 2 equals new car and let's say that
03:27 - this
03:28 - is a tesla and this time i'm going to
03:31 - park
03:32 - cartoon so garage dot park i'm going to
03:36 - send a different car object
03:38 - i'm going to send car 2 this time
03:41 - so we're going to park car 1 and car 2.
03:44 - so the bmw is parked in the garage and
03:47 - the tesla is parked in the garage as
03:49 - well
03:50 - so in conclusion you can pass objects as
03:52 - arguments to a method
03:54 - but when you declare that method you
03:56 - have to have the parameters
03:58 - set up to accept objects of that data
04:00 - type
04:01 - so for our example we have the data type
04:04 - of car
04:04 - so we can only send in cars to our
04:07 - garage
04:08 - to park if we had an additional class
04:10 - such as bicycles
04:11 - and created a bicycle object well we
04:14 - could not use
04:15 - the park method of our garage to send in
04:18 - a bicycle object
04:19 - because we can only pass in cars because
04:22 - that is the parameter that we set for
04:24 - this park method
04:26 - so that's the basics of sending objects
04:28 - as arguments if you would like a copy of
04:30 - all this code i will post
04:31 - all of this in the comments down below
04:33 - but yeah that's how to
04:35 - pass objects as arguments in java
04:38 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
04:41 - learn something new
04:42 - then you can help me help you in three
04:45 - easy steps
04:46 - by smashing that like button drop a
