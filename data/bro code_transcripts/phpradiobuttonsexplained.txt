00:00 - hey everybody in today's topic I'm going
00:02 - to show you how we can work with radio
00:03 - buttons in PHP let's get started
00:09 - to begin we'll need an HTML form I'm
00:11 - pretty sure you know how to create that
00:12 - already
00:17 - within our HTML form the action
00:19 - attribute will be set to our PHP file
00:22 - the method will be post to create a
00:24 - single radio button we can use a
00:26 - self-closing input tag
00:28 - set the type equal to B radio
00:33 - let's select a credit card I will set
00:36 - the first radio button to have a value
00:38 - of Visa
00:39 - here's our little radio button I'll add
00:42 - some text afterwards let's say Visa then
00:45 - I will add a line break
00:48 - okay let's copy these two lines of
00:50 - markup paste these twice
00:54 - then change the second radio button to
00:56 - be MasterCard then the third will be
00:59 - American Express
01:00 - so let's change these values
01:08 - here are three radio buttons but we have
01:10 - a problem we can select more than one
01:13 - radio button
01:14 - if we would like these within the same
01:16 - group we only ever should be able to
01:18 - select one at a time
01:20 - we need a name attribute
01:22 - name equals let's say credit card
01:26 - be sure to set this attribute for all of
01:29 - the three radio buttons they all need
01:31 - the same name
01:32 - there we can only select one now if
01:35 - these had a different name such as
01:36 - credit card 1 Credit Card 2 credit card
01:38 - three well they're technically all in
01:40 - different groups we need them all in the
01:43 - same group to select only one
01:45 - then lastly let's add a submit button
01:48 - input type equals submit
01:54 - then name may be confirmed it's a
01:57 - confirm button we're confirming some
02:00 - payment type
02:01 - for the value I will set that to be
02:04 - confirm as well
02:06 - now when I click on this button I would
02:09 - like to Output a message depending on
02:11 - which radio button is selected
02:14 - Let's test to see that everything's
02:16 - working fine though I will create a
02:18 - local variable named credit card I will
02:21 - set credit card equal to now to get one
02:23 - of these values we need to use the post
02:26 - variable whatever we set for the method
02:28 - access post
02:32 - the key we are looking for is credit
02:34 - card whatever the name attribute is set
02:37 - to the name of the group
02:39 - now when I run and reload this
02:41 - we have an undefined array key credit
02:44 - card which is to be expected
02:47 - we're running our PHP script but we have
02:49 - not yet set the credit card key
02:52 - let's enclose our code with an if
02:54 - statement we'll check to see if our
02:57 - confirm button is pressed is it set if
03:00 - it is then assign our variable
03:02 - if parentheses curly braces we will use
03:06 - the is set function which we learned
03:09 - about in the last topic we would like to
03:11 - check to see if our confirm button is
03:14 - set
03:15 - let's access post
03:18 - the key we are looking for is confirm
03:21 - whatever the name is
03:23 - if we press the button then assign our
03:27 - variable of credit card
03:31 - then let's Echo our credit card for
03:33 - testing purposes
03:34 - Echo credit card let's see what happens
03:38 - I'm going to press the confirm button
03:41 - then we get that warning which is a step
03:43 - in the right direction
03:45 - if I make a selection then press confirm
03:49 - we will Echo whatever value is stored
03:51 - within our credit card variable it's
03:53 - going to be one of these three values
03:55 - either Visa Mastercard or American
03:58 - Express
03:59 - before assigning the variable
04:02 - I would like this warning to not display
04:04 - after pressing the confirm button
04:06 - instead let's display a message please
04:09 - select a credit card or something
04:12 - let's create a nested if statement
04:17 - we will use the is set function again
04:20 - this time let's check to see if our
04:22 - credit card is set
04:26 - if our credit card is set then get the
04:30 - value and store it within a variable
04:34 - then for testing let's Echo that credit
04:37 - card
04:40 - if our credit card is not set we can
04:43 - execute an else statement
04:46 - else
04:47 - let's Echo
04:49 - please make a selection
04:54 - if I don't make a selection then press
04:57 - confirm we will Echo this message please
05:00 - make a selection in order to continue we
05:03 - need to make a selection let's select
05:05 - Visa
05:06 - we will output Visa
05:08 - MasterCard then American Express
05:12 - currently we have a variable credit card
05:14 - that has one of these three values
05:16 - one thing you could do with this
05:18 - variable is check to see if it's equal
05:20 - to a certain value
05:21 - I'm going to change my program around a
05:23 - little bit if we press the confirm
05:25 - button and one of these radio buttons is
05:27 - selected then assign our variable let's
05:30 - get rid of this Echo
05:32 - I'll add some if and else if statements
05:36 - this is just for demonstration purposes
05:39 - if our credit card
05:41 - is equal to Visa
05:44 - then let's Echo
05:48 - you selected
05:52 - Visa
05:55 - let's add an else if statement
05:59 - else if credit card is equal to
06:02 - MasterCard
06:05 - you selected MasterCard
06:08 - else if
06:10 - credit card is equal to American Express
06:17 - you selected
06:20 - American Express
06:24 - then else
06:25 - if credit card doesn't equal one of
06:28 - these three matches
06:30 - then let's Echo
06:33 - please make a selection
06:37 - all right let's see what happens
06:39 - currently
06:41 - if I make a selection such as Visa we
06:44 - will Echo you selected Visa
06:47 - you selected MasterCard you selected
06:50 - American Express
06:51 - but currently if I press the confirm
06:54 - button without making a selection
06:56 - we have some warnings that our credit
06:58 - card variable is undefined
07:01 - but we still execute the else Clause as
07:03 - you can see here
07:05 - one change I'll make is that let's
07:07 - declare our variable credit card
07:10 - but we won't assign it a value
07:12 - credit card equals null then we won't
07:16 - receive that warning that credit card is
07:18 - undefined we have declared it I'll press
07:21 - confirm please make a selection I can
07:24 - select one of these credit cards and we
07:26 - will display a message
07:28 - in this circumstance I would probably
07:30 - use a switch we're comparing some value
07:33 - against many matching cases I think a
07:35 - switch would be more efficient
07:38 - so let's create a switch for practice
07:42 - within our switch we are examining our
07:44 - credit card
07:45 - we will examine our credit card against
07:48 - matching cases
07:51 - Visa
07:52 - if our credit card is equal to Visa then
07:56 - let's Echo
07:58 - you selected
08:00 - Visa
08:03 - then add a break statement to break out
08:05 - of the switch
08:07 - let's do this for MasterCard add a case
08:09 - for MasterCard
08:12 - MasterCard
08:14 - you selected MasterCard
08:17 - then American Express
08:22 - American
08:23 - Express
08:25 - you selected American Express
08:28 - then a default case if there are no
08:30 - matching cases
08:33 - let's Echo
08:36 - please make a
08:38 - selection
08:42 - so if I press confirm we will Echo
08:45 - please make a selection if I select Visa
08:47 - you selected Visa you selected
08:49 - MasterCard you selected American Express
08:52 - all right everybody so those are a few
08:55 - different ways in which you can work
08:56 - with radio buttons in PHP to get the
08:59 - value of a given radio button group you
09:02 - can use the post variable then access
09:05 - that key whatever the name is
09:07 - then you can assign the value to a local
09:09 - variable to work with
09:11 - and you can do whatever you want with it
09:13 - in this case I just used the switch
09:15 - and well everybody those are a few
09:17 - different ways in which you can work
09:19 - with radio buttons in PHP
