00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
bro here and in this video I'm gonna
00:03 - teach you guys all about making lists
using HTML let's get into it
00:09 - in this video I'm gonna explain three
different types of HTML lists they are
00:14 - unordered lists ordered lists and
description lists each has their own
00:19 - specific tags for example unordered list
uses a pair of ul tags for unordered
00:26 - list ordered list uses a pair of olt
eggs for ordered list and description
00:31 - list has a pair of diello tags for a
description list and then I'll give you
00:37 - guys a bonus at the end of how you can
make a nested list which is basically a
00:41 - list inside of a list but that'll make
more sense near the end of the video
00:45 - let's begin by creating an unordered
list so this is useful if you need to
00:50 - make it list and the order really
doesn't matter and I'm thinking a
00:53 - perfect example of us using an unordered
list is a grocery shopping list you
00:59 - don't need to buy items within a certain
order on a grocery shopping list so if
01:04 - we need to make an unordered list we
need to use a pair of ul tags so we need
01:10 - a closing tag and an opening tag all
right
01:13 - so for each item that you want to add to
this list you need to make a list item
01:19 - so just type in Li then the item that
you want to add to this list let's say
01:24 - that we want buy ingredients from the
grocery store to bake a pizza
01:29 - well one ingredient that we could use is
dough or bread
01:34 - so we could say bread dough work with me
guys alright so the next time we can add
01:43 - to the list is perhaps tomato sauce and
then make sure you close each of these
01:51 - list items as well alright and then
let's add some cheese so list item
01:59 - cheese and then let's close this and how
about one more list item how about a
02:05 - topping how about peppers personally I
don't like peppers on my pizza but a lot
02:15 - of people do alright
so let's save this refresh the page and
02:19 - here is our list and by default these
are all bullet
02:23 - so that's pretty cool right you can also
add a heading or title to this list so
02:28 - let's use perhaps an h3 heading and you
need a closing tag for this and we'll
02:35 - say grocery list
let's save this refresh the page and it
02:41 - says grocery list and notice that all
the items in this list are indented so
02:46 - before we get too ahead of ourselves I'm
just going to add a note in my HTML
02:50 - document that just states that this is
an unordered list so I'll post all the
02:59 - code that I have in the comments down
below so feel free to copy this but I'm
03:05 - just gonna leave a comment in case
anybody's curious actually having the
03:09 - name of grocery list probably wasn't the
greatest idea cuz I don't want to
03:14 - confuse anybody grocery shopping cart
might have been better but I'll just
03:19 - keep it alright guys so there's a CSS
style that I'd like to introduce to you
03:24 - guys at this level I know that we're in
an HTML tutorial and we're going to
03:29 - cover CSS later but this is actually the
perfect time to introduce a CSS topic
03:34 - involving designing lists and changing
the bullet points so don't tell anybody
03:40 - that I'm introducing some CSS topics at
this level just keep it a secret between
03:44 - us ok all right so if you want to change
these bullet points to something else
03:48 - you have a few options so what you're
gonna do in the opening tag for the
03:52 - unordered list type in style equals and
then you need a set of double quotes and
03:58 - this is what we're gonna type in within
the double quotes list - style - type
04:07 - colon now we have a few options to pick
from I'll show you the first the first
04:11 - is circle so all of these disks will
become empty circles another is square
04:18 - so let's save this refresh the page and
all of these are now squares you can
04:24 - also put none in here if you want no
bullet points whatsoever although I do
04:29 - prefer some sort of bullet points and
the original by default is disk so that
04:37 - is the original bullet point that we had
- so that's the basics of an unordered
04:41 - list next I'll show you guys ordered
lists and it's going to be a similar
04:45 - process to this so first let's create a
heading so how about we create a heading
04:50 - such as a to-do list and remember with
ordered lists the order does matter
04:57 - so I'll give you an example let's just
create a title for this list actually
05:02 - better yet let's call this my to-do list
all right so if we want to create a
05:10 - ordered list you need to use the OLT egg
which is short for ordered lists then we
05:16 - need a closing tag and it's going to be
a similar process where we want to add
05:21 - an item to this list we need to use the
Li tag list item so we need to type in
05:28 - Li and add a closing tag all right so
what's first I might to do list for
05:34 - today well personally for me I need to
record a YouTube video let's save this
05:43 - refresh the page and here's my to-do
list and it has number 1 by default for
05:49 - the first item in your ordered list so
remember that the order does matter so
05:54 - let's create another item so li for list
item and next on my to-do list is go
06:01 - work out then let's close this and here
it says number 2 on my to-do list is to
06:12 - go work out and let's add one last one
Li for list item and the last thing on
06:20 - my to-do list for today is bake a pizza
06:26 - let's save this refresh the page and
number three is to bake a pizza now we
06:32 - also have the capability to change the
markings for each of these list items
06:37 - within an ordered list so what we'll do
for the opening ordered list tag we'll
06:42 - type in type equals and then within
double quotes we have a few options
06:48 - so we could say capital
and this will change our list to the
06:53 - letters of the alphabet all capitalized
otherwise you can change this to
06:57 - lowercase a save this and all of these
are now lowercase there's also Roman
07:04 - numerals so we can use capital I and
these are Roman numerals now I forgot
07:10 - the name of this lowercase I these are I
believe lowercase Roman numerals don't
07:16 - quote me on that I can't quite remember
and the default is just one where you
07:21 - have basically a numbered list starting
from 1 and you can also start from a
07:26 - different number as well let's say that
you want to begin this list with the
07:29 - number 100 for some reason and count up
from there so what you'll do is within
07:34 - the opening Oh well tag you'll type in
start equals and then within double
07:39 - quotes the number that you want to start
at so if we want to start at 100 for
07:44 - some reason we'll just type in 100 here
save this refresh and our first item in
07:50 - this list starts at 100 the number we
specified and each list item this number
07:56 - will increment by 1 for each list item
and if you change type to a different
08:02 - symbol or numbering system let's say
that we go back to Roman numerals and
08:06 - save this and refresh the page we have a
different symbol for our Roman numerals
08:14 - and I believe the letter C is 100 so
this would be 100 101 and 102 actually
08:22 - what would happen if we went back to the
alphabet I'm actually kind of curious
08:28 - oh so you get double letters that's kind
of cool but you know what I don't like
08:33 - that so let's go back to what we had
originally where type is just 1 and
08:38 - let's get rid of this start attribute
here but just so you know you have the
08:43 - capability of starting at a certain
number or in this case like Roman
08:48 - numeral or whatever you're using for
your list all right so let's save that
08:52 - refresh this and we go back to our
numbered list so what I'm gonna do is
08:57 - just leave a note that says this is an
ordered list and we'll move on to
09:02 - description lists then
alright so description lists sometimes
09:06 - they're also referred to as definition
lists basically it's a list of terms or
09:12 - items with a description for each
specific item so what we'll do is that
09:17 - will create another heading and how
about we create a list of web
09:22 - development languages mostly because I
kind of ran out of ideas so what we'll
09:27 - type in here is web dev languages then a
closing tag and then I'm going to copy
09:37 - this comment and change this to
description list all right so with
09:46 - description lists you need a DL tag
short for description list and a closing
09:52 - tag all right so there's going to be one
change compared to the other lists that
09:58 - we worked with
instead of using Li for list item what
10:01 - you're going to type instead is DT for
description term or definition term you
10:09 - might hear people call it and then you
need a closing tag as well for this all
10:14 - right so let's think of a few web
development languages we have HTML we
10:19 - also have DT then you need a closing tag
CSS and then lastly DT Java Script
10:33 - except I spelt it wrong all right let's
save this and check this out so far all
10:42 - right here is our heading and then we
have three items three description terms
10:49 - within our description list now if you
want to add a description after each of
10:54 - these items in your description list
what you'll do after each pair of these
10:58 - DT tags is add another set of tags the
DD tag no that doesn't mean designated
11:05 - driver it actually is short for
description details or sometimes known
11:10 - as definition details so we'll type in a
closing tag for this as well so what
11:15 - we'll add in here is
description that we want to add for our
11:19 - HTML list item so or definition term so
what we'll type in here you can type in
11:26 - whatever you want here basically but I
think I'll type in something that
11:30 - describes what HTML does so I'll say
adds structure to web page let's save
11:41 - this and see if it works yeah and we
have a description for this definition
11:46 - term or a description term so let's do
the same thing for the other terms in
11:51 - our list in our description list so
we'll type in D D for description
11:56 - details and then for CSS this adds style
to web page then we need to close this
12:06 - and then JavaScript D D and a closing
tag adds functionality to web page all
12:21 - right
let's save this refresh and here we have
12:25 - a description for each term in our
description list so that's basically how
12:30 - description lists work okay it's time
for that bonus round so these are the
12:35 - basic types of listen HTML unordered
lists ordered list and description lists
12:41 - so there's a concept of a nested list
which is basically a list that's inside
12:48 - of another list and you can apply this
to any type of list for example I'm
12:52 - going to copy our unordered list the
grocery list and I'll show you an
12:57 - example of a nested list so what I'll do
is change the description for unordered
13:04 - list two example of a nested list maybe
I'll call this grocery list 2.0 alright
13:16 - so let's say that I want to add a bunch
of different toppings so what I can do
13:21 - is that I'll change peppers to toppings
all right so between the list
13:30 - item tags I can actually create an
entirely new list within these two list
13:37 - item tags so I can do any sort of type a
list here so let's say I want another
13:43 - unordered list within here well you can
actually do that so let me make a
13:48 - closing tag for this too all right so we
have our list item for toppings and then
13:55 - we're gonna put tags for an unordered
list between here then we're going to
14:00 - add some list items so let's say that I
want to add peppers for the first item
14:07 - so let's check this out just to be sure
it works then so here grocery list 2.0
14:14 - we have bread dough tomato sauce cheese
toppings and then we have peppers
14:19 - underneath our toppings category or list
item and you can see that it has a
14:25 - different type of marking or a bullet
point so you can actually add a couple
14:31 - different list items and it will fall
under this toppings list item so we'll
14:36 - say perhaps mushrooms let's save this
try it out and we have mushrooms but I
14:43 - spelt that wrong and how about we add
pepperoni
14:47 - I probably spelt that wrong too but sue
me all right let's save that refresh the
14:55 - page and we now have pepperoni so
basically a nested list is this concept
15:01 - of having a list that's already inside
of another list and this nested list
15:06 - doesn't have to be the same type as the
list that it's contained within for
15:11 - example I could change this to ordered
list and this would work just the same
15:15 - all of these open circles would become
numbers then so this video is becoming
15:19 - very long I'll give you a super quick
conclusion you can create an unordered
15:24 - list a ordered list or a description
list you can use the UL tag the Oval tag
15:29 - or the DL tag and for each item within
the list you can use a list item tag to
15:36 - list it as an item within the list
except for the description list you can
15:40 - use a DT tag short for description term
and didi short for description details
15:47 - and then you can style these however you
want to depending on what you put within
15:52 - the opening tag for that specific list
and then a nested list is just a concept
15:58 - of having a list that's already inside
of another list so if you guys would
16:03 - like a a copy of this HTML document I'll
post it as a comment and pin it to the
16:08 - top then and if you guys are looking for
a practice or a project to work on why
16:12 - don't you guys create your own unordered
list ordered list description list and
16:17 - an example of a nested list and then
post it in the comments down below but
16:22 - yeah that is everything you need to know
to get started using lists in HTML
