00:02 - hey welcome back in this video i'm going
00:04 - to show you all how we can create lists
00:06 - in html there's three lists we're going
00:08 - to talk about unordered ordered and
00:10 - description lists let's begin with
00:12 - unordered lists to create an unordered
00:14 - list we need a pair of ul tags for an
00:18 - unordered list and between these ul tags
00:21 - we can create individual list items and
00:24 - we use a pair of li tags for each item
00:27 - we would like to add to our list so
00:28 - what's an example of an unordered list
00:30 - one thing that comes to mind is a
00:32 - shopping list like a grocery list
00:34 - because well i'm kind of hungry right
00:35 - now it's breakfast time let's say that
00:37 - we're going to bake a pizza and we need
00:39 - a list of ingredients we need pizza
00:41 - dough so add an item between this pair
00:45 - of li tags and we now have one bulleted
00:48 - item within our unordered list and let's
00:50 - create another item so we can just copy
00:52 - and paste this pair of li tags and
00:55 - create a new list item
00:57 - what about tomato sauce
00:59 - and then maybe cheese
01:02 - and toppings
01:04 - point being to create an unordered list
01:06 - you need a pair of ul tags and with each
01:09 - list item you would like to add to your
01:11 - unordered list you just place within a
01:13 - pair of li tags for list item an ordered
01:16 - list is very similar except we use old
01:19 - tags so we need an opening ol tag and a
01:22 - closing ol tag so by default each list
01:25 - item is going to be numbered so let's
01:27 - say that we have a to-do list
01:30 - to add a list item we need to use a pair
01:33 - of li tags perhaps this is a schedule of
01:36 - what we have to do in the morning we
01:38 - have to eat breakfast that could be one
01:40 - list item
01:42 - so to add another item we need another
01:44 - pair of li tags
01:46 - then maybe we need to take a shower
01:49 - so each of these is numbered and they're
01:51 - in ascending order
01:53 - and then we want to what about
01:56 - leave for work okay so yeah that is an
01:59 - ordered list the order of the list items
02:02 - does matter and we can change the type
02:04 - too within the opening oel tag there is
02:07 - a type attribute
02:08 - we can set each list item to a number a
02:10 - letter or roman numerals if i would
02:13 - instead like letters i can just set the
02:15 - type equal to a and our list items are
02:18 - now marked with the letter and we have
02:19 - description lists we need a pair of dl
02:22 - tags for description lists
02:25 - and instead of using an li tag for each
02:27 - list item we use a pair of dt tags for
02:31 - description term and d tags for
02:35 - description definition so for a term
02:38 - that is d t and then we add a definition
02:41 - to this term let's say we have a list of
02:44 - web dev languages for a term we need an
02:46 - opening dt tag and a closing dt tag
02:50 - and then we can add a definition to this
02:52 - term so that would be dd
02:55 - description definition between the
02:57 - opening and closing dd tags we can add a
03:00 - definition to this term
03:03 - let's say that this adds
03:05 - structure to a web page
03:10 - and then to create another term and
03:12 - definition pair we can just copy this
03:16 - let's add css this adds style to a web
03:20 - page
03:21 - then javascript
03:25 - this adds
03:27 - functionality to a web page with
03:30 - description lists each list item is a
03:32 - pair of terms and definitions the last
03:35 - thing i'm going to show you you can
03:36 - create a nested list within a list so
03:39 - let's say i would like to add a sub list
03:41 - of individual toppings to our unordered
03:43 - list within the list item we just create
03:46 - a new list let's say that i would like
03:49 - another unordered list so i need a pair
03:51 - of ul tags
03:54 - and what are some toppings we can place
03:56 - on our pizza so we need a list item
03:59 - what about pepperoni
04:02 - so we have a sub list going if you take
04:03 - a look on the webpage right now ah then
04:06 - maybe what about mushrooms next i like
04:08 - mushrooms
04:10 - and
04:11 - peppers i guess
04:13 - all right people those are how to create
04:15 - lists there's three types unordered
04:17 - ordered and description lists just use a
04:20 - pair of appropriate tags depending on
04:22 - the list you want to use so yeah
