00:02 - if you do need an mp3 file to work with
00:04 - for this video i recommend heading to
00:06 - the youtube audio library and then you
00:08 - can search and download a song of your
00:10 - choosing so after you find an mp3 file
00:12 - you can use a wav file too just drag and
00:15 - drop it to your folder containing your
00:17 - index.html file and then we can head to
00:20 - vs code now to add audio to our webpage
00:23 - we need an audio element
00:25 - so within angle brackets audio and list
00:28 - the source equal to the name of your mp3
00:32 - or wav file we're going to need some
00:34 - controls so this is a boolean attribute
00:36 - we don't need to set the sql to anything
00:38 - it's either true or false and to set it
00:40 - equal to true you just type the name of
00:42 - the attribute so within the audio
00:44 - element type controls and up top here we
00:47 - have our controls for our mp3 file with
00:50 - these controls we can play some audio
00:52 - file of our choosing
00:55 - [Music]
01:06 - and we can mute here's a couple other
01:08 - boolean attributes we can have our audio
01:10 - autoplay by using the autoplay boolean
01:12 - attribute
01:16 - if you would like this to be muted
01:18 - originally type muted so this is playing
01:21 - but you can't hear it because it's muted
01:25 - if you need this to loop just type loop
01:28 - yep and it's looping you can have backup
01:30 - audio files just in case your web
01:32 - browser doesn't support a given format
01:34 - so if you would like some backup audio
01:36 - files we're going to change this around
01:37 - a little bit so let's get rid of our
01:39 - source and we'll create an audio closing
01:41 - tag
01:42 - and we will create multiple nested
01:44 - source elements type source
01:47 - source equals the name of one audio file
01:50 - you would like to use primarily if you
01:52 - have a backup let's say we have the same
01:55 - song as a wav file you can do that too
01:58 - if for some reason the browser using
02:00 - doesn't support these first two audio
02:02 - files you can always display a message
02:04 - this browser does not
02:07 - support
02:09 - html5
02:10 - audio so yeah everybody that's how to
02:13 - add audio to a web page you just have to
02:15 - use this audio element and set the
02:17 - source equal to an audio file of your
02:19 - choosing and there's a bunch of boolean
02:21 - attributes that you can add to if you
02:23 - would like some controls if you need to
02:25 - set this to autoplay if you need it
02:27 - muted and if you need it to loop so yeah
02:29 - that's how to add audio to a webpage if
