00:00 - all right everybody today I'm going to
00:01 - show you how we can both sort and limit
00:03 - documents in mongodb to return all
00:06 - documents we can type DB the name of the
00:09 - collection dot then we can use the find
00:12 - method to return all documents to sort
00:15 - these documents in some sort of order
00:16 - again we would type DB the name of the
00:19 - collection students dot find method then
00:22 - we'll do some method chaining after the
00:24 - find method add dot then we will call
00:27 - the sort method
00:29 - the sort method takes a document by
00:31 - which field would we like to sort let's
00:33 - sort names in alphabetical order we
00:36 - would type the name of the field Name
00:37 - colon then one for alphabetical order or
00:41 - negative one for reverse alphabetical
00:43 - order so if we were to sort by
00:46 - alphabetical order here's the results we
00:49 - have Gary then Larry Patrick Sandy
00:52 - SpongeBob then reverse alphabetical
00:55 - order that was
01:01 - Name colon negative one now we have
01:04 - SpongeBob Sandy Patrick Larry Gary let's
01:07 - sort our documents by GPA grade point
01:10 - average
01:12 - so again we use the find method then
01:15 - we'll method chain the sort method we're
01:17 - passing in a document object with our
01:19 - criteria we will sort by GPA in
01:23 - ascending order so we will use one I'm
01:26 - going to copy this because I'm going to
01:27 - use it later
01:29 - okay now we're sorting by GPA Patrick
01:32 - has the lowest GPA 1.5 2.5 2.8 3.2 then
01:38 - 4.
01:40 - to sort our GPA by deciding order we
01:43 - would type GPA negative one
01:45 - then we have Sandy at the top with the
01:47 - gpf4 then SpongeBob with 3.2 2.8 2.5 1.5
01:54 - now we have the limit method we can
01:57 - limit the amount of documents that are
01:58 - returned to us let's type DB dot
02:01 - students dot find method dot limit
02:04 - method
02:05 - we will pass the number of documents we
02:07 - would like return to us as an argument
02:09 - if I would like one document returned to
02:11 - us I will pass in one
02:13 - currently my documents are sorted by
02:16 - object ID this would give us the first
02:18 - document of SpongeBob
02:20 - if I were to use limit 3 we would be
02:23 - returned three documents
02:25 - SpongeBob Patrick Sandy
02:28 - we can combine both the sort and the
02:30 - limit methods too
02:32 - I would like to return the student with
02:34 - the highest GPA we'll use the find
02:37 - method
02:38 - then method chain the sort method
02:40 - we are sorting by GPA
02:43 - we're going to sort in decreasing order
02:45 - so negative one followed by the limit
02:48 - method
02:50 - I would like just one document who has
02:53 - the highest GPA that would be Sandy with
02:56 - a GPA of four
02:57 - who has the lowest GPA we should sort an
03:01 - increasing order that would be one then
03:03 - limit one
03:05 - so Patrick has the lowest GPA of 1.5
03:09 - now let's work with sorting and limiting
03:11 - Encompass to sort the documents in your
03:13 - collection you can press more options
03:16 - then add some sort criteria I will sort
03:19 - by name
03:21 - colon one
03:23 - then find
03:25 - so we have Gary Larry Patrick Sandy
03:27 - SpongeBob
03:29 - then negative one for reverse
03:31 - alphabetical order
03:33 - SpongeBob Sandy Patrick Larry Gary
03:36 - let's sort by GPA
03:39 - GPA negative one that would give us
03:42 - decreasing order so Sandy's at the top
03:46 - to limit the amount of documents that
03:47 - are returned you can enter in a number
03:49 - for the limit box I will limit the
03:51 - records to one so we are returned with
03:53 - Sandy she has the highest GPA limit
03:56 - three would give us the top three
03:57 - students or leave limit MTU to return
04:00 - all documents all right everybody so
04:02 - that is basic sorting and limiting in
04:05 - mongodb
