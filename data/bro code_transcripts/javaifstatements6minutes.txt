00:00 - hey how's it going everybody it's your
00:01 - bro hope you're doing well and in this
00:02 - video i'm going to teach you guys all
00:04 - about if statements in java so sit back
00:06 - relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - make sure you like comment and subscribe
00:14 - one like equals one prayer for the
00:16 - youtube algorithm
00:18 - all right guys and gals in this video
00:20 - we're going to talk about if statements
00:22 - and if statement is a very basic form of
00:24 - decision making
00:26 - when an if statement evaluates to be
00:28 - true it will perform
00:29 - a block of code and that is it here's an
00:32 - example let's say we have a variable
00:34 - called
00:35 - maybe h into age equals let's set this
00:38 - to 18
00:39 - we can perform a block of code if
00:42 - some condition that we state evaluates
00:44 - to true
00:45 - so this is how to create an if statement
00:47 - we type in the word if
00:49 - a set of parentheses and then a set of
00:51 - curly braces
00:52 - so within the parentheses of the if
00:54 - statement this is the condition
00:56 - we can check to see if somebody is
00:58 - perhaps 18 or older
01:00 - so what we can do is write a condition
01:02 - such as age
01:04 - is greater than or equal to 18. within
01:07 - our program
01:07 - when we reach this if statement we're
01:09 - going to check to see if this
01:11 - evaluates to be true or false currently
01:13 - our age is set to 18
01:15 - so this will evaluate to be true and we
01:17 - will perform whatever is within
01:19 - the set of curly braces so let's print a
01:22 - message
01:23 - such as u are an
01:27 - adult and let's test this
01:30 - so our age is 18 our if statement
01:32 - evaluates to be true
01:33 - and therefore we will perform this block
01:36 - of code associated with
01:38 - this if statement and we will display
01:40 - the message
01:41 - you are an adult what if we change this
01:43 - to
01:44 - maybe 12 and then with our if statement
01:46 - when we
01:47 - reach this condition this will evaluate
01:50 - to be false
01:51 - therefore we will skip this block of
01:53 - code as if it never even happened
01:55 - we could perform a different action
01:57 - instead we could write
01:59 - an else statement there is no condition
02:01 - we just need the word else
02:02 - followed by a set of curly braces now we
02:05 - are forced to take
02:07 - one of two actions we will check to see
02:09 - if our condition is true
02:10 - if it is true we will perform this block
02:13 - of code
02:14 - if it's false we will instead perform
02:16 - this block of code
02:17 - so let's print a different message
02:20 - you are not an adult
02:25 - so we are forced to perform one of two
02:28 - actions
02:29 - if our condition is true we will perform
02:31 - our if statement
02:32 - if it's false we will perform our else
02:34 - statement and this states that
02:36 - you are not an adult now it is entirely
02:38 - possible to check
02:40 - more than one condition before reaching
02:42 - an else statement and that is by using
02:44 - what is called an
02:44 - else if statement so we type else if
02:48 - a set of parenthesis and then a set of
02:49 - curly braces
02:51 - so we can check an additional condition
02:53 - before reaching
02:54 - our else statement so let's check to see
02:57 - if
02:57 - our age is greater than or equal to
03:01 - 75 all right and then we will print a
03:04 - message
03:05 - such as okay boomer
03:08 - so pay attention to this let's change
03:10 - our edge to 75 and run this
03:13 - all right well it displays you are an
03:15 - adult that's because
03:16 - our if condition evaluates to true
03:19 - because 75 is greater than
03:21 - or equal to 18 so it's going to skip
03:25 - everything else and ignore these blocks
03:27 - of code
03:28 - and continue on with the rest of the
03:29 - program so if we want to first
03:32 - check to see if somebody's age is
03:34 - greater than or equal to 75
03:36 - what we can do is move this to our if
03:39 - statement
03:40 - and i'll just switch these around and
03:42 - change our else if statement to 18.
03:45 - so we'll first check to see if somebody
03:48 - is greater than or equal to 75
03:51 - if they are we will first print okay
03:53 - boomer
03:54 - else if if their age is greater than or
03:56 - equal to 18
03:58 - we will display you are an adult
04:02 - and let's try this again and it displays
04:05 - okay boomer so you can see that we got
04:08 - an entirely different result
04:09 - with these if statements if the
04:12 - condition evaluates to be true
04:14 - it's going to perform its own block of
04:16 - code and skip
04:17 - everything else you can check more than
04:19 - one condition by adding
04:21 - else if statements we could check one
04:22 - more thing perhaps
04:24 - else if
04:27 - age is greater than or
04:30 - equal to 13 then we
04:33 - can display another message such as
04:37 - you are a teenager
04:42 - and if we changed our integer variable
04:44 - age
04:45 - to 13 this will display you are a
04:48 - teenager
04:50 - there is one thing that you should know
04:52 - these symbols the
04:53 - less than sign equal sign the greater
04:55 - than sign these are known as comparison
04:57 - operators
04:58 - so they work normally as what you would
05:01 - imagine however if you want to compare
05:03 - if
05:03 - something or some value is equal you
05:06 - don't use
05:07 - one equal sign that's using the
05:09 - assignment operator
05:10 - so we're attempting to assign our
05:12 - variable age equal to 75
05:14 - if we need to compare if something is
05:16 - equal we use
05:17 - two equal signs so that's just one thing
05:20 - that is specific for
05:21 - programming so we can check to see if
05:23 - our age
05:24 - is equal to 75 and this time it will
05:28 - print
05:29 - ok boomer so that's all what an if
05:31 - statement is
05:32 - it's a basic form of decision making for
05:34 - your program
05:35 - if a condition evaluates to be true then
05:38 - it will perform a block of code
05:40 - if its condition is false it will
05:43 - perform its else statement
05:44 - unless you have else if statements then
05:48 - it's one by one going to check to see if
05:50 - these conditions are true before
05:52 - reaching the else statement
05:53 - well ladies and gentlemen that's the
05:55 - basics of if statements
05:57 - if you would like a copy of all of this
05:59 - code i will post this in the comments
06:01 - down below
06:02 - and if i could ask a favor of you i
06:03 - would greatly appreciate it if you smash
