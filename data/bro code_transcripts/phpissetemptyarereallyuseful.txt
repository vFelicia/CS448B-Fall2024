00:00 - hello again everybody today I need to
00:02 - explain two useful PHP functions the
00:05 - first is the is set function the other
00:08 - is the empty function these are two
00:11 - useful functions to determine if HTML
00:13 - elements are filled in or otherwise
00:16 - interacted with the isset function
00:18 - returns true if a variable is declared
00:21 - and not null empty returns true if a
00:25 - variable is not declared false null or
00:28 - is an empty string here's an example
00:30 - let's create a username variable
00:33 - username equals make up some username
00:39 - I am going to Echo then use the is set
00:43 - function Place some value or variable
00:46 - within the parentheses of this function
00:49 - when I run this program
00:51 - we output 1. in php1 means true if user
00:56 - name was null
01:00 - is set returns false we don't display
01:03 - anything
01:04 - let's go over a few different values
01:05 - using an if statement
01:09 - if
01:10 - is set add a set of parentheses
01:16 - if the is set function returns true
01:19 - let's Echo
01:21 - this variable is set
01:26 - else let's Echo
01:30 - this variable is not set
01:35 - under which circumstances does the is
01:38 - set function return true that function
01:40 - returns true if a variable is declared
01:43 - and not null what if we don't have a
01:45 - variable
01:48 - the is set to function returns false
01:50 - that means we execute this else
01:52 - statement this variable is not set what
01:55 - if we declare a variable and it's null
01:59 - well the variable is not set either what
02:02 - if this value was true
02:04 - this variable is set how about false
02:08 - the variable is set
02:11 - an empty string
02:13 - the variable is set
02:15 - type in a username
02:17 - the variable is also set those are the
02:20 - circumstances in which the is set
02:22 - function will return either true or
02:24 - false now let's use the empty function
02:27 - this function will return true if a
02:31 - variable is not declared false null or
02:34 - an empty string
02:36 - let's change is set to the empty
02:39 - function
02:40 - we will examine our username variable if
02:43 - this variable is empty let's Echo this
02:46 - variable is empty
02:49 - else this variable is not empty
02:54 - if we don't have a variable I'll get rid
02:56 - of our username
02:58 - this variable is empty
03:01 - if username is null
03:06 - the variable is empty still
03:09 - true
03:11 - the variable is not empty
03:14 - false the variable is empty
03:18 - an empty string
03:20 - the variable is still empty type in a
03:23 - username
03:25 - the variable is not empty
03:27 - now what we're going to do is create an
03:29 - HTML login form we'll need a username a
03:32 - password and a login button we can use a
03:35 - combination of the is set and empty
03:37 - functions to determine if our login
03:38 - button is interacted with or our
03:41 - username and password fields are filled
03:43 - in so let's create an HTML document
03:46 - within the body of my document I will
03:48 - create a form
03:50 - then close it right away
03:54 - in the opening form tag we will set the
03:57 - action attribute to equal our PHP
04:00 - document
04:01 - the method let's use post
04:06 - we will need two labels one for username
04:09 - the other for password
04:14 - username
04:17 - let's copy this label paste it change
04:19 - username to password
04:24 - I'll add a text box
04:26 - [Music]
04:33 - the name attribute will be set to
04:35 - username
04:37 - I'll add a break line copy this text box
04:40 - paste it underneath password change text
04:43 - to password
04:46 - let's set the name attribute to be
04:47 - password
04:49 - then we need a submit button
04:52 - input type equals submit
04:56 - let's set the name equal to B let's set
04:59 - the name attribute to be a login then I
05:01 - will set the value the text on the
05:04 - button to be log in here's our sample
05:07 - login form
05:09 - using the post super Global variable
05:12 - is technically an associative array
05:14 - which we learned about in the last topic
05:16 - for demonstration purposes I am going to
05:19 - use a for each Loop and iterate over all
05:22 - of the elements within this array
05:25 - let's access our post super Global
05:27 - variable
05:29 - iterate over post as
05:32 - key Arrow value
05:37 - then during each iteration every key
05:42 - every value
05:44 - then add a break line
05:47 - I should probably add a break line after
05:48 - the submit button too
05:50 - you may need to reload your page
05:53 - then if I press log in
05:56 - we will spit out the associative array
05:58 - that's contained within our post super
06:00 - Global variable here are the keys
06:03 - and here are the values
06:05 - our username and password are both empty
06:08 - strings
06:09 - this thing
06:10 - our login key has this value whatever
06:14 - value we set within the HTML element if
06:17 - we hit the login button we can check to
06:19 - see if this key using the is set
06:22 - function we can determine if this value
06:25 - is set using the empty function we can
06:28 - determine if these values are empty
06:31 - which they currently are we can yell at
06:33 - the user like hey what the heck you
06:35 - didn't enter in your username or
06:36 - password I will reuse this for each Loop
06:39 - later let me just turn this into one
06:41 - giant comment
06:44 - now that we know how that works
06:46 - let's check to see if our button is
06:49 - clicked
06:50 - let's write an if statement
06:53 - if
06:54 - is set function
06:56 - access the post super Global variable
06:59 - we are looking for our login button
07:03 - whatever the name is set to
07:05 - for testing purposes let's Echo
07:09 - you tried to log in
07:14 - so if I save I need to reload the page
07:18 - if I press the login button
07:21 - this button is now set you tried to log
07:24 - in
07:25 - we no longer need this line for testing
07:28 - let's save after pressing the login
07:31 - button let's check if our username is
07:34 - filled in let's get the username
07:37 - username equals we are accessing the
07:40 - post super Global variable the key is
07:43 - our username
07:45 - whatever the name is
07:48 - then let's get our password to while
07:50 - we're at it
07:51 - variable password equals
07:55 - the key is password
07:59 - within our if statement we will write an
08:00 - inter if statement
08:03 - if empty function
08:06 - if our username is empty
08:10 - then let's Echo
08:14 - username is missing
08:18 - else we will display a welcome message
08:22 - Echo
08:26 - hello
08:27 - variable username
08:31 - okay let's reload
08:32 - [Music]
08:34 - I'm gonna press log in without filling
08:37 - in a username username is missing
08:40 - but if I type in a username then log in
08:43 - we get our hello message hello bro code
08:47 - I'll add an else if statement
08:49 - then we'll check to see if our password
08:52 - is missing
08:54 - if empty function we are examining our
08:57 - password
08:58 - then we will Echo
09:02 - password is missing let's save reload
09:07 - type in a username don't type in a
09:10 - password Press login password is missing
09:13 - in order to Output this Hello message we
09:15 - need both a username and a password
09:18 - type in a username
09:20 - type in a password
09:23 - pizza123 Press login
09:25 - and you get your welcome message I'm
09:28 - going to enclose the section of code
09:29 - within a comment block let's go back to
09:32 - our for each Loop there's something I
09:34 - want to explain
09:37 - so let's save
09:39 - reload make up a username
09:43 - type in a password
09:46 - when I press log in
09:48 - you can see that our username and
09:49 - password fields are both filled in
09:51 - they're no longer empty this is our
09:53 - associative array contained within the
09:55 - post super Global variable
09:57 - using these if statements the first
10:00 - thing we were checking is if our login
10:02 - button is set which it is it contains a
10:05 - value
10:06 - then we were checking if our username
10:08 - and passwords were empty or not this
10:10 - time they were not empty that's what it
10:12 - looks like behind the scenes when you're
10:14 - accessing the post super Global variable
10:16 - it's made of key value Pairs and you can
10:18 - determine if a value is set or it's
10:21 - empty all right everybody so that is the
10:23 - is set and empty functions in PHP
