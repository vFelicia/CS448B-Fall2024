00:00 - yo what's going on everybody it's bro
00:02 - hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to explain
00:05 - dictionary comprehensions in python so
00:07 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - okay people dictionary comprehensions
00:15 - they're very similar to list
00:16 - comprehensions except they're with
00:17 - dictionaries
00:18 - that's it video over okay but seriously
00:20 - a dictionary comprehension is a way to
00:22 - create dictionaries using an expression
00:25 - and they can replace for loops and
00:26 - certain lambda functions
00:28 - and all we have to do is follow this
00:29 - formula dictionary equals key
00:32 - colon our expression for key value
00:35 - in iterable so let's go over a few
00:37 - examples our first example we're going
00:39 - to take
00:39 - this dictionary named cities in f f is
00:42 - short for fahrenheit
00:44 - i have different city names as keys and
00:46 - relative temperatures
00:48 - as values in fahrenheit so new york is
00:51 - 32 degrees fahrenheit boston is 75.
00:54 - los angeles is 100 and chicago is 50.
00:57 - and what we'll be doing is creating a
00:59 - separate dictionary where all of these
01:01 - temperatures will be in celsius using a
01:03 - dictionary comprehension
01:05 - so let's follow this formula let's
01:07 - create a new name for this dictionary
01:09 - let's say cities in c short for celsius
01:13 - equals and we will follow this pattern
01:15 - first our key
01:17 - golden then our expression we'll go back
01:19 - to this in just a moment
01:20 - for key comma
01:23 - value in our iterable
01:27 - of cities in f and since we're working
01:31 - with a dictionary we're going to use the
01:33 - items method now we just need to fill in
01:35 - this expression
01:36 - there is a formula to convert fahrenheit
01:39 - to celsius and it should be on the
01:40 - screen right about now
01:42 - so let's follow this formula so we'll
01:44 - take our value
01:45 - minus 32 and just for good measure i'm
01:48 - going to put these within parentheses
01:51 - and we will multiply all of this by
01:55 - 5 divided by 9 and that is it so we have
01:58 - our key our expression to convert
02:01 - fahrenheit to celsius for key value
02:05 - in our iterable of cities in f
02:08 - our previous dictionary and let's test
02:11 - this by printing
02:12 - our new dictionary cities in
02:16 - c actually i think i'm going to round
02:19 - these numbers
02:20 - just so it's more readable so let's
02:22 - round all this
02:24 - there we go so new york and celsius is
02:27 - zero boston is 24.
02:29 - los angeles is 38 and chicago is 10. so
02:32 - we created a
02:33 - new dictionary using a dictionary
02:35 - comprehension
02:36 - now with these dictionary comprehensions
02:38 - you can add an if conditional to the end
02:40 - of this
02:41 - so let's say that we have a separate
02:42 - dictionary of weather
02:44 - like a description of the weather in
02:45 - each city new york is snowing
02:47 - boston is sunny los angeles is sunny and
02:50 - chicago is cloudy
02:51 - let's say that we would like to create a
02:53 - separate dictionary with a dictionary
02:55 - comprehension
02:57 - that only has cities where the weather
02:59 - is sunny
03:00 - so i would write something like this
03:02 - let's say sunny weather will be the name
03:04 - of our dictionary
03:05 - equals and we'll follow this formula and
03:08 - then we just tack on our conditional to
03:10 - the end
03:11 - so it's kind of the same as before
03:12 - really so key
03:15 - colon and we don't really have an
03:17 - expression here so let's just say
03:19 - value then for
03:24 - key comma value
03:28 - in our iterable of
03:31 - weather dot items
03:34 - then our conditional if value
03:38 - equals sunny because we are only looking
03:41 - for
03:41 - sunny weather and let's print this
03:45 - print our dictionary of sunny
03:48 - weather and let me just make this more
03:51 - readable for you guys
03:52 - and our new dictionary comprehension
03:54 - will create a dictionary
03:56 - of key values where the value is sunny
03:59 - using an if conditional at the end of
04:01 - our dictionary comprehension
04:03 - here's a third example for you well if
04:04 - you have an if else condition you can
04:06 - add that to where the expression is
04:08 - within your dictionary comprehension
04:10 - so i'm going to reuse the previous
04:12 - dictionary for the first example where
04:14 - we have
04:14 - cities and their temperatures as values
04:17 - so we're going to replace each
04:19 - temperature with a description of the
04:21 - weather
04:21 - is it warm or is it cold so let's do
04:24 - that using a dictionary comprehension
04:26 - that contains an if else statement
04:28 - so let's say we have a new dictionary
04:30 - named desk short for description
04:33 - cities it's a brief description of each
04:35 - city's temperature
04:36 - so we follow this formula key
04:40 - then our if else conditional for key
04:43 - value
04:43 - and iterable actually i probably can
04:46 - copy all this
04:47 - just to save some time okay so our
04:50 - iterable
04:51 - will be cities dot items
04:55 - and our conditional is going to be
04:58 - we will return warm if
05:02 - our value is greater than or equal to
05:05 - let's say 40. else cold
05:11 - and we will print our new dictionary
05:14 - of desk cities description of cities
05:19 - so new york is cold because it's 32
05:21 - that's below 40.
05:23 - boston is warm los angeles is warm and
05:25 - chicago is warm
05:26 - now if your condition gets somewhat
05:28 - complex you can even call a separate
05:30 - function to keep your code more
05:32 - organized
05:32 - so key then we can call a function and
05:34 - pass in a value
05:36 - for key value in iterable so i'm going
05:38 - to again
05:39 - reuse our city names and our
05:41 - temperatures and this time we are going
05:43 - to
05:44 - call a function instead i think i'll
05:46 - reuse this code from the previous
05:48 - example where we have a separate
05:49 - dictionary named
05:50 - desk cities and i'm going to replace
05:53 - this if else statement
05:54 - with a function so let's say we have a
05:56 - function that is named
05:58 - check temp and we will pass in our value
06:02 - and we just need to define this function
06:04 - so let's define that here so let's
06:06 - define check temp
06:10 - and our parameter is our value that
06:12 - we're currently working on within our
06:14 - dictionary
06:15 - value then we'll write if
06:18 - value is greater than or equal to
06:22 - let's say anything above how about 70
06:25 - will return the word hot
06:30 - then else if
06:33 - let's say 69 greater than
06:36 - or equal to value
06:40 - and then value is greater than
06:43 - or equal to how about 40
06:46 - then we will return
06:49 - the word warm and lastly
06:54 - else return
06:57 - cold and let me just fix some of the
07:00 - spacing
07:02 - now depending on the temperature that is
07:04 - stored within each value of our
07:06 - dictionary
07:07 - we will call a function that will return
07:10 - one of a few different outputs
07:12 - so it's kind of like we're using the map
07:14 - function the map lambda function
07:16 - so let's print our description
07:19 - of cities and we should get a short
07:22 - description of the temperature in each
07:24 - city
07:25 - after we call the check temperature
07:27 - function and then pass in each value
07:29 - from our dictionary
07:30 - so new york is cold because it's 32
07:32 - degrees fahrenheit
07:33 - boston is hot because it's above 70. los
07:36 - angeles is hot because it's 100 and then
07:39 - chicago is warm because that is 50 which
07:41 - is between
07:42 - 69 and 40 within our function so that
07:46 - is a dictionary comprehension it's a
07:48 - shortcut where you can create
07:49 - dictionaries using an expression
07:52 - and they can replace for loops and
07:53 - certain lambda functions
07:55 - so if you would like a copy of all this
07:57 - code i will post all of this to the
07:58 - comment section down below
08:00 - and well yeah that's how dictionary
08:02 - comprehensions work in python
08:06 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
08:08 - learned something new
08:09 - then help me help you in three easy
08:11 - steps
