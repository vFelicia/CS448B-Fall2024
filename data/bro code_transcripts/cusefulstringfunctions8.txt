00:00 - how's it going everybody it's you bro
here I hope you're doing well and in
00:03 - this video I'm going to teach you some
useful functions related to strings and
00:07 - C++ let's get into it
this video is going to be more of a
00:12 - showcase of the different string
functions that are available to us so
00:16 - we're going to be covering a lot of them
if there's any that you want to see in
00:20 - particular look in the description for
any timestamps and you can hop around if
00:24 - you want we're going to kick this off
with the string dot length function this
00:28 - returns the length of a string that you
specify so let me show you how this
00:32 - works then we're going to create a
string named perhaps first name and
00:37 - we're not going to assign this quite yet
because we're going to accept some user
00:40 - input now we're going to see out a
prompt enter your first name and then
00:50 - we're going to use get line CN comma
first underscore name we can use the
01:01 - length function to determine how long
our name is and we can actually store
01:06 - this as an integer variable or we don't
have to but I'll show you a good use so
01:12 - length equals whatever string that we
want to determine what the length is so
01:17 - first name dot length and then a set of
parentheses so you'll notice with a lot
01:25 - of these functions that they will end
with a set of parentheses so pay
01:29 - attention to that alright so we have our
length now what well I'll show you a
01:34 - good use then we can check to see if
somebody's name is too long like if they
01:38 - create a username we can determine if
it's too long or not we can have them
01:42 - choose something else so perhaps if do
this within parentheses length is
01:50 - greater than or equal to 12 then what we
will do is display a message your name
02:00 - can't be over 12 characters long okay
else see out
02:16 - welcome
then we'll display your first name
02:24 - alright let's try this into your first
name I'll just type in bro welcome bro
02:30 - alright so that worked just fine but I
just want to change something real quick
02:35 - because it's bothering me I just want to
give him a space when you enter your
02:39 - name in okay let's assume that we have a
very long username so let's try this
02:45 - again then bro
my username for other things is usually
02:51 - bro Matias so let's use that
Prometheus 4 2 0 6 9 WTF bvq that looks
03:03 - like a good username to me your name
can't be over 12 characters long so
03:08 - that's a good use of the length function
oh and another thing with the length
03:13 - function and actually many functions is
that you don't necessarily need to
03:17 - assign this to a variable we could just
take this delete it and then place this
03:23 - within our if statement so this would
actually work just the same within less
03:27 - steps even though it's a little more
complex I would say but it takes up less
03:30 - lines of code so let's try it so bro 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 let's move on to the
03:39 - empty function so you can use a strings
empty function to determine if any
03:45 - characters were placed within that
string and a good use of this is that if
03:49 - you prompt for a name and somebody just
skips it by hitting Enter we can
03:53 - actually determine if that string is
actually empty done so let's try this
03:58 - then we'll put this within our if
statement first underscore name and
04:02 - we're going to use the dot empty
function and then we need a set of
04:07 - parentheses so if the first name is
empty it's going to execute our if
04:13 - statement if not it's going to use the
else statement so we can create a prompt
04:18 - such as you didn't enter a name
04:26 - okay let's see if this actually works
then and to your first name I'm just
04:35 - going to hit enter you didn't enter a
name then let's try it again but put a
04:40 - name in so bro welcome bro the clear
function will clear the contents of a
04:47 - string so it's useful if you need to
reset something so in this little
04:50 - program I wrote we just have a basic
welcome message that display is welcome
04:55 - and then your first name or username
whatever you enter it'll say that your
04:59 - name has been cleared will actually
clear it by typing in the string that we
05:03 - want to clear so first underscore name
dot clear parentheses then a semicolon
05:09 - and then we will display that welcome
message one more time then so let's see
05:14 - if this works unto your first name bro
welcome bro your name has been cleared
05:20 - and then it says welcome and then
nothing after that because our first
05:24 - name string is now cleared or update so
that's useful if you need to like clear
05:29 - out a form or some user input just use
the clear function the append function
05:34 - will allow you to add one string onto
another so a good use for this is that
05:40 - imagine that you are prompted for a
username and then we can actually append
05:46 - an email extension to the end of that to
create an email address so let's create
05:50 - a string called email and this will hold
the newly appended string so we will
05:56 - append our username so user name so this
is the string that's getting a pendant
06:03 - to dot then append pred this is
semicolon make sure it's outside the
06:11 - parentheses though all right so we can
put a string in here to append to this
06:15 - username our first string so let's add a
gmail.com email address and then we're
06:22 - just going to display this okay enter
your user name I'll type in bro your
06:31 - email is now bro at gmail.com I'm pretty
sure that's taken the app function will
06:37 - return a character at a
given index that you specify so we're
06:41 - going to write a program that will
extract the initials from a first name a
06:46 - middle name and a last name so let's
create a chart variable so this returns
06:53 - a character value so we'll call this
char value perhaps letter 1 equals then
07:01 - your first underscore name then at the
next we need to place a position of
07:09 - which letter we want to check or extract
if you want the very first character or
07:15 - a letter just put in a 0 because it's a
computer science thing like all arrays
07:20 - basically or strings start at index 0
all right so then let's do the same
07:26 - thing for the middle name and the last
name so let's call this letter two
07:34 - middle name
ladder three last name and then let's
07:41 - display this see out your initials R
then we will display letter one letter
07:54 - two and letter three okay
08:05 - and to your first name bro and to your
middle name I'm going to make up
08:11 - something Mac's like maximum and last
name Washington your initials are BMW
08:20 - and if we change the index for this app
function we would actually extract a
08:25 - different letter so let's see what our
initials are now so bro max Washington
08:39 - my initials are raw because it's the
technically the second character within
08:46 - each of these string variables now so
that's how you can check to see which
08:51 - character is at a certain position in a
string and then this function will
08:56 - return that as a character that you can
use for other things the substring
09:01 - function will return a portion of a
string and it's called a substring so an
09:06 - example of this let's create a program
that you'll enter in a first name and
09:11 - then we'll take a small sample of that
and create a nickname for you so let's
09:18 - create a string named nick name let's
say that we want to take the first three
09:23 - letters of your name and create a
substring out of it called nickname so
09:27 - we'll type in the string that we want to
use
09:30 - so first underscore name dot sub STR for
substring then a set of parentheses
09:38 - semicolon okay so there's two things
that we're going to want to fill out the
09:42 - first is the starting position so let's
say that we want to start this substring
09:48 - at the first character of your first
name we're going to put 0 here let's say
09:53 - that we want to retrieve the first three
letters perhaps so we'll put three here
09:59 - if you want four letters then just put
four so let's stick with three then and
10:03 - then we're just going to display this
nickname let's try this
10:11 - and to your first name let's type in my
full user name of burrow me feeis and it
10:18 - says your nickname is bro hello bro
okay so we can actually change where we
10:24 - want to take our sample for our
substring let's say that we want to move
10:29 - this to position three and we want to
extend this for five characters now so
10:36 - we're going to take another sample of
our first name our string and we'll get
10:42 - a different substring then so Prometheus
I don't know what this is gonna be your
10:48 - nickname is meth like crystal meth I
guess the insert function is very
10:53 - similar to the append function but we
can take a string and then place it
10:59 - anywhere within another string we just
have to give the position in which we
11:03 - want to insert this other string so this
actually doesn't return anything and
11:08 - this insert function doesn't actually
return anything
11:11 - it currently edits the string that
you're currently working on so let's
11:15 - take our username dot then insert set of
parentheses so there's two fields to
11:23 - fill out the first is the position in
which you want to insert something so
11:28 - let's say that we want to insert a
string or a character at the very first
11:33 - position so we're going to put 0 comma
then what we want to insert let's say
11:37 - that we want to insert the @ symbol like
we're replying to somebody so we'll just
11:42 - put this index at 0 then and then we'll
insert this at sign this string so let's
11:48 - try this enter your user name bro code
and it inserted a @ symbol before our
12:01 - actual user name at index 0 so let's
place this somewhere else how about at
12:06 - position 3
12:14 - so let's try this again
fro code and to place this at symbol at
12:20 - position three within our string so it's
kind of like we pushed these two parts
12:26 - of our string to the side and it
inserted this right in the middle this
12:29 - find function is very useful because you
can search for something within another
12:34 - string and it will return the first
instance of that substring that you
12:40 - specify so let's create a program where
we have somebody enter in their first
12:45 - name or a username and then we can
search for a certain character or a
12:49 - string and return where it found that
certain character so this is kind of
12:54 - like you're on a web page and then you
can use that find feature to find some
12:59 - sort of text on the web page and it's
going to return where it found that
13:03 - first instance of that certain text that
you specified so it's the same concept
13:08 - really so this will return a integer
value and we'll call this position
13:14 - equals we want to search our first
string that was called first underscore
13:21 - name dot find and what we want to find
we'll find a substring our variable
13:30 - substring all right so let's run this so
we can actually decide on what we want
13:36 - to search for with this enter your first
name I'm just going to type in bro code
13:43 - which search for which character I want
to find any C's in here capital C's it
13:50 - found this character at position 3 so 0
1 2 3 that's kind of cool right so this
13:58 - is the erase function we can erase a
portion of a string one use for this so
14:04 - do you know with phone numbers how they
usually begin with an area code well
14:08 - let's prompt for the user to enter in a
phone number and then we'll erase the
14:13 - area code leaving whatever the rest is
so we'll use the string phone number dot
14:21 - erase then we need to place a starting
position of starting index
14:26 - let's say we want to erase the first
four characters so it's going to start
14:31 - at position zero and we're going to
erase four characters from the string
14:35 - okay and then we'll display it at the
end okay and to your phone number I'm
14:43 - just going to make up something with an
area code so perhaps one zero one one
14:51 - two three four five six seven okay our
new phone number is one two three four
15:00 - five six seven and it erased the first
four characters of our phone number so
15:05 - it erased that area code basically so
we're about out of time there's still
15:11 - many more functions that we haven't
covered but if we did we'd probably be
15:15 - here all day so instead I'll link a
resource to basically a web page that
15:21 - contains more functions that you may or
may not be interested in but there's
15:26 - still a lot more that we haven't covered
these are just a few and then if you
15:29 - have some free time feel free to browse
the resource I'll give you if you want
15:34 - to learn a few more I'll post the source
code that we worked on in the comments
15:38 - down below and pin it to the top but
yeah that's the basics of using string
15:44 - functions and C++
