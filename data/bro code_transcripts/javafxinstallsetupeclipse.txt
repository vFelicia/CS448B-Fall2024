00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:02 - bro hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video i'm going to explain how we can
00:05 - install
00:06 - and set up java fx for eclipse so
00:09 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:14 - if you wouldn't mind please like comment
00:16 - and subscribe
00:17 - one like equals one prayer for the
00:19 - youtube algorithm
00:21 - all right people so i have listed seven
00:24 - steps which we need to follow in order
00:26 - to get
00:26 - java fx up and running so i'll include
00:29 - these steps in the description down
00:31 - below as well as any relevant links so
00:33 - be sure to look in the description
00:35 - all right people step one is to download
00:38 - the java fx
00:39 - sdk you can just google this java fx
00:42 - then go to the first link
00:44 - this is the url open jfx dot io
00:48 - so on this webpage scroll down to
00:50 - getting started
00:51 - then go to visit and then select the
00:55 - correct
00:55 - java fx version for your ide
00:58 - in this video we're covering eclipse but
01:00 - we'll cover intellij idea next
01:02 - so java fx and eclipse then go to
01:05 - non modular from ide and click
01:09 - this link javafx sdk this should bring
01:12 - you to another web page
01:15 - gluonhq.com products javafx
01:18 - scroll down to latest release and select
01:22 - the correct sdk for your operating
01:24 - system i'm running windows so i'm going
01:26 - to select
01:27 - java fx windows x64 sdk
01:31 - and click download now you should have
01:34 - a zip file so what i'm going to do is
01:36 - extract this by right clicking on this
01:38 - file
01:39 - then go to extract all and you'll want
01:42 - to extract this to a location that
01:44 - you'll remember
01:45 - i'm just going to keep this my downloads
01:46 - folder and
01:48 - click extract then give it a minute
01:51 - well my file is now extracted so
01:53 - remember the location of where you
01:55 - extracted this file to
01:57 - because that's going to be important
01:58 - later step two is to install the
02:01 - javafx plugin and we can do so by going
02:03 - to
02:04 - help eclipse marketplace
02:07 - we are going to find f x
02:11 - go and we are looking for
02:14 - e f x clips click install
02:20 - read the license agreement yes i
02:22 - actually did read it that fast
02:24 - i accept the terms of the license
02:26 - agreements and finish
02:28 - you may need to restart eclipse so
02:30 - that's unfortunate
02:31 - step three let's create a new java fx
02:34 - project
02:35 - let's go to file new project
02:40 - javafx javafx project
02:43 - next we need a name for this project
02:46 - i will call this hello fx but call it
02:49 - whatever you want
02:51 - and then finish within my package
02:54 - explorer i now have
02:55 - a javafx project which i called hellofx
02:59 - if i were to open this within my source
03:02 - folder
03:02 - and within the application package i
03:05 - have two files
03:06 - a java file called main as well as a css
03:10 - file called application for some css
03:12 - styling
03:13 - this main java file has some pre-written
03:16 - code to create a
03:17 - basic window for us however we first
03:20 - need to create and set a user library
03:23 - that contains the executable jars that
03:25 - we downloaded from that sdk
03:27 - you can see that if we try and run this
03:29 - currently we have all of these warnings
03:31 - if i were to attempt to run this we're
03:34 - going to run into an
03:35 - issue error occurred during
03:37 - initialization of boot layer
03:38 - module javafx controls not found
03:42 - to resolve this issue we need to create
03:44 - and set
03:45 - a user library step 4 is to create a
03:48 - user library
03:49 - let's go to window preferences
03:52 - then under java go to build path
03:57 - user libraries
04:00 - let's pretend that this wasn't here so
04:02 - let's remove that go to
04:04 - new we need a user library name let's
04:07 - call this
04:08 - java fx select ok
04:12 - add external jars what we're doing now
04:15 - is looking
04:16 - for that sdk that we extracted so
04:19 - remember that location of where you
04:20 - extracted
04:21 - those files to for me that's under
04:23 - downloads
04:26 - here it is then go to javafx sdk
04:30 - then under the library folder i'm going
04:32 - to
04:33 - select all of these executable jar files
04:37 - open apply and close
04:40 - step five is to set the library
04:43 - right click on your javafx project
04:46 - folder
04:47 - then go to build path add libraries
04:52 - user library next select
04:55 - java fx finish
04:58 - and you did everything right all of
05:00 - those red warnings should go away
05:03 - step six let's configure the build path
05:05 - right click on your project folder
05:07 - go to build path configure build path
05:10 - all we're doing is making sure that we
05:12 - have
05:13 - java fx under class path if you're
05:16 - missing this for some reason
05:17 - let's say we remove this well we can add
05:20 - that back
05:21 - by going to class path add library user
05:24 - library
05:25 - next check java fx finish
05:28 - so you'll just want to be sure that you
05:30 - have javafx underneath classpath if you
05:32 - already have it there's nothing more
05:34 - that you need to do
05:35 - apply then apply and close step seven is
05:37 - to add
05:38 - virtual machine arguments we need to
05:40 - copy a line of text
05:42 - from that webpage where we downloaded
05:44 - the java sdk
05:46 - so this is the url under java fx and
05:49 - eclipse
05:50 - under the subcategory of non-modular
05:53 - from ide
05:54 - scroll down to the section regarding
05:56 - adding vm
05:57 - arguments there are two lines of text
06:00 - one if you're using
06:01 - linux or mac copy this line of text
06:04 - if you're using windows copy this other
06:06 - line of text
06:07 - i'm running windows so i'm going to copy
06:09 - this line of text
06:10 - i'll also include these in the
06:12 - description down below for this video so
06:13 - you don't have to navigate to this
06:15 - webpage
06:15 - since i'm a nice guy so once you copy
06:18 - this line of text
06:18 - let's head back to our ide now to add a
06:22 - virtual machine argument
06:23 - right click on your project folder then
06:26 - go to
06:26 - run as run configurations
06:30 - make sure that your project is selected
06:32 - if not you can select it on the left
06:34 - hand menu here
06:35 - under the arguments tab go to vm
06:38 - arguments
06:39 - and paste all of that text that you
06:41 - copied but there's going to be
06:43 - one change that we need to make to this
06:45 - we need to change
06:46 - the path to the library folder of the
06:49 - sdk
06:49 - that we downloaded so we'll need to find
06:52 - that locate where you extracted
06:54 - that java sdk folder to
06:57 - locate the library folder and then i am
07:00 - going to
07:01 - get this file path i'm going to right
07:03 - click
07:04 - then copy address everything within the
07:08 - quotes i'm going to delete
07:10 - and paste the location of where that
07:13 - library folder is
07:15 - apply and run if everything checks out
07:19 - after running this program you should
07:20 - have a small window that appears
07:22 - this will serve as the foundation for
07:25 - our java fx
07:26 - gui applications alright everybody
07:28 - that's the basics of installing and
07:30 - setting up
07:31 - javafx for eclipse i do plan on a
07:34 - separate video on doing the same thing
07:36 - for intellij idea if you would like a
07:39 - copy of all these steps
07:40 - and the appropriate links i will include
07:42 - those in the description down below
07:44 - but yeah that's how to install and set
07:46 - up java fx
07:48 - for eclipse hey you yeah i'm talking to
07:52 - you
07:52 - if you learned something new then help
