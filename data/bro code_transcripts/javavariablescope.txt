00:00 - hey how's it going everybody it's your
00:01 - bro hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video i'm going to teach you guys the
00:04 - difference between
00:05 - local and global variables and objects
00:08 - in java so
00:08 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:13 - if you find this video helpful please
00:15 - remember to like
00:16 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:19 - help keep this channel running
00:21 - alright guys and gals i'm going to
00:22 - explain the difference between local and
00:24 - global
00:25 - variables and objects so anything that
00:27 - is local is declared
00:29 - inside a method and is visible only to
00:32 - that method
00:33 - anything that is global is declared
00:35 - outside
00:36 - a method but within a class and is
00:39 - visible to
00:40 - all parts of a class including any
00:42 - methods found within that class
00:44 - here's an example we're going to create
00:46 - a program where we will roll
00:47 - a dice so let's handle that with an
00:50 - additional class
00:51 - so let's go to file new class
00:54 - and i will call this class dice roller
00:57 - click finish i need to create an
00:59 - instance of this class
01:01 - so within my main method i'm going to
01:02 - create an instance of my dice roller
01:05 - class
01:05 - dice roller i'll call this instance dice
01:08 - roller for short
01:09 - equals new dice roller
01:12 - within our dice roller class we'll
01:14 - create a constructor for this class
01:16 - it's the same name as the class name
01:18 - plus a method
01:19 - to roll a dice for us so the return type
01:21 - is void
01:22 - and we'll call this method
01:25 - we'll need to declare a few things an
01:27 - instance of the random class
01:29 - plus an integer variable to hold our
01:31 - result
01:32 - so let's create an instance of the
01:33 - random class random
01:35 - random equals new random
01:39 - we'll need an import as well so include
01:42 - that
01:42 - import java.util.random and
01:46 - an integer variable and we'll call this
01:47 - number int
01:49 - number and we'll set the sql to zero for
01:51 - now and lastly within the constructor
01:53 - we'll call
01:54 - the roll method so let's set up the roll
01:57 - method
01:58 - we're going to take our number variable
02:00 - set the sequel to
02:02 - random dot next int we want the numbers
02:06 - 1 through six so we'll pass in six to
02:09 - this method of next int
02:11 - plus one and we're adding plus one
02:13 - because we would normally get the
02:14 - numbers
02:15 - zero through five and then with a print
02:17 - line statement we'll display our number
02:20 - to the console window here's the issue
02:22 - we're running into
02:23 - both our instance of the random class
02:25 - plus our integer number
02:27 - variable are local to our constructor
02:31 - so anything that is local is declared
02:33 - inside a method and visible only to that
02:35 - method
02:36 - well our constructor counts as a method
02:38 - so the instance of the random class
02:40 - and our number are only visible to
02:43 - anything within
02:44 - our constructor our roll method does not
02:46 - have access
02:47 - to our instance of the random class plus
02:49 - our number there are two ways in which
02:51 - we can solve this
02:52 - one is that we can pass these as
02:54 - arguments to
02:56 - a method and the other way is that we
02:58 - can declare these
02:59 - as global so let's begin by passing
03:01 - these as arguments
03:02 - so we're going to pass our instance of
03:04 - the random class plus our number as
03:06 - arguments to our role method so let's do
03:08 - that we're going to pass random
03:10 - and number to our roll method but we'll
03:12 - need to set up some parameters
03:15 - this will accept a random argument as
03:17 - well as an
03:18 - integer argument and we'll call this
03:20 - number so this will work just fine then
03:23 - so we have a 4 and a 4
03:27 - and a 6. so the other way in which we
03:30 - can write this i'm just going to reverse
03:31 - our changes
03:32 - we can declare our instance of the
03:34 - random class and our integer
03:36 - number variable as global these are
03:39 - declared outside a method
03:41 - but within a class and it's visible to
03:43 - all parts of a class
03:45 - so in place of declaring these inside of
03:47 - the constructor for the dice roller
03:49 - we're going to declare our instance of
03:51 - the random class
03:52 - and our number outside of this method
03:55 - our constructor and with our random
03:57 - class we'll finish instantiating this
03:59 - within the constructor so let's declare
04:02 - random outside of the constructor as
04:04 - well as our number
04:05 - outside the constructor as well so now
04:09 - our row method has access to our
04:12 - instance of the random class plus our
04:13 - number
04:14 - because these are global they are
04:16 - declared outside of the method but
04:18 - within a class
04:19 - technically we don't even really need to
04:21 - assign a value anymore to our number we
04:23 - can simply just declare these
04:25 - so this will work just the same as it
04:27 - did before it's just another way of
04:29 - writing this program
04:30 - we rolled the five and we rolled the
04:32 - four so that's the main difference
04:34 - between
04:35 - local and global anything that is local
04:37 - is declared inside
04:38 - a method and visible only to that method
04:41 - anything that is global
04:42 - is declared outside a method but within
04:45 - a class
04:46 - and is visible to all parts of a class
04:49 - so that's the differences between
04:51 - local and global items in java if you
04:53 - would like a copy of this code i will
04:55 - post all of this in the comments down
04:56 - below
04:57 - but yeah that's the main differences
04:58 - between local and global items
05:00 - in java hey you
05:03 - yeah i'm talking to you if you learn
05:05 - something new then you can help
05:07 - me help you in three easy steps
05:10 - by smashing that like button drop a
