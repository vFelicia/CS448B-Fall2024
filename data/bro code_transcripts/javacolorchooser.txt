00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well and in
00:02 - this video i'm going to teach you guys
00:04 - how we can use the
00:05 - j color chooser class in java to color
00:07 - components
00:08 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - if you find this video helpful please
00:14 - remember to like comment
00:16 - and subscribe your support will help
00:18 - keep this channel running
00:20 - okay let's get started everybody so
00:21 - we're going to be discussing the
00:23 - j color chooser class this is a good
00:25 - mechanism that lets a user choose a
00:27 - color
00:28 - so here's an example of my setup i have
00:30 - two classes a class called main that
00:32 - contains my main method
00:34 - and a new instance of my other class
00:36 - called my frame
00:37 - so my frame extends jframe and
00:39 - implements the action listener interface
00:41 - i have a constructor called my frame
00:44 - within the constructor i have
00:45 - this dot set default close operation j
00:47 - frame x on close
00:49 - i'm using a new flow layout followed by
00:51 - this dot pack and this dot set visible
00:53 - to true
00:54 - i also have an action performed method
00:55 - for when we click on a button
00:57 - we're going to change either the
00:59 - background color or the font color of a
01:01 - label
01:02 - so let's declare a button and a label so
01:04 - let's declare these outside of the
01:06 - constructor so that they're globally
01:08 - available to our action performed method
01:10 - so we'll create a j button
01:12 - j button let's call this button as well
01:14 - as a label so j
01:15 - label called label and then we will
01:18 - finish instantiating these within the
01:20 - constructor
01:21 - so button equals new j
01:25 - button and i'm going to set some text
01:27 - right away
01:28 - just by passing in a string to the
01:30 - constructor of the j button
01:32 - i will say pick a color
01:36 - alright let's create a label so that is
01:40 - label equals new j
01:43 - label but this has to be capital
01:48 - okay i'm also going to set the
01:50 - background color
01:51 - so label dot set background
01:56 - and then we can pick a color maybe just
01:58 - white so color dot white
02:00 - so in order to display the background
02:02 - color we need to
02:04 - set opaque true so set opaque
02:07 - and we're going to pass in true let's
02:10 - also set some text and the font
02:12 - so label dot set text
02:17 - this is some text good enough
02:21 - let's also change the font too because
02:22 - this is going to be fairly small so
02:25 - label dot set font and we can pass in a
02:28 - new font
02:30 - pick whatever font you want i will pick
02:33 - one of my favorites which is
02:34 - mv bowling you can style this i'm just
02:38 - going to set this to plane
02:39 - and then a size i want something massive
02:42 - like 100
02:43 - and that's all there is to it oh then we
02:45 - have to add an action listener to this
02:46 - button so button
02:47 - dot add action listener and i'm going to
02:51 - pass
02:51 - in this because we're implementing the
02:54 - action listener interface
02:55 - and then we need to add this button and
02:57 - this label to the frame
02:59 - so this dot add we're going to add the
03:01 - button
03:02 - followed by the label so this dot add
03:06 - label then we should be good
03:10 - all right so all we have is a button
03:13 - and then some text this is our label so
03:16 - when we click on our button
03:18 - we're going to launch a new instance of
03:19 - our j color chooser
03:21 - so if e dot get source
03:25 - is equal to our button then we're going
03:29 - to declare and instantiate a
03:31 - new color chooser so in order to do that
03:34 - we're going to declare
03:35 - j color chooser and we will call this
03:39 - instance
03:40 - color chooser or whatever you want
03:43 - equals
03:44 - new j color chooser
03:50 - so this will create a new instance of
03:52 - our j color chooser but we need to
03:54 - create a
03:55 - dialog box so we can actually assign
03:58 - that to a new color whatever this
04:00 - returns
04:01 - so color we'll call this color equals
04:05 - j color chooser dot
04:08 - show dialogue so
04:12 - for the arguments this takes a parent
04:14 - component a title
04:15 - and an initial color so for the parent
04:17 - component we're just going to set this
04:19 - to null because we don't have one
04:20 - we can set a title so pick
04:24 - a color i guess
04:27 - and then an initial color like what do
04:29 - you want the default to be
04:30 - so i'll just say color.black
04:36 - so this will create a dialogue for us
04:39 - and when we run this
04:40 - and click on our button to pick a color
04:43 - it's going to open this menu and it has
04:46 - our title
04:46 - pick a color i guess okay
04:49 - so we can pick a color and we can click
04:52 - ok this has a few other options too
04:54 - i don't really know what this crap is
04:55 - but feel free to mess with these
04:57 - settings
04:57 - so let's say i want this green color
04:59 - then i click ok
05:00 - well we have this color stored within
05:03 - our color
05:04 - called color coincidentally now we need
05:07 - to
05:07 - actually change the color of whatever it
05:10 - is we want to color
05:11 - so let's change the foreground color of
05:13 - our label first
05:14 - so label dot set foreground
05:17 - that's the font color and we're going to
05:19 - pass in our color that we select
05:22 - so now when we run this and we pick a
05:25 - color
05:27 - let's say i want that green color again
05:29 - i think it was something like that and
05:30 - click ok
05:31 - it's now going to change the foreground
05:33 - color we can also change the background
05:36 - color too
05:36 - of whatever component that we want so
05:39 - i'm going to change
05:40 - the background of our label so label dot
05:42 - set
05:43 - background and we're going to pick that
05:45 - color again
05:51 - so let's pick i don't know pink
05:55 - and the background is now pink so you
05:57 - don't necessarily
05:58 - have to do this with labels you can do
06:00 - this with all sorts of components but
06:02 - a label is kind of convenient just
06:03 - because you can add text to a label and
06:05 - you can also change the background color
06:07 - well that's the very basics of the j
06:10 - color chooser class
06:11 - if you want to copy of all this code
06:13 - i'll post all of this in the comments
06:14 - down below
06:15 - but yeah that's the basics of the j
06:17 - color chooser class in java
06:20 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
06:23 - learn something new
06:24 - then you can help me help you in three
06:27 - easy steps
06:28 - by smashing that like button drop a
