00:02 - all right what's going on people
00:03 - so in this video i'm going to show you
00:05 - all how we can create an array of
00:06 - objects
00:07 - i have a class car cars have one field a
00:10 - model field
00:11 - and a constructor to assign an argument
00:13 - to this
00:14 - model field so let's create some car
00:16 - objects car
00:17 - car one equals new car then pass into
00:21 - model of your choosing
00:22 - let's say that car one will be a mustang
00:25 - and let's create maybe two more cars
00:27 - car two and car 3. car 2 will be
00:31 - a corvette and car 3 will be a lambo
00:35 - so we'll need an array to work with too
00:38 - so in the past when we've created arrays
00:40 - we will list the data type of what we're
00:41 - storing within our array like strings
00:44 - ins whatever so after the data type add
00:46 - a set of
00:47 - straight brackets but the data type is
00:49 - going to be the data type of the objects
00:52 - that we're working with
00:53 - since we're working with car objects
00:55 - we'll change that to car
00:57 - car straight brackets then we need a
00:59 - name for this array let's say garage
01:01 - it's kind of like we're parking cars
01:02 - within a garage
01:03 - equals new the data type again straight
01:06 - brackets
01:07 - then a size for this array let's say
01:09 - three then we will assign
01:11 - some of these indexes with an object so
01:14 - let's begin with garage at index
01:16 - zero this will equal let's say car one
01:19 - it's as if car one is parking within our
01:22 - garage at
01:22 - this parking spot number of zero then
01:25 - let's park
01:26 - car two and car three so garage at index
01:29 - of one
01:29 - equals car two garage at index of two
01:33 - equals car three then let's display
01:35 - these
01:36 - console.right line garage at index
01:40 - of zero so let me just show you what
01:42 - this looks like first we're not
01:43 - accessing the model quite yet we're just
01:45 - displaying whatever's within garage at
01:47 - index of zero
01:48 - and what we get is the namespace
01:51 - followed by the data type
01:52 - of our object so if we need the model of
01:55 - this object whatever's within garage at
01:57 - index of zero
01:58 - i'm going to follow this with dot model
02:02 - and that will display my car's model
02:04 - which is a mustang
02:06 - then let's do the same thing for garage
02:08 - at index of one and two
02:10 - so garage index of one garage index of
02:13 - two
02:13 - then make sure to follow those with dot
02:15 - model
02:16 - so within our garage between indexes
02:19 - zero through two we have a mustang
02:21 - corvette and a lambo now another way in
02:24 - which we could display these is with
02:26 - a for each loop for each parentheses
02:29 - curly braces and with our for each loop
02:32 - we have to list the
02:33 - data type of whatever's within our array
02:36 - car and let's call each car just car
02:39 - car car in garage
02:43 - then during each iteration we will
02:44 - display
02:46 - car dot model and that will do the same
02:50 - thing
02:50 - however this time we will iterate
02:52 - through our array
02:53 - now there's another way in which we can
02:55 - write this too we don't need to
02:56 - necessarily
02:57 - define a size for our array then create
03:00 - some named car objects
03:02 - and then assign those objects directly
03:03 - to each index we could just declare an
03:06 - array
03:06 - and then immediately instantiate some
03:08 - objects all in one step
03:09 - so we're going to create a new array car
03:12 - straight brackets i will call this
03:14 - garage
03:15 - equals curly braces and then we will
03:18 - pass
03:18 - in just new car then you need to pass in
03:21 - a model
03:24 - and do the same thing with your other
03:25 - two cars
03:28 - okay this will do the same thing it's
03:30 - just written in less steps
03:32 - so these are known as anonymous objects
03:35 - they don't technically have a name
03:36 - so i may or may not make a separate
03:38 - video on anonymous objects so within our
03:40 - garage we should have a
03:42 - mustang corvette and a lambo so yeah
03:45 - that's how to create an array of objects
03:47 - in c sharp
