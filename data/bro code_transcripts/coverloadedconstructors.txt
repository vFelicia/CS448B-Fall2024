00:02 - all right overloaded constructors
00:04 - by using overloaded constructors this is
00:06 - a technique to create
00:07 - multiple constructors within the same
00:09 - class much like that video on overloaded
00:12 - methods
00:12 - so with overloaded constructors multiple
00:15 - constructors can have the same name
00:17 - but they need a different set of
00:18 - parameters because a method's name
00:21 - plus its parameters equals a unique
00:23 - method signature
00:24 - and each method must have their own
00:26 - unique signature
00:28 - so let's create a class named pizza
00:33 - and there's going to be four fields
00:35 - let's have string bread
00:36 - for the type of bread we would like for
00:38 - our pizza like is it
00:39 - flatbread stuffed crust plain
00:44 - a field for sauce cheese
00:47 - and topping
00:51 - then let's create a constructor
00:54 - public pizza
00:58 - and then we need to set up the
00:59 - parameters
01:01 - string bread string sauce
01:05 - string cheese and
01:08 - string topping and then we'll need to
01:10 - assign these
01:12 - this dot bread equals bread
01:16 - this dot sauce equals sauce
01:19 - this dot cheese equals cheese
01:23 - and this dot topping equals
01:28 - topping all right then let's construct a
01:32 - pizza object
01:34 - pizza let's call this pizza all lower
01:36 - case
01:37 - equals new pizza then we need to pass
01:41 - in something for the bread the sauce the
01:43 - cheese and the topping
01:44 - because we can't construct a pizza
01:47 - object without
01:48 - bread sauce cheese and a topping we need
01:51 - all four
01:52 - in order to construct a pizza object so
01:55 - let's pass in something for the bread
01:57 - let's say i would like a stuffed crust
01:59 - pizza stuffed crust
02:01 - for the sauce let's say red sauce
02:05 - and the cheese what about mozzarella i
02:08 - don't remember how to spell mozzarella
02:11 - mozzarella i'm taking a guess here
02:14 - and a topping pepperoni
02:18 - so we can construct a pizza object just
02:21 - fine right
02:22 - but what if we would like a pizza
02:24 - without any toppings like a plain cheese
02:26 - pizza
02:26 - so i'm going to get rid of that topping
02:28 - well we can't construct a pizza without
02:30 - a topping we need to add something
02:32 - because we only have one constructor set
02:34 - up and we need to pass in something for
02:37 - a topping
02:38 - so one way in which we can solve this
02:39 - problem is to have multiple constructors
02:42 - overloaded constructors we can pass in a
02:45 - varying amount of arguments
02:46 - so if we would like a cheese pizza
02:48 - without any toppings
02:49 - we can use that specific constructor
02:51 - that will construct a
02:53 - plain cheese pizza so let's copy this
02:55 - constructor
02:56 - they can have the same name but they
02:58 - need a different set of parameters
03:00 - so i'm going to remove this topping
03:02 - parameter
03:04 - and we will not assign this.topping
03:06 - equals topping
03:07 - and we can now create a plain cheese
03:10 - pizza
03:10 - and let's do the same thing with i don't
03:12 - know maybe somebody doesn't want cheese
03:14 - on their pizza
03:17 - so pizza with only bread and sauce
03:23 - and then another pizza with only bread
03:26 - i'm not even really sure if it's
03:27 - considered a pizza then maybe it's
03:28 - garlic bread or something
03:30 - but i don't know though we can now
03:31 - create a pizza object that has
03:33 - no toppings no cheese and no sauce
03:37 - so by using overload constructors we can
03:40 - construct objects with
03:41 - varying amounts of fields maybe we would
03:44 - like toppings
03:44 - maybe we don't well we have a choice now
03:47 - so yeah that's overload constructors
03:49 - it's a technique to create multiple
03:51 - constructors with a different set of
03:53 - parameters
03:54 - they can share the same name but you
03:56 - need a different set of parameters
03:58 - because a constructor's name plus its
04:00 - parameters
04:01 - equals a constructor's signature and
04:04 - each constructor needs a unique
04:05 - signature so yeah those are overloaded
04:08 - constructors in c
04:09 - sharp if this video helped you out help
04:11 - me out by smashing that like button
04:13 - leave a random comment down below and
04:14 - well yeah those are overloaded
04:16 - constructors
04:17 - in c sharp
