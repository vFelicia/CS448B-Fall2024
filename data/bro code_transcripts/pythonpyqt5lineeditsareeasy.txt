00:00 - why hello everybody today I got to
00:02 - explain line edit widgets in pi qt5 also
00:05 - known as textboxes in pretty much
00:08 - anything ever made ever why are they
00:10 - called line edit widgets I really don't
00:12 - know let's begin from the module of QT
00:15 - widgets we will import the following
00:17 - class of q line edit to create a text
00:23 - box I mean a line edit
00:25 - widget we are accessing our window of
00:28 - self we will call this line edit widget
00:32 - line
00:34 - edit equals call The Constructor of the
00:37 - class q line
00:39 - edit then we will pass in self to add
00:43 - this line edit widget to the
00:46 - window let's set the geometry but we do
00:49 - have a text box in which we can type in
00:53 - stuff I have a method to initialize the
00:56 - user
00:57 - interface within this method I will
01:00 - access self do the line edit widget and
01:05 - set the
01:07 - geometry let's set it in the top left
01:10 - corner where X is 10 Y is 10 set a width
01:14 - 200 is good and a height
01:18 - 40 that's not too bad now the text is
01:22 - really
01:22 - small we can change that by applying a
01:26 - stylesheet access our window with self
01:29 - access access our line edit widget then
01:32 - call the set stylesheet
01:37 - method we can pass in some CSS like
01:40 - properties including a font
01:43 - size let's pick 25
01:47 - pixels and here's my new text box we can
01:50 - read the text now let's also change the
01:54 - font
01:56 - family font family I will pick
02:01 - aial this text box by itself it really
02:04 - doesn't do anything we need some way to
02:07 - get the text from the text box let's add
02:10 - a button when we click on the button we
02:13 - will get the text from the text box and
02:15 - do something with it cuz right now it
02:17 - doesn't do
02:19 - anything we will need to import Q push
02:24 - button let's create one button self.
02:28 - button equals
02:30 - call The Constructor of the class Q push
02:34 - button let's say that this is a submit
02:36 - button I will pass in a string of submit
02:40 - and we are adding this button to our
02:43 - window and we do need to set the
02:45 - geometry of the button we're not using a
02:48 - layout manager right
02:50 - now access our window with self access
02:54 - our button that we have previously
02:56 - created in our
02:58 - Constructor then call these set geometry
03:02 - method we'll place our button where X is
03:05 - 210 Y is 10 the width will be
03:09 - 100 and the height will be
03:13 - 40 not too bad let's change the font
03:16 - size of the button I'll copy these two
03:19 - lines of code because I'm
03:21 - lazy instead of selecting our line edit
03:24 - widget we will select our button
03:29 - that's better if I were to click on the
03:32 - button it doesn't do
03:34 - anything we'll set up the signal of
03:36 - clicked to connect to a method that will
03:39 - do
03:41 - something let's define a method of
03:43 - submit we're submitting something we're
03:46 - submitting the text within the text box
03:49 - and for now I'll write pass we'll get
03:51 - back to this in a
03:53 - second we're going to take our button
03:55 - self. button we'll connect the signal of
04:00 - clicked clicked. connect method we will
04:04 - connect the method of submit self.
04:08 - submit so when we click on the button we
04:11 - will call this method let's print a test
04:15 - message you clicked the
04:20 - button let's type in
04:22 - something press submit and we get our
04:25 - test message you clicked the
04:28 - button let's get the text from the text
04:31 - box then do something with
04:34 - it let's create a local variable of text
04:38 - text equals now we have to get the text
04:41 - from our line edit widget
04:44 - self. line edit that's the widget to get
04:49 - the text we can use the text method to
04:52 - return the
04:53 - text then let's print the text I'll use
04:57 - an FST string we'll say hello add a
05:01 - placeholder then display the
05:04 - text so
