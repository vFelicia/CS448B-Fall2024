00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:02 - bro hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video we're going to cover
00:05 - if statements in c sharp
00:06 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - all right people if statements an if
00:14 - statement is
00:15 - a basic form of decision making if some
00:17 - condition that we specify is true
00:20 - we can execute a block of code if it's
00:22 - not true we can do something else
00:23 - entirely
00:24 - so let's write a small program where we
00:26 - will ask a user to enter in their edge
00:29 - and depending on their age we can write
00:31 - an if statement that checks to see if
00:32 - somebody is 18 years or older
00:34 - let's say that a user is signing up for
00:36 - a credit card and you have to be 18
00:38 - years or older
00:39 - so if their age is greater than or equal
00:41 - to 18
00:42 - we will display a message that says
00:44 - you're now signed up if they're less
00:46 - than 18 we can do something else
00:48 - so to write an if statement we just
00:50 - write if then parentheses to hold some
00:52 - sort of condition
00:53 - which we would like to evaluate followed
00:55 - by a set of parentheses
00:57 - so if some condition that we set within
00:59 - the parentheses is true
01:00 - we will execute this block of code if
01:03 - it's not true we skip over it entirely
01:05 - so let's check to see if age is greater
01:07 - than or equal to 18
01:09 - then we will display something console
01:12 - that right line
01:14 - you are now signed up and
01:17 - let's try it please enter your age let's
01:20 - say that i'm 21 i hit enter
01:21 - boom you are now signed up now what if i
01:23 - enter in an edge that's less than 18.
01:26 - let's say that i'm 12 years old and i'm
01:27 - trying to sign up for a credit card well
01:29 - nothing appears to happen and that's
01:31 - normal
01:31 - so if this condition evaluates to be
01:34 - true we execute this block of code
01:36 - if it's false we skip over it entirely
01:39 - as if it never existed
01:40 - now we can take a different course of
01:42 - action if our above condition
01:44 - is false we can perform some other block
01:47 - of code
01:47 - so let's display a message that says you
01:49 - must be 18 years or older to sign
01:51 - up you must be 18 plus to sign
01:55 - up so if this condition is true we do
01:58 - this
01:58 - if it's false we do this so let's try it
02:00 - again
02:01 - please enter your edge let's say that
02:03 - i'm 12 i hit enter
02:04 - you must be 18 plus to sign up so if
02:07 - this
02:08 - is true do this if it's not true do this
02:10 - now between
02:11 - the if and else statements you can add
02:13 - an else if statement if there's more
02:15 - things they want to check before
02:16 - reaching the else block
02:18 - so the else block is kind of like a last
02:21 - resort if
02:22 - all above statements evaluate to be
02:24 - false let's check to see if somebody's
02:26 - age
02:27 - is less than zero else if age is less
02:30 - than
02:31 - zero then we will display a custom
02:33 - message
02:34 - such as you haven't
02:37 - been born yet please enter your age i am
02:41 - negative
02:42 - 12 years old you haven't been born yet
02:45 - with these else if statements you can
02:47 - add as many as you want between
02:49 - if and else let's add another so i will
02:51 - copy what we have
02:52 - let's check to see if somebody's age is
02:54 - greater than 100
02:56 - if it is then we'll say i don't know
02:57 - you're too old to sign up
02:59 - that's kind of mean i guess but it
03:01 - serves the purpose of this example
03:03 - so you are too old to sign
03:06 - up now we're going to run into one issue
03:09 - okay please enter your age i am 101
03:12 - years old
03:13 - you are now signed up now the reason
03:15 - that this block of code executed and not
03:18 - this one
03:18 - is that we're just going down in order
03:20 - starting from the top since
03:22 - age which was 101 is technically greater
03:25 - than or equal to 18.
03:27 - this condition evaluated to be true and
03:29 - we
03:30 - executed this block of code and skipped
03:32 - everything else after it and continued
03:34 - on with the rest of the program
03:35 - so if we first want to check to see if
03:37 - somebody's age is greater than
03:39 - 100 we should probably put that within
03:42 - the if statement and check that first
03:44 - because age is technically greater than
03:46 - or equal to 18 if we set age to be
03:48 - 101 else if we will check to see if age
03:52 - is greater than or equal to 18
03:54 - then we just have to change these lines
03:56 - of text around
03:58 - so you are too old to sign up so the
04:00 - order of
04:01 - these if statements and else if
04:03 - statements does matter
04:04 - and let's try it again okay please enter
04:07 - your age i am 101 years old
04:09 - you are too old to sign up all right now
04:11 - in this next example let's ask a user
04:14 - for their name instead of their age
04:16 - let's change int age to string name
04:19 - and we do not need to convert this
04:21 - because it's already a string
04:22 - so to check to see if somebody does not
04:24 - enter in some user input
04:26 - we can check to see if our variable name
04:30 - equals an empty set of quotes so this is
04:33 - an empty string
04:34 - now the reason that we're using two
04:36 - equal signs is that this is a comparison
04:39 - operator
04:39 - if you just use one that is an
04:41 - assignment operator
04:43 - c sharp thinks you're attempting to
04:45 - assign name with an empty string
04:47 - so we're comparing if these two are
04:50 - equal so that's why we use
04:51 - double equals so if name is equal to an
04:54 - empty string
04:55 - that means that somebody skipped over
04:57 - entering in some user input
04:58 - so let's yell at them you did
05:01 - not enter your name
05:04 - so if our name is not empty we can
05:08 - display
05:09 - maybe hello whatever the user's name is
05:11 - so
05:12 - hello plus name
05:16 - and let's try it
05:19 - okay please enter your name i'm just
05:21 - going to hit enter you did not enter
05:23 - your name
05:24 - let's run this again and take it
05:25 - seriously this time please enter your
05:27 - name
05:28 - bro hello bro now there's another way in
05:31 - which we could
05:32 - write this so instead of using this
05:34 - double equal sign we can use
05:36 - exclamation point equal sign that means
05:38 - not equals
05:39 - if name does not equal an empty string
05:42 - then we will display
05:43 - hello name else
05:46 - we will display you did not enter your
05:48 - name so we're checking to see if name is
05:51 - not equal to an empty string and if
05:53 - that's true display hello
05:55 - name okay please enter your name i'll
05:58 - hit enter
05:59 - you did not enter your name let's try it
06:01 - again please enter your name
06:03 - bro hello bro all right everybody those
06:06 - are if statements
06:07 - they're a very basic form of decision
06:09 - making we can check to see
06:10 - if some condition is true if it is true
06:13 - then we can do something
06:14 - if not we can do something else so if
06:16 - you would like a copy of both examples
06:18 - from this video i will post that code to
06:20 - the comment section down below
06:22 - and well those are if statements and see
06:24 - you sharp
