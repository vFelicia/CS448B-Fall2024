00:00 - hello again everyone today I will be
00:02 - explaining functions in MySQL a function
00:05 - is a stored program that you can pass
00:07 - parameters into to return a value if you
00:09 - look on mysql's main website there is a
00:12 - huge comprehensive list of functions in
00:14 - this video I'll only be showing you a
00:16 - few of the more useful ones for
00:17 - beginners but just so you know there's a
00:20 - lot of functions out there that do all
00:21 - sorts of things what if I would like to
00:23 - count how many transactions took place
00:25 - on a certain date to do that we can use
00:28 - the count function
00:30 - select count parentheses within my set
00:34 - of parentheses I can place a column then
00:36 - calculate how many rows are within that
00:38 - column let's calculate amount we will
00:41 - count how many rows are within the
00:42 - column amount
00:44 - then we will need a table from our table
00:47 - transactions so you could add a where
00:50 - Clause too like where transaction date
00:52 - is on a certain date but I want to keep
00:54 - this video as simple as possible
00:57 - this function will return all of the
00:59 - rows within this column amount which is
01:02 - five we have five transactions within
01:04 - this table now this column header is
01:07 - kind of ugly the column name is count
01:09 - the amount column you could give a
01:11 - column an alias by adding as then some
01:15 - nickname let's say count it's not
01:19 - necessary but if you want to make the
01:21 - column header look pretty or rename it
01:22 - as something you could do that
01:25 - count five we could even rename this
01:28 - column as
01:29 - today is
01:31 - transactions
01:34 - that works too do whatever you want to
01:36 - do
01:37 - let's find you the maximum value of our
01:40 - column amount by using the max function
01:43 - within the set of parentheses pass in
01:45 - your amount column I will give this
01:47 - column an alias of
01:50 - maximum
01:52 - and that is the maximum amount the
01:54 - largest order was 4.99 there's also Min
01:58 - to find the minimum
02:00 - as minimum
02:04 - the smallest order was for one dollar
02:07 - you could do average which is AVG
02:11 - as average the average order is three
02:15 - dollars and 45 cents
02:17 - we can find the sum of a column by using
02:19 - the sum function
02:21 - as some
02:24 - the sum of all of our transactions was
02:27 - 17 and 25 cents for this next example
02:30 - we're going to concatenate the first and
02:32 - last name of our employees
02:35 - select all from
02:37 - employees
02:39 - we have two columns one for a first name
02:42 - the other for a last name we're going to
02:44 - combine these two columns together with
02:46 - the concat function then create a new
02:49 - column named full name here's how to do
02:51 - that
02:54 - select
02:55 - concat
02:58 - first name
02:59 - last name
03:01 - then I'll add an alias as ball name
03:06 - here's what we have so far so we are
03:09 - concatenating the first and last names
03:10 - of our employees uh however we should
03:13 - separate each name with the space
03:15 - within our concat function
03:17 - I'll add a space character
03:20 - surrounded with commas to separate each
03:22 - argument
03:24 - there that's much better
03:26 - so that is the concat function we can
03:28 - concatenate values together such as if
03:30 - you need a column for somebody's full
03:32 - name but yeah those are just a few
03:34 - functions there's still many more we
03:36 - haven't covered but these are a few of
03:37 - the beginner ones you may be interested
03:39 - in but yeah those are functions in MySQL
