00:01 - okay guys in this video we're going to
00:04 - create a temperature conversion program
00:06 - to convert from fahrenheit to celsius or
00:09 - celsius to fahrenheit at the top of our
00:11 - program let's declare our variables
00:13 - double temp
00:15 - temp is short for temperature
00:17 - then char unit
00:19 - will the user select celsius or
00:21 - fahrenheit
00:22 - now with my programs i like to add a
00:24 - title at the beginning
00:26 - standard output
00:31 - temperature
00:33 - conversion
00:35 - it's totally not necessary but it's
00:37 - something that i like to do
00:39 - then i'll add another line of output at
00:41 - the end of my program to show the user
00:43 - that the program is over
00:45 - i'll just add a bunch of asterisks
00:47 - like i said totally not necessary but
00:49 - it's something i'd just like to do i
00:51 - will display a couple lines of output
00:55 - f
00:56 - equals
00:58 - fahrenheit
01:00 - i can never spell fahrenheit right i
01:02 - think that's okay
01:03 - i'll add a new line
01:06 - standard
01:08 - output
01:09 - c equals
01:12 - celsius
01:14 - add a new line
01:17 - standard output
01:21 - what unit
01:22 - would
01:24 - you like to convert
01:27 - to
01:32 - standard input
01:34 - unit
01:36 - the user will hopefully type in f or c
01:40 - depending on what they want to convert
01:41 - to
01:42 - let's check to see if the user types in
01:44 - f first
01:46 - if
01:46 - unit
01:48 - is equal to the character f that's a
01:50 - capital f
01:52 - but you know maybe the user types in
01:53 - lowercase f i'll add an or conditional
01:56 - operator or
01:58 - unit
01:59 - is equal to
02:01 - a lowercase f that's also a valid
02:03 - response
02:04 - if the user would like to convert a
02:06 - temperature to fahrenheit these are the
02:08 - steps we can do
02:11 - standard
02:12 - output
02:15 - enter the
02:17 - temperature
02:19 - in
02:21 - celsius
02:26 - standard
02:27 - input
02:29 - temp to store the temperature
02:31 - to convert our temperature from celsius
02:33 - to fahrenheit we can assign temp
02:36 - equal to now here's the formula
02:39 - 1.8
02:40 - times
02:42 - our temp
02:44 - plus
02:45 - 32
02:47 - then we will display the temperature
02:49 - standard output
02:54 - temperature
02:58 - is
03:02 - temp degrees
03:06 - fahrenheit
03:08 - then i'll add a new line
03:11 - if the user would like to convert to
03:12 - celsius i'll add an else if statement
03:15 - else if
03:17 - unit is equal to
03:20 - the character capital c
03:22 - or
03:23 - unit is equal to the character lowercase
03:27 - c
03:29 - we can copy these two lines of code and
03:31 - reuse them
03:32 - we'll just repurpose them enter the
03:35 - temperature in
03:36 - fahrenheit
03:38 - here's the formula to convert from
03:40 - fahrenheit to celsius
03:42 - temp
03:43 - equals
03:45 - our current temperature minus 32
03:49 - divided by 1.8
03:53 - then let's display our temperature i'll
03:55 - copy this line of code paste it
03:58 - change fahrenheit to celsius
04:01 - now what if the user doesn't type in a
04:03 - valid response
04:05 - else
04:06 - standard
04:07 - output
04:09 - please enter in only c
04:13 - or f
04:16 - add a new line
04:19 - and that should be everything let's try
04:20 - this
04:23 - temperature conversion program
04:25 - what unit would you like to convert to i
04:27 - would like to convert to fahrenheit
04:30 - enter the temperature in celsius so
04:32 - what's zero degrees celsius converted to
04:34 - fahrenheit
04:36 - that is 32 degrees fahrenheit
04:39 - let's go again let's convert to celsius
04:42 - enter the temperature in fahrenheit
04:45 - what's 100 degrees in celsius
04:50 - 37.7 degrees celsius
04:53 - let's type in a response that's not
04:54 - valid uh i would like to convert to
04:57 - pizza
04:58 - please enter in only c or f
05:01 - all right everybody that is a program to
05:03 - convert from fahrenheit to celsius or
05:06 - vice versa i thought we could use some
05:08 - practice using conditional operators
05:10 - as well as if statements if you would
05:13 - like a copy of this code i'll post this
05:14 - in the comments section down below and
05:16 - well yeah that's a temperature
05:18 - conversion program in c plus
