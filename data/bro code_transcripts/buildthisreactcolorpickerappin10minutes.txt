00:00 - hey what's going on everybody in today's
00:01 - video we're going to create a Color
00:03 - Picker program using react this serves
00:05 - as more of an exercise now that we know
00:07 - how the UST State Hook and the onchange
00:09 - event handlers work so let's get started
00:12 - all right let's begin everybody within
00:14 - our source folder we'll create a new
00:16 - file for a Color Picker
00:18 - component this will be a jsx file we
00:22 - will use function based components
00:24 - function Color Picker there are no
00:28 - parameters then let's be sure to export
00:31 - this export default Color
00:35 - Picker we need to return something for
00:38 - the time being I'm going to return a
00:40 - fragment just so that everything works
00:43 - going back to our app component we will
00:46 - import our Color Picker component from
00:50 - its
00:52 - location SL colorpicker
00:56 - djsx then let's include one Color Picker
01:00 - component and that is all we need with
01:02 - the app component heading to the Color
01:05 - Picker component we will need to import
01:07 - the UST State hook import from react
01:11 - we'll use object destructuring just to
01:13 - get the use State Hook from
01:18 - react within our Color Picker function
01:21 - at the top we'll use the UST State hook
01:23 - to create a stateful color
01:25 - variable const we're going to use array
01:28 - D structuring and and create a color and
01:31 - a Setter function for that color we will
01:35 - use the use State
01:37 - hook for the color if you would like to
01:39 - set an initial color you can do that I
01:42 - recommend using heximal values to keep
01:44 - it simple for example if you would like
01:47 - white that would be
01:48 - 6fs personally I'm a fan of using hsl
01:52 - values for Hue saturation and lightness
01:55 - but that can get kind of complicated you
01:57 - would need to pass in a JavaScript
01:59 - object with those three properties we'll
02:01 - stick with heximal values just to keep
02:03 - it
02:04 - simple then we'll create our HTML
02:06 - elements So within the return statement
02:09 - I will create a div
02:13 - element this div element will have a
02:16 - class
02:17 - name of Color Picker
02:22 - container with react when using CSS I
02:25 - like to use a hyphenated naming
02:27 - convention this development will contain
02:29 - everything we need for our Color Picker
02:31 - component within this St elopment I will
02:33 - create an H1 element for a heading The
02:37 - Heading will be Color
02:40 - Picker after this H1 element I will
02:42 - create a nested div
02:44 - element this nested div element will
02:47 - have a class name equal to
02:51 - color- display this is what's going to
02:54 - change color this
02:56 - development now I will set the style
02:59 - attribute equal to some JavaScript if I
03:02 - attempt to set the background
03:05 - color to our color
03:08 - variable well with any CSS properties in
03:11 - JavaScript we need to enclose them
03:13 - within an object so we will use a double
03:16 - set of curly braces and that would work
03:19 - if you're embedding some JavaScript and
03:21 - then you're changing some CSS properties
03:23 - you'll need to enclose those CSS
03:25 - properties within a JavaScript object
03:28 - within this nested Dev element will
03:30 - create a paragraph
03:31 - element that has text of selected
03:36 - color embed some JavaScript include our
03:39 - stateful color
03:41 - variable after this development I will
03:44 - create a
03:46 - label this label will have text of
03:50 - select a
03:53 - color I'll create an input
03:56 - element
03:58 - input
04:02 - the type attribute is going to be
04:04 - color we'll have an input element for a
04:07 - color the default is black I'll set the
04:11 - value equal
04:13 - to our state full color
04:16 - variable then to change the color I will
04:20 - set the onchange event handler equal to
04:24 - a call back to a
04:25 - function we will handle color change
04:30 - but we still need to Define this
04:31 - function that's the last step in this
04:34 - component so we will create a function
04:37 - to handle color
04:40 - change there will be one parameter an
04:43 - event all we're going to do is use our
04:46 - Setter function for our color whichever
04:49 - color we select that's going to be its
04:52 - value either RGB hsl or
04:56 - heximal we will access this event
05:01 - Target access its value set the color to
05:05 - whatever that value is so if I set the
05:08 - color to be I don't know blue well that
05:12 - color is going to change to be blue and
05:15 - that is everything we need for this
05:16 - component we haven't applied any CSS yet
05:19 - so it's not very impressive although it
05:21 - does have
05:22 - functionality so be sure to save
05:24 - everything we will go to our CSS
05:27 - stylesheet let's select the body of our
05:30 - document I will set the font family to
05:34 - be aial with a backup of s
05:37 - serif I will take our class of Color
05:42 - Picker
05:45 - container this is what contains
05:47 - everything this div
05:50 - element take our Color Picker container
05:54 - I will use flexbox because I like
05:57 - flexbox display Flex
06:00 - Flex direction will be a column right
06:04 - now it's a
06:05 - row and
06:07 - align items in the
06:10 - center much
06:12 - better let's take our H1 element that
06:15 - would be this heading we are selecting
06:19 - H1 let's add some margin of 50
06:24 - pixels and increase the font size to 3
06:28 - RM
06:31 - let's select our color display that
06:33 - would be this element right
06:35 - here that has a class of color-
06:40 - display I will set a width of 300
06:45 - pixels a height of 300
06:49 - pixels I'll use flex box for all the
06:52 - elements within display
06:56 - Flex justify content
07:00 - tent in the
07:03 - center then
07:05 - align items
07:08 - Center I'll add a border around this
07:11 - element border 5 pixel
07:16 - solid I'll use hsl for the
07:21 - color let's pick something light gray
07:24 - I'll set the lightness to be
07:26 - 80% then I'll round the corners with
07:28 - border
07:30 - radius border
07:32 - radius 25
07:35 - pixels I'll add a little bit of margin
07:37 - to the bottom margin bottom 25
07:42 - pixels so when we select a color it's
07:45 - going to
07:48 - change I'm going to add a transition
07:50 - effect so the transition is a little
07:52 - more
07:53 - smooth I will set the transition
07:57 - property after a quarter of a second
08:00 - 0.25 seconds we will ease this
08:04 - transition so this animation should be
08:06 - more
08:13 - smooth let's select this paragraph
08:16 - element and style it take our color
08:18 - display
08:20 - class access the paragraph element
08:23 - within for the color I'll use hsl
08:26 - values 0 0%
08:30 - then
08:32 - 20% this will make the text a dark gray
08:34 - color although it's kind of small you
08:36 - can't really see
08:37 - it I'll increase the font
08:40 - size to 2
08:43 - RM then text to line
08:48 - Center let's work on the text of the
08:50 - label we're going to select our label
08:54 - increase the font size to 1.5
08:58 - RM let's set the font weight to be
09:03 - bold and add a little bit of margin to
09:06 - the
09:07 - bottom margin bottom 10
09:11 - pixels the last thing we need to do is
09:13 - change this input element so it's a
09:14 - little bigger I will select our input
09:17 - element but I don't want to select all
09:19 - input elements I'll use an attribute
09:21 - selector select all input elements that
09:24 - have a type of
09:27 - color so that'll be just this
09:29 - one I will set a width of 75
09:34 - pixels a height of 50
09:39 - pixels some padding of 5
09:43 - pixels I'll set a border radius to round
09:45 - the
09:47 - corners of 10
09:49 - pixels then set the border to be 3
09:52 - pixels solid and for the color I'll use
09:56 - hsl zero for the hue zero for the
10:00 - saturation 80% for the lightness that
10:03 - should give us a thick gray border all
10:06 - right everybody so that is a Color
10:07 - Picker program you can create as an
10:09 - exercise for
10:14 - react
