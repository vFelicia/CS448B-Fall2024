00:00 - Hey, how's it going? It's your bro here and I hope your day is going well
00:03 - And in this video series, I'm going to teach you guys
00:06 - C++ for free I'm not here to try and sell you some course because I'm your bro, and I have your back
00:12 - My lessons are free and they always will be if you want to learn C++. Look no further because you're in the right place
00:19 - Let's get into it
00:22 - Let's begin by discussing the advantages of C++ over other programming languages
00:27 - So C++ is a fast language. In fact, it is great for games
00:31 - If not, the best programming language for games because of its speed
00:35 - So if you ever want to get into game development, I would highly recommend learning C++ at least at some point
00:41 - Maybe not as your first language, but eventually you want to learn this
00:45 - So C++ is also portable between different operating systems such as Windows
00:50 - Mac and Linux
00:52 - C++ also supports object-oriented programming and
00:57 - C++ jobs are in demand currently at least in my geographical location starting salaries for new C++ developers are
01:04 - starting at least at
01:06 - $60,000 per year, but that also depends on your geographical location as well
01:10 - And if we talk about the advantages, we also need to discuss the disadvantages of C++ over other languages. So C++ is a
01:19 - Difficult language to learn I would not recommend it for your first language
01:23 - Now if you're watching this video and you're trying to decide on what you should learn for your very first programming language
01:28 - I would recommend a few other things instead of C++
01:32 - Just because C F plus plus is a more difficult language to learn if you go to my channel
01:37 - I actually have a few different playlists and if you're undecided on what you want to learn
01:41 - I would recommend starting with Python just because I would say that it's the easiest
01:46 - programming language to learn compared to all the others and other
01:50 - Disadvantages of C++ is the use of pointers and you'll learn what these are later
01:55 - misuse of them may make your system crash
01:57 - There is no too little security with C++ and there is no garbage collection
02:03 - But remember that all programming languages have certain advantages and disadvantages the advantages
02:09 - I would say far outweigh the disadvantages
02:12 - Well, what are the uses of C++?
02:14 - Well, I'm glad you asked it's used for many popular applications from web browsers to databases to desktop apps
02:21 - It's because the language is so fast and efficient that any application that's requiring a lot of processing power
02:28 - They actually better be using C++ because it's one of the fastest languages
02:33 - C++ is also used for many engines and for example
02:36 - it's used in Unreal Engine because of its speed and it's also compatible with many embedded systems for electronic devices and
02:44 - microcontrollers the C programming language might be better for this but
02:48 - C++ also has the capability to be used for these embedded systems as well as an option now
02:54 - You're probably wondering hey, bro. What do I need to start programming in this language? Well to answer your question
02:59 - What I would recommend is downloading an IDE. That's an acronym for integrated development
03:05 - Environment it's basically software that helps us write other software and there's a few recommendations of mine
03:11 - You just got to pick one of these I would probably recommend
03:15 - Microsoft Visual Studio to begin. Otherwise, there's a package for Eclipse for C and C++ developers
03:22 - Otherwise, there's code blocks, but I think that's a little outdated now, but personally I prefer
03:27 - Microsoft Visual Studio because you can also use it for c-sharp and there's some packages you can download for game development, which is pretty cool
03:36 - So if you guys have no preference
03:38 - I'll walk you guys through how to download Microsoft Visual Studio
03:41 - If you have a different iv'e in mind feel free to use that one too to begin
03:45 - We need to open up the interwebs go to any web browser and double click it to open up the interwebs good
03:53 - Step one is complete step two is to go to google and look this up
03:58 - Microsoft Visual
04:00 - Studio
04:02 - code and then you'll want to look up the community version and
04:06 - it should be this link here Visual Studio community and
04:11 - We're going to download Visual Studio
04:17 - And we are going to close out of this because we do not like pop-up ads and
04:24 - If you're running Windows you have to open this when done if you're using Mac
04:29 - I believe you have to drag this to your Applications folder. I'm not a Mac user. So I'm not 100% sure on that
04:40 - We're going to click yes
04:45 - And we're going to wait here a while click continue and
04:52 - You're gonna have to wait again. Well, you should be brought to a screen such as this one scroll down and click these two boxes
05:00 - Desktop development with C++ as well as Universal Windows platform
05:05 - development
05:06 - Just so you know, there's other packages you can download as well. You can use Visual Studio community for
05:13 - c-sharp
05:14 - unity and
05:15 - C++ game development. So keep those in mind you can always select those two if you want. Alright, then we're going to click install
05:24 - We don't feel like taking a survey right now. So we're going to click not now and
05:28 - We'll continue waiting. Well, welcome back. We're just going to click this launch button
05:34 - Sign in with the Microsoft account. Otherwise click not now maybe later
05:39 - All right
05:40 - so with the development settings, you'll want to go to Visual C++ and
05:47 - Then you can choose a color theme the standard is blue
05:51 - But if you want to feel like a pretend elite hacker, you can select dark mode. And for now we will continue without code
06:00 - Here at the home screen we'll want to go to the top file new project and
06:05 - We'll scroll down to C++ console app. Click Next we'll need a project name. Call this whatever you want. I'll call mine
06:13 - hello YouTube and
06:16 - You can set a location for your project
06:18 - I'm going to set it to a folder on my desktop or you can keep this as the default
06:23 - It doesn't matter and you can pick a solution name a solution is basically like a grouping of projects here
06:30 - It says a container for one or more projects. You can just keep it the same if you want and we're going to click create
06:40 - Now let me show you guys where you'd want to create a new C++ file
06:44 - So go to your solution Explorer and for some reason if you don't have this window or you can't find it
06:49 - Let's just pretend that we closed out of it
06:51 - You want to go to the top toolbar?
06:53 - View solution Explorer and you do have the option of moving this around if you prefer this in a different spot
06:58 - and you'll want to go to source files and
07:01 - There may or may not be a file here already
07:04 - So this is like a test file and it's actually right here behind our solution Explorer if I can move it. All right
07:11 - Yeah
07:12 - So this is our test file and all this does is that it displays the words hello world and you can actually run this
07:19 - just by clicking the screen play button and
07:22 - If you did have that file a small console window that says hello world should appear
07:27 - However, you might have a different color scheme because I've changed this in past tutorials, but at the end of the video
07:33 - I'll show you guys how we can actually change the color scheme for this as well
07:37 - All right. So let's say that you don't have this file
07:40 - Hello YouTube dot CPP or whatever else you name this so, let's just say that we delete this so we'll remove it
07:48 - Now to create a new file go to solution Explorer source files right click add
07:55 - new item
07:56 - then click
07:58 - C++ file then next you'll need a name for this. I think I'll just call this main that works then click Add
08:06 - All right. Let me shift some things around
08:15 - Why is this so difficult? Okay, this should be good enough
08:19 - So I zoomed in a little bit if you want to zoom in on your code
08:22 - You can go to the bottom left of the window and you can change it here
08:27 - I think 250 is a good amount for this video at least
08:32 - Alright, so we have a blank C++ file. Let's create a program where we display text to the council window
08:39 - Well now you should have a blank C++ file
08:42 - If you want to create a program to display some text to that console window like we did before
08:47 - this is what you're gonna type at the top a
08:50 - Hashtag like it's a Twitter hashtag
08:52 - type in the word include
08:55 - Less than sign greater than sign and within these two symbols type IO
09:00 - stream
09:02 - What we just typed
09:03 - This is a header file library
09:06 - It lets us work with input and output next hit enter to go down one or two lines
09:11 - It doesn't matter and then we're going to type int
09:14 - Main parentheses than a set of curly brackets. So what this is this is the main method
09:20 - so this is the
09:22 - entrance point to our program and when we run the program it's going to execute any code within the main method from the top and
09:29 - It's gonna work its way down
09:31 - Now let's say that you want to display some output to the console window. This is what you type type in
09:36 - STD and that is short for standard and I'm not referring to sexually transmitted diseases
09:41 - Then you need a set of colons then type and C out, which is short for
09:47 - Output and when you combine these both together, it means standard output
09:51 - Then next you need a set of less than signs this passes
09:56 - information to our standard output to display to the console window and
09:59 - Then next you can type in some text to display to that console window simply by putting it within a set of double quotes
10:06 - So here you can type in the typical hello world
10:10 - But I like to be different on this channel and I'll type something else
10:13 - So for your project
10:15 - why don't you type in some lyrics to a song you like and then post it in the comments down below because I would like
10:20 - To read it. So for one song that I like I'm going to type in this
10:26 - And then finish everything off with a semicolon, alright, let's run the program
10:34 - Yep in here the lyrics however, everything here is kind of compressed
10:38 - You can actually add a new line to the end of this so it gives you some more room
10:42 - So we're going to go back to our code to do that
10:45 - So if you want to add a new line just type in
10:48 - Backslash and and that is a newline character. So let's rerun this
10:53 - Here's the lyrics that we had before. Plus it added a new line after our lyrics which we intended
11:00 - So if you're annoyed by having your code on a separate panel or window, you can just drag and drop these
11:07 - So it's all like on the same window then so it's a little bit more convenient to work with
11:11 - Alright, so next let's say that you want to add a second line of text
11:15 - Well, you just type in the same thing basically, so STD to colons see out
11:22 - two sets of less than signs and then if you want to type in some
11:26 - Words like lyrics you just put it within a set of double quotes. So I'll type in the next line for this set of lyrics
11:39 - And then we have the option of finishing this off with a new line and
11:44 - Then don't forget that something I call it at the end. All right, so let's run this and
11:49 - Here's the results
11:50 - It says never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down
11:53 - So you can have multiple lines to display output if you so wish and in the next video
11:59 - We'll be discussing more on how we can display output
12:02 - so before we wrap up this video
12:04 - let me show you guys a few tricks that we can use to change the color scheme of the IDE as well as the
12:09 - Text and the color of the console window. So let's say that you don't like your current IDE color theme
12:16 - Let's say that you don't like this dark theme. I don't know why you wouldn't if you want to change it go to tools options
12:22 - And then you can change it here. You could go to let's say blue then hit OK and this should change the color scheme
12:29 - But that is very hard in the eyes, but some people might prefer this and they prefer to be blinded
12:34 - But I'm going to go back to dark
12:37 - Because I am a pretend elite hacker
12:40 - if you want to zoom in or out of your code, you can change that here in the bottom left corner of your window you
12:49 - Can either pick one of these few settings or you can type in a number that you'd like
12:53 - I think 250 for me is a good amount
12:56 - So lastly, you can change the color scheme of the console window that displays more specifically this one
13:02 - I think the default is white text on black background if you want to change that
13:07 - Actually, I already changed mine. But if you want to change it, click the top left corner, then go to properties and
13:14 - Then here you can change the font size
13:17 - You can change the cursor size
13:20 - the layout of the window size
13:23 - the colors
13:26 - Actually, let me pick a new font
13:29 - That's close enough
13:30 - Alright, and then you can change the colors here. You could have like green on green background, which I would not recommend
13:37 - I think I'll stick with the reading text on black background. Oh, I guess you can also change the opacity. Ooh, that's kind of neat
13:47 - Then just click OK with any changes and you can see that I changed the font style slightly
13:53 - so that's how you can change the
13:56 - Appearance of your console window so that will conclude this introduction to C++ in the next video
14:02 - we will get more in depth with displaying output and
14:05 - Eliminating some redundancies that we have here
14:07 - I'll explain how that works in the next video, but I'll also include some useful links in the description down below
14:13 - So this video was very exhausting to make feel free to smash that like button and drop a comment down below
14:20 - But yeah, that is everything you need to know to get started programming in C++
14:25 - Hey you if you enjoyed this lesson
14:27 - Then you can help me
