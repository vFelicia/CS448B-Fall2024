00:02 - hey what's going on everybody in this
00:03 - video i'm going to explain very basic
00:06 - type conversion type conversion is the
00:08 - conversion of a value of one data type
00:11 - to another two ways in which we can do
00:13 - this are implicit and explicit implicit
00:16 - is done automatically if done explicitly
00:19 - we precede a value with the new data
00:21 - type within a set of parentheses you
00:23 - list the new data type put it before a
00:25 - variable or a value
00:27 - let's perform an implicit cast suppose
00:30 - we have variable
00:32 - int x
00:33 - i will assign x the value 3.14
00:37 - integers can only hold a whole number
00:39 - if i were to display x standard output x
00:45 - well the value is three
00:47 - we truncated the decimal portion and
00:50 - implicitly converted this number into an
00:52 - integer what if x was of the double data
00:55 - type
00:56 - double x equals 3.14
01:00 - well then we would retain that decimal
01:02 - portion what would happen if i cast 3.14
01:06 - as an integer then assigned it to a
01:07 - double variable
01:09 - before the value
01:11 - add a set of parentheses then the new
01:13 - data type i will convert 3.14 to an
01:16 - integer then store it within this double
01:19 - x
01:20 - x now equals three it's a whole integer
01:22 - that is one example of implicit and
01:24 - explicit type conversion here's a few
01:26 - other examples i have character x
01:31 - equals some number like 100
01:34 - if i were to display what x was standard
01:37 - output
01:38 - x
01:39 - well we will implicitly cast this number
01:42 - 100 as a character we'll convert it
01:45 - using the ascii table to whatever its
01:47 - equivalent is
01:48 - the number 100 converted to a character
01:52 - is the letter d
01:54 - let's try an explicit cast
01:57 - i will display
01:59 - the number 100
02:00 - explicitly cast to a character
02:05 - and that value is the letter d as output
02:08 - how is this useful suppose we have an
02:10 - online exam we have to give the user a
02:12 - score how many questions did they get
02:14 - right divided by how many questions were
02:17 - total let's write something like this
02:19 - int correct equals maybe eight
02:23 - the user has eight questions that are
02:24 - right
02:25 - and questions
02:27 - equals ten there are ten total questions
02:30 - i need to calculate the score as a
02:32 - percentage
02:33 - we could say
02:35 - double score
02:37 - equals
02:38 - correct
02:39 - divided by
02:41 - questions
02:42 - times 100
02:44 - then let's display whatever the result
02:46 - is standard output
02:48 - score
02:50 - then i'll add a percent sign to the end
02:54 - eight divided by ten is point eight
02:56 - right
02:57 - times one hundred that should give us
02:59 - eighty percent
03:01 - uh we have zero percent well that's
03:04 - because we're using integer division
03:06 - questions is of the int data type when
03:09 - we're dividing 8 by 10 we're truncating
03:11 - that decimal portion we're getting rid
03:13 - of it then multiplying whatever remains
03:15 - by 100 i'm going to explicitly cast
03:18 - questions as a double of the double data
03:21 - type
03:22 - and we should retain that decimal
03:24 - portion
03:26 - yeah there we go 80
03:28 - where you'll use type conversion it
03:30 - really varies but you should be aware
03:31 - that you can do it such as when using
03:33 - integer division so yeah that's type
03:36 - conversion in c plus plus hey if you're
