00:02 - hey yeah let's talk about css
00:04 - positioning let's begin by creating two
00:06 - boxes i'll use a development let's name
00:08 - this first box box one and create a
00:11 - second box box two
00:14 - let's also create a whole lot of
00:15 - paragraphs because we'll want a scroll
00:17 - bar
00:19 - so if you need some sample text you can
00:20 - type lorem and then tab
00:23 - okay so copy this line and paste it
00:25 - maybe like 10 times
00:27 - that should be good enough and let's
00:28 - copy all of these paragraphs and paste
00:30 - them underneath our boxes
00:33 - doesn't really matter how many you have
00:34 - we just need a lot of room to work with
00:37 - okay let's design these two boxes now
00:39 - that we have a lot of sample text let's
00:41 - begin with box one
00:43 - i'll give this a border of one pixel
00:46 - solid
00:47 - a height
00:48 - of 300 pixels
00:51 - a width
00:52 - of 300 pixels
00:54 - and pick a background color any color is
00:56 - fine
00:59 - now let's style box two
01:02 - and we'll make this smaller
01:04 - 100 by 100 and a different color
01:08 - i like tomatoes so there is a position
01:11 - property
01:12 - where we can format the layout of an
01:14 - element there's five that we'll discuss
01:16 - absolute fixed relative static and
01:19 - sticky static is easy that's the default
01:22 - any element that is positioned
01:24 - statically is in its normal state so
01:26 - there's no change here now relative
01:29 - we can move this element relative to
01:32 - some point of origin the point of origin
01:34 - of box one our blue box is the top left
01:37 - corner and there are offsets top bottom
01:40 - left and right if i would like to
01:42 - displace this element down and to the
01:44 - right by 50 pixels i can set the top
01:47 - offset to 50 pixels or some other unit
01:50 - of measurement
01:52 - and then
01:53 - offset it from the left by 50 pixels as
01:56 - well so this does create an empty vacuum
01:58 - of where this element was so think of
02:00 - this as a reserved space take a look at
02:03 - this what if i were to set top and left
02:05 - to an even greater number like 150 this
02:08 - element will cover other elements
02:10 - underneath so that's something you need
02:11 - to take into consideration or we could
02:13 - do the same thing with box two
02:16 - now box two is displaced and this corner
02:20 - the top left corner is the point of
02:21 - origin okay now let's discuss absolute
02:24 - positioning any element that is
02:26 - positioned absolutely will be taken out
02:29 - of the flow of the document so with box
02:31 - two let's set the position to
02:34 - absolute
02:36 - so you probably noticed that all of this
02:38 - text is running underneath this element
02:40 - it's as if our document is ignoring box
02:43 - 2. it's kind of like it's ethereal or a
02:46 - ghost or something and if i were to set
02:48 - a position
02:49 - i'll set the top to zero
02:52 - then this box appears at the top of our
02:54 - document and here's the reason why any
02:57 - element that is absolutely positioned
02:59 - will search for any parents that are
03:02 - positioned non-statically if it does not
03:04 - have a parent it will instead use the
03:07 - viewport we're setting the point of
03:09 - origin for box 2 to the top left corner
03:12 - of our webpage because it doesn't have
03:14 - any direct parents that are positioned
03:17 - non-statically now if i set top to 150
03:20 - pixels then the point of origin is the
03:23 - top left corner still and it will be
03:24 - pushed down by 150 pixels
03:27 - and maybe to the left by 150 pixels as
03:30 - well what if i would like box two to be
03:32 - positioned in the center of box one okay
03:35 - what i'm going to do is make box two a
03:38 - child of box one by placing box two
03:40 - within box one
03:43 - however box one is positioned statically
03:45 - that's the default so i will set the
03:48 - position to maybe
03:51 - uh let's say relative
03:53 - and let's uh set top to 100 and left to
03:56 - 100
03:57 - there box 2 is now within the center and
04:00 - the cool thing about this is that if i
04:01 - move box 1 box 2 will follow and stay in
04:04 - that same place it's positioned
04:06 - absolutely so let's set the left offset
04:09 - to
04:10 - maybe 250 there and box 2 is staying in
04:13 - the same place
04:14 - then maybe the top by 250 as well
04:17 - that's kind of the idea behind absolute
04:19 - positioning it searches for a parent
04:21 - that is positioned non-statically such
04:24 - as relative or some of the other
04:25 - positions i'm about to discuss if it
04:27 - doesn't find a parent it uses the
04:29 - viewport
04:30 - so we'll keep box 2 right there next we
04:33 - have fixed
04:35 - fixed will stay in position of your
04:36 - viewport
04:39 - so even when you scroll it's going to
04:40 - stay wherever you set it
04:42 - let's set this in the top right corner
04:46 - so top
04:47 - zero pixels
04:49 - and right
04:51 - zero pixels
04:53 - so this box will stay in the top right
04:55 - corner of my viewport
04:57 - so that is fixed
04:59 - and lastly we have sticky
05:01 - anything that has a sticky position will
05:04 - stick to an edge of your viewport when
05:06 - you scroll past
05:08 - so if i set this to top
05:11 - then this element is going to stick to
05:13 - the top when we scroll down past it but
05:16 - currently it's in its normal place but
05:18 - when i scroll past it will stick to the
05:20 - top of my viewport
05:22 - and then when i scroll up past it it
05:24 - will snap back into place
05:27 - or we can set this to the bottom
05:29 - when i scroll up past this element it
05:31 - will stick to the bottom then snap back
05:33 - into place or we could combine them both
05:37 - so if i scroll down past this element it
05:39 - will stick to the top if i scroll up
05:41 - past the element it will stick to the
05:42 - bottom
05:43 - so that is the sticky position
05:46 - so yeah everybody those are a few
05:47 - positions in css if this video helped
