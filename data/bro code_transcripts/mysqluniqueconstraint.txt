00:00 - hey everybody I have a quick video on
00:02 - the unique constraint the unique
00:04 - constraint ensures that all values in a
00:07 - column are all different that's
00:09 - basically it we can add this constraint
00:11 - when we create a table or after let's
00:13 - create a new table
00:15 - create
00:16 - table
00:17 - let's create a table of products what
00:19 - products do we offer
00:23 - we'll list the columns
00:25 - let's add a product ID
00:29 - the data type will be int
00:33 - product name the data type will be
00:37 - varchar maybe 25 characters then a price
00:42 - price
00:43 - the data type will be decimal
00:46 - our price will have a Max size of four
00:48 - digits
00:49 - and a Precision of two decimal places
00:52 - to add the unique constraint select a
00:55 - column after the data type add the
00:58 - keyword unique
01:00 - and that's all you have to do with this
01:02 - keyword unique we can't insert any
01:05 - product names that are the same they all
01:07 - have to be well unique let's create this
01:10 - table
01:12 - let's say that you forget the unique
01:14 - keyword then you create the table what
01:17 - you could do instead
01:19 - is type alter table the name of the
01:23 - table
01:24 - products which we just created
01:27 - add
01:29 - constraint
01:31 - unique
01:34 - the name of the column within
01:36 - parentheses
01:37 - product name
01:41 - if you forget to add a unique constraint
01:43 - to a column after you already create the
01:45 - table this is what you can write
01:48 - uh however when I run this
01:50 - I do have a warning I already have a
01:53 - unique constraint on that column but
01:55 - yeah that's how you would add a unique
01:56 - constraint to a column in a table you
01:59 - have already created let's select our
02:01 - table select all from
02:04 - products
02:07 - we have a product ID column product name
02:10 - and a price let's insert all of our
02:13 - values
02:14 - insert into the name of our table which
02:18 - is products
02:19 - values will insert maybe four rows
02:34 - we'll need a product ID name then a
02:37 - price for a product name we have a
02:39 - hamburger and the product ID I'm just
02:41 - making up a number is 100.
02:44 - the name is hamburger
02:49 - the price will be 3.99
02:52 - Fry's will be our next item
02:56 - then we have prize
02:59 - the price will be 189.
03:03 - 102
03:05 - will be soda
03:08 - the price is one dollar even
03:12 - 103 will be ice cream
03:19 - the price will be 149. Let's test the
03:23 - unique constraint that we have added to
03:25 - the product name column suppose that I
03:28 - forget that I have fries on the menu
03:29 - already
03:30 - and I will add another row
03:35 - 104 Fry's 189 actually let me change the
03:39 - price to maybe something different like
03:41 - 175. here's what happens when I attempt
03:44 - to add two values that are the same
03:47 - duplicate entry fries for Key Products
03:51 - dot product name MySQL is telling us
03:54 - that we have a duplicate under the
03:56 - product name column we have fries twice
03:59 - since we added the unique constraint all
04:01 - values in this column must be different
04:04 - if I were to remove the last column
04:07 - where we have that duplicate
04:10 - well then this would run just fine
04:12 - now let's select everything
04:16 - from products
04:20 - yeah there we go here are the products
04:22 - we have a hamburger fries soda and ice
04:25 - cream all on the menu so yeah that's the
04:27 - unique constraint you can add that
04:29 - constraint when you create a table or
04:31 - after whatever column has that unique
04:34 - constraint all the values need to be
04:36 - different so yeah that's the unique
04:38 - constraint in MySQL
