00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well and in
00:03 - this video i'm going to teach you guys
00:04 - how we can move an image on both
00:06 - a window and a canvas in python so sit
00:09 - back relax and enjoy the show
00:13 - if you find this video helpful please
00:14 - remember to like
00:16 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:18 - help keep this channel running
00:20 - all right my fellow bros i'm going to
00:22 - divide this video into
00:24 - two different sections in the first
00:26 - section we're going to move a widget
00:28 - within a window
00:29 - and in the next section we're going to
00:31 - move an image
00:32 - on a canvas so let's begin by moving a
00:35 - widget within a window
00:36 - so we'll need a window window equals tk
00:39 - followed by window.mainloop
00:40 - and we'll also need to set some geometry
00:42 - for this window
00:44 - window dot geometry let's make this 500
00:48 - by 500
00:50 - 500 x 500 and let's take a look
00:55 - okay that should be a decent size let's
00:57 - add a label to this window
01:00 - so i actually have a race car image that
01:02 - i want to use if you would like an image
01:04 - feel free to pause the video and
01:05 - download one
01:06 - what i would like to do is create a
01:08 - photo image from this png file that i
01:10 - have
01:11 - i'm just going to call this my
01:14 - image equals photo
01:17 - image file equals since this is within
01:21 - my project folder i can just list the
01:23 - file name
01:25 - otherwise you might have to list the
01:26 - file path and for me this is called
01:29 - racecar.png
01:31 - i want to add this image to my label not
01:34 - necessary but it'll be helpful for this
01:36 - example
01:36 - i'm going to call my label just a label
01:39 - label equals
01:40 - label i'm adding this to the window and
01:42 - i'm going to set the image to equal
01:44 - my image that i created it's a photo
01:46 - image
01:48 - if you do not have an image that you
01:49 - want to use you can simply just change
01:51 - the background color you could say
01:53 - bg i don't know red
01:57 - oh then we need to place this so be sure
01:59 - to do that
02:00 - label dot place and i'm going to place
02:02 - this in the top left corner that is
02:04 - where x equals zero and y equals zero
02:07 - and then we should have a race car or
02:09 - whatever image you used
02:10 - and a red background you can get rid of
02:12 - the background color if you prefer
02:14 - that's just if you don't have an image
02:16 - to use you can set the background color
02:18 - just for a visual to
02:20 - show you where the label currently is
02:22 - let's set some key bindings for this
02:24 - window
02:25 - and let's add them maybe here before we
02:26 - create the label and our image
02:28 - so let's bind the w key for up s for
02:32 - down
02:32 - a for left and d for right so we do that
02:35 - with
02:36 - window dot bind and we pass in an event
02:40 - as well as a function name so we want to
02:43 - tie the w key to a function
02:46 - and we'll call this move underscore up
02:50 - and then we will need to define this so
02:53 - outside of the window
02:55 - let's define move underscore
02:59 - up and this takes an event so we'll
03:02 - place that as a parameter
03:04 - and to move our label up we're going to
03:07 - take
03:07 - label dot place
03:11 - and we're going to place this at some
03:12 - new coordinates x
03:14 - equals the label's current position
03:18 - relative to the window that it's in so
03:20 - that is label
03:21 - dot w info
03:24 - underscore x
03:27 - all right so then for y it's similar
03:30 - y equals label dot w
03:34 - info underscore y
03:37 - but we're going to subtract maybe one
03:41 - all right so this is all we need
03:45 - although this is only going to move up
03:47 - so i'm going to press w
03:49 - and our label our race car or whatever
03:52 - image you used is going to move slowly
03:54 - up
03:55 - i'm going to increase this to 10 so the
03:58 - change is more drastic
04:00 - so now our race car is drifting off into
04:02 - space
04:04 - let's find a few other keys s a
04:07 - and d sad all right so
04:10 - s will be down move underscore down
04:16 - a for left move left
04:21 - and d for right move
04:24 - right we'll just copy what we have here
04:27 - and make a few changes
04:28 - let's begin with move down
04:33 - the only thing we're going to change
04:34 - within here is in place of subtracting
04:37 - 10
04:37 - from the y coordinate we're going to add
04:40 - 10. and with our race car oh i guess we
04:43 - have to define these so let's do that
04:45 - real quick
04:47 - so we have left move left
04:50 - we're going to subtract 10 from
04:54 - the x coordinate and keep y the same
04:58 - and then the same thing for move right
05:00 - move
05:01 - underscore right and this time we are
05:04 - going to add 10
05:05 - to x and y will stay the same
05:10 - okay now with our image we can move up
05:14 - down right and then left
05:18 - and why stop there we can bind these to
05:20 - our arrow keys
05:25 - so up is just up with a capital u
05:28 - down is down these are all capital by
05:31 - the way
05:32 - left is left and then right is right
05:38 - and now i can use my arrow keys to move
05:40 - this image
05:48 - now for this part of the video i'm going
05:49 - to teach you guys how we can move an
05:51 - image on a canvas this time and not just
05:53 - within a window
05:54 - but we'll need a window to begin with
05:56 - window equals tk followed by window.main
05:59 - loop
05:59 - and we're going to create a canvas
06:02 - canvas
06:02 - equals canvas we're adding this canvas
06:05 - to the window and let's set a width and
06:07 - height
06:08 - for the width let's make this 500 and
06:10 - the height 500 as well
06:11 - so this is an even square and we'll need
06:14 - to
06:15 - pack or place this canvas canvas.pack
06:17 - should take care of that
06:19 - and let's run this and this is our
06:21 - canvas
06:22 - at this step we need to add an image to
06:25 - our canvas and i have an image of a race
06:27 - car that i want to add
06:28 - so i need to create a photo image from
06:31 - this file
06:32 - so we can do that let's give this photo
06:35 - image a unique name i'm just going to
06:36 - call this photo image to keep it simple
06:39 - photo image equals photo image and i can
06:42 - list
06:42 - the file path or the file name since
06:45 - this image
06:46 - is within my project folder i only have
06:48 - to list the file name
06:49 - and my file is called racecar.png
06:54 - this next step we need to give our image
06:56 - a unique name
06:57 - the image that's being added to the
06:58 - canvas i'll call this
07:00 - my image equals
07:04 - and we need to turn this photo image
07:07 - into an image added to the canvas
07:09 - so we type in the name of the canvas
07:11 - canvas
07:12 - dot create underscore image we first
07:16 - need to list the coordinates of where we
07:18 - want to place this photo image
07:20 - so let's place this in the top left
07:22 - corner that is where
07:23 - x is 0 and y 0 and we need to set the
07:26 - image
07:27 - of the image that we're creating so we
07:29 - can do that with saying
07:30 - image equals the name of our photo image
07:35 - and let's see what we have so far so
07:38 - this image is somewhat cut off in the
07:40 - top left corner we can easily fix that
07:42 - by anchoring
07:43 - our image when we create it so let's at
07:45 - the end add
07:46 - anchor equals northwest
07:50 - so that should fix that problem and we
07:52 - now have our image that we want to use
07:55 - and to move our image we can set some
07:56 - key bindings
07:59 - so we type in the name of the window dot
08:02 - bind
08:02 - and we pass in two arguments an event as
08:05 - well as a function name
08:07 - let's tie pressing the w key to moving
08:10 - up
08:10 - so the first argument is going to be w
08:13 - and the second is going to be
08:14 - a function name so let's say move
08:17 - underscore up
08:19 - and let's bind some other keys
08:22 - w for up s for down
08:28 - a for left and
08:31 - d for right
08:34 - we'll need to define these now so at the
08:37 - top outside of the window
08:39 - let's begin by defining move up
08:42 - def move up this has an event as a
08:45 - parameter
08:48 - and let's create the other definitions
08:52 - here
08:54 - so i'm just going to rename these so we
08:57 - have move up
08:58 - move down move left and move right
09:05 - okay now this next step we can use the
09:08 - canvases
09:08 - move function to move an image a certain
09:11 - amount of pixels on the x-axis
09:13 - and y-axis so let's begin with move up
09:16 - we type in the name of the canvas dot
09:19 - and use the
09:19 - move function and this has three
09:22 - arguments
09:22 - the image that we want to use and this
09:25 - image is called
09:26 - my image the one with the race car
09:30 - the next argument is the amount of
09:32 - pixels we're moving this
09:34 - on the x-axis with up
09:37 - we can keep this the same but on the
09:39 - y-axis let's say we want to move this
09:42 - up 10 pixels so that would be -10
09:46 - and let's repeat the process for move
09:48 - down move left and move right
09:50 - for move down we're going to change
09:53 - y to 10 for move left
09:57 - we'll keep y the same at zero but we're
10:00 - going to
10:00 - subtract 10 and then move right
10:05 - we are going to add 10 to where x is
10:09 - and that should be it so we can move up
10:13 - down right left
10:17 - and if you want to bind these to some
10:19 - arrow keys
10:20 - all we have to do is just change the
10:23 - event
10:24 - so we can bind these to our wsad keys
10:28 - as well as up
10:31 - down left
10:35 - and right and this time i'm going to use
10:38 - my arrow keys
10:40 - up down right and left
10:45 - all right so that's a few of the basics
10:47 - of moving either widgets or
10:49 - images on a canvas or window if you
10:52 - would like a copy of all this code for
10:53 - both examples i'll post both of them in
10:56 - the comments down below
10:57 - but yeah that's the basics of moving
10:59 - widgets and images
11:00 - in python hey you yeah i'm talking to
11:04 - you
11:05 - if you learn something new then you can
