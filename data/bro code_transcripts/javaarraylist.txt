00:00 - hey how's it going everybody it's bro
00:01 - hope you're doing well and in this video
00:03 - i'm going to teach you guys all about
00:04 - arraylists in java so sit back
00:07 - relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:12 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:16 - help keep this channel running
00:18 - all right well welcome back ladies and
00:20 - gentlemen in this video i'm going to be
00:22 - explaining
00:23 - arraylists an arraylist is a collection
00:25 - it's a type of
00:26 - resizable array elements can be added
00:29 - and removed
00:30 - after the compilation phase which you
00:32 - cannot normally do with standard arrays
00:35 - however they only store reference data
00:37 - types and i'll give you a few examples
00:39 - so these are the steps in order to
00:41 - create an arraylist first we type array
00:43 - list
00:44 - pay attention to the capitalization the
00:46 - a and the l are both capital
00:48 - then we need a pair of angle brackets
00:51 - and we're going to list the reference
00:52 - data type
00:53 - within the angle brackets let's say
00:56 - we're storing
00:57 - an arraylist of food so we will create
01:00 - an arraylist that will store some
01:01 - strings for the names of food
01:04 - now if you need to store primitive
01:06 - values like an integer
01:07 - a double a character you need to use the
01:10 - wrapper class
01:11 - so for example if we needed to store
01:13 - integers within an arraylist
01:15 - we would not place int we would use the
01:17 - appropriate wrapper class
01:19 - and type integer so we're going to be
01:22 - storing strings which are already
01:23 - reference data types
01:25 - so let's call this arraylist food equals
01:28 - new array list angle brackets we're
01:32 - going to list the data type again
01:34 - of string parentheses semicolon
01:37 - and we'll need an import so at the top
01:39 - of our program outside the class
01:41 - import java.util.arraylist we now have
01:45 - an arraylist
01:46 - called food that will store strings so
01:49 - how can we add values to our arraylist
01:51 - well there is a function to do that that
01:53 - is the add function
01:55 - and in order to use the add function
01:57 - type in the name of the arraylist
01:59 - dot add and we can add a string
02:02 - so let's add a few food items let's add
02:05 - pizza to the first element followed by
02:08 - i'm going to copy this hamburger
02:12 - and hotdog so let's
02:16 - display all the elements of our
02:18 - arraylist and we can do that using a for
02:20 - loop
02:21 - so for parentheses curly braces
02:25 - and then we will need an index int i
02:28 - will set the sequel to zero
02:30 - we'll continue this for loop as long as
02:33 - i
02:34 - is less than food and normally with
02:36 - arrays you would use
02:37 - dot length but with array lists we use
02:40 - dot
02:40 - size and we are going to increment
02:45 - our index by one and then in order to
02:49 - display or retrieve
02:51 - one of the elements of our array we will
02:54 - use the get function
02:55 - and let's put this within a print line
02:57 - statement food
02:59 - dot get and then we are going to list
03:02 - the index of i so this will display
03:06 - all of the food that is in our arraylist
03:08 - pizza
03:09 - hamburger and hot dog now let's discuss
03:12 - a few useful methods of array lists
03:15 - the first useful method is the set
03:17 - method food
03:18 - dot set so we can set a value
03:21 - at a certain index let's say at index
03:24 - zero
03:24 - currently we have pizza at this index we
03:27 - will replace
03:28 - this value with maybe sushi
03:32 - and now within our arraylist if we
03:34 - display all of the elements using our
03:36 - for loop
03:37 - we now have sushi hamburger and hotdog
03:40 - so our pizza value has been replaced
03:43 - with sushi because we used the set
03:45 - method
03:46 - so we can also remove a value at a
03:49 - certain index using the remove
03:51 - method food dot remove
03:54 - let's say we would like to remove our
03:56 - hotdog that is
03:57 - at element number two
04:00 - and now we only have sushi and hamburger
04:04 - and last but not least we can use the
04:06 - clear method to
04:07 - clear our arraylist food.clear
04:10 - and we no longer have any elements
04:12 - within our arraylist of
04:14 - food because we cleared it we ate all
04:16 - the food
04:17 - all right everybody so that is
04:19 - arraylists in java if you would like a
04:20 - copy of all this code i will post all of
04:22 - this in the comments down below
