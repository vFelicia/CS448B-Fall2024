00:00 - hey what's going on everybody two bro
00:01 - here hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video we're going to be creating our
00:04 - very first graphical user interface in
00:07 - python so sit back relax and enjoy the
00:09 - show
00:12 - if you find this video helpful please
00:13 - remember to like
00:15 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:17 - help keep this channel running
00:19 - welcome one and all today we'll be
00:21 - creating our very first graphical user
00:23 - interface in python also known as a gui
00:26 - for short
00:27 - we're going to be using the tk enter gui
00:29 - which is a module that is included with
00:31 - python
00:32 - our first step in order to use tk enter
00:34 - is to import this module so that we can
00:36 - begin using it
00:38 - our first line of code will be from tk
00:41 - enter
00:42 - import asterisk this will import
00:44 - everything
00:45 - related to the tk enter module and with
00:48 - this import we can now use all of the
00:50 - gui features that this module has to
00:52 - offer
00:52 - now there is one important distinction
00:54 - that we need to make we need to discuss
00:56 - the differences between windows
00:58 - and widgets here's a few quick
01:01 - definitions that i definitely did not
01:03 - copy from the internet
01:04 - widgets are gui elements such as buttons
01:08 - text boxes labels images you name it
01:11 - and windows they serve as a container
01:14 - to hold or contain these widgets for
01:17 - this topic we'll be creating and
01:19 - customizing our own window
01:20 - and in future topics we'll be exploring
01:23 - different widgets that are available to
01:25 - us
01:25 - so let's begin by creating a simple
01:27 - window and we should give our window a
01:30 - unique name
01:30 - such as window that's pretty creative
01:33 - and in order to instantiate this window
01:35 - we're going to follow this window name
01:37 - with equals
01:38 - tk make sure you get the capitalization
01:40 - right this is a
01:41 - uppercase t and a set of parentheses to
01:44 - serve as the constructor
01:45 - what this will do and i'm just going to
01:47 - add a comment is instantiate
01:50 - an instance of a window for us
01:54 - and when we compile and run this nothing
01:56 - appears to happen
01:57 - that's because we only instantiated our
02:00 - window and we're not actually displaying
02:02 - it
02:02 - in order to display our window we're
02:04 - going to follow this with
02:05 - the name of the window dot main loop
02:09 - and this will display our window and
02:11 - this is our first
02:12 - graphical user interface and we'll be
02:14 - adding widgets
02:16 - to this window so i'm going to add a
02:18 - comment that
02:19 - this will place window on
02:23 - computer screen and it will also listen
02:26 - for events but we'll get to that in
02:29 - future videos
02:30 - now what we'll be doing is customizing
02:32 - the appearance of this window
02:33 - let's begin by changing the size and we
02:36 - can do that with the geometry function
02:38 - so we're going to first begin by typing
02:41 - the name of our window which is window
02:43 - follow this by using the geometry
02:45 - function and we pass in a width and
02:48 - height but make sure this is within
02:50 - quotes and set this to whatever width
02:51 - and height that you want
02:53 - so if i want 420 by 420 that would be
02:55 - 420
02:57 - x 420 and the size of our window
03:00 - is now the size that we set with the
03:02 - geometry function
03:03 - now take a look at the top left of this
03:05 - window we have
03:07 - this feather icon as well as a title of
03:10 - tk
03:11 - that's kind of lame so let's change that
03:13 - let's first
03:14 - change the window title and there is a
03:16 - function to do that
03:18 - so we type in the name of our window
03:20 - window
03:22 - dot title function and we can pass in
03:25 - a new title that we want to set and i
03:28 - will set the title to be
03:29 - maybe pro code
03:32 - first gui program
03:36 - that'll work and we now changed the
03:39 - title of this window and it says
03:41 - bro code first gui program
03:44 - the next thing that we can do although
03:46 - not necessary
03:47 - is that we can change the icon of our
03:49 - window bar at the top
03:51 - i would like to replace this feather
03:53 - icon with an image of my choosing
03:55 - here's my desktop don't mind all of the
03:57 - clutter and i would like to use this
03:59 - image
04:00 - of the logo for my channel and set this
04:02 - as the icon
04:03 - for my window so what i'm going to do is
04:06 - copy this
04:08 - and then go to my project folder and
04:10 - then paste it
04:12 - click ok and i now have this image
04:15 - within my project folder
04:17 - but it's in a format that we cannot use
04:19 - currently we need to convert this to
04:21 - what's called a photo image
04:23 - that is a format that tk enter can use
04:26 - so we'll need to convert our image to a
04:28 - photo image
04:30 - so do that anywhere within the window
04:32 - between window equals tk and
04:34 - window.mainloop
04:35 - right here is good i suppose we're going
04:37 - to create a photo image
04:38 - from this image and this is a png file
04:41 - but yours might be something different
04:43 - so let's give our photo image a unique
04:45 - name like maybe icon
04:47 - and in order to create a photo image
04:48 - we'll follow this with equals
04:51 - photo image and within the constructor
04:54 - of our photo image
04:55 - there is an option for file we can
04:57 - either list the file name or the file
04:59 - path
05:00 - if it's somewhere else on your computer
05:02 - since this image is within my same
05:04 - project folder i only have to list the
05:06 - file name
05:07 - and this is called logo.png
05:10 - and this is probably going to be named
05:12 - something else for you though
05:13 - so we now have this photo image called
05:16 - icon
05:17 - that we can use and i need to set the
05:20 - icon
05:20 - of my window to this icon and luckily
05:23 - there is a function to take care of that
05:25 - for us
05:26 - type in the name of the window which is
05:28 - window
05:29 - dot and we're going to use the icon
05:32 - photo
05:32 - function there are two arguments
05:35 - the first we're going to set to true and
05:38 - the second
05:39 - is the photo image that we want to use
05:41 - and this photo image is called icon
05:44 - so we're going to pass this photo image
05:46 - as an argument
05:47 - to this function of icon photo and now
05:50 - when we compile and run this
05:52 - the image that we wanted to use is now
05:54 - set
05:55 - for the top left icon of this window bar
05:58 - however it loses a lot of the quality
06:00 - since the dimensions are so small but
06:02 - you can still tell that it's my logo
06:03 - though
06:04 - so that's how to replace the icon of
06:07 - your window bar in the top left corner
06:09 - now let's change the background color of
06:11 - this window
06:12 - and one way in which we can do that is
06:14 - to use the config function you can use
06:16 - the config function
06:17 - anytime that you want to make any
06:18 - changes to this window so let's change
06:20 - the background color here
06:22 - and there is an option called background
06:25 - and we can set this equal to either
06:27 - a color name or a hexadecimal value
06:30 - let's begin with just some color names
06:32 - let's say that i want the background
06:33 - color to be black
06:35 - i'll just type in the word black here
06:37 - and this will change the background
06:38 - color
06:39 - of my window to black alternatively
06:42 - you can set a hex value as the color
06:45 - so if you were to look up or google hex
06:48 - color picker
06:48 - you can select whatever color you want
06:51 - let's say that i want
06:52 - a sky blue color like this well this is
06:55 - the hex value i'm going to copy this
06:58 - value
06:59 - and then paste it within the option for
07:02 - my background
07:02 - make sure you have this hashtag as well
07:04 - because that represents that this is a
07:07 - hex value
07:08 - so now the background color is that sky
07:10 - blue color that i picked
07:12 - well everybody that's the basics of
07:14 - creating a window
07:15 - in python and in future videos we're
07:17 - going to be exploring
07:18 - different widgets that we can add to
07:20 - this window that have some functionality
07:22 - so if you would like a copy of all this
07:24 - code i'll post all of this in the
07:26 - comments down below
07:27 - but yeah that's how to create your very
07:28 - first gui in python
07:31 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
07:34 - learn something new
07:35 - then you can help me help you in three
07:38 - easy steps
07:39 - by smashing that like button drop a
07:42 - comment down below
07:43 - and subscribe if you'd like to become a
07:45 - fellow bro
