00:00 - Hello friends it's me again and in
00:02 - today's topic I'm going to explain
00:03 - logical operators in PHP there's three
00:06 - and or not they're used to combine
00:11 - conditional statements for example if we
00:14 - have an if statement we check a
00:16 - condition using these logical operators
00:18 - we can check more than one condition if
00:21 - using and
00:22 - if that were or
00:24 - we can check if at least one condition
00:26 - is true with the case with not we can
00:30 - reverse a condition if it's true it's
00:33 - now false if it's false it's now true
00:35 - more on that later we can make our
00:38 - conditional statements a little more
00:39 - sophisticated with logical operators
00:42 - here's an example
00:44 - we have a temperature we would like to
00:46 - check to see if our temperature Falls
00:48 - within a certain range let's say we have
00:51 - variable temp short for temperature this
00:53 - will be in Celsius because most of my
00:55 - viewers are from outside of the United
00:57 - States in the United States we use
00:59 - Fahrenheit but use whatever works for
01:01 - you
01:02 - let's say the temperature is 25 degrees
01:04 - Celsius
01:06 - let's write an if statement to check to
01:08 - see if our temperature Falls within a
01:09 - certain range
01:10 - if
01:13 - temp is greater than or equal to zero
01:17 - we'll start with one condition
01:19 - then let's Echo
01:22 - the weather is good
01:27 - our temp is 25 25 degrees Celsius
01:31 - the weather is good
01:33 - what if my temperature was 100 degrees
01:36 - Celsius
01:38 - well the weather is obviously not good
01:40 - right in fact the weather is horrible to
01:43 - make sure our temperature isn't above a
01:45 - certain number we can use the and
01:48 - logical operator which is a double
01:50 - ampersand
01:52 - if our temperature is equal to or above
01:55 - zero
01:56 - and
01:58 - our temperature
01:59 - is less than or equal to 30 30 degrees
02:04 - Celsius then the weather is good
02:08 - this statement is true
02:10 - but this one is false with the and
02:12 - logical operator both conditions must be
02:16 - true in order for us to execute this
02:18 - statement
02:19 - otherwise let's add an else Clause else
02:22 - Echo
02:25 - the weather
02:27 - is bad
02:29 - so 100 degrees Celsius that is not a
02:32 - good temperature the weather is bad
02:35 - what about negative 10 negative 10
02:38 - degrees Celsius
02:40 - well the weather is still bad
02:43 - 15
02:45 - the weather is good
02:46 - 15 Falls within our range 15 is greater
02:50 - than or equal to zero and 15 is less
02:53 - than or equal to 30.
02:55 - Now using the orological operator which
02:58 - is two vertical bars
03:00 - at least one of these conditions needs
03:03 - to be true
03:04 - if we're writing the same program using
03:06 - the orological operator this is what I
03:09 - would change
03:10 - let's say if temp
03:13 - is less than zero
03:15 - or temp
03:17 - is greater than 30 then the weather is
03:21 - bad else the weather is good
03:24 - let's change temp to negative
03:28 - 1 million
03:31 - well the weather is bad if our
03:34 - temperature was positive 1 million I
03:37 - believe that's actually a hundred
03:38 - million uh well the weather is obviously
03:41 - bad as well
03:42 - if our temperature is 25
03:45 - then the weather is good
03:47 - with our temperature being this high
03:50 - this statement is false
03:52 - but this one is true using the
03:54 - orological operator only one of these
03:56 - conditions needs to be true
03:58 - that's another way in which you can
04:00 - write conditions you could use the
04:02 - orological operator use whatever is best
04:05 - for your situation
04:07 - okay let's set temp to something
04:08 - reasonable like 15.
04:11 - all right now I'm going to discuss the
04:14 - not logical operator let's add a
04:16 - variable
04:17 - cloudy this will be a Boolean variable
04:20 - it's either true or false let's set that
04:24 - to be true the temperature is 15 degrees
04:26 - Celsius
04:28 - and the sky is cloudy that's set to true
04:31 - using an if statement
04:34 - if we're checking a Boolean variable we
04:37 - could write
04:40 - cloudy is equal to true but if we're
04:43 - working with booleans we can just
04:45 - shorten this to if
04:47 - the Boolean variable name
04:49 - that's valid if it's cloudy let's Echo
04:54 - it's cloudy
04:58 - else
05:01 - Echo
05:04 - it's sunny
05:06 - um let me add one line break
05:09 - line break
05:11 - line break
05:14 - and I think we're good
05:17 - the weather is good it's cloudy
05:20 - using the not to logical operator we can
05:22 - precede our condition with an
05:24 - exclamation point
05:26 - if this condition is true the not to
05:29 - logical operator will reverse it
05:31 - essentially
05:32 - so if not cloudy
05:34 - that means it's sunny
05:37 - else it's
05:39 - cloudy
05:41 - so it's cloudy
05:42 - I will change cloudy to be false
05:46 - it's now sunny
05:47 - that's basically the not too logical
05:49 - operator it will reverse the state of
05:52 - your condition
05:53 - meaning you can check to see if
05:54 - something is not true
05:57 - let's go over some practice
05:59 - in this example let's say that your
06:02 - country has elections let's assume that
06:04 - it's a democratic nation in many
06:06 - countries you have to be 18 years or
06:09 - older to vote right I'm assuming
06:12 - maybe we have variable age set the
06:15 - sequel to whatever your age is
06:17 - let's say that I'm 25 this time
06:20 - and we have a Boolean variable named
06:23 - citizen
06:25 - and I will set that to be true
06:28 - we're going to use the and logical
06:29 - operator to see if we can vote
06:32 - so with an if statement
06:35 - if variable age is greater than or equal
06:39 - to 18. I'm in the United States in order
06:42 - to vote you have to be at least 18 years
06:44 - old if we're at least 18 years old
06:47 - and we're a U.S citizen citizen
06:52 - then let's Echo
06:55 - you can vote
06:58 - in my example I'm 25 I'm a citizen
07:02 - both these conditions are true that
07:04 - means I can vote
07:07 - else if one of these statements wasn't
07:09 - true then let's Echo
07:13 - you cannot vote
07:17 - let's say that I am 12 12 years old
07:21 - well I cannot vote I'm too young
07:24 - or if I was not a citizen citizen is
07:27 - false well I cannot vote either
07:30 - another way in which you could write
07:31 - this program
07:33 - is you could say this is a little more
07:35 - complex by the way
07:37 - if age is not greater than or equal to
07:40 - 18
07:42 - or
07:44 - you are not a citizen then you cannot
07:47 - vote else
07:49 - you can vote
07:51 - I'm 18 but I'm not a citizen I cannot
07:54 - vote I'm 18 but I am a citizen you can
07:58 - vote I would probably stick with the
08:01 - previous example just because it's
08:02 - easier to read
08:04 - but this is another way in which we can
08:06 - use the notchological operator and the
08:08 - orological operator let's go over a last
08:11 - example just so that we really get the
08:13 - hang of this we're going to sell movie
08:15 - tickets
08:16 - we will have some Boolean variables
08:19 - will have a child variable
08:22 - I will set that to be false to begin
08:23 - with
08:25 - a senior I will set that to be false
08:28 - then a ticket price which I will set to
08:31 - be null to begin with
08:33 - if somebody's a child or a senior they
08:36 - get a discount
08:40 - if
08:41 - child
08:43 - or
08:46 - senior
08:47 - then the ticket price will be
08:50 - uh maybe ten dollars
08:53 - else
08:57 - ticket equals fifteen dollars
09:01 - that's quite a steep discount
09:04 - then at the end of our program let's
09:06 - Echo
09:08 - the ticket price is I'll add a
09:11 - placeholder add variable ticket
09:15 - pick a unit of currency I'll pick
09:16 - American dollars
09:19 - child is set to false we're not a child
09:21 - that's set to false we're not a senior
09:23 - that's set to false
09:26 - the ticket price is fifteen dollars the
09:29 - standard
09:30 - this is false
09:32 - or this is false that means we don't
09:35 - execute the statement we move on to the
09:37 - else statement
09:39 - if we were a child let's set that to be
09:41 - true then we get that discount the
09:43 - ticket price is ten dollars
09:46 - if we set child to be false but we're a
09:48 - senior I'll set that to be true we still
09:51 - get that discount
09:53 - all right everybody point being with
09:55 - logical operators there's many different
09:57 - ways in which we can check conditions
10:00 - there's and or not use whatever is best
10:03 - for your situation typically there's
10:06 - more than one way in which you can check
10:08 - a condition well everybody those are
10:10 - logical operators in PHP
