00:01 - hey everybody in this video i'm going to
00:03 - show you how we can generate some random
00:05 - numbers just so you know these are
00:08 - pseudo-random numbers they're not truly
00:10 - random but they're close maybe if you
00:12 - need to roll a six-sided dice for a game
00:15 - well then this would work perfect to
00:17 - generate some random numbers we'll need
00:18 - to initialize the random number
00:20 - generator by typing s rand add a set of
00:24 - parentheses semicolon within the s rand
00:28 - function we'll need a seed what
00:30 - programmers typically do is that they'll
00:32 - use the current calendar time as a seed
00:35 - within the parentheses type time
00:37 - parentheses again then pass in null
00:41 - i'll store the first random number
00:42 - within a variable int num
00:46 - equals to generate a random number we
00:48 - invoke the rand function then i'll
00:50 - display this
00:52 - let's take a look to see what we have
00:53 - standard output
00:56 - number okay the random number that we
00:59 - have is
01:01 - 3231. using the rand function this will
01:04 - generate a random number between 0 and
01:07 - 32
01:08 - 767 but we don't necessarily need a
01:11 - number that large i just need to roll a
01:13 - six sided dice well what we're gonna do
01:15 - is follow this with modulus then the
01:18 - range of numbers we would like if i'm
01:20 - rolling a six sided dice i'll type
01:23 - modulus six modulus gives you the
01:26 - remainder of any division so take
01:28 - whatever number we roll divide it by six
01:31 - take the remainder and that's our number
01:33 - but there's one issue with this
01:35 - we have five
01:37 - two and zero
01:39 - technically the range of numbers is
01:41 - currently zero through five if we need
01:43 - one through six
01:45 - what we can do is add one
01:48 - plus one
01:50 - this should give us a random number
01:51 - between one and six
01:56 - there it is six so i tend to play a lot
01:58 - of dungeons and dragons there's
02:00 - polyhedral dice one die that we commonly
02:03 - roll is a twenty sided dice so if i
02:05 - would need a random number between 1 and
02:07 - 20
02:08 - i would say rand function modulus 20.
02:12 - my random number
02:13 - is 1. wow that's surprisingly low
02:17 - then i have a 14. maybe you need a
02:19 - random number between 1 and 100 rand
02:21 - function modulus 100
02:25 - my random number between 1 and 100 is
02:27 - 67. now i need to roll three six sided
02:30 - dice
02:32 - i'm going to create three variables
02:34 - let's name this num1
02:37 - rand function modulus 6 plus 1.
02:41 - then let's copy this paste it twice we
02:44 - have num1 num2 num3
02:47 - let's display num1 i'll add a new line
02:53 - then do this two more times for num two
02:56 - and num three
02:58 - so our three dice that we're rolling are
03:01 - five two two then again three one four
03:07 - yeah everybody that's how to generate
03:09 - some pseudo random numbers they're not
03:11 - truly random but they're close if you
03:13 - have a simple game you're working on
03:15 - this would work perfect if you would
03:17 - like a copy of this code i'll post this
03:19 - in the comments section down below and
03:21 - well yeah that's how to generate some
03:22 - random numbers in c plus
