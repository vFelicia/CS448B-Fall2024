00:00 - all right well it's time that we discuss
00:02 - variables do you remember from middle
00:04 - school or elementary school when you
00:06 - learned algebra you had to solve for
00:08 - what the value of x was X was some
00:10 - representation of a value well that's
00:12 - kind of what a variable is in
00:13 - programming it's a container that stores
00:16 - a value the variable behaves as if it
00:18 - were the value it contains there's two
00:21 - steps to creating a variable declaration
00:23 - and assignment to use a variable we have
00:25 - to first declare it we'll use the let
00:28 - keyword then a unique variable name like
00:31 - X
00:32 - then a semicolon so what we've done is
00:34 - declaration each variable name needs to
00:37 - be unique if I were to declare another
00:39 - variable named X
00:41 - we would run into an error a syntax
00:43 - error identifier X has already been
00:45 - declared so your variable names need to
00:48 - be unique I can declare two variables X
00:50 - and Y and they both have different names
00:52 - that is fine but they can't have the
00:54 - same name the next step to creating a
00:57 - variable is to assign it a value once
00:59 - you declare your variable you don't need
01:01 - to declare it again so I'm going to
01:03 - assign X to equal some number like 100
01:06 - we can use this variable X and it will
01:09 - behave as if it was the value 100. let
01:12 - me demonstrate so if I was to
01:14 - counsel.log X
01:17 - well then it's going to display 100 if I
01:20 - were to change this value to 123 well X
01:24 - is now 123.
01:26 - you can do both declaration and
01:28 - assignment together that would look
01:30 - something like this
01:32 - let x equal 123 this is both declaration
01:36 - and assignment if you're creating a
01:38 - program and you know what your value
01:40 - should be you can assign them a value
01:42 - right away sometimes you may want to
01:44 - accept some user input so then you might
01:46 - do assignment later in two steps it's
01:49 - really up to you how you write your
01:50 - program there's a few different data
01:52 - types in JavaScript the first is number
01:55 - like 123. let's create a descriptive
01:58 - name for our variable like age we will
02:00 - store a user's age according to my
02:03 - analytics in YouTube the average age of
02:05 - my viewers is 25. so let's say that my
02:09 - age is 25.
02:10 - then if I was to console.log
02:14 - my age variable it would behave as if it
02:17 - were the number 25. let's create a few
02:19 - more variables
02:21 - another example of a number could be
02:23 - price let price equal
02:26 - 10.99 maybe it's 10.99 or some other
02:30 - unit of currency of your choosing
02:33 - then we will console.log price
02:36 - 10.99
02:37 - what about a GPA a grade point average
02:41 - my grade point average is a solid 2.1
02:44 - it's not great but C's get degrees
02:48 - console.log GPA 2.1
02:51 - using a template literal we can insert a
02:54 - variable using a placeholder within
02:56 - console.log I will use backticks let's
02:59 - write a sentence
03:01 - you are then to insert a variable use
03:04 - dollar sign curly braces
03:07 - place your variable name within the
03:09 - curly braces then we can continue our
03:11 - sentence you are variable age years old
03:16 - let's create another sentence using
03:18 - console.log
03:22 - the price is dollar sign curly braces
03:28 - price
03:29 - the price is 10.99 I'm going to insert a
03:34 - dollar sign before our price
03:37 - and that looks better feel free to
03:40 - choose some other unit of currency okay
03:42 - let's add a sentence to display our GPA
03:44 - console.log
03:49 - your GPA is colon space we're inserting
03:54 - a variable we need dollar sign curly
03:56 - braces we're displaying our GPA
03:59 - your GPA is 2.1 now if you need to
04:03 - display the data type of a variable
04:06 - you can use console.log
04:09 - then precede the variable with the type
04:12 - of keyword what is the type of age
04:16 - age is a number type
04:19 - price is also a number type same thing
04:22 - with GPA they're all numbers
04:25 - let's go over a different data type
04:30 - let's go over strings a string is a
04:33 - series of characters let's say we have a
04:36 - user's first name
04:39 - to create a string you can either use
04:41 - double quotes or single quotes
04:43 - personally I like double quotes
04:46 - then you can type in some characters
04:47 - like first name
04:50 - let's say my first name is bro feel free
04:52 - to pick your own first name
04:54 - I will display the type of my first name
04:57 - variable and it says it's a string a
05:00 - series of characters
05:02 - then I will display my name console.log
05:07 - first name
05:09 - and it is bro or whatever your first
05:11 - name is whatever you put here
05:13 - let's include our variable within a
05:16 - template literal
05:20 - your name is add a placeholder first
05:25 - name
05:26 - your name is bro
05:28 - what are some other examples of a string
05:30 - maybe somebody's favorite food
05:33 - favorite
05:34 - food
05:35 - my favorite food is pizza
05:39 - type in your favorite food
05:43 - console.log
05:47 - you like
05:49 - at our placeholder
05:52 - favorite food
05:56 - you like pizza
05:58 - maybe if I like something else like
05:59 - sushi well you like sushi
06:02 - okay another example of a string could
06:04 - be an email let email equals
06:08 - then type in your email
06:11 - I'm just going to make one up
06:13 - bro gmail.com
06:17 - console.log
06:21 - your email is
06:24 - email
06:27 - your email is bro gmail.com let me make
06:30 - the G lowercase
06:32 - now an important thing with strings is
06:34 - that strings can contain numbers after
06:37 - bro I'll add one two three
06:39 - so a string is a series of characters
06:41 - they can include numbers but we can't
06:44 - use these numbers for any sort of math
06:46 - strings have a different behavior from
06:48 - numbers numbers we can use in arithmetic
06:51 - Expressions strings not so much all
06:54 - right let's turn these lines into
06:55 - comments then I will discuss booleans
06:59 - okay booleans are either true or false
07:01 - typically they're used as Flags in your
07:03 - program
07:05 - let online equal true booleans are
07:09 - either true or false is somebody online
07:12 - or are they offline this is either true
07:14 - or false
07:16 - I will display the type of my variable
07:19 - online
07:20 - console.log type of online
07:24 - so online is a Boolean variable
07:28 - let's display our variable within a
07:30 - template literal
07:31 - type in whatever your first name is bro
07:34 - is online
07:37 - then I will insert a placeholder
07:39 - add my Boolean variable of online bro is
07:43 - online that is true if I were to change
07:46 - this to false
07:47 - bro is online is false booleans are
07:51 - typically used as a sort of flag
07:54 - so another example could be for sale is
07:57 - something for sale or not
07:59 - let's say that we are selling
08:03 - I don't know cars
08:05 - is this car for sale I could set this to
08:08 - be true or false
08:11 - let's console.log
08:13 - is this car for sale
08:18 - then I will add my Boolean variable for
08:21 - sale
08:22 - is this car for sale that is true
08:25 - another example let's say that somebody
08:27 - is enrolled in school like in college
08:30 - courses
08:31 - we could say let is student
08:35 - is somebody a student are they enrolled
08:37 - this can be true or false
08:40 - console.log
08:44 - enrolled
08:47 - colon space
08:49 - is student
08:53 - is the student enrolled in classes that
08:55 - is true so those are booleans they're
08:58 - either true or false typically we don't
09:00 - use them as direct output like you see
09:02 - here we usually use them with if
09:04 - statements to check something like if
09:06 - somebody is online do this if not do
09:08 - something else is a car for sale if
09:11 - that's true then display the car if it's
09:14 - not then hide it we'll have more
09:16 - practice with booleans when we reach if
09:18 - statements all right now what we're
09:20 - gonna do is we will close out of Dev
09:22 - tools we'll display some variables
09:24 - within our web page so let's delete
09:26 - everything we have
09:29 - I'll create three variables
09:31 - let
09:32 - full name equals type in your full name
09:38 - feel free to add a space between your
09:40 - first name and last name
09:42 - let age type in your age
09:46 - and let
09:49 - student
09:50 - equals if you're a student type true
09:53 - if you're not in school type false
09:56 - I am not in school anymore so I will
09:57 - type false we will go to our HTML file
10:01 - then add some HTML elements
10:04 - I will add three paragraph elements
10:07 - so that's one
10:09 - two three I will give my first paragraph
10:12 - an ID of P1
10:15 - then let's do the same with the other
10:18 - two paragraphs let's rename the second
10:20 - as P2
10:21 - and the third as P3
10:25 - so to change the text content of an HTML
10:28 - element
10:29 - we're going to type
10:31 - document meaning the document of our web
10:34 - page
10:35 - then we will get
10:37 - our element by its ID get element by ID
10:43 - then within a set of parentheses within
10:45 - a set of quotes we will select the ID
10:48 - that we need let's start with P1
10:51 - then add dot text content to change the
10:55 - text content
10:56 - then we will set this equal to a
10:59 - variable or a template literal
11:01 - let's begin with a variable so full name
11:07 - our P1 element should display your full
11:10 - name
11:11 - let's do this with P2
11:14 - I'm going to zoom out a little bit
11:17 - P2 dot text content equals age it says
11:21 - that I'm 25.
11:24 - and then P3
11:25 - let's display student or better yet is
11:29 - student let's change that
11:31 - is student
11:33 - false I am not a student but you might
11:36 - be though that might be true then let's
11:38 - display our variables along with some
11:40 - text using a template literal
11:43 - let's copy our full name
11:46 - your name is add a placeholder place our
11:50 - variable name
11:52 - your name is Bro Code or whatever your
11:54 - name is
11:56 - let's cut our Edge variable
11:59 - u r
12:01 - variable age years old you are 25 years
12:06 - old
12:07 - and then let's cut is student
12:11 - add a template literal
12:13 - let's say enrolled are you enrolled in
12:17 - school
12:18 - add a placeholder paste our variable
12:22 - enrolled that is false I am not in
12:25 - school anymore all right everybody so
12:27 - those are variables it's a container
12:29 - that stores a value the variable behaves
12:31 - as if it were the value it contains
12:33 - there's a couple different basic data
12:35 - types you have strings which is a series
12:37 - of text numbers and booleans there's
12:40 - more advanced data types but we'll cover
12:42 - that later and well those are variables
12:45 - in JavaScript
