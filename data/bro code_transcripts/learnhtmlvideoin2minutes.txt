00:02 - all right welcome back everybody
00:03 - in this video i'm going to show you all
00:05 - how we can add a video to a web page
00:07 - you'll need a video of one of these file
00:09 - types when i was in tokyo some number of
00:12 - years ago
00:12 - i saw a real-life mario kart racing down
00:14 - the street so what i'm going to do
00:16 - is place this mp4 file next to my
00:19 - index.html file
00:20 - and then within vs code we need a video
00:22 - element
00:23 - and we will list the src attribute equal
00:26 - to the name of our file that we're
00:28 - working with
00:29 - and in my case it's racing.mp4 now this
00:32 - video
00:32 - is massive so let's change the width of
00:35 - this using
00:36 - the width attribute width equals
00:39 - what about 500 that's a lot better
00:43 - but we'll need some controls to actually
00:45 - play this video i'm clicking on this and
00:46 - nothing's happening
00:47 - controls is a boolean attribute we only
00:50 - have to list the attribute name to add
00:52 - controls
00:53 - there we go we now have some controls
00:57 - [Music]
00:59 - now if you want this to play maybe in
01:01 - the background and you do not want
01:02 - controls you can always set this to
01:04 - autoplay
01:07 - [Music]
01:08 - but we have no way to stop this so i'm
01:11 - going to add the controls back
01:12 - if you need this muted just add the
01:14 - muted boolean attribute
01:17 - so it's playing but we can't hear
01:19 - anything and if you need this to loop
01:21 - just add
01:22 - the loop boolean attribute and this
01:24 - should loop
01:26 - yeah there it is here's another thing
01:28 - that we can try let's get rid of our
01:29 - source attribute
01:30 - and we're going to create a video
01:32 - closing tag
01:34 - and we will create nested sources within
01:37 - our video element
01:40 - source src equals our video file
01:44 - so just in case your browser doesn't
01:45 - support an mp4 video file you can always
01:48 - create
01:48 - another source let's say that we have a
01:52 - web m file as a backup just in case that
01:56 - this browser doesn't support an mp4 file
01:58 - and if for some reason that no other
02:00 - sources work you can always add a note
02:02 - this browser does not support
02:06 - html5 audio so you can write it either
02:10 - way but if you have multiple sources you
02:11 - can always have backups just in case
02:13 - this primary source doesn't work so yeah
