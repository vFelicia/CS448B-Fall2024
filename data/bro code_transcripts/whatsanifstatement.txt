00:02 - all right guys we are on if statements
00:04 - with an if statement you do something if
00:07 - a condition you set is true if not then
00:10 - don't do it it's as simple as that we'll
00:12 - ask a user what their age is if their
00:15 - age is greater than or equal to 18
00:17 - they'll be allowed into our site if
00:19 - they're under 18 well we won't let them
00:21 - in let's declare variable age int
00:24 - age then we'll create a prompt
00:27 - standard
00:28 - output enter your age
00:35 - standard
00:36 - input
00:39 - age
00:40 - okay this is how to write an if
00:41 - statement you type if then a set of
00:44 - parentheses then a set of curly braces
00:47 - if some condition within the parentheses
00:49 - is true
00:51 - you perform some subset of code we are
00:53 - going to check if age is greater than or
00:56 - equal to 18. greater than or equal to is
01:00 - a comparison operator there's other
01:02 - comparison operators such as less than
01:04 - or equals to
01:06 - less than greater than if you need to
01:08 - compare if two values are equal you use
01:11 - two equal signs you don't wanna say
01:13 - equals because then you're setting age
01:15 - equal to eighteen equals is the
01:16 - assignment operator so let's check to
01:18 - see if age is greater than or equal to
01:20 - eighteen then we'll print a message
01:23 - standard output
01:27 - welcome to the site
01:31 - okay let's try this
01:35 - enter your edge
01:36 - let's say that i'm 12.
01:38 - well it doesn't do anything since this
01:40 - condition evaluated to be false we skip
01:43 - over this body of code
01:46 - if it were true then we execute it this
01:49 - time my age is 21. i hit enter
01:52 - welcome to the site if you would rather
01:54 - do something else if a condition is
01:56 - false you can use an else statement
01:58 - an else statement you will place at the
01:59 - end
02:00 - there is no condition
02:02 - else we will print
02:04 - standard output
02:06 - you are not old enough to enter
02:11 - okay let's try this again
02:14 - and to your age i'll say that i'm 12
02:17 - you are not old enough to enter that's
02:19 - an if statement if some condition is
02:21 - true you do something if not you can do
02:24 - something else or nothing at all there
02:26 - are more conditions you can check by
02:28 - using an else if statement we can check
02:30 - another condition by adding else if
02:34 - if this condition is false
02:36 - check this else if condition
02:38 - uh let's check to see if age is
02:42 - less than zero
02:44 - that means somebody hasn't been born yet
02:49 - you
02:50 - haven't been
02:52 - born yet
02:54 - okay now check this out
02:57 - let's say that my age is negative 10.
03:01 - then i hit enter
03:02 - you haven't been born yet
03:05 - since this condition was false we
03:07 - skipped this section of code then we
03:09 - check the else if statement since this
03:12 - condition was true we execute this body
03:14 - of code then skip over the else
03:16 - statement let's add one more elsif
03:18 - statement
03:20 - else if
03:23 - age is greater than or equal to 100
03:29 - standard
03:31 - output
03:34 - you are too old to enter this site
03:40 - okay enter your age i am 120 years old i
03:43 - hit enter
03:45 - welcome to the site we check these
03:46 - conditions one by one starting from the
03:48 - top we stated that our age was 120 years
03:51 - old even though we were expecting to
03:53 - execute this body of code we instead
03:56 - executed this body of code within the if
03:58 - statement that's because our age was
04:00 - technically still greater than or equal
04:03 - to 18. so the order of your if and else
04:05 - if statements does matter it makes a
04:07 - difference if we need to execute this
04:09 - body of code if somebody's age is
04:11 - greater than or equal to 100 well then
04:13 - we should probably move that to the top
04:15 - then turn it into an if statement
04:18 - else if age is greater than or equal to
04:20 - 18 we will display this message let's
04:23 - try this one more time and to your age i
04:25 - am 120 years old i hit enter
04:28 - you are too old to enter the site so
04:31 - yeah that's an if statement
04:32 - you do something if a condition is true
04:35 - if not then you don't do it if you would
04:38 - rather do something else you can use an
04:39 - else statement if there's other
04:41 - conditions you would like to check
04:42 - before reaching the else statement you
04:44 - can use an else if statement and there's
04:46 - really no limit to these if you would
04:48 - like a copy of this code i'll post this
04:50 - in the comments section down below and
04:52 - well yeah those are if statements in c
04:55 - plus
