00:00 - hey how's it going everybody it's bro
00:01 - here hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video I'm going to be teaching you guys
00:04 - about text alignment the use of the flow
00:07 - property and the use of the position
00:09 - property and CSS so let's get into it
00:14 - before you reach the end of this video
00:16 - make sure to LIKE comment and subscribe
00:20 - so that we together can challenge and
00:22 - defeat the mighty YouTube algorithm
00:25 - everyone so for this video I would say
00:28 - that this is going to be three different
00:30 - mini topics all rolled into one video
00:32 - just because I don't think it'd be worth
00:34 - it to create an individual video for
00:36 - each of these topics because they really
00:38 - won't take too long
00:39 - so we're just going to cover them all in
00:40 - one video so if you want to skip forward
00:43 - look in the description for any
00:44 - timestamps and these are things we'd
00:47 - want to cover before we move on to the
00:48 - topics of navigation bars and drop-down
00:51 - menus so let's begin with the text
00:53 - alignment property we can use the text
00:56 - alignment property to position text to
00:58 - the left to the center or to the right
01:00 - but first we'll want to create some
01:02 - sample text so I'm just going to put
01:03 - this within a paragraph tag and I will
01:06 - give this a unique ID of maybe p1 then
01:09 - let's close this right away and then I
01:12 - will just type in the word left so now
01:15 - I'm going to copy this and paste it a
01:17 - few times and we'll create a few other
01:19 - lines so we'll make the second line p2
01:21 - and we'll call this Center and the third
01:24 - line p3 and we will say right let's save
01:28 - reload the page and move on to our style
01:30 - sheet now by default all text is aligned
01:33 - to the left so if I were to move this
01:35 - window here all the text is being pushed
01:38 - to the left of the viewport also known
01:40 - as the browser window basically so one
01:44 - thing we can do is that we can change
01:45 - that using the text alignment property
01:47 - so if we were to target p1 and set it
01:51 - text-align:left there would actually be
01:54 - no apparent change for our word left but
01:57 - let's use a different position so maybe
01:59 - for p2 will say text-align:center
02:06 - let's save reload the page see now this
02:09 - text is in the center of the webpage
02:12 - it's in the center of
02:13 - you port or the container that it's in
02:15 - so if I were to actually resize this
02:17 - window it's going to continue to stay in
02:20 - the center and for the last one take a
02:22 - wild guess we're going to position this
02:25 - to the right so let's target P 3 and we
02:28 - will text-align:right save reload and
02:32 - you guessed it so the word right is now
02:34 - sticking to the right-hand side of the
02:36 - webpage now let's put these within a
02:38 - smaller container so what I'm going to
02:41 - do is target all paragraph elements and
02:43 - we're going to set a border spell border
02:47 - right of one pixel that is solid and we
02:52 - will specify a width of maybe 250 pixels
02:56 - so let's try this now now you can see
02:59 - that since these lines these words are
03:02 - kind of in a separate container now
03:04 - they're going to align based on the
03:07 - container that they're in so you can see
03:09 - that with the word right it's stopping
03:11 - when it reaches the edge of this
03:13 - container since we've specified it with
03:15 - and the center word is now in the center
03:18 - of this box here so that's how you can
03:21 - use the text aligned property to align
03:24 - text to the left to the center to the
03:26 - right of some sort of box or container
03:28 - or the entire webpage itself alright
03:31 - well let's move on to the use of the
03:32 - float property but I'm just going to
03:34 - turn this all into a comment so this
03:36 - will be like a clean slate then
03:38 - basically I'll get rid of all the text
03:41 - here as well so let me just edit that
03:43 - then we'll move on okay we're moving on
03:45 - to the use of the float property so an
03:48 - element that is using the float property
03:51 - will have all other elements or text
03:53 - flow around it kind of like a river
03:56 - where the river has bends and it's
03:58 - flowing around obstacles so for this
04:00 - example I have a logo that I'm going to
04:02 - use if you want to download some picture
04:04 - and pause the video feel free to do so
04:07 - otherwise you can just watch me so I'm
04:08 - just going to include an image here so
04:10 - image source equals and for me it's
04:14 - called logo dot PNG and then I'll just
04:19 - do some inline styling just to make this
04:21 - simple I'll give this a width of maybe
04:24 - 150 pixels
04:27 - and a height of 150 pixels as well all
04:34 - right let's check out this logo yep
04:37 - there it is
04:37 - all right now I'm immediately going to
04:39 - add a paragraph after this since I'm
04:43 - using sublime text I can just type in
04:44 - lorem and hit tab and I'm going to
04:46 - surround this with a pair of paragraph
04:48 - tags let's say reload the page all right
04:52 - I have to save my stylesheet - all right
04:56 - now you can see that there's this big
04:58 - blank space after the logo that's
05:00 - because this is a block level element so
05:03 - it's going to take up the entire width
05:05 - of the viewport now we can actually have
05:07 - this text start at the top here and flow
05:10 - around the picture by using the float
05:12 - property but we'll need to target our
05:15 - image then so I'm just going to type in
05:17 - IMG for image we'll say float and then
05:21 - we can either put this to the left or to
05:23 - the right so I'm going to say left
05:25 - let's save reload and now this text is
05:28 - flowing around this element because this
05:31 - element is floating but I think I'm
05:33 - going to add a little bit of a margin
05:35 - just because the text is really close to
05:37 - the logo so I'm just going to add that
05:39 - real quick
05:39 - maybe margin 5 pixels to make it look
05:42 - better I would say that's a little bit
05:44 - better now let's have this float to the
05:47 - right so I'm just going to switch left
05:48 - with right so now since this image is
05:53 - floating to the right all other elements
05:55 - are going to flow around it on the
05:57 - left-hand side but let me just copy this
05:59 - paragraph just so it's more evident
06:01 - because it's not enough text okay yeah
06:06 - you can see here that this image now has
06:08 - its own little space it's not taking up
06:10 - the entire width of the web browser then
06:12 - now let's make a container to contain
06:15 - all of these elements and we can just
06:17 - use a div tag for this so we're going to
06:19 - place a div tag here and we will end it
06:23 - after our last paragraph and then on our
06:28 - style sheet will say div and then we'll
06:32 - give this a border one pixel solid works
06:35 - like always and maybe a width of five
06:40 - pixels yeah let's change it maybe 300
06:46 - okay that's better
06:48 - you can see that since this is all
06:50 - within a container now the image is
06:52 - going to float as much to the right as
06:54 - it can otherwise if this was floating to
06:57 - the left this would now be on the left
07:00 - hand side so that's pretty cool too
07:02 - so that's basically how the flow
07:04 - property works and we're going to move
07:06 - on to the use of the position property
07:08 - so I'm just going to comment all of this
07:10 - out on our style sheet and all of this
07:13 - on our HTML document
07:15 - all right well lastly we're moving on to
07:17 - the use of the position property and
07:19 - there's five different values we can
07:21 - place here the position property is used
07:23 - to position an element someplace on your
07:26 - webpage so we're going to be covering
07:28 - the fixed relative sticky absolute and
07:32 - static positions so we're going to
07:34 - discuss the fixed position first we can
07:37 - fix an element in place within the
07:40 - viewport so to begin we'll just need
07:42 - some sample text to work with I'll just
07:44 - create an h1 heading and I will just say
07:47 - maybe the word fixed and then let's
07:50 - close this I'm also going to add a
07:52 - paragraph too so I'll take the lorem hit
07:54 - tab and then surround this with a pair
07:56 - of paragraph tags okay let's move on to
08:00 - our style sheet and I'm going to go down
08:03 - a little bit so let's change the styling
08:07 - on our h1 heading real quick so I think
08:09 - what I'll do is put a border around this
08:12 - so one pixel solid maybe I'll change the
08:16 - background too so it's easier to see
08:18 - I'll make this yellow and maybe a width
08:23 - of 200 pixels okay that should be good
08:28 - then so what we're going to do now is
08:30 - use the position property and let's set
08:34 - this to fixed so we can fix this h1
08:38 - element in place somewhere on our web
08:40 - page and we can actually give a
08:41 - direction like we want this 50 pixels
08:45 - from the top or we want this maybe 100
08:49 - pixels from the right so let's say that
08:51 - I want this on the bottom right corner
08:54 - so what I'll do is that I will say
08:56 - bottom zero or zero pixels and zero
09:01 - pixels from the right so let's save and
09:04 - reload this and now this label is now
09:07 - fixed in place to the bottom right of
09:09 - our webpage although there's a little
09:11 - bit of a margin but you'll just have to
09:13 - get rid of that otherwise if I put left
09:15 - here this would be fixed in place to the
09:18 - bottom and to the left and you can also
09:20 - put pixels here too if I want this a
09:22 - little bit higher up so 50 from the
09:24 - bottom and 50 from the left that will
09:26 - place this slightly more up into the
09:29 - right then all right well next is
09:31 - relative positioning and we can actually
09:34 - update our h1 tag by just using the
09:37 - position property again so this old
09:40 - instance of us using this position
09:42 - property would basically become null
09:44 - Bend so what we're going to type in here
09:46 - is relative and what this does is that
09:49 - this will position something relative to
09:52 - where it's normally positioned so if I
09:54 - were to take out these two lines and
09:56 - update this all right here this is where
09:59 - this h1 tag is normally positioned right
10:02 - now if we were to put these back in this
10:05 - is going to move relative to this
10:08 - location here so if we set again bottom
10:11 - 50 pixels and left 50 pixels it's going
10:14 - to move based on this location right
10:16 - here where it normally is so that's all
10:19 - what the relative positioning is it's
10:21 - positioning relative to where an element
10:24 - normally is okay we're moving on to
10:27 - sticky positioning and you might need a
10:29 - few extra paragraphs to get this to work
10:31 - because we need to use the scrollbar so
10:34 - an element that is sticky and we'll
10:37 - update the position to that so position
10:39 - sticky what this does is that an element
10:42 - that is sticky we'll stick to the
10:45 - viewport when you're scrolling but we'll
10:47 - also need to set a position for this so
10:49 - I'm just going to say top zero pixels
10:52 - let's say reload the page and what ends
10:55 - up happening is that this element is now
10:58 - sticky so when we scroll down it's going
11:01 - to stick to some position within the
11:03 - viewport so this could be useful for
11:05 - like a navigation bar if somebody's like
11:07 - scrolling
11:07 - down through the webpage they can easily
11:09 - just access the navigation Bart
11:11 - so this sticky positioning has a lot of
11:14 - uses alright guys well we're on number
11:16 - four out of five four positions and this
11:18 - next one is static and this is actually
11:21 - probably the easiest one so anything
11:23 - that is static is actually what it
11:26 - normally is by default so you can just
11:28 - say that this is the default positioning
11:31 - for elements so if you ever need to
11:34 - reset be positioning for something you
11:36 - can just set it to static and it behaves
11:38 - exactly as it normally would so that's
11:41 - probably the easiest positioning all
11:43 - things are pretty much static by default
11:45 - okay we're on the homestretch guys so we
11:48 - just have one more position to cover
11:50 - that is an absolute position so
11:53 - something can be positioned relative to
11:56 - some sort of positioned ancestor
11:58 - otherwise it's going to be relative to
12:00 - the viewport so I think this is best
12:02 - explained with a demonstration so I just
12:05 - turned everything that we had into like
12:07 - one giant comment same thing for our
12:10 - HTML document so what I'm actually going
12:12 - to be doing is drawing two different
12:14 - boxes the outside box is going to be
12:17 - positioned relatively and the inside box
12:20 - which is going to be smaller is going to
12:22 - be positioned absolutely and the smaller
12:25 - box we'll call it box two is going to be
12:28 - basically positioned relative to the
12:31 - ancestor which is the larger box so what
12:34 - we're going to do is just make a diff
12:37 - tag and I will give this a unique ID of
12:39 - maybe box one alright and then I will
12:43 - just add some text like this is relative
12:47 - it's going to be positioned relatively
12:50 - and we'll close this all right now this
12:52 - is what we're going to do between the
12:54 - div tags we're going to create another
12:56 - div section so div and we'll call this
13:00 - ID box two and we will say this is
13:07 - absolute and then close this so what's
13:11 - going to end up happening is that this
13:13 - idea of box 1 this div element is going
13:17 - to be the ancestor of our ID box 2
13:21 - let's go to our stylesheet now and
13:23 - actually create box one so we're going
13:26 - to target the idea of box one and let's
13:31 - draw a square and we're going to first
13:33 - position this relative though alright
13:38 - and let's set a background color maybe
13:42 - gray or light gray I think that'd be
13:44 - better and a width of 200 pixels and a
13:51 - height of 200 pixels and let's add a
13:55 - border as well border one pixel solid
14:01 - let's see what this looks like so far
14:03 - okay
14:05 - we still have a few more things to do
14:06 - too though let's work on box two now so
14:12 - box to and I'm actually going to copy
14:18 - this and paste it and make a few changes
14:20 - so let's make this positioning absolute
14:25 - and the background just gray not light
14:30 - gray just great and the width will be
14:32 - 100 and the height 100 let's say reload
14:35 - the page okay that works for box two
14:37 - then so check this out now box 1 is the
14:41 - ancestor of box 2 we have these two
14:44 - elements inside another set of div
14:47 - elements so box 2 is within box 1
14:51 - now since the positioning of box 2 is
14:54 - absolute what this means is that the
14:57 - position is relative to its I should say
15:04 - positioned ancestor
15:07 - all right otherwise if it doesn't have
15:11 - an ancestor it's basically just going to
15:14 - be relative to the view port all right
15:21 - so let's center box two I would say
15:25 - within box one then so if we want to put
15:28 - this in the middle what we can do is
15:29 - just type in 50 pixels from the top and
15:33 - 50 pixels from the left that should be
15:36 - in the middle then since this is 200
15:38 - pixels wide let's say reload the page
15:41 - now box 2 is now in the center of box 1
15:45 - which is the ancestor now check this out
15:47 - if we move box 1 well box 2 is still
15:50 - going to stay in the center so since
15:53 - this is positioned relatively we can
15:54 - also use this top and left property or
15:57 - bottom and right depending on what you
15:59 - want to do so from the top let's say we
16:02 - want to move this down 100 pixels and
16:05 - maybe 150 pixels from the left I'm just
16:10 - making up numbers okay let's reload this
16:13 - so now this box is positioned relatively
16:17 - so it's normally positioned up here
16:19 - right well now it's moved down into the
16:22 - right down by 100 pixels and to the
16:24 - right by 150 pixels and you can still
16:26 - see that box 2 is still basically in the
16:29 - center of box one because it's
16:32 - positioned absolutely relative to its
16:35 - ancestor so even though we moved both
16:37 - boxes box 2 is still in the center then
16:40 - okay guys I'm going to be throwing in a
16:42 - bonus round because I'm probably going
16:44 - to get some questions related to this so
16:46 - for box 1 let's say that we want this
16:49 - box to stay in the center of our webpage
16:52 - well one way that we can do this is that
16:55 - we can instead of using the left
16:57 - property just set margin left and margin
17:00 - right to auto so if we were to save this
17:04 - and reload it now box 1 is going to stay
17:06 - in the center of our webpage but we'll
17:09 - swap to like lists where we want this
17:11 - position like vertically so it's
17:14 - depending on like how large your
17:15 - webpages then basically but if you want
17:18 - to Center something horizontally just
17:21 - margin left and margin right to Ottoman
17:23 - so you could easily replace these boxes
17:26 - with maybe some sort of frame and a
17:28 - welcome message so then when somebody
17:30 - visits your webpage they'll have a giant
17:32 - welcome message like front and center
17:34 - then basically so I thought I would just
17:36 - throw this in at the end of the video
17:38 - but yeah if you would like a copy of all
17:40 - this markup I'll post it in the comments
17:42 - down below I'm sorry this was a longer
17:45 - lesson but this is something that is I
17:47 - would say necessary for CSS just because
17:50 - there's so much that you can do with
17:51 - positioning but I think we're going to
17:53 - cover transformations and animations
17:56 - pretty soon so maybe that'll make up for
17:58 - this lesson but yeah that is how text
18:01 - alignment the use of the float property
18:03 - and the position property of work in CSS
18:06 - hey you yeah I'm talking to you if you
18:09 - learn something new then you can help me
18:11 - help you in three easy steps
