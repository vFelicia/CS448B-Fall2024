00:00 - hey everybody in today's video I'm going
00:01 - to explain dictionaries a dictionary is
00:04 - one of the four basic collection types
00:06 - for beginners a dictionary consists of
00:08 - key value pairs they are ordered and
00:11 - changeable no duplicates allowed a few
00:13 - examples of key value pairs could be an
00:16 - ID and a name an item and a price but in
00:21 - today's example we'll create a
00:22 - dictionary of countries and capitals
00:24 - let's name our dictionary capitals
00:27 - capitals equals in close your dictionary
00:30 - with the set of curly braces much like
00:32 - what you do with sets the first country
00:35 - will be the USA
00:37 - to add a value to this key type colon
00:40 - then some other value
00:42 - the capital of the USA will be
00:44 - Washington DC
00:49 - separate each key value pair with a
00:51 - comma then we can add another key value
00:54 - pair so the capital of India
00:57 - that will be New Delhi
01:01 - we'll add two more
01:04 - China
01:05 - the capital is Beijing
01:09 - Russia
01:12 - the capital is Moscow I think that's
01:15 - good enough
01:17 - just as a reminder if you would like to
01:19 - see all of the different attributes and
01:20 - methods of a dictionary you can use the
01:22 - Der function pass in your dictionary
01:25 - capitals
01:26 - then we'll need to print this
01:31 - here's all the different attributes and
01:33 - methods of a dictionary
01:34 - if you would like an in-depth
01:36 - description of all these attributes and
01:37 - methods you can use the help function
01:43 - uh that's herp help there we go
01:50 - so yeah that's just a reminder
01:53 - all right let's go over a few of the
01:54 - methods
01:55 - two get one of the values from a
01:57 - dictionary you would get the key
02:00 - type the name of the dictionary
02:02 - capitals dot get let's get the capital
02:06 - of the USA
02:08 - then we'll print it
02:12 - the value associated with this key the
02:15 - USA
02:16 - is Washington DC if I picked a different
02:19 - country like India
02:21 - well then we would get that Associated
02:23 - value which is New Delhi another thing
02:26 - if python doesn't find a key this is
02:29 - what will be returned
02:30 - let's get Japan which is not in our
02:32 - dictionary
02:34 - this method would return none we can use
02:37 - this within an if statement
02:41 - if capitals dot get
02:45 - Japan
02:47 - if a value is returned
02:49 - then we will print
02:52 - that Capital exists
02:56 - else
02:58 - we will print
03:00 - that capital
03:03 - doesn't exist
03:06 - so Japan is not in our dictionary that
03:08 - Capital doesn't exist but Russia is
03:12 - that Capital does exist
03:14 - that's how to check to see if a key is
03:16 - within our dictionary you can use the
03:18 - get method
03:20 - All Right Moving On Let's update our
03:23 - dictionary
03:24 - capitals dot update So within a set of
03:28 - curly braces
03:30 - I will add a key then a value
03:33 - Germany
03:36 - followed by
03:38 - Berlin then let's print our dictionary
03:41 - I'll use a print statement
03:43 - print
03:44 - capitals
03:46 - yeah and there's Germany right there
03:49 - using the update method we can insert a
03:51 - new key value pair or update an existing
03:54 - key value pair let's also change one of
03:56 - the existing values with our key USA
03:59 - let's update the capital to be Detroit
04:05 - yeah see the value has been updated the
04:07 - capital of the USA is now Detroit
04:09 - Michigan
04:11 - to remove a key value pair you can use
04:13 - the pop method
04:15 - then pass in a key let's remove China
04:20 - no longer exists within our dictionary
04:22 - it's gone you can remove the latest key
04:25 - value pair within a dictionary by using
04:27 - the pop item method
04:29 - capitals dot pop item with pop item you
04:35 - don't need to pass in a key
04:37 - pop item will remove the latest key
04:40 - value pair that was inserted
04:41 - then we have clear
04:43 - capitals dot clear
04:45 - that will clear the dictionary it's
04:47 - pretty self-explanatory
04:50 - the next few methods are a little tricky
04:52 - to explain to get all of the keys within
04:55 - the dictionary but not the values there
04:58 - is a keys method capitals dot keys I
05:03 - think I'm going to insert this within a
05:04 - variable
05:06 - Keys equals capitals dot Keys let's see
05:10 - what happens when we print this
05:12 - the keys method will return all of the
05:15 - keys within our dictionary technically
05:18 - Keys is an object which resembles a list
05:20 - I haven't discussed object oriented
05:22 - programming yet this is a little bit
05:24 - above our level if you ever need the
05:26 - keys in a dictionary you can use the
05:27 - keys method one use is that we can use
05:30 - that within a for Loop they're iterable
05:32 - for every key in capitals dot Keys
05:37 - method
05:38 - let's print every key
05:42 - if at any time you need to iterate over
05:45 - all the keys you can use a for Loop to
05:47 - iterate over every key that is returned
05:50 - from the keys method of your dictionary
05:52 - there's also the values method
05:55 - to get all of the values within your
05:57 - dictionary
05:58 - there is a values method
06:01 - values equals capitals dot values method
06:07 - then let's print our values
06:12 - like before with the keys method the
06:14 - values method will return an object
06:16 - which resembles a list let's iterate and
06:19 - print over every value within our
06:21 - dictionary for every value in
06:25 - capitals dot values
06:31 - print every value
06:35 - here are all the values within our
06:37 - dictionary
06:39 - this next one is probably the most
06:40 - tricky it is the items method
06:43 - capitals dot items I will assign what is
06:46 - returned to a variable named items
06:49 - then we will print items
06:53 - items returns a dictionary object which
06:56 - resembles a 2d list of tuples it's
07:00 - really complicated how might this be
07:01 - useful this time we're going to use a
07:03 - for Loop to print every key comma value
07:07 - in
07:09 - capitals dot items method
07:12 - we have in essence two counters this
07:15 - time
07:16 - I will print using an fstring every key
07:19 - value pair
07:21 - I will print every key
07:23 - as well as every value in our print
07:25 - statement
07:28 - so there's our dictionary laid out we
07:31 - have iterated over every key value pair
07:33 - it's kind of an advanced topic but I
07:35 - thought I would at least bring it up now
07:37 - so yeah that's a dictionary everybody
07:39 - it's a collection of key value pairs
07:42 - they are ordered and changeable no
07:44 - duplicates allowed you have a bunch of
07:46 - different methods such as get update pop
07:50 - pop item clear then you can get the keys
07:52 - the values or both which is the items
07:56 - method we'll be using dictionaries in a
07:58 - few game programs we'll be making in the
07:59 - future and well yeah those are
08:01 - dictionaries in Python
