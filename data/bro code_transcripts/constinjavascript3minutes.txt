00:01 - hey everybody in this video i'm going to
00:03 - explain constants a constant is a
00:05 - variable that can't be changed it adds
00:08 - some security to our code to declare a
00:10 - constant you use the const keyword in
00:12 - place of var or let in this example
00:14 - we're going to create a sample program
00:16 - to calculate the circumference of a
00:18 - circle which has this formula
00:20 - circumference equals 2 times pi times
00:23 - radius let's declare all of the
00:25 - variables that we'll need we're going to
00:26 - write this program without constants and
00:28 - then later with constants and i can show
00:30 - you their usefulness we'll create three
00:32 - variables let pi
00:35 - equal
00:36 - 3.14159 just the first few digits of pi
00:40 - let radius
00:42 - and let circumference we're going to
00:46 - accept some user input we will assign
00:48 - radius equal to
00:50 - window
00:51 - dot prompt
00:54 - enter the radius
00:57 - of a circle
00:59 - then when we accept user input it's a
01:01 - string we'll need to convert that to a
01:02 - number radius equals
01:05 - and use some type conversion and convert
01:07 - our radius into a number to calculate
01:09 - the circumference of a circle we will
01:11 - set circumference equal to and follow
01:14 - that formula
01:16 - 2
01:16 - times pi times radius
01:20 - and with the radius the user will type
01:21 - that in
01:23 - at the end of our program we will
01:24 - display our result
01:27 - the circumference
01:29 - is
01:31 - circumference let's run this
01:33 - enter the radius of a circle if the
01:36 - radius is 9 i press ok the circumference
01:39 - is
01:40 - 56.54 now here's why constants are
01:42 - useful
01:43 - let's say that somebody changes our code
01:47 - pi now equals 420 69. now when we run
01:51 - this program and we type in 9 for the
01:53 - radius
01:54 - while the circumference is now 7572
01:58 - we can prevent a variable from being
02:00 - changed if we assign it as a constant in
02:03 - place of let use the const keyword and
02:06 - our variable pi is now a constant and a
02:09 - common naming convention for constants
02:11 - is that you make all of the letters
02:13 - uppercase it's not necessary but it's
02:15 - good practice then we are going to
02:17 - change that here too
02:19 - enter the radius of a circle i'll type 9
02:22 - the same as before
02:23 - and we encountered a type error
02:26 - assignment to constant variable so once
02:28 - we declare a constant we can't change it
02:31 - so if i were to get rid of this line run
02:33 - this again 9 the circumference is 56.54
02:37 - you'll want to use constants as often as
02:39 - possible if you have a variable that you
02:41 - know will not be changed later we're not
02:43 - going to assign radius and circumference
02:45 - as constants because we'll need to
02:47 - update them later in our program so yeah
02:49 - those are constants it's basically just
02:51 - a variable that can't be changed it adds
02:53 - a little bit of data security if you
02:54 - found this video helpful you can help me
