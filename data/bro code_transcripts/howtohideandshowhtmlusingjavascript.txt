00:01 - to show you how we can show and hide an
00:04 - HTML element using JavaScript in this
00:06 - video you'll need an image to work with
00:09 - once you find your image add it to your
00:11 - website folder then we are ready to
00:13 - begin we're going to create a button and
00:16 - an image element let's start with the
00:18 - button the text on the button will be
00:21 - initially hide to hide an element I will
00:24 - give this button a unique
00:26 - ID of my
00:28 - button I'll add a break then we'll
00:32 - create an image
00:33 - element this is a self-closing tag with
00:36 - this image I will set the source equal
00:39 - to either the relative file path or the
00:42 - file
00:44 - name so my file is car.jpg
00:48 - it's a little too big I'll set the width
00:51 - attribute to be like 400 pixels that's a
00:55 - decent size I will give this image a
00:57 - unique ID of my image my IMG and just so
01:03 - we can see this button I'm going to
01:05 - apply a little bit of CSS to the button
01:08 - let's select the ID of my button take
01:11 - the font size I will set it to be 2
01:15 - RM that's decent enough all right let's
01:19 - go to our Javascript file I'm going to
01:22 - create a reference to my button and my
01:24 - image let's start with the button const
01:27 - my button equals
01:30 - document. getet element by ID the ID
01:35 - that I'm selecting is my
01:38 - button let's create a reference to my
01:41 - image as well my IMG the ID was my
01:47 - IMG when I click on this button I would
01:50 - like to do something we will take my
01:52 - button and add an event
01:55 - listener add event
01:58 - listener there are two arguments an
02:01 - event type and a call back to a
02:04 - function the event type is going to be
02:06 - click when we click on the button we're
02:08 - going to do something for the Callback
02:11 - we'll write an arrow function we are
02:14 - provided with an event parameter by the
02:16 - web browser Arrow do this when we click
02:20 - on the button what code do we want to
02:22 - perform we're going to take my image
02:25 - access its style access its display
02:28 - property set it to be a string of none
02:32 - so when you click on the button it's
02:34 - going to hide the image the display
02:36 - property is set to none not only that
02:39 - let's change the text on the button
02:41 - after we hide the element let's take my
02:45 - button change the text content equal to
02:49 - be show because now I want to show the
02:53 - element so hide BEC
02:56 - show when we click on the button a
02:58 - second time nothing nothing
03:00 - happens we would like to toggle between
03:02 - hiding and displaying this element we'll
03:05 - write an if statement let's check to see
03:08 - if the display of my image is strictly
03:12 - equal to
03:13 - none is the display of my image
03:16 - currently none if so we're going to set
03:18 - the display to block because it's a
03:20 - block level element take my image access
03:24 - its style access its display property
03:28 - set it to be
03:31 - BL then within an lse
03:33 - statement place these two lines of
03:40 - code and we will change the text content
03:43 - of my button to be
03:46 - hide now when clicking the button we can
03:49 - toggle between hiding and showing this
03:51 - element the
03:53 - image now let me demonstrate something
03:56 - if we were to take my button then add it
03:59 - after the
04:00 - image here's what would
04:03 - happen let me add a break
04:07 - to so by setting the display To None we
04:11 - don't Reserve any space for that image
04:13 - my button moves up near the top of the
04:15 - window until I show it again another
04:18 - option if we would like to reserve some
04:20 - space for the image is to toggle the
04:23 - visibility not the display property
04:25 - replace display with
04:28 - visibility
04:32 - we're going to check if the visibility
04:35 - is
04:37 - hidden set the visibility equal to be
04:41 - hidden if we would like to show the
04:43 - image the visibility is going to be set
04:45 - to
04:47 - visible when we toggle the visibility of
04:50 - this image we at least reserve the space
04:52 - for it the elements that come after
04:54 - aren't going to shift near the top of
04:56 - the
04:57 - window you can use visibility or display
04:59 - depending on the project you're creating
05:01 - all right everybody so that is how to
05:03 - show and hide HTML elements using
05:09 - JavaScript
