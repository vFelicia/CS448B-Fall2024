00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well and in
00:03 - this video i'm going to teach you guys
00:04 - about the color chooser
00:06 - module in python so sit back relax and
00:08 - enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:13 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:17 - help keep this channel running
00:19 - okay everybody so before we begin we'll
00:21 - need a second import so let's add this
00:23 - at the top
00:23 - so from tk enter import
00:27 - color chooser and the reason that we
00:30 - need a second import and it's not
00:32 - included with this first import
00:34 - is because this is a sub module
00:37 - it's not necessary to add this comment i
00:39 - just like to add comments for teaching
00:41 - purposes
00:42 - so make sure you have these two imports
00:44 - before we begin
00:45 - now we'll need a window and a button
00:47 - that we can add to the window
00:49 - and when we click on the button we're
00:50 - going to select a color
00:52 - and change the background color of the
00:54 - window so let's create a window
00:56 - window equals tk followed by window dot
01:00 - main loop and then let's set the
01:03 - geometry
01:03 - so we're going to change the background
01:05 - color of the window
01:07 - after we select a color so let's select
01:09 - a fairly
01:10 - large size for a window maybe 420 by 420
01:14 - so this is the width and the height and
01:16 - then let's create a button so
01:18 - button equals button let's set some text
01:22 - text equals click me
01:26 - and we're going to set a command for
01:28 - this button
01:29 - that is called so we're going to create
01:31 - a function maybe called click
01:33 - and then we just need to pack this
01:35 - button so we can add this to the window
01:36 - so button.pack
01:38 - now we're going to need to create a
01:40 - function and we'll call it click
01:42 - so when we click on the button this
01:44 - function is going to be called
01:46 - so def click and what do we want to do
01:50 - after clicking this button what we're
01:52 - going to do is take color
01:55 - chooser and we're going to use the ask
01:58 - color function so currently this is what
02:02 - this does
02:03 - we can select a color after clicking
02:05 - this button and pick whatever color you
02:07 - want
02:08 - then you hit ok however we need to store
02:10 - this color within
02:12 - let's say a variable so we'll create a
02:13 - variable called color color equals color
02:16 - chooser dot ask color
02:18 - and then we can do something with this
02:19 - color but for now let's just print this
02:21 - color
02:22 - just to take a look to see what it
02:23 - contains so print
02:25 - color
02:29 - so let's say that i want this green
02:32 - color
02:33 - click ok this is what this prints this
02:36 - is our color
02:37 - so this is the rgb values that we have
02:41 - in this
02:41 - first element so this is the amount of
02:43 - red
02:44 - then green and then blue and the second
02:48 - element is the hexadecimal
02:49 - representation
02:51 - of these values so what we want
02:54 - is this hexadecimal value so what we can
02:57 - do
02:58 - is create a second variable to store
03:00 - this so let's just call this
03:02 - color hex color hex
03:05 - equals color and we're going to
03:08 - get the first element well technically
03:11 - it's the second element but it's the
03:13 - element at position one so this one
03:17 - this is zero index zero so we're going
03:20 - to basically extract
03:22 - this hexadecimal value and let's just
03:24 - print this just to be sure that it's
03:25 - working fine
03:26 - so print color hex
03:29 - and let's try this again but select a
03:31 - different color
03:32 - maybe i want this purple color then
03:35 - click ok
03:36 - so this is cb42ff
03:40 - and here we have cb42ff
03:43 - now let's change the background color so
03:46 - since we have this hex value that's
03:48 - actually fairly simple
03:49 - so we're going to take window dot config
03:54 - bg for background color equals
03:58 - color hex
04:01 - and this will change background
04:04 - color
04:08 - and let's set this to a sky blue color
04:12 - maybe like this click ok and it changes
04:15 - the color
04:16 - however it's not really necessary to
04:17 - continue printing these values you can
04:20 - take these out if you want
04:23 - and this would work like just the same
04:25 - then
04:27 - now this part isn't necessary but if you
04:30 - want you can condense
04:31 - these three lines of code that we have
04:33 - for our click function
04:34 - into less lines of code so what you
04:37 - could do
04:38 - instead of assigning the value
04:41 - of color at index 1 to a separate
04:43 - variable
04:44 - we can take color at index 1 get rid of
04:47 - this line
04:48 - and assign bg equals color at index 1.
04:52 - so now this is done with just two lines
04:54 - of code
04:55 - and why stop there we can write this
04:57 - with just one line of code
04:59 - so now we're going to take color chooser
05:01 - dot ask color
05:03 - get rid of this line bg equals
05:06 - color chooser dot ask color at index
05:10 - one and now this is done with just
05:14 - one line of code however it's a i would
05:17 - say a little more difficult to
05:19 - teach so that's why i kind of like to
05:21 - separate this line by line
05:24 - so if you want you can condense all of
05:25 - this into just one line of code
05:28 - so here's some ideas of where the color
05:30 - chooser sub module could be helpful
05:32 - so of course you can change the
05:34 - background color too but let's say that
05:36 - you're creating a game
05:38 - and you can customize your character or
05:40 - avatar well it would be kind of nice if
05:42 - you could have some way for the user to
05:44 - actually change maybe the character's
05:46 - hair color eye color something like this
05:48 - would actually work fairly well
05:50 - so yeah that's the basics of color
05:52 - chooser if you would like a copy of all
05:54 - this code i'll post this in the comments
05:55 - down below
05:56 - but that's the basics of color chooser
05:58 - in python
06:00 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
06:03 - learn something new
06:04 - then you can help me help you in three
06:07 - easy steps
06:08 - by smashing that like button drop a
