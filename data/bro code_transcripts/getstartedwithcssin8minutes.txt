00:00 - hey hello again friends today I'm going
00:02 - to explain how we can get started
00:03 - working with CSS so sit back relax and
00:07 - enjoy the show
00:10 - CSS is an acronym for cascading style
00:12 - sheets we're able to apply CSS
00:15 - properties to color style or otherwise
00:18 - decorate our HTML markup there's three
00:21 - different ways in which we can apply CSS
00:23 - inline internal and external we'll begin
00:27 - with inline suppose we have an H1 header
00:29 - tag
00:31 - with the title of this is my website
00:36 - let's create a few paragraphs
00:39 - we need a pair of paragraph tags
00:41 - we need some sample text I'll type lorem
00:43 - then tab
00:45 - I'll copy this paragraph
00:48 - then paste three additional paragraphs
00:51 - so we have a total of four
00:53 - to apply some CSS styling to one of
00:55 - these elements for example the body of
00:58 - our document we'll select the opening
01:00 - tag
01:02 - set the style attribute to B we can list
01:05 - one or a few CSS properties let's change
01:08 - the background Dash color of our body to
01:12 - be black
01:15 - the background is now black
01:17 - let's change the font color of the H1
01:19 - heading
01:20 - style equals color that's for the font
01:24 - color let's pick White
01:27 - then we'll do this for the paragraphs
01:36 - this is an example of inline CSS within
01:39 - the opening tag of one of your elements
01:41 - you can change the style attribute then
01:44 - list one of many CSS properties another
01:46 - method of applying CSS is internal as in
01:50 - an internal style sheet I'll undo these
01:52 - style attributes
01:58 - to apply an internal CSS style sheet
02:00 - within the head of our document
02:03 - we need a pair of style tags
02:10 - whatever elements you would like to
02:11 - apply CSS to you would list that within
02:14 - the style tags if I would like to Target
02:17 - the body of my document I would type
02:18 - body then a set of curly braces
02:22 - list your properties between the set of
02:23 - curly braces let's change the background
02:27 - Dash color of the body of my document to
02:30 - be black
02:32 - let's change the H1 heading H1 curly
02:36 - braces then I will list some CSS
02:38 - properties color white
02:42 - then let's change the paragraphs
02:44 - P curly braces we're selecting all of
02:46 - the paragraphs
02:48 - color white
02:50 - so that's an internal style sheet within
02:53 - the head of your document you need a
02:55 - pair of style tags list the element you
02:57 - would like to select add a set of curly
02:59 - braces then list one or many CSS
03:02 - properties
03:03 - let's remove the internal style sheet
03:05 - now we'll create an external style sheet
03:07 - external style sheets are probably the
03:09 - most popular method because we can make
03:11 - a style sheet that's reusable to create
03:13 - an external style sheet within our
03:15 - website folder we're going to create a
03:16 - new document I'll name this document
03:18 - style dot CSS
03:22 - we need to link this style sheet to our
03:25 - HTML file we can do that within the
03:28 - opening head tag by using a link tag we
03:32 - need to set the relationship attribute
03:34 - to b style sheet we're letting the web
03:37 - browser know that we're linking a style
03:39 - sheet
03:40 - then we need an href attribute set to
03:42 - the relative file path of our style
03:45 - sheet that are right next to each other
03:46 - I only need the file name including the
03:48 - extension
03:50 - style.css
03:52 - we have now linked this style sheet to
03:54 - this HTML file using this external style
03:57 - sheet we can select specific elements
04:00 - from our HTML file and apply CSS
04:02 - properties
04:03 - we will select the body of our document
04:06 - body curly braces I would like to change
04:09 - the background Dash color to be black
04:13 - let's change the color of the H1 header
04:16 - tag
04:17 - color colon White
04:21 - then the paragraphs
04:22 - P curly Braces Color colon White
04:27 - if you do need to apply CSS properties
04:29 - to one specific element such as this
04:32 - first paragraph We can create an ID
04:35 - within the opening tag
04:37 - ID equals think of some unique name
04:40 - I'll name the first paragraph P1
04:43 - let's do this with the other paragraphs
04:45 - the second paragraph will be P2
04:48 - the third will be P3 the fourth will be
04:51 - P4
04:53 - I'm going to delete these lines to
04:56 - select an element by ID you'll use a
04:58 - hashtag then the ID so P1
05:01 - what would I like the color to be let's
05:03 - change the color to red
05:07 - I'll select another ID
05:09 - P2 curly braces I'll change the color to
05:12 - be orange
05:15 - P3
05:16 - color will be yellow
05:21 - P4
05:22 - color will be green
05:26 - you can also apply CSS Properties by a
05:29 - Class A group within each of these
05:31 - paragraph tags I will add the attribute
05:33 - of class
05:35 - the first paragraph will be odd it's an
05:37 - odd number
05:39 - the second paragraph will be even
05:42 - the third paragraph will be odd
05:45 - the fourth paragraph will be even
05:49 - to apply any CSS to a class
05:51 - Guild type dot then the name of the
05:54 - class
05:55 - any elements within the odd class let's
05:57 - change the color to be red
06:00 - the first and the third paragraphs are
06:02 - both red because they belong to the odd
06:04 - class
06:05 - we applied the color red to anything
06:07 - within the odd class by using dot then
06:10 - the name of the class
06:12 - let's change any elements within the
06:14 - even class to be blue
06:16 - if we're selecting a class we type dot
06:18 - the name of the class even in this case
06:20 - we'll change the color to be blue
06:24 - the second paragraph is blue along with
06:26 - the fourth they're both part of the even
06:28 - class
06:30 - another nice thing about external style
06:31 - sheets is that you can apply them to
06:33 - more than one HTML file
06:35 - let's create a second HTML file
06:38 - I'll name the second file page 2.html
06:42 - to generate some boilerplate HTML within
06:44 - vs code you can type exclamation point
06:46 - then tab
06:48 - I'll open page 2 with live server this
06:50 - is page two
06:52 - I'm just going to copy all of this and
06:54 - make a few changes paste everything
06:56 - within page two
06:59 - let's change the title to be this is
07:02 - page two and we have three paragraphs
07:05 - this time
07:07 - we have our index file and page two
07:10 - to link an external style sheet to page
07:12 - two again we need that link tag
07:15 - set the relationship attribute to B
07:18 - style sheet then the href attribute will
07:21 - be the relative file path they're right
07:24 - next to each other I only need the file
07:25 - name
07:26 - style.css now when I save and refresh
07:30 - the page
07:31 - we have applied all of our CSS from the
07:33 - style sheet to page 2.html
07:36 - external style sheets are reusable so
07:38 - they're pretty nice and convenient
07:39 - alright everybody so that is an
07:42 - introduction to CSS with CSS you can
07:44 - change the font the color add
07:46 - decorations we'll get more into that
07:48 - soon you can apply CSS inline with an
07:52 - internal style sheet or external style
07:54 - sheet and that is an introduction to CSS
07:58 - foreign
