00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well and in
00:03 - this video i'm going to teach you guys
00:04 - how we can create a menu bar in python
00:07 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:13 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:16 - help keep this channel running
00:18 - all right people let's create a menu bar
00:21 - not too different from the menu bar that
00:22 - you see at the top of many programs
00:24 - there's usually a tab
00:26 - for file edit view help stuff like that
00:30 - except we're going to create one that
00:32 - doesn't have as many options or features
00:34 - it's going to be the generic brand menu
00:36 - bar like the walmart variety
00:38 - so let's begin by creating a window so
00:40 - window equals tk followed by window.main
00:44 - then we're going to create a menu bar
00:46 - and add menus
00:48 - to the menu bar and each menu is going
00:50 - to function like a dropdown menu
00:52 - where you hover over one of these tabs
00:54 - and there's a dropdown
00:56 - so we need a menu bar let's just call
00:58 - this menu bar
01:00 - menu bar equals menu and we're adding
01:03 - this
01:03 - to our window so then we're going to
01:06 - take window
01:07 - dot config and we can set the menu
01:10 - of this window to equal the menu bar
01:13 - that we just created
01:15 - with each of these tabs for your menu
01:17 - bar you need to create a separate menu
01:19 - and add
01:20 - each menu to your menu bar and the menu
01:22 - bar is added to the window
01:24 - there's different levels to this stuff
01:26 - so let's create
01:27 - a file menu because well this one has a
01:30 - file menu
01:31 - why not our program so file
01:34 - menu equals menu
01:37 - kind of like what we did with our menu
01:39 - bar except
01:41 - instead of adding this to our window
01:42 - we're going to add this to our menu bar
01:45 - so menu bar
01:49 - like that there's one other step too
01:52 - we need to use this function menu
01:55 - bar dot add
01:58 - underscore cascade this will have a drop
02:02 - down menu
02:03 - sort of effect so let's create a label
02:06 - just called file to mimic the file tab
02:09 - that you see at the top of many programs
02:11 - so label file and we're going to set the
02:15 - menu
02:16 - to equal the file menu that we created
02:20 - so file menu and let's take a look just
02:23 - to see what we have
02:25 - so here's our menu bar and here's our
02:27 - menu there's a drop down effect for this
02:30 - but we need to add actual options to
02:32 - this file menu
02:34 - so let's do that so let's begin by
02:37 - creating
02:38 - let's see we got maybe open
02:42 - save and exit that should be good
02:46 - so file menu
02:49 - dot add underscore command
02:53 - so this is a clickable option and
02:56 - let's create a label called open and we
02:59 - can open a file
03:01 - and maybe two more so we got open save
03:04 - and exit open save exit
03:12 - and let's take a look at this
03:15 - so here's the drop down menu we can open
03:18 - save exit
03:19 - now you might notice that there is this
03:21 - annoying line
03:22 - this is called a tear off you can
03:24 - actually get rid of this if you want
03:26 - so when we create this file menu we're
03:29 - going to
03:30 - set tear off to equal
03:34 - zero and that should get rid of that
03:38 - and it's gone so sometimes you might see
03:41 - a line to separate sections well
03:45 - you can do that with a separator so
03:47 - let's separate
03:48 - the exit command that we have
03:51 - from open and save and to add that
03:53 - separator we just type in the name of
03:55 - our menu
03:56 - file menu dot add
04:00 - separator so this will separate your
04:05 - different commands from each other
04:06 - within a menu you can see that there is
04:08 - a line between
04:09 - save and exit because we placed a
04:11 - separator here
04:13 - now if you want each of these file
04:14 - commands to actually do something you
04:16 - need to associate
04:17 - a command with each of these commands
04:20 - it's a command within a command
04:22 - so command equals for our open file
04:26 - command
04:26 - will create a function called open file
04:31 - and we'll need to declare that function
04:33 - and then let's create a command called
04:35 - save file and then another called exit
04:39 - actually one shortcut if you want to
04:42 - exit something you can just say quit
04:45 - all right let's create an open file and
04:47 - a save file function
04:49 - so def open file
04:53 - let's just print something just to keep
04:55 - this simple
04:57 - i already have another video on opening
04:59 - files so
05:01 - print file has
05:04 - been opened and let's do the same thing
05:08 - for
05:08 - save file
05:15 - file has been saved
05:18 - and then our last command exit will just
05:20 - quit
05:21 - so let's try this so let's go to file
05:25 - here's the drop down menu we can open a
05:27 - file file has been opened
05:29 - we can save a file and then exit and
05:32 - exit will close out of our window
05:34 - let's create a second menu called edit
05:37 - to mimic the one that we have at the top
05:38 - of our ide
05:40 - so let's create a edit menu so it's the
05:42 - same process that we did with our file
05:44 - menu
05:45 - so let's call this edit menu equals menu
05:49 - we're adding this to our menu bar and i
05:52 - do not want a tear off so
05:54 - tear off equals zero then for the next
05:57 - line we need to add
05:59 - cascade so i'm going to copy this
06:02 - menu bar dot add cascade the label name
06:05 - will be
06:06 - edit and the file i mean the menu
06:09 - will be edit menu and we're setting
06:12 - this menu that we're adding to edit menu
06:16 - and let's try this so we have file and
06:19 - edit
06:19 - but we need to add commands to this edit
06:22 - menu
06:22 - so it's the same process that we did
06:24 - with our file menu i'm just going to
06:26 - copy this
06:27 - change file to edit and let's make a
06:31 - command called cut copy and paste
06:34 - so the label will be cut we'll create a
06:38 - command called
06:39 - cut we'll copy this
06:44 - and we'll create a another command
06:46 - called
06:48 - copy and then paste
06:58 - all right then we just need to create
07:00 - some functions for this so cut copy
07:02 - paste
07:03 - let's do that at the top
07:08 - so cut
07:14 - you cut some text
07:20 - so cut copy and then paste
07:25 - you copied some text
07:29 - and paste you
07:32 - pasted some text
07:35 - all right let's try this so here's our
07:38 - edit menu
07:39 - here's the drop down we can cut we can
07:42 - copy
07:43 - and we can paste not actually but it's
07:45 - going to call a function that can
07:48 - do something like that if you want to
07:49 - set that up maybe that's a video for a
07:51 - different day
07:52 - let's customize these menus well because
07:54 - we can
07:55 - so let's begin by changing the font so
07:58 - we can just type in within each of these
08:00 - menus
08:01 - font equals pick a font that you want
08:04 - and then a size
08:05 - so i'm going to add this font for both
08:07 - of these menus that we have
08:09 - and then when we hover over and click on
08:12 - these menus you can see that the font
08:14 - has changed
08:15 - did you guys know that you can actually
08:17 - add images next to each of these
08:19 - commands
08:19 - well you can and this is how we can do
08:21 - that first you'll need some images
08:23 - here's a few that i'm using so add these
08:26 - to your project folder
08:27 - i plan on using a floppy disk for save
08:29 - and open folder for open
08:31 - and for some reason a stop sign for exit
08:34 - because i couldn't really think of
08:35 - anything at the moment
08:36 - i guess an arrow would work too i guess
08:39 - so let's create some photo images out of
08:41 - these images
08:43 - so i already did this i'm just going to
08:45 - copy and paste the text that i had
08:47 - so create a unique name for each image i
08:50 - have open image
08:51 - save image and exit image they're all
08:54 - photo images
08:55 - and here is the file path or the file
08:58 - name for each of these
08:59 - pictures that i'm using so to add an
09:02 - image
09:02 - to each of these commands when you add
09:04 - the command we can just say
09:06 - image and then the photo image that you
09:08 - want to use
09:09 - so with my open command i'm going to use
09:12 - this
09:13 - open image photo image that i have and
09:15 - this is the open folder
09:17 - so i'm going to do the same thing for
09:19 - save and exit
09:21 - so we have save image and
09:24 - exit image
09:28 - but when we run and compile this let's
09:31 - take a look
09:32 - yeah so all the text is gone that's
09:35 - going to be a problem
09:36 - so we'll need to compound views so with
09:39 - compound we can add
09:40 - an image on a certain side of the text
09:43 - and keep the text so compound
09:47 - let's say we want the image on the left
09:50 - so
09:50 - compound left and i'm just going to add
09:52 - this to each of these commands
09:56 - and now we should have an image as well
09:59 - as some text
10:01 - well that's the basics of creating a
10:03 - menu bar in python if you want a copy of
10:05 - all this code
10:06 - i'll post all of this in the comments
10:08 - down below but yeah that's how you can
10:10 - create a simple
10:11 - menu bar in python hey you
10:14 - yeah i'm talking to you if you learn
