00:00 - hey everybody today I'm going to explain
00:01 - the map function in Python the map
00:04 - function applies a given function to all
00:07 - items in a collection the map function
00:10 - takes at least two arguments a function
00:12 - and a collection we will apply this
00:14 - function to every item in this
00:17 - collection here's what we'll do we will
00:19 - create a list of temperatures in Celsius
00:23 - which will convert to be Fahrenheit we
00:25 - have a list of Celsius temps make up
00:28 - some numbers
00:36 - that's good enough for this example then
00:38 - at the end I will print my list of
00:40 - temperatures in
00:45 - Celsius we would like to convert all
00:47 - these temperatures from Celsius to
00:49 - Fahrenheit well we can use the map
00:50 - function for that but we'll need a
00:52 - function to pass in as an argument
00:55 - there's two ways in which we can do that
00:57 - we can declare a function and pass in
00:59 - the name of that function or use a
01:01 - Lambda function let's start by defining
01:04 - a function let's name this function C2 F
01:08 - meaning Celsius to Fahrenheit we have
01:11 - one argument a temp for
01:14 - temperature once we receive our
01:16 - temperature in celsius we can return the
01:20 - following
01:22 - formula take our
01:24 - temp multiply it by 9 / 5 + 32
01:31 - so now using the map function let's
01:34 - create a new list of Fahrenheit
01:36 - temps I think I spelled that right I can
01:38 - never spell Fahrenheit we're going to
01:41 - use the map function we have to pass in
01:43 - a function and a collection which
01:46 - function would we like to apply to every
01:48 - item in this collection we're going to
01:51 - take the name of our function C to F
01:54 - that's the first argument and the second
01:57 - argument is the collection our Celsius
02:01 - temps and then we will print our
02:03 - Fahrenheit
02:05 - temps so the map function returns a map
02:10 - object they are iterable we can iterate
02:13 - over it using a for Loop like so for
02:17 - every temp in Fahrenheit
02:21 - temps print each
02:26 - temp that would give me these new
02:28 - temperatures in fut right if you would
02:31 - like to keep it as a list when we're
02:34 - done mapping we can enclose this
02:36 - function within a list function to typ
02:39 - cast it to a
02:40 - list and then I will print my Fahrenheit
02:43 - temps and it should be a list which it
02:46 - is so using the map function we have
02:49 - converted these temperatures which were
02:52 - originally in celsius to
02:54 - fahrenheit if we would rather not Define
02:56 - a function we could use a Lambda
02:59 - function instead
03:00 - so we don't clutter the namespace and
03:02 - have to think of unique names for each
03:04 - function let's copy this equation delete
03:07 - our
03:08 - function when we pass in the name of a
03:10 - function as an argument we will instead
03:13 - write a Lambda
03:15 - function a Lambda function is a small
03:17 - Anonymous function we type Lambda any
03:20 - parameters we had one parameter of temp
03:24 - colon then what would we like to return
03:27 - the formula that we just copied we'll
03:30 - paste it this should work too it does
03:33 - work and here are the temperatures in
03:36 - Fahrenheit all right everybody that is
03:38 - the map function it applies a given
03:40 - function to all items in a collection
03:43 - one by one and well everybody that is
03:45 - the map function in Python
