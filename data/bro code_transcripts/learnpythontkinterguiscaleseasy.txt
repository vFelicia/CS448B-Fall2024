00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's ibro
00:01 - here hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video i'm going to teach you guys how we
00:04 - can create a
00:05 - sliding scale in python so sit back
00:08 - relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - if you find this video helpful please
00:14 - remember to like
00:15 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:17 - help keep this channel running
00:20 - let's create a scale so we'll need a
00:21 - window window equals tk
00:24 - followed by window.mainloop we'll create
00:27 - a scale
00:28 - called scale scale equals scale
00:31 - we need to add the scale to our window
00:33 - so we'll put that here
00:35 - we can list a from position and a two
00:38 - position
00:39 - both of these values will be our range
00:41 - of values that we can use
00:43 - for our scale so from
00:46 - make sure to add an underscore after
00:48 - from it won't work without this
00:49 - underscore
00:51 - from equals let's say 0 and 2 equals 100
00:55 - so we're going to create a scale for
00:57 - temperature
00:58 - and this will be in celsius so 0 will be
01:01 - freezing and 100 will be the boiling
01:04 - point uh you know for water
01:06 - so then to display the scale we'll need
01:08 - to add
01:09 - scale.pack and let's run this
01:12 - so the front position is zero so that's
01:15 - at the top here
01:16 - and then if you go down it increases so
01:18 - you can actually flip this
01:20 - so we'll save from 100 and two
01:23 - will be zero now you can scroll up
01:27 - and the number will increase let's also
01:30 - get the current value so we'll need a
01:33 - button
01:35 - so button equals button
01:39 - we'll add this to the window we'll add
01:41 - some text
01:43 - text equals submit and then a command
01:47 - command equals submit but we'll have to
01:50 - make this function
01:52 - so let's do that outside the window def
01:55 - submit and we will simply print the
01:59 - current temperature
02:00 - so let's display message the temperature
02:04 - is plus
02:08 - scale dot get
02:12 - plus degrees
02:16 - celsius we can just say degree c
02:19 - so let's try this but we also have to
02:22 - pack the button so button.pack
02:27 - so if we were to try and submit this
02:31 - right now scale.get is going to return
02:33 - an integer so we need to convert this to
02:35 - a string
02:37 - so str scale.get
02:41 - and you have to do that with python if
02:42 - you're displaying a
02:44 - integer value along with another string
02:47 - you need to convert it to a string so
02:50 - now this should work
02:51 - so it is 82 degrees celsius
02:56 - so let's do some cosmetic changes for
02:58 - our temperature gauge
03:00 - because right now it's kind of ugly
03:03 - so the first thing we'll change is
03:07 - let's say the length so length equals
03:10 - 600 so that should be fairly large
03:16 - you can also set the orientation so that
03:20 - is
03:20 - orient spelt like that
03:25 - so this can either be vertical which it
03:27 - currently is
03:30 - or horizontal
03:36 - but i'll keep this as vertical
03:40 - so i'll let a comment that this is
03:42 - orientation
03:44 - of scale let's also change the
03:48 - font so font equals
03:51 - pick whatever font you want
03:55 - and a size so maybe 20.
04:02 - now you can add some tick intervals
04:07 - maybe i'll set this to 10. so these will
04:10 - be
04:11 - numeric indicators on the scale
04:21 - and show value this hides the current
04:24 - value
04:25 - so if you set this to zero this will
04:27 - hide
04:28 - current value
04:33 - so it no longer displays what the
04:34 - current value is next to the slider
04:38 - to actually retrieve it you'd have to
04:40 - get the value
04:41 - so right now it's 40 but it helps that
04:43 - you have the tick intervals on the left
04:45 - hand side
04:47 - i should probably add that this adds
04:52 - uh numeric
04:55 - indicators for
04:58 - value good enough let's continue on
05:02 - now let's use the set function we can
05:04 - set the current value of the knob on our
05:07 - scale
05:08 - and by default it is zero so we can use
05:10 - the scale
05:11 - dot set function and we can place a
05:14 - number in here a value
05:16 - so let's say we want this to be 100 so
05:19 - this is now
05:20 - at the 100 position instead of zero if
05:22 - we wanted this in the middle we could
05:24 - set this to 50
05:26 - and now it's in the middle however if
05:28 - you change the
05:30 - range of your skill of from minus 2
05:33 - and set this to 50 now 50 is all the way
05:36 - down here so it no longer appears in the
05:38 - middle
05:38 - so this isn't really necessary but if
05:40 - you want this to be a little more
05:42 - sophisticated
05:43 - there's actually a formula that you
05:44 - could use we can use scale
05:46 - straight braces and then place the word
05:49 - from
05:49 - within here this will give us our max
05:52 - basically
05:53 - so this is from without an underscore so
05:56 - this not this this
06:01 - scale from minus scale
06:04 - 2. and then we're going to divide this
06:08 - by 2
06:09 - and then i'm just going to put this
06:10 - within a extra set of parentheses
06:14 - plus scale 2. just in case
06:18 - our two value is greater than zero
06:22 - we just want to account for that and
06:24 - then i'm just going to
06:26 - put these within another set of
06:27 - parentheses so
06:29 - this should always appear in the middle
06:31 - then even if we were to change this
06:33 - range
06:37 - yeah it seems like it works uh like i
06:39 - said it's not really necessary but
06:41 - if you want this to be a little more
06:42 - sophisticated that would work
06:44 - now let's make some cosmetic changes to
06:46 - this scale and make it look pretty
06:48 - so first let's change the trough color
06:51 - this
06:52 - is this gray portion right here
06:56 - so let's set the trough color
07:00 - equals whatever color you want you could
07:02 - say like blue
07:04 - or you can place a hex value here and i
07:06 - actually picked one out already
07:08 - so i'm going to use 6 9 e
07:11 - a f f and that is this icy blue color
07:15 - kind of like
07:16 - this is sliding on ice
07:19 - and i'm also going to change the font
07:21 - color
07:24 - and i'm going to pick this fiery red
07:26 - color
07:28 - to symbolize heat
07:33 - and then you can change the background
07:34 - color too
07:37 - so that is bg and i'll just set this to
07:41 - like black
07:45 - it's looking kind of cool now right and
07:48 - for no good reason i'm going to add some
07:50 - pictures
07:52 - so feel free to pause the video if you'd
07:53 - like to download some images i'm going
07:55 - to use an
07:56 - image of a flame for the hot side of our
07:58 - scale
07:59 - and a snowflake for the cold side so
08:02 - let's begin
08:03 - by adding the hot image
08:07 - to the scale before we actually add the
08:09 - scale to the window
08:10 - so we'll do this after we instantiate
08:12 - the window because that's the only place
08:14 - that we can do that
08:15 - so we're going to create a image i'll
08:17 - just call this hot image
08:18 - for the fire icon so hot image equals
08:22 - photo image file
08:25 - equals this is hot dot png
08:28 - so hot dot png we're going to add the
08:32 - image to a label
08:34 - i'll call this hot label hot label
08:38 - label image equals
08:41 - hot image and then we need to pack this
08:44 - so hot label dot pack
08:49 - and this should appear at the top let's
08:52 - test it
08:53 - yep there it is let's do the same thing
08:55 - for the cold side
08:58 - so i'll add this here before the button
09:02 - and i'm going to replace hot with cold
09:05 - same thing with the file name
09:06 - cold.png
09:10 - this will be cold label cold
09:13 - image and cold label dot pack
09:17 - and that should be it let's take a look
09:20 - not too shabby it's looking pretty sweet
09:22 - it has our submit button at the bottom
09:24 - too uh so
09:26 - right now the temperature is 100 degrees
09:28 - celsius
09:29 - the temperature is 0 degrees celsius the
09:32 - temperature is 60 degrees celsius
09:34 - well that's how to create a scale in
09:37 - python if you would like a copy of all
09:38 - this code i'll post all of this in the
09:40 - comments down below
09:41 - but yeah that's how to create a scale in
09:43 - python
09:45 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
09:48 - learn something new
09:49 - then you can help me help you in three
09:52 - easy steps
09:53 - by smashing that like button drop a
