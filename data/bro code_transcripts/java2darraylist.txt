00:00 - hey how's it going everybody it's bro
00:01 - here hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video I'm going to be teaching you guys
00:04 - about 2-dimensional array lists and Java
00:07 - so let's get into it if you find this
00:11 - video helpful please remember to Like
00:14 - comment and subscribe
00:15 - your support will help keep this channel
00:17 - running hey everybody so we're gonna be
00:20 - discussing 2d array lists and what this
00:22 - is is that it's a dynamic list of lists
00:25 - it's a list of separate lists so you can
00:28 - actually change the size of these lists
00:30 - during run times so that's kind of an
00:31 - advantage of array lists over just
00:33 - standard arrays so before we begin make
00:36 - sure you have this import at the top and
00:38 - what I'm thinking for this video is that
00:40 - we're going to create separate shopping
00:42 - lists and at the end we're going to add
00:44 - these separate shopping lists to an
00:46 - ArrayList it's going to be a list of
00:48 - separate lists so let's create a
00:50 - ArrayList for maybe bakery goods like
00:54 - things we need to buy at the bakery at a
00:56 - grocery store so we'll create an
00:58 - ArrayList and then we need some angle
01:00 - brackets and then with array lists these
01:02 - store objects so we need to use the
01:04 - wrapper class of the data type that
01:05 - we're storing so for example if you need
01:07 - to store integers you're going to use
01:09 - the wrapper class of integer well let's
01:11 - store some strings because we're storing
01:14 - the names of things we need to buy so
01:16 - let's call this ArrayList Bakery list
01:20 - and we're going to set this equal to new
01:23 - array list alright let's add a few
01:28 - things to our bakery list so bakery list
01:31 - dot add and what do we want to buy it
01:34 - maybe some pasta and maybe two other
01:38 - things how about some garlic bread
01:42 - everybody loves garlic bread and
01:45 - doughnuts because I like doughnuts
01:47 - okay so we have an array list called
01:50 - bakery list and it has these three items
01:52 - we can actually display our bakery list
01:54 - by using a print line statement and
01:56 - we're going to place our bakery list
02:00 - within here and we have pasta garlic
02:03 - bread and donuts now if you want to
02:05 - retrieve a certain element of this list
02:07 - we use the dot get method and we
02:10 - specified index so zero would be
02:13 - pasta so let's create a few other lists
02:15 - so I'm just going to copy this and for
02:19 - the next list let's have this be a
02:21 - produce list so fruit and vegetables so
02:23 - produce list and we need to change this
02:26 - here as well so we'll change bakery list
02:29 - to produce list for this next ArrayList
02:32 - and let's add some Tomatoes and what
02:36 - goes the pasta maybe some zucchini and
02:39 - maybe peppers okay and then we'll just
02:44 - add one more so what about a drinks list
02:49 - so we'll change produce to drinks and
02:52 - let's say we only want two drinks so
02:55 - these lists don't have to be the same
02:58 - size as each other because they're all
02:59 - independent lists so let's say that we
03:02 - want soda and we want coffee and let's
03:08 - display our drinks list oh we should
03:12 - probably change this here as well so
03:14 - make sure you do that okay
03:16 - we'll display our drinks list which has
03:18 - just soda and coffee now we have these
03:22 - separate array lists one for each aisle
03:25 - of a grocery store well at least just a
03:27 - few of them so what we can do is
03:28 - actually add all of these separate lists
03:31 - to one list and we can call it maybe
03:33 - grocery list
03:34 - it will contain different lists of what
03:36 - we need to buy at the grocery store and
03:37 - they're all kind of organized by their
03:40 - section we have one for bakery goods we
03:42 - have one for produce and we have one for
03:43 - drinks so let's create a 2d array list
03:46 - to contain the separate array lists so
03:48 - what we're gonna type is array lists and
03:52 - then within the angle brackets we list
03:54 - the data type of what we want to store
03:56 - and what we want to store this time is
03:58 - array lists of strings so we're going to
04:01 - place this within angle brackets so
04:03 - array lists and within the angle
04:06 - brackets array list again and this store
04:08 - strings so we need a name for this 2d
04:11 - ArrayList and the name should be
04:14 - descriptive of what it contains so we'll
04:17 - just say grocery list because it
04:19 - contains separate lists of things we
04:21 - need to buy at the grocery store and
04:23 - they're all organized by section
04:25 - so grocery list equals new array list
04:30 - and then we need to add these separate
04:33 - array lists to our 2d array list so what
04:36 - we're going to do is take our grocery
04:38 - list and then we're going to add
04:41 - whatever lists that we want to add so we
04:44 - need to add our Bakery list and we're
04:48 - going to do the same thing for our
04:49 - produce list and our drinks list so
04:52 - we'll change bakery to produce and then
04:56 - lastly we need drinks so drinks list so
05:01 - then if we take our grocery list and
05:03 - then display this what we end up seeing
05:05 - is that we get the total sum of
05:08 - everything that's within our grocery
05:10 - list and they're all arranged by section
05:12 - or ArrayList you can see that they're
05:14 - all separated with a comma so it's a
05:17 - list of Lists now let's say that you
05:19 - want to retrieve just one list from this
05:22 - ArrayList well you can use the get
05:24 - function and then you can retrieve
05:26 - something by its index so let's say that
05:29 - we want the first list in this 2d
05:31 - ArrayList we're going to get index 0 and
05:34 - this will retrieve the first list now
05:37 - let's say that we want the first element
05:39 - of our first list we're going to add dot
05:43 - gap again and then the index for the
05:46 - element of this inner list so if you
05:49 - want the first element of the first list
05:51 - we type in dot get 0 and dot get 0 again
05:56 - and then when we run this we have pasta
05:59 - now if we want the last index so this is
06:03 - let's see
06:05 - this is list 2 item number 1 so all
06:10 - right get to item number one and this
06:13 - retrieves coffee so that's the basics of
06:16 - 2d array lists it's just a container for
06:18 - separate array lists you can do this
06:20 - with other collections too but we've
06:22 - only really covered array lists so if
06:25 - you want a copy of all this code I'll
06:26 - post this in the comments down below but
06:28 - yeah that's how to dimensional array
06:30 - lists work in Java hey you yeah I'm
06:34 - talking to you if you learn something
06:35 - new then you can
06:37 - help me help you in three easy steps
