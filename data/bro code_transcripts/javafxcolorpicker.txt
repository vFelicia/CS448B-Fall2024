00:00 - yo what's going on everybody it's you
00:02 - bro hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to give you
00:05 - all a demonstration of the color picker
00:07 - node in
00:07 - javafx so sit back relax and enjoy the
00:11 - show
00:13 - all right welcome back people we're
00:15 - going to be using the color picker node
00:17 - to change the background color of our
00:19 - pain
00:20 - so let's pick any old pain i'll use an
00:22 - anchor pain just because that's what
00:23 - we've been working with
00:25 - and i will give this pain a unique id
00:27 - let's say
00:28 - my pane then we need a color picker
00:32 - let's go to controls
00:34 - and drag and drop it normally the
00:36 - default color is white you can change
00:37 - that if you want
00:38 - so to change that go to properties value
00:41 - and pick any sort of color that you want
00:43 - i'll just set it to black you can also
00:44 - change the transparency too
00:46 - now let's head to the code drop down
00:48 - menu and give this color picker a unique
00:50 - id
00:51 - my color picker works
00:55 - and when we click on the color picker
00:57 - and select a color
00:59 - what method do we want to call so let's
01:01 - create a method
01:03 - named change color okay let's save
01:07 - make sure that our controller class is
01:09 - linked
01:11 - and let's head to our controller class
01:13 - now head to your controller class we
01:15 - need to
01:15 - inject our fxml and we will declare
01:19 - our pain pain my
01:22 - pain as well as our color picker
01:26 - at fxml private
01:30 - color picker my
01:34 - color picker
01:38 - and we need to declare that method of
01:41 - change color public void change
01:45 - color there is one parameter action
01:48 - event event
01:52 - now when we select a color we need to
01:54 - get that color
01:55 - color my color equals
01:59 - my color picker dot
02:03 - get value this will return a color
02:06 - object
02:07 - so we will store that within color my
02:09 - color
02:10 - and to change the background color of a
02:12 - node or pane type
02:13 - the name of that pane or node dot set
02:17 - background and we will pass in a new
02:21 - background and then pass in a
02:25 - new background fill
02:28 - there's kind of layers to this and then
02:30 - pass in
02:31 - my color there's three arguments here my
02:35 - color
02:35 - then corner radii
02:40 - dot empty
02:43 - insets dot empty
02:47 - alternatively you can set these last two
02:49 - arguments to null
02:50 - i think i'll change them to null just to
02:52 - keep it simple
02:54 - okay and we should be good
02:57 - so here's our fancy color picker and we
02:59 - can change the background color
03:01 - of our pin well everybody so that is
03:04 - the simple color picker in javafx i will
03:07 - post this code to the comments section
03:09 - down below
03:10 - but yeah that is the color picker node
03:12 - in javafx
