00:00 - hey welcome back everybody we have
00:02 - finally made it to the portion of the
00:03 - series where we will be connecting to a
00:06 - myosql database at this point in the
00:08 - series you will need to be familiar with
00:10 - mySQL queries I do have a full course on
00:13 - that on my Channel for free it's about
00:14 - three hours but yeah moving forward we
00:17 - will need to know MySQL there's two
00:20 - popular ways to connect to a mySQL
00:22 - database the first being the mysqli
00:25 - extension this is what we'll be using
00:27 - the other is PDO meaning PHP data
00:31 - objects many developers prefer PDO over
00:34 - mysqli because it can connect to more
00:37 - than just a mySQL database I believe you
00:39 - can connect up to 12 additional
00:41 - databases you know postgres being one of
00:43 - them however you would need to know
00:45 - object oriented programming which is an
00:48 - intermediate topic and we have not
00:49 - covered that yet as beginners we'll
00:51 - stick with the mysqli extension it's
00:54 - procedural alright well let's get
00:56 - started we'll need to create a mySQL
00:59 - database within our zamp server you'll
01:01 - need to open up the zamp control panel
01:03 - which is this thing make sure that these
01:06 - two modules Apache and MySQL are both
01:09 - started
01:10 - we will need to access
01:12 - phpmyadmin which you can do so by
01:14 - clicking on the admin button next to
01:16 - mySQL
01:18 - that should bring you to phpmyadmin
01:22 - otherwise you can just type in this web
01:24 - address localhost slash phpmyadmin
01:27 - phpmyadmin allows you to configure your
01:30 - database you can make SQL queries
01:32 - monitor the status export import data
01:35 - we'll be covering just some of the
01:37 - basics to create a database go to the
01:40 - databases tab
01:41 - we will create a database come up with a
01:44 - database name in the MySQL series we
01:47 - created a database named businessdb
01:50 - we'll stick with that but you can really
01:52 - name it anything then we will hit this
01:55 - create button
01:56 - we can create a table but we'll do that
01:58 - in a future topic let's be sure that
02:01 - that database is actually created let's
02:03 - click on our server go to databases yeah
02:06 - it's right here
02:07 - to drop a database you can check the
02:09 - database that you create then press the
02:12 - drop button but we don't want to do that
02:13 - but that's how there is some information
02:16 - we'll need about our MySQL server if you
02:19 - go to user accounts
02:21 - we will need some of this information
02:22 - such as the host name
02:25 - the username of root
02:28 - if there is a password for the server
02:30 - which there currently isn't
02:32 - and that's about it you can edit
02:33 - privileges too but that's outside of the
02:36 - scope of this topic all right we have
02:38 - now created our database
02:40 - so let's close out of phpmyadmin
02:43 - make sure that your MySQL server is
02:45 - running it currently is
02:49 - I'm going to create a separate PHP file
02:52 - just to manage our database connection
02:54 - so let's create a new file
02:57 - I will name this database.php
03:00 - anything related to connecting to our
03:02 - database we will handle within this PHP
03:05 - file
03:06 - this will be a PHP script
03:10 - we will declare a few variables
03:12 - the first will be DB underscore server
03:17 - this holds the name of the server
03:20 - for us that was localhost
03:24 - then DB user
03:27 - that was root
03:30 - a password DB underscore password I'll
03:34 - say just pass
03:35 - we did not have a password I will leave
03:37 - that MD then the name of the database DB
03:41 - underscore name
03:43 - I named my database business DB
03:48 - then we will declare a connection
03:50 - variable
03:51 - we'll shorten this to con meaning
03:53 - connection
03:54 - I will set that to be empty okay these
03:57 - are the variables that we'll need
03:59 - to establish a connection to the mySQL
04:01 - database we will take our connection
04:03 - variable set this equal to the MySQL I
04:08 - underscore connect function there are
04:12 - four arguments within this function the
04:15 - database server name username password
04:17 - and the name of the database let's add
04:21 - these variables as arguments
04:25 - so server user
04:28 - then password
04:30 - then
04:32 - database name
04:38 - let me make some more room I'll put
04:40 - these on a new line just for readability
04:42 - but there should be no change to its
04:44 - functionality if I do this
04:47 - if we establish a successful connection
04:49 - this variable is technically what is
04:52 - known as an object we haven't discussed
04:54 - object oriented programming it will
04:57 - represent our current connection one of
05:00 - the few ways in which we can check to
05:01 - see if our connection is up and running
05:03 - is we can use an if statement
05:06 - then place your connection within the if
05:08 - statement
05:10 - if a connection exists let's Echo
05:16 - you are connected
05:20 - else for testing purposes let's Echo
05:26 - could not connect
05:28 - I will save and reload everything
05:31 - then go to your database PHP file
05:34 - localhost slash website slash database
05:39 - dot PHP
05:41 - you are connected all right
05:44 - I'm going to stop the MySQL server then
05:47 - try and reconnect
05:50 - we get this ugly error message
05:53 - fatal error uncut mysqli SQL exception
05:57 - for some reason if we can't connect to
05:59 - our database we don't want to display
06:01 - this error to the user we should use
06:03 - some exception handling we don't want to
06:06 - print any ugly error messages to the
06:08 - user they will have no idea what's going
06:10 - on
06:10 - I suggest when we attempt to create a
06:12 - connection we surround this code with
06:14 - the try block
06:16 - this has to do with the topic of
06:18 - exception handling
06:21 - we can try some code that might cause an
06:24 - error such as if we can't connect to our
06:26 - database
06:27 - let me just fix these
06:31 - we will try and make a connection if we
06:34 - encounter this exception I'll copy it
06:37 - we can take some other course of action
06:40 - after our try block let's add catch
06:43 - parentheses curly braces then add the
06:46 - name of that exception within the set of
06:48 - parentheses in place of displaying this
06:50 - error to the user
06:52 - let's Echo a message such as could not
06:55 - connect and I'll steal that here
06:58 - I'll get rid of this else statement
07:01 - so if we encounter this error again we
07:03 - will display
07:05 - could not connect
07:07 - that's a lot more obvious as to what's
07:09 - going on instead of that fatal error
07:11 - message
07:12 - if I were to start the MySQL server
07:14 - again
07:15 - then reload
07:17 - we are now connected this PHP file is
07:20 - now complete make sure to save
07:22 - everything we're going to close it I
07:24 - will head back to our index file
07:27 - let's generate some HTML after our PHP
07:30 - script
07:33 - in the body let's say hello
07:36 - doesn't really matter what you say
07:38 - let me zoom in a little bit
07:40 - since everything related to our database
07:42 - connection is handled within a separate
07:44 - PHP file we can include that within
07:47 - another file
07:49 - within a PHP script at the top of my
07:51 - index page I will use the include
07:55 - function
07:57 - we will include that file
07:59 - database.php to connect to our database
08:02 - so let's see if it works
08:06 - you are connected hello
08:09 - maybe I'll add a new line after
08:12 - could not connect I'll add a line break
08:16 - do that here as well
08:18 - much better
08:19 - technically it's not necessary to tell
08:22 - the user that they're connected to the
08:23 - database we were just more or less doing
08:25 - this for testing purposes
08:27 - one way or another though we should let
08:29 - the user know if there's any problems
08:31 - with the connection so we'll keep this
08:33 - for now
08:34 - if I were to stop the server reload
08:38 - we have that message that says could not
08:40 - connect
08:42 - all right everybody so that's how to
08:43 - connect to a MySQL server in PHP
