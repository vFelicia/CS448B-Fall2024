00:16 - your support will help keep this channel
00:18 - running hey uh let's get started with
00:20 - fonts to change the font family there is
00:24 - a font family property now with fonts
00:27 - sans serif fonts tend to look better on
00:30 - the web there is a generic sans serif
00:33 - font that you can use now what you
00:35 - commonly see with font families many
00:37 - people list more than one value for
00:39 - their font family and there's a good
00:41 - reason for this
00:42 - so i'm going to list two fonts one font
00:45 - that i'm fond of is consoles
00:48 - so in case a web browser doesn't support
00:51 - this font it will use the next best font
00:54 - available
00:55 - so people tend to list either two or
00:57 - three fonts for a font family these are
00:59 - sort of like contingencies in case the
01:02 - first one doesn't work now a good
01:03 - resource for open source fonts is
01:07 - fonts.google.com let's take a look at
01:09 - this so you can search for any fonts
01:11 - that you may want to use one font that i
01:14 - do like is press start to p
01:18 - if i would like to use this font i just
01:20 - need the style sheet so i will select
01:22 - the style otherwise you can download the
01:24 - family go to view your selected families
01:28 - and copy this link
01:32 - then within the head of my html document
01:35 - i will paste that link
01:37 - let's head back to our style sheet so i
01:39 - will change the header of my webpage so
01:42 - within my h1 header tag i will list the
01:45 - font family property and set this to the
01:49 - name of this font
01:51 - press
01:52 - start to p
01:55 - and you don't necessarily have to use
01:57 - this specific font you can really use
01:58 - whatever fonts that you like
02:00 - and if i take a look at my web page it
02:02 - now is using that font and just as a
02:04 - contingency if a web browser doesn't
02:06 - support this font i can list a backup
02:09 - let's list console us for the
02:12 - contingency
02:13 - then maybe sans-serif
02:16 - so you can list more than one font
02:17 - family just in case the first one
02:20 - doesn't work then a web browser will use
02:21 - the second one if that doesn't work then
02:23 - the third one here's a couple other
02:25 - things you can do with fonts you can set
02:27 - the font style to
02:29 - italic
02:31 - you can change the font weight
02:34 - there's bold lighter you can select a
02:37 - value let's pick bold
02:40 - you can set a text decoration this is an
02:43 - underline
02:45 - uh let's pick underline
02:47 - and there's various adjectives you can
02:49 - add to your underline like wavy
02:52 - or dotted
02:54 - you can also select a color for the text
02:57 - decoration like maybe cyan
02:59 - so you can also change the font size as
03:02 - well let's pick maybe 18 pixels for the
03:05 - font size
