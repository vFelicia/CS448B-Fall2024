00:01 - hey uh let's talk about the float
00:03 - property the float property positions an
00:05 - element to the left or right side of a
00:08 - container it's popular for wrapping
00:10 - elements around images in this brief
00:12 - example i have three images and two
00:14 - paragraph elements i think this would
00:16 - look a lot better if this text wrapped
00:19 - around these images so what i could do
00:22 - is that whatever element i would like to
00:24 - select i can apply a float property any
00:26 - elements that are floating are taken out
00:29 - of the normal flow of a document and all
00:32 - elements that follow after will wrap
00:34 - around them by setting my images to
00:37 - float left all images will gravitate
00:40 - towards the top left corner of my
00:42 - document it's as if we're reading them
00:45 - from left to right
00:46 - or we could float right then we're
00:48 - reading this right to left let me give
00:51 - you a different example images are
00:53 - inline elements here's a different
00:54 - example with block level elements this
00:57 - time we will create three boxes using a
01:00 - pair of div tags
01:02 - let's set the class equal to box we will
01:05 - have box one box two and box three
01:11 - and let's create some sample text
01:14 - create a pair of paragraph tags
01:16 - i'll type lorem and then tab to generate
01:19 - some sample text
01:20 - copy this paragraph and paste it two
01:22 - additional times let's say
01:24 - okay let's style our boxes
01:27 - so to select a class type dot then the
01:29 - name of the class
01:31 - so let's create some boxes
01:33 - the width will be 100 pixels
01:36 - the height will be 100.
01:37 - let's give this a border of one pixel
01:40 - solid
01:42 - change the font size to something
01:43 - readable like 40 pixels i'll text align
01:47 - center
01:49 - and let's change the color
01:51 - background select a color
01:53 - i'll pick tomato because i like tomatoes
01:55 - divs are block level elements after each
01:58 - element the entire width of our viewport
02:01 - is reserved to display this element so
02:04 - if i give our class box the float
02:07 - property it will be taken out of the
02:09 - normal flow of a document and all
02:11 - elements that follow after will also
02:14 - follow that pattern so they will float
02:16 - and wrap around any elements from left
02:18 - to right top to bottom if we're using
02:20 - left or this was float right it will be
02:24 - red right to left top to bottom if you
02:27 - would like a stopping point where your
02:28 - elements are no longer floating you can
02:30 - use the clear property
02:32 - so let's say with our paragraph tags i
02:35 - would like this text to stop floating
02:38 - i will use the clear property
02:40 - and set this to left if we're floating
02:42 - left
02:44 - or to the right if we're floating right
02:49 - or you can set this to both
02:51 - so yeah basically speaking with the
02:53 - float property it positions an element
02:55 - to the left or right side of a container
02:57 - and it's popular for wrapping elements
02:59 - around images if you need to stop
03:02 - floating you can use the clear property
03:04 - which is what we did here so yeah that
03:06 - is the float property if you found this
