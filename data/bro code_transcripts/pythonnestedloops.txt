00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
00:02 - hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to explain
00:04 - nested loops in python so
00:06 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:13 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:16 - help keep this channel running
00:18 - hey all you people let's talk about
00:20 - nested loops a nested loop is a general
00:23 - concept of having
00:24 - one loop inside of another loop and
00:25 - that's really it doesn't matter if it's
00:27 - a for loop or a while loop
00:29 - so the inner loop will finish all of its
00:31 - iterations before we finish
00:33 - one iteration of the outer loop and to
00:36 - best demonstrate this we're going to
00:37 - create a program
00:38 - where we will draw a rectangle made out
00:40 - of a certain symbol that we choose
00:42 - we need to set a width and a height and
00:44 - to best do this we'll need to use a
00:46 - nested loop we'll create a few prompts
00:48 - one for rows
00:49 - columns and a symbol that we want to
00:51 - make a rectangle of
00:52 - so let's begin with rows rows equals
00:56 - input how many
00:59 - rows and we'll need to cast this as an
01:03 - integer data type
01:04 - because we're working with numbers okay
01:07 - let's do the same thing for columns
01:11 - so replace rows with columns for this
01:13 - next line
01:15 - input how many columns
01:18 - and we'll create a symbol variable
01:21 - symbol
01:22 - equals input and this we don't have to
01:24 - cast
01:26 - enter a symbol to
01:29 - use now it's time for the nested loops
01:32 - we're going to create an
01:34 - outer for loop as well as an inner for
01:36 - loop the outer for loop will be in
01:38 - charge of the rows
01:39 - the inner for loop will be in charge of
01:41 - the columns so let's begin by creating
01:43 - our
01:43 - outer loop so we'll write 4 i
01:47 - in range rows
01:50 - we would like our outer for loop to
01:52 - iterate as many times as we have rows
01:55 - and we're going to create an inner for
01:56 - loop that will iterate as many times
01:58 - as we have columns so within the block
02:01 - of code for the outer for loop we're
02:02 - going to create another for loop
02:05 - this time it'll be four and a common
02:07 - convention
02:08 - for inner loops is to write j as an
02:11 - index
02:11 - because j comes after i i guess so for
02:14 - j in range
02:18 - columns so
02:22 - our inner for loop will iterate for as
02:24 - many times
02:25 - as we have columns all we'll do within
02:28 - the
02:28 - inner for loop is print our symbol that
02:30 - we have
02:31 - except we'll have one issue using a
02:34 - print statement
02:35 - after we use the print statement we will
02:37 - enter a new line character in and move
02:39 - down to the next line
02:40 - we can actually prevent that by adding
02:43 - comma
02:44 - and equals quotes so after using a print
02:48 - statement
02:48 - this will prevent our cursor from moving
02:50 - down to the next line
02:52 - so pay attention to the indentation too
02:55 - so there's kind of two levels of
02:56 - indentation
02:57 - we're currently within the inner for
02:59 - loop so that's pretty much it for the
03:01 - inner for loop now we're going to
03:03 - print a new line once we exit the inner
03:06 - for
03:06 - loop and you can see that the
03:08 - indentation is on
03:10 - this line right here we're within the
03:12 - outer for loop now
03:13 - and that's pretty much it so let's try
03:15 - this program
03:16 - how many rows let's say five rows how
03:19 - many columns perhaps six
03:22 - what symbol do we want to use let's say
03:24 - the dollar sign
03:25 - and let's try it there we go there's our
03:28 - rectangle
03:29 - so we have let's see six columns one
03:33 - two three four five six and five rows
03:36 - one
03:36 - two three four five in summary
03:39 - a nested loop is really just this
03:41 - concept of having
03:43 - one loop inside of another loop it
03:44 - doesn't matter if it's a while loop or a
03:46 - for loop it's really situational
03:48 - the inner loop will finish all of its
03:50 - iterations before finishing one
03:52 - iteration of the outer loop
03:54 - so what we did to demonstrate that is
03:56 - that we had
03:57 - the outer loop in charge the rows and an
03:59 - inner loop in charge of the columns for
04:01 - our rectangle program
04:02 - so if you would like a copy of this
04:04 - program i will post this in the comment
04:06 - section down below
04:07 - but yeah that's the basics of nested
04:10 - loops in python
04:12 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
04:14 - learned something new
04:15 - then help me help you in three easy
04:18 - steps
04:18 - by smashing that like button drop a
