00:01 - hey everybody we gotta talk about enums
00:04 - enums also means enumerations it's a
00:06 - user-defined data type that consists of
00:09 - paired named integer constants they're
00:12 - great if you have a set of potential
00:13 - options here's an example suppose we
00:16 - have a day of the week
00:17 - standard string
00:19 - today
00:20 - then pick a day
00:22 - i'll pick sunday normally you can't use
00:24 - strings within switches but we can use
00:26 - enums which are kind of similar let me
00:29 - explain so i'm going to create a switch
00:32 - we will examine today
00:34 - normally we can't do this because it's a
00:36 - string we'll examine today against many
00:38 - matching cases
00:40 - case
00:41 - sunday and i'll speed up the footage
00:51 - okay here's my switch depending on what
00:53 - day of the week it is we'll display a
00:55 - custom message it is either sunday
00:58 - through saturday one of these days so
01:00 - normally we can't use strings within
01:02 - switches this is what happens when we
01:04 - attempt that
01:06 - error switch quantity not an integer
01:08 - something similar that we can use are
01:10 - enums they're paired named integer
01:13 - constants we have a name and an
01:15 - associated value they're interchangeable
01:18 - at the top of my program i will declare
01:21 - enum then a name for the set of
01:23 - enumerations let's say day for day of
01:26 - the week
01:27 - we have
01:29 - sunday
01:30 - monday
01:32 - tuesday
01:34 - and you know the rest
01:42 - you can associate a value with each of
01:44 - these names
01:45 - sunday equals zero
01:48 - monday equals one
01:50 - then we'll just continue on with the
01:51 - rest of these
01:55 - i'm going to group these together like
01:57 - that
02:06 - okay we have our enum setup
02:08 - this identifier is kind of like the new
02:10 - data type
02:11 - we're not working with strings anymore
02:13 - we're working with days
02:15 - these are a set of potential options
02:18 - each option is a pair of a name and some
02:21 - associated value
02:22 - you can really pick any value i went
02:24 - with the numbers 0 through 6 to
02:26 - represent the day of the week i'm going
02:28 - to set today
02:30 - to
02:31 - sunday
02:32 - this name we can now use this within a
02:35 - switch there's an associated integer
02:37 - value
02:38 - but we'll change the cases from strings
02:40 - to that enum data type
02:47 - and this would
02:48 - work it is sunday
02:51 - within the cases you could use the
02:53 - associated values as well
02:55 - i'm going to change today to be friday
02:59 - case 0 is sunday monday is 1
03:02 - 2
03:03 - three four five six
03:07 - it is friday
03:09 - so that also works but i don't think
03:11 - it's as readable
03:13 - another cool thing with enums is that
03:14 - enum variables take only one value of
03:17 - the set
03:18 - if i try and make up some value like
03:21 - pizza day well we can't do that
03:25 - pizza day was not declared in the scope
03:28 - here's a few other enum examples you
03:30 - could create a set of enums for flavors
03:32 - vanilla chocolate strawberry mint an
03:35 - important note is that if you're working
03:37 - with enums and you don't assign an
03:38 - integer value to each of these names
03:41 - you'll implicitly assign 0 to the first
03:43 - name then 1 two three kind of like what
03:46 - i did up here but we explicitly assigned
03:48 - to those values we have six colors
03:53 - or maybe planets i have a set of enums
03:55 - of the nine planets in our solar system
03:57 - the associated integer is the size of
04:00 - each planet in kilometers
04:02 - so yeah those are enums they're a
04:04 - user-defined data type that consists of
04:06 - paired named integer constants
04:09 - they're great if you have a set of
04:11 - potential options
04:12 - your assignment is to post a set of
04:14 - enums in the comments section down below
04:17 - and well yeah those are enums in c plus
