00:00 - hey how's it going everybody it's you
bro here and in this video I'm going to
00:04 - teach you guys how we can include links
and images on our web pages using HTML
00:08 - let's get into it
so before we begin this lesson you'll
00:14 - want to be sure to download a couple
images I would say for for good measure
00:19 - and place them within the same folder
that has your HTML file that you're
00:24 - going to be working with so feel free to
pause the video now and to go and
00:28 - download a few images to include links
and images on our webpages we first need
00:33 - to discuss attributes all elements in
HTML have attributes attributes provide
00:39 - additional information about an element
that contains an attribute they are used
00:43 - in the opening tags of an element and
come in name value pairs so attributes
00:48 - are useful because we can provide links
to webpages we can include images and
00:53 - even specify the styling of an element
but we'll save that part for CSS so
00:58 - let's begin by creating an HTML link so
HTML links are defined with the ate tag
01:04 - and then you also need a closing tag for
this as well the next step is that we'll
01:09 - need some text to function as the link
so for example let's say that we want to
01:14 - create a link that will take us to
Google's homepage well let's write some
01:19 - text that will actually take us there if
we click on it so we can say something
01:24 - such as if you would click on this you
will go to Google's homepage let's save
01:36 - this and refresh the page all right so
currently this doesn't do anything if
01:41 - you click on it so we need to give an
attribute to the a tag that surrounds
01:47 - what's going to be our link what the
a-tech does is that any text surrounded
01:52 - with a pair of a tags will function as a
hyperlink that can link this text to
01:57 - another webpage that you specify but we
need to specify what webpage we want to
02:02 - link this to and we can do that with the
href attribute so within the a opening
02:08 - tag or we're going to do is type in H
ref and that's an acronym for hypertext
02:13 - reference and we set this equal to
whatever website we want to link this
02:18 - hyperlink to and make sure to put this
within double quotes and within the
02:22 - double quotes type in the address of the
webpage that you
02:25 - want this hyperlink to take you to so it
usually begins with HTTP or HTTPS make
02:32 - sure you get it right then colon two
forward slashes wwa and then whatever
02:38 - the URL is for the web page they want to
link this to so if you want to link this
02:43 - to Google's home page we're going to
type google.com let's save this no I
02:50 - don't want to purchase sublime text
refresh the page and then you can see
02:54 - that our hyperlink is now blue and
underlined and if we click on this it
02:58 - will now bring us to Google when we
click on it let's say that you want to
03:02 - change this hyperlink so that it opens a
new window for you or a new tab instead
03:07 - of just going to the web page directly
on the tab that you're currently on well
03:12 - there's an attribute for that and it's
the target attribute so within the a tag
03:17 - the opening a tag we're going to type
target equals underscore blank let's
03:25 - save it refresh the page then we'll
click on this and this will open in a
03:30 - new tab then or a new window it really
depends on the web browser that you're
03:34 - using
all right so up next I'm going to teach
03:37 - you guys how we can create a download
link so it's going to be the same
03:41 - process as before but there's one more
thing we need to add so let me add a few
03:46 - line breaks just to give us some room
all right so we'll need some sort of
03:50 - text to act as the link so I will say
download a meme let's download a meme
03:59 - and then we need to surround this with a
tags so we need an opening tag and a
04:04 - closing tag and then within the opening
tag we're going to say H ref equals then
04:10 - double quotes okay so you can either put
the address of whatever you want to
04:16 - download within double quotes if it's a
file on your computer you can put the
04:20 - file path here or if it's a like file or
a picture within the same folder of the
04:26 - HTML file you can just put the file name
here well I have a picture that's within
04:31 - the same folder as my HTML file so I'll
just put the name of the file here so
04:37 - feel free to pause the video
want to download your own picture so the
04:41 - file that I have named was meme dot jpg
so make sure that's within the a tag
04:48 - href equals whatever the name or the
location of your file is within
04:52 - double-quotes
and the next important step is to write
04:55 - the word download right after all right
so let's save this refresh the page so
05:01 - it says download a meme then if we click
on this it's going to download the
05:07 - picture that I had so this word download
within the a tag is another attribute so
05:12 - this is the name and you can give the
value and make sure to write this within
05:16 - double quotes as well so this is the
name of the file when it's downloaded
05:21 - and you can name this whatever you want
so when somebody downloads your file
05:25 - it's going to have this file name
whatever is within double quotes all
05:30 - right so that's enough for links in HTML
let's move on to including images so I'm
05:36 - going to add a few line breaks just to
give us some room alright so there's a
05:40 - tag that we need to use to add a picture
to our web page it is the IMG tag and
05:47 - this is a self closing tag so you don't
need to add a closing tag to this so
05:53 - within the IMG tag you're going to type
in SRC which is a short for source then
05:59 - equals then within double quotes
wherever this file is located this can
06:05 - be a web address this could be a file
path on your computer or if it's simply
06:09 - within the same folder of your HTML file
you can just write the name of the file
06:14 - here so since the picture that I want to
include is within the same folder as
06:20 - this HTML file I'm just going to put the
file name here so I think this was named
06:25 - meme to jpg let's save this refresh the
page alright here's the picture but it's
06:33 - fairly massive so there's actually a
height and width attribute that we can
06:38 - include within the IMG tag to adjust the
height and the width so we'll adjust the
06:44 - height first
so we could say height equals how about
06:47 - 250 and width equals 250 and these are
within pixels so
06:52 - let's save this refresh the page and you
can see that it's a lot smaller that now
06:57 - fits on the page so one thing you've
might have noticed with this image is
07:01 - that it's fairly stretched and there's
one way we can actually avoid that with
07:05 - the height and the width attributes
instead of placing pixels as the values
07:09 - we can actually place a percentage here
for example we could say height equals
07:14 - 50% or some other number and we'll do
the same thing with width so let's save
07:20 - this and refresh the page and our image
is no longer stretched so there's one
07:25 - other attribute that we can add to our
image tag it is the alt attribute it's
07:29 - short for alternate for some reason if
we can't display this image we can
07:34 - display some alternate text for example
if we can't display this image the text
07:38 - this is a meme what appear or whatever
text we place within here so for example
07:46 - let's say I get this file extension
wrong and we'll save like XYZ which
07:50 - doesn't exist here so we'll save this
refresh the page and it says with this
07:56 - alternate text this is a meme but if we
go back and save this this is a meme
08:02 - doesn't display or whatever else we put
for our alternate text so this is useful
08:07 - if for some reason somebody can't
display an image there'll be some
08:11 - alternate text that lets the user know
what normally should be here so just an
08:16 - important note with this height and
width attribute for our image it will
08:20 - actually resize depending on the size of
the window it's currently in so that's
08:26 - one advantage to using percentages for
the height and width attributes alright
08:31 - guys so up next I'm going to show you
guys how we can include an image that's
08:35 - somewhere else on your computer and not
necessarily within the same folder as
08:39 - your HTML file so what I'll do is
actually copy this and paste it right
08:45 - underneath and this is meme 3 and it's
located on my desktop so we're going to
08:52 - put meme 3 here and what I'll need to do
is find the file path for this like just
08:58 - right-click this go to properties and
copy this location this file path
09:04 - alright then
we'll put that within the source so this
09:09 - is the file path for this then I just
need to add a backslash save this and
09:14 - then let's refresh the page there
there's the image that I was looking for
09:18 - let's include another image but this
time it's going to be a website URL so
09:24 - we're going to make a image tag and the
source is going to be this or find a
09:33 - picture online that you want to place
here you don't necessarily need to copy
09:36 - this and then I'll set the height to
perhaps 50% as well to match the others
09:42 - same with the width and I'll set an alt
you don't necessarily need to this is
09:50 - another meme alright let's save this
let's refresh the page and here is our
09:57 - last image all right so to finish up
this video I'll show you guys a cool
10:02 - trick of how we can have an image also
function as a hyperlink when we click on
10:06 - it so it's going to combine both things
that we learned about in this video
10:10 - so the first thing that we'll need to do
is to include an image so we'll use the
10:14 - image tag and we need to set a source
equals then within double quotes
10:19 - wherever this file or image is located
so for me this last image that I want to
10:24 - use is within the same folder as my HTML
file and it simply named meme for dot
10:30 - jpg and I will also set a height and
width attribute so we'll set this to 50%
10:39 - just to match the others and we don't
need to add an alt but we can and this
10:45 - is actually a picture of Gandalf from
Lord of the Rings but I misspelled it
10:51 - alright we're good alright so let's save
this refresh the page and here's our
10:57 - last image all right now if we want to
make this a hyperlink we have to
11:02 - surround this with an a take a pair of
eight tags like we did for our links at
11:07 - the top of the page so we're going to
put this around our image so we'll put
11:13 - the opening tag before the image and the
closing tag after the image and we need
11:18 - to use the H
F attribute within the opening a tag and
11:22 - we will set a destination for our
hyperlink to bring us to and you can set
11:28 - this for it wherever you want but I
think I want this to bring us to the
11:32 - Wikipedia page for the Lord of the Rings
so let's save this refresh the page and
11:38 - if I were to click on this image you can
see that the cursor is now a pointer
11:43 - finger when we hover over the image and
if we click on this it will bring us to
11:48 - the Wikipedia page for the Lord of the
Rings and remember if you want this
11:52 - hyperlink to open in a new window or tab
within the a tag you just use the target
11:57 - attribute set it equal to underscore
blank and this will open in a new tab or
12:04 - window
well that will conclude the end of this
12:06 - lesson hopefully you found this video
useful and that will conclude this topic
