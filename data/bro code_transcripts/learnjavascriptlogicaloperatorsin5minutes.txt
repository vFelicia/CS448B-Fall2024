00:00 - hey y'all it's Ami so today I'm going to
00:03 - explain logical operators there's three
00:05 - of them and or not they're used to
00:09 - combine or manipulate Boolean values
00:11 - Boolean values if you remember are true
00:14 - or false
00:15 - let's create a program const temp
00:18 - meaning temperature
00:20 - what I would like to do is see if my
00:22 - temperature Falls within a certain range
00:24 - this will be in Celsius let's say the
00:26 - temperature is 28 degrees Celsius
00:30 - without using any logical operators
00:32 - let's write this
00:34 - if
00:36 - our temp
00:37 - is greater than zero
00:40 - then we will console DOT log
00:44 - the weather is good
00:49 - else if
00:52 - the temperature
00:54 - is less than or equal to 30 30 degrees
00:58 - Celsius we will also output the weather
01:01 - is good
01:05 - else
01:08 - the weather is bad currently my
01:11 - temperature is 20 degrees Celsius
01:14 - the weather is good what if I were to
01:16 - change this to something ridiculous like
01:18 - 200 degrees Celsius well the weather is
01:22 - obviously not good Earth probably got
01:24 - hit by an asteroid or something
01:26 - or if I were to change my temperature to
01:28 - like negative 100 degrees Celsius while
01:32 - the weather isn't good either
01:34 - I don't know maybe the sun disappeared
01:35 - so what I want to do is output the
01:38 - weather is good only if my temperature
01:40 - Falls between the range of 0 and 30. so
01:46 - we're going to change this program if
01:47 - our temperature is greater than zero
01:51 - and we'll check another condition
01:54 - and our temperature is greater than or
01:57 - equal to 30 then we can eliminate this
01:59 - else if clause
02:01 - now let's check the temperature
02:03 - our temperature is negative 100 degrees
02:05 - Celsius well the weather is bad if our
02:09 - temperature was 200 degrees Celsius the
02:11 - weather is also bad
02:13 - in order for us to execute this if
02:15 - statement
02:16 - both these conditions need to be true
02:18 - this one and this one to join two
02:22 - conditions you use double Ampersand
02:24 - meaning and
02:26 - if our temperature was 25
02:29 - well that falls within our range the
02:31 - weather is good
02:33 - this is true and this is true so we will
02:36 - execute this code if one of these was
02:39 - false
02:40 - we don't execute it at all
02:42 - we'll skip over it
02:43 - so that is the andological operator
02:46 - you can check more than one condition
02:49 - you can check one thing and something
02:51 - else
02:53 - now there's or which is double straight
02:56 - bars
02:57 - with the orological operator at least
03:00 - one of these conditions needs to be true
03:02 - this has to be true or that has to be
03:05 - true if I were to run the same program
03:08 - well then the weather is good let's
03:10 - change the temperature to 250
03:12 - the weather is good but it's not it
03:15 - shouldn't be
03:16 - so let's rewrite this program
03:18 - if our temp
03:19 - is less than or equal to zero
03:24 - or the temperature
03:26 - is greater than 30 then the weather is
03:29 - bad
03:30 - else the weather is good our temperature
03:33 - is 250 the weather is bad
03:37 - negative 250 the weather is also bad so
03:41 - with the or logical operator we're
03:43 - checking more than one condition
03:45 - is this true yes it is negative 250 is
03:49 - less than zero
03:50 - or is this condition true this one is
03:53 - false
03:54 - but since at least one of these is true
03:56 - we will execute this code
03:58 - then we will cover the notchological
04:00 - operator let's create a new program
04:04 - const is sunny is it sunny outside this
04:08 - will be true or false
04:11 - we will create an if statement
04:14 - our condition will be is sunny isn't
04:17 - this true if it is we will console
04:20 - .log
04:23 - it is sunny
04:27 - else we will cancel that log
04:31 - it is
04:33 - cloudy
04:35 - is sunny is set to true it is sunny If
04:39 - This Were false
04:40 - then it is cloudy using the not logical
04:43 - operator we can flip a Boolean from True
04:46 - to false or false to true
04:49 - I will precede this Boolean with the not
04:52 - logical operator which is an exclamation
04:54 - point now we're checking if it's not
04:57 - sunny
04:58 - then we will console.log it is cloudy
05:03 - else it is sunny
05:05 - is it not sunny outside
05:08 - it is cloudy
05:09 - let's change this to be true it is sunny
05:13 - so basically the not logical operator
05:15 - it'll change true to be false and false
05:18 - to be true alright everybody so that's a
05:20 - short topic today logical operators
05:22 - they're used to combine or manipulate
05:24 - Boolean values use and to check to see
05:27 - if at least two conditions are true with
05:30 - or at least one condition needs to be
05:32 - true and with not not we'll do the
05:34 - opposite and well that is an
05:36 - introduction to logical operators in
05:38 - JavaScript
