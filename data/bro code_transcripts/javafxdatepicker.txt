00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:02 - bro hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to explain
00:05 - the date picker node in
00:06 - javafx so sit back relax and enjoy the
00:10 - show
00:12 - okay people in this video we'll use the
00:15 - date picker node to select a date
00:17 - using an interactive calendar that will
00:19 - appear once you press this button
00:21 - alternatively you can enter a date into
00:23 - this white bar here as well
00:24 - once we have our date we will change the
00:26 - text of a label to reflect that date
00:29 - so once you have your date picker node
00:30 - that is found underneath controls
00:32 - let's add some prompt text enter a
00:35 - date and your text will appear as a
00:37 - prompt within this white search bar here
00:40 - and let's give this date picker a unique
00:42 - id my
00:44 - date picker and on action let's say
00:48 - get date but we'll need to define this
00:50 - method later
00:51 - okay we need a label that's found
00:53 - underneath controls
00:55 - let's drag and drop it and i'm going to
00:57 - expand this
00:58 - although it's not necessary and i will
01:01 - change the font
01:03 - that's decent and center it i will give
01:07 - this label a unique id my
01:10 - label so add your controller class then
01:12 - we should be good
01:13 - let's head to our controller class now
01:15 - now open up your controller class we're
01:17 - going to inject our fxml
01:19 - at fxml private
01:22 - date picker my date
01:26 - picker and at fxml
01:31 - private label my label
01:35 - we need to define that getdate method
01:38 - public void get
01:42 - date action event
01:47 - event okay now we need to
01:50 - get the value of our date picker
01:54 - this will be a local date object local
01:57 - date
01:59 - my date equals my
02:03 - date picker dot get
02:06 - value
02:10 - so let's test this let's just print the
02:12 - date to
02:13 - our console window let's use
02:15 - system.out.printline
02:17 - my date but we'll need to use the to
02:20 - string method
02:22 - okay let's test this we should be able
02:24 - to select a date using this interactive
02:26 - calendar
02:28 - let's say whatever this date is okay so
02:31 - march 1st of 2021 so now let's change
02:35 - the text of our label instead
02:36 - so let's get rid of this line my
02:40 - label dot set text
02:45 - my date to string
02:52 - let's try it again
02:56 - okay march 1st 2021
02:59 - nice now you can change the format of
03:02 - this date if you don't want the year
03:03 - first here's how to do so
03:06 - let's say we have string my
03:10 - formatted date equals
03:15 - date actually that's my date
03:18 - dot format
03:22 - date time formatter
03:26 - dot of pattern
03:30 - and we need a pattern if i would like
03:34 - the month first that would be two
03:36 - capital ms make sure you don't use
03:38 - lowercase because that's for minutes
03:41 - m m d d dash
03:44 - y yyyy and we will display
03:48 - my formatted date
03:54 - and let's run it
03:58 - okay march 1st 2021
04:01 - now if you need the name of the month
04:04 - you use
04:05 - three capital m's
04:12 - okay march 1st 2021 well everybody that
04:15 - is the
04:16 - date picker node it allows us to use an
04:18 - interactive calendar to select a
04:20 - date if you would like a copy of this
04:22 - code i will post this to the comments
