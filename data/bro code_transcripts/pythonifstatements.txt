00:00 - hey what's going on people it's you bro
00:01 - hope you're doing well and in this video
00:03 - i'm going to explain
00:04 - if statements else if statements and
00:06 - else statements in python so
00:08 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:13 - if you find this video helpful please
00:15 - remember to like
00:16 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:19 - help keep this channel running
00:20 - all right people let's talk about if
00:22 - statements an if statement is a block of
00:25 - code
00:25 - that will execute only if its condition
00:28 - is true
00:29 - it's a very basic form of decision
00:31 - making with programming
00:32 - for this example let's create a prompt
00:35 - where we will ask a user for their age
00:38 - and depending on what their age is we
00:39 - will print a response
00:41 - so let's say age equals input and then
00:44 - we will add a prompt how old
00:45 - are you now this will return a string so
00:48 - we should probably cast this as an
00:50 - integer
00:51 - data type so we now have a variable
00:53 - called age where we will accept some
00:55 - user input
00:56 - let's check somebody's age with a
00:58 - variety of if statements
01:00 - so let's check to see if somebody's age
01:02 - is greater than or equal to 18
01:04 - so to create an if statement type if and
01:06 - then some sort of condition
01:07 - if age is greater than or equal to 18
01:10 - to finish this if statement add a colon
01:13 - at the end
01:14 - now pay attention to this if i move down
01:15 - to the next line you'll notice that my
01:18 - cursor is now
01:18 - indented any indented code underneath an
01:22 - if statement is the block of code for
01:24 - that if statement
01:26 - so if this condition is true we will
01:28 - execute some
01:29 - block of code if it's false we'll skip
01:31 - over it so if somebody's age is greater
01:33 - than or equal to 18
01:35 - let's print you are an
01:38 - adult and let's try this program how old
01:42 - are you
01:42 - let's say i'm 21. so my condition when
01:45 - we get to the if statement
01:46 - is going to check to see if this
01:48 - condition is true if it is true we're
01:50 - going to execute
01:51 - this block of code if it's not we skip
01:53 - over it so how old are you
01:55 - let's say i'm 21 i'm going to hit enter
01:57 - and my if statement
01:58 - is true so we execute this block of code
02:01 - which prints
02:02 - you are an adult so what if this
02:04 - condition is false
02:05 - let's say i'm 12 well then we're just
02:07 - going to skip over this block of code
02:09 - and continue on with the rest of the
02:10 - program
02:11 - if you would like your program to take
02:13 - some other course of action
02:14 - if this condition is false we can add an
02:17 - else statement
02:18 - so after the if statement add else make
02:21 - sure you get
02:22 - the indentation right you don't want
02:23 - this within the block of code for the if
02:25 - statement
02:26 - so if this condition is false we can
02:29 - take some
02:30 - other course of action so if somebody's
02:32 - age is
02:33 - less than 18 let's print
02:37 - you are a child
02:40 - so let's try this again i'm going to
02:42 - enter that i
02:44 - am 12 years old not really but let's
02:46 - just pretend i am
02:47 - so this will now print you are a child
02:50 - if
02:50 - this condition is false perform this
02:52 - block of code for the else statement
02:55 - so with if statements we can check more
02:57 - than one condition before reaching the
02:59 - else statement by using an
03:01 - else if statement and we add that after
03:04 - an if statement so it's shortened to e l
03:07 - i f for else if so let's check to see if
03:10 - somebody's age
03:12 - is less than zero for some reason
03:15 - so let's print you
03:19 - haven't been born yet
03:23 - so with if statements we start at the
03:25 - top we first check the if statement
03:28 - if this is false we move down to the
03:29 - next statement to check
03:31 - then we check our else if statement if
03:34 - this is also false
03:35 - then we resort to the else statement the
03:37 - else statement
03:38 - is sort of like a last resort if all
03:41 - conditions
03:42 - evaluate to be false then we execute the
03:44 - else statement
03:45 - so let's try this how old are you let's
03:48 - say i'm negative 1 years old
03:51 - you haven't been born yet so with if
03:53 - statements we always begin
03:55 - with an if statement and we check that
03:57 - condition if that condition
03:59 - evaluates to be false then we will skip
04:01 - this block of code
04:02 - and move down to the else if statement
04:05 - if there is one
04:06 - it's optional if this condition is also
04:09 - false
04:10 - then we will use our else statement as a
04:12 - last resort
04:13 - if there is one if there is no else
04:15 - statement then we just skip over all of
04:17 - this then and continue on with the rest
04:18 - of the program
04:19 - so you can add more than one else if
04:22 - statement
04:22 - so let's check something else let's
04:25 - check to see
04:26 - else if age is equal to
04:29 - 100 so if you need to check to see if a
04:33 - value
04:33 - is equal to a particular value make sure
04:36 - you use
04:37 - double equal signs this is the
04:39 - comparison operator
04:41 - for equality if you use just one equal
04:44 - sign
04:44 - that's the assignment operator and
04:46 - python thinks you're attempting to set
04:48 - age equal to 100 so if you want to check
04:51 - to see if
04:52 - age is equal to 100 then use double
04:54 - equals so let's check to see if
04:57 - somebody's age
04:58 - is equal to 100 so let's print
05:02 - you are a century
05:06 - old now pay attention to this if i were
05:09 - to run this program
05:10 - how old are you let's say i'm 100. so
05:14 - this is printing you are an adult that's
05:16 - because we first check
05:18 - our if statement and well we're 100
05:20 - years old and 100
05:22 - is greater than or equal to 18. so we
05:24 - print
05:25 - this block of code we execute this block
05:27 - of code and then we skip
05:28 - everything else even though age is equal
05:32 - to 100 within
05:33 - our else if statement so the order of
05:36 - your if statements
05:37 - does matter so let's change this around
05:40 - let's add this
05:41 - to the very beginning and this will be
05:44 - our if statement and we will set age
05:48 - is greater than or equal to 18 to be an
05:50 - else if statement
05:51 - so we're first going to check to see if
05:53 - age is equal to 100
05:55 - if not we will check to see if age is
05:57 - greater than or equal to 18.
05:59 - and we just follow that order so let's
06:01 - try this again how old are you
06:03 - i am 100 years old you are
06:06 - a century old so we first check our if
06:09 - statement
06:10 - if this condition is true we will
06:11 - execute this block of code
06:13 - if it's false we just go down the order
06:15 - till we reach our else statement
06:18 - well everybody that is the basics of if
06:20 - statements we have if statements
06:22 - else if statements and else statements
06:25 - so if you would like a copy of this code
06:27 - i will post this in the comments down
06:29 - below but yeah that is how
06:31 - if statements work in python
06:34 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
06:36 - learned something new
06:37 - then help me help you in three easy
06:40 - steps
06:40 - by smashing that like button drop a
