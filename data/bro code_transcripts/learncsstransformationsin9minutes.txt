00:00 - hey what's going on everybody today
00:01 - we're going to cover the transform
00:03 - property in CSS the transform property
00:06 - lets you rotate scale skew or otherwise
00:09 - translate an element here's what we're
00:12 - gonna do we'll create a div section
00:15 - I will give this div an ID of box one
00:19 - then within the Box let's say the word
00:22 - hi
00:23 - let's head to our style sheet within my
00:26 - style sheet I will take our ID of box
00:29 - one
00:30 - set the width and height to be 250
00:33 - pixels
00:38 - then I will give this div section a
00:42 - border of 5 pixel solid
00:45 - let's increase the font size
00:48 - 13 em is fine
00:51 - then text align Center
00:56 - hey let's change the background color to
00:58 - while we're at it
01:00 - I'll pick a greenish color
01:05 - and that's pretty good I'm also going to
01:08 - remove some of the margin around the
01:10 - body of our document
01:12 - body margin zero
01:16 - all right so the transform property
01:19 - the First Transformation I'll show you
01:21 - is translate we can translate X on the
01:25 - x-axis Translate Y on the y-axis or both
01:29 - with just translate let's begin with
01:31 - translate X so after translate X add a
01:35 - set of parentheses whatever value you
01:37 - place within the set of parentheses we
01:39 - will translate this element on the
01:41 - x-axis if I were to set translate X to
01:44 - be 50 pixels this element will move to
01:47 - the right by 50 pixels
01:49 - that's 100
01:51 - 200
01:54 - negative numbers will move the element
01:55 - to the left
01:58 - percentages are fine too if I set
02:01 - translate X to be one hundred percent
02:03 - this element will translate to the right
02:06 - by 100 percent the width of this element
02:09 - with a negative percentage that will
02:11 - translate the element to the left
02:13 - it could effectively hide that element
02:15 - then with negative fifty percent we
02:18 - should see just half of this element A
02:20 - lot of these Transformations can be done
02:22 - in pixels
02:24 - or percentages
02:26 - there's also Translate Y for the y-axis
02:29 - if I were to translate by 50 pixels on
02:33 - the y-axis that moves the element down
02:36 - negative 50 would move the element up
02:39 - by one hundred percent we will move this
02:42 - element down by one hundred percent the
02:44 - height of the element that negative 100
02:47 - will effectively hide the element you
02:50 - can combine both of them too with just
02:51 - translate but you need two values the
02:55 - translation on the x-axis then the
02:57 - y-axis
02:58 - if I set the first number to be 50
03:01 - well 50 pixels
03:03 - that's an X translation the second value
03:06 - is a y translation now we're moving the
03:10 - element to the right and down negative
03:13 - values will move the element to the left
03:15 - and then up
03:17 - those are translations for the transform
03:19 - property
03:20 - then we have rotations we can rotate on
03:23 - the x-axis
03:25 - within rotate X we set a number of
03:28 - degrees if I were to set rotate X to be
03:31 - 45 degrees we'd begin rotating on the
03:34 - x-axis that's 45
03:37 - this is 90. you can't even see it
03:41 - 135
03:45 - with 180 it should be kind of upside
03:47 - down
03:48 - that is an X rotation then we have y
03:52 - rotate y we'll start with 45 degrees
03:56 - that's 45.
04:00 - 90 you can't even see it anymore
04:03 - 135
04:06 - 180.
04:08 - and lastly we have Z rotation
04:12 - that's 45
04:14 - this is 90.
04:17 - 135
04:20 - 180. those are different rotations
04:24 - their scale
04:26 - we can scale X or scale y
04:29 - 1 corresponds to 100 percent
04:32 - 1.1 is 110 percent
04:36 - if I were to set scale X to be 2 we're
04:39 - scaling this element on the x-axis by
04:42 - 200 percent
04:43 - 3 would be 300 percent
04:46 - any value below one
04:48 - would in a way compress it on the x-axis
04:52 - and here is 0.25
04:55 - we also have scale y
04:58 - scale Y is set to 2. would scale this
05:01 - element on the y-axis by 200 percent
05:05 - that's 300.
05:07 - here 0.5
05:09 - and here's 0.25
05:12 - you can combine both X and Y2 with just
05:15 - scale but you need two values
05:18 - so by default it's 1 1 for 100 let's
05:22 - scale on the x-axis and the y-axis by
05:25 - 200 percent
05:27 - and here's 300.
05:29 - that is scale
05:31 - then we have skew skew X or skew y
05:35 - if I were to set skew X to be 45 degrees
05:39 - we are skewing this element on the
05:41 - x-axis
05:43 - here's 90.
05:45 - 135
05:48 - and 180. the same applies for y
05:53 - Year's 45
05:56 - 90
05:58 - 135
06:00 - 180 you could combine them both with
06:03 - just SKU
06:04 - then again you need two values following
06:06 - that same pattern
06:08 - you can apply more than one
06:09 - transformation at a time let's begin
06:12 - with translate X
06:14 - by 100 percent
06:17 - and then we will rotate on the z-axis by
06:21 - 90 degrees
06:24 - let's add a scale as well
06:27 - I'll shrink this image by 50 percent
06:32 - so yes you can apply more than one
06:33 - transformation at a time
06:35 - these Transformations can also be
06:37 - applied to a class
06:39 - let's create two additional boxes
06:42 - box one box two box three
06:45 - I'll give each of these elements a class
06:49 - of box
06:54 - I'll remove this transformation
06:57 - I will select the Box class
07:00 - take all of these properties cut them
07:03 - besides the background color then paste
07:05 - them within the Box class
07:07 - then let's color in our two other boxes
07:10 - box one box two box three I'll make box
07:13 - two red
07:17 - box 3 will be blue
07:21 - all right let's apply some
07:22 - transformations to the class now I will
07:25 - set the transform property let's
07:27 - translate on the x-axis translate X
07:31 - by 100 pixels
07:35 - then let's rotate on the z-axis by 45
07:39 - degrees
07:41 - then I will shrink these with scale
07:45 - set to 0.5
07:48 - you also could apply these
07:49 - transformations to images I just so
07:52 - happen to have a picture of Shrek in my
07:54 - computer I think everybody should have
07:55 - at least one right that image just saved
07:57 - within my website folder
08:00 - let's delete these boxes that include
08:02 - that image
08:04 - image source equals the relative file
08:07 - path of the image
08:12 - all right
08:15 - let's take our image I will apply the
08:18 - transform property
08:20 - let's Translate
08:23 - our image on the x-axis by 100 percent
08:28 - then let's rotate Shrek on the z-axis
08:32 - by 180 degrees
08:34 - let's scale Shrek in the x-axis by 200
08:37 - percent
08:39 - scale X
08:41 - two
08:43 - all right I don't know what the point of
08:44 - that was but I thought it would be a fun
08:46 - exercise all right everybody so those
08:48 - are transformations it's a CSS property
08:50 - that lets you rotate scale skew or
08:53 - otherwise translate an element and those
08:55 - are a few basic CSS transformations
