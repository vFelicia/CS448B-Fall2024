00:00 - hey uh so today I'm gonna explain the
00:02 - checked property in JavaScript the
00:05 - checked property determines the checked
00:07 - state of an HTML checkbox or a radio
00:10 - button element by examining this
00:12 - property we can determine if a check box
00:14 - is checked or a radio button is selected
00:17 - in this program if I were to not select
00:19 - any of these buttons we have a different
00:21 - result
00:22 - within our HTML file we will create an
00:26 - input element
00:27 - the type
00:28 - is going to equal checkbox
00:32 - then for the ID I will set this equal to
00:36 - my check box
00:39 - and here's our checkbox
00:41 - we should probably add a label so that
00:43 - people know what this is for
00:47 - so the label
00:49 - I will set the for attribute to B my
00:53 - checkbox
00:55 - what's the label going to say
00:58 - let's say subscribe like a subscribe
01:00 - button utilizing the for attribute if
01:03 - the four attribute is the same as the ID
01:06 - when we click on the label it should
01:08 - still select the checkbox
01:11 - all right let's add a break then we will
01:14 - create some radio buttons
01:16 - we will again need an input element
01:19 - the type this time will not be a check
01:22 - box it will be radio
01:25 - for the ID
01:26 - this will be a v sub button
01:30 - I'm going to abbreviate button to BTN so
01:33 - pay attention to that
01:36 - then I will create a label for this
01:38 - radio button
01:40 - we will set the for attribute to be the
01:43 - same as the ID
01:46 - then the text will be Visa
01:50 - I'm going to add a break
01:54 - okay let's copy this radio button paste
01:56 - it two times
01:58 - we'll change the second visa to be
02:00 - MasterCard
02:03 - let's change the ID first
02:05 - Master Card
02:08 - let's copy the ID paste it within the
02:11 - four attribute of the second label
02:14 - then change the text Master Card
02:19 - then the third ID will be
02:22 - PayPal button
02:25 - then change the for attribute
02:27 - and the text
02:29 - PayPal so with radio buttons they should
02:32 - all be within the same group currently
02:34 - they're not so I can select all of them
02:36 - if I would like we should only be able
02:39 - to select one for many group we will
02:41 - group these radio buttons by their name
02:43 - attribute they should all have the same
02:45 - name
02:46 - the name let's say is card
02:49 - so let's copy this attribute and paste
02:51 - it within the other input elements
02:54 - now we should only be able to select one
02:56 - and that appears to work
02:58 - lastly let's create a submit button
03:02 - we are creating a button
03:03 - the text will be submit
03:07 - the type is submit
03:10 - and for the ID
03:12 - will be my submit
03:15 - I will create a paragraph element
03:18 - we'll populate it with some text
03:19 - depending if subscribe is checked or not
03:22 - same thing goes with our radio buttons
03:25 - I will create two paragraphs after our
03:28 - button
03:29 - the ID on the first paragraph
03:32 - let's name sub result
03:35 - there will be no text content to begin
03:37 - with we'll change the text content of
03:40 - our subresult paragraph with some text
03:43 - that states if the user is subscribed or
03:45 - not we'll create another paragraph for
03:47 - the radio buttons again there's going to
03:49 - be no text content
03:51 - I'll set the idea this paragraph to be
03:54 - payment result
03:55 - now before we move to our JavaScript
03:57 - file I'm just going to edit the CSS on
04:00 - the button to make it a little bit
04:01 - bigger so you guys can read it
04:03 - so the ID of that button was my submit
04:07 - we are selecting an ID my submit I will
04:11 - set the font size to be one em
04:15 - and that's probably good enough
04:18 - uh maybe I'll add one more break after
04:20 - the Subscribe button and the PayPal
04:23 - radio button
04:25 - just so that it's not as cramped
04:30 - that's decent enough
04:32 - okay so be sure to save your CSS file
04:34 - your HTML file
04:37 - then we are now within our JavaScript
04:39 - file what we're going to do now is get
04:41 - these elements by their ID and store
04:43 - them within constants so they're easier
04:45 - to work with okay let's start with our
04:47 - check box so the checkbox had an ID of
04:50 - my checkbox
04:52 - const my checkbox be sure to pay
04:56 - attention to the capitalization
04:58 - feel free to change that if you would
05:00 - like just be sure it's consistent with
05:02 - what you have currently with your HTML
05:03 - elements
05:04 - we are accessing the document of our web
05:07 - page get element by ID
05:11 - the ID is going to be my checkbox
05:16 - and that's it so let's get the other
05:18 - elements
05:19 - we have my check box
05:21 - then we have our Visa button
05:25 - const Visa button get Elements by ID
05:28 - Visa button
05:31 - then let's repeat this with our
05:33 - MasterCard button again pay attention to
05:35 - the capitalization it's pretty important
05:40 - then we have our PayPal button
05:45 - we need our submit button next
05:49 - my submit
05:53 - then our paragraph elements
05:55 - sub result
06:02 - then payment result
06:06 - all right here are all the constants
06:08 - that we'll need
06:09 - so when we click on the submit button we
06:12 - will execute a function
06:14 - so we are taking my submit that's the
06:16 - name of the button
06:17 - dot on click
06:20 - I keep on spelling on lick on click
06:23 - equals
06:25 - a function parentheses curly braces when
06:28 - we click on the button what are we going
06:30 - to do
06:31 - we recently learned about if statements
06:33 - we will first check the checked property
06:35 - of the Subscribe button we'll place it
06:37 - within an if statement
06:40 - so to create a if statement it's if
06:42 - parentheses curly braces
06:44 - we are examining my checkbox that's the
06:47 - Subscribe button
06:48 - Dot
06:50 - checked property this will evaluate to
06:53 - be true or false
06:55 - if this is true we will execute this
06:57 - code
06:58 - if not we do something else if somebody
07:00 - is subscribed let's change the text
07:03 - content of our sub result paragraph
07:06 - so sub result
07:08 - we are accessing the text
07:10 - content
07:12 - to equal
07:14 - maybe I'll use a template literal
07:18 - you are subscribed
07:25 - else the user is not subscribed
07:29 - let's copy this line paste it
07:32 - you are not subscribed
07:35 - Let's test this
07:37 - if I click on the check box then press
07:39 - the submit button it states that I am
07:41 - subscribed you are subscribed if I were
07:44 - to refresh the page I don't click the
07:47 - Subscribe button press submit you are
07:49 - not subscribed alright we know that that
07:51 - works let's move on to the radio buttons
07:55 - first we will check to see if somebody
07:57 - selected Visa
07:59 - we are accessing the Visa radio button
08:02 - if Visa button
08:05 - dot checked if this is true
08:08 - we are changing the text of the payment
08:10 - result paragraph
08:12 - paymentresult dot text
08:15 - content equals
08:18 - you are paying with
08:21 - Visa
08:27 - let's see if that works
08:29 - I'll select Visa press submit you are
08:32 - paying with Visa
08:35 - all right let's add
08:37 - else if
08:40 - the next radio button is Mastercard
08:41 - button if this is checked MasterCard
08:45 - button dot checked
08:48 - then we will change the text content of
08:50 - the payment result to be you are paying
08:52 - with
08:54 - MasterCard
08:58 - you are paying with MasterCard
09:01 - let's add another else if statement
09:03 - else if
09:05 - this time we are examining the PayPal
09:08 - button
09:09 - PayPal button dot checked if this is
09:13 - true change the text content of the
09:16 - payment result to be you are paying with
09:19 - PayPal
09:22 - you are paying with PayPal
09:25 - else if none of these radio buttons are
09:27 - checked
09:29 - we will change the text content of the
09:32 - payment result to be
09:36 - you must select a payment type
09:43 - I will press submit without selecting a
09:45 - payment type
09:46 - you must select a payment type
09:49 - all right everybody so that is the
09:50 - checked property by examining the
09:53 - checked property of an HTML checkbox or
09:55 - a radio button element we can determine
09:58 - if those elements are checked or not and
10:01 - well that is the checked property in
10:03 - JavaScript
