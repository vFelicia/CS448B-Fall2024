00:00 - hey what's good everybody so in today's
00:02 - video I'm going to give you a lesson in
00:03 - destructuring in JavaScript
00:05 - destructuring allows us to extract
00:08 - values from arrays and objects then
00:10 - assign them to variables in a convenient
00:12 - way we can use straight brackets to
00:14 - perform array destructuring or curly
00:17 - braces to perform object destructuring
00:19 - I'll give you five different examples
00:21 - example one swap the value of two
00:24 - variables we'll have let a equal 1 let b
00:29 - equal
00:31 - to use array D structuring we need a set
00:33 - of straight
00:35 - brackets add the variables a comma B
00:39 - this will equal we're creating a new
00:41 - array on the right hand side B comma a
00:45 - on the left hand side of our equals
00:47 - we're using destructuring on the right
00:49 - hand side we're creating an array let's
00:51 - see what's within variables A and B
00:54 - console.log variable a then variable
00:58 - B so if these values are swapped we
01:02 - should have two then one not one and two
01:06 - that's example one we can use
01:07 - destructuring to swap the value of two
01:11 - variables example two we can swap two
01:13 - elements in an array let's create an
01:16 - array of
01:17 - colors const colors equals an array pick
01:22 - some colors I'll go with RGB so that
01:25 - would be red
01:28 - green blue
01:30 - let's add black and
01:34 - white suppose I would like to swap the
01:37 - position of the first element and the
01:39 - last element this first element has an
01:41 - index of zero this particular last
01:44 - element has an index of four again we're
01:46 - going to use array to structuring we
01:48 - need a set of straight brackets we'll
01:50 - take our array colors at index of
01:55 - zero comma array at index of four
02:00 - we want to swap red with white 0 1 2 3 4
02:04 - that's the fourth index equals we're
02:08 - creating a new array by using Straight
02:10 - brackets colors at index 4 comma colors
02:15 - at
02:16 - index0 then let's print our
02:18 - array
02:21 - console.log R array of
02:24 - colors there we go we have white green
02:27 - blue black red that's how we can use
02:30 - destructuring to swap two elements in an
02:33 - array example three we can assign array
02:36 - elements to variables we'll declare a
02:38 - bunch of variables const we'll use
02:40 - destructuring we're destructuring an
02:42 - array we need a set of straight brackets
02:44 - we'll create some variable names first
02:48 - color Second
02:51 - Color third
02:54 - color I will assign this equal to our
02:58 - array colors
03:01 - let's print these
03:02 - variables
03:04 - console.log our first color we have
03:08 - red second
03:10 - color
03:12 - green third
03:14 - color blue you could combine a radi
03:18 - structuring with rest parameters we have
03:21 - two colors left let's assign that to a
03:23 - new array we'll use rest parameters I
03:27 - will name this array EXT ra
03:31 - colors then we will
03:35 - console.log extra colors and that should
03:38 - be a new array that has the remaining
03:40 - colors black and white that's how to
03:43 - assign array elements to variables using
03:47 - destructuring example for extract values
03:50 - from objects we'll create two people
03:53 - objects const person
03:57 - one person one will have a few
03:59 - properties
04:00 - first name will be
04:04 - SpongeBob last name will be
04:10 - SquarePants age will be 30 and a job
04:14 - meaning
04:15 - occupation not John
04:18 - job his job is that he is a fry
04:21 - cook all right let's copy person one
04:24 - looks like that n should be capital in
04:26 - last name all right let's copy person
04:29 - one
04:30 - paste it change person one to person two
04:34 - the first name of person two will be
04:36 - Patrick last name star age will be
04:41 - 34 person two is not going to have a job
04:43 - property he's
04:45 - unemployed using destructuring I can
04:48 - extract values from these
04:50 - objects we'll create a few variables
04:53 - const we'll use object destructuring we
04:55 - need a set of curly braces this time
04:58 - we'll create these variables
05:00 - first
05:01 - name last name age and
05:06 - job now this equals let's start with
05:09 - person
05:10 - one let's display these variables
05:16 - console.log first name is
05:22 - SpongeBob last name
05:26 - SquarePants age 30
05:31 - job fry cook let's do this with person
05:36 - two Patrick Star his ages 34 person two
05:40 - does not have a job property person one
05:43 - does though our job variable is
05:45 - undefined as you can see here you can
05:48 - set default values when using
05:50 - destructuring if somebody doesn't have a
05:52 - job property we'll set job to equal
05:58 - unemployed let's see if that works yep
06:01 - Patrick Star age 34 his job is he's
06:04 - unemployed that's how you can extract
06:06 - values from objects values extracted can
06:09 - even have default
06:11 - values all right last example we can
06:13 - destructure in function parameters we
06:16 - can pass an object to a function and
06:19 - destructure it when it's passed in let's
06:21 - create a function we will create a
06:24 - function to display a person
06:30 - with the parameters we'll use
06:32 - destructuring we're destructuring an
06:33 - object we need a set of curly braces
06:36 - we'll receive an object such as this I'm
06:40 - going to invoke display person we'll
06:43 - pass in person one as an argument when
06:47 - we receive person one as an argument
06:49 - we'll destructure that object right away
06:51 - we will create a first name parameter
06:54 - last
06:55 - name age and
06:58 - job all we'll do is print a few lines
07:01 - using
07:02 - console.log I'll use a template string
07:05 - let's say Name colon space I'll add a
07:09 - placeholder first
07:11 - name and last
07:15 - name let's add a new
07:20 - line age call in space add a placeholder
07:25 - age then lastly
07:28 - job job colon space add a placeholder
07:32 - job we're passing in person one and D
07:35 - structuring it we should display name
07:38 - SpongeBob SquarePants age 30 job fry
07:41 - cook let's pass in person two as an
07:45 - argument name Patrick Star age 34 job is
07:50 - undefined again we can set a default
07:52 - value when destructuring if an object
07:54 - doesn't have a job property we will set
07:56 - that equal to be unemploy
08:00 - employed Patrick Star age 34 job
08:03 - unemployed then if we pass in person one
08:06 - again his job should not be unemployed
08:09 - he's a fry cook there is a job property
08:12 - so we do not use the default value all
08:14 - right everybody so those are a few
08:16 - examples of destructuring there's a lot
08:18 - you can do with destructuring you use a
08:20 - set of straight brackets to perform
08:22 - array destructuring or curly braces for
08:24 - object destructuring they allow you to
08:27 - extract values from arrays an object
08:29 - then assign them to variables in a
08:31 - convenient way and well that is
08:33 - destructuring in
08:39 - JavaScript
