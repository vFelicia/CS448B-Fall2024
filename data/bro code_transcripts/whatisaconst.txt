00:02 - all right welcome back everybody in this
00:03 - video we're going to discuss the const
00:05 - keyword the const keyword specifies that
00:08 - a variable's value is constant it tells
00:11 - the compiler to prevent anything from
00:13 - modifying it so that it's effectively
00:16 - read-only here's an example let's create
00:18 - a program to calculate the circumference
00:20 - of a circle we'll first define the
00:22 - variables that we'll need
00:24 - we have
00:25 - double
00:26 - pi
00:27 - pi equals 3.14
00:32 - then we have double
00:34 - radius pick some radius i'll pick 10.
00:39 - then double
00:41 - circumference
00:44 - equals and here's the formula to
00:46 - calculate the circumference of a circle
00:48 - it's two
00:50 - times
00:51 - pi
00:52 - times
00:54 - radius
00:55 - then we will display our circumference
00:58 - standard output
01:00 - we will display
01:02 - circumference
01:05 - then i'll add
01:06 - maybe centimeters
01:08 - our circumference is
01:12 - 62.83 centimeters
01:14 - any variable we do not want to be able
01:16 - to be changed at all we can turn into a
01:18 - constant
01:19 - let's say that somebody goes into our
01:21 - program and changes pi to a different
01:23 - number like
01:25 - 4 20 69 well then this is going to
01:28 - change the result of our program we may
01:30 - have not realized that somebody changed
01:32 - the value of pi before 2069 so any
01:35 - variable you do not want changed you can
01:37 - prefix this keyword const
01:40 - const double pi now a common naming
01:43 - convention for constants
01:45 - is to make all of the letters uppercase
01:48 - so let's change pi from lowercase to all
01:50 - uppercase
01:51 - and we'll need to make that change here
01:53 - as well now let's try and change pi to
01:56 - 420 69 again and then see what happens
02:00 - okay we have an error assignment of
02:02 - read-only variable pi
02:04 - so by including constants it adds some
02:06 - data security we can't normally change
02:08 - any value that's a constant a couple
02:11 - other examples of variables that you
02:13 - could turn into constants could be maybe
02:15 - the speed of light maybe you have a
02:17 - physics calculator so const
02:20 - and light
02:23 - speed
02:24 - the speed of light in meters per second
02:27 - is two nine nine seven nine two
02:30 - four five eight
02:32 - let's think of one more example perhaps
02:34 - you're working with screen resolutions
02:36 - we have const
02:39 - int
02:40 - width
02:41 - of
02:42 - 1920
02:44 - then
02:45 - constant
02:46 - height
02:48 - of
02:48 - 1080.
02:50 - these may be a few examples of variables
02:52 - you do not want to be changed or altered
02:54 - at all you only want them to be read
02:55 - only yeah that's a const everybody it's
02:58 - a keyword that will modify a variable or
03:01 - some value so that it's read-only and
03:03 - can't be changed you should use
03:05 - constants as often as possible only if
03:07 - you know that a variable is not going to
03:09 - be changed at all your assignment is to
03:12 - think of a constant and post it in the
03:14 - comment section hey if you're enjoying
