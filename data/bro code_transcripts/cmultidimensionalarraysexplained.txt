00:01 - hey everybody in this topic i'm going to
00:03 - explain multi-dimensional arrays more
00:06 - specifically 2d arrays it's an array
00:09 - made up of separate arrays they're
00:11 - useful because they can represent a grid
00:13 - or matrix of data with rows and columns
00:16 - here's an example i'll create a
00:18 - two-dimensional array of cars car names
00:21 - the data type will be string
00:23 - i will name this array cars with arrays
00:26 - they have one set of square brackets but
00:29 - if you're creating a two-dimensional
00:30 - array you need two sets of square
00:32 - brackets the first set of square
00:34 - brackets is for the number of rows
00:37 - let's say three in this example
00:39 - the second set of square brackets
00:40 - corresponds to the number of columns if
00:43 - we have 3 rows and 4 columns 3 times 4
00:46 - is 12 so that would give us 12 elements
00:50 - if you're initializing your 2d array
00:52 - right away you don't necessarily need to
00:54 - set a row size but you do need a column
00:57 - size i'll just set the amount of columns
00:59 - to be three to something small
01:01 - okay so let's fill in the first array
01:04 - this first row will be cars manufactured
01:07 - by ford
01:08 - i'll add a mustang
01:12 - then a ford escape
01:17 - then maybe a ford f-150
01:21 - okay this is our first array
01:24 - i'm going to create a second array after
01:26 - the first array i'll add a comma
01:28 - what i like to do i like to organize my
01:31 - 2d array kind of like it's a grid
01:34 - so now we have a second array this next
01:37 - array will be cars manufactured by
01:39 - chevrolet
01:41 - i'll pick a corvette
01:44 - then an equinox
01:47 - and a silverado
01:51 - let's add one last array
01:54 - these will be cars manufactured by dodge
01:58 - challenger
02:01 - durango
02:04 - ram 1500
02:06 - all right now to finish this
02:08 - two-dimensional array we will enclose
02:10 - all of these inner arrays with another
02:13 - set of curly braces
02:15 - then add a semicolon to the end that is
02:17 - our two-dimensional array
02:19 - you can see that there's rows and
02:21 - columns
02:22 - in this example each row corresponds to
02:25 - a manufacturer
02:27 - so it's kind of like a grid a matrix
02:30 - then if you were to access one of these
02:31 - elements you need two indices just to
02:34 - demonstrate let's display all of them
02:36 - standard output cars
02:41 - i need to select the row number then the
02:44 - column number row 0
02:46 - column 0 let's see what car that is
02:50 - i'm just gonna add a space between these
02:52 - elements
02:54 - okay row zero column zero that's my
02:57 - mustang row zero column zero that's
03:00 - mustang
03:01 - let's print the next element that would
03:03 - be row zero column one
03:07 - that is my forward escape
03:10 - row zero column one i'm just gonna zoom
03:13 - out
03:14 - there then we have row zero column two
03:19 - that's the ford f-150
03:21 - i'm going to display a new line
03:23 - character now we are on row one
03:26 - so let's copy these
03:28 - paste them
03:32 - row one
03:33 - column zero row one column one row one
03:37 - column two
03:39 - so this next row is our cars
03:41 - manufactured by chevrolet we have our
03:44 - corvette our equinox then our silverado
03:50 - then we will display row 2
03:53 - row 2 column 0 row 2 column 1 row 2
03:58 - column 2.
04:00 - and these are the cars manufactured by
04:02 - dodge we have our challenger durango ram
04:05 - 1500
04:06 - so yeah you can see that a two
04:08 - dimensional array is kind of like a grid
04:10 - made up of rows and columns now if we
04:12 - need to iterate over a two-dimensional
04:14 - array and display the elements here's
04:17 - one way in which we can do that we can
04:19 - use nested loops but just to make it
04:21 - easy i'm going to calculate the amount
04:23 - of rows and columns that we have
04:25 - let's begin with the rows
04:27 - int rows
04:28 - equals
04:30 - size of
04:31 - my array cars
04:34 - divided by the size of one of the
04:37 - elements
04:38 - cars at index 0 is good
04:42 - then to calculate the amount of columns
04:43 - that we have we could do something like
04:45 - this
04:46 - and columns equals the size of
04:51 - cars
04:52 - at index of zero
04:54 - divided by the size of
04:57 - one of the elements so remember there's
04:59 - two indices this time
05:02 - zero
05:02 - zero is good
05:04 - in this example we should have three
05:06 - rows as well as three columns
05:08 - now let's create a for loop to iterate
05:10 - over the rows
05:12 - and i equals zero i will continue this
05:15 - as long as i is less than the number of
05:18 - rows that we have
05:20 - then increment i by one
05:22 - i'm going to display
05:25 - cars at index of i just for the time
05:28 - being
05:29 - then for now i'm just going to add a new
05:31 - line between each
05:33 - so if i was to display cars at index i
05:37 - that should give us three memory
05:39 - addresses
05:40 - one address for every inner array
05:44 - this memory address is for the first
05:46 - array
05:47 - then the second array
05:50 - then the third array
05:53 - what i need to do now to get the
05:54 - elements within each array is to create
05:56 - an inner loop
05:59 - let's use an inner for loop to iterate
06:01 - over each element within each array
06:05 - int j because i is already taken set
06:08 - this equal to zero
06:10 - we will continue this for loop as long
06:12 - as j is less than the number of columns
06:15 - that we have
06:16 - increment j by one
06:19 - now i'm going to display
06:23 - cars and there's two indices
06:26 - i
06:28 - then j
06:31 - i'm going to display a space between
06:33 - each of these
06:37 - okay now we have one long line of text
06:40 - so once we escape the inner for loop i
06:43 - would just like to print a new line
06:45 - i'll add standard output
06:48 - new line character
06:52 - okay and here's our two-dimensional
06:54 - array
06:55 - the first row are for cars manufactured
06:57 - by ford
06:59 - then chevrolet
07:01 - then dodge
07:02 - that's how to iterate over a
07:04 - two-dimensional array you have the outer
07:06 - loop that's in charge of the rows the
07:08 - inner loop which is in charge of the
07:10 - columns so that's a two-dimensional
07:12 - array everybody it's just an array where
07:15 - each element is its own separate array
07:17 - you have two indices
07:19 - the first for the rows the second for
07:21 - the columns
07:22 - to access one of the elements you have
07:24 - to specify
07:25 - the row then the column that element is
07:27 - found
07:28 - so those are two-dimensional arrays your
07:30 - assignment is to post a two-dimensional
07:32 - array in the comments section down below
07:34 - and well yeah those are two-dimensional
07:37 - arrays in c plus plus
