00:00 - hey welcome back everybody today I'm
00:02 - going to explain associative arrays it's
00:04 - an array where each element is a key
00:07 - value pair for example we can make an
00:10 - array where each element is a country
00:13 - that's the key and the value is a
00:16 - capital A few other examples could be an
00:19 - ID and a username
00:22 - or an item and a price these would be
00:25 - examples of key value pairs here's an
00:28 - example let's start with a basic array I
00:31 - will create an array of capitals
00:33 - capitals equals we will use the array
00:36 - function
00:38 - we'll begin with keys each key needs to
00:41 - be unique I'll think of four examples we
00:43 - have the USA
00:46 - Japan
00:49 - South Korea
00:53 - then maybe India
00:56 - right now capitals is an array it's not
00:59 - an associative array to change this
01:01 - array into an associative array after
01:04 - each key add an arrow
01:12 - for readability I'm going to place each
01:15 - element on a new line
01:18 - it's not necessary but it's a lot easier
01:20 - for me to read following the arrow we
01:23 - will give each key a value the value in
01:26 - this example will be each country's
01:28 - respective capital
01:30 - the capital of the USA is Washington DC
01:36 - Japan that's Kyoto
01:40 - South Korea
01:42 - that is Seoul
01:45 - India
01:47 - new
01:49 - Delhi
01:51 - we now have an associative array it's
01:53 - made of key value pairs
01:56 - if you need one of the values at a given
01:58 - key
01:59 - we would then access our associative
02:01 - array capitals at index then place your
02:06 - key within the set of square brackets
02:08 - let's find the capital of the USA
02:12 - then let's Echo whatever the result is
02:16 - and the result is Washington DC if I
02:19 - change the key to Japan
02:21 - we will be given the value at this key
02:24 - of Japan
02:27 - to print all of the key value pairs of
02:29 - our associative array we'll use a for
02:31 - each Loop
02:35 - within the parentheses we're going to
02:37 - write something a little different first
02:39 - we need our associative array
02:41 - capitals
02:43 - as
02:45 - key
02:47 - Arrow
02:48 - value
02:50 - this for each Loop will Loop through all
02:53 - of the key value pairs
02:55 - let's print them
02:57 - Echo
02:59 - I'll add a placeholder let's print each
03:01 - key
03:03 - and each value
03:06 - then I'll add a break line
03:09 - here are the keys
03:13 - and here are the values
03:15 - I'll add an equal sign before key and
03:17 - value just so it's more readable
03:20 - that's how to use a for each Loop to
03:22 - Loop through all the key value pairs in
03:24 - this associative array
03:26 - to change one of the values we need to
03:28 - access this array by a key
03:30 - I'll change the capital of the USA to be
03:34 - maybe Las Vegas let's take our
03:36 - associative array
03:39 - then I would like to access using square
03:41 - brackets USA
03:44 - set this equal to some new value the new
03:48 - value will be Las Vegas when I run this
03:52 - program
03:54 - the value at this key is now Las Vegas
03:59 - that's how to update a key value pair
04:01 - First Look up the key then you can set
04:03 - the value equal to some new value
04:06 - to add a new key value pair we will
04:09 - access our associative array
04:12 - add a set of square brackets
04:14 - then place a new key within a set of
04:16 - quotes within the square brackets let's
04:19 - add China
04:20 - will equal
04:23 - Beijing
04:27 - there's our new key value pair the key
04:29 - is China
04:30 - the value is Beijing
04:33 - the pop function will remove the last
04:35 - pair in this array
04:37 - array underscore pop
04:39 - we will pop our associative array
04:42 - capitals
04:44 - our pairing of India and New Delhi is
04:47 - gone
04:48 - that's how to remove the last pair in
04:50 - this array
04:51 - the shift function will remove the first
04:54 - element
04:55 - array
04:56 - shift
04:58 - pass in your array
05:01 - the USA and Washington DC pair is now
05:03 - gone it's shifted out of the array
05:07 - if you ever need all of the keys in this
05:10 - associative array there is an array Keys
05:13 - function
05:14 - array
05:16 - keys
05:17 - pass in your array
05:20 - of capitals
05:22 - this will return a new array
05:25 - I will assign that to a new array let's
05:28 - name it keys
05:30 - then I'm going to display all of the
05:32 - keys within our array using the for each
05:34 - Loop
05:35 - so let's change this a little bit
05:38 - we have an array of keys and I would
05:41 - like to display
05:42 - as key
05:45 - for every key in Keys
05:48 - let's Echo each key then I'll add a line
05:51 - break
05:53 - here are all of the keys within our
05:55 - associative array
05:57 - if you need the values instead there's a
05:59 - values function
06:03 - array
06:05 - values I'll create a new array named
06:08 - values
06:10 - for every value in values
06:15 - print each value
06:19 - and here are the Capitals all of the
06:21 - values within our associative array
06:24 - you can flip the keys and the values by
06:27 - using the flip function
06:29 - array
06:31 - flip
06:33 - pass in your array within the set of
06:35 - parentheses
06:37 - this function will return a new
06:40 - associative array
06:41 - we can either create a new associative
06:43 - array
06:44 - or reassign it
06:47 - I'll reassign our associative array
06:49 - then we need to change our for each loop
06:52 - again
06:53 - so we have capitals as
06:56 - key Arrow
06:58 - value
07:00 - then we will display
07:02 - every key and every value
07:05 - key
07:06 - equals
07:08 - value
07:10 - our values are now switched with our
07:12 - keys the capitals are now the keys the
07:15 - countries are the values that is the
07:18 - array flip function
07:21 - if you need to reverse the order of your
07:24 - pairs you can use the reverse function
07:27 - array underscore reverse
07:30 - pass in your array
07:34 - this will return a new array I will
07:36 - reassign it
07:38 - the order in which we originally placed
07:41 - these key value pairs is now reversed
07:43 - India is now at the beginning the USA is
07:46 - now at the end then if you need the
07:49 - amount of key value pairs you can use
07:51 - the count function Echo count
07:55 - capitals
07:56 - let me get rid of this for each Loop to
07:58 - demonstrate we have four pairs within
08:01 - our associative array one two three four
08:05 - all right everybody so it's time for
08:07 - some practice I will delete everything
08:10 - but our associative array
08:13 - we'll create an HTML document so
08:15 - preceding our PHP script using vs code I
08:18 - will type an exclamation point then hit
08:21 - tab to create some sample HTML we'll
08:24 - create a text box a user is going to
08:26 - type in a country hit submit then we
08:29 - will return the value for that
08:31 - Associated country that capital
08:33 - will need a form
08:36 - be sure to close it right away
08:40 - the action will equal
08:43 - index.php
08:46 - the method will be post
08:50 - let's create a label
08:57 - enter a country
09:02 - then we'll need a text box
09:04 - input type equals text
09:08 - the name will be country
09:14 - then a button input type
09:18 - equals submit
09:22 - here we are
09:25 - within our PHP script we have our
09:27 - associative array
09:29 - we'll need to access whatever's within
09:31 - this text box
09:33 - I'll store that within a new variable
09:35 - named Capital singular Capital equals
09:39 - dollar sign underscore
09:41 - post
09:43 - the value we are trying to access is the
09:47 - name country
09:49 - let's see what we have so far just for
09:52 - testing I'm going to Echo our capital
09:56 - if I type in USA then click submit this
09:59 - should return USA
10:01 - to get the value associated with this
10:04 - key USA
10:06 - I will take our associative array
10:08 - capitals
10:10 - at index
10:12 - of a country so in this example it's USA
10:15 - right I can copy this post variable
10:17 - delete this line within the set of
10:20 - quotes I will place the post variable
10:24 - then get rid of the quotes
10:28 - I will reassign Capital to equal
10:31 - whatever value we receive
10:34 - so I will type in this time
10:36 - Japan
10:38 - then this returns
10:40 - Kyoto
10:42 - we could even put this variable within a
10:44 - sentence
10:46 - the capital is
10:49 - our Capital variable
10:54 - if we type India then click submit the
10:57 - capital is New Delhi all right everybody
10:59 - so that's an associative array it's an
11:01 - array made of key value pairs you could
11:04 - create an associative array of countries
11:06 - and capitals ID numbers and usernames or
11:10 - items and a price those are a few
11:13 - examples and well everybody those are
11:15 - associative arrays in PHP
