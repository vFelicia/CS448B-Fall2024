00:00 - hello again everybody so today we're
00:02 - going to create a quiz game in Python
00:04 - let's declare all of the different
00:06 - Collections and variables that we'll
00:07 - need first we will need a tuple of
00:11 - questions
00:12 - a 2d Tuple of options
00:16 - my quiz will have five questions but you
00:18 - can add more or less questions
00:24 - then a tuple of answers
00:28 - a list of guesses
00:31 - we will be appending guesses to our list
00:33 - that's why we're using a list rather
00:35 - than a tuple
00:37 - a score variable which I will set to be
00:40 - zero then question number
00:43 - this variable will keep track of what
00:45 - number question we're on
00:46 - all right let's begin with our questions
00:48 - I have five
01:02 - foreign
01:15 - here are my questions they're all
01:17 - science related feel free to choose your
01:19 - own this is what I have how many
01:21 - elements are in the periodic table which
01:24 - animal lays the largest eggs what is the
01:27 - most abundant gas in Earth's atmosphere
01:28 - how many bones are in the human body
01:31 - which planet in the solar system is the
01:33 - hottest these are the questions but
01:36 - we'll need options let's add four
01:38 - options for every question that's why
01:40 - we're using a two-dimensional Tuple each
01:43 - inner Tuple will consist of four
01:46 - elements
01:54 - they will be options a
01:57 - B
01:59 - C
02:00 - or D
02:02 - let's copy these elements then paste
02:04 - them within each Tuple
02:09 - this first element corresponds to my
02:11 - first question how many elements are in
02:13 - the periodic table I'll come up with
02:16 - some answers
02:18 - foreign
02:20 - I'll add some answers for the rest of
02:22 - these tuples too
02:50 - we have a tuple of correct answers
02:54 - the orders are C
02:56 - d
02:58 - a
03:00 - a
03:02 - B
03:04 - if you come up with your own options
03:05 - your answers may be different now that
03:08 - we have all of our different Collections
03:10 - and variables taken care of let's
03:12 - display each question
03:14 - I will iterate over our Tuple of
03:16 - questions they are iterable for every
03:19 - question in questions
03:23 - I'm going to print some decorative text
03:28 - I think that's probably good
03:31 - then I will print
03:32 - each question we're iterating over
03:35 - so let's see what we have so far
03:39 - there's all five questions
03:42 - after we display every question I need
03:44 - to display every option
03:46 - for every option in options
03:51 - are options options is a 2d Tuple
03:56 - let's add the index operator
03:59 - the index is going to be our question
04:01 - number variable
04:02 - it's a number
04:04 - so at first we're accessing options at
04:06 - index of zero then one two three four
04:10 - five
04:12 - we will print every option in options at
04:17 - a given row number
04:19 - Let's test this
04:21 - okay we have some options but all of
04:24 - these options are for the first question
04:25 - we will need to increment our question
04:28 - number so let's do that maybe here
04:33 - question
04:35 - number plus equals one
04:41 - that is much better
04:43 - before iterating the question number we
04:45 - will ask the user for a guess
04:49 - equals input
04:53 - enter
04:57 - a
04:58 - b c d
05:03 - in case the user types in something
05:04 - that's lowercase I will follow this
05:07 - input with the upper method to make the
05:09 - user input uppercase
05:11 - we will take our list of guesses
05:16 - use the append method
05:18 - add our guess
05:20 - to that list
05:22 - if our guess is equal to
05:26 - the answers Tuple at index of question
05:29 - number
05:31 - that means the user gets the right
05:33 - answer let's increase the user score
05:35 - score plus equals one
05:38 - then print the word correct
05:41 - correct
05:44 - else we will print
05:48 - incorrect
05:51 - I'll use an F string
05:56 - our answers
05:58 - at index of question number
06:03 - is the correct
06:06 - answer all right let's answer some of
06:09 - these questions
06:13 - see
06:14 - correct which animal lays the largest
06:17 - eggs
06:18 - um definitely the whale because the
06:20 - whale's the largest creature right
06:23 - incorrect D is the correct answer
06:26 - what is the most abundant gas in Earth's
06:28 - atmosphere nitrogen correct how many
06:30 - bones are in the human body D that is
06:33 - incorrect A is the right answer which
06:36 - planet in the solar system is the
06:37 - hottest Mercury because it's closest to
06:40 - the Sun right
06:41 - wrong incorrect B is the correct answer
06:44 - we're keeping track of our answers
06:46 - successfully once we complete all the
06:48 - questions let's print the results
06:52 - I'm going to add some decorative text
06:55 - not necessary but I think it would look
06:57 - cool
07:00 - I will display the results
07:06 - we will iterate over all of the answers
07:08 - and the guesses
07:12 - print
07:14 - answers
07:18 - I'm going to set the ending character to
07:21 - be an empty string
07:24 - for every answer in
07:28 - answers
07:31 - print
07:33 - each answer
07:35 - I will set the ending character to be a
07:38 - space to separate each answer
07:41 - then I'll add a new print line
07:44 - let's do this with guesses
07:47 - change answers to guesses for every
07:51 - guess in guesses print each guess
07:57 - okay I'm gonna run this again
07:59 - I'm just gonna make up some answers a b
08:02 - c d a
08:05 - Q are the correct answers here are the
08:07 - guesses I guess none of them right then
08:10 - we will print a score
08:14 - equals
08:15 - take our score divided by
08:19 - I'm going to use the length function
08:20 - then pass in our questions
08:23 - how many elements are within our
08:26 - questions tubble then I will multiply
08:28 - all of this by 100 to give us a
08:31 - percentage then Typecast this whole
08:34 - formula as an integer
08:37 - so we're basically just reassigning our
08:39 - score variable
08:41 - then let's print using an F string
08:44 - your score is
08:48 - our score variable
08:50 - then add percent
08:52 - I'm going to intentionally get all the
08:54 - answers right
08:56 - c d a a
09:00 - B
09:01 - here are the answers here are your
09:03 - guesses your score is 100 this time I'll
09:06 - try and get a few incorrect
09:07 - intentionally
09:09 - c c c c c c
09:13 - your score is 20 percent
09:15 - all right everybody well that is a quiz
09:17 - game feel free to add more or less
09:19 - questions or come up with your own
09:21 - questions and that is a quiz game
09:24 - written in Python
