00:02 - all right typedef typedef is a reserved
00:05 - keyword that gives an existing data type
00:08 - a nickname here's an example let's
00:11 - create a character array of 25 bytes and
00:14 - we'll say that this is user one so
00:16 - character
00:17 - user one and the size is 25 bytes
00:21 - and then make up some username
00:24 - okay so writing some of the syntax can
00:26 - be somewhat tedious what a lot of c
00:28 - programmers will do is that they will
00:30 - use this type def keyword to give some
00:33 - data type a nickname let's use this
00:36 - typedef keyword to give a character
00:38 - array of 25 bytes some nickname so i'll
00:41 - do this outside of the main function we
00:43 - will type type def
00:46 - then our data type
00:48 - so this is a character array of 25 bytes
00:51 - and we need some sort of nickname so
00:52 - let's say that a character array of 25
00:55 - bytes will be known as a user
00:59 - now i don't need all of the syntax now i
01:01 - can type my data type
01:03 - user and then some variable name let's
01:05 - say user1 from this point forward if i
01:08 - need a character array of 25 bytes i can
01:11 - call that a user that's my nickname now
01:14 - one place where you see this used a lot
01:16 - is with structs this time let's create a
01:18 - struct at first we won't use the typedef
01:21 - keyword and then i'll show you the
01:23 - benefits later so let's say this is a
01:25 - struct
01:26 - and the tag name is user
01:28 - users will have let's say three members
01:31 - a character array named name of 25 bytes
01:36 - a password of 12 bytes
01:41 - and int id like an id number
01:44 - so to create a struct we would have to
01:46 - type struct
01:48 - then the tag name
01:49 - user
01:50 - and a variable name
01:52 - and let's assign some of these values
01:54 - i'll assign a name password and id
02:00 - looks good to me okay then if i need to
02:02 - create user two
02:05 - i would type again struct
02:07 - some unique variable name and make up
02:09 - some values
02:12 - okay so with a struct if i would like to
02:14 - use the typedef keyword i will precede
02:17 - the struct keyword with typedef
02:21 - and i don't necessarily need this tag
02:23 - name and after the last curly brace here
02:26 - i will add my nickname i'll call this a
02:28 - user if we need to create a user struct
02:31 - we no longer need to use the struct
02:33 - keyword we can remove this
02:36 - and this should work so let's print some
02:38 - of these members
02:55 - and here are the two users that we
02:58 - created yeah so in conclusion typedef is
03:01 - a reserved keyword that gives an
03:03 - existing data type a nickname and it's
03:06 - mostly used for convenience if we use
03:08 - the typed up keyword when declaring a
03:10 - struct we no longer need to use that
03:13 - struct keyword to create a struct we can
03:16 - just use this nickname as the data type
03:18 - and then come up with some unique
03:20 - variable name so yeah that is the
03:22 - typedef keyword if you found this video
