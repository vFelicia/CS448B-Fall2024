00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
00:01 - bro here and in this video I'm going to
00:03 - teach you guys how you can create some
00:04 - pretty sweet shadow effects in CSS so
00:07 - let's get into it
00:10 - now there's two different kinds of
00:12 - shadow properties that I'm going to be
00:13 - discussing with you guys
00:14 - they are text shadows for text and box
00:17 - shadows for other HTML elements so let's
00:21 - begin by adding some sample text to our
00:23 - web page on our HTML document all we
00:26 - really need to do is just add one line
00:28 - here just writing shadow demo using h1
00:32 - tags should suffice for this so let's
00:34 - save reload honestly this is all we need
00:36 - for this demonstration we're going to do
00:38 - everything else on our CSS document so
00:41 - let's make a few changes before we do
00:42 - introduce shadows so I'm going to target
00:45 - the h1 tag I believe I'll add a border
00:48 - that is 1 pixel and solid let's add a
00:52 - width of 200 pixels and maybe some
00:58 - padding of 25 pixels
01:00 - alright let's save this and reload the
01:03 - page okay this should work for now I'm
01:05 - happy with it
01:06 - so we have two different kinds of
01:09 - shadows to work with text shadows and
01:13 - I'll just set this to zero for now as
01:14 - well as box shadows and I will also set
01:20 - this to zero now with each of these
01:23 - properties there's four fields that we
01:25 - can fill in for values that we can
01:27 - assign and I'm going to write these as a
01:29 - comment so I'm going to create a cheat
01:32 - sheet for you guys so I'm going to write
01:35 - it within here the first is the
01:37 - horizontal displacement and you can
01:39 - write this in pixels the second is the
01:44 - vertical displacement also in pixels
01:48 - third is the blur effect also in pixels
01:53 - and lastly is the color you can choose a
01:58 - color name an RGB value or a hexadecimal
02:02 - value all right now with all of these
02:05 - values the same thing also applies for
02:07 - the Box shadow so I'm going to put our
02:10 - cheep-cheep right underneath it and
02:11 - we'll fill a few of these out for the
02:13 - text shadow first and then the Box
02:15 - shadow let's begin with text shadows so
02:17 - this first value applies to the
02:19 - horizontal displacement of the shadow
02:21 - relative to the text
02:23 - and the second value is the vertical
02:26 - displacement of the shadow relative to
02:28 - the text so if we were to set our
02:31 - horizontal displacement to maybe two or
02:34 - another positive number we would have a
02:36 - shadow effect that is on the right hand
02:39 - side of our text if this was a negative
02:41 - number this would move to the left and
02:44 - the greater the magnitude the greater
02:47 - the displacement would be like am I set
02:49 - this to negative 20 pixels we would have
02:51 - a shadow that's very far out to the left
02:54 - so you can change these depending on
02:56 - what sort of shadow effect you want and
02:58 - the same thing applies to our vertical
03:01 - displacement so a positive number would
03:03 - create a shadow effect downwards and a
03:06 - negative number would create a shadow
03:09 - effect upwards and then you can combine
03:11 - both of these so maybe we'll pick five
03:13 - pixels by five pixels
03:15 - we'll end up with the shadow that goes
03:17 - down and to the right although it's a
03:18 - little difficult to see because the
03:20 - shadows black as well as the text color
03:22 - so we'll have to change that so we can
03:24 - also add a blur effect that is the third
03:27 - value that we can type in here and the
03:29 - magnitude of the blur effect is in
03:32 - pixels so we'll start with one pixel and
03:35 - see what effect this has so there's not
03:38 - much of a change here with one pixel
03:39 - let's increase this to two okay we're
03:43 - getting somewhere
03:43 - and then maybe three all right three is
03:46 - not too bad but I think I'm going to
03:48 - change the horizontal and vertical
03:51 - displacement back to two and that
03:53 - doesn't look too bad
03:54 - that's like a 3d effect which is pretty
03:56 - sweet now with the fourth value we can
03:59 - add a color you can pick a color name an
04:02 - RGB value or a hexadecimal value I think
04:05 - I'll just pick something simple like
04:06 - yellow so let's save reload and we now
04:10 - have a yellow shadow effect around our
04:12 - text and what we end up with is a yellow
04:15 - shadow effect that is displaced to
04:18 - pixels down vertically and to pixels to
04:20 - the right horizontally now you can
04:22 - actually create a glow effect if you set
04:25 - the horizontal as well as the vertical
04:28 - displacement to zero it would actually
04:30 - appear as if this text was glowing which
04:32 - is pretty cool too but I'm going to
04:34 - change the blur effect up
04:37 - lately it's kind of like a light bulb or
04:39 - a neon glow of some sort I think that's
04:42 - pretty sweet and another cool thing that
04:43 - you can do with shadows is that you can
04:45 - add more than one for example we could
04:47 - add a second shadow and I decided for
04:49 - that this demonstration I want to create
04:52 - a shadow effect that makes my text look
04:54 - like it's on fire so I'm going to add a
04:56 - second red shadow that's slightly above
04:59 - the text so what you can do if you want
05:01 - to add a second shadow after the first
05:04 - set of values just add a comma and you
05:06 - can add in a whole nother set of values
05:08 - to add so if I want a red shadow effect
05:12 - that hovers above the text I will set
05:14 - our horizontal displacement to zero
05:16 - pixels for the vertical displacement
05:19 - maybe negative five pixels then for a
05:22 - blur five pixels is good and then for a
05:26 - color I will pick red so let's save this
05:29 - reload and we now have this sweet fire
05:32 - effect for our text now let's move on to
05:35 - box shadows it's a very similar process
05:37 - to what we had with text shadows except
05:40 - a box shadow will target an HTML element
05:43 - so this box shadow is going to be
05:45 - displaced relative to where this border
05:49 - is so let's fill this in so we need a
05:52 - horizontal as well as a vertical
05:54 - positioning for this shadow I think I
05:56 - will set this first one to ten and the
05:59 - second one to ten so let's save reload
06:01 - we now have this very sharp black shadow
06:04 - but we'll probably want to add a blur to
06:07 - make it look more natural so I tend to
06:09 - like five pixels for my blur all right
06:12 - but it's still somewhat dark so we can
06:14 - also change the color and I think I will
06:17 - use a hexadecimal value this time so if
06:20 - you use all sixes so that's six sixes
06:23 - this will be like a nice grayish dark
06:26 - color and I think that's pretty sweet so
06:29 - that's all the Box shadow is it adds a
06:31 - shadow effect around an HTML element
06:33 - much like the text shadow adds a shadow
06:36 - effect around text so that's the very
06:39 - basics of using shadows in CSS I'm just
06:41 - going to add a few other changes not
06:43 - related to shadows but just a few
06:45 - properties I want to add to make the
06:47 - shadow really stand out and look really
06:49 - cool so I'm just
06:51 - to change the background color of our
06:53 - HTML element so background - color -
06:56 - black let's see what we have so far all
07:00 - right you can really see the shadow
07:02 - effect now but the text is somewhat dark
07:05 - so I'm going to change the color of that
07:07 - so the color of our text we can change
07:11 - that to maybe white okay that's pretty
07:14 - sweet it's kind of like the text is so
07:17 - hot that it's glowing and giving off
07:19 - flames but I also want to change the
07:21 - border color so I'm going to say border
07:25 - - color black let's save reload all
07:30 - right that is pretty sweet I'm pretty
07:33 - happy with that so yeah I guess that is
07:36 - the basics of using text shadows as well
07:39 - as box shadows in CSS if you want a copy
07:42 - of all this markup that we worked on
07:44 - today I'll post it in the comments down
07:46 - below and pin it to the top but yeah
07:48 - that is how you can create basic shadows
07:51 - in CSS hey you if you enjoyed this
