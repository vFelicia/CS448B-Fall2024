00:02 - all right what's going on people string
00:03 - interpolation
00:05 - string interpolation allows us to insert
00:07 - variables or values into a
00:10 - string literal we precede a string
00:12 - literal with a dollar sign
00:14 - and then any placeholders within a
00:17 - string literal
00:18 - that is interpolated we can use to
00:20 - insert values or variables within so
00:23 - here's an example of where
00:24 - string interpolation could be useful
00:26 - let's say we have three variables
00:28 - first name last name and age let's
00:30 - declare those
00:32 - string first name make up a first name
00:37 - string last name make up
00:40 - a last name and then an edge
00:45 - okay so what if we would like to display
00:47 - somebody's first name last name
00:49 - and their age let's use a standard
00:51 - string literal first
00:53 - and we'll look at the differences so if
00:55 - i would like to display something like
00:58 - hello plus first name
01:03 - plus i'll add a space plus
01:06 - last name and then maybe add like a
01:10 - period at the end well i would have to
01:13 - concatenate all of these separate
01:15 - strings together and then let me display
01:18 - age two console.writeline u
01:21 - r plus age
01:25 - plus years old
01:29 - so this works fine but an easier way is
01:31 - to use string interpolation
01:33 - so what we're going to do is create a
01:35 - string literal
01:36 - and then pre-seed this with a dollar
01:38 - sign and then write a string normally
01:41 - hello wherever you would like to insert
01:44 - a value or variable
01:45 - add a set of curly braces as a
01:47 - placeholder
01:48 - and i would like to insert first name
01:50 - here then add a space
01:53 - and here within my string literal i will
01:55 - insert
01:56 - last name and then maybe add a period to
02:00 - the end
02:00 - and let's do the same thing with our
02:02 - second line so we need a string literal
02:04 - a double set of quotes precede this with
02:07 - the dollar sign
02:08 - you are curly braces
02:12 - age years old and this will do the exact
02:16 - same thing
02:17 - however it's less work
02:20 - so hello first name last name you are
02:23 - edge years old
02:24 - another thing that you can do too is
02:25 - that when you display one of these
02:27 - values
02:27 - you can allocate some room after the
02:30 - variable name
02:30 - add a comma and then how many spaces you
02:33 - would like to allocate
02:34 - let's say that when i display my age i
02:36 - would like to allocate 10 spaces worth
02:38 - of room to display
02:39 - my age and this is what that looks like
02:43 - you are then i have 10 spaces including
02:47 - the two digits in my age and if this was
02:50 - negative
02:50 - this would be left aligned
02:55 - so my age is all the way over here then
02:56 - i have eight spaces afterwards
02:59 - so yeah that's string interpolation it
03:01 - allows us to insert variables into a
03:04 - string literal we precede a string
03:06 - literal with a dollar sign
03:08 - and then curly braces within as
03:10 - placeholders for
03:11 - values or variables so yeah that's
03:14 - string interpolation
