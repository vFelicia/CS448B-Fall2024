00:02 - all right guys we are on nested loops a
00:04 - nested loop is just a loop that's inside
00:07 - of another loop it doesn't matter what
00:09 - kind of loop you're working with it can
00:11 - be a while loop or a forward loop or
00:13 - whatever here's an example we'll create
00:15 - a loop to count the numbers 1 through
00:17 - 10. we'll count to 10 three times
00:20 - so let's create a basic loop for now
00:23 - and i i'll set this equal to b
00:26 - 1
00:27 - the condition will be i is less than or
00:30 - equal to 10 then i will increment i by
00:33 - one
00:34 - during each iteration
00:36 - i will display
00:38 - whatever i is
00:39 - then i'll add a space
00:44 - there
00:47 - this loop will count up to 10
00:50 - just like that so now i would like to
00:52 - count up to 10 three times well i can
00:55 - stick this loop in another loop so let's
00:58 - create the outer loop
01:01 - four
01:02 - and i i'll set this equal to be one
01:05 - i'll continue this as long as i is less
01:08 - than or equal to three
01:10 - then increment i by one
01:13 - so i'm going to take this loop
01:15 - and stick it within the curly braces of
01:18 - the outer for loop
01:19 - however you don't want these loops to
01:21 - have the same index
01:23 - a common naming convention for the inner
01:25 - loop is to use j as the counting index
01:29 - j j
01:31 - j
01:32 - j
01:32 - okay let's take a look
01:36 - okay now we count up to 10 three times
01:40 - but what i think i'm gonna do is that
01:42 - every time we exit the for loop the
01:44 - inner for loop i'll just print a new
01:46 - line character
01:48 - standard output
01:51 - new line
01:54 - yeah that's much better
01:56 - so yeah a nested loop is just a loop
01:58 - inside of another loop
01:59 - just as a practice project let's create
02:02 - a program that will print a rectangle
02:03 - made out of symbols we'll let a user
02:06 - specify how many rows and columns we'll
02:09 - use our nested loop that we created
02:10 - previously
02:12 - so we have int rows
02:14 - int
02:15 - columns
02:16 - then char
02:18 - symbol
02:20 - we're going gonna ask for some user
02:22 - input we'll need some prompts
02:24 - standard output
02:26 - how many rows
02:31 - standard
02:32 - input
02:34 - rows
02:36 - let's copy this paste it
02:39 - change rows to columns
02:45 - then
02:47 - enter a symbol to use
02:53 - standard input
02:56 - symbol
02:57 - we'll continue printing rows as long as
03:00 - i is less than or equal to rows whatever
03:03 - we typed in we don't want any more rows
03:05 - than what the user wants the inner loop
03:08 - is going to be in charge of the columns
03:10 - j is less than or equal to columns
03:15 - in place of printing j let's print our
03:18 - symbol whatever the user picked
03:20 - and we do not need to separate these
03:22 - with any spaces all right let's try this
03:27 - how many rows what about three rows
03:30 - then six columns enter a symbol to use
03:34 - what about the at sign
03:37 - and there's our rectangle there's three
03:39 - rows
03:41 - and six columns
03:44 - let's try it one last time
03:47 - how about four rows and five columns
03:49 - i'll use a dollar sign
03:52 - okay we have four rows one two three
03:54 - four five columns one two three four
03:57 - five
03:58 - so yeah everybody that's a nested loop
04:01 - it's a loop that's inside of another
04:02 - loop when you'll use these it really
04:04 - depends on the situation i thought this
04:06 - would be a fun practice project if you
04:08 - would like a copy of this code i'll post
04:10 - this in the comments section down below
04:12 - and well yeah those are nested loops in
04:14 - c plus
