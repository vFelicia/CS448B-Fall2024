00:00 - hey everybody so today I got to explain
00:02 - conditional expressions in Python a
00:05 - conditional expression is a oneline
00:07 - shortcut for using an IFL statement if
00:10 - you're familiar with other programming
00:11 - languages this is also known as the tary
00:14 - operator it behaves similarly using
00:17 - conditional Expressions we can print or
00:19 - assign one of two values based on a
00:22 - condition here's the formula return X if
00:25 - our condition is true else return y
00:28 - here's a basic example
00:30 - we will create a variable for number
00:32 - just num let's say our number is five
00:36 - I'm going to print then within our print
00:38 - statement I will write a conditional
00:40 - expression following this formula I'll
00:43 - just copy and paste it let's check to
00:45 - see if our number is positive let's
00:49 - print the text positive if our condition
00:53 - what are we checking let's check to see
00:55 - if num is greater than zero that means
00:59 - it's positive
01:00 - if this condition is false we will
01:02 - instead print whatever comes after else
01:06 - else negative number is five that will
01:10 - print positive if our number was Nega
01:12 - five well this condition would be false
01:15 - we would instead print negative let's go
01:18 - over another let's check to see if our
01:21 - number is even or odd let's set numb to
01:25 - be
01:26 - six this time I will assign the result
01:28 - to a variable
01:30 - our result
01:32 - equals take our
01:35 - formula let's
01:38 - assign even if our
01:42 - num modulus 2 is our number divisible by
01:47 - two does that equal zero else return odd
01:53 - then let's print our
01:55 - result
01:58 - result number six that is even if it's
02:01 - five then it's
02:03 - odd assign even if our number is
02:07 - divisible by two else return
02:11 - odd let's create variables A and
02:16 - B A will equal 6 B will equal
02:21 - 7 let's create a variable of Max num
02:26 - equals follow our formula again
02:31 - return variable a if a is greater than b
02:36 - else return B between A and B which is
02:39 - the maximum number that would be B of
02:43 - seven let's find the minimum this
02:47 - time Min num a if a is less than b else
02:54 - return B the minimum number between six
02:57 - and seven is six
03:02 - this time we'll take an age age equals
03:05 - 25 we will create a variable of status
03:08 - equals use our formula
03:12 - again return a string of adult if our
03:17 - age is greater than or equal to 18 else
03:21 - return a string of child then we will
03:24 - print our status our age is 25 that's
03:28 - greater than or equal to 18 we will
03:29 - print adult if our age was 13 then we
03:34 - are a child we will instead return
03:37 - child let's work with the
03:39 - temperature temperature equals 30Â°
03:44 - C so that's
03:47 - hot let's create a variable of weather
03:50 - assign a string of hot if our
03:54 - temperature is greater than 20 else we
03:58 - will return a string of cold what's the
04:02 - weather outside today based on the
04:03 - temperature it is hot if our temperature
04:07 - was
04:08 - 20 then the weather is cold okay last
04:14 - example we will work with a user role I
04:18 - will set this to be
04:21 - admin we will Define a variable of
04:24 - access level
04:26 - equals again follow our formula
04:32 - return the text of full access if our
04:37 - condition of user
04:40 - role is equal to a string of admin else
04:45 - we will
04:46 - return
04:48 - limited
04:50 - access our user role is an admin let's
04:53 - print our access level and we have full
04:56 - access but what if we were a guest
05:00 - well then we have limited access all
05:02 - right everybody those are conditional
05:04 - Expressions they're a oneline shortcut
05:07 - for the if else statement it's similar
05:09 - to the tary operator and other
05:11 - programming languages using conditional
05:13 - Expressions we can print or assign one
05:16 - of two values based on a condition you
05:19 - follow the formula of return X if our
05:23 - condition is true else return y if it's
05:26 - false and well everybody those are a few
05:28 - examples of condition expressions in
05:30 - Python
