00:00 - hey it's you bro hope you're doing well
00:02 - in this video we're going to be
00:03 - discussing the
00:04 - two string method in java so sit back
00:06 - relax and enjoy the show
00:10 - if you find this video helpful please
00:11 - remember to like
00:13 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:15 - help keep this channel running
00:17 - welcome back guys and gals in this video
00:19 - i'm gonna be teaching you guys all about
00:21 - the tostring method
00:22 - this is a special method that all
00:25 - objects inherit
00:26 - it returns a string that textually
00:28 - represents an object
00:30 - so let me give you an example i have
00:32 - another class called car
00:34 - and a few variables related to cars such
00:36 - as a make
00:37 - a model a color and a year and i took
00:40 - the liberty of assigning these values
00:42 - already
00:42 - so it's a ford mustang that's red and
00:45 - the year is 20 21.
00:47 - now we have four variables here right
00:49 - what if
00:50 - we wanted to display all of these values
00:53 - so first we need to create an instance
00:55 - of this class
00:56 - we're going to create a car object we
00:58 - can do that by stating car
01:00 - let's call this car equals new car
01:03 - alright and in order to display all of
01:06 - these values within our car class
01:08 - we would need a bunch of print line
01:10 - statements luckily i just copied and
01:12 - pasted what i had before
01:14 - so within a print line we would print
01:16 - the cars make
01:17 - the car's model the car's color and the
01:19 - car's
01:20 - ear so if we were to run this this will
01:23 - display
01:24 - all of the values the textual
01:26 - representation
01:27 - of this object now what if we displayed
01:31 - with a print line statement
01:33 - car instead of one of the attributes so
01:35 - within a print line statement
01:37 - i'm going to instead just type in car
01:42 - and what the heck is this all right so
01:44 - let me explain
01:46 - this is the address of this car object
01:49 - in memory it's like the street address
01:51 - like one two three fake street
01:53 - so this is the address where you can
01:55 - find this car object
01:57 - in your computer's memory so normally
02:00 - we're using the
02:00 - tostring method and all objects will
02:03 - actually inherit
02:04 - a tostring method so if we were to type
02:07 - in
02:08 - the name of our car dot we actually have
02:10 - access to a
02:12 - tostring method and by default we
02:14 - actually call the tostring method behind
02:16 - the scenes
02:17 - implicitly when we use a print or print
02:20 - line statement
02:21 - so if i were to type car dot to string
02:25 - it's going to do the exact same thing
02:27 - which we have here
02:29 - so it's going to return the address of
02:32 - where this car
02:32 - object is in memory but what many people
02:35 - do
02:36 - is that they will override and change
02:38 - the tostring method
02:40 - to instead print a textual
02:42 - representation
02:43 - of this object and that's what we're
02:45 - going to be doing in today's video
02:47 - now within our car class we're going to
02:49 - be overriding the
02:50 - to string method method overriding is a
02:53 - different video so if you'd like to
02:54 - learn more about it
02:55 - feel free to check out that video so
02:58 - let's override
02:59 - the two string method and have it do
03:01 - something else so this is a
03:03 - public method it's going to be returning
03:05 - a string
03:06 - so instead of saying void we're going to
03:08 - be returning a string
03:10 - and the name of this method is the to
03:12 - string method
03:14 - make sure you spell it exactly like this
03:17 - now it's asking for us to add a return
03:20 - type
03:20 - so we're going to return a string back
03:23 - to the tostring method when we call it
03:26 - so let's make up a string let's call it
03:29 - my string it really doesn't matter what
03:31 - you call it for the most part
03:33 - and let's declare what my string is
03:36 - my string equals now we can actually
03:40 - return all of these values in string
03:43 - representation
03:44 - so my string is going to equal let's say
03:47 - make
03:48 - and we can format this however we want
03:50 - make plus
03:52 - maybe a new line plus
03:55 - model maybe let's add another new line
04:01 - the color plus a new line
04:07 - and the ear
04:12 - and that should be it all right another
04:14 - way in which you can write this
04:16 - that only has one line of code instead
04:18 - of declaring
04:19 - the string my string we take all of this
04:23 - copy it delete the first line
04:26 - and return everything like that
04:31 - so that's another way of writing what we
04:33 - had before
04:34 - done in only one line of code so this is
04:37 - going to return a string representation
04:40 - of all of these attributes of our car
04:42 - it's going to return
04:43 - the make the model the color and the ear
04:46 - so now if we were to run this we're
04:48 - going to be using our car's
04:50 - two string method and instead of getting
04:53 - an address
04:54 - of this car we're going to get a textual
04:56 - representation
04:58 - of this object all of the attributes
05:00 - that this car has
05:02 - the make the model the color and the ear
05:05 - so this is an explicit use of the
05:08 - two string method and not only can we
05:10 - use the
05:11 - tostring method explicitly but we can
05:14 - use it
05:14 - implicitly so let's write another print
05:17 - line statement
05:18 - but this time we're going to only print
05:21 - the name of our car and the result
05:26 - is no different it's exactly the same so
05:29 - we're implicitly using the tostring
05:31 - method of our car
05:32 - when we use a print or print line
05:34 - statement so you can use either one you
05:37 - can either
05:38 - call this tostring method explicitly or
05:41 - implicitly but the point being is that
05:43 - you can override the tostring method
05:46 - to return a string representation of all
05:49 - of the attributes
05:50 - of an object so that's how the tostring
05:53 - method works in java
05:54 - if you would like a copy of all this
05:56 - code i will post all of this in the
05:58 - comments down below
05:59 - but yeah that's how the tostring method
06:01 - works in java
06:04 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
06:06 - learn something new
06:08 - then you can help me help you in three
06:11 - easy steps
