00:02 - all right people well
00:03 - i thought for practice we could create a
00:05 - sort of calculator program we can pick
00:07 - two numbers
00:08 - we can add them subtract them multiply
00:10 - them and divide them
00:11 - so let's get started this will be just a
00:13 - very simple project
00:14 - i'm going to write just calculator
00:17 - program
00:18 - when we begin this program and then
00:21 - maybe
00:21 - i don't know format it a little bit
00:23 - let's add some
00:24 - i don't know dashes or something just to
00:26 - kind of make this look nice
00:28 - this will all be within the console okay
00:30 - so we'll need to declare
00:32 - num1 num2 and result these will be
00:35 - doubles double num1 i'll set the sequel
00:38 - to
00:39 - zero let's create num2
00:44 - and result double result
00:48 - and i will set that equal to zero as
00:50 - well
00:51 - okay we will need to ask for some user
00:53 - input
00:55 - console.writeline enter
00:58 - number one colon space
01:01 - and then we will assign num1 equals
01:05 - so user input's always a string we'll
01:07 - need to convert this to
01:09 - a double convert dot to double
01:14 - and within the parenthesis we need
01:18 - console.read
01:19 - line method okay let's do the same thing
01:23 - for num2
01:25 - enter number two num2
01:28 - equals convert dot 2 double pass in
01:32 - console.readline now we need the user to
01:35 - type in an option do they want to add or
01:37 - subtract multiply
01:38 - or divide so let's type
01:42 - enter an option
01:48 - console.writeline again what about
01:52 - plus colon space add
01:58 - then minus colon space
02:01 - subtract
02:05 - asterisk for multiply
02:12 - and forward slash for divide
02:15 - you can add other options if you want to
02:17 - okay let's take a look at this so far
02:20 - so we have calculator program enter
02:23 - number one what about three point one
02:25 - four
02:26 - enter number two uh let's say
02:29 - i don't know five okay a couple things
02:32 - i'm going to change real quick i'm going
02:34 - to change
02:34 - this right line to just right
02:37 - then i'm going to add a tab escape
02:40 - sequence
02:41 - that is backslash t for tab
02:46 - just so that it looks better
02:51 - okay let's continue so i'm going to
02:53 - create a switch that will read our user
02:55 - input
02:57 - switch console dot
03:00 - read line
03:04 - and we need matching cases case
03:09 - plus so if somebody would like to add
03:12 - we will take our result equals
03:15 - num1 plus num two
03:21 - console.writeline and i'll do some
03:23 - string interpolation
03:27 - your result colon space
03:32 - num1 plus
03:36 - num2 equals
03:41 - plus result and then we need to break
03:45 - out of this case
03:47 - okay let's do the same thing with minus
03:51 - case minus result equals
03:54 - num1 minus num2
03:58 - num1 minus num2
04:01 - and that's all we need then we need
04:04 - multiply
04:06 - case asterisk result
04:09 - equals num1 times num2 replace minus
04:15 - with
04:15 - asterisk and then divide
04:21 - case forward slash for division result
04:25 - equals num1 divided by num2
04:28 - and replace the asterisk here
04:33 - and then we should probably add a
04:34 - default case just in case somebody
04:36 - doesn't pick one of these options
04:40 - default
04:44 - that was not a valid
04:48 - option and then break
04:53 - enter number one three point four
04:56 - enter number two uh let's say 6.9
05:01 - and i would like to multiply these so
05:04 - i will add an asterisk
05:07 - 3.14 times 6.9 equals 21.666
05:11 - all right i'm just going to change one
05:13 - thing i'm going to add
05:15 - one line right before we read our user's
05:18 - input for
05:18 - what operation they would like to use
05:22 - so let's add console dot
05:25 - right now right line enter
05:29 - an option
05:32 - then let's try it again 3.14
05:36 - multiplied by 6.9 is
05:41 - 21.666 okay now what if somebody would
05:45 - like to continue using this calculator
05:47 - so what we'll do is place all of this
05:49 - code within a do while loop
05:51 - i'm not sure if i discussed this in the
05:53 - past but a do while loop will always
05:55 - execute a body of code once
05:57 - and then it checks the condition at the
05:59 - end
06:01 - so let's add that here so we have
06:04 - do at the top then we need our while
06:07 - with condition
06:10 - while all right now before this
06:13 - let's ask for some user input
06:18 - console.writeline
06:21 - would you like to continue
06:29 - capital y equals yes
06:32 - capital n equals no
06:37 - and then we will read some user input so
06:40 - within
06:41 - the while loop the condition this will
06:43 - be
06:46 - console.readline
06:49 - dot 2 upper
06:52 - so in case they type in lowercase y or n
06:55 - we'll just change it to uppercase via
06:58 - the two upper method
06:59 - and let's check to see if this is equal
07:02 - to y
07:03 - if it is then we'll reset our num1 num2
07:06 - and result variables and do this all
07:08 - over again
07:10 - and if they would not like to continue
07:12 - let's write
07:14 - by okay let's try this again
07:18 - what is three point one four divided by
07:20 - two so enter number one three point one
07:22 - four enter number two
07:23 - two and let's divide these the result is
07:27 - one point five
07:28 - seven let's type y for yes
07:31 - all right then we can do this all over
07:32 - again what is five
07:35 - divided by three point one four so i
07:38 - will divide
07:40 - and the result is one point five nine
07:42 - something something something
07:44 - would you like to continue i'm going to
07:45 - type and for no
07:47 - bye so yeah that's a very simple
07:50 - calculator program in c sharp i will
07:52 - post this code in the comment section
07:54 - down below
07:54 - if you can give this video a thumbs up
07:56 - leave a random comment down below
