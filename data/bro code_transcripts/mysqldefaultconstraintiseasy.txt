00:00 - hey everybody in this topic I'm going to
00:02 - explain the default constraint when
00:04 - inserting a new row if we do not specify
00:07 - a value for a column by default we can
00:10 - add some value that we set here's an
00:12 - example let's select all from our
00:14 - products table select all from products
00:19 - in an earlier example we have a table of
00:22 - products a few items on the menu for
00:24 - sale are hamburgers fries soda and ice
00:26 - cream let's add a few items on the menu
00:28 - that would be free this could include
00:30 - napkins straws forks and spoons
00:33 - something you would commonly see at a
00:35 - fast food restaurant if we're not using
00:37 - the default constraint we would have to
00:39 - enter in those prices manually
00:41 - so let's insert into our table products
00:46 - R values
00:48 - product ID 104 will be
00:52 - a straw
00:54 - the price will be zero dollars and zero
00:57 - cents
00:58 - let's do this all together
01:03 - we have 105.
01:05 - 106
01:07 - 107.
01:09 - product number 105 will be a napkin
01:16 - the napkin is zero dollar zero cents
01:19 - 106 is a plastic fork
01:23 - again zero dollars and zero cents
01:27 - 107 is a plastic spoon
01:32 - the price is zero dollars and zero cents
01:36 - then I will select all from my products
01:39 - table
01:42 - here's our new products table we have
01:44 - our four items that actually cost
01:46 - something then our free items which are
01:49 - included with whatever we buy in place
01:51 - of explicitly stating a price one way in
01:54 - which we can make our lives easier if
01:56 - we're adding a bunch of free items to
01:58 - the menu we could set a default
02:00 - constraint where if we don't explicitly
02:03 - set a price the price will default to be
02:06 - zero it will be free so I'm going to
02:08 - undo everything that we just did
02:11 - delete from products
02:15 - where product ID is greater than or
02:19 - equal to 104.
02:22 - and then we can execute that statement
02:26 - if we were recreating this table with
02:28 - the default constraint we would type
02:30 - create table the name of the table
02:33 - products in this case
02:35 - add our columns we have a product ID
02:40 - the data type is integer
02:43 - we have a product
02:45 - name
02:47 - the data type is VAR Char and I forgot
02:49 - what the size was
02:51 - looks like 25.
02:55 - than a price
02:58 - which is a decimal
03:00 - Max digit size of four Precision of two
03:03 - now let's use the default constraint
03:05 - after the column you would like to add
03:07 - that constraint to type default then
03:10 - some value I will set the default value
03:13 - to be zero dollars and zero cents or you
03:15 - could just say zero too that'd be fine
03:17 - you would just add this constraint when
03:19 - creating a new table however I do
03:21 - already have a products table so this
03:23 - technically wouldn't work because that
03:25 - table already exists now to alter a
03:28 - table to include that constraint you
03:30 - would instead type alter table the name
03:33 - of the table
03:36 - alter the name of the column price
03:39 - set
03:40 - default constraint then the value so
03:43 - zero
03:46 - and that appears to have worked let's
03:48 - select our products table select all
03:50 - from
03:51 - products
03:54 - then we will insert some new rows
03:58 - insert
03:59 - into
04:01 - products
04:04 - than our values
04:06 - so we had four rows
04:14 - 104.
04:16 - that was a straw
04:19 - 105 was a napkin
04:24 - 106.
04:26 - was a fork
04:29 - 107.
04:31 - is a spoon then finished the statement
04:34 - with a semicolon so since we set that
04:37 - default constraint we don't need to
04:38 - explicitly list the price but we are
04:41 - missing one thing though
04:42 - when I execute this statement the column
04:45 - count doesn't match
04:47 - so when we insert into products
04:49 - we will list what we're inserting
04:51 - explicitly the product ID
04:54 - and the product name after our table
04:56 - name within parentheses type
04:59 - product ID then product name now this
05:04 - should work
05:06 - yeah and here's our products table with
05:08 - our four inserts all of the prices were
05:11 - set to zero and we did not need to
05:13 - explicitly state that this time if you
05:16 - don't specify a value you'll use
05:18 - whatever the default is
05:19 - here's another example I think you'll
05:21 - like this one let's say we have a table
05:23 - of transactions after inserting a new
05:25 - transaction we will insert a timestamp
05:28 - of when that transaction took place and
05:30 - that time stamp will be the default
05:32 - create table transactions
05:37 - at the end of this topic we will delete
05:39 - this table so don't get too attached to
05:41 - it
05:42 - we will have three columns
05:45 - transaction
05:47 - ID which will be of the data type
05:50 - integer
05:51 - a transaction amount let's just say
05:53 - amount
05:55 - the data type will be decimal
05:58 - five digits Precision of two is good
06:02 - then a transaction
06:05 - date
06:06 - the data type will be date actually
06:09 - let's make this date time I'd like to
06:11 - include the time of when this
06:12 - transaction happened now for the default
06:15 - constraint after the date time let's add
06:17 - default then the Now function we don't
06:21 - need to explicitly add the date and time
06:23 - that will be done automatically which is
06:26 - kind of cool
06:27 - so I'm going to create this table
06:31 - let's select all from transactions
06:36 - if we're going to insert some values
06:38 - we'll need at least a transaction ID and
06:40 - amount the transaction date will be
06:42 - included automatically
06:45 - so let's insert
06:47 - into
06:49 - transactions
06:52 - some values let's do one at a time
06:55 - the first transaction of the day will
06:57 - have a transaction ID of 1 I suppose a
07:00 - customer came in and bought a hamburger
07:02 - and a soda for a total of 4.99
07:05 - then we do need to list the transaction
07:08 - ID then the amount
07:10 - after our table name add transaction ID
07:15 - then amount
07:17 - so let's run this
07:19 - yeah cool so there's our transaction ID
07:21 - this was order number one the total
07:24 - amount was 4.99 and we do have a time
07:27 - stamp of when this transaction occurred
07:30 - so the second order of the day
07:32 - will be for a total of 2.89 and that
07:36 - happened at this time then the third
07:38 - order of the day
07:40 - will have a total price of eight dollars
07:43 - 37 cents
07:45 - yep there we are so we don't need this
07:48 - table anymore I'm going to drop table
07:51 - transactions we will recreate this table
07:54 - in the future but I'd rather start fresh
07:57 - all right everybody that is the default
07:59 - constraint when you create a table or
08:02 - alter a table you can set a default
08:04 - value of some value you specify then
08:07 - whenever you insert a row that value
08:09 - will be included automatically which is
08:12 - pretty useful but yeah that is the
08:14 - default constraint in MySQL
