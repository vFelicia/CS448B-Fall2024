00:02 - hey everybody so in this video i'm going
00:03 - to show you how we can create an array
00:05 - of structs let's say we're working with
00:07 - students and we need to print each
00:09 - student's name and gpa so let's create a
00:12 - struct outside of our main function type
00:15 - struct and then a tag name for the
00:17 - struct let's say student so each student
00:20 - will have a name and a gpa
00:22 - so let's create a character array named
00:25 - name i'll set a maximum size of maybe 12
00:27 - characters
00:29 - and a gpa that could be a float
00:32 - so float gpa now let's initialize some
00:35 - structs we type struct followed by the
00:38 - tag name and then some variable name to
00:40 - identify each struct so let's say we
00:42 - will have four students overall and i'll
00:44 - go ahead and assign some values right
00:46 - away when we initialize this struct so
00:49 - we need a name and a gpa so the first
00:51 - student let's say is spongebob
00:54 - and spongebob has a gpa of 3.0 so we can
00:58 - copy this and create a few more students
01:01 - so student one student two
01:03 - student three and student four
01:06 - next we have patrick
01:08 - patrick has a 2.5
01:11 - then sandy sandy is smart so she has a
01:14 - 4.0 and squidward
01:18 - squidward has a 2.0 so we have four
01:21 - students now we will create an array so
01:24 - the data type of our array what it's
01:25 - containing will be structs it will be
01:28 - struct student it's kind of like the
01:30 - data type so with an array you have to
01:32 - declare what you're going to be putting
01:33 - within the array struct students and
01:36 - then we need an array name so this will
01:38 - be students and then specify a maximum
01:41 - size if you need one but i'm just going
01:43 - to initialize this array with some
01:45 - students so let's add student one
01:48 - student two
01:51 - student three
01:52 - and a student four and there we go we
01:55 - have an array of structs
01:57 - now if i would like to display each
01:59 - student's name i can use a for loop to
02:01 - loop through our array
02:03 - so for
02:05 - curly braces we will create an index
02:07 - into i set this equal to zero
02:10 - we will loop through this as long as i
02:12 - is less than and then we need to
02:14 - calculate how many elements are within
02:16 - our array so we have four elements but
02:18 - we can do that by using the size of
02:20 - operator pass in our array and then
02:23 - divide this by the size of one of these
02:25 - elements
02:27 - size of students and then pick maybe the
02:29 - first element of zero after each
02:31 - iteration we will increment i by one so
02:34 - then within our for loop let's print
02:36 - each student's name
02:38 - so let's use the s format specifier to
02:41 - display a string and we will display our
02:44 - array at index of i
02:47 - whatever our counter is
02:49 - and we will use the member axis operator
02:52 - of dot so follow students at index of i
02:55 - with a dot then we have access to a name
02:58 - and a gpa so let's display each
03:00 - student's name and then i'll add a new
03:02 - line after each printf statement
03:05 - so there we go we have spongebob patrick
03:07 - sandy and squidward now let's display
03:10 - each student's gpa so let's copy this
03:12 - line
03:13 - we are displaying a float so the format
03:16 - specifier for afloat is f
03:18 - students at index of i
03:21 - dot gpa
03:23 - then i'll get rid of that new line
03:24 - character and let's take a look to see
03:26 - what we have
03:27 - okay we can see each student's name and
03:29 - gpa but we may want to format this
03:32 - so after each student's name i'll add a
03:34 - tab and i'll allocate maybe 12
03:37 - characters to display each student's
03:39 - name and then left justify it and then
03:42 - with our gpa let's display two digits
03:44 - after the decimal so i will add
03:46 - dot two
03:48 - so this should look better yeah that's
03:50 - much more organized so we have spongebob
03:52 - with the gpa of 3.0 patrick with 2.5
03:56 - sandy with 4.0 and squidward with a 2.0
04:00 - so yeah that's how to create an array of
04:02 - structs if you would like a copy of this
04:04 - code i'll post this to the comments
04:05 - section down below and well yeah that's
04:07 - how to create an array of structs in c
