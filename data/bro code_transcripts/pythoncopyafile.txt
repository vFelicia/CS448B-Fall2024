00:04 - copying files in python so
00:06 - sit back relax and enjoy the show

00:16 - help keep this channel running
00:18 - welcome back to another video regarding
00:20 - doing stuff with files using python and
00:22 - in this video we're going to be
00:24 - copying some files and in order to do so
00:26 - i recommend
00:27 - importing the shuttle module there's
00:29 - other ways of doing this too
00:31 - but i tend to like using the shuttle
00:33 - module now with this module
00:35 - there are three basic functions to copy
00:38 - a file
00:39 - starting at the top they are copy file
00:42 - copy
00:42 - and copy too so copy file is what we'll
00:45 - be working with
00:46 - this will copy the contents of a file
00:49 - copy
00:49 - will do everything that copy file does
00:52 - plus copy
00:53 - the permissions mode and the destination
00:56 - can be a directory
00:57 - and lastly copy 2 this will do
00:59 - everything
01:00 - that copy does plus it copies the
01:02 - metadata of that file
01:04 - including the files creation and
01:06 - modification times
01:07 - so depending on the project or the
01:09 - program you're working with
01:11 - you may need to use copy or copy too but
01:13 - in this video we're going to be using
01:15 - copy file just to copy the contents of a
01:18 - file
01:18 - now after you import the shuttle module
01:21 - this is all you need to do to copy a
01:22 - file
01:23 - shuttle dot then use the appropriate
01:26 - function that you need to copy your file
01:28 - we're going to be using copy file copy
01:32 - file and within this function there are
01:34 - two arguments
01:35 - a source and a destination so within my
01:38 - project folder i have
01:40 - a plain text file called test test.txt
01:44 - all this says is yo this is some text
01:47 - see ya what i would like to do is copy
01:49 - this file because it's cool
01:50 - now since this file is within my project
01:53 - folder i only have to list the file name
01:56 - otherwise if this is someplace else i
01:58 - would list the file path here
02:00 - so this file is test.txt
02:03 - this is the source file and now i need a
02:06 - destination so
02:08 - the second argument will be separated
02:10 - with the comma i'm going to list
02:11 - a destination so you can actually rename
02:14 - this to
02:15 - i would like to name this as copy.txt
02:18 - so the destination is my project folder
02:21 - so when i create a copy of this file
02:24 - test.txt
02:25 - this copy will appear in my project
02:27 - folder and say the same thing
02:28 - so after running this we now have a
02:32 - file named copy.txt that says the same
02:34 - thing
02:35 - as my test file and remember what i said
02:37 - you can copy
02:39 - this file to a different location on
02:41 - your computer so you could list
02:42 - the file path so this file path would go
02:45 - to my desktop
02:46 - and then when i run this this will copy
02:48 - my original file my source
02:50 - and then copy it to wherever my
02:52 - destination is
02:53 - oh and i almost forgot so if you need to
02:55 - use copy or copy 2
02:57 - the arguments are exactly the same so if
02:59 - you needed to use
03:00 - copy this would be a shuttle dot copy
03:03 - instead of copy file
03:04 - then copy two is shuttle dot copy two
03:08 - the arguments are exactly the same but
03:10 - each of these functions will copy it
03:12 - different things depending on what you
03:13 - need
03:14 - for your own program or project all
03:16 - right everybody so that's the basics
03:18 - of copying files and python i will post
03:20 - this in the comment section down below
03:22 - but yeah that is how to copy files using
03:25 - python
