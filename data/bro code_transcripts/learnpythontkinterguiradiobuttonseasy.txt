00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well and in
00:02 - this video i'm going to be teaching you
00:04 - guys how we can create
00:05 - radio buttons in python so sit back
00:07 - relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:12 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:16 - help keep this channel running
00:18 - okay everybody let's create some radio
00:20 - buttons now these are similar to check
00:22 - boxes but you can only select one from
00:25 - any single grouping
00:26 - so let's pretend that i'm buying you
00:28 - lunch and you can only select
00:30 - one item from a menu you can select
00:32 - either a
00:33 - slice of pizza a hamburger or a hot dog
00:36 - so let's begin by creating a list i will
00:38 - call this list
00:39 - food food equals
00:43 - pizza hamburger
00:48 - hot dog and let's create a window
00:51 - window equals tk followed by
00:55 - window dot main loop
00:59 - so to create a radio button we'll need a
01:00 - name so i'll call this radio button
01:03 - radio button equals radio button
01:07 - and we're going to be adding this to our
01:09 - window and we're going to put this
01:11 - within
01:12 - a for loop so we're going to iterate
01:14 - through all of the items within our list
01:17 - so let's create a for loop so we'll save
01:19 - for
01:21 - index in range
01:26 - length of food
01:29 - so this is going to iterate once through
01:32 - all of the elements within our list
01:34 - so when we run this it's going to create
01:37 - three
01:38 - radio buttons for us because we're
01:40 - instantiating
01:41 - one radio button for each item in the
01:43 - list
01:44 - now what i'm going to do is set the text
01:48 - equal to
01:51 - our list of food at a certain index
01:54 - so when we first run this for loop it's
01:57 - going to be zero for the index
01:59 - then one and then two and then so on and
02:02 - so forth
02:03 - for each item within our list and then
02:06 - we just need to pack this
02:08 - so radio button dot
02:11 - pack and then let's take a look at this
02:16 - alright so here are all of the radio
02:18 - buttons that we have
02:20 - currently they're all selected though so
02:22 - we'll need to link these within a single
02:24 - grouping
02:25 - the next thing we'll add is a variable
02:27 - and we'll set this equal to
02:28 - x and we'll need to declare this after
02:31 - we create an instance of our window
02:33 - so x equals int var
02:36 - so this will hold an integer object
02:39 - so these are all within the same
02:42 - grouping
02:42 - however if we try to run this again and
02:45 - select one of these options
02:47 - they all become selected so we're going
02:49 - to need to give
02:50 - each of these individual radio buttons
02:52 - their own
02:53 - value because right now they're all
02:55 - sharing the same value
02:57 - so we can add value equals
03:00 - whatever the index is currently so the
03:03 - first
03:04 - item within our list of food is going to
03:06 - have an
03:07 - index value of zero then one
03:10 - then two so let's try that again and you
03:13 - can see by default it's
03:15 - zero so pizza is already selected then
03:17 - we can select either hamburger or hot
03:19 - dog
03:20 - but we can only select one so that's
03:22 - kind of what we want then
03:24 - so do you guys usually know how i call
03:26 - the config function after each change
03:28 - that i make for an object
03:30 - well that's because i like to add
03:31 - comments just for teaching purposes
03:33 - for what each change does however it
03:36 - might be easier for you instead of
03:38 - calling the config function a bunch of
03:39 - times
03:40 - just to list all of the changes within
03:43 - the parentheses when you create an
03:44 - instance of the object that you're
03:46 - working with
03:47 - however just for teaching purposes i'm
03:49 - going to put this all within
03:51 - separate lines that allows me to add
03:53 - some comments
03:54 - so i think i'm going to start doing that
03:56 - from now on
03:57 - so what this does is that this adds text
04:00 - to radio buttons
04:04 - and this groups radio buttons
04:08 - together if they share
04:11 - the same variable
04:15 - so if you wanted a completely different
04:17 - grouping of radio buttons you can give
04:19 - them a different variable
04:21 - like y and what this line does
04:24 - is that this assigns
04:27 - each radio button a
04:32 - different value
04:37 - all right so let's make some cosmetic
04:39 - changes to our radio buttons so right
04:42 - now
04:43 - they are centered let's anchor these to
04:45 - the west
04:46 - so we'll place this within the pack
04:48 - function so
04:50 - anchor equals w alternatively you can
04:54 - just say capital w without
04:56 - the quotes this would also work too
04:59 - so now they're all lined up let's add
05:01 - some padding
05:03 - so i'm going to add pad x
05:06 - and i'll set this to 25
05:09 - and this adds
05:12 - padding on x
05:16 - axis
05:19 - let's also change the font
05:23 - so we'll say font
05:27 - equals maybe i'll pick impact for a font
05:30 - style
05:31 - and set the font size to 50.
05:36 - and now we can actually read these
05:37 - because the font is large enough
05:40 - now let's add some images so let's
05:42 - create some photo images
05:44 - you'll want to be sure to create these
05:46 - after you create your instance of your
05:48 - window
05:49 - so let's create a pizza image first
05:52 - pizza image
05:53 - equals photo image
05:57 - file equals the file path or the file
06:00 - name
06:01 - and my file is pizza.png and it kind of
06:04 - looks like this
06:05 - it's just the pizza emoji so
06:08 - pizza dot png
06:11 - and then i'll do the same thing for
06:13 - hamburger and hot dog
06:16 - so this will be hamburger image
06:20 - file equals hamburger.png
06:24 - and then hotdog image
06:34 - and this is what the other emojis look
06:37 - like
06:39 - and then let's create a list of the
06:42 - photo images that we have
06:43 - i'll call this food images
06:46 - equals then the names of these images
06:51 - pizza image hamburger image
06:56 - and hot dog image
07:00 - so then we can set the image for each
07:02 - radio button
07:04 - image equals
07:07 - the name of the list food images
07:10 - followed by
07:11 - the index that we're currently on within
07:14 - our for loop
07:16 - so this adds image
07:19 - to radio button and
07:22 - let's test this cool here's our images
07:27 - now if you want some images as well as
07:29 - text you'll have to use compound
07:32 - so let's add that next so i'm just going
07:35 - to add a comma
07:36 - followed by compound
07:42 - equals let's say left so this will add
07:46 - the image
07:47 - to the left of the text
07:52 - adds image and text i'll just say left
07:56 - side
07:58 - so this will display both an image and
08:01 - text
08:03 - so with these radio buttons you can
08:05 - eliminate these
08:06 - circle indicators and there's actually a
08:09 - way to do that
08:10 - so what we'll add if you want to get rid
08:13 - of those
08:14 - is indicator
08:17 - on equals zero
08:20 - so this will i should say eliminate
08:27 - circle indicators
08:31 - so it's going to change these to these
08:33 - push buttons
08:34 - however they are going to be of uneven
08:37 - size you can set the width
08:39 - if you want to so we'll do that
08:42 - so we'll say width equals
08:46 - what about 75 i'm not sure if that's a
08:49 - good size or not
08:52 - okay that's way too small let's try 375.
08:58 - so yeah you can have some push buttons
09:00 - if you want to if you don't like the
09:01 - circle indicators
09:03 - so this sets width
09:07 - of radio buttons
09:10 - now let's actually set a function to
09:13 - uh be called when we click one of these
09:16 - buttons
09:17 - so let's call this function maybe order
09:19 - like we're ordering one of these items
09:23 - so d e f we'll call this order like
09:26 - we're ordering something
09:29 - and what we'll do is just a few if
09:30 - statements because i'm feeling lazy
09:33 - so we'll just say if x that's
09:36 - the value that's going to be stored
09:39 - because each of these radio buttons is
09:42 - grouped together by the variable x
09:45 - if x dot get
09:48 - is equal to zero that's our first index
09:51 - for pizza what we'll display is
09:56 - print you
10:00 - oops you ordered
10:04 - pizza then we'll just add
10:07 - else if x dot get
10:12 - is equal to one we will print
10:17 - you ordered a hamburger
10:25 - and then else if two
10:30 - you ordered a hot dog
10:36 - else
10:40 - print huh
10:44 - so there's probably a more efficient way
10:46 - to write this however i was just feeling
10:48 - lazy and this is probably the best way
10:50 - to keep this simple and easy to
10:52 - understand
10:53 - so let's try this now oh however we need
10:55 - to set the command
10:57 - for our radio buttons so
11:00 - command equals then the
11:03 - function name which is order and make
11:06 - sure you do not add the parentheses
11:09 - so don't do this do that
11:12 - and this will set
11:15 - command of
11:18 - radio button to function
11:24 - all right let's test this so if we click
11:27 - on pizza it says you ordered pizza
11:30 - you ordered a hamburger and you ordered
11:32 - a hot dog
11:34 - okay everybody so that's the basics of
11:36 - radio buttons if you would like a copy
11:38 - of all this code i'll post all of this
11:40 - in the comments down below
11:41 - but yeah that's the basics of radio
11:43 - buttons in python
11:46 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
11:49 - learn something new
11:50 - then you can help me help you in three
11:53 - easy steps
11:54 - by smashing that like button drop a
