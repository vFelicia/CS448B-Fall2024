00:00 - what's up people so today I got to
00:01 - explain Constructors in JavaScript a
00:04 - Constructor is a special method for
00:06 - defining the properties and methods of
00:09 - objects in Prior videos we've
00:11 - constructed objects like this we would
00:13 - declare an object assign it some
00:15 - properties and some methods you know
00:17 - this works but what if we have to create
00:19 - a lot of objects here I'm manually
00:21 - creating three different car objects
00:23 - that can be a lot of work what we could
00:25 - do instead is use a Constructor to
00:28 - construct these objects automatically Al
00:30 - all we have to do to construct these
00:32 - objects is pass in some unique data to
00:34 - the Constructor to construct these
00:36 - objects here's an example we are going
00:38 - to create a function
00:41 - car do pay attention to the
00:45 - capitalization we'll need to set up some
00:47 - parameters what sorts of properties will
00:49 - we accept when we construct a car object
00:52 - how about a make model year and
00:57 - color these are arguments we'll receive
00:59 - when we construct a car object to assign
01:02 - these properties we're going to use the
01:04 - this keyword doake equals the make that
01:09 - we
01:09 - receive let's do this with model this do
01:13 - model equals the model we
01:16 - receive this doe equals year this do
01:22 - color equals color that's good enough
01:25 - for now our car Constructor is a
01:28 - reusable method where we can define the
01:30 - properties and methods of objects we
01:32 - create to use this Constructor I will
01:34 - create an instance of an
01:36 - object I will use const car one will be
01:39 - our first object equals we'll need to
01:42 - use the new keyword type the name of the
01:45 - Constructor car car is a special method
01:48 - we'll need to pass in some arguments
01:50 - we'll need a make model year and color
01:53 - in that order my first car feel free to
01:56 - send some different data to the
01:57 - Constructor but for me my first car will
01:59 - be be a
02:01 - Ford make sure each value is comma
02:04 - separated Mustang the year will be
02:08 - 2024 and the color will be
02:11 - red we should now have a car object with
02:14 - the name of car 1 and I'm going to
02:18 - console.log car 1's properties car 1.
02:22 - make Ford let's do this with the other
02:25 - properties we have
02:26 - model
02:28 - Mustang
02:31 - year
02:34 - 2024 and color red now this method is
02:39 - reusable we can reuse it to create other
02:41 - car
02:42 - objects let's create const Car 2 equals
02:48 - new car we'll pass in different data
02:50 - this time the make will be chevr
02:55 - a I will pick a
02:58 - Camaro the year
03:00 - 2025 and the color will be blue now I
03:04 - can display car 2's
03:06 - properties let's Select Car 2. make car
03:09 - 2. model car 2. year car
03:11 - 2.cor we have a Chevy Camaro year 2025
03:15 - the color is blue let's create one more
03:18 - car same process as before const car 3
03:23 - equals new
03:26 - car I'll go with a Dodge
03:30 - charger the year
03:33 - 2026 and the color will be
03:37 - silver let's access car 3's properties
03:40 - car 3. make car 3. model car 3. year car
03:44 - 3.or Dodge Charger 2026 the color is
03:48 - silver another thing with these
03:49 - parameters too you can name these
03:51 - parameters anything when we assign these
03:53 - properties it can be kind of confusing
03:56 - like this. make equals make really we
03:58 - write our Constructors this way just for
04:00 - readability technically this would work
04:02 - if we renamed our parameters for example
04:04 - make will be parameter a model will be B
04:07 - year is C color is D then be sure to
04:10 - change these when we assign them A B C D
04:16 - this would still work however this
04:18 - Constructor isn't as readable like what
04:20 - the heck is a b c and d it would be good
04:23 - practice to clearly Define our
04:25 - parameters for readability purposes all
04:28 - right now let's add a method
04:30 - we'll take this.
04:33 - Drive equals a
04:39 - function we
04:42 - console.log I'll use a template string
04:46 - you drive the I'll add a
04:49 - placeholder
04:51 - this.
04:53 - model with Cars 1 through three let's
04:56 - use the drive method car 1. drive
05:01 - you drive the
05:04 - Mustang car 2. drive you drive the
05:07 - Camaro and K 3.
05:10 - drive you drive the charger all right
05:13 - everybody so that's a Constructor it's a
05:15 - special method for defining the
05:17 - properties and methods of objects it
05:19 - helps with code reusability we can reuse
05:21 - it to create many objects instead of
05:23 - having to type them all out manually and
05:25 - well everybody those are Constructors in
05:28 - JavaScript
