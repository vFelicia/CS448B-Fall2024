00:00 - hey it's you bro hope you're doing well
00:02 - and in this video we're going to be
00:03 - discussing backgrounds in css
00:05 - so let's get into it
00:08 - so before we begin this video if you
00:10 - want to follow along just find a
00:12 - background image that you like and
00:14 - download it and for now
00:15 - put it in the same folder that contains
00:17 - your index html file
00:19 - and your style sheet so let's begin now
00:22 - we're going to be discussing how to add
00:24 - a
00:24 - background to your website this can be
00:27 - a background color or an image so to
00:30 - kick this off
00:31 - let's create a simple h1 header so
00:35 - h1 let's add some text perhaps
00:37 - background
00:38 - demo and then close this let's save
00:41 - reload and we just have some text
00:44 - now we're going to mostly be working on
00:46 - our style sheet
00:47 - now if you want to target the background
00:50 - of your website you can simply just
00:53 - target this
00:54 - body element however there's a better
00:57 - option than targeting the body
00:59 - and that's actually targeting the html
01:02 - element
01:03 - because that will pretty much cover
01:05 - everything so
01:06 - you can see here that pretty much
01:08 - everything is within the html tags
01:10 - so we're going to target this html tag
01:13 - for our style sheet
01:14 - now if you want to change the background
01:16 - color we've covered this already
01:18 - you just type in background color
01:21 - and this is a property and we can set
01:23 - this to a color
01:24 - like maybe green save reload the page
01:28 - oh there you go that's it lesson over
01:30 - just kidding and for colors you can also
01:32 - use
01:32 - an rgb value which is red green than
01:36 - blue
01:36 - just type in rgb then a set of
01:38 - parenthesis and there's
01:40 - three values that you can place within
01:41 - the parentheses here it's a number
01:43 - between
01:44 - 0 and 255 and depending on what value
01:47 - you place for each of these different
01:49 - positions
01:50 - this will add varying amounts of red
01:52 - green and blue
01:53 - so i'm just going to type in some random
01:55 - numbers i have no idea what this color
01:57 - is but
01:58 - we'll see what it is so i just made up
02:00 - the numbers 100
02:01 - 255 and 75 let's save reload the page
02:04 - and that's like a bright
02:06 - green lime color which is kind of
02:08 - interesting
02:09 - otherwise you can use hexadecimal values
02:12 - so
02:12 - you need a number symbol then you can
02:15 - type in a series of
02:17 - six digits like all zeros would be all
02:20 - black then
02:21 - all f's would be all white
02:24 - and you can look online for some
02:26 - hexadecimal values if there's anything
02:28 - you like
02:28 - let's talk about gradients a gradient is
02:31 - a gradual
02:32 - change from one color to another that's
02:35 - the best way i can explain it
02:36 - let's say that on our website we want
02:38 - the background color
02:40 - to start at one color and then by the
02:43 - end of the document
02:44 - it will become another color and it's
02:46 - going to gradually change colors kind of
02:48 - like a sunset
02:49 - you know how there's varying colors
02:51 - that's kind of what a gradient is
02:52 - it's just a gradual change in colors
02:55 - so this is what we can do to create a
02:57 - gradient effect
02:59 - type in background we'll use the
03:01 - background property
03:02 - linear dash gradient
03:06 - then a set of parenthesis let's start
03:08 - with two different colors
03:09 - we want a gradual shift from one color
03:12 - to another for our background
03:14 - let's say we want maybe gray and we want
03:17 - this to transition to
03:19 - black and you can use either rgb values
03:22 - or hexadecimal values here i'm just
03:24 - going with the words gray and black just
03:25 - because it's simple for this video
03:27 - so let's save reload all right so we're
03:31 - starting to get somewhere
03:32 - so what's going on here is that our
03:34 - background gradient
03:36 - is only extending as far down as we have
03:38 - substance on our website basically
03:41 - since we only have an h1 header tag the
03:44 - gradient is only going down so far
03:46 - if i were to add let's say a paragraph
03:49 - to this so
03:50 - if you're using sublime text you can
03:51 - just type in lorem and hit tab
03:53 - and save this well the gradient now
03:56 - extends
03:56 - for as much as we have text for other
03:59 - items
04:00 - on our website and then it will repeat
04:01 - itself every so often
04:03 - but if you want your gradient to extend
04:06 - to the entire
04:07 - window size these are the steps to do
04:10 - that so the first thing that we're going
04:11 - to do
04:12 - is that we're going to prevent our web
04:14 - browser from repeating
04:16 - this gradient every so often depending
04:19 - on
04:19 - how much text you have or other items on
04:22 - your website
04:22 - so background dash repeat
04:26 - then we'll set this to no repeat
04:30 - so this doesn't repeat anymore but we
04:32 - have all of this blank
04:33 - white space underneath all of the items
04:36 - on our website
04:37 - so there's a few other steps we're going
04:39 - to set the
04:40 - background dash position
04:44 - and we will center this this isn't
04:46 - really going to be noticeable
04:48 - quite yet but when we include background
04:50 - images it's going to be more noticeable
04:52 - so
04:53 - no apparent changes yet we will set the
04:57 - background dash size to
05:00 - cover again no noticeable changes
05:04 - and lastly we're going to set the
05:06 - background
05:07 - dash attachment
05:11 - to fixed and what this does is that
05:15 - it this determines if the background
05:17 - will scroll with the rest of the page
05:19 - or if it's fixed in place so when you
05:21 - combine all of these together
05:23 - all these properties what you get is
05:25 - that the gradient
05:26 - or your background image will extend to
05:28 - the full length of your browser window
05:31 - and if you were to resize this window
05:33 - it's actually going to
05:34 - expand naturally so that's what a lot of
05:37 - people tend to want they want their
05:38 - background
05:39 - image or color to extend to the full
05:41 - length of the browser window
05:44 - now if you would like to set an image as
05:46 - your background
05:47 - these are the steps so for now i'm going
05:49 - to comment
05:50 - out everything that we did here and
05:52 - we'll just use this as a reference and
05:54 - we'll start fresh
05:55 - so the first thing that we're going to
05:57 - do is that we're going to include a
05:58 - background image
06:00 - so background dash image
06:03 - colon url a set of parentheses
06:07 - now there's two things we can type in
06:09 - here either the file name
06:11 - if it's within the same folder for this
06:13 - example for me i put this in the same
06:15 - folder but
06:16 - in just a moment i'll show you where you
06:18 - can locate a
06:19 - image that's in a different location or
06:22 - a different folder
06:23 - so type in the name of the image here so
06:27 - i picked a file that was named space
06:30 - underscore
06:31 - small dot png
06:34 - let's save this reload the page all
06:36 - right here's my background
06:37 - but i'm going to change the font color
06:39 - because i can no longer read it and i'm
06:41 - just going to set that to
06:42 - white so one thing you might see is that
06:46 - with
06:46 - images for a web page all the images
06:48 - might be in a separate folder
06:50 - so we'll need to add the file path for
06:53 - where we can locate
06:54 - our background images so let's create a
06:56 - new folder so new
06:58 - folder and i will call this images and
07:00 - we're going to take our background
07:02 - in my case i have two uh here because
07:04 - i'm going to show you another example
07:06 - and we'll place it within a folder
07:08 - called images
07:10 - so now if we were to reload this page we
07:12 - can no longer
07:13 - locate this file so we'll actually have
07:15 - to add that folder here
07:17 - so we're going to type images or
07:19 - whatever else you named
07:20 - your folder then forward slash then the
07:23 - name of the file
07:24 - so if we were to reload this we can now
07:26 - see our background
07:28 - but for this example i'm just going to
07:30 - put everything back within the same
07:31 - folder as it was originally
07:33 - so let's expand this window all right so
07:36 - what's going on here is that
07:38 - this portion right here is the
07:40 - background image
07:41 - but it seems like it's repeating itself
07:44 - to fill in the entire
07:45 - width and height of your web browser too
07:48 - so what i would like to do
07:49 - is that i want to take this background
07:51 - image and have it extend
07:53 - to the full size of my browser window
07:56 - so it's going to be the same steps as
07:58 - before then the same that we did with
08:00 - the linear gradient
08:01 - the first thing that we're going to type
08:03 - is background
08:04 - dash repeat so i'm going to just place
08:07 - that here
08:08 - let's save reload the page so this is
08:11 - the
08:11 - original image that we have for our
08:13 - background
08:14 - and it's not repeating anymore but we
08:16 - still want this to take up the entire
08:18 - size of our browser window so the next
08:21 - thing we're going to do
08:22 - is set the background position to center
08:27 - alright so now this image is in the
08:31 - middle of our webpage
08:35 - we want this background size
08:38 - to be set to cover
08:41 - so now this background image covers the
08:44 - full width of the web browser however we
08:47 - still have this white space underneath
08:49 - it and then lastly we're going to set
08:51 - the background attachment
08:53 - to fixed and this determines if the
08:56 - background will scroll with the rest
08:58 - of the page or if it's fixed in place
09:01 - so when you combine all of these
09:03 - properties together what you end up with
09:05 - is a background image that takes up the
09:08 - entire
09:09 - size of your browser window which again
09:11 - is what people
09:12 - tend to want instead of just their
09:14 - background image only taking up
09:15 - like a certain portion of this window
09:18 - and with this background image
09:20 - the more you zoom in or the larger the
09:23 - window size
09:24 - the image itself will begin to lose some
09:25 - quality so you're better with using
09:28 - high resolution pictures but for this
09:30 - example i had a
09:32 - small version of the background image i
09:34 - wanted to use i'm going to switch this
09:36 - to a better larger resolution picture
09:39 - that i had
09:40 - and the file that i had was space
09:42 - underscore big
09:43 - so now the resolution of the picture is
09:45 - slightly better
09:46 - but you also have to be concerned with
09:48 - how large the image is
09:50 - that you want to use for a background
09:51 - because that might increase
09:53 - the low time for somebody viewing your
09:55 - page then
09:56 - so that's something to keep in mind but
09:58 - higher resolution pictures tend to be
10:00 - better if you're using it as a
10:02 - background image
10:03 - so that's the basics of adding a
10:04 - background color gradient or image to
10:07 - your web page as a whole
10:09 - now you can also add a background to
10:11 - specific html elements
10:13 - let's say that we want to change the
10:14 - background of our h1 header tag which we
10:17 - have at the top
10:18 - so we'll add that to our style sheet h1
10:20 - set of curly brackets
10:22 - let's add a linear gradient for the
10:24 - background
10:25 - so we'll type in background
10:28 - linear gradient
10:32 - parentheses and then we can type in the
10:34 - colors we want within the parentheses
10:36 - now you can have more than two before we
10:38 - just had gray and black
10:39 - we can add more colors let's say we want
10:42 - like a sunrise or a sunset effect
10:44 - we can type in red then orange and then
10:48 - yellow so let's see what this looks like
10:51 - that's pretty sweet
10:52 - but why stop there though we can make
10:54 - this a whole rainbow if we really wanted
10:56 - to
10:56 - so let's add a few other colors maybe
10:58 - green
11:00 - blue indigo
11:03 - and violet
11:06 - sweet that's a pretty cool looking
11:08 - rainbow it kind of reminds me of that
11:10 - meme i think it was called nion cat yeah
11:13 - this is it this is what this reminds me
11:15 - of
11:16 - assuming most people wouldn't want a
11:18 - rainbow background but
11:20 - for this tutorial series i'm going to
11:22 - include this because well it's my
11:23 - tutorial series and i can do what i want
11:25 - so now how about we change the
11:27 - background color of this paragraph that
11:29 - we have so let's go back to our html
11:31 - file and i need to surround our
11:33 - paragraph
11:34 - with a set of p tags and i'm assuming
11:36 - you probably do as well
11:37 - so make sure you include those we're
11:39 - going to list
11:41 - the p element as our target and let's
11:44 - change the
11:45 - background perhaps we'll use another
11:48 - linear gradient because there's a few
11:49 - other tricks that we can do too
11:51 - perhaps we will use the boring gray and
11:53 - black that we had previously so our
11:56 - gradient only targets
11:57 - this specific paragraph another trick
11:59 - with linear gradients
12:00 - is that you can have the colors flow in
12:02 - a different direction by default it
12:04 - starts at the top and the color
12:07 - eventually transitions
12:08 - to its second color when it reaches the
12:10 - bottom so you can actually change that
12:12 - direction
12:13 - like we can have gray start on the left
12:16 - and when it reaches the right
12:17 - it'll become our second color so within
12:20 - the parentheses we're going to type
12:21 - two right comma and now
12:25 - our first color is on the left and it
12:26 - eventually transitions to our second
12:28 - color
12:29 - on the right otherwise there's two top
12:34 - so it's kind of like these positions are
12:35 - reversed and
12:37 - two left so use whatever you want for
12:40 - your website
12:41 - i kind of like to write honestly that's
12:44 - pretty sweet
12:45 - here's one thing to consider what if you
12:47 - had a bunch of different paragraphs
12:49 - this is what this might end up looking
12:51 - like so i'm just going to take our
12:52 - current paragraph and just paste this
12:55 - maybe an additional three times so we
12:57 - have four paragraphs
12:59 - so each of these paragraphs has their
13:02 - own
13:02 - what looks like an individual box so if
13:05 - you don't want these
13:06 - basically blank empty spaces between
13:09 - each of these paragraphs
13:11 - what we can do is actually put all these
13:13 - paragraphs within its own container
13:15 - using a div tag
13:16 - so before the first paragraph we're
13:19 - going to begin
13:20 - a new div tag and we'll give this a
13:22 - unique id
13:23 - such as my text
13:27 - name this whatever you want really and
13:29 - then outside of the last paragraph we're
13:32 - going to
13:32 - close this div tag and within our style
13:35 - sheet we can target
13:37 - everything within the specific div tag
13:39 - so if you're targeting something with
13:41 - the unique id
13:42 - you need to put the number sign and the
13:44 - name
13:45 - of the div tag or whatever the name of
13:48 - the id was
13:49 - and i already forgot what it was my text
13:52 - okay
13:52 - so we're just going to type that here so
13:54 - my text set of curly brackets
13:57 - and i'm going to take our linear
13:58 - gradient that we had for our paragraphs
14:01 - and i am going to place it within
14:05 - my text now and we'll reload the page
14:08 - now we got rid of those empty spaces
14:11 - before and after
14:12 - each paragraph and it's all one uniform
14:15 - background basically
14:17 - one pretty unique feature about this is
14:19 - that if you have a scroll bar
14:21 - you'll notice that as we move up and
14:23 - down on our web page
14:24 - you'll notice that the actual background
14:27 - image is staying in place
14:28 - and all of our text is moving as if it
14:30 - was on some sort of track
14:32 - or rollers maybe it's kind of like
14:34 - there's two layers
14:35 - there's a background image and then
14:36 - there's all of our text that's moving
14:38 - so that's kind of cool to see so that's
14:40 - the basics of backgrounds in css
14:42 - if you would like a copy of the markup
14:44 - that we worked on today
14:46 - i'll post this in the comments down
14:47 - below and pin it to the top
14:49 - but yeah that's how you add a background
14:52 - in css
