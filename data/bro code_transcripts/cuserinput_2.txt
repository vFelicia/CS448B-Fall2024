00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:02 - bro hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video i'm going to show you all how we
00:05 - can accept some user input in c sharp
00:07 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - all right here's how we can accept some
00:14 - user input now when we do accept user
00:16 - input
00:17 - it's of the string data type so let's
00:19 - create a variable
00:20 - to hold and store our input let's create
00:23 - a variable
00:24 - named name and we will ask the user for
00:27 - what their name is
00:28 - now to read some user input type console
00:31 - dot
00:32 - read line then parentheses semicolon
00:36 - so when the user types in something then
00:38 - hits enter
00:39 - we will take that user input and store
00:42 - it within this variable name which we
00:44 - can then use for something
00:45 - so within a writeline statement let's
00:47 - use the user's name for something
00:49 - hello plus name and
00:53 - let's take a look okay now to enter in
00:56 - some user input we'll have to type this
00:58 - into the console directly
01:00 - however it is good practice to let the
01:02 - user know what we want them to type in
01:04 - exactly because
01:05 - how's the views are supposed to know
01:07 - that they're supposed to type in their
01:08 - name right here
01:09 - so what we'll do is preceding our
01:11 - readline statement let's create a prompt
01:13 - to tell the user what we want them to
01:14 - type in so within a writeline statement
01:17 - let's say what's your name and then try
01:20 - this again
01:24 - okay what's your name now the user knows
01:26 - that they have to type in their name so
01:28 - type in your first name hit enter hello
01:31 - whatever your first name is
01:32 - okay this time let's accept a user's age
01:36 - and then we'll typecast the user's age
01:38 - into an integer variable
01:40 - so let's copy what we have paste it
01:44 - console.writeline what's your
01:47 - edge and we'll create a new variable of
01:50 - the int data type
01:51 - named age now we'll need to cast this
01:54 - user input into
01:55 - an integer so to do that we would type
01:58 - convert dot 2 and 32
02:02 - parentheses semicolon now take this
02:05 - statement without the semicolon
02:08 - cut it and then paste it within the
02:10 - parentheses so what we're doing
02:12 - is accepting some user input then
02:14 - converting it
02:15 - to an integer that we're storing within
02:17 - this variable edge
02:18 - and then we will display the user's age
02:22 - console.writeline
02:23 - u r plus age plus
02:28 - years old then let's run this again
02:33 - so our program is actually going to wait
02:35 - at each prompt until the user types
02:37 - something in
02:38 - so what's your name bro let's say that
02:40 - i'm 21 i'll hit enter
02:42 - hello bro you are 21 years old
02:45 - now one issue that you may run into is
02:47 - if the user types in something that's
02:49 - non-numeric and we try and convert it
02:52 - so let's try this again what's your name
02:54 - bro
02:55 - and instead of an age what if i type in
02:57 - a word like pizza
02:58 - this will cause an exception an
03:00 - exception will interrupt our program
03:03 - and this specific exception is a format
03:06 - exception input string was not in a
03:08 - correct format
03:09 - so there will be a future video on
03:12 - handling exceptions which will prevent
03:13 - the program
03:14 - from pausing and being interrupted but
03:17 - that's a future video
03:18 - in the meantime we'll just have to be
03:19 - sure that we're entering in the correct
03:21 - user input
03:22 - well okay then everybody that's how to
03:24 - accept some user input in csharp
03:27 - i will post this code to the comments
03:28 - section down below and well
03:30 - yeah that's how to accept user input in
03:32 - c sharp
