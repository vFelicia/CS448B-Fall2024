00:00 - hey what's going on everybody today
00:01 - we'll create a drop down menu only using
00:03 - HTML and CSS so let's get started the
00:07 - first thing we'll create is a div
00:09 - section
00:10 - I will give this div section A Class of
00:14 - drop down
00:16 - then within the stiff section I'll
00:18 - create a button
00:21 - what kind of drop down menu should we
00:23 - create let's create a drop down menu for
00:25 - food
00:27 - then we'll need a div section to hold
00:29 - all of the different content within our
00:31 - drop down menu
00:32 - I will give this inner div section A
00:35 - Class of content
00:40 - within my content class
00:42 - I'll create a few hyperlinks
00:47 - I'll set the href attribute to be
00:50 - nothing but you can put a file path or a
00:53 - URL in here
00:55 - I'll create three elements for our drop
00:57 - down menu
00:59 - the first will be apple
01:02 - Orange
01:03 - then banana
01:06 - this part is a necessary but for my
01:08 - demonstration I'm going to create a
01:10 - paragraph of text
01:12 - I'll type lorem then hit tab that will
01:14 - generate some text
01:16 - alright that is all the markup that we
01:18 - need for this video Let's head to our
01:19 - style sheet
01:21 - the first element I'll apply some CSS
01:23 - properties to is our button with my drop
01:26 - down menu class I will select any
01:28 - buttons
01:30 - I will change the background color
01:33 - to be something else
01:36 - I'll use hsl values
01:40 - I'll go with 80 for the lightness
01:45 - for the font color I'll pick White
01:49 - I'll add a little bit of padding around
01:51 - the text
01:53 - padding
01:54 - 10 pixels by 15 pixels is good
01:58 - I'll remove the Border by setting the
02:00 - Border property to be none
02:03 - then I'll change our cursor to be a
02:05 - pointer when we hover over the button
02:07 - cursor pointer
02:10 - now when I hover over the button
02:12 - my cursor changes to a pointer
02:15 - the next elements that will change are
02:17 - the a elements
02:20 - within my drop down menu class take any
02:23 - ailments then apply these CSS properties
02:27 - let's display all of these items as a
02:30 - block
02:33 - I will set the color to be black
02:36 - I'll remove any text decoration that's
02:39 - the underline basically
02:41 - text decoration none
02:45 - and I will apply a little bit of padding
02:48 - 10 by 15 pixels
02:51 - we have one issue
02:53 - all of the content within my drop down
02:55 - menu is pushing all of the other content
02:58 - on my web page down
03:00 - eventually we'll set the position of our
03:02 - content to be absolute to take it out of
03:05 - the normal flow of our web page
03:07 - with our drop down menus content class
03:14 - let's change the background color first
03:17 - background color I'll use hsl values
03:21 - let's go with 95 lightness
03:28 - I will set the position property to be
03:31 - absolute
03:33 - then I'll set a minimum width for the
03:36 - content
03:39 - I'll stick with 100 pixels
03:43 - but feel free to adjust this value
03:46 - then I'll add a box shadow
03:49 - box shadow
03:51 - the first value is for the horizontal
03:53 - positioning
03:55 - the second number is for the vertical
03:57 - positioning
03:58 - the third value is for the level of blur
04:02 - then select a color
04:05 - to make the shadow a little bit lighter
04:07 - if I'm using hsl values I can adjust the
04:11 - position of this bar and change the
04:13 - opacity
04:15 - let's go with like 80 percent
04:18 - that looks pretty good
04:21 - normally I don't want this content to be
04:22 - displayed unless I hover over our button
04:26 - I will set the display property of our
04:29 - content to be none to hide it
04:32 - when I hover over our button then I'd
04:34 - like to display that content
04:37 - let's take our drop down menu class
04:41 - and apply the hover pseudo class
04:45 - with our content
04:48 - I would like to set the display property
04:51 - to be a block again now when I hover my
04:54 - cursor over the button it displays our
04:56 - drop down menu
04:59 - here's a few extra changes I'm going to
05:01 - make when I hover over the button I'll
05:03 - change the background color of the
05:04 - button
05:05 - with our drop down menu class I'll apply
05:09 - the hover pseudo class take our button
05:12 - within that class then change the
05:15 - background color
05:18 - I'll set the lightness to be like 70.
05:21 - the background color of the button is
05:23 - changing now
05:25 - then lastly when I hover over one of
05:27 - these a elements I also would like the
05:29 - background color to change
05:33 - with my drop down menu
05:36 - take any a elements
05:39 - when I hover over them
05:41 - change the background color
05:45 - for the lightness I'll set that to be
05:49 - like 90.
05:51 - that looks pretty good all right here's
05:54 - the last change that we're going to make
05:56 - with our div section it's a block level
05:58 - element when I hover my cursor over this
06:01 - area even though it's all white space we
06:04 - still display the drop down menu
06:06 - the last change that I'm going to make
06:07 - is set the drop down menu div section
06:12 - to display
06:13 - as an inline block
06:17 - so when I hover over this white area we
06:20 - don't display the drop down menu until I
06:23 - move my cursor over the button then the
06:25 - menu is displayed
06:27 - all right everybody so that is a simple
06:29 - drop down menu only using HTML and CSS
06:33 - foreign
