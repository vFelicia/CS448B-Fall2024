00:00 - hey everybody in this topic I'm going to
00:02 - explain while Loops a while loop will
00:04 - execute some code while some condition
00:07 - remains true here's an example we'll use
00:09 - an if statement first we will ask a user
00:12 - for their name name equals input
00:15 - enter your name
00:19 - if our name is equal to an empty string
00:23 - that means the user didn't type in
00:25 - anything
00:26 - let's print a message
00:28 - you did not enter your name
00:32 - else
00:34 - we will print
00:36 - using an F string hello
00:40 - our user's name
00:43 - if I were to skip this prompt
00:46 - we would execute this if statement then
00:48 - we continue with the rest of the program
00:50 - what if I would like to continually
00:52 - prompt the user to type in their name we
00:55 - can't continue until they type in
00:56 - something well we could replace this if
00:59 - statement with a while loop
01:01 - while this condition is true continue to
01:05 - execute this code within the while loop
01:07 - I'm going to re-prompt the user to type
01:10 - in a name
01:12 - than if we were to exit the while loop
01:14 - then we will print hello whatever your
01:17 - name is
01:18 - so let's run this
01:20 - and to your name I'm going to hit enter
01:22 - you did not enter your name enter your
01:24 - name no no no okay I give up I'll type
01:28 - in my first name hit enter hello
01:30 - whatever your first name is while this
01:33 - condition remains true execute this code
01:36 - potentially forever until this condition
01:39 - is no longer true so that's one of the
01:42 - main benefits of a while loop if it's
01:44 - not true then you exit out of the while
01:46 - loop and that's why we're able to
01:47 - continue then print our name hello name
01:50 - you do want some way to escape out of
01:52 - the while loop otherwise you'll run into
01:54 - what's known as an infinite Loop
01:56 - so let's say while name is equal to an
02:00 - empty string
02:01 - we will print you did not enter your
02:03 - name
02:04 - so I'm going to hit enter so we are
02:07 - stuck in an infinite Loop we can't
02:09 - actually escape this Loop we didn't give
02:11 - ourselves an exit strategy
02:14 - that's why previously we re-prompted the
02:16 - user to type in something we're giving
02:18 - them a chance to escape in a way it kind
02:20 - of works like an if statement but
02:22 - instead of executing some code once it's
02:24 - potentially infinite here's another
02:26 - example this time let's ask for a user's
02:29 - age
02:31 - age equals and I will convert the input
02:34 - to an integer
02:37 - enter your age
02:39 - we'll need the user to type in a
02:41 - positive number
02:43 - while age
02:45 - is less than zero
02:49 - let's print a message to let the user
02:51 - know that they can't do that
02:54 - age
02:55 - can't be negative
02:58 - then we need some strategy to escape
03:01 - let's re-prompt the user to enter in
03:03 - their age
03:06 - once they type in something that's valid
03:08 - we can escape out of the while loop so
03:11 - let's print
03:12 - using an F string you are
03:16 - age years old
03:20 - so enter your age I'm going to say
03:22 - negative one H can't be negative
03:24 - negative two
03:26 - negative 1 million okay I give up how
03:30 - about 21 you are 21 years old so that
03:33 - was another example while our Edge
03:36 - variable is less than zero repeat this
03:38 - code Forever
03:39 - let's go over example three
03:42 - I'm going to introduce some logical
03:44 - operators we will have the user type in
03:46 - a food they like food equals input
03:51 - enter a food you like but in order to
03:55 - escape they need to press Q to quit
04:00 - while
04:01 - food is equal to the letter q
04:06 - continue this while loop however I'm
04:09 - going to make one change
04:10 - we want to exit the while loop when they
04:14 - press Q so you could say while not food
04:18 - equals Q
04:19 - So within this while loop let's print
04:21 - the food that they stated that they like
04:24 - I'll use an upstring
04:26 - you like
04:28 - your variable food
04:30 - then we will prompt the user to enter in
04:32 - another food that they like enter
04:34 - another food you like cue to quit
04:38 - then once we escape the while loop we
04:40 - will print just buy
04:43 - okay enter a food you like cue to quit I
04:46 - like pizza
04:47 - you like pizza I like sushi
04:51 - you like sushi I like Ramen you like
04:54 - Ramen okay this program's kind of lame
04:57 - so I'm going to press Q to quit and we
04:59 - escape the while loop we have printed
05:01 - bye so you could do something while
05:04 - something is not true by using the not
05:06 - logical operator all right last example
05:09 - example four we will use the or logical
05:12 - operator
05:13 - we'll ask a user to type in a number
05:15 - between 1 and 10.
05:18 - let's say num equals input
05:22 - enter a number between 1 through 10.
05:29 - then I will Typecast the input as an
05:32 - integer
05:35 - while
05:37 - our number
05:38 - is less than one or our number is
05:43 - greater than 10. let's re-prompt the
05:45 - user let's print using an F string
05:49 - are variable num
05:52 - is not valid
05:55 - then we will reprompt the user
05:58 - enter a number between 1 and 10.
06:01 - once we escape the while loop then we
06:04 - will print our number using an F string
06:06 - your number is our variable num
06:12 - enter a number between 1 through 10.
06:15 - zero
06:16 - zero is not valid negative one
06:19 - 100 nope uh five
06:23 - your number is five
06:25 - that's an example of how you can add
06:27 - logical operators to while Loops while
06:29 - this condition is true or this condition
06:32 - is true execute this code Forever all
06:36 - right everybody so those are while Loops
06:37 - a while loop will execute some code
06:40 - while some condition remains true it's
06:43 - fairly useful for verifying user input
06:45 - if a user types in some input that is
06:48 - not valid you can re-prompt them and
06:50 - there's many other uses that we'll
06:51 - discuss in the future but yeah those are
06:53 - while Loops in Python
