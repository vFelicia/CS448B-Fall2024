00:00 - hey everyone we're going to be learning
00:01 - about icons in this video so let's get
00:03 - into it
00:06 - before you reach the end of this video
00:08 - make sure to LIKE comment and subscribe
00:10 - so that we together can challenge and
00:13 - defeat the mighty YouTube algorithm
00:16 - everyone so for this lesson this is
00:19 - going to serve as a mini bonus video on
00:22 - how to add icons to a webpage now
00:24 - there's a few ways that you can do this
00:26 - this is what I do
00:27 - I tend use this website called font
00:30 - awesome and here's the URL I'll also
00:33 - post this in the description if you want
00:34 - to copy this or feel free to pause the
00:36 - video so you can actually use a lot of
00:38 - icons from this website there's a free
00:41 - version and there's also a pro version
00:43 - which you have to pay for but since I
00:45 - don't like to pay for things I like to
00:46 - use the free version now with these
00:48 - icons you can either download these
00:50 - otherwise you can link an external style
00:52 - sheet that has all of these icons then
00:55 - so I'll include this link in the
00:57 - description otherwise you can pause the
00:59 - video and copy this down but once you
01:01 - have this link in the head of your HTML
01:02 - file you're good to go then let's say
01:05 - that we want to include some sort of a
01:07 - home icon so we can do a search for that
01:09 - in a gallery here so let's look up home
01:12 - and see what we find
01:13 - this will be fine now in order to use
01:18 - this icon you'll want to be sure to
01:21 - include this eye tag and I'll just copy
01:24 - this and paste it here so there's one
01:27 - trick though if you're using the free
01:28 - version you want to be sure that you're
01:31 - typing in FA space FA - and the name of
01:35 - the icon so here it says FA s space FA -
01:40 - home we'll just want to be sure to take
01:42 - that s out other versions might have
01:44 - other letters here so let's save this
01:46 - and test it yep here is our home icon
01:50 - now we can actually use a larger version
01:52 - of this icon so after this class name
01:55 - what we're going to type here is FA -
02:00 - and how many times we want to basically
02:03 - expand this which version do we want
02:05 - let's say we want the version that is
02:08 - two times larger we're going to place 2x
02:10 - here so now we get a larger version of
02:13 - this icon but I think I'll stick with 4x
02:16 - for this demonstration and this is a
02:19 - suitable size I would say I'll include
02:22 - just a few other icons you can always
02:23 - search for some icons that you might
02:25 - like within the gallery so there's one
02:27 - for YouTube which I'm going to include
02:29 - so I'm going to change home to YouTube
02:33 - and there's also one for Twitter so I'm
02:35 - going to change home to Twitter and
02:37 - we're using the Forex version so let's
02:40 - save reload the page and here are a few
02:42 - icons and with these icons you can
02:45 - individually style these using CSS so
02:48 - let's say we want to change the color of
02:50 - our YouTube icon so what we'll do is
02:52 - target our YouTube class that was dot FA
02:55 - - YouTube and we will say we want this
02:59 - to be red and let's do the same thing
03:02 - for Twitter but a different color so FA
03:05 - - Twitter and we want this color to be 1
03:11 - D a1 F - I didn't remember that I had to
03:16 - look it up so let's save it reload the
03:18 - page and we have some nice colorful
03:20 - icons now okay last one here's a spinner
03:23 - so this is what you might see in during
03:25 - a loading screen it's FA spaced FA -
03:28 - spinner and there's different styles of
03:30 - spinners I kind of like this one it's FA
03:32 - - pulse and then we'll make this fa -
03:36 - for X and here is our spinner this is
03:39 - something you might see during a loading
03:41 - screen ok guys one last thing before we
03:43 - go I'm actually refilling this part
03:45 - because I forgot to mention this we can
03:47 - actually turn these icons into a
03:49 - hyperlink that'll take us somewhere when
03:51 - we click on it so let's say that we want
03:53 - to go to YouTube when we click on this
03:55 - icon so what we'll do for this icon is
03:58 - surround this with a pair of 8 eggs now
04:03 - within the opening 8 egg we'll use the H
04:06 - breath attribute and set this to the
04:08 - website that we want to go do so we'll
04:10 - say HTTP colon two forward slashes
04:14 - ww youtube.com let's save reload the
04:19 - page now one thing that you might see is
04:21 - that there tends to be like this
04:22 - underlined you might not see it here you
04:26 - can actually get rid of that that's
04:27 - standard with all hyperlinks just say
04:30 - target all 8 eggs and we're going
04:33 - to use a text decoration of none and
04:36 - that will get rid of that underline that
04:39 - you might see okay let's try this now
04:41 - and it brings us to YouTube's homepage
04:46 - well that concludes the CSS tutorial for
