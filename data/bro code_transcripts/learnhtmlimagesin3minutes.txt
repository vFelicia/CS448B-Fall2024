00:02 - all right people here's how to add an
00:04 - image to a webpage find or download an
00:06 - image of your choosing i just so happen
00:08 - to have a picture of shrek within your
00:10 - folder containing your index.html file
00:12 - you're going to move or paste that image
00:15 - within the same folder and within the
00:16 - body element we're going to create a new
00:18 - element an image element within angle
00:20 - brackets type img for image this is a
00:24 - self closing tag and many elements have
00:26 - different attributes that we can change
00:28 - we need to change the source attribute
00:31 - of this image element the source
00:32 - attribute is src and we will set this
00:36 - equal to within double quotes the name
00:38 - of our image mine is shrek.png and then
00:41 - save
00:42 - what i like to do if i'm working with a
00:44 - webpage that has a lot of images i like
00:46 - to create a separate folder for my
00:48 - images this isn't necessary but if your
00:51 - image is located within a separate
00:53 - folder we need to find the file path
00:55 - relative to your index.html file so i'm
00:58 - going to create a new folder and let's
01:00 - name this images it will contain all the
01:02 - images from my webpage then i will move
01:04 - my image to my images folder so we can
01:06 - no longer locate this image we need to
01:08 - find the file path relative to the
01:11 - index.html file to look within my images
01:14 - folder i will precede the image name
01:16 - with
01:17 - forward slash the name of the folder
01:19 - images slash the name of the image and
01:22 - there it is personally if i'm working
01:24 - with a lot of images i like to place all
01:26 - of my images within one folder if you
01:29 - decide to do that as well you just need
01:31 - to precede the file name with the name
01:33 - of the folder that it's in here's my
01:35 - image but it's fairly massive we can
01:37 - change the width and height attributes
01:39 - if we need to i will change the height
01:41 - attribute height equals maybe 200 and
01:45 - that's a lot smaller hm maybe 300 that's
01:48 - a little bit better the height and the
01:49 - width will scale proportionately with
01:51 - each other but you can change them
01:53 - individually let's change the width
01:55 - width equals
01:57 - let's say 100
02:00 - what we get is an extra skinny shrek and
02:02 - if i change this to maybe 600 well shrek
02:06 - is extra thick now so i will just only
02:08 - change the height attribute so that the
02:11 - width attribute scales proportionately
02:13 - now if somebody is visually impaired
02:15 - they may be using a screen reader to
02:17 - navigate a web page it would be good
02:19 - practice to add some alternative text
02:21 - that is read out loud by a screen reader
02:23 - so that is the alt attribute within
02:25 - double quotes i'll type a brief
02:27 - description of this image
02:29 - this is a picture of shrek so when you
02:33 - add an image it's considered good
02:34 - practice to add some alternative text
02:37 - you can also add a title too a title
02:39 - will be a small pop-up box that appears
02:41 - when you hover your cursor over an image
02:44 - to add a title set the title attribute
02:46 - equal to some text
02:48 - shrek is
02:50 - shrek see
02:51 - and then i'm going to save hover my
02:53 - cursor over the image and we can see a
02:56 - small pop-up box that has my title shrek
02:59 - is shrek see we can also turn an image
03:01 - into a hyperlink to turn this image into
03:04 - a hyperlink we need to surround our
03:06 - image element with an opening and
03:08 - closing a tag
03:09 - so open and close within the opening a
03:12 - tag there is an href attribute that we
03:14 - can set to a url of our choosing i think
03:17 - i'll set this hyperlink to the wikipedia
03:19 - page for shrek so just type in the url
03:22 - between these double quotes save then if
03:25 - i were to click on my image this will
03:27 - take me to the wikipedia page for shrek
03:29 - or some other url depending on what you
03:31 - type here so yeah that's how to add an
03:33 - image to a webpage within the body
03:35 - element you need to add an image element
03:38 - and then set the source equal to the
03:40 - image name if you found this video
