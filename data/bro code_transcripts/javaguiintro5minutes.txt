00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
00:01 - bro hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video i'm going to teach you guys how we
00:04 - can make a very basic
00:06 - gui application in java so sit back
00:09 - relax
00:09 - and enjoy the show
00:13 - if you find this video helpful please
00:15 - remember to like
00:16 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:19 - help keep this channel running
00:20 - all right guys and gals i'm going to
00:22 - teach you all how to create a very basic
00:25 - gui program gui is an acronym for
00:27 - graphical
00:28 - user interface it's a visual program
00:31 - that we can see
00:32 - and interact with kind of like this
00:35 - so we'll be using the j option pane
00:38 - class and be creating a few message
00:40 - dialog boxes
00:41 - before we begin we'll need an import so
00:43 - outside your class let's type this
00:45 - import java x dot swing
00:49 - dot j option pin
00:53 - so we will be working with the j option
00:56 - pane
00:56 - class now what we would like to do is
00:59 - type in some user information into a
01:01 - sort of
01:02 - dialog box and we'll store this as a
01:04 - string variable called
01:05 - name kind of like what we did on the
01:07 - video on user input
01:09 - string name and in order to create an
01:12 - input dialog box we're going to type
01:14 - the name of the class j option pane
01:19 - dot and there's a few options what we
01:21 - would like is
01:22 - show input dialog and you can really
01:25 - just pick any of these
01:26 - and we can type in a message so with
01:29 - this message
01:30 - let's state enter your
01:34 - name and when we run this
01:37 - this is what we have we have the small
01:40 - gui dialog box and we can type in our
01:42 - name and submit it
01:43 - but it currently doesn't do anything so
01:45 - let's create another message dialog box
01:48 - that will display our name along with a
01:49 - message
01:51 - so j option
01:54 - pain dot show message
01:58 - dialogue for now you can just type in no
02:02 - comma and then a message let's say
02:06 - hello plus
02:09 - name and let's try it so our first
02:13 - dialog box is the show input dialog
02:16 - message
02:17 - and we can type in our name and submit a
02:19 - name
02:20 - and our second box here is a message
02:22 - dialog box this just displays some
02:24 - information
02:25 - such as a string of text and it says
02:28 - hello bro
02:29 - this time let's ask for an edge and
02:31 - store this value within an integer
02:33 - variable called age int
02:35 - age equals and we can just copy all of
02:37 - this
02:38 - j option pane dot show input dialog
02:41 - and the message will be enter your edge
02:44 - there is one issue though
02:46 - when you use the show input dialog box
02:49 - it's going to return
02:50 - a string and we're attempting to assign
02:53 - the string into an integer
02:54 - variable so what we would need to do is
02:57 - convert this
02:58 - to an integer and there is actually a
03:01 - method to do that
03:03 - so what i'm going to do is use the
03:05 - integer
03:06 - wrapper class and use the parseint
03:09 - method
03:10 - and within the parenthesis we're going
03:12 - to take all of this
03:15 - and copy it within our parseint method
03:19 - and then add a semicolon at the end so
03:21 - this will return
03:22 - a string based on what the user types in
03:25 - and the parseint method will convert it
03:27 - to an integer that we can store it
03:29 - within our integer variable of age
03:31 - and then we can display this so let's
03:33 - display this with another
03:35 - message dialog box j option pane dot
03:38 - show message dialog
03:40 - null will be the first argument and our
03:44 - message will be
03:46 - u r plus age
03:50 - plus years old
03:53 - and let's try it
03:56 - enter your name bro press okay
04:00 - hello bro then when we click okay again
04:02 - it's going to go to our next
04:04 - input dialog box enter your age let's
04:07 - say that i'm 18
04:08 - click ok you are 18 years old now let's
04:12 - try this with a double data type
04:17 - this time let's create a variable called
04:19 - maybe height
04:20 - this will be a double value and the
04:23 - variable name will be height
04:25 - so since we're working with double
04:26 - values we're going to change integer to
04:29 - double double with a capital d dot parse
04:33 - double and the message will be enter
04:37 - your height and our message dialog
04:41 - will be u r height
04:46 - and let's say this is in centimeters
04:48 - tall
04:50 - so we have to be sure that we're getting
04:52 - the right data type because when you use
04:54 - the input dialog box it's going to
04:56 - return a string
04:57 - so if you're attempting to assign that
04:59 - string to a certain data type you have
05:01 - to convert it
05:02 - to that specific data type so let's try
05:04 - this
05:05 - enter your name bro okay hello bro
05:09 - what is your age let's say i'm 18 press
05:12 - okay
05:12 - you're 18 years old enter your height i
05:15 - don't know what a good height is
05:17 - 240 centimeters and then click ok
05:20 - you are 240.0 centimeters tall
05:24 - in conclusion ladies and gentlemen what
05:25 - we have made is a
05:27 - very simple graphical user interface for
05:29 - fun
05:30 - this is completely optional at this
05:32 - point but we will be learning more about
05:34 - gooeys later in this playlist
05:36 - so if you would like a copy of all this
05:37 - code i will post all of this in the
05:39 - comments down below
