00:00 - hey everybody today I'm going to be
00:02 - explaining views views their virtual
00:04 - tables they're not real they're made up
00:06 - of fields and columns from one or more
00:09 - real tables and they can be interacted
00:11 - with as if they were a real table so
00:13 - here's an example I'm going to select
00:16 - all from my employees table
00:20 - our boss Mr Krabs he would like us to
00:22 - create an employee attendance sheet made
00:24 - up of just the first and last names of
00:26 - all the employees well I could create a
00:29 - view that is made from the first and
00:31 - last name Columns of the employees table
00:33 - now A View isn't a real table but it can
00:36 - behave as if it were I may want to
00:38 - create a view of the employee first and
00:40 - last names instead of another table
00:42 - because we try not to repeat data if we
00:44 - don't have to if I had two tables one of
00:47 - employees and another of employee
00:49 - attendance if I need to remove an
00:51 - employee I would need to do so in two
00:53 - places with the view it's always up to
00:55 - date any changes to one or more of these
00:57 - real tables will also update the view so
01:00 - let's create a view of the first and
01:02 - last name of our employees table to
01:04 - create a view you would type create view
01:07 - then the name of the view let's say
01:09 - employee attendance
01:12 - than as
01:14 - I'm going to zoom in a little bit
01:16 - what would we like to select let's
01:18 - select
01:19 - first name
01:21 - last name
01:23 - from a real table let's say from
01:26 - employees
01:30 - so everything was successful
01:32 - let's refresh our schemas window
01:35 - underneath the views category we have a
01:37 - new view employee attendance
01:40 - I'm going to select all from that view
01:44 - name
01:45 - employee
01:47 - attendance
01:49 - and let's see what we got yeah here's
01:51 - our attendance sheet we have the first
01:53 - and last name columns from the employees
01:56 - table this view can be interacted with
01:58 - as if it were a real table
02:00 - I will add order by
02:04 - last name ascending
02:08 - you can use keywords and operators that
02:10 - we've learned about in previous lessons
02:11 - on A View to drop a view you would type
02:14 - drop view the name of The View
02:17 - employee attendance
02:21 - and it's gone
02:23 - all right here's another example so
02:25 - views they're always up to date right
02:27 - let's create a view of customer emails
02:30 - select all from customers
02:33 - let's take a look to see what we have so
02:35 - far
02:36 - I'm going to add one more column a
02:38 - column of customer emails
02:42 - alter table
02:44 - customers
02:46 - add column email data type will be
02:51 - varchar I think varchar 50 should be
02:54 - enough space
02:55 - and there's our new column
02:58 - let's update these rows
03:01 - update customers
03:04 - set email equal to the first email will
03:09 - be for Fred fish f
03:11 - isch gmail.com then we'll need a where
03:15 - Clause where customer ID equals one
03:20 - that's our first email
03:22 - customer ID 2 will be L Lobster
03:27 - gmail.com
03:30 - three is be bass gmail.com
03:34 - four will be
03:37 - puff gmail.com everybody really likes
03:40 - Gmail I guess let's create a view from
03:43 - these customer emails
03:45 - create View
03:49 - customer
03:50 - emails
03:52 - as what are we selecting let's select
03:56 - the email column
03:58 - from our customers table
04:02 - let's refresh our schemas window yeah we
04:04 - have a customer emails View
04:06 - then I will select all from customer
04:11 - emails
04:14 - and look at that we have a listing of
04:16 - all the customer emails and we're going
04:18 - to spam these people with coupons or
04:21 - something I don't know when you update
04:23 - one or more of the real tables in your
04:24 - database those views would reflect any
04:27 - changes let's add one more customer so
04:30 - let's take a look at our customers table
04:32 - select all from customers
04:37 - let's add one more customer
04:39 - insert into our customers table
04:43 - some values
04:45 - we have five columns a customer ID
04:48 - first name first name will be pearl
04:52 - last name is crabs
04:55 - referral ID let's say null
04:59 - email will be P crabs gmail.com
05:07 - okay there's our new customer let's take
05:10 - a look at our view let's see if it
05:11 - updated
05:12 - select all from customer
05:17 - emails
05:20 - yeah look at that it's up to date that
05:22 - is one of the benefits of a view it will
05:24 - update automatically because we're using
05:27 - components from real tables any views
05:29 - that use that data will also be updated
05:31 - the other benefit of a view is that we
05:33 - don't have to repeat data in a real
05:35 - table ideally we'd only want to make a
05:37 - change in one place rather than across
05:40 - multiple tables alright that's a view
05:42 - everybody a view is a virtual table
05:44 - based on the results of an SQL statement
05:47 - they're not real tables but they can be
05:50 - interacted with as if they were real the
05:52 - fields found within a view are fields
05:54 - from one or more real tables in the
05:56 - database so yeah those are views in
05:59 - MySQL
