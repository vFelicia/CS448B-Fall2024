00:00 - hey what's going on everybody today I'm
00:01 - going to explain the Overflow property
00:03 - in CSS the Overflow property sets the
00:07 - defined behavior when content does not
00:10 - fit in the parent element box meaning it
00:14 - overflows there's five states visible
00:17 - hidden clip scroll and Auto
00:19 - here's an example
00:21 - let's create a div element
00:25 - then within this development I'll create
00:27 - a paragraph
00:31 - I'll generate some text
00:34 - then going to our style sheet I'll take
00:37 - our div then give the stiff a border
00:41 - of 2 pixel solid
00:45 - I'll also limit the height
00:47 - height
00:48 - 75 pixels
00:51 - now we have a problem the content of our
00:54 - paragraph
00:55 - is overflowing out of our div
00:59 - we have a couple different ways of
01:00 - handling this with the Overflow property
01:04 - by default
01:06 - overflow is set to visible there is
01:08 - going to be no apparent change
01:10 - basically we're stating if any Inner
01:13 - Elements will overflow allow it to do so
01:16 - that's why you see this text overflow
01:18 - out of our box
01:20 - our second state is hidden
01:23 - with hidden any content that will
01:25 - overflow outside of our box will be
01:27 - hidden we can no longer see it however
01:30 - we can still interact with it for
01:32 - example if I were to copy and paste all
01:34 - of this text
01:38 - foreign
01:40 - well we still have the full text
01:42 - available
01:43 - now clip clip is very similar to Hidden
01:46 - there's no apparent change
01:49 - with overflow set to clip it's used in
01:52 - tandem with the Overflow clip margin
01:56 - property
01:57 - using this property we can set how far
02:00 - this content displays or overflows
02:03 - outside of the box
02:05 - if I were to set overflow to be 13
02:08 - pixels this content will overflow by
02:11 - this amount 13 pixels then the rest is
02:14 - hidden it's very similar to Hidden but
02:17 - it's used alongside overflow clip margin
02:21 - then we have scroll
02:24 - with scroll our box contains a scroll
02:26 - bar both vertical and horizontal we can
02:29 - use the scroll bar to see the entire
02:31 - length of our content if there's not
02:33 - enough content within this container for
02:36 - example I'll delete most of these words
02:43 - well we still have that scroll bar
02:45 - although it's disabled
02:47 - if you set overflow to auto
02:50 - if you don't need the scroll bar either
02:53 - horizontal or vertical it won't be
02:55 - displayed until you do need it so let me
02:58 - undo these changes
03:01 - now that scroll bar is displayed that's
03:04 - the use of overflow Auto
03:06 - all right everybody so that's the
03:07 - Overflow property it sets the behavior
03:10 - for a parent element when the content
03:12 - doesn't quite fit you can set this
03:14 - property to be visible hidden clip
03:16 - scroll or Auto and that is the Overflow
03:19 - property in CSS
03:21 - foreign
