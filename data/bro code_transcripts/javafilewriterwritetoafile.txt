00:02 - video i'm going to teach you guys how we
00:04 - can use
00:04 - file writers in java to write to a file
00:07 - so
00:07 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - if you find this video helpful please

00:17 - help keep this channel running
00:20 - well welcome back ladies and gentlemen
00:22 - in this video i'm going to teach you
00:23 - guys how we can write
00:24 - to a file in java so we're going to use
00:27 - a class called
00:28 - the file writer class to help us with
00:30 - this so let's create an instance of our
00:32 - file writer class
00:34 - file writer let's just call this writer
00:36 - for short
00:37 - equals new file writer
00:40 - and then within the constructor of this
00:42 - file writer we're going to list the file
00:44 - path or the
00:45 - file name so let's just have this appear
00:48 - within
00:48 - our project folder so i'm going to come
00:50 - up with a name for this file
00:52 - let's write a poem so i'm going to call
00:54 - this poem.txt
00:56 - so we'll need a few imports let's
00:58 - include those at the top
01:01 - all right now with file riders we'll
01:04 - need to
01:04 - add try and catch blocks so we're going
01:07 - to surround
01:08 - our file writer with a try block and
01:10 - we'll also have a catch block as well
01:12 - so this just auto-generated that'll be
01:14 - just fine
01:15 - now in order to write to this file
01:17 - writer object we're going to use a
01:19 - particular method and that is the right
01:23 - method and this will take a string so
01:26 - let's write
01:26 - maybe the first line of a poem like
01:29 - roses
01:30 - are red now the last thing that we
01:32 - should do is close this file writer so
01:34 - at the end
01:36 - writer dot close and let's test this
01:41 - so i'm going to refresh my project
01:43 - folder by
01:44 - pressing f5 and here's my poem and it
01:47 - says
01:47 - roses are red now if you need to add a
01:50 - new line to this
01:51 - be sure to use the new line escape
01:53 - sequence that is
01:54 - backslash n so let's add a few more
01:57 - lines to this
01:59 - so let's add violets are
02:02 - blue new line
02:06 - booty booty booty booty
02:09 - new line rockin everywhere
02:14 - and let's test this so this is going to
02:17 - overwrite what you have currently so now
02:19 - we have four lines
02:21 - to this file that we have you can also
02:23 - append some text as well using the
02:25 - append method
02:27 - writer dot append and this will add
02:30 - a string or some characters at the end
02:33 - of your file
02:34 - so maybe i'll write new line
02:37 - then within parentheses a poem
02:41 - by bro and that should be good so this
02:44 - will append and add some text
02:46 - to the end of our poem let's try it
02:49 - roses are red velvets are blue booty
02:51 - booty booty booty rocking everywhere
02:52 - a poem by bro so really that's all there
02:55 - is to a file writer you create an
02:57 - instance of a file writer
02:59 - you can use the write function the
03:00 - append function just be sure to
03:02 - close the writer when you're done with
03:04 - it so that's the basics of file writers
03:06 - in java if you'd like a copy of this
03:08 - code i will post this in the comments
03:10 - down below
03:10 - yeah that's the basics of file writers
03:13 - in java
