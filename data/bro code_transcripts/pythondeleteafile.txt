00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
00:02 - hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to teach you
00:04 - guys how we can delete files using
00:06 - python so
00:07 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - if you find this video helpful please
00:14 - remember to like
00:15 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:17 - help keep this channel running
00:19 - all right everybody so in this video
00:22 - we're going to be deleting files using
00:24 - python and in order to do so i recommend
00:26 - importing the os module
00:28 - this is already included with the
00:30 - standard python library all you need to
00:32 - do
00:32 - is import it and now we need a file to
00:34 - work with
00:35 - so let's right click on our projects
00:36 - folder and go to new
00:38 - file i will name this test.txt
00:41 - and we now have a file that we can work
00:43 - with but you know what i would like to
00:45 - delete this file because it's lame
00:47 - so let's do that in order to delete this
00:49 - file let's type os
00:50 - dot remove and we're going to list the
00:53 - file path here
00:54 - since this file is within my project
00:56 - folder i only need to list
00:58 - the file path test.txt if this was
01:01 - someplace else on my computer i would
01:03 - probably need the file path
01:04 - like that but since this file is within
01:07 - my project folder i only need
01:08 - the file name another thing that you can
01:10 - do too at least what i like to do
01:12 - is that i like to pass in a variable
01:14 - called path i will make this a variable
01:17 - and assign it a
01:18 - string value of whatever the path to my
01:21 - file is
01:22 - so i will assign path the name to my
01:24 - file
01:25 - test.txt now when i run this this will
01:28 - delete
01:28 - my file test.txt and you can see that
01:31 - it's no longer there
01:32 - now what if we attempt to delete a file
01:34 - that doesn't exist
01:36 - well we'll encounter an exception so if
01:38 - you want this is optional we can do some
01:40 - exception handling
01:41 - so let's write the remove function
01:44 - within a try block
01:45 - and we will catch this exception file
01:48 - not found error
01:49 - and let's print something print that
01:52 - file was not found now if you attempt to
01:56 - delete a file that doesn't exist
01:58 - your program will not be interrupted and
02:00 - instead you'll print something
02:02 - that file was not found now this
02:05 - function
02:05 - does not remove empty folders this is
02:08 - how to do so
02:09 - and actually let's test that so let's
02:11 - create a new directory
02:12 - i'll call this empty underscore
02:15 - folder now i will attempt to delete this
02:18 - empty folder
02:19 - empty folder
02:23 - we encountered a permission error access
02:25 - is denied so let's create an accept
02:27 - clock for that
02:28 - accept permission error
02:31 - print i don't know you do
02:35 - not have permission to
02:38 - delete that all right to delete
02:42 - an empty folder there is a different
02:44 - function
02:46 - os dot rmdir
02:49 - short for remove directory we're going
02:51 - to list the file path
02:52 - and pass that in as an argument and
02:55 - let's create an else block as well
02:56 - because we can
02:57 - else if there are no exceptions let's
03:00 - print
03:01 - path plus was
03:04 - deleted all right so rmdir
03:08 - remove directory will delete an empty
03:10 - directory
03:11 - empty folder was deleted now this
03:14 - function will not delete
03:16 - a folder that contains files and let's
03:18 - try that so let's create a
03:20 - new directory i'll just call this folder
03:23 - and within this folder i will create a
03:25 - new file
03:27 - test.txt
03:30 - all right let's attempt to delete this
03:32 - folder i will probably need to change
03:34 - the file name
03:35 - let's change that to folder and we
03:38 - encountered
03:39 - an os error that directory is not empty
03:42 - so let's handle this exception we don't
03:44 - need to but i like to accept
03:46 - os air print
03:50 - you cannot delete that
03:53 - using that function
03:57 - okay to delete a folder that contains
04:00 - files
04:01 - we'll need the shuttle module import
04:04 - shuttle and the function that we're
04:06 - looking for is
04:08 - shuttle dot rm tree
04:11 - short for remove tree and we will pass
04:13 - in our path
04:14 - now be careful with this function it is
04:16 - considered dangerous
04:17 - because it will delete a directory and
04:19 - all files contained within
04:21 - so now we can delete a folder that
04:23 - contains files
04:25 - folder was deleted in conclusion these
04:28 - are
04:28 - three basic functions to delete a file
04:31 - or directory they are remove which
04:34 - deletes a file
04:35 - rmdir which is an abbreviation for
04:38 - remove directory which will delete an
04:41 - empty directory
04:42 - and lastly rmtree which is an
04:44 - abbreviation for
04:45 - remove tree and this is of the shuttle
04:48 - module
04:48 - and this will delete a directory
04:50 - containing files
04:52 - so if you would like a copy of all this
04:54 - code i will post this in the comments
04:56 - section down below
04:57 - but yeah that is how to delete files and
04:59 - or directories
05:00 - using python
