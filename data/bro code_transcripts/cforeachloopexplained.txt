00:02 - all right guys the for each loop the for
00:05 - each loop is a loop that eases the
00:07 - traversal over an iterable data set an
00:10 - array is an example of an iterable data
00:12 - set suppose we're using a standard for
00:15 - loop and i have this array of strings
00:17 - named students we have spongebob patrick
00:19 - and squidward using a standard for loop
00:22 - i would need three statements an index a
00:25 - condition
00:26 - then we could increment or decrement our
00:28 - index this does work but there is
00:31 - another way of writing this using a for
00:33 - each loop there's less syntax than a
00:35 - typical for loop but it's less flexible
00:38 - using a for loop we can go forwards
00:41 - backwards or even skip iterations of
00:43 - something we're iterating over using a
00:46 - for each loop we start at the beginning
00:48 - and go to the end there's less
00:50 - flexibility so let's change this to a
00:52 - for each loop
00:55 - first we'll add the data type of what
00:57 - we're iterating over we're iterating
00:59 - over strings
01:01 - then we'll need a name for the current
01:03 - element that we're on we have an array
01:05 - of students let's name the current
01:07 - element student
01:09 - colon
01:10 - then our iterable data set which would
01:13 - be our array
01:15 - string student colon students during
01:18 - each iteration let's display whatever
01:21 - the current element is which i named
01:23 - student
01:25 - then i'll add a new line
01:30 - and there we go we have our three
01:32 - students
01:33 - then you could change the amount of
01:34 - students if you would like
01:36 - let's add sandy
01:38 - now we have spongebob patrick squidward
01:40 - sandy let's try a different example
01:42 - let's work with grades this time these
01:45 - will be of the int data type int
01:48 - grades
01:49 - equals
01:50 - make up some grades
01:52 - 65.
01:54 - 72
01:55 - 81
01:57 - 93 good enough the data type of what
02:00 - we're iterating over is not a string
02:02 - this time it is an int integers
02:06 - let's name each element
02:08 - simply grade
02:10 - colon the name of my iterable data set
02:13 - which would be my array grades for every
02:17 - grade in grades let's display each grade
02:24 - and here are the grades 65 72 81 93 so
02:29 - that's a for each loop it's a loop that
02:32 - eases the traversal over an iterable
02:34 - data set there's less syntax involved in
02:37 - a for each loop but it's less flexible
02:39 - if you just need to display the elements
02:41 - of an array a for each loop would work
02:43 - perfect so yeah that's a for each loop
02:46 - everybody your assignment is to post a
02:49 - for each loop in the comment section
02:51 - down below and well yeah that's the for
02:53 - each loop in c plus
