00:02 - hey guys in this video i'm going to show
00:04 - you eight useful math related functions
00:06 - in c plus plus let's begin by creating
00:09 - three variables
00:10 - double x and i will set this to be three
00:15 - double y that will be four
00:17 - then double z we will declare this but
00:20 - not yet assign it the first useful math
00:22 - related function is the max function
00:24 - which will return the greater of two
00:26 - values or variables
00:29 - i'll assign the result within z z equals
00:33 - standard max parentheses within the
00:36 - parentheses add two values or variables
00:39 - i'll compare x and y then let's display
00:42 - the result standard output i would like
00:45 - to display whatever z is
00:47 - the greater number between three and
00:49 - four as well you guessed it four
00:51 - alternatively there's the min function
00:54 - z
00:55 - equals
00:56 - standard min
00:59 - let's compare x then y
01:02 - so the minimum between these two values
01:05 - would be three
01:06 - so that's max and min
01:08 - now the rest of these functions are
01:10 - found within the c math header file at
01:12 - the top of our file let's include
01:15 - c
01:16 - math
01:17 - we have the pow function to raise a base
01:19 - to a given power
01:22 - z equals pow
01:24 - for power let's raise two to the power
01:28 - of three
01:31 - z would be eight
01:34 - two to the power of four
01:35 - would be
01:37 - sixteen that's the power function then
01:40 - we have square root z equals
01:43 - sqrt what's the square root of nine well
01:47 - the square root of nine
01:49 - is three
01:51 - then we have absolute value z equals abs
01:55 - if you place a negative number within
01:57 - the absolute value function it will give
01:59 - you the positive version of that number
02:02 - how far it is away from zero so negative
02:04 - three
02:06 - the absolute value of negative three
02:08 - would be
02:09 - three
02:10 - that is the absolute value function
02:13 - next we have the round function let's
02:15 - change x to three point one four
02:19 - z
02:20 - equals round let's round x
02:24 - 3.14 rounded
02:27 - would be three if you need to round up
02:29 - there's a ceiling function
02:31 - z equals seal seal means ceiling let's
02:36 - round x
02:37 - x rounded up
02:40 - is 4.
02:41 - alternatively there's the floor function
02:43 - which will always round down
02:46 - let's change x to 3.99 to test it
02:50 - z
02:51 - equals
02:52 - floor
02:54 - x
02:56 - x rounded down
02:58 - is three
03:00 - so yeah everybody that is a super quick
03:02 - video on a few useful math related
03:04 - functions
03:05 - if you head to this url c plus dot com
03:08 - slash reference slash c math there's a
03:11 - lot more useful math functions that you
03:13 - may be interested in but we just covered
03:15 - a few of the basics in the next topic
03:17 - we're going to create a practice program
03:19 - to find the hypotenuse of a right
03:21 - triangle so yeah those are a few useful
03:24 - math related functions in c plus plus
