00:00 - well hello again everybody it's me in
00:03 - today's topic I'm going to show you how
00:04 - we can generate some random numbers in
00:06 - Python then at the end of this video as
00:08 - an exercise we're going to create a
00:10 - number guessing program let's begin we
00:13 - will be importing the random module type
00:15 - import random
00:18 - the random module gives us access to a
00:20 - lot of useful methods involving random
00:22 - numbers for a comprehensive list you can
00:25 - use the help function pass in the random
00:28 - module
00:29 - and then we would want to print this
00:34 - here's what we all have access to
00:36 - we have a shuffle method set state
00:39 - seed
00:41 - sample random range random random inch
00:44 - random bytes and there's a ton of others
00:47 - but we'll discuss a few of the more
00:48 - useful methods for beginners for a
00:50 - random whole integer maybe you're
00:53 - rolling a six-sided dice you would type
00:55 - the name of the random module dot that a
00:58 - method for a random whole integer type
01:00 - Rand int add a set of parentheses within
01:05 - the set of parentheses you will list a
01:06 - range if I'm rolling a six-sided dice I
01:10 - would like the numbers one through six
01:11 - one comma six
01:14 - then I will assign what is returned to
01:16 - maybe a variable
01:18 - print whatever my number is
01:23 - my random number is a four
01:26 - three one four all right I tend to play
01:29 - a lot of Dungeons and Dragons we use
01:32 - polyhedral dice that have more or less
01:35 - than six sides there is a 20-sided dice
01:37 - for a random number between 1 and 20 I
01:40 - would set the range to be one comma 20.
01:44 - here I rolled a 16.
01:46 - and a seven and an eight within the Rand
01:49 - int method you can place variables as
01:51 - well as long as they contain numbers
01:54 - I will create a variable named low I'll
01:56 - set that equal to one
01:58 - and a variable named High I will set
02:01 - that to be 100.
02:03 - I will replace the numbers with my
02:05 - variables that behave as numbers
02:08 - give me a random integer between my low
02:11 - variable and high variable so between 1
02:13 - and 100 in this example I have rolled a
02:16 - 75.
02:18 - now in 88 if you need a random floating
02:20 - Point number you can use the random
02:22 - method random dot random
02:26 - then let's assign this to a variable
02:29 - number equals the random method of the
02:32 - random module
02:33 - that would return a random floating
02:35 - Point number between 0 and 1.
02:39 - you can pick a random Choice from a
02:41 - sequence
02:42 - in the future we're going to create a
02:43 - game of rock paper scissors
02:45 - let's say we have a tuple of options
02:49 - options equals
02:52 - Rock
02:54 - paper
02:57 - scissors
02:59 - we are accessing the random module dot
03:01 - then use the choice method
03:04 - place your sequence within the choice
03:06 - method
03:07 - give me a random Choice from options
03:11 - I will store this within a variable
03:12 - let's say option equals random Choice
03:16 - from my options then I will print the
03:20 - option
03:21 - our computer has generated scissors
03:23 - paper
03:25 - Rock
03:26 - so the choice method is a great use for
03:29 - games if you ever need a random element
03:32 - now there's also Shuffle
03:34 - this time maybe we have a deck of cards
03:37 - cards equals I guess I'll use a list
03:39 - this time
03:50 - I have a list of cards that you would
03:52 - normally find within a deck of playing
03:54 - cards well besides the suit two through
03:57 - ten Jack queen king Ace
04:00 - using the shuffle method I can Shuffle
04:02 - this sequence
04:04 - access the random module dot Shuffle
04:07 - pass in your sequence
04:10 - in my case it's cards then I will print
04:12 - cards
04:14 - yeah look at that
04:16 - my cards are now shuffled in the future
04:18 - we'll be creating a game of blackjack
04:20 - the shuffle method will be used then to
04:23 - shuffle our deck of cards those are a
04:25 - few methods found within the random
04:27 - module for some practice let's create a
04:29 - number guessing game as an exercise
04:32 - a user has to guess a number between a
04:34 - certain range
04:37 - maybe between 1 and 100 I'll set low to
04:40 - be one
04:41 - High to be 100
04:45 - guesses set to zero
04:48 - then we will generate a random number
04:51 - equals random
04:54 - dot Rand int
04:57 - the range is between our variables low
05:00 - and high
05:03 - we'll create a while loop while true
05:07 - while the user guesses the wrong number
05:09 - we'll have to continue the while loop we
05:12 - only Escape when they get the right
05:13 - number but we'll give them a hint
05:16 - so guess
05:18 - equals
05:20 - input I'll use an F string
05:23 - enter a number between
05:29 - low
05:32 - through
05:34 - High
05:38 - I'm going to surround this with a set of
05:39 - parentheses
05:41 - then I'm going to Typecast our input as
05:44 - an integer
05:46 - after making one guess I will increment
05:49 - our guesses variable by one guesses plus
05:52 - equals one
05:56 - now if our guess is less than our number
06:02 - let's print
06:04 - using an F string
06:09 - guess is too low
06:15 - else if gas is greater than our number
06:20 - we will print
06:22 - I'm just going to copy this
06:24 - is to hi
06:28 - then else
06:31 - if our guess is not lower than the
06:33 - number and our guess is not higher than
06:35 - the number well then our guess must
06:38 - equal the number that means we got the
06:40 - number right
06:41 - then I will print
06:47 - guess is correct
06:51 - then we will break
06:53 - so when we escape the while loop
06:57 - let's print the number of guesses it
06:58 - took to get the right number
07:01 - I'll use an upstring
07:02 - this round took you
07:06 - our guesses variable
07:08 - then the word guesses
07:11 - that should complete our program let's
07:12 - try it
07:14 - enter a number between 1 and 100 I'll
07:16 - guess something right in the middle 50.
07:19 - 50 is too high okay so our number is
07:21 - between 1 and 50.
07:23 - I'll guess something in the middle of
07:25 - that range maybe 25 25 is still too high
07:29 - 12.
07:30 - 12 is too high
07:32 - six
07:33 - is too low okay we know our number is
07:35 - between 6 and 12.
07:38 - nine
07:39 - nine is correct this round took you five
07:42 - guesses well okay then everybody
07:45 - that is how to work with random numbers
07:47 - in Python and hopefully you gained a
07:49 - little bit of experience working with
07:51 - random numbers with this number guessing
07:52 - game we'll be utilizing random numbers
07:54 - for a lot of games in the future and
07:56 - well yeah that's how to work with random
07:58 - numbers in Python
