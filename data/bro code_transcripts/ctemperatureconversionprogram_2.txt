00:00 - hey uh everybody it's bro hope you're
00:02 - doing well and in this video we're going
00:04 - to create a small program where the user
00:06 - will type in a temperature and we can
00:07 - convert that temperature from fahrenheit
00:09 - to celsius or celsius to fahrenheit so
00:12 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:16 - now before we begin this video make sure
00:18 - that you include these two imports at
00:21 - the top we'll be working with string
00:22 - functions and many of them can be found
00:24 - within this import see type dot h so
00:28 - let's declare the variables that we'll
00:29 - need
00:30 - char unit
00:32 - unit will be either c for celsius or f
00:35 - for fahrenheit and float temp short for
00:39 - temperature
00:40 - let's prompt the user to enter in some
00:42 - user input print f
00:46 - is the
00:48 - temperature
00:50 - in
00:52 - f
00:53 - or
00:56 - c and then we will accept some user
01:00 - input
01:01 - so we will be accepting a character so
01:04 - use the appropriate format specifier for
01:06 - characters
01:07 - and we will use the address of operator
01:10 - which is an ampersand unit
01:13 - and then let's use an if statement to
01:15 - check to see
01:16 - if unit
01:17 - is equal to the character c
01:22 - else if
01:26 - unit is equal to f
01:29 - we will use the formula to convert
01:31 - fahrenheit to celsius if it's c celsius
01:34 - to fahrenheit and we should probably add
01:36 - an else statement as well
01:38 - okay let's actually test these right now
01:42 - okay this will only be temporary i'm
01:44 - going to print a message
01:46 - the temp is currently
01:49 - in celsius
01:53 - and with fahrenheit the temperature is
01:55 - currently in fahrenheit
01:57 - so if the user did not type in c or f
02:00 - well then what the heck did they type in
02:02 - so within our else statement let's yell
02:04 - at the user let's say that whatever they
02:06 - entered in is not valid input
02:10 - so format specifier c
02:13 - is not a valid
02:16 - unit of measurement
02:19 - and then we will display whatever the
02:20 - user typed into our unit variable
02:23 - so let's test this is the temperature in
02:26 - f or c
02:28 - so f
02:29 - the temp is currently in f
02:31 - let's try it again
02:33 - is the temperature in f or c see
02:36 - the temp is currently in c
02:39 - okay this time we will not type in f4c
02:41 - how about the word pizza this only
02:44 - accepts the first character p is not a
02:46 - valid unit of measurement
02:48 - here's one situation that we may run
02:50 - into c programs are case sensitive if i
02:54 - type in lowercase f or lowercase c well
02:57 - technically neither of these conditions
02:59 - would be true for example if i type
03:01 - lowercase c
03:02 - c is not a valid unit of measurement to
03:05 - avoid that problem i can take my user
03:08 - input and use the two upper function to
03:11 - make it uppercase or you could set these
03:13 - conditions to check for lowercase
03:15 - characters instead and use the two lower
03:18 - function
03:19 - uh so let's take our unit variable and
03:21 - i'm going to reassign it after using the
03:24 - two
03:24 - upper function and then pass in our unit
03:27 - to make it uppercase and now if i type
03:30 - in lowercase c or lowercase f
03:33 - this user input will be made uppercase
03:36 - the temp is currently in c
03:38 - so this is optional but i thought it'd
03:40 - be a good thing to add to this program
03:42 - now what we'll work on next depending on
03:45 - the unit there's going to be a different
03:48 - formula a different calculation now we
03:50 - will need the user to enter in the
03:52 - current temperature
03:54 - so let's begin with our if statement if
03:56 - unit is equal to c
03:58 - celsius
04:00 - enter
04:01 - the
04:02 - temp
04:03 - in celsius
04:06 - this time we are accepting a floating
04:08 - point number
04:10 - we will use scanf the format specifier
04:13 - for floating point numbers
04:16 - address of operator
04:18 - temp
04:19 - and then we need to calculate the new
04:21 - temperature after it's converted from
04:23 - celsius to fahrenheit and we will
04:25 - reassign it into the same variable temp
04:28 - temp equals and here's the formula temp
04:32 - times
04:33 - 9 divided by 5
04:36 - plus 32
04:40 - and then let's print the temperature
04:43 - print f
04:46 - the
04:47 - temp
04:49 - in
04:50 - fahrenheit
04:53 - is
04:55 - and i'm going to use a format specifier
04:58 - percent f but i would only like to
05:00 - display one digit after the decimal so i
05:03 - will add dot one
05:05 - and then we will insert our temperature
05:08 - temp okay let's try this enter the
05:11 - temperature in f or c currently we only
05:13 - have the celsius portion set up
05:16 - so see
05:18 - enter the temp in celsius
05:21 - how about zero degrees celsius
05:25 - the temp in fahrenheit is 32.0
05:28 - okay so we know that it's working let's
05:30 - fill out our else if statement else if
05:33 - unit is equal to f
05:36 - and let's copy some of this
05:39 - enter the temp in
05:41 - fahrenheit
05:43 - we will reassign our temperature
05:44 - variable
05:46 - temp equals
05:48 - and here's the formula
05:50 - temp minus 32
05:54 - times five
05:55 - and we will divide all of this by nine
06:00 - [Music]
06:02 - then let's display the temperature in
06:04 - celsius
06:07 - the temp
06:09 - in celsius is our format specifier then
06:13 - the temp variable is the temperature in
06:16 - f or c this time it is in fahrenheit
06:20 - enter the temp in fahrenheit
06:22 - so 32 degrees in fahrenheit should
06:25 - translate to zero degrees celsius
06:28 - which it is
06:29 - so yeah everybody i thought that would
06:31 - be a useful practice program for us to
06:33 - get used to accepting user input
06:35 - i'll post all of this code from this
06:37 - program in the comments section down
06:39 - below if you would like a copy
06:41 - so if you found this video helpful you
06:42 - can help me out by smashing that like
