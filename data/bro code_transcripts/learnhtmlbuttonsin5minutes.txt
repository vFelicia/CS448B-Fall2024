00:00 - hello again everybody today I'm going to
00:01 - show you how we can create a button
00:03 - using HTML and a little CSS to create a
00:07 - button we need a pair of button tags
00:12 - and here's our button it's really small
00:14 - and it doesn't do anything let's add
00:16 - some text between the button tags let's
00:18 - add some text like click me
00:22 - so here's our button but it's fairly
00:24 - small we can change the size of this
00:26 - button by changing the font size we will
00:29 - need to access the style attribute then
00:31 - set the font size property to a larger
00:33 - font size so font Dash size
00:37 - 25 pixels is good
00:40 - the size of our button will adjust
00:42 - accordingly
00:43 - let's change the background color
00:46 - separate each of these CSS properties
00:48 - with a semicolon let's change the
00:51 - background Dash color to be Gray
00:56 - so that's how to change the background
00:57 - color
00:59 - to change the font color type color
01:01 - colon then some color like light blue
01:06 - you can round the corners by setting a
01:09 - border radius
01:10 - so that's another CSS property
01:13 - border Dash radius
01:16 - colon
01:17 - let's begin with five
01:19 - that will Round the Corner slightly you
01:22 - can increase the amount of pixels for a
01:24 - more rounded border
01:26 - let's try 25. that's not too bad
01:30 - so this button currently doesn't do
01:32 - anything what I'm going to do is turn
01:34 - this button into a hyperlink when we
01:37 - click on the button it will take us to
01:38 - maybe Google
01:40 - we need to surround our button with a
01:42 - pair of a tags
01:46 - I will set the href attribute equal to
01:50 - some URL like Google
01:55 - so when I click on the button it takes
01:58 - me to Google
01:59 - or if we had another HTML file we can go
02:02 - there too I'll create a new HTML file
02:04 - named maybe page two page2.html
02:12 - let's generate some HTML in vs code to
02:15 - do that type an exclamation point then
02:17 - tab all I'm going to add to page 2 is an
02:20 - H1 header tag
02:22 - with the title of this is page number
02:25 - two
02:27 - I'll set the href attribute to B
02:30 - the name of that HTML file page2.html
02:36 - page two dot HTML
02:39 - when I click on the button it brings me
02:42 - to my second page
02:43 - I haven't discussed JavaScript yet but
02:45 - we can have a button execute some
02:47 - JavaScript code this part of the lesson
02:50 - is outside the scope of what I would
02:52 - normally teach at this point in time but
02:54 - if you're interested here's a little bit
02:56 - of JavaScript again it's not necessary
02:58 - to learn this at this level if you would
03:00 - like to execute some JavaScript code
03:02 - using a button we need a pair of script
03:04 - tags for JavaScript
03:06 - together
03:08 - within this pair of script Tags I'm
03:10 - going to define a function function you
03:13 - can come up with some function name
03:15 - this function will do something then you
03:19 - need a set of parentheses then a set of
03:20 - curly braces
03:23 - buttons have an on click attribute
03:26 - we can have the button do something if
03:28 - it's interacted with
03:30 - the on click attribute is going to be
03:32 - the name of my function do something
03:36 - when we click on the button execute this
03:39 - function what do we want to do
03:41 - I'll change some text on the screen
03:44 - but we'll need some sample text to work
03:46 - with
03:47 - I'll create a pair of paragraph tags
03:50 - let's say hello
03:52 - within our JavaScript function we'll
03:55 - change the text of whatever's between
03:57 - these two paragraph tags but we need an
04:00 - ID there's an ID attribute
04:03 - I'll name this text maybe greeting
04:07 - so when we click on this function I
04:10 - would like to change the text of my
04:12 - greeting
04:13 - within the function we can do that with
04:15 - document dot get element
04:20 - by ID
04:23 - within the set of parentheses the ID is
04:26 - greeting
04:28 - follow this with DOT inner HTML then we
04:33 - can set the SQL to some new value
04:35 - let's set the new value to be good bye
04:40 - now when I click on the button it
04:43 - changes our text
04:45 - so that's a button everybody
04:46 - you need a pair of button tags you can
04:49 - apply some CSS styling I haven't really
04:52 - discussed CSS yet so we did inline CSS
04:56 - but if you have these many properties I
04:58 - would recommend a style sheet which
05:00 - we'll cover later to make your button
05:01 - bigger you can change the font size you
05:04 - could have your button bring you to
05:05 - another HTML page or even execute some
05:08 - JavaScript code and well everybody
05:10 - that's how to create a button using HTML
