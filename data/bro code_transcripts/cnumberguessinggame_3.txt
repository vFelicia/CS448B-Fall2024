00:00 - hey everyone it's you bro hope you're
00:01 - doing well and in this video we're going
00:03 - to create a
00:04 - number guessing game in c sharp so sit
00:07 - back
00:07 - relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - all right let's create a number guessing
00:13 - game we will randomly generate some
00:15 - random number between
00:16 - a set minimum and maximum and we will
00:19 - let the user guess as to what the number
00:21 - is
00:22 - if the number is too high or too low we
00:24 - will give a hint
00:25 - and the user can keep on guessing and
00:27 - we'll keep track of how many attempts it
00:28 - takes
00:29 - so we'll need a random object to
00:32 - generate some random numbers
00:33 - random random equals new random and
00:36 - there's a few other things we'll declare
00:38 - as well at the top
00:39 - boolean play again
00:42 - so if the user would like to play again
00:45 - we can keep this as true
00:46 - if they would like to quit we can set
00:48 - this to be false
00:50 - int min this will be the minimum value
00:53 - let's have the user guess a number
00:55 - between one and one
00:57 - int max but you can feel free to adjust
01:00 - these
01:01 - max equals 100 and
01:05 - guess i will declare this but not yet
01:07 - assign a value
01:09 - and number
01:13 - and int guesses
01:16 - okay we'll create a while loop and we
01:18 - will let the user decide if they would
01:20 - like to play again
01:22 - so our condition while play again
01:25 - equals true but since this itself is a
01:28 - boolean variable you don't technically
01:30 - need
01:30 - this equals true portion you could just
01:33 - say while play again
01:34 - because this by itself would evaluate to
01:37 - be true or
01:37 - false now if our user decides they would
01:40 - like to play again we should probably
01:42 - reset everything
01:43 - so let's take our guess and set this
01:47 - equal to zero
01:49 - guesses this is the number of attempts
01:52 - that equals zero as well and let's
01:54 - generate a
01:55 - new random number number equals random
01:59 - dot next and within the parenthesis of
02:03 - the next method we can list our minimum
02:05 - and
02:06 - maximum but remember that this number is
02:08 - exclusive
02:09 - but since we have these variables we can
02:11 - place these here instead
02:12 - so min and max so this should be max
02:16 - plus one
02:17 - this will generate a random number
02:19 - between one and one hundred because like
02:21 - i said
02:22 - this number is exclusive okay then
02:25 - we will keep on asking the user to type
02:28 - in a number like guess again
02:29 - so we'll need a nested while loop while
02:33 - and our condition is guess
02:36 - does not equal our number that is
02:40 - randomly generated
02:41 - so let's ask the user to type in a
02:44 - number
02:47 - guess a number
02:50 - between
02:54 - and this next part is going to get a
02:55 - little funky plus
02:58 - min plus i'll add a dash
03:02 - plus max
03:05 - plus a colon
03:09 - okay then we will take variable guess
03:14 - equals and we'll need to convert some
03:16 - user input convert
03:18 - to int 32 and within the parentheses
03:24 - console dot read line
03:30 - all right then we will display whatever
03:32 - our guess is
03:34 - console.writeline
03:37 - guess colon space plus
03:40 - guess and now we need to check our guess
03:44 - versus the number and we can use
03:47 - an if else if statement
03:50 - if and the condition is
03:54 - guess is greater than number
03:58 - we will display a hint console that
04:01 - right line
04:04 - let's say that guess
04:07 - plus is too
04:12 - high
04:14 - elsif
04:18 - and the condition is guess
04:21 - is less than number
04:24 - let's copy this guess is
04:28 - too low and then
04:31 - if guess equals number we escape the
04:34 - while loop
04:35 - oh and we do need to increment our
04:37 - guesses by one
04:38 - after each guess so let's place that
04:42 - right about here right before we
04:46 - do another iteration of our while loop
04:48 - guesses
04:49 - plus plus to increment our guesses by
04:52 - one
04:53 - now when we exit the while loop that
04:55 - means that we eventually got the right
04:57 - number
04:58 - so we will display the number with a
05:00 - writeline statement
05:01 - console dot rightline number
05:05 - colon space plus
05:08 - number then we will display
05:11 - you win console.writeline
05:15 - you win
05:18 - and let's display how many guesses it
05:20 - took how many attempts
05:22 - guesses colon space plus
05:26 - guesses then we should probably
05:30 - let the user decide if they would like
05:31 - to play again and actually let's declare
05:33 - one more variable
05:35 - string response
05:38 - and then we will assign this within the
05:41 - while loop
05:42 - let's do that here we'll reset it
05:46 - response equals an empty string
05:52 - okay then we'll have the user type in if
05:55 - they would like to play again
05:58 - would you like to play
06:01 - again y slash n
06:05 - so they would have to type in either y
06:07 - or n y to play again
06:09 - for yes and for no
06:12 - response equals
06:16 - console dot read
06:19 - line
06:22 - and let's make this uppercase in case
06:25 - they type in something that's lowercase
06:27 - response equals response dot 2
06:32 - upper
06:35 - so if our response
06:40 - is equal to a capital y
06:44 - play again equals true
06:49 - else play again
06:53 - equals false then when we
06:57 - escape our outer while loop that means
06:59 - we are done playing this game
07:01 - so let's find where that ends right here
07:05 - okay let's say thanks for playing oh it
07:07 - looks like i typed that already
07:09 - so just type this in i guess all right
07:14 - we're good so let's run this
07:17 - guess a number between 1 and 100 what
07:20 - about 50 that's right in the middle
07:21 - right
07:22 - 50 is too high what about 25 25 is too
07:26 - high what about 12
07:27 - 12 is too high this is a very low number
07:30 - i guess
07:31 - what about six six is too high g's all
07:33 - right
07:34 - three three is too low our number is
07:36 - between three
07:37 - and six how about four
07:41 - four is too low five all right finally
07:44 - so it took seven guesses let's play
07:46 - again i think i can do better
07:49 - guess a number between one and 100 let's
07:51 - go with 50 again
07:52 - 50 is too low so something between 50
07:56 - and 100 let's go with 75
07:58 - 75 is too high uh what about
08:03 - 63
08:05 - 63 is too high uh 57
08:10 - 57 is too low how about 60.
08:14 - all right 60. that took five guesses
08:16 - this time
08:17 - would you like to play again no thanks
08:20 - for playing
08:21 - well everybody that was a very simple
08:24 - number guessing game in csharp
08:25 - i'll post all of this code to the
08:27 - comment section down below if you would
08:29 - like a copy for yourself
08:30 - if you can give this video a thumbs up
08:32 - feel free to drop a random comment down
08:34 - below
08:34 - and well that is a very simple number
08:37 - guessing game
08:38 - in c sharp
