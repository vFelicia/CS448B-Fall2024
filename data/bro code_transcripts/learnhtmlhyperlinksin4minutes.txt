00:00 - hey everybody in today's topic I'm going
00:02 - to show you how we can create hyperlinks
00:03 - a hyperlink is a digital reference to
00:06 - data that a user can follow by clicking
00:08 - or tapping a button or link to create a
00:11 - hyperlink we will need a pair of a tags
00:13 - a means anchor then we'll sandwich some
00:17 - text between these two tags
00:19 - such as click me
00:21 - we're missing one thing what we'll need
00:24 - within the opening a tag is an attribute
00:26 - an href attribute
00:29 - an attribute is typically a name value
00:32 - pair that modifies the behavior of an
00:35 - element href means hypertext reference
00:38 - we're referencing something within the
00:40 - set of quotes we can list a web page or
00:43 - a file to link to let's begin by linking
00:46 - an external website like Google
00:49 - let's paste the URL within the href
00:52 - attribute save then when I click on this
00:55 - link it takes me to Google or some other
00:58 - website of your choosing based on what's
01:00 - within the set of quotes
01:02 - there are more attributes you can add as
01:03 - well they're optional another is Target
01:06 - Target equals if you set Target to be
01:10 - underscore blank this link will open
01:13 - this URL in either a new tab or a new
01:16 - window depending on your settings Google
01:18 - has opened in a new tab for me
01:20 - another attribute is title
01:23 - the title attribute displays additional
01:25 - information about the element as a tool
01:27 - tip I'll add a message
01:29 - goes to Google when I hover over this
01:33 - link we have a tooltip that states goes
01:36 - to Google that's an additional option
01:38 - too this URL is an absolute URL you can
01:42 - also list a relative URL So based on the
01:44 - last video we have an HTML file of song
01:47 - lyrics within our index file we will
01:50 - link to our lyrics file so let's create
01:52 - another hyperlink we'll need a pair of a
01:54 - tags meaning anchor
01:56 - we'll need some text
01:58 - song lyrics is good
02:01 - then we'll need an hrep attribute href
02:04 - equals these two files are right next to
02:07 - each other for a relative file path all
02:09 - we need is the file name
02:11 - lyrics dot HTML I'm going to add a line
02:15 - break real quick
02:17 - PR meaning line break
02:19 - then when I click on this link it takes
02:21 - me to my other HTML file
02:24 - you could add these additional
02:25 - attributes if you would like one last
02:27 - link
02:28 - I'll create a line break we'll create a
02:31 - link that begins the process of emailing
02:33 - someone
02:34 - we'll need a pair of a tags
02:37 - the text will be email me
02:41 - href attribute will be set to now to
02:44 - send an email type mail to colon then an
02:48 - email address I'll make up one test at
02:51 - fake.com
02:54 - when I click on this link we begin the
02:56 - process of sending an email to this
02:59 - email address however I'm not signed in
03:01 - so this is as far as it'll take me
03:03 - currently
03:04 - okay now for an exercise let's go to our
03:07 - lyrics HTML file
03:09 - open with live server let me zoom out
03:13 - based on the last project you should
03:16 - have a web page with some song lyrics
03:17 - that you like we'll create a hyperlink
03:19 - to the original video let's do that
03:21 - after the artist that would be right
03:24 - here but before the horizontal rule
03:26 - we'll create a pair of a tags
03:31 - I'll add some text or original video
03:35 - then you'll need to find the url for the
03:38 - original video for your song
03:41 - all right
03:43 - I will set the href attribute to be
03:46 - that URL the URL for a YouTube video
03:50 - so when I click on the link
03:52 - it now takes me to YouTube
03:55 - all right everybody that's a hyperlink
03:57 - it's a digital reference to data that a
03:59 - user can follow by clicking or tapping a
04:02 - button or link and those are hyperlinks
04:04 - in HTML
