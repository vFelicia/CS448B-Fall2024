00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
00:02 - hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to explain
00:04 - why loops in python so sit back
00:07 - relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:13 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:16 - help keep this channel running
00:18 - so while loops a while loop is a
00:21 - statement that will execute its block of
00:23 - code
00:24 - as long as its condition remains true
00:26 - later on in this video
00:28 - for this example we're going to create a
00:30 - program where we will prompt a user to
00:32 - enter their name
00:33 - if they attempt to skip that prompt then
00:35 - we will continually ask the user to
00:37 - enter their name
00:38 - and they can't continue on with the rest
00:39 - of the program until they do so the key
00:41 - thing to keep in mind with while loops
00:43 - is that you'll want some way to
00:44 - eventually escape the while loop if you
00:46 - don't have any way to escape the while
00:48 - loop that's referred to as an
00:49 - infinite loop so let's create an example
00:52 - of an infinite loop
00:53 - because it's fun so to create a while
00:54 - loop type while and then some sort of
00:56 - condition
00:57 - so for our condition let's say while one
00:59 - is equal to one
01:00 - so this will always be true now what do
01:02 - we want to do
01:03 - when we execute this block of code let's
01:05 - print something
01:06 - print help i'm
01:10 - stuck in a loop
01:13 - all right so let's try this while one is
01:15 - equal to one
01:16 - print this statement
01:19 - and we will just continue on and on
01:21 - within this while loop
01:22 - because we have no way to escape this
01:24 - while loop so now let's use this concept
01:27 - and write
01:27 - a program where we will prompt a user to
01:30 - type in their name
01:31 - if they don't type in anything then we
01:33 - will continue to prompt them to type in
01:34 - at least something
01:36 - so let's say name is equal to
01:39 - and then to just keep this blank we'll
01:40 - just set this to a set of quotes
01:43 - and then let's write a while loop here
01:45 - while name
01:46 - and let's check the length of name if
01:49 - the length
01:50 - of our name is equal to zero
01:54 - then we will ask the user to type in
01:56 - their name name
01:58 - equals input
02:01 - enter your name
02:04 - so then once we escape the while loop
02:06 - let's print something print
02:09 - hello plus name oops
02:13 - hello plus name all right so when i run
02:15 - this we are giving the user
02:17 - a way to escape the while loop they have
02:18 - to type in something for their name
02:20 - as long as the length of my name is
02:23 - equal to zero
02:24 - keep on printing this prompt enter your
02:27 - name
02:27 - so i'm just going to hit enter a bunch
02:29 - of times enter your name
02:30 - no enter your name no enter your name no
02:34 - so we are stuck within this loop until
02:35 - we enter something for our name
02:37 - so this time let me type in a name then
02:40 - hit enter
02:41 - so therefore our condition is now false
02:43 - the length
02:44 - of my name is now one two three so
02:47 - three is not equal to zero therefore our
02:49 - while statement
02:50 - our while loop is false and we continue
02:52 - on with the rest of the program there
02:54 - are a few variations in which you could
02:55 - write the same program
02:57 - so let's write this a different way what
02:59 - we could do is say
03:00 - name is equal to none while
03:04 - not name and this will pretty much do
03:07 - the same thing it's just another way of
03:09 - writing this
03:10 - well everybody that's the basics of
03:12 - while loops a while loop is a statement
03:14 - that will execute
03:15 - its block of code as long as its
03:17 - condition
03:18 - remains true for our example we asked
03:20 - the user to type in their name
03:22 - if they were to leave it empty or blank
03:24 - we would keep on asking the user to type
03:26 - in their name
03:27 - so if you would like a copy of this code
03:28 - i will post this in the comments section
03:30 - down below
03:31 - but yeah that's the basics of while
03:33 - loops in python
03:35 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
03:37 - learned something new
03:38 - then help me help you in three easy
03:41 - steps
03:41 - by smashing that like button drop a
