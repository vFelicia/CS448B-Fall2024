00:01 - well okay then everybody we gotta talk
00:04 - about structs a struct is a structure
00:07 - that groups related variables under one
00:10 - name think of an array an array can
00:12 - store multiple values of the same data
00:15 - type well a struct can store multiple
00:17 - values of different data types we can
00:20 - store strings along with ins doubles
00:22 - booleans etc to create a struct let's do
00:25 - so outside of the main function
00:27 - type struct
00:29 - then we need an identifier this is kind
00:32 - of like the data type suppose we're
00:34 - going to group related variables for
00:36 - students
00:38 - i'll name this identifier student
00:40 - within the structure of student
00:42 - variables that we declare are known as
00:45 - members i think each student should have
00:47 - a name member this will be of the string
00:49 - data type string name
00:51 - i'll declare this but not yet assign it
00:53 - as well as a gpa that could be of the
00:55 - double data type
00:58 - then a boolean variable if they're
01:00 - currently enrolled or not
01:03 - enrolled
01:04 - then be sure to instruct with a
01:06 - semicolon our struct student is kind of
01:09 - like its own data type we can use this
01:11 - data type to declare variables i'll
01:13 - create a student variable of this data
01:15 - type and that variable will have these
01:17 - three different members a name a gpa and
01:20 - a boolean variable for being enrolled
01:22 - much like with creating a variable we
01:24 - type the data type student and then some
01:27 - name some identifier let's name the
01:29 - first student student one
01:32 - student one will have its own name gpa
01:35 - and enrolled status if i would like to
01:37 - assign the name member of student one i
01:40 - would type
01:41 - the name of the student student one
01:43 - followed by dot members can be accessed
01:45 - with a dot also known as the class
01:48 - member axis operator i'll assign the
01:51 - name member and set the sequel to
01:53 - spongebob
01:55 - i'll assign student one's gpa
01:59 - student1.gpa i'll give spongebob a solid
02:01 - 3.2 then i could set his enrolled status
02:06 - student1 dot enrolled
02:09 - i'll set this to be true
02:11 - then we could access these members i'll
02:13 - display them
02:14 - standard output
02:17 - student1 dot name
02:20 - i'll add a new line
02:24 - let's do the same thing with gpa and
02:27 - enrolled
02:28 - student1.gpa student1.enrolled
02:32 - this is what this looks like we have a
02:34 - student variable the name member is
02:36 - spongebob spongebob has a gpa of 3.2
02:40 - when accessing boolean variables one
02:42 - corresponds with true zero corresponds
02:45 - with false enrolled is set to true so
02:47 - that would return one let's reuse the
02:50 - struct to create a second student
02:52 - i'll just copy what we have here
02:54 - then paste it
02:57 - we'll give the second student a
02:58 - different identifier such as student two
03:03 - student two will have a name member of
03:05 - patrick
03:07 - a gpa of 2.1
03:10 - and he will be enrolled that's set to
03:12 - true
03:14 - let's display student two's members
03:18 - student2.name student2.gpa
03:21 - then student2.enrolled
03:24 - these first members correspond with
03:25 - student1 spongebob 3.2 one for true
03:30 - the second set is for student two
03:32 - patrick has a gpa of 2.1 and patrick is
03:35 - currently enrolled okay one last example
03:37 - let's create student three
03:40 - let's copy what we have paste it
03:43 - student student student3
03:46 - student3.name
03:47 - student3.gpa student3.enrolled
03:50 - student 3's name will be squidward
03:54 - squidward has a gpa of 1.5
03:57 - let's set enrolled to be false then
04:00 - display student three's members
04:04 - student3.name student3.gpa
04:07 - student3.enrolled
04:10 - and here are student 3's members
04:12 - squidward 1.5 and 0 that means false now
04:17 - with members you can set a default value
04:19 - i'll set enrolled to be true
04:22 - then we don't need to explicitly state
04:24 - that
04:28 - underneath spongebob patrick and
04:29 - squidward their enrolled member is all
04:31 - set to 1. with members you can set a
04:34 - default value so yeah those are structs
04:36 - it's a structure that groups related
04:39 - variables under one name structs can
04:41 - contain many different data types
04:43 - variables in a struct are known as
04:45 - members and members can be accessed with
04:48 - a dot the class member access operator
04:51 - so those are structs your assignment is
04:53 - to post a struct in the comments section
04:55 - down below and well yeah those are
04:57 - strucks in c plus plus
