00:01 - bro hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to teach you
00:04 - guys how we can create an array of
00:06 - objects in java so sit back relax and
00:08 - enjoy the show

00:21 - alright guys and gals in this video i'm
00:23 - going to be explaining how we can create
00:25 - an array of objects
00:27 - now here's a few examples of arrays that
00:29 - we've worked on in the past
00:31 - so the standard formula or steps to
00:33 - creating an array
00:34 - is to type in the data type that we're
00:37 - working with
00:38 - a name for this array equals new the
00:41 - data type again
00:42 - and then a size if you don't plan on
00:44 - assigning values right away from the
00:46 - beginning when you declare this
00:48 - so we have an array of integers an array
00:51 - of characters and an array of strings
00:53 - so what if we wanted to create an array
00:55 - of objects
00:56 - for example i have a class called food
00:59 - we're going to be storing some food
01:01 - objects within an array so following
01:04 - these simple steps
01:05 - let's begin creating an array of objects
01:08 - so we begin by typing in
01:09 - the name of the data type that we are
01:11 - working with the name of the data type
01:13 - that we are working with
01:14 - is food for this example so we're going
01:17 - to type in food
01:18 - followed by a set of straight braces and
01:21 - then we need a name for this array
01:23 - so we could call this foods but i don't
01:26 - think that would make too much sense
01:28 - so let's pretend that we're placing food
01:30 - in a
01:31 - refrigerator
01:34 - equals new the data type again which is
01:37 - food
01:38 - and then a size if we do not plan on
01:41 - assigning values right away
01:43 - so let's say that this refrigerator can
01:45 - hold three
01:46 - food items so we now have an array
01:49 - that can hold some food objects for us
01:52 - now let's create some food objects
01:54 - so let's do this after we create our
01:56 - array called refrigerator
01:58 - so let's create three foods to store
02:01 - within this refrigerator
02:02 - so we type in the name of the class
02:04 - which is food
02:06 - let's call this food one equals new
02:09 - food and let's set up the constructor of
02:13 - our food class so it's the same name as
02:15 - the class
02:17 - and let's say we want to set up a
02:19 - parameter for a name
02:21 - string name this dot name
02:24 - equals name and then we need to declare
02:27 - this outside the constructor
02:29 - string name so when we create a food we
02:31 - need to pass in
02:32 - a name so for food one let's say that
02:36 - this is pizza it will create a food
02:40 - 2 item and a food 3 item
02:44 - let's say food 2 will be a hamburger
02:47 - we'll pass that in as an argument
02:49 - and food three will be a hot dog so we
02:52 - now have
02:53 - three food items now we are going to
02:56 - store
02:56 - these food items in our array of food
03:00 - objects our refrigerator as we call it
03:02 - so
03:03 - in order to do that we type in the name
03:05 - of the array
03:06 - followed by an index so this always
03:09 - begins at zero because
03:11 - computers always start with zero so
03:14 - our refrigerator at index zero let's
03:16 - store
03:17 - food item number one which is our pizza
03:21 - and for index one we'll store
03:24 - food two and index two
03:28 - will store food three and for practice
03:31 - let's attempt to access one of these
03:33 - elements of our
03:34 - array of food objects called
03:36 - refrigerator and display it to the
03:37 - console window
03:38 - so we can do that with a print line
03:40 - statement and let's attempt to
03:42 - access whatever food object is at index
03:45 - zero
03:47 - so refrigerator index zero and let's see
03:50 - what happens
03:52 - now remember that this returns the array
03:55 - of where this object is
03:56 - in your computer's memory so this is the
03:58 - address of where
03:59 - food 1 is located in memory what i'm
04:02 - trying to do
04:03 - is access the name variable of our food
04:05 - object
04:06 - so i'm going to tack on dot
04:09 - name to the end of this because we have
04:11 - a name variable for all of our food
04:14 - objects
04:14 - so this will print the name of whatever
04:18 - food is in element number zero of our
04:20 - refrigerator
04:21 - which is pizza and we can do the same
04:24 - process for the other elements too
04:26 - so i'm going to print element number one
04:30 - as well as element number two so if we
04:32 - were to take a look at all of the
04:34 - elements within our refrigerator
04:36 - we have pizza a hamburger and a hot dog
04:40 - now there's another way of writing this
04:42 - too instead of declaring our array of
04:44 - food objects called refrigerator and
04:46 - setting a memory size
04:48 - this time we're going to declare our
04:50 - array of food objects
04:52 - and assign all of these values right
04:54 - away so after we create
04:56 - our food objects let's declare and
04:58 - assign these values
04:59 - to our array of food objects so we type
05:02 - in the name of the data type
05:04 - followed by a name refrigerator equals
05:07 - and then within curly braces all of the
05:10 - values that we would like to add
05:12 - we would like to add food 1 food 2 and
05:14 - food 3.
05:17 - and we do not need these lines anymore
05:20 - so we can take these out
05:22 - and this will do the exact same thing
05:24 - but we changed the order of these steps
05:26 - around
05:27 - so that's the basics of arrays of
05:30 - objects in java if you'd like a copy of
05:32 - all this code i will post all of this in
05:34 - the comments down below
05:35 - but yeah that's the basics of arrays of
05:38 - objects in java
05:40 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
05:43 - learn something new
05:44 - then you can help me help you in three
05:47 - easy steps
