00:00 - what's going on everybody it's bro here
00:02 - hope you're doing well and in this video
00:03 - I'm going to teach you guys about inner
00:05 - classes in Java yes it is legal to have
00:08 - classes inside of other classes let's
00:10 - get into it if you find this video
00:14 - helpful please remember to Like comment
00:17 - and subscribe
00:18 - your support will help keep this channel
00:20 - running everyone we're gonna be
00:22 - discussing inner classes what this is is
00:25 - that an inner class is basically a class
00:27 - inside of another class it's kind of
00:30 - like that lesson on nested loops how you
00:32 - can have loops inside of other loops but
00:35 - in this case you can also have classes
00:37 - inside of other classes and this is
00:39 - useful if an inner class should be
00:41 - limited in its scope
00:42 - they're usually set to private but
00:44 - that's not always necessary and one of
00:47 - the reasons that we use inner classes is
00:48 - because it helps group classes that
00:51 - belong together and I would say that
00:53 - this is extremely useful for listeners
00:55 - for handling specific events and I would
00:58 - say that this is a necessary lesson when
01:01 - we move on to the next video on
01:02 - anonymous inner classes where we're
01:04 - actually going to be creating some
01:06 - customized action listeners so let's
01:08 - begin we have a main class here let's
01:10 - also create another class so I'm going
01:12 - to click on my source folder go to file
01:14 - new class and let's call this class
01:17 - outside and then click finish and then
01:22 - within our class outside we're going to
01:24 - create another class
01:25 - we'll make it public but we don't have
01:27 - to public class and we'll call this next
01:30 - class inside the inside class is going
01:33 - to be inside of the outside class now
01:36 - let's assign some variables so how about
01:38 - we create a string string x equals the
01:41 - word hello and I'll add a space after
01:44 - this and we'll also create a variable
01:47 - within our inside class we'll call this
01:50 - string y equals world now going back to
01:58 - our main class we can instantiate an
02:00 - instance of our outside class and our
02:03 - inside class well let's begin with our
02:05 - outside class so I'll type the name of
02:07 - the class outside and we'll call this
02:10 - instance just out equals new
02:14 - outside alright so we have an instance
02:18 - of our outside class and it's called out
02:20 - now we can also instantiate an instance
02:23 - of the inside class the inner class of
02:26 - the outside class and in order to do
02:28 - this this is what we're gonna do we
02:30 - first need to type in the name of the
02:33 - outside class that's acting as the
02:35 - container so we're going to type outside
02:37 - dot and then the name of the inner class
02:40 - and it's actually right here if you have
02:42 - intellisense setup so outside dot inside
02:45 - which is the name of the inner class and
02:47 - we will call this instance maybe in
02:51 - equals then type in the name of the
02:54 - instance of the outer class out dot new
02:59 - then the name of the inner class again
03:01 - inside parentheses semicolon so now what
03:05 - we have here is an instance of the
03:06 - outside class out and an instance of the
03:09 - inner class in so let's actually access
03:12 - these variables x and y so we're going
03:15 - to put these within a print line
03:16 - statement so we're going to type system
03:18 - dot out dot print line if we want to
03:20 - access X what we're gonna type is the
03:23 - name of the instance of the outside
03:25 - class so that's out dot X then we'll add
03:30 - plus then now we want to access this Y
03:33 - variable which is in the inner class so
03:36 - what we're gonna type here is the name
03:37 - of the instance of the inner class so in
03:40 - dot Y so now if we were to run this it
03:44 - displays hello world now we can actually
03:47 - access a method from an inner class so
03:50 - let's create a greeting method so we'll
03:54 - make this public public void greeting
03:58 - and all will do here is display our
04:04 - print light statement so I'm going to
04:06 - copy this and move it and then we can
04:11 - get rid of out dot and in dot we can
04:15 - just display X&Y so let's try this again
04:19 - and this time we actually need to call
04:22 - the method of the inside class so we're
04:25 - going to type in the name of the inside
04:27 - class
04:27 - which is in dot and use the greeting
04:30 - function that we just made and if we
04:33 - were to run this we can now access a
04:35 - method that's inside of an inner class
04:37 - all right well that's the basics of
04:40 - inner classes and in the next video
04:41 - we're going to discuss anonymous inner
04:43 - classes which are extremely useful for
04:46 - listeners for handling specific events
04:49 - but yeah that's the basics of inner
04:51 - classes in Java hey you yeah I'm talking
04:55 - to you if you learn something new then
04:57 - you can help me help you in three easy
