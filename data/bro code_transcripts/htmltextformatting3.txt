00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
bro here and in this video what I think
00:04 - we're gonna do is cover text formatting
in HTML let's get into it
00:10 - so change of plans I said in the last
video we will be covering fonts but I'm
00:14 - thinking we will save that for later
when we get closer to CSS what I'll be
00:18 - doing for this video is teaching you
guys from basic text formatting
00:21 - techniques
this will include formatting elements
00:23 - such as bold italic underline and even
marked which can highlight text which is
00:29 - pretty cool I would say so this will be
a shorter lesson and I will showcase
00:33 - many of the formatting elements that are
actually available to you in HTML so
00:37 - let's begin by adding some normal text
to the screen here so we'll say this is
00:41 - normal text so do you know when you're
conducting a science experiment you
00:46 - usually have some sort of control which
you don't actually perform any tests on
00:50 - or changes this is kind of like our
controls this will be just some normal
00:54 - text that's not formatted so let's save
this refresh the page and it just says
00:58 - this is some normal text here but we'll
probably also want to add a line break
01:03 - afterwards just so we can move down to
the next line as if we were hitting
01:06 - Enter so just type in be are within
angle brackets and based on the last
01:10 - lesson that is the tag for a line break
so let's go down to the next line we
01:15 - have the bold tag so we'll say this is
bold text now you put the letter B with
01:24 - an angle brackets and surround whatever
you want to be bold so make sure you
01:29 - have an opening tag and a closing tag so
it says this is bold text and then let's
01:36 - add a line break just because we want to
go down to the next line so let's save
01:41 - this refresh the page and it says this
is bold text and whatever we surrounded
01:47 - with the bold tag this text is now bold
compared to the rest of the text and you
01:52 - can compare that to the normal text that
we have at the top here whatever we have
01:56 - surrounded with the bold tags is now
bold and it's going to be the same
01:59 - process with italic tags too so we'll
say this is italic text and then add a
02:07 - line break all right so then we will put
I within angle brackets and then we need
02:14 - to close this save it
refresh the page this is italic text so
02:21 - are you guys starting to see a pattern
here
02:22 - I promise
I'll cover some more interesting text
02:25 - formatting elements too I have maybe
about ten or so to cover so let's cover
02:30 - subscripts so this is sub script text so
whatever you want to be a subscript just
02:39 - type in su be with an angle brackets and
on this line the text is slightly
02:48 - smaller and it's moved down
there's also superscript think of it
02:53 - like an exponent this is super script
text and you're gonna type in sup like
03:03 - you're saying sup Tier one your friends
so this is super script text so it's
03:10 - slightly smaller and it's like moved
upwards all right then there is small
03:17 - text this is small text this one's
fairly simple you just type in small
03:26 - within angle brackets and then close it
this is small text guess what there's
03:34 - also big big elements so big this is big
text and then line break yep and the
03:48 - word big is slightly bigger than the
rest of the text we also have inserted
03:55 - text this is inserted I can't spell
inserted text then you type i ns within
04:06 - angle brackets so this will give it the
appearance of being underlined all right
04:18 - there's also deleted text so this is
deleted text then you type in de L
04:27 - within angle brackets
04:36 - and this will put a align through the
text that is deleted okay and lastly
04:42 - this one's my favorite this is marked
text this is a marked text so we're
04:52 - going to put the word mark with an angle
brackets and then a closing tag so what
04:57 - this will do is that this will highlight
something as if you're using a
05:00 - highlighter which i think is pretty cool
so you just use the mark tag for that
05:06 - so with these text formatting elements
you'll want to be sure that you're also
05:09 - including a closing tag wherever you
want the formatting to end because look
05:13 - what happens if I forget to close the
bold formatting tag so I'm going to take
05:18 - that out save it and refresh this page
you can now see that everything where
05:23 - this tag started is now bold so you want
to be sure to put a closing tag wherever
05:28 - you want the effect of this tag to end
for example we wanted to end after this
05:33 - bold tag but you can place this wherever
you want but I'm saying that if you
05:38 - forget to close it the rest of the text
that comes after this opening tag is
05:43 - going to be affected by it so make sure
to close these tags when appropriate
05:47 - actually I'm curious as to what this
looks like what if I move the opening
05:51 - tag for the mark text formatting element
to the very beginning and the closing at
05:58 - the very end I wonder what this looks
like oh yeah
06:02 - that's kind of cool everything's
highlighted it's kind of like in school
06:05 - or college if there is an entire
paragraph that you have to highlight
06:09 - this is kind of what that reminds me of
so that could have some uses that's kind
06:13 - of cool
all right well that's some of the basics
06:15 - of text formatting elements in HTML I'll
post the code that I have in the
06:20 - comments down below but yeah that is
everything you need to know to get
06:25 - started with text formatting in HTML
