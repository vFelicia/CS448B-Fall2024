00:00 - hey how's it going everybody in today's
00:02 - video I'm going to explain borders in
00:04 - CSS we'll need some sample elements to
00:07 - work with I recommend creating an H1
00:09 - header tag type in maybe your name
00:13 - and a paragraph
00:15 - we'll need a pair paragraph tags I'll
00:18 - generate some text by typing lorem then
00:20 - hitting tab let's go to our CSS style
00:23 - sheet let's add a border around our H1
00:26 - element H1 curly braces we can select a
00:30 - border Style with the Border Dash style
00:33 - property first we have solid
00:36 - our border is a solid line there is
00:39 - dashed
00:41 - we have a dashed line
00:43 - dotted
00:46 - double for a double border
00:49 - Groove
00:52 - Ridge
00:55 - inset
00:57 - outset
00:59 - or none if something has a border
01:02 - naturally you can remove it
01:04 - let's pick a solid border you can change
01:07 - the width of the border with the border
01:09 - with property border Dash width by
01:13 - default it's one let's increase that to
01:15 - two
01:16 - or even three
01:18 - four
01:20 - five
01:21 - border width is for the Border thickness
01:23 - I think three would be good for this
01:26 - example you can change the color with
01:28 - the Border color property then pick a
01:31 - color
01:33 - I'll use the built-in Color Picker and
01:36 - use hsl values let's go with a purple
01:39 - color
01:40 - something like that's good you can even
01:43 - round the corners with the Border radius
01:45 - property
01:46 - border Dash radius the higher the number
01:50 - in pixels the more rounded the corners
01:52 - are going to be that's five this is ten
01:57 - fifteen
01:59 - twenty okay just out of curiosity what
02:02 - if we do like 100
02:04 - okay it seems like there's a maximum you
02:06 - can only round at the corner so far so
02:09 - it looks like the max is 20. all right
02:11 - there's also a shorthand syntax in place
02:14 - of listing three different properties
02:15 - for the style width and color we can do
02:17 - that all at once let's eliminate these
02:20 - three lines we'll use shorthand syntax
02:23 - for the Border I would like three pixels
02:27 - solid then I'll list a color and use the
02:30 - Color Picker
02:32 - again I would like purple I don't quite
02:34 - remember what we had but it was
02:35 - something like that
02:37 - yeah that is the shorthand syntax
02:39 - you type border the Border width the
02:42 - Border style then the Border color but
02:45 - border radius is still a separate
02:46 - property
02:47 - let's add a border to our paragraph now
02:49 - we will select the P tag
02:52 - there is directional shorthand syntax if
02:55 - you want just one of the borders let's
02:57 - begin with the bottom border Dash bottom
03:02 - then we can list a border width border
03:04 - style then a color and this would only
03:06 - apply to the bottom border of our
03:08 - paragraph let's go with three pixels
03:12 - solid then red
03:15 - but I'm going to pick a more specific
03:16 - kind of red
03:18 - there we go so that is border bottom
03:20 - we're only applying a border to the
03:23 - bottom of our element then there's
03:25 - border top
03:27 - border Dash top let's go with three
03:30 - pixels
03:31 - solid again then a color
03:35 - I'll go with yellow
03:40 - there we are
03:41 - border left
03:44 - three pixels let's try dotted this time
03:49 - then orange
03:54 - that's good
03:56 - then border right border Dash right
04:01 - three pixels dotted again then I will
04:04 - pick Green
04:07 - maybe like a light green
04:09 - there we are
04:11 - then we'll set the Border radius as well
04:14 - this would apply for all of the borders
04:17 - let's try 10.
04:19 - not bad alright everybody that is how to
04:22 - create CSS borders
