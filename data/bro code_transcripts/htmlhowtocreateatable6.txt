00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
bro here and in this video I'm gonna
00:03 - teach you guys how we can make a basic
table in HTML let's get into it
00:09 - I guess tables are used to display a
table of information it's useful if you
00:16 - need to organize some information in
rosing columns so before we begin what I
00:21 - think we'll do for a project is we'll
create a table of personal finances so
00:26 - before we create that table let's create
a heading perhaps an h2 heading because
00:31 - I think that's a nice size and then
let's close this so we'll make a title
00:35 - such as personal finances and if you're
a baller you can write like a dollar
00:42 - sign underscore dollar sign like you're
seeing money otherwise if you're broke
00:46 - like me you can put a frowny face the
first step to creating it sable is that
00:50 - we need a pair of table tags so we'll
make an opening table tag and a closing
00:55 - table tag everything related to our
table is going to be between these two
01:00 - tags the second step is that we'll want
to create our first row and we can use
01:05 - the TR tag and that is short for table
row and you'll want to be sure to have a
01:10 - closing tag for this as well anything
between these two tags will be included
01:16 - with the first table row and we'll make
a couple table rows but let's begin with
01:21 - the first if we want to have a heading
for the first cell in your table use the
01:28 - table heading tag otherwise if you don't
want this to be heading you can use the
01:33 - TD tag for table data but let's say that
for the first row we want these all to
01:40 - be headings we'll use the th tag for
table heading and I'll show you the
01:45 - difference between each of these two
tags so what I think I'll do for the
01:49 - first cell in the first row of our table
is that I will put the word month here
01:55 - and then we need a closing th tag let's
save this reload the page and it says
02:01 - month so we can add a few different
cells within here so let's create
02:05 - another table heading tag and perhaps I
will say January then let's close this
02:13 - save this reload and it says January
right next to month so let's do this for
02:19 - a few months
so let's do february th march perhaps
02:33 - one more April alright let's save this
reload alright and this is the first row
02:42 - in our table let's say that we want to
add a second row well we need to use the
02:48 - TR tags a pair of them and you'll want
to be sure that you're adding this
02:53 - second pair of TR tags outside of the
first so let's create another table row
03:02 - alright so what I think we'll do is that
we will list perhaps income on the
03:09 - second row so I'll create a table
heading and I will list this as income
03:15 - and then let's close this let's check
this out
03:19 - alright so here is the first cell in our
second row that says income and let's
03:26 - add a few more cells just to populate
everything after income for this row so
03:31 - I'll just make up some numbers so we
don't want to use a heading table
03:36 - heading we can but I don't think that's
necessary for this part so we can use
03:41 - the TD tag or table data and I'll just
make up an income so how about we say
03:48 - $1500 and then let's close this and
let's see what this looks like
03:53 - alright and here it says $1500 let's
populate the second row with a few other
03:58 - incomes and I'm just making up numbers
here you don't have to copy this you can
04:02 - come up with your own numbers too or
even use your own personal finances if
04:06 - this helps alright so I'll just make up
a number 1750 so we'll make another set
04:17 - of table data tags and perhaps I will
say 1250 then how about a low number for
04:26 - April $500 alright let's save this
refresh
04:34 - right and here the rest of our row too
is populated with data this table is
04:39 - becoming more difficult to read and one
way to make it more readable is to add a
04:45 - border around this table and between
each of these individual cells of this
04:49 - table so one way that we can add a
border is that within the opening table
04:54 - tag we're going to type border we'll use
the border attribute and we'll set this
04:59 - equal to any number you want for the
width of your border to is a decent
05:04 - amount you can either put 2 or 2px for 2
pixels and let's save this reload and
05:11 - each cell within our table is now
surrounded with a border so this is more
05:17 - neat and organized now one thing to
notice with table headings and table
05:22 - data is that anything that's using the
table heading tag is actually bold and
05:28 - it's centered and with these table data
tags any text that's between these two
05:33 - tags is not bold and it's aligned to the
left so you can use either table
05:39 - headings or table data tags freely
depending on how you want your table
05:44 - arranged I feel like having anything
within our first row or our first column
05:49 - as table headings wouldn't be a bad
example but you can use table headings
05:54 - and table data tags freely based on
whatever you want for your table you're
05:59 - not required to have table headings
first for each table row but create
06:04 - these tables however you want all right
so let's create another table row how
06:09 - about another for expenses so we need to
create a table row by using a table row
06:15 - tag and then make sure to close this and
let's create a table heading and we will
06:23 - put the text expenses and then close
this let's save this reload just to
06:29 - check this out all right we have another
row and the first cell in this row says
06:35 - expenses but I'm going to add a colon
here just to match the others okay let's
06:40 - make up some expenses we can use a table
data tag to add some data to this and I
06:46 - will make up some numbers
perhaps 500 then for the next row how
06:57 - about a thousand we spent a lot of money
for February
07:00 - you know Valentine's Day all right then
table data then we realized we spent a
07:08 - lot of money so we're not gonna spend as
much this month
07:11 - so perhaps 750 and then for the last
month we didn't make much money so let's
07:21 - put a really low amount for expenses we
spend $150 this month we were broke all
07:31 - right let's see what this looks like oh
I think I'll add a minus sign all right
07:37 - let's reload this all right here is our
expenses for each of these months let's
07:43 - create another table row perhaps one for
savings like what is our savings with
07:50 - income minus expenses so let's create
another table row so we need to use the
07:55 - opening TR tag for table row and a
closing one as well right now we don't
08:01 - have any automatic ways of calculating
what the sum of these two cells is like
08:06 - it's an Excel spreadsheet so I'm just
gonna do this by hand so let's create a
08:10 - table heading and we will call this
savings and we will close this table
08:16 - heading and let's create a table data
cell and 1500 minus 500 is 1,000 I'm
08:29 - just gonna do the same thing with each
of these columns so table data and for
08:36 - February we saved 750 dollars and for
March I think that is 500 and lastly for
08:50 - April we did not save much we saved
three hundred and fifty dollars all
08:59 - right let's see what our completed table
looks like alright there is our last row
09:05 - savings and these are our savings for
each of these months this black and
09:10 - white table is boring let's add some
color I'll show you how to do that so
09:14 - within each of these table rows let's
say we want to color the first row so go
09:20 - to the opening tag for the table row
this is what we're gonna type BG color
09:26 - equals and then pick a color so pick
whatever color you want I think I will
09:31 - just say gray let's save this and
refresh the page all right well great
09:37 - technically isn't a color or is it I
don't know but it's not white a black
09:42 - anymore which is the point let's do the
same thing with income for the next
09:46 - opening tag of our next table row we're
going to type BG color and you could
09:53 - pick a different color or the same one
doesn't matter I think I will pick
09:56 - yellow like it's cold or something well
let's save this reload and the second
10:02 - row in our table is now yellow so let's
do the same thing for expenses and
10:07 - savings so BG color equals perhaps red
because we're subtracting money it's
10:15 - negative it's a bad sign then let's do
the same thing for the last row so BG
10:21 - color equals perhaps green save this
reload here is our artistic exhibit of
10:30 - our personal finances colorized circa
the year 2020 or so but you know what we
10:37 - can take this a step further let's
change the background color of our table
10:41 - so within the opening table tag what
we'll type is BG color equals and then
10:48 - we can give this a new background color
perhaps black let's save this reload and
10:53 - the background of our table is now black
we can also give the individual cells in
10:59 - our table a specified minimum width and
height using the width and height
11:04 - attributes so for our month table cell
it's going to be this one right here
11:09 - within the opening table height tag
all right height equals and this is
11:15 - pixels perhaps ten and then with we can
say equals 75 so let's see what this
11:23 - looks like and you can see that the
dimensions of the month table cell as
11:30 - well as with the other cells that come
after it all change to match the width
11:35 - of 75 and the height of 75 and you know
what I'm going to apply this to the
11:40 - others as well just so that each of
these cells in our table is more uniform
11:45 - so I'm going to paste this in each of
these table heading tags so now all the
11:52 - cells in our table should be uniform
then so that's kind of nice then if you
11:56 - want everything to be of the same size
you can also apply the height and width
12:01 - attributes to the table as a whole as
well so we'll put that within the
12:05 - opening tag of our table so let's
specify a minimum height for the table
12:12 - we'll say perhaps 150 let's save this
reload and the entire table now has a
12:19 - minimum height of 150 pixels now you're
not limited to just specifying the
12:25 - height and the width and pixels you can
also place a percentage here and the
12:29 - percentage applies to the room available
on the web page so we could say width
12:35 - equals you can place pixels here
otherwise you can place a percentage
12:40 - let's say that we want our width of our
table to take up the entire webpage the
12:46 - entire width of the webpage that is so
we'll say with equals 100 let's save
12:51 - reload and the width of the table now
takes up the entire webpage and this is
12:57 - dynamic if I were to change the
dimensions of this webpage the table is
13:01 - also going to change dimensions as well
so the width will always take up 100% of
13:07 - the width of the webpage lastly for this
topic on tables and I promised that this
13:12 - is gonna be the last one there's an
attribute called a line and you can
13:15 - align text in the space that's available
to it let's say that we want to align
13:21 - some of these dollar amounts within our
table let's start with income so what
13:26 - we'll do is that we'll go to our table
rrrow opening tag and we will use the
13:31 - align attribute now we can align text to
the left to the center or to the right
13:38 - but let's say that we want to align all
of the text within this table row to the
13:44 - center so we'll say align equals Center
and then we will save this reload the
13:49 - page and all the dollar amounts within
our income are Center aligned now so
13:54 - just to be consistent I'm going to copy
this and put this in the other table
13:58 - rows that we have and voila here is our
completed table and I would say that
14:04 - this is good enough for this beginner
HTML tutorial if you would like a copy
14:09 - of this HTML document I'll copy all of
this text and post it as a comment down
14:15 - below and pin it to the top and if
you're looking for additional practice
14:18 - or a project to work on why don't you
create your own table of your own
14:23 - personal finances but yeah that is
everything you need to know to get
14:28 - started creating tables in HTML heyyou
