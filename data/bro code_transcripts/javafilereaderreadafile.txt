00:00 - hey how's it going everybody it's you
00:01 - bro hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video i'm going to teach you guys how we
00:04 - can use the file reader class
00:06 - to read the contents of a file so sit
00:09 - back
00:09 - relax and enjoy the show
00:14 - make sure you like comment and subscribe
00:17 - one like equals one prayer for the
00:19 - youtube algorithm
00:21 - okay guys and gals let's discuss the
00:23 - file reader class
00:25 - the file reader class allows us to read
00:27 - the contents
00:28 - of a file as a stream of characters
00:32 - one by one and when we use the read
00:34 - method it's going to return
00:36 - an integer value which contains the byte
00:39 - value
00:39 - of whatever character we're currently
00:41 - reading and we can easily cast that as
00:44 - a character value so let's create an
00:46 - instance of the file reader class
00:48 - file reader let's call this reader for
00:51 - short
00:52 - equals new file reader and we're going
00:55 - to need an import as well so let's
00:57 - include that
00:59 - import java.io.file reader
01:02 - within the constructor of the file
01:04 - reader we're going to list the
01:06 - file name or the file path i'm going to
01:08 - create a text file called
01:10 - art.txt i'm going to read and display
01:14 - some ascii art today and we'll also need
01:16 - to surround this with a try and catch
01:18 - block because
01:19 - this is considered dangerous code my
01:22 - next step is that i need to create a
01:24 - txt file called art what i'm going to do
01:27 - just to make this easy
01:28 - is create this on my desktop and then
01:31 - copy and paste it over to my project
01:33 - folder
01:34 - so this is going to be called art and
01:36 - just to verify the details i'm going to
01:38 - go to
01:39 - properties take a look at the name art
01:42 - and it's a
01:42 - txt file so we should be good so
01:46 - i'm going to paste some ascii art from
01:48 - the internet if you don't want to do so
01:50 - you can just write some lines of text
01:51 - for this example maybe a poem
01:53 - roses are red violets
01:56 - are blue but instead i want to have some
01:59 - fun with this and
02:00 - find some art to use this looks like a
02:02 - decent website to get some ascii art
02:04 - ascii art archive find a piece that you
02:07 - like
02:08 - i'm going to copy this one paste it
02:11 - within
02:11 - my file and then save it
02:15 - then i'm going to take this file and
02:17 - paste it within
02:18 - my project folder our next step is to
02:22 - use the read method of our file reader
02:25 - to read the first
02:26 - character of our file this is going to
02:29 - return an integer
02:30 - value which contains the byte value of
02:33 - that first
02:34 - character so we can store this integer
02:36 - value within
02:37 - a variable so let's create an integer
02:40 - variable called maybe data
02:42 - and data equals reader
02:45 - dot read all right we'll need an
02:48 - additional clause
02:50 - to our try and catch blocks so we would
02:52 - like to handle any
02:54 - io exceptions that happen then we should
02:56 - be good
02:57 - so we're going to read the first
02:59 - character within
03:00 - our file but we would like to continue
03:03 - reading
03:04 - but if our read method returns negative
03:06 - one
03:07 - that means there is no more data to be
03:09 - read that is the end of the file
03:11 - so we would like to continue reading as
03:13 - long as our read method does not return
03:16 - negative one what we would like to do is
03:18 - continue reading this file
03:20 - as long as the value returned does not
03:23 - equal
03:23 - negative one and we can accomplish that
03:26 - with a while loop
03:27 - while our data does not
03:31 - equal negative one if it is negative one
03:34 - that means
03:34 - there is no more data to be read so
03:38 - let's print to the console window our
03:41 - data but we'll need to cast this as a
03:44 - character value
03:46 - so make sure you use print and not print
03:48 - line
03:50 - because if you do it's going to print a
03:52 - new line after each individual character
03:55 - and then we would like to read the next
03:56 - character so let's copy what we have
03:59 - here
04:00 - and paste it data equals reader.read
04:03 - then lastly outside of the while loop
04:05 - let's close our reader
04:07 - so reader.close
04:11 - and then when we run this it will
04:14 - display
04:15 - the contents of our file the ascii art
04:17 - that i posted
04:18 - or if you have something else it will
04:20 - display that so that's the basics of the
04:23 - file reader class if you would like a
04:25 - copy of this code i will post all of
04:27 - this in the comments
04:28 - down below but yeah that's the basics of
04:30 - the file reader class
04:31 - in java hey you
04:34 - yeah i'm talking to you if you learn
04:36 - something new then you can help me
04:39 - help you in three easy steps by smashing
