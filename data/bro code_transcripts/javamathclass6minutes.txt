00:00 - how's it going everybody it's your bro
00:01 - here hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video i'm going to teach you guys a few
00:04 - useful methods of the math class and at
00:07 - the end of this video we're going to
00:08 - create a program
00:09 - where we will find the hypotenuse of a
00:12 - triangle so
00:13 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:17 - make sure you like comment and subscribe
00:21 - one like equals one prayer for the
00:23 - youtube algorithm
00:25 - alrighty then guys and gals in this
00:27 - video i'm going to demonstrate a few
00:29 - useful methods of the math class to
00:31 - begin we'll need maybe two numbers
00:34 - let's say that these will be double
00:36 - variables double
00:37 - x let's set the sequel to 3.14
00:40 - and double y we will set this
00:44 - to let's say negative 10. all right the
00:46 - first useful method is the max method
00:49 - this will find the larger of two numbers
00:52 - so in order to use the
00:53 - max method we're going to type math with
00:55 - a capital m
00:57 - dot and there's a few recommendations
00:59 - here what we would like is the
01:01 - max method that is right here so there's
01:05 - a few to choose from we can
01:06 - compare two integers two long values two
01:10 - floats
01:10 - and two doubles i'm going to compare the
01:13 - values of
01:14 - x and y so i'm going to put these within
01:18 - the parentheses of my max method and
01:20 - then we can either display
01:22 - the result or assign this to a new
01:24 - variable let's say double
01:26 - z equals math.max and we'll compare
01:29 - x and y and assign the larger number to
01:32 - variable z
01:34 - and we will display the result
01:36 - system.out.printline
01:37 - z and the larger of these two numbers
01:41 - is in fact x which is 3.14
01:44 - and there is also a min method which
01:47 - will find
01:48 - the lesser of two values which is
01:50 - variable y
01:51 - which is negative 10. another useful
01:54 - method
01:55 - is the absolute function method it's
01:57 - just abs
01:58 - like abs six-pack abs and we'll pass
02:02 - in y and this will display the absolute
02:05 - value
02:06 - of y which is 10. so the absolute value
02:09 - is
02:10 - basically a number without the negative
02:12 - sign i'm not a mathematician so
02:14 - i could be wrong in that definition all
02:16 - right we also have the square root
02:18 - function
02:18 - that is sqrt square root of
02:24 - y i don't know what the square root of
02:26 - negative 10 is but we're about to find
02:28 - out
02:29 - uh i don't know i guess that didn't work
02:31 - let's change y to 10.
02:34 - 3.16 blah blah blah blah
02:37 - all right that is the square root
02:39 - function we can also round
02:42 - let's round x
02:46 - so x rounded is 3.0
02:50 - on the other hand seal like ceiling this
02:53 - will always round up
02:54 - so 3.4 or 3.14 always rounded up
02:58 - is four and floor will always round
03:02 - down so 3.14
03:06 - always rounded down is 3.0
03:09 - here's a project that we can work on
03:11 - let's create a program
03:13 - that will find the hypotenuse of a
03:15 - triangle
03:16 - and we will ask the user for side x and
03:19 - side y so to begin let's declare two
03:22 - variables
03:24 - double x and double
03:27 - y actually i take that back let's
03:30 - declare
03:31 - double z as well because z will be the
03:34 - result
03:34 - the hypotenuse we'll also need a scanner
03:37 - to accept some user input
03:39 - scanner scanner equals new
03:42 - scanner within the parentheses we're
03:45 - going to type
03:46 - system.in we'll need an import so
03:49 - include
03:49 - this import at the top import
03:52 - java.util.scanner
03:54 - we'll need a prompt for side x and side
03:57 - y
03:59 - we can do that with a print line
04:00 - statement enter
04:02 - side x
04:06 - i can't type today and we will store the
04:09 - result within
04:11 - variable x x equals we need some user
04:14 - input
04:15 - scanner dot next double because we would
04:19 - like a double value
04:22 - let's repeat the process for side y
04:25 - enter side y will store the result
04:29 - within variable y now here's the tricky
04:31 - part
04:32 - there is a mathematical formula to
04:34 - calculate the hypotenuse given
04:37 - two angles well two sides of a triangle
04:40 - so this is what we're going to do first
04:42 - we'll multiply
04:43 - x times x plus
04:46 - y times y then we need to put this
04:50 - within the square root
04:51 - function of the math class math
04:54 - make sure it's with a capital m dot sqrt
05:00 - and we are going to take all of this and
05:02 - place this within
05:04 - the square root function and we will
05:06 - assign this to
05:07 - our variable of z
05:11 - so z equals math
05:15 - dot square root x times x plus y
05:18 - times y and with a print line statement
05:21 - we can display
05:22 - the hypotenuse is
05:28 - plus z that should be good
05:32 - oh then it's good practice to close your
05:34 - scanner i always forget to do that
05:36 - although it's not necessary
05:38 - scanner.close all right let's test this
05:42 - enter side x that is four enter
05:45 - side y let's say five the hypotenuse is
05:49 - six point four add some change all right
05:52 - so that's just
05:53 - a simple program that you can make using
05:55 - a function of the math class
05:58 - so if you would like a copy of this code
06:00 - i will post this in the comments down
06:01 - below
06:02 - but yeah that's a few useful methods of
06:04 - the math class
06:06 - oh and i forgot to tell you guys like
06:08 - comment and subscribe
06:10 - that is all
