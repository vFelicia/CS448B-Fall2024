00:00 - what's going on everybody it's bro hope
00:02 - you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to explain
00:05 - lists in python so
00:07 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - if you wouldn't mind please like comment
00:14 - and subscribe
00:15 - one like equals one prayer for the
00:17 - youtube algorithm
00:19 - all right ladies and gentlemen let's get
00:21 - down to business i got to explain
00:23 - lists to you all now a list is used to
00:26 - store
00:27 - multiple items within a single variable
00:30 - for example let's say we have a variable
00:32 - called food
00:33 - and i will store a string value of pizza
00:36 - because i like pizza
00:38 - what we could do is that we can store
00:40 - multiple items within
00:42 - this variable by turning this variable
00:44 - into a list
00:45 - and in order to do so we're going to
00:47 - surround all of the values that we would
00:49 - like to add
00:50 - to our list with a set of square
00:53 - brackets
00:54 - and boom there you have it we now have a
00:56 - list called food
00:58 - it is no longer a variable so what we
01:00 - could do
01:01 - is add multiple items to this list of
01:04 - food
01:04 - so let's add some other food items that
01:06 - we might like let's see i also like
01:09 - maybe some hamburgers and
01:12 - a hot dog
01:16 - and maybe some spaghetti i think i
01:19 - smelled spaghetti right
01:20 - okay so we now have a list called food
01:23 - now what happens if we attempt to print
01:25 - this list of food
01:27 - so print food so this will
01:31 - print all of the elements found in this
01:34 - list
01:35 - each item in a list is referred to as an
01:38 - element
01:38 - if we need to access a certain element
01:41 - of
01:42 - this list we have to list the index so
01:44 - next to our list we'll add a set of
01:46 - square brackets again
01:48 - and we need to list the numbered index
01:50 - of the element that we're trying to
01:52 - access
01:52 - now computers they always start with
01:54 - zero so the first
01:55 - element in our list would be element
01:58 - number zero the next one would be one
02:01 - two and three so if we need to access
02:04 - element
02:05 - zero which is in the first position we
02:08 - would say food
02:09 - square brackets and then within here
02:11 - list the index so the first position
02:13 - is zero and this will now print the
02:16 - first element of our list
02:17 - which is pizza let's attempt to access
02:19 - some of these other elements
02:21 - so the element at index one would be
02:24 - you guessed it hamburger two
02:28 - would be hot dog and three would be
02:31 - spaghetti
02:32 - now what happens if we attempt to access
02:35 - the element at
02:36 - index 4 well currently that's out of
02:38 - range because we did not assign
02:40 - a value so we're experiencing an error
02:43 - an index
02:44 - out of range error but if i were to add
02:46 - another element
02:48 - let's say pudding all right well then
02:51 - the element at index four would be
02:54 - pudding then
02:55 - one important concept with lists is that
02:58 - you can always
02:58 - update and change the elements found
03:01 - within a list
03:02 - later on in the program after you
03:04 - declare one so let's say we would like
03:06 - to
03:06 - immediately change one of these elements
03:08 - let's say
03:09 - food at index zero i want to
03:12 - replace with maybe sushi because sushi
03:15 - is great
03:16 - so if i were to print the element at
03:19 - index
03:19 - 0 this would no longer be pizza because
03:23 - we updated element 0 to be
03:26 - sushi then and this prints sushi now if
03:28 - you need to display
03:30 - all of the elements found within a list
03:32 - you can easily do so with a standard for
03:34 - loop
03:35 - what we'll do is say for x in
03:38 - the name of our list which is food
03:42 - print x and let me turn this line into
03:46 - a comment all right so this for loop
03:48 - will print
03:49 - all of the elements found within our
03:51 - list of food
03:53 - and the results are sushi hamburger hot
03:56 - dog spaghetti and pudding
03:58 - all right people for this next portion
03:59 - i'm going to demonstrate a few useful
04:02 - functions of
04:02 - lists and to access some of these
04:04 - functions type the name of your list
04:06 - dot and there's a bunch to choose from
04:09 - here let's begin with
04:10 - append we can add an element to this
04:12 - list let's say at the end i would like
04:14 - to add
04:15 - ice cream so then if i were to display
04:18 - my list we now have ice cream at the end
04:20 - because we appended
04:22 - this value to my list of food so let's
04:25 - go over a few others
04:26 - so we can also remove a value food
04:30 - dot remove let's say i would like to
04:32 - remove
04:33 - hotdog so i'm going to type that within
04:36 - my function and this will remove hotdog
04:40 - and that is no longer here
04:43 - next we can pop food dot pop
04:47 - pop will remove the last element so this
04:50 - will remove
04:51 - pudding
04:55 - we can insert a value at a given index
04:58 - food dot insert we need to list an
05:01 - index let's say zero that would be the
05:04 - first position technically that's where
05:05 - pizza is currently
05:07 - and i would like to add cake
05:10 - and at index 0 we now have cake
05:15 - so next up we have sort
05:18 - food dot sort this will sort a list
05:21 - alphabetically so in the first position
05:24 - we have hamburger hot dog pudding
05:26 - spaghetti then sushi
05:28 - we can also clear a list food
05:32 - dot clear and this will remove all of
05:35 - the elements
05:36 - of a list so this will not print
05:38 - anything because we cleared the list
05:40 - well everyone in conclusion a list is
05:43 - really just a variable that can store
05:46 - multiple values think of it that way so
05:49 - if you would like
05:49 - a copy of all the code that we have
05:51 - written here today i will post all of
05:53 - this in the comments down below
05:55 - but yeah that's how lists work in python
05:59 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
06:01 - learned something new
