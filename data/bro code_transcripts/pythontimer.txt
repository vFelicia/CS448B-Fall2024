00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
00:01 - bro hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video we're going to create a simple
00:05 - countdown timer in python so sit back
00:07 - relax
00:08 - and enjoy the show
00:12 - if you find this video helpful please
00:13 - remember to like
00:15 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:17 - help keep this channel running
00:19 - all right let's get started guys and
00:21 - gals so for this video we're going to
00:23 - import the time module we're going to
00:26 - create a timer that will start at 0 and
00:28 - count up to maybe 10
00:30 - and then we'll create another timer that
00:31 - will do the reverse start at 10 and
00:33 - count down to 0.
00:34 - so maybe you need this for a game or
00:36 - something it's fairly simple and
00:37 - straightforward
00:38 - so we'll need a few variables a variable
00:41 - called running
00:42 - and this will store a boolean value of
00:44 - true
00:45 - while our timer is running while it
00:47 - remains true
00:48 - we'll continue the timer if we need to
00:50 - stop for any reason we can reassign
00:52 - this variable a value of false we'll
00:55 - need an amount of seconds
00:57 - seconds equals and we'll set this to
00:59 - zero and a point at which we would like
01:01 - to end this timer
01:03 - so we'll create a variable called end
01:05 - and let's say we would like to count up
01:06 - to 10
01:07 - so we'll set end to 10. we'll need a
01:09 - while loop
01:10 - while running so while running remains
01:13 - true
01:13 - what do we want to do we'll print the
01:15 - amount of seconds
01:17 - that have elapsed initially this is
01:19 - going to be zero
01:23 - we would like our thread that is running
01:24 - to sleep
01:26 - so we can sleep for a given amount of
01:28 - seconds i would like to sleep for
01:30 - one second and then we'll increment our
01:33 - seconds variable by one
01:34 - seconds plus equals one all right
01:39 - and then we should write an if statement
01:41 - to check to see if seconds
01:42 - is greater than or equal to our end
01:45 - whatever value that we set
01:46 - which is 10. if seconds
01:49 - is greater than or equal to end
01:53 - so if we reach the end
01:56 - we're going to reassign our running
01:58 - variable as false
02:00 - and let's print seconds
02:05 - and once we exit this while loop let's
02:07 - print
02:09 - done all right let's try this
02:12 - so this will begin at zero and count up
02:14 - by one every one second
02:16 - and then once we reach our end which is
02:19 - 10 this will display
02:21 - done which it has all right so that's
02:24 - how to create a
02:25 - count up timer now if you want to create
02:28 - a timer where you count down
02:29 - we just need to change a few things so
02:32 - seconds
02:32 - let's set this to 10. let's start at 10
02:34 - and count down to zero
02:36 - so let's switch the values of seconds
02:38 - and end
02:39 - seconds we'll begin at 10 and end will
02:41 - end at zero
02:43 - now with seconds we're going to
02:45 - decrement by one
02:48 - if seconds is less than or equal to
02:51 - our end and let's change the message as
02:54 - well
02:55 - let's say happy new year let's pretend
02:57 - that we're counting down
02:58 - to new year's day all right let's begin
03:02 - so it starts at 10 and it's going to
03:04 - count down to zero
03:05 - and once seconds reaches zero it's going
03:08 - to display
03:10 - happy new year all right everybody so
03:13 - that's how you can create a simple
03:15 - count up as well as a countdown timer in
03:17 - python
