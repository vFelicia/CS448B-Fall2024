00:00 - hey what's going on everybody so in
00:01 - today's video we're going to create a
00:03 - random number generator but first I need
00:05 - to explain how to create a random number
00:07 - in JavaScript let's store a random
00:09 - number within a variable which we will
00:11 - name random num
00:14 - to create a random number in JavaScript
00:16 - we can use the random method of math
00:19 - math dot random method this will
00:22 - generate a random number between 0 and
00:25 - 1. but it looks like we forgot to Output
00:28 - our random number so let's do that with
00:31 - console.log
00:32 - console.log randomnum this will generate
00:35 - a random number between 0 and 1. it will
00:38 - give us a number with a long decimal
00:40 - portion most likely let's say we would
00:43 - like to roll a six-sided dice I need a
00:45 - random number between one and six not
00:48 - including the decimal portion so the
00:50 - first step is that we will multiply
00:53 - math.random times six
00:56 - what this will do is give us a random
00:58 - number between 0 and 6 exclusive now I
01:01 - don't want the decimal portion I would
01:03 - like a whole integer we'll enclose this
01:05 - equation with the floor method of math
01:09 - dot floor then we will enclose our
01:12 - equation
01:14 - so now we have
01:15 - oops it looks like I misspelled math it
01:17 - should be Capital there so far a random
01:20 - number is going to be between zero and
01:22 - five so they're zero
01:25 - and there's five
01:28 - but I need one through six well we can
01:30 - increase the minimum by adding plus one
01:32 - or whatever you want the minimum to be
01:34 - so now that should give us a random
01:37 - number between one and six
01:40 - there's six
01:43 - and there's one
01:44 - for a random number between 1 and 100 I
01:47 - can set the maximum to be 100
01:49 - math.random times one hundred plus one
01:53 - so now the number is going to be between
01:55 - 1 and 100.
01:57 - if you're looking for a random number
01:59 - between a certain range let's say 50 and
02:01 - 100
02:03 - well we're going to change our equation
02:05 - just to make this easier to read I'm
02:07 - going to set two constants const Min
02:10 - what's the minimum let's say 50. and the
02:13 - max const max will be 100.
02:17 - let's replace 100 with our maximum and
02:21 - one with our minimum there's one
02:23 - additional change we need to make for
02:25 - example our random number is 139
02:29 - we're multiplying math.random times 100
02:33 - our maximum then adding an additional 50
02:36 - to it
02:37 - so one change we're going to make is
02:39 - that we will subtract our minimum from
02:42 - our maximum then I will surround this
02:44 - portion of our equation with the set of
02:46 - parentheses just to force operator
02:47 - precedence now the random number should
02:50 - be between 50 and 100 so depending on
02:53 - the range of numbers you're looking for
02:54 - you can change the minimum and the
02:56 - maximum all right now with that out of
02:58 - the way let's create our random number
03:00 - generator
03:01 - let's go to our HTML file I will create
03:04 - a button
03:07 - the ID will be my button the text on the
03:11 - button will be roll we will roll a
03:14 - six-sided dice
03:15 - within our CSS style sheet
03:18 - I will set the text of the body of our
03:21 - document
03:22 - the font family I will set to be verdana
03:26 - because I like that font
03:29 - to Center align everything to make this
03:31 - easy I will set text aligned Center
03:35 - all right we're getting somewhere
03:37 - let's work on the button I will select
03:39 - the ID of my button
03:42 - I will change the font size of the
03:44 - button to be 3 em meaning 300 percent
03:48 - I'll add a little bit of padding within
03:50 - our button 5 pixels by 25 pixels
03:54 - and I will set the Border radius to be 5
03:59 - pixels
04:01 - just to smooth the corners
04:03 - we're also going to need a label so
04:05 - let's go back to our HTML file
04:07 - I will add a label
04:10 - with an ID of my label
04:15 - within our CSS style sheet I will select
04:18 - the ID of my label then change the font
04:22 - size to be 3 em
04:24 - so be sure to save your CSS file
04:27 - save your HTML file
04:30 - then within our JavaScript file
04:33 - we will need to get our button and the
04:35 - label we'll store those within some
04:37 - constants
04:39 - const my button equals document dot get
04:44 - element by ID the ID of the element
04:48 - we're getting is my button
04:54 - then we will need to get my label
04:57 - my
04:59 - label the ID is my label
05:04 - let's set a minimum
05:06 - const Min equals I'll set that to be one
05:10 - as if we're rolling a six-sided dice
05:12 - const Max equals six
05:16 - then let random num will declare a
05:20 - random number variable but not assign it
05:22 - quite yet
05:23 - okay when we click on the button
05:26 - we'll execute a function
05:27 - we will take my button
05:30 - with the on click attribute I will set
05:33 - the SQL to a function what's the
05:36 - function going to do it's going to roll
05:38 - a random number
05:39 - random num equals math dot random times
05:45 - our maximum
05:49 - we'll enclose this equation with
05:51 - math.floor to round it math dot floor
05:56 - then add our minimum
05:59 - then we will change the text content of
06:02 - my label to display it my label dot text
06:06 - content equals our randomnum
06:10 - when we click on the button it should
06:12 - roll a random number
06:14 - uh what are we missing not a number
06:17 - oh okay it looks like I made a mistake I
06:19 - forgot to add a set of parentheses after
06:21 - random
06:22 - there we go
06:24 - I'm going to put the number on a new
06:25 - line so within our HTML file I'm just
06:27 - going to add a Break Tag
06:30 - there we go let's save everything roll
06:32 - again so I rolled a six three one two
06:35 - five three
06:37 - let's say we would like to roll three
06:39 - dice not just one we'll make a few
06:41 - changes
06:43 - I will replace my label with label one
06:46 - for the ID
06:48 - then I'm going to add a break after okay
06:51 - let's copy our label paste it two times
06:54 - we'll need labels two and three
06:58 - I'll also give these labels a class of
07:01 - my labels
07:04 - we can apply CSS styling to an entire
07:06 - class to make it easy
07:08 - all right within our CSS style sheet
07:11 - let's replace the ID of my label with
07:13 - the class of my labels
07:18 - be sure to save all of your files
07:20 - than within our Javascript file let's
07:24 - replace my label with label one
07:27 - the ID is label one
07:30 - copy this line of code
07:32 - then we need labels two and three
07:34 - label two
07:36 - label three
07:39 - let's rename randomnum as random num1
07:44 - copy it paste it two times then we need
07:47 - random number two random number three
07:51 - within our function for our button
07:53 - change random num to be random num1 copy
07:56 - this line paste it two times
07:59 - then we need random number two random
08:01 - number three
08:03 - we'll change the text content of my
08:05 - label to be label one
08:08 - equals random num1 copy this line paste
08:12 - it two times change one to B2
08:15 - then for the third line change one to be
08:18 - three
08:19 - what we'll do now is generate three
08:21 - random numbers between one and six as if
08:24 - we're rolling three dice
08:25 - two three two three six one two two five
08:29 - all right everybody that's how to create
08:30 - a random number generator in JavaScript
