00:00 - hey people what's going on it's bro hope
00:02 - you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to explain
00:04 - multiple assignment in python
00:06 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:13 - remember to like
00:15 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:17 - help keep this channel running
00:19 - well then since you clicked on this
00:20 - video i should probably explain what
00:22 - multiple assignment is
00:23 - now multiple assignment allows us to
00:25 - assign multiple variables
00:28 - at the same time using one line of code
00:31 - here's an example of us
00:32 - using standard assignment let's say we
00:34 - have a variable
00:35 - name and i will set this to a value of
00:38 - my name but you can use your name for
00:39 - this example
00:40 - let's say edge equals 21 and how about
00:44 - a variable called attractive
00:47 - i think i'm gonna set this to true okay
00:49 - so we have a bunch of variables and then
00:51 - we can print
00:52 - the value of these variables with some
00:54 - print statements
00:55 - so let's print name age and attractive
00:59 - so we have name age attractive
01:03 - and as you would expect this prints bro
01:06 - 21
01:06 - and true now another way in which we
01:09 - could write the same code is to use
01:10 - multiple assignment and this allows us
01:13 - to assign multiple variables
01:15 - at the same time using one line of code
01:17 - so i'm going to turn all of these lines
01:19 - into comments
01:21 - and this time we will only use one line
01:23 - of code but to do this we're going to
01:25 - list
01:25 - all of our variables separated with a
01:28 - comma so that would be
01:29 - name comma edge comma
01:32 - attractive and we will set them equal
01:35 - to those values but in the same order
01:38 - separated by commas so that would be bro
01:42 - comma 21 comma true and this would do
01:45 - the same thing
01:46 - only using one line of code here's
01:48 - another example let's say we have
01:50 - four variables spongebob patrick sandy
01:52 - and squidward
01:54 - and let's pretend that they're all
01:55 - around maybe 30 years old
01:57 - at least it seems like they're around 30
01:59 - years old but i could be wrong
02:00 - i'm not too familiar with spongebob lore
02:02 - so let's set them all equal to 30.
02:05 - now we could write this using four lines
02:07 - of code or
02:08 - we could use multiple assignment to
02:10 - write the same thing
02:11 - using one line of code so if all of
02:14 - these variables
02:15 - are all equal to the same value there's
02:17 - a little bit of different syntax here
02:19 - so let's begin with the first variable
02:22 - of spongebob
02:23 - equals patrick
02:28 - equals sandy equals
02:31 - squidward then we're going to set them
02:34 - all equal to 30 and this should work
02:38 - just fine
02:39 - using only one line of code well
02:41 - everybody that's pretty much it for
02:42 - multiple assignment it allows us to
02:44 - assign
02:44 - multiple variables at the same time
02:47 - using one line of code
02:48 - i will post all of this code in the
02:50 - comments section down below
02:52 - and well yeah that's how multiple
02:54 - assignment works in python
