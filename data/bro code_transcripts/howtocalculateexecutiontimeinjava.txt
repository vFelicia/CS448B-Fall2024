00:00 - hey everybody in this video i thought i
00:02 - would show you all how you can get the
00:03 - runtime of a program i thought it might
00:05 - be useful now that we know how data
00:07 - structures and algorithms work for the
00:09 - most part so within the entry point of
00:11 - your program you'll need the start time
00:13 - and we'll store this within a long data
00:15 - type i'll name the start equals then
00:18 - type system dot nano
00:22 - time
00:23 - a nano second is a billionth of a second
00:26 - and then we have our program
00:28 - whatever it is
00:31 - and then at the end of our program we
00:33 - will get the duration
00:35 - this will be of the long data type
00:38 - duration
00:39 - equals and then we need the current time
00:42 - system dot nano time
00:46 - minus
00:47 - our start time this returns a time in
00:49 - nanoseconds if you need milliseconds you
00:52 - can divide this number by one million
00:55 - okay then let's print the duration
00:57 - system.out.printline
00:59 - duration
01:01 - plus
01:02 - milliseconds or some other unit to
01:04 - measure time okay so with our program
01:06 - let's just have the main thread sleep
01:08 - for maybe three
01:10 - seconds whatever it is you want to do
01:13 - and we will sleep for 3000 milliseconds
01:18 - and here we go so we will wait for three
01:20 - seconds
01:21 - and we are done this program took 3014
01:25 - milliseconds to complete when you enter
01:27 - your program get the start time at the
01:30 - end of your program get the current time
01:32 - minus the start time then depending on
01:34 - the units you're using you may need to
01:35 - divide this number by a million or if
01:37 - you need this in seconds you would
01:38 - divide this by 1 billion so yeah that's
01:41 - how to calculate the runtime of a
01:42 - program if you found this video helpful
