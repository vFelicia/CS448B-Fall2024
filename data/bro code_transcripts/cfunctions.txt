00:02 - hey yeah what's going on let's talk
00:03 - about functions a function is a small
00:06 - section of code that is executed
00:08 - whenever we call it also known as
00:10 - invoking a function when we compile and
00:13 - run a c program we begin with invoking
00:16 - the main function so here's our task we
00:19 - need to sing three verses of happy
00:21 - birthday for some reason if we are only
00:24 - using the main function we could write
00:26 - it like this
00:33 - this will be the first verse of happy
00:35 - birthday and if i need to sing three
00:37 - verses i could just copy and paste this
00:40 - one section
00:42 - and then paste it two additional times
00:44 - then i'm just going to add a new line
00:45 - character at the end
00:47 - technically this would work but it's
00:49 - considered poor practice to repeat code
00:51 - more than once if you don't have to
00:53 - wouldn't it be better if we write this
00:55 - code once and then simply reuse it while
00:57 - we can by using a function so let's
00:59 - delete two of these verses
01:01 - and we will create a new function so
01:04 - outside of the main function let's
01:06 - declare a new function so for now we're
01:08 - going to type void and then a unique
01:10 - name for this function let's say that
01:12 - it's the birthday function followed by a
01:14 - set of parentheses and then a set of
01:16 - curly braces so i'm going to take any
01:19 - code i would like to repeat and place it
01:21 - within this new birthday function and if
01:24 - i need to invoke this function all i
01:26 - have to do is type the name of the
01:28 - function followed by a set of
01:30 - parentheses i like to think of the
01:32 - parentheses as a pair of telephones
01:34 - talking to each other that's one trick i
01:36 - used to remember that's how to call a
01:37 - function so follow the function name
01:40 - with the set of parentheses and when i
01:42 - invoke this function once we will
01:44 - execute any code within this function
01:46 - once if i need to repeat this code three
01:49 - times i will just have to call this
01:50 - function three times
01:53 - we are calling our birthday function
01:55 - three times
01:57 - and there we go we have invoked this
01:59 - birthday function three times and we
02:01 - have accomplished our goal of singing
02:02 - three verses of happy birthday so
02:05 - basically that's all what a function is
02:07 - it's some subsection of code that is
02:09 - executed whenever you invoke it also
02:11 - known as calling a function a benefit to
02:13 - using functions is that if you think
02:15 - you're going to use some code more than
02:17 - once you can stick it within a function
02:19 - and then to repeat that code you just
02:21 - call the function as many times as you
02:23 - need so yeah those are functions if you
02:25 - would like a copy of this code i will
02:27 - post this to the comments section down
02:28 - below and in the next video we will
02:30 - discuss arguments and parameters so yeah
02:33 - that's the basics of functions in c
