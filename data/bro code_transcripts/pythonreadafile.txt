00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
00:01 - hope you're doing well and in this video
00:03 - we're going to be reading a
00:04 - file in python so sit back relax
00:07 - and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:12 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:16 - help keep this channel running
00:18 - welcome back guys and gals in this video
00:20 - i'm going to explain how we can read the
00:22 - contents of a file using python
00:24 - so we'll probably need some sort of file
00:26 - to work with i created a plain text file
00:29 - called
00:30 - test.txt it's a plain text file and all
00:33 - this says
00:33 - is omg you can read this have a nice day
00:37 - like comment and subscribe so what i
00:40 - would like to do is to read
00:41 - the contents of that file line by line
00:43 - and printed to the console window and
00:45 - here's how
00:46 - and honestly we only need two lines of
00:47 - code to do this so
00:49 - what we'll do is type with open then
00:52 - within the open function
00:53 - list the name of your file or the file
00:57 - path this file of mine is within my
00:59 - project folder
01:00 - so i only need to list the file name if
01:03 - this was someplace else you'll probably
01:05 - need
01:05 - the file path so let's say this was on
01:08 - my desktop
01:09 - well i'll probably need to list the file
01:12 - path of where that file is located
01:14 - and i'll need to use double backslashes
01:16 - because that's the escape sequence for a
01:19 - backslash
01:19 - but since this file is within my project
01:22 - folder i only need to list the file name
01:24 - so with open then the name of your file
01:27 - or the file path
01:29 - as file then what we're going to do
01:33 - is print file
01:36 - dot read and that is it so
01:39 - let's test it and it works omg
01:42 - you can read this have a nice day like
01:45 - comment and subscribe
01:46 - so this will actually close files
01:49 - automatically
01:50 - after opening them so that's kind of
01:52 - convenient and let's just test that
01:53 - theory
01:54 - so i'm going to print file dot
01:57 - closed if my file is in fact closed this
02:00 - will print
02:01 - true if it's still open this will print
02:03 - false
02:04 - so normally when you read a file it's
02:06 - normally open and you need to close it
02:08 - manually
02:09 - but if you write your program this way
02:11 - with open
02:12 - this will close the file automatically
02:14 - for you so
02:15 - using with open will close any files
02:18 - automatically for you
02:19 - after they've been opened however this
02:22 - does not
02:22 - catch and handle any exceptions that
02:25 - might occur
02:25 - like if we cannot locate this file so
02:28 - let's say that i mistyped the extension
02:30 - for this file
02:31 - let's say that i type in test.tx
02:35 - that's kind of funny because tx is the
02:37 - abbreviation for
02:38 - texas it's a texas file so this will
02:41 - cause
02:42 - a file not found error and this will
02:44 - interrupt
02:45 - the flow of our program and we would
02:47 - probably like to prevent that
02:48 - so what we could do is write a try and
02:50 - an accept block
02:51 - so we will try all of this code if we
02:54 - cannot find
02:55 - this file we can handle this exception
02:57 - file not
02:58 - found error so we'll place all of this
03:00 - code within the try block
03:02 - then if an exception happens we will
03:04 - catch that exception
03:05 - except we would like to catch any file
03:08 - not found air
03:09 - exceptions and let's handle this by
03:12 - printing
03:14 - that file was not found
03:18 - so if i were to run this again we will
03:21 - catch and handle this exception and this
03:23 - will not interrupt the normal flow of
03:25 - our program
03:26 - well everybody that's how to open and
03:28 - read a file in python
03:30 - if you'd like a copy of all this code i
03:32 - will post this in the comment section
03:34 - down below
03:35 - but yeah that's how to open and read a
03:37 - file using python
