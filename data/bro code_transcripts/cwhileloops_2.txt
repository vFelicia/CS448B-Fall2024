00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
00:02 - hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to explain
00:05 - while loops in c-sharp
00:06 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - all right while loops a while loop will
00:14 - repeat some code
00:15 - while some condition remains true we'll
00:17 - write a small program
00:18 - where we will ask a user to enter in
00:20 - their name if they do not enter in
00:22 - anything we will keep on prompting them
00:24 - to enter their name they have to enter
00:25 - something
00:26 - in order to escape the loop so this is
00:28 - what we'll do to begin with
00:30 - let's create a prompt to ask a user for
00:32 - their name i'll use a write statement
00:34 - instead of a writeline statement
00:36 - and let's say enter your name
00:40 - and then we will declare a string
00:42 - variable named name
00:45 - console.readaline
00:48 - and then store that within variable name
00:50 - and then at the end of our program
00:52 - we'll say hello plus name
00:55 - okay so after running this what if a
00:58 - user doesn't type in anything like they
01:00 - just had enter
01:01 - hello and then there's nothing here so
01:04 - what if we
01:04 - try and force the user to enter in
01:06 - something we can write this code within
01:08 - a while loop so after we accept user
01:12 - input for the first time let's check
01:13 - that user input
01:15 - and we'll use a while loop our condition
01:17 - will be while
01:18 - name is equal to an empty string we will
01:21 - prompt the user again
01:22 - to enter in something for their name and
01:25 - we do
01:26 - not need to declare name twice name
01:28 - equals console.readline so let's try
01:30 - this again our condition is
01:32 - we will continue this while loop this
01:34 - section of code as long as
01:36 - name equals an empty string if they just
01:38 - hit enter so let's try it
01:40 - okay enter your name i'm going to hit
01:41 - enter enter your name no
01:43 - enter your name no and to your name no
01:46 - okay i'll type in something
01:47 - hello bro so with a while loop you'll
01:50 - need some way to eventually exit the
01:52 - while loop
01:53 - otherwise that is known as an infinite
01:55 - loop and here's an example of an
01:56 - infinite loop
01:57 - i'm going to say while one is equal to
02:00 - one
02:02 - and then let's display something else
02:03 - such as
02:06 - help i'm stuck in
02:10 - an infinite loop so basically we have no
02:14 - way to change this condition
02:15 - so it's always going to be true and we
02:18 - will repeat this code forever
02:20 - so let's try it again
02:23 - okay enter your name help i'm stuck in
02:26 - an infinite loop
02:28 - so with a while loop you'll eventually
02:30 - want some way to eventually exit the
02:32 - while loop
02:33 - now to optimize this code we don't
02:35 - technically need this right statement
02:37 - here because we will ask that within
02:39 - the while loop and i'm going to declare
02:42 - string name
02:43 - and assign this an empty string so this
02:46 - would work the same as before as well
02:48 - so enter your name i do not type in
02:50 - anything and we
02:52 - are prompted again to type in our name
02:53 - and i'll type in something
02:55 - well okay then everybody those are while
02:57 - loops they will repeat
02:59 - some code while some condition remains
03:02 - true
03:02 - and it will do so infinitely until this
03:05 - condition
03:06 - becomes false if you would like a copy
03:08 - of this code i will post this to the
03:10 - comment section down below
03:11 - if you can give this video a thumbs up
03:13 - drop a random comment down below
03:15 - and well those are wild loops in c sharp
