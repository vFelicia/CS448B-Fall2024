00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well and in
00:03 - this video i'm going to teach you guys
00:04 - all about
00:05 - object-oriented programming in java so
00:07 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:12 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:16 - help keep this channel running
00:18 - hey welcome back this video is the start
00:20 - of the object-oriented programming
00:22 - portion of the series
00:23 - the abbreviation people use is oop also
00:26 - pronounced as
00:27 - oop now objects they can be intimidating
00:30 - but they're really not that bad once you
00:31 - get to know them
00:32 - so look around you right now you are
00:34 - surrounded by different objects
00:36 - next to me i have a phone a desk a
00:38 - computer
00:39 - and a coffee cup you can hear me
00:41 - knocking on it right now unfortunately
00:43 - it's empty
00:44 - so we can use programming to imitate
00:46 - objects in the real world
00:48 - anything you can think of really an
00:50 - object uses a class
00:52 - for example i have a class called car
00:54 - and we're going to be constructing some
00:56 - car objects so with objects
00:59 - they contain attributes and methods
01:02 - think of attributes as the
01:03 - characteristics
01:05 - that this object has and methods as the
01:08 - different actions
01:09 - that this object can perform for example
01:11 - let's list some of the attributes of
01:14 - a coffee cup these are the
01:15 - characteristics of my coffee cup
01:18 - so for example let's say that the color
01:20 - of this coffee cup is white
01:22 - i could store this within a string
01:24 - variable within the class called color
01:26 - and we can assign this a string value
01:28 - such as white
01:29 - what about a temperature that could be a
01:32 - double variable
01:33 - and let's say that this is room
01:34 - temperature at 20 degrees celsius
01:37 - and then what about a status like if
01:39 - it's empty
01:40 - or is it full this could be a boolean
01:43 - value such as
01:44 - true or false and unfortunately my
01:46 - coffee cup is empty
01:48 - so empty well equals true now what kinds
01:51 - of methods
01:52 - what kinds of actions can this coffee
01:54 - cup perform
01:55 - let's say we have to a drink method and
01:58 - when we call this method
01:59 - we can print a message such as you drink
02:02 - from the cup
02:03 - or what about a spill method if we were
02:06 - to call the spill method in case
02:08 - i decide to spill my coffee everywhere
02:10 - we could say you spilt your coffee
02:12 - everywhere
02:13 - so all an object really is is a bundle
02:16 - of defining
02:17 - attributes and methods the
02:19 - characteristics of an object
02:21 - and what actions that this object can
02:23 - perform
02:24 - and for today's video we're going to be
02:26 - creating some car
02:27 - objects why because well i like cars
02:30 - so we need to create a different class
02:33 - another class
02:34 - so you can either do this within the
02:36 - same java file or a separate java file
02:39 - so if you were to create a class within
02:41 - the same java file
02:43 - make sure that you declare this class
02:45 - outside of the main class that you're
02:46 - working with
02:47 - but i like to keep my code organized
02:50 - into different java files
02:52 - so for me i'm going to create another
02:54 - java file
02:55 - so within my project folder i'm going to
02:57 - go to file new
02:58 - class and i'm going to call this class
03:01 - car because we're constructing
03:02 - car objects and then click finish so i
03:05 - have
03:06 - two classes within my project folder one
03:09 - called main
03:10 - for you it may be named something
03:11 - different and a car class
03:13 - so we're going to be using this card
03:15 - class to define
03:17 - the attributes and methods of what our
03:19 - cars should have
03:21 - but if you decide to write this within
03:22 - the same java file you'll probably write
03:25 - something like this but
03:26 - i'm just going to keep these as separate
03:28 - files now what kinds of attributes
03:30 - should our car have
03:32 - let's start defining a few let's say a
03:34 - make and model these could be string
03:36 - variables
03:37 - so let's say string make and pick one of
03:40 - your favorite cards
03:41 - let's say string make equals
03:44 - chevrolet and we could also have a model
03:48 - like string
03:49 - model equals corvette because i like
03:52 - corvettes
03:55 - what about a year this could be an
03:57 - integer int
03:58 - year and let's say this is a 2020
04:01 - chevrolet corvette what about a color
04:05 - string color equals
04:08 - maybe blue
04:11 - and what about a price this could be a
04:15 - double variable such as
04:17 - double price let's say that this car
04:20 - is 50 000 us dollars
04:24 - and zero cents
04:28 - probably enough attributes for this
04:29 - example now what kinds of actions
04:32 - what kinds of methods would we like our
04:34 - car objects to be able to perform
04:36 - let's define two methods a method
04:39 - for drive and a method for break so
04:42 - let's define these
04:43 - let's say void drive and what do we want
04:47 - to do when we call this drive function
04:50 - let's have a simple print line statement
04:52 - that says
04:53 - you drive the car let's also create
04:57 - a method called brake void
05:00 - brake system.out.printline
05:06 - you step on the brakes
05:11 - and that should be good for this example
05:13 - so these are all of the attributes of
05:15 - the car
05:15 - the defining characteristics and these
05:18 - are the methods
05:19 - what actions our car object can perform
05:22 - now let's head back to our main class
05:24 - this is how to construct an instance of
05:27 - another class
05:27 - we're going to be constructing a car
05:30 - object so first we begin with the name
05:32 - of the class
05:33 - which is car next we can create a unique
05:36 - name for this instance of the class this
05:39 - unique
05:40 - car object and i will just call this
05:43 - my car to keep it simple equals
05:47 - new and then the name of the class again
05:52 - by a set of parentheses then a semicolon
05:55 - so my car now has these attributes
05:59 - it's a 2020 chevy corvette that's blue
06:02 - and the price is 50 000 and it has two
06:06 - methods
06:06 - a drive method and a break method so
06:10 - let's display some of the
06:11 - characteristics of this car
06:13 - we can do that within a print line
06:15 - statement
06:16 - and if we want to display or access one
06:19 - of the attributes of this car
06:21 - we type in the name of the car which is
06:23 - my car
06:25 - dot and then whatever attribute you want
06:27 - to display
06:28 - let's display the model so
06:31 - when we run this we'll create a car
06:33 - object and it's called
06:34 - my car and we're going to print the
06:36 - model and in the console window it's
06:38 - going to display the model
06:40 - let's display a few of the other
06:42 - attributes too
06:43 - so let's repeat the process we type in
06:46 - the name of the object
06:48 - the name of this object is called my car
06:50 - i would like to access the make this
06:52 - time
06:53 - and the make is an attribute a variable
06:56 - found within this class
06:57 - so this is going to print the make and
06:59 - the model and this is a
07:02 - chevy or chevrolet corvette now
07:05 - what if we want to access or perform one
07:08 - of these methods
07:09 - it's the same process as before really
07:11 - so we type in the name of the object
07:14 - dot and then the method we would like to
07:16 - call
07:17 - so we are looking for the drive method
07:20 - and that is right here
07:23 - and let's turn these two lines into a
07:25 - comment
07:27 - so we're going to call the drive method
07:30 - of my car
07:32 - and it says you drive the car in the
07:34 - console window
07:35 - now let's apply the brakes so
07:39 - we type in the name of the car or the
07:40 - object dot
07:42 - and we're going to use the break method
07:44 - this time
07:46 - you step on the breaks now with classes
07:49 - we can reuse a class to instantiate
07:52 - multiple instances of this class
07:54 - meaning that we can reuse this class to
07:56 - create multiple objects
07:58 - not just one so let's reuse this car
08:01 - class
08:01 - to create a second car let's pretend
08:04 - that we own
08:04 - two cars now so let's repeat the steps
08:07 - for creating
08:08 - a car so we type the name of the class
08:11 - car
08:12 - and we need a unique name for this car
08:15 - object
08:15 - let's call this car my car 2 i guess
08:19 - equals new car and i think i'm going to
08:23 - rename my car as my car one
08:26 - so my car is no longer recognized so
08:28 - let's just change the name to my car
08:30 - one so this will display the make and
08:33 - the model of my car one
08:34 - and it's still a chevrolet corvette now
08:37 - let's display the make and the model of
08:39 - my car
08:40 - 2 following these same steps so in order
08:43 - to display these
08:44 - let's write this within a print line
08:45 - statement so we are working with
08:48 - mycar2 we are going to type that name
08:51 - mycar2 followed by whatever we want to
08:54 - access
08:55 - we would like to access the make as well
08:57 - as the model
08:58 - so i'm going to change this to my car 2
09:01 - dot model
09:02 - and i'll add a print line statement just
09:04 - to help separate these within the
09:06 - console window
09:07 - so what we get is that both of these
09:10 - cars
09:10 - my car 1 and my car 2 are both
09:13 - chevrolet corvettes so the reason behind
09:16 - this
09:16 - is that with our car class it's acting
09:19 - as a blueprint
09:20 - and we're saying that whenever we
09:22 - construct an instance of this class
09:24 - a car object all of them are going to be
09:28 - chevrolet corvettes the year 2020
09:30 - they're blue
09:31 - and they are all 50 000 and they only
09:34 - have a drive and brake
09:36 - method and to solve this problem because
09:39 - we don't want all of our cars to be
09:41 - chevrolet corvettes i mean that wouldn't
09:43 - be a bad problem to have in real life
09:45 - though but it's not practical for
09:47 - programming so what we're going to be
09:48 - doing in the next
09:50 - video is learning about constructors how
09:52 - we can construct
09:54 - objects that have different
09:55 - characteristics different attributes
09:58 - so that all of our objects are not the
10:00 - exact same
10:01 - so if you would like a copy of all this
10:03 - code i'll post all of this in the
10:04 - comments down below
10:05 - but yeah that's an introduction to
10:07 - object-oriented programming in java
10:11 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
10:13 - learned something new
