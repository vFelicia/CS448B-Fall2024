00:00 - hey what's going on everybody today
00:01 - we're going to create an interactive
00:03 - image gallery using HTML and CSS so
00:06 - let's get started before you do jump in
00:08 - I would recommend downloading three
00:10 - pictures of your choosing I have a
00:12 - picture of a pizza a salad and soup if
00:16 - you're able to try and find images that
00:18 - are roughly the same height and width
00:20 - once you have your three or more images
00:22 - we are ready to begin
00:24 - we'll begin with the first image I'll
00:26 - use a div element
00:29 - and I will give this development
00:31 - a class of gallery because it's well
00:35 - part of our image gallery I will include
00:37 - my image
00:39 - image The Source attribute will be the
00:42 - relative file path of the image if you
00:44 - have a lot of pictures I would recommend
00:46 - creating an images folder you know what
00:48 - let's actually do that it'd be good
00:49 - practice new folder
00:52 - images
00:54 - I'll move all of these images to my
00:56 - images folder
01:01 - all right
01:02 - so I will list the relative file path I
01:05 - need to navigate to the images folder
01:06 - but of course you can use your own
01:08 - pictures depending on what you're
01:09 - building exactly
01:11 - images dot I think that was a JPEG all
01:14 - right so this picture is massive
01:16 - in case somebody is using a screen
01:18 - reader it's good practice to add an
01:20 - alternative attribute then give a
01:22 - description of the image
01:24 - salad I'll turn this image into a
01:27 - hyperlink by surrounding it with a pair
01:30 - of anchor tags
01:33 - we can open this image in a new tab by
01:36 - setting the target attribute to equal
01:38 - underscore blank
01:41 - then I will set the hrep attribute to be
01:44 - the source of my image
01:47 - I'll just copy and paste that just
01:50 - temporarily I'm going to set a width for
01:52 - this image width equals 200.
01:55 - what we'll do now is add a description
01:58 - it's entirely optional but I think it
02:00 - would look nice I will create a new
02:03 - development
02:06 - with a class of
02:09 - description
02:11 - I will type the word salads we'll do
02:14 - some CSS styling a little bit later
02:16 - let's copy this entire development
02:19 - paste it twice
02:22 - then we just need to change the images
02:24 - we're using my second image is soup
02:31 - I'll change the alternative text as well
02:35 - and the description
02:36 - soups
02:38 - then my last image is pizza
02:46 - the description will be pizzas
02:50 - all right let's go to our style sheet
02:53 - we are selecting our Gallery class
02:56 - I will set the display property to be an
02:59 - inline block
03:01 - currently these images are Block Level
03:03 - elements
03:05 - now they're all lined up
03:07 - I'll add a border
03:10 - border one pixel solid
03:13 - let's go with a dark gray color I'll use
03:16 - hsl values
03:21 - I'll set the lightness to 60 percent
03:25 - I'll add margin of 5 pixels
03:30 - the margin is applied outside of these
03:33 - developments if I were to increase this
03:35 - you can see the difference
03:37 - I'll keep that as five though let's work
03:39 - on the description for each image
03:42 - we are accessing our Gallery class
03:45 - then within the gallery class we have
03:47 - the description class
03:50 - that should be
03:52 - these developments
03:56 - let's add a little bit of padding
03:58 - 10 pixels
04:01 - then text align Center
04:05 - not bad when we hover over one of these
04:08 - elements let's change the Border color
04:12 - we are taking our gallery
04:14 - we'll apply the hover pseudo class then
04:18 - change the border and make it a little
04:19 - bit darker
04:22 - I'll set the lightness to be
04:25 - like 20.
04:26 - there we are
04:28 - now the Border changes when we hover
04:30 - over one of these elements
04:33 - I'm going to delete these with
04:35 - attributes
04:42 - then go to our style sheet we'll access
04:44 - our Gallery class
04:46 - with any images
04:48 - set the width
04:51 - to be 100 percent
04:54 - and height
04:56 - will be Auto
04:59 - then with the gallery class we can set
05:01 - the width
05:02 - 200 pixels
05:03 - so basically what we did is that we set
05:05 - the width of each image to be 100 of the
05:09 - width of our Gallery whatever this is
05:11 - set to if I were to set the width to be
05:13 - something larger then the size of each
05:15 - element would increase
05:17 - I think 200 is fine all right now let's
05:20 - test it if we click on one of these
05:22 - images we should see the full image in a
05:24 - new tab that's the salad image soup and
05:28 - pizza all right everybody so that is a
05:31 - simple image gallery using HTML and CSS
