00:02 - hey what's going on people
00:03 - in this video i'm going to show you all
00:04 - how we can pass an object as an argument
00:07 - so here's the rundown i have a class car
00:09 - cars have two fields
00:11 - a model and a color and a constructor to
00:13 - assign
00:14 - a model and color argument that we
00:16 - receive i have one car object
00:18 - car car one equals new car the model of
00:21 - this car is a mustang and the color is
00:23 - red
00:24 - so i'm going to create a method that
00:25 - will change the color of my car
00:28 - but i have to pass in a car object so
00:30 - let's create a method to handle that for
00:32 - us
00:33 - public static void it's not returning
00:37 - anything and let's call this method
00:38 - change color and we'll need two
00:42 - parameters
00:43 - a car that we would like to change the
00:44 - color of so the data type is going to be
00:47 - car as well as a name for this parameter
00:50 - let's name whatever car object that we
00:52 - receive as just
00:53 - simply car and we need a color as well
00:55 - that would be a string
00:56 - string color then to change the color of
01:00 - this car
01:01 - i would type car dot color
01:04 - equals whatever color that we receive
01:07 - and that's it
01:08 - so now when we invoke this method we
01:10 - have to pass in a car object as well as
01:12 - a color
01:14 - so that would be change color and the
01:17 - car object that i will pass in as an
01:19 - argument
01:19 - is car 1 the name of the object as well
01:22 - as a new color let's color this car
01:24 - silver
01:25 - and then let's display our cars color
01:28 - and
01:29 - model console.writeline
01:32 - car one dot color
01:36 - plus all out of space plus car one
01:40 - dot model and this should change the
01:42 - color of our car
01:43 - to a silver mustang so to pass an object
01:48 - as an argument
01:48 - you need to make sure that you have the
01:50 - right parameter set up you type
01:51 - the data type of this object followed by
01:54 - a name for this parameter
01:56 - then when you invoke this method you
01:57 - have to pass in the name of the object
01:59 - let's try something a little bit
02:00 - different let's create a method to
02:03 - copy an object so let's get rid of this
02:05 - change color method but we'll keep our
02:07 - car object
02:09 - so we'll create a method to return a
02:12 - car object so public
02:15 - static instead of void the data type
02:18 - is the type that we're returning we're
02:21 - returning a car
02:22 - object so replace void with car
02:25 - then we need a name for this method
02:27 - let's call this copy
02:28 - so we will pass in a car object the data
02:31 - type
02:32 - is car and i will name this argument
02:34 - that we receive
02:35 - as car now one thing that we can do to
02:38 - copy a car object is return a
02:41 - new car and then we'll need to pass in
02:46 - a model and a color so the model
02:49 - of this car is car dot model and the
02:52 - color
02:53 - is car dot color
02:56 - now if i would like to copy car 1 and
02:59 - create a second car
03:00 - a copy of it i can type car car 2
03:04 - equals copy and then i will pass
03:07 - this object as an argument and then
03:10 - let's display the fields
03:11 - of car 2 and i bet it's a red mustang
03:15 - oh yeah there we go so we successfully
03:17 - created a copy of car 1
03:20 - by returning a car object so yeah that's
03:23 - how to pass
03:24 - objects as arguments you just have to
03:25 - list the data type of the object
03:28 - since we're working with cars we had to
03:29 - set up a car parameter
03:31 - then if you would like to return an
03:33 - object instead of void you would replace
03:35 - void with the data type of the object
03:37 - you would like to return
03:39 - and if you would like to return a new
03:41 - object like what we did with this copy
03:43 - method
03:44 - you would return a new and then call the
03:47 - constructor of whatever object you would
03:49 - like to create and return
03:50 - so that's why we called the car
03:52 - constructor and then we returned that
03:55 - new car
03:55 - back to this spot here so it's kind of
03:57 - like we replaced this method with
04:00 - calling the car constructor something
04:02 - like that
04:03 - so yeah that's how to pass objects as
04:06 - arguments
04:06 - as well as return objects from methods
04:09 - too so yeah if this video helped you out
