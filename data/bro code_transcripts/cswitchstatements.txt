00:02 - all right welcome back people switches a
00:05 - switch is a more efficient alternative
00:07 - to using many else if statements it
00:10 - allows a value to be tested for equality
00:12 - against many cases here's an example of
00:15 - where a switch would be useful i have a
00:17 - small program we will tell a user to
00:19 - enter in a letter grade and depending on
00:21 - their grade we will print a custom
00:23 - message if grade equals a we'll print
00:26 - perfect else if grade equals b will
00:29 - print a different message so on and so
00:31 - forth so it's considered bad practice to
00:34 - use a lot of else if statements a better
00:36 - alternative is to use a switch here's
00:39 - how we can create one
00:41 - type switch parenthesis curly braces
00:45 - whatever value you would like to examine
00:47 - for equality placed within the
00:49 - parentheses i would like to examine my
00:52 - grade and now we need to write some
00:54 - cases
00:55 - case
00:56 - and then some value you would like to
00:58 - test for equality
01:00 - so i am comparing characters i will
01:02 - write the character a
01:04 - colon
01:05 - then if these values match we will
01:07 - execute some subset of code kind of like
01:09 - an if statement
01:11 - let's print
01:14 - perfect
01:17 - and then add a break afterwards
01:20 - then you can add another case
01:24 - so case b
01:27 - you did good
01:30 - okay see
01:33 - you did
01:34 - okay
01:37 - case d
01:39 - at least it's not enough
01:45 - case f
01:47 - you failed
01:49 - now you can add a default case this
01:51 - functions like an else statement if no
01:54 - other cases match we will execute
01:56 - whatever's within our default case
01:59 - so that means there are no matching
02:01 - letter grades
02:03 - so let's print please enter only valid
02:07 - grades
02:08 - and let's test it
02:11 - enter a letter grade a
02:14 - this will print perfect whatever's
02:16 - within our matching case
02:18 - let's try it again
02:20 - b you did good
02:24 - see you did okay
02:27 - d at least it's not enough
02:33 - f
02:33 - you failed
02:35 - and if there are no matching cases we
02:37 - will execute our default case uh how
02:39 - about w for win
02:42 - please enter only valid grades the
02:44 - reason that we add breaks after each
02:46 - case is so we can break out of our
02:48 - switch and exit let me show you what
02:50 - this looks like if we do not have any
02:52 - breaks
02:55 - now let's say that we have a c letter
02:57 - grade
02:58 - you did okay at least it's not enough
03:01 - you failed please enter only valid
03:03 - grades so the reason that we have breaks
03:06 - is to exit out of our switch if we have
03:08 - a matching case and there are no breaks
03:10 - we will continue executing each case
03:12 - that comes after so it is important to
03:14 - have those breaks if you want to exit
03:16 - out of your switch well yeah that's a
03:18 - switch everybody it's a more efficient
03:21 - alternative to using many else if
03:23 - statements using a few elsif statements
03:25 - is okay but it's considered poor
03:27 - practice to use a lot of them so yeah
03:30 - those are switches if this video helped
