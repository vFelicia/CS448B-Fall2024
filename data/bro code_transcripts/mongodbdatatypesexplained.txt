00:00 - all right everybody it's about time I
00:01 - discuss some basic data types in mongodb
00:04 - we will Begin by inserting a new
00:06 - document into our students collection
00:10 - db.students.insert1 we're inserting a
00:13 - document add a set of curly braces the
00:16 - first data type I'll discuss is a string
00:18 - suppose we have a field of name a string
00:21 - is a series of text within quotes these
00:23 - can be either double quotes or single
00:25 - quotes but typically I like to put them
00:27 - within double quotes a string is a
00:29 - series of text like a name
00:31 - Like Larry strings can contain spaces we
00:35 - can enter in a first name space then a
00:37 - last name Larry Lobster
00:39 - they can also contain numbers
00:42 - larry123 however in a string we treat
00:44 - the numbers differently we read the
00:46 - Morris characters rather than actual
00:48 - numbers
00:50 - so let's stick with name Larry that's a
00:53 - string it's a series of characters then
00:55 - we have integers and integer is a whole
00:58 - number
00:59 - let's create a field for age Larry will
01:02 - be 32. whole integers don't contain
01:05 - decimal portions it wouldn't make sense
01:07 - to enter in 32.5 we don't really keep
01:10 - track of people's half birthdays and
01:12 - stuff so age would be a whole number
01:14 - those are integers whole numbers
01:17 - then we have doubles a double is a
01:20 - number that contains a decimal portion
01:22 - maybe a grade point average
01:25 - grade point averages typically contain
01:27 - decimals Larry has a 2.8 GPA
01:31 - it's a double because there's a decimal
01:33 - portion
01:34 - integers are whole numbers doubles are
01:37 - numbers that contain a decimal
01:39 - then we have booleans booleans are
01:42 - either true or they're false it's kind
01:45 - of like a light switch it's only on or
01:47 - off there's only two states
01:49 - let's create a field for full time
01:52 - is the student full time this can be
01:54 - either true or false
01:57 - Larry is too busy working out all the
01:59 - time he is a part-time student not a
02:02 - full-time student we'll set that field
02:04 - to be false date objects are pretty
02:06 - popular in mongodb suppose we have a
02:10 - registration date
02:12 - register date
02:13 - to create a date object you can use the
02:15 - new keyword followed by a call to the
02:18 - date Constructor if you don't pass any
02:20 - arguments to the date Constructor you'll
02:22 - use the current time in the UTC time
02:25 - zone
02:25 - otherwise you can pass a date in time
02:27 - like 2023 January 2nd you could add a
02:32 - time too
02:34 - but we'll just stick with the current
02:36 - date and time that's assigned to us
02:38 - those are date objects
02:40 - the next data type is null no means no
02:43 - value I'll create a field for a
02:45 - graduation date
02:47 - and I will set that to be null
02:50 - Larry is a current student but we don't
02:52 - know when he's going to graduate all
02:54 - we're really doing is creating a
02:55 - placeholder we don't have a date yet so
02:58 - we can set that to be null that's to be
03:00 - filled in later
03:01 - so null means no value then we have
03:05 - arrays much like in modern programming
03:07 - languages is kind of like a variable
03:09 - that has more than one value but in
03:12 - mongodb we have a field that can have
03:14 - more than one value let's create a field
03:17 - of courses what courses is Larry
03:20 - enrolled in place all values within a
03:23 - set of straight brackets
03:25 - let's insert multiple values what
03:28 - courses is Larry in maybe he's in
03:30 - biology
03:32 - these values are all comma separated
03:35 - chemistry
03:38 - then calculus
03:41 - so that's an array they're all enclosed
03:44 - within a set of square brackets they
03:46 - allow one field to contain multiple
03:48 - values then we have nested documents
03:51 - this would be good for an address to
03:54 - create a nested document you use a set
03:55 - of curly braces within the nested
03:58 - document we can list some field value
04:00 - pairs how about a street
04:04 - let's come up with a street name one two
04:06 - three fake street is good
04:10 - than a city
04:15 - big Keeney bottom
04:18 - and a zip code
04:21 - one two three four five
04:23 - it is possible to have documents within
04:25 - documents which is what we did with the
04:27 - address let's enter everything to see if
04:29 - it works yeah that was acknowledged
04:33 - let's head to Compass
04:35 - refresh and here is Larry name Larry h32
04:39 - GPA 2.8 full time is set to false he's a
04:43 - part-time student here is Larry's
04:45 - registration date and time we're using
04:47 - the UTC time zone
04:49 - his graduation date is set to null all
04:52 - of his courses that he's in is stored
04:54 - within an array and his address is
04:57 - stored as a nested document alright
04:59 - everybody and those are a few basic data
05:01 - types you should know in mongodb
