00:01 - bro hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to show you
00:04 - all how we can run a python file using
00:06 - command prompt
00:07 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:13 - hey y'all in today's video i'm going to
00:14 - show you all how we can run a python
00:16 - file with command prompt
00:18 - so first we'll need a script to work
00:19 - with let's just make a very simple
00:22 - program
00:22 - let's say print hello world and then
00:26 - maybe we will ask for some user input
00:28 - name equals input what's
00:32 - your name and then at the end we will
00:35 - print the word hello
00:39 - plus the user's name okay so
00:42 - let's save this to a place that will
00:44 - remember perhaps my desktop
00:46 - now to save this file to a separate
00:48 - location go to
00:50 - file save as you can pick a name for
00:53 - this python file
00:54 - then to directory click these three dots
00:57 - and pick a location you want to save
00:59 - this to
01:00 - to make this easy i'm going to save this
01:01 - python file to my desktop
01:03 - and then click ok so the name of this
01:06 - python file of mine is
01:07 - hello underscore world dot py then click
01:11 - ok
01:12 - now our second step is to open command
01:14 - prompt to open command prompt just
01:16 - search
01:17 - for cmd if you're using mac i believe
01:20 - it's terminal
01:21 - step number three is that we need to
01:23 - navigate to the directory that contains
01:25 - our python file
01:26 - i saved this python file to my desktop
01:28 - so if you right click on your file
01:30 - and go to location you can just copy
01:32 - this address
01:34 - now within command prompt type cd to
01:36 - change directory
01:37 - space and then paste that directory
01:40 - that contains your python file hit enter
01:44 - and for the last step we need to invoke
01:46 - the python interpreter by typing
01:48 - python space and then
01:51 - the name of the script and the name of
01:53 - my script is hello
01:55 - underscore world dot p y hit enter to
01:59 - run
01:59 - the script hello world what is your name
