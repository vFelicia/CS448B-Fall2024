00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well and in
00:03 - this video i'm going to teach you guys
00:04 - how
00:05 - border layout managers work in java so
00:07 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please

00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:16 - help keep this channel running
00:18 - let's discuss border layouts a border
00:21 - layout is used within a container to
00:23 - place components in one of
00:24 - five major areas they are north south
00:27 - west east and center so here's some code
00:30 - that i've written for an example
00:31 - you don't need to copy this we'll get to
00:33 - this later i have created
00:35 - five separate panels and i gave them all
00:37 - a unique
00:38 - color i have attached one of these
00:40 - panels to one of the borders
00:42 - so panel one is attached to the north
00:44 - then panel two to the west
00:46 - east south and then center let's see
00:48 - what this looks like
00:51 - so lo and behold this is a border layout
00:55 - the center panel will expand in size
00:57 - proportionately
00:58 - to the size of the frame the top and
01:01 - bottom borders
01:03 - they will expand horizontally but not
01:06 - vertically when you resize this frame
01:08 - and with the west and the east borders
01:11 - they will expand
01:12 - vertically but not horizontally when you
01:15 - expand this frame here's some uses of a
01:17 - border layout you can use the north
01:19 - border for some sort of
01:20 - title you can use the west or the east
01:23 - border for some sort of sidebar or
01:26 - navigation bar you can use the south
01:28 - border
01:29 - for some sort of footer for your program
01:32 - and the
01:32 - center border you can use this for the i
01:35 - would say
01:36 - main part or main body of your program
01:39 - so let's recreate what we witnessed step
01:42 - by step
01:42 - so first we'll need a jframe so jframe
01:45 - frame
01:46 - equals new j frame
01:50 - frame dot set default close operation
01:54 - j frame dot exit on close
01:59 - let's set a size so frame dot set size
02:04 - i'll make this 500 by 500
02:08 - and frame dot set visible and set this
02:11 - to true
02:13 - let's create some panels
02:17 - so jpanel we'll call this panel one
02:22 - equals new j panel
02:26 - and we'll create the other panels as
02:28 - well so
02:30 - two three four five
02:36 - let's give them all a color so let's
02:39 - begin with panel one
02:40 - panel one dot set
02:43 - background and this was red so color dot
02:48 - red
02:52 - let's do the same for the others so we
02:54 - have panel two three
02:56 - four five the second panel
02:59 - this was green but you can pick whatever
03:02 - colors you want
03:03 - doesn't matter 3 was yellow
03:07 - 4 was magenta and 5 was blue
03:14 - and before we add these panels to our
03:16 - frame we need to set up the frame
03:18 - with a border layout so this is normally
03:21 - the default layout manager but
03:23 - you'll need to do this for other layout
03:25 - managers though so to change
03:27 - the layout manager you type in the name
03:29 - of the container in this case it's our
03:30 - frame
03:31 - dot set layout and then you pass in a
03:35 - new layout manager so if we want to set
03:38 - up a container with a border layout we
03:40 - type in
03:41 - new border
03:44 - layout so for
03:47 - our frame this isn't going to do
03:48 - anything but if you're doing this with a
03:50 - panel or other container
03:52 - you would need to set this up with a new
03:54 - border layout
03:55 - and lastly we just need to add these
03:57 - panels to our frame
03:59 - so frame dot add
04:02 - what are we adding we're adding a
04:03 - component our panel so let's add panel
04:05 - one
04:06 - and then to set a component to one of
04:09 - the borders
04:10 - when you add this component you add a
04:13 - comma
04:14 - and then type in border layout
04:17 - dot and then the direction so we can set
04:20 - this to north if we want this attached
04:22 - to the top
04:24 - so now at the top of this program we
04:26 - have a red
04:28 - bar our red panel this will expand
04:32 - uh horizontally but not vertically and
04:34 - we can actually change the dimensions on
04:36 - this
04:37 - so this is panel one uh changing the
04:40 - width won't do anything but we can
04:42 - change the height though for this
04:44 - so if we set this to 50
04:48 - you can see it has half the height now
04:50 - but the width
04:51 - still expands to accommodate the size of
04:53 - the frame
04:55 - let's add the other panels so it's the
04:56 - same process as before
04:59 - frame dot add let's add panel 2
05:02 - and panel 2 we'll put on the west so
05:05 - border layout dot
05:06 - west and then we have
05:10 - the screen sidebar that you saw
05:12 - previously
05:13 - so this will expand vertically but
05:16 - not horizontally and we can even change
05:19 - the dimensions for this
05:20 - so this time i'm going to change the
05:22 - width to 50
05:24 - and the height will stay the same
05:25 - because it doesn't really matter
05:28 - so now the width of this panel is cut in
05:31 - half because we changed this from 100
05:34 - to 50 and let's finish by adding the
05:36 - others
05:38 - so panel three this will be on the east
05:42 - so borderlayout.east
05:47 - here's our east panel and then
05:50 - we have south so this will be panel four
05:54 - border layout dot south
06:00 - and then of course center
06:04 - so panel five border layout
06:07 - dot center
06:13 - just like this so one option available
06:15 - to you
06:16 - is that you can add margins between
06:18 - these components
06:19 - this is how we can do that so when we
06:21 - set a container
06:23 - our frame with a new border layout
06:26 - when we pass in a new border layout we
06:29 - can actually send in
06:31 - some margins for the width and margins
06:33 - for the height so let's say that we want
06:36 - 10 pixels of margin for the width and
06:39 - 0 for the height this is what this might
06:41 - look like
06:44 - so with the west and the east panels
06:48 - they have 10 pixels worth of margin
06:51 - now let's do that with the height this
06:54 - time
06:55 - so now we'll have 10 pixels of margin
06:59 - for the width and the height between all
07:01 - these panels
07:03 - so now all these components are now
07:05 - separated
07:06 - by 10 pixels worth of margin so if you
07:09 - need to add margin
07:10 - between components you can just pass
07:12 - them in when you create a new border
07:14 - layout
07:15 - here's an advanced trick that you can do
07:17 - with these panels
07:18 - they can also act as a container with
07:20 - their own layout manager
07:22 - and they use something called a flow
07:23 - layout manager by default
07:25 - so let's say that we want to add some
07:27 - panels within our center panel
07:29 - kind of like sub panels this is how we
07:31 - can do that
07:32 - so i'm just going to copy everything we
07:34 - have just to save time
07:36 - beginning when we create these instances
07:38 - of our panels to when we set the size
07:40 - for the panels so i'm just going to add
07:44 - a comment that these are sub panels
07:53 - so it's the same process as before
07:55 - really but let's call these panels
07:57 - six seven eight nine
08:00 - and ten and we're going to change the
08:03 - colors for these as well so
08:05 - make sure to change the name
08:09 - okay so with panel six let's say that
08:11 - this is black
08:13 - panel 7 will be dark
08:17 - gray panel 8 will just be gray
08:21 - panel 9 will be
08:24 - light gray and panel 10 will just be
08:28 - white
08:31 - so we need to set panel 5
08:35 - with a new border layout
08:39 - uh with our frame we added a new border
08:42 - layout to this but now
08:43 - panel 5 is also acting as our container
08:47 - so we can set this with its own unique
08:49 - layout manager
08:50 - so with panel 5 set this to a new border
08:54 - layout
08:54 - then we need to set a preferred size for
08:57 - each of these panels
08:59 - so that's six seven eight nine and ten
09:03 - and let's say that these are all going
09:04 - to be fifty by fifty
09:07 - i'm just going to copy this a bunch of
09:09 - times to save time
09:11 - 7 8 9 10.
09:20 - all right now we can add these sub
09:23 - panels
09:24 - to panel 5 which is the center panel so
09:27 - it's the same process that we did
09:28 - with our frame so instead of saying
09:31 - frame
09:32 - panel 5 is going to act as the container
09:34 - so panel five
09:35 - dot add let's add panel six so panel six
09:40 - comma then if we want to add this to the
09:42 - north border
09:43 - we type in border layout dot
09:46 - north and this is what this currently
09:50 - looks like so we have a panel
09:53 - within another panel and let's add the
09:56 - others
09:57 - so panel five dot add panel seven
10:04 - uh but make sure you change this to a
10:05 - different border so let's change that to
10:07 - the south
10:10 - there we go
10:15 - so panel five dot add panel eight let's
10:18 - add this to the west
10:25 - here it is panel five dot add panel nine
10:30 - this will go on the east
10:36 - and then lastly we have the center panel
10:38 - so that's panel five dot add panel ten
10:41 - border layout dot center
10:47 - and there it is i don't really see the
10:49 - point of this but
10:50 - i just wanted to let you know that you
10:51 - can do stuff like this
10:53 - so that's the basics of using border
10:56 - layouts in java if you want a copy of
10:57 - all this code i'll post all of this in
10:59 - the comments down below
11:00 - but yeah that's how border layouts work
11:03 - in java
11:04 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
11:07 - learn something new
11:08 - then you can help me help you in three
11:11 - easy steps
