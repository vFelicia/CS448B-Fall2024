00:00 - hey everybody in this topic I'm going to
00:02 - explain if statements and if statement
00:04 - is used to do some code only if some
00:08 - condition we set is true else we could
00:10 - do something else it's a basic form of
00:13 - decision making if it's true we do
00:15 - something if it's not true we don't do
00:17 - it let's ask a user for their age age
00:20 - equals input
00:23 - enter your age I will type cast the
00:27 - input as an integer
00:30 - depending on what the user's age is we
00:33 - can do one of a few things let's pretend
00:35 - that the user would like to sign up for
00:37 - a credit card but in order to do so
00:39 - their age needs to be greater than or
00:41 - equal to 18. well we can check that to
00:44 - use an if statement type if
00:46 - then some condition what would we like
00:49 - to check let's check to see if the
00:51 - user's age is greater than or equal to
00:54 - 18 then add a colon then hit enter
00:58 - any code underneath the if statement
01:00 - should be indented make sure to pay
01:02 - attention to that because that's easy to
01:04 - miss
01:05 - if the user's age is greater than or
01:07 - equal to 18 let's print you are now
01:11 - signed up
01:15 - if I were to run this code I'll type in
01:17 - my age I'll type 21 hit enter
01:20 - this statement is true therefore we will
01:23 - execute any code found within the if
01:25 - statement you are now signed up what if
01:28 - this condition was not true
01:31 - let's say my age is 13.
01:33 - well nothing happens
01:35 - if the condition we check is instead
01:37 - false we skip over this code if you need
01:41 - to take a different course of action you
01:43 - could add an else statement
01:46 - if this is true do this else we can do
01:50 - something else
01:52 - let's print a different message
01:54 - you must be 18 plus to sign up
02:01 - I'll type in my age again I'll say that
02:03 - I'm 13. hit enter you must be 18 plus to
02:07 - sign up that's basically an if statement
02:09 - do some code only if some condition is
02:14 - true else you could do something else
02:16 - entirely it's a basic form of decision
02:18 - making the else statement is kind of
02:21 - like a last resort we can check more
02:23 - than one condition before reaching the
02:25 - else statement we can add an else if
02:28 - statement
02:29 - which we just shortened to e-l-i-f
02:32 - meaning else if
02:34 - else if let's check if age is less than
02:37 - zero
02:40 - then we'll print a different message
02:43 - you haven't been born yet
02:49 - now if I run this code
02:51 - I'll say that my age is negative one
02:54 - this condition is false we skip this
02:57 - code
02:58 - this condition is true therefore we will
03:01 - execute this code
03:02 - and we skip the else statement you
03:05 - haven't been born yet
03:07 - let's add another elsif statement you
03:09 - can add as many elsif statements as you
03:11 - want let's check to see if somebody's
03:13 - age is greater than or equal to 100
03:16 - we'll print a different message
03:19 - let's print
03:21 - you are too old to sign up
03:26 - if I were to say my age is 111 years old
03:31 - well it states you are now signed up the
03:34 - reason that we didn't reach this part of
03:35 - our elsif statement that's because this
03:38 - condition is still technically true
03:41 - you do need to pay attention to your
03:43 - order of if and else if statements if I
03:45 - want to be sure that nobody over 100 is
03:48 - signing up I should probably move this
03:50 - to the beginning
03:54 - if age is greater than or equal to 100
03:58 - then else if age is greater than or
04:00 - equal to 18 we'll do something else
04:05 - and to your age I am 111 years old
04:07 - you are too old to sign up so those are
04:10 - if statements if some condition is true
04:12 - do something else if you can check
04:15 - something else
04:17 - if no above conditions are true you
04:19 - could do something else entirely it's
04:21 - kind of like the default here's another
04:23 - example we'll ask a user if they would
04:25 - like some food
04:27 - response equals input
04:32 - would you like food
04:36 - we'll have the user type in y for yes or
04:40 - n for no
04:45 - if our response
04:48 - now to check to see if two values are
04:50 - equal you would use double equals
04:54 - if the response is equal to
04:57 - y
04:58 - then we will print
05:01 - have some food
05:04 - the doubles equal sign is the comparison
05:06 - operator
05:08 - it will check to see if two values are
05:10 - equal you don't want one equals because
05:13 - that's the assignment operator python in
05:15 - this case thinks we're attempting to
05:17 - assign the character y to response so
05:20 - for comparisons use double equals
05:25 - else we can print
05:29 - no food for you
05:33 - so would you like food I'll type why
05:36 - have some food
05:39 - let's try it again I'll type no and for
05:42 - no
05:43 - no food for you
05:46 - here's a third example we'll have a user
05:48 - type in their name name equals input
05:52 - enter your name
05:57 - if our name is equal to an empty string
06:01 - that means they didn't type in anything
06:04 - so let's yell at the user
06:07 - you did not type in your name
06:15 - else we will print using an F string
06:19 - hello whatever the name is
06:23 - enter your name I'm just going to hit
06:25 - enter you did not type in your name
06:28 - let's run this again I'll type in my
06:31 - name
06:32 - and we have executed the else statement
06:34 - this time hello bro
06:37 - so one important thing that you should
06:39 - know is the use of boolean's width if
06:42 - statements suppose we have some Boolean
06:45 - variable named for sale I'll set this to
06:48 - be true now using an if statement you
06:51 - can just use the Boolean variable in
06:53 - place of a condition because a condition
06:55 - would evaluate to be true or false
07:00 - we could just say if for sale if that's
07:04 - true then let's print
07:07 - this item is for sale
07:13 - else we will print
07:17 - this item is not for sale
07:21 - for sale is set to be true
07:24 - this item is for sale
07:26 - if this variable were false
07:29 - well then the item is not for sale
07:32 - let's try a different variable how about
07:34 - online
07:36 - if
07:38 - online
07:41 - the user is online
07:44 - else
07:45 - the user is
07:48 - offline
07:49 - so the user is offline
07:53 - I'll change the Boolean to true
07:56 - the user is online
07:58 - so with if statements you can either
08:00 - write a condition or you could use a
08:02 - Boolean
08:04 - all right everybody so those are if
08:05 - statements do some code only if some
08:09 - condition is true else you can do
08:11 - something else it's a basic form of
08:14 - decision making and those are if
08:16 - statements in Python
