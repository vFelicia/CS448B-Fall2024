00:02 - hey uh welcome back in this video i'm
00:04 - gonna show you how we can add borders to
00:06 - html elements so to create a border we
00:09 - need to set a border style well the
00:12 - default is none but let's set this to
00:14 - maybe solid for a solid line
00:16 - there's a couple other styles too like
00:19 - dashed
00:20 - dotted
00:22 - double
00:23 - ridge
00:24 - groove
00:26 - inset
00:27 - and
00:28 - outset we can change the border width by
00:32 - setting the border width property to
00:35 - some amount of pixels
00:36 - maybe five
00:38 - you can change the border color border
00:41 - dash color and pick a color
00:43 - i like gold let's stick with gold
00:46 - you can round to the corners by setting
00:48 - a border radius
00:50 - border dash radius the higher the number
00:53 - the smoother the rounding
00:55 - and i would like to add a little bit of
00:57 - spacing between my letters and my border
01:00 - so i can add some padding
01:04 - so we have a little bit of spacing
01:06 - between our text and our border
01:08 - now let's change our h1 header tag
01:13 - you can specify a border side such as
01:16 - top bottom left right
01:18 - border so we have bottom top left right
01:22 - i will set the border top
01:24 - style to maybe dotted
01:28 - i'll do the same thing with the bottom
01:29 - because i think it'll look cool
01:32 - and maybe the left side as well border
01:35 - left style
01:37 - let's make this
01:39 - i don't know double
01:41 - with the width color and radius you can
01:43 - also specify a side as well so let's
01:46 - change specifically the left border
01:48 - border dash left
01:50 - width and i'll set this to 10 pixels and
01:54 - i'll change the color to border left
01:56 - color
01:58 - i like silver let's pick that
02:00 - so yeah that's how to add borders to
02:02 - html elements whatever element you would
02:04 - like to add a border to you can set a
02:06 - given style and we covered a few of them
02:09 - solid is a very basic border you can
02:11 - change the width color radius and you
02:14 - can add padding and you do have the
02:16 - capability to change specific sides of
