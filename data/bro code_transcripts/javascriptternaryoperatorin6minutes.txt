00:00 - hey uh welcome back so today I'm going
00:02 - to explain the Trenary operator in
00:04 - JavaScript you write a condition then
00:07 - add a little question mark kind of like
00:09 - you're asking a question how is this
00:10 - useful well it's a shortcut to if and
00:14 - else statements it helps to assign a
00:16 - variable based on a condition you write
00:19 - a condition then use the ternary
00:21 - operator as if you're asking a question
00:23 - you can write some code if that
00:25 - condition is true what would you like to
00:27 - do then add a colon then some code if
00:31 - that condition is false here's an
00:33 - example let's say we have a user's age
00:36 - age equals 21. I would like to check to
00:40 - see if somebody's age is greater than or
00:42 - equal to 18. age greater than equal to
00:47 - 18 then I will use the ternary operator
00:50 - kind of like I'm asking a question
00:52 - is age greater than or equal to 18 if
00:56 - this condition is true we can write some
00:59 - code I'll create a string
01:01 - you're an adult
01:05 - then what if the condition is false I'll
01:07 - add a colon
01:09 - then I will execute this code if the
01:11 - condition is false
01:13 - you're a minor
01:18 - this is helpful if you need to assign a
01:20 - variable based on a condition
01:23 - so I'll create a new variable let
01:26 - message equals
01:29 - then we write our condition
01:31 - so if age is greater than or equal to 18
01:35 - if that's true we will assign this
01:37 - string to this variable this message if
01:40 - it's false instead we will assign this
01:43 - one it's an alternative to writing
01:45 - something like this
01:57 - so with programming we try not to repeat
01:59 - ourselves if we don't have to
02:01 - here we're assigning message to be
02:04 - either this string or this one
02:07 - our ternary operator is more condensed
02:09 - and I feel like it's easier to read than
02:11 - that if else statement
02:14 - it's a shortcut if you choose to use it
02:16 - I tend to use it a lot then just to test
02:19 - it let's console.log our message just to
02:22 - be sure that it works fine
02:24 - console.log our message
02:27 - our age is 21 you're an adult if my age
02:30 - was 12.
02:31 - you'll remind her let's go over a few
02:34 - more exercises
02:37 - this time we will have let time time
02:40 - will be between 1 and 24 like a 24 hour
02:43 - clock I will set time to be 16.
02:48 - 16 I think would be 4 P.M
02:51 - we will assign a greeting
02:54 - equals then we'll write a condition is
02:58 - time less than 12.
03:00 - the enternary operator like we're asking
03:03 - a question
03:04 - if the time is less than 12 it's the
03:06 - morning good morning
03:10 - we'll use a colon then write some code
03:12 - if it's false
03:14 - if it's not the morning it's at least
03:16 - the afternoon good afternoon
03:20 - then let's console.log
03:22 - our greeting
03:26 - good afternoon because it's 4 P.M what
03:29 - if it was 9. good morning
03:31 - all right I have a few more examples
03:35 - foreign
03:39 - student this will be true or false if
03:43 - you're a student
03:45 - let message equals
03:49 - now with the Boolean variable you can
03:51 - just write the Boolean variable itself
03:54 - is student question mark are you a
03:57 - student if so
03:59 - you are a student
04:02 - if not
04:04 - you are not a student
04:10 - then let's console.log
04:14 - our message
04:17 - we are a student you are a student let's
04:19 - set this to be false you are not a
04:22 - student
04:23 - it's very easy to read with Boolean
04:25 - variables you write the Boolean variable
04:28 - then add a question mark
04:30 - here's a challenge round
04:32 - we will have a purchase amount as if
04:35 - somebody's buying something if
04:37 - somebody's purchase amount is over one
04:39 - hundred dollars they get a 10 discount
04:42 - so let
04:44 - purchase amount equal let's say 125
04:49 - dollars or some other unit of currency
04:51 - of your choosing
04:53 - let
04:55 - discount
04:57 - equals
04:59 - then the condition is
05:01 - we're checking if purchase amount is
05:03 - greater than or equal to 100 100
05:07 - question mark
05:10 - is somebody's purchase amount greater
05:11 - than one hundred dollars
05:14 - if so they will get a 10 discount
05:18 - colon
05:20 - if that's false they get no discount
05:22 - zero
05:25 - so then let's display the total
05:27 - console.log
05:30 - I'll use a template literal
05:33 - your total is I need a dollar sign for
05:37 - our unit of currency then I need a
05:39 - placeholder so I need another dollar
05:40 - sign
05:42 - the purchase amount
05:46 - minus
05:49 - the purchase amount
05:51 - multiplied by let me scoot over a little
05:56 - the discount
05:59 - divided by 100
06:03 - so the total since we get a discount
06:06 - is one hundred twelve dollars and fifty
06:09 - cents if our purchase amount was ninety
06:12 - nine dollars well we don't get that
06:14 - discount your total is 99.
06:17 - all right everybody so that's the
06:18 - Trenary operator it's a shortcut to an
06:21 - if else statement it helps to assign a
06:23 - variable based on a condition you write
06:25 - a condition add a question mark as if
06:28 - you're asking a question do this code if
06:30 - that condition is true else do this code
06:33 - if that condition is false I'll be using
06:36 - the ternary operator a lot just because
06:38 - I feel like it's helpful and well that
06:40 - is the ternary operator in JavaScript
