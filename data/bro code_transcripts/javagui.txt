00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well
00:03 - this is my new and improved java swing
00:05 - tutorial series and in this video i'm
00:07 - going to teach you guys how we can
00:09 - create a
00:10 - simple jframe that we can later add
00:12 - components to
00:13 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:18 - if you find this video helpful please
00:19 - remember to like
00:21 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:23 - help keep this channel running
00:25 - okay everybody so let's create a jframe
00:28 - so a jframe is a gui window
00:31 - to add components to we're not going to
00:33 - be adding any components in this video
00:35 - but in the next video we're going to
00:36 - cover
00:36 - labels so to begin let's create an
00:39 - instance of a jframe
00:41 - so jframe let's call this frame equals
00:44 - new j frame so this
00:48 - creates a frame for us an instance
00:51 - of a frame however we'll need an import
00:54 - so we'll add that at the top
00:55 - import java x dot swing dot j frame
00:59 - so if we were to run this it's actually
01:01 - not visible
01:02 - so we need to set the visibility to true
01:05 - so we'll add that the end
01:07 - frame dot set visible
01:10 - and we're going to set this to true
01:14 - so this will make frame
01:17 - visible so we can actually see it now
01:20 - however it is very small so
01:24 - let's increase the size so we can do
01:26 - that by saying
01:27 - the name of the frame dot set
01:30 - size so we can pass in a dimension
01:34 - or a width and a height and this is in
01:37 - integers
01:38 - so let's say this frame will be 420 by
01:40 - 420 because 420 is a funny number
01:43 - so this sets the
01:47 - x dimension and
01:50 - y dimension of our frame
01:55 - and this should be visible now here's
01:58 - our jframe
01:59 - let's set some other things let's change
02:01 - the title so we can do that by saying
02:04 - frame dot set title and we can set this
02:07 - to
02:08 - a string i'll call this
02:11 - j frame title goes
02:15 - here and this will display at the top
02:19 - so set this to whatever you want your
02:21 - title for your window to be
02:24 - so this sets title of
02:27 - frame now pay attention to this
02:30 - so when we hit this x button in the
02:33 - corner it's going to actually
02:35 - hide our frame but not actually close
02:37 - out of the program
02:39 - so if you want to close out of the
02:41 - program and exit
02:42 - we're going to change a setting we're
02:44 - going to use
02:46 - frame dot set default close
02:49 - operation and we're going to set this to
02:51 - jframe
02:52 - dot exit on close
02:55 - so when we hit that x button it's going
02:57 - to exit out of
02:59 - application and by default it's normally
03:03 - hide on close so it appears that we
03:05 - killed the application but it's still
03:07 - running in the background
03:09 - otherwise there is do nothing on close
03:13 - and you can actually prevent somebody
03:15 - from hitting the x button to close out
03:17 - of the frame which is actually kind of
03:19 - annoying but
03:20 - that's how you can do that but let's set
03:21 - this back to exit on close because we
03:24 - want to exit out of the application
03:26 - when we hit that x button now another
03:29 - thing that we can do
03:30 - is that we can resize our window
03:34 - so we can actually prevent that so we're
03:36 - going to say
03:37 - frame dot set
03:41 - resizable false
03:45 - what this will do is prevent
03:48 - frame from being
03:52 - resized
03:55 - so we can no longer resize this even if
03:57 - we tried
03:58 - we can no longer make this full screen
04:00 - either with the maximize button
04:02 - so here's something else for you guys
04:04 - how do we change the icon
04:05 - for the top left of our frame window
04:08 - normally it's the
04:10 - java logo but we can actually change
04:12 - that to something that suits our program
04:13 - better
04:14 - so i'm actually going to use the logo
04:16 - for my channel
04:17 - and change the icon from the java logo
04:20 - to my logo so if you want feel free to
04:24 - pause the video and download an image
04:25 - that you might want to use
04:27 - here's my logo i'm going to change the
04:29 - icon of my frame
04:31 - to this logo instead of the default java
04:33 - logo
04:34 - so what i'm going to do is copy this go
04:37 - to my project folder
04:38 - and then paste it so then we're going to
04:42 - create an
04:42 - image icon out of this so image
04:46 - then icon let's call this image just
04:48 - image
04:49 - equals new image icon
04:53 - and then we're going to list either the
04:55 - file path or the file name
04:57 - since this is within my project folder i
05:00 - only have to list
05:01 - the file name so this file name is
05:04 - logo.png
05:08 - logo.png and then we're going to need
05:11 - another import
05:12 - so java x dot swing dot image icon at
05:15 - the top
05:16 - so this will create an image
05:20 - icon and now what we're going to do
05:23 - is set the image icon of the frame
05:27 - so we'll say frame dot
05:30 - set icon image
05:33 - and within the parentheses of this
05:35 - method here we're going to say image
05:37 - dot get image
05:41 - so this will change icon
05:45 - of frame so then
05:48 - if we tried this our image is now
05:52 - at the top left of our frame in place of
05:54 - the java logo that was there by default
05:57 - pretty cool huh now let's change the
06:00 - background color of our frame
06:02 - so what we're going to do is that we're
06:05 - going to say
06:06 - frame dot get
06:10 - content pain
06:13 - we're going to have to do a little bit
06:14 - of method chaining followed by
06:17 - dot set background
06:21 - and then you can place a color within
06:23 - here so there's a few basic colors
06:26 - such as color dot let's say green
06:32 - and then we're going to need an import
06:33 - as well so make sure to include this at
06:35 - the top
06:37 - java.awt.color so this will
06:39 - change color of background
06:44 - so now this window should be green
06:47 - however you might not like some of the
06:49 - default colors you can create a custom
06:51 - color too
06:52 - so within the set background method
06:56 - we're going to say new
06:59 - color and we have a few options we can
07:02 - place
07:03 - some rgb values here or a hexadecimal
07:06 - color value
07:07 - so let's begin with some rgb values so
07:10 - all
07:10 - zeros this is black
07:15 - so the background is now black and this
07:17 - is on the range from 0 to
07:19 - 255 with
07:22 - 255 for all three values is
07:25 - just white so the first value is the
07:28 - amount of red
07:34 - and you can see it's as bright red as
07:35 - you can make it really
07:37 - the second value is green so that's 255
07:42 - and remember this is on a range of 0 to
07:44 - 255
07:46 - and the last one is blue
07:52 - so you can adjust the amount of red
07:54 - green and blue that you want
07:56 - so i'm just going to make up some random
07:58 - numbers 123
08:00 - 50 250.
08:03 - i have no idea what color this is so oh
08:06 - i actually
08:07 - really like that that's like a twitch
08:09 - purple
08:10 - so to say i think i'm keeping that
08:12 - actually i'm going to remember this
08:14 - number
08:14 - 123 50 250. all right you can also place
08:18 - a
08:18 - hexadecimal value here so you say
08:22 - 0x and then it's a
08:25 - series of six values
08:28 - so all zeroes would be black otherwise
08:32 - all f's
08:33 - would be white and if you don't believe
08:35 - me i'll prove you wrong
08:38 - so you can always go to google and look
08:40 - up hexadecimal
08:42 - color values and you can pick a color
08:43 - that you want so
08:45 - 1 2 3 4 5 6 would be
08:49 - this shade of blue which is actually
08:52 - pretty sweet uh
08:54 - otherwise you can really pick any color
08:56 - you want and put that here
08:57 - and the last thing that i got for you
08:58 - guys today in this video is that
09:01 - there are two i would say different ways
09:03 - in which you can create a frame the
09:05 - first is just to create an instance
09:07 - of a frame and give it a name and then
09:09 - you can change
09:10 - all of the members and properties of
09:12 - this frame by just saying the name of
09:14 - the frame
09:15 - dot and then whatever change you want to
09:17 - make the other way
09:18 - is that you can use a jframe as a parent
09:21 - class
09:22 - to a child class so i'll show you how to
09:24 - do that because i do this quite often in
09:26 - this tutorial series
09:28 - so what we're going to do is actually
09:30 - create another class that's going to be
09:32 - a child
09:32 - class of jframe so go to your source
09:35 - folder
09:36 - then go to file new class and i'll call
09:39 - this
09:40 - my frame so my frame
09:44 - extends j frame this is the subclass
09:48 - or child class and jframe is the parent
09:50 - class
09:51 - also known as the super class then we're
09:54 - going to need
09:54 - this import at the top as well so the
09:57 - other way in which we can create a
09:59 - jframe
10:00 - i'm actually going to copy this
10:04 - turn all of this into a comment because
10:06 - we won't really need it right now
10:09 - and then i'm going to create a
10:10 - constructor for my frame
10:13 - so this constructor is going to be
10:15 - called when we create an instance
10:17 - of my frame and i'm going to paste
10:20 - everything within here however we're
10:22 - going to replace
10:23 - the name of our frame and take out that
10:27 - line as well
10:28 - so instead of saying frame dot set title
10:31 - we're actually going to replace the word
10:33 - frame with the word
10:35 - this so an easy way that you can make
10:37 - these changes is go to
10:39 - edit find replace
10:42 - and we're going to replace frame
10:45 - with this and replace all
10:51 - so replace the word frame or whatever
10:54 - else you called your frame
10:55 - at this point with this and we're going
10:58 - to create an
10:59 - instance of the my frame class
11:02 - so we'll do that here so we're going to
11:05 - say
11:07 - my frame instead of jframe and let's
11:10 - call this
11:11 - my frame equals new my
11:15 - frame and this will do the exact same
11:18 - thing
11:18 - as all of this code where it creates a
11:23 - basically a duplicate of the frame we
11:25 - had
11:26 - so you don't necessarily need to create
11:29 - a
11:30 - name for this instance if you don't plan
11:32 - on
11:33 - using this name for anything so one
11:35 - thing that we can also do
11:37 - is take out this portion of the code if
11:39 - we don't really plan on using the name
11:42 - or a name for your my frame you can just
11:44 - say new my frame
11:47 - and this works as well however if you
11:49 - need to make some changes within
11:51 - this class to your my frame you might
11:54 - have to actually create a name for
11:56 - it all right so that's the basics of
11:59 - frames in java if you'd like a copy of
12:01 - all this code i'll post all of this in
12:03 - the comments down below
12:04 - but yeah that's how you can create a
12:06 - frame in java
12:09 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
12:12 - learn something new
12:13 - then you can help me help you in three
12:16 - easy steps
