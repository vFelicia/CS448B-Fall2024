00:00 - well hello again everybody in today's
00:02 - video I'm going to show you how we can
00:03 - work with check boxes in PHP we need a
00:07 - form element I have the action attribute
00:09 - set to my PHP file index.php for the
00:13 - method I'm using post
00:15 - to create a checkbox we can use a
00:17 - self-closing input tag the type will be
00:21 - check box
00:23 - and here it is
00:25 - if we were to use post we will get a key
00:28 - value pair from this checkbox element
00:30 - the key will be equal to our name
00:33 - attribute
00:34 - let's say that the name is pizza
00:37 - and for the value
00:39 - let's say pizza I'm going to capitalize
00:42 - the value just so that it's easier to
00:44 - differentiate between the key and the
00:47 - value the name is the key the value as
00:50 - well the value
00:52 - then let's add some text
00:54 - Pizza
00:55 - break element
00:57 - not sure why Google wants to translate
00:59 - this but okay
01:01 - let's copy these two lines of markup
01:03 - then paste them three additional times
01:07 - the second button will be hamburger the
01:09 - third will be hot dog the fourth will be
01:11 - taco
01:12 - let's change the names the values and
01:15 - the text
01:17 - the second checkbox is hamburger
01:24 - then hot dog
01:32 - then Taco
01:39 - here are the four check boxes then we'll
01:41 - need a submit button
01:43 - input type equal submit
01:48 - for the name that will be submit as well
01:53 - now within our PHP script when I press
01:56 - this button I would like to execute some
01:58 - code after we press the submit button I
02:01 - will enclose all of my code with an if
02:03 - statement we will check to see if our
02:06 - submit button is set we'll use the is
02:08 - set function
02:10 - we'll use the post variable
02:13 - we are accessing submit
02:15 - if we click the submit button then do
02:18 - stuff
02:19 - to check to see if a checkbox is set we
02:22 - can use the is set function again
02:25 - we'll use an if statement if is set
02:29 - now we are examining
02:31 - the key of pizza
02:34 - whatever the name attribute is set to
02:39 - if Pizza is set if it's checked what we
02:42 - want to do
02:43 - let's simply Echo
02:46 - you like pizza
02:52 - when I press Pizza click submit
02:55 - we will display you like pizza
02:58 - let's do this with the other check boxes
03:00 - let's copy this if statement paste it
03:02 - three times then we'll check the other
03:04 - Keys we have hamburger
03:07 - you like hamburgers
03:10 - hot dog
03:12 - you like hot dogs
03:14 - taco
03:16 - you like tacos
03:18 - oh then let me add a break after each of
03:20 - these sentences
03:22 - because I forgot to do that
03:25 - now I can press any combination of these
03:28 - check boxes
03:30 - if one of these check boxes is checked
03:32 - we'll execute one of these if statements
03:34 - you like pizza you like hot dogs you
03:36 - like tacos
03:38 - alternatively we can determine to see if
03:40 - a checkbox is empty using the empty
03:42 - function
03:43 - let's copy our if statements
03:46 - change is set to empty
03:50 - empty empty empty
03:53 - if Pizza is unchecked if it's empty
03:56 - we'll Echo you don't like pizza
04:01 - do this for hamburgers you don't like
04:03 - hamburgers hot dogs you don't like hot
04:06 - dogs and Tacos you don't like tacos
04:12 - if I were to click pizza and Tacos again
04:15 - then submit you like pizza you like
04:18 - tacos you don't like hamburgers you
04:21 - don't like hot dogs
04:22 - that's one way in which you can check to
04:24 - see if a check box is set you can use
04:26 - the is set function to determine if it's
04:28 - set or empty to determine if it's empty
04:32 - you can place all of these check boxes
04:34 - in an array but they would all need the
04:37 - same name attribute
04:39 - let's rename the name attribute to foods
04:41 - for all of these check boxes
04:44 - then add a set of straight brackets
04:47 - after each
04:50 - these will all be placed within an array
04:56 - let's get rid of our if statements
05:00 - after pressing the submit button let's
05:03 - create a Foods array
05:05 - then we will get via post
05:10 - the key name which is Foods
05:14 - Foods is technically going to be an
05:16 - array to prove it let's Echo Foods then
05:19 - see what happens
05:22 - Pizza hamburger hot dog taco
05:25 - warning a right to string conversion
05:27 - so Foods is an array
05:29 - we can access elements of an array with
05:31 - an index number
05:34 - Foods at index 0
05:36 - that would be Pizza
05:37 - one is hamburger
05:40 - two is hot dog
05:42 - three is Taco four should be out of
05:45 - bounds
05:46 - undefined array key for
05:48 - you can Loop through all of the elements
05:50 - of an array using a for each Loop
05:53 - for each
05:56 - list your array Foods as food
06:01 - then let's Echo each food
06:05 - then I will add a break
06:10 - Pizza hamburger hot dog taco
06:13 - all right everybody so that's how to
06:14 - work with check boxes in PHP the type
06:17 - set to checkbox the name attribute will
06:20 - be the key
06:21 - and the value as well the value
06:24 - you do have the option of placing all of
06:26 - these check boxes in the same group they
06:29 - would need the same name then add a set
06:31 - of square brackets after and well
06:33 - everybody that's how to work with check
06:34 - boxes and PHP
