00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well and in
00:03 - this video i'm going to teach you guys a
00:04 - few different ways in which we can
00:05 - create
00:06 - new windows using python so sit back
00:08 - relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - if you find this video helpful please
00:13 - remember to like
00:15 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:17 - help keep this channel running
00:19 - let's get started everybody so we're
00:21 - going to create a window and we'll add a
00:23 - button to this window when we click on
00:24 - this button
00:25 - it'll create a new separate window for
00:27 - us so window equals tk
00:29 - followed by window.mainloop we'll need
00:31 - to add a button so let's do that
00:33 - button we're adding this to the window
00:35 - let's add some text to the button
00:37 - let's say create new
00:40 - window and we'll set a command command
00:44 - equals and we'll need to define a
00:45 - function let's create a function called
00:48 - create
00:49 - underscore window and let's pack this as
00:52 - well
00:53 - so we will define this function create
00:55 - window and let's do so at the top
00:58 - def create window and what do we want
01:00 - this to do
01:01 - well we're going to create a new window
01:03 - and let's call this next window
01:05 - new underscore window equals and there's
01:08 - two popular ways of creating a window
01:10 - one is we can use tk and the other is
01:13 - that we can use
01:14 - something called top level and let me
01:17 - explain the difference between the two
01:18 - here's a definition for a top level
01:20 - window this is a
01:22 - new window on top of other windows and
01:25 - it's usually linked to a
01:27 - bottom window our main window is serving
01:30 - as the bottom window
01:32 - and our new window is serving as the top
01:34 - window the top
01:36 - level window so let's try this and just
01:38 - experiment
01:39 - here is our main window the bottom
01:41 - window and if we were to click on this
01:43 - button
01:43 - it's going to create a new window for us
01:46 - a new
01:47 - top level window if we were to close out
01:50 - of the bottom level window
01:52 - any top level windows associated with
01:54 - this would also close
01:56 - kind of like what you just saw now
01:57 - however it's not the same case
01:59 - the other way around if we have a bottom
02:02 - window and a top level window
02:04 - and we close out of the top level window
02:06 - our bottom level window
02:08 - is just fine it didn't close out of that
02:10 - so think of these
02:11 - like jenga pieces if you were to pull
02:14 - one of the pieces
02:15 - one of the windows out from underneath
02:17 - the bottom any
02:18 - pieces or windows on the top of it will
02:21 - close out as well
02:22 - or collapse kind of like in the game
02:23 - jenga so
02:25 - that's one way to think of top level
02:27 - windows they're stacked on top of any
02:29 - bottom level windows
02:30 - if you remove a bottom piece it removes
02:32 - any from the top on the flip side we
02:34 - have
02:35 - tk this is a new independent window and
02:38 - we've actually been doing this since
02:40 - day one of our gui programming tk is a
02:43 - new independent window and our main
02:46 - window and the new window that we create
02:47 - are not linked whatsoever they're
02:49 - completely independent so if we were to
02:51 - create a new window
02:53 - this is our new window and close out of
02:54 - our old window well this new window
02:57 - still persists so this could be useful
02:59 - for let's say
03:00 - a login form or a login screen after you
03:02 - log in you'll be brought to your main
03:04 - program which could be within
03:05 - the new window one other thing that you
03:07 - can do too you can also
03:09 - destroy the old window after creating a
03:11 - new window
03:12 - so we need to type in the name of the
03:14 - window that we want to destroy
03:16 - actually let's call the main window just
03:18 - old
03:19 - underscore window just to clarify things
03:21 - so let's rename that here
03:23 - here and here as well so we want to
03:26 - destroy
03:27 - our old window as if we're closing out
03:28 - of it so we type in the name of the
03:30 - window old underscore window
03:33 - and we use the destroy function and that
03:35 - sounds pretty sweet
03:37 - so we're going to destroy our old window
03:39 - after creating our new window
03:41 - so let me add a comment that this will
03:43 - close out
03:44 - of old window and let's test it
03:49 - so we have our old window our main
03:51 - window
03:52 - will create a new window it creates our
03:54 - new window and then closes out of the
03:56 - old window
03:57 - so that's one of the few ways in which
03:59 - you can create a new window for your
04:01 - program
04:02 - so if you want to copy all this code
04:03 - i'll post all of this in the comments
04:05 - down below
04:05 - but yeah that's how to create a new
04:07 - window using python
04:10 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
04:12 - learn something new
04:13 - then you can help me help you in three
04:16 - easy steps
04:17 - by smashing that like button drop a
