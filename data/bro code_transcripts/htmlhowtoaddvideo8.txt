00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
bro here and in this video I'm gonna
00:03 - teach you guys how you can add videos to
your web pages using HTML let's get into
00:08 - it
before we begin you're going to want to
00:12 - download a video or you could find one
on your computer that you want to use
00:16 - and place it within the same folder that
contains the HTML document that you plan
00:20 - on working with before I forget here are
the file types that html5 currently
00:26 - supports mp4 WebM and OGG if you don't
have a video to use I would recommend
00:33 - looking on your Facebook your Twitter
your Instagram you've probably posted a
00:37 - video at some point in your lifetime
and you can always download those too so
00:42 - if you have a video picked out place it
within the same folder that contains
00:45 - your HTML document that you plan on
working with the video that I'm gonna be
00:50 - using is that I was in Tokyo Japan some
time ago and there were some people
00:54 - go-karting on the streets and they were
dressed as characters from Mario Kart 64
00:59 - so this is the video I'll be using
01:06 - I'll be honest I was geeking out when I
saw that because I'm a huge Nintendo
01:11 - nerd if you have a video picked out then
we're ready to begin now we need to
01:15 - create a pair of audio tags between the
body tags of our HTML document so we're
01:21 - going to say a video and then we need a
closing video tag if you watched the
01:26 - last video on audio it's going to be a
very similar process so what we're going
01:31 - to do in the opening video tag is type
in the word controls let's see what we
01:37 - have so far I'm going to save and reload
now we have the controls for a video but
01:43 - this isn't linked to any video so we'll
need to do that so between the video
01:48 - tags we need to create a source tag and
within the source tag we're going to
01:52 - type SRC equals double quotes and within
the double quotes we're going to type
01:58 - the video file that we want to add to
the video controls and the video that I
02:04 - picked was called go underscore carts
dot mp4 so let's save this and reload
02:13 - all right here's that video however it's
messy and we know it's working we can
02:20 - actually go to the opening video tag and
we can use the height and the width
02:25 - attribute to change the dimensions of
this video and I'm just going to make up
02:30 - something we'll say height equals let's
say 250 and width equals 250 let's save
02:37 - this reload the page all right here's
the video it's a lot smaller however we
02:43 - have all this blank space underneath the
video so the dimensions aren't exact
02:48 - with how we currently have the height
and width attribute set up these are
02:52 - measured in pixels and if we were to
change one of these attributes let's say
02:57 - that we change width to 650 let's save
this in reload now we have all this
03:02 - white space on the left hand side as
well as the right hand side of our video
03:07 - and if we want to get rid of that white
space we need to make sure that we're
03:11 - increasing our height by a proportionate
amount depending on what our ratio is
03:16 - for this video but you can see that this
be somewhat annoying so another option
03:20 - instead of using pixels for our width we
can also give a percentage let's say
03:26 - that we want to have the width of our
video take up the entire screen while we
03:32 - can say 100% so let's save this and
reload that's a little bit better but
03:37 - let's eliminate the height now so we'll
just say with 100 these dimensions seem
03:43 - a lot better there's no white space
within that video player and the ratio
03:47 - is exactly what it needs to be for the
best quality and with this width
03:51 - attribute since we gave a percentage
this actually makes our video dynamic in
03:56 - case we resize our web browser here's an
example and you can also change the
04:06 - percentage if we were to place 50 here
instead of 100% this video will take up
04:13 - 50% of the width available to it within
the web browser and like I said before
04:18 - that's also dynamic so feel free to
adjust the height and the width
04:22 - attributes of your video depending on
what you need for your website at this
04:27 - point I'll be covering a few keywords
that you might be interested in adding
04:30 - to the opening video tag so if you add
the loop attribute this video will loop
04:37 - continuously so I'm just gonna mute it
because it can get kind of annoying
04:42 - after a while you can see that it just
keeps on restarting over you can also
04:46 - have a video be muted by default just
add the muted keyword and let's reload
04:54 - this alright so when we hit play you can
see that the volume is off it is muted
05:01 - and we can turn this back lastly we will
be discussing the autoplay attribute so
05:07 - to add autoplay to a video type in
autoplay within the opening video tag
05:12 - and just so you're aware this might not
work on all web browsers and it doesn't
05:17 - work on mobile devices from what I've
read now just make sure this autoplay
05:21 - attribute is added to the opening video
tag if you want this video to start
05:25 - automatically when somebody visits your
page and you can see that every time i
05:29 - refresh this page the video just starts
over again
05:33 - and one thing to make sure of is that if
you have a video with autoplay just as a
05:38 - common courtesy you'll want to be sure
to make this video muted because if
05:42 - somebody visits your website and you
have the video play automatically you'll
05:47 - want to be sure that it's playing
without sound because the user might be
05:51 - in a place that's private or quiet and
you don't want this video blasting sound
05:55 - as soon as they visit your webpage so if
you use the autoplay attribute just make
06:00 - sure you also make it muted as a common
courtesy
06:03 - oh and one cool thing you can do if you
want some sort of background video that
06:07 - the user can't interact with one thing
you can do is take out the controls so
06:12 - let's see what this does so we'll save
refresh and we can no longer interact
06:17 - with this video so this might have some
uses too well that will conclude this
06:22 - topic I will post the code that I have
in the comments down below and pin it to
06:26 - the top if you would like a copy for
yourself but yeah that is how to include
06:31 - a video on a webpage using HTML
