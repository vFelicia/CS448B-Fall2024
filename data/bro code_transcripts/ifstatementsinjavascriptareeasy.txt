00:00 - Hey so uh what's going on everybody
00:02 - today I gotta explain if statements so
00:04 - in JavaScript if a condition of our
00:06 - choosing is true we can execute some
00:09 - code if it's not true we can do
00:12 - something else that's how to put it
00:13 - simply for example let's say we have a
00:16 - user's age let age equals 25.
00:22 - to write a if statement we can type if a
00:24 - set of parentheses then a set of curly
00:26 - braces within the set of parentheses we
00:29 - can check a condition let's check to see
00:31 - if
00:32 - our age variable is greater than or
00:36 - equal to 18. if this condition is true
00:39 - we can execute whatever code is within
00:42 - the set of curly braces if this
00:44 - condition is true let's
00:46 - console.log a message
00:49 - you are old enough to enter this site
00:56 - my age is 25 this condition is true we
00:59 - will execute this code within the curly
01:00 - braces you are old enough to enter this
01:04 - site what if my age was 13.
01:08 - well if this condition is true we don't
01:11 - do this we don't execute it we skip over
01:14 - it if you would rather take a different
01:16 - course of action if you would rather do
01:19 - something else you can write an else
01:21 - clause
01:23 - if this is not true we will do
01:26 - whatever's within the else Clause let's
01:28 - display a different message
01:31 - you
01:32 - must be 18 plus 2
01:36 - enter this site my age is 13.
01:41 - we will end up displaying you must be 18
01:44 - plus to enter this site basically
01:46 - speaking if this condition is true do
01:49 - this else if not do this instead
01:54 - it's kind of like a fork in the road
01:55 - which path are we gonna take here's
01:58 - another example let's say we have
02:00 - variable time time will be in hours in
02:04 - military time
02:05 - if our time is 9 as in 9 am
02:10 - let's write a if statement
02:13 - if time
02:15 - is less than 12 as in noon
02:19 - then console
02:21 - DOT log
02:25 - good morning
02:28 - else if it's after 12 that means it's at
02:31 - least the afternoon
02:33 - console.log
02:37 - good afternoon
02:41 - the time is nine as in nine a.m good
02:44 - morning
02:45 - what if our time was 14 like 1400 in
02:49 - military time well then we will display
02:51 - good afternoon
02:54 - conditions also work very well with
02:56 - Boolean variables
02:58 - let's create a Boolean variable is
03:02 - student
03:04 - if you're a student say true if not then
03:07 - false
03:08 - now with the Boolean variable if you
03:10 - need to check the value with an if
03:12 - statement
03:14 - you can just place the Boolean variable
03:16 - within the condition itself
03:19 - the condition either evaluates to be
03:21 - true or false
03:23 - if is student is true then console.log
03:31 - Ura student
03:34 - else
03:36 - console.log
03:40 - you are not a student
03:44 - is student equals false
03:47 - we will execute the else Clause you are
03:50 - not a student If This Were true
03:53 - we'll execute the if Clause you are a
03:56 - student
03:58 - you can even create nested if statements
04:01 - this time we will have two variables let
04:04 - age equals some age
04:06 - and let has license as in a driver's
04:10 - license
04:11 - that's how to spell license
04:14 - has license will either be true or false
04:18 - so in the United States you need to be
04:20 - at least 16 years old to have your
04:23 - license
04:24 - we'll check that first
04:27 - if age is greater than or equal to 16
04:32 - Plus console.log
04:36 - you are old enough to drive
04:42 - else
04:44 - console.log
04:50 - you must be 16 plus to have a
04:56 - license
04:58 - if I changed my age to 15
05:03 - well I'm not old enough to have a
05:05 - license at least in the United States it
05:08 - might vary depending on your country let
05:10 - me know in the comments section how old
05:11 - you have to be to get a driver's license
05:13 - I'm kind of curious
05:15 - you can use another if statement within
05:17 - an if statement after we check to see if
05:19 - somebody is old enough to have a license
05:21 - let's check to see if they do have a
05:23 - license or not
05:25 - so I will add another if statement
05:27 - within our if statement pay attention to
05:30 - the indentation
05:32 - if
05:34 - has license
05:37 - since we're checking a Boolean variable
05:39 - that is going to be the condition itself
05:42 - it evaluates to be true or false
05:45 - if has license console.log
05:50 - you
05:51 - have
05:53 - your license
05:56 - else again pay attention to the
05:58 - indentation
06:00 - console.log
06:04 - you do not have your license yet my age
06:10 - is 15 I don't have a license this is the
06:13 - result
06:15 - you must be 16 plus to have your license
06:18 - since this condition is false we skip
06:21 - over everything within curly braces
06:23 - entirely
06:24 - if I set my age to be 18
06:28 - you are old enough to drive but I don't
06:30 - have a license that's set to false
06:33 - you do not have your license yet
06:35 - so we execute this condition so we enter
06:38 - anything within this set of curly braces
06:40 - we display this message then check the
06:43 - sift statement my condition is false
06:46 - then we will execute the else clause
06:49 - if I set has license to be true
06:53 - well then you are old enough to drive
06:55 - you have your license
06:57 - all right now I need to discuss else if
06:59 - statements
07:01 - we will keep our age variable
07:03 - we have our if statement
07:06 - if age is greater than or equal to 18
07:09 - then we will console.log
07:14 - you are old enough to enter this site
07:21 - else
07:23 - console.log
07:26 - you must be 18 plus to enter this site
07:32 - my age is 18 I can enter the site if my
07:36 - age was 12 I can't enter the site
07:39 - if there's any other conditions you want
07:41 - to check before reaching your else
07:43 - statement you can add an else if clause
07:47 - then you can check another condition
07:49 - let's check to see if somebody's age
07:52 - is less than zero your age can't be
07:55 - below zero let's let the user know
07:58 - console.log
08:00 - your age can't be
08:04 - below zero
08:06 - I will set my age to be negative one
08:10 - that's not possible
08:12 - your age can't be below zero
08:15 - since this condition is false we skip
08:17 - over this Clause then move on to the
08:19 - next condition else if this condition is
08:22 - true execute this clause which it was
08:25 - then it's not necessary to go to the
08:28 - else statement because we already
08:29 - executed one of these Clauses you can
08:31 - add as many else if statements as you
08:33 - would like let's add another
08:35 - else if
08:37 - let's check to see if somebody is over
08:39 - 100 years old
08:42 - age is greater than or equal to 100.
08:47 - console.log
08:51 - you are too old to enter this site
08:57 - okay now pay attention to this it's
08:59 - really important my age will be 101.
09:04 - you are old enough to enter this site
09:07 - so why didn't we execute this Clause our
09:10 - age is greater than or equal to 100 the
09:13 - order of our Clauses does matter we
09:16 - start at the top and work our way down
09:18 - and check all the conditions on the way
09:19 - down so with our first statement this if
09:22 - statement age is greater than or equal
09:25 - to 18 101 is greater than or equal to
09:28 - 18. we will execute this clause and skip
09:31 - over everything else that comes after
09:33 - even though this response is more
09:35 - appropriate for what we're looking for
09:37 - we still skip over it even though this
09:39 - is true because we executed this one
09:41 - first so I would recommend that we move
09:44 - this Clause to the beginning and change
09:47 - it to an if statement
09:48 - first let's check to see if age is
09:51 - greater than or equal to 100
09:53 - else if age is greater than or equal to
09:56 - 18 so this should work as intended
09:59 - our age is 101 you are too old to enter
10:03 - the site
10:05 - let's add another else if Clause so to
10:08 - check to see if two values are equal you
10:10 - gotta use the comparison operator which
10:12 - is two equal signs
10:13 - let me give you a demonstration
10:16 - else if
10:18 - let's check to see if somebody's age is
10:22 - directly equal to zero
10:24 - so be sure you're using two equal signs
10:26 - for a comparison not one one equal sign
10:29 - is the assignment operator
10:31 - you want two equal signs to see if two
10:33 - values are equal
10:35 - if somebody's age is exactly zero
10:38 - will display a custom message
10:41 - you can't enter you were just born if
10:47 - somebody's age is zero they're a baby or
10:50 - an infant
10:51 - so let's set our age to be zero
10:55 - you can't enter you were just born
10:58 - this condition is false we skip this
11:00 - Clause this condition was true we
11:03 - execute this clause and Skip everything
11:05 - else that comes after using all this
11:07 - code let's work on an exercise we're
11:09 - going to create a text box and a button
11:11 - so somebody can submit their age then
11:13 - depending on what they enter we will
11:15 - display a message so within our HTML
11:17 - file we'll create a few things
11:20 - let's create a label
11:22 - the text on the label will be enter your
11:25 - age
11:27 - let's add a break after
11:30 - then a text box
11:32 - the label will be input the type will be
11:35 - text
11:37 - the ID will be my text
11:42 - I'll add a break
11:44 - we'll create a submit button
11:47 - button
11:48 - type equals submit
11:52 - the ID will be my submit
11:56 - the text on the button will be submit
12:01 - I will also create a paragraph element
12:04 - the ID
12:06 - let's say is result
12:09 - element to display a result
12:12 - all right that is everything we'll need
12:14 - so we can't see the paragraph element
12:16 - quite yet the text content of the result
12:19 - element will be one of these lines of
12:21 - text
12:22 - so let's go back to our index file
12:25 - we'll create our elements I will set
12:27 - them to be constants
12:29 - const
12:31 - my text
12:34 - equals document dot get element by ID
12:40 - the ID is going to be my text
12:45 - and const
12:47 - my submit that's the submit button
12:50 - document.getelementbyid
12:53 - the ID is going to be my submit
12:57 - then lastly
13:00 - result element
13:02 - const
13:03 - result element equals
13:07 - document.getelementbyid the ID is result
13:09 - element
13:11 - let's scoot these if statements down
13:13 - when I click on the button we will
13:15 - execute a function
13:17 - the button is named my submit
13:21 - my submit dot on click attribute equals
13:25 - a function
13:26 - when we click on the button what are we
13:28 - going to do
13:29 - let's take all of our if else if and
13:31 - else clauses
13:33 - cut them
13:34 - then paste them within the function for
13:37 - the button
13:38 - when we click on the button then we will
13:40 - check our age
13:42 - let's set this variable to be undefined
13:45 - then we will get our age from the text
13:47 - box
13:48 - H equals
13:51 - my text Dot value get the value from the
13:55 - text box
13:57 - and assign it to age but remember when
13:59 - we get text from a text box it's a
14:01 - string data type we need to Typecast it
14:04 - to a number so we will set age to equal
14:08 - then use the number function to convert
14:11 - it to a number
14:12 - then we can check our age
14:14 - we'll replace console.log with the text
14:17 - content of the result element result
14:20 - element dot text content equals our
14:25 - message
14:26 - I'll use a template literal so I'll use
14:28 - backticks
14:30 - let's copy our text paste it within the
14:33 - template literal then I will delete the
14:36 - console.log message
14:38 - so we'll just follow this pattern result
14:40 - element dot text content equals our
14:44 - message
15:10 - all right let's see if this works
15:13 - so we will type in our age let's say I'm
15:15 - 25 press submit
15:17 - and we have one problem let's see what's
15:19 - going on
15:21 - oops okay so I forgot to add a set of
15:23 - parentheses after the function
15:25 - let's add that
15:27 - let's say I'm 25 press submit you are
15:30 - old enough to enter this site
15:32 - let's say I'm 12 you must be 18 plus to
15:35 - enter the site what if I'm 101
15:38 - you are too old to enter the site what
15:40 - if I'm zero
15:41 - you can't enter you were just born
15:44 - I'm negative one
15:47 - your age can't be below zero all right
15:49 - everybody so that is everything you need
15:51 - to know to get started working with if
15:53 - statements in JavaScript
