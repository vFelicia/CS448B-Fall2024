00:00 - hey what's going on everybody so today
00:01 - I'm going to explain switches a switch
00:03 - can be an efficient replacement to using
00:06 - many else if statements here's an
00:08 - example of a program I wrote without
00:10 - using a switch we have a day day will
00:13 - normally be the number 1 through 7even
00:15 - if day equals 1 will console.log it is
00:18 - Monday which you can see here if day was
00:21 - two well then it's Tuesday all the way
00:23 - up to 7 which is Sunday I do have an
00:26 - else statement that states our day
00:29 - variable is not a day for example if I
00:31 - set day to be I don't know like a string
00:33 - of
00:34 - pizza well then Pizza is not a day but
00:37 - it really should be if you find yourself
00:40 - using a lot of else if statements I
00:42 - would instead recommend creating a
00:44 - switch here's how to create one we'll
00:47 - keep our day variable I'll set that to
00:50 - be one to create a switch we will type
00:52 - switch parentheses curly braces within
00:56 - the parenthesis of the switch we will
00:58 - place a variable or a value what are we
01:01 - examining let's examine our day
01:04 - variable we examine a value against
01:07 - matching cases to create a case type
01:10 - case then a value or a condition we will
01:14 - see if day equals one so day case one
01:19 - are these two values equal if they are
01:22 - then we can do something we can execute
01:24 - some code so add a colon then any code
01:28 - underneath this case will be ex executed
01:30 - if there's a match between our value or
01:32 - variable day and this value so let's
01:39 - console.log it is
01:42 - Monday then be sure to add a break I'll
01:45 - demonstrate why you need break later so
01:48 - day is
01:49 - one it is Monday let's add another case
01:53 - for case 2 in case day equals 2 so let's
01:57 - copy and paste what we have
02:00 - case two it is
02:03 - Tuesday let's change day to B2 it is
02:06 - Tuesday all right let's do this all the
02:09 - way up to case
02:28 - seven
02:33 - all right we have cases 1 through 7 if I
02:36 - change day to be S well then it is
02:40 - Sunday you can also add a default case
02:43 - in case there are no
02:45 - matches now what if we set day to be
02:48 - Pizza which doesn't make sense well
02:51 - there are no matching cases once we
02:54 - review all of the cases and there's no
02:56 - matches we exit the switch you also have
02:59 - the the capability to add a default case
03:02 - in case there are no
03:04 - matches what's the default behavior of
03:06 - the switch if there's no matching cases
03:09 - let's
03:13 - console.log I should probably use a
03:14 - template literal for this if we're
03:16 - inserting a
03:17 - variable our day
03:20 - variable is not a day so now we should
03:24 - execute this default case Pizza is not a
03:28 - day all right now the reason that we
03:30 - have these break statements is to break
03:33 - out of the switch once we have a
03:34 - matching case I'll demonstrate what
03:36 - happens if we remove
03:42 - these all right let's set day to be two
03:46 - as in Tuesday it is Tuesday it is
03:49 - Wednesday it is Thursday it is Friday it
03:50 - is Saturday it is Sunday two is not a
03:52 - day so the reason that we have these
03:54 - breakes is to break out of the switch if
03:57 - we don't have them once we have a
03:58 - matching case
04:00 - we will execute the code found within
04:02 - that space then Cascade down and execute
04:05 - any code that follows after including
04:07 - code within different cases so that's
04:10 - why you want these break statements
04:11 - after each case to break out of the
04:13 - switch let's go over a more complex
04:17 - example let's say we have a test score
04:20 - variable between 0 and 100 my score will
04:24 - be 92
04:26 - 92% I will also create a letter grade
04:29 - variable
04:31 - which we will declare but not aign I'm
04:34 - going to examine our test score so
04:37 - another way in which you can write a
04:38 - switch is something like
04:40 - this I'm going to examine the value of
04:44 - true against matching cases which
04:46 - contain a condition so case then I'll
04:50 - write a
04:51 - condition is test score greater than or
04:54 - equal to 90 as in
04:58 - 90% this condition will evaluate to be
05:01 - true or false if true is equal to true
05:05 - we will do some code if this is false we
05:08 - skip over it if our test score is
05:10 - greater than or equal to 90 let's assign
05:12 - our letter grade variable to equal an a
05:17 - then be sure to
05:19 - break then I'm going to test this with
05:23 - console.log we will display our letter
05:27 - grade we have an A let's do this for
05:30 - anything greater than 80 the user will
05:32 - receive a
05:33 - B test score greater than or equal to 80
05:37 - letter grade will equal
05:39 - B let's change our test score to be 85
05:42 - the user receives a
05:44 - b let's follow this pattern 70 will be a
05:52 - c yep
05:54 - C 60 will be a
05:58 - d
06:06 - 60 is D then for the default
06:10 - case I will set letter grade to be
06:14 - F letter grade equals
06:19 - F if I set my test score to be 33% so
06:23 - with the test score of 33 the letter
06:25 - grade is f all right everybody so that's
06:28 - a switch if if you find you're using a
06:30 - lot of L if statements I would recommend
06:32 - using a switch instead it's not bad if
06:34 - you have a few but if you have many I
06:37 - would use a switch instead and well
06:39 - everybody those are switches in
06:43 - JavaScript
