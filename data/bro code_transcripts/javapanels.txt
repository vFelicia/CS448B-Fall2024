00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well and in
00:03 - this video i'm going to teach you guys
00:04 - about
00:05 - panels in java so sit back relax and
00:07 - enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:12 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:16 - help keep this channel running
00:18 - all right people let's discuss jpanels
00:21 - it's a gui component that functions as
00:23 - a container to hold other components and
00:26 - you can add
00:26 - a jpanel to a frame and it will sort of
00:30 - section off areas of your frame so
00:33 - let's create a frame so i'm just going
00:35 - to paste this
00:36 - just to save a little bit of time so
00:38 - jframe frame
00:39 - equals new frame be sure to include any
00:42 - necessary imports frame dot set default
00:45 - close operation
00:46 - j frame exit on close we're going to be
00:48 - using
00:49 - no layout manager at least until we get
00:51 - to the video discussing
00:52 - layout managers so frame dot set layout
00:56 - no because we're manually going to place
00:58 - all of the components that we have
01:00 - frame dot set size 750 by 750
01:04 - and frame dot set visible true now to
01:07 - create a jpanel
01:08 - it's very similar to creating a jframe
01:11 - so we say
01:12 - j panel let's call this
01:15 - panel equals new j
01:19 - panel and let's change the background
01:22 - color
01:23 - and be sure to include any necessary
01:25 - imports
01:26 - so we'll say panel dot set
01:30 - background and let's pass in a color so
01:34 - color
01:35 - let's make this red actually uh since
01:37 - we're going to be creating a few
01:39 - different panels
01:40 - let's instead call this maybe red panel
01:44 - then we'll have a maybe blue panel and a
01:46 - green panel
01:48 - so be sure to change that here as well
01:51 - then we're going to set the bounce since
01:54 - we're using
01:55 - no layout manager we have to manually
01:57 - place
01:58 - the coordinates and the width and the
01:59 - height of this panel so red
02:02 - panel dot set bounce
02:06 - so we need x and y
02:09 - for where this panel is going to be
02:11 - placed as well as the width and the
02:12 - height
02:13 - so for the x position let's put this
02:16 - where x is zero
02:18 - where y is zero so this is going to be
02:19 - in the top left corner of the frame
02:21 - and for the width let's make this 250 by
02:24 - 250
02:25 - so it's a square and then lastly this is
02:28 - very easy to forget about we need to add
02:30 - this panel to the frame so let's do that
02:33 - at the end
02:33 - frame dot add what are we adding we're
02:36 - adding a component
02:37 - our jpanel is a component let's add that
02:40 - red panel
02:43 - and let's run this
02:46 - so this is our frame and this is our
02:49 - panel
02:50 - we can add components to the panel just
02:52 - like what we can do
02:53 - with our frame so let's create a few
02:56 - other panels to create different
02:57 - sections for this frame like this is one
03:00 - section we can create a different
03:02 - section to hold other components
03:04 - and then we can add components kind of
03:07 - like what we did with our frame
03:08 - so let's create maybe a blue panel this
03:11 - time so i'm going to copy this
03:13 - change red to blue and make sure to
03:16 - change it here as well
03:18 - so blue panel and blue panel
03:22 - and we'll change the color to blue
03:26 - and let's place this where x is 250 y is
03:30 - zero and we'll keep the dimensions the
03:32 - same
03:32 - and we need to add this panel to the
03:34 - frame so frame dot
03:36 - add blue panel
03:40 - so now we should have a blue panel next
03:42 - to our red panel
03:44 - which we do and let's create one more
03:46 - panel maybe
03:47 - a larger one that's green that will take
03:49 - up this section of our frame
03:52 - so let's call this green panel
03:55 - so let's change blue to green
03:59 - so green
04:02 - green green
04:06 - and here as well
04:09 - so we'll place this where x is zero
04:13 - y is 250 and let's make this
04:17 - 500 by 250 and then we need to add this
04:20 - to the frame so frame
04:22 - dot add green panel
04:27 - and then this should give us a nice
04:29 - square that's made up
04:30 - of separate jpanels cool
04:34 - yeah so those are jpanels let's add a
04:37 - component so let's make a label
04:40 - so let's do this at the top
04:43 - j label label equals new
04:47 - j label and i'll set some text
04:51 - as well so
04:55 - label dot set text
05:01 - hi and you can add an icon too if you
05:04 - want
05:04 - i'll do that just for this demonstration
05:07 - uh we'll need to create an
05:08 - image icon so image
05:11 - icon icon equals new
05:15 - image icon and
05:18 - this file that i have is thumbsup.png
05:22 - and it looks like this
05:25 - so this is thumbs up dot
05:29 - p n g
05:33 - and include this import
05:36 - uh but i misspelled image
05:40 - all right then label dot set icon
05:49 - all right now with this label we can add
05:52 - this to either the frame
05:53 - or we can add this to a panel so let's
05:55 - add this to one of the panels
05:57 - let's say the red panel so let's add
06:00 - that here
06:01 - so instead of saying frame dot add label
06:03 - we're going to say
06:05 - the panel that we want to add this to
06:07 - because these panels function like
06:09 - containers
06:10 - so let's add this to the red panel so
06:11 - red panel
06:13 - dot add label
06:18 - and this should appear in our red panel
06:21 - which it does
06:23 - let's instead add this to a different
06:24 - panel like the blue panel
06:28 - and now this label is contained within
06:31 - the blue panel
06:32 - and let's try it for the green panel
06:38 - and now this label appears in the green
06:41 - panel
06:42 - and you can also move this label around
06:45 - within the container too
06:47 - however these panels they use something
06:50 - called a
06:50 - flow layout manager and in the last
06:53 - video on
06:54 - labels the frames that we use have a
06:57 - border layout
06:58 - all you really need to know about flow
07:00 - layouts right now is that
07:02 - with components that you add to a
07:04 - container that's using a flow layout
07:06 - manager
07:07 - it will take all these components stick
07:09 - them to the top and center them
07:11 - and it will add components until this
07:13 - first
07:14 - row is filled once that row is filled
07:16 - it's going to add components to
07:19 - the second row but for now we don't
07:21 - really know how that works that's a
07:23 - video for a different day
07:24 - let's just set the layout for our panel
07:27 - to a border layout just because we're
07:29 - comfortable with that
07:30 - and then later i'll demonstrate using no
07:33 - layout manager and how we can place this
07:35 - label
07:35 - so let's set the layout for our green
07:38 - panel and we're kind of comfortable with
07:40 - border layouts now and moving labels
07:42 - within a frame that's using a border
07:45 - layout
07:46 - so green panel dot set
07:50 - layout and then we can pass in
07:53 - a new border layout so this is the same
07:57 - layout that our jframe uses and if we're
08:00 - using the
08:01 - border layout it's going to place any
08:03 - components to the
08:04 - center vertically and to the left
08:07 - horizontally
08:08 - and then we can use set vertical and set
08:11 - horizontal alignment for this label to
08:13 - move
08:14 - this label around within the container
08:16 - and then later we'll set
08:17 - no layout manager so we can place
08:19 - coordinates if you prefer to do it that
08:21 - way
08:22 - so let's set the vertical and horizontal
08:24 - alignment for this label
08:26 - so we'll do that at the top label dot
08:28 - set
08:30 - vertical alignment and this takes a
08:32 - constant
08:34 - j label and let's move this to the top
08:38 - so then our label will move as far as it
08:42 - can
08:42 - to the top vertically and it gets stuck
08:45 - at the top
08:46 - of this container because well it's a
08:48 - container it doesn't like to
08:50 - allow components outside of the
08:51 - container and if we were to set this to
08:56 - bottom take a wild guess
09:00 - it's going to move to the bottom of the
09:01 - container and then let's also set the
09:04 - horizontal alignment because we can so
09:06 - label dot set
09:07 - horizontal alignment and we can pick
09:10 - left center or right let's pick the
09:13 - right this time so j
09:15 - label dot right
09:19 - and our label will stick to the
09:22 - bottom and to the right of the container
09:25 - that it's in
09:26 - now what if we switch this label to a
09:28 - different panel like the red panel
09:30 - uh first we'll just want to change the
09:34 - layout that we're using so let's change
09:37 - the red panel layout
09:40 - to a new border layout and then we're
09:43 - going to add
09:44 - our label to the red panel this time
09:48 - so let's take a guess as to where this
09:50 - label is going to move to
09:52 - it's going to move to the bottom right
09:54 - corner of the red panel
09:56 - and if we switch this to blue and i'm
09:59 - just going to copy this
10:00 - because we'll want to set this to a
10:03 - border layout
10:04 - so blue panel and blue panel dot add
10:08 - label
10:12 - now this is within the bottom right of
10:14 - the blue panel
10:16 - so what if you don't want to use a
10:18 - layout manager
10:19 - well this is what we can do we're going
10:21 - to set
10:22 - null for the layout for each of these
10:24 - panels so
10:25 - let's change this to no
10:31 - for all three panels and let's take a
10:33 - look to see what changes were made
10:36 - all right so we need to set the bounds
10:38 - for this label now
10:40 - so let's do that here label dot
10:43 - set bounds we're going to place
10:47 - x coordinate a y coordinate a width and
10:50 - a height
10:50 - so let's say we want this in the top
10:52 - left corner that is where x is zero and
10:54 - y is zero
10:55 - let's say for the width this will be 75
10:58 - and for the height 75 as well
11:00 - now we added our label to the blue panel
11:04 - so it's going to be in the top left
11:06 - corner
11:07 - of the blue panel and not necessarily
11:10 - the top left corner of our frame
11:12 - because with set bounds it's going to
11:15 - place
11:16 - your component at these coordinates
11:18 - relative
11:19 - to the container that it's in since this
11:22 - label is within the blue panel
11:26 - the blue panel is acting as the
11:27 - container and not necessarily the frame
11:30 - so if we were to move this label to a
11:33 - different panel it's going to be within
11:34 - a new container
11:35 - so let's say we want to add this label
11:37 - to the green panel
11:39 - so now this label is going to be in the
11:42 - top left
11:43 - of our green panel and you can do the
11:45 - same thing with red too
11:46 - and then if we were to move the x
11:49 - position and y position of this label
11:51 - let's say
11:52 - 100 and 100
11:58 - and now this label is moved down
12:01 - on the y-axis by 100 pixels and on the
12:04 - x-axis to the right by 100 pixels
12:06 - relative to the corner of the container
12:09 - that it's within
12:10 - this green panel and not necessarily the
12:13 - frame itself
12:15 - so we don't really need this set
12:17 - vertical alignment and
12:18 - set horizontal alignment if you're using
12:21 - no layout manager
12:22 - this is something you'll want to use if
12:24 - you're using a border
12:26 - layout all right everybody so that's the
12:29 - basics
12:29 - of panels it's basically a gui component
12:32 - that functions as a container to hold
12:35 - other components
12:36 - so you can add components to a panel and
12:38 - then you can add the panel
12:40 - to a frame so that's the basics of
12:42 - panels if you would like a copy of all
12:44 - this code
12:45 - i'll post all of this in the comments
12:46 - down below but yeah that's the basics of
12:48 - panels in java
12:51 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
12:53 - learn something new
12:54 - then you can help me help you in three
12:58 - easy steps
