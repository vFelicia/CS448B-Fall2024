in this video we'll go over how to write a java program in a simple text editor like notepad and compile and execute it directly from the command line maybe you're just starting out in java and you want to know how you can run your programs from the command line or maybe you've been programming in java for a while but you've only run your programs in an ide like eclipse either way i've got you covered my name is john i'm a lead java software engineer and i love sharing what i've learned with you in a clear and understandable way i also have a full java course available in a link down in the description if you're interested let's get right to it okay first there's only one thing you have to have installed to get this to work properly and that is the jdk the java development kit if you've already got it installed awesome if not just follow a link down in the description to go and download it run the installer it should just take a couple of minutes and you'll be good to go let's get started by opening the command prompt window to do that just go to the start menu type in cmd and press enter i'm doing this in windows 11 so if you're doing this in windows 10 or any other version of windows it might look a little bit different but it should still work the same way first let's just make sure that the jdk is correctly installed so we know we'll be able to run our java programs properly to do that you can just type in java space dash version and hit enter if you see something like this print out that shows the current version of java that you have installed you're good to go if you see some kind of error like java is not recognized as a command that means you don't have the jdk installed so go and do that in the link down in the description first next we just want to go to whatever folder on your computer that you want to use to put your java program for me i'm just going to put it on the desktop here so i've just navigated to my desktop folder next let's create the file for our java program to do that just rightclick anywhere here in the folder and go to new and text document then just type in whatever you want to call your java program i'm going to call mine hey there earth everybody always calls there's hello world so let's just change it up a bit then hit enter to create it but this just creates a dot txt file not a dot java file and we need to create a java file to run our program properly so to change this to a java file you need to go up to the menu where it says view and then go to show and click file name extensions again i'm using windows 11 so this is what it looks like for windows 10 it's very similar just go to the view tab at the top and click the check box for file name extensions in the show hide section so now we can see it has the txt file extension to change that to java just right click and go to rename or you can also just hit the f2 key to rename and change the file extension from txt to dot java and hit enter you'll probably get a warning about changing the file name just go ahead and click yes next we want to open this file so we can write our program in it in notepad so just right click the file and go to open with and if you don't see notepad in this list like i don't have notepad just go to choose another app and then here you might have to click more apps to show more applications and then notepad should show there so just select notepad and click ok that'll open your hey there earth program right here in notepad this is where you'll put whatever code you want for your java program we'll keep this one very simple class hey there earth create our public static void main method strain args we'll just have it print out hey there earth close the method and close the class to save the file just go to file and save or just hit control s next let's go back to the command line and navigate to the directory where we made our java program so for me since i put it on the desktop i just need to type in cd desktop to change my directory to the desktop and if i want to make sure i'm in the right directory i can just type in dir and here i can see my heytherearth.java program ready to go so now what do we enter to run our java program well actually before we can run it we have to compile it into something that the computer can understand and run called bytecode to compile it we'll use the java c command java c for the java compiler makes sense right so just type in java c and then the name of the file that you want to compile so for me it's hey there earth.java make sure you put the java file extension in there or you'll probably get some kind of error so just enter that and then press enter if you don't see any output at all you don't see any errors or anything that means that it worked and to verify that you can go back out into your folder and see that it created a dot class file for your program so here it's heythereearth.com this is the bytecode file that i was talking about so now your program is in a form that you can execute directly if you have some kind of error in your program like let's say you didn't end your quote or something when you go to try and compile your program hey there earth.java you'll get a printout showing where it's running into the compilation error if you get something like that just go into your file and fix it save it and run the compiler again so like i said now our program is in bytecode form that we can run so what's the command to actually run it just use the java command not java c just java and then the name of your program so hey there earth for this command you don't need to type out the dot java file extension and then press enter so it printed out hey there earth and that's what our program was supposed to do so it ran successfully so doing it from the command line is a little bit more work than just clicking the run button in your ide but it's not really too hard it just takes a couple of commands and it's just something that every java programmer should know you should know how to run simple java programs from the command line like this if you enjoyed this video or learned something please let me know by
