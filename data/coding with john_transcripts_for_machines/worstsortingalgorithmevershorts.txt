we are going to implement one of the worst sorting algorithms in the world in java it's not fast it's pretty much just a twoline sorting algorithm while the list is not sorted we're going to call collections.shuffle and pass in our list we check to see if the list is sorted and if not we shuffle it and we keep going until it magically is sorted and then we'll print everything out for our list of just three elements it basically finishes right away so it's got to be super speedy right well maybe and instead of just having three elements i'm going to increase it to 14 and see what happens so i'm back here the next morning to find so we started last night at 9 25 and finally finished this morning at 2 17 that means it took about five hours to sort 14 numbers
