in this video we are going to implement one of the worst sorting algorithms in the world in java and then we're going to see how long it takes to sort a list of just 14 integers here's a hint it's not fast if this is your first time watching this channel my name is john and i do a java video like this every single week lessons on concepts full tutorials on how to code something or just a fun video like this one so be sure to hit the subscribe button so you don't miss one and i want to sincerely thank those of you who do take the time to like and subscribe it's the only way this channel grows i really do appreciate it the name of the sorting algorithm we are going to use is uh most commonly called bogo sword but it's also called uh random sort shuffle sort monkey sort shotgun sort so the idea behind it is that you start out with some unsorted list of stuff and you just shuffle everything so you just mix up the elements of that list into some random order and then you check to see if all the elements of that list are now in order and if they aren't you randomly shuffle them again and you keep going until one of those random shuffles somehow puts the list in perfect order we're just taking our list and throwing it over to a pack of 100 monkeys and hoping that they throw it back in perfectly sorted order all this program is doing is uh we create a new empty arraylist of integers and we're filling it up with values so we just have a regular old for loop here that just goes from 0 to currently the number is 12 but we'll actually start out with a little lower of a number we'll start out with the list of only three numbers and in each iteration through this for loop we had a random number in that range to our number list so right now when it exits this for loop it's going to have three random numbers between 0 and 9999 and then we're going to implement our magical sorting algorithm here that should put them all in perfect order and then we just loop through our list with this four each and print out each element and we should see them all being printed out in perfect order now we've also got this uh private method that i've prebuilt for purposes of this video so it just takes in a list of integers and it returns true if the list is sorted in order from smallest to largest and it returns false if it is not right now before we add our sorting algorithm we can go ahead and run our code and we can see that the elements that we get each time we run it are in no particular order and it's going to be our job to implement the sorting algorithm to get these perfectly sorted each and every time so now let's get to the good part where we are actually implementing our super amazingly awful sorting algorithm and bogosort may be terrible and slow but one thing it is not is complicated it's pretty much just a two line sorting algorithm here's what we're going to do we're going to have a while loop and we're going to say while the list is not sorted and we'll pass in our number list so it's just checking to see if our list is currently in perfect order uh just using our little private method down here and if it's not in order we're going to call collections dot shuffle and pass in our list so that's it's basically just two lines we check to see if the list is sorted and if not we shuffle it and then we check to see if it's sorted and if not we shuffle it and we keep going until it magically is sorted and then we'll exit this while loop and print everything out so let's run it for our list of just three elements and see if it works right yes indeed that is in order let's run it a few more times just to make sure we didn't uh get lucky and make sure our algorithm is working perfectly yep yep it's been in the proper order each and every time it doesn't seem to be taken long at all right it basically finishes right away so it's got to be super speedy right well maybe let's go ahead and instead of just having three elements let's have 10 elements in our list and run that a few times and see what happens pretty quick our elements are still coming out in perfect order and it seems to be working pretty quickly well that one took a second but you know it's not bad a second or two it could be a lot worse for what we're calling the worst sorting algorithm in the world now let's bump it up a little bit let's just say um 12 elements hmm this one's taking a while yep i don't have a watch i was just this is the universal signal for this is taking a while yeah you guys seen any um good movies or tv shows or anything lately no movies not in a theater nobody's seen anything in the theater for a year barely been out of the house oh well we finished up we're in perfect numerical order let's see they ran from 9 12 54 to 9 14 12. so that means it took a minute and a half or so that's not great i could have probably sorted 12 pieces of paper with numbers on them in the right order faster than that so it took a while but it wasn't the absolute worst experience of my life um let's try lucky 13. run it okay and this could take quite a while i have no idea how long it's actually going to take even from just going from 12 to 13 elements in our list we could have increased the time it's going to take from a minute and a half with those 12 elements to now with 13 i don't know it could take 10 minutes hours days years i don't know but i'm going to let it run and we're going to see and we are not going to try 14. so i'll see you back here when it finishes all right that one ended up finishing a little bit faster than i thought only about seven and a half minutes or so not the end of the world still a little ridiculous for a list of just 13 units but i think i'm going to go ahead and increase it to 14 and see what happens i've got all my computer do your worst actually i don't have all night i think i'm gonna go do something else and let it run and i'm back here the next morning to find it has finally finished so we started last night at 9 25 and finally finished this morning at 2 17 a.m so that means it took about five hours to sort this list of 14 numbers with our ridiculous bogo sword now that is crazy and the thing is that doesn't mean this will reliably take about five hours to do it just happened to come along with the exact right permutation at that time the next time it runs it could take 10 minutes to do the exact same thing or it could take six days to do the exact same thing now the reason it gets exponentially worse is because the number of possible permutations the number of possible different orderings increases exponentially also the number of permutations for a list of a given size is actually the the size of the list factorial so that means our list of 14 elements had 14 factorial possible number of permutations that gives us about 87 billion possible ordering the thing is our program isn't just going through different orderings and then if one order doesn't work it says okay i won't try that again it doesn't do that that means it has a 1 in 87 billion chance of getting it right every time it tries it and so eventually it's going to get it right now what would happen if we just increased our list by one well it would be 15 times harder so we've got 1.3 trillion possibilities and only 1 in 1.3 trillion chance of getting it right on any given shuffle and so we would expect to take it on average about 15 times as long as it just took us to do 14 elements i would try it just for the fun of it but i don't really want to leave my computer sitting there useless for weeks at a time trying to sort a list of numbers in an awful way just for fun i've already done that for five hours and i think that's enough we've learned our lesson here although the bogo sort is very very simple and easy to implement it is also horrifically inefficient for anything more than just a few elements but i will say it was a lot of fun to try out and to see how quickly it actually gets super awful if you enjoyed this video or learned something please let me know with a like and be sure to hit the subscribe button to get more java videos tutorials and lessons like this every single week and again thank you sincerely to all of you who do take the time to like and subscribe it's the only way this channel can grow and reach more people and so i really do appreciate it poor computer just had to work all night just to sort 14 numbers poor guy i won't do that to you anymore well that's not true i might i might do something similar to that in the future
