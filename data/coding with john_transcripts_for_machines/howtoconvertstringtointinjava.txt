hey do you need to convert a string to an int in java you're in the right place so let's get to it so you're programming in java and you've got a string that contains a number but you need to be able to convert it to an int so you can do math with it how do you do it we're going to look at a super fast super easy way to convert your string to an int so let's say you've got something like string string int equals five in quotes so maybe you got that from user input or you parsed it from some other string or something like that maybe you're trying to use that string into like do some math and print something out at the same time kind of like system.out.printline um let's see string int plus six so um you might expect that to print out 11 right 5 plus 6 is 11. but if you go ahead and do it you see you get 56. what's happening here 6 isn't getting added to the 5 it's getting converted to a string automatically and appended to the end of the string in so it's just getting five and plus six add to the end of it of course that's just not what you were going for or just maybe you're trying to do some math with that string and store the result in some other end so for example you're trying to do something like int total equals uh string int plus six and you can see ah tightness match can't convert from string to end unfortunately it can't do this for you automatically so what you're going to want to do is use a method on the integer class called parse ins and pass in the string that contains the int in it so you use integer.parseint so now we can see what if we take this same statement and instead use integer.parseint here pass in our string int let's go ahead and run that and boom we get 11 exactly we were going for and that's because we converted this string to an int before doing our math with it and then it printed out the resulting value so to summarize it's super easy if you have a string that contains an int all you need to do to turn it into an end is use integer.parsons so you can even directly convert that value into an in store in a variable so like int my int equals integer dot parse and string it so you're passing in your string to this integer.parseint method storing the result in my end and then you can take this mind and do whatever kind of math you want with it add subtract multiply divide mod whatever anything you want now something you do want to watch out for what if what you have in the string end isn't a proper number say you have something like five uh garbage and if you run that and try to parse an int from that string you get a number format exception and that's because java can't take this string and convert it to a number for you it's just not going to work there's nothing i can do about that so maybe you're getting this value from user input or something and the user enters something that isn't a number so if you need detailed examples about how to catch these sorts of exceptions when the user enters something that they aren't meant to go ahead and check out this video here of me creating a full gpa calculator so that's it it's that simple to convert a string to an end in java just integer.parseint so if you learned something or got some value from this video please give it a like it is super helpful and so appreciated and go ahead and subscribe too if you'd like to see more videos like this in the future so that's it short and sweet see you next time
