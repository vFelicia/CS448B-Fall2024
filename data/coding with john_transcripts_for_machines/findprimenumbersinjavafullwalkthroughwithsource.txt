do you need to write a program in java to find prime numbers if so this is the video you're looking for we're going to write a java program to find prime numbers from scratch first a program to find all prime numbers between 1 and 100 and then we'll expand it to find all prime numbers between 1 and n a number that the user inputs and then once we get to be able to find the first n prime numbers so whatever way you need to find prime numbers in java we're going to cover it here if this is your first time watching this channel my name is john and i do a java tutorial video every week either a lesson on a java concept or a full walkthrough of a program from scratch like this one so be sure to like and hit the subscribe button so you don't miss the new video every week and a sincere thanks for taking the time to like and subscribe it's the only way the channel grows and these videos reach more people so i really do appreciate it before we get started as always the full source is available in the link down below in the description so go and get it alright let's get right into it finding prime numbers in java well first thing what is a prime number so definition of a prime number is a whole number greater than one that only has two factors one and that number so it's only divisible by one and itself it's not divisible by any other number so first we're going to write the code that finds all prime numbers between 1 and 100 and then we'll easily expand it to be able to find all the prime numbers between 1 and a number that the user inputs and then it'll be just another small tweak to find the first n prime numbers first we're just going to need a list somewhere we can store all the prime numbers that we actually do find that we can print out at the end of the program so we'll just make a list of integers called prime numbers then we'll initialize that to a new array list since we're using eclipse we can press ctrl shift o to organize imports so we'll import java util list and java.util.arraylist okay so if we're going to find all prime numbers between uh one and a hundred um probably what we should start out with is a for loop that goes through all those numbers uh one to a hundred so we'll say for int a number to check that's a good name for it we could call it i or something like that but it's just a little bit easier to read in the code later when we see number to check as the variable name it means the number that we're checking instead of i which doesn't have a whole lot of meaning at all it just makes our program easier to read and understand so we'll start this at 2 because we know that we don't need to check zero or one uh those don't meet the definition of a prime number remember a prime number is a whole number greater than one so we'll just start at two and since we're only checking up to 100 here we're just going to go while number to check is less than or equal to 100 and then of course we will increment number to check each time by one so this will loop the number to check variable from 2 to 100 so what do we need to do for every number that we want to check here so what we're actually going to do is loop from 2 up to the number that we're checking and see if any of those numbers divide evenly into our number now to do that we're going to actually use a nested for loop which is a for loop inside a for loop and it's probably easiest to just write that for loop out and then we'll talk about the pieces and what it does so in here we'll have a 4 inch factor equals 2 and we'll go while that factor is less than or equal to the number to check divided by two and of course increment the factor uh each time so basically what we're going to do is for each number that we want to check whether it's prime or not we're going to loop through all the numbers from two up to halfway to the number that we want to check and see if any of those divide evenly into the number that we're checking and if we do find a number that's divisible into the number that we're checking we know it's not a prime number and we can skip it and look at the next one so what programming tool do we use to find out if a number is perfectly divisible by another number will you use the mod symbol which is just a percent so what we can do is say if our number to check mod the factor equals zero then we know that this is not a prime number so what this mod actually does is it takes this number to check and divides it by our factor and the mod is the remainder so how this works is pretend we were checking the number seven for our number to check and three as our factor so what this operation actually does is finds the remainder of seven divided by three so seven divided by 3 is 2 with a remainder of 1. so in that case 7 mod 3 would equal 1. but if our number to check was 6 instead well 6 mod 3 equals 0 because 6 divided by 3 is 2 with no remainder it has a remainder of 0 and that's how we know that 6 is perfectly divisible by 3 and 6 is not a prime number so what do we want to do if we find that the number that we're checking is perfectly divisible by this factor that we're checking well we want to tell the program that the number that we're checking is not a prime number and skip to checking the next one so to do that we're actually going to need a boolean here before our nested for loop and we'll call it is prime and we'll initialize it to true so we'll basically be starting out assuming each number is prime until we find a number that it's perfectly divisible by that proves that it's not prime so in that case we want to set is prime to false and we want to break out of our inner for loop so this break will break out of our inner for loop but it won't break out of our outer for loop we don't necessarily need the break statement but it's kind of silly to keep it once we find out that a number is not prime there's no sense checking out all the other factors of it we don't need to check them we already know the number is not prime and note that we're only checking factors up to the number to check divided by two well once we get up past halfway to the number that we're checking we know that none of those remaining numbers are going to divide evenly into the number we're checking so this just makes the performance a little better so then after all that if it got all the way through all the iterations of this inner for loop and is prime is still true then we now know that this number to check that we were checking is in fact a prime number it was not divisible by any of the factors that we checked so it's prime so we have to do here is check if is prime is still true and so we can just say if is prime then we want to add it to our prime numbers list and that's simple to do we just say prime numbers dot add our number that we were checking which we called number two check so then at the very end of our program outside of our outer for loop here once that has completed that means we have checked all the numbers up to 100 all the numbers that we wanted to check whether they were prime and everyone that was prime we added to our prime numbers list all we have to do is print out our list so we just say system dot out dot print line uh prime numbers from 1 to 100 are and then we can loop through our prime numbers list with a simple for each loop and print out each one so to do that it's just for int number in our prime numbers list so this will loop through each entry in our prime numbers list and assign it to this variable number for each iteration and so we can do it that what we please here we just want to print it out so we just say system.out.printline number so that should work let's just run it and see how it goes all right so we got prime numbers from 1 to 100 r we've got 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 all the way up to 97 is the highest prime number below 100. so it looks like this is working like a charm no no wait charms don't work this is working like a like a clock like a finely tuned rolex with fresh batteries all right so we've written the program to find all prime numbers between one and a hundred now what if you want to find all prime numbers between one and n some number that the user inputs well to do that is really simple we just need to replace this 100 with the user input so to get user input we use the scanner class and we'll say scanner scanner equals new scanner and we pass in system dot in for this to be a keyboard input from the user and again we'll organize imports but if you aren't using a fancy ide like eclipse you will need to import java.util.scanner and then we'll need to get a number as input from the user and we'll want to store that input from the user in a variable in an int so we'll just call it limit it'll be the limit of numbers that we check to see if they're prime and we'll set it equal to scanner.nextint that's the method that gets an int as keyboard input from the user and check out my other video here if you're interested in a full tutorial on the scanner class how to get all different types of data from the user so this will set this limit variable to be the int that was input by the user via the keyboard so we have to do is change the limit here from 100 to the limit that was set by the user and of course we just want to change this output here at the end of our program too so instead of saying 100 we say from 1 to whatever the limit is and also we just want to print a little message to the user to prompt them to input a number system.out.printline please input the limit all right let's go ahead and run this and see how it goes okay so please input the limit let's say we want to go from one to a thousand all right awesome again that worked like a clock oh let's run it again ctrl f11 to run an eclipse let's see if we can go up to a hundred thousand this one's taking a bit of time oh but just a couple of seconds so this program is working great so now we found all the primes from 1 to 100 we found all the primes from 1 to n any number that the user can input now let's say we want to find the first n prime numbers so for example if the user types in the number 50 we print the first 50 prime numbers so here we're going to use our limit in a little bit different way so now instead of looping up to a limit of numbers to check we want to keep going just until we found that many prime numbers right so we're actually going to do is make our int number to check variable above our loop but now instead of a for loop since we don't want to go up to some limit we actually just want to do a while true loop and this is going to keep us looping forever until we reach a break statement that we're going to write in the code once we find the number of primes that we're looking for and we're also going to want to make an int count a variable for counting the number of primes so once we hit the right number we can exit our loop okay so now our number to check starts at 2 and our account starts at 0. so this still checks our number to check to see if it's prime and at this point if it is prime we add it to our list but we also want to increment our count so every time we find a prime number we can increment our count and we know exactly how many prime numbers we have and at the end of each iteration of this while true loop we also want to increment our number to check because we don't have the statement in our for loop doing it anymore this increments our number to check each time we go through this while loop so the first time we go through this loop we'll be checking two to see if it's prime then three then four etcetera etcetera so now all we need is to be able to exit the loop once we found the number of primes that we're looking for so we can do that here after we increment the count we can say if the count is greater than or equal to our limit the number of primes that we're looking for then we can break you can probably also do just equals here when the count equals the limit i just like the safety of greater than or equal to limit so once we find the number of primes we're looking for this break statement will kick the program out of this while true loop down to here and then we just want to change our little print statement here to show what exactly we're printing out so that's just the first limit prime numbers are get rid of this so it's just the first n prime numbers are whatever so let's give this a run and see if it works let's just give it something easy um like the first two prime numbers and yeah the first two prime numbers are two and three and now let's run it again and give it a little bit more of a challenge let's say we want to do the first thousand prime numbers bam there goes finished in no time when you write this you can go ahead and put in a very large number and see how long it takes to find that many prime numbers and after you get to a certain point it's going to take a very long time to find that many prime numbers and also what you can do when your program starts taking that long instead of adding each prime number to a list and printing them all out when you're done you can just go here where you're adding your number to the list instead of adding it to a list you can just print it out right there and then as your program runs you'll see it print out each prime number that it finds and let's just put that in here too right now just for fun uh why not system.out dot print line number two check we know that this number is prime we can just print it out and then for now we'll just comment out the end of the program where we're printing them all out we don't need to print them all out twice so let's run it so we want to find the first 10 000 prime numbers let's see how this works that finished super fast it's already done so let's try a million and see what happens okay it's going so if we had kept it to just print out the list at the very end uh the program would have printed out nothing by now we'd just see a blank screen but now that we're printing it out as it finds the prime numbers we can see it kind of working this is going to take a kind of a long time to find a million prime numbers if you think this is abusing a computer check out this other video i did on the worst sorting algorithm in the world called bogosort where i left my computer running for hours and hours trying to sort a really small list of integers in the worst way imaginable if you learned something or enjoyed this video please let me know with a like and if
