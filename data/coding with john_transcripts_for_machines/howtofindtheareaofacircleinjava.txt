hey how's it going john here today we're going to do a quick tutorial of how to find the area of a circle in java before we get started here i want you to know the full source of this program is available in a link down below so go get it we're going to make it quick and easy so let's get started so so of course the formula for the area of a circle is just pi r squared pi times the radius squared so what we're going to do in this program is accept a radius as input from the user and then print out the area of the circle from that but first we're going to need to get the radius from the user so to do that we're going to use the scanner class we'll create a new scanner called scanner equals new scanner and then we're going to use system dot in which is used for keyboard input we'll go ahead and import what we need to for scanner it's java util scanner if you aren't using a fancy ide like this that auto imports it now to get the radius as input from the user we're going to call a method on the scanner called next double because we're going to get that radius as a double so the user can type in decimal numbers and stuff and don't just have to use whole numbers integers things like that they can type in 3.52 for the radius if they want we should be able to accept that now this next double method is what is going to allow the user to enter a double but we also want to actually save what they enter to a variable a radius variable so we're going to create a new double variable called radius that will be set to whatever the user types in here when we prompt them so we also probably want here just a quick message to the user to prompt them to actually input the radius so let's say system dot out dot print line please enter the radius and so the user will see please enter the radius and then they'll be prompted to do so on the next line so then after this line executes we'll have the radius from the user in this radius variable all we have to do is do the calculation and print it out so let's go ahead and start the print statement system.out.printline area of the circle is and then now is when we're going to do our calculation so as we know we need to do pi times r squared so first to get the value of pi and java is easy we're just going to use the math class that comes with java and we're going to use math.pi which gives us the value of pi as a double so that's great now we have to multiply pi times the radius squared and what's the easiest way to get the radius squared here well it's probably to just do radius times radius that's the radius squared that works great so really that should be about it let's go ahead and run it and see what happens okay so we get the prompt please enter the radius let's say we've got uh 5.5 like we said so the area of the circle is 95.03 blah blah blah blah so great now a good way quickly to just verify that it's giving you a right one is compare it against something else like say google's calculator so let's just enter the 5.5 value there and they give you about 95.03 for the area and that's exactly what we're getting awesome now a couple of cool things before we stop the video one is if you want to instead of doing this radius times radius here you want to be really cool you can use the math.pow method which takes one number and raises it to the power of another number so we can just call that and we can take the radius and raise it to the power of two and that'll give you radius squared without having to type out radius times radius it does the same thing but it looks way cooler and really what's more important in programming than being cool i mean who doesn't get into programming for all the chicks and everything trust me if you use math.pow you'll just be biting off the ladies so yeah let's just run that make sure we get the same output we'll put in 5.5 and we get great 95.03 still works now one more thing you might have noticed if you were running this yourself that if you run it and you give it a radius that is like not a number you give it some garbage you get an exception input mismatch and it's because it's trying to take what you're putting in for the input and put it into a double and it's not able to do that so it blows up you're not going to get any ladies if your program blows up on bad input so if you'd like to learn more about doing input validation when using the scanner class check out this other video i made which is a full tutorial about using the scanner class that includes input validation so if you're learning java and found this video helpful please be sure to tell me with a like and if you want to see more java tutorials like this in the future please be sure to not subscribe we already got way too many subscribers as it is i think we're at like 14 or something now double digits it's getting just out of control we want to keep this channel nice and exclusive to something like seven or eight people is probably the sweet spot for subscriber numbers and if you didn't like this video please be sure to leave an angry nasty comment down below i just love reading those and i just realized i spelled circle like a complete doofus i'm leaving it in if i look around online and i find source code like this and i see circles spelled like circle i'll know you stole it from me now we have to remember here as in all our videos we have to be good boy scouts and always close our scanner every time we're done using it and this is no exception make you feel good about yourself you close your scanner you know it's like you adopted a whole family of kittens you know maybe it's more like you adopted a whole family of elderly cats because uh people always overlook those everybody wants a kitten because kittens are so nice they're so fun yeah always be a good boy scout closure scanners alright see you guys next time
