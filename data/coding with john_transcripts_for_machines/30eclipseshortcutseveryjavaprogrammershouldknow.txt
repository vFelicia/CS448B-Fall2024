in this video we're going to go over all the very best eclipse shortcuts that you can use to be a faster java programmer there are some of these that once you see them in action you'll never code the same way again my name is john i'm a lead java software engineer and i love sharing what i've learned in a clear understandable way so if you'd like more programming tutorials like this be sure to subscribe so you don't miss each new video i also have a full java course available in the link down in the description if you're interested first is a simple one that's really cool let's say you have some text in your program that you want to make all uppercase but you know you don't have to go in and retype the entire thing in uppercase all you have to do is highlight the text and hit ctrl shift x and poof all that text is now uppercase and if you want to make it all lowercase just hit ctrl shift y next let's say you want to print something out and you know that in java you have to write system.out.printline open and close parentheses and then type out what you want to print out well you actually don't have to do all that instead you can just write sis out and then hit control space and it'll automatically print out that whole thing system.out.printline and it'll put your cursor in between the two parentheses so you can immediately just start typing out whatever you want next let's say you're creating a new java program right and you've created your class probably the first thing you want to do is create your main method right as you probably know it's public static void main string array args and open and close curly braces but it can be tough to remember all that and even if you do who wants to write all of that out well all you have to do is just write out the word main and then hit control space this first option that pops up main method is the one you want so just go ahead and hit enter and that will automatically create the full shell of your main method for you pretty awesome by the way if you want to know what all this stuff and the main method actually means check out this video all about the main method and what each piece actually does and why it's there similar shortcuts are available for creating all kinds of things for example for loops all you have to do is just type four and then hit control space there's a few different types of for loops available and it'll create them in kind of a smart way depending on what's in your code surrounding it for example let's just say you had created like a list of strings here names equals new array list then when you type four and hit control space the options here will use that surrounding code for example if you hit four each to create a for each loop it sees this list right above it called names and will automatically create a for each loop looping through each element in that names list you can customize whatever you like in here like if you want to name this variable like name instead and then hit enter and then type whatever code you want inside your for each loop you can also create while and do while loops this way as you might guess for a while loop just type out while and hit control space and you'll have a few options here probably the one you'll want most often is a simple while loop with a condition it automatically creates this while loop with a placeholder condition which you can replace with whatever you like if you want to create a do while loop instead just type in do and hit control space the do while statement will be the very first suggestion so just hit enter to use it just type in here whatever you want the condition of your do while loop to be and you're good to go you can also make all kinds of if statements this way just type if and hit control space if you just want a simple if statement you can use that but you can also pick an if else statement and if you want an elsif in between these conditions you can just type in elseif and it'll give you a full else if block this next one is one i just learned recently but is so simple and useful i can't believe i haven't known it for years let's say you've got a line of code and you want to move it somewhere just up or down a few lines in your program of course you know that you can just highlight it hit ctrl x to cut and then go and paste it in wherever you want in your program right but there's an even better way all you have to do is go to the line that you want to move and hit alt and then the up or down arrows that lets you freely move that line of code wherever you want in your program and that's not just limited to one line you can do that with multiple lines as well so just highlight all the lines that you want to move around and hit alt and up or down next let's say you've got a piece of code that could throw some exception you know you'd have to create a try catch around it right so you'd have to say try then you have your open curly braces you have to go down here okay and then say catch exception e instead of doing all that you can just highlight the code that you want to surround with a try catch and then hit alt shift z that'll bring up a bunch of different options of things you can surround this code with one of which is a try catch block so you can just click that and it'll surround that code that you've highlighted with a full try catch block and you can surround it with other stuff too like a while loop a do while loop or even a simple if statement this one i remember learning back in college when we were first getting started using eclipse let's say you got a really basic class right like this cat class it has three fields name weight and age but they're all private which is fine right they probably should be private but now you have to go in and create getters and setters for them and it's not difficult but you know it's just kind of a slog right it's busy work okay public string get name turn this dot name and you have to create a setter for the name two and getters and setters for the other fields instead of doing all of that you can just right click anywhere in your class and then go to source and then generate getters and setters then a box will pop up showing you all the different fields that you can create your getters and setters for if you only want to create getters and setters for some fields and not others you can go in and check some of these and not others or just check the setters and not the getters but most of the time i just want to select all and create getters and setters for everything all you have to do is click generate and eclipse will automatically create getters and setters for all of your private fields i remember when my college professor showed us this after having us manually type out getters and setters for weeks i about slapped him in the face for not showing this to us sooner if you want to be really cool and you don't even want to right click and go through that whole menu you can hit alt shift s and then r that'll bring up this exact same menu the same goes for having to create constructors when you create a class like this you might want to create a constructor that takes all three of these fields so you can set them when your cat object is created but if you want to do that automatically instead of typing it out you can right click and go to source and generate constructor using fields same way as before you can check whatever fields you want to have as part of your constructor and then click generate it automatically creates a full constructor with parameters to be able to set each field and if you want to use a keyboard shortcut instead it'll be alt shift s and then o next what if you're working with like a not so great programmer on a group project or something and all of their code is just formatted terribly and looks like just you can have eclipse automatically format for you just highlight whatever code you want to format in this case it'll be everything because this is all awful then hit ctrl shift f much better nice and pretty and clean next let's say you type out some code that uses a new class that your program isn't using yet like this random class here of course eclipse complains to us that it can't find this random class and that's because we haven't imported it yet one cool thing you can do of course is just hover over that error and then click import random and eclipse will automatically add that to your imports but you don't even have to do that all you have to do is hit ctrl shift o and it'll automatically optimize your imports if there's more than one class with the same name it won't be able to automatically decide which one to import for example if we got rid of this scanner import and hit ctrl shift o there's multiple different scanner classes in java that it could use in this case the one that we want is java.util.scanner so all we have to do is just double click that one if you happen to get rid of some code and no longer need an import that you needed before when you organize your imports with ctrl shift o it'll also automatically remove any imports that you aren't using anymore you can automatically comment out a line or multiple lines by just hitting control and slash and you can uncomment those same lines by just hitting ctrl slash again if you want to instead make a multiline block comment just hit ctrl shift slash that will make it a multiline comment like this if you want to rename a variable you don't have to go in and change that variable every place that that variable appears instead you can just select the variable that you want to change and hit alt shift r then you can just change the name here to whatever you want and you can see that it automatically changes that variable name everywhere across the program then just hit enter and you're good to go what if you have a huge java file that's hundreds or maybe even thousands of lines and you want to go to a particular line well you could scroll down until you get there but if you want you can also just hit ctrl l then enter whatever line you want to go to like 157 and hit enter and it'll bring you directly to that line sometimes you may want to find a particular method in your program but you don't remember exactly where it is you can just hit ctrl o to pull up the outline of your java program that'll show all the different methods that are in the java file you're looking at if you want you can start typing to filter that list too if you have a big chunk of code that's kind of getting too complicated or maybe you also want to use it somewhere else in your program you might want to extract it to a method eclipse offers an automated way of doing that too you can just highlight all of the code that you want to include in your new method and then hit alt shift m that'll pop up a dialog box for creating your new method and you can just type in whatever you want it to be named like this piece of code determines the winner of this game so we probably want to call it uh determine winner it automatically figures out which parameters it's going to need and what the return type should be if any then you can just click ok and eclipse will automatically create your brand new method another really quick one that i use all the time is just using control d to delete an entire row dead simple but i probably use it every hour of every day another really useful one is if you're looking at a method and you want to know what caused this method and then what other methods call those methods and all the way up the tree with your cursor anywhere inside the method just hit ctrl alt h that'll bring up the call hierarchy which shows the current method that we're looking at is valid move and it also shows which other methods call this one and you can expand each of those to see which methods call those methods let's say you're looking at a class like dog and you want to see the whole inheritance hierarchy above it all you have to do is hit f4 and that brings up the entire class hierarchy so we can see that the dog class is a child of the animal class which is a child of the object class if you currently have selected any sort of opening or closing curly braces or brackets or parentheses you can hit ctrl shift p to automatically go to the other end so if you're at the beginning it'll go to the end if you're at the end it'll go to the beginning that's really useful for when you're looking at like a huge method and you just want to go straight to the ending curly braces or when the code is formatted really weirdly and you want to know where a certain section of code ends if you want to make your font size larger like if you need ridiculously large font size for recording a youtube video just hit control plus to increase the font size and control minus to decrease the font size anywhere that you're calling a method and you want to go directly to where that method is implemented just select the method name and hit f3 to jump right to it you can also just hold ctrl and click the method name to jump right to it as well you can do similar things with variables let's say i've got this board variable here right and i want to find where it's being declared i can just select anywhere that that variable is being used and hit f3 to jump right to where it's being declared and just like the methods you can control click as well to do exactly the same thing what if you have hundreds of java files like i do here and you just want to find one single file and you know the name but you don't know where to find it well you can just hit ctrl shift r then just start typing the name of whatever file you want to find here we go i found my awesome java program just click it to open it you can quickly switch between file tabs you can just hold ctrl then hit page up to go backwards in tabs and page down to go forwards another one i use all the time let's say you're just writing some code in one of your java classes and then you hop over to another java class and start making some changes there too it's very likely that you're going to want to hop right back to what you were just doing in that last java class well if you have a whole bunch of files open it could be kind of cumbersome trying to find where you just were instead of having to hunt it down you can just hit alt and the left arrow to just jump to the last place that you were editing and you can keep hitting alt left to keep going further and further back in history and to go back forward in history just hit alt and the right arrow key another awesome thing is that if your mouse has back and forward buttons like this one you can just use those instead you can hit back to go back in history and forward to go forward without even having to use your other hand i use that all the time and it's awesome to run your programs you might be clicking this run button which works just fine but the keyboard shortcut to run your program is just control f11 if you have unsaved changes it's going to prompt you to save them but you can also have it automatically save before it launches by just checking this box and hitting ok from then on even if you've made changes to your files when you hit ctrl f11 it'll automatically save them and run your program without prompting you i almost always use the control f11 shortcut to run my programs we've gone over a ton of eclipse shortcuts here right but you might be thinking man these are really useful but how am i going to remember all these there's so many if you ever want to remind yourself what you can do or see even more shortcuts that we didn't go over just hit ctrl shift l and it'll show you every single eclipse shortcut i highly encourage you to look through all of these and see if there's any other shortcuts we didn't talk about that could be useful to you and if you know about any useful eclipse shortcuts that we didn't talk about in this video or that you happen to find in this list please share them down in the comments if you enjoyed this video or learned something let me know by leaving a
