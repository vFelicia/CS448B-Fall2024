in this video we are going to enhance the rock paper scissors game that we made and implement a full rock paper scissors lizard spock game in java this one is for all the programmers out there who are somehow even bigger nerds than me if you haven't already seen the rock paper scissors video go ahead and click here to view it it won't take long to get through that and it'll just be a few easy enhancements to create rock paper scissors lizard spock if you're new to the channel my name is john and i make a java tutorial video every single week either a video on java topic or a full programming tutorial walking through how to create something from scratch be sure to leave a like and hit the subscribe button so you don't miss the new video every week thank you for taking the time to like and subscribe it's the only way these videos get out to help more people and so i really do appreciate it and as always the full java source code for this rock paper scissors lizard spot game is available in the link down in the description so go and grab it the original rock paper scissors source code is also available in a link down in the description so you can grab that if you want to build off of it to make rock paper scissors lizard spock yourself first like i said if you haven't seen the original rock paper scissors video go ahead and watch it here we're going to start with that code because it gives us all the structure that we need the flow of the game the randomness the computer move the player move all the main flow and aspects of the game are going to stay the same we're just going to take that rock paper scissors game and add some enhancements to make it a rock paper scissors lizard spock game so this is our original rock paper scissors game and let's just do a quick run through of how it works well the whole game is structured in a wild true loop so you can just keep playing repeatedly if you want to and we start with this array of strings r p and s for rock paper scissors and to do the computer move we just pick a random element from that array and then to get the player move we just print out please enter your move and then use the scanner class to get the string input from the user we expect the user to enter either r p or s for rock paper or scissors and if they don't send in one of those we say hey that's not a valid move and go to the top of this while true loop here again so they can reenter and then after that we have the computer move and the player move and all that's left is to do the logic of who wins and print out the result so we print out the computer played whatever they played and then the logic for printing out the result begins first if the player move and the computer move are equal if they're the exact same then we say the game was a tie otherwise we have a section for if the player move was rock so if the player move is rock and the computer move is paper then we say that you lose because paper covers rock otherwise if the computer picks scissors you win because rock crushes scissors and then we have a section for if the player move is paper of course paper covers rock scissors cuts paper and then lastly we have the section for if the player move was scissors scissors cuts paper and rock crushes scissors and then we just ask the user if they want to play again and if they enter the letter y it restarts the loop again and allows the player to play all over again and if they enter anything else the game ends so overall pretty simple pretty straightforward right it's a good beginner game to make so now how do we enhance this to make rock paper scissors lizard spock basically we're going to keep the same structure we're not going to change how the game flows or anything like that we just need to redo the set of moves that are possible for the computer and the player to make and then down here we need to make a lot of changes to how the logic works for determining who wins and printing out the result because there are a lot more possibilities with five different options than with just three so first let's just start here at the top the string array of possible moves that we have is right now just rpns rock paper or scissors so instead let's go ahead and add the two options for lizard and spock so for lizard of course we can just add l as a possibility now since spock also starts with an s and that's competing with the s for scissors let's go ahead and just pick a different one how about k because k is at the end of spock i really want to keep it one letter to make it easy for the user to input and so we can just make it k to make it different from everything else and so now that we have more options here we should probably rename our string array variable from rps to rps lk now a fancy way you can do this if you are working in an ide like eclipse you can use the rename functionality so i can hit alt shift r when i'm selecting rps and then i can change this to be rps lk hit enter and you can see that it's automatically changing that variable name everywhere it's used so that's super convenient as we move down in the code we can see that the computer move is already selecting a random element from that array and it uses the length of the array to get that random element so even though we added a couple of options to the array it should now automatically include those two as possibilities so there's nothing we need to do there at all moving down in the code we have a system out print line statement that says please enter your move rp or s so we do need to change this to r p s l or k rock paper scissors lizard or spock and then we collect the next move from the player no change needed there and now we have our validation where if the player enters rp or s we break out of this loop because they entered something valid so we do need to add lizard and spock as options here so we'll just copy and paste that blizzard and spock so we got r p s l and k are now all valid moves for the player all right then below that we just have a print statement where we print out what the computer played no change needed there and then here is where most of our changes are going to take place where we're printing out the results of the game and who won no changes needed to this first part here where if the player move is equal to the computer move it's still a tie but we do need to add all of the combination results uh now that we have lizard and spock added as possibilities so all of the rest of this logic is going to be changed up quite a bit now what are the actual rules to this game that we need to implement so i brought up this image here that i found on instructables so what we've got is rock crushes lizard lizard eats paper lizard poison spock spock vaporizes rocks box smashes scissors sisters decapitates lizard scissors cuts paper paper disproves spock paper covers rock and as always rock crushes scissors so it's basically all the interactions with the lizard and the spock that are new to our logic that we need to add so let's just move down the code in our logic and add what we need to so first we have a section for if the player chooses rock so underneath that inside this else if we're going to have all the conditions that the computer could play against it so right now we have a condition for if the computer chooses paper and scissors and so we just need to add two other conditions for lizard and spock but just for fun also let's go ahead and type what the result is in addition to just whether the player wins or loses so for example here if the player plays rock and the computer plays paper we can print out paper covers rock and then you lose and here we have rock crushes scissors you win so now let's copy this else and create the condition for if the computer played lizard against the player's rock let's go off our cheat sheet here for rock and lizard rock crushes lizard so rock crushes lizard and the player wins and then let's copy that again for the spock play remember spock is k and not s and it is a spock vaporizes the rock spock vaporizes rock so in that case the player loses okay so that should cover all the conditions where the player played rock paper covers rock and so i would lose rock crushes scissors so i would win rock crushes the lizard too so i win spock vaporizes the rock so i would lose the rock is covered let's move down to paper we'll have similar things here so paper versus rock we have paper covers rock you win scissors cuts paper you lose and then let's copy this else for lizard and spock l and k so paper versus lizard is lizard eats paper lizard eats paper so i lose and then paper disproves spock so i win spock win all right that covers all of the paper scenarios where the player plays paper and the last of our current entries here is for scissors of course scissors cuts paper rock crushes scissors as it always has you lose copy paste our else ifs for lizard and spock l and k so scissors decapitates a lizard scissors decapitates blizzard so i would win as the scissors player spock smashes scissors smashes scissors so i lose that covers all of these scissors scenarios now since in our original game the computer couldn't play lizard or spock we need whole other sections for when the computer plays a lizard or spock so we're going to copy this entire section and paste it down here for if the player plays lizard so let's go down the line lizard versus paper lizard eats paper eats paper you win rock crushes the lizard so i lose now here now since we copy pasted we have a lizard versus lizard the tie games are accounted for way at the top so we actually need to change this to uh scissors but the result here is the same the scissors decapitates lizard but since i'm the lizard here i lose i'm getting decapitated i'm getting decapitated which is always an inconvenience now lizard versus spock it turns out lizard poison spock zerd poisons spock so since the player played lizard you can say you win alright so that covers all the scenarios where the player played lizard let's copy and paste all of that one more time for when the player plays spock k now we have spock versus paper which is paper disproves spock so in that case since i'm spock i lose nexbach versus rock and in that case spock vaporizes the rock spock vaporizes rock so the player wins we have spock versus scissors spock smashes scissors smashes scissors so the player wins and now here again since we copy pasted we currently have a spock versus spock so we need to change this to a spock versus lizard and we already have the outcome here lizard does poison spock but in this one since i am spock i would lose because i'm getting poisoned okay that should account for all the different possibilities let's do some play testing and see if everything works as it should so i'll hit ctrl f11 to play the game so i'm just going to play through this a handful of times and make sure everything's working fine let's play a spock computer play lizard lizard poison spock you lose so it's working play again yes or no i can enter y and play again and to remove a lizard lizard eats paper i win okay i'm gonna do this a whole bunch of times to get a really thorough test okay i think i encountered every single scenario the game could offer and all of them worked great now you have a fully functioning rock paper scissors lizard spock java program so if you've got friends who are big bang theory fans or especially those who are programmers it's pretty cool right you made your own little unique game like this in java if you enjoyed this video or learned something please be sure to leave a like and hit the subscribe button if you'd like to see the brand
