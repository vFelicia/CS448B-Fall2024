do you know how long a variable name can be in java hopefully this is a question you've never asked yourself because you you're always making nice meaningful variable names right but just how long can you make the variable name until our program explodes we're gonna find out my name is john i'm a lead java software engineer and i love sharing what i've learned in a clear understandable way so be sure to hit the subscribe button so you don't miss each new java video i also have a full java course available in a link down in the description if you're interested so i was thinking what's the best way to find out how large you can make a java variable name of course we could probably google it or something but come on where's the fun in that we're going to find out by just making longer and longer variable names until our program explodes let's get right to it we're going to create an int variable first let's create it with just a normal name like bacon int bacon equals three and we'll also just make a line of code to print it out just so we know that our program is working into bacon equals three print bacon prints out three everything looks good now let's see how large we can make this variable name first thing i want to do let's put this uh variable name on its own line and get rid of the beginning tabs just so we can know uh by looking at this position indicator down here exactly what the size of the variable name that we're making is right now so now that we've got it all set up let's make this variable name huge to do that i'm going to do the very advanced technique of copying and pasting here we go bacon bacon making bacon making making makeup make bacon copy that whole line and start pasting that all right up to 2760 let's copy that whole line and keep pasting hey what what what the heck so on that last time we pasted the whole line just vanished so what's weird is i have the cursor on this line i can keep pressing the right arrow and it doesn't go past this point in the line so it looks like at something a little more than 30 000 characters there's some kind of bug in eclipse that just destroys your entire variable name and it doesn't even work but let's actually see if we can make our program run with that size of a variable so let's copy this variable and paste it here in our print line statement and just try and run our program yep works just fine with a 32 000 character variable name but i don't know i think that's just a bug with eclipse so what actually i'm gonna do is copy this program over to intellij and see if we can get our variable name even longer all right so i've copied the program over to intellij where i'm able to also run the program just fine let's see if we can make this variable name even longer in intellij and it looks like we can it is not crashing after we continue past 32 000 so let the copy pasting resume now we're up past a million characters and intellij still hasn't crashed on us each pace now makes intellij freeze for like 10 seconds alright so now it looks like we're up past 10 million characters let's copy and paste that and double it 20 million copy paste if there is such a crime as computer abuse i am definitely guilty of it okay wow we are up past 62 million and intellij seems to have frozen so i'm going to kill it again okay we're back all right so now we get an alert that this file size is too large to even do any editing in intellij anymore okay so let's back up let's take the file that we at least had working in eclipse and copy that over to intellij the one that had the 32 000 character variable name we're going to start with that intellij and just work our way up until the program breaks since we can't even edit this file in intellij we're going to just delete it and recreate it java io exception cannot delete this file okay well let's go into windows explorer and try and delete it manually can't delete it because it's open in intellij so intellij can delete it and windows can't delete it because intellij has it open so let's once again kill intellij sorry try again to delete the file okay the file is deleted in case you didn't know a cool thing that you can do is just copy the entire text of this class and then over in intellij just highlight the source folder and hit ctrl v to paste and it'll actually automatically create that class and put all that text in it pretty cool so we know this works since we tried it before let's go ahead and double this to 64 000 see if it still works and it does so let's um double that again to 128 000. all right so there we actually did get an error our variable name is finally too long for java to deal with it so somewhere between 64 and 128 000 is the limit so before i start just wasting my life adding single characters after 64 000 until it breaks i actually did do a little bit of googling and it looks like the magic number might be 65 535 so let's go and give that a test to see if that's right all right so now we're at exactly 65 535 remember it's off by one so we see down here 65 536 here we go moment of truth okay it does work now let's add one more character so now we're at 65536 now let's see what happens and yes we do get that same error so the exact limit to a variable name that you can have in java is 65 530 characters now why would that be why is that the magic number it turns out this is actually due to a limitation in the jvm the java virtual machine so it actually says down here deep in the jvm spec documents that the length of field and method names is limited to 65 535 characters by a 16 bit unsigned length of a constant buried deep in the jbm so that makes sense why well because 16 bits means 2 to the 16th and guess what 2 to the 16th is 65 536 the actual maximum value of a 16 bit unsigned number would be 65 535. i can only hope that knowing this maximum limit to a variable name in java is absolutely useless to you if you ever try to make a variable name in java that's more than 65 000 characters long may god have mercy on your soul seriously you need help if you'd like to see more java tutorials or weird java videos like this in the future be sure to
