in this video we're going to be coding the insertion sort algorithm in java although it's not the fastest sorting algorithm in the world it's definitely one of the easiest to understand and one of the simplest to code my name is john i'm a lead java software engineer and i love sharing what i've learned with you in a clear and understandable way the full source for this program is available in a link down in the description below so go and grab it i also have a full java course available in the link down in the description if you're interested alright so i know it's really tempting to just jump into eclipse and start coding but before we do we have to make sure we have a clear understanding of how exactly the insertion sort algorithm works but luckily it's pretty straightforward let's say this is our array of numbers that we need to sort all that insertion sort does is walk through this array from beginning to end and taking each value and inserting it into the sorted array wherever it goes let's walk through this example step by step so we start with the first element three a single element is always in order with itself so we can just insert it the next element is the number one and we need to insert it in its proper place in the list which is before the number three next we have the number eight and we insert it in its proper place which is after the number three then we have the number six which needs to be inserted between the three and the eight finally we have the number two which needs to be inserted between the one and the three once we have gone through each element in the array and inserted it into its proper spot we know that we now have a sorted array so you might be saying okay i understand the concept of an insertion sort but how can i think about how we're going to actually code that insertion here's a great way to visualize that again of course we start with the number three which is in order with itself so we can just move on to the next number one what we're going to do is copy the value of this spot in the array out to a temporary variable then what we're going to do from here is walk backwards towards the beginning of the array and for each element if it is greater than one we are going to shift it to the right and we keep going back until we either reach the beginning of the array or we run into a number that is less than the number we're looking at so in this case three is greater than one so we are going to shift it one spot to the right in this case since that's the beginning of the array that's where we now insert our number one then we move on to the next element in the array eight we still copy it out to a temporary variable then we start walking backwards towards the beginning of the array and we compare the number that we find to the number eight and again if it's greater we shift it right in this case three is not greater than eight so we end up making no shifts and inserting eight into its correct spot in the array where it was next we have the number six again we copy six out to a temporary variable and then start walking backward toward the beginning of the array and we compare each number that we run into to six in this case eight is greater than six so we shift it to the right next we compare three with six three is not greater than six so we stop there and insert 6 into its correct spot in the array the final element in our array is the number 2. we copy that 2 out to a temporary variable 8 is greater than 2 so we shift it right 6 is also greater than 2 so we shift it to the right 3 is also greater than 2 so we shift it to the right 1 is not greater than 2 so we stop there insert 2 and since that was the final element now we know that we have a perfectly sorted array and now for the fun part let's get coding i'm starting here with a little bit of a setup just so we can easily test the sorting algorithm that we write this first part will create an array of 10 random integers between 0 and 99 that just gives us a randomized array that we can sort then we print out the unsorted array then call this insertion sort method which is going to contain the algorithm we're going to write then after that print out the array again hopefully in perfectly sorted order so all the magic here is going to happen inside this insertion sort method where we're going to write our algorithm so let's do that right now in this method the array to be sorted is sent in as the input array parameter so now remember from our example that we want to walk through our unsorted array from beginning to end inserting our values where they go so what we're going to start with is just a basic for loop to walk through the array so for int i equals one now you might be asking though hey john why aren't we starting with into i equals zero like we usually do in a for loop but remember in our example this first element is already sorted with itself there's never anything we need to do with it so it makes sense to just start with the second element in the array which is going to be at index one to go through the entire array we're going to go while i is less than the input array dot length then of course i plus plus to iterate i each time remember how our program is going to work for each value that we look at we're going to take that current value and copy it off to a temporary variable so to do that we're just going to create an int and call it current value and set it equal to the value in that spot in the input array so that would be input array of i next we need to walk our way from the current element in the array back toward the beginning and for each element that we run into that is greater than the current value that we're looking at we need to shift it to the right so how can we walk our way back from here towards the beginning of the array we could probably do it with either a for loop or a while loop in this case i think a while loop is probably a little bit simpler so we're going to use an int j to walk back towards the beginning of the array and we want to initialize it to be one space before the value that we're currently looking at which is i so to have j reference the position right next to it we just have to set j to i minus one now we can start our while loop our while loop is going to have a couple of conditions the first is while j is greater than or equal to zero basically all that's going to do is make us stop walking back once we actually hit the beginning of the array the other part of our condition we're going to look at the value of that spot in the array at j and keep going while that value is greater than the current value that we're looking at at i so this will have us walk back towards the beginning of the array and only stop when we either reach the beginning of the array or until we run into a value that's less than or equal to the current value that we want to insert inside this while loop is where our shifting right is going to happen for example in this case we know that 3 is greater than one so we need to take the value at j currently which is the number three and we want to shift it right by one so to do that we need to take the input array at position j plus one and set it equal to the value of that input array at position j so in this example j is currently the position of this 3 here right so we're going to set the value at j plus 1 to be equal to the value at j so it's going to look like this next inside this while loop to keep moving towards the beginning of the array we just need to decrement j by one so to do that we can just do j minus minus which is the same thing as saying j equals j minus one so what this while loop is going to do is work its way toward the beginning of the array until it finally reaches the beginning of the array or it reaches a number that is less than or equal to the current value that it's looking at and when it does it'll pop out of this while loop and that's when we need to insert this value that we're looking at into its correct spot so to do that we need to set the value at input array position j plus 1 and set that equal to current value so in this case what that will do is take this position here and set it to the value that we saved off as a temporary variable all right so let's go ahead and test our insertion sort algorithm with an array of 10 random integers okay so it prints out the before in completely random order and then prints out the after and they are perfectly sorted awesome and we can run it a couple more times to make sure it wasn't a fluke and as you can see with this example even if we get duplicates of the same number like we have two threes here it still does the right thing and keeps them right next to each other in the array now that we know that this works let's have some fun and see how long it takes to sort really large arrays of numbers so instead of just 10 numbers let's do a thousand numbers and also let's make those random numbers be between about zero and ten thousand instead of a hundred all right so that happened pretty instantaneously it took less than one second so let's step it up let's try a hundred thousand we go okay that took a little bit longer took about six seconds so let's try one million here we go okay it took a second just to print them out let's see how long it takes to run still hasn't finished this one is taking quite a while so sorting a hundred thousand elements took about six seconds so you might think that sorting 10 times that amount a million is going to take 10 times as long or about 60 seconds but this algorithm has a time complexity of n squared which means that as you increase the number of elements that you want to sort the amount of time it takes to sort those elements goes up exponentially so the jump from sorting a hundred thousand elements to sorting a million elements could be a lot worse than you think so i'm gonna let this run and we'll come back and see exactly how long it ends up taking okay it finally finished looks like it ended up taking about seven minutes that's not great so this sorting algorithm doesn't make a whole lot of sense for sorting a raise larger than about a hundred thousand or so elements once you get beyond that it starts taking just way too much time of course this is far from
