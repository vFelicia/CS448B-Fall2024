sets well first just what exactly is a set well a set is one of the things available to you in Java's collections framework which means that a set is one way that you can group a whole bunch of like objects together and handle them as one unit so for example you can add items to a set you can see if a set contains an item and you can remove things from the set and it all works very very similarly to how you might use something like an arraylist in Java so if you used a list or an array list in Java then you're in luck this will be very familiar to you however sets do have some subtle differences from lists and those differences really are important because you'll end up using sets to solve completely different problems than you would want to solve with a list so first let's just go about actually creating a set so let's say we wanted to create a variable that holds like a collection of string names for example a set is one way that you can do that so if you wanted to create a set of strings you would say set and then in angle brackets here you have to tell it what type what class of things are going to be held as the elements of this set and here since we want it to be a set of names it makes sense to make them strings and then you can see that it automatically imported java.util.set so that's the import you'll want for set and then like any variable we have to give this a name since this will be a set that's supposed to hold names we'll call it names so now we've created this names variable for our set so now we have to initialize it now you might think that to instantiate your set you would just say equals new set right I mean that seems to make sense it's how you create the vast majority of your other objects in Java but if you try that you'll see that you get a compilation error and it says set is abstract and cannot be initialized this is a part that can be confusing to a lot of programmers so let's talk a little bit about what's going on here the reason we get this error is because a set is an interface and not a normal class like if we control click into this set we can see that it says public interface set not public class set and you can't create instances of interfaces you can only create instances of classes that Implement those interfaces now that is where hash sets come in so instead of saying equals new set instead we'll say equals new hash set and we'll go ahead and put in our Diamond operator here to make the compiler happy now if we control click into hash set here and scroll up we can see that hash set implements the set interface so basically how it works is the set interface is where Java says any kind of class that wants to be a set has to support all of these kinds of operations and methods like adding items removing them looking them up Etc it's totally up to each individual kind of set to determine how it wants to implement all of those functionalities behind the scenes the hash set here is one of those actual set implementations so you might think hey if a hash set is just one implementation of a set in Java are there any others available to me and the answer is of course yes there are we will talk about those just a little bit but hash set is the set implementation that you are probably going to use 99 plus percent of the time you ever use a set so that's definitely going to be the one that we focus on here all right so now we've got our shiny new hash sets all declared and initialized let's give it a ride and see what we can do with it again if you have used lists before in your Java programs a lot of this is going to look very familiar which is great first let's go ahead and add some objects to our set and you do that by calling the add method so we'll just call names dot add and then we pass into this add method whatever we want to add to our set this is a set of string names let's add a name Walter now what we can do real quick here is go ahead and print out our set just to make sure it's adding this name correctly and to do that we can just do system.out.printline and print out our names set now if we go ahead and run our program we can see that it prints out the contents of our set which right now now is just one thing the name Walter now let's go ahead and add a few more names to our list names dot add Jesse Schuyler Mike Saul let's go ahead and run it again and make sure it now prints out all of these names and there we go we have Walter Mike Saul Skyler and Jesse now you might have noticed here that it printed out these names in a very different order than they were added that's different from how something like a list operates which always maintains a certain order so that's the first of the important differences between lists and hash sets in Java a list maintains the order that you add the elements to that list and you can also do various things to sort a list in whichever order that you want but a hash set has no particular order so there are absolutely zero guarantees as to what order the objects will be in your set after you add them now though let's talk about the second big difference between lists and sets let's say I wanted to add something to this set that already existed in the set so I'll try and add Walter again now if we go go ahead and run our code to print out our set again you can see that Walter exists in the set but it still only exists once even though we added it twice and that is because sets by Design do not allow duplicates so if I wanted I could add Walter to this set just hundreds and hundreds of times it still only gets added to the set once so now let's get rid of all these extra Walters one is quite enough next though to remove things from a set is pretty much exactly the same as removing an object from a list all you do is call names dot remove and then pass in the object that you want to remove from your set so let's say we wanted to remove Walter we'll run our program and see that Walter has been removed however one thing that you can do with a list that you can't do with a set is remove an item by using its index but that can be a bit deceiving and let me show you why so for example if you wanted to remove the very first thing from the list you would just pass in the index 0 because 0 is the first thing in your list so you might notice we don't get any compilation errors or anything and we can even go ahead and run it without any errors however if we look at this we can see that nothing at all was removed we still have all five items in our set well what happened is for a list there's actually a separate remove method that takes the int index of the element that you want to remove but for hash sets that's separate remove method that takes an INT index doesn't actually exist and that kind of makes sense right because the elements of a hash set are in no particular order anyway so if you said okay remove the zeroth element from my hash set it's pretty much unpredictable which element of the set it's actually going to remove so what it's actually doing is just calling the version of the remove method that takes in the actual element that you want to remove from the set and of course the element zero doesn't appear anywhere in our set of strings so nothing is removed so even though there are no errors and it might look like it might be working it's probably not actually doing what you expected at all now there are a bunch of other methods available to you on sets as well for example you can get the current size of your set just by calling names dot size now there are five things in our list so when we run it it should print out five you can also use the dot contains method which will return a Boolean true or false depending on if your set contains the object that you pass in so if we say hey does my set contain saw it will say true it does contain Saul but if I want to see if it contains Gus it will return false there's also a method available called is empty which will tell you whether or not your set is empty and right now it will tell me false because my set's not empty next if you just want to get rid of all the elements in your set you don't need to individually remove them all one by one instead you can just call names dot clear and then if we go ahead and print out our names set one more time we can see that it now contains zero elements it's been cleared you'll probably pretty often run into some situations where you want to perform some kind of action on all the elements of your set so you might want to iterate through your set and print them all out add them all to a file something like that there are a few different ways that you can do that with sets one way is using what's called an enhanced for Loop now to do that I can say four and then I want to Loop through each element each string inside my names set so here I say okay for each string name inside my set of names I want to do the following so if I want to just print out each name here I would just say system.out.printline and print the name so what this should do when I run it is just print out every name in in the set on its own line and we can see that that's exactly what it does now one thing to remember here though is that since your hash set is in no particular order at all it could iterate through your hash set in basically any order however if you want to be really really cool and impress all your super nerdy Java programmer friends if you know how to use lambdas you can use a Lambda to iterate through your set now I have an entire other video on lambdas which you can find right here if you haven't seen it but to just do it real quickly here let's say I wanted to go through my names set and for each element in my set I wanted to print it out well I can just call this for each method on my set and then just pass in the Lambda the function that I wanted to execute for each element of my set so if I want to just print each element out I can just say system dot out colon colon print line it prints out all five elements of my set just the same but does it in a very impressive one line now you can also use names.iterator to give you an iterator object that you can use to iterate through your set and this iterator will work exactly the same way that it does for lists and other pieces of the Java Collections framework so we'll declare our iterator object it'll be an iterator of strings because our set is a set of strings we'll give it a name let's call it names iterator and set that equal to names.iterator now to use this to iterate over our set we will use a while loop so while names iterator has a next item has next so while there are more things and are set to iterate over we'll go ahead and print out names iterator dot next let's go ahead and get rid of this for each implementation just to make sure our iterator implementation works how we expect and there we go we got Walter Mikes all Skyler and Jesse looks good maybe a big question that you might have is all right when would I actually want to use this under what programming situation is a set or a hash set in particular useful now the simple answer to that is well whenever you want a collection of items and you don't want duplicates in that collection and you don't particularly care which order that they're in and of course that kind of varies depending on your particular programming needs for whatever you're working on but one area that you'll see sets used a whole lot is for something as simple as removing duplicate items from a list let's say you have some list that potentially contains a bunch of duplicates that you want to get rid of now you could write some kind of clever program to kind of iterate through that list a whole bunch of times and you know comparing each element to every other element to see if it contains a duplicate and remove them so it only contains one of each element when it's finished but a way way easier way of doing that is take all the elements of that list and dump them into a set and since a set cannot contain any duplicates when it tries to add a duplicate to that set it just won't happen and your resulting set will be the same as the list that you started out with but just with no duplicates now let me show you real quick exactly how to do that let's say we had some list how about a list of integers in this case we'll just call it number list equals new array list so now let's go ahead and add some things to our number list so numberless dot add one two three and now we're going to go ahead and add some duplicates so we're going to go ahead and add 2 again and then let's just go ahead and add one again so now if we print out our list number list we see that we definitely have some duplicates we have one two three two one so now if I want to get rid of all the duplicates from this list I can just add all those elements to a set so let's go ahead and create our are set it'll be a set of integers we'll call it number set equals new hash set so now what we can call is number set dot add all and then pass in our number list so this add all is another one of the really cool methods available to you with sets that allows you to take basically any collection and add all of its elements to another collection that's pretty much it what we should be able to do is print out our number set and our resulting set should now have those same numbers but just with no duplicates and it does so the list had one two three two one but putting all those items into a set automatically and very very easily removed all the duplicates so we're just left with one two three and you can do this in an even cooler way if you want you can see that I'm getting a little warning here that says hey add all can be replaced with a parameterized Constructor call and basically what it's saying is hey you you could yes you could do this and say okay number set dot add all and then pass in your list but instead what you can do is just pass in the number list to the actual hash set Constructor in the first place and you don't even need to call that add all method and it turns out that it will do exactly the same thing now though I want to give you just a little bit of insight into why this is called a hash set so the reason it's called a hash set is because this set implementation actually uses a hash table as its storage mechanism behind the scenes now how a hash table actually works is a bit outside the scope of this video but what using a hash table does is it allows for extremely fast operations on this set for most types of elements if they're constructed properly that allows for what is called constant time ads removes and lookups so what that actually means is no matter how large your hash table gets if it's very small or if it's very large adding another element to that set or removing an element from that set or checking to see if a given element exists in that huge set we'll always take the same amount of time it'll take a constant amount of time no matter how big or small your hash set is now that's compared to something like a list where the larger that your list gets the more expensive each ad remove and lookup operation on that list is now I did mention earlier that there were two other set implementations in Java besides hash set so let's talk about those a little bit now one of the other implementations is called a tree set now if you end up using a tree set instead of a hash set all the methods that we already went over work exactly the same way there's there's really no difference there now what a tree set offers that a hash set doesn't is that the elements that you put into that set will be ordered with what's called their natural ordering so for example in our original set our set of names here if I implemented that as a tree set instead of a hash set let's go ahead and run it and then see what the output looks like there okay so if I look at how it's printed I can see that they're not printed out in the order that I added them to the set but they are printed out in their natural ordering in this case since they're strings they're printed out in alphabetical order and that's because behind the scenes this is using a tree instead of a hash map as its implementation of the set so as things are added to that tree they're put into that tree in the correct ordering now that seems pretty cool right so hey why would I use a hash set ever if it does you know all the same things but a tree set I could get some ordering out of it why would I ever want to use a hash set and the answer is that a hash that is way way faster than a tree set so you should only use a tree reset when you're in a situation that you want to set but you really care about the ordering of the elements but if you have no need to maintain that ordering at all it's way better to use a hash set in your program instead just because it's so much faster now the last set implementation is actually called linked hash set so what's different about a linked hash set is that it doesn't maintain the natural ordering of the elements but what it does maintain is the insertion order of your elements so what that means is if I go ahead and run this I can see that it prints out these items in the exact same order that they were added to my set now as far as performance goes a linked hash that is almost as fast as a hash set it isn't quite as fast as a hash set but it's it's way better than a tree set is as far as performance so still you should only use a linked hash set if you care about maintaining that insertion ordering but if you don't care about that it's still in your best interest to use hash sets and you'll probably see hash sets used way more often in the real world than you will tree sets or linked hash sets but it's still good to know that they exist in case you need that kind of functionality for the program that you're working on if you enjoyed this video or learned something please let me know by leaving a like and let me know what other kinds of videos you'd like to see in
