you might have heard that Java is a strongly typed language but what does that actually mean especially if you started with Java to learn programming it might not mean much at all to you is being strongly typed a good thing or a bad thing and what does it actually mean to you the programmer as you develop your Java programs we'll talk about all of that with examples in this video my name is John and I'm a lead Java software engineer I also have a full Java course available in a link down in the description if you're interested there you'll find over 8 hours of exclusive videos covering dozens of java topics so if you haven't already go check it out first of course what exactly does being strongly typed mean well that term is one of those things that nerds tend to argue a lot about they just mean that Java is very strict about enforcing data types if you make a variable Java is going to make sure that you tell it explicitly what type that variable is and after that it'll keep an eagle eye on it to make sure you never change that variable to any other type one once a variable is declared its data type will never change so for example when you create a variable for an INT you have to tell Java explicitly int my number equals 10 Java needs to be told that this variable is an INT and if you take that away Java goes I can't resolve this my number you've given me with absolutely no type information at all how am I supposed to figure that out so you put in int and it goes ah okay int thank you now there is one small exception where starting with Java 10 Java can sometimes infer the data type of a local variable Without You explicitly telling it so for example here we could actually change int to VAR and Java sees oh you didn't explicitly tell me this was an INT but I can see here that you're immediately assigning an INT value to it when you declare it so that tells me it's an INT thanks but even here the type of this my number variable isn't ambiguous at all to the compiler this my number will still start out as an INT and will always be an INT so even with this feature Java is no less strongly typed than it was before anyway once you declare this variable Java will continue to make sure that this my number only ever holds an INT for the rest of its existence for example if after this you try to assign my number to be casad the compiler will say nah I don't think so a quesadilla although delicious is not a valid try again sir so in Java it's the compiler that's making sure that you're obeying all type rules across the board all the time and because Java is doing this at compile time in addition to being a strongly typed language that means it's also what's called a statically typed language these two terms strongly typed and statically typed they're often confused with each other but they're not really the same being strongly typed just means that Java strictly enforces its type rules but being statically typed means it's strictly enforcing those type rules at compile time specifically now if you've only ever coded in Java or any other strong and statically typed language maybe this all seems like well duh of course you can't just write code that assigns a variable with some type other than the type it was declared with that would be absolute Anarchy what selfrespecting programming language could allow such Madness to compile well actually other languages can and do strictly enforce their typing rules but they might do it later at runtime instead of compile time let me show you what I mean this may be the first time ever that a programming language other than Java has been shown on this channel so I think to rank historic events by how noteworthy they are it goes something like moon landing fall of the Roman Empire John codes in Python you'll be telling your grandchildren where you were when you saw this now as we said of course in Java you always have to declare your variable types like int my number equals 10 but in Python you don't you just say my number equals 10 and also no semicolon it's a crazy world of programming languages out there python will always infer the data type of a variable based on what value you give it not only that though you can also do this my number equals burger and that's fine python just goes whatever got it my number is a string now now that's because python is a dynamically typed language so you never have any explicit type declarations you never say this is an INT or a string or a cat or anything like that it figures it all out at runtime as the program is running and as we've shown here it's also flexible so a variable's data type can just change based on whatever value you give it and python doesn't care it'll just make it happen and what people like about that is they can quickly whip up some prototype code without the extra characters of having to Define your data types the tradeoff of course is that python doesn't catch potential type errors until runtime and then if there's a problem it'll slam face first into a wall so you can have something like x equals hello and then Y = X + 3 and it doesn't show any errors here but then when you go to actually run it it says oh no you can't concatenate a string to an INT those types aren't compatible what are you thinking in Java those kinds of type mismatches won't even be able to compile so you won't run into those kinds of unexpected type issues at runtime one important thing to note though is that even with this flexibility python is not considered a weekly typed programming language it's still considered to be strongly typed because it does enforce its typing rules it just does it during runtime instead of compile time so it's dynamically typed instead of statically typed so what exactly would be a weakly typed language then well it would be one that is way more forgiving when it comes to types one that plays fast and loose with the rules letting you do just whatever kind of wacky crap you want and then figuring out some way to accomplish whatever ridiculous thing you're asking it to do so a great example is Javascript the famous web scripting language having nothing at all to do with Java except sharing its name basically how it works in JavaScript is whatever you tell it to do it'll find some way to give it a shot so for example if you put in VAR result equal 3 + 2 in in quotes let's write the result to the console so we can see what it comes up with console.log result so right now it's not giving any sort of syntax error but what is it going to do here is it going to convert the three to a string and spit out 32 or is it going to convert the two to an INT and spit out five and the answer is it is absolutely going to do one of those things and give you an answer so let's go ahead and run this and we see that it converts the three to a string concatenates them and gives you 32 but what if we changed this plus to a minus so if we run that well now it converts this two to an INT and subtracts 3 minus 2 and gives you one so it does kind of the opposite of what it did before okay so what about three * 2 in quotes let's run that okay so that time it converted the two to an INT and then multiplied them together but now what if we really threw it for a loop let's try to multiply three times burger and see what it does now of course if we did this in Java it would just laugh in our face you can't multiply an INT with a string no I'm not compiling that garbage give me something that at least makes some kind of sense but not JavaScript JavaScript goes oh what we're multiplying an INT with Burger okay yeah no no that sounds like an awesome idea totally makes sense I can totally see why you would want to do that I'll give it a shot and let you know what I get and so if you run it it gives Nan not a number so instead of blowing up with a type mismatch error at compile time like Java would or at runtime like python would it says okay I did my very best to multiply three times Burger but because nothing made sense and it was pretty much impossible I just came up with not a number but I didn't throw any exceptions are you proud of me JavaScript with its weak typing is like a faithful puppy just dying to please its owner willing to try and do whatever you ask it to do no matter how ridiculous it is and Java with its strong typing is like a cat it's like hm what you asked me to do what now why in the world would I want to do something that ridiculous no no just no now give me my dinner and try again when you have something that makes sense then it marches off somewhere to lay down in the sun showing you its butt with its tail in the air maybe that's where all the cat stuff in this Java Channel comes from as
