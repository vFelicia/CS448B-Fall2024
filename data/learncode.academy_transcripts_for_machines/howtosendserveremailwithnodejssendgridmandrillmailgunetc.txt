so if you've never sent email from a web application that can be a daunting idea at first uh but it's actually really easy for anyone that's done it so we're just going to show you how to send email from a no. JS application the process is very similar for a PHP or Ruby on Rails app uh but since I've been doing node tutorials we're going to stick to this and so it's a lot easier to use an external service because for several reasons one you don't have to configure your server to be a mail server that doesn't go to fam which can be a journey all on its own uh and it's just so much more simple uh and more reliable to let someone else handle that part of the process for you just like letting someone else handle your Hardware I think email is something that is always worth it to let someone else handle some main Services out there for it mandril send grid and mail Gun there's probably a dozen more these seem to be three of the big players um I can say that of the two I've I've used mandril and SRA I do prefer send grid they both will give you 12,000 emails a month for free 400 a day I think is how they cap it uh so they'll give you that many a month for free although Mandrill sometimes will go to spam um and it may have to do with the size of the website smaller websites or something uh but I also feel like mandril is a little bit slower to deliver email send grid on a brand new website nobody knows about will not go to spam and um it's just reliable you'll get an email in about 5 Seconds so we're going to be doing a send grid example uh so what you need to do is you need to go npm install uh here's what I have right here just so you can see I have a basic I just rain Express generator so I have just an basic Express app haven't really done anything to it you're going to go npm install save send grid let's install send grid so that's going and then you're going to go to send grid.com and you're going to sign up for an account which won't even take your credit card information won't do anything if you are doing the try for free option so you're going to go ahead sign up for an account now one thing send grid does which might be why they don't go to spam as often is they have a person actually approve your account application I don't know what that person is looking for uh because all they really ask for is your name address and website um but when you sign up for that it will take up to six or seven hours I don't know it might take till the next day if it's overnight I did this yesterday um just so you know that I'm I'm not talking from past experience wh I deleted him I just yesterday created a new site added Mandel to it it went to spam took about five or maybe was more like 15 it was a while to to receive an email a lot longer than I wanted it to be uh and then I added srid right away as well srid did not go to spam and I got emails within 5 seconds so but it did take six or seven hours for them to provision my account um it says in Red Bar once you've logged in account is provisioning um you know you'll hear back soon so as soon as that provisioned I was good let's go show you how to install this and we'll be good so you go to npm send grid I just type Google for those npm send grid and this will give you kind of the easiest way to start with that package here's my index route so I guess I can go res. send okay boot at my app npm start okay so there I am I just have an okay route on the the homepage so let's go ahead and send my email when you log into the homepage so I'm pasting that in that's going to ask for my username and password that I created when I made my account so that's all that is um and then you just fill out this information so let's make this I don't want you to see my password so I actually set them in the process environment variables so I'm sneaky haha can't send my username and password and you know what I also don't want you to see my personal email so haha you don't know who I am uh we'll say Rob we'll say no reply at Learn code. Academy there we go and so then let's see if it's an error let's just do res send and if it's not an error then res. send woohoo okay there you go that's done it's installed my account has been provisioned because I did this yesterday um so let's go ahead and run this let's go ahead restart where where am I restart my Express app reload this page it says woohoo let's count five one two three four and email ha there you go no reply learn code academy is sent to me an email so that's what you'll use if you're wanting to give you know email confirmations that someone has subscribed to a service or whatever email notifications that blah blah blah has changed so hope that helps you out and have an excellent day
