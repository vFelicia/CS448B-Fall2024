hey everybody this is going to be an upgrade to my one of my most popular videos of all time it has over 500 000 views and it's the question i get asked absolutely the most by new beginners and that is hey i just finished this sweet new website how do i make it an actual website i've got my html and css files and stuff but i actually want to turn it into myawesomesite.com how do i do that is there cost associated with that and what is the easiest fastest cheapest best path for me so the short answer is there is no one answer to it there's a lot of different ways that you can do it and as your skill level grows you may actually choose some different methods like as you learn github and as you learn other things there's there's a variety of methods out there but if you're starting off and you're an html css developer the absolute easiest way to go is to get a shared hosting server by a domain name through a separate domain name registrar so that way instead of 127.0.0.1 you have myawesomedomain.com and then you're going to get a web server a web hosting plan the web server is a computer that lives on the internet that's constantly online and you're going to put your html and css files on that server and they're going to point your domain name to that server and then tada you have a website and if you ever want to move the server somewhere else you have your domain separate you can set up a different server and point your domain to the new server that's why it's very important to keep them separate it makes that a lot simpler so we're going to go through that on this video we're going to try to do it in record time get all the steps so you can actually see me by an actual domain by an actual hosting plan and then connect the two and you are done i'll also mention that i have links to these two places i'm going to recommend in the description if you use those links you will support this channel um so they are affiliate links uh however it very important for me to mention that i will never ever ever recommend something that i don't fully believe is the best solution for the developers i'm recommending it to so i would never ever give a false recommendation in order to get support for the channel or anything like that so i'm on iwantmyname.com this is my favorite place this is where i keep my domains my absolute favorite place for domains to live it's super easy they give you domain privacy for free which is my favorite thing about them and uh so yeah you just start off by searching for a domain let's say myawesomewebsite.com nope not dot zom howabout.com there you go myawesomewebsite.com is available let's buy this thing wait nope it's taken my awesome awesomenewwebsite.com see if you got that one the internet's got that one available for me let's buy it let's go ahead check out my awesomenewwebsite.com you can see that it's going to cost 14 i'll go back real quick some of these newer domains might be as expensive as seventy or a hundred dollars so the dot coms are the cheapest but they're the hardest to get exactly what you want as well i can also say that dot coms tend to do a little bit better in search engine optimization so that is something to think about so i'm going to go ahead and check out and then i'll enter my credit card address and go through all this i'll skip that for you i'll see you at the next step okay boom i filled out all my credit card information i bought my awesomenewwebsite.com you can see i'm on my dashboard i can go ahead click on that and the most important thing that i can do is i can change my name servers down here now i have to buy web hosting first i'm going to get some web hosting and then i'm going to point these name servers to the web hosting also you can see that i got privacy enabled by default which means that you people cannot look up the website and get my home address which is what you get if you don't have domain privacy turned on so let's go over here to shared hosting plans on hostgator.com again link is in the description and you can either buy it for a single domain or unlimited domains uh and then ssl certificate comes baked in on all of them that means the https which with the lock which is good if you do want to do unlimited domains multiple domains maybe you're going to be building several websites for several people uh like another dollar or two a month and you can get this one instead that's definitely a good move uh so let's go and buy this one though because we just have our one domain and say hey i already own this domain of myawesomewebsite.com myawesomenewwebsite.com so i don't need to purchase that and then i'm going to go ahead and fill out some username and security pin information but let's come down here first and see you can see that the the bigger you go the more discount they're going to give you obviously that makes sense there's a few coupon codes that you can always use you can use let's make a deal that's a coupon code that they give me because i recommend so many people over to them at this point um and that's going to give you a really good discount you can see that if we go over to i don't know just say 12 months then that gives us 35 off you can see that the coupon code is reflected here up to 40 percent off so that's a really good coupon code um other coupon codes that they always have out there is drop 10 bucks and drop 25 perks so drop 25 those kind of always work at any point in time as well but i think let's make a deal is kind of the best coupon code that i've found for them the other thing you're going to make sure you do is turn off all this stuff because they're going to want to upsell you on all these other things that you may or may not need if you're not good at backing up your code you might want to pay the two dollars a month for that if you want gmail to power your email addresses then five dollars a month is what gmail charges so you can get your address at yourdomain.com but it's all through gmail that's what i do personally that's a great way to do it but that is five dollars a month as well so there are some extra things you can buy but you don't really need them i'm gonna go ahead and buy this hosting here and we'll see at the next step hey so check this out i've got all my credit card information added and because i'm going to delete this account after i make it i just got the one month and i did the drop 10 bucks i get to buy this for .01 cents now that's probably not the route you want to go if you want to have your website around for a little while you're going to want to buy more than one month and the let's make a deal coupon code is probably going to be a better deal for you overall because after this it goes up to like the full eight or ten dollar monthly plan uh but one of the things i actually really do like about hostgator is they're one of the only places that lets you do a monthtomonth shared hosting plan lots of places make you do a minimum of three months so i figured i'd point that out pretty cool that you can't actually get started for one penny okay there you go i now have a web host and again the web host is where we're going to put our html and our css files and they're going to always be online and we are going to point our domain name to the web host as well so you can see i've got a hosting package here let's go ahead and click over on the hosting tab and i can find out the details that i need to send my domain name over i'm going to click on manage here and it's going to take just a second to load and then i can find what are called my name servers my name servers are what i need to plug in here let's go update name servers on iwantmyname.com and let's go to settings here and there we go we have our name servers i only have two name servers which is more common than four so name server one name server two and then i just get rid of all the others you can see they only require two lots of places only have two and now our domain name is pointed to our dashboard so all we want to do now is let's go back to overview and let's go to file manager and upload our files and then we are going to be done so when i click on our file manager here you can see that we've got this folder structure this is our actual server we're kind of connected to that this www is a folder so i can double click on that i've got this default.html i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to right click and hit delete so now let's upload my own stuff let's click upload here and select some files from my desktop i've got my websites and index in a styles.css let's add index let's add style css they're both uploaded let's go back here and see if we can find them tada they're there and now let's try going to my awesome new website dot took me a long time to type that out and tada you can see that i actually have a website myawesomenewwebsite.com it is uploaded it is online it is finished it's it's really that easy get a domain name get hosting and hostgator obviously and i want my name do make it very easy other places like godaddy make this process much more frustrating there are a lot of hosts that make this process a lot more detailed in the steps that you have to take uh which is why i like these two companies they make it very very simple very fast it all happens real time um and so in just a few minutes i've got a website up uh i've got my files on it and we are good to go so i hope this video helped you out i hope you feel empowered to go create your own actual websites on the actual internet now um if you have any questions or you feel like there's anything i missed definitely leave them in the comments below thumbs up the questions that you had yourself so they'll
