so a question I've been asked a ton is how do I get my website online once I've coded it here's a website I've got here's the files for it and I can view it in Chrome but I want to get this thing online with its own domain name we're going to cover that in this email and it's a lot simpler than you might think here's the steps uh one you got to get a domain if you don't have one uh that's going to be about $12 a month uh $12 a year I'm sorry um and then you got to get a web host that's about roughly $5 a month we're going to do one that's a month uh because you get unlimited domain names with this one uh I recommend for a web host going with uh hostgator.com I have some codes for that uh these guys tend to be the cheapest and they have great customer support so you're going to get a lot out of them um and you can also use drop 25 perk drop 25% coupon code uh to save 25% or you can do drop 10 bucks uh and save 10 bucks on that so we're going to go through that process of what all that looks like so you're comfortable before you start it you're going to upload your files and then you're going to dance and rejoice because your website is live that's pretty much it to upload your files I recommend cyberduck I think it's just a great simple free program and that's it so let's get into host skater and do step one all right so here we are at Host skat.dk well over a dozen helped a lot of people that are using other hosts and this just has the best for the price um if you go to web hosting we're going to get our domain and our web hosting at the same time uh you have two choices you can go single domain that's the cheapest but if you bump it up like $2 a month or I guess $3 if you were good at math 350 uh you can get unlimited domains which means you can have all the websites you want as long as you pay for the domain name uh and this is definitely the one I'd recommend that way if you want to add your brother 's website anybody else's website you can do it for free they just have to buy the domain um let's go Will's awesome site Wills awesome site is available so Wills awom site.com I'm actually going to buy this um and let it expire so uh here we go I'm going to do a onemonth baby package if you did the 36 months you can apply that big drop 25% coupon on there and that's going to save $75 uh but I wouldn't do that I'm not going to do that for this example uh since this is a fake website I'm never going to use I'm just going to do one month and I'm just going to do drop 10 bucks uh to actually bring that down and then I'm going to uncheck all these addons you do not need these addons uh I never ever recommend for anybody to do these addons so there we go that brings us down to a total of $12 which is basically the cost of our domain name and the first first month of Hosting is free I'm going to fill out all my billing information and I'll be right back all right we're successful I was able to register for the hosting um and now I've gotten this email which you will want to guard with your life because this is all the server information uh and this is what you want to pass on to somebody else if the website ever changes hands this is basically server access uh here's kind of what it is is this is our control panel where you can edit a lot of stuff install WordPress add email addresses for your domain name you just got uh this is your username and your password to log into the website that's my domain which I've I click there it does not work yet because a domain takes 1 to 24 hours to do what's called propagation uh so it can happen as fast as an hour but i' I'd give it a full day uh and then your server IP this is actually your server uh that this domain name now points to uh and so we can actually access the server with this IP until our domain name propagates so let's go ahead and copy the server IP let's go ahead and crank open cyberduck and hit open connection we're going to connect to the server now in the future we can use Wills awom site.com uh but once again that's not propagated yet so cyberduck won't be able to connect to it either let's copy the username let's copy the password and then where sometimes you if you run into any errors here you may need to change your connect mode to passive FTP uh so if you're run any problems do that so here we go I've connected to my server and if I go to www um sometimes you'll have a default HTML file that you'll just want to go ahead and delete you don't need it let's go ahead and just copy all of my files let's just drag them on over cyberduck is burping at me yes don't show again I want to switch to secure so there you go all the files are now copying over to my web my web host and that's pretty much it uh the way we can connect to it and see if that worked is let's go and copy the server IP here's kind of a quick workaround is you can go to your username which it made will stir it cut off the end so I can now go to my IP address tildo wilster and this will be my website there we go I had to hit refresh because it was still in the process of uploading there you go and that's it my website is now online and within 24 hours I can go to what what is it again wills awom site.com and hit ref and load it up and it will be my learn code rocks website let me actually prove it to you that this is what happened I'm going to go change this learn code is awesome let me change it what is that learn code rocks really rocks there we go let's go ahead and redrago HTML file up it's probably going to ask me if I want to replace it yep I do want to replace it let's hit refresh and now learn code really rocks and that is how you put your website online hope you enjoyed the lesson and have a great day
