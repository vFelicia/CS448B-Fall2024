hey in this video we are going to continue web development for absolute beginners for people who know nothing if you have not seen the prior 3 videos i'll put the link in the description to this whole series and you'll want to watch that first but let's move forward so the first skill you're going to need as a web developer is the ability to build a layout to basically look at a design a graphic design of what a website should look like and then turn that into code so let's learn how you do that we're also going to introduce a few new tags along the way so basically the tags that we're going to use in this video are div tags div just means divider i'll show you what that is here let's add a bunch of div tags let's do a b c whoop i hate it when it does that sometimes and d i'm going to save that and you can see there's really nothing special about a div tag it just basically is a content block it's just a divider there and a div tag actually is this box that spans as much space as it has from left to right which is why they're stacking one on top of the other and not left to right because a div tag by default gets what's called a block display so it's going to fill out the whole content left to right and then the next div tag by default goes below it now with css we can change all that but that's what a div tag is so basically every little content block of your web page is a div tag but after a while developers realized wow if you go to the source code of a webpage and just see millions of div tags it's not very easy to read and understand what's going on so we introduced what are called semantic tags they're all basically div tags but they have different names to allow us to read a web page easier as we're building it so these tags are a header tag which you guessed it is usually used for adding a header of a website other tags are nav section footer all these tags are divs but they allow us to describe our web page in a way that's much easier to read and also a way that's much much easier for search engines like google to understand what the areas of content mean so these are called again semantic tags which means they're a lot easier to read so we're going to use div tags we're going to use semantic tags and we're also going to use those good old ul tags with the li tags inside of it you use that a lot in web development for your layouts but that's pretty much it when you're building layouts those are the tags that you use so let's get into what a layout is and how you know which tags to use where i'm going to go to a screenshot of bing.com here so here's bing.com and i'm going to pull up some boxes that i drew around if i had to turn this into a design if if you got given this screenshot and said hey build me a webpage that is laid out like this how would you do it so if i had to build this layout i'd start off with two tags a header tag which is this whole big piece up here this whole top part and then i do a section tag down here that includes all this down here so two tags at the very top level right inside of the body tag that all the rest of the content will go into inside of the header tag i would have a nav tag that would house the navigation this right here would be a ul full of lis for each link so this is an unordered list a ul and then there's an li and li and li and li and so on and over here i'd probably do three div tags a div here a div here and then a div here for the mobile menu kind of button so that's the tags that you would use then here i would just have a div tag for this and then here i would have a ul tag with a bunch of lis in it because again if you look at all these they're really just a bunch of uh it's an unordered list of items they just have different backgrounds and different text titles but they're really all the same thing so that's the tags that i would use to layout this entire website and then down here i would have three div tags as well and i would layer them next to each other from there on when you have a good skill set of building layouts all you have to learn is one bit at a time how to build the pieces of content that you want how do i build a navigation and make links all go side by side like this how do i build this little thing with a circle and the guy inside of it how do i build a search bar and make it look like this those are all little bits of css that you learn along the way and nobody knows it all and you have to google all the time to figure out how you do what you how to do what you want to do and that's part of the fun of being a web developer is that you're always always learning so the layout that we're going to build for our webpage is going to look like this we're going to have a header tag you guessed it inside we'll have a navigation and probably a big background image and then we're going to have two sections and a footer section one will have three equal boxes section two will just be one big section i don't know what we'll put in there maybe some text or something and then our footer section down here and that's gonna be our website so you can see it's really not gonna be a whole lot of tags to make the layout component of our design so let's go over to our code so the first thing we're going to want to do is create a header tag there's our header tag and we'll want to create two section tags again i'm just typing the tag name and hitting tab another thing i can do is i can do section star 2 and i just got two sections so i'll call this triple section because if you'll remember i'm gonna actually have three squares inside of there later on lower section there we go and then let's make a footer tag footer and i'll just add header here so there we have it that is our layout and as you can see they act just like divs there's really no style here at all so let's add a little bit of style when i'm building a layout the easiest way to start is to add background colors to every piece so i'm going to add a header style here let's make this background color black there we go and then let's do section this background color will be white and the font color then will probably need to become something else so let's make color gray for now sure that works and then let's make the footer it's going to have a background color black as well so there's our basic section from here on out we'll finish up this video by learning about how to add spacing around your different elements around your different tags you can see that there's this kind of annoying gray spacing here and so we're definitely going to want to get rid of that we're also going to want to control how big the header is and how big these sections are so there's basically two ways you handle spacing in css there are two properties that you would have we'll go to the header here there is margin and there is padding and between those two you can add all the spacing that you need so margin is pretty simple and padding is the same as well let's just add 20 pixel margin margin excuse me around everything you can see that when i did that i got 20 pixels uh up here 20 pixels here 20 pixels there and 20 pixels there it didn't solve our problem but we will get to that in a moment but that's the easiest way to add something now if i change this to padding padding adds that spacing inside of your box so you can see my box went all the way to the edges but now i have 20 pixels of spacing here here here and i also have it over here you just can't tell because the text doesn't go that far so it's margin and it's padding and there's three ways that you can enter this let's go back to margin here so you can enter it with one value and one value applies it to all sides of your box you can also add two values if you add two values let's go 20 pixels and 40 pixels then this goes to top and bottom and this goes to left and right you can see top and bottom have this smaller 20 pixels and left and right have the 40 pixels and then you can also add four values which it works like a clock top right bottom and left so think at the clock you have the top of the clock and then you have the right of the clock and then you have the bottom of the clock and then you have the left of the clock so starts at the clock we have our 20 pixels 40 pixels 10 pixels and 50 pixels so those are the three ways you can enter it you can enter it with one value two values or four values you can enter it with three values as well but it's a little strange padding is the exact same way you can see that it just all changed to the inside of my box now 20 40 10 and 50. so padding works exactly like margin does you can use one value two values or four values so now to get rid of this little gray area here by default the body tag has margin and padding on it and that might actually be different among browsers so we want to make sure we specify that let's make sure the margin is zero and we're just going to say zero and the padding is also zero let's hit save and tadah we have solved our problem with those ugly edge borders no matter how much i stretch my web page out here it always goes all the way to the edge which is super nice excellent so that's one thing that we've solved and then another thing that's very important to note is these don't all have to be in pixels there's a lot of things called units in css this padding can be 20 pixels it could also be 20 percent which is 20 percent of whatever space we have you can see whoa 20 percent here is not very much because my window is not very wide so 20 to my window is just a little bit but 20 percent of the height of the window is a lot more uh so percentage is really interesting concept you can see as i get wider that 20 becomes a lot bigger so percentage is interesting it's it's a mixed bag you don't always want to use it there's about 10 different css units uh for now we're just going to stick to pixels it's the easiest way to start it's the easiest thing thing to think about because a pixel is just a dot on your screen so we've gotten that let's go ahead and add some padding here to the rest of our sections and we've got this video done let's go over here to the section let's add padding let's just add a padding of 20 pixels all around 20 pixels there and on the footer 20 pixels although that looks a little bit much on the footer let's add maybe 10 pixels and then 20 pixels so the top and bottom will be a little bit less but the left and right have that larger and i'm zoomed in here this is the actual size of my web page if i zoom out to 100 so i'm zoomed in so it looks a little bigger that's actually what our sections look like so that's your basic css layout stuff you've you've got your semantic tags and you've got your boxes and you're just going to add margin and padding to get them to lay out the way that you want to in the next video we'll deal with the navigation and we'll also deal with this little triple section here
