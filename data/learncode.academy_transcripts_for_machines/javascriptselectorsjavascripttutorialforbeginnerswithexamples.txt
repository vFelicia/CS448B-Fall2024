so in this lesson we're going to be taking lots of that fun JavaScript code we've been learning and we're going to have more fun by actually applying it to a real webpage I've got this kind of really basic web page here and we're going to be using javascript to real time make some changes to it so here's kind of some of the HTML elements that I have going on I've got a couple paragraph tags and h4 I have a UL with some allies so let's use JavaScript to real time change this page I'm going to go to my console I've got it pretty big and blown up because we're going to be doing this whole lesson in the console so the first thing to know about how you interact with your HTML document here is there's a document object on the page so you can see this is an actual JavaScript representation of my webpage it's called the Dom the document object model and that's basically how you access your HTML and CSS through JavaScript and so this document object model has an API force it has some API methods we can access I can go documents dot gets elements by tag name so you notice I did elements plural here because we can have more than one element with the same tag name and let's grab all of our paragraphs P and I just need to enter string in here can be single or double quotes I'm going to look for anything with a P tag and there you go I have an array of two elements I have my first paragraph tag in my second paragraph tag how about we look for anything with an h1 there you go there's my h1 so it gives me an array and so then I can actually do what we would do so let's look at my P I can go array 0 which is going to give me only the first one in the array or I can actually save these as a variable I can go there P tags equals documents that gets elements by tag name P there you go so now P tags the variable equals these two awesome and I can go first P tag equals P tags 0 so now my first P tag variable I can pass these around just like I can any other variables so now anytime I go first P tag it's always going to point to this pair graff sweet let's look at some of these other selector methods we got going on here so I got documents document dot get elements well you can actually just see them if you type get right there you've got get elements plural by class name and that would be LM and by there you go and that'll just be the class name you want I have a class name done that's this guy right here you see I have one li we've done you can get element singular by ID since there is only one element allowed with each ID I think this yeah this ul is called checklist there you go so that's that guy with ID of checklist and that's kind of pretty much it now if you are using anything ie 8 or newer definitely if you're using IE 9 or newer there's a great one called document dot query selector which is awesome because then you can just use any selector you want just as you would with CSS so I can go dot done anything with a class of done I can do a hash tag and look for anything with an ID hash tag checklist there we go and document query selector will always just give me the first thing that comes up it will not search the entire document oh just give me the first one it finds if I want everything then I go query selector all and then I'll just search for P tags and that will just give me any paragraph tags right there in NR a so those two are cool and you know I mentioned that you can't use this in all browsers one of the quirks to JavaScript just like CSS is newer browsers support newer features older browsers do not support them so there's a great website called can I use com you can see right here I typed in query selector and I can see what all browsers supports what I'm wanting to use the only one that has partial support here is IE 8 it's not going to work with css3 selectors because IE 8 does not support those and also html5 tags you know tags like main and footer you know might have some trouble with that so you'll always want to test your JavaScript code if you don't get a full green light on the browsers that you're supporting stinks I know and it's always ie that's a problem but hey what are you going to do that's the internet things change so there's basically your document searching methods so let's do some fun stuff here let's say I want to change the HTML for this paragraph did I call that first P tag yes so first P tag still points to this paragraph so now I can go first P tag dot enter HTML and I can actually change the inner HTML equals new paragraph now it's not really a new paragraph but new paragraph contents there you go if I could spell content in new paragraph content there goes so real time I just changed it let's say I want to actually add a new element inside of there a new paragraph strong content I can actually type text and it will turn it into HTML tags which is pretty cool I can also do stuff with classes so let's look at that li right there that's got done so let's call that very Li equals documents dots man I'm not typing document very well tonight you're just going to have to bear with me on that one document query selector I'm only going to do query selector because I just want the first one with a done class so there we go so Li now equals that guy so I can go li dot class name and there you go my class name is done so let's go class name equals nothing so now my class equals nothing I have no classes assigned and the strikethrough is gone so let's go li class name let's add done back there we go let's add a second class name to it done also done let's say I have another class called also done it didn't do anything because that there's no CSS for that let's say I want to set it back to just done let's say I want to take I have an amount of classes I don't know how many classes I have let's say class name is done also done also so let's say Li dot class name has a lot of classes I don't exactly know what all they are I just want to add a new one to it I can go Li class name let me go and clear this out here li class name equals Li dot class name so let's take let's say it equals what it already is plus let's add a space and add a new one special there we go so now it's going to say hey let's it now equals what we equaled before plus this more stuff so now that's my class list right there pretty cool well add a class name equals nothing all classes are gone again so that's that's pretty nice it's kind of a pain in the rear to do a lot of stuff with classes beyond that if you want to do a lot of adding removing classes like let's say I wanted to just remove also done let me actually copy and paste this and add this back in Li dot class name equals there you go let's say I just want to remove also done well there's kind of like some hacky ways you can do it I can go li dot class name equals Li class name dot replace let's say I want to replace also done with which is the second argument replace is kind of cool you can do do replace on anything that's text strings I'm going to replace this with nothing so there we go so now I have an extra space in there but that's still going to work in browsers it's kind of hacky and that it's not clean because then if I added another class and removed it ten times I get a whole lot of spaces in there but that's going to work and so if you want to do a lot more besides just a little bit of adding and changing you'll want to look into jQuery I've got a full jQuery course jQuery makes it really easy for you to do a lot of this stuff and I'll leave it at that I'll put some links for jQuery out there let's look at maybe one more thing let's go ahead and look at okay so there's this class loot there's this class class list thing you can see if I do class list I actually have a list of all my classes one two three it's an actual array now if I go to can I use and type class list it's kind of depressing it's not supported for ie8 or ie9 it's not fully supported with IE 10 or even IE 11 so that's coming classlist is going to be really cool because you can do stuff like classless add new so now i can look at li class list and it's got new super cool I can go class list remove let's take new away and now if I look at class list new is gone so better support is coming to JavaScript natively but if you want to do it in the meantime you're going to want to use a library if you're using jQuery it's super easy I would just do something like this I'd look up my class for done and I do add class new and that's how jQuery works I'll leave it for that I've got a whole series on jQuery which you'll love um and that's pretty much it there's you know that's how you'll select stuff that's how you'll add stuff you can also navigate up all let's look at that li again so I can go Li dot parent node parent element and element and that's going to be the UL that it's a part of so let's say if I want ul Li dot parent element dot parent element that's going to be going up the tree some more so now I'm at main and you can see main has the UL in it and that you will has the Li in it let's say I'm on this Li and I want to find then this guy right here well then I can go li dot parent element dot children there you go dot children and that's going to be all the children of my parent element now once again children's got a quirk to it it works safely ie 9 plus ie 8 back can have some quirks but that works really well so then I can go li parent element children zero and that's going to be that apples guy so let's say I want to change u equals what will you be Frank there you go so now Frank oranges bananas and watermelon so that's enough on selectors for now then the next video we're going to cover how you can actually listen to what the user does and change stuff real time so hope this lesson helped you out
