in this video we are going to use view directives uh to work with our data in a more powerful way view directives are very very powerful they're very much like angular directives if you're familiar with angular and they allow us to just in a quick line of code accomplish great things so let's go ahead and start by changing this friends list from an object full of objects to an array full of objects let's go and create friends let's make an array of our friends i'll start by just doing simple names so there we go we have an array of friends now i can get rid of this computed we don't need this anymore and so we can do here is we can loop through the friends array and spit out an h2 for each one of our friends so let's go ahead and do h2 and we can use the v4 directive this will allow us to do a for loop through our data so for each item in friends we're going to create a friend object so for friend in friends much like you do a javascript loop and we can now spit out the value of friend so you have it we have an h2 for each one of our friends and we're spinning out the entire value of friend let's go change this now to be a full object so let's change this to an array of objects and clean up a little mess there so now we have have an array of friends you notice it actually spits out the whole javascript object for each person oh great although that's not really what we need we want friend name actually there's no such thing as friend name friend first or in this case we could also do friend full name so it'll again we can use the filter on each object that works just fine here as well so that's the v4 directive let's also say we want to start changing friends names we want to be able to edit each friend's name so what i'll do here is i'll create their name in nh4 and let's create an input and let's actually say we want to edit their first name so v model is going to be the directive for this and we can see friend dot first and so v model means that it's automatically going to sync to that first name and when i make changes it's twoway data binding so if i change the y then automatically that got changed it got changed in my data and that triggered a rerender on anybody that was listening to that data so it's reactive to a reactive data binding there so i can say his name is now billy and i say john's name is johnny and so that's a really simple way to edit data that's one of the simple things that makes view easy to work with is that twoway data binding so let's also make a model for friend.last you see now that we can fully edit any one of their names now let's say we want to work on that person's age let's make an h5 for their age how could we change their age we can add some buttons to maybe bump it up and down so let's make a button here and what we can do is we can use the v on which will allow us to act on any user event so the user event we want is a click so we're going to do colon click so v on colon click equals and then we can have it do something we can say friend friend.h equals friend h plus one let's see if this works yep it works and then i can also make a minus button that will take their age down one we can change their age change their age back up change their age back down now while that's a very simple quick way to do it the better way of doing this is to move this logic out of the template logic in a template is generally speaking a bad idea you want to do this as little as possible so we can add a methods object now let's make a methods object and we can say increment age and this will receive a friend it's very important that we receive a friend not just a number because we can now go friend age equals friend h one so we can do now is on click we can say hey increment friend and now this will work so we are going to increment age pass it in our friend and then this will automatically bump the age up you can see up still works and down still works in the hacky way so let's go ahead change this to a decrement method now decrement age and that will be 1 so then this will be decrement age so now we're just essentially handing that method off there we're handling that logic out of the template and into a method there we are we're able to change our friends ages and we're able to change our friends names so that's how you work with data using methods and using directives in vue.js you
