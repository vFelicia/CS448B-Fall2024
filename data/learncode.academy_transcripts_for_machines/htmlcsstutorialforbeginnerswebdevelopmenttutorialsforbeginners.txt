in this video we are going to start learning css along with our html now if you got here and you haven't seen my last two videos about how to set up this professional web environment with a live reloading server you're going to want to watch those those are in the description so let's move forward here css again stands for cascading style sheets so i made this basic web page here but it has no style it's just all default text default layout and i am zoomed in so it looks very big and it's easy for you guys to read but we're going to want to add style to this right now and we can do that with two you guessed it tags because everything in html is a tag so there's two tags we can use to get css style on our page we can use a style tag which will add css right here in the html document right here in this index.html file and the other tag which we'll wait on for a little bit is the link tag the link tag allows us to move that css out of the html into its own file and what's good about that is then any html page can bring that file in so you can share all your styles across a bunch of different web pages and that's what we want to do almost all of the time but for now to keep it easy we're just going to add a style tag here so now anything inside of this tag is not html it's going to be css so we're going to get in here we're going to add what's called our first css rule a rule consists of three things a selector and then you're going to do what's called curly braces that's these funny little things right here which you're pretty much only using coding and then you have a property and you have a value and you can have a bunch of properties and values property two which there's no such thing as these by the way and give it another value and then each thing is separated by a colon between property and value and a semicolon that's probably the weirdest thing there when you're learning css is you're using these characters that you're not used to using all that often the curly braces and then the colon and semicolon so now that we know this is all css is selectors with properties and values we just have to know how to use them selectors are pretty easy just pick which element you want to target so this is called targeting as well i'm going to target every h1 on my page and i'm going to start changing properties with different values one property would be hey what color is that font right now it's by default black let's change that to red you can actually use named colors for popular colors and you can see when i hit save i now have a red h1 let's copy this and make our h2 a different color let's add another rule let's get a new selector here and let's change that from red and instead of typing color i can actually hover over it and actually use my color picker you can see i'm picking an rgb color now let's pick something a little bit more i don't know brown doesn't really matter let's go gray gray is nice i think there we go got gray hit save and now my h2 is grayed out so that's going to be how you add rules that's css right there in a nutshell selectors properties and values i can change several properties on here i can change the opacity to 0.5 and hit save and now it becomes a little transparent which just looks like a lighter gray but if i had a background image on this webpage then that would be slightly transparent so you can see i can add multiple rules there and that's how you do that in css so let's start changing some rules on our page here let's give our body a background color with background so the body doesn't actually have a color to it because there's no text it has a background property let's just go black so i can get a color picker here and then i'll make it like a dark trendy gray let's go ahead and say that's still a little too dark here let's change that a little bit more hover over that get my color picker there we go so that's my page let's make this a less menacing color than red how about something like a nice cheery blue there we go and then let's just make this a lighter color gray to stand out on that dark gray background there we go let's also give this thing a font because that font is killing me right now so let's go font and you can see oh wow css kind of helps me out here it gives me font family font display it helps me see all these different things i can just go font dash family and then i can go helvetica new look it even tells me hey it looks like you're doing this rule here that's kind of a popular rule ariel comma helvetica comma sansserif i'll show you what that means here ah that's looking much nicer so what i've done here on the font family is i've added multiple fonts because i don't know exactly what fonts the user's computer is going to have installed if i pick a font on my computer that doesn't guarantee everybody else is going to have it now these are some popular ones helvetica new helvetica those are mac fonts ariel is kind of the same version of that only not quite as good that windows machines pretty much all have and then sans serif so there's some ways you can get around the font problem which we'll get into in future videos and make sure that the font you want is available for every user but for now you pick a font family that you know is going to be popular on almost everybody's computer just please don't pick comic sans please do not ever pick comic sans so there we go i've made my font family and i'm going to zoom this back out that's actually what my web page looks like but it's pretty small on that screen so i'm going to zoom back in here and also i want my default color for my text to kind of be white because i don't want to have to change every paragraph in my whole web page so let's go color white there we go so now my default color is white let's go ahead and target that button and kind of change the background color of that button let's make that gray and you can see i've got my background color there and let's give it a border of none and now i have no border that's excellent and i also want to change the color on that as well too i don't know white so now you can see i'm kind of styling my web page i could also give this h1 a background color let's make this black so really dark black background for my h1 and that's kind of how we build the look and feel of a web page that's using css rules so from here i'm going to give you one piece of homework and then we're going to start building out an actual web page from here on out we're going to learn by building a complete website the homework is i want you to google because the number one skill you're going to learn as a web developer is how to google and find an answer on your own i want you to google and find out how to give this rounded corners with css i want you to find out how to make these corners rounded rectangle so go ahead do your homework find out what css rule it takes to make these corners rounded rectangles and let's start building out a whole website you
