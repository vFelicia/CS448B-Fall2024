in this video we are going to use view filters and computed data to work with our data even more so here we've been spitting out just plain information but let's say name was actually set as first last first is bobby and then same here for john we go i think i changed his last name but that's okay obviously our application will break now we don't have john.name anymore uh so instead of having to spit out john first space john last and bobby first space bobby last we could make a computed value here we can make an object and any of these will be computed values they will be treated just like data even though they are really a derivative of our data set so let's say bobby full name we can return this i'll use a template string for it so we have that's bobby's full name so now down here i can say bobby full name and then i can also create john full name and obviously this is more work than it would be to just create their name down here but computed values are very very useful in many other situations so john full name would be john's first and last name and now i can go john full name and i'm spitting out computed values i could also say john age in a year plus one so in one year johnny's going to be 36. now computed values are great in a lot of cases but in a lot of cases we can do this in a reusable fashion using filters so we can create a filters object here and we can just call this one full name and full name will get any value and it will return value.first space value dot last and so now what i can do is i can spit out the entire object john at a pipe and say full name and there you see we get the exact same results so now i can also go bobby full name and i can use that full name filter that exact same full name filter to return bobby's full name uh what's also great about this is let's say later on we decide now we want to return last comma first then that can apply to everybody in our list as well now boon john and boon comma bobby we do the exact same thing for age in one year so we return age in one so in this case we'll go age age in one year actually john.age bobby.age age in one year and so now this will bump up to that 36 and bobby just became 26 as well so that's how you can use filters to create reusable computed values and then computed values can also be used to just make computations that are oneoff computations against your data set you
