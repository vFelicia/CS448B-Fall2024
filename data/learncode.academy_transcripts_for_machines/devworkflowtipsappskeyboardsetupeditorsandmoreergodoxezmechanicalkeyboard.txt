hey in this video we are going to be talking about local development workflow how many you guys know if you code 8 hours a day the way you interact with your computer the utilities you use all the little things that make your development workflow enjoyable are important this is eight hours of every day of your working life so we're going to be talking about that some of the utility apps that I use along the way um a lot of you guys have asked me since I reviewed the ergod do easy keyboard and have mentioned that that's my keyboard of choice these days you've asked me for lot more details about my keyboard layup and how I do the layers I've got this beautiful brand new just released show snow and shine LED White Version I'll be showing you all the cool LED functions that this bad boy does and also how I set up the keys use my mouse at the same time through my keyboard and all that fun stuff so let's go a switch the camera angle around so you can see my keyboard and going back and forth between my screen at the same time this video is going to be a lot of fun let's get into it all right I'm going to get back to that beautiful keyboard here in just a second but let's start off with uh the first section of this video which is going to be software utilities that just help your Dev life uh there's pretty much three utilities that I'll install on any Mac right away that really help my worklow uh the first one is divvy which is a window manager app the other two good ones out there that would be I guess competition with divvy would be spectacle which is free for Mac uh and also magnet which is a newer one which is really cool as well so if you basically want to open a window you can have a hotkey that sends it to the left to the right full screen you can tap full screen again and it would go full screen to your other monitor if you have two monitors or you can send it to Any Corner if you want so I could go left corner right corner then I also have hot keys for 2/3 and hot keys for 1/3 display so that's kind of the hot keys that I have going on for divy and that simple window management utility is something that I tremendously Miss if I'm on a machine that does not have it the ability to just fire off hot keys and move your windows around is tremendously useful so that's the first thing I'm going to install on any machine just to make life happier uh the second thing I'm going to install is going to be iterm 2 which is a terminal replacement um I'm definitely definitely going to install a terminal replacement if for nothing other than a hotkey window it turn 2 is great because you can have a hotkey window no matter what application I'm in I can hit in my case I've assigned it to command backtick or on my ergodox EZ I have a dedicated key that I've just is a command back tick key um so no matter what application you're in you can automatically just pull up your all your different tabs keep all your terminal tabs right there for all the things you're doing and then hotkey it away that's something that once you get used to that again you absolutely never never never want to go back uh I'd say the third can't do without application would be Alfred Alfred just makes searching easy no matter where you are let's say photos whoops see mistyped so now I can search Amazon or Wikipedia or Google um but I can also go Photoshop photo booth uh the POC phone the ioto you can basically it goes through your contacts your applications you get to search Google Amazon whatever right there again anywhere you are on your computer with a hot key Alfred is super awesome so those are the three software utilities now let's get back to that keyboard again let me show you how I have the the keyboard configured to actually help my Dev workflow as well because this ergodox EZ keyboard is completely configurable and really helps life out so I'm going to go split screen here so here we are with this beautiful new ergod doxy Z keyboard again the new snow and shine version with the beautiful fully programmable LEDs I'm going to get into all the programming and the way that I use this um first of all I'll show you the pretty stuff you can change the Hue to be any color you want obviously lots of beautiful colors to choose from with LEDs change your brightness make it very subtle make it full brightness I always just leave it at full brightness and there's a lot of fun macros that it comes built in with so you can go through things that slowly fade in and Fade Out Of course let's make that a different Hue there you can make them go a little faster you can do things that pulse that are lots of them are very very slow very subtle the kind of thing you'd actually want during your workday um there's ones that slowly fade rainbows across slowly do Night Rider style effects all sorts of fun stuff basically all the things I was thinking I'd like to do come baked in uh so lots of fun effects you can do there and then you can also set up hot Keys just for some of your favorite colors let's go with a nice blue for now now I'll show you how I've got this keyboard programmed so the ergod do way is to use layers so your fingers don't move a whole lot they'll be right here got a little bit cluttered you'll have it right around here and then you toggle to layers to do different types of things so let's go ahead and pull up my computer screen now let's uh pull up some actual code so I'd say as far as familiarity goes took me about one month to get confident on this keyboard and that wasn't using it constantly I found the most efficient way to learn it was to go back and forth from a regular keyboard to this so I didn't get too frustrated um after that about a month to get confident two months to feel great to really love the keyboard three months to feel like a just Rockstar and now I can type as fast as I want I have no problems except for apparently uh typo Bard um I I have no problems typing full speed on this keyboard and you actually get a lot of great things with it so the layers concept is super cool I know if you noticed earlier but I was clicking my keys as I was using my mouse when I click here I go into layer one which I can either go temporary or leave it constantly on this is my programming layout which I'll put the link to my layout in the description uh these are temp layer one toggle layer one temp layer 2 toggle Layer Two so if I go to layer one then my they're not WD they're the esdf that controls my mouse and then over here I can change it to control my mouse slow or medium or fast which is default so this fast key is really kind of useless but if I want to you know slowly I'm getting close to a file go more medium I don't really use slow too much but I do use medium from time to time so that's very useful and then this is scroll we don't really have much to scroll with let's go create some junk here and I can scroll now these are my scroll Keys like my scroll wheel would be and I can also scroll left and right although there is no left and right scroll so I have Mouse scroll all my mouse actions are right there while it's not as powerful as a mouse it definitely gets the job done and allows me to not move back and forth throughout the day um also this hotkey right here is my arrow keys so let's do some more stuff here so if I go over here then I have my arrow keys so mouse keys arrow keys and I can move around all the way I need to move and then this right here is my coder lay layer so this is only a temporary I really never need to toggle the coder layer and that's what gives me basically all of my hot keys on this hand I have more this is more dedicated to hot Keys There's an actual another window so let's go hide Sublime Text uh pull up something here let's go new right left full these are my four quadrants and that's one3 or 23 and that's 1/3 so that's kind of what I use that for and then as far as my coder layer I tend to do that over here so let's say I'm doing a function I can hold this and now I have paren I have curly brackets and I have braces I also have my common coder things at equals the arrow then I also have back ticks right there so between that I can do a lot of cool things function just crank out a function really fast or if you're doing es6 a equals there we go so what I did there is const a equals which is on the blue layer space now I'm on this layer Arrow just did an arrow function right there and there so those keys once you get to know them a lot of cool stuff really easy to crank out code fast and fun also a lot of Sublime Text things uh I have a dedicated copy cut copy paste here so let's copy paste paste paste paste use my arrow keys here scroll up uh I have some Sublime Text hot Keys programmed in here so this will bump my selection down these two keys bump it up and down and these will actually move my lines up and down so that's a lot of fun let's move it back up there maybe bump my selection up one there we are that's really nice and easy to move stuff around so you can do a lot of fun things really fast with that and that's pretty much how this keyboard programmed it took me a while while to figure things out if you ever have a kind of custom programmable keyboard what I'd encourage you to do is take some time and think about the hot keys that are frustrating to you one thing that was frustrating to me was command tab because on a regular keyboard you're doing something like that yet I command tab all the time so I kept tab right here and I also made a shift tab right here so I can easily go back and forth since I'm doing that all day long um and I found that I didn't really need that extra space bar so then here's my space here's my backspace and here's my tab right there this is equals plus minus kind of my math Keys there's my equals plus minus and or times the common math keys that I use all the time um and between those I have a lot of fun a lot a lot a lot of fun using this keyboard now let me show you Visual Studio code here like I said I've been mentioning I've been playing with code a decent bit recently and I think I might be making a switch to Vis Visual Studio code one thing I love about Visual Studio code is it lints real time in a really great way let's make an error here you can see right there my linter is showing uh oh you doing something wrong here doing some problems I also have a terminal right here if I want to use my terminal in this project at all super nice what's cool about Visual Studio code is it gives you just enough to feel like an IDE but it's really a text editor at heart so it's a text editor that gives you a lot of good ide things so over here is my GitHub or my git stuff which is really nice uh you can easily see all your git changes let's go ahead and commit something there we go now let's go change something over here let's make some things there let's hit save and I should see my get changes here super nice and then I can click on it and you'll actually see your inline diffs which is really nice you'll see the red code you took away over here the green code you took away over there I can plus that okay now it's staged you can see that it's staged for commit so that's it's really nice the GitHub integration feels completely natural the es linting and the terminal right here although I don't really use the terminal that often uh the es linting real time and that git integration is just enough IDE to get the job done so I think I might be switching to visual studio code here soon uh we'll see time will tell I do like Sublime Text it is fast but anyway that's pretty much my Dev workflow I know I flew through quite a few things covered the keyboard covered my utilities that I like to use covered my text editors that I like to use but if you have any questions leave me in the comments below I'd love to answer them uh hope this helped you out and have yourself a great day
