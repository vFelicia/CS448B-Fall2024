this video is called help me i am stuck in wordpress world see this guy he's stuck and this is for developers that are stuck in a cms rut uh now there's a few things i should point out right away first of all you can substitute any cms for wordpress whenever i say wordpress here so that could be drupal craft cms and so on uh this video is really for developers who find themselves stuck in the dead zone of being proficient in a cms but they feel much less capable outside of one i personally was stuck here for at least five years earlier on in my career as a developer and i personally know many many dozens of developers who are stuck here right now so it is a very real place and secondly i have to mention that i'm not hating on wordpress drupal or any cms they're a very real technology they serve an important purpose many top notch companies need and use cms's the problem is many developers uh have the experience where they're learning web development and a cms helps them get very far very fast through templates and plugins but after a while developing any templates and plugins world they find themselves at a dead end there's something mentally about the way you approach a templates and plugins world that is different from the whole rest of the world of web development and they've been shielded from many aspects of that development world and they cannot break out of cms world so that's who this video is for it's designed to help you break into development arenas that cmss may have been shielding you from so how do i know if this is me um you know this is you if any or all of these apply to you one if you're comfortable creating sites in a cms but you're uncomfortable creating sites outside of wordpress or the cms of your choice then this video is for you uh also and or if you think in terms of hacking and tweaking instead of building so if you hack and tweak things as normal instead of build new things uh for an example hey we need a calendar so instant thought let's look for a calendar plugin i can tweak to fit my needs or instant thought let me find a template that looks like the website i need to build and tweak it to fit my needs so if you think in terms of hacking tweaking instead of building then this is for you also if you mostly or only know how to work with plugins you don't really know how to code stuff by yourself and that leads into if i asked you to build an application like pinterest facebook twitter without a cms you'd have no clue where to begin and lastly i guess if you don't actually know how a cms works behind the scenes and you really couldn't begin to build the cms that you use all the time then this is for you so if this is you do not feel bad just be aware that there is so much of the development world out there uh to know an experience that you haven't known and experienced yet and it's gonna be very good for you to break out of exclusively cms world and they the one exception i'd say is if you consider yourself if you consider yourself to be a designer a graphic designer who can also implement that into the web if your true passion is look and feel and you have no desire to learn development then intentionally stop at html css and and maybe lightweight javascript like jquery but that being said when i was stuck in cms world for those five years i would tell myself that it was because i was a designer but the truth was all i knew how to be was a designer i didn't know that i absolutely loved development because it kind of intimidated me and i had never learned it i was in a box and i never knew that i was and lots of developers are in this place as well so ah if you've determined this is me you're talking about me and one of those things what do i do first of all you need to make a mindset change you are a builder not a repurposer um it's kind of like the difference between people who go buy old dressers on craigslist and refinish them to make them look all trendy but they can never build a trendy dresser from scratch from raw materials and so that's kind of the mental difference is you need to learn how to work with the raw materials the raw lumber so to speak in the development world but instead of wood it's pieces of technology it's frameworks and servers and utilities and stuff like that it's not as intimidating as it might sound and it is far more fulfilling to build something from raw materials than to repurpose something else that somebody else built they're both fun but building is definitely in my opinion drastically more fun so you're gonna change your mindset and then the big piece is is you're going to learn an application development skill set now there's a few different skill sets that you can choose from uh so you get to pick one pick a road any road as you can see from the picture here they all lead to the beach you're they're all going to take you forward so don't sweat this decision too much but pick a skill set you can be front and developer full stack developer or backend specialty developer and like i said all roads kind of lead to advancing yourself and technology there's overlap there's blend you're not going to get pigeon holed into one thing you can easily cross between these as you move forward as a developer so keep that in mind have fun pick the one that seems like the most fun to you in general if you're leftbrained uh you know you like intense data and math go more backend in in general if you're more rightbrained creative go more frontend or fullstack but those are general generalizations very broad sweeping brushes you don't have to hold yourself to those rules so if you're going the frontend developer skill set these are kind of the list of what you need to do first you need to learn how to build a responsive html css layout in page from scratch now this is kind of a core competency of a frontend web developer and it's funny lots of people can actually build sites in wordpress for a decade and not know how to do this so if that's you the first core competency you have to develop is how to build html css layouts and pages from scratch lots of people do know how to do that that are wordpress developers but many many people don't as well uh secondly you got to learn a javascript framework you're going to build clientside applications not just little widgets not just little jquery plugins you're going to build applications with a framework um i'd recommend just go for react i think react is something you cannot go wrong with these days if you're not going to go with react go with angular or view view is the simplest of the three so if you find react in angular very intimidating and difficult kick it off with view and then move into something else angular is also very popular but in general i think react is the best for the way it will make you think as a developer i think it will teach you very good habits very good mental approaches towards how to build applications so layouts learn a framework and then pretty much learn how to consume backend apis you don't have to know how to build backends but you do have to know how to work with them how to get data so you can use services like endless or firebase i have a very stripped down free thing called rest.learncode.academy which is just a server that resets its information every day but you can kind of play around with a fake back end on there and it's again completely free and then lastly you need to learn how to set up which is a the fancy word for that is provision a static site web server and get your code on there so you know how do you get a static site web server you can google how to provision static site web server with digitalocean or with your service of choice um so you get a choice there i'll put a code in the description for some free money on digitalocean ten dollars or twenty dollars for free i forget exactly what the value is but you can actually mess around with servers for free um and again that's a referral link i get free credit if you use that but i never use that credit anyway so feel free not to use it so if you want to go full stack developer skill set here's kind of what that word looks like you actually begin with everything from front end so front end is kind of a good place to start plus you're going to shoot to hey can i install a database locally and on a production server you can't go wrong with my sequel and or mongodb those are two good players to go with these days there are some trendier newer databases but mysql and mongodb are hands down the most popular two so those are good choices to go with and then you're going to learn how to build a backend application for your front end application so full stack developers tend to build say a single page react app and then the api that that app consumes that tends to be where a full stack developer stops so you're you're building the database and you're exposing an api to your frontend application uh so that way your frontend application can read and write to that database and that's usually about where full stack developers tend to stop and then you know the ability to deploy that application to production so how to deploy node.js application to production is a good thing to search on google and then what technologies and languages um if you're saying just tell me a good one go with node.js with the framework being express js you can't go wrong with that now if you're really comfortable with php because almost all these cmss are rphb start off with lumen and then go laravel since lumen is is much simpler lightweight it's much more like express js laramel laravel is very full featured but honestly even if you know php and you're up for a challenge go with node.js it's simple it's javascript and you really cannot go wrong with it these days it's an awesome piece of technology so there's your second skill set and your third skill set back in developer skill set you will learn everything from full stack but not the front end portion so you'll learn how to set up a database you'll learn how to consume information from that database you'll learn how to expose an api that frontend applications can use but you will never build those frontend applications and then you will learn how to scale an app as traffic grows which sounds complicated but it's not really that bad you'll use a load balancer like nginx or h a proxy either one of those are great picks and you'll learn how to backup and restore the database of your choice that's not really too hard they're made to be backed up and restored optionally you can learn how to scale those databases to handle large amounts of traffic and then how do you continuously test and deploy an application so when you push to github tests run on your code and when you merge to master or merge to a specific branch then it automatically goes out into production servers this is you don't have to learn this to start backend but it's definitely a part of the backend developer skill set some companies out there offering continuous integration tools or codechip circle ci travis ci all very good companies and they also want to learn how to deploy with docker these days that's also something that a developer should strive to have in their skill set as a backend developer and then how do you provision servers with code this is a little more advanced backend developer skill set but using what's called configuration management tools how do you get servers set up using code that you wrote in advance so you can essentially use that code over and over again to create 10 identical servers in production you don't have to do it manually that's a a very good thing it's worth doing it's worth spending the time on so there's your skill sets uh to go for i'm gonna give you a quote you owe it to yourself to know more than just a cms that's for me i'm giving you that quote hopefully this helps you out if you found yourself stuck in that world that i was stuck in hopefully this gives you not just the motivation incentive but a road map to get out of there and start experiencing much more of this broad and enjoyable world of web development and that is all thank you so much have a great day and keep on coding
