let's learn Bower today a lot of you guys have heard about Bower it is a package manager for the web if you know what package managers are you're like yes this is great that it's here if you don't know what package managers are uh you're going to learn what that is and what the value of that is and why everybody's buzzing about it so let's do p Let's uh just get into it I'll show you what this is about first off you'll need no JS installed on your machine if that's not installed uh here's how you know as you type node DV I have version 10 0.10.1 two if that's if you don't see that then go ahead to nodejs.org get it installed once that's there then you can go npm install DG bow so that is going to globally install bower for me so now it isn't executable anywhere on my system um there you go Bower is now installed and ready to be used so go to the folder where your project is which is in sandbox test for me and let's just go ahead and say we want to add jQuery to our page we go bow install jQuery and that's going to go grab the latest greatest version to jQuery and you can see I got in finder here you can see it added a b components folder added jQuery and added uh distribution version for that right there as well as the Full Source um and this is Sublime same package up here so now if I go Bower list it says that it jQuery is installed in the Bower component folder if I go b list paths with double dashes then it will show me the path to the one I'm going to want to use by default so now I can just go here there you go jQuery is on my page bow is super great for that let's say I also want to add backbone bow install backbone it's going to automatically grab backbone backbone has a dependency of underscore so it's also going to grab underscorejs yes for me and now if I do Bower list paths I've got my one for underscore got my one for backbone and I could just add those all here so that's the first awesome thing about Bower is it just gives you a really easy way to install dependencies and this wouldn't have been a complete pain in the rear but I have had to download the zip file unzip the zip file put it where I want it to go and this is just way better um and so that's Step One is using just to install stuff just using it to download stuff on your page if you want to get by the way a let me uninstall jQuery um if you want to install a specific version you know lots of people don't want to use J gree 2.0 if you're supporting Legacy browsers jqu just did pound what is that 1.9.2 I could probably grab that there you go jorey 1.9.2 grab that specific version let's let's make sure that's what's in there and oh we got an error there available versions 1.9.1 okay there we go and see was even nice enough to know dummy there is no 1.9.2 out there right now and so same thing let's go list paths and sometimes it doesn't have the path in there power component SL jQuery got to pick your own yourself here so there you go jQuery jQuery and there's just no dist path so sometimes it doesn't have the path in there for you depending on how they added Bower so that's step one of bower use it to download and install JavaScript files let's go to step two this is honestly where I think B becomes even more useful is let's say we're working on this project and we're not the only On's working on this project it's kind of a bad idea a bad pattern to check in this code into your G repository um as the web keeps growing and growing and everything becomes interdependent on it on each other uh a good pattern is to only checking code that has to do with your project specifically so we don't want this to be in the repo we just want a package file that says hey install these things for us so we're going to go Bower and knit and start making that package file by default it's going to start throwing in these things I'm just going to say yes to everything there we go just keep saying yes yes yes I'm just going to I'm just going to do all the defaults and say yes and it's going to make a power. Json file for me here's all the values I put in I can change them now if I want um and here's the dependencies that were currently installed at the point of me creating this init file and so now what I can do is I can actually I'll have a get ignore line for the bower components folder so Bower components will not be included in my get repository just these two files and so now whenever anybody else pulls the repo down they just go bow install and that's going to grab all their dependencies so it's kind of like a common thing you download the folder you run Bower install and now your folders your project is good to be used and so we've we've cleaned it out we've kept all these dependencies out we know it's going to automatically load the specific version that our uh our product is built for as the versions keep incrementing we're only going to get a new version if we intentionally choose to go 2.0 2.0 um and so that's kind of where the package management concept comes in for Bower another thing you can do is you can install say you have a large Network and you have internal company repos of projects and pieces of code you can install those using B you can go B install um and then a GitHub repo URL say if you have a local installation of GitHub Enterprise uh or if you just have private GitHub repos as long as you have access it'll use your GitHub SSH keys and you can install any GitHub URL as long as everyone else on your project will have access to that repo added in here as well so it gives you a way to break up your project into meaningful chunks and components uh and each one just can use a bower package to do it all and this doesn't just go for JavaScript I can go Bower install bootstrap and this will give me all the CSS files um and actually now that we have a bower Json file you notice I added bootstrap but it didn't get added to the bower.json that's a mistake that people commonly make a lot is you have to hit flag capital S if you want it to save to your actual B Json file and see now you'll notice that it reloaded bootstrap is saved if I go B our list paths it gives me multiple paths for bootstrap because M bootstrap has the Javascript file it's got the CSS file and it's also got all the glyph icon fonts so yay there we are that's Bower hope you enjoyed learning about it have a great day
