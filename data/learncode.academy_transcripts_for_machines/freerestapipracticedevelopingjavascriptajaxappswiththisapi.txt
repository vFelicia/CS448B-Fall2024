you know a lot of people who are learning JavaScript run into a block in their learning curve when they want to start developing Ajax applications but they're not on a team uh that has Ajax backend apis that they can use or maybe they're learn you're learning at home um and you don't have access to anything that gives you the ability to start doing that I thought about that over the weekend a lot and so I put together a free restful API that you guys can learn uh use to learn Ajax on your own so yay for you guys you get to do that now um I had a lot of people who went through the jQuery tutorial where we do cover how to build a single page app and you guys asked me hey what can I do I don't have access to an API so here you go no excuses now you have access to an API this should give you all the code you need to do it anyway uh but I'll give you the miniature like twominute walkthr basically um the data resets every night so it's not going to last forever that's kind of my way of making sure I don't have this gigantic server full of pointless data um and it's not secure anybody can guess your username and access all the data you post so it's just for learning um and then here's kind of how you use it if you just go rest. Learn code. Academy uh go API and then pick a username in this case will and then friends you have access to all the friends that you've created of course if it's the first time you did it say Willis then that that collection will be empty it will be created the second you try to uh access or post to uh username Willis collection friends so I can have Willis friends I can have Willis tweets and there you go empty collections uh so then you can just snatch the code and post to that collection let me snatch this open the console or you guys can do it from your web application let's post to Willis friends I'm going to add my friend let's go ahead and reload that there you go now I have a friend called Billy Bob let's go a and run that a few more times of course I don't have jQuery on this page so I can't do that let's ah where am I there you go let's post that exact same thing like three more times I just ran it and just kind of reran it so now if I refresh Willis friends I have three friends with different IDs so now I can modify those with a put request I can delete those with a delete request let's do this delete Willis friends id1 let's go and delete you let's go check again now I have three friends let's refresh and I have two friends now id2 and ID3 so yippe there you guys go that is your API enjoy it let me know if you run into any problems and also if you build anything cool with it comment below I'd love to see what you guys are building as you're learning Ajax have a good day
