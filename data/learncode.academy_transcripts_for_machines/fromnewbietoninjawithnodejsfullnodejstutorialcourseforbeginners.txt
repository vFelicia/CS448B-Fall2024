Learn code. Academy it's on sale there now and it's 50% off these first three days for all of my subscribers I want to give you guys a great deal this course is 30 videos I've basically taken my five years of day in day out experience coding node.js and I've determined what the core competencies of a node.js developer are say that five times fast core competencies of a node.js developer so by the time you're done with this course you're going to have everything it takes to be a node.js developer not just know random bits and pieces about node.js so who is this video for if you're going to purchase a course you want to know what for you first and foremost it's designed for people who are new to backend if you've been doing front end your whole life um and backend is a little mysterious or terrifying and you're looking for the correct onramp this is the ideal course for you with each video I made sure to stop and think how would this feel if I was new to backend what terminologies would be new what things might be intimidating and I want to make sure I explain them well for someone who's new to backend if you're experienced in backend you'll feel right at home along the way and I won't dumb anything down but for anyone that's new it's going to be a really nice onramp into backend Technologies and building backend applications second it's going to be really good for people with PHP only backend experience while PHP can mean a lot of things if you've done mostly cms's working maybe with open Source shopping carts and just hacking things around and you can make backend work but you don't really feel like a true backend engineer this is going to be a really good course for you because the way OJs runs as a constant running service puts it alongside of many many other backend applications basically if you learn node.js you're going to get the concepts of many other web Technologies in a way you wouldn't get if you have PHP only backend experience also if you're just new to node.js if you're a backend developer and you want to learn node.js this again will give you those core competencies in a really quick way really the only thing you need to know is some JavaScript you don't even have to be a JavaScript ninja um and I'll put some links to some of my free playlists in the description below you basically need to know the basics of JavaScript uh maybe watch my JavaScript is weird and awesome course maybe know about modular JavaScript and promises and you'll be good to go so what will you learn in this course we're going to cover six main areas we're going to cover the node.js basics and all the things that took me a long time to discover about those Basics along the way even some things that I just learned over the last year that have always been there and then we're also going to learn expressjs which is hands down the most popular web application framework for node.js we're going to learn all its ins and outs and how simple it is to put together a powerful application then we're going to move on to databases connecting to mySQL getting and setting data and also how to manage those databases in a great production environment like setting up database fixtures so your team can work completely offline with their own database on their machine and handling your production database with migrations some great things which will be really especially if you're new to backend then we're going to move into authentication and authorization that tricky piece of how do I do a username password login and know that it's secure ooth to login so you can log in with your Google ID or with your GitHub ID um and then authorization and private data and making sure things stay secure then we're going to move into redis so that way you can manage your sessions and caching and reddis is just a really cool uniquely usable database and then we're also going to cover deployment how you provision those production servers and get that application out to production basically like I said it's going to be everything it takes to get you rolling with no.
