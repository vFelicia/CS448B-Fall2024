all right this is lesson number two about learning JavaScript if you missed lesson number one you might want to watch it the Link's in the footer or I'll put an annotation on here somewhere we're just going to keep moving forward so we are now into a super basic website have it up over here um and it's going to automatically reload as I enter stuff um you might have to tab over and hit reload what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to create a script tag and whenever I add a script tag by default that's going to be JavaScript straight in my page and so I'm going to go alert you'll notice Sublime gives me cool nice new colors that's very nice so now if I hit save oh my page reloads and hit hi there every time I reload my page it's going to say hi there so we're using the exact same code that you can use here in the console and we're now just putting it in the page I can also do console log hi there so that's kind of the the use of console log is is it's a way to kind of debug when stuff's breaking and you don't know what's going on you can spit stuff out to your console and your normal user doesn't see it uh but you can open your console and see there your notes to yourself as to what kind of stuff is going on so that's kind of how you do JavaScript right there on your page and let's go ahead and load up what's called jQuery if you go to jquery.com jQuery is what's called a library and it gives you some great ways to uh do stuff very very easily and actually we're going to go to code. jquery.com because we just want to get the actual code and you can click on minified and there we go I just want the link right there I'm going to copy the link and right down here and the bottom of my page now we'll just go and add script and Source equals and then paste that link you got there awesome so now jQuery is going to load in onto my page hit refresh you don't notice anything because jQuery doesn't actually do anything it just gives you a bunch of predefined variables remember we talked about variables and commands uh kind of gives you a bunch of predefined things that you can use so here I'm going to make my own script after jQuery because we want to make sure we're doing this after jQuery uh otherwise jQuery won't be loaded yet and uh now you can do some things like jQuery sign is the dollar sign this is basically the main function you get I can go jQuery do I can go jQuery and I'm going to look for the tag of header and these are just like CSS selectors that's the beauty of jQuery I'm going to go header H1 HTML and I'm going to change the HTML of header H1 once again this looks just like CSS doesn't it that's why everybody loves jQuery um and I'm going to go my awesome site I'm going to hit save you'll notice it starts off at my site and then instantly goes B my awesome site so now we are real time changing stuff in jQuery which is or or in using JavaScript let's go ahead and do this I'm going to go UL Li I'm going to go same thing milk eggs and I'll just leave that there so UL I made that a UI didn't I whoops UL Li let's try doing something else let's go um UL that'll just find an element just like CSS again and I'm going to do append append means we're going to add another thing in there uh veggies and I'm just going to put some straight HTML code in in there so UL it's now going to add an Li to my UL with veggies so there you go milk eggs and now veggies is in there even though it's not in the code I'm going to copy and paste this now we got a lot of veggies so you can add a whole lot of things this is kind of where the web like I said really starts getting fun because now you're changing your web page real time I can also come over here this will be a lot more fun let's do it like this let's do it in the console nice and so then I can go I'm going to go let's clean this thing out UL HTML let's just give it a single Li when you hit HTML it's going to completely it's going to completely wipe out what's in there and it's going to give it all new stuff so there we go now I completely wiped out my HTML um or you can and I added An Li in there so now we're really time starting to mess with our stuff um instead of a pend let's say I wanted to add something before milk then you can do this you prepend now eggs showed up before milk because a prepend is basically going to do it at the very beginning of my element upend is going to go at the very end um gosh there's some other things and the other great thing about jQuery is it just all makes sense if I go ulli and just hit enter down here then you'll notice it gives me an array of all my elements I can go ulli EQ and this is going to get an it's going to get an index so eq0 so I'm just getting the zero index of that if you guys remember from doing JavaScript eq1 is milk so I can go lq1 remove and it's gone then I can go lq0 remove and it's gone so that's kind of the super basics of how you're going to use jQuery to start changing all sorts of stuff in your website Let's uh let's add a link and let's make a link do something smart um I'm going to make this hrf equal pound because we're not going to go anywhere with this this is just going to be a link actually I'll just do a button um this button will be ID add one so there's a button that says add one it does absolutely nothing so now what you can do with Jer though is you can go let's grab add one I'm going to go do click and this is the one thing you'll have to remember here function and then this syntax just feels really weird so you're doing click and then you're typing function open close brackets uh this is probably one of the weirder things if you're brand new it's like oh man this looks crazy and confusing you just memorize it and then you're done with it so type it out 10 times in a row to force yourself to memorize it and you're going to be okay now whatever you add in here is going to happen whenever the function whenever it gets clicked so whenever I click on add one it's going to do all this fun stuff so if that makes sense um and then I'm going to space it so it's clear so now when I click this it's actually going to add a whole lot of veggies let me just do it where it does it once so now every time I do this it's going to add a row of veggies don't know why I did that sound uh let's make this get even smarter if I'm not going too fast for you I'd rather go too fast so you feel like you're drowning and then all of a sudden you wake up and realize wow I know quite a bit of JavaScript already you can always rewatch the video so I'm going to do an input which is a let me give this one an ID you'll see what an input is here soon name I'll just call it ID equals name so that's what an input is it's you've seen them in forms all over the place they allow you to input stuff we didn't talk about them before cuz we didn't have JavaScript to do anything smart with them so I had an input named name with an ID of name and the button add one so when add one clicks let's do this let's go we're going to go there Val U equals V andv gets the value of name it'll get the value of any input so here let me do this watch um I'm delete this and then I'm going to go alert value so now let me type in whatever here ah alert test so now I've grabbed my value out of name remember because my ID is name here so whenever I click on add one then it's going to say value equals name's value and I'm going to alert it or if you want you can console log it now it's going to appear in my console so that's kind of how that's going to work so I've I've grabbed my value out and now I'm going to go UL append and here's where where I'm going to do a string let me show you real quick about so I want to go Li and I want the value to be in here and this will not work this will just say value value value great it's actually putting a string of value I want it to get that in there let me come over here and show you how you insert different strings together um if I go name Plus value well now it says name value so I can actually go name space plus value and that's kind of how you can add two strings together into one what happens if I go name plus 20 so now I'm adding a string plus a number JavaScript is smart enough to say okay treat the number as a string because clearly you can't add name to 20 so that's kind of how you add stuff together so I'm going to do Li and then I'm going to go plus and I'm going to go and ending Li so I've got a string we're going to add in the string we're going to add it to our other string so now let's give this guy try so now I go veggies and I get add one ha boom I feel like we're doing real programming here this is awesome and let's pick pick up some friends at the store cuz who wants to go shopping with friends I do I do that's kind of your very very very very basics of using jQuery I don't know if you can see but jQuery kind of makes it pretty easy this is the most complicated bit of jargon we had to memorize that actually feels like code function open close what the heck does that do um and yeah I'll get into functions here before I let you go for today let's go back to our console real quick let's say jQuery is all good and all let's describe this so you understand what that means I'm going to actually we know that we can disc we can do variable name equals 30 uh age equals 30 and now name's defined so I going to name equals will so I want to do a function that alerts both of these or I want I want to do something that's reusable those are called functions when we do alert that's just a function that does something so I can go function alert name and remember I told you there's about six types in JavaScript well here's your next type it's called function alert name and that's you notice that looks pretty similar function alert name and this is going to go alert name so now I just go alert name there you go and it's always going to alert the name name let's say I want it to do something a little smarter than that plus let's call this alert name Plus Age let me add a space there there you go now this is going to alert name Plus Age so now I go alert oh it already knows that it exists will 30 so now I'm kind of defining this thing that does something for me um and so that's what's going on here is when you the actual official JavaScript click is that but then it needs to know what do I do when you click I need to do something so we're creating what's called an anonymous function we're creating a function right now with no name to it I mean you can give it a name um add value you can use the exact same thing we were using here function alert name ad value and that's what we're doing we're just creating a function we saying do this stuff right now this name is completely pointless because you're never going to call it again um but this works there you go and then this works U so that's kind of a little explanation of why we added that we're creating a function and we're giving it some functionality one other thing and this is the last thing since you've got a lot to learn and you probably want to go have some fun last thing with functions that you can do is you can give them arguments remember if you do alert what just going to do a blank alert and then you can give it something to alert you can give it your argument of 30 or I can say name age equals 30 yeah I can give it an argument how do we do that well you just go function I'll just go alert this + 10 and then I'll say I'm giving in a variable name here I want you to give me I'm just going to call it the thing and then we're just going to go alert the thing plus 10 so now whatever we pass it is going to be referenced as the thing whenever we're inside the function this is going to kind of be what bends your brain a little bit show you how this works alert this + 10 and I'm going to just say 10 or 20 it's going to alert 30 why is it doing that because I said alert this plus 10 and I gave it 20 so now the function fires the function alert this plus 10 fires and it calls the thing equals 20 it kind of creates that variable for us so then it's going to alert 20 + 10 because we gave it 20 and called it the thing you can call that whatever you want I'll call it V for Value Val is kind of something developers will say a lot so I can go V plus 10 now I say alert this plus 1020 yeah exact same thing it doesn't care what you call this um it just knows that whatever the first thing you give it is going to be called Val you can actually do several things together add these together V one vow two alert Val one plus Val two that's what it's going to do and what did I type wrong oh I didn't spell function right there we go verion okay so now if I go add these together there we go I still get 30 10 30 now I got 40 because it doesn't it doesn't care what those two things are this function just goes take Val one take Val two add them together and alert them so that's kind of functions and I'm definitely going to leave you there because I hit you with way too much this should have been two lessons but oh well please forgive me have some fun with jQuery write a couple functions annoy your friends with a million alerts and have an awesome day
