okay so on our last tutorial we started off uh with an introduction to bootstrap Twitter bootstrap I would highly encourage you to use bootstrap from now on start getting comfortable with it because you will write very few CSS rules and you'll be able to create very great stable stuff websites all over the world huge scale web sites are using Twitter bootstrap um and check the link if you did not catch that tutorial one thing you'll notice is this is not working yet that is because I accidentally forgot jQuery you'll notice I grabbed on bootstrap's website I grabbed these three things two CSS and one JavaScript uh but what I forgot is that bootstrap uses jQuery so if you scroll down to basic template you'll see that they include jQuery here so I'm going to copy that and put the jQuery script in my thing as well now you notice everything's working beautifully my drop down works so that's what it looks like on on a mobile and if you expand it out here's what it looks like on a regular website looks very nice and there we go so now I'm going to go ahead and move forward with a little bit more CSS stuff so back to basic CSS Maybe for One More lesson and then we'll move on and be done uh say we wanted to create one of these ourselves cuz even when you're using bootstrap every once in a while you've got to make something custom and it's really good to know some CSS moving forward so let's say I want to recreate one of these kind of widgets here let's say instead of calling it panel I'm going to call it my panel let's go div let's go header and we'll call it class body We'll add a single paragraph in here so right now completely unstyled seems to be normal let's go and open my main CSS I've already created three rules here my panel and heading so let's go ahead and give my panel a margin you can see I did a little bit of my homework beforehand 3% so that way it's always going to be within 3% of either Edge and let's give the heading a color this is some of this is going to be a little bit repeat for you so so give it we'll give it black for now just so we can see where we're sitting did I call it header yep called it header heading and one thing you'll notice is is I did my panel space heading one thing that people do accidentally all the time is they'll do my panel do heading and what that is going to look for is something that has the class my panel and the class heading this is the same as that because it's looking for something with both classes so you'll notice right now this selector is not selecting anything if I did my panel and added a class of heading now I've added two classes you'll notice it starts picking up on the entire panel now just in case you run into that and wonder what's going on and why your codee's not working you probably forgot a space there anytime you add a space it goes to the next level and is looking for a child of this guy so I obviously don't want black so let's look into kind of doing the a Color Picker to pick a color we want I'm just going to go to Google and I'm going to type in online Color Picker there we go there we go online Color Picker let's pick a color let's say a nice greenish sure that works I'm going to copy that and you'll notice it gave me the pound hex value so I'm going to do that paste it in hey we have kind of a normal looking color there that's kind of where you're going to do do a lot of your color picking from if you don't use Photoshop let's go ahead you'll notice this is snug up against the edges so I'm going to add some padding to this I'm noticing my padding here is a little bit less on the top and bottom and more on the left so I'm going to try maybe 10 pixels top bottom 20 pixels left right yep looks pretty good and then I'm noticing there's actually kind of a darker color for the text so I'm going to go back to my Color Picker I'm going to try to darken this guy up a little bit and see if that could be a good text color for me yeah looks kind of good a little bit lighter but no worries I'm also going to make the border that same color one pixel solid when you're defining borders you go with your width first first then your style and then your color I could go I Believe I Can Go dotted pretty much solid is what you're going to use all the time yeah there's dotted I think I can go dashed there's a bunch of them out there you'll need to search for them yeah dashed usually you're just going to use solid one pixel solid there you go that's looking nice and then I'm also going to add a border radius which is a different Rule and that's going to be the curved Corners let's try 10 pixels that's a little too much go five pixels border radius works like everything else I can give it five pixels five pixels 0 0 and that'll give me five pixels top bottom zero on the left and the right if I just kind of want that one corner I can go zero pixels you notice it'll Lop off this guy so I just kind of have that one corner right there um and I'll just go five pixels for all of them one thing you'll notice a lot of times too is you'll notice webkit border radius and what it is is older browsers used to not officially support this border radius tag because it's pretty new so these this is called a vendor prefix this is any browser using webkit which would be Chrome or Safari or pretty much any mobile phone older phones will need to add that Milla Firefox uses the mo VI pixels and so lots of times if you want to make it fully compliant with older browsers you'll do these things you'll do these three you go border radius webkit border radius Mo border radius um and then if you happen to be sporting older Opera oh border radius it's kind of annoying we're pretty much on the verge of being out of these things but it's still not a bad idea to add in the vendor prefixes for now I'll just keep them out just for cleanness you also notice I'm I'm trying to kind of keep it in alphabetical order here it's not a rule that you have to do that but it's a good idea keeps things clean uh one thing I'm noticing is I do not want a border radius on the bottom of my header so I'm going to go five picks zero actually I think I might need to go yep that is not going to do what I want it to do five pixels five pixels 0 0 so that way it's on the top and the bottom and I want this border to actually apply wh want this border to apply to the entire panel which is what's going on up here there we go that's looking a little better and I want this border radius you notice my this has a uh border radius but I want the panel to have a border radius as well there we go looking better now this has the Border radius you see if I take this off then it's square and then the Border below it is square and you'll get a couple weird little pixels there so I'm keeping the Border radius on both of them let's move on to the body if I can type my panel body let's give it padding let's try the same 10 pixels 20 pixels there you go looking good and I actually want this to have a 5 pixel border radius everywhere there we go we basically created this panel uh let's look into a couple other things you know what I'm noticing is it looks like there might be an Ever So slight Shadow on these panels so I'm going to go ahead and add this it's called box Shadow and box Shadow has four values it has your offset uh your X offset y offset your blur and then your color it's kind of how that works is let's start with a 10 pix pix 10 pixel Z pixel blur and just black to make it clear what's going on you'll notice it's 10 pixels this way 10 pixels down and it's not blurred at all and it's black so if I make this blur 10 pixels you notice it's starts getting fuzzy now and so with these guys it looks like they don't have any offset at all this it's kind of like just a allinclusive Shadow this is probably a lot smaller like four pixels and this is not black it's it's a very light color maybe like a 999 yeah you can barely see it now looks like that might be maybe even lighter CCC is a lighter color I have a few of these colors memorized there you go so it's got that ever so slight gray shadow that these other ones seem to have so that's kind of how we're going to do a box Shadow on this entire panel let's say we wanted to give this I'm going to copy and paste this a few times let's say we wanted to create three of these and whenever we hovered over one we wanted a delete button to appear what I'm going to do here is I'm going to add a div and this class will be show on Hover and then in here I'm going to add a bootstrap button think it's button danger is a red one delete there we go so that's there it'll always be there for now let me go and add that to my other two yeah it's actually a little big I want it to be button XS button extra small there you go let's go and add this to each one of these so now they each have a delete button and I'm going to go uh I'll make it show whenever you hover over my panel so here's how I'm going to do that my panel show on Hover is going to be display none so they are not going to appear at all and then what I'm going to do is my panel hover so now these rules will only apply whenever you're hovering over my panel my panel show on Hover display back to inline block which is what it was before so now whenever I hover over a panel that appears nice so now it feels like your page is doing some really smart stuff really all we're doing is we're hiding it and we're showing it whenever you hover over this panel at all H kind of nifty you know what else I could do is I could go my panel hover I could make this box Shadow get a little bigger when you hover over it this kind of just some ideas of things that you can do maybe I'll make it like eight pixels and I will make it a more apparent Shadow there you go now whenever you hover over it see that shadow is just a little bit more to show you what I mean I'll make it full black a little too much for design sake but whenever you hover over it kind of gives it a little pop now I could even make the Border a little bit larger maybe like a two pixel border there you go now it really kind of has some pop whenever you hover over it see it jumps a little bit because the Border has now made it a few pixels larger now it's got an extra pixel on top because that borders two pixels extra pixel on the bottom so you notice it kind of the guys below it do this little jump down thing so ideally I'd probably adjust some margins there on this hover thing so let me see maybe that'd be 1% 3% see if I can compensate for that oh you know what is that delete button showing up okay so that's automatically going to be larger that's supposed to be happening that's what's going on there we'll leave it so that's kind of a little bit more intermediate CSS and before I wrap up this lesson um I'll get into kind of a few more selectors and I'll talk a little bit about specificity and cascading stuff so let's go and just clear all this out save that let me clear all this out and I'm just you know I'll just create a complete Blank Slate here before I wrap up this lesson on CSS I'm going to go and create an H1 hello world so I'm going to in my stylesheet I'm going to go H1 color red now H1s are going to be red H1s should be red not exactly sure what's going on there oh probably because bootstrap has an H1 let's make it a class H1 bootstrap has a whole bunch of rules in it and so that's where all my colors are coming from from bootstrap already oh no what's going on here let's just make it a paragraph one of the things you run into sometimes with using something like bootstrap is it's doing a whole bunch of stuff and you don't exactly know what it's doing and so sometimes you can get frustrated trying to do things so definitely there's some downsides let me make it really large 400% okay there we go kind of ran into an is issue that I'm actually going to demonstrate here so now paragraphs have a color of red anything that comes after will overwrite if it's the same level of specificity so if it's as specific so I'm going to go color blue now you'll notice even though I've defined a color red P's will have color blue because it came after the fact now if I went P class um primary and this had a class of primary now it became righted again because this is a more specific rule than this this just applies to paragraphs this applies to paragraphs with a class of primary now if I went P ID of main green so now if I have an ID on here ID just got even more specific and now it's green so you'll see that that's kind of even though they came before IDs are more specific than uh classes and classes are more specific than just elements and so that's kind of how that works you notice even if I take away the P an ID is more specific than both of these however if I go primary matching by ID or matching by tag name and by class name is considered more specific than matching by class name so this sets it to Green this overwrites it to red and then this doesn't do anything this makes it all paragraph tags are now would be blue for any just standard paragraph tags so that's kind of how specificity works is if I were to also go primary other if this said p. primary is red I'll do it like this p. primary is red p. primary. other is green now so if I make it class primary and other well now that's considered even more specific it matches on three levels it matches on a tag level on a class level and on a secondary class level or an additional class level so this is now the most specific rule that applies to my paragraph tag here so it will be green so that's kind of how that goes if you're including it all in a stylesheet now let's look into doing something else let me copy main CSS and let me save this as other CSS and I'm going to include other CSS after main CSS here other main CSS other CSS so now we have two things we're including in let's make main CSS just have PS be a color of blue let's have other CSS beps with a color of red now my paragraph is red kind of what happens is is it goes main loads up all the main rules and then loads up all the other rules and it's no different than if they were stacked on top of each other so main color blue then it loads in other color red that's no different than if you did this blue red what we've done is we've split them up into separate style sheets which sometimes makes sense if you start getting a really big style sheet makes a lot of sense to split them up into groupings so it's a lot easier to find out where your file where your rules go let's move on and so now let's add a style here this is a page level stylesheet I'm just adding a style tag straight in here I'm going to go P color green now paragraphs have a color of green you'll notice if I put this before my link the paragraphs now have a color of red because this happens before loads up these Styles then it goes to here then it goes to here so they get overwritten by what's here on the page um page page level stylesheet not really that great of an idea I wouldn't recommend doing it because then you have to copy and paste rules all over the place another third way you can do it is you can actually add inline style here on any tag can I do pink I think I can do pink I don't know let's try purple I don't think I can style color green oh I didn't spell it right style color green there you go now it's green this will always override anything that has been passed up and above in here so element level style is considered more specific than something coming from a style sheet this is a really bad idea unless you're doing it dynamically with JavaScript on the fly as they're doing things the only way to really change an element Real Time with JavaScript is by adding things to the element itself but in general it's a really bad idea to add styling straight to a tag anyway that probably concludes for this lesson about all you need to know i' say go out there have fun Google stuff if you want to know how to make something say look italics I'm not going to tell you because one thing you have to learn as a web developer is to get really good at Googling just type CSS italics and you'll find it type CSS underline you'll find it type CSS pretty much anything and you'll find it online uh but this is enough to get you going hope it helps and have an excellent day
