hey so all this month we're rolling out beginner coding videos that are really going to help encourage new people to get into coding whether you're in high school college or if you're 35 you're looking for a better career maybe a better way to take care of your family and also encouraging people in the meantime you do code to level up learn a new technology and enjoy the learning curve and the pain of learning that new technology to give you guys a little bit of extra encouragement and incentive I will be giving away a beautiful dot keyboard ultimate for yes I reached out to the awesome people adopt keyboard because I have long since loved and admired their beautiful mechanical keyboards I said hey would you provide one so I can give way to coders to encourage them to code and they said yeah that's a paraphrase this is something like that and so anyway this is a dot keyboard ultimate 4 as you notice there's no key cap inscriptions why would I give this one away well let me tell you the story how Das Keyboard came into being the owner and founder actually created a blank keyboard for himself because he wanted to type better he got it within a few weeks that he was typing double the speed so then all his friends wanted one I mean dot keyboard was born so if you're a web developer you're in development and you don't touch type meaning typed by sense of feel and knowledge of where the keys are you really should be touch typing I mean this is your career this is what you do or if you're learning this is what you want to do you should learn how to touch type it's not that hard to do and honestly getting a keyboard like this will get you there a lot faster and honestly the ultimate four looks amazing while you can get a dot keyboard with all the letters on there I specifically said give me the without the letters it looks cooler and it will be more beneficial to whoever wins this it's also cheering MX switches which are arguably the best switches you can have so that way if you're in an office setting its clicky but it's quiet it's about it allows a normal keyboard listen to that one of the reasons this keyboard specifically the dock keyboard ultimate is so quiet is this is aluminum not plastic it's beautiful anodized aluminum which actually makes it feel and sound very different from a keyboard encased in cheap plastic housing it feels well listened to it I mean that that's quiet and it feels better that's one of the things I love about DAF keyboard their quality is really really good and honestly for a cherry MX blue keyboard or a Cherry MX you know blue or brown this is brown you're not going to find a better price point really this is 169 that's about as good as you get while you might be able to find cheaper guaranteed it's going to be cheaper construction along with it so that's pretty much it dot keyboard ultimate for for one of you lucky winners how do I enter you subscribe you thumbs up you comment I will be randomly selecting from the comments somebody who will win this beautiful keyboard and if you don't win I'm so sorry go ahead check out Das Keyboard calm as well they have a great lineup of keyboard super cool stuff super cool stuff coming and have yourselves an awesome day good luck learn coding keep coding level up enjoy your coding lives to me
