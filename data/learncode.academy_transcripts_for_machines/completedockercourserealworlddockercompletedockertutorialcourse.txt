hey everybody i have huge news for you see that rocket ship going to saturn yeah that's how big this news really is uh docker is seriously awesome it's my favorite most preferred way to package and deploy applications of any kind if you've been following me on twitter you know that i really really like docker and you're like dude i've been hearing that i'm like yeah you have because it's right it's really true so i've been working on a way to help you get past the docker basics there are so many hello world application tutorials out there with docker but it's hard to find good information to get you past those basics so i've been making a course called real world docker see how that flew in that was really cool so i'm going to do it twice awesome and that guy there with the pen in the paper that illustrates that i've been working really hard on this course because i have it's a lot more work to put together a full course than to throw together a couple hello world tutorials so i've been doing it with o'reilly media they're awesome they put out great stuff they're those animal book people yeah they really like animals i think that's a goat or maybe it's a yak i'm not really sure it might be a male sheep but anyway they love their animals and they put out great web content if you're familiar with them again the course is called real world docker we've recently released it and it's going to be super cool it's going to take you from feeling scared confused and alone from only knowing those docker basics that you see on those hello world tutorials to not feeling so scared so confused and so alone to get that confidence to actually deploy a docker application into production and then it's going to get you to the point of wow bring on the millions of users because i just scaled this application to handle massive traffic load and you get lots of code that's right lots of code any code that we use in any of the examples you get to take home and copy and paste and mess with and hack it's all yours so what will you actually learn well you're going to learn docker deployments everything from really simple single monolithic applications with continuous deployment that means you merge it to the master branch and it goes out to production merge it to the staging branch and it's on staging you're also going to learn how to break that app up into microservices which can scale much better in a large scenario and you're going to learn some of the deployment strategies that huge companies like netflix use when they're deploying services across a large infrastructure you're also going to learn networking and service discovery so you can swarm multiple servers together to act like one deployment platform then you can run apps on any one of those servers and everything just talks together just fine and you'll also learn immutable and disposable infrastructure which basically means you don't fix servers and apps when things go wrong you just destroy them and replace them and with continuous deployment you actually do it all the time it's a great way of deploying your application infrastructure you're thinking wow that's cool you're right that's actually my next slide it's so cool thank you for bringing that up so again it's called real world docker the link is in the description and also you can go to o'reilly.com and search for real world docker it's also available on safari books if your company provides you with a safari books membership and so go check it out you're going to love the course it's going to help you out a ton and i give you information on how to contact me so i'm available to help you out if you have any issues with that course enjoy and have a great day
