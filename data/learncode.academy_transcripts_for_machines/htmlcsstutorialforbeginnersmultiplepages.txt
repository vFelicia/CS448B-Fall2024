in this video we are going to take our web page layout that we've been building and we're going to turn it into multiple pages we're going to have a home page a locations page and a contact page also if you've missed any of the previous videos the link is in the description so the first thing we want to do is we want to go over to our tab page here and we have our index.html which is the correct name for your home page and then what we want to do is we want to save this copy it to multiple different pages so i'm going to do file save as which as you can see is command shift s let's save as contact dot html now we have a second page i can command shift s and say locations.html now i have my three pages now again the only name that really matters is index.html these can be whatever you want as long as you remember their name also important you need to remember if it's capital c for contact or lowercase c it's called case sensitive you have to know what all those names are exactly the letters that make up your file name a lot of people get hung up there so now let's go ahead and turn these pieces of text into links to make a link you do an a tag why it's not a link tag i have no idea it's always been an a tag and the word inside of that is going to be the text that gets shown as a link so then you add an attribute to the a tag uh called href which is hyperlink reference and then you pick which file you want that to go to which is index.html we just made a link to index.html whoops like looks like i got an extra little character there got it and so now you can see that it turns purple because i've been there before and i can click on it and it takes me home which is where i already am so that's not very useful let's change this to say home there we go so now let's go ahead and add an a tag for locations a and let's call locations and again this is where the file name comes in handy or it comes in important is you call this whatever file you want it to go to so locations.html so now my locations has turned into a link and i can click on it it says title because i haven't changed that and then i can hit the back arrow so i'm good i can go back and forth between my two pages now let's do the last one of contact contact.html and we'll paste it in there so now i have three links going to my three pages yep the contact one works as well so now i can just copy this code click here shift click there and hit command c to copy now i can go to contact and i can paste all this in here get my links and i can go to locations and do the same thing get my links while i'm at it locations contact now i can go to all my pages locations contacts home every single page knows how to link back to every single other page excellent so you actually have a couple options here for how you want to lay out your folder this works great for a couple pages but if you had a website with 150 pages you wouldn't want to see them all down here you'd want to create folders so let's create a folder here and call it pages now i have a folder called pages let's start moving stuff in there yes i want to move it locations do you want to move it sure i want to move it so now if i go to index.html let's go back to our home here and i click on locations it says hey i can't get locations.html that's because it doesn't exist this link is automatically going to look for the file in the same directory that my current page is so i'm in i'm on index.html which is right here and it's going to look for locations.html and not find it so we want to look in the pages directory so that's pretty simple we just tell it pages slash locations.html and there we go now this link will work again tada we can get back to locations and you notice if i'm in the locations page and click on home ah i can't get pages slash index.html because i'm on the locations page and i clicked for index.html and that doesn't exist in my folder so if you want to look up a folder level you have to do dot dot slash that means hey look in the folder above mine so if i'm in pages right here and i do dot slash then it's going to go up a level which is right here so that's kind of your way of looking navigating all the different folders you could have a folder inside of pages called pages artists and then artists that start with the letter w this is if you had just hundreds and hundreds of pages and it would automatically look in the pages folder and then for another folder in there called artists and then another folder in that folder called w and then a file called locations.html so you can do a lot of different things you can make this website as big as you want to make it and then also on locations.html i could look up a level so let's say i was in that w folder i could go up a level to artists and then up a level two pages and then up a level back to the beginning where my index.html will be if that makes sense so let's go ahead and do dot dot slash for index.html and now if i'm on locations i can go home whoops let's refresh i forgot to refresh there we go now i can go home and i get there so i'm at home go into pages locations.html and go to dot dot slash index.html and that all works so for just three pages eh i'm gonna leave it all here i'm to drag them all back here i'm going to get rid of the pages folder but that is very important that you know how to do that in code because it messes up a lot of new coders so i'm going to get rid of all my changes that i made here and locations.html does not need the dot dot anymore there we go so that's our website it's set up but we do have one small problem here is that every single page has a copy of all our css styles so if i change something here what am i on let's go to index and if i change this to be pink because everyone loves pink then i go to locations oh no locations is red now so there's a lot of styles you want to share across your whole website like how your navigation looks how your footer looks what the background color is for your page so we're going to want to get this into what's called an external style sheet to do an external style sheet you just i'm going to right click here and do new file and you can call it whatever you want styles.css you usually want to end it with css normal names that people use are styles or stylesheet or main.css those are kind of some of the names that people will use and let me go up here and grab all my css but i don't want that tag because this is not going to be an html page i just want the css styles and then i can get rid of that style tag so i'm going to go ahead and save that now we have no style at all i'm going to paste all of that into the styles.css now all i have to do is bring styles.css into all three of my pages i do that by going to the head into the head i go link i'm going to add a link tag i'm going to link and hit tab and look it automatically took care of some stuff for me rel equals style sheet that's very important and then the href is going to be styles.css and there you go you can see that we automatically have our styles pulled into our page so with this one tag we can add css styles to any page that we want i don't want to cut it i want to copy it let's copy it there let's go to contact.html get rid of all this style and paste in my link tag hit save and now contacts should have my pink styles excellent now let's also go to locations same thing style sheet style css now whichever page i go to has my styles what's great about this is now i can change that color from anything let's make it blue and now all my pages automatically have the blue styles that have caught so this is how you want to manage the styles on your web page you can also create multiple style sheets you can make one for the navigation one for the footer you can make a bunch of different css files and put the css in there and import all of them so you can have multiple links here you can have 10 links if you want although in general you want to have fewer fewer is usually better so that's how you set up your website to scale to grow to a lot of pages with css in the next video we're going to look at how we target things because again we've got this problem where this div is going to automatically affect every single div on our whole website so we are going to want to look at css targeting next that's really going to set us up to build out the rest of our website easily you
