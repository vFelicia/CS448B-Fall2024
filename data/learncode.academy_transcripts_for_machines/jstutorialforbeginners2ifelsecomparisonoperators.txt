so in our first JavaScript lesson we learned about variables and we learned about the first two types which is the number and string and there's really only six or eight types in JavaScript depending on how you look at it so they're not going to go on and on forever but before we get into the next types I want to show you some extra programming tips or some extra ways that you can build programs with the types that you already know let's say that my user's age is 16 years old and I want to write a program to where if they're less than 16 it's going to alert that they can't drive if they're older than 16 uh it's going to alert that they can drive how would I do that uh we're going to do that with an if statement so I'm going to do if and I'm going to open and close my parentheses again and I'm going to open and close my curly braces now for this I'm going to want to do multiple lines so you're going to want to hold control or shift depending on if you're on Mac or Windows and then it's going to allow us to do multiple lines of code here and it won't run until we hit enter so I can go if age is less than remember that sign for math class I'll show I'll talk about it more in a minute alerts you canot drive so this is a less than symbol it's called a comparison operator um and basically because the little side points over here if the age is little than 16 or if it's less than 16 then we are going to do what is ever in between these curly braces basically if the question we asking here is true then we're going to do what's between the curly braces if it's not true we're going to ignore what's in between the curly braces so right now my age is 16 and I've said if age is less than 16 then alert I cannot drive it didn't do anything at all because my age is 16 or greater so if I change age to 15 and run it again I hit the up Arrow a couple times uh one great thing about the console is your up and down arrows will give you all your history so I hit the up a couple times and hit enter now it says I cannot drive because my AG is changed to 15 let's look at some more comparison operators real quick I'm going to pull that up again uh there's the less than and then there's greater than so this would be if age is greater than 16 and then I can also add an equals to either of those and this means is it greater than or equal to 16 so greater than 16 would be 17 and up greater than equal would be 16 and up less L than would be 15 and under less than an equal would be 16 or under so 16 is also included in the group I can also do two equals for is exactly 16 and then I can also do not equal for is not 16 so if your age is not 16 you canot drive doesn't make any sense but that's kind of how you do that I will put these in the description because you you might forget them and you might want to remember them so if your age is let's go back to our program if your age is less than 16 alert you cannot drive let's say I want to say alert you can't drive this is going to be a little Rabbit Trail but it's important to notice uh there's a problem with this code because I'm opening up my string here with a single quote and then I'm ending it here but I'm actually not ending it here I'm ending it here so that's actually going to give an error this will not work and so what if you want to add a single quote inside of or an apostrophe inside of a string we have two choices you can either go to double quotes here and so now that's going to work um or what you can do is you can do what's called escaping it with a backslash The Back The Backs slash in a string says whatever the next character is don't treat it as code treat it as a string character so this will work now it's going to be y u space c n apostrophe T Dr so let's hit that and you'll see it says you can't drive with an apostrophe and so that's called escaping that's important uh to know I know it's kind of a rabbit Trail kind of off the beaten path of where we're going but that's important so let's go if age is less than 16 alert you can't drive if age is greater than 16 alert you can drive and an exclamation cuz driving is fun there's a problem with our program though is what if the user is 16 so if it's less than 16 it'll do this if they're older than 16 like 17 then it'll do that but what if they're exactly 16 well let's fix that by going less greater than equal so now if you're 16 or older you can drive so now our program will always alert something let's change my age to 17 you also notice I didn't do V anymore that's CU I've already defined the variable of age you only have to do V the first time a equal 17 and let's run our program again it says you can drive now let's change our age to 16 and make sure that our program works age 16 yep you can drive too let's go one more step further with our program and what you can actually do is you can make this go else let's clean this up a little bit what you can do instead of if if is you can do what called an if else statement I can say if age is less than 16 do this else we're going to do this so basically if you're not younger than 16 we're going to do what's in here every single time so this program will do the exact same thing you can also do an if else an else if statement so what that would do is you can add another condition you can do another set of comparison operations in here so if the age is less than 16 do this else if age is exactly 16 you can drive finally else which would mean if they're older than 16 alert you've probably been driving already and you'll notice once again I have to escape that because that's not allowed I would have been closing this off with y apostrophe and this would have just been bad code so now if our age is less than 16 we're going to do this else if our age is exactly 16 we're going to do this and if it's anything besides that we're going to alert that you've probably been driving already and so my age currently is 16 you can drive finally let's change our age to 15 run our program you can't drive let's change our age to 17 you've probably been driving already and let's do something let's change our age to 16.5 what do you think it's going to do I changed it to 16 .5 well it's going to do else because it's not exactly 16 it's greater than 16 you've probably been driving already and it's true just not for very long so please keep driving safely so that is if else statements so now go ahead and write maybe another program where you prompt you get something from a user and do something fun with it so have a great day and enjoy
