we've been learning web development from the very beginning and if you've missed any of the other videos i'm putting a link to the full playlist in the description below so in this video we're going to cover css selectors so here's a css rule and it consists of three parts the selector which says hey what elements on the page are we actually going to be changing and then you pick some properties on those elements and you change the property values that's a css rule all we've done so far is use selectors that target elements by tag name so this applies to every body tag on the page every ul on the page every li on the page but this will run into problems and i'll show you why let's say we have two sections here and we want to do a layout i'll do a really quick flexbox layouts sections get display flex the default flex direction is going to be row i'm fine with that let's go section divs they're going to get a background of gray a width of 100 percent let's go ahead and save that yeah looking pretty good let's give them a margin of 1 pixel here so that way we can kind of see the delineation between the sections okay this works great uh until i want to make these bottom ones red well how do i make these bottom ones red if i change this to red then they all become red every div inside of a section on the whole page becomes red so what i have to do is i actually have to target only the divs that are down here so we do that with css classes but before i jump into classes let me show you just a little bit more about basic selector rules and how that works so we've added a space here and whenever we add a space it says hey let's look inside of what's to the left of it so that space means let's look for divs inside of sections you can keep going here you can say divs inside of divs that are inside of sections or ul ally a this would be any a that's inside of an li that's inside of a ul that's inside of a div that's in a div that's in a section it's a pretty complex rule but you can go as long as you want you can also do a comma and say this is going to apply to more than one selector but let's say we also want them to apply to any a tag on the page so there we go now we have a tags on the page uh they're also getting the gray background uh and any section divs on the page also get the gray background so you can do commas you can do as many commas as you want we can make this apply to the body as well now the whole body gets a background color you get a background color you get a background color so that's kind of how the commas work spaces and commas that's your basic selector rules is you can add spaces to say look inside and you can add commas to say oh we're going to do this as well so let's look back to the class problem what you can do down here is you can add classes to your html class equals and then anything inside of here is a class let's give this class let's call it a feature box you can't use spaces in your class names because whenever you use a space you're giving it a second class as well so this will be this will have two classes feature box and we'll call the sales you can add it you can add it before you can add it sales here sales space feature box or feature box space sales it does not matter whenever you add a space you're adding a second class and you'll see what that means here in just a moment let's give this one here a class this will also be a feature box but this one will be closeouts so we have two feature boxes our sales feature box and our closeouts feature box and now we can target them so we can say uh let's go up here uh section dot feature box so this is any section with a feature box class inside of it doesn't matter if the feature box class is second or first if it has a feature box class it's going to get this rule uh and then also you can say any section feature box div gets these rules so nothing changed because we're still targeting this section and this section but now we can do here is feature box dot sales we're going to only target sections that have the class feature box and the class sales you'll notice i did not add spaces here space would say let's look inside of section for any element with a class of feature box and sales we don't want that we want only section elements with a class of feature box and sales we want these dots to apply to the section element so we connect them to it so now you notice that only the first one caught those rules all of them up here every section feature box is display flex but only the ones that are feature box sales get that background color so now i can kind of copy and paste and let's say feature box closeouts they're going to get a background color of red and boom we've solved our problem another thing though is we've actually copied some code there's this rule in web development dry dry don't repeat yourself you'll hear people say i need to dry this code up that means that we're copying and pasting some things here that we have to maintain what if we want to change this margin to two pixels well now we have to find every place where we set our margin to one pixel and we have to change it that's not good we need to draw this code up to dry this code up it's pretty simple let's just say every dot feature box div every dot feature box div will get these two rules boom and then only the sales divs and the closeouts divs get the rule the colors specified so that's going to do the exact same thing but it's drier now if i want to change the margin to 2 pixels i only do it in one place and while it's not a big deal right here it's so easy to get your code copied to where this little margin one pixel is in a hundred different places of your website you don't know where it is another way we can clean this up is we no longer have to specify section here because dot feature box does it all there's not any other places on our website that are going to have dot feature box in them unless we want them to be a feature box so we can get rid of the section and look our code kind of reads a little easier now too feature boxes get display flex any divs inside of feature boxes get this kind of layout and specific feature boxes have different background colors that's how you target with classes classes you can have as many of any of them on a page as you want the other way that you can target is with ids ids get id equals um and we could give it something let's call it frank an id frank you target that by saying pound frank so anything with id frank let's give it a font size a 200 percent font size uh the problem with ids is you can only have one of this id on the entire page doesn't matter if you add another id frank down here that is illegal html it might work fine yep you can see google chrome actually handles it okay but you don't know what you're gonna get on different browsers and different devices because that's technically illegal html uh so ids usually you can get by by doing class names you don't really have to do ids stay away from unless you find a really good reason why you need to do ids but classes pretty much will always get the job done just fine so that's how you use class names to specify certain things again you can use comma and do a whole bunch of other specific things we want feature box closeouts to be read ah we also want i don't know nonfeature box is that a thing probably not nonfeature box dot closeouts to be read basically anything closeout divs we want them to be read so you can add commas and target multiple things on your page i'll leave you with one more thing there's there's a decent bit more that you'll learn ongoing with css selectors you don't have to know it all now to become a web developer so one more thing that i will show you is that the web page provides you things that are called pseudo classes pseudo which means kind of pretend classes so pseudo classes this one would get a pseudo class of first child this would get a pseudo class of last child first child means that if this is a parent element the first element in there is a first child that's this li right here and the last one inside of that parent element is a last child so i could target all first child lis which is just this home one and give it a special background color i do that by doing a colon colon means i'm looking for pseudo class there are some pseudo classes provided let's give this one a background color of red boom you can see my first child got a background of red if i change this to last child then i last child got a background of red where this is useful is when i want to do some things like hey let's uh give these things a background color let's give them all a background color of gray let's give them rounded corners so now they're doing that oh well 10 pixels that's huge what on earth was i thinking let's try three pixels let's give them some padding uh let's go and give them some spacing margin left of 20 pixels they're kind of spread out a little bit ah but i don't want this first child to be bumped over and that's where first child comes in first child will have a margin left of zero and now it bumps over and i've got the spacing carried out this is like the ugliest navigation of all time thank you very much i'll be here all week but it gets the point across sometimes you only want to mess with the first child in your layout in order to keep your layout looking the way that you desire so first child is out there there's also ones that are active active this is if your link is active right now so if i'm on the home page i can make this home page not be underlined i could say a colon active that's going to get text decoration none of course that's not going to happen because i'm not on the home page right now i'm on one called test.html um i could say a hover this is a really fun one hover gets a text decoration of none so whenever i hover over a link it gets a text decoration that goes away although usually you want to do something that's the opposite you want to say a text decoration is none and whenever you hover it gets underline so now all the text decorations go away and when i hover ooh they get an underlying thing going on nice or i could say that any li hover gets a background color of red so whenever i hover over one of these the background color flips to red so that's how you get some fun little useful interaction using pseudo classes that the html page provides for you i'll leave you with this for now like i said there's plenty more that you can learn ongoing but these are the ones that give you a lot of ammunition to build out the rest of your page in the next video we're going to go back to the web page we've been building and add images and wrap it up and really make it look nice and lovely because you guys have already learned quite a bit about html and css let's have fun with that video you
