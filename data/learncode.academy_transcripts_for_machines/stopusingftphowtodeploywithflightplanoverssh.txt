so if you are using FTP to as a way of getting your files into production for a website uh say you cyberduck or something you drag your files in there's a much better way I know I recently did a video where I showed you how to sign up for hosting from host skater and I showed you how to use FTP to get the files over but that's really an entrylevel way of getting in if you learn just a couple more things you can do this in a much more stable Much More Much More trustworthy and an easier much faster way uh there's absolutely no reason this should take this long uh just to put a few files online when you make changes so we're going to stop this and close this yes please stop get out of here uh let's go do this in a much better way uh so what you're going to need I have a gist here that I will put the link to online and we're just going to step right through it so you can see how easy this is couple prerequisites let's make sure you install node.js from nodejs.org now let's make sure you have git on your machine uh or GitHub as it's often called and uh make sure you get that on your computer and then let's move forward so you're going to open up your terminal and you're going to run this command npm install dasg the G is important the first time Flight Plan the g means we're going to install it globally which means we're actually going to have access to the fly command now I can say fly there's no target specified but fly is on my machine and then you're going to get into your folder that your project is in which is Wills awesom site.com for me and then I'm just going to run no I'm not going to run Will's awesome site I'm going to run npm install Flight Plan without the G and that's going to actually install it into my project so now you can see if I go to my project I have node modules and flight plan is in there so that's great next up if your project is not currently a git repository you don't really have to know what that means but you're going to need to run these three commands in your project and and that's get in it let me uh clean this up here for you get in it there you go now I'm my project is a get repository get add a capital A and get commit DM and then in quotes you're going to do a commit message first commit there you go now all my files are in a GitHub repository the only prerequisite to using flight plan is you have to keep your files in a GitHub repository so now we're going to create our flight plan .js file let me copy this new file paste it in save it as flight plan. JS there we go now I have flight plan. JS the only thing you're going to want to change is your host to be your website and your username to be whatever your HostGator or whatever login is now one of the reasons I recommend HostGator they allow you to ssh in that's something your host has to allow you to do in order to do this kind of deployment um they Rec this is for host skater right here when host skater allows you to ssh in you have to do it to Port 2222 lots of web hosts don't allow you to ssh in at all some require you to use a different port so that's something you're going to need to know if you're not using HostGator and that's it I've called this target production which means if I hit fly production it's going to copy all my files to production okay so that's it I've saved it and let's test it out let's just go fly production copying them all it's going to ask for my password and there you go it did it you're like no way there's no way it was that easy oh really well let's check it out let's go to index.html and instead of learn code being really rocks it's really rocks fly production ask for my password there you go and let's refresh our website learn code Rel rocks no way way why was that so fast because this uses rsync and rsync only pushes the files that changed uh which is really nice refresh there you go learn code now it just really rocks so there you are that's how to do great deployments using flight plan for any kind of websites and if that if you want to make it if that password gets really annoying for you I have an SSH video that will show you how to set up passwordless SSH so you don't need to type that every time so your computer is authorized to do that to the server without a password hope you enjoyed this video have a great day
