hey you guys I just had to take a quick detour from the coding videos to show you guys a intro to GitHub adom text editor which I just got my Beta invite to a few days ago so this isn't even publicly released yet but I wanted to kind of give you guys some insight on how great this editor is I am thoroughly impressed after the last few days and honestly once a couple little bugs get fixed that are already in the works on getting fixed I will be switching to this as my primary editor cuz it is awesome uh you guys probably know I'm historically a huge Sublime Text guy I swear by it um and if you like subblime text you're just going to fall in love with Adam is my my guess so we'll just kind of show you around so you'll notice right away feels really at home with Sublime Text um the tabbing even just feels really really subliming which is great to me I feel right at home one of the great things right out of the box you'll notice is some colors here it's automatically built in with a get differ so you're going to notice these are orange cuz I made a change to my main.js uh so it's really great and you'll also notice that any folders that are get ignored are grayed out anything that's in the get ignore file is applied to the colors and the themes can make use of that information so those are two big wins for me right off because those are really nice to have um I can do Apple shift p and do all commands just like you can in Sublime love that they give you the hot keys there I can do Apple p and I can automatically search for any file and that's super nice and then Apple p uh just like Sublime Text will give you your most recent history at the top as well or any open files uh so you can use apple P to hot switch back and forth between your most recent files uh if you just hit Apple p and then enter so that's really cool uh what are some other great features most of the hot keys that you're going to be using in Sublime are going to work like apple D to uh automatically do multiple cursors uh so I've got some multiple cursors selected here by hitting Apple d a few times you probably can't see that let me see if I can get you a better uh let's see padding will probably work padding Apple d a couple times and now I can go margin so that's nice for multiple cursors um really most anything so far you'll notice the diffs are right there flagged super nice um most anything that you can do in Sublime you can do with Adam let's look at the preferences real quick um automatically has package manager built in really great the packages are built in coffee script items built on noes so this is going to be a really easy Text Editor to hack and build packages for I can't wait to start building uh some packages for this um also your themes here a really cool feature is you can theme the UI so if you guys are weird and like your light UI you can do that and feel all cool and then you can also do dark if you uh for whatever reason you're like me so let's install a Dracula theme Dracula there we go Dracula theme let's get that guy installed H installed and now we're rocking with Dracula so super easy to work with let's look at one of the coolest features of atom is that it gives you some command line tools so so any folder you're in I'll go ahead and close this out don't save anything I can just go add them and it's going to automatically open up the folder that I was in one of the bugs there in the process of fixing is that when you do it this way you're not going to see your get diving uh but that is already a bug request and they're working on that you can also go Adam grunt file and that's just going to open the file you're in super cool you can give it several different flags you can tell it to open in the foreground if you go Adam help you can see that you can open it in a new window you can uh log output you can run development mode super cool another thing they give you is the APM command which is your Adam package package manager I can go APM list I can see all the default packages and I can also see any user packages which is my Dracula theme so I can uninstall that Dracula theme I can probably do APM search monokai too yep there you go so I can install this theme from here so really gives you some cool features out of the box um you can add the atom command for Sublime I use Su uh for the exact same features so it's not stuff that you absolutely can't get with Sublime these aren't features you can't add into Sublime but really out of the box they just give them all to you which I am loving so there's your first take on Adam editor really liking it I uninstalled my Dracula theme so that's not working now um but out of the box I'm saying way to go GitHub this editor is cool and I am hands down a fan have a great day you guys
