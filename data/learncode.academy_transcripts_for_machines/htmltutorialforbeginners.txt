in this video we are going to learn html for new developers now if you missed my last video which is how to set up visual studio code um in a professional coding environment and workspace you definitely want to watch that that link is in the description go ahead watch that and come back to here in this video we're going to learn html which is the content for the web i'm going to go ahead and close this real quick i can click on this folder thing and get rid of all those files so i have a little more screen to work with but if you think about a website it's got content and it's got look and feel to it so the content would be the words on the page any images on the page any buttons on the page and that those words images and buttons could look a thousand different ways with a thousand different colors so html is what puts the content on the page um and it's ugly you can tell that this is ugly i don't even have a font that's being chosen for me uh let alone a font size and a font color or a background color that's because i'm just using html right now i'm just adding content to my page after that we'll get into css which is cascading style sheets css would say give me a gray background with blue text and a button with rounded rectangle corners on it and let's make this image small and i don't know let's make it shake when you hover over it things like that that's css and so when people learn html and css together they can build a full website and then javascript is what a developer will learn to add functionality to that website where you can maybe post a tweet to twitter and things like that that's all functionality that's javascript so those three technologies make a web developer's tool kit now what we're going to do in this video is we're going to learn html and html is the easiest piece of all three you can really learn it in a day or even an hour because all you have to do is memorize a few words let me show you what i mean here i'm going to take away all this code and i'm going to leave that top one there because that's the one that says hey it's an html web page everything in html is considered a tag a tag looks like this a greater than symbol the tag name we'll call this html and then any attributes i'll get to attributes in a second and then the less than symbol you can see when i type that less than symbol vs code visual studio code automatically added what's called a closing tag for me which is the same thing but it has a slash anything between the opening tag and the closing tag is considered inside of a tag so if i type type type type this is now inside of my html tag and that's how that works you can have tags inside of tags i could have a body inside of the html tag and then i could have other tags inside of that you can have as many tags inside of as many tags as you want it's all just tags tags can be two things they can have an opening closing or if there's nothing inside of them they can be what's called selfclosing which you add a slash to the end of it and a good example of this would be an image an image is the img tag and image doesn't have text inside of it or any of that it loads an image from a web server and spits it out on the page so we don't have to have an opening and closing tag it can be self closing and then we define things how does that image know which image we're pulling from the internet we're going to use what's called attributes for that so a tag can have one or more attributes to do an attribute you do a space after the tag name and you give it an attribute let's say it has a width width equals 300. and so you do equals and then an opening closing of quotes and then whatever's inside of that is considered the attribute so think of it as a person right the tag name is image let's say this was called frank and frank has a height well he could have a width too there's attributes about frank right as a person he's got a certain height and he's got a certain intelligence these are things that are qualities about frank intelligence high and so that's kind of how tags and attributes work the tag is what the thing is the attributes describe things about that tag so in this case we have in the case of image we have an image and you might have a height a width and a source which is where that image comes from that is all of html we just covered all of html right here tags with tag names and attributes that's it from here on out you just have to memorize a few tag names and a few attributes and you have all of html done so let's get into some of these common tag names there's really three categories that give you everything you need to start off to build an html web page you have to have three tags to start off you have to have an html tag again i'm just typing html and hitting tab here and visual studio code is doing the rest so really all you do have to do is memorize some words so i'm doing an html tag inside of that i'm going to do a head tag and then i'm also going to do a body tag those are the three tags that it takes to build a web page you notice that head and body are both inside of html that's extremely important now html doesn't care about white space at all so these could be like this these could be like that it doesn't really matter none of that matters it only matters to you the developer we like to keep them indented in such a way where it's easy to see what's inside of what so that's what the indentions are all about i indent using tab so you can go tab and then you can also select one or more things and do shift tab or tab and things will move around indention wise so that's what those indentions are all about in our head tag we'll add one title tag here and let's say my page and let's add an exclamation mark because we're feeling chirpy today so there we go you can see up here at the top if you can see it because it's really little it says my page exclamation mark in the body let's add our hello world back and then that is our web page so we've got our body our body is everything that the user sees in this main body of the web page so all of the rest of our tags are going to go in here and so that is your basic three tags for a web page html head body and a title tag which you don't have to do but pretty much everybody wants to do it because you want your tab to have a title so now let's look into how you style text text comes with h1 tag being your biggest piece of text which is a header there you go wow that's really big i'm kind of zoomed in here to make it easier but wow that h1 is big and you can go all the way down to h6 my subtitle so you notice that h2 is by default a little smaller the default css for h1 is going to make it huge and h2 is going to be smaller and smaller still all the way down to h6 i'll do an h6 here which is even smaller so the h6 is even smaller than and what these are used for is these are used for telling google if you want it to rank your page to rank on google and all of the web browsers and everything what the most important pieces of your page are so google is going to look at your page and it's going to say oh the h1 that's the title for the whole page h2 these are section subtitles so any content blocks within your page will be h2s and farther down if if an h2 has multiple content blocks in that those will all be h3s that's what we use those tags for css could make this one huge and make this one tiny so it doesn't necessarily relate to size it more relates to importance so those are our h1 h2 those are our header tags and then there's a p tag which is for a paragraph hi i'm a paragraph of text so there's my paragraph of text and if i do multiple ones of these then you'll notice that each one kind of has a space in between it just like you would expect a paragraph to do default css is going to add a space below each paragraph and so that's how paragraphs work now you'll remember i mentioned that html does not care about white space so if i do a ton of spaces here it doesn't change when i save it nothing is different what if i add a million returns here well accidentally got a slash so we'll get rid of that slash if i had a million returns nothing changes html does not care about spaces past one the first space works because you know you really couldn't type anything without a space but that's kind of how html works it doesn't care about white space white space is what you use as the developer to make it easy to read all the content well what if i wanted to add a line break like that well there's an actual tag for a line break called br and it's a selfclosing tag because it doesn't have any content in it and you can see there we go we have an actual line break a return an enter key got added into that so that's a tag you want to know as well br for line break and then what if you want to change some of the ways these work you can add strong to make it bold let's make it a strong paragraph added a space there probably don't need a space there strong is basically what you use for bold if you're looking at really old web pages you may see a b tag floating around which does the same thing but that's that shouldn't be used anymore strong is what you should use for bold now and then em is what you use for emphasis which is italics you can see there we go italics so those are the tags that we use for bold and italics strong and em and we're actually getting a lot of the way through this list so if you feel overwhelmed just remember we only have about 12 words we have to memorize html head title body p strong em and then we also covered our header tags and you're almost through basic html with just those words uh here's a fun one there's buttons i'm a button there we go we have a button looks like i got a typo in there somewhere yep got an extra little piece and you can click it we have a button there no style to it but there's a button on the page and the button also doesn't do anything because we don't have any javascript or anything telling the button what to do but hey the button is there all the same so that's all of our text tags i'm going to show you two more tags and then we're done with basic html we can actually start learning basic css from here on out so let's go and add a list tag these are actually really important so if i go li and say i'm an item you can see i kind of have a bulleted list right there yep i have a bulleted list and if i have multiple items i could either lay them out like that or i should if i have multiple items wrap them in a ul which is unordered list and now i have to select this and cut it and paste it because i did it in a weird order and you learned to get really good at those kind of things as a web developer so i have a ul tag with multiple li tags in it this is an unordered list and list items so that's what those stand for these would be things like a navigation a top navigation on your page you will define a list of things and then use css to lay them out as a navigation you can also change this to o l o l and you'll make it an ordered list which is not very useful you don't do this as often in html but you can see as soon as i changed it to ol i got number one number two added to my lis but usually li and ul is the combination you'll go for that creates a list of items and then you can use css to style that in a way you need to so there you go that's it that's all you need to know for html it's tags with attributes with tag names that's html in a nutshell let's start building an actual web page with style and look and feel in the next video we're going to get into css you
