hey there I've had a lot of people ask me uh to do a quick video just kind of showing my Sublime Tech settings and any packages that I find useful um and I keep a pretty simple layout but I'll go ahead and show you what I have right now uh the first thing you'll notice is my theme the theme is predawn um and I love it because it also themes the UI gives it a really nice looking feel uh when I'm not using preon I'm probably using flat land or Dracula uh for an actual theme but I love the UI theme that pedon gives you um another thing that I use is G gutter uh G gutter is is a package that I love because it kind of as you can see over here in the gutter it's going to show you your GitHub changes if you've added some lines or if I've made changes to this it shows up as uh blue for changed or red for removed super super cool so you can see the diff real time with your GitHub stuff uh definitely love git gutter um I also use EMT for code completion that's probably the one that some of you guys have seen and wondered what that is that just basically allows me to go div class special ah sure whatever special and then it's and hit Tab and it's automatically going to complete some stuff some other stuff you can do with EMT I'll put a cheat sheet uh URL in the description but you can go d special um and then I don't know put an H4 inside of it uh you can also do plus for a sibling to that H4 super cool and then you can tab through and automatically fill it out so when you get good with EMT HTML is a breeze uh some more complex stuff you can do is you can have it number stuff I can go Li times five I'll actually have it Go Li ID uh sorry panel and then number which will actually do the number of it times 5 so now I got panel 1 2 3 4 5 super cool if I didn't like that I could do dollar dollar it would do twod digigit um numbers there so that' be panel 01 02 03 0405 took me a long time to realize that EMT could do that I really like that EMT does that uh you can also wrap stuff in parentheses um so I can go a div with a UL Li Time 5 and I can do times five of those so now I've got five uls with five liis in it sometimes with Sublime Text you'll get this weird quirk where you hit Tab and nothing happens on that when you're doing the wraps and you'll see down under here a number keeps clicking you have to tab like 10 times it's just a quirk that happens sometimes most of the time it works um and I haven't quite figured out when it doesn't work but just in case you run into that um another cool thing with EMT is there's a lot of cool shortcuts with EMT that I don't have memorized but if you hit control D on a Mac it's going to automatically select everything within your current tag so you can easily condense stuff or delete stuff uh so that's EMT and then honestly Let's see we get gutter my theme I do have like a custom tiny little bash script we can go sub and then open a file in Sublime Text as you can see I use it all the time even as I Was preparing for this video so I could go sub index.html and it's going to open index.html or sub main.js yeah and that that I use all the time once again I'll put the video link to that in the description for how to put that bash script together very very useful I end up using that thing all day long um and then I just use honestly some Sublime Text hot Keys you know like apple d uh for multiple cursors you know to be able to change stuff um you know you can easily do Apple D um Apple D also has this thing Apple K where you can skip a selection if you want um which is very useful uh what are other Sublime Text ones it took me a while to realize control Apple up and down is going to move any line up and down through your stuff super cool I'm sure that's probably different on PC um I do have a cool cheat sheet that I'll also add to the description for that once again that's Apple control up and down I use that all the time it just moves your line up and down um you can also use apple brackets to change your indentation instead of Apple instead of tab and um shift tab with which tab and shift tab work great when you're on multiple lines selected but if you just want to indent your one line apple and then your your brackets there you go your left and right brackets will indent whatever line you're on uh use that one all the time as well and honestly that's about as complex as I do with Sublime I mean it's got kind of its basic things a lot of times I won't use the sidebar and I'll just use apple p uh to hotkey back through my recent files I'll use p and enter to go back and forth between two files this is kind of basic Sublime Text stuff I don't know if you guys know that or don't know it or not and apple R will take you through all the symbols in your file so Apple R can take me to the init function and to the method function um but that's about it that's pretty much as complicated as my Sublime setup is hope it helped you a little bit and honestly if you have great stuff I'm all ears I'd love to see it uh comment below I'd love to hear any great tips you guys have found as well have a great day
