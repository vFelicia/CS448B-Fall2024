in this video we are going to cover the new ecmascript 2018 um or es super next as some people have been calling it so let's get into these awesome new features the first new feature is global variables or always global variables so there's this thing that can happen called scope conflicts if i were to go const a equals one and then a function some function and const a equals two here this creates what's called a name conflict which means i cannot access this value of a because i've already defined a here and the issue here is it doesn't throw an error no error is thrown i just no longer have access to this a which i might find out later on my programming so to get around this javascript has defined everything in es2018 as a global variable so this is global this is global this is global and now this will throw an error so a has already been declared so whether it's been declared here or in another thirdparty library or any other part of my application i'm going to get an error here and so there's basically no more guesswork when we're coming up with variable names we're going to know if they've been created anywhere else in the application another thing is common keyword shortcuts common keyword shortcuts so const function things that you type all the time const function there let's math anything that's really common they've come up with single letter shortcuts for it so you could just go c for const so const a equals one and then function same thing f sum function and that really shortens up the code and to go along with the keyword shortcuts all the baked in libraries like math have also given you the shortcut of just m and so instead of math you could do m instead of math.round you could do m.r so that really shortens up the syntax that you have to type and that brings us to the third point so let's just go ahead and erase that and that's dot syntax dot syntax has had this cult following for years now and people are then pushing to get it into javascript some think it's going to be a lot better for beginners some just argue that it's better to read and what it is is the methodology behind dot syntax is is let's take a lot of those common characters that you type every day that the interpreter translates anyway and let's actually just replace those all with a dot so you don't have to worry about what character you're typing so all those characters right there equal parens curly braces brackets and semicolons those can all be replaced with a dots so we could go const a dot one and then you could have the semicolon or not that's up to you that's still arguable same thing for a function so function sum function dot give it an argument say name dot age the comma can be replaced with a dot as well age end your column do a curly braces and then you can actually come in here and do something console log dot hi and then a semicolon at the end and then wrap that with another closing curly brace and so the dot functions as you can see what it does is dot syntax really cleans everything up you read the words and you don't have to get messed up with the jargon and the semicolons and the curly braces and all that and what it basically does is it makes it really really readable and so if we were to actually combine this with our keyword shortcuts then this could be f name age and console.log also has c so c dot l and that really cleans things up you're able to see hey we have a function getting name and age and we're console logging high or i guess in this case we could also console log name and so that's really really clean really really easy to read only thing that's a little quirky with it is if you use dot syntax to define objects like let's say b is an object b equals we'd normally do what c one d two uh then you can replace all those obviously with a dot syntax dot dot dot dot and the white space becomes a little bit more involved and then at this point if we were to console log something let's say we're going to console.log b dot c um then you know if you don't know what the program is doing uh you wouldn't know that this is console logging b.c but again if you know what the application is doing this is super simple syntax and it's so readable that's the best thing about it lastly uh flow and typescript support are coming native to javascript uh that's gonna be out in firefox 54. i don't know the chrome version of that um what it is is if you're on uh os x or linux if you're on mac or linux you're gonna get flow if you're on a pc you're going to get typescript support and i think they've kind of taken more of the divergent mentality of that if you've seen the movie divergent as as people have been saying by creating segregated groups of developers will ultimately be able to find the divergent quote unquote developer is kind of the methodology behind that and so by dividing the community up we're actually going to be able to figure out where the community needs to be going in the future and so that makes a lot of sense and that's going to be baked in as well so there's your ecmascript 2018 new additions i hope you're enjoying your april fool's day and have a good one
