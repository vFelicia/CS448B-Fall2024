hey in this video we are going to cover yarn which is a very cool new npm replacement uh if you've been doing front end or back in development with node.js then you're used to using npm to install all of your javascript packages npm is great but there are a few deficiencies with it that yarn fixes and so we're going to cover that real quick i'm going to show you how great it is to get started with yarn all you have to do is npm install g yarn and then you're good to go yarn gets installed and it will work with your existing package json for lots of projects it's just going to work out of the box you just use yarn instead of npm so while that's installing real quick there we go that's done let's go ahead now and do an npm install you can see i just kind of threw a package together and threw in some dependencies let's say low dash mobx mysql react connects babel and webpack all right let's go and do an npm install and see how long this takes here and i've already tested this it takes about 25 between 20 and 30 seconds to do this npm install which is quite a bit of time to just get a few javascript packages because it's pretty much going through synchronously and getting them all one at a time for the most part um so there we go still going still going still going this takes a while there you go still going all right that took a while and we've got our node modules created so let's go ahead and rmr let's rimraf our node modules folder and let's do this with yarn real quick yarn install let's see what we have here there it goes looking up all the package dependency trees installing everything and boom almost boom boom that took 10 seconds much much much much faster cool thing about yarn is it caches everything which means if we have another project let's say node modules is gone our yarn install again here this is going to be much faster you can see the fetching was instantaneous and now we're done in five seconds if this was another project using the exact same versions of some of these packages those packages would not have to fetch you essentially get offline development for everything that you've already had to fetch before so we've established that speed is this big plus with yarn let's look at the next major big thing that yarn adds for you and that's application stability you can notice this yarn lock file over here this is basically your npm shrink wrap file if you've ever messed with npm shrink wrap it's not a whole lot of fun you've got to always update it yourself sometimes you actually have to get in there manually and mess with it it basically locks down your full dependency tree well because if you don't do that then you might end up with slightly different versions of packages on different developer machines or you might have a slightly different package version on your machine and then go to production and it doesn't work and that can be just a lot of frustration and so yarn automatically locks it down all the time and it's a really clean and easy to read format you can see that this is the yarn lock file it's really easy to understand let's go to react react you can see there's my react dependencies wow that's pretty nice let's look at something more involved let's say connects there's my connects dependencies not too bad you can see them all right there boom boom boom and we're good to go so if you ever want to update something let's go ahead and look at react we're pulling off a 014 there's a later version out there so my package json same thing i can go yarn upgrade react and it fetches it very quickly as expected we're now running react 1542 and you can see i'm now let's go to react i'm now running the upgraded version of reactant yarn lock as well so yarn lock you want to commit to your repository to your source control just like you would with your package json and now if any other environment pulls this and doesn't install they're going to get the exact same versions that they're supposed to get so between these two features it's a really big addition a lot of cool stuff there's a little bit of a difference in the way you'll type the commands instead of npm install you'll do yarn add a lot of cli's are using add instead of install these days because it's a lot easier to type so yarn add view let's go ahead add view there we go that's added you can see it's added right there and let's say we want to add something else to a dev dependency yarn add d jquery so now it's going to add as a dev dependency because there we go jquery is in our dev dependencies uh so that's pretty similar um and then you could also do yarn start just like npm start so for the most part all the commands are the same yarn remove jquery take jquery away there we go and that's pretty much it so i hope you found this video helpful yarn has definitely been a great addition to my team and i hope it helps you out in your daytoday workflows
