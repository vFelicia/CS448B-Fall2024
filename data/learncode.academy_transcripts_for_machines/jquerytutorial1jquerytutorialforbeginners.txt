all right so if you're learning web development if you know HTML CSS or you're learning those the next step for you is going to be to learn jQuery jQuery is the easiest and most popular JavaScript library so if you want to start learning JavaScript learn jQuery every employer I've ever worked for uses jQuery no matter how big or how small they were so it's very popular there are companies that don't use it but most of them do so here's how you add jQuery on your page you download it from jquery.com put it in your project folder um and then what you're going to do is you're going to just add a script tag and you'll add the source to it so in this case it's in a bower components folder jQuery folder inside of there and then there's my file jquery.js so when I put that on my page nothing changes because jQuery doesn't actually do anything it gives you a library of commands that you can use to do things so it's on the page now and I'm going to go add my own script tag and inside of it I'm going to write my own JavaScript uh so what you're going to have to remember to start jQuery is one thing uh and this is the memorization part for you once you get through this you get to actually have tons of fun with jQuery so here we go it's document before I mention that this dollar sign is the the value that's given to the jQuery Library when it loads up so anytime you you want to reference jQuery you hit dollar um so we go document and then we go ready and you just got to memorize this you'll later on understand what it's about and then you do this function thing function open and close parentheses uh open and close curly braces and then close your first parentheses honestly what I did when I started off is I copied and pasted this and saved it somewhere because it just didn't make sense to me and you don't want to have to think about it just paste this in your jQuery code always goes inside of a document ready function you can have multiple document ready functions there's really no need to if you just have a few lines of code but they're not going to conflict what this does is this says hey wait for my whole document to load up before I try running any JavaScript otherwise you're going to try to talk to panel one with JavaScript and panel one hasn't loaded yet so the javascript's going to run it's not going to find panel one it won't do anything and then panel one will load and it's not going to do what you're expecting it to do and you probably won't even get any errors about it it just says nothing happens so the document ready function says hey wait for my document to fully load then let's start running stuff so your jqu goes in here there's also a short way of doing it and that's just dollar function so that's what I use that's what most people use but you can do document ready function they're the same thing so now that we've done that and now that I've probably confused you from the start that's the only complicated part the rest of it let's just have fun you're going to go dollar command and open your parenthesis and then you have two parts to each jQuery action you have the selector which works just like CSS you see over here I showed you what they are so there's panel one and that's because it's id1 exactly as if you were doing ID is panel one just like if you were doing CSS um so I've selected it you can use single quotes or you can use double quotes don't know what sublime's doing to me there you can use double quotes either one work and then you give it dot and give it your method so in this case I'm going to go hide and I'm going to hit SA it's going to reload for me so there you go it loads up the page and then it hides panel one I can tell it to hide 300 which will hide over the course of 300 milliseconds you'll see it kind of does a little animation there for me and then it's chainable Jake c is awesome and that you can keep chaining it as long as it's not the semicolon yet so I can hide it and then I can show it over the course of one second so it hides fast and then it shows slowly and you can just keep going you can do hide show hide show there you go go hio hio it's fun jQuery is tons of fun another thing you can do is slide up and just as you'd expect it slides up and then it hides and then you can have it slide down up and then back down you can also add a delay in there delay so we're going to delay for 1 second which is 1,000 milliseconds wait a little bit and then we'll do it again jQuery it's fun this is super awesome so I can have it slide up delay you can do fade in fade out there it goes and gone and then it's going to slide down um another thing you can do is you can do Fade toggle you can do toggle for pretty much anything so if I do Fade toggle twice then it'll fade out since it's currently in and then it'll fade in because it's currently out toggle will well it'll toggle you can slide toggle it's going to slide up and it's going to slide back down and then you can just do toggle if you just want it to do a hide a show hide so that's kind of the showing and hiding parts of uh jQuery super super fun you can go. CSS this is where it gets a little bit more tricky and then you give it a pair of curly braces which are options and I'm actually you can go color red and then oh red is not defined you have to do it in uh quotes sorry about that there you go and now my color became red uh this one has something else overwriting it but there you go the panel one gets a color of red and then I can do a comma here and I can go font weight the one thing you can't do I'll show you in a second font weight bold there we go font weight bold the one thing you can't do is you can't do font Dash weight because in JavaScript this means font minus weight which it looks for Math and doesn't make sense and we'll throw an error ah that doesn't make sense uh what you can do is you can wrap that in quotes if you want to do it that way single or double quotes and that works or jQuery is smart enough to where you can go font weight so there you go I can change the CSS um and it's a little confusing this is kind of a cleaner way of doing it we're making what's called a JavaScript object if you want to Google that so anytime you do curly braces in JavaScript it's making an object unless you have function before it which is really that's for a JavaScript lesson so now I can go color red and add a comma font weight bold now it's starting to feel a little bit more like CSS and I can go display none and just in case I didn't want to see it anymore which is basically what a jQuery show hide does so there we go panel one uh so let's make panel one high and then let's make panel 2 CSS opacity 0.5 so now when I boot up that's gone and that's halfway hidden and at from this point we'll call this a lesson and what will the next step will be in the next lesson is to listen to events the real fun of JavaScript happens when you start interacting with what the user does those are called JavaScript events when they click do this when they hover do this um and when they Mouse up do that so that's really where jQuery gets even more fun we'll stop right here so you can watch it over if I've done too much too fast if you've kept up with a pretty fast pace here let's go on to lesson number two
