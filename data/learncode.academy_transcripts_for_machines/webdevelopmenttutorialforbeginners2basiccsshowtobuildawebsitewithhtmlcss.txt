out to do web development in the previous tutorial we covered basic HTML how to put together HTML page we learned how to do tags opening and closing tags we learned kinda what some others popular tag names are lastly there's only ten or fifteen you actually need to know anyway so hopefully by now you've taken that course and you're comfortable I was kinda writing out basic HTML tags this should look decently familiar to you if not go back to the last video and get comfortable I promise it won't take very long there's only a few tags you have to learn and it really feels weird at first if you're not used to writing anything that feels like code but I promise it comes very quickly you won't be confused for long so I've done years I've taken a modified my example from the last video and now have my html with a header and a body and in that body I have header one which has my website I've got an unordered list with a link to three different pages and I've got I also a little bit of content you notice this tag up here. I left this out in the last example cuz it didn't really apply to learning basic HTML tags but we're gonna add this at the top every HTML page and this just declares that the document type is HTML and putting like this actually means html5 so it all you need to know is that it needs to be there at this point it basically tells your browser a working with an html5 page what I did then as I created a new page called page 2 dot html and I saved it in the same folder that I created another page called page 3 dot html and it's also in the same folder you can see here I didn't include a full http// WWW dot my website dot com all I did is put a it's called a relative link if you don't put that full thing it looks starting in the same folder that you're in now and the reason we called our first page index is because index is what its automatically going to look like look at when you load a web site if you go to Google dot com a you know there can be some configuration changed to make it different but by default a website is going to look for index dot HTML so one thing I changed here is the first /li if it's on the page that you're on now there's not going to be an tag Because if we're on home we don't have to go to Home were already there so as you can see on home this is not a link page two and three are linked and I can go to page to you and it loads page to you and now home and page 3 our link because home is going index and three is going to page three so I can now navigate between all three pages of my website..see it's not too bad I basically have a website it's up and running it's just ugly because there's no style so let's get into how to add style to your webpage I've saved a file called main dot CSS and a CSS stylesheet is how we do styling And it basically works like this you have a selector which is where we take up something we're going to add style to and then you have a rule the selector basically as brackets anything within those brackets gets applied to the selector so the rule you have the property that you wanna change in the value wanna give it and then you've got a colon and an there's a semicolon this'll probably be the weirdest part about CSS is getting comfortable going selector open some brackets go back go up property collin value semicolon probably looks weird feels like it's a lot to memorize its gonna come really fast type your selector open some brackets take a property pick a value for you're done so in this case we picked body so anything within the body is now going to get a background of 999 and we'll get into this a little bit later but for now that just means a background of gray say what will make it black well make it read for now that's a little easier to understand so the body now gets a background thread knows when I refresh nothing happens because this style sheet is not attached at all to my page so there's two ways you can get style to your page you can start by just going style and add style tag and will make sure we at this attribute type equals text slash CSS because we're doing CSS style and now I can go body background Nope, not bottom red it save hey check it out there you go so you're thinking why would I not clearly do it this way this is much easier but what if we want to type in a 150 different rules and we want to be shared between all our pages on now either have to copy paste or you put them in a separate file which is what we're gonna do here we put background red in here and now we can link to it going to do a link and this href is going to be I'm going to link two styles main dot CSS and I need to do rel=stylesheet and basically what that tells it is I'm giving you a link to a style sheet and we can also add type equals text slash CSS most new browsers don't need that some old browsers are going to so now we've done is we've got at this link and now all I have to do is add this link to each page and each page is now going to get all the styles that I put in main.CSS so you see as I navigate every page background is hideous red I'm going to change that to a slightly more pleasant color 999 which is kind of a grayish color it's now we can add some more styles let's say we want to make our headers a better font actually let's make the whole body a different font fonts family Ariel that's a little bit cleaner looking now the font family is Arial now CSS is where you get into a decent bit more memorization there's only about 10 or 15 HTML tags you use there's a lotta CSS properties that you can adjust because as you can imagine every ounce of style but the whole page has is coming from the CSS properties so it's just gonna take you a little while you wanna start off with some things that are more comfortable and work your way up there's not it's not an endless black box there's an end to it it probably will only take you a few weeks and all of the sudden you realize wow there are no more CSS properties that I don't know it's just a long few weeks have learning so definitely give yourselves a little bit I'm have patience and it will come very quickly but first your gonna feel like you're just completely drowning in the ability to not do anything that you want to do but we're gonna show you a little bit more about selectors here real quick so here's how you..I've shown you how to grab things by tagname that's what we did here we just created a tag name body usually you don't do that to too often you'll do it for body you'll do for h1 so I'll go h1 I'm gonna go color and this will be like a 333 color and now you'll notice my h1 got just a little bit lighter let's change a little bit more 2666 all the "mark of the beast" jokes are coming up basically if you go all the way to 000 you're a black go all the way up to you 999 you're at a gray and anything in between is kinda well and between something like that 555 but also a fist fight to any each to use some going to do h1 common H to you and now you'll notice my h2 also has a gray color I can also make this PL on any my paragraphs have a psych make this any allies on May ally status I could make this any A's on a stab this and now I've styled everything with a color 555 I don't eighties to do that though so maybe I'll make my A's a different color later on let's make my A's a little different color blue ago act green everything's green area everything's blue I want to change it up a little bit so now we have every page is inheriting the styles so it's starting to look just a little bit better up so let's go ahead and add maybe a couple more styles here let's give paragraphs a background color let's make our paragraphs color whites yeah that spill nice I'm going to go and take PL this cuz I don't wanna target my P's anymore and now we want to add just a little bit of padding to it see how this is like completely cramped we want that paragraph to have a little bit more padding so that's call patty and here you get to define unsafe I pixels so now you notice to put five picks a padding on all sides make it a little bit more 10 pics patting their ego and say just want to be on the top and the bottom which you can actually do is if you do one value gets applied to all sides if UT two values then it goes top bottom leftright Sun ap I say 10 pixels era pixels top bottom half 10 leftright have not well the right goes all the way cuz it's filling up page that's something we can address later if you do four values then you're doing one for each side so I'm going it goes like this if I go one value and it does all ID to you it's going top bottom left right if I do four that kinda goes around clockwise just like a clock starts at the top top bright bottom left so I can actually add four things younger 10 pixels 10 pixels 0 pixels on the bottom and 0 pixels on the left so now I have patting year had here which can't quite see because once my text gets over there you'd be able to see it and I got some there for now was gonna go 10 pixels on all sides and call it a day so now any paragraph I add on nemi pages is going to get a book our gray background white text and a nice little padding their hey let's experiment just to find out at there some more page to content it's nice everything I get throughout my entire site every paragraph is gonna have a lovely little look but say my HQ I'm gonna leave that right where it is so this is kinda basically how we're gonna style some things let's say we want just this one paragraph have a different color to it what do we do that we want to give it what's considered a class yes I know we're not supposed to have upper lower class and the classes are bad but in this case that's just what we're gonna call it class I secondary let's do that class secondary right now nothing changed but now I can add a rule targeting class secondary and I'm gonna add a dot the dot means I'm looking for class so I thing I put in here on our override what I put in there I'm gonna go backgroundnone and this colors gonna be let's make this a little bit have a more greyed out color let's see if that happens 555 there you go it's actually make it even more great out some subs on barrio so now I have any paragraph gets this and anything with the class secondary it's that because we specified a class a class is now more specific if you'll notice even if I put secondary be four usually what happens by the way with CSS rules is what comes after is gonna override so if I had another p we're all here and this background is red now this is overriding this because it happened after that's why it's called cascading style sheets kinda cascades it can get defined appear but you can override it as you move on so what we've done now as you notice class does not get overridden because class is considered more specific its and issue up specificity so now secondaries get no background and they get a color 777 another way that you can target things oh yes and a nice thing about classes can apply to multiple things they can apply to you this I can also make this paragraph have a class secondary as well so now they both have secondary I can also make this /li right here at a class secondary and tickets great out as well it applies to anything that you at the Class two another way that you can make a very specific issue in targeting is by ID ID equal special the difference between ID in class as you can only have one ID per page so I can only have one thing that's called special on the page I cannot create two things with an idea special you're breaking the rules so I can say secondary has that's copy paste here and now there's something with an idea special and this background will be read because after all its special and now there you go so each page can have one thing called special but they can have as many things called secondary as they want usually you know you wanna class things more than you want to I D things ID is only is something very specific and you know for sure there's only going to be one a common occurrence that is ID equals navigation there's usually only one primary navigation on the page so in this case I I kid make my you l have an idea nap and that's the kind of thing that you're usually use an ID for I ID's are a little bit faster as far as if you have a thousand rules ID's are going to be a little bit faster after your web page to appear other classes are going to be a little bit slower usually really are not going to notice though unless you get tons and tons and tons and tons and tons CSS classes so years kinda how we basically style at a web page in our next video we're going to cover some more advanced CSS rules
