all right so a little while ago I kicked off this single page angular app that used Molton to build a storefront and so I kind of wrapped that together it's not beautiful but all the key components are working and so I kind of wanted to Showcase this to you real quick I also threw all the code up on GitHub it's not necessarily all gorgeous code because I did it really pretty quickly um but if you want to kind of get some ideas on how you could build an app I'll kind of show you some things that I ended up doing um over here in inventory they have this cool thing called collections so I made a collection I added some products to my collection called homepage features um and I think ideally what that does is then when you go to store uh these are kind of the featured items these all exist in other categories but you can add them also to this collection I think ideally I'd also C create a collection called homepage slider uh which would have you know big images for all the truly featured items up there um another thing I did is I added stripe checkout here under Advanced gateways I added stripe added my stripe.com account which is super easy to use all you have to do is add your API key which I just added my API test key um and then that's good to go so stripe is now kind of my default checkout system um and let's kind of show you the rest of the store here so I can go to this here killer iPad add it to my cart I've kind of got this Global cart icon here that keeps track of all the items that are in my cart let's go back to the store let's find some sale items uh this test product is sale item let's go add that yeah I think ideally I'd have a quantity thing here also a drop down for you know if there's sizes or colors but that's easy to add a little later we can go to our checkout um here's kind of my pretty janky little cart that I threw together but everything is functioning you know it' be nice to have some updating of quantities here and the ability to remove items let's go ahead and check out here's kind of our checkout I went ahead and actually just copied and pasted all the fields from Molton checkout um their angular template they had going on so that made it quick and easy I'll put a link to their angular template they have as well in the description I'm just going to go ahead send it all to one address do autofill here okay there you go I threw in some dummy information autofill grabbed a few things but you're not going to know where I live and you're not going to know my home phone so um there's my basic deal I added a few shipping methods or should I say I added one shipping method which is free shipping and then I can pay with my credit card um which is going to go through stripe um and then stripe for testing has all these kind of credit cards that you can use this one's always going to authorize um and then you can have some different ones you know some of these will automatically fail some of these will give you a fail where the address doesn't match yada yada yada so we're just going to do that and then any expiration date is going to pass with this credit card number so date and year so 12 2017 sure and 555 so let's go ahead and pay now if you look real quick at orders ah I've already paid for it dang it if you go to this before you pay you're going to see that you have an unpaid order um and then after the customer has paid uh then it's going to convert over to a paid order and that's kind of nice that way you can kind of keep you know keep contact with customers who start an order I don't know if you've ever gotten an email from a from a company where you start an order and then you kind of abandon the process you can get an email later that day or later that week that says hey did you forget about your order here so that's nice you kind of get the idea you get the ability to query by orders that have not been paid yet and there we go there's my paid order and I got this really completely pointless little thank you for your order page and I could send off an email at that point or do whatever I wanted to do but there's my kind of really quick storefront all in all it did not take very long to put together and once again the full source code is learn codeacademy Molton D angular I'll get you that link and I'll also get you a link to Molton angular app that they kind of threw together with coffee script they probably put a little bit more tender loving care into it than I did so check theirs out as well and have a great day and hope you enjoy using Molten
