all right so these next two videos are actually going to be a lot of fun for anybody who's ever tried ecommerce before um I've had to do ecommerce several times and if you're using a ecommerce platform usually they're this bulky PHP annoying thing uh that's just annoying like when people ask me to hey will you develop ecommerce for me I usually Grimace and just I don't want to do it because it's one of the less fun things that you do as a developer um however this company recently reached out and said hey would you be interested in looking at a product and featuring it and I said well I've got to like the product any product before I tell people about it uh but let me take a look at it um and honestly I fell in love with it I'm pretty much going to be using this for ecommerce stuff in the future because it's so easy and so cool so I wrote him back a little while later and said yes I'm definitely going to do a video on this and so what Molton the company Molton has done is they've taken the whole big platform out of it they said we're not going to provide you a platform we're going to give you apis that connect to the admin tool that all your support staff uses to enter products and update prices and blah blah blah and then you get to build it in anything you want so for JavaScript users you can build it in angular or Ember or whatever for PHP users you can build it in any framework you want yes anybody that's done ecommerce before is already really excited so I'm going to show you the API real quick and then in the next video we're going to build an angular app and we're going to build out almost the entire store in just minutes so let's real quick look at Molton what it is what it does basically create a free tier account their free tier gives you like 30,000 API requests a month I believe it's quite a bit um and so you create a new store it takes like two questions and you have a store and as a developer that's about all you have to do you can access your API keys right here um for that store and then you can also add admins administrators uh to the store that can log into the dashboard uh let me show you the dashboard real quick uh the dashboard is what all your support staff will use or if you're a small company you'll use it uh but it's a great separation of concerns because developers don't need to worry shouldn't have to worry about orders inventory shipping any of that junk uh and so it's a really clean slick inventory management tool I went ahead and added three products took no time at all and so we're going to use apis from here on out to access the store and start building our store any way we want to um and so let's look since we're going to be doing angular let's look at the JavaScript API I won't really touch the PHP API although it's pretty much just as simple so let me go ahead I have this local host file spun up over here and here's my basic HTML file now to start off with Molton you're going to copy that API key and you need to load in their SDK right here which they have all this in their docs they do have really good docs especially for a new company they have really good docs so you create your new molten object and then you do a molten do authenticate um and then that's just going to give you a callback function when it's authenticated when it's connected to your store um and so from there on out you can make API calls and they're very straightforward you can go Molton do category. list category list and I'm not going to pass it any filters of any kind and so let's just console log categories whoops I want to console log that man I can't okay there we go so I'm just going to console log categories after I get them let's Let Live reload pick that up and there we go I've got my one category which is the default uncategorized category uh it's got my description it's got my ID so let's go ahead and now get all the products that are in that category I'm going to snatch that ID out so I can go molten product. list uh and I can search category is that ID right there and the ID does have to be a string it cannot be a number and products so there we go that's going to call back and let's just console log products there we go I've got my three three products right there super easy simple to do let's snatch a product ID um let's just do a product get let's get this ID I think that's all I have to do if I recall correctly all their apis are named correctly they really make sents which is nice see yep there's my product there's my pricing um it's got both formatted pricing with tax without tax which is really cool um raw stuff um you've also got apis to create customer customer logins so yes you don't have to manage customers um and then that way they can add in all their information basically anything you'd get in a full featured shopping cart you can do via simple apis um let's go ahead and I have that product number right there and now I can add it to my cart cart insert that the second Pam is how many you want I want to add three of that to my cart there's some third Pam that's always got to be null I'm not quite sure what that for maybe it's for something in the future but for now that has to be in there um so we're adding that product three times and I will return a cart so let's go ahead and add that product I have already added it before so I should see a lot more than three in there yeah I see uh the price is $10.99 and I've got 10 of them in there right now so uh there we go and that's going to show me kind of my totals formatted here's where my cart's sitting right now now um and that's basically the JavaScript API super easy I'm not going to bore you with every API call you can do let's get into fun stuff in the next video we're going to do angular and we're going to use the yman angular generator which I've been wanting to do for a while anyway because it really speeds up your angular development um you basically don't have to do any boiler plates and we're going to build out a shopping cart all the way up to check out in a matter of minutes so let's go ahead and cover that video
