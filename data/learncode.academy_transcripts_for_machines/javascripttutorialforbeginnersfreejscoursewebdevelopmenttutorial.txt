in this whole series we are going to be learning JavaScript and the reason is simple because JavaScript rocks it's arguably the most popular language around today and it's running in pretty much every web browser so if you're using your iPhone to view a website or your iPad or your Android or Chrome or a super old version of Internet Explorer it's pretty much going to be running JavaScript and what it does and JavaScript basically adds function to your website to your HTML and CSS so say I want to keep track of how many times this button has been clicked two times three times four times that's JavaScript or say I want to click this and it shows some super secret hidden content that's also JavaScript or say I'm working on a form and I wanted to do something my name is Will hey Will's a great name well thank you this computer's brilliant that's all JavaScript so we're going to get into kind of the basics of JavaScript and the good news is is Javascript is a programming language so once you learn it you've actually learned some computer programming so before we add it to our actual web page let's kind of start off with some programming Basics on JavaScript what I want you to do is get Google Chrome download it install it if you're going to be a web developer it's a really good browser to use and go view developer JavaScript console the shortcut key for this on Mac is command option J or on Windows it's control shift J and that's going to bring up your console here and what the console does is it allows me to code directly into my web page now none of this gets saved onto my web page it's just kind of happening real time and it's the best way to learn and to play around with code so you can see I can type one here it says one I can type 1 plus two there you go I kind of got a calculator going on 3 + 354 357 so the first thing that we need to learn with programming is you need to learn what a variable is now it's a big word but variable basically means we're creating a container that's going to store a value for later on so remember in algebra when you'd say like xal 1 so what's x + 1 well that's two well if xal 2 what's x + 1 well that's three basically a variable is that we're giving a a a number a name and how you do that in JavaScript is you use the letters v r for variable so I could say ver x equals 1 it's now every time I Type X it's going to say well that's one so x + 2 well that equals 3 cuz that's as far as JavaScript is concerned there's no difference between saying x + 2 and saying 1 + 2 cuz we said x equal 1 so I could go ver x = 1 ver Y = 2 and I could say x + y and that equals three so now it probably feels like you're in your math class and for those of you guys who hated math you're like no oh this is going to be terrible I promise this is not about math so maybe a better example is let's say their name equals will and you can use single or double quotes for this but if you're going to use letters you have to use quotes like I said you can use double quotes if you want so now whenever I say name it's going to spit out will so now I can do alert and then I can open up and I can say name and I can close out my parenthesis and I hit enter and it's going to say will so I could also say alert and I could just do some quotes right now hi Will and then hit enter so it says Hi Will alerts kind of a cool function that does this little alert window this will work in pretty much any browser so that's kind of what a variable is now there's some types of variables types that's a very important word to remember JavaScript has about seven types to it um and most most every computer language has a lot of the same types at the very beginning you'll notice that you remember I did a number ver xals 3 that's a number type so I can do math with that I can do x + 3 and it's going to know that this is the actual number three now if I do that with quotes equals 30 and that does not know that it's the number 30 anymore I actually whenever you use quotes it becomes a string type and string means that all these different digits are strung together so it just knows that this is the number three followed by the number zero it doesn't know that it's the number 30 so if I say x + 10 well now it's just 3 0 1 0 JavaScript is smart enough to not give you an error it's just going to say ah you just added a number in in a string let's just lump it together into one big string so if I say ver y equal 30 without quotes now Y is the number 30 so y + 10 is going to be 40 so that's your string type and that's your number type I'm going to teach you one more command and you're free to create a basic program for yourself that command is prompt I do prompt I open and close my parentheses and hit enter and that's going to open up this window here so now I can say Will and it's going to return will so I could go that really didn't do anything yet so I'll have to go ver name equals prompt and then I can go will and so now if I ever say name name is stored as will so I could go ver name equals prompt and now if I hit a semicolon I can add a second command alert name so there we go I'm going to go will it's going to say okay and then it alerted will awesome so let me go one more thing let's make this a little bit more ver name equals prompt ver last name equals prompt alert name plus let me do a comma plus last name there we go so let's go will Stern and then it's going to say will comma Stern all right probably would have made more sense to do a space uh except for that prompt isn't helping me out because it's not telling me what to do it just gives me this little thing so you can actually enter a prompt message in here what's your first name there we go and now it asks me what is your first name I'm going to say my first name is Will so let's fix this little program I've written here their name equals what what is your first name and I'm getting quite a long line here but that's okay what is your last name and you see it looped around here and then I'm actually going to turn that into a space so it looped around but what is your first name Will what is your last name wil Stern so there there you go and now you can write your first basic JavaScript computer program uh and if you were to do some homework before going on to the next lesson I'd say create a prompt and alertbased program that asks for some user information and then spits out a combination of that information just like I did here I alerted a name plus a last name or maybe make an addition program where you say you know give me one number give me another number and say the sum of those two numbers is blah blah blah that's your first homework assignment and let's get into the next lesson
