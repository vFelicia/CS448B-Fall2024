in this video we are going to cover parcel which is an awesome new build system tool um and dare i say it it just may be the webpack killer for anybody who builds modern javascript applications configuring and working with the build system is one of the greatest pain points that you're going to have but parcel streamlines almost all of that and for as young as it is it is incredibly featureful and it's my goto build system until i should potentially need and most of the time i absolutely don't need webpack for something extremely business specific so i'm going to show you how parcel works it's a lot of fun and we're going to cover so much ground in just a couple minutes basically you start by npm installing globally parcel dash bundler you can also install this as a dev dependency into your project which just means adding a script to your npm package so we're good to go there i'm in the parcel directory now i can init y and i don't really need to do that yet but let's go ahead and get going i'm going to touch an index html i'm going to do a module 1.js and a module 2.js we're going to have three different files going on our page here and in vs code i can just an exclamation in tab to get kind of like a basic html file let's go and include our javascript module one and that's it i'm ready to have my build system all i have to do is run parcel which is short for parcel serve so there we go i have a local server running let's go to that local server and this is loading my empty html page so let's see what happens if i do an h1 yep we've got live reloading going on there okay awesome let's do something more in javascript let's kick over my module 1js here let's just say hi console log hi and it's automatically reloading okay so that's not super magical i have a live server with live reloading but i can also do imports let's go to import module 2 and now i can console log something from module 2. you can see as it reloads it loads in module 2 and then it runs high so i automatically have all this dynamic importing going on i didn't have to configure babel or anything like that but i can configure babel if i want to let's say i want to run a specific babel feature i can touch a babel rc file let's say i want to use babel stage 3 preset you know something specific to what i want to do for this project then i can install it let's save this now let's do babel preset stage 3. while that's installing let's go to this babel rc and add it and it'll automatically get picked up let's add stage three preset it's in there i can run parcel again and now you can see i'm gonna see installing babel core so it's automatically taking care of all the other details for me i just had to do the specific thing i wanted to do and parcel took care of the rest so now let's do some stage three stuff here i can go let's do some spread and rest values equals a is one b is two now let's say const new values equals values can't normally do this but i can do it with stage three and stage three so then i can just cancel on new values let's see what happens over here on my application and i have my new values array it's spread out values one and two and automatically included value three uh so excellent i'm automatically able to use babel super super simple but wait there's more let's say i decide that my application's growing and i want to use react well that's easy let's just go ahead and install the react packages react and react dom while those are installing let's go ahead and add an app tag to my page here um let's go over here and just uh import to react from react so now we have react and react dom let's go ahead and render a new application to that div id app that i created react dom render let's just do an h1 right here wait we haven't installed any jsx well we don't have to do it because once react is there parcel automatically takes care of that for you so hi let's render our render our dynamic app here and let's render it to document app okay this got a little messy here because i'm zoomed in so much not quite used to this but i want to make it easy for everyone to see let's go and save this let's parcel again and see what happens you can see that we're doing some react specific stuff here check prop types stuff like that let's refresh and whoa i have a react application let's say i thought that was a little bit too shouty and i want to take away that exclamation mark um does it hot module reload still yes it hot module reloads still so parcel tries to take away all of that friction uh from the local development experience it's super super cool um let's look at some examples in code real quick what else can we do i made a couple examples for you here um it can do code splitting code splitting is super easy it basically just allows you to use the dynamic import syntax which is in a proposal right now you run the global import function which returns a promise so i can import module two dynamically at any point and then do something with it once it loads so that gets split out into two files module one and module two so we don't have to load our entire application and if you already know what dynamic code splitting is then you know what that is give you more of a react example right there view if you like vue.js well that's pretty simple all you have to do is add parcel plugin view and also add view component compiler utils if you want to use the actual view component syntax and you're good to go then everything else works for view i'm going to go and put these code examples online so you can see them but that is parcel in a nutshell super fun instead of spending an entire day or two setting up your build system for many many if not most applications parcel will get you set up in a matter of minutes it's a ton of fun go have fun with parcel and i encourage people contribute to it let's build this thing up because managing the build is seriously the most frustrating part of web development these days let's get rid of having to do that by just making a nice smart tool and building it up well so that's my two cents on parcel i really enjoy it it's my go to build system tool for right now and i haven't really used webpacks since i've discovered parcel i hope this video helps you out a lot and i hope you enjoyed it thumbs up it subscribe and have a great day you
