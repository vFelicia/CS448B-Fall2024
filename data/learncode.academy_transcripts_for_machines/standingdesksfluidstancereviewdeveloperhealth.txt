okay i am really excited about this video uh some stuff i've wanted to talk about for a long time got a cool product here in my hands the level by fluid stance a lot of you guys have seen this and wondered if it's any good uh yes it is i'll talk about that in a second uh basically um if any of you guys have been following my twitter i don't really talk about my twitter but it's at learn code acad acad uh so if any for those of you guys that have followed it i've been talking about my standup desk situation a lot recently and how much i love it and yes i have i've been doing fulltime web development 40 hours a week since i was 18 and sitting is a major problem is a major health problem got some quotes here uh from other people not just me tim cook ceo i think from apple he calls sitting the new cancer um and then i think huffington post said sitting is the smoking of our generation uh there's some infographics if you check out pinterest that show how much higher the percentage of death is for people who sit 40 hours a week i mean it's just it's bad sitting 40 hours a week is bad and back in the day you didn't really have a choice this is what companies did even web companies you had to wear your nice shirt and you had to sit 40 hours a week at a desk and that's just what we did but research and health conscious companies are coming out and they're just giving us a lot more options a lot of web companies especially if you request a standup desk or a standup sitdown desk they'll probably provide it for you or if you request a thing to help you uh with your development experience they'll probably provide it for you so um basically my experience about six months ago i started doing a standup desk and i'm absolutely positively never ever ever ever going back um i don't stand full eight hours a day i tend to stand about six hours a day but it's just you feel so much better throughout the day you have so much more energy throughout the day and a lot of issues like back issues even even if you have a great ergonomic chair i used to work at webmd.com and they they gave us really good those really expensive ergonomic chairs and you don't deal with near as much with your back but you still deal with all the other health issues that are associated with sitting for a long time so back issues kind of go away right away your core gets stronger standing up you notice that which as a developer noticing your core at all it's kind of revolutionary um and then neck issues kind of went away i started kind of having some neck issues i had a little forward head posture you know where your neck kind of does that thing from trying to fix code issues that went away really quick you know i got my monitor up higher than desk level and that went away real fast so basically physically you just feel a lot better standing um and then the only thing you notice is is you can't stand very long because you find yourself doing a hard stand where you'll you put you're trying to solve a problem you're focused you find yourself putting all the pressure on one hip or the other hip or just one knee or one ankle for a long period of time your feet can't handle the pressure of standing for a long period of time again especially because you're focused and that's really where this product makes a massive difference this is the fluid stance level or the level by fluid stance and it's a standup desk balance board um and it's not a balance board like you'd find at the gym where it's made for drastically increasing your balance and strengthening your legs it's a much more gentle if you can look at the slope of that it's a much more gentle balance whatever a gentle slope and so it's very natural very easy to stand on my wife jumped on it and could stand on it right away she doesn't do skateboarding or any extreme sports like that and she could easily just stand on it and enjoyed standing on it my toddlers love this thing and i love it i mean it just really it's fun to go to my desk in the morning with this thing here because it's just fun and i'll show you kind of what it does in a minute um but the best thing about it is you don't do those hard stands there's more of a motion throughout the day you can change to i don't know 30 40 different positions you can kind of roll your feet back sideways you know really stretch your calf out for part of the day and you can roll your feet forward and just get a whole bunch a lot of range of motion you don't do those hard stands and your feet don't really get very sore i could probably stand on this thing a full eight hours in the day and my feet wouldn't be sore by the end of the day or at least not anywhere as close as they'd feel um if i was standing on the ground i couldn't stand eight hours straight on the ground without something like this to put it plainly and it's not best in class it's pretty much only in class there's kind of a cheap knockoff plastic kind of thing that you can find on amazon but it's not even a similar kind of product it only goes back and forth and it's just not even in the same class so this is every bit worth the price they tend to range from about around 200 to around four hundred dollars depending on what you want this deck made out of um but i can say i would much rather have a cheaper sit stand desk with one of these guys than a really nice like two thousand dollar sit stand desk now as far as the desk component itself you can either uh i think the best way to go is a sit stand adjustable desk ikea makes a 400 one that's electric that you can change throughout your day so if you're in or near a big city that has an ikea that's your cheapest way to go if your company is buying you one and budget's not as much of a concern you can go to the sleep number store they have several options of really good sitting standing desks that are more around the one to two thousand dollar range um and that's it i mean i really just i kind of had to do a video on it and i was able to really get my hands on this i've used this nonstop since i got my hands on this thing it is it is awesome and i'm not getting paid to tell you this i think it's very important i say this because some people would think that i'm i'm getting paid to tell you this um i'm not so it's it's just basically a great product that i think people should know about and request from their work to get them one so let's kind of show you how this thing works alright so here you go here it is um i've got it on a piece of wood right here because i do think it's best experienced on wood it totally works on carpet and rugs but you just stand on it and as you can see it's not that big of a balance issue and if you ever start swaying into one direction it takes no effort to just get it back especially if you have a desk that gives you any kind of pressure at all i'm not touching a desk right now and it's a lot of fun just twisting it back and forth all the little different ranges of motion you get like i said you can stretch out your calves kind of get that work on there and then lean forward you can even do like a walking motion while you're sitting there working of course you ever get bored just give yourself a little spin see if i can grab the wall here so the spin is of course kind of a professional level move i'm not gonna lie i'm really kind of a professional at this but yeah this thing is great and again i'm not touching a desk right now touching a desk it's even easier even more comfortable even more natural let me kind of show you how it works on a rug this is a very thick rug um still works just fine no issues whatsoever in some ways it's actually a little easier in that you don't spin if you don't want to move back and forth as you go then this is uh some kind of rug or pad will actually help you out um and that it just kind of gives you a forward backward left right motion you don't really get any of that spinning you got to kind of work to spin at this point and then a low carpet if you can hear me i'm a little further from the microphone now low carpet kind of gives you that in between really easy to spin at this point i'm it's not going to damage the carpet at all and honestly this piece of pine right here i got a piece of pine as kind of a tester for what it's going to do to a hardwood floor pine obviously being a pretty soft wood a really light wood didn't really do any damage to this thing after a straight week tiny little scrapes and scuffs so if you're gonna do it on a nice hardwood floor um i would definitely get some kind of pad they sell a floor pad for it that obviously looks a lot better than this um you could also go cheap and just go to home depot for six bucks to get one of these which works just fine or get some sort of hard plastic chair mat or something like that but again the thing works great super fun to stand on just hop on it every morning have a great time and your legs your knees i've noticed these ankles are just kind of moving constantly um and i can code just fine on it that's that's the best thing too it's not distracting from coding at all it's it's a distractionfree thing i feel like it actually helps me focus better because a lot of us coders are kind of a little bit 80d and we need something to kind of keep us engaged and so this helps with that okay that's it um as you can see it's super fun product stand up desk is awesome again i'm telling you guys you got to try it at least try the pinterest hack one of those myriad of pinterest hacks for
