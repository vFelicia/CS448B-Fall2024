so let's create a build system with grunt uh if you don't know what a build system is or missed my Spiel on what a build system is I'm going to put a link to that in the description and hopefully you've already watched the video on the basic introduction to node.js because that will be a requirement for this if you don't no node so that's also down there and let's go ahead and get started uh we're going to use grunt today to concatenate our JavaScript files um and uh we're also going to concatenate our CSS files and they're going to watch so it's going to do these whenever we save that's going to be our first step that we do um and so let's go ahead and get started the first thing we're going to do is run npm install DG for Global grunt CLI so grunt command line interface is what CLI is for so now everyone on the computer will have access to the grunt command uh and then we don't have a package Json started yet so I'm going to run npm in nit that's going to create a package Json for me I'm just going to say okay okay okay okay okay okay okay and there we go there's my package Json now I can't have this called grunt because I actually have to install the package called grunt here let me show you what happens if I go npm install DS to save grunt into my package grunt it's going to say refusing to install grunt as a dependency of itself so I'll call this grunt project save it and now I can run npm install s grunt there we go grunt is now installed I have node modules and grunt is there excellent so the only other thing I need to do is I need to create a grunt file. JS with a capital G I believe it has to have a capital G I believe so so when you run grunt it's going to Lo it's going to load the grunt file and that's pretty much all that happens so what we do if you remember from nodejs we're going to do a module. exorts equals function and function gets grunt and that's it for you and so now for our first action remember grunt is a task Runner so let's create some tasks to run register task and let's give it a name Let Me Go full screen here uh let's register a task called speak maybe and give it a function to run when you run the task speak uh we'll just console log I'm speaking there we go so now if I run grunt speak it's gonna say hey I'm speaking woohoo let's create another command register task yell I'm yelling so now if I run grunt speak it speaks and grunt yell I'm yelling there you go congratulations you've made your first two tasks now we all have all we have to do is make these tasks smarter um one other thing that you can do is you can go grunt register task um both and then I can give it an array Let Me Go full screen again so you can see it um and this will require run speak and yell so then it's going to run speak and yell so the both tasks will do both let's verify that that works grun both I'm speaking I'm yelling and also if you call this default whatever task you called default will run when you just run grunt so there we go grunt so that's how you R register tasks you do grunt. register task whatever's in the function gets fired when the task gets called so that's pretty basic nothing super smart going on now we have to do is let's load some common tasks uh that we're going to use um all the time and so to do this I'm going to go to the grunt website and look at the plugins what's awesome about grunt is not so much that grunt runs tasks but that it's got a build ion awesome awesome plugins to plug into it uh so grunt contrib concat is going to be the first one we look at we're going to concatenate files together and one thing with grunt you get good at is you get good at looking at um I'm actually going to look at this on GitHub might be a little more familiar you guys you get good at looking at readme files and figuring out what to do so I'm just going to scroll down I know where to go here um there's a grunt and knit config so here's kind of how these tasks work one you're going to install them there you go save Dev so let's go ahead and run this command to install it npm install we're installing Grunt contrib concat and we're going to save that as well that's installed and so now you can run this load tasks grunt contrib concat let's get rid of these guys now we're loading a task from our npm module and so at that that's going to do is that's going to look for preconfiguration on what our concatenations are going to be and so grunt is always going to load its configurations for your different tasks in the same place and that is called the grunt innit config it'll all make sense here in just a second here so I'm copy and pasting this so This Grunt and knit config object right here holds all of our configuration for all of our tasks um and all these grunt redefined tasks are going to look in that config uh to know what to do uh so let's get rid of this options here we don't need a separator so basically grun contri concat is going to look at the concat part of the object and that's going to know that the configuration for concat is in there and so we're going to call this action of concat disc you can call it whatever you want you can call it happy we'll call it dist for distribution and let's go Js what did I call these one and two Js one. Js js2 doj and we're going to do build usually things will be called build for a built for a built project or dist for a distribution so build I think is a little bit more popular and we'll just call it js. or we'll just call it scripts.js it's not Min because it's not been minified yet so there we go so now since I did load npm tasks I can run grunt concat because that's what the npm task for grunt concat is so I can now run grunt concat there you go and file build script.js wh that should be called scripts.js so there we go there's a build folder that appeared now and there's a script that's got both of my files in it and that's pretty much it that was really really easy uh so let's go and tweak some things let's go build jscripts going to delete that folder go away and then let's make one we'll call this JS and then let's make this one CSS and so now you'll go CSS what are these two called Main and theme Let's Go full screen again CSS theme. CSS and you will go build CSS um styles CSS there we go so once again uh my grunt canat command comes from this it's loading it from the npm module and so concat is going to look at this and it's automatically going to run everything in here when I run grunt concat let's run it again we created scripts.js and we created Style .js so now my build folder is looking a little bit different we've got styles that has all my Styles awesome I was now able to break these up and I've got JS which is my script so these are the two that I'm actually going to deploy so now let's go to the next level with this and let's watch my file system for changes I don't want to have to run grunt concat every time I want to just be able to save this file boom and have it automatically do some changes so for that plugin we are going to go back a few and that's just called grunt contrib watch load them back there we go grunt contrib watch the grunt contrib ones are the ones that are made by the uh contributors to Grunt and so those are always trusted plugins those are always going to be good ones we're going to run this command here like I said with grunt you get really good at reading read me files and then we're going to load npm task grunt contrib watch connect to my grunt file there we go and then here's our watch example and so with watch it's going to watch for file system changes um and when that happens you get to run tasks so let's go we'll just keep it J we'll call it JS and this will be called JS star star which means any folder star which means any file ending injs so any file ending injs that's in the JS directory uh that's not really fully necessary but I want a little bit more control cuz I'm a controlling person whenever that happens we're going to run concats and then we're also going to remove options spawn and so there we go that's our JS and then we'll also do a CSS CSS and that will also run concat con cat's really fast so I can run that every time so now you'll know notice something different when I run grunt watch it runs and it just stays there forever uh because it's actually sitting actively waiting for me to make some changes let me hit save here um okay okay and that didn't work because I must have something wrong in my Js file here so let's see oh I have two things called Js there's my problem this one was overriding this one happens all the time uh so I'm going to hit contrl C to cancel out of that let's run grunt watch again and hit save there we go file js. one. JS was changed and so it redid them both and now let's try saving a CSS file awesome same thing so if I change this background to Pink then my build CSS now has that as a background of pink awesome terrible idea but it's awesome um and you can also go like this I can just run concat js on that let me cancel that and start that up again so now when I run JS it's only going to run the concat JS thing you'll notice it did not create a Styles CSS again it just created uh the JavaScript because it only ran this portion and so that's kind of why you'll give them a name so you can actually refer to portions of a task by name this will be concat CSS so the last things last thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go grunt register task default and this will run um this will run concats and this will run watch here we go let me zoom out so you can see that so I added a default task as well there and so once that's saved I can now cancel out of that and I can just run Grunt and that will start off doing the build right away uh which is good because we'll want to build it before we run our server the first time and now it's running watch as well so our build folder exists and we are now watching these for changes so if I get rid of the both of those okays it changes my scripts JS and it'll also build out my CSS let's go back to Red because pink is a terrible idea so there you go that your introduction to grunt hope you liked it and we'll get into the next part of our build in the next video bye
