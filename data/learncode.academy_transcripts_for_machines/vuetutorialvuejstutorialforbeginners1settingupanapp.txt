in this video we're going to learn how to use the vue.js framework it's one of the top three frameworks you should know these days and it's really simple to learn and fun to use it's a lot like angular in many ways but its simple nature makes it a lot more enjoyable especially for newer coders as a first framework so let's go ahead and get into it i have a html file here and that's going to reload onto this page here as i type and save so let's go ahead and start by using emmett to just get a basic html document set up let's say h1 my app and then let's actually make the app here so div with an id of app i give it an id of id let's change that to app so there we go that's my actual html document everything else will happen through vue.js in this id app here so let's go and get view on the page we can do that by adding a single script tag unpackage.com view and then let's add a javascript file here for us we'll add main js let's make that main.js file and there we go so view is on the page and then it's loading our main js and the rest of the app can happen in here since view is already on the page we can get started by going const app equals new view and we're just going to give it an empty object for now so now we have gone ahead and we have created our application but it's not mounting on the page anywhere so we want to tell it to mount to id app which is this div element here so let's go el and give it a string app so it's basically going to find that and then it will be mounted onto the page now let's go ahead and actually tell this application to create some html for us we can do that by specifying a template value and this can just be a string so we can say h1 hi and now our application will rerender and we will see that our app has boom said hello to us i'm going to actually change this to an es6 template string so i can go multiline and it'll be a lot easier so now i can go h1 like this hi what i cannot do is i cannot add two different elements without a wrapping tag you need to return one top level tag i'll show you what this means so hi and then this will fail hello you can see i'm going to get an error here in the console that says whoops seeing two tags here you can only return one root element so what you do in this case is you just return a div that has multiple elements inside of it as many as you want basically as long as you return one top level element you'll be good with your view template so let's do a little bit more before we end this video let's go ahead and create some data values and get those real time injecting into our application so if you create a data object this object can be as big or as small as you want it to be let's start real simple here let's just say name bobby age 25 so there we go we've created that object here and instead of saying hi hello let's say name and then you can use mustache syntax the template automatically gets these data values put in in a mustache type of syntax so i can say uh give me the name value and i can say give me the age value so now those will spit out right now we'll see name bobby age 25. you can also make this as deep as you want it to be so i could say bobby let's make a whole object just for him bobby boone and then let's say there's john here i don't know why i always use hillbilly names it just seems fun i guess so then we can actually say john.name and we say john.age so now we'll spit out john's name in john's age let's change this one down here to be bobby name bobby age so you can basically do as many dots as you want and keep going deeper and deeper into that data there we go so now we have john and bobby and we're spinning out their names and ages so i'll leave you at that for now for this video that's how you get started with your very first view app get it connected to the dom spit out some data in the next video we're going to look at how to use this data in a more complex way loop through items and interact with user events you
