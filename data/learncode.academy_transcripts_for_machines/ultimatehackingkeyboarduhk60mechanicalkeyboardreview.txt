ladies and gentlemen i have gotten my hands on the ultimate hacking keyboard uh k 60. it is a beautiful mechanical keyboard and it splits okay yes so you are looking at the uh k 60 it is ultimate hacking keyboards 60 mechanical keyboard 60 meaning it has no number keys and it also has no function keys it makes up for this by providing you with a concept of layers much like an ergodox keyboard does so you have your regular keys printed or blank i think blank is absolutely beautiful so had to go with blank so it gives you a regular layer and then you can toggle to another layer for your function keys another layer for your arrow keys another layer for all your custom hotkeys where one key can do any number of things or combination of keys yeah so fully programmable customizable a ton of fun and yes it splits so it can be a standard qwerty keyboard or much more of an ergonomic thing uh so let's go over some of the features first i've been using this keyboard for a month straight because i never want to talk about something that i haven't fully used as you all know almost everything seems cool when you first get it but after a little while you really know what you think about it so i really know what i think about this and i will let you know that as well so looking at the features first it does come with an optional actual real wood wrist rest which is an accessory that i think is an absolute must oh my goodness it it adds a lot of weight to the keyboard it adds a lot of stability to it and it really just adds a lot of beauty to the frame that you already get which in my opinion is already a really pretty frame frame comes in black white red orange i think that's all the colors there might be one or two more so you have some color options with the frame the frame also does have some leds here to show which layer you are on there's some small little things that say you're on the mod function or mouse layer and there's also three leds that say what general mode your keyboard is in because you can customize it to have several different modes for colmac or dvorak or any of that stuff it is connected by basically a phone cable fun story my eightyearold saw me plugging it in and said whoa cool invention of a cable that has a little plastic clip on it yeah he'd never seen a phone cable before fun times and it splits obviously this construction is extremely solid and by extremely solid i mean this is the most solid feeling keyboard i have ever laid my hands on immediately i realized how plasticky clacky almost every other mechanical keyboard sounds and feels and it's not to do with the key switches and keycaps it has to do with the casing that you connect them to so you might even be able to hear those are browns or kale coppers in this case so a tactile key and instead of a clacky click they have more of a nice calming thud to them because what you're getting in this case is you're getting a metal backing plate you're getting metal connectors so when it's connected it is stable and very pleasing very satisfying to connect it together because it's basically steel rods going into steel posts to support them even the wrist rests that you get the wooden wrist rests connect to a metal backing plate that screws into metal receivers so all in all the construction of this keyboard is remarkably sound just way more solid than any keyboard i have ever used that right off the bat first impression when i started touching the keyboard was wow this feels phenomenal also you'll notice that it's your standard staggered key qwerty keyboard so in my mind when you start getting into a layered keyboard like this the number one decision you have to make is do you want to go with the switch from staggered right where the layers stagger on the top compared to the row behind them or do you want to go with linear or ortho linear where each layer is exactly in a row with one before it i've historically really liked ergodox keyboards because of the linear layout and strangely enough i find myself liking this keyboard as potentially my favorite keyboard of all time and by potentially here's here's what i would say if you are not dead certain that you are a brave person and want to try crazy new layouts like the ergodox provides with thumb clusters and all the other stuff that an ergodox type of keyboard gives you you should buy this mechanical keyboard if you're looking to get in mechanical keyboards here's exactly why i would say that is because you're starting off connected standard qwerty you're going to be able to go from 0 to 60 and get comfortable in it in no time whereas an ergodox type of style layout you're talking minimum two weeks probably more like six weeks till you fully feel comfortable i felt comfortable on this immediately because it's a standard qwerty layout and then as i got more comfortable i was able to split it apart maybe try some more strange and unusual keyboard layouts and key mappings which brings me to one of my absolute favorite things about this keyboard is the visual keymapper software is the best in its class absolutely the best i've ever encountered while many other keyboards have really good key mapping software you download an actual software app that runs on your computer you open it up click click click change some key mappings and hit save you don't have to find a little paper clip and punch a little button to go into dfu mode where you can program it you basically just open the app change the key mappings hit save and your keyboard is updated absolutely phenomenal and seamless because the number one thing you want to do on a keyboard like this is customize and hack and change your key combinations and your hot keys all the time so you get an opportunity to do that with this keyboard it's it's not frustrating it's extremely seamless it takes because of not having to put it into firmware update mode it honestly takes about a quarter of the time to make small changes which is really really nice um it also comes with some tenting keys let's see if you can see them here it's got some tenting keys that you can either put all on the back row for a vertical tenting front to back or you can put them on the insides here making for a center to edge tenting the only gripe that i would actually have about the hardware of this keyboard is it's really tiny little screws to unscrew these tenting uh pegs and try them out on a different layout or different location it's not super easy to do but it's not like you have to do that every day once you find that you like it this way or that way or the optional tent forward option which i don't think i'd ever go for the tents forward option but once you you know try out those three options find out what you like you don't really ever change it so it's not that big of a gripe that was honestly my only nitpick out of everything even where you plug in the usb cord it's indented in here underneath has a little wire catch so if your kid walks by and really trips on that cable it's not going to rip it out of the keyboard worst case scenario you're going to bend and put a kink in the cable because it's got a little cable kink right there for you so a lot of thought has been put into this keyboard absolutely making it a to die for phenomenal keyboard they are coming out with some really cool thumb clusters uh like a mouse and a trackball type of things uh for these sides they haven't come out with them yet but it looks like those are getting really close to making it into production those would be pretty interesting as well especially for the people that go for split i mean once i go for a split keyboard i never go back to together i just am a huge fan of split keyboards once you get past that initial learning curve of liking i mean putting your coffee in the middle i don't need to say anymore so having that thumb cluster there for making mousing easier pretty cool last thing i'd like to highlight and show off is they have these extra little clicks right here below the space bar on each side there's a button built into the actual frame of the keyboard and you also have two separate space bars so you can make space bar do space on your right hand and the click do space on your left hand while this does a much more useful function for those of you guys who use either your right or your left thumb mostly for spacing but in my opinion as soon as i saw those i was like well these are my layer toggles right there layer two layer three and then cap slot key for layer four and boom you can easily get to all four of your layers it was a really quick setup for me made it really simple to get to what i want to do i have my mousing layer my function keys layer and then all my custom hotkeys layers all in all i have really nothing negative to say about this keyboard and i have a lot of positives it is the extraordinary build quality makes it enjoyable from the day from making it pretty much my one of my favorite two mechanical keyboards of all time if you had to pick and you weren't sure if you wanted a risky unusual layout like some of those unusual keyboards that are out there i would say get this keyboard as a first run mechanical keyboard for the price point you honestly can't build a quality keyboard for the price that you can have them just build it and ship it to you anyway it's just getting the parts and the key switches and the keycaps alone you're gonna be spending as much or more than this to build one yourself and it probably will not be made as well so i'm a huge fan uhk you've made me a phenomenal fan thanks for the demo piece to try out for this video and i hope you guys enjoyed watching have a good day you
