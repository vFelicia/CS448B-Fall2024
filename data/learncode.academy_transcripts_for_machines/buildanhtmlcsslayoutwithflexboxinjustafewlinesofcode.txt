in this course we are learning web development from the absolute beginning and if you've missed any of the other videos the link to the whole course is in the description so moving forward here in the last video we used margin and padding to create our basic containers for our entire web page and all the content that will go in those containers in this video we're going to learn how to actually finish our layout by using different display styles different display properties in css i'll show you how we're going to do this and what those display properties are by creating three divs here in this triple section so i'm gonna do div times three and hit tab that's a nice little thing we can do and i get to also tab i'm gonna hit a tab b tab c tab and now whoops there we go and now i actually have some content in there so i'm going to go ahead and save this you can see by default they get what's called a block layout and i'm going to start showing you um how this all works in css and how we can change that default display i'm just going to target every single div on the page since i only have three divs right now and let's go and give them a background color of red that way i can actually see what i'm dealing with so you can see that by default a div fills out its entire container if you remember this section has a padding of 20 pixels on all sides so the actual inside of the container starts here and goes all the way over to here and a div by default gets what's called display block you see if i change it to display block nothing happens because it's already display block i can change this display mode to several different things i can make display inline display inline is going to put them all one in a row and each box will be the size of its content so if a gets a lot more a's in it then it gets larger but what i cannot do with display inline is actually set a width so i can't say this is 100 pixels wide it's not going to do anything display inline totally looks at the content inside of that div and sizes itself accordingly so if you actually want to make it a fixed width you can do inline block and now i can set those to be 100 pixels wide so now each one of them is 100 pixels wide because they're in line but it's also a block and i get to tell that block how wide and how tall to be i can also give it a height of 20 pixels so then it's going to be 20 pixels tall which it looks like they're already kind of that high just because the text so you have block and you have inline block and another fun display which is much more complicated is called flex what you have to do for flex is you have to add it to the parent container so whatever the parent of all these divs is that is the section tag you're going to want to make that display flex so there we go we have display flex on there and i'm going to go ahead get rid of inline block here just going to leave those block and you can see that flex automatically does an inline block type of thing here so we're going to do then is we're going to go flex direction and you have several options here you can do row you can do column you can do reverse row so let's make it row and that's what the default is you can also do row dash reverse which is not nearly as useful and actually does something a little unusual it takes the first div and puts it all the way on the right and then goes backwards from there you can also tell the flex direction to be column and that's going to go top to bottom and as you guessed you can do column reverse which seems even less useful let's take our top div and put it on the bottom and go backwards from there but it does have its purposes i'm sure to some people somewhere on the earth so let's go back to flex direction row which is kind of our default we just have to do one little magic thing margin auto and now boom it's automatically going to be flexed across the whole width so if i stretch my window out here you can see the boxes stay a hundred pixels wide but they're always going to be flexed across the entire content and the margins are automatically taken care of we have a half margin here a half margin here another half margin you can see that it just looks correct it looks the way that it should work there's a lot more options with flexbox that you can do display flex is called flexbox that's we're doing what's called a flexbox layout in here that's very important that you know that and so that's how we're going to account for those three divs that we have going on i'm going to get rid of some extra a's here so let's go and move on to a navigation how would we handle a navigation it's a little bit different we actually want to use inline block instead so let's go over to this header here and let's add a few tags in here let's add an h1 tag we'll call it title let's also add a nav tag nav is a semantic tag so it doesn't do anything it's just a div and so what's inside of this we're gonna do a ul with three lis let's do a ul and i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do a greater than symbol li times three that says hey give me a ul and inside of that ul give me three lis boom so that's done right there let's say this is gonna be our navigation home uh locations and contacts let's say we're going to make a website for a bakery maybe they'll make awesome cupcakes or something like that who doesn't love cupcakes so this is going to be our top navigation and then this will be our title here so let's go ahead and style this navigation properly i'll go ahead here and do a ul and the ul is basically let's do a margin of zero ul's by default have some margin and padding to them padding of zero and i want these bullet points to go away so i'm going to do list style type none that's the magic word for making all those bullets go away we want no list style type so that's our ul and then the allies i'm going to give them a display inline block and now they're going to lay out boom boom just how we'd expect them to lay out i can also give them a margin let's give them a margin of 20 pixels now we are set up of course we have a left margin here so i don't really want that i have a couple choices for what i can do here i can give them a 0 top 20 pixel right 0 and 0 which also accounts for basically we're only adding margin right or i can also explicitly say margin dash rights is 20 pixels and do that as well that is the exact same thing so you can also specify margins by just picking one value you want to change so as you can see it's starting to look like a website but there's a few things we need to do from here first of all we need to actually learn how to make multiple pages because we're going to need a locations page and a contact page and we're also going to need to css target a little differently this rule right here for instance will apply to every div on our entire page and that's not correct so in the next lesson we are going to learn how to build out the rest of that website with multiple pages and target css in a better way you
