all right so I'm going to be doing five videos for you here um and they're going to be the five things that make JavaScript super weird uh but also that make JavaScript awesome these are five of the most misunderstood or barely understood or not even understood things about JavaScript uh they're going to be very useful very very useful if you're new to JavaScript and and honestly lots of intermediate developers still don't grasp these things very well so we're going to be covering I'm going to do a video on each so you can rewatch it they build on each other um for the most part they all build on each other and so you'll want to rewatch it till you kind of get it uh and then move on with each one so let's get into the first one uh one of the first things that makes JavaScript weird is first class functions what this means is that functions can be passed as arguments and if you don't understand it you're not going to understand why a lot of the javascrip JavaScript syntax is the way it is let me show it and code it's a lot more easy you know a lot easier to understand uh let's go make a function called add uh first second um and all this is going to do is console.log first plus second all right there we go and let's do something let's go add 2+ 3 let's add 4 plus 5 let's hit save and there we go I don't know if that's big enough for you uh but we we console log 2 + 3 and we console log 4 + 5 now let let's add a third one called call back um and this is something you see a ton in jcer whatever the optional last argument is a callback function to fire when it's done and so let's create a function here um and this one we will console log done so there we go and now I need to do something with call back here so I'll go call back and I'm going to actually fire it when I'm done with my addition here so what I've done is I've given it argument one and to our numbers argument three is a function I'm creating right now um and I'm passing that function up here it's not firing yet it's being passed as an argument that add is going to hold on to it's going to do everything it needs to do which in this case is just addition and then it's going to fire that function later as a call back uh let me show you what this is going to do so now it's going to say it's going to console log 2+ three and then it's going to console log done so let me actually create another one here and this is going to console log done again so this is going to do the exact same thing it doesn't care what your callback function is it's just going to fire it when you're done so it's going to console log 2+ 3 done conso log 4 + 5 and then it's going to fire my other function again and so that is what it means to pass a function a function is a first class um object uh and so here's kind kind of another way to look at it is a function is basically a variable I can go function um uh log done and that will console log done there we go and so now I can actually pass log done and let's go ahead and mute that guy so there you go exact same thing I'm creating a function here called log done I'm passing it as if it was a variable because to JavaScript it is a variable um and so I'm passing log done in it's going to get it's now going to be Associated his call back and it'll get fired whenever and honestly in jQuery uh what you're actually seeing is something more like this if call back then fire call back so that way you don't have to pass call back I can just do console log 4 five here there you go so now it's going to do 2+ 3 fire the call back cuz it exists fire 4 + 5 and don't fire the call back cuz it doesn't exist um and so that's kind of a little bit closer to what's going on it's more complicated than that but if you want to build your own callbacks that's a nice way to make them optional um and so that's what it means for them to be first class functions so in jQuery when you're doing stuff like my div uh click function you're actually creating a function right there that you're passing to the click and it's not going to do anything with it until the click event fires um and that's why you can also go uh function handle click you know do something smart there something smart um and then you can actually go handle click and that looks a lot cleaner there that's a lot of cleaner way to do a lot of your jQuery um and that kind of leads us into uh video number two which is event driven envir enement let's get into that
