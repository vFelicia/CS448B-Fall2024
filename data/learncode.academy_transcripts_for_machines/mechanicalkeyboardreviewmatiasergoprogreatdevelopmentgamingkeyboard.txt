hey guys over the next couple videos I'm going to be talking to you about mechanical organ ama keyboards now mechanical keyboards for those you guys who are not in the know are basically really premiumgrade keyboards most keyboards these days cheap out on the key switches and give you rubber dome key switches now what's different about that is you don't feel the key press until you've maxed out all the way and hit the bottom just picture a rubber dome and when you press you eventually get enough force to pop it down and so when you've hit all the way to the bottom that's when the key is pressed and you also feel that pressure of bottoming out well mechanical key switches take cues from the olden days and they actually have a key switch that activates before you bottomed out and you feel it usually with a tactile force there's a lot of options and they give you this old kind of keyboard feel but they also give you this really premium kind of keyboard feel so today I'm going to be talking about a really cool one I kind of custom selected two of them and I really do mean a custom selected two keyboards to bring to you guys one of them is the matias / gopro keyboard i have the mac version here they also have a pc version but this is the matias a gopro and it is very cool for one as you can clearly see it can split into two which i love a keyboard that can now allow me to split out as my hands naturally rest which is something like this it also gives you the ability to keep your coffee in the middle which is actually surprisingly addictive and very useful to have in the middle of the day your coffee close you can also keep papers and notes and stuff in the middle you can also just make adjustments as your day goes on which is very cool and so this is also it feels much better on the wrists much more natural as you go this keyboard again it's Mattias ergo Pro keyboard I'll just kind of go through some of the specs and and why you might actually be interested in this besides the wow factor the fact that it splits apart for one there's just not a lot of great keyboards that are ergonomically dynamic but not a lot of great ones this one is definitely right away what I would classify as a great keyboard for several reasons one it's a mechanical keyboard as I mentioned before so the key switches are phenomenal and these ones are actually the Mattias quiet click which are arguably some of the best mechanical key switches in the business and they're amazing for two reasons one they give you a very very tactile response you feel that key press before you bottom out so as you get better and better on the keyboard you actually type lighter and lighter but you still get actually more response than if you were typing on a normal keyboard so that's very very cool and then it's also a very quiet tense the quiet click the Mattias quiet click key but it's also one of the best keys for office use which is one of the reasons I selected this as a great keyboard to demo to you guys because a lot of y'all are in an office setting and if you'd be interested in a mechanical keyboard they have a reputation for being loud and clicky which of course if your work from home err one of those guys whose beard is down to your knees and you've never showered or seen humanity for weeks that's awesome go with the clicky it feels incredible to have like a cherry MX blue where every key press gives you this satisfying click but that's just not a keyboard for most of us we really we work around coworkers and we're generally nice people and so we need something that's a little quieter so the Mattias quiet click Keys are one of the best choices of all time for a great office friendly mechanical key switch mechanical quick key switches are also rated to just millions and millions and millions a minute like 15 million clicks or something like that this thing is gonna last forever some other really great features about it are these palm rests these things are really nice they are stable and so the second you feel you feel like you have your own desk space that is attached to your keyboard and they also get several tinting options you can tent them a little bit of an angle which I personally love feels really nice you can also tint front down and both backs for kind of a negative forward angle I think that's a four and a half degree and if memory serves this is a nine degree tinting angle and so you can kind of have some options throughout the day as time goes on and then if your mother comes to her in your house or your grandmother's visiting it needs to update or Twitter and doesn't know how to use a split keyboard it does come straight together like that so very good very useful it's kind of a normal keyboard with the option of a great split keyboard now I will have to mention that they do have to plug together so in the spirit of clicky keyboards you get this nice clicky connector which connects them right there and then it connects with one USB some notable changes that they made to the normal keyboard layout aside from being split is that they gave you these dedicated undo cut copy paste buttons and they really reworked the navigation portion as a code or something use all the time as navigating with keys around the screen especially when you're in the terminal and mouse is just not very useful and this is very nice you have your home end page up page down right next to your arrow keys which makes for a very very nice experience as you're often needing to navigate around the screen so that's the Mattias ergo kirgo pro keyboard it's just a great keyboard some other cool features about it as laseretched keys so these are never ever ever going to wear off they're laser etched they don't wear off and it also has n key rollover which any really fast typist will appreciate because you probably noticed that when you're typing really really fast there's a problem with modern keyboards and that they'll actually drop key presses when too many keys are pressed at the same time well n key rollover does defeat that that quirk and so as fast as you want to go this keyboard will have no problems keeping up with you let's wrap this review up with a great sound test so you can hear exactly how cool these keys are and hopefully give you a sense of just how good they feel but before I get to that I'll just kind of give you my personal experience on it I've been coding on this keyboard all week straight since I got my hands on it for review and it feels so good I mean I have for years was just a longtime fan of just a good old Apple what they call chiclet keyboards you know just nice quiet easy to do but I'll tell you what when you get when you get your hands on a mechanical keyboard and use it for a while you find yourself never wanting to go back day 1 day 2 you're fine day three you start to really kind of get addicted to that tactile a nice tactile feeling day four day five day six you find yourself getting very frustrated on a chiclet keyboard so let's get into some sound clips there's my review retailing I said right around 200 bucks it's not this massive dent to your wallet compared to a computer and you get to take it with you to every computer you own from here on out it's a great keyboard and I am NOT just saying that it is a phenomenal keyboard I'm not getting paid to tell you guys that the Mattias ergo Pro let's listen to some sound clips
