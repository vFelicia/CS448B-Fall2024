ladies and gentlemen i'm like a developer at christmas time my favorite keyboard of all time my daily driver keyboard came out with an upgrade an upgrade that i've been wanting to see it have for a long time the ergodoxyz came out with backlit keycaps and they are kale keycaps kailh which i've never seen and i'm really excited to get my hands on this keyboard let's do it okay so again backlit keycaps have arrived on the ergodocs and i feel like it's important to say straight up at the beginning i don't get paid anything to do these reviews uh no affiliate coupons no nothing um so it's totally just my opinions i love these keyboards and whenever i can get my hands on their latest greatest i'm happy to show it to everybody so again they have backlit keycaps and kale keycaps which i've been wanting to try for a long time really mixed reviews on kale keycaps some people love them some people hate them i'm gonna stop talking and open this thing i have saved all the joy for this video because i love you guys so as always they're packaging their packaging is always great i mean their packaging is always super cool like appleesque they've got this nice little plasticky cover um and here she is in all of her glory people we've got the right side and left side now if you guys have not seen any of my other videos talking about these keyboards these are super ergonomic ortho linear fully programmable keyboards or ortho linear means they are straight they're not like angled like circa 1983 or whatever like all the other keyboards have been for the last hundred years these are actually the way our fingers want to be when they type and you can program any key to be absolutely any key any modifier any combination of keys you can do layers all sorts of cool things you can do with the ergodox keyboard the ergodox is not unique to ergodox ez they're just the only people mass manufacturing it at scale and in a good quality that i'm aware of i've seen some other companies but i'm not sure how good they are and these guys are doing it right let's get this guy plugged in and then i'll mess with the keycaps i'm really excited to feel the keycaps but i'm really also excited to see it glow so uh let's get this plug in okay we're plugged in and you don't see anything yet uh because i've got to turn on these animations now i've changed my keyboard layout but i believe yep there we go got it boom color backlit now i have super bright video lighting on um so i'm gonna i'm gonna get that video lighting turned off chad hit the lights okay there we go we got most of the lighting off you can see i got this lovely red by default and i'm pretty positive i can change through the hue yep i can change to any hue that i'd like also any brightness and then i should have a bunch of animations here by pressing this button rainbow flavor and it's changing it's animating okay lovely like i've always wanted the backlit keycaps to land on the ergodox ez and these are absolutely beautiful all sorts of like twinkling effects and crazy rainbows and slow rainbows and all sorts of cool stuff and then the solid colors and you can fully customize this to do anything you want now one of the things i've had in mind thinking of this i'm gonna get the lights back on chad lights one of the things i've been thinking about this is because you can customize anything about the ergodox is it'd be kind of cool to see notifications up here in colors like if you have a meeting showing up or various notifications you want i'm interested in seeing if i can get that programmed i may circle back we'll see how much free time i have i have twin newborns i don't have a lot of free time right now but this thing is cool okay now for the key switches let's let's pretend to type here these feel to me like my favorite key switch of all time which is the mattias quiet click key switch um yeah yes okay so my favorite key switch of all time hands down is the matthias quiet click it's very unique i'm sure not everyone loves it but i absolutely love it it's it's got a very gentile tactile bump very gentile gentle tactile bump you can feel it on there but it's super gentle and when you bottom out it's really really quiet and that is exactly what these feel like let me give you for context my daily driver keyboard exact same keyboard but gator on browns tactile um that okay you can even you can even hear the difference it's more less of a clack and more of like a clud thuddy clack less of a click and more like and i'm loving loving loving that i would absolutely a thousand times over pick the kale key switches over the gatoron browns and over cherry mx key switches i like wouldn't even think about it i these are these key switch that i love these feel so similar and it's been a while because i i don't own a mattias quiet click but they in my mind they're giving me the emotional feeling that i had when i used to use that um and i'm loving this and my wife will like it too because it's at least half the volume of gator on browns already oh i'm loving this keyboard i like want to do a happy dance right now like okay um i don't know what else there is to say except for maybe a couple features that people might not have seen if they haven't watched my other ones the tenting on these things are awesome they've got these little tenting pegs that are adjustable multiple directional and you can kind of tent it to your liking and it also comes with the wings wings um which are super cool they're like a very solid rubbery thing and uh they go right there and your wrists can rest on them but i'm not going to take the time to unbox them right now honestly not too much else to say i'm just like throwing stuff going crazy not too much else to say except for this thing is super cool the custom printed keycaps where you see the glowing coming straight through i mean that's that's a nice touch they feel awesome which is good because i would have been kind of depressed if there's this great new backlit feature but the key key switches feel terrible um the the quality of the keycaps themselves i think might have some to contribute to the niceness of how it feels and i'm really excited to use this stinky keyboard every day nothing else to say except for i love the ergodox keyboard in general it's worth the approximately one to four weeks it takes to learn to retype differently with custom programmed hotkeys and all that stuff but super fun i'll put a link in the description to where you can get this guy and i could wholeheartedly recommend this keyboard it's a blast already i'm want to go code now and stop talking to you guys so we'll see around on the internet have a good day do you
