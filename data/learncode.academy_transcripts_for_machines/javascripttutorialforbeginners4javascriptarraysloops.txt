so we've been learning JavaScript and I want to point out again that pretty much everything you've learned so far is programming in general almost every computer programming language is going to have variables IFL statements comparison operators functions and what we're about to learn which is arrays and Loops um and I've got one more lesson for you here we're going to cover arrays and loops and then you're going to be able to do some fun stuff in the browser to change your web page so let's just get into it once again I'm using the main JS file which I've added onto my index.html and we're going to be doing our coding in here so an array is simply a list of items I can go there my list equals and then I do open and close of square brackets now whatever I put in here is a part of my array so I can go apples oranges bananas and so now I've got my console open over here again because I want to interact with this list so if I go my list not defined let me go ahead and save this oh I didn't turn on live reload for this lesson I apologize save refresh my list there you go you can see we've got apples oranges and bananas now if I want to access a specific item on this list I can go my list zero to get the Zero Entry one of the things you learn in computer science is that uh web developer and just developers in general pretty much count from zero 0 1 2 and that's kind of a long explanation as to why so I'm not going to explain it but the zero index would be apples the one index or the first index would be oranges and the number two index would be bananas so if I want to access my list one that's oranges and bananas would be my list two if I go my list three that's undefined because it hasn't been defined yet so let's go ahead and add that in my list three which you can add after you've created the list equals pineapples let's go ahead save it's going to refresh my list three now equals pineapples let's say I want to change index zero to be something else my list zero equals watermelon so here you go so now if I were to go my list I've added index 3 and I've changed index one that's basically how you're going to change values um and it's important to note that these values Don't Have To Be Strings arrays can hold any type in JavaScript they can hold strings numbers functions even other arrays so I can go my list equals apples the number 12 and let's create a function up here here go alert high that's the one I've been using might as well stick to it I'm just going to add go in there you notice go is a variable name because functions are actually variables as far as JavaScript is concerned so now if I look at my list in the console apples 12 and the function go so that's pretty much an example of the fact that arrays can hold anything and if I actually want to access this fun fun and call it well I can either call go which is going to alert or go is in my array so I can go my list to and that I can run it just like I can a function and that's exactly the same as changing these letters to go so I'm accessing it and then I'm calling it so that's kind of you know it's a little quirky you really wouldn't do that but once again arrays can hold anything or I can make this array hold a new array of will Laura there we go so now if I look at my list it's got apples 12 and an array of names will is the zero index Laura is the one index great now arrays have what's called what are called Methods or better yet actions that you can run on arrays let's go back to Apples oranges bananas let's save that let's get rid of you so I can go my list dot shift and that will give me the first entry off of my list and it will actually pull it out of the list so now the list has one less entry if I look at my list now apples has been pulled out and oranges and bananas are all that remain so now I can go my list shift again so I could say their current fruit equals my list. shift there we go now current fruit will equal oranges because that was at the front of the stack in my list only has one item left so once again shift pulls your first item out actually removes it from your list and passes it to whatever your function passes it to whatever variable is on the other side of your function let's go back let's refresh my page my list is now back to normal there's also a pop method pop is going to pull the last value off of the list and it's going to actually remove it so now my list has two entries the first and the second and bananas is gone now there's also a very cool method called for each and for each you pass it a function and it's automatically going to put two arguments into this function for you it's going to give you a value and an index for each item it's going to Loop through this and it's going to run my function then it's going to run this value run the function then it's going to take this value and run the function so I can console log value index and I should see three console logs apples zero oranges one bananas 2 or a more useful way of doing it would be alert I have plus value Plus in my shopping bag I have apples in my shopping bag I have oranges in my shopping bag I have bananas in my shopping bag now one Quirk with JavaScript is older browsers are not going to have all the newer methods for each is a newer method um and not every browser has it so if you're running this on an older browser you might get an error message that says for each is not defined um and so what you're actually going to have to do is you're going to have to use an older way of looping through or iterating through this list so let's get into now the second part of of this lesson which is loops loops are well they're just what they sound like they're ways of looping through things over and over again and there's three kinds of Loops in JavaScript there's the while loop a do Loop and a for Loop let's look at each one of these what's it doing who knows so let's do the while loop they're all very similar by the way they just have a little bit different way of going about it as long as what's in here is true y will execute whatever's in this block whatever's between these curly braces so what I could do is I could say ver times equals z and while times is less than 10 let's console log tried it let's let's also spit out times just so we can see and let's say times equals time + 1 so now it's going to make it if it's zero it's going to bump it up one if it's one it's going to bump it up to two let's see what happens we tried it when times was zero and then we bumped it up now we tried it in times was one tried it when times was two we tried it all the way up till times was nine and when times was 10 we didn't try it anymore the while stopped it did what's called a break and so as long as this is true again it's going to run this block of code another way we can simplify this is we can just go times plus plus which is code for bump it up one more if it's zero make it one if it's one make it two another thing you can do is Javas in JavaScript is you can do minus minus which basically minus is one from whatever it is so times plus plus there we go that's going to do the exact same thing so that's a while loop uh there's also a do while loop or a do Loop you don't see this one as often and that's basically the same thing so I'm going to go console log tried it times and then I'm going to do same thing times plus plus and I'm going to go while times is less than 10 exact same thing and you'll notice it does the exact same thing tried it zero tried it one tried two try it three the difference pretty much the only difference between do and while is do is going to always run at least one time and then it's going to do a check to see if this is true or false so you're guaranteed one execution and it might stop after that whereas while is going to run the check first and if that's false then it's not ever going to run if it's true it's going to run over and over and over again until it's false so that's doing while they're very very very similar so the last Loop is the four Loop and the four Loop is the most common one you're going to see in JavaScript but unfortunately it's the most complicated one if you're just starting out it's not really hard per se it's just not quite as simple as the while loop and the do while loop so what you have in the for Loop is you have three arguments you have your setup you have your comparison and then you have your change this is what's going to happen every time it goes through the loop so here's kind of the common for Loop that you're going to see you're going to see there I equals 0 and then you're going to go I less than 10 so as long as I is less than 10 that's our comparison that's what would be in our while and then we're going to do i++ every time so we're starting off we're going to run this once we're going to check is I less than 10 yes it is we're going to run our Loop and every time we run our loop we're going to bump I up one more time and so let's console log this I is and then let's do I let's run this and see what happens you see that I is currently zero we started off I is zero and then it's going to run my block and then it's going to bump I up one more time then it's going to run it again hey is I less than 10 nope I mean yes it is run the block bump I up one more time is I still less than 10 yep run the block bump it up that keeps happening until I is no longer less than 10 and then it breaks so this is useful because we can actually make I the length of our array I'll kind of show you what we mean here let's make my list and then we're almost done with our lesson and I'm using capital letters now nice these are proper proper nouns there we go so I have apples oranges and bananas so I'm going to say I equals z and as long as I is less than my list. length GTH there you go then I'm going to do that so now it's going to run three times let me show you what my list. length is my list. length is three because I have three items in my list now that seems a little strange because I have a zero index one index 2 index you would think length would be two but length is three because when it comes to Dot length we're counting like a normal humid would count three items in my list so three items a zero a one and a two index I know that's confusing but whatever that's JavaScript so as long as I is less than the length of my array I'm going to Loop through and so what I can do now is I can go console log my list I so the first time around that'll be zero Second Time Around it'll be one Second Time Around it'll be two and there is no next time around I think I said first second second first second third you can see apples oranges bananas and then I'm done so I can do the exact same thing alert you have my list DOI or brackets ey in your basket there we go you have apples in your basket you have oranges in your basket and you have bananas in your basket so that's a for Loop now you can pretty much copy and paste this code and that's something that you can use anytime you want to iterate an array that's the most common for Loop I'll usually when I started off I copied and I pasted this away and I saved it because I just couldn't quite remember the order in the syntax were these commas were these semicolons it's something you just have to use several times to really get fortable with save this somewhere as a snippet of code that you reuse later that's arrays that's loops and in the next lesson we're going to use functions arrays and Loops to do some fun stuff
