So today we're going to get into how to do web development now and I want to draw a quick distinction before we get into stuff what's the difference between web design and web development uh and basically web design is more graphic design it means you work with Photoshop you make the look in the feel of the web page and then you give it to a developer they're going to take your look and feel and they're going to make the actual web page for you um the designers don't tend to get paid as much uh they don't tend to uh have as much opportunity to work remotely I used to be a designer and I moved on to development because it was just a better career to get into uh so that's kind of the difference also it's cheaper to be a web developer you don't have to buy $1,000 worth of Adobe Photoshop software uh all you need is notepad that's right notpad um except for you'll probably want to get something better than notepad we are going to be using Sublime Text um which is one of the best notepad kind of editors out there and it's free so go ahead go download Sublime text pause the video come back when you got it fired up and we're going to build a web page so what we're going to do is we're going to start by creating a new file in Sublime Text and saving it as index.html as you see here um we're basically you can call it whatever you want but the fact that we're calling it HTML means that when we open it up in Chrome it's going to know that it's a web page so it's going to show it as an HTML web page um and today we're going to be learning HTML uh later we're going to be learning CSS which is another skill you need to learn to be a web developer um and then later on you're going to learn JavaScript uh JavaScript is what uh HTML is what puts the content together for your page uh but it's going to be ugly because it's just content CSS is what puts together your style it stands for castaing cascading stylesheets so basically it gives look feel and style to your web page uh uh but we're not going to cover that today so what we're going to make today is ugly be prepared we're going to get into style later and then JavaScript is fun function it makes the web page do cool things uh load in data real time just like Pinterest does and like Instagram it makes things move around and animate JavaScript is where things get fun uh it's also where uh you get paid better if you learn HTML CSS uh you know you you get paid fine you get paid normal but if you get really good at JavaScript people are really looking for people are good at JavaScript you can get paid quite a bit and it's a lot easier to get remote work uh or very flexible work so with no further Ado we let's get into making an HTML page so you've saved your index.html now go to Chrome and open file open your index.html file where you saved it um mine shows Local Host because I'm using live reload basically whatever I type it's automatically going to refresh over here for me automatically for you you're going to have to hit save you're going to have to come over to Chrome you're going to have to hit refresh uh but I for the sake of this video I'm doing it differently so let's build an HTML page uh the core of HTML is tags basically that's all there is to HTML is tags a tag is basically something surrounded by greater than and less than kind of quotes and so this is an HTML tag and this is a closing HTML tag pardon me if you can hear my baby crying somewhere way in the background um I'm not sure what's going on out there but I'm sure Mom will take care of it um said like a good dad right so here we have HTML opening tag HTML closing tag uh tags are a little awkward to type at first because they use those keys down towards the bottom right that you don't use very often but I promise you'll get fast very quickly so basically anything in between these HTML tags is considered within the HTML tags um there's basically three tags that you're going to use to create a web page there's an HTML which means hey this is my HTML page anything inside of this is considered your web page um you're going to make a head tag which we'll get into in a little bit and you're going to make a body tag whatever's in the body tag is what your user will see and interact with so I'm going to put in here hello world and now I have a web page congratulations you're web developer and you're probably thinking wow this is kind of complicated it's all this code looking stuff don't worry it looks like a foreign language at first but seriously within five times you're going to feel very comfortable there's only like 10 tags maybe 20 at the most you're going to use and they're all tags you just have to remember a different word so far all we've actually done is created three tags we made an HTML tag we put a head tag with inside of it and we put a body tag with inside of it as well and these are considered siblings they're next to each other I'm also going to add a title tag tag and inside of the title I'm going to put my web page and I can't type today my web page and now you look at the top when you refresh it says my web page at the top of your web page or your tab so once again the head is not what the user interacts with this is all reserved for other stuff um which is why the title goes up there and so the body is what the user interacts with and we did hello world and the rest of our example will be adding other tags in here so let me show you kind of some other tags this is bold so we're going to wrap bold it's called wrapping it in B tags and now you can see that bold is bold because I wrapped it in B which stands for bold em is what we're going to use for italic and uh em basically stands for emphasis it used to be people would use I it also works but that is not the correct way to do it anymore um do not show a prospective employer that cuz it's not good so B is for bold em is for italic and then um let's see actually strong I can't believe I did this strong is what we're going to use for bold we used to use B and we used to use I and we used to use U for underline but now we use strong for bold and we use em for italics and we started doing this when we started getting into mobile devices and devices that might not actually have the capability of rendering bold or italics and so we needed some other way to let the user know or maybe it's a screen reader uh that you should display it in whatever way you can so but for the most part strong is always bold em is always italic that's about all you need to know so we've covered bold and italic now let's get into a critical tag the a tag that makes a hyperlink to another web page when you click on it so we're going to make a google.com and guess what it doesn't go anywhere uh that's because it doesn't know where to go uh one thing that some tags need is what's called attributes we've defined an a tag but this a tag doesn't know enough about itself to know where to go we know what's inside of it google.com text but we need to know where to go so we're going to add an href attribute you add an attribute by doing equals and then a pair of quotes and whatever's inside of the quotes is setting the hre so google.com there you go and look magically now I'm underlined and I have that purple color because I've been to google.com before and look I can now go back and forth from google.com to my web page all like that you're now a web developer it's tremendous so let's do another tag an IMG for image and this one needs to know what the source of the image is I'll leave that blank for now and that's all an image tag is for the source I'm going to go look something up on Google and let's just look up an image of Simon cow sure everybody loves Simon right why not let's view image I'm going to copy the URL why won't you let me close I don't know okay my computer's acting strange hit save and look there we go google.com link and a nice link to Simon cow's web website see if I can close this there we go um so basically that's your core tags uh another thing you'll probably notice is is these are not coming onto new lines like we've typed them out at first that doesn't make sense and it seems very bad uh but later on you'll realize it's very very good how HTML works is is it does not recognize anything except for how you program it to go so unless you say it with tags it doesn't know what to do and that's because these things can get huge or sometimes they'll get word wrapping like this and it just doesn't know what to do so it's not going to make any guesses for you if you don't say line break which is a br tag it doesn't line break so there we go I added a br tag and now it's bold whoops I want to add a another line break because right now Simon cowl is on the same line as all the other friends so I'm going to be there you go so now we got this is bold line break this is italic google.com line break and an image that's kind of how you start structuring your web page and you're probably thinking this is ugly this doesn't feel like building a web page uh but this is about as complicated as HTML gets for real I'm not making it up HTML is not much more complicated than this you just have to remember a few tags a few attributes like href and source and that's about it I can show you a few more tags here uh UL is something you'll use a lot that stands for unordered list um and inside this you'll add Lis um so here I've added An Li which stands for line item um item one item two and now you see we've got our you know I'm going to get rid of Mr Simon nobody likes to see him for very long anyway okay there we go so now we've got an unordered list which by default is just going to display with bullet points uh item one item two uh you can style these a lot of different ways so you're going to use the UL a lot anytime you have a list of items you're going to use a UL with Lis inside of it um a drop down naig ation is a list of items you'll use ulli um an actual navigation is a list of items you'll use ulli a list of MP3s in a fake MP3 player online uls with Lis um another thing very similar is ol's and that's un and that is ordered list and that actually by default is going to spit out numbers for each item you don't really use this one very often but it's helpful to know that it exists uh we're almost out of tags honestly folks uh there's div tags which you use a lot but we're not going to show you that's basically for styling so we're going to leave it untouched right now span tags you'll also use a decent bit but once again that is for styling so that is about as complicated as HTML gets all you have to do is get comfortable typing in tags um and you're pretty much an HTML developer uh paragraph tags those are important and header tags and then we'll be done P P is for paragraph that's another way to kind of separate text let's say we added this four times it's starting to get all messy and I forgot to close these p and each P and a slash P there we go so inside of this paragraph We have this I don't know what that did right there inside of this paragraph We have a block of text for each one you'll see the paragraph automatically kind of created its own space on either side paragraphs are usually the way you're going to want to add fresh line breaks usually you don't want to use the BR tag um like we're using there uh but it has its purposes as well BR creates a line break as you can see here and P creates a fresh paragraph with space on either side the only other tags you're going to use are header tags they start with h depending on how big you want the header to be you'll use H1 for the biggest H2 is smaller than that and H3 and so on down to about H6 or so it's pretty rare to have headers Beyond in six different sizes you're probably pretty bad at design if you're doing that and when it refreshes there you go big not so big not really big and then we're down to our normal text so that is HTML design so our next thing we're going to cover style so you can actually not feel like a fake developer you get to feel like a real developer in the next one as we start to style our things CSS gets a little more complicated so I'd encourage you take a little time make some links make some different web pages um and just have fun with HTML for a little while before you move forward in our next one we're going to do a little bit more advanced HTML and we're going to do a little bit more Style
