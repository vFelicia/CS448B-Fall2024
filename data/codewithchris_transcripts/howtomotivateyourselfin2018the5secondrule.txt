00:00 - hey guys what's up it's Chris here today
00:02 - I want to talk to you about motivation I
00:03 - don't know if you've felt this way
00:05 - before but I certainly have and that's
00:06 - that feeling that you have all of these
00:09 - great ideas you have all of these things
00:11 - you want to accomplish but you just
00:12 - can't get yourself to go and do it for
00:15 - instance last night after eating dinner
00:17 - after putting the kids to bed and after
00:20 - cleaning the kitchen I had two options I
00:22 - could a get ahead on my content or be
00:26 - sit down on the couch and watch true
00:29 - detective well you can guess what I did
00:31 - I'm on season two by the way and I can
00:35 - also tell you that I have a folder on my
00:37 - hard drive full of unfinished half-baked
00:40 - half-done projects and I remember for
00:44 - every single one of those projects when
00:46 - I thought of the idea when I planned out
00:48 - that app I was so excited I was so
00:50 - motivated but while working on them
00:53 - things always come up you know and for
00:55 - one reason or another they all sit there
00:57 - as abandoned projects now and the reason
01:00 - why I want to talk to you about this
01:01 - today is because I know a lot of you
01:03 - guys out there are probably struggling
01:05 - with learning iOS and trust me I know
01:08 - how hard it is to learn something new
01:10 - I've tried to learn piano guitar a whole
01:12 - bunch of other things multiple times but
01:14 - you know I know that you need a lot of
01:17 - practice I know what it takes to get
01:19 - there
01:20 - to the destination but when push comes
01:24 - to shove and you actually have to do the
01:25 - work that's the hard part right so
01:29 - recently I came across a woman named Mel
01:32 - Robbins I actually just randomly saw her
01:36 - video on YouTube and I watched her talk
01:38 - and it was super inspiring and she tells
01:40 - us about this method which you can use
01:43 - to get yourself to do the things that
01:45 - are hard to do and I tried it a couple
01:48 - of times and it works so that's why I
01:49 - want to share with you at least I worked
01:51 - for me so maybe it worked for you as
01:53 - well
01:53 - so she says that a motivation is crap
01:56 - it's never there when you need it it's
01:58 - not enough to count on motivation to get
02:01 - you to do the things that you know you
02:03 - need to do and number 2 we all know the
02:05 - steps we need to take in order to get to
02:08 - the destination because you can find
02:10 - everything on the
02:11 - now and everything is just a Google
02:12 - search away so whatever you want to
02:14 - learn type it into Google and chances
02:16 - are you're gonna get a list of steps or
02:18 - some books that are gonna help or some
02:20 - courses so we all know the steps that we
02:22 - need to take to get there third it's
02:25 - natural to feel this way because
02:26 - anything you want to do that's going to
02:28 - make you feel uncomfortable anxious it's
02:30 - out of your comfort zone and you
02:33 - hesitate to do it your mind perceives
02:35 - that as a threat and it's basically
02:37 - survival instincts kicking in and your
02:39 - mind is going to come up with a million
02:41 - reasons to stop you from doing it that's
02:43 - why it's so hard to go to the gym or to
02:46 - eat healthy if those things are not they
02:49 - don't come natural to you I mean trying
02:50 - to force yourself to do it you hesitate
02:53 - and your mind convinces you not to do it
02:55 - and you end up not doing it so the
02:57 - technique she describes it's called the
02:59 - five-second rule and it's very simple
03:01 - and she even says it sounds stupid and
03:03 - it'll probably sound stupid to you but I
03:06 - tried it a couple of times and actually
03:08 - got me off my butt to do what I didn't
03:09 - want to do so here it is basically when
03:12 - it comes time to make a decision to do
03:14 - something that you don't want to do and
03:16 - you hesitate you have about five seconds
03:19 - before your brain is just going to
03:21 - convince you not to do it and you're
03:23 - just not going to do it so what you do
03:25 - in that instant when you recognize
03:27 - that's what's happening you count down
03:30 - words from five you go five four three
03:32 - two one and then when you get to one you
03:35 - spring into action and you go and do
03:38 - what you didn't want it to so the reason
03:41 - why this works is because for me at
03:43 - least what I felt happening was when I
03:45 - started counting from five downwards it
03:48 - interrupted my thinking about all of the
03:51 - reasons why I didn't want to do this
03:54 - it's gonna be so hard it's gonna take so
03:56 - much time I'm not going to be able to do
03:58 - this or do that and you know it's just
04:01 - interrupted all of that stopped that and
04:03 - then as I was counting down towards one
04:06 - I just felt like an invisible hand was
04:08 - pushing me towards the edge of the cliff
04:10 - and when I counted to one I just got up
04:13 - and I went to go do it and the thing is
04:16 - once you get started it's never as bad
04:19 - as you think right you just need to
04:22 - have that momentum right it's just like
04:24 - this big snowball on the top of the hill
04:26 - once you push it momentum takes over and
04:29 - then the snowball rolls so once you just
04:31 - get past that point of not wanting to do
04:35 - it and once you're in motion and in
04:37 - action
04:38 - I think momentum just takes over and
04:40 - then you just end up doing you just end
04:42 - up continue doing what you originally
04:44 - procrastinated and didn't want to do I'm
04:47 - going to link to her talk in the
04:48 - description below so you guys can go and
04:50 - watch it if you're interested now I want
04:53 - to answer the question I post you guys
04:54 - about two videos ago about how much my
04:57 - Costco haul cost and a lot of you guys
05:00 - were way way way off so I'm coming grab
05:03 - the receipt let me show you guys that's
05:08 - five hundred and twenty dollars and
05:10 - that's Canadian dollars so you can just
05:12 - do the currency conversion for for your
05:16 - own currency and see how far off you
05:18 - were but yeah five hundred and twenty
05:20 - bucks I could have bought a brand new
05:21 - Mac Mini for that price and it would
05:24 - have been a big chunk towards the new
05:25 - iPhone 10 which I am thinking about
05:28 - getting now when I turn it over to you
05:31 - guys and ask you guys a new question how
05:33 - many times have you tried to learn Swift
05:36 - or try to learn how to build iOS apps
05:39 - let me know by commenting below and I'll
05:41 - see you guys next time
05:42 - thanks for watching
