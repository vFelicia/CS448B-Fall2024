00:00 - I've forgotten how hard it is to learn
to code, so I asked all of you for what
00:04 - advice you would give to a beginner
who is just learning iOS app development.
00:09 - And here is what you guys said.
00:11 - Hey, Code Crew, welcome back to the
channel, just in case you're new here.
00:14 - My name is Chris and welcome
to CodeWithChris.
00:17 - The place to be if you want to learn
how to code and how to build up.
00:19 - I'm so happy you're here now.
00:21 - Let's dove right in.
00:23 - So Ian kicks us off with four great tips.
00:26 - No one, when taking a course,
don't watch it like Netflix.
00:29 - Take a pencil and pen and take notes.
00:31 - Taking notes will reinforce
whatever you're visually learning.
00:35 - Now, I fully agree with this and it's
00:37 - something that I've started doing
with reading books because not only can
00:41 - you go back and refer to your notes, which
come on, let's be honest, I never do.
00:46 - However, by taking notes during
the learning process,
00:49 - you actually help glue and cement
those concepts in your head.
00:53 - All right.
00:53 - Here's what Ian says for number to take
a project and go line by line looking
00:58 - at each function, semicolon
in variable, just like above.
01:01 - This will help you remember what things
do and how they're built and why.
01:05 - Now, in the beginning,
this is a great way for you to make sure
01:08 - that you understand
exactly what's going on.
01:11 - All right.
01:12 - Number three, work on coding
every day, building projects.
01:15 - This will get you familiar with the actual
ecosystem of iOS development
01:19 - in the process of developing
apps with Swift and other tech.
01:23 - This seriously, you can't learn app
development if you don't do the work.
01:28 - And there is a certain level of effort
01:31 - and hands on coding that you need
to do before you can get proficient.
01:35 - Now, the best way for you to get this done
01:38 - is to pencil it into your
calendar and make it a ritual.
01:41 - Now, don't beat yourself up if you can do
01:44 - it daily, but at the same time,
don't wait too long or you'll forget what
01:47 - you did in the last session and you'll
just be playing catch up all the time.
01:52 - All right.
Number four, document and share your
01:54 - process and progress while
you are building projects.
01:57 - Now, this is great advice for motivation
02:00 - purposes because just with learning
anything new, there is bound to be times
02:04 - when you're discouraged,
you want to give up.
02:06 - However, if you document your journey,
02:08 - you can refer back to your early days
and you can see how far you've come.
02:12 - And furthermore, it is a public journal.
02:14 - Other people can comment and they
can encourage you to continue on.
02:19 - And honestly, sometimes
that makes all the difference.
02:22 - Now, shameless plug here in our
Code Crew Community Forum.
02:25 - We have a journalist section
exactly for this purpose.
02:29 - And Ian ends off.
02:31 - Those are my two cents.
Have a good one.
02:33 - And don't forget to be awesome.
I love that.
02:35 - Now, one way to be awesome would be to hit
that thumbs up button on this video.
02:39 - Downbelow.
02:41 - All right, moving on.
02:42 - Theran is the next one up.
02:43 - And he says, I never thought I'd be
02:45 - in position to crank out an app
in two to three days, but here I am.
02:50 - That's seriously impressive.
02:52 - My advice to any newbies watch the is
to learn the very basics,
02:56 - even if you find yourself copying
and pasting every single line of code
03:00 - and then create a project
of your own to work on.
03:03 - Yeah.
Now, this is really good advice because
03:06 - a lot of beginners,
they're discouraged that they have to copy
03:10 - every single line of code
that they are seeing me.
03:12 - Right.
But that is part of the learning process.
03:16 - Think about babies.
03:17 - They mimic what they see and that's
part of how they grow and learn.
03:21 - But not that I'm calling you guys
babies, but you get the idea.
03:25 - Next up, we have Tammy Wish.
03:27 - I had known about Xcode helpful
links to a lot of information.
03:30 - Other stuff I found useful was the book,
03:32 - the Swift programing
language from Apple books.
03:34 - That's true.
03:35 - Apple has a lot of free
resources for you to learn.
03:38 - I was at the moment there is
an iPad playground's app.
03:42 - There are free books that they
have for learning as well.
03:47 - They used to not keep them so up to date,
but these days maybe it's better.
03:51 - So definitely go check that out and let
you know that inside Xcode if there's
03:54 - a keyword or a class name you're not sure
about, you can Poletown down option
03:59 - and click it to bring up the developer
documentation right inside Xcode.
04:03 - Next up, we have octave or maybe octave.
04:05 - I'm so sorry if I'm butchering your name,
but he says read test afterwards.
04:10 - Try it out on your own.
04:11 - Do it again 20 times.
04:13 - And keep in mind, errors
are good at the beginning.
04:17 - Now, as a beginner,
04:18 - there are so many times that you're going
to make mistakes and you're going
04:22 - to overcome them and you're
going to learn from them.
04:24 - But there's actually a deeper reason
04:26 - to why making mistakes
in the beginning is good.
04:29 - Errors are good in the beginning because
04:31 - they help build your
confidence as a beginner.
04:34 - And confidence is one of the most powerful
weapons for a beginner to continue
04:39 - learning about development and to
not give up confidence.
04:43 - That's the thing.
Now, one thing before we go on,
04:47 - in case I miss pronounce your name,
please, please let me know.
04:50 - Either leave a comment below or reach out
through the website and that little chat
04:55 - widget and let me know
that mispronounce your name.
04:58 - I really want to know.
04:59 - Funny story happened this weekend.
05:01 - I've been calling my neighbor Dan
05:03 - for the last few weeks because I
accidentally got some of his mail.
05:06 - Hey, Dan, your guest is looking great.
05:08 - Hey, Dan, how's it going?
05:10 - Good afternoon, Dan.
05:11 - Then one day he just has
Feliks and I'm like, what?
05:16 - My name is Felix.
05:19 - Turns out that the mail I accidentally got
05:21 - with the name down on it was for his
son who had moved out years ago.
05:25 - OK, moving on Marquises.
05:27 - My advice is that it's OK for beginners
to copy the code they're blocking on.
05:31 - But the most important part is
to analyze the code and understand it.
05:35 - Now,
05:36 - this goes back to what I said before in
the beginning, it's OK to copy the code.
05:40 - You don't really understand what it means.
05:43 - You're still going to be able to produce
05:46 - a result, but at some point in time,
you still need to have that inquisitive
05:50 - mind set to try to figure
out what's going on.
05:53 - Now, one of the best ways to force
yourself to stop copying is to try
05:57 - to replicate what you saw
on your own computer.
06:02 - Now, it's OK if you have to refer back
06:05 - to the source material like
the video or the book.
06:07 - However, it's still helping you reinforce
what you learned and committed to memory.
06:13 - All right.
This one comes from Muhammad and he has
06:16 - six quickfire tips for us, things I
wish I knew when I started programing.
06:21 - Everything should make sense.
06:23 - Number two, if there's anything wrong
with your program, that's because of you.
06:26 - So don't blame Xcode.
06:28 - Talk about tough love.
06:29 - Number three, there is
always room for improvement.
06:32 - Number four, write your program in small
06:34 - chunks and think about how
you would add them together.
06:37 - It's like a puzzle.
Number five basics are powerful.
06:40 - And number six, test the extreme cases.
06:43 - Now, Mohammed also has a joke for us.
I love this.
06:46 - A quality assurance engineer walks
06:48 - into a bar, orders a beer,
orders zero beers,
06:51 - orders ninety nine billion beers, orders
a lizard, orders minus one beers, orders.
06:57 - A
06:59 - first real customer walks
in and asks where the bathroom is.
07:02 - The bar bursts into flames,
killing everyone inside.
07:07 - I love the joke about testing.
07:09 - It always surprises me how people can find
07:12 - ways to break the thing
you so lovingly crafted
07:17 - now to make this relevant
to a beginner who's learning.
07:19 - I think, number three,
that there's always room for improvement.
07:22 - And number four, writing your program
in small chunks is especially relevant.
07:27 - Now to me, always room for improvement
means that nobody's code is perfect.
07:33 - A lot of times I hear from beginners,
you know, all my code is not that nice
07:38 - story that you have to read
this or look at this.
07:41 - Just keep in mind that even people
07:43 - who have been writing code for years,
no one has the perfect code because
07:47 - code always serves so
many different purposes.
07:49 - They're.
07:50 - There's no right one right way to do it,
so don't be self-conscious about your own
07:55 - Xcode, and I think that's something
that you can develop over time.
07:59 - Number for writing your app
in small chunks is a great idea.
08:01 - Often when I'm trying to do something
08:04 - for the first time, I do it
in a brand new Xcode project.
08:07 - And that way, if it's not working,
it's an isolated problem.
08:11 - Said I don't have to worry that maybe it's
08:13 - some previous code or preexisting
code that I have that's interfering.
08:18 - Get it working first in a brand new
project so that you know it works
08:22 - and and try to integrate it
back into your main project.
08:26 - OK, SDK says start small, but dream big.
08:28 - Now, this is short,
08:31 - but really sweet because what SDK
is touching on is the mental game.
08:35 - Learning something new
is such a mental game.
08:38 - Now, in the beginning, you're taking
little baby steps and progress is slow
08:44 - and it's hard, but you can't lose sight of
that end goal what you want to achieve.
08:50 - You just have to keep in mind
that you will get there.
08:53 - You will be able to achieve
what you imagined.
08:55 - But now you're putting in the work every
08:58 - day and you're you're
making progress every day.
09:01 - And soon progress will become
faster and faster and faster.
09:04 - And it's like a snowball.
09:05 - So start small, a dream big.
09:07 - Really great advice.
09:09 - OK, Omar says you must enjoy the struggle
that comes with coding on Xcode.
09:14 - Omar is right.
09:15 - Xcode can sometimes get confused, but
usually a restart will get things fixed.
09:20 - OK, Yishan says.
09:21 - I thought it was hard,
but turns out I could do it.
09:24 - This is my advice to beginners.
09:25 - Don't think just because it is hard
09:27 - that you can't do it
and don't give up easily.
09:30 - Now this sort of goes back to what he said
09:32 - about start small but dream big
in the beginning.
09:35 - Progress is hard.
It's tough.
09:37 - You want to give up and it's like
an uphill climb up a mountain.
09:41 - But I've seen time and time again
that there's this tipping point
09:45 - and there's this this point in time where
people's mindset shifts from, oh,
09:49 - I want to give up to,
oh, what else don't I know?
09:53 - And things start becoming fun.
09:55 - You start focusing on all of the
possibilities instead of how hard it is.
10:03 - So this mental shift, this tipping point
comes at a different part for everyone.
10:08 - But you have to put in that initial slog
10:11 - to get there and get
past that tipping point.
10:13 - And then from there on,
your momentum carry you.
10:18 - OK, so Fattuh says the only advice I'd
10:20 - like to give is the most important tool
in Iowa at the moment is dedication
10:24 - and following great people like Christian
Paul Hudson Manteau and Jordan Singer.
10:28 - And of course, we cannot forget
Stack Overflow and Google.
10:31 - Yes, these are all great
people in the community.
10:34 - Go and check them out.
10:35 - OK, Josaitis, my advice for beginners
is to go with the flow of the courses.
10:40 - You'll learn so much day by day.
10:41 - And like the Shamblin Temple movie,
10:43 - one day you will wake up and realize
how much wisdom you have.
10:47 - Now, I don't know if you're actually going
10:49 - to wake up one day and suddenly become
enlightened.
10:52 - However, I think what Hosie is referring
10:55 - to is that tipping point
that I just mentioned.
10:58 - There comes a point in time where things
11:01 - just start becoming fun and you
don't focus on how hard it is.
11:04 - Or like I have the Xcode again today, too.
11:07 - What are the possibilities
of things that I could do?
11:10 - How do I do this?
11:11 - And you have confidence
that you can figure it out.
11:14 - You just need to find
the right way to do it.
11:17 - And that's a very powerful shift.
11:19 - And I find that that almost is
an overnight turning point for people.
11:24 - All right.
Next that we have, Mr.
11:25 - Singh, he says after getting the basic
concepts of the programing language,
11:29 - you must try to build something
without watching the videos.
11:31 - It's best trying to find solutions
11:32 - from different sources
to complete the challenges.
11:34 - And it's good to have someone to ask,
11:37 - but it would be better if I can figure
out a way to solve my own problems now.
11:41 - I think this is a great example of going
11:44 - back to building up
that confidence, right.
11:47 - There are so many resources out there
11:50 - that you can Google Stack overflow,
find out a solution,
11:55 - try to debug your own issues
if you are able to solve it yourself.
11:59 - You build up that confidence that is
so key to the learning process.
12:03 - However, if you continue to get stuck,
there is also resources to ask people,
12:08 - for instance, in our Code Crew forum or
even on Reddit or stack overflow at places
12:14 - like that, there's tons
of people willing to help.
12:17 - All right.
Next up, we have Peter.
12:19 - I could do with many more
exercises personally.
12:22 - Actually doing it really,
really makes it sink in for me.
12:25 - Also, I give it a week and then I go back
12:27 - to your video again and bingo,
it makes sense.
12:30 - That feeling when it clicks
into place is such a great one.
12:33 - Yes.
12:34 - I totally agree with you, Peter,
and thank you for reinforcing Mr.
12:38 - Singh's point.
Practice really does help here.
12:41 - And also taking a break is something
that Peter mentioned as well.
12:45 - That is sometimes you just need to walk
away from your code and come back
12:50 - with a fresh set of eyes and you
might spot the solution right away.
12:54 - All right.
Next up, we have Catherine or Cathan.
12:56 - Sorry again if I mispronounce your name.
12:58 - If you are a complete beginner,
having no experience with any programing
13:02 - language, then spend enough time on logic,
building on the language fundamentals like
13:07 - array's functions,
loop's structures build lots of apps.
13:11 - Consistency is the key now.
13:14 - Consistency definitely is the key again.
13:17 - But don't beat yourself up if you don't
have time every day to code, just
13:22 - don't leave too long in between
coding sessions again.
13:25 - And a lot of people were intimidated about
13:27 - coding and all of this special keywords
in the syntax and stuff like that.
13:32 - And I always tell people that you
don't have to memorize it, right.
13:36 - If you are actually spending the coding
sessions and you're actually coding,
13:41 - you might have to look up how to do an if
statement the first time,
13:43 - maybe second and maybe the third time,
maybe the fourth time.
13:46 - But you will get to a point
where you will remember it.
13:49 - However, if you wait too long in between
13:51 - coding sessions, that's where
you're going to find the trouble.
13:54 - And there's a bonus tip.
13:55 - If you're facing difficulties
13:57 - in understanding some topic,
your mind is full of give up thoughts.
14:00 - Then take a break and start
with this issue again tomorrow.
14:04 - Try to get help from various
available resources.
14:06 - You'll definitely come out
with a proper solution.
14:08 - Sometimes you just need to take a break.
14:10 - You took the words right out of my mouth.
14:13 - OK, Dave, he says, I would tell them to be
14:16 - patient and develop different skills,
one set at a time, depending on what they
14:20 - enjoy doing and what kind
of apps that they want to build.
14:23 - This is so true because
people often approach.
14:26 - At the moment, because they have an end
14:28 - goal in mind, either they want to break
into the industry as a career or they
14:31 - might have a specific app idea sometimes
of your feeling, especially frustrated,
14:35 - just take a step back
and remember that end goal.
14:38 - Just think about it.
Remind yourself why you started this
14:40 - journey in the first place and know
that you are making progress.
14:44 - And going back to that first point earlier
14:46 - in this video, making a journal, keeping,
keeping up with it and looking at those
14:50 - earlier days is a great way to remind
yourself how far you've come.
14:55 - All right, William,
he says that honestly,
14:58 - the best advice I would give to someone is
to make the most of the resources
15:01 - available, build the apps with Chris
to get the fundamentals down,
15:04 - to sign up for the house
and reach out to the Code Crew.
15:07 - But most importantly,
remember that the app or future you have
15:10 - in your own head will become a reality
as long as you keep working at it again.
15:17 - You guys are just taking
the words right out of my mouth.
15:19 - This is what I just talked about, right?
15:22 - Sometimes having that end goal in sight
and reminding yourself how far you've come
15:27 - is enough to keep you going because
that initial learning process,
15:31 - climbing that mountain,
reaching that tipping point is a slog.
15:35 - You're making slow progress,
but progress you are still making.
15:39 - OK, Mac says, I think the most important
thing is to make sure that you do
15:43 - the challenges at the end of each lesson
and try to work on your own project
15:47 - to properly embed the knowledge
learned throughout.
15:50 - Yes, hands on learning is key.
15:53 - OK, Katrina.
15:55 - So many times I felt stuck and stupid.
15:57 - I wish someone could tell me that it's OK
to fail to do my homework and that I
16:01 - should keep trying, testing many
solutions and don't give up.
16:05 - I think Katrina speaks from the speaks
from the heart on this one.
16:09 - You know, as a beginner, learning anything
is really hard, let alone coding.
16:14 - You know, it's OK to get stuck,
it's OK to ask for help.
16:18 - And it's just part of the learning process
16:21 - making mistakes and and
feeling that frustration.
16:24 - But that's that's part of the mental
game of learning something new.
16:27 - Right.
16:28 - And if you push past it, good things
await for you on the other side.
16:32 - And sometimes you just need
someone to remind you of that.
16:34 - Sometimes you just need a support network.
16:36 - So
16:38 - I don't mean to plug our own forum, but,
16:40 - you know, find a place where you can be
with other people who are on the same
16:45 - journey as you so that you can
encourage each other to push forward.
16:50 - Katrina continues.
16:51 - Now, I understand that it is all right
to Google, look through
16:54 - stack overflow and sometimes I need
to shut down my Mac and go to sleep.
16:57 - And the next day the solution comes to me.
17:00 - Taking a break often is
is really, really key.
17:03 - Also, I wish someone explained to me
17:05 - at the very beginning that there are many
good ways to write some particular code
17:09 - and it's OK if my code works but doesn't
match the code of another student.
17:13 - Lots of times I felt my code is
not worth showing to others.
17:16 - Now, this is completely true.
17:18 - There are so many different ways of doing
17:20 - things, and especially as a beginner, you
shouldn't really focus on trying to do
17:26 - everything perfectly and following all
the best practices and just examining your
17:30 - piece of code over
and over and over again.
17:32 - In the beginning,
17:33 - it's actually more helpful and far more
effective to focus on quantity and just
17:39 - writing more code and going through
more code than it is quality.
17:43 - You know, as you get to the point where
17:45 - you are either in the workforce on a team
or you're building your own app
17:51 - for the App Store, that's where
you quality will count a lot.
17:55 - But in the beginning, as a beginner,
try to get through as much quantity
17:59 - and throughput, get as
much practice as you can.
18:02 - There's always many different
ways of doing things.
18:04 - All right.
Next up, we have flow and flow actually
18:07 - has his own YouTube
channel called Flow Right?
18:10 - Xcode.
18:11 - And he's taught in the boot
camp to beginners before.
18:15 - So his advice is coming from
teaching beginners first hand in person.
18:20 - So this is really cool.
18:22 - Don't be afraid to ask questions,
18:24 - not stack overflow,
but to the people who teach you.
18:27 - Now, I think this is especially relevant
18:29 - when you're in a live setting because,
you know, people are shy.
18:34 - So if you're in school or you're in class,
you're in a boot camp or something.
18:38 - Don't be afraid to raise your hand because
there are no stupid questions.
18:42 - And online, it's even
easier to ask a question.
18:46 - Just make sure that you do.
18:49 - Everyone is overwhelmed in the beginning
18:51 - as there's so much to take in and take
your time and conquer each little piece
18:55 - one at a time, and it will
all make sense later.
18:58 - And I totally agree.
18:59 - For a beginner, there is a lot to learn
19:02 - and it can be very overwhelming,
such as, you know, the syntax for Swift.
19:08 - If someone is brand new to coding,
19:10 - it can be really hard to try to remember
where the curly brackets go.
19:15 - What does a specific keyword mean?
19:18 - And I always say, and I think I've said
19:20 - this before, don't try to memorize it,
just do more coding.
19:24 - And naturally, your fingers will.
19:26 - Just start to remember,
as weird as that sounds,
19:29 - most of the time,
there is no perfect solution or approach,
19:33 - try out some different ways
and find out what works for you.
19:35 - And that's one thing I always try
to make sure that people know
19:41 - there is.
19:42 - What separates you from an expert,
if you're just starting to learn,
19:47 - is just that the expert has seen
more different ways of doing things.
19:51 - And I always tell my students
19:54 - that there is no like black and white,
right or wrong way to do something.
20:00 - There might be more efficient or slightly
less efficient ways of doing things.
20:06 - And as you gain experience,
20:08 - you will recognize what sorts of things to
do in specific scenarios and use cases.
20:16 - So just keep in mind,
20:17 - there's always different ways
to accomplish the same result.
20:21 - OK, same for teaching.
20:22 - Try to watch different creators read
20:24 - articles and read
the developer documentation.
20:27 - Yeah, there's so many resources out there
20:30 - these days, so many different YouTube
channels just like flow, right.
20:33 - Xcode, CodeWithChris, you know, other
20:36 - people out there that if you're not really
jiving with one method of learning or one
20:43 - instructor, you try another instructor,
try another medium to learn.
20:49 - The last thing that Flo says is
think about something you're passionate
20:53 - about and start working on an app for that
topic to start doing and learn as you go.
20:59 - I think there's two two things I want
to point out about what Flo says here.
21:03 - One is to keep in mind why you came
into learning I was up development.
21:08 - Keep that goal in your head.
21:10 - And the second thing is that you
just have to get your feet wet.
21:15 - Sometimes people get so intimidated if
21:18 - they're doing something the right way or
not or if they're writing clean code or
21:23 - not, that they're afraid
to even take the first step.
21:27 - And, you know,
21:27 - sometimes it's just watching or reading is
easier than actually
21:32 - turning to your computer and trying
to type it out, you know,
21:35 - but you really do have to get your feet
wet and start making some mistakes so
21:39 - that you get opportunities to
let things sort of sink into your memory
21:45 - and also to build that confidence
that you you need as a beginner.
21:50 - Tomas says, start from the beginning,
understand basics.
21:53 - Don't skip.
21:54 - Even if you think something
is easy experiment.
21:57 - You won't break anything.
Don't overthink.
21:59 - Better is the enemy of good.
22:01 - So if something worked Liebert,
you may always come back to it later.
22:05 - And I love that Thomas
talks about overconfidence.
22:07 - You read something or
you're watching something.
22:09 - You think, yeah, yeah I know it.
It's easy.
22:12 - And that's what I fell prey
to when I was first learning.
22:15 - I was at the moment and I
had a coding background.
22:18 - Everything just looked easy.
22:19 - But when I actually tried to start to do
it, I realized I didn't know how to start.
22:23 - So it's so important that even if
something looks simple, try to do it.
22:29 - And that also helps reinforce
and helps that stick in your head.
22:34 - OK, Bob says the best advice is
to set realistic expectations.
22:37 - You're going to experience letdowns.
22:39 - The biggest thing that helped me is
22:41 - learning how to troubleshoot your Xcode
when something isn't working as expected.
22:44 - Your tutorial on debugging really
helped lay a foundation for me.
22:48 - Awesome.
So you can probably check out
22:50 - that debugging tutorial there,
a link to it there.
22:53 - But yeah, this goes back to being
able to solve your own problems.
22:57 - Once you learn the techniques you can use
inside Xcode and the tools that are
23:00 - available to you, you're going to feel
empowered, you can feel confident.
23:04 - And that is a huge weapon for you as
23:07 - a beginner to fight this resistance
that you're feeling for learning.
23:12 - And then, yeah, once you feel confident
you can overcome your own problems,
23:16 - then you're just interested in solving
more problems and making progress.
23:21 - OK, your hand has five points for us.
23:24 - Now, in summary, he says starting in
Swift, an execution can be bewildering.
23:28 - You will not understand 90
percent of what you're doing.
23:30 - Just follow the examples in the courses.
23:32 - And having a running app
on your device is gratifying.
23:35 - One hundred percent agree.
23:36 - Sometimes
if you're having a lot of trouble
23:39 - in the beginning,
understanding and keeping up,
23:42 - sometimes just you going through with it
and then coming back and doing it again.
23:48 - Second time through might be the thing
that clinches it for you, right?
23:52 - The first time.
23:53 - Maybe you're just copying
and you're just doing it.
23:56 - He continues do small tweaks on apps
and I think he's referring to the projects
24:00 - in my course,
changes the images in the car turning game
24:04 - to make it more personal
and more gratification.
24:06 - Yeah, I think that in the beginning,
24:08 - as you're learning and you're just
following someone building their tutorial,
24:12 - building their demo app
afterwards, if you can
24:16 - tweak something small in it,
switch out the images, add your own label,
24:20 - add an extra button,
add a little extra feature to it.
24:23 - It really helps give you
that confidence boost and.
24:25 - Helps you reinforce what
you've learned as well.
24:28 - Number three, hang in there,
do at least three more Chris projects
24:31 - and tweet them talking about throughput,
practice more consistency, just code more.
24:37 - There's a there's a running theme
number four for your first project.
24:41 - Make it very simple,
24:42 - like an interface that really
doesn't do anything step by step.
24:45 - And I like this point because a lot
24:47 - of beginners,
you know, they want to boil the ocean.
24:50 - That's a phrase like they just want to
build an app with all the bells
24:53 - and whistles and it's sort
of pie in the sky type of thing.
24:56 - But in the beginning,
if you sort of set your goals low
24:59 - and and achieve them and sort of build up
that confidence, that is so important.
25:04 - In the beginning, like I've mentioned so
many times, that does wonders for you
25:09 - and you work your way up into that pie
in the sky app idea that you have.
25:14 - And don't lose sight of that
because that's important.
25:16 - That's what brought you to learning
this whole thing in the first place.
25:20 - Don't lose sight of that,
but just keep it in check
25:23 - and understand that in the beginning
you're learning journeys.
25:27 - You know, it's slow,
but you are making progress.
25:30 - All right.
And Johann's final point here
25:33 - is finally read some books,
be practical and read those chapters.
25:36 - You actually need Google for solutions.
25:38 - If you run into errors, if you're stuck,
25:40 - ask an expert and if and you learn most
by trying to solve the issue alone.
25:45 - Again, there's that
reoccurring theme, right?
25:48 - If you're able to break through that issue
25:50 - on your own, your confidence
level just leaps up sky high.
25:56 - And keep in mind,
25:57 - there's so many resources and solutions
out there, so many places to ask for help.
26:01 - You don't need to feel alone in this.
26:04 - OK, next up, we have Dan Miksa.
26:06 - The only advice that would have been
26:08 - useful for me was knowing all programing
languages and where you can use them.
26:12 - In high school, you learn C++,
26:14 - but nobody tells you where you can use
it only by the help of social media.
26:18 - I learned the purpose of older languages
26:20 - and about the existence of Swift,
for example, that I'm learning right now.
26:24 - Yeah, I sort of felt the same way
in the beginning
26:27 - in high school and throughout university,
learning all these different languages.
26:31 - I think,
you know, back then because I was going
26:34 - through school, I just
took it for granted.
26:35 - I'm learning how to code.
26:36 - But I think the takeaway here is that if
you are interested in a particular
26:41 - platform, if that's mobile, if that's Web,
you know, if that's back end or the server
26:46 - side, you need to find out what
technologies are used in that space.
26:50 - And I feel like if you are learning
26:53 - something, you are passionate about
something that you want to learn,
26:56 - that's going to make all the difference
for, you know, finding success or not.
27:00 - And next up, we have Chazen advice
27:03 - for businesses that never
give up and continue with it.
27:06 - And if you feel like quitting,
then just watch CodeWithChris material.
27:09 - I'm sure that after watching it,
you will never think about quitting.
27:12 - Thank you for the kind words Sheas.
27:14 - And the main message here is
sticking it through until you cross
27:19 - that tipping point,
whether it's CodeWithChris the trials or
27:23 - some tutorials elsewhere or books
or you're taking this boot camp or
27:29 - in class, you need to stick with it
past that tipping point to where you're
27:34 - not focused on giving up anymore and
you're just focused on the possibilities.
27:39 - And that comes from building up
a bit of confidence, you know,
27:45 - little step by little step.
27:46 - And I used to call that tipping point
27:48 - the hump, but I feel like
that's a terrible name.
27:50 - So you can think of a better name.
27:51 - Just drop it in the comments below
and I might start using that instead.
27:54 - Now, thank you to everyone
who submitted feedback for this video.
27:58 - I might not have gone through everybody,
28:00 - and I apologize for this because
I got an overwhelming amount of replies.
28:05 - But don't worry, I'm going
to save it for a part, too.
28:07 - And some of you even shared your personal
learning journeys when you first started.
28:12 - And I love that.
28:13 - I'm going to save that for
a separate video as well.
28:16 - So thank you to everyone
who submitted replies.
28:19 - And just for the record,
I had to paraphrase some of the replies as
28:23 - well, just to shorten it, to make it
fit into the length of this video.
28:26 - In closing, I want to say that we have
such an amazing community here and I'm so
28:31 - happy that we make it so
inclusive for newcomers.
28:34 - So if you are a newcomer yourself and your
28:36 - new to iOS app development,
definitely check out this playlist that I
28:40 - have right here, which is targeted
for people who have no coding background.
28:44 - And if you like this video,
please give it a thumbs up.
28:46 - Please subscribe.
Thanks for watching.
28:48 - I'll see you in the next video.
