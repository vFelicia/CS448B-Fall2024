00:07 - hey guys in this video I'll show you
00:09 - guys how to deploy an app on an actual
00:12 - device and before we start you're
00:14 - obviously going to need an actual iOS
00:16 - device but you also need to be part of
00:20 - this iOS Developer program from Apple
00:22 - which is $99 a year and when you're
00:25 - enrolled and you go into your member
00:27 - Center you're going to get access to the
00:30 - provisioning portal and here you need to
00:33 - do basically you need to set up a whole
00:35 - bunch of stuff for the app that you want
00:38 - to deoy to your device because there's a
00:40 - a whole bunch of controls in place and
00:42 - I'll explain what those controls are as
00:44 - I show you how to deploy a demo app on
00:47 - an actual device so I'm going to start
00:49 - by launching xcode and creating a new
00:52 - xcode project and it's just going to be
00:55 - a basic single View application I'm
00:57 - going to call this deployment
01:02 - demo okay so this is where I want you to
01:05 - pay a little bit of attention to the
01:08 - product name organization name and
01:11 - Company
01:12 - identifier so you can see here it says
01:15 - bundle identifier this is a combination
01:17 - of your company identifier and your
01:19 - product demo which you can change so if
01:22 - I change deployment uh demo to let's say
01:26 - deploy demo you can see the bundle
01:28 - identifier change okay so this is really
01:32 - important as we're going to see in a
01:34 - second so I'm just going to save this on
01:36 - the
01:39 - desktop okay so here again the project
01:42 - properties shows you what the bundle
01:45 - identifier is so normally what we would
01:47 - do in xcode is we have a whole bunch of
01:49 - simulators that we can run this demo
01:52 - from and up here you see iOS device now
01:55 - this is the option you want to select to
01:57 - run your app on an actual device but if
02:00 - you plug in your device right now and
02:02 - you you try to select this option and
02:04 - you try to run your app on the device
02:06 - you'll get an error message saying
02:08 - something like this device isn't
02:10 - provisioned to run this app now this is
02:13 - what you have to
02:14 - do so you have to come into your
02:18 - provisioning portal and I'm going to
02:20 - assume that this is the first time
02:21 - you've done this so you don't have any
02:23 - certificates now what is the certificate
02:26 - well it's part of the signing identity
02:28 - which Apple can use used to
02:30 - identify who that build belongs to
02:33 - because now that we're deploying builds
02:36 - onto real devices there could be the
02:39 - case where uh someone has a malicious
02:41 - intent to create um you know a malicious
02:44 - app and put it on someone's device so
02:47 - every time a a build gets created and
02:51 - put on with the intention of deploying
02:53 - it on a device it needs to be signed
02:55 - it's almost like a signature so we need
02:57 - to upload our certificate ific Ates that
03:00 - identify us into this portal and you can
03:02 - do that from
03:04 - xcode so if you go to xcode preferences
03:07 - and then here under the accounts tab you
03:10 - can add your Apple iTunes account the
03:12 - one the same one that you enrolled in
03:14 - the iOS Developer program with and
03:17 - you'll see your name here under the iOS
03:19 - program and you'll see agent uh I'm
03:22 - going to go select this and go view
03:25 - details and it's going to take a little
03:27 - bit of time to refresh and here here you
03:30 - can see that uh I've got two
03:32 - certificates uh two signing identities
03:35 - now uh I'll go through a distribution
03:38 - and development R in a second but you
03:40 - probably won't have anything in here so
03:42 - you click this plus icon and you want to
03:45 - request one of each and after you do
03:47 - that if you go back to the portal and
03:49 - you just hit refresh you should see um
03:52 - these ones here now keep in mind that
03:55 - you don't need to do any of this if your
03:57 - intention is just to run your app on the
03:59 - simulator
04:00 - now that you've requested your
04:02 - certificates and you have your signing
04:03 - identity set up um we have to create an
04:07 - app ID to represent our
04:11 - app uh I have a bunch here but you want
04:14 - to click plus and you can name your app
04:17 - anything I'll call it the deploy
04:20 - demo and down here in the you see this
04:24 - bundle ID now that should ring a bell
04:26 - because I pointed it out before but
04:28 - essentially you want to go to your xcode
04:30 - project and you want to grab that bundle
04:34 - identifier having a little bit of
04:38 - difficulty but you want to make sure
04:39 - that this bundle ID matches
04:42 - exactly this bundle ID here for your
04:48 - project and the reason this is is so
04:51 - that we can enable certain
04:54 - functionalities or certain services for
04:57 - this particular app ID so Apple can use
05:00 - this app ID to ensure that no one has
05:03 - added Services no no one has tampered
05:06 - with your app and added things that you
05:08 - didn't intend so it's it's all revolving
05:11 - around security and
05:14 - protection so I'm going to click
05:16 - continue and I'm going to click
05:18 - submit and just like that uh the
05:20 - registration is done for our app ID okay
05:24 - and the next part is devices so here you
05:28 - have to explicitly add a group of
05:31 - devices which you intend to install the
05:34 - app on now this I think this surprises a
05:37 - lot of people because you assume that
05:40 - when you build your app you're just
05:41 - going to be able to deploy it on every
05:43 - single device but that's not the case
05:45 - because um when you're testing your
05:48 - build and you are testing on a device
05:51 - you don't want that build to get into
05:53 - the wrong hands so this is a mechanism
05:55 - where you can specify exactly which
05:58 - devices the app will be allowed to be
06:01 - installed on each device has a unique
06:03 - identifier so you for every device that
06:06 - you want to install your app on you're
06:07 - going to need to add um you're going to
06:10 - need to add it here so there's a plus uh
06:12 - there's an add button here and you can
06:15 - just specify the name and the ud ID and
06:17 - I'll show you in a second how you get
06:19 - the ud ID when I plug in my own
06:23 - device okay so you've got a bunch of
06:26 - devices now under under here and the
06:29 - last step is to create a provisioning
06:32 - profile for our app now the provisioning
06:36 - profile is going to tie everything
06:37 - together I'll show you right
06:40 - here so we'll go to this add
06:45 - button um just to specify there's a
06:47 - couple of types of provisioning profiles
06:51 - so there's the development one which we
06:54 - are going to create and the purpose of
06:56 - this is for testing as you can see
06:59 - during
07:00 - development now there's two other ones
07:03 - there's
07:04 - distribution and ad hoc and both of
07:06 - these are considered distribution
07:09 - certificates now here's the difference
07:12 - so during development if you're testing
07:15 - with your development team um this is
07:18 - the profile that you're going to use
07:21 - when it comes time to let's say send the
07:23 - client a build or send some beta testers
07:26 - a build you're going to create a
07:28 - distribution ad hoc
07:31 - one and for both of these certificates
07:35 - sorry for both of these profiles uh you
07:38 - still have to specify a limited number
07:41 - of devices that the app can be installed
07:43 - on as we'll see in a second and then
07:45 - finally after all of your beta testing
07:48 - and client approval and whatnot you're
07:50 - going to create a distribution App Store
07:52 - one and the sole purpose of this one is
07:55 - for submitting to the App
07:57 - Store so basically what we're going to
08:00 - do is create a development profile
08:04 - you're going to select the app ID that
08:06 - we just
08:07 - created so that
08:10 - was uh deploy demo
08:12 - here going to click
08:18 - continue uh you're going to select the
08:20 - signing identity you want to use and for
08:22 - development ones let's say if you're
08:24 - working in a team and this this Apple
08:27 - iTunes account or provision in Portal
08:30 - account was your companies then you
08:32 - might actually have multiple
08:33 - certificates for all of your team
08:35 - members under the certificate section
08:37 - and then it would show up here and you
08:39 - can select all of them and this just
08:41 - means that so essentially what you're
08:43 - doing is you're selecting the signing
08:45 - identity which is going to be allowed to
08:49 - uh make a build for that app
08:51 - ID so right now only I will be able to
08:55 - create a build for that app ID basically
08:59 - basically for this project only I will
09:01 - be able to create a
09:04 - build and it will only be allowed to be
09:07 - installed on these
09:15 - devices and I can give my profile a
09:24 - name I'll click
09:28 - generate
09:32 - so this profile that we're about to
09:34 - download contains all of the information
09:36 - needed to deploy the app on the device
09:39 - it contains the list of devices that the
09:41 - app is allowed to be deployed on it
09:44 - contains the signing identities that are
09:47 - allowed to create a build and sign it it
09:51 - contains the app ID which if you
09:52 - remember when we created it is tied to
09:56 - very specific set of services app
09:59 - services such as you know Game Center
10:01 - inapp purchases push notifications so if
10:04 - we didn't enable say push
10:06 - notifications and a hacker were to uh
10:10 - maliciously take our build and somehow
10:13 - add some code for push notifications
10:14 - then Apple would be able to identify hey
10:17 - this app ID shouldn't be using this
10:19 - service so this is very suspicious that
10:21 - sort of stuff so this profile uh
10:24 - contains all of this information to
10:26 - identify uh the app and allow us to
10:29 - install it on devices so you can either
10:31 - download this and double click it or
10:33 - another way is to go into your xcode um
10:36 - app go to preferences we're going to go
10:39 - to view details for my account again and
10:42 - you can just hit refresh here and it's
10:44 - going to pull down all of and refresh
10:47 - all of your existing provisioning
10:50 - profiles let me organize it by name
10:54 - actually there it is deploy demo Dev
10:56 - profile all right
11:00 - okay so in our
11:02 - project in the properties we want to go
11:05 - into build
11:07 - settings and in here you can search for
11:11 - code
11:12 - signing so as you can see here it says
11:15 - don't code sign uh so what I mentioned
11:19 - about signing identities earlier is
11:22 - related to this so when we install apps
11:25 - on the simulator we don't really need to
11:27 - code sign because we're just testing in
11:28 - a simulator is not going to harm anyone
11:30 - but when we start deploying our app on a
11:33 - device then we need to sign the build or
11:36 - else it won't be able to be deployed on
11:40 - the device so we need to specify our
11:42 - signing identities so remember we set
11:46 - up this stuff right
11:50 - here oh that's what we're going to
11:52 - select here we're going to select the
11:55 - developer signing identity for both the
11:58 - de bug and release
12:02 - builds okay and then now it's time to
12:05 - plug in our
12:09 - device okay so I just plugged in my iPad
12:16 - and right here you can see that iOS
12:20 - device has changed to Chris's iPad 4 and
12:25 - this is essential to deploying the app
12:27 - on the device this is almost like a
12:29 - signal that um that your app can be
12:33 - deployed on this device if it still says
12:35 - iOS device then that means something is
12:38 - not right now a couple of things that
12:40 - you can
12:41 - check is usually when you plug in your
12:44 - device iTune has launched and uh
12:47 - sometimes iTune has a a prompt that
12:49 - tells you to back up your device or to
12:51 - upgrade your device or something like
12:53 - that and sometimes those prompts can uh
12:56 - prevent xcode from accessing your device
12:58 - so you want want to get rid of all those
12:59 - prompts uh for iTunes so that's the
13:02 - first thing you can check the next thing
13:03 - is that you can go to window organizer
13:06 - and this is this is an xcode
13:09 - menu and there's a devices tab you can
13:12 - select your device you should see a
13:15 - green light if you don't see a green
13:17 - light and it's yellow or or red then
13:20 - you've got something to look at or
13:22 - something to fix I mean there if it's
13:25 - the first time you've ever plugged in
13:26 - your device there might be a button here
13:28 - saying Ed for development so that could
13:30 - be the issue you you have to tap that
13:33 - button and it's going to uh get your
13:37 - device ready for uh deploying apps on it
13:41 - for development here you can see a list
13:44 - of provisioning profiles on this
13:47 - device you can hit this button right
13:50 - here and as a last resort what else you
13:53 - can try doing is actually downloading
13:56 - the provisioning profile so if we go
13:57 - back to this portal and we go to
13:59 - development
14:01 - profiles if you select this guy you can
14:04 - download it onto your hard
14:07 - drive and then in xcode you can actually
14:10 - click the add button here and browse for
14:14 - it and add the profile directly onto the
14:17 - device and at that point if this
14:20 - device's uh ID is allowed to be
14:23 - installed if the provisioning profile
14:25 - states that this ID this device's ID is
14:28 - valid to install this build the iOS
14:30 - device should change to the name the
14:33 - name okay so I still haven't told you uh
14:36 - how to get the device ID for your device
14:40 - so I promised I would do that if you go
14:42 - to window and organizer you can see this
14:44 - is the ID for your device so that's what
14:46 - you need to
14:48 - copy um to add it in here in your
14:52 - provisioning portal and at this point
14:54 - you know after all of this stuff is set
14:56 - up you're finally ready to uh deplo
14:58 - deploy your app on the devices that you
15:01 - selected in your provisioning profile so
15:04 - if I hit run
15:07 - now yeah hopefully I won't get any
15:13 - errors and the app is deployed on my
15:16 - iPad I can see it on my iPad it's just a
15:18 - white screen because we haven't added
15:20 - anything to the app but it's running and
15:24 - yeah that's it it might be a little bit
15:26 - tedious to set up the first time but
15:29 - after you've got your certificate set up
15:31 - then the next time for another app you
15:33 - just have to create the app ID and the
15:36 - provisioning profile okay I hope that
15:39 - wasn't too hard to follow along and I
15:42 - hope that answers your question about
15:44 - how to deploy apps on devices okay I'll
15:47 - see you guys next time
15:57 - bye
15:59 - [Music]
