00:00 - in this video you're going to learn how
00:01 - to add your products to the revenue cat
00:03 - platform so that you can easily
00:05 - display your in-app purchases in the app
00:07 - take transactions
00:09 - to let users purchase them and check
00:11 - user access levels
00:12 - you'll learn how revenuecat manages
00:14 - products and makes it easy for us
00:16 - to experiment with which offers work
00:18 - best in our app
00:20 - hey code crew i'm chris and welcome to
00:22 - code with chris the place to be if you
00:24 - want to learn to code and to build apps
00:26 - this is the third video in the revenue
00:28 - cat series if you missed the previous
00:30 - videos
00:30 - make sure you check out the playlist
00:32 - right there and here's where we are in
00:34 - our seven step process
00:37 - all right let's get started all right
00:39 - now it's time to add our in-app
00:40 - purchases to the revenue cap platform
00:43 - now the first thought in your head might
00:44 - be we've spent all this time configuring
00:47 - those in-app purchases
00:48 - in the app store connect portal why are
00:51 - we also
00:51 - adding it to revenue cat doesn't that
00:53 - seem like we're repeating work or we're
00:56 - we're doing work twice well that's not
00:58 - the case
00:59 - because we're not reconfiguring things
01:01 - in revenue cat
01:02 - what we're merely doing is adding
01:05 - references
01:06 - to those product ids that we have
01:08 - configured
01:09 - in the app store portal and by doing
01:11 - that we're going to be able to
01:13 - a manage our in-app purchases across
01:16 - different platforms
01:17 - more efficiently because your app might
01:19 - be cross-platform your app might be on
01:21 - ios
01:22 - on android on web and revenue cap
01:25 - allows you to manage all of those
01:27 - products group them together
01:29 - it gives you different ways to present
01:31 - different mixtures of products
01:33 - and it also gives you detailed analytics
01:35 - as to which offers
01:37 - are performing the best and so you can
01:39 - continue to experiment
01:41 - and maximize your revenue per user now
01:43 - we're going to get into
01:44 - all of that in this video but first we
01:46 - have to actually add our app
01:48 - to the platform so log into your revenue
01:51 - cat account if you haven't already
01:53 - make sure that you sign up for a free
01:55 - revenue account account
01:56 - using the link below cwc.to slash
02:00 - revcat3 and again i don't get any
02:03 - compensation for you
02:04 - signing up through that link but it does
02:06 - let the team know that you are
02:07 - interested in more content in regards to
02:10 - in-app purchases
02:11 - at monetization and how to generate
02:14 - revenue from your apps so if that is the
02:16 - case
02:17 - definitely go through that link and sign
02:19 - up for a free revenue account
02:21 - after you do that you're going to see a
02:23 - dashboard like this
02:24 - and we're going to go up here and add a
02:27 - new app
02:29 - and then we're going to put our app name
02:31 - here so
02:32 - this is a revcat demo
02:37 - all right and for the app bundle id this
02:40 - comes from
02:41 - your xcode project way back in lesson
02:44 - one where we created this
02:46 - let's go ahead and grab that from the
02:47 - project properties and paste that in
02:49 - there
02:50 - and then this itunes connect app
02:52 - specific
02:53 - shared secret now this key allows
02:56 - revenue cat
02:57 - to take those product ids that you're
02:59 - going to add to this platform and go
03:00 - fetch the information what's the
03:02 - duration what's the price
03:04 - you know that sort of thing so the way
03:06 - to get this
03:07 - app specific shared secret is you go
03:10 - back to the app store connect
03:11 - portal under your app under the manage
03:15 - in-app purchases
03:18 - you're going to see a listing of all of
03:20 - the in-app purchases that you've
03:21 - configured
03:22 - but also there's this link here called
03:24 - app specific shared secret and this is
03:26 - what we need to
03:27 - click generate a new secret key
03:31 - and we're going to copy this
03:34 - and then we are going to paste it in
03:37 - here
03:38 - that's going to allow revenue cat to go
03:40 - look at
03:41 - those in-app purchases that you've
03:43 - configured
03:45 - we don't have any play store
03:47 - configuration for this demo so we're
03:49 - going to just click on add
03:51 - all right so now we get to the part
03:53 - where we can configure our products
03:55 - our entitlements and our offers so let
03:57 - me tell you what that's all about
04:00 - so to work with revenue cat you have to
04:01 - understand three things
04:03 - products offers and entitlements let's
04:05 - first talk about products
04:08 - these are simply the in-app purchases
04:09 - that you've configured on the app store
04:12 - or your google play store or other
04:13 - stores
04:14 - let's say you have an app that is both
04:16 - on the google play store and the apple
04:18 - app store
04:19 - and in this app you let users buy a one
04:21 - year pro subscription or a one month pro
04:23 - subscription
04:24 - that means you're going to have four
04:26 - products a google play
04:28 - store one year pro membership an apple
04:31 - app store one year pro membership you're
04:34 - going to have
04:35 - a google play store one month pro
04:38 - membership and an
04:39 - apple app store one month pro membership
04:43 - so that's going to be four products in
04:44 - total now offers
04:46 - are how you present those products to
04:49 - the user
04:50 - and you can have multiple offers each
04:52 - offer
04:53 - having a different mixture of products
04:56 - now under products
04:57 - you'll notice that we have a separate
04:59 - product for each platform
05:02 - but under offers you do not have to
05:04 - create an offer for
05:05 - the app store and a different offer for
05:08 - the google play store you're going to be
05:10 - able to use the same offer
05:12 - for both stores now that's why a single
05:15 - offer
05:15 - consists of multiple packages
05:19 - a package is simply a grouping of
05:21 - products
05:22 - that are the same but just on different
05:24 - platforms
05:27 - so let's say we have offer number one
05:28 - here and we want to offer
05:30 - a one year subscription and a one month
05:33 - subscription to the user
05:34 - and they can choose which one they want
05:35 - to buy well inside offer number one then
05:37 - we're going to have two packages
05:39 - the first package is going to contain
05:42 - the google
05:42 - one year pro in-app purchase and
05:45 - the apple one year pro in-app purchase
05:48 - as well
05:49 - package two is going to be for the
05:51 - monthly option and in that package
05:53 - contains the apple app store one month
05:56 - in-app purchase
05:57 - and the google play store one month
06:00 - in-app purchase
06:02 - so as you can see all a package is is a
06:05 - grouping of
06:06 - like in-app purchases on various
06:09 - platforms
06:10 - so at the end offer number one is going
06:13 - to consist of two packages
06:14 - one package represents a yearly purchase
06:17 - and
06:18 - the second package represents a monthly
06:20 - purchase
06:21 - now we can also create a second offer
06:23 - and maybe on this offer we only want to
06:26 - allow people to purchase
06:27 - the one year subscription so
06:30 - for this second offer we only create one
06:32 - package in there
06:34 - and we put the google one-year in-app
06:37 - purchase in there
06:38 - as well as the apple one-year in-app
06:40 - purchase in there as well
06:42 - and now that we have two offers what we
06:45 - can do
06:45 - is experiment and split test and
06:49 - present offer number one half the time
06:51 - and then offer number two the other half
06:53 - of the time
06:53 - and see which one ends up getting us
06:55 - more revenue
06:57 - alternatively with multiple offers you
06:59 - can choose
07:00 - which offer to present in different
07:02 - parts of your app
07:03 - or maybe different points in time
07:05 - depending on how
07:06 - often or how heavily your user uses your
07:09 - app
07:11 - so for example if your analytics show
07:13 - you that
07:14 - that particular user is using your app
07:16 - every day
07:17 - very heavily then you might only present
07:20 - offer number two with the yearly package
07:22 - but as for another user who maybe
07:25 - doesn't use your app
07:26 - quite as often and he or she is not
07:28 - ready to make such a big commitment
07:30 - you might present offer number one
07:32 - instead
07:34 - so just to recap offers are what you
07:36 - present to the users
07:38 - to buy an offer consists of multiple
07:40 - packages
07:41 - and each package is just a grouping of
07:44 - products that
07:45 - unlock the same thing but on various
07:48 - platforms
07:49 - now let's talk about entitlements so an
07:53 - entitlement is just a level of access
07:55 - that you can
07:56 - see if the user has in order to unlock
07:59 - whatever content
08:00 - that that entitlement level entitles to
08:03 - the user
08:04 - essentially an entitlement is sort of
08:06 - like a membership level
08:07 - imagine if your app has several
08:09 - membership levels let's say silver gold
08:11 - and pro
08:12 - so you create three different
08:14 - entitlements to represent those levels
08:17 - and let's say you have three different
08:19 - in-app purchases to represent those
08:21 - different tiers as well so you have a
08:23 - one-year silver
08:24 - a year gold and a one year pro products
08:27 - so you have three different products
08:29 - so in revenue cat when you create these
08:31 - three levels of entitlement
08:33 - you just indicate which product unlocks
08:36 - which level
08:37 - so you might add the one year silver
08:39 - product
08:40 - in the silver entitlement which
08:42 - indicates if someone purchases that
08:45 - in-app purchase it's going to unlock
08:47 - that level of entitlement for them
08:50 - and keep in mind if you had a one-year
08:52 - silver product and the one month silver
08:54 - product you can add both of those
08:55 - to your silver entitlement level and
08:58 - this way
08:59 - when you want to check if the user has
09:02 - the silver membership level you don't
09:03 - have to check
09:04 - which product the user has you just
09:07 - check if they have this entitlement
09:09 - because if they've purchased one of
09:11 - those products inside
09:13 - that entitlement that means they will
09:15 - have access
09:16 - to that silver entitlement level so
09:19 - essentially here you're just configuring
09:21 - which
09:22 - products would unlock which entitlement
09:24 - levels for the user
09:27 - all right now that you understand this
09:29 - let's hop into the revenue cat
09:31 - dashboard and let's actually configure
09:33 - all of this
09:35 - all right let's go ahead and configure
09:36 - our products offerings and entitlements
09:39 - first we're going to go to the app that
09:41 - we had created
09:42 - and added and here we're going to jump
09:45 - into products
09:46 - straight away because the first thing
09:47 - we're going to do is add those two
09:49 - in-app purchases that we created in the
09:52 - app store connect side
09:53 - now the thing we're going to need is the
09:55 - product id remember these ids are unique
09:57 - across
09:58 - your entire account so we're going to
10:00 - select the yearly one here
10:03 - copy that and let's go back to our
10:07 - revenue cat demo here and let's click on
10:09 - new product
10:11 - the identifier is just what we had
10:13 - configured on the app store connect
10:15 - we're gonna paste that in there and then
10:16 - we're gonna select the app store
10:18 - let's click add let's do the same thing
10:21 - with the second one here
10:26 - that's the monthly one and again it's an
10:28 - app store
10:30 - now if we had additional ones for the
10:32 - play store
10:33 - or any other store we would put that in
10:35 - here but this is what we have
10:36 - the next thing we're going to do is
10:38 - configure our offerings
10:40 - so let's jump into here and let's choose
10:43 - a new offering so for the identifier i'm
10:46 - going to put
10:48 - pro access all products
10:53 - and this is a string that we're going to
10:55 - be checking against later in xcode when
10:57 - we go to fetch the offerings from the
10:59 - revenue cap platform
11:00 - to present to the user for this offering
11:03 - i want to
11:04 - offer everything to the user all of the
11:07 - different durations
11:08 - and subscriptions that we have to access
11:12 - proaccess
11:12 - and so that's why i'm naming it this way
11:17 - i'm going to say pro access to all
11:19 - features
11:20 - and let's go ahead and click add now
11:23 - inside this new offering that we have
11:25 - it has zero packages so we're going to
11:27 - click into that and we're going to add
11:29 - two packages one for the yearly option
11:31 - and one for the monthly option
11:34 - so let's click new this is going to be
11:37 - annual
11:39 - let's say annual access to all pro
11:41 - features let's add that package
11:44 - and inside this annual package there's
11:46 - zero products we're gonna fix that in
11:47 - just a second but let me just add the
11:49 - second
11:49 - package while we're at it so the
11:51 - identifier is gonna be monthly for this
11:53 - one and this is monthly access to all
11:55 - pro features
11:56 - so let's go ahead and add that so now
11:58 - our offering has two packages
12:00 - annual and monthly let's proceed to add
12:03 - the actual products
12:04 - into these packages if you remember a
12:07 - package
12:07 - is just the grouping of similar products
12:10 - on various platforms since we only have
12:14 - apple app store right now each of these
12:16 - packages essentially only contains
12:18 - one product let's go ahead and attach
12:22 - and you can see here we're going to
12:24 - select the yearly one
12:25 - under app store if we had added the play
12:27 - store product or
12:28 - you know products um of a similar nature
12:32 - that represents a one-year access on the
12:35 - other stores we would also configure
12:36 - that here but
12:38 - again we only have the app store one
12:41 - let's go back to packages and do it for
12:42 - monthly now
12:44 - and let's attach the monthly one
12:48 - you can see how easy it makes it to have
12:50 - all of the information when you name it
12:52 - this way that they recommended
12:54 - all right now we're done we have a
12:56 - single offering
12:58 - with the identifier pro access all
13:00 - products inside contains two packages
13:02 - annual and monthly and inside those
13:04 - packages contains the products
13:06 - that the user is going to see for that
13:09 - tier
13:10 - the next thing we want to do is
13:13 - configure our entitlements
13:15 - and so far i've only talked about pro
13:17 - access and that's the only entitlement
13:19 - that we're going
13:20 - to have we're not going to have multiple
13:21 - tiers but you can do that
13:23 - we're going to click on new under
13:24 - entitlements and this is just going to
13:26 - be
13:27 - pro all right and this side again
13:30 - is going to be a string that we check
13:31 - against in xcode
13:33 - so when we want to see if that user
13:36 - has the pro entitlement to be able to
13:39 - access all the pro level content
13:41 - we're going to see if that user has the
13:44 - entitlement with this id
13:46 - pro again pro access to all the features
13:49 - let's click add and now we have to add
13:52 - the products which
13:53 - actually unlock this entitlement level
13:56 - so far there's zero products that do
13:58 - that
13:59 - but i'm going to change that so let's go
14:01 - ahead and attach
14:03 - all of our products see the one year
14:05 - subscription is going to unlock
14:07 - this entitlement as well as the one
14:10 - month
14:11 - subscription that's going to unlock pro
14:13 - as well
14:14 - and essentially now we're completely
14:16 - done
14:17 - this is a basic configuration of
14:21 - your products offerings and entitlements
14:22 - but you can do so much more
14:24 - when you have more products and you
14:26 - really start
14:27 - diving deep into how to optimize your
14:29 - revenue per user
14:31 - so there's a lot more to this revenue
14:33 - cap platform than we're just covering
14:35 - here
14:35 - in this video series so if you want to
14:37 - see more complex
14:38 - use cases with revenue cat and ways to
14:41 - optimize your revenue
14:42 - peeking into the analytics and really
14:44 - diving deep make sure you show them some
14:46 - love
14:46 - make sure you comment make sure you

14:49 - through that link cwc.to
14:52 - revcat3 and that's going to let them
14:54 - know that we're really excited to see
14:55 - more
14:56 - content on in-app purchases and app
14:58 - monetization
14:59 - alright let's move on in this lesson you
15:02 - learned all about how revenuecat manages
15:04 - products
15:05 - offerings and entitlements if you
15:06 - haven't signed up for your free revenue
15:08 - cat account yet
15:09 - you can do so through cwc.to revcat3
15:13 - now i want to turn it over to you do you
15:15 - have any apps in the app store and are
15:16 - you making any money from them
15:18 - let me know by leaving a quick comment
15:20 - below lastly if you enjoyed this video

15:23 - forget to subscribe so you don't miss
15:25 - the next
15:26 - lesson in the next lesson we're going to
15:28 - be diving into xcode to build that tor
15:30 - app demo where we ultimately will
15:32 - display our in-app subscriptions for
15:34 - people to purchase
15:35 - all right thanks for watching and i'll
15:37 - see you there
