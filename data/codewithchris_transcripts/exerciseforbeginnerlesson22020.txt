00:00 - hello and welcome to the lesson to
00:01 - exercise now if you haven't checked out
00:04 - the beginner series yet I would highly
00:06 - recommend that you do that because this
00:08 - exercise is specifically intended to be
00:11 - done after you've completed lesson two
00:14 - so go ahead and check out the beginner
00:16 - series either in the link in the
00:17 - description below or check up in the
00:20 - upper right corner so this is what
00:22 - you're going to be completing as part of
00:25 - this exercise now have all of the image
00:27 - assets that you need for download just
00:29 - below the video so go ahead and grab
00:31 - those assets fire up a brand new single
00:34 - view application Xcode project and using
00:37 - what you've learned to try to put this
00:38 - together so at this point what I do is
00:40 - just pause the video and try this out
00:42 - for yourself if you get stuck something
00:44 - doesn't look right you can't get
00:46 - something looking the way you want then
00:47 - come back and watch this video from this
00:49 - point on because from here on out I'm
00:51 - going to be building this and showing
00:54 - you how to do it
00:55 - [Applause]
00:59 - [Music]
01:01 - so here I've started a brand new Xcode
01:04 - project I'm going to choose single view
01:06 - app and let's call this a lesson 2
01:09 - exercise solution and you know all of
01:14 - this stuff is fine I mean all we're
01:16 - doing is customizing how it looks in the
01:20 - storyboard so we're gonna be working in
01:24 - the storyboard here the first thing to
01:27 - do though is grab those image assets and
01:29 - put them into your asset library so I've
01:32 - actually got them right here
01:33 - so I'm just gonna grab them all and put
01:36 - them in so let's just take a look at
01:39 - what we have we have this breakfast
01:41 - image which is from pixels comm and I've
01:45 - got the icon and then I've got a
01:49 - gradient for the bottom and the gradient
01:51 - for the top now gradients can actually
01:53 - be done you don't have to use image
01:56 - assets but at this point in your iOS
01:59 - journey this is probably the easiest way
02:01 - for you to do it so I'm gonna start here
02:05 - by first putting in that big breakfast
02:09 - image let's open up the object library
02:13 - and choose image view and if you don't
02:16 - remember the shortcut key just click on
02:18 - this icon up here we're gonna add the
02:22 - image view so let's also stretch it out
02:25 - to all four sides we're going to uncheck
02:28 - constrain to margins because we want it
02:30 - to be to the very edge and we're also
02:32 - going to make sure that each of these
02:34 - margins that we're specifying is
02:37 - relative to the view and not the safe
02:44 - area and then we're going to proceed to
02:46 - set them all to zero so let's go ahead
02:49 - and add these four constraints and then
02:52 - set the image for this guy to our
02:55 - breakfast now just in case it's a little
02:58 - bit stretched change the content mode
03:01 - from scale to fill which is the default
03:04 - two aspect fill and that's going to
03:06 - maintain the proper aspect ratio while
03:09 - filling up the space of the uiimageview
03:11 - you can see that it looks
03:13 - a little bright we're gonna add our
03:15 - gradients now so again open up your
03:18 - object library and just put an image
03:19 - down there like that and this time we're
03:22 - going to add three constraints left
03:25 - right and top and this is going to be
03:27 - that top gradient so I'm going to go
03:29 - ahead and open this guy up
03:31 - uncheck constrain to margins again
03:33 - enable the three and then I'm going to
03:36 - make sure that it's relative to the view
03:39 - so it goes to the very edge because we
03:45 - want it to be at the very edge and not
03:47 - it doesn't matter if it's obscured by
03:49 - the battery indicator or the time or the
03:52 - notch or anything like that and so
03:54 - that's why we specify this relative to
03:56 - the view and not the safe area all right
03:59 - so we get some constraint errors but
04:01 - let's set the image first so we're gonna
04:04 - choose top gradient and that is going to
04:08 - that's going to look okay like that
04:10 - we're gonna add a second image view and
04:13 - put it near the bottom right here and
04:14 - this one's going to be the bottom
04:16 - gradient and we're going to set the left
04:17 - right and bottom constraints for this
04:20 - guy so same exact thing uncheck
04:23 - constraint margins we're going to enable
04:24 - these three and then we're going to
04:26 - choose relative to the view okay now
04:31 - let's set these guys go zero and then
04:33 - click add three constraints then we're
04:36 - going to set the image to bottom
04:37 - gradient so we get something like that
04:39 - now the next step is to add the icon
04:43 - first so again we're going to be adding
04:46 - another image view like that and I'm
04:49 - going to set the image to heart health
04:53 - and then I'm going to add a top and
04:58 - right margin and this time I'm going to
05:00 - leave this on and I'm going to leave it
05:04 - relative to the safe area I'm gonna say
05:07 - oops
05:08 - I don't want it add constraint just the
05:11 - left and the right sorry the top and the
05:14 - right let's add these two and we've got
05:16 - our little icon there
05:18 - alright we're nearly there so let's add
05:21 - our label right here and this one let's
05:25 - just change the text to white first
05:27 - so we can actually see what it's saying
05:28 - and then we are going to leave
05:32 - constraint margins on I'm going to do
05:34 - left and top and we're going to do 20
05:37 - and 20 and again this is by default
05:40 - relative to the safe area so we know
05:43 - that this label isn't going to get
05:44 - blocked by anything so let's add these
05:47 - two constraints right there
05:48 - and we're gonna set the toast to I think
05:51 - it was hardcore above toast and then
05:55 - we're going to click this font and let's
05:59 - just make it a little bigger I forget
06:00 - exactly what size I used but let's say
06:05 - 30 and I think actually I had a custom
06:07 - font so I used that you can choose
06:10 - anything you want it doesn't really
06:12 - matter I'm going to choose a veneer next
06:15 - deme bold and just do 40 oh that's way
06:19 - too big 30 all right and what you can do
06:26 - at this point if you want it to wrap to
06:27 - two lines you can change your number of
06:31 - length is zero which just means multi
06:34 - lines and you can actually either set a
06:38 - width so if you set a width say cutting
06:40 - it off right here at the point at the a
06:43 - it's going to automatically wrap a vote
06:46 - oast to the next line or you can change
06:49 - your text and you can manually specify a
06:51 - line break so hold down control and hit
06:55 - enter like that to create a double line
06:59 - label you just hit enter
07:00 - so you've got that and we're gonna add
07:04 - another label this time down here and
07:08 - let's set this font to white and we're
07:12 - going to make this label cling on to the
07:18 - left the right and the bottom and just
07:22 - say 20 20 and 20 and again let's make
07:28 - this a multi-line label by setting the
07:31 - number of lines to zero and I forget
07:34 - exactly what text I had but let me just
07:37 - write something here
07:38 - this breakfast is so healthy and will
07:45 - give you so much energy that you'll be
07:50 - able to accomplish anything today
07:55 - [Applause]
07:56 - actually I don't think I had this much
07:59 - text in in the version I showed you but
08:01 - it's fine so you know even though I
08:05 - might not have chose the exact font size
08:08 - and the exact font that I used in the
08:12 - demo that I showed you in the beginning
08:13 - of the video you kind of get the idea
08:15 - about how to build this UI so I hope you
08:18 - were able to do it on your own if not I
08:20 - hope you're able to do it after watching
08:22 - this I would give it another try if you
08:25 - got stuck just so you can get some extra
08:28 - practice and because it's really once
08:30 - you start doing it you're going to then
08:32 - realize what you don't know if you're
08:34 - just watching me you don't know what you
08:36 - don't know right so definitely give it a
08:38 - try all right I'll see you in the next
08:40 - one
