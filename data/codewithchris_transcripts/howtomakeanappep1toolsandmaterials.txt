00:05 - hey guys welcome to how to make iPhone
00:07 - apps with no programming experience this
00:10 - is lesson one tools and materials and
00:13 - this video is going to serve as a
00:15 - checklist of what you'll need to uh
00:18 - proceed on this journey of learning iOS
00:20 - development and a little bit of an
00:22 - orientation on all the things that
00:24 - you'll be seeing and using now the only
00:26 - thing you really need in order to learn
00:28 - iOS development is a Mac and That's
00:31 - essential because that's the only way
00:33 - you're going to be able to follow along
00:35 - and practice now the reason you need a
00:37 - Mac is because the program that we use
00:40 - to build apps on and to write our code
00:42 - only runs on OSX which is the operating
00:45 - system for a Mac now you may have heard
00:48 - of some solutions that run on PCS or
00:50 - Windows but those are thirdparty
00:52 - solutions not endorsed by or supported
00:55 - by Apple so in the lessons that proceed
00:58 - we're going to be using official Apple
01:00 - tools and materials and we're going to
01:02 - do it the way that it was meant to be
01:04 - done and a Mac doesn't have to be
01:06 - expensive for example I'm still using
01:09 - the MacBook Pro that I bought in 2011
01:13 - and it's still running all of the latest
01:14 - software fine without any performance
01:16 - issues so if you're on a budget I would
01:19 - recommend to buy a used Macbook or a
01:22 - used Mac so now that you have your Mac
01:24 - we can download that program which I
01:26 - mentioned where we'll be writing our
01:28 - code and creating our app in and that
01:31 - program is called xcode it's available
01:33 - in the Mac App Store for free the only
01:36 - requirement is that you need at least
01:38 - OSX 10.9.5 to run it and that translates
01:43 - to OSX Mavericks which is also free it's
01:46 - a free upgrade if you're running an
01:48 - operating system that's lower than that
01:50 - and as I mentioned my 2011 MacBook is
01:53 - still running OSX Mavericks fine so what
01:57 - does this xcode program allow you to do
02:00 - well if you think about an app for a
02:02 - second at the very basic level it
02:04 - consists of two things the first thing
02:06 - being the user interface that's what the
02:09 - user sees on the phone and what the user
02:11 - interacts with and the second thing is
02:15 - all of the logic and response that
02:17 - happens uh in response to the user
02:20 - interacting with the app so xcode allows
02:24 - you to create this user interface
02:27 - visually in fact if you'd like uh just
02:30 - by dragging and dropping elements onto
02:32 - the screen and second of all it allows
02:36 - you to write that logic and express that
02:39 - logic in terms of code so you're able to
02:42 - code what happens when a user Taps that
02:45 - button or what happens when the user
02:47 - swipes and you're able to use that code
02:50 - to perform calculations or go fetch data
02:53 - or respond to the user or update the
02:55 - view furthermore xcode also allows us to
02:59 - test our app so in addition to creating
03:02 - the user interface and wiring up that
03:05 - logic with code we can run the app in
03:08 - xcode and xcode has a great simulator
03:12 - which will appear on your screen to
03:14 - mimic the iPhone and it'll run your app
03:17 - inside of that so you can see what your
03:20 - app looks like and you can use and test
03:22 - your app without actually having a an
03:26 - iPhone so it's not even a requirement to
03:28 - have a device if you want to build an
03:30 - iPhone app I mentioned that we use code
03:34 - to express the logic and what happens
03:37 - when the user interacts with your app's
03:39 - user interface well that code follows a
03:44 - set of rules and follows a certain
03:47 - framework just like a language that's
03:49 - why it's called a programming language
03:52 - you may have heard that Apple released
03:53 - the second programming language for
03:55 - building iPhone apps called Swift and
03:58 - this is what the lessons and the course
04:00 - is going to teach you how to use the
04:02 - reason Swift is better for beginners to
04:05 - learn how to build apps with is because
04:08 - the syntax and the structure of the
04:09 - language is a lot more natural and
04:12 - intuitive so it's a lot easier to read
04:15 - and to understand for beginners in the
04:17 - past when I taught the course with
04:19 - objective c a lot of beginners struggled
04:23 - with the syntax and all of the different
04:26 - symbols and characters that would be
04:28 - used to write the code beginners would
04:31 - struggle with remembering what keywords
04:33 - to use and how to declare certain things
04:37 - with swift the syntax is more of like
04:40 - plain English so it feels less like
04:42 - you'll have to learn a separate language
04:44 - so I'm really excited to show you guys
04:46 - how to use Swift so that's all there
04:49 - really is to it at the very core you're
04:52 - going to be learning how to use xcode to
04:54 - build your user interface and you're
04:56 - going to learn the Swift programming
04:58 - language to to respond to user events
05:02 - and user gestures and to express
05:05 - logic so after you finished building
05:07 - your app and X code and testing it in
05:09 - the simulator how are you going to get
05:11 - it on your device or how are you going
05:13 - to get it into the App Store well this
05:15 - part actually requires you to have an
05:18 - apple developer membership and this is a
05:21 - yearly fee that Apple charges it's $99
05:24 - as of the recording it has been actually
05:28 - ever since the Inception of the program
05:30 - it's been $99 a year and that allows you
05:33 - to publish as many apps as you want into
05:35 - the App Store and it allows you to
05:39 - install your app on a device
05:42 - unfortunately there's no other way to
05:44 - put your app on an actual device unless
05:47 - you are a member of this program so when
05:50 - you sign up for the Apple developer
05:52 - program it gives you access into two
05:55 - things one is called the provisioning
05:57 - portal which is the place where you
06:00 - upload your certificates and create your
06:02 - profiles that dictate which devices your
06:05 - app can be installed on uh and the
06:08 - second thing gives you access to is
06:10 - iTunes connect and that's the place
06:13 - where you're going to create the catalog
06:14 - listing for your app you're going to
06:16 - upload your screenshots it's basically
06:18 - when you browse the App Store and you
06:20 - see all of those app listings with the
06:22 - description and the screenshots and the
06:24 - price and everything you create those
06:27 - things in iTunes connect so you're going
06:29 - to create the app listing for your app
06:32 - in iTunes connect and then you're going
06:34 - to upload what you've created an xcode
06:38 - and then that's where you publish it
06:39 - into the store in iTunes connect you can
06:42 - also check the stats for your app in
06:44 - terms of downloads and rankings and if
06:47 - you have ads or if you have I add in
06:49 - your app you can check your earnings and
06:52 - you can get those types of reports and
06:55 - if you have inapp purchases iTunes
06:56 - connect is where you would configure
06:58 - that sort of stuff as well
07:00 - so there you have it the only thing you
07:02 - really require is a Mac which will allow
07:05 - you to install xcode which is free uh to
07:09 - build your apps and to test your apps
07:11 - and then if you want to deploy your apps
07:14 - on the phone and deploy is just a fancy
07:16 - word for install if you want to deploy
07:18 - your apps into the app store or on an
07:21 - actual device you can sign up for the
07:23 - Apple developer program which gives you
07:25 - access to two websites to allow you to
07:27 - do that sort of stuff so I hope hope
07:29 - that was useful to help you understand
07:31 - the ecosystem and all of the tools and
07:33 - materials that we'll be using in the
07:35 - next lesson we'll get started with
07:37 - dabbling and some Swift Code
