00:00 - hey it's Chris here and today I'm going to 
show you how to use a disclosure group inside  
00:03 - your Swift UI project now a disclosure group 
allows you to show or hide content depending  
00:09 - on the state of the disclosure group 
all right let's Dive Right In before  
00:13 - we begin one quick note we have a free exco 
project containing sample code for all of the  
00:18 - Swift UI components use it for your own 
projects or just to learn from get it at
00:30 - scen I have a couple of toggle switches I have a 
stepper right here and sometimes when you're doing  
00:34 - all of these settings you want to hide it under 
a group and that's exactly what the disclosure  
00:39 - group is for so let me show you how that works 
all I'm going to do is I'm going to wrap this  
00:45 - entire vstack that contains these elements inside 
of a disclosure group so here's what it looks like  
00:52 - disclosure group and you just have to add a title 
so I'll call this audio settings and the content  
00:59 - this can be a closure containing all of your stuff 
right here right so what's instantly happened is  
01:08 - I have a category now a disclosure group and I 
can expand it to show my elements so let's go  
01:15 - ahead and add some padding in there actually like 
that now what you can also do is use a disclosure  
01:24 - group inside of a form so let's wrap this into a 
form inside a form and see what that looks like
01:32 - get rid of that padding there all right so 
this looks like a typical settings inside  
01:39 - an IOS app right and that's how easy it is 
to use now let's take it one step further  
01:44 - if you want to programmatically control 
the disclosure group or perhaps detect  
01:48 - programmatically whether it's open 
or closed there's another parameter  
01:52 - called is expanded and you can bind it to 
a Boolean State Property so create one here
02:05 - so we'll say false like that and then just bind 
to that and by using this you can control the  
02:15 - state of the disclosure group and you can also 
detect whether it's open or closed if you want  
02:20 - to download the sample code for this we've 
got it all in a single handy xcode project  
02:24 - in fact it contains a sample code for all of the 
Swift UI components so that you can learn from  
02:30 - or copy and paste the code into your 
own project just visit cc. swiftui  
02:36 - dkit it's a free download I'll leave it 
in the description below the video too
