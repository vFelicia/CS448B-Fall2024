00:01 - [Music]
00:06 - hey there it's chris
00:06 - wanted to give you a quick status update
00:08 - on how the app is going
00:11 - a lot of the ui is still not there
00:14 - we've mostly been trying to get the
00:16 - pieces the functionality in there first
00:19 - integrating facebook login was pretty
00:22 - tough to be honest
00:23 - even though they have an sdk to make it
00:25 - easy their documentation is not very
00:27 - good so it's really those
00:28 - tiny edge cases and
00:33 - you know these these different scenarios
00:34 - that are hard to troubleshoot
00:36 - so for example we have to request
00:39 - certain permissions
00:41 - from the user in order to be able to
00:44 - access their instagram account
00:45 - through their facebook login
00:49 - and with a couple of the user sorry with
00:52 - a couple of the facebook
00:53 - accounts that we were logging in with
00:56 - namely
00:57 - some test accounts that we had it wasn't
00:59 - really asking for the right permissions
01:02 - it wasn't asking for permissions at all
01:04 - so we would be able to log into the app
01:06 - and authenticate the user but we
01:08 - wouldn't be able to do anything
01:10 - with their instagram account because we
01:12 - didn't uh get their token
01:14 - uh however we we banged our heads
01:18 - against this wall for a while
01:20 - until trying a couple of different
01:22 - facebook
01:23 - um accounts namely our own personal ones
01:27 - and that's when it started asking me
01:31 - for the proper permissions so the the
01:34 - this web view that is shown was
01:36 - completely different and there was
01:38 - no indication of why this was the case
01:41 - in the documentation
01:43 - and we couldn't figure out what the
01:45 - difference was between the facebook
01:46 - accounts we were using first
01:48 - versus the these ones that we're using
01:50 - now and so
01:52 - it's still a little bit of a mystery but
01:54 - i think that when you're working with
01:57 - you know other people's platforms some
02:00 - of the things
02:01 - like that are beyond your control so all
02:03 - we can hope for now is that
02:04 - uh when we roll this out to more people
02:07 - for beta
02:08 - testing that the results come back
02:10 - favorably maybe
02:11 - what we saw was just due to the fact
02:13 - that we were using
02:15 - test accounts okay so i want to show you
02:18 - where we're at so now
02:19 - we can log in through facebook and the
02:23 - api we're using does require people to
02:25 - have an instagram business account and
02:27 - it has to be connected to their facebook
02:29 - page and all that stuff
02:31 - so i do have that set up and that's why
02:32 - i'm able to select
02:34 - this instagram business account that i
02:36 - want to use
02:38 - so this this only shows up because we
02:40 - haven't submitted our app
02:41 - for um facebook review because facebook
02:44 - has to review that you're using their
02:47 - api properly before they'll approve it
02:51 - so that's just saying that it's not
02:53 - approved yet
02:54 - okay so then you click ok and then
02:58 - you come to this screen i'm going to
03:00 - show you the user journey in just a
03:02 - second
03:02 - this right now is just the state of the
03:05 - current app
03:06 - so you can go to the edit screen and you
03:08 - can add new usernames
03:09 - and you can remove usernames from here
03:11 - and then you hit here you can hit the
03:13 - username and it's going to pull down the
03:14 - stats
03:15 - now um we focused on just laying out the
03:19 - data
03:20 - uh in a rough sort of way based on the
03:23 - wireframes that we did
03:24 - um we're still going to wait on the
03:27 - designs before
03:28 - cleaning all of this up so the data is
03:30 - all here it's just
03:32 - you can see it's it's not pretty and
03:33 - it's all over the place
03:35 - we've also implemented a third party
03:37 - library called
03:38 - sd web image that's going that makes it
03:41 - really easy to fetch
03:42 - images via a url so highly recommend
03:45 - that
03:46 - okay so this is this is where we're at
03:48 - like this works for any profile i put in
03:51 - so for example if i put in
03:52 - um maybe ariana grande was one of the
03:56 - examples we used quite frequently so
04:00 - you know and we're obviously going to
04:01 - have to correct that so
04:04 - um the user doesn't see a flash of the
04:08 - prior username before loading the new
04:11 - one
04:11 - so anyways that's the where the current
04:15 - app is at i want to show you
04:18 - what the proposed user journey is and
04:20 - what we're trying to design for
04:23 - so the main navigation at the bottom is
04:25 - going to be
04:26 - a tab sort of tab view essentially
04:29 - and we're going to have four tabs so
04:31 - we're going to have a profile
04:33 - which is what you've seen down here
04:35 - we're going to have a list
04:36 - which is the list of users we're going
04:38 - to have a settings screen and we're
04:40 - going to have a premium
04:41 - section which is you know what you can
04:43 - pay for to get more
04:44 - functionality of that so
04:48 - we were thinking that the initial log on
04:52 - sorry the initial app launch would look
04:55 - like
04:56 - this where we'd have a dummy account
04:58 - with data
04:59 - and we would basically tell people to
05:03 - give them a rough welcome and tell them
05:05 - to start playing around
05:06 - with the metrics to learn about it
05:09 - because one of the ways we could have
05:10 - done it
05:10 - is to take them on a guided tour and
05:14 - highlight different
05:16 - pieces of this profile analytics and
05:18 - tell them what it's all about
05:19 - but since we're planning to allow people
05:21 - to tap on all of these blocks to show
05:23 - a tool tip and to tell them what the
05:25 - metric is and how they can use it
05:26 - i want people to ex learn by exploring
05:29 - so they're going to hit ok to dismiss
05:31 - this pop-up
05:32 - it's going to show them this dummy
05:34 - account they can tap on these different
05:35 - things and
05:36 - see what it's all about let's play
05:37 - around with the profile and then when
05:39 - they click on list
05:41 - it's going to look like this with the
05:42 - dummy profile here but they won't be
05:44 - able to tap that because
05:46 - the first thing they have to do is log
05:47 - in and connect their
05:49 - instagram account we need their access
05:50 - token in order to be able to make
05:53 - those requests to get the data from
05:58 - the facebook servers so you're going to
06:00 - need an instagram business account like
06:02 - there will be some education here
06:04 - as to what they need so you're gonna
06:06 - click login
06:08 - and this is the facebook you know web
06:10 - view that you just saw earlier in this
06:12 - video they're gonna hit submit
06:13 - and then after that we're gonna pop up a
06:16 - little um
06:17 - paywall a soft pay wall to tell just to
06:20 - tell people like what they have access
06:22 - to now
06:23 - and we the app does have more
06:25 - functionality
06:26 - more to offer and they can sign up for a
06:29 - free trial now
06:30 - um and it would tell them what they
06:32 - would get so this is all sort of up in
06:34 - the air
06:35 - for discussion but we did have plans to
06:37 - monetize the app
06:39 - um and i think it would make it a much
06:41 - more interesting experiment
06:43 - but we're not going to try to hide the
06:46 - close button and sort of trick people
06:48 - into
06:49 - into signing up i don't think that's at
06:52 - least that's not the way i want to do
06:54 - business
06:54 - right so they'll hit not right now if
06:57 - they don't want to sign up
06:58 - or take the free trial and then that's
07:00 - going to dismiss that window and they're
07:02 - going to
07:02 - come to something like this where they
07:04 - can add new usernames
07:06 - and they can swipe to delete usernames
07:09 - and when they tap on one of these
07:11 - usernames it's going to
07:14 - transition to the profile tab and it's
07:17 - going to show them
07:19 - the profile which they um which they
07:21 - selected
07:24 - so that's that um the settings screen
07:26 - has a bunch of different proposed
07:28 - settings and these are all
07:30 - sort of up in the air as well this would
07:31 - link to the app store this would link to
07:33 - a way for them to submit feedback
07:35 - privacy policy facebook log out delete
07:38 - account change log restore purchases
07:40 - pretty standard stuff
07:41 - and then the last tab premium here would
07:44 - just show
07:44 - the options for you know unlocking that
07:47 - extra functionality
07:49 - and if they are already signed
07:52 - up as a premium member then this tab
07:55 - will
07:56 - not show up at all so then it'd just be
07:58 - three tabs
08:00 - i think that's all i have to say like
08:02 - some functionality such as this
08:04 - copy all hashtags uh this would exist
08:07 - here but when they tap on it it would
08:08 - say like hey this is a premium feature
08:10 - considered signing up for a free trial
08:12 - or joining
08:14 - for a couple of dollars a month to
08:16 - unlock this feature
08:17 - um that's that's pretty much it for the
08:21 - user flow
08:23 - so anyways this is what i came up with
08:28 - in an afternoon which i proposed to our
08:30 - designer so we started
08:31 - a discussion on it and
08:34 - as i told you one of the reasons i
08:36 - really like figma is because of this
08:37 - functionality where you can collaborate
08:39 - so you can see
08:40 - that he had you know different comments
08:43 - to say
08:43 - on on the flow and you know i respond
08:47 - and we were able to respond here and so
08:49 - it's a dialogue
08:50 - it's really good for working remotely um
08:54 - yeah so we're just sort of hashing out
08:56 - this user flow and then he's going to
08:57 - start
08:58 - wrapping some design on it so he's
09:00 - already started thinking about
09:03 - colors and how things will look and
09:04 - stuff like that and he
09:07 - this is all stuff that he hasn't really
09:09 - shown me yet so
09:11 - you're sort of getting a preview of what
09:12 - he's working on i don't know how
09:14 - finalized these are
09:15 - to be honest but anyways that's where
09:17 - we're at right now
09:18 - um i'm really excited to see this
09:22 - come together and we're still targeting
09:26 - end of april but i i realize how fast
09:29 - that's coming up because
09:31 - although it looks like we have a lot of
09:32 - the functionality down
09:34 - i think that last 20 that last 15
09:38 - is gonna take the longest and from what
09:41 - i've been reading
09:42 - getting your um facebook app
09:45 - approved you know by the facebook review
09:48 - team can take up to two weeks
09:50 - and the apple review process is really
09:52 - quick now getting it into the app store
09:54 - is just a few days
09:55 - they've really improved on that but
09:57 - getting you know
09:58 - getting approved to use this facebook
10:00 - button and use their api could take up
10:02 - to two weeks
10:03 - and then also factoring in that we need
10:05 - to create a website
10:07 - for this you know it could be a
10:08 - one-pager but that's still something
10:10 - that we need to do
10:12 - um you have to come up with all of the
10:14 - text for the web page
10:15 - the privacy policy you know all of this
10:18 - thing all these little details
10:19 - and uh end of april i think it's doable
10:24 - um although
10:27 - it's not a big buffer i think we if
10:29 - anything we'll just make it
10:31 - but it'll be interesting nonetheless
10:33 - definitely learning a lot thank you so
10:34 - much for following along
10:36 - i'll see you in the next video
