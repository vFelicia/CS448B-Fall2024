00:06 - hello in this video I'm gonna show you
00:09 - guys another common error message and
00:12 - what might be the cause of it so let me
00:15 - first go through the code that I have
00:17 - here I have an iboutlet which is an
00:22 - image view and it's called my image view
00:25 - so this property or this outlet is
00:28 - connected to a UI image view element in
00:32 - my storyboard if you've gone through my
00:34 - first 15 beginner lessons on my youtube
00:38 - page you'll know that you know you can
00:41 - add elements onto your storyboard like I
00:43 - have here a UI image view that's used to
00:46 - display an image and you can connect
00:49 - them to the code file or the swift file
00:52 - and then you can use code to set the
00:56 - properties of it so what am i doing here
00:59 - this is the second line that I want to
01:01 - show you guys I'm referencing that image
01:04 - view and it has an image property and
01:07 - I'm setting that image property to a new
01:12 - UI image object I'm just setting some
01:14 - random name of an image that doesn't
01:17 - exist but that's irrelevant so what I'm
01:20 - trying to do here with this line is set
01:23 - the image of the image view so that I
01:25 - can display some sort of image and when
01:27 - I run this I get an error in the console
01:32 - window here
01:33 - you don't have this console window make
01:36 - sure you have this lower button here
01:38 - highlighted so it shows it if you don't
01:41 - see this area at all down here click
01:44 - this icon here to reveal that pane okay
01:48 - so the error message is unrecognized
01:52 - selector sent to instance something and
01:56 - selector is another name for method or
01:59 - function so what it's saying is that it
02:02 - doesn't recognize the function that
02:04 - you're trying to call on this object to
02:07 - put it in plain words and it tells you
02:10 - right here that
02:12 - you're trying to call the set image
02:15 - method here of an object that is a
02:21 - uibutton well that's really strange
02:24 - because I could have sworn that my
02:27 - property is a type of uiimageview and I
02:31 - know for a fact that uiimageview has a
02:35 - method called set image or when you set
02:39 - the image property it's actually behind
02:41 - the scenes it's calling the set image
02:43 - method so that's why it's telling you
02:46 - that it has this error well
02:48 - this error message says that you're
02:49 - trying to set you're trying to call this
02:52 - set image method on a button so that
02:55 - tells you that maybe the element that is
02:59 - connected to this property even though
03:01 - we think it is a uiimageview is not
03:03 - actually and I see this happen a lot
03:05 - because in the storyboard you may have
03:08 - elements overlapping each other and it's
03:11 - kind of hard to tell so when you are
03:13 - connecting your IB outlets when you're
03:16 - connecting these elements to the swift
03:19 - file so I'm going to click the assistant
03:22 - editor button here it shows you
03:23 - side-by-side so that you can click and
03:26 - drag and connect your elements to the
03:28 - right-hand sides of the code file here
03:30 - so what must have happened is I must
03:33 - have accidentally highlighted the button
03:36 - and held down ctrl and drag it over here
03:41 - and connected my button but I named it
03:43 - the image view thinking that I was
03:45 - dragging the image view so that's where
03:48 - the error is in fact if I right click
03:51 - the button you can see down here in
03:54 - referencing outlets that this button is
03:56 - connected to the my image view property
03:59 - of this view controller so I just want
04:03 - to click the X and break that connection
04:05 - so you can see here now that this grey
04:10 - dot is empty is an empty circle meaning
04:14 - that this property is no longer
04:16 - connected or this outlets no longer
04:18 - connected so one surefire way of
04:20 - connecting outlets is instead to use
04:22 - this document outline and you can select
04:26 - the element from this listing and it
04:28 - hold down control and drag it all the
04:31 - way here and then create your outlet
04:34 - that way so you don't see this document
04:36 - outline in your storyboard there's a
04:38 - button down here you can hide it and
04:40 - show it like that so now that we've
04:43 - already written this outlet what if I
04:45 - don't want to create a new one because
04:47 - right now it's not connected to anything
04:48 - right there's an empty grey circle so
04:50 - what I can do is I can right click or
04:53 - command + click if you have a one-button
04:57 - mouse the image view and then down here
04:59 - in referencing outlets go here to the
05:02 - circle drag you don't have to hold down
05:04 - control you just click and drag it drag
05:06 - it to the view controller up here let go
05:09 - and you can see here that you can
05:11 - connect it to the my image view property
05:13 - so I'm going to do that now you can see
05:16 - that under referencing outlets this
05:18 - image view element is connected to the
05:21 - my image view property like that and now
05:25 - on the side you can see that this circle
05:30 - is highlighted in gray solid gray
05:32 - meaning that it's connected so now my
05:34 - app won't crash because it's going to
05:36 - call and just run it it's going to call
05:40 - set image on a UI image view element
05:44 - which is what we expected but
05:47 - unfortunately you also won't see any
05:49 - image because I don't actually have an
05:51 - image called my image name but you can
05:55 - see that there's no crash now so if you
05:58 - see an error message in your console
06:00 - that says something like unrecognized
06:02 - selector sent to instance something dig
06:05 - around in the console to find out what
06:07 - element is actually connected to that
06:10 - property in my case I was trying to call
06:13 - the set image method on a button and in
06:15 - the console area I could see that that
06:17 - outlet was connected to a button rather
06:19 - than a UI image element as I was
06:22 - expecting it to be so I hope that saves
06:25 - you guys some time in debugging your own
06:28 - apps and I'll see you guys next time
06:31 - you
