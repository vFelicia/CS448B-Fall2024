00:00 - hey code crew if you started your iOS
00:02 - Journey with me it was undoubtedly in
00:04 - building the war card game I've created
00:06 - seven iterations of this beginner series
00:08 - over the last 10 years improving it and
00:11 - updating it to keep Pace with Apple's
00:14 - framework and Swift changes now this
00:16 - eight lesson beginner series is designed
00:18 - to teach the fundamentals to people with
00:21 - no technical background while keeping a
00:23 - focus on building confidence and having
00:26 - fun and that's why it's been such a hit
00:28 - for everyone including students in
00:30 - classrooms if you went through these
00:32 - eight lessons already you've gained the
00:33 - following skills you've learned how apps
00:36 - go from code to App Store you've learned
00:38 - your way around xcode you've learned how
00:40 - to read and write Swift at a basic level
00:42 - and you've learned how to build the
00:44 - simple user interfaces but more
00:46 - importantly you've stopped doubting
00:48 - yourself about whether or not this is
00:50 - for you now I want to introduce you to
00:52 - what comes after this war card game the
00:55 - menu app this series continues from
00:57 - where the war card game left off and
00:59 - prepare prepares you for the next step
01:01 - in your iOS journey and Beyond now don't
01:03 - be fooled by this simple scrollable list
01:05 - this is something that you could learn
01:07 - from tons of tutorials out there but
01:09 - we're going to take it a step further
01:10 - not only will you learn the skills
01:12 - needed to build this app but we're going
01:14 - to modify the code afterwards to mimic
01:16 - that of a more complex app now let me
01:18 - explain many tutorials teach you how to
01:21 - build a simple single screen app and
01:23 - with good reason it's a great starting
01:25 - point and you need to learn to walk
01:27 - before you can Sprint the problem is
01:30 - that there's a conceptual leap from a
01:32 - single screen app with self-contained
01:34 - data to a multi-screen app that fetches
01:36 - data from a variety of external sources
01:39 - and not only is the code more
01:41 - complicated but you'll have to
01:42 - understand aspects of networking
01:44 - concurrency proper app architecture and
01:47 - coding for reusability just to name a
01:49 - few so in the second half of this menu
01:52 - app video series that's what we focus on
01:54 - explaining these Concepts in preparation
01:57 - for the next larger more complex app so
01:59 - that's all fine and good but when is
02:01 - this menu app video series going to be
02:03 - released and where can you watch it well
02:06 - I'm happy to announce that it is free to
02:08 - watch on the code with Chris learning
02:10 - platform the reason it's not currently
02:12 - on YouTube is because the menu app
02:14 - series is a step up from the war card
02:16 - game in terms of skill level so I wanted
02:18 - to enhance the learning experience with
02:20 - practical exercises quizzes and human
02:23 - support now these things are all
02:25 - available for free through the code with
02:27 - Chris learning platform now I want to be
02:29 - fully transparent aside from the quizzes
02:31 - the challenges and the human support
02:33 - that you're going to receive in our
02:35 - Forum you're also going to get a special
02:37 - offer to join CWC Plus where you can get
02:41 - access to all of our available courses
