00:00 - in this video you're going to learn how to use the 
Swift UI chart component which lets you turn data  
00:04 - like this into a beautiful chart like this you 
can use a variety of different chart formats too  
00:09 - and it only takes three steps Number One Import 
the charts framework number two declare a chart  
00:15 - component and then lastly Loop through your data 
set and display each data point using a chart type  
00:20 - of your choice now let's dive into xcode and try 
it out okay so here I've got an xcode project and  
00:26 - all I've done so far is set up an initial struct 
and some dummy data so let's take a look at this  
00:32 - struct it's called Sleep data point and it's 
got two properties one is day which is going  
00:37 - to contain a string Monday Tuesday and so on 
so forth and hours the number of hours slept on  
00:43 - that day now I chose this type of data and these 
two properties just to keep it simple because I  
00:47 - think we can all understand the concept of each 
day and sleep in the view I've got a property  
00:54 - called data which is an array of these instances 
and here I've just spaced it out so it's easy to  
01:00 - read so here you can see I've got from Monday to 
Sunday in a number of hours slept on that day so  
01:08 - in the view I've just got a text element 
let's start by importing the charts framework
01:16 - easy and then let's go into the view we're 
going to get rid of this and we're going to  
01:21 - create a chart component I'm going to open up 
a pair of curly brackets and in here we're just  
01:26 - going to Loop through this data array so let's 
use a for each we're going to pass in the data  
01:33 - and we are going to Loop it through it now for 
each instance inside that data we are going to  
01:42 - decide how we want to show that chart if you 
get an error like this make sure that your  
01:48 - structure conforms to identifiable because we're 
going to Loop through it let's give it an ID  
01:56 - so that it can differentiate between each 
data point all right so that's going to get  
02:02 - rid of that error now there are several options 
depending on what kind of chart you want to show  
02:06 - right now I'll just show you a simple bar chart 
so we're going to use something called a bar mark  
02:12 - here there are also several different initializers 
you can use I'm going to use this one X Y I'll  
02:18 - show you some documentation for what some of 
the other things are now this takes along the  
02:24 - x-axis a plausible value and then on the y-axis 
the vertical axis also a plottable value so you  
02:32 - have to decide based on your data what you want 
to go across the x-axis and the y-axis so for  
02:37 - us let's say we want the days plotted horizontally 
and the number of hours plotted vertically so what  
02:45 - you can do is you can say plottable value Dot and 
then you can create you can create a value using  
02:53 - this so it takes two parameters one is a label 
so let's call this the day and where does it get  
02:59 - its value the value is in the day property right 
so we're going to use this parameter d and we're  
03:05 - going to specify the day so that's going to go 
along the x-axis now if you don't want to type out  
03:10 - so much stuff you can simply hit Dot and choose 
value and let's along the y-axis let's go hours  
03:19 - and the data the actual data is in the hours 
property right so let's get rid of that let  
03:25 - me just space this out so it's a little easier to 
see all right so it looks something like that and  
03:31 - you get this chart just like that so each time it 
Loops through the data it is creating one of these  
03:38 - bar marks now keep in mind this also groups 
the data as well so let's say that for Monday  
03:45 - I had two data points like that and let's say 
I slept six hours on Monday and then another  
03:54 - two hours so you can see that it doesn't add 
another Monday to the x-axis it actually groups  
04:00 - it together and now this is eight you can see the 
scale goes up to 10 because uh Wednesday was 10.  
04:08 - now what we can do let me show you a couple 
of other things you can do so let's add some  
04:12 - padding first of all to make it look just a little 
bit nicer very quickly I want to say that if you  
04:18 - don't want a bar chart you can very easily change 
this bar Mark to a different type of chart marker  
04:23 - and many of them also accept an X and A Y as 
an initializer so very easily for example I can  
04:30 - change bar Mark to point mark you would have kind 
of like a scatter plot graph you can change it to  
04:37 - line Mark you need to get a line graph or perhaps 
you might want an area graph which is kind of like  
04:44 - a line graph just colored underneath and this part 
right here I think is due to our data right here  
04:52 - us having of two pieces of data on Monday I don't 
think it that plays very nicely with the area  
04:58 - chart all right there you go so if you want an 
area chart perhaps you you don't have that type of  
05:03 - data but if you look at the documentation you're 
going to see there are different types of markers  
05:08 - you can use rule Mark and rectangle marker to that 
we haven't looked at because I think those require  
05:14 - a little bit more configuration let's go back to 
Let's undo so I have that data point again let's  
05:21 - go back to the bar chart because I'm going to 
show you a couple of customizations that you can  
05:26 - do to it for example if you want to add a label 
to it you can add what's called an annotation  
05:34 - okay so we are going to add a text element and we 
are going to specify let's say the number of hours  
05:45 - right as a text element and by default 
it positions it on top right there but  
05:51 - notice however on Monday right since we have two 
segments six and two it's only showing the two  
05:59 - and the reason is because that two segment is on 
top of the six segment and that little chunk is  
06:08 - probably covering the sixth label and it's only 
showing the two labels so if you wanted a total  
06:13 - for Monday you would probably have to do some 
calculations here because by passing in D we are  
06:20 - only getting like one sliver or one instance of 
that sleep data you're going to have to calculate  
06:27 - um probably grab all of the Mondays in 
that data set and add it together to  
06:32 - show that total what we can try to do instead is 
actually change the position of this annotation
06:40 - so there are several parameters let's use 
overlay and what that does is actually put  
06:46 - the number on the segment itself so now you can 
see that this segment is 6 and that is two but  
06:51 - there is no color differentiation so it's kind 
of hard to see right because Monday actually  
06:56 - has two segments in it so if we wanted to draw a 
distinction between the two segments we need to  
07:03 - distinguish them in the data so let's add another 
dimension to our data right now we only have two  
07:09 - Dimensions day and hours right so let's add a 
third dimension and call it type so this one is  
07:16 - a string let's call it the type of sleep it is so 
nighttime sleep or nap perhaps or something else  
07:23 - so by default it's going to be night and let's 
say for this data point this was actually a nap  
07:32 - okay and then in here now you can color the 
segments depending on the type let's add  
07:38 - another modifier to the bar Mark notice that I'm 
adding these modifiers to the bar Mark and not  
07:45 - the chart so let's say that we want to color 
the foreground style and we want to color it  
07:52 - by a certain dimension of the data so again 
it's plottable value we're going to hit dot  
07:58 - value and the label we're going to use type 
and type is specified by our type property  
08:09 - all right so now you can see that it's a 
different segment Let's uh let's change  
08:16 - the foreground color to white and there we 
go you can see actually a legend has also  
08:22 - appeared down here now that there are several 
colors let's add one more to Monday let's say  
08:30 - uh or let's say Friday let's say Friday I had one 
hour of sleep so I needed to take first of all uh  
08:42 - a nap as well as let's say I accidentally fell 
asleep has that ever happened to you where you're  
08:51 - so tired you just fall asleep when you didn't 
intend to so now we have three different data  
08:57 - types right and the legend updates by itself 
as well now there's a lot of customizations  
09:01 - that you can do to charts so far we've been adding 
these modifiers to the Mark or the segment itself  
09:08 - but there are also modifiers that you can 
apply to the Chart components so for example  
09:14 - if you just type in chart autocomplete will show 
you all of these different things that you can do  
09:19 - so for example if we do scale range and this one 
you can add some padding to the top and the bottom
09:30 - and you can see how there's padding at the 
top and padding at the bottom now so today  
09:34 - we've gone through some Basics about 
how to add a swift UI chart to your app  
09:38 - you might have noticed that there's no pie 
chart option well good news in iOS 17 it  
09:43 - will include pie charts and donut charts 
and we're going to cover that next week  
09:47 - in the meantime however if you're new to 
IOS app development definitely check out  
09:51 - our three hour masterclass on Swift UI 
where you're going to build your first  
09:55 - app no experience required alright thanks 
for watching I'll see you in the next video
