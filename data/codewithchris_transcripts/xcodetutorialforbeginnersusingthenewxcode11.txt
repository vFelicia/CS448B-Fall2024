00:00 - tako crew in this video you're going to
00:02 - get a practical and working knowledge of
00:04 - how to use Xcode specifically you're
00:06 - going to learn how to navigate and move
00:08 - around all of X codes various sections
00:10 - and menus I'm going to also touch upon
00:11 - how to write code in Xcode how to build
00:14 - your user interface using storyboards or
00:16 - swift UI how to debug and test your app
00:18 - and I'm going to touch upon how to
00:20 - distribute and submit your app to the
00:23 - App Store as well and what that process
00:24 - looks like and then I'm going to give
00:26 - you links into each of those topics to
00:28 - learn and dive deeper by the end of this
00:31 - Xcode tutorial my goal for you is to
00:33 - have a working knowledge of how to start
00:35 - using Xcode to start building apps if
00:37 - that sounds good to you then stay tuned
00:44 - hey there my name is Chris and if this
00:46 - is your first time here welcome to code
00:48 - with Chris where we teach beginners how
00:50 - to build apps even if they've never
00:51 - written a single line of code before we
00:54 - dive in I've got a question for you why
00:56 - are you trying to build an app let me
00:57 - know by leaving a quick comment below
00:59 - and on your way down there and make sure
01:01 - you hit the like button and subscribe if
01:03 - you haven't already I really appreciate
01:05 - that alright let's get started alright
01:08 - so you've downloaded Xcode it's finally
01:11 - installed you launch it you're ready to
01:13 - go you start a new project and then you
01:15 - realize you don't know what you're
01:16 - looking at because it's so confusing it
01:19 - is a lot to take in
01:20 - however this Xcode tutorial is going to
01:22 - cut through the confusion and it's going
01:25 - to show you how to navigate around Xcode
01:26 - how to write your code and how to build
01:28 - your user interfaces now it is targeted
01:32 - towards beginners to Xcode so if you
01:34 - know your way around you might find some
01:37 - tips and tricks throughout this video
01:38 - but by and large this tutorial is meant
01:41 - for someone who is new tax code all
01:44 - right so let's close out this project
01:45 - and let's start a brand new one because
01:48 - we're gonna start from step one alright
01:50 - so the shortcut to launch a new project
01:52 - is command shift and end so you can go
01:54 - ahead and just hit that on your keyboard
01:57 - or you can go to file new a new project
02:01 - or you might have a welcome screen in
02:03 - which case you can choose start a new
02:06 - Xcode project now don't start a new
02:08 - playground and a playground has its own
02:11 - purpose
02:11 - which is to play around with some code
02:14 - do some experiments experiment with some
02:17 - user interface work but if you're gonna
02:20 - build a full-fledged application then
02:22 - you want to start a new project and
02:25 - we're not just talking about iOS
02:27 - projects here if you look across the top
02:29 - you can build on multiple platforms
02:31 - right now on this channel we're talking
02:33 - about iOS apps and so we're going to be
02:35 - looking under the iOS tab now these are
02:38 - all different templates that you can
02:40 - start some of them will get you started
02:42 - in the right direction for building apps
02:45 - you probably want to start with a single
02:47 - view app or a tabbed app now if you
02:50 - start with a single view app it doesn't
02:52 - mean that you can add tabs to your app
02:54 - it just means that you're gonna have to
02:57 - add it yourself if you know you want to
02:58 - build a tab bar based app you could
03:01 - start with this I still recommend
03:02 - however for complete beginners to start
03:04 - with a single view out because that's
03:06 - the cleanest way if you start with a
03:08 - tabbed app you're gonna have a lot of
03:09 - extras which might actually add to the
03:12 - confusion so we're gonna start with a
03:14 - single view app let's click on next
03:17 - right here and we get to the project
03:19 - properties screen here you're going to
03:21 - configure some basic details about your
03:24 - project first off being what is the name
03:27 - of your app so you can put that there if
03:29 - you're brand new chances are you won't
03:31 - have a team and that's completely fine
03:32 - you can leave it as none if you do have
03:34 - one you can go ahead and add it there
03:37 - and a development team is just something
03:39 - that you're going to have to create once
03:42 - you want to deploy your app onto an
03:44 - actual device or send it to the app
03:46 - store or something like that
03:47 - next thing you want to configure is your
03:50 - organization name now organization is
03:52 - just a fancy name for your business name
03:55 - or maybe your personal name and on the
03:57 - next line the organization identifier is
03:59 - basically a way to identify your entity
04:03 - whether that's business or personal
04:05 - usually it follows the sort of format
04:07 - where you have com dot and then your
04:09 - business name or your personal name and
04:12 - that combined with your product name is
04:14 - going to form your bundle identifier
04:16 - which is going to be a unique ID to
04:19 - identify your app the next two are very
04:21 - important language you can choose from
04:24 - Swift or object
04:25 - see if you don't know what to choose
04:27 - choose swift that's kind of the standard
04:29 - right now it used to be our objective C
04:31 - and then Apple introduced Swift as a
04:34 - brand-new programming language and so
04:37 - that was you know years ago and
04:39 - everyone's migrated to using Swift same
04:43 - thing happened with the user interface
04:44 - it used to be only storyboards and then
04:47 - most recently Apple introduced Swift UI
04:50 - which is a new way of building user
04:52 - interfaces without getting into the
04:54 - technical details about what makes them
04:57 - different I'm just going to say that
05:00 - Swift UI is just released so it's very
05:03 - much in its infancy and learning so if
05:05 - UI is a great investment towards your
05:08 - future but if you want to let's say find
05:11 - a job in the near future like your focus
05:13 - is to become a freelancer or maybe to
05:15 - find a job fairly quickly then you're
05:17 - going to want to choose storyboards and
05:19 - learn how to use that instead because a
05:22 - lot of companies haven't invested the
05:25 - time and resources into using Swift UI
05:27 - just yet so I would say if you're just
05:30 - starting out you at this point in time
05:32 - you still want to learn how to use
05:34 - storyboards now this really should say
05:38 - UI kit which is the user interface
05:40 - framework because storyboards is a
05:44 - visual way for you to build your user
05:46 - interface by dragging and dropping
05:48 - things through this interface builder
05:50 - which I'm going to show you but you can
05:53 - also build it through code right and so
05:56 - storyboards is kind of a weird name for
05:58 - it but however just know that Swift UI
06:01 - is the new thing that Apple has
06:03 - introduced and storyboards with you
06:06 - choosing this option has been the
06:08 - existing and current way to do things
06:11 - over the next three four years everyone
06:13 - will probably be migrating to using
06:15 - Swift UI all right so that's what we're
06:18 - gonna choose there storyboards now the
06:20 - next couple of options if you're just
06:23 - starting out probably isn't something
06:24 - that you're going to want to enable this
06:27 - last two for unit testing and UI tests
06:30 - are ways for you to run some automated
06:32 - testing on your application which is
06:34 - very useful when your app gets really
06:36 - large lots of code
06:38 - you know lots of pieces of UI and you
06:41 - want to you want to be able to
06:43 - automatically run tests and scripts to
06:46 - test them without having to manually
06:48 - test things every time you make a change
06:50 - core data it's not technically a
06:52 - database but it's a way for you just
06:55 - think of it as a way for you to store
06:56 - local data on your device now it's
06:59 - something that isn't for beginners I'm
07:02 - just gonna say that but it is something
07:04 - that is useful to have once you get past
07:06 - the the basics of building apps and you
07:10 - want to look into how you can persist
07:11 - data locally on your device through app
07:15 - sessions alright so think of it as a
07:17 - local database although when you read
07:19 - all of the documentation from Apple that
07:21 - it's not technically a database it's a
07:24 - way of organizing information all right
07:26 - so we are going to fill out a product
07:28 - name I'm just gonna call this sample
07:29 - look we've taught so much and we haven't
07:31 - even gone into Xcode just yet but it's
07:35 - important that you know what all that
07:37 - stuff means
07:38 - now we're gonna save it save it
07:40 - somewhere where you're gonna remember
07:42 - where it is
07:43 - and source control here this is probably
07:46 - something that you don't need as well
07:48 - right now basically if you don't know
07:50 - what source control is it's a way for
07:52 - you to manage your source code and
07:53 - manage changes to the source code
07:55 - especially helpful for teams working
07:58 - together but also helpful for personal
08:03 - projects because if you let's say make a
08:05 - change and you delete some code or maybe
08:07 - you broke your code source control will
08:09 - allow you to roll back to a previous
08:12 - change in something like that however
08:15 - we're not going to enable it right now
08:16 - that in itself will take another
08:19 - tutorial in this one we're going to
08:21 - focus on going through Xcode so let's
08:24 - click create now source control is is
08:27 - kind of independent from Xcode it's its
08:30 - own system but it can be integrated into
08:33 - Xcode I know that's really confusing for
08:36 - a beginner just just ignore the source
08:38 - control part and you can find some other
08:41 - videos on so what source control is and
08:43 - how you can integrate it to use with
08:46 - Xcode alright so you've got your brand
08:49 - new project here there's a lot of button
08:52 - and text everywhere it looks really
08:54 - confusing so let me break it down
08:55 - there's only really five major areas of
08:58 - the Xcode user interface hard to believe
09:00 - because it looks like there's panels
09:02 - everywhere so starting on the left hand
09:04 - side you have the Navigator area and
09:07 - this navigator area actually has a bunch
09:09 - of different tabs you see all of these
09:11 - icons right here those are all different
09:14 - types of Navigator by default it's gonna
09:17 - be on this first one this is the file
09:19 - navigator and it shows you all of the
09:21 - files in your Xcode project now there
09:25 - are different ones here you can navigate
09:27 - issues or you know search results or
09:29 - things like that but we will get into
09:31 - that a little later next up on the right
09:35 - of the file navigator we have the editor
09:37 - area and it's this whole dark part right
09:40 - here this editor area is for editing the
09:43 - file or the thing that you select from
09:46 - the Navigator area so whether you're
09:48 - selecting a file or maybe you're
09:50 - selecting an issue or something like
09:52 - that
09:52 - whatever you select is going to show up
09:55 - in the editor area for you to edit or
09:58 - configure all right and to the right of
10:02 - the editor area is called the inspector
10:04 - area now the inspector area also has a
10:07 - couple of different tabs and these tabs
10:08 - kind of change depending on what you
10:12 - have selected in the editor area because
10:15 - what this inspector area is for is for
10:19 - you to configure or get additional
10:22 - information on inspect whatever you
10:25 - select in the editor area so you can
10:27 - think of it as a drill down so the top
10:30 - level is this file navigator you know
10:33 - you're selecting the main thing you want
10:35 - to look at then it moves to the editor
10:38 - area where you're editing what you
10:40 - selected a navigator and then whatever
10:43 - you select in the editor area it's going
10:45 - to show you some options or additional
10:47 - info in this rightmost inspector area so
10:52 - that's kind of how it moves across in
10:55 - those three different big areas now
10:57 - across the top you'll have the toolbar
10:59 - the toolbar has some pretty critical
11:02 - buttons and information which we will
11:04 - get into but
11:06 - that allows you to control your project
11:08 - so you can do things like build and run
11:11 - your project you can choose where to run
11:14 - it you can see the status of what's
11:16 - happening behind the scenes what Xcode
11:18 - is working on or crunching and then on
11:21 - the right hand side there are some
11:22 - navigational buttons which we will go
11:25 - into now where's this fit area because
11:27 - we've only gone through four well the
11:29 - fifth area is actually hidden by default
11:31 - and clicking this button is going to
11:35 - hide that hide or show that fifth area
11:38 - so you can see like that this area is
11:42 - called the console or debug area or
11:44 - might be called the debug console a lot
11:47 - of people use different names I call it
11:49 - personally the debug area now the bug if
11:52 - you're unfamiliar with that term you're
11:53 - brand new to programming debugging is
11:55 - the process of just working out all of
11:57 - the kinks and all of the weird behavior
12:00 - in your app because those are known as
12:02 - bugs so debugging is just to remove all
12:07 - of those errors and kinks in your app so
12:10 - this debug area helps you to do that
12:13 - by letting you inspect your code showing
12:16 - you diagnostics and information as your
12:19 - app is running so that you can get a
12:21 - handle on what's happening as your app
12:23 - is running so the process of debugging
12:26 - your app is another sort of skill that
12:29 - you need to learn but first you know
12:31 - we're not going to focus on that we're
12:33 - gonna focus on writing code and building
12:35 - user interfaces because those are kind
12:37 - of the two basic things that you need to
12:39 - know you need to walk before you can run
12:41 - right so now that we've gone through the
12:43 - five major areas I'm gonna do a little
12:46 - bit of a deep dive into each of the
12:48 - areas to show you how you actually use
12:49 - them actually one thing before we dive
12:52 - into the separate areas if you want this
12:55 - sort of dark theme and you don't have it
12:57 - well it's gonna require you to go into
13:00 - the Xcode preferences and other under
13:04 - fonts and colors you can choose a dark
13:06 - you know a dark theme but if you want
13:09 - the chrome of your Xcode to also be dark
13:11 - then you're gonna have to go into your
13:12 - preferences your system preferences and
13:15 - I don't
13:18 - don't remember exactly where it is but
13:22 - there is a parent's light darken Auto so
13:26 - you can do start so this combined with
13:29 - inside your Xcode preferences choosing a
13:32 - dark theme will give you this ultra dark
13:35 - mode so you can look really cool no but
13:37 - actually it's actually better on your
13:38 - eyes in low-light conditions so that's
13:40 - why a lot of people use this presumably
13:43 - because they code at night alright so
13:46 - now let's dive into the file navigator
13:48 - area I'm going to go through some of the
13:50 - default files that comes with your brand
13:52 - new project and explain what some of
13:55 - them do so that you can get an
13:57 - understanding now that app delegate and
14:00 - the scene delegate are two files which
14:02 - kind of act like starting points for
14:05 - your app this is when your app is
14:06 - launching and things are happening under
14:09 - the hood there are methods in here gives
14:12 - you an opportunity to run some code but
14:16 - this is by and large when your app is
14:18 - starting up or spinning down maybe the
14:21 - user switching apps or something like
14:23 - that so you get an opportunity to do
14:25 - stuff in the beginning and at the end of
14:27 - your app's life cycle that's what it's
14:28 - called the view controller is that place
14:32 - that controls the logic for the first
14:35 - screen of your app because by default
14:37 - when you start a new project you're
14:38 - going to get a single screen and a
14:40 - single view controller and the view
14:41 - controller is where you're going to
14:43 - write the logic and the code for that
14:46 - first screen now this main dot
14:49 - storyboard file you'll only have if you
14:51 - chose storyboards as your user interface
14:53 - option in those in the new project
14:56 - properties so if you are following along
14:59 - and chose storyboards like I did you're
15:01 - going to get this main dot storyboard
15:02 - file and as you can see the editor area
15:05 - actually changes depending on what I
15:07 - chose so if you're choosing these dots
15:10 - Swift files these are code files you're
15:13 - going to see code so because you can
15:15 - edit that and similarly in the inspector
15:19 - area because you are clicking and
15:21 - inspecting code you're going to see
15:23 - options like where that file exists and
15:25 - also some documentation depending on
15:28 - certain keywords it tells you what that
15:30 - keyword means if you choose the
15:33 - storyboard file this is interface
15:35 - builder like I was telling you before
15:37 - and this interface builder is for you to
15:41 - edit and configure your user interface
15:44 - in a visual manner so for example let me
15:48 - just give you a quick example clicking
15:49 - that plus icon opens up what's called an
15:51 - object library where you can see all of
15:53 - these different controls and elements
15:55 - and you can literally just drag and drop
15:58 - it into your view and then you can
16:00 - specify different rules and conditions
16:02 - called constraints the size and position
16:05 - all of those different elements and
16:07 - that's how you build your user interface
16:09 - using storyboards and because this
16:11 - editor area right now is visual when you
16:15 - select this visual element your
16:18 - inspector area also shows you things
16:21 - that you can do with that visual element
16:23 - so here you can configure all of these
16:24 - different options and properties
16:27 - specific to that switch that I just
16:30 - selected that's different from back here
16:32 - right when I selected a code keyword you
16:35 - don't get any of those options instead
16:36 - you get documentation on what that
16:39 - keyword is so it's all contextual right
16:42 - the editor area is contextual to what
16:45 - you selected here in the navigator and
16:47 - the inspector is contextual towards what
16:50 - you select inside the editor okay let's
16:53 - move on you'll notice that you have
16:56 - another storyboard file this one's
16:58 - called launch screen not to be confused
17:00 - with the main dot storyboard this launch
17:03 - screen storyboard specifies the launch
17:06 - screen for your app so when your app
17:08 - boots up there's a very brief time where
17:11 - this is shown and this is where you can
17:14 - configure how that looks like this is
17:17 - your asset catalog or asset library this
17:20 - is where you would add your app icon you
17:22 - would add any image graphics you'd have
17:25 - you literally just drag it into this
17:26 - catalog and then inside here where
17:29 - you're configuring your user interface
17:31 - and even in code files you'll be able to
17:34 - access and reference the images that
17:37 - you've added to your project here you
17:40 - also have something called an info.plist
17:42 - which give
17:44 - you actually a lot of these things you
17:47 - configured when you started the project
17:49 - this plist is short for property lists
17:53 - and it's kind of just different
17:54 - configuration values for your project
17:56 - now I'm going to quickly switch over to
17:58 - a new project and just briefly show you
18:00 - what your file list would look like had
18:03 - you selected Swift UI for the user
18:06 - interface instead of storyboards alright
18:10 - so you can see here this is a project
18:12 - but I chose swift UI for the user
18:15 - interface so we still have app delegate
18:18 - and scene delegate that doesn't change
18:20 - those are providing opportunities for
18:22 - you to interact with the different
18:25 - lifecycle events of your app such as
18:27 - when it starts and stops the content
18:29 - view is something that is new this kind
18:32 - of replaces that storyboard that you saw
18:34 - right and you still have your launch
18:36 - screen storyboard the content view
18:40 - actually describes that first screen of
18:43 - your app as you can see here when you
18:45 - click on this it still gives you a code
18:47 - file because Swift UI is all about
18:49 - declaring your user interface via
18:52 - writing code the editor area is actually
18:56 - split into two different panes here this
18:59 - is where you would specify the code for
19:01 - your user interface and over here is a
19:04 - preview canvas so if I just click resume
19:08 - right there it's actually going to show
19:10 - you a preview of what your user
19:13 - interface will look like based on the
19:14 - code that you have written here now in
19:16 - the storyboard project I showed you how
19:18 - you can open up the object library and
19:21 - you can drag and drop different elements
19:23 - into your storyboard you can also do
19:25 - that here so you can click this and you
19:29 - can open up for example this one right
19:36 - so I can add a button but I wouldn't
19:39 - drag it to my view here I would drag it
19:41 - into the code area because everything's
19:45 - using code right so I could for example
19:47 - if I wanted to put a button below my
19:50 - label right there
19:52 - I would there's an error here because
19:54 - that's kind of an illegal layout
19:58 - so I'm gonna add what's called a
20:00 - vertical stack and a vertical stack
20:02 - element basically puts two different
20:06 - elements or two or more elements on top
20:08 - of each other so by adding my text and
20:11 - my button inside this V stack now I get
20:14 - this sort of layout you can also
20:17 - customize your layout by interacting
20:21 - directly with the preview canvas right
20:23 - here for example the inspector right
20:26 - here shows me some things that I can
20:28 - configure but you can also hold down
20:30 - command on your keyboard and you can
20:32 - click these elements and you can do
20:35 - different things with them here so this
20:38 - is what Swift UI is all about not gonna
20:40 - dive into how to build apps with Swift
20:43 - UI right now but I just wanted to give
20:46 - you a taste of what building your user
20:48 - interface would be like using either
20:50 - storyboards or Swift UI let's continue
20:52 - with the Xcode walkthrough using our
20:55 - other project alright so we discussed
21:00 - the file navigator we went through cut
21:02 - some of the different files let's go
21:04 - through some of the different navigators
21:06 - here another one you might be using if
21:09 - your project gets long is the search
21:11 - navigator so this one would show you
21:13 - search results because what you can do
21:15 - is you can hold the command F to do a
21:18 - search and let's say you were searching
21:20 - for the term UIKit and what I'm typing
21:23 - here changes up here right you hit enter
21:26 - it's gonna show you all the locations in
21:28 - your project that contains that word so
21:30 - that is the search navigator right there
21:33 - or if you're running your project and
21:36 - let's say there are errors in your
21:38 - project so I'm gonna intentionally make
21:40 - an error right here there is an issues
21:44 - navigator right here which will show you
21:46 - all of the errors and when you click on
21:48 - the error it will jump you to where the
21:50 - problem is so those probably are the
21:54 - main navigators that you're going to use
21:57 - there are a couple of other ones like
21:58 - source control if you're using that this
22:00 - one is for your breakpoints when you're
22:02 - debugging your app which I alluded to
22:05 - earlier on this video but I think by and
22:08 - large the big ones you'll be using are
22:10 - the file navigator
22:11 - search navigator and the issues
22:13 - navigator next up let's talk about the
22:16 - editor area now there are some special
22:19 - abilities or special features of the
22:22 - editor area which make it easier to
22:24 - write code and build your us with so I'm
22:26 - gonna highlight some of those that might
22:29 - not immediately be obvious so if you're
22:32 - using version 11 of Xcode you're gonna
22:34 - notice this little button here which
22:36 - will basically add additional editor
22:40 - panes to your to your editor area this
22:44 - effectively splits it into multiple
22:46 - editors and this is useful if you've got
22:49 - a really large monitor and maybe you
22:51 - want to compare two files or something
22:52 - like that so there we go you can also
22:55 - add one not beside but you could add one
22:58 - below as well if you hold down option
23:00 - you can see that icon change right to
23:03 - point the pluses is below right now
23:06 - instead of on the right so when I click
23:08 - this it adds an editor below the current
23:10 - one and you can just close off these
23:12 - ones if you don't need them now what
23:15 - happens when you select a file well it
23:18 - just shows you shows you that file in
23:20 - your editor area but what if you wanted
23:22 - to choose which editor pane you want it
23:25 - to open your new file with well that's
23:27 - easy you can hold them option and shift
23:29 - on your keyboard while selecting a new
23:31 - file so let me select the storyboard and
23:34 - then you're gonna have this indicator
23:36 - that lets you choose which editor pane
23:39 - to launch your file in so I'm gonna
23:42 - choose that one
23:42 - alright so now let me close out this
23:44 - additional editor pane because I want to
23:47 - show you this next button here called
23:48 - editor options now this menu shows you
23:51 - some additional things that you can do
23:53 - with your editor area so for example
23:56 - let's go through from the bottom up
23:59 - Invisibles shows you all of the spaces
24:02 - and carriage returns things that you
24:04 - can't see you've also got code coverage
24:07 - now this is mostly for testing it shows
24:10 - you how well your code is covered by the
24:15 - testing the automated tests that I
24:17 - mentioned earlier when you created your
24:18 - project if you're not doing unit tests
24:20 - this might not apply authors gives you a
24:23 - history of
24:25 - whose modified the file and this
24:27 - pertains to having your project under
24:29 - source control because remember I told
24:31 - you source control was really useful for
24:33 - team members working together so if you
24:35 - did have that sort of set up you would
24:38 - able you would be able to see all of
24:39 - your team members and what they changed
24:42 - and when they changed it and that sort
24:43 - of information under this panel so I'm
24:46 - just gonna disable those because they
24:48 - don't really apply to us
24:49 - there's mini-map one let me just close
24:52 - that one to the mini-map one is useful
24:54 - it shows you a high-level outline of
24:56 - your code and also lets you jump to
24:59 - various parts of your code and while
25:02 - we're on the topic of talking about
25:05 - navigating around in your code another
25:07 - very useful way to do that is this bar
25:10 - up here this is the sort of breadcrumb
25:12 - that tells you exactly where your file
25:14 - is located within your project so you
25:17 - can see this is the project this is the
25:19 - folder or group that your file is in
25:22 - this is the file you're looking at and
25:23 - this is the the section or maybe I'll
25:27 - use the appropriate terms this is the
25:29 - class or method that you're looking at
25:32 - so when you pop that open you're going
25:34 - to see different sections of your code
25:38 - or different methods that you can just
25:39 - immediately jump to so when you're
25:41 - working around in your project writing
25:44 - code this is very very useful and then
25:47 - you can switch files very easily just by
25:48 - clicking any section of the breadcrumb
25:51 - and choosing a different file now also
25:54 - these arrows right here I use often as
25:57 - well clicking back will actually show
25:59 - you the thing or the file that you were
26:02 - previously looking at as you can see
26:04 - actually the previous thing that I jump
26:07 - to within the same file even so these
26:09 - are also very useful now going back to
26:12 - the editor options up here there are a
26:14 - couple of other views that you can add
26:18 - to your editor for example the canvas
26:21 - now I don't have this actually let's
26:24 - bring up our swift UI project because
26:26 - this makes sense in this context you can
26:29 - see here the canvas is this preview
26:32 - canvas if I turn that off then I'm only
26:34 - looking at the code so you turning the
26:36 - canvas on shows me that
26:39 - now in a storyboards project that
26:42 - doesn't really make sense so as you can
26:45 - see when I turn this on or off nothing
26:47 - really happens now the assistant looks
26:51 - like a different pain but what the
26:54 - assistant editor or assistant pain does
26:57 - is it shows you the complementary file
27:00 - to the file that you're looking at so
27:02 - most often it's used in the context of
27:05 - the storyboard so what I'm looking at
27:06 - this storyboard right here and this
27:08 - represents my main view well there's a
27:12 - view controller that represents or or
27:15 - powers that view and if I go and select
27:20 - the assistant here I will see the code
27:23 - file corresponding to my view right here
27:27 - so then I can work in tandem and connect
27:31 - these elements to my view controller so
27:34 - that I can manipulate them through code
27:35 - so that's what the assistant editor is
27:38 - and let me just close out that pane and
27:43 - here under layout it's just letting you
27:47 - shift the position of that editor pane
27:49 - if you've got multiple editors oh and
27:52 - before I forget oftentimes people asks
27:55 - me why I have line numbers and how they
27:57 - can get it as well they're very useful
27:58 - especially when I'm trying to teach
28:00 - something so those are just in Xcode
28:03 - preferences under text editing you can
28:05 - turn on line numbers like that alright
28:08 - next up let's talk about the inspector
28:10 - so we have kind of talked about it
28:13 - already but let me just explain a couple
28:16 - more things in detail so I think the
28:20 - inspector is very useful for determining
28:22 - where a file is for example on your file
28:25 - system you can come here into this and
28:28 - you can see the full path for your file
28:30 - you can also see the target membership
28:33 - now the target is your app and when you
28:36 - uncheck this that's going to mean that
28:39 - the file is not going to be included in
28:41 - your app the reason why this is here is
28:43 - because an Xcode project can actually
28:45 - have multiple targets so you can build
28:48 - multiple different outputs within the
28:50 - same Xcode project
28:52 - and this target membership area
28:55 - describes which targets this file should
28:59 - be included in so oftentimes when some
29:03 - beginners they've added the resources
29:06 - maybe the sound files or images into
29:08 - their project but they can't get them to
29:09 - show up or or they can't hear the sound
29:12 - oftentimes it's because under target
29:15 - membership here this is unchecked and
29:17 - that file that resource isn't actually
29:19 - being included inside that target
29:22 - alright another useful thing that I use
29:26 - a lot is in here this quick help if you
29:31 - are putting your cursor in a class or
29:36 - maybe it's a method this gives you some
29:39 - quick information about what it does
29:41 - sometimes you're using some sort of
29:44 - method or class here that you're not
29:45 - very familiar with the quick help right
29:48 - here can give you some pointers as to
29:51 - how to use it you can open up the full
29:55 - documentation for that and this can be
29:57 - helpful to do that as well because there
30:00 - is a link down here that allows you when
30:03 - you click it to open up this browsable
30:05 - and searchable documentation and it will
30:09 - just zoom you to exactly what you need
30:13 - and what your cursor was on and you can
30:15 - read up the details on that in addition
30:18 - to it showing up on here this inspector
30:21 - pane you can also hold down option and
30:24 - you can highlight under a certain
30:27 - keyword you can click it and it will
30:29 - also open up a summary like that and
30:31 - give you a documentation link that again
30:35 - leads to this documentation window and
30:40 - if you just want to open up this guy
30:42 - right here to take a look and browse
30:44 - around you can go to window and that's
30:46 - where that is right there oh and there's
30:49 - also a welcome to Xcode that's where
30:51 - that screen is all right now I mentioned
30:54 - the inspector panel will change
30:56 - depending on what you've got in the
30:58 - editor area so if we were looking at a
31:01 - storyboard file and I click on the
31:05 - the visual element you'll notice that
31:07 - there are additional tabs in the
31:09 - inspector so this one here this
31:13 - attributes inspector will let me
31:15 - configure that that element and there's
31:18 - also something called a size inspector
31:19 - where has everything related to do with
31:23 - sizing and constraints for that element
31:27 - which is how it gets positioned and
31:29 - sized as well so that's what the size
31:31 - inspector is and in our swift UI project
31:36 - when I selected something in here you
31:40 - can see the inspector pane I can also
31:42 - configure some properties for that
31:44 - element that I have selected next up
31:48 - let's talk about the toolbar across the
31:50 - top so I'm going to minimize this swift
31:52 - UI project now you've seen me run the
31:55 - project I believe by clicking this
31:57 - button here this is build and run your
31:59 - project this is to stop it and this is
32:02 - the target you want to run by default
32:05 - you're probably only gonna have one
32:07 - target unless you start adding multiple
32:10 - things to your project this is where to
32:13 - run your target on Xcode has a bunch of
32:16 - different simulators which are great for
32:18 - testing your app it's like having a
32:20 - virtual device on your screen where you
32:23 - can see your app running if you would
32:25 - have an actual device you can also plug
32:27 - it in to your laptop or a Mac or
32:29 - whatever and after going through a
32:32 - couple of dialogues to trust the device
32:35 - and to agree to use it for development
32:37 - you're going to see it show up up here
32:40 - and then you're going to be able to
32:41 - select that device and then run your app
32:44 - on a physical device which is really
32:46 - really cool to show off to your friends
32:48 - and family the simulator is plenty
32:51 - powerful though so if you don't have a
32:53 - device don't let that discourage you
32:55 - from starting iOS app development so
32:58 - that's what that is there I should also
33:01 - tell you that if you hold down click and
33:03 - you hold there are additional options
33:07 - for test profile and analyze these are
33:10 - different ways of either testing your
33:11 - app or monitoring its performance and
33:15 - diagnosing performance issues within
33:17 - stuff
33:18 - like that the status bar will show you
33:20 - the current state of the project or what
33:23 - is currently happening behind the scenes
33:25 - so when I hit this Run button you're
33:27 - gonna see you know a progress bar and
33:29 - and what Xcode is doing it's launching
33:31 - you know this thing in the simulator so
33:34 - this is actually what the simulator
33:35 - looks like and we'll dive into the
33:39 - simulator a little a little later
33:41 - because I want to go through the rest of
33:42 - the areas first so it's and for the
33:46 - first time the simulator is launched it
33:49 - does take a little while for it to boot
33:51 - up but subsequent times for running and
33:54 - launching your app is gonna be really
33:56 - quick it's kind of like starting up your
33:58 - phone when you power it down and you
34:00 - start up it does take a little while we
34:03 - have some buttons right here so this guy
34:05 - this object library you saw before you
34:08 - saw me open this up it has different if
34:11 - you're looking at a UI type of file
34:13 - you'll see elements that you can add if
34:16 - you're looking at a code file like this
34:19 - and you click this there are different
34:20 - snippets and sort of different syntax
34:23 - with syntax type of stuff that you can
34:26 - add into your code file by dragging and
34:29 - dropping now this button up here to
34:32 - compare different versions is useful for
34:34 - when you're working with source control
34:36 - and you want to look at maybe the
34:37 - current version of the file versus two
34:39 - versions back and you can see you want
34:41 - to compare how the code has changed
34:43 - that's what this button will help you do
34:44 - and then these buttons back here are
34:46 - just the hide and show various parts
34:48 - this is to hide and show the Navigator
34:51 - this is the for the debug area and this
34:54 - is for the inspector pane so that's
34:56 - pending on you know how much space you
34:58 - have on your desktop or your screen I
35:00 - mean all right now let's talk about the
35:03 - debug area since I ran the simulator you
35:05 - already see some output here now this
35:09 - might not make too much sense to you but
35:11 - however you can control what gets put
35:14 - out here so for example in your code
35:17 - right here you want to log some sort of
35:20 - output onto the console area this is you
35:23 - know the console area you can write
35:24 - print and then you can you can type
35:27 - something maybe you want to log some
35:30 - diagnostic
35:31 - information you can do that and it gets
35:33 - output here now do notice that this
35:36 - debug area is also split into two
35:38 - separate panes you've got you know that
35:41 - one right there and that one right there
35:43 - so let's go into a code file and if I
35:46 - run it you'll actually be able to see
35:48 - some more stuff so let me just run the
35:51 - project and you can see that output
35:52 - right there but had I done something
35:57 - like this this is called setting a
36:01 - breakpoint a breakpoint will actually
36:02 - pause the execution of the app at that
36:05 - line of code which will help you stop
36:09 - you're basically telling the execution
36:11 - of that stop I want to see what's going
36:14 - on right down in there and so you see
36:17 - this Green Line it stopped right there
36:18 - and you can peek into you know what's in
36:21 - memory you can take a look at different
36:24 - variables and different things by typing
36:27 - in commands here I've got a whole
36:29 - tutorial on how to debug your app and
36:32 - different techniques that you can use I
36:33 - will link to it down below in the
36:36 - description also I'll pop it up as a
36:38 - card right here on the upper right hand
36:41 - corner of the screen um then you can
36:43 - have more details into how to debug your
36:46 - app but I am NOT going to dive into that
36:49 - right now because that's a whole other
36:50 - topic in itself if you accidentally add
36:54 - these sort of blue markings these
36:56 - breakpoints you can just drag to get rid
36:59 - of them or you can click it to disable
37:01 - it either or all right and in the debug
37:04 - area if you've actually stopped and
37:07 - paused the execution there you can use
37:09 - these little buttons to control the flow
37:14 - the execution so you can kind of move
37:17 - the execution line by line so you can
37:19 - slowly see what's happening as your app
37:22 - is getting executed and one cool thing
37:25 - which everyone seems to love is this way
37:29 - to debug the view hierarchy or the view
37:31 - doing this kind of like blows everything
37:33 - out and you can see all of the different
37:37 - bits and of how your view is being
37:39 - rendered so that always gives a cool wow
37:42 - factor to people
37:44 - that's a way to see how your view is
37:46 - built so that's pretty much the five
37:48 - main areas I know we touched on them
37:51 - very lightly there are a couple of
37:53 - additional windows that I want to show
37:55 - you now one was the documentation window
37:58 - which is really helpful we already went
38:00 - through that another one is actually the
38:05 - let's go through organizer and basically
38:09 - this organizer shows you a bunch of your
38:12 - different archives know what are
38:14 - archives it's basically when you are
38:17 - ready to package up your app to be
38:19 - shipped off to someone's phone or maybe
38:22 - to the App Store this is where it would
38:24 - appear you would archive it and then you
38:26 - would get it will show up here in your
38:29 - archives and then what you would do is
38:31 - you can click on distribute app and it
38:34 - would send it to the the app review team
38:37 - to review but before you can actually
38:40 - click this button you in case you didn't
38:43 - know the way that Apple does this is
38:46 - that you have to pay them a membership
38:49 - fee
38:50 - I think it's $99 a year at the time of
38:52 - this recording it is I don't know how
38:54 - much he'll be in the future
38:55 - but that allows you to distribute apps
38:58 - into their app store so they it will
39:01 - also give you access to this place
39:04 - called app store Connect I might be
39:06 - wrong on that name because they keep
39:07 - changing the name but he used to be
39:10 - iTunes Connect and now it might be App
39:11 - Store Connect and it's basically a
39:13 - portal where you can go to create a
39:16 - directory listing for your app so you
39:18 - can add all the screenshots the
39:20 - description you can set the pricing for
39:22 - your app which countries it should be
39:24 - available and all of that those details
39:26 - and after you set that up then you can
39:28 - come in here in Xcode you can archive
39:30 - your project bundle it up it's going to
39:32 - show up here and then you click
39:33 - distribute app and it's gonna send it to
39:36 - Apple along with that description that
39:39 - catalog listing that you wrote and then
39:41 - the team at Apple is going to review it
39:44 - to make sure that your app follows all
39:46 - of the policies and guidelines that it
39:48 - has for its App Store and it's going to
39:50 - give you a pass or fail and if it fails
39:52 - no worries they'll give you what to fix
39:55 - up you fix it up you resubmit it they'll
39:57 - review it
39:58 - and then it's gonna pass and your app is
39:59 - gonna show up in the App Store so that's
40:01 - how that process works
40:03 - I hope this Xcode tutorial really helped
40:06 - you if you want to continue learning how
40:08 - to use Xcode to build apps make sure
40:10 - you're subscribed to this channel by
40:12 - hitting that subscribe button below and
