00:02 - hey coders what's up it's Chris here and
00:04 - today we're going to look at a simple
00:06 - example of saving and retrieving data
00:08 - from firebase but before we do that in
00:11 - the last lesson we had integrated the
00:13 - firebase SDK into our Xcode project via
00:16 - cocoa pods and there was actually an
00:18 - error or something I forgot to do in the
00:21 - cocoa pod pod file so I want to show you
00:24 - what that is and because it won't work
00:27 - otherwise
00:27 - so right here I'm looking at my firebase
00:30 - project folder I'm gonna go back into my
00:32 - pod file open it up with my text editor
00:34 - and up here we had forgot to uncomment
00:38 - any of these things what we need to do
00:40 - is uncomment this platform line like
00:43 - that and we also need to uncomment this
00:45 - one because we're using Swift so now you
00:48 - can save the file and we're gonna have
00:50 - to jump into terminal and we're going to
00:53 - have to navigate to our project folder
00:55 - where I'm already at and then we're
00:58 - going to have to pod update ok so now
01:03 - that that's done we can jump back into
01:05 - our project folder and open up the XC
01:08 - workspace alright so let's go back into
01:11 - the quick start which we were following
01:13 - right here and so we had done the cocoa
01:19 - pod setup and this is how we're going to
01:21 - write some data first of all we have to
01:23 - create a reference to our firebase
01:25 - database and so we're gonna grab this
01:28 - line right here so this creates a
01:30 - reference to our database I'm just going
01:33 - to put it in the viewdidload method for
01:35 - now and we have to change this URL here
01:38 - to our specific firebase app so if I go
01:41 - back into my account by default there's
01:43 - this first one right here I'm going to
01:46 - click on it manage app that's going to
01:48 - bring us to our dashboard and so you can
01:51 - see here that our data is going to be
01:54 - right here and this part is actually the
01:57 - part that I need or you can grab it from
01:58 - the URL up here so I'm just gonna grab
02:01 - that part and that needs to go in here
02:05 - and you can see that this is kind of
02:08 - just a mirror of what's up here in your
02:11 - address bar for your down
02:12 - bored okay and let's go back to the
02:15 - quick start and now we're just going to
02:17 - write a sample value into our database
02:20 - right now Xcode is complaining that
02:23 - firebase isn't a valid class because we
02:25 - haven't imported it up here like that
02:31 - let's press command B to build the
02:32 - project just to make sure that
02:34 - everything is running all right that
02:36 - looks good but what I also want to do is
02:38 - I just also want to add the reading data
02:41 - code so in this example of reading data
02:44 - is actually pretty cool because what's
02:46 - happening here is that it's going to
02:48 - retrieve the data but it's also going to
02:50 - listen for any changes to that piece of
02:53 - data and so what's going to happen is
02:55 - that with this block of code that we're
02:57 - specifying right here whenever the value
02:59 - changes or that piece of data changes
03:02 - this block of code is going to run so
03:04 - that works really well for things like a
03:06 - chat application or anything that you
03:08 - need to listen for changes you don't
03:10 - have to keep checking the database if
03:12 - there's fresh data so I'm just going to
03:14 - copy this part as well make sure that
03:16 - you're looking at the swift part because
03:18 - you can also choose Objective C for the
03:21 - code I'm just gonna add this right under
03:23 - here so there's gonna be any error here
03:27 - it should be print instead but other
03:29 - than that it's going to work perfectly
03:31 - so now I'm going to press command R to
03:33 - run it and we're going to see that it's
03:36 - gonna record this value into our
03:38 - database and then it's going to also
03:41 - retrieve it from the database and it's
03:44 - going to print it into the console so
03:46 - you can see that here so nil is the key
03:49 - and this is the value because when we
03:52 - save the data we didn't actually set a
03:54 - key for it and that's why the key is nil
03:57 - let's jump into our dashboard right now
03:59 - just to see the data and here you can
04:01 - see the value that we added now you
04:04 - might be wondering this looks kind of
04:06 - strange right where are my tables where
04:08 - are my classes if you're coming from the
04:10 - parse side which we spent you know a
04:13 - couple of weeks looking at the way that
04:14 - firebase stores the data is very very
04:17 - different
04:17 - where parse was a relational database
04:19 - meaning that it had different tables or
04:23 - record types for example you might have
04:25 - customers recordtype where has all your
04:28 - customers and then you have maybe
04:30 - another table with products or something
04:32 - like that and then there's a
04:33 - relationship between customers and
04:35 - products while firebase is a non
04:37 - relational database and it's very very
04:39 - important to understand the difference
04:41 - and how to structure your data optimally
04:43 - there are no concept of tables or record
04:46 - types or anything like that
04:48 - instead with firebase all your data is
04:50 - in a giant JSON tree so there's this
04:53 - document here that describes how your
04:56 - data is stored and it's very very
04:58 - important to understand the differences
05:00 - between this new data structure and
05:02 - non-relational data structure versus
05:04 - what we're used to in parse when I first
05:06 - started working with databases it was
05:08 - with MySQL and Microsoft sequel server
05:11 - and then with parse so everything has
05:13 - kind of been table based and relational
05:15 - and so it's been a mental shift for me
05:17 - as well to understand how to structure
05:19 - data in non-relational database such as
05:21 - firebase before we move forward with
05:24 - saving and retrieving data I think it's
05:26 - important that we spend a couple of
05:28 - lessons looking at all of the thoughts
05:29 - and considerations that we have to think
05:31 - about in terms of structuring our data
05:33 - if you want a head start you can read
05:36 - this document here understanding data
05:38 - and also this one right here structuring
05:41 - your data and if not well in the next
05:43 - few lessons I'll be going over these two
05:45 - documents with you and distilling the
05:47 - key points into a couple of videos for
05:49 - you guys so that's it for this video I
05:51 - hope you guys have a great weekend and
05:53 - I'll see you guys next week talk to you
05:55 - guys later bye
05:58 - you
