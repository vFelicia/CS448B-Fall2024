00:00 - hello and welcome in this video we're
00:01 - gonna learn how to use Sigma to create
00:04 - graphic assets for your app one of the
00:06 - really nice things about figma is that
00:08 - you can use it on PC and back and that's
00:10 - because it can be run completely in a
00:13 - browser window they also have a desktop
00:15 - app if you prefer that
00:17 - another area which figma shines in is
00:20 - that it's free for individuals if you
00:22 - want more collaborators on a Figment
00:24 - project then you're gonna have to start
00:26 - paying but for individuals you can use
00:29 - all of the features completely for free
00:31 - and personally I've been using figma for
00:33 - free for years now I'm gonna go through
00:36 - all the core and basic features and
00:38 - figma that you're going to need to
00:40 - create graphic assets however I'm also
00:42 - going to get you to do your own practice
00:44 - because really that's the only way
00:46 - you're gonna get good at this I'm also
00:48 - going to warn you that with all the
00:50 - things that I'm gonna be showing you in
00:51 - this video it might seem overwhelming
00:52 - but the more time you spend inside figma
00:55 - the more exercises you do like the ones
00:58 - following this lesson the more app
01:00 - designs that you do inside figma the
01:02 - more comfortable you will be inside of
01:03 - it and the better you will become does
01:06 - that sound good
01:07 - all right let's get started so the first
01:10 - thing to do is just to visit figma comm
01:12 - and sign up for a new account it's going
01:14 - to be completely free for us to use the
01:17 - only time you're gonna have to pay is if
01:19 - you want to use the collaborative
01:20 - features as a team and I think yes for
01:25 - an organization you can pay for a single
01:27 - person I think 12 dollars a month
01:30 - gives you some more perks and but for
01:33 - free you can get three projects to
01:36 - members and that's pretty pretty good
01:39 - because you're gonna find that this tool
01:41 - is very similar to sketch all of the
01:44 - capabilities even the shortcut keys in
01:47 - the locations of where you'll find
01:48 - things very similar so if you're
01:51 - thinking about paying for sketch you can
01:53 - take a look at this tool first and then
01:56 - decide the other thing that's really
01:58 - cool about figma is that it works on
02:00 - both Mac and Windows you can also use it
02:03 - in the browser and you can also download
02:05 - desktop apps in this demo I'm just going
02:08 - to do it in the browser because it's a
02:10 - pretty low effort to do and that's most
02:13 - often how people will start using figma
02:15 - and once they use it a little bit
02:17 - they'll go ahead and download the
02:18 - desktop app so sign up for a new account
02:20 - and once you do you're gonna jump into
02:22 - this area where you see all of your
02:23 - figma files so I'm gonna go ahead and
02:26 - open a new file just before I do that
02:28 - though if you wanted to get the desktop
02:29 - app you can go ahead and click this link
02:32 - here and it's gonna redirect you to the
02:35 - appropriate app for you so let's start a
02:38 - brand new file and let's jump in
02:43 - so when you open up your first figma
02:46 - file it's going to be a blank canvas
02:48 - what you're gonna want to do is create a
02:49 - frame and that basically outlines the
02:52 - area for your design so you can either
02:54 - press a on your keyboard for a shortcut
02:57 - key and that's going to open up a bunch
03:00 - of different default frame sizes for you
03:02 - or you can click this button here or
03:04 - pull down the drop-down or rather I'm
03:08 - already looking at the frame panel so if
03:10 - I were looking at something else I can
03:13 - select okay if I were looking at
03:14 - something else like this and you click
03:16 - this button up here it's gonna show you
03:18 - the different frame templates so I'm
03:20 - gonna go ahead and click on iPhone eight
03:23 - and it's gonna create this frame for me
03:25 - to create my design in I'm gonna delete
03:27 - this default frame I accidentally
03:29 - created alright so that is my frame and
03:32 - the concept of a frame you can also
03:35 - think of it as a screen so this would
03:37 - represent one screen in my app and if I
03:40 - were to add another frame that would be
03:44 - my second screen and then you can go
03:45 - ahead and and title these if you double
03:48 - click the name right there so for
03:50 - example this could be my home screen and
03:52 - the second one could be like my profile
03:54 - screen or something like that and
03:56 - actually I accidentally reversed the
03:58 - order so it could be something like that
04:01 - in order to navigate around there is a
04:04 - zoom button up here so you can go ahead
04:06 - and zoom in or out zoom to fit different
04:10 - percentage sizes in here the shortcut
04:11 - keys + + - to pan around on your canvas
04:15 - you would hold down the spacebar on your
04:18 - keyboard and you'd be able to drag
04:20 - around like that you can also zoom by
04:24 - holding the command key and scrolling up
04:27 - or down and that is going to allow you
04:28 - to zoom in as well without touching this
04:31 - sort of view control here
04:35 - now we're going to get to inserting some
04:38 - shapes and text onto our frames so go
04:41 - ahead select this first frame and you
04:44 - can either click this icon here or you
04:48 - can use the shortcut keys as you can see
04:50 - here on the side you'll notice that a
04:53 - lot of these shapes are very similar to
04:54 - sketch if you watch the last video let's
04:57 - start by putting a rectangle in there so
04:59 - select that and your mouse turns into
05:02 - these crosshairs and you can just draw a
05:04 - rectangle if you hold down shift it's
05:07 - going to force it to be a square so go
05:12 - ahead and try that try a couple of
05:14 - different shapes even with a circle for
05:16 - example you can do an ellipse or if you
05:19 - hold down shift it's going to be a
05:20 - perfect circle you'll notice that you're
05:22 - putting things into the frame it appears
05:25 - here on the left-hand side and this is
05:27 - sort of like a file navigator and lets
05:29 - you see all of your shapes and all of
05:32 - your elements as layers on your frame
05:34 - you can also rearrange these if you
05:37 - wanted let's say the circle over top the
05:41 - square you could rearrange the layers
05:44 - here and we're going to talk about this
05:46 - right hand panel here in just the next
05:48 - section but for now I want to point out
05:51 - to you how you can see all your shapes
05:54 - here some other handy features you can
05:57 - toggle the visibility by clicking this
06:00 - eye next to the layer or you could lock
06:02 - up certain layer by locking it like that
06:05 - and then you're not going to be able to
06:06 - accidentally edit that shape and you
06:09 - won't be able to select it so this can
06:11 - be useful if you want to avoid modifying
06:14 - that specific element now let's try a
06:16 - piece of text and that would be this
06:18 - text tool right here so go ahead and
06:20 - click that click anywhere you want to
06:22 - add some text and go ahead and type
06:24 - something
06:27 - then you can go ahead and rearrange that
06:33 - so we talked about layers and how when
06:36 - you're adding these elements into your
06:37 - frame they appear over on this left hand
06:40 - side and you can rearrange these
06:41 - different layers and lock them and turn
06:44 - them toggle their visibility on and off
06:47 - now I want to talk about grouping so for
06:50 - example if this text in this square you
06:53 - want to treat it as one component and
06:55 - you want them to move together let's say
06:57 - this represented some sort of profile
06:59 - picture or something like that you can
07:01 - go ahead and select both of them and
07:04 - either press command G for the shortcut
07:06 - key or just right-click and choose group
07:08 - selection now once you do that both of
07:10 - them appear as this group and let's say
07:13 - you can rename that as a profile photo
07:16 - or something like that and you can just
07:19 - drag them together as a unit like that
07:21 - now this is useful because you can go
07:24 - ahead and lock the entire group or you
07:27 - can toggle the visibility of the entire
07:29 - group and you can just keep those
07:31 - elements together especially as your
07:33 - frame gets more and more layers and
07:35 - components on top of it it's a good idea
07:39 - to start grouping things together that
07:41 - makes logical sense so that you can stay
07:44 - organized the other reason you'd want to
07:46 - group some elements together is if you
07:49 - want to turn it into a component which
07:51 - we are going to explain a little later
07:53 - on in this lesson but for now I want you
07:56 - to understand the concept of layers and
07:58 - the fact that you can group layers into
08:00 - groups like that
08:03 - now we're going to take a look at the
08:05 - right-hand side of the screen so we
08:06 - started here on the left this is where
08:08 - you get to see everything in your figma
08:11 - file from your frame to your individual
08:14 - groups and elements if you select one of
08:17 - them the details for what you selected
08:20 - appears on the right-hand side and you
08:22 - can do a whole bunch of things with that
08:24 - element for one thing up here if you
08:27 - select two elements you can align them
08:29 - together so if I highlight both of these
08:31 - I hold down shift and click both of them
08:33 - I can go ahead and align left like that
08:36 - or let's say I wanted to talk about line
08:39 - them together so that the tops of both
08:42 - elements line up together I could do
08:44 - that and there's a whole bunch of other
08:46 - options let's go back to just selecting
08:49 - one thing I can change the XY
08:52 - coordinates the height with this is that
08:54 - rotation so I can play around with that
08:55 - if you hover your mouse over the label
08:59 - for the textbox you can actually just
09:01 - drag it so you don't have to enter a
09:04 - number in there you can go like that now
09:07 - this part is corner radius if you have a
09:09 - box let's say the square right here you
09:11 - wanted to turn it into a rounded element
09:13 - you can go ahead and drag that let's say
09:15 - I changed this to 20 you can see that it
09:18 - becomes a rounded square there's a ton
09:22 - of things you can do here you can change
09:23 - the color here this takes a little bit
09:27 - of explaining the constraints so it's
09:29 - basically where you want that element to
09:31 - cling to if your frame size changes for
09:35 - example in this screen the default is
09:38 - left top so you can see these sort of
09:41 - two anchors here if I change this frame
09:44 - and I just kind of forcefully dragged it
09:46 - out you can see that it clings to the
09:48 - top left it doesn't matter how I change
09:51 - this but for example if I change the two
09:55 - right top you can see that now this line
09:58 - is here and this line is here so if I
10:00 - change the frame size it's gonna cling
10:02 - to the top and right so you can see how
10:06 - that clings on that anchor and that
10:10 - anchor point okay so let me just undo
10:13 - this
10:14 - all right let's keep going let's change
10:17 - that back to the left top we have fill
10:20 - we can fill this with different colors
10:22 - we have stroke and this is just another
10:24 - name for border so I can give it a red
10:27 - border give it a blue border or I'm
10:30 - modifying the text here am i let's see
10:35 - oh I'm modifying the whole group that's
10:37 - why the stroke is being applied to the
10:38 - text end the shape is because I was
10:41 - changing the stroke on the whole group
10:43 - see if you want to apply styles to a
10:46 - whole group of elements that's another
10:48 - reason why you would group them together
10:49 - let me undo that because I kind of just
10:52 - wanted to change the stroke on the
10:54 - rectangle so I'm gonna highlight that
10:57 - instead and now I can do a stroke just
11:00 - on that guy let's change that to blue
11:03 - and let's set that to like for just that
11:06 - as an example you can also do some
11:08 - effects let's see what we have here drop
11:11 - shadow so you can see that that's a
11:14 - really easy way to just put a shadow on
11:16 - something you can blur something out so
11:19 - if you have a photo or something like
11:21 - that and you want to add an effect you
11:24 - can do a layer blur or a background blur
11:26 - and finally on this bottom part here
11:30 - you'll notice an export section and here
11:34 - you can dictate if you want to export
11:36 - this at 1x 2x 3x or all three and you
11:42 - would add all of these different options
11:43 - and it allows you to specify the formats
11:45 - and the suffixes because for the iOS
11:49 - graphic assets when you need all three
11:52 - sizes the 2x and 3x versions have this
11:55 - suffix like this and this works the same
11:57 - way in sketch you'll notice if you're
11:59 - coming from sketch this is all very
12:01 - familiar and then at this point if you
12:04 - wanted to export the shape you could
12:05 - just click this button right here or
12:07 - when you're finished with your design as
12:10 - long as you have all of these export
12:12 - settings for the elements that you want
12:14 - to export set you can just mass export
12:17 - everything now we talked about rotating
12:20 - but in terms of scaling there is
12:23 - actually a tool here called scale in the
12:26 - shortcut key for that
12:28 - kay but if you want to scale this square
12:30 - and you choose scale what you're gonna
12:33 - end up doing is just dragging the
12:35 - corners like that and it's going to
12:37 - scale now one more thing I want to talk
12:41 - about are these buttons up here so there
12:45 - are a couple of different options let me
12:47 - undo that didn't mean to that I wanted
12:50 - to open up this menu to show you union
12:52 - selection subtract intersect and exclude
12:55 - now this is going to allow you to
12:58 - combine two different shapes together to
13:00 - create a new one and you can play around
13:02 - with these different settings but how
13:04 - you use them is let's say you wanted to
13:07 - make this square and this circle into
13:13 - this new shape that looks like that and
13:16 - if you highlighted both of them and you
13:17 - clicked Union selection it would turn it
13:20 - into one shape so that's one way you
13:22 - could play around with shapes you can
13:26 - also subtract something so for example
13:28 - if I drew a rectangle like that and I
13:32 - wanted to exclude I basically wanted to
13:34 - cut off this top part I could do that
13:37 - and instead I could choose subtract
13:40 - selection and then you know I would get
13:42 - a shape that looked like that so these
13:44 - tools up here are sometimes helpful so
13:47 - for example if you wanted to create like
13:50 - an arrow or something like that or I
13:53 - could do that and then I could rotate
13:56 - this 90 degrees it looks like I'll have
14:01 - to do 180 more than that 270 put them
14:07 - together like that and then highlight
14:09 - both of them and then click on Union and
14:12 - then I would have my new arrow shape
14:15 - another button I want to talk about up
14:18 - here is called mask and this can be
14:20 - helpful if you want to basically show a
14:24 - background through a certain shape let
14:27 - me show you what I mean I'm gonna go
14:29 - ahead and drag an image from my desktop
14:31 - into figma and yes you can do that if
14:34 - you didn't know let me try that again
14:36 - oh there it is okay and it's covering my
14:39 - arrow now let me move the air
14:41 - on top by adjusting the layers so let's
14:44 - say I wanted to show my mountain but I
14:46 - wanted it in the shape of this guy right
14:49 - here I can go ahead and select these two
14:51 - and then click on mask oops let me do it
14:54 - the other way around so the image
14:56 - actually has to be on top of my arrow
14:58 - there and click on mask and there it is
15:02 - so if the term mask is confusing to you
15:05 - think of the shape as a mask that your
15:07 - image is looking through
15:10 - so the last thing I want to talk about
15:12 - in this figma basics tutorial are
15:15 - components now you might notice here
15:20 - there is a button called create
15:22 - component and it kind of looks like this
15:24 - and then down here on the lower left
15:26 - hand corner you can browse your
15:29 - components by clicking this button you
15:31 - can see we don't have any and to go back
15:33 - to layers you would click this button
15:35 - okay so what our components the idea is
15:38 - that a component is a common element
15:40 - that you use across your different
15:42 - frames so for example we have this cool
15:45 - arrow that we created and no I didn't
15:48 - want to move that but I wanted to move
15:50 - these together let me just put this in a
15:52 - group I can move it together let's say I
15:54 - wanted to use this arrow in a couple
15:56 - different frames well I can let's say
16:00 - copy this and then go into my profile
16:02 - frame and then just paste it and I would
16:04 - have two copies well the only problem
16:07 - with this is if I modify one of them so
16:11 - let's say I change you know I change the
16:14 - way that this looks - something like
16:16 - that
16:17 - right this doesn't affect all of them
16:21 - right this only affects this one however
16:24 - if instead I turned my arrow here into a
16:30 - component by clicking this button you
16:32 - can see it turns purple and if I go into
16:35 - my components tab I will see this new
16:39 - arrow and then I can go into my profile
16:42 - instead and just drag this arrow here
16:44 - and what happens now is that when I
16:47 - modify this component it updates
16:50 - anywhere this component exists so I
16:53 - don't have different copies of the same
16:56 - element instead I turned it into a
16:58 - component I'm using that single
17:00 - component in multiple places so for
17:03 - instance if we go back to our layers tab
17:06 - now and I click on this component here I
17:09 - open it up and let's say I shift the
17:12 - background a little bit you can see that
17:14 - it updates whoops let's undo that submit
17:18 - this shifted a little bit you can see
17:20 - that it updates across
17:22 - all of the places where this component
17:24 - lives so that's really powerful because
17:26 - for instance oftentimes in your app
17:29 - you're gonna have multiple screens with
17:30 - a tab bar if your app has a tab bar and
17:33 - you want to update an icon on that tab
17:35 - bar well it would be great if that tab
17:38 - bar were a component so the same tab bar
17:40 - across all your screens would update all
17:43 - at once instead of you having to go into
17:45 - each screen and update that icon you
17:47 - know X number of times depending on how
17:49 - many screens you have so those are
17:52 - components in figma in sketch they have
17:54 - the same concept it's called symbols
17:56 - you're gonna see us using a lot of these
17:58 - in the upcoming lessons okay so what do
18:01 - you think when I first started using
18:03 - figma I felt a little lost too because
18:05 - know me how to use the tool is one thing
18:07 - but knowing how to use the tool to
18:09 - create nice looking graphics for your
18:11 - app is an entirely different thing right
18:13 - so that's why it's gonna be really
18:15 - helpful for you to try the practice
18:17 - exercises in the next lesson to just get
18:20 - familiar with figma and start using it
18:23 - to produce more practical graphic assets
18:25 - for your app just like coding the more
18:28 - time you spend creating these graphics
18:29 - using figma and just immersing yourself
18:32 - into design the easier it's gonna get
18:34 - the more naturally it's going to come
18:36 - with that said I'll see you in the next
18:38 - lesson
