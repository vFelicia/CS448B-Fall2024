00:06 - hey guys welcome to iOS programming
00:08 - Basics where I'm going to take you from
00:11 - scratch to building iPhone apps even if
00:13 - you have no programming background now
00:15 - previously on YouTube I've got a bunch
00:18 - of different series some on xcode some
00:20 - on Objective C and uh reading the
00:22 - feedback I saw that a lot of people were
00:24 - confused with which videos they should
00:26 - watch and which uh which series they
00:28 - should follow now I've revamped the
00:30 - lesson plan starting with this video um
00:34 - and this is the one that you should
00:35 - follow and it's going to be designed to
00:37 - take you from you know through all of
00:39 - the programming Basics and Concepts to
00:42 - building apps in no
00:43 - time now the other really exciting thing
00:46 - about um this new series is that uh the
00:49 - I'm going to take a very practical
00:51 - approach um to teaching now how I
00:55 - learned iOS myself I I failed I
00:58 - literally I read book from cover to
01:01 - cover and then I sat down in front of
01:03 - the keyboard and I proceeded to try to
01:05 - build an app but what I realized is that
01:08 - I I I retained very little of that
01:10 - knowledge because I wasn't actually
01:11 - practicing as I was reading I understood
01:14 - the concepts because I I had a
01:16 - programming background and I felt
01:18 - confident but once you know I put my my
01:21 - fingers to the keyboard I realized that
01:23 - I actually couldn't do it so then I
01:26 - started doing tutorials on the net
01:28 - starting to build like small demo
01:30 - applications um to lay the building
01:32 - blocks of my iOS education and that's
01:35 - actually how I eventually learned iOS
01:37 - programming so that's the that's the
01:40 - approach that I'm going to take here
01:41 - where we're going to just Dive Right In
01:43 - and we're going to um you're going to
01:45 - learn through doing and through building
01:48 - apps and that's the approach I'm going
01:49 - to take to teach you rather than teach
01:51 - you all of the concepts and all of the
01:52 - theory up front we're going to learn
01:54 - that along the way while building demos
01:57 - and building apps together so let me
02:00 - show you guys the lesson plan as you can
02:02 - see covering the basics uh we have only
02:05 - a couple of videos but then we jump
02:07 - right into doing a hello world demo and
02:10 - then we do a recap and I'll explain to
02:12 - you um you know some some of the
02:14 - concepts that that we learn through
02:16 - doing that demo and then we Pro uh we
02:19 - proceed to doing another demo and again
02:22 - you know this is the approach that I
02:24 - want to take uh by actually getting you
02:27 - guys to follow along open up xcode
02:30 - practice and I'll explain these Concepts
02:32 - along the way and I think they'll be
02:34 - easier to absorb for you guys and plus
02:37 - it will stick better um and then after
02:39 - we finish the basics we're going to
02:41 - actually try a little bit more complex
02:44 - of an app so this dice roll application
02:47 - is something that you guys might have
02:48 - seen before in some of my previous
02:50 - videos but I'm going to revamp it a
02:52 - little bit and I'm going to take you
02:54 - guys step by step through it and then
02:56 - we're going to do another application to
02:59 - practice it's a soundboard application
03:01 - you guys have seen this in the App Store
03:03 - where you press buttons and play some
03:05 - sounds and again this will teach us um
03:08 - New Concepts such as how to how to play
03:11 - media and how to use scroll views and
03:13 - creating settings menus and stuff like
03:15 - that so very very practical stuff and
03:17 - from there we're going to continue to
03:19 - move on building harder and harder apps
03:21 - as you build your skills and this is
03:23 - literally How I Learned iOS programming
03:25 - myself and I know you guys will learn it
03:27 - the same way so I hope you guys follow
03:30 - along for the ride and keep watching
