00:00 - in the previous video I covered all the options 
for becoming an iOS Developer but in this video  
00:04 - I want to lay out a step-by-step plan for you 
to actually achieve it so at a high level the  
00:09 - previous video covered the following options 
for becoming an iOS Developer self-teaching  
00:14 - via course attending a university or college 
program or joining a boot camp and if I were  
00:19 - to start all over from day one I think I would 
choose to learn on my own there are just so many  
00:24 - good resources out there including my own where 
someone can just pick up this skill so with the  
00:29 - self-teaching option in mind here's step one of 
how to become an iOS Developer step by step the  
00:34 - first step to becoming an iOS Developer begins 
before you even start learning and it is to  
00:39 - prepare yourself mentally don't underestimate the 
power of mindset because it drives your actions if  
00:46 - you start this journey with the wrong mindset you 
will fail so here are three things that I would do  
00:50 - to have a successful mindset here's thing number 
one I remember when I first started teaching iOS  
00:55 - back in 2013 and I noticed the pattern some people 
would learn iOS and go on to find jobs and launch  
01:01 - apps in the store While others would give up 
pretty early on there were rarely people who  
01:05 - would make it halfway and then call it quits when 
I asked the quitters why they quit it would always  
01:10 - be something along the lines of it was harder than 
I thought or I didn't have time or coding wasn't  
01:15 - for me now my issue with these reasons is that 
they're flimsy excuses for not achieving your goal  
01:21 - and why you're quitting an actual deal-breaking 
reason to quit would be something like my map  
01:26 - blew up and I can't use it anymore or I broke my 
finger so I'm gonna have to pause this for now  
01:31 - so this led me to draw this learning curve to 
help people visualize the Journey of learning  
01:36 - iOS development I called it the hump terrible 
in him right comment below if you have a better  
01:40 - name and I may adopt it it starts off easy and 
you're enjoying yourself but starts to ramp up  
01:46 - in Challenge and frustration at this point if you 
thought it was going to be a walk in the park to  
01:50 - launch your own app or that you learn the skills 
for a six-figure job in a couple of months you'll  
01:55 - quit I guarantee it because your expectation is 
so far from reality that when reality finally hits  
02:00 - It's a steep draw but if you persist work through 
the frustration and Challenge and learn from your  
02:06 - mistakes you'll make progress little by little 
and then after a certain point things will get  
02:11 - easier and you will reach your goal here's the 
interesting thing though the learning material  
02:17 - and skills required they do not get easier 
in fact they get more complex as you progress  
02:22 - but my observation is that people either quit 
here in the beginning or they reach their goal  
02:28 - so what gives why would the material be the most 
complex here yet the difficulty is also the lowest  
02:36 - here the reason is because the graph doesn't 
measure objective difficulty of the material  
02:41 - it measures your perception of the difficulty 
of the material and why is that more important  
02:47 - it comes back to mindset let me walk you through 
it in the beginning you're not sure if you can  
02:52 - achieve your goal it's starting to get harder and 
harder and it's beginning to seem like reaching  
02:57 - your goal is less and less likely that's what 
many people will give up especially those who  
03:02 - thought it was going to be easy but you're 
different you stick with it and you struggle  
03:07 - a bit through little successes and small wins 
here and there something begins to change in your  
03:11 - mind you start realizing that you can do it and 
that's all it takes really perceived difficulty  
03:18 - starts going down as confidence in yourself rises 
even though the material is getting more complex  
03:24 - so to sum it up have realistic expectations about 
the time it'll take and the commitment it's going  
03:30 - to require from you to gain these valuable IOS app 
development skills you will encounter frustration  
03:36 - but it'll be worth it in the end and this leads 
me to thing number two if you are learning a new  
03:42 - skill how long do you think it would take perhaps 
you've heard of the 10 000 hour rule for Mastery  
03:48 - in Malcolm gladwell's book outliers but have you 
heard of another book by Josh Kaufman called the  
03:54 - first 20 hours his research led him to believe 
that if you spend just 20 hours of deliberate  
03:59 - practice on the right skills you can get pretty 
good at whatever skill you're learning now whether  
04:04 - that's true or not I'm not going to debate that 
but it is the inspiration behind this strategy  
04:09 - and that's to open up your calendar and pencil 
in 20 one hour sessions to learn iOS development  
04:16 - this way you're going to prioritize it with 
the other things that are going on in your  
04:21 - life plus it gives you a short-term goal more 
on why that's important a little later now let  
04:26 - me tell you a story I turned 40 this year and 
it's the first time in my life that I've been  
04:31 - able to consistently get exercise why because 
I finally made room for it in my daily routine  
04:37 - and I prioritize it just as highly as everything 
else in my life and now it's just a part of my day  
04:43 - and I don't have to give it a second thought so 
don't try to learn iOS on top of everything else  
04:48 - going on in your life make a routine spot on your 
calendar preferably a quiet time where you can be  
04:54 - undisturbed and prioritize it finally we come 
to thing number three we all have a reason to  
05:00 - become an iOS Developer oh it's going to be great 
when I'm working on Apple and making hundreds of  
05:05 - thousands of dollars each year or ah I can just 
imagine my app going viral and making millions  
05:10 - from the App Store the problem is that it's a long 
long journey and when you're struggling in pain  
05:16 - tired you want to quit you can feel like you'll 
never reach that end result you might as well  
05:21 - quit now and watch some Netflix right this might 
help set two goals instead of just having one  
05:28 - the long-term goal you know this is the 
initial reason that caused you to embark  
05:31 - on this journey and also have a short-term input 
based goal this could be a goal of doing 21-hour  
05:39 - sessions before even thinking of quitting 
or maybe you'll commit to learning for at  
05:43 - least two months before considering quitting the 
important thing is that it is near term and it's  
05:49 - input based meaning that it's within your control 
because you can control how much time and effort  
05:54 - you input so thing number three is to have two 
goals the long-term goal which reminds you of  
05:59 - why you're on this journey but the short-term 
goal helps you keep making progress bit by bit  
06:04 - do you notice that all three mindset strategies 
are to prevent you from quitting prematurely and  
06:10 - sometimes that's all it takes if you just persist 
a little bit longer past the frustration there is  
06:16 - a high chance that you'll succeed okay next step 
number two is very important because guess what  
06:20 - there's a ton of stuff you don't need to learn in 
iOS development and you can still reach your goal  
06:25 - you can dramatically reduce the time it takes to 
reach your goal by selectively choosing only the  
06:31 - specific skills you need and it all depends on 
what your goal is and that's what I'm going to  
06:36 - break down for you in step two and it's in the 
next video so make sure you hit subscribe so you  
06:40 - don't miss it in the meantime please comment 
below which is your favorite mindset strategy  
06:44 - number one having realistic expectations number 
two penciling in the sessions on your calendar  
06:50 - or number three having two goals instead of just 
one alright thanks for watching and we're going  
06:56 - to continue this how to become an iOS Developer 
step by step in the next video I'll see you there
