00:00 - hey code crew what's up it's Chris here
00:02 - now this video is a little bit different
00:04 - from our usual videos where you see the
00:08 - backdrop in the back and that frames
00:10 - this is still the same room it's just
00:11 - that I'm not using the computer today
00:14 - because in this lesson I want to tell
00:16 - you about what we're going to be
00:18 - building in this series I realized that
00:20 - I haven't really talked about that all I
00:23 - told you in the previous lesson was that
00:26 - we're going to incorporate firebase
00:28 - authentication with a custom login UI
00:30 - and we're going to use fire store to
00:33 - store our data now those two things are
00:36 - true but I didn't just want to build a
00:40 - demo demonstrating those things I wanted
00:43 - to actually build a full-fledged app
00:45 - something that we could submit to the
00:47 - app store and that way it I think it's a
00:51 - lot more practical and you can also see
00:53 - things from end to end so today I'm
00:55 - gonna be talking about the app idea
00:58 - which we're going to be building now
01:00 - there was such a broad spectrum of
01:03 - things that I could do with only the
01:05 - requirements of authentication in
01:07 - storing data you're saying fire store
01:10 - literally any app that has login and has
01:13 - data so I really had a hard time
01:17 - thinking of an app idea that was not too
01:20 - big in scope and that wasn't too small
01:24 - that it would be too trivial and
01:25 - wouldn't be useful at all I went through
01:28 - a whole bunch of different ideas but
01:29 - every time I did that I just start
01:32 - adding more and more things and I know
01:35 - it would take a lot of time to build and
01:38 - the problem with that it's not that I
01:40 - don't want to show you guys how to build
01:42 - a really complex out it's just that
01:45 - those things would take a pretty long
01:48 - time and there is a high chance that I
01:51 - won't finish it because it's something
01:55 - that I struggle with and that is
01:58 - finishing projects so what I want to
02:01 - train myself to do is to not bite off
02:05 - more than I can chew is to be really
02:08 - specific about the feature set that I
02:10 - want to implement as
02:12 - v1 Minimum Viable Product and submitted
02:16 - to the App Store and get it out there
02:18 - and really go through that process and
02:20 - build up my habit of finishing my
02:24 - projects and shipping it and I think
02:28 - that's not something that's uncommon to
02:32 - a lot of people I think I you know game
02:35 - developers especially I know they have a
02:37 - lot of half-finished games or game
02:40 - prototypes lying around and they're
02:41 - notorious for having to build up this
02:44 - habit of completing their games and
02:47 - shipping it and so I have the same
02:49 - problem here with apps I want to build
02:51 - something that is small enough that I
02:53 - can publish now I can I can tell you
02:57 - some of the ideas that I did have I have
02:59 - this notebook that I just write in some
03:02 - of the time and just whenever I have an
03:04 - idea now the first idea I had was a poll
03:07 - app and that is basically the way I
03:10 - described it here in the book was a
03:12 - crowdsource a decision on you're
03:15 - undecided matters so I know a lot of the
03:18 - time especially if you've got a
03:21 - significant other they'll come to you
03:23 - and ask you oh should I wear this or
03:24 - that with hat and so you know me being
03:28 - so tired of answering those types of
03:30 - questions I'm not so much now but in
03:33 - more so in the past this app would
03:37 - basically allow the user to take two
03:39 - photos of two different decisions post
03:43 - it and have their friends kind of vote
03:45 - on it so that would be the poll part of
03:48 - it and my name that I thought of for
03:50 - that app was this or that so it's
03:53 - basically two simple decisions now I
03:55 - started going kind of out of hand with
03:57 - this because there's so much that you
03:59 - can do with this it might sound like a
04:00 - simple idea but even the notion of being
04:04 - able to add friends then it seems like
04:08 - such a simple feature but you have to
04:10 - think about what that entails right
04:13 - being able to add a friend means that
04:16 - you have to implement the ability to
04:19 - send a friend request and then have the
04:21 - other person accept or reject it it also
04:24 - breaks into
04:27 - what sorts of things do you want to
04:30 - allow other people to see are you is it
04:34 - going to be like a free-for-all like
04:35 - just think about Facebook's own privacy
04:37 - settings even even having a friend on
04:41 - Facebook you have close-knit circles and
04:44 - you have you have different different
04:46 - groups I think different privacy
04:48 - settings now I don't use Facebook that
04:50 - much but I I know that they have
04:53 - different privacy settings even within
04:55 - your friends so I think there's a notion
04:58 - of friends and close friends or
04:59 - something like that I might be wrong on
05:01 - that but so anyways that was that idea
05:04 - another one was a Wine Library type of
05:08 - app where you can basically add wines
05:12 - from your wine collection take a photo
05:14 - of the bottle and label and put your
05:17 - tasting notes and all of that stuff on
05:19 - it and it basically just keep track of
05:23 - your collection of wine or maybe wines
05:25 - that you want to try now I'm not a huge
05:29 - wine connoisseur myself but I can see
05:32 - that this app you know I enjoy the glass
05:34 - of wine from time to time and my own
05:36 - difficulty is that I might try a bottle
05:39 - and I really like it but I don't really
05:42 - keep track of it I don't remember I
05:43 - throw I always throw away the bottles I
05:45 - don't keep them and then the next time I
05:47 - want to buy wine I forget what that was
05:49 - and so you know this was something that
05:51 - was going to help me keep track of the
05:53 - ones that I do like that I have enjoyed
05:56 - but I can see this being an app that
05:59 - could be adopted for different purposes
06:03 - maybe collectors who collect different
06:05 - things just as a way for them to keep
06:08 - track of a collection of something you
06:10 - know fun tip at one point I actually
06:12 - collected Starbucks cards now these are
06:15 - the little gift cards that you can get
06:16 - at Starbucks and they have little
06:18 - different designs on them these days
06:20 - they produce so many different designs
06:22 - that I kind of gave up but back then in
06:25 - the early days there weren't as many
06:27 - designs so it definitely was collectible
06:29 - and the cool thing was that every
06:31 - country would have their own designs and
06:34 - their own Starbucks cards and so it was
06:36 - fun getting the cards from like all over
06:38 - the world
06:38 - so that was something that I collected
06:40 - at one point I also considered
06:43 - continuing my Pomodoro timer app now
06:47 - that is definitely something that I want
06:50 - to continue in it for those of you guys
06:51 - who have been watching this channel for
06:53 - a little longer you know that about
06:56 - maybe over six months ago maybe eight
06:58 - months ago I was doing live streams
07:00 - every week where we were going to build
07:02 - an app together and we were gonna submit
07:04 - it to the App Store and we got so far as
07:08 - determining the future set and doing
07:10 - some design work on it but and then an
07:13 - early prototype for working with timers
07:17 - in the background even when your app is
07:19 - off we did some work with that but it
07:22 - was never completed so another testament
07:24 - to my inability to finish projects what
07:27 - I make up for that though is that I
07:29 - won't give up so it's always in the back
07:31 - of my mind and I am definitely gonna
07:33 - come back and finish this project so
07:35 - finally the idea that I did arrive at
07:38 - for this fire store and authentication
07:42 - series is something that I've actually
07:45 - been wanting to do myself and it's
07:49 - something that I've been I wouldn't say
07:51 - struggling I'm not actually actively
07:53 - trying to do this but it's something
07:55 - that I can see the benefits of and that
07:57 - is a daily gratitude journal so you know
08:02 - we have so much to be thankful for no
08:04 - matter what our situation is there's
08:07 - always going to be things that we want
08:09 - the things that we want to achieve or
08:11 - maybe material things that we want in
08:13 - life goals that we haven't hit yet but I
08:16 - think that also oftentimes takes us away
08:21 - from looking at what we do have because
08:23 - there are people who are less fortunate
08:25 - than us who have less than us and they
08:28 - would just love to have just the ability
08:31 - to walk for example someone who might
08:33 - not be in very good health just walking
08:35 - to the bathroom by themselves or maybe
08:38 - being able to enjoy oranges for example
08:41 - someone who has stomach problems we
08:43 - can't take that sort of citric acid that
08:46 - acidity and so I think there are there's
08:50 - a lot for all
08:51 - us to be thankful for things that we
08:54 - kind of take for granted and we don't
08:55 - notice from day to day family right a
08:59 - lot of people have lost loved ones and
09:01 - things like that and sometimes you you
09:04 - just don't know what you have until it's
09:05 - gone right I think that's saying it's so
09:07 - true
09:07 - so this gratitude journal normally
09:11 - that's something that's kind of private
09:14 - I would say but the idea here is a
09:17 - social gratitude journal and the reason
09:20 - I say social is because I think this
09:25 - would be a good experiment because I
09:27 - think in sharing what you're grateful
09:30 - for it makes other people who read that
09:34 - reflect on their life and you know if
09:37 - that's something that they can be
09:39 - grateful for as well and in addition to
09:43 - being able to see what other people are
09:45 - grateful for and you can obviously write
09:48 - your own post you'll only be able to
09:52 - like each other's posts and I use the
09:56 - term like very loosely because I don't
09:59 - know if it's gonna be you know like
10:00 - thumbs up or high-five or something like
10:02 - that but some sort of props and in
10:05 - posting what you're grateful for and
10:07 - then receiving you know thanks or
10:10 - receiving handclaps or high-fives for
10:12 - that I think that will also reinforce
10:15 - your good vibes a and also reinforce
10:21 - your want to post again the next day and
10:24 - the idea of the app is to hopefully
10:27 - build up your habit to have a daily
10:30 - habit to think about what you're
10:33 - grateful for so this one I think is a
10:36 - simple app to implement I can see a use
10:39 - for it certainly for myself I think will
10:41 - be the fun experiment to see if to see
10:45 - if people like to do this in a social
10:48 - sort of way
10:49 - versus in a private sort of way so let
10:53 - me go through kind of like a v1 what
10:55 - features I had in mind so obviously we
10:58 - have creating an account and logging in
11:00 - then you'd be able to see a list of
11:03 - posts
11:04 - by other people and then you'd be able
11:06 - to obviously like a post whether that
11:10 - that is thanking or hand clapping
11:13 - remains to be seen
11:15 - you're going to be able to write a new
11:17 - post your own you know what you're
11:19 - grateful for and then we're gonna also
11:23 - have your profile and that's just going
11:25 - to be your username which you can edit
11:27 - maybe some stats like how many times
11:29 - you've posted what's your longest streak
11:31 - how many handclaps or likes or
11:34 - high-fives you've received ability to
11:36 - delete your account I think that's
11:38 - important now due to privacy and all
11:40 - that and also to be able to see a list
11:42 - of your own posts and to be able to
11:44 - delete them and finally just a welcomed
11:48 - sort of tutorial screen the minute you
11:50 - create your account just to give you an
11:52 - overview of what the different tabs do
11:54 - how you use the app and what it's for
11:56 - and that sort of thing so that's it like
11:59 - that's the app in its hole and and
12:00 - that's where I want to get it to to be
12:04 - able to publish that into the App Store
12:06 - I do have some v2 ideas such as private
12:11 - only posts so maybe you're posting
12:13 - something sensitive but you still want
12:15 - to write it if you set it to like
12:17 - private only then it's only gonna show
12:19 - up for you like you'll be able to see it
12:22 - in your post feed but then it won't be
12:24 - social and won't other people are not
12:27 - going to see that maybe commenting maybe
12:30 - profile photos push notifications so
12:34 - that when you post something it's gonna
12:35 - notify other people reminder
12:38 - notifications so something that would
12:40 - remind you each day to write what you're
12:43 - grateful for and then maybe just
12:45 - collapsible posts because I'm not
12:47 - planning to complicate it further by
12:49 - allowing you to drill into a post I'm
12:52 - just going to put the full text in the
12:55 - list now if you have more suggestions
12:58 - and ideas for features and v2 ideas
13:02 - please drop me a comment below and let
13:04 - me know I definitely have a lot to think
13:08 - about there's there's a lot more I know
13:10 - that I can do with this for the v1
13:12 - however I want to make it just that
13:14 - feature set because I think that's
13:17 - the minimum amount of features that's
13:19 - going to make it useful and I want to
13:20 - polish it I want to make it like really
13:23 - really fluid and really nice to use and
13:25 - so that you want to keep using it so
13:28 - that's the idea there I hope that that's
13:31 - something that you're interested in and
13:33 - if not I hope you will even stick around
13:35 - just to figure out how to do some of
13:39 - these features from a technical
13:40 - standpoint because you can definitely
13:41 - adapt what you learn to your own app
13:45 - idea and I think it's going to be really
13:47 - fun for us to get to the end here and
13:49 - then submit the app together I'll show
13:51 - you guys how to write all the metadata
13:53 - create the screenshots write the
13:54 - description submit it from Xcode and it
13:58 - will hopefully get it approved I haven't
14:00 - done any sort of competitor analysis I
14:05 - haven't seen what other gratitude
14:09 - journal apps out there do I haven't
14:11 - thought about how to monetize this app
14:13 - or anything like that
14:14 - the goal isn't really for me to make any
14:17 - money off of it I really just want to
14:20 - build up the habit of finishing my apps
14:23 - publishing them and at the same time
14:26 - being able to teach you guys different
14:28 - features and I think also one more thing
14:31 - is that by making this app shorter I am
14:34 - able to finish it and then move on and
14:36 - create a different app tutorial series
14:39 - for you guys showing a completely
14:41 - different set of features if we were to
14:44 - really just work on this and and do a
14:47 - big complex app it probably take up
14:50 - months and months and then this will be
14:53 - the only thing you guys see on the
14:55 - YouTube channel for like half the year
14:57 - so you know I think that's the other
15:00 - benefit of doing a short feature set
15:04 - anyways I hope you guys enjoyed that if
15:06 - so please give me a like subscribe if
15:10 - you want to see the future videos don't
15:11 - forget to hit that Bell icon so that you
15:13 - know when the next video comes up
15:15 - alright thanks for watching I'll see you
15:17 - guys next time
