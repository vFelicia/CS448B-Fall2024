00:05 - hello welcome to this video where I'm
00:08 - going to do a walk-through of the Xcode
00:10 - user interface and the Xcode right now
00:13 - that you see on the screen is xcode 6.4
00:16 - so if you're running Xcode 6 6.1 you
00:19 - know any of the Xcode 6 series the
00:22 - interface will look like this and from
00:24 - version to version they don't change
00:26 - that drastically especially with the
00:28 - panel walkthroughs that I'm going to do
00:30 - for you today they have been pretty
00:33 - consistent between versions anyhow let's
00:35 - get started
00:36 - the first thing we're going to look at
00:38 - is this top bar right across the top
00:40 - here you can see with this button that
00:42 - is the button that you will use to run
00:45 - your project and what it does is it
00:47 - compiles your code and opens up the iOS
00:50 - simulator and you can then test out your
00:54 - app in the simulator and here next you
00:57 - can choose the simulator that you want
01:01 - to run it on whether you know it's the
01:03 - actual device if you have one or one of
01:06 - these other simulated environments and
01:10 - here in the middle is just the status
01:12 - and on the right hand top corner there
01:16 - are a couple of buttons to control how
01:19 - the panel's slide in and out which
01:22 - panels you want visible or not invisible
01:24 - so for example this one right here hides
01:27 - or shows the Navigator right so you see
01:30 - that left panel sliding in and out and
01:32 - this Navigator shows you it's got a
01:36 - couple of tabs first of all notice that
01:37 - across here there are a couple of icons
01:40 - but most commonly you'll be looking at
01:42 - this first one and it shows you all the
01:45 - files in your project on the center
01:49 - right here
01:50 - this is where you're going to be editing
01:53 - your code and writing your code on the
01:55 - right hand side this panel is called the
01:58 - inspector in this button right here
01:59 - controls that and this inspector is
02:02 - useful for when you're looking at a
02:05 - specific file for example and you want
02:08 - to see some properties related to that
02:11 - file or for instance if you're left
02:13 - the storyboard we're going to customize
02:15 - the user interface of your app this
02:18 - right-hand side this inspector if you're
02:21 - selecting an element on the storyboard
02:24 - so for instance if I select you know I
02:27 - scroll view here and then I go over to
02:30 - inspector on the right hand side there
02:32 - are a couple of tabs as well notice here
02:34 - I can customize the properties for that
02:37 - element now notice that this inspector
02:41 - pane this whole right hand side pane is
02:43 - kind of split into two sections the
02:45 - bottom section actually has a couple
02:47 - more tabs so don't get confused they're
02:50 - most commonly you'll see me on this
02:52 - object library tab where are you going
02:54 - to see all of the different elements
02:56 - that you can add on to the storyboard
02:59 - okay and finally this this section here
03:03 - in the below the code editor is called
03:08 - the debug area and here's the icon to
03:11 - hide or show that and these buttons are
03:13 - useful for working off of a laptop
03:17 - screen well you may not have as much
03:19 - screen real estate you can hide all the
03:22 - panels that you don't need and just work
03:24 - on your code so the debug area is for
03:28 - when you're troubleshooting your code
03:29 - maybe your app crashes when it runs and
03:32 - you're going to see some text here it's
03:34 - also split into two sides in the debug
03:37 - area here you'll see that there's these
03:39 - icons and in future debugging videos
03:44 - we're going to actually dive into using
03:47 - this debug area to troubleshoot your
03:50 - code so I won't get too much into that
03:52 - for this video I just wanted to walk
03:54 - through kind of where all of the panels
03:57 - and controls are so one more thing to
03:59 - note is in the storyboard here you've
04:03 - got this pane right here that lists all
04:06 - of your elements and your view hierarchy
04:09 - and this is called the document outline
04:12 - and to slide it in or out you click this
04:16 - icon here so a lot of people don't
04:18 - notice that there's a little icon here
04:20 - in your storyboard that you can hide or
04:22 - show that and this is very handy to have
04:24 - simply because sometimes when you have
04:26 - elements over
04:27 - laughing each other it's hard to select
04:29 - it with your mouse so you can just click
04:31 - it off of this outline here and also
04:33 - visually you're able to see which
04:35 - elements are children elements of other
04:39 - elements in this storyboard here it's
04:43 - hard to tell sometimes if an element is
04:46 - inside of an another element or if it's
04:49 - sitting on top of it and by looking at
04:50 - this document outline simply because of
04:52 - how it's indented you can see you know
04:55 - what the hierarchy is finally there are
04:59 - a couple of more buttons beside these
05:02 - icons which you used to hide and show
05:04 - with the panes and this is the single
05:07 - edit view or the standard editor which
05:09 - by default you're going to be looking at
05:11 - and then secondly there's something
05:14 - called the assistant editor now when you
05:16 - activate this in your storyboard
05:18 - it's going to show you the the code file
05:23 - that is related to you know this view
05:26 - controller that you're looking at in the
05:28 - storyboard so if I don't have enough
05:30 - space I can just hide the document
05:32 - outline for a second and this is useful
05:34 - for when you're trying to connect your
05:36 - elements to your code file as iboutlet
05:39 - properties you can also furthermore this
05:44 - is this last one is the version editor
05:46 - which I don't find myself using too
05:49 - often but lets you compare two versions
05:52 - of the file so I'm just going to go back
05:55 - to the single edit view here and I'm
06:03 - going to go back to a code file here
06:06 - another useful feature are these arrows
06:09 - right here so if you're jumping from
06:11 - file to file let's say I'm looking at
06:13 - this viewcontroller.swift file and I
06:15 - switch over the card Swift and I want to
06:17 - go back rather than clicking
06:19 - viewcontroller.swift I can just press
06:21 - this back arrow or forward arrow to go
06:24 - you know to to traverse how I was
06:28 - navigating between files and notice here
06:31 - that there's also this breadcrumb which
06:33 - is very handy and it lets you jump from
06:36 - file to file like that
06:44 - okay I think that pretty much wraps it
06:46 - up for a walkthrough of the main pieces
06:49 - of the user interface for Xcode stay
06:52 - tuned for more tips and tricks on how to
06:54 - use Xcode
