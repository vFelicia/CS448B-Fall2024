00:00 - hello and welcome back so I've gathered
00:02 - up all of the issues and feedback from
00:03 - our internal testing and I want to show
00:05 - you what we have to fix with our app
00:07 - before we can submit it to Apple for
00:09 - review and I've also read your comments
00:11 - in the last Vlog where I asked for some
00:14 - advice about scroll Direction so I want
00:16 - to go through that as well by the way
00:18 - thank you for commenting but before we
00:21 - dive in I want to just let you know in
00:23 - case you're new here this is a raw and
00:25 - unscripted video series chronicling our
00:28 - team's journey and building apps for
00:30 - profit this entry is dated April 23rd
00:33 - 2024 with that said I hope you enjoy
00:36 - hello welcome back thank you everyone
00:38 - who commented in the last Vlog where I
00:40 - was looking for some advice just for
00:42 - context in case you didn't watch the
00:44 - previous one this is what I asked in
00:46 - this entry log here it's in
00:49 - chronological
00:50 - order which way should you scroll to see
00:54 - previous entries should the most recent
00:56 - entry be at the top of the list or at
00:59 - the bottom of the list right and the
01:02 - reason I struggled with this is because
01:04 - the way that it felt
01:06 - natural I felt like the most recent one
01:09 - should be at the top and these ones
01:12 - below it should be older
01:13 - ones but that is opposite of a calendar
01:18 - where future dates should be at the
01:22 - bottom and you're
01:23 - scrolling to see the future so I the
01:27 - calendar I had this flipped around
01:29 - because when you're reading a calendar
01:31 - April 30th when you go to the right this
01:34 - should be May 1st not March 1st so for
01:38 - the calendar this felt really wrong and
01:40 - so I'm going to flip this around but on
01:42 - a list it's opposite and that's exactly
01:44 - what everyone touched on in the comments
01:47 - here so let me just read some of most
01:50 - recent at the top in the past scrolling
01:51 - down feels more natural great video for
01:53 - sure it helps thank you so much um it's
01:56 - the difference between chronological
01:57 - order and a to-do list mentality
02:01 - if it was to-do list then most critical
02:03 - things at top if you're dealing with
02:04 - chronological I think the latest thing
02:06 - should be at the bottom as long as you
02:07 - don't have to scroll to find
02:09 - it um here I agree with what you said
02:12 - about the calendar it should move to the
02:14 - next month as you scroll down as you
02:16 - scroll down you're looking at the
02:18 - feature dates this paragraph is about
02:20 - the padding of the date or the entry
02:22 - field I think I'll take this into
02:24 - consideration I'm not going to read it
02:25 - right now because it doesn't pertain to
02:27 - the list scrolling but thank you so much
02:29 - much for commenting about that because I
02:32 - really value uh everyone's input that's
02:35 - how we're going to make a stronger
02:36 - product and that's part of the Great
02:37 - reason uh to share these Vlogs that I
02:40 - can hear all your input before I
02:41 - actually have to release it so thank you
02:43 - for talking about the padding I will
02:46 - read that and consider that on the log
02:48 - screen the historical entry date should
02:50 - be below the current date so it's almost
02:53 - like uh a log of your account purchases
02:56 - or in a bank statement if you imagine in
02:59 - a bank statement I think the most recent
03:01 - ones are always at the top and as you're
03:04 - scrolling down you're seeing older
03:07 - purchases like on a credit card
03:09 - statement for example so it's the
03:11 - opposite of both elements what you
03:13 - currently
03:14 - have
03:16 - yeah and can how do you design yourself
03:20 - an app icon any any tutorials you know
03:23 - what there are a lot of Cool Tools AI
03:25 - based tools where you can generate app
03:27 - icons I would take a look into that and
03:29 - see what you get it's Hit or Miss but I
03:32 - would take a stab at that just because
03:35 - sometimes you might get a quick
03:36 - win add the ability to log multiple
03:39 - moods per day you can actually do this
03:41 - first thank you code please yeah I don't
03:43 - think I'll be sharing the code for this
03:45 - particular app because we're going to be
03:46 - submitting this but I might show how to
03:50 - do something similar and I am recording
03:52 - a different app series I released a poll
03:54 - recently on the YouTube channel about
03:56 - what type of app you want me to build
03:58 - and do a tutorial series on and a
04:01 - YouTube API app was the winner so I'm
04:04 - going to be I'm building that right now
04:05 - I'm going to be recording that and I'll
04:07 - definitely give you the code for that
04:09 - okay so in conclusion based off of your
04:12 - comments and how I feel I think I'm
04:15 - going to fix the calendar so that as you
04:17 - scroll down you're seeing future months
04:20 - so this would be May 1st and then June
04:22 - 1st and so on and then on the list entry
04:26 - the log um of entries it's going to be
04:29 - the op opposite way so the most recent
04:31 - thing is going to be at the top and then
04:33 - you're going to be scrolling down to see
04:37 - previous dates and that feels the most
04:39 - natural to me at yeah as most of you
04:42 - have touched upon and then you would you
04:45 - wouldn't be able to see future dates
04:47 - this doesn't make sense you shouldn't be
04:48 - able to see entries for future dates or
04:51 - log entries for future dates so now I
04:54 - want to take a look at some of the test
04:56 - flight entries as I mentioned in the
04:59 - previous video right here we're doing
05:01 - internal testing through uh test flight
05:04 - and in case you don't know what that is
05:07 - it's where you distribute your app to uh
05:10 - people and they can beta test your app
05:13 - and they can submit feedback to you and
05:15 - it looks like
05:16 - this so inside App Store connect this is
05:19 - where you managed your app store
05:20 - listings we had a whole bunch of
05:22 - feedback what I've done I've taken all
05:25 - of them except these two because I don't
05:26 - think we're going to work on these two
05:28 - but I've taken all of them
05:30 - and I
05:31 - have gone into our project tracker and I
05:35 - have logged the items in the backlog for
05:37 - us to work on so I want to go through
05:39 - some of these things with you so the
05:41 - good news is that none of these items
05:44 - are really big issues to fix I think
05:47 - they're all very small some mostly
05:50 - cosmetic type of things let's take a
05:53 - look so in dark mode testing when I
05:57 - showed you in the simulator it was only
05:59 - in in light mode or natural mode the
06:02 - default mode but when your phone is on
06:05 - dark mode it uh it makes our titles
06:10 - unreadable this screen is messed up the
06:12 - setting screen here you know the yeah
06:15 - again the titles these pills are really
06:17 - hard to read so this is just a color
06:20 - tweak like I can't even read that text
06:23 - field so that's that apostrophes this is
06:28 - where
06:31 - we have SLS instead of apostrophes all
06:33 - over the app so that needs to be fixed
06:36 - let's see where here one word is that
06:38 - we're using Monday as our project
06:41 - management tool it doesn't really matter
06:43 - what you use to track all of your issues
06:45 - and bugs so this is not a recommendation
06:47 - to use Monday for this sort of stuff
06:50 - filter button does nothing so we're
06:51 - going to remove it that's a phase two
06:53 - type thing calendar direction we talked
06:54 - about this future dates was not to show
06:58 - we don't need to show future dates it
07:00 - doesn't really make sense custom entry
07:01 - error checking so this is a big deal
07:03 - actually so we have the ability for
07:06 - people to enter custom mood custom
07:08 - weather custom anything and I was able
07:11 - to enter like blank text so spaces
07:15 - essentially so we need to do some error
07:17 - checking on
07:18 - that and this button back to today
07:22 - there's supposed to be a green pill
07:23 - right here that's says back today let me
07:26 - see if I can it's not exactly working
07:30 - but sometimes it shows up I don't know
07:32 - when exactly it shows up but there's
07:34 - because you can get lost while scrolling
07:36 - there is a green button here that should
07:38 - take you back to
07:43 - today okay swipe down confirmation so
07:46 - this one was when you're logging your
07:48 - mood we implemented it as a slide up
07:51 - sheet let me see if I can show you so
07:53 - when you click this button it slides up
07:56 - if I'm logging my mood right here like
07:58 - this I've made some sele
08:00 - if I swipe down I lose all my work it's
08:03 - gone so I think we should add a dialogue
08:07 - to capture that event just to ensure
08:10 - that they know they're about to lose
08:12 - their
08:13 - work so this one is about Apple
08:16 - guidelines destructive things should be
08:19 - read save and exit that's not
08:21 - destructive they usually delete discard
08:24 - that's destructive and that should be
08:26 - read so this should not be
08:28 - read don't show scroll bar this is just
08:30 - one thing which popped up there
08:34 - shouldn't be a scroll bar and to
08:36 - implement analytics so we haven't done
08:39 - that we definitely should Implement
08:41 - anal analytics even if it is a first
08:46 - iteration so those that's it it's a
08:49 - pretty small feature set so there
08:51 - weren't too many things to nitpick on I
08:54 - think after this we are ready to submit
08:57 - the app so we're targeting
09:00 - actually I'm still waiting on
09:01 - estimations but I don't think this
09:02 - should take more
09:05 - than hopefully we submit this next week
09:07 - at some point that's my hope so that's
09:10 - where we're at right now again thank you
09:12 - so much if you've been watching and
09:13 - following Along on this journey it's
09:15 - been quite a ride so far but it doesn't
09:17 - stop after we submit this and get it
09:20 - reviewed and publish it because from
09:22 - then on we have to worry about marketing
09:25 - the app and getting users and reading
09:27 - their feedback and things like that and
09:29 - we're continually going to improve the
09:31 - app and in the meantime we're also going
09:34 - to think about the next app idea and
09:35 - work on the next thing stay tuned thanks
09:37 - for watching again and I'll see you in
09:39 - the next vlog
