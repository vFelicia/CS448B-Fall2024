00:00 - hello it's Chris here our video editor Adrian 
is on vacation but guess what I'm not going to  
00:05 - let that stop me from answering the question 
will AI take over our iOS Developer jobs now  
00:11 - to give you some context a couple of weeks ago I 
got a question from a mom asking if AI was going  
00:16 - to make iOS developers obsolete now you see she 
had a son who was interested in programming and  
00:23 - she wanted to watch out for him and his future 
totally makes sense I get it my first instinct  
00:28 - was to reply KN program rers will always be needed 
but I had to stop myself because I mean AI can do  
00:36 - things today that a year ago we didn't think would 
be possible so who's to say that in the future AI  
00:43 - won't be able to write an app an entire app with 
a single prompt and guess what it is kind of  
00:51 - possible right now we'll dive into that a little 
bit more later in this video but right now when I  
00:56 - get back to the story I really had to give some 
thought before I respond responded to this mom  
01:01 - because when I think about it aren't we moving 
towards less and less code writing in recent  
01:07 - years there's more and more no code solutions 
to build websites to build apps and all those  
01:15 - sorts of things even apple is seemingly making 
this transition to no code or less code think  
01:22 - back on the early days of iOS development and 
don't worry if you weren't there because I will  
01:27 - paint this picture for you so we were working 
with The Objective C programming language the  
01:33 - syntax was indecipherable you had to manage 
your own memory which means frequent crashes  
01:40 - with obscure error messages taking hours to figure 
out oh oh and get this if you think excode is bad  
01:46 - right now you weren't there for xcode version 
3 and The Objective C syntax was more verbose  
01:52 - meaning that you had to write a lot of code just 
to achieve something very simple and the keywords  
01:58 - they were obscure they didn't make sense if 
you were missing a dash here or a semicolon  
02:03 - there things would just not work and then we got 
Swift yay developers Rejoice I know I certainly  
02:08 - did because it made my job teaching beginners a 
lot easier Swift took care of a lot of the under  
02:14 - the hood nitty-gritty details you so you didn't 
have to worry about them in the syntax was more  
02:19 - like natural language and the keywords actually 
made sense so that got a lot more people into IOS  
02:25 - app development and then recently we got Swift 
UI with its declarative Syntax for building user  
02:32 - interfaces you tell the system what you want 
it to do in various conditions and states and  
02:37 - it does a sensible job of laying things out you 
no longer have to write code to tell the system  
02:43 - position this button at x39 and Y 100 you know and 
you don't have to manually update the views all of  
02:52 - that happens relatively sensibly and relatively 
well without your intervention and all of this  
02:59 - results in less code needing to be written so even 
with apple we're moving towards less and less code  
03:05 - being written and maybe eventually no code but 
you know what we don't have to guess about what  
03:11 - is going to happen because it's already happened 
in multiple Industries time and time again what do  
03:18 - I mean by that well think about car manufacturing 
plants factories manual labor what happened when  
03:24 - robotics got better well I'll leave that thought 
with you because I want to use an example that's  
03:30 - a little bit closer to home think about web 
development web development has gone through  
03:35 - some form of this transition already because in 
the early days of the internet if you wanted to  
03:40 - build a website you needed to know how to code in 
HTML and then we got tools such as Dreamweaver to  
03:48 - build websites visually and that made setting 
up websites a little more accessible to people  
03:53 - who didn't know HTML but what about those people 
who did know HTML what happened happened to them  
04:00 - well as the tools got better web developers had 
to do less and less of the mundane and repetitive  
04:07 - tasks perhaps to set up the initial frame or 
scaffolding of the website and they could focus  
04:13 - on creating better websites more interactive maybe 
more visually appealing maybe better experiences  
04:20 - or perhaps their time was freed up to build even 
better tools which then feeds into the loop as  
04:26 - tools get better then web developers can focus 
Fus on something else better experiences better  
04:32 - tools and then the loop just keeps going on and 
on and then if you zoom out and take a look at how  
04:38 - websites have evolved take a modern website versus 
a website in the early days of the internet you'll  
04:44 - see a dramatic difference and the same goes for 
iOS apps take a look at early day app store iOS  
04:51 - apps versus the apps of today so let's bring this 
back full circle will AI Place iOS developers my  
04:58 - personal opinion is that no it won't it's just 
going to redefine what an iOS Developer is and  
05:05 - what they do perhaps there's less of an emphasis 
on doing the actual coding and more of an emphasis  
05:13 - on building a better experience or a more complex 
and large product now take for example Vision OS  
05:21 - you know the goggles that Apple introduced not 
to downplay it but you know what I mean can you  
05:27 - imagine building software for that device trying 
to build a spatial experience without any of the  
05:34 - tools that Apple provides or if Apple didn't 
provide you any tools to do that it would be a  
05:39 - pretty big feat I think so it is my belief that 
AI is a tool that will eliminate a lot of that  
05:46 - manual work that iOS developers do and allow us 
to focus on something farther down the workflow  
05:54 - it won't completely eliminate the need for iOS 
developers at all okay but I think there's a  
05:59 - bigger question here all of that stuff I just 
talked about that was future state but what  
06:04 - can you do right now in preparation to ride the 
wave and position yourself to be there to take  
06:11 - advantage when AI really hits the mainstream let's 
talk about that and I think I want to address this  
06:17 - from two different perspective one is from an 
aspiring or current professional iOS Developer  
06:23 - that means you're in the job industry and the 
other perspective is from one of being an indie  
06:30 - app developer where you're publishing apps and 
you're making money from the App Store let's talk  
06:34 - about the job industry first now would you agree 
with me if I said that AI code is cheaper than  
06:40 - human code now don't get me wrong I'm not talking 
about the AI code of today which could be insecure  
06:47 - which could be non-contextual to your environment 
I'm talking about future State AI code where it's  
06:53 - perfected and it is secure and it is contextual 
and exactly what you need in your organization  
06:59 - would that be cheaper than humans writing code and 
I think the answer is yes and do we all agree that  
07:05 - companies are there to make money so I think that 
it makes sense that companies will adopt AI if it  
07:13 - helps them make more money and they can figure out 
what role it plays in their workflow and in their  
07:18 - organization it's just that right now ai is not 
100% there and companies are still figuring out  
07:26 - how to use it without having it blow up in their 
face and costing them tons of dollars and bad PR  
07:32 - and ruined reputation if you are a current 
iOS professional chances are you're probably  
07:38 - already using generative AI in your workflow 
whether or not company policy allows it if I  
07:44 - were still working in Industry I would be really 
really tempted perhaps you use generative AI for  
07:51 - things like writing test cases or documentation or 
even emails or if there's something that I don't  
07:58 - know how to do use Ai and try to build it and 
then read the code and see if I can learn from  
08:03 - it something like that if you're smart about 
it I feel like you would use generative AI as  
08:09 - a draft as a starting point and then you would 
filter that output through your own expertise  
08:15 - rather than fully trusting it generating it and 
submitting it I think you can get into a lot  
08:20 - of trouble like that now if you do a good job of 
using AI in your workflow right now I bet you're  
08:25 - probably pretty productive much more so than your 
peers who are are not using generative AI in their  
08:31 - workflow now just be careful because you might 
be playing with fire if it's not allowed in your  
08:36 - company and you are doing it as an aspiring iOS 
professional I think the decision is a lot more  
08:42 - easy here I if I were you I would keep a pulse 
on the AI industry and how tools are evolving how  
08:48 - good they're getting so that when companies 
do understand how AI plays a role in their  
08:54 - organization you'll be there and uh you'll have 
a leg up against all of the the other candidates  
09:00 - who have not looked at AI at all now let's talk 
about Indie app developers oh boy I think you  
09:05 - guys are on a gold mine let me tell you why if 
you make money from publishing apps I think AI  
09:10 - tools have just supercharged your workflow more 
and more frequently I'm seeing posts like this  
09:16 - pop up on Reddit where someone has released 
full-fledged apps or products generated by  
09:24 - Ai and they're getting users and they're getting 
Revenue but they have no idea how to code and what  
09:30 - any of it does they just generate it and publish 
it Market it the problem is when they hit a snag  
09:36 - such as this they don't know how to fix it because 
they have no technical knowledge but if you are an  
09:42 - indie appdev you do have that knowledge and you 
also have no company policy telling you that you  
09:49 - cannot use AI there are no rules so you could very 
well use AI to generate you apps tweak it modify  
09:58 - it and publish it and that is so much faster than 
building your own apps from scratch Another Thing  
10:05 - content-based apps as a solo developer it's really 
hard to create content-based apps because you need  
10:12 - a lot of content and you probably need a team 
to create all of this content that's where the  
10:17 - value of a content-based app is but with AI do 
I have to connect the dots for you anyways I  
10:26 - think it's a great time to capitalize on the app 
store and I think that as more apps get published  
10:33 - things will get more competitive and you'll have 
to stand out from that the same thing happened in  
10:38 - uh the webdev industry as websites became easier 
and easier to build there was so many tools you  
10:44 - could just set up a website with no knowledge of 
code at all it just became more competitive and  
10:50 - uh websites needed to become better if you wanted 
to stand out from the crowd it needed to provide  
10:55 - a better experience I mean now for me personally 
I'm late to the game I haven't explored AI tools  
11:00 - yet but as we are working on this mood Tracker 
app and it's back on by the way so I'm excited  
11:06 - to share more updates with you going forward but 
as we are continuing to work on this mood Tracker  
11:12 - app I'm very interested in diving into AI tools to 
see how it can improve and speed up that workflow  
11:19 - and I'll definitely share all of my experiences 
and learnings with you through YouTube here so to  
11:24 - wrap it up I want to turn over to you what do you 
personally think AI will do to iOS development do  
11:30 - you agree with me do you disagree with me I 
look forward to reading your thoughts in the  
11:34 - comments below thanks for watching thanks for 
chatting with me I'll see you in the next video
