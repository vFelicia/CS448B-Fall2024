00:00 - hey youtubers what's up it's Chris here
00:03 - and today I'm recording this from my
00:04 - home office now you might be wondering
00:06 - this is not the usual type of video you
00:08 - see on this YouTube channel the reason
00:11 - I'm doing this today is because in the
00:12 - previous video we talked about updating
00:15 - the hearthstone and Magic Hat apps
00:17 - resubmitting them to the App Store
00:18 - building some new apps and try to make
00:20 - money from the App Store and I realized
00:23 - that that sort of app journey that we're
00:24 - about to take together is best
00:27 - documented in this sort of vlogging
00:28 - format and so you're still going to see
00:30 - the tutorials where I show you demos and
00:33 - I'm trying to teach a specific thing but
00:35 - when I'm updating you guys on the
00:37 - progress of the apps update you guys on
00:39 - how much money we're making and that
00:41 - sort of stuff I'm gonna be doing it in
00:43 - this sort of vlogging format so today
00:47 - though we're going to be downloading
00:48 - Xcode 9 beta we're going to be loading
00:51 - up the hearthstone and magic have app
00:53 - apps on the exponent beta and we're
00:57 - gonna see what breaks I do expect a lot
00:59 - to break and you might be wondering also
01:02 - why I haven't gone the beta yet and
01:04 - usually that's because I don't like
01:06 - playing with the Apple beta software I
01:08 - find that sometimes they can be pretty
01:11 - buggy now that you can do standalone you
01:14 - can you know have Xcode eight and nine
01:15 - side by side then it's a lot better but
01:17 - before you had to kind of replace it
01:19 - we're getting close to the point in time
01:21 - where the Xcode 9 beta will become you
01:24 - know officially released so it should be
01:27 - pretty stable at this point and plus now
01:29 - I actually have to use the beta because
01:31 - we need to update the apps and get them
01:34 - out in time for the new app store format
01:37 - and when iOS 11 comes out everyone's
01:40 - gonna be updating their OS and stuff
01:42 - like that so gotta bite the bullet so
01:45 - that's what we're gonna do today we're
01:46 - gonna see what breaks and then possibly
01:50 - fix some depending on what what the time
01:53 - looks like but before we do any of that
01:55 - I just want to give you guys a tour of
01:57 - the office I work in every day because I
02:00 - realized that I haven't done that before
02:02 - and this is my home office this is not
02:04 - the office rental I had last year which
02:06 - I had to give up and that's a story for
02:08 - another time so let's start with what's
02:10 - directly behind me
02:12 - got this backdrop frame which I set up
02:14 - because I was planning to record some
02:16 - more professional-looking videos
02:18 - tutorials and stuff like that but after
02:21 - I set up it's just a frame right now I
02:23 - realized that this room isn't big enough
02:25 - for the frame it's not wide enough so I
02:27 - probably have to move that into the
02:29 - living room downstairs and on this wall
02:32 - I have some audio foam which when I
02:37 - moved into this house last year I had
02:39 - nothing in this room except for my
02:41 - computer and a speaker and when I was
02:43 - recording there were a lot of echoes so
02:46 - I had to find a quick solution I jumped
02:47 - on Amazon and I wanted to get some
02:50 - morning foam I really wanted the
02:51 - professional black-looking audio foam
02:54 - that you see in recording studios but
02:56 - that stuff is expensive so I opted for
02:58 - this kind of gnarly looking pink and
03:02 - gray foam which definitely doesn't look
03:05 - great but it did the job and now at this
03:08 - point I think I can probably take them
03:09 - down because I have furniture and I have
03:12 - carpet and it does a pretty good job of
03:15 - stopping the echoes from happening or
03:18 - maybe I will splurge and get that black
03:20 - foam I don't know it's it's gonna be a
03:22 - toss-up okay so on this wall I've got my
03:27 - iMac that I work on sorry for the shaky
03:30 - camera I still trying to get used to
03:31 - this vlogging type of thing and this I
03:35 - bought recently it's a sit stand desktop
03:38 - riser so I can adjust it in two sitting
03:41 - position I can lower it all the way down
03:42 - there and sit and work or I can kind of
03:45 - raise it to the standing level and I
03:48 - found out that that's really helped me
03:50 - because after lunch when I eat pretty
03:53 - heavy meal pretty sluggish and I find
03:55 - that standing up and working really
03:57 - helps get my circulation going and I
03:59 - don't feel as tired and from sitting
04:02 - half the day standing actually feels
04:04 - pretty good you'd think that standing
04:06 - would be tiring but after sitting and
04:07 - then you starts to stand it kind of I
04:10 - guess gets your blood flowing and it
04:12 - feels pretty good actually so I didn't
04:15 - want to buy an entirely new desk so
04:17 - that's why I got this and it was a
04:19 - fraction of the price that a brand-new
04:22 - adjustable desk would cost so
04:25 - that's what I did and whatever we got
04:28 - here on this side of the wall
04:30 - we've got more audio foam and some more
04:33 - desk furniture and that's pretty much it
04:35 - as you can see it's not a very big room
04:37 - and there's a closet on this side but
04:40 - that closet doesn't even contain my
04:42 - stuff it contains my wife's clothing
04:44 - it's like an extra storage closet for
04:47 - her so as you can see this room is
04:50 - pretty small but it works so far it does
04:53 - get pretty hot but hey you know I'm not
04:55 - complaining I'm not paying you know
04:56 - seven eight hundred dollars a month for
04:59 - the office that I was renting anyways
05:02 - we're gonna get started we're gonna get
05:03 - Xcode 9 beta and then we're going to get
05:05 - those absolute it up
05:07 - [Music]
05:22 - hey guys before we launch Xcode 9 and
05:25 - open up our apps there's just one thing
05:27 - I want to mention and it's a little bit
05:29 - of a pet peeve because I've been getting
05:30 - a lot of beginners asking me should they
05:33 - start with Swift 4 or should they start
05:35 - with Swift 3 should they use exco 9 or
05:37 - Xcode 8 now that's a very valid question
05:40 - because the thing is when you google
05:43 - Xcode to download it you're going to
05:45 - find you're gonna be brought to this
05:48 - page you're gonna be brought to a page
05:50 - like this posts going to say what's
05:53 - Nealon Xcode 9 and you're then going to
05:56 - log in and up here Xcode 9 beta 6 is
06:00 - listed first before the stable releases
06:03 - down here where is it right here
06:06 - Xcode 8 point 3 3 and then when you go
06:10 - into the Mac App Store and you want to
06:14 - look for Xcode to download
06:16 - it's going to list Xcode 8 so there's a
06:19 - lot of confusion around there and on
06:21 - this page I feel like they should be
06:23 - listing Xcode 8 first because you want
06:26 - to be you want people to be using the
06:28 - staple software first or an but
06:29 - obviously Apple has their own agenda
06:31 - they want people to you know adopt the
06:34 - latest so in my opinion I feel like
06:37 - Xcode 8 should be listed first on this
06:39 - page as to not confuse beginners who are
06:41 - trying to download Xcode to learn and
06:43 - plus there's not a lot of support out
06:44 - there right now for Xcode 9 and Swift
06:48 - for because it's so new right it's still
06:50 - beta software so if you're a beginner
06:53 - and you want to start developing and
06:56 - learning Swift download Xcode 8.33
06:59 - that's the latest version of Xcode 8 and
07:02 - you're going to be using Swift 3 but
07:04 - when Xcode Knight comes out officially
07:06 - you're gonna update and get that and as
07:09 - a beginner most of the changes in Swift
07:13 - 4 you're not really going to see because
07:15 - you're going to be going through stuff
07:17 - like you know objects you're going to be
07:19 - learning about classes and variables and
07:21 - properties and stuff
07:22 - and that stuff is is just gonna be
07:24 - remain constant now in a couple of
07:27 - videos maybe next week or the following
07:28 - week I'm going to list out the changes
07:31 - for you in Mexico 9 versus Xcode 8 and
07:33 - the changes between X to a foreign sorry
07:36 - Swift for and Swift 3 so watch out for
07:39 - those so for now let's go back to Xcode
07:43 - 9 beta and open up our projects alright
07:46 - so here we are
07:47 - let us try to open let's say the
07:51 - hearthstone YouTube app first in Xcode 9
07:58 - alright let's see what happens
08:02 - super outdated somewhat okay okay hope
08:10 - unjust stuff
08:13 - Wow I don't have a lot of faith that
08:17 - this is actually going to run so let's
08:20 - see what's this built with objective-c
08:23 - man it's been so long I don't even
08:26 - remember yeah and it looks like it was
08:29 - see this is how long ago this was
08:32 - actually here's the date 2014 March 20th
08:37 - Wow okay definitely I'm not going to be
08:40 - able to update this up here in this
08:43 - video I didn't even remember that this
08:48 - was built with objective-c it's been
08:50 - that long it's been over three years
08:53 - okay anyways let's run it looks like
08:57 - it's going to be a little more work than
08:59 - I anticipated but that's fine build
09:01 - failed all right looks like I'm gonna
09:08 - have to update some libraries anyways
09:10 - I'm not going to do this here we haven't
09:13 - even gotten to yeah the majority of the
09:18 - errors I'm sure after I update this
09:19 - library and get rid of this error we're
09:21 - gonna have a whole ton of other errors
09:23 - okay let me just close that and we are
09:26 - going to try to open the magic hatton
09:28 - one let's see what happens this one's a
09:32 - little more well organized this one
09:36 - wasn't Swift see unsupported Swift
09:38 - version migrated oh I have to use Xcode
09:44 - eight first to migrate the code to Swift
09:47 - three is that what it's saying I'm just
09:52 - gonna run it anyways boom failed
09:57 - yeah let us just try changing the target
10:00 - here deployment target 11 so you sent to
10:19 - sort it okay I need to go into the build
10:22 - settings
10:33 - always fun updating your apps Swift
10:38 - language version let's say Swift for
10:42 - maybe Swift 3 for now
10:52 - compiling I might actually have to 463
10:58 - errors amazing but you know why it there
11:04 - are so many errors is because there's
11:05 - quite a bit of generated code here so I
11:08 - don't know if I mentioned but all of the
11:11 - animations in this app were done by
11:14 - something called Core animator so let me
11:17 - see if I can just pull it up right now
11:19 - [Music]
11:21 - Core animator this guy so ray and I used
11:30 - this core animator to basically do the
11:35 - animation so ray did the artwork he did
11:37 - it in Illustrator I believe and each
11:41 - section of the animal was cut out in
11:43 - little pieces and this one allowed us to
11:45 - do the the animations for each of the
11:48 - like the arms and the legs independent
11:50 - of the body and and really he built
11:52 - those animations from the ground up from
11:54 - scratch and then you can export those
11:59 - animations as a UI view and it would be
12:02 - we would have methods it would generate
12:05 - these methods to run specific animations
12:07 - so that's how we did that and as you can
12:10 - see fuse
12:13 - where was it as it under helpers or was
12:15 - it under libraries no we had core and
12:21 - we're here it is so for example for a
12:24 - lion there was a lion view dot swift and
12:29 - this guy would you know it's actually a
12:32 - ton of code and we didn't write any of
12:33 - this this was generated from core
12:35 - animator alright and then here are the
12:38 - images so as you can see here's an a
12:40 - lion arm lower arm upper arm body this
12:45 - is a cheek there's the eyes it doesn't
12:48 - look like much like this but when you
12:51 - put it together you know it will
12:53 - actually look like the lion in the app
12:56 - there's the mouth so you can see how
12:59 - many different pieces there were so
13:01 - obviously the generated code is not up
13:04 - to
13:05 - with Swift three or four because this
13:07 - was done a while back so it was Swift
13:09 - too and so that's why there are so many
13:11 - errors because I will probably have to
13:13 - go into Lyon view here and some of the
13:19 - syntax you know like this for example
13:22 - capital C Center has been renamed to
13:24 - lowercase C Center this is one of the
13:27 - changes they did in Swift three like
13:29 - that so that fixes that error but there
13:32 - is a ton of those errors in all of these
13:33 - different files and what I could do is
13:36 - probably if Ray has the original core
13:40 - animator files I could probably just run
13:44 - it through do the export again and Core
13:46 - animator will hopefully spit out you
13:49 - know Swift 3 compatible versions or
13:51 - maybe even Swift 4 but I highly doubt it
13:54 - at this point and or I would be
13:58 - surprised that they did pleasantly
13:59 - surprised if they did that so I could do
14:03 - that and that would probably get rid of
14:08 - a lot of the errors or I can just do a
14:10 - mass search and replace because a lot of
14:12 - these are pretty self-explanatory for
14:15 - example this capital essence that is now
14:17 - a lowercase s and in Swift 3 they they
14:20 - did a lot of these changes just for
14:22 - consistency because they started
14:25 - following where all of these decent
14:29 - enums were following this sort of
14:32 - camelcase
14:33 - and so they fixed up a lot of those
14:36 - those little things so a lot of these
14:40 - errors this 591 errors they're not very
14:43 - serious ones ok so I guess we we won't
14:49 - really be able to get this done in this
14:51 - video so I'm gonna take this away and
14:53 - I'm going to work on this get it all
14:56 - fixed up and then the next time we talk
14:59 - we'll be able to look at the the
15:02 - finished product so alright at least now
15:04 - we know what we're dealing with alright
15:07 - so before I get to work on those
15:08 - projects there's one question I want to
15:10 - ask you guys so today I give you a tour
15:13 - of my little home office now based on
15:16 - what you saw I want to ask you
15:19 - do you think I cleaned up this room in
15:22 - order to shoot this vlog for you guys so
15:25 - I did a comment in the comment section
15:28 - below and either put yes or no whether
15:31 - or not you think I cleaned up I'm going
15:33 - to show you guys one more time what this
15:35 - office looks like and then you can tell
15:37 - me if you think I'm a messy person or
15:40 - I'm generally disorganized so take a
15:44 - look here's the desk alright so let me
15:58 - know what you guys think and I'll see
16:00 - you guys in the next vlog see you later
16:02 - right
