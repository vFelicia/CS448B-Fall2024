00:01 - [Music]
00:04 - hello and welcome to the code with Chris
00:06 - Q&A where I take a couple of minutes to
00:08 - answer questions that you guys have
00:11 - today I have a question that I get a lot
00:14 - as well um I'm trying to cover all of
00:17 - the questions which I get most of the
00:19 - time first uh this one I get a lot from
00:22 - beginners who before they've started
00:25 - learning they want to know how much time
00:27 - they're going to have to invest into
00:29 - learning I programming before they can
00:31 - build their own
00:33 - apps so the question that I get is
00:35 - usually phrased like this how long will
00:38 - it take me to learn iOS programming now
00:41 - this is a really hard question to answer
00:43 - because obviously it depends on how much
00:46 - time you have to dedicate to it um but I
00:49 - can give you a general idea of the
00:51 - learning curve and what that's like from
00:53 - what I've observed uh with my own
00:56 - students so usually for someone with no
00:59 - programming experience uh they're very
01:02 - quickly able to build some simple apps
01:06 - basically understand um some simple
01:09 - logic um construct some simple user
01:12 - interfaces and get an app working in
01:15 - xcode in their simulator and I think
01:18 - that is a very very good first step
01:20 - because it it gives students a sense of
01:23 - accomplishment and usually this can be
01:25 - done in maybe one or two sessions by
01:28 - sessions I mean maybe one or two hours
01:30 - so maybe in total two sessions would be
01:33 - two to four hours that you could build
01:35 - your very first demo maybe even quicker
01:37 - than that depending on how easy it is
01:39 - but um after that point I think it gives
01:42 - you that initial Rush that you know you
01:45 - can do this uh and it will prompt you to
01:50 - dig deeper into it and for a lot of
01:52 - people what usually happens is that
01:54 - after creating that demo uh and they dig
01:57 - deeper into it they start to hit a
01:59 - little bit of frustration and the reason
02:01 - for that is because the initial demo
02:04 - usually is a very easy kind of like
02:06 - follow what I do type of thing click
02:08 - here click there um just so you can you
02:11 - know help the students get their feet
02:13 - wet and get them excited um but then
02:15 - following that when you actually have to
02:17 - learn mechanics and concepts of the
02:20 - programming language and um you know
02:22 - different programming design patterns
02:24 - and stuff like that it starts getting
02:26 - into territory where um you know it's
02:29 - foundational knowledge that you need to
02:30 - know but it might not be you know the
02:32 - funnest thing to learn so in my courses
02:34 - that I offer on my site I try to
02:36 - incorporate these Concepts um into
02:39 - building a slightly more complex app um
02:42 - just so it's not as dry so it's not like
02:44 - you're you know you're reading a
02:45 - textbook or something like that uh so
02:48 - that seems to work well um and then also
02:52 - after that initial demo app you're
02:53 - you're starting to build slightly more
02:56 - complicated apps and even with the most
02:58 - seasoned programmers you're going to
03:00 - have bugs uh and bugs are basically um
03:04 - either logic that you coded incorrectly
03:08 - or maybe it was even incorrect logic to
03:10 - begin with so you start running into
03:12 - errors in your app uh and then you're
03:15 - going to have to figure out how to solve
03:16 - them so there's a little bit of problem
03:18 - solving and there's a little bit of
03:20 - debugging which is just the process of
03:22 - finding the source of those errors and
03:24 - resolving them so there's a little bit
03:26 - of
03:27 - that which some people may not find um
03:31 - you know as fun so at this point some
03:34 - people give up because it turns out that
03:36 - learning programming is harder than they
03:38 - thought or more time intensive than they
03:40 - thought uh so I always caution it's
03:43 - really important to have the appropriate
03:45 - mindset expectations and goals when you
03:48 - learn iOS programming you know you're
03:50 - learning a skill and you want to come
03:52 - out knowing that skill if you just want
03:55 - kind of the end result and you don't
03:56 - really care about learning programming
03:58 - at all then maybe you should consider
04:00 - buying app templates or hiring someone
04:02 - to build the app which you know you
04:04 - might find more success with so anyways
04:08 - you're learning the programming language
04:09 - at this point um it's getting a little
04:11 - bit frustrating but then once you kind
04:14 - of get through this hump it's what I
04:16 - call the hump once you get past this
04:19 - semi difficult part um your world kind
04:22 - of opens up because uh once you
04:24 - understand it and it clicks then you're
04:26 - just Off to the Races and you can you
04:29 - know what whatever you want to do in
04:31 - your app there's probably a tutorial out
04:33 - there for it and whereas before you
04:35 - couldn't understand that tutorial
04:37 - because you didn't have that
04:38 - foundational knowledge uh you couldn't
04:41 - read code and you didn't understand the
04:43 - concepts but now you do so all of these
04:46 - tutorials and possibilities are open to
04:48 - you and kind of the sky the limit at
04:51 - this point uh so for a a lot of people
04:53 - once they make it past that hump they
04:55 - discover the joy of building apps and
04:58 - and programming so that's kind of of the
04:59 - learning curve um how fast you go
05:01 - through it will depend on you know
05:03 - whether you dedicate a couple of hours a
05:05 - day or maybe a couple of hours every
05:07 - couple of days or something like that
05:09 - and it'll depend on you know how fast it
05:12 - clicks for you because programming is is
05:15 - very logic based um so if you're not
05:18 - used to that kind of thinking then it
05:20 - may take some people longer for some
05:21 - people it may take faster but the one
05:24 - thing I advocate is that don't just read
05:28 - or watch videos you have have to have to
05:30 - have to practice and and that means you
05:33 - need a Mac and that means you need xcode
05:35 - or maybe some of the other um Solutions
05:39 - which I outlined in another Q&A video
05:40 - for the
05:42 - PC but you have to practice and because
05:46 - I found that by practicing that is
05:49 - actually the fastest way to learn uh for
05:51 - me when I first started learning I just
05:54 - read the book cover to cover and when I
05:56 - wanted to start I didn't know how to
05:58 - start I realized that I understood all
06:00 - the material while I read it but I
06:01 - didn't understand how to apply it so
06:04 - when you're reading that tutorial you're
06:05 - watching that lesson it's important to
06:08 - stop um and then try it out for yourself
06:12 - and you're going to encounter problems
06:14 - uh but part of it is that after you
06:17 - figure out you know how to overcome that
06:19 - problem it it almost becomes a memory in
06:22 - your head and uh helps you remember the
06:26 - concepts and what you're learning a lot
06:28 - faster than
06:30 - if you had just read it or watched it so
06:32 - what I usually do when people ask me
06:34 - this question just to summarize is that
06:37 - I take the amount of video in my course
06:40 - which is about 27 hours and then I just
06:42 - tack on about an hour and a half for
06:46 - every hour of video so I usually say
06:49 - something like dedicate 60 hours UH 60
06:52 - to 75 hours to the course and how fast
06:56 - you get through that course will depend
06:57 - on how much time you spend on it dayto
06:59 - dat uh and after finishing that course
07:02 - you will be able to build your own
07:03 - simple apps and put together you'll be
07:05 - able to read and write code put together
07:06 - user interfaces make multiple screen
07:09 - apps and stuff like that but then if you
07:12 - want to learn the more slightly advanced
07:15 - stuff where you're working with
07:16 - databases and web services and you know
07:18 - you're transferring data or saving
07:19 - photos to a database sitting in some
07:22 - server like that is the next step then
07:25 - you have to dedicate more time to
07:27 - learning that stuff uh if you just want
07:29 - to count you know getting down the
07:30 - basics you're able to build your simple
07:33 - basic apps then I'd say you know to get
07:36 - through my course at least this about 75
07:38 - hours so I hope that answers your
07:40 - question and I hope you guys enjoyed it
07:42 - and will join me for the next Q&A now if
07:45 - you found this helpful I would really
07:47 - appreciate it if you followed subscribed
07:50 - liked and rate uh and share it with your
07:52 - friends and colleagues thank you so much
07:54 - and I'll see you guys next time bye for
