00:00 - hello and welcome back happy New Year yes this 
project is alive I was able to overcome my lack  
00:05 - of motivation and my mental roadblocks and we've 
started our first development Sprint I'll share  
00:11 - all the details with you in this Vlog now just in 
case you're new here this series is an unscripted  
00:16 - and raw video format where I share our team's 
journey in building apps for profit and this  
00:21 - entry is dated January 8th 2024 with that being 
said I hope you enjoy this Vlog hi welcome back  
00:28 - it's Chris here and it's time for another Vlog I 
am ashamed to say that it's been 2 months since  
00:34 - the last one and we have not made any progress 
since then I'm shooting this Vlog because we  
00:42 - are starting to make progress and I do have some 
updates to share but before I share those updates  
00:47 - and how things are going now I do want to talk 
about why there was a two-month Hiatus what was  
00:53 - going through my head and what I've learned from 
that because potentially this was a appending  
01:01 - Hiatus I think in the past I would have just 
abandoned the project and I would have moved  
01:07 - on and started something else so here's what was 
going through my head in full transparency mode  
01:14 - this being a vlog I do want to share my thoughts 
and emotions so that I could look back on it so  
01:20 - that you could learn from it as well or at least 
see what could potentially happen someone else  
01:26 - so I think I was scared that's why I didn't 
prior prz this that's why I didn't work on it  
01:32 - started thinking about I I stopped believing in 
the idea and so back in M Vlog one or two I was  
01:42 - like I I need I know myself I need to carry 
through that momentum I need to launch this  
01:47 - quickly I need to get this out the door because 
the longer it takes the less of that motivation  
01:53 - that I have and that's a personal problem that's 
just my own issues in the way that I am but I  
02:02 - realized I started reflecting about why I lost 
belief in this I think as time goes on and and  
02:10 - you're spending time working on something there's 
always doubt right doubt starts to creep in and  
02:16 - there's this nagging voice telling you this is 
not going to work you're going to waste all your  
02:20 - time it's going to be embarrassing um you might 
not be able to do this blah blah blah blah blah  
02:27 - so that combined with the fact that I do have 
other urgent work to do for the business like  
02:33 - recording more content and the courses that we're 
working on and stuff it made it such an easy thing  
02:38 - for me to just put this on the back burner just 
always put this at the bottom of the to-do list  
02:43 - especially because I was not happy with some of 
the data entry points here and I wasn't sure how  
02:50 - to go about it so I knew that I couldn't move 
on unless I figured out this data entry part  
02:57 - and so it was very easy for me to to say oh I'm 
going to think about it when I have a big block  
03:02 - of uninterrupted time that's when I'm going to sit 
down and think about it but obviously that's just  
03:06 - an excuse that you tell yourself or that I told 
myself rather so here we are 2 months later and  
03:13 - we have restarted so there is progress on this 
I have not dropped this app let's let me explain  
03:18 - to you now how I mentally got back on track I 
realized that the pressure that I was putting  
03:24 - on myself was because I was expecting results 
I had dreams on making money with apps I wanted  
03:32 - to build this is the first of many type of thing 
and that sort of pressure I think actually held me  
03:38 - back what helped move me forward was the thought 
that I need more practice I need to release more  
03:45 - apps so I can get more practice and this first app 
is not going to to be anything so I disconnected  
03:54 - results from the actions and this actually made me 
feel a lot better to to make progress and to move  
04:00 - forward on it because whatever happens my goal 
now is to launch the app my goal is not to try to  
04:09 - make as much money as I can through the app and 
that would be a happy byproduct and maybe we'll  
04:14 - eventually get there if we iterate on it and we 
find a segment of the market but if that doesn't  
04:20 - happen I will work on another app if I maintain 
that attitude that this is just practice it takes  
04:28 - the pressure off the other thing is that instead 
of trying to tell myself okay we're blocked on  
04:34 - this I need to figure this user experience out 
I'm not happy with this user experience I was  
04:39 - like you know what I'm just going to cut it out 
for this first launch I'm going to make it even  
04:44 - simpler I basically said for this first iteration 
we're going to have little bit of onboarding just  
04:53 - basic entry right here and a calendar view so 
you can review your results will that set us  
05:00 - apart from the Apple app probably not but you know 
what it'll be a win in my book if I actually get  
05:09 - this launched because it is practice so even if 
it doesn't do well I would have gained something  
05:15 - I would have gained the experience of launching it 
I would have learned a lot from having people use  
05:20 - it in the store and getting some sort of feedback 
or perhaps getting no traction and no downloads  
05:26 - either way whatever happens I learn something just 
by going through the process and telling myself  
05:33 - that this is practice and simplifying it even more 
so that I can move forward allows me to continue  
05:40 - on with this journey okay so that's where we're 
at let me tell you what sort of progress we've  
05:45 - made as a team because this was a team thing we 
have JC doing the design we have joash and nyaki  
05:50 - working on the code and me driving the direction 
of the project so we decided to work on this in  
05:57 - Sprints here first of all I had to come up with 
the vision of what this MVP was and as I told  
06:03 - you I simplified it even more to basically just 
onboarding data entry not even custom moods just  
06:12 - select a mood type of thing uh being able to look 
at a calendar view and be able to scroll through  
06:18 - your daily boots like that and so they took those 
requirements and they broke it down into all of  
06:24 - these different areas and we call this the backlog 
so these are all the things that we need to do to  
06:29 - get it to that state and launch it and then we're 
going to work in two we Sprints we estimated  
06:35 - effort on each of these tasks and these are what 
are called story points so each of these is a  
06:41 - story and story points represent effort but it's 
not a linear effort it's not like this is one day  
06:47 - this is two days this is 5 days and this is 8 days 
so it's something like one is low effort two is  
06:53 - more effort like maybe three days of effort five 
would be like a whole week and I think eight would  
06:59 - be the whole week and five would be multiple days 
or something like that yeah it's basically not a  
07:03 - linear progression in terms of the effort each 
developer commits to a certain number of points  
07:11 - per Sprint because inaki and joash have other 
tasks at CWC um not just working on this app I  
07:19 - think we said we would do te points per Sprint for 
each developer hence we selected different tasks  
07:28 - here so that each person would have about 13 to 
16 points and this Sprint Ends by the end of this  
07:35 - week actually so then we're going to have a demo 
and then we're going to review how the Sprint went  
07:40 - and then we're going to do the second Sprint where 
we are going to select more tasks So based on this  
07:45 - we are estimating that we can launch this app by 
I think it was mid Feb that's our Target right now  
07:52 - so that's what's going on the development front on 
the design front I've told JC that I'm not super  
07:58 - stoked about the design Direction and so I I have 
a few ideas of how to change this it's been flux  
08:07 - so I don't have anything to share there yet but 
this design will be changing and it's yeah I guess  
08:14 - it's not the traditional way that you would do it 
you would typically lock down the design first but  
08:20 - because this app is pretty simple I think we can 
make that change we can be a little more agile  
08:27 - yeah so that's where we're at right now I hope 
we continue to make regular progress and I'll  
08:31 - share those updates with you I've realized that 
building apps is not just a matter of having the  
08:36 - right skills but it's also a big emotional and 
mental part of it especially if you are trying  
08:44 - to get specific results from your apps all right 
thanks for watching I'll talk to you next time
