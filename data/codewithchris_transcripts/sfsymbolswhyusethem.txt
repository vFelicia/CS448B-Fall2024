00:00 - hello and welcome in this lesson we're going to 
talk about SF symbols a large collection of system  
00:05 - icons that you can use in your iOS 13 apps not 
only are they very handy they also come with a  
00:12 - lot of additional benefits which I'll demonstrate 
for you in this video all right stay tuned hey  
00:23 - there my name is Chris and if this is your first 
time here welcome to code with Chris where we'll  
00:27 - teach you how to build an app even if you've never 
coded before before we dive into SF symbols I've  
00:32 - got a quick question for you do you use any sort 
of icon package or service for the icons that you  
00:37 - use in your app or maybe you design your own 
let me know by leaving a quick comment below  
00:42 - and on your way down there if you wouldn't mind 
it please give this video a quick like I really  
00:46 - appreciate it alright with that said let's dive 
right in so here I have a basic Swift UI Xcode  
00:53 - project and all I have is an H stack with an image 
and text element inside of it the text says like  
01:00 - and the image is one of a heart now keep in mind 
that I don't actually have an image asset of a  
01:07 - heart in my asset library in this project instead 
I'm using the SF symbols icon framework which I  
01:14 - alluded to in the previous lesson so let's take a 
look at the Apple human interface guidelines I'm  
01:20 - just going to pull that up right here and take 
a look at what exactly are these symbols so SF  
01:25 - symbols are a set of 1500 icons and symbols that 
you can use in your iOS 13 apps now Apple designed  
01:34 - these symbols to play really nicely with the San 
Francisco system font if you're unfamiliar with  
01:40 - what this font is it's essentially the default 
font that you use in your app so if you're not  
01:45 - using any sort of custom font then you are using 
the San Francisco font and as you can see using  
01:51 - an SF symbol alongside that font looks really neat 
and tidy everything's aligned and arranged nicely  
01:57 - whereas if you had supplied your own heart image 
you might have to play around with the sizing and  
02:03 - alignment just to get it to look in line with the 
text so the other thing that is a huge benefit to  
02:11 - using SF symbols is that it caves like a font as 
you can see here for each of these symbols there  
02:18 - are different weights like ultra light thin light 
regular all the way to black there's different  
02:23 - like line thicknesses and sizes as well and these 
symbols are vector based which means that no  
02:30 - matter how large or small you scale them they're 
going to be really sharp and the fidelity is going  
02:36 - to be consistent just like the font so let me go 
back into Xcode and demonstrate for you so you  
02:42 - can visibly see some of those benefits that I'm 
talking about so for example if I want to change  
02:48 - the the font that I have and I want to add a font 
modifier maybe I want to do a large title type of  
02:55 - font as you can see it changes the text element as 
I expected but it also changed that image element  
03:02 - that SF symbol had I used my own supplied image 
graphic that wouldn't have done anything this  
03:10 - modifier I mean or let's say I want red font red 
text if I change the foreground color to red that  
03:20 - affects my SF symbol as well so that's really 
nice and then for my next demonstration let me  
03:27 - just remove this red color because I mean you're 
going to be able to see a lot more clearly and  
03:33 - then I'm going to run this app in the simulator 
I'm going to just bring that over here and I'm  
03:41 - not sure if you knew about this in Xcode 11 but 
there is a menu that you can bring up by clicking  
03:47 - this button called environment overrides and this 
allows you to test your UI and test your app under  
03:54 - different device specific conditions so things 
like whether or not the user is using dark mode or  
04:00 - light mode what kind of dynamic type magnification 
are they using maybe they can't see the text very  
04:08 - well so they have upped the magnification or the 
font size and also these different accessibility  
04:14 - options you can see how your app plays nicely or 
not so nicely with them turned on so why don't we  
04:21 - go ahead and try to turn on dark mode oops there 
we go now as you can see the text element changed  
04:29 - to white because obviously black text on a dark 
mode you wouldn't be able to read it but what I  
04:34 - didn't expect was that the SF symbol also turned 
light if you were to use your own supplied image  
04:42 - or graphic asset you would have had to supply to 
one for the light mode and one for dark mode and  
04:47 - then there's a way for you to configure it inside 
the asset library to tell the system which version  
04:53 - to use for dark mode and which version to use 
for light mode but if you're using an SF symbol  
04:59 - as we're using here you don't have to specify any 
of that because it behaves like a font so you kind  
05:04 - of get this for free which is really nice the next 
thing is that you have dynamic type so some people  
05:11 - might have this huge magnification on to make sure 
that they can read the text your SF symbol scales  
05:17 - with that so you can see that with an image not so 
much and then same thing with these accessibility  
05:25 - options anything that you would expect to happen 
to your font you know your symbol will also play  
05:30 - nicely with that so that is awesome and there 
are 1500 of these symbols for you to use and  
05:36 - if that weren't enough Apple has said that you 
can actually export these symbols and customize  
05:43 - them to your own so let me show you where we can 
browse these symbols and how you can export one to  
05:49 - configure it or to modify it to your needs into 
your liking so here is a link to the SF symbols  
05:56 - app I've got it open right here actually it's a 
Mac OS app which allows you to browse all of the  
06:03 - different symbols that are available in this 
framework and you can also choose the waiting  
06:10 - and stuff like that and it's it's a nice way to 
browse all of the icons essentially and the way  
06:15 - you use them is you take note of this name and 
all you have to do is specify this name let's  
06:21 - say this one Mike dot circle dot fill and use the 
system name initializer for the image element and  
06:28 - just pass that in what was that again Mike dot 
circle dot fill and let's take a look at that
06:39 - all right so there you go that's how easy it is 
to use if you wanted to export one of these icons  
06:46 - and use them as a template to build off of you 
can also do that so just highlight the one that  
06:52 - you want let's say Mike go up to edit sorry file 
and export custom symbol template the shortcut key  
06:59 - is command e so when you do that it's going to 
produce an SVG file for you which is a standard  
07:06 - vector-based graphics file then you can save 
it somewhere and you can import that into your  
07:13 - favorite vector-based graphics software such as 
Adobe Illustrator or sketch or what I like to use  
07:20 - figma because it's free to use and get started 
with so that's what I'm going to show you here  
07:25 - I have figma open I'm just going to drag and drop 
that Mike SVG file into here and then you can see  
07:33 - all of the different weights so it might be hard 
to read for you here there's thin all the way  
07:40 - light regular mediums semi bold bold and then 
there's different sizes as well here and then  
07:47 - down here in the lower left hand corner there are 
some instructions and some some guides and that's  
07:58 - how you can customize these well this is granted 
if you know how to work with vectors and to edit  
08:05 - vectors right so that is another learning curve 
but for let's say a designer that knows how to  
08:11 - create their own icons and modify vectors then 
this would be great for them now there are a  
08:19 - set of icons that Apple has said you should 
not touch and you should use as is so if we  
08:25 - go back to the human interface guidelines and 
you scroll down these symbols are for use as  
08:30 - is and these symbols mostly have to do with Apple 
brands so they are they don't want you to tamper  
08:38 - with brand logos or brand iconography which is 
understandable so you have things like airplay  
08:44 - AR KITT iCloud FaceTime face ID stuff like that 
for these symbols you want to use them as they  
08:52 - are for anything else it's fair game for you to 
export modify customize to your liking and use  
08:59 - now before we I'm out this video there are 
a couple of resources I do want to mention  
09:03 - that might make your life easier so this one is 
called SF symbols calm it's not by Apple it's  
09:11 - made by a developer named Noah and it's a very 
easy way for you to find an icon that you need  
09:18 - in case you don't have the Mac app installed and 
let me just show you how that works so let's say  
09:23 - I'm searching for that that looks like or sounds 
like the one that I need copy it and then simply  
09:33 - paste it in here and just like that very easy 
so this is very handy there's another article  
09:42 - from a van early on SF symbols that helped me 
out when I was learning this and this is very  
09:48 - handy to go through if you'd like to do that so 
yeah I would highly recommend that you use SF  
09:54 - symbols where you can especially for places like 
beside button text or in buttons in menu buttons  
10:01 - even in tab bars those are all great places 
to use sf symbols but keep in mind that the  
10:08 - use of SS symbols there are some restrictions 
and maybe I should have mentioned this up front  
10:13 - but it says here that you can't use SF symbols 
in your app icons logos or any other trademark  
10:23 - related use however I think using them inside of 
your app is fair game so in this lesson you learn  
10:31 - all about SF symbols and how you can incorporate 
them into your app in the next lesson we're going  
10:36 - to start building our first swift UI app together
