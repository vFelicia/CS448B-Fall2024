00:00 - hey guys it's Chris here and today I'm going 
to give you my opinion on the question can you  
00:05 - make money with apps and I stress the word opinion 
because that's exactly what it is everyone's going  
00:10 - to have a different perspective on this based on 
their own experiences so this is my take on the  
00:16 - question so now on to the question can you make 
money with apps and my answer is yes Apple said  
00:22 - earlier this year that developers made twenty 
billion dollars in 2016 in absolu that's twenty  
00:31 - billion dollars so why aren't we all rich well 
if you scroll through the top grossing apps on  
00:37 - the App Store you'll notice that all the apps are 
produced by companies or game studios or at least  
00:42 - most of them are so if you're asking this question 
from the perspective of a company or games video I  
00:48 - would say yes but unfortunately most of the time 
I'm being asked this question by a beginner who  
00:54 - has no programming experience and they're trying 
to see if they should invest the effort to learn  
00:59 - how to build apps in order to turn a profit on 
the App Store and unfortunately many of these  
01:04 - people let's just say that they're not in the best 
financial situation and they're looking at this  
01:10 - as an opportunity to maybe turn their fortunes 
around now unfortunately I have to be realistic  
01:16 - with them and a lot of the time it comes as 
disappointing news or kind of the cold hard  
01:22 - truth if you know what I'm saying if you're asking 
from that perspective where you're a beginner and  
01:29 - you're trying to build apps to make money on the 
App Store I would still say yes but you know there  
01:35 - there are certain hurdles you're going to have to 
pass and it's going to take a lot of time so there  
01:40 - are independent developers who do very well on 
the App Store also known as indie devs but that's  
01:45 - definitely the exception and not the norm these 
indie developers have the programming part down  
01:52 - pat they're not worried about whether or not they 
can build this app what they're worried about and  
01:58 - what they're trying to figure out is how to get 
exposure on the App Store maybe get featured on  
02:03 - the front page by Apple or maybe rank highly 
for certain keywords in the App Store or maybe  
02:09 - get impressed their app or getting their app for 
game reviewed by review sites and review favorably  
02:15 - and coming up with a business or a marketing 
plan for their app you'll notice that all of  
02:20 - these things have nothing to do with programming 
right just because the App Store is so saturated  
02:26 - with apps the idea is that if you can do some 
good marketing for your app and if your app is  
02:33 - decent and it's got the right cooks to keep people 
coming back that your app will build up momentum  
02:38 - like a snowball and your app will continue 
getting downloads through word-of-mouth or  
02:44 - being viral so you can see as a beginner who has 
no programming experience you know what they must  
02:50 - overcome me first of all you have to learn to code 
and then you have to keep building apps until you  
02:55 - get good at it right because your first few apps 
or maybe your first 1020 apps aren't going to be  
03:00 - very good and you're going to have to keep at it 
and you're going to have to have that persistence  
03:04 - because you're going to fail and you're going to 
build apps that you know you know what a decent  
03:08 - polish looks like in your head but you're not 
going to be able to get there initially so you  
03:13 - can have to get there first and then next you're 
going to have to figure out the app store and how  
03:17 - to get exposure and learn marketing app marketing 
learning the business side of things and all of  
03:24 - that stuff so when a beginner asks me can they 
make money with apps I say yes but I tell them  
03:31 - all of these things and you know I I don't want 
to sugarcoat things I don't want people signing  
03:37 - up for my courses or learning with me thinking 
that you know they're going to be the next app  
03:42 - millionaire you know that's definitely not the 
treat that's going to take a lot of work in a lot  
03:47 - of effort to maybe potentially get there if you 
have the persistence and you put in the work so  
03:54 - I've actually tried to make money on the App Store 
with a friend I took a stream and it took us three  
03:59 - months to build this app called magic hat is it 
was a children's app and at the time we basically  
04:05 - modeled it after a successful children's app that 
was already ranking high on the App Store and we  
04:11 - thought you know the graphics for this app isn't 
very good we could do something better and what we  
04:18 - created in three months was I felt was better and 
look better more polished but it didn't do very  
04:26 - well and that's because we weren't familiar with 
the marketing and business side of things and part  
04:32 - of us knew that this was just part of the learning 
curve part of the learning process that we'd have  
04:37 - to build more apps and then if we built up a 
portfolio we could cross link and cross promote  
04:42 - the apps and stuff like that but you know pouring 
three months of effort into an app only to see it  
04:49 - not do so well it was genuinely disappointing and 
it's tough to recover from that so I actually I  
04:57 - needed to take a break from doing it because to 
me it was just it felt like a lot of effort and  
05:02 - I had such high hopes for it it didn't meet the 
expectations I needed to take a break from it and  
05:08 - we kind of just never got back into building that 
second app so that was kind of my experience with  
05:15 - trying to make money on the app store and later on 
I found out that app that we modeled with after it  
05:21 - had other channels of marketing it was actually 
being featured on the back of children's books in  
05:27 - the bookstore so that might have been driving its 
downloads as well so that's what I'm saying right  
05:32 - you have to have a decent app but at the same 
time you have to have some sort of business or  
05:37 - marketing plan for it to get exposure and to get 
you know reach that critical tipping point where  
05:43 - it either travels through word of mouth you know 
all your friends are using it they're telling you  
05:48 - about it it kind of goes viral right so maybe I'll 
tell you guys the lessons learned and kind of like  
05:55 - how we went from idea you know through all that 
process to launching the app maybe I'll tell you  
06:02 - guys that story in another video the story of 
magic hat so anyways that's my opinion on the  
06:08 - question can you make money with apps I want to 
hear from you have you made money with apps if you  
06:13 - have or if you haven't let me know your experience 
in the comments section below and if you haven't  
06:18 - published an app yet let me know what your 
motivation is for learning how to build apps is it  
06:23 - to make money or is it just a hobby or is it for 
you know a school project or business let me know  
06:29 - in the comment section below thanks for watching 
guys and I'll see you guys next time bye for now
