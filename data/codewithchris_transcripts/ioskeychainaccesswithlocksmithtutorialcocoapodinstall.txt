00:01 - hey coders it's Chris here I hope you
00:04 - guys are having a great day and today
00:06 - I'm here to talk to you about locksmith
00:09 - it's a library in which we can use to
00:11 - work with keychain in Swift so if you've
00:14 - ever had the need to store data across
00:17 - sessions in your app you've probably
00:18 - used or heard of or read about something
00:21 - called NS user defaults which is great
00:23 - for storing stuff like high scores or
00:26 - user preferences things like that which
00:29 - are not sensitive there are ways to peek
00:31 - into what is stored in the user defaults
00:34 - so you wouldn't want to store any
00:35 - sensitive information in there if you
00:37 - need to store passwords usernames and
00:39 - sensitive data you would want to store
00:41 - them in keikain so this library called
00:43 - locksmith provides a very easy way to
00:46 - store some data into the keychain and to
00:48 - retrieve it we're going to be using
00:50 - cocoapods to install it as we'll see in
00:52 - a quick second and I just wanted to show
00:54 - you very quickly how easy it is to do so
00:56 - so in order to save data we use the
00:59 - class method saved data and you can see
01:01 - here that we can provide a key value
01:03 - pair and then also you can specify a
01:05 - user account when you load the data
01:08 - you're going to be loading all of the
01:10 - key value pairs from the specified user
01:12 - account into a dictionary and then you
01:14 - can go access the data from there ok so
01:16 - let's get started and install locksmith
01:18 - as a cocoapod now if you don't know what
01:21 - cocoapods is just check out the video in
01:23 - the upper right click it open up a new
01:25 - window for you that's where we're gonna
01:27 - walk through how to setup and install
01:28 - cocoapods it's really quick and simple
01:30 - and you only have to do it once let's
01:32 - start by creating our Xcode project I'm
01:35 - gonna create a brand new Xcode project
01:37 - as a single view application
01:40 - let me just readjust this window single
01:43 - view application I'm gonna call this the
01:45 - locksmith demo make sure that the
01:47 - language is Swift and device iPhone is
01:51 - fine and you can just ignore the options
01:53 - underneath and I'm gonna save it on the
01:55 - desktop now we're gonna go ahead and
01:57 - close the project because we're going to
02:00 - create the pod file and a press command
02:03 - space bar and type in terminal to open
02:06 - up the terminal and we're going to
02:08 - browse to the desktop where I saved the
02:10 - project
02:12 - I'm gonna type PWD to see where I am and
02:15 - LS to list the directory contents and CD
02:18 - the folder name desktop to go into that
02:22 - folder LS to list it again and I'm gonna
02:24 - type CD lock and then I'm gonna press
02:27 - tab to autocomplete that folder name so
02:30 - here I'm in my project folder I'm going
02:33 - to write pod
02:34 - space in it and that's going to create a
02:37 - pod file in my project folder here I'm
02:40 - going to right click that and open it up
02:43 - in my text editor sublime text and then
02:46 - here we're going to uncomment the
02:49 - platform line and we're going to get rid
02:51 - of the hash symbol in front of use
02:53 - frameworks as well because this is Swift
02:56 - project that we're working with and
02:58 - we're going to just copy this line under
03:00 - cocoa pods and we're going to paste it
03:03 - in between the target and the end tags
03:05 - let's save the file we can close this
03:08 - file now and go back to terminal and
03:10 - then we can type in pod space install
03:13 - and that's going to read the pod file
03:16 - and install the locksmith pod alright so
03:19 - there we go and we can open up the
03:21 - project folder again and now we have a
03:23 - couple more files we're going to be
03:24 - opening up the x-c workspace file from
03:27 - now on so let me readjust that again I'm
03:29 - going to press command B just to build
03:31 - the project make sure everything's fine
03:33 - and build successfully I'm going to go
03:36 - into the view controller and here we're
03:39 - going to import locksmith and then in
03:43 - the viewdidload I'm just gonna show you
03:44 - a quick demo of saving some data
03:50 - so we type in locksmith dot save data
03:56 - and we're gonna use this method here
03:58 - where we pass in a key value pair and
04:00 - for some account and notice this keyword
04:02 - throws okay so if it can't save this
04:04 - data it's gonna throw an error we're
04:07 - going to need to use some error handling
04:09 - in order to catch that error if it can't
04:11 - save the data so let's specify the
04:13 - parameters first so here let's say that
04:17 - I have a key value pair of let's say
04:21 - it's a password the password would be
04:25 - you know something like that or
04:27 - something more secure than that
04:28 - hopefully and for the account and maybe
04:32 - this would be my apt name okay so now if
04:37 - it can't save this key value pair it's
04:39 - gonna throw an error and in order to
04:41 - catch it what we do is we wrap it in a
04:44 - do catch block like that and we also
04:52 - have to put the keyword try in front of
04:54 - it so just like that it's going to try
04:59 - to execute this method and save the
05:01 - password the key value pair rather and
05:03 - if it can't it's going to come into here
05:05 - could not save the data into keychain
05:10 - and then you're going to have to
05:12 - probably display a message to the user
05:14 - or maybe try it again or something like
05:16 - that you know handle the air somehow and
05:18 - then in terms of retrieving the data
05:20 - let's just retrieve it right after
05:26 - so we say let dictionary equals
05:30 - locksmith dot load data for a user
05:35 - account and the user account we're
05:39 - looking for is that so what I'm going to
05:42 - do is just hit a breakpoint right there
05:45 - and set a breakpoint right there and
05:47 - let's run the project so xcode is just
05:50 - warning us that we've never used this
05:52 - constant that we declared but that's
05:54 - okay okay so it's loading okay it's hit
06:00 - this line of code here where it's gonna
06:03 - try and save that password so I'm going
06:05 - to just step over this breakpoint step
06:09 - over it so it didn't come in to catch so
06:11 - that means it should have successfully
06:13 - saved and now it's stopped at this line
06:15 - where it's going to load that data back
06:16 - up into this dictionary constant I'm
06:18 - gonna press step over to execute this
06:20 - line okay now we're gonna use the
06:23 - console down here we're gonna check out
06:24 - what's inside dictionary so pio
06:27 - dictionary it's gonna print the object
06:29 - and you can see that it does have one
06:31 - element inside it's got a key value pair
06:34 - you know key is password and the value
06:37 - is the actual password so it
06:39 - successfully loaded the data and really
06:42 - that's how simple it is to securely
06:43 - store some data for your app so the next
06:46 - time you need to store something
06:47 - sensitive between app sessions consider
06:50 - using locksmith now I've actually only
06:52 - touched upon the surface of it that was
06:56 - the quick start with save data load data
06:57 - and then there's also update and delete
06:59 - so you can try those out for yourself
07:01 - and there's also more that you can do
07:04 - with it that I won't get into it's
07:06 - something for you to read if you're
07:07 - interested now tomorrow is New Year's
