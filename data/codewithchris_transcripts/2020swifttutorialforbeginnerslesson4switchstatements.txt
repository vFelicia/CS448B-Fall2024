00:00 - hello and welcome to lesson 4 of my
00:02 - Swift tutorial for beginners now in the
00:04 - previous lesson you learned about how to
00:06 - use the if statement to run code based
00:08 - on some conditions now sometimes when
00:10 - you really get into coding you might
00:12 - find yourself ending up with a giant if
00:15 - statement with so many branches that
00:17 - it's going to give you a headache when
00:19 - you see yourself going down this path I
00:21 - want you to stop and consider using a
00:24 - switch statement and in this lesson I'm
00:26 - going to show you exactly how to use
00:28 - that so the first thing I want to
00:36 - mention is that there is a swift
00:37 - programming language guide and probably
00:40 - should have mentioned this in Lesson one
00:42 - but better late than never
00:45 - I'll add the link to this guy in the
00:47 - description below the video now this
00:49 - contains kind of a walkthrough of the
00:53 - language it actually it's more in-depth
00:54 - than that
00:56 - it is basically everything you'd want to
00:59 - know about the Swift programming
01:00 - language however it is quite a lengthy
01:03 - read but if reading is your thing then I
01:05 - would highly recommend that you go
01:07 - through it especially if you come from
01:09 - another programming language it's gonna
01:12 - be very useful for you to skim through
01:13 - it see how the structure of the language
01:16 - is the syntax but if you are an absolute
01:19 - beginner to coding if you never coded
01:22 - before this is your first exposure to it
01:24 - then you might get a little bit confused
01:26 - however it's still a great reference in
01:29 - compliment to what you're learning here
01:31 - in the video lessons so definitely check
01:33 - it out so I just wanted to point out
01:36 - where we are now I'm not following the
01:38 - exact order that they have listed out
01:40 - here because I feel like the way that
01:43 - they have laid it out is a very slow
01:45 - build up until you can actually start
01:47 - using the language of having fun with it
01:48 - and building things and so the way that
01:51 - I've laid out this lesson plan for you
01:53 - in this video series you can be vague
01:56 - it's very practical and you can start
01:58 - coding and start tinkering and having
02:01 - fun sooner so I just want to show you
02:04 - where you would find some of the lessons
02:06 - that we've gone through so in the
02:08 - previous lesson we talked about if
02:09 - statements that's
02:10 - under control flow and there's also this
02:12 - little drop down here so if you pull
02:14 - this guy down you can jump to different
02:16 - sections so we are at conditional
02:19 - statements right here so you could see
02:21 - the if statement gives you a couple of
02:24 - examples so it's you know it's really
02:25 - good
02:26 - supplementary material to what we've
02:27 - covered but in today's topic I want to
02:30 - talk to you about the switch statement
02:32 - which is right here so I just want for
02:35 - you to take a look at the syntax here
02:37 - you'll notice that there is the switch
02:40 - keyword here and then there is some
02:42 - value to consider and then a set of
02:45 - braces and inside there's these case and
02:48 - these default keywords you know what I'm
02:52 - gonna show you how it's used inside of a
02:54 - playground and I'm going to use an
02:55 - example so you know it's gonna be a lot
02:57 - easier to understand so let's go ahead
02:59 - and do that so let's pop up an Xcode
03:03 - here let's get started with the
03:04 - playground and I am just going to switch
03:10 - playground and I'll save this on the
03:13 - desktop let's just minimize this guy -
03:17 - what's destruction all right so I
03:19 - declare a new constant here and let's
03:21 - say that this is a character so why
03:26 - don't we call this a and we are going to
03:29 - assign it a little sign add a let's call
03:35 - it character let's call it CHR now if I
03:38 - wanted to test this constant and see if
03:41 - it was equal to a I could do something
03:43 - like this if CHR is remember we use
03:46 - double equal sign for equality testing
03:49 - equality I mean you know I could print
03:52 - [Applause]
03:53 - the character is a and then if I wanted
03:57 - to go through all of the letters of the
03:59 - alphabet I could do else if you know you
04:03 - get the picture right it would be a
04:05 - giant if statement not recommended but
04:08 - this is where the switch statement would
04:09 - come in handy so why don't we just
04:11 - quickly take a look at the syntax so
04:14 - just like you saw in the language guide
04:15 - you start with the switch keyword then
04:18 - followed by the thing that you want to
04:19 - check in our example in the playground
04:22 - that was the constant
04:23 - named CHR and then you open up a set of
04:26 - braces and then inside the braces you
04:28 - put all the things that you want to
04:29 - check for and each thing that you want
04:31 - to check for is preceded by the case
04:33 - keyword so it would be case whatever you
04:36 - want to check for first followed by
04:38 - colon and then the code that you want to
04:40 - execute if that case is true followed by
04:43 - the next case and so on and so forth and
04:46 - at the very bottom you have a default
04:48 - case for when none of the cases match
04:50 - it's going to hit the default case and
04:52 - run your code there now let's jump back
04:54 - to the playground and see this in action
04:55 - so let's erase this if statement and
04:59 - instead use a switch statement so we're
05:02 - gonna say switch and actually you can
05:05 - use autocomplete and you just press
05:06 - ENTER like that and it's gonna come up
05:08 - with all of the cases for you or you
05:10 - could type it out for practice so you
05:13 - can see immediately it it's come up with
05:16 - this syntax for me it's just really
05:18 - handy because I can actually hit tab on
05:20 - my keyboard and jump through the
05:23 - different things that I have to fill in
05:24 - well I guess it stops right there let's
05:27 - change the value for CHR and the pattern
05:33 - that I want to check for you know the
05:35 - first case would be a right and the code
05:38 - that I want to put here would be this is
05:42 - an a right and then default might be
05:47 - this is all that so let's run this code
05:52 - and see what happens so as expected it
05:57 - hits this case and it prints an eight
05:59 - now what if we want it to check for
06:02 - something else let's say B print this is
06:07 - a B and if we just change that to a B
06:14 - and then we run it again you'll see that
06:17 - it skips this case and it comes down
06:20 - here and prints this instead now one
06:22 - additional cool thing I want to show you
06:23 - is that you can actually combine cases
06:25 - so let's say four cases B and C I want
06:29 - to execute the same block of code so I
06:31 - want to say this is
06:33 - this is a B or C so I would just put a
06:36 - comma here and I can put the other thing
06:40 - that I want to check for it so if CHR is
06:43 - a B or a C then this code is going to be
06:46 - executed and so as expected it jumps
06:51 - down here so this is pretty much it for
06:53 - a switch statement it's pretty easy to
06:55 - use to be honest and it's a lot easier
06:57 - to read than a giant if statement once
07:00 - you agree now to get more practice using
07:02 - switch statements I highly recommend
07:04 - that you get the worksheet just hop on
