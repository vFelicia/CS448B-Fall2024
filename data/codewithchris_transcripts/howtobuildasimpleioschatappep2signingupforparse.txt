00:05 - hello in this lesson we're going to go
00:08 - through some of the features of the
00:09 - parse platform as well as sign up for
00:11 - our parse account so I'm on parse dog
00:14 - comma I just clicked into the products
00:16 - section I talked a little bit about what
00:18 - we're going to be using which is this
00:20 - thing called parse core and if you click
00:23 - into that you can see some of the cool
00:24 - things you can do with it so this
00:27 - feature save data in the cloud is
00:29 - primarily the reason we're going to be
00:31 - using it in this demo but if you keep
00:33 - scrolling down there are some other cool
00:36 - things you can do with par score you can
00:40 - make your app social so you can log in
00:42 - via social networks with just a couple
00:45 - lines of code and I've had a chance to
00:48 - use this one as well local data store
00:50 - which is really cool so if your app
00:53 - doesn't have a connection and it can't
00:56 - save data into the parse cloud it can
00:59 - store that data locally and furthermore
01:02 - some data doesn't need to be stored on
01:04 - the cloud so you can store it locally
01:06 - within the app they have this feature
01:11 - where you can have a web presence for
01:13 - your app creating a landing page but I
01:15 - haven't used that one before
01:17 - and if you need to create server-side
01:20 - code may be some sort of processing
01:23 - logic before putting the data into the
01:26 - database you can do that using the parse
01:28 - JavaScript SDK to write that server-side
01:30 - code and then furthermore
01:34 - this is getting into stuff that I
01:35 - haven't used before background jobs you
01:38 - can schedule things to happen so it says
01:40 - here whether that's sending emails or
01:42 - updating data or doing some maybe even
01:45 - running server-side logic and this is
01:50 - what makes it also useful there's a
01:51 - parse dashboard where you can create
01:54 - your table schema but they don't call it
01:57 - a table it's the concept of Records but
01:59 - you can view all of your data in here
02:01 - your analytics and stuff like that
02:03 - through this easy-to-use dashboard which
02:06 - we'll see in a couple lessons later and
02:10 - lastly like I mentioned before one of
02:12 - the benefits
02:13 - using a platform like parse is that this
02:16 - is all they do is to be the best at
02:19 - being a back-end for your app so if your
02:22 - app takes off and gets really popular
02:23 - you don't have to worry about adding
02:25 - servers or making sure that your data is
02:28 - replicated across them and doing load
02:30 - balancing you know and all that sort of
02:31 - stuff that comes with managing it on
02:34 - your own it's very easy to scale up or
02:36 - down and you only get charged for what
02:39 - you use but they have a very generous
02:41 - free tier so you probably won't have to
02:43 - pay for a while unless your app really
02:45 - gets popular and lastly the reason why
02:48 - we're doing this is so that we can share
02:50 - data between different platforms right
02:52 - and across different devices so unlike
02:55 - using cloud kit which is iOS only using
02:59 - parse allows us to say we built an
03:02 - Android app it can also use the same
03:04 - parse back-end instance that is shared
03:07 - with the iOS side okay and what we've
03:11 - gone through now is just par score
03:13 - there's two other modules that we can
03:16 - look at is parse analytics and parse
03:18 - push but I think that's good for now
03:21 - what I want you to do is go up into the
03:23 - upper right hand corner and click sign
03:26 - up and register for an account you can
03:29 - simply register an account using an
03:30 - email and a password or you can log in
03:32 - with one of your social accounts so once
03:35 - you do you'll be brought to a page kind
03:38 - of like this where you have a dashboard
03:39 - and here are just some of the sample
03:41 - apps that I've created to play around
03:43 - with parse but what we are going to want
03:46 - to do is to create a brand new app up
03:49 - here so we could name this let's name it
03:54 - chat app and click create and then it's
03:59 - created so that's really it
04:01 - you've just created a parse back-end
04:03 - instance for your app in the following
04:05 - lessons I'll show you guys how to
04:06 - integrate the parse SDK into your Xcode
04:10 - project so that you can start connecting
04:11 - to this back-end instance and start
04:13 - saving and retrieving data all right
04:15 - I'll see you guys in the next lesson
