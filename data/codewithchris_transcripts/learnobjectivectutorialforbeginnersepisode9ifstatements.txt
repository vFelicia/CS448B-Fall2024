00:08 - hey guys Chris here with another
00:10 - objective c lesson and today we're going
00:13 - to be talking about if statements so
00:14 - let's dig in you can download this Xcode
00:18 - project from the link on the screen or
00:20 - in the link in the description below the
00:22 - first thing we're going to talk about
00:24 - our if statements and if you are
00:26 - familiar with other programming
00:28 - languages you will probably pick this up
00:31 - really easily and for those of you guys
00:33 - who aren't programmers if statements are
00:36 - basically something that you do
00:37 - unconsciously without even knowing it
00:40 - when you think about something there are
00:41 - times where you're going to think if
00:43 - some sort of condition then I'm going to
00:45 - do something else if it's this then I'm
00:47 - going to do that well when you're
00:49 - writing code well when you're writing
00:50 - code if statements allow you to make
00:52 - those sorts of decisions so if i just
00:56 - type in if Xcode already assumes that
01:00 - that's what i want to do and you can see
01:02 - from here there are two parts to the if
01:05 - statement the condition and the
01:07 - statements for example if I just declare
01:09 - a variable up here let's just say its
01:11 - age and let's just give it 10 now I want
01:17 - to say something like if the variable
01:19 - age is above 10 then I want to do
01:22 - something so all I would have to do is
01:26 - use the greater than comparison and see
01:30 - if h is greater than 10 then in here i
01:34 - can write whatever I want do something
01:39 - now there's another part to the if
01:42 - statement and that's the else clause and
01:48 - I can do something else here so when
01:52 - this code runs it checks the variable
01:54 - age if it's greater than 10 if it is
01:57 - then it's going to run this branch and
01:59 - if it's not if it's below 10 it's going
02:02 - to run this code down here it'll never
02:05 - do both now you can do other stuff let's
02:10 - say that you have two conditions you can
02:12 - have an L
02:13 - if if age is greater than 10 then do
02:19 - something if it's greater than seven
02:22 - then do something else and then finally
02:24 - if it's none of those two conditions do
02:30 - something else here do something if H is
02:34 - over 10 and in this condition do
02:37 - something else if age is over seven so
02:42 - when it's checking age it might in this
02:46 - example because age is 10 it is not this
02:50 - condition is not true so it's actually
02:51 - going to fall and check this next
02:54 - condition if it's greater than 7 and it
02:58 - is is we have 10 there it's going to
03:00 - actually execute this if I had changed
03:03 - this variable to a 5 then it would
03:05 - actually run the code in here simple but
03:07 - powerful you'll find yourself using if
03:09 - statements a lot in your code now some
03:12 - other examples you don't have to be
03:14 - using an integer in this example we did
03:16 - you could even use objects or strings or
03:20 - something like that so let's look at an
03:22 - example where we want to compare a
03:24 - string so let's say I had a name corey
03:31 - and i wanted to write an if statement i
03:34 - want to execute some code if the name is
03:37 - Corey so I could use a method that's
03:41 - part of the NS string and compare it to
03:48 - Corey do something if name is Corey else
04:00 - do something else if name is not Cory so
04:07 - in this example here I have a variable
04:09 - with the string Corey in it and in this
04:13 - if statement i'm checking if the name
04:15 - variable is equal to the string Corey
04:17 - now you can add something like this !
04:21 - and that is the equivalent of the
04:23 - negative so now this reads if name is
04:26 - not equal to Corey so this actually
04:29 - becomes if name is not Cory then do
04:34 - something and then this elf statement
04:36 - obviously is let's do something else
04:40 - likewise in here I could say if name is
04:45 - not equal to 10 then do something if is
04:48 - not equal to 10 so in this case where
04:54 - age is 5 it would come into this branch
04:57 - so what do you think of the if statement
04:59 - in the next lesson we're going to learn
05:01 - about conditional operators and how we
05:03 - can start to chain those conditions
05:04 - together and form even more powerful if
05:07 - statements now for your fact of the day
05:10 - back in March of 2012 apple released
05:14 - some stats for the app store and one of
05:18 - the stats was that developers
05:20 - collectively made over four billion
05:22 - dollars from the app store Wow what do
05:26 - you think of that let me know in the
05:27 - comments section below I'll see you guys
05:29 - next time
05:43 - you
