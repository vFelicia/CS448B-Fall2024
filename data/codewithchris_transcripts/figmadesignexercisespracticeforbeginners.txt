00:00 - hey code crew what's up as promised here
00:02 - are some figma exercises for you to do
00:04 - just to get some practice and to get
00:06 - comfortable with creating graphics with
00:08 - figma actually you can use any sorts of
00:11 - graphics program that you want you still
00:13 - should be able to produce these
00:15 - following exercises so for the first
00:17 - exercise I've got a rounded button very
00:20 - simple just a rounded pill shape with a
00:23 - text in the front and you know what you
00:25 - do on your screen doesn't have to be
00:27 - exactly alike but the point is to get
00:31 - you to figure out how to do things like
00:33 - rounded corners and angles and and
00:35 - cropping and masking and that sort of
00:37 - stuff learning these sort of building
00:39 - blocks will allow you to construct more
00:41 - complex you eyes okay so for exercise
00:44 - number two is to draw an X and this is a
00:47 - not an icon this is you know two
00:49 - different shapes you don't have to know
00:51 - how to set angles of the shapes and this
00:54 - one is just in the arrow again this is
00:56 - not an icon these are two separate
00:58 - shapes and you're gonna have to
00:59 - construct the arrow and construct the
01:01 - circle I won't get too much into it or
01:04 - else I will I will reveal the answer
01:07 - this one is starting to get a little
01:09 - more complicated and you start to notice
01:11 - so that we can reuse elements that we
01:14 - did before so this was from you know the
01:16 - first exercise so you can just add that
01:18 - to here but you notice that there's some
01:21 - see-through some sort of lighter opacity
01:24 - on these circles here this next one is
01:26 - to create a form and this was from this
01:30 - exercise right here and then this one is
01:33 - starting to layer imagery and you can
01:36 - see there's an opacity element to it
01:39 - rounded corners
01:41 - notice that I'm starting to play with a
01:43 - couple of different colors this one is
01:46 - an exercise in masking so you take an
01:49 - image any image it doesn't have to be a
01:51 - face and then try to apply a circular
01:54 - mask to it or if you're clever maybe
01:57 - you'll play around with the radius and
02:00 - then this one is just taking that and
02:01 - putting it into a more putting it into
02:05 - the context of a chat bubble so I highly
02:08 - urge for you to go through these
02:09 - exercises yourself either in figma
02:11 - sketch or your graphics
02:13 - of choice and then after you do that
02:15 - continue watching for the solutions for
02:18 - these exercises alright so now let's run
02:35 - through the solutions for these
02:37 - exercises I'm going to keep these on the
02:39 - screen right here at the top and we're
02:41 - going to just add an artboard below each
02:44 - exercise and I'll show you the solution
02:46 - for them hopefully you've had a chance
02:48 - to try them on your own ok let's create
02:51 - an upper right there and I'll just
02:54 - duplicate it for each one there is
03:01 - alright so this is just the rectangle
03:04 - with rounded corners so go ahead and
03:07 - press R or choose this and we're gonna
03:10 - add a rectangle like that and we're
03:13 - going to I'll just select the same color
03:16 - but you can really choose any color
03:17 - you'd want and then you can change the
03:19 - corner radius and you can either give a
03:21 - number or you can drag this or you can
03:27 - just press up so give a corner radius
03:30 - like that let's add some text
03:34 - we can change the text to white and we
03:39 - can increase its size oh that's that's
03:42 - really big but it goes something like
03:45 - this now I'm not gonna try to make it
03:47 - exactly like that one my point is just
03:51 - to show you kind of the techniques so it
03:54 - looks something like that
03:56 - okay so the next one we're gonna do an X
04:00 - so this one is really simple so we're
04:03 - gonna create a rectangle oops let's
04:05 - erase that press R let's create a thin
04:09 - rectangle like that and let's make it
04:13 - red and if you don't want to make it
04:18 - thinner like that you can always just
04:19 - adjust the height right and then now
04:24 - we're gonna adjust the angle there's
04:25 - actually you can just do this right or
04:28 - you can type in a number so we'll say 45
04:31 - degrees and now at this point you have
04:33 - several options you can either duplicate
04:36 - this in fact actually will have two so
04:39 - you can right click and you can
04:41 - duplicate it actually it doesn't seem to
04:48 - be a command in this menu here but if
04:50 - you you can either copy command C and
04:52 - then command V to paste another one of
04:55 - these or you can press command D and you
04:58 - would have duplicated it now for this
05:00 - one the second one right you can do
05:04 - negative 45 like that and you can kind
05:09 - of just put them together like that now
05:13 - that you have these two lines let's
05:15 - group them together press command G put
05:18 - them in a group now you can move them
05:19 - around as a group you can also combine
05:24 - these two shapes into one using this
05:26 - using Union and that's going to just
05:31 - make that one shape okay what's the
05:34 - second one so we've got this arrow and
05:37 - we've got this green circle so let's
05:40 - let's let's do the circle
05:43 - so we're gonna choose ellipse and if you
05:49 - hold down shift and you drag it it will
05:51 - be a perfect circle so let's do that and
05:54 - we will make that green and then I want
06:01 - to kind of draw the arrow on top of it
06:04 - now there is this one but that's not how
06:09 - I did it if that's how you did it that's
06:10 - okay I actually built the arrow out of a
06:12 - rectangle and a triangle there but it's
06:18 - a little bit annoying to put shapes on
06:20 - top of each other because sometimes you
06:22 - might accidentally select this one and
06:25 - you might be moving this one when you're
06:26 - intending to move this one so you can
06:28 - actually do is lock down layers so if
06:30 - you know that you don't want to touch
06:32 - this ellipse right here you can click
06:34 - that little lock icon and now you're not
06:36 - going to be able to select it or
06:38 - accidentally modify it so that's really
06:39 - helpful when you're working on
06:42 - overlapping layers so let's build that
06:46 - little rectangle and make that white and
06:50 - that's a polygon do something like that
06:58 - let's make it white and let's sorry
07:05 - ninety degrees nope negative 90
07:13 - all right and then let's attach it on
07:15 - there so I'm gonna make this a single
07:19 - shape by selecting both of them and
07:22 - hitting Union and then I'm gonna be able
07:24 - to just position it right there so
07:27 - that's that okay so this one right here
07:30 - is just eat a piece of text with our
07:33 - button so let's add text first and by
07:39 - default it's kind of taken the text the
07:43 - last time I used the text element which
07:45 - was configured to be bold and 48 in
07:47 - Roboto so that's why that looks like
07:51 - that and I'm just gonna take this button
07:53 - that we did so I'm gonna take these the
07:55 - text and the rectangle I'm gonna put in
07:57 - a group I'm going to copy that by
07:59 - pressing command C and then pasting it
08:01 - here and just having it there and then
08:04 - in terms of creating these circles you
08:07 - press o or choose the ellipse and you
08:11 - just draw some ellipses there the key
08:14 - thing is to make sure that they're
08:16 - slightly transparent so I'm going to
08:19 - duplicate that and just move a button
08:21 - here
08:22 - sorry move the circle there and I'm
08:24 - gonna make that a slightly different
08:26 - blue and you can either modify the fill
08:31 - color so you can make it like a 50% blue
08:34 - like this or you can modify the opacity
08:37 - of the entire layer because sometimes
08:39 - the layer includes multiple elements and
08:41 - that would make the whole layer you know
08:43 - all of those elements whatever
08:46 - transparency you set here or you can do
08:50 - you know the color is is a
08:54 - semi-transparent color if you're gonna
08:58 - do that maybe this one can be 70 this
09:04 - one's really not showing through do
09:10 - something like that and then up here the
09:13 - same thing
09:20 - this one is not in the art world anymore
09:30 - duplicate it copy and paste where's that
09:37 - circle there it is oh I was copying and
09:41 - pasting these fills by accident you know
09:45 - so something like that that's how you're
09:47 - going to get that transparent effect so
09:48 - that was just an exercise in doing that
09:50 - this is this is a form so let's add
09:55 - create profile let's add another piece
10:05 - of text or under there
10:15 - all right and we are going to wrap that
10:20 - text here the thing here is that you
10:24 - want to line them up so you can kind of
10:26 - drag to line these guys up or you can
10:28 - select both of them and choose that to
10:31 - make sure that they are aligned on the
10:33 - left-hand side obviously this text
10:36 - shouldn't be bold and I just want to get
10:38 - regular actually and we can even make
10:41 - that text a little lighter okay so now
10:45 - we're gonna add two rectangles for the
10:47 - username and password and this is where
10:52 - I wanted you to look at using stroke so
10:55 - there's a stroke that you can add right
10:58 - which gives it that block border you can
11:01 - set the the width and even if you if you
11:05 - hit these ellipses right here you can
11:07 - decide if you want to have a rounded
11:12 - join right there you can play with it
11:14 - and it'll give you a different effect
11:15 - actually so this actually only applies
11:20 - when you have dashes sorry so when you
11:22 - have dashes let's say you wanted to do a
11:24 - dashed line like that so you can see a
11:27 - dashed line maybe two and two like that
11:32 - oh yeah choosing that is gonna give you
11:38 - a little bit of a different effect so
11:39 - you can kind of play around with those
11:41 - things I haven't really used it very
11:42 - much so I'm not very familiar with using
11:46 - that but I delete the fill and so you
11:49 - get that transparent text box effect
11:52 - which we see up here so I'm going to
11:55 - just duplicate that text field and move
11:59 - it down here and this one will be
12:02 - username double get that and this one
12:08 - would be password
12:11 - one tip if you want to line things up
12:13 - properly you can hold down the option
12:17 - key and you can kind of measure where
12:20 - things are positioned but let's say you
12:26 - want it to align password and this
12:27 - there's an easier way just using these
12:30 - guys so you can hold down cell shift
12:32 - select them both and you can choose
12:35 - something like align horizontal centers
12:39 - you know vertical centers so you see
12:42 - that password text just kind of moved in
12:44 - the middle and that way you don't have
12:45 - to manually position anything like that
12:48 - and then you can also select all of
12:51 - these all of these text labels and make
12:53 - sure they're aligned on the left hand
12:55 - side you can select this just the double
12:57 - check so you have something like that
13:00 - and you can go back to this well I can't
13:05 - select a green circle because I've
13:07 - locked it so let me unlock that circle
13:10 - and let me group these two together
13:14 - command G and then let me copy this
13:17 - entire thing and paste it into this
13:20 - artboard and then in order to scale for
13:23 - figma at least press k or you can choose
13:27 - it from here you can by default it's you
13:30 - know you're using move but if you want
13:31 - to scale something you can hit K go to
13:33 - scale and then you can see the
13:36 - difference in your cursor right there's
13:38 - that's move that's a scale so you can
13:42 - kind of see that the arrows have an
13:43 - additional sort of cap at the end then
13:46 - you know you're using scale to get out
13:48 - of scale mode just press escape we're
13:50 - gonna press K to get back into scale
13:51 - mode and you can just scale this down
13:53 - and one other note is that you know as
13:57 - as you add more elements and layers into
13:59 - your design things are going to get
14:01 - really confusing as you can see here
14:02 - group three doesn't really tell you what
14:05 - it is so you can you know call this a
14:07 - submit button or something like that if
14:09 - you just click it or double click it
14:12 - rather you can change that name so
14:15 - that's that one for this one let's copy
14:19 - this background because I I don't have
14:21 - this image anymore
14:23 - so I'm gonna just copy that image and
14:28 - I'm gonna paste it in here you can use
14:30 - any image to be honest it doesn't really
14:32 - matter all right so there's the image
14:35 - and I'm going to draw a box like that
14:42 - it's gonna be white let's say is 70% 90%
14:48 - see-through it's got a bit of corner
14:51 - radius on it let's say 20 that's a
14:53 - little bit too much that's a 15 let's
14:56 - see what else this looks like the
14:58 - requesting permission do you want allow
14:59 - this app to send you notifications no
15:01 - one yes
15:02 - okay so let's add the text you can see
15:19 - I'm just lining it up based on these
15:20 - these red lines that show up that tells
15:23 - me that it's in the center
15:36 - suddenly changing it to regular font and
15:42 - then we are going to just set the label
15:48 - like that let's scroll in a little bit
15:51 - hold down command and swipe or use your
15:55 - scroll wheel if you're using a mouse and
15:58 - you can zoom in and another one you see
16:01 - me panning around you hold down a space
16:04 - bar and you can click and drag and pan
16:06 - around so this is gonna be really useful
16:08 - hold down command right scroll and
16:11 - you're gonna zoom a hold down spacebar
16:14 - and drag it and you're gonna you're
16:17 - gonna be panning around so those two are
16:18 - really useful all right so let's go
16:21 - ahead and add these two buttons that was
16:26 - a rectangle this is text and then I'm
16:32 - gonna group these two into a button
16:36 - let's call it no button I'm gonna
16:40 - duplicate it just drag it over here this
16:44 - one's going to be the yes button and I'm
16:49 - going to change the text from and OH -
16:52 - ye-es
16:52 - and we're also going to just change this
16:55 - gray to a blue
17:04 - I'll change that to white all right so I
17:08 - think that that looks kind of like that
17:12 - see holding down what is this button
17:15 - option 31 from the from the headline
17:18 - there and 30 from the button more or
17:22 - less in the center 22 from the right 21
17:25 - like that so you can adjust make sure
17:28 - things line up properly okay so we are
17:33 - nearing the homestretch this one again I
17:37 - don't have that image so I'm just gonna
17:38 - select the face and I'm gonna copy it
17:41 - here but you can use any sort of image
17:44 - that you'd like let's create an ellipse
17:47 - hold down shift to make a perfect circle
17:55 - and then this part I usually I usually
17:57 - mess up so you can I think actually the
18:03 - ellipse goes underneath the image but
18:04 - let's give it a try so I select both of
18:07 - them and then say use us mask so you're
18:10 - gonna be using you want to use the
18:12 - ellipse as a mask for the image but if
18:16 - you do it like that and you get
18:17 - something like this obviously that's not
18:19 - the result you wanted just hit command Z
18:22 - or command Z to undo and just rearrange
18:26 - these two layers so if it was the
18:28 - ellipse on top first you didn't get the
18:30 - results you wanted put the image on top
18:32 - of the ellipse select both and then
18:35 - select use us mask and done that becomes
18:38 - the proper thing that we wanted to do so
18:41 - I tend to always mess that part up okay
18:45 - so this last one for this artboard you
18:48 - can actually set a fill on the artboard
18:50 - itself so let's set it black and
18:56 - relatively simple you're basically
18:58 - combining what you learned here right
19:00 - with this to create something like this
19:03 - so let's hit R for rectangle
19:05 - let's go like that
19:09 - white 90% rounded corner 15 that looks
19:17 - more like 10 actually and then we are
19:21 - going to copy this face actually we need
19:26 - to copy it as the whole thing so again
19:28 - let's group that up just call it profile
19:32 - icon let's copy this and paste it here
19:37 - and we're going to use our scaling hit K
19:42 - scale it down you'll notice that in the
19:46 - exercise that I had there is a slightly
19:49 - transparent border right so you can do
19:53 - the same thing using this stroke just
19:55 - add a stroke that's a two
20:08 - inside outside and actually I'm not
20:13 - really seeing it and so so you can see
20:22 - that this stroke is actually happening
20:25 - somewhere there you can see that red
20:27 - over there that's not what we want so it
20:30 - looks like actually I went down the
20:32 - wrong path adding a stroke to this group
20:36 - or the mask isn't gonna produce the
20:39 - effect that I want so I am going to
20:41 - remove this stroke like that and instead
20:45 - I'm going to create an ellipse and put
20:46 - it right under that profile image so I'm
20:50 - gonna just hold down shift and create an
20:53 - ellipse like that and just put it under
20:56 - the icon and let's make it the same size
20:58 - so I mean the the profile icon is 87 for
21:03 - the ellipse 90 let's say 91 so that's
21:09 - four points and I am going to select
21:13 - these two and I'm going to say align it
21:16 - horizontal centers and vertical centers
21:19 - that's gonna give that sort of stroke
21:22 - effect their stats can be bold
21:43 - that's a line both of these to the left
21:46 - all right so that's that's how you
21:49 - create that sort of effect there now a
21:52 - lot of these exercises might have seemed
21:54 - trivial or easy but it goes a long ways
21:58 - towards getting used to using the tools
22:00 - at your disposal and then it's going to
22:02 - be up to you to take a look at other
22:05 - great designs or using your own
22:07 - creativity and using the techniques that
22:10 - you know to produce an app design for
22:13 - your app idea if you really found this
22:15 - helpful in terms of developing your
22:17 - skills and familiarity inside design
22:20 - tools like figment sketch please let me
22:23 - know in the comment section below that
