00:00 - now it's not interesting if the dice are
00:05 - the same all the time so why don't we
00:08 - add another statement here you know we
00:12 - can we can do something like
00:23 - you can get another dice roll and
00:26 - instead a sign rolled to to the second
00:29 - eye so now let's run it and see what
00:31 - happens there you go it's different
00:37 - we're still missing one last thing which
00:39 - is the sum the label right here so I'm
00:42 - going to stop it and we had already
00:46 - created this sum label and if you
00:48 - remember we need to add a property to
00:54 - our controller so that we can refer to
00:56 - this label and then in our roll button
01:00 - clicked handler we want to add up these
01:02 - two numbers and display it into that
01:04 - label assign that text to that label so
01:07 - I'm going to go into the header file of
01:09 - the controller and I'm gonna hold down
01:12 - ctrl on my key and click that label the
01:16 - sum label and drag it into my interface
01:19 - to create a property for it so I called
01:29 - it some label now I can go back into the
01:31 - implementation file and down here after
01:36 - I show the two dice
01:39 - I can I can add up the two numbers well
01:44 - let's create the string of text
02:10 - so the number from role plus role to is
02:14 - gonna get assigned to the percentage D
02:16 - and the text will read some is you know
02:18 - whatever the sum is so now we assign
02:22 - that text to our label which we can
02:25 - reference via the property we just
02:26 - created and voila this should work let's
02:38 - run it
02:46 - and there it is so that was a pretty
02:50 - simple app I think it does a good job of
02:53 - showing you the different roles you know
02:55 - for controller the view and the model we
02:58 - used all of them today and if you know
03:01 - you were lost in the objective-c or the
03:04 - Xcode and some of the concepts I might
03:08 - not have explained through the video you
03:09 - can visit my blog code with Chris calm
03:12 - and click this green box and read these
03:16 - first two articles on a primer for
03:18 - objective-c and if you watch the video
03:20 - again I think you'll understand what I'm
03:24 - doing here but I'm going to be following
03:28 - up this video with a new series
03:30 - introducing Objective C so if you prefer
03:32 - to you know learn through video then
03:35 - that's fine those will be coming out and
03:37 - as well as Xcode if you are unfamiliar
03:40 - with the different interfaces I was
03:44 - using and stuff like that you can go to
03:47 - my blog and read article 4 for an
03:49 - introduction to Xcode but I'm gonna be
03:54 - creating a Xcode video series as well
03:56 - and I'm gonna be teaching you guys that
03:58 - through video so so if you guys have any
04:02 - questions at all please leave them in
04:04 - the comments below for the benefit of
04:05 - everyone else and I will be answering
04:07 - questions there also you can download
04:11 - the source code and you can try running
04:13 - this project yourself the source code is
04:16 - in the link in the description and all
04:19 - you need to do is sign up to be a member
04:21 - of code with Kris calm but it's free and
04:23 - it's gonna take you less than a minute
04:25 - to do so I hope that was helpful to you
04:28 - guys and again please let me know what
04:30 - you think in the comments below and I
04:32 - will be responding within the day thanks
04:34 - everyone see you later bye
