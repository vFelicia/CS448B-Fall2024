00:01 - [Music]
00:06 - hey it's chris here and i just wanted to
00:07 - give you
00:08 - a week to summary so last week bowen
00:10 - worked on the back end
00:12 - so he set up the web server with the
00:13 - database and the authentication piece
00:16 - and i'm going to actually let him chime
00:17 - in on that experience and what it was
00:19 - like
00:19 - to build that in just a second but i do
00:22 - want to say
00:23 - that i sat down with ellen
00:26 - and we had discussed where this was
00:29 - going and what it would look like in
00:30 - three months when it was done
00:32 - and it made us realize that maybe we
00:36 - have taken on a lot more than we
00:38 - bargained for
00:40 - because this idea is essentially almost
00:43 - its own separate business right you're
00:45 - helping
00:46 - content creators um create their own
00:49 - app and get it in the app store and
00:52 - you're gonna have to have people
00:53 - supporting them
00:54 - um you know helping them walk through
00:57 - issues for submitting their app and
00:58 - wanting customizations and initially i
01:00 - thought about all the cool things that
01:02 - could come out of that like
01:03 - we could do you know consultation
01:05 - requests and
01:06 - all that but i still think there is a
01:10 - need
01:10 - for people who want to build apps who
01:12 - don't necessarily learn to code but
01:15 - i think for the scope of the case study
01:18 - that might be too big of a problem to
01:21 - tackle
01:22 - and i think that i basically bit off
01:24 - more than i can chew
01:25 - so um while it's still early while it's
01:28 - still two weeks in and we still have you
01:30 - know two and a half months
01:32 - um we're hitting the reset button and
01:35 - this time
01:36 - i want to create an app where the end
01:40 - user
01:40 - is someone in the app store finding the
01:43 - app and using it
01:44 - and we're targeting you know consumers
01:46 - rather than um
01:48 - business owners or other content
01:51 - creators or influencers
01:52 - so it's going to be a self-contained app
01:54 - where the product is the app
01:56 - in the app store itself and i think this
01:59 - makes for
02:00 - a much stronger case study especially um
02:04 - for what we're trying to do here at code
02:06 - with chris which is to
02:08 - show people teach people how to code and
02:10 - to build apps
02:11 - and i think we can also control the
02:13 - scope so that
02:15 - it is you know maybe a single focus app
02:18 - that does
02:19 - one thing well something we can build in
02:21 - two and a half months
02:23 - get it launched do some marketing for it
02:26 - and
02:26 - um i think this is the direction that
02:28 - most people who are
02:30 - picking up coding and wanting to learn
02:32 - how to build apps this is the direction
02:34 - that they're going
02:35 - rather than trying to build you know a
02:38 - business
02:39 - that helps other content creators build
02:42 - their own apps you know so
02:43 - that's i wanted the case study to to
02:46 - reflect
02:47 - something that would be useful for
02:48 - people so
02:50 - in short we're going to hit the reset
02:52 - button next week you're going to see me
02:54 - give updates on this new direction we're
02:57 - going
02:58 - what new app idea we've decided on and
03:00 - we're going to go through that
03:01 - validation phase all over again
03:03 - but we're just gonna choose a smaller
03:04 - scope so that we can still finish in
03:05 - three months
03:06 - all right thanks for following along i'm
03:08 - gonna pass it to boa now to talk a
03:09 - little bit about his experience
03:12 - hi i'll be going over the simple web
03:14 - server and database that i built
03:16 - for our original app idea the purpose of
03:19 - this was so that users could create an
03:21 - account
03:21 - and create a config for themselves over
03:24 - here
03:25 - the server displays all the database
03:27 - items and over here we should see that
03:29 - we have two users one with test name and
03:31 - one with the new username
03:34 - through our front end we could create a
03:36 - new user so this demo
03:37 - with any password and then in our server
03:41 - we see that it updates the database
03:43 - appropriately we can update the
03:45 - information for the config like so
03:49 - save it and this gets communicated to
03:52 - the server
03:53 - which then updates the database as well
03:55 - and then we see
03:56 - over here in this entry the name channel
03:59 - and other information are all
04:01 - updated in the database item in the
04:04 - front end if we refresh the page
04:06 - and we log in again
04:09 - we see that the front end communicates
04:11 - with the server and pulls the data from
04:13 - the database
04:15 - overall this was extremely valuable
04:17 - learning experience for me in terms of
04:19 - figuring out how to set up a database
04:21 - how to set up server as well as
04:23 - communicating between
04:24 - the front end and the backend and
04:25 - integrating everything together and
04:27 - although there's still areas of
04:28 - improvement such as adding
04:30 - authentication using tokens and
04:32 - verifying password encryptions i believe
04:34 - that this was still extremely valuable
04:36 - learning experience
04:37 - and it will help me create better apps
04:39 - in the future thank you i just want to
04:42 - say although we're not using that
04:44 - server and back end piece right now it
04:46 - was really interesting to see that come
04:48 - together
04:49 - and also bo and i learned a lot from um
04:52 - you know having to think through how
04:54 - that would work and
04:56 - we learned a lot in the process and so
04:58 - that's something that i want to share
05:00 - with you guys in the future as well
05:01 - so it's not you know wasted work we're
05:04 - going to turn it into a meaningful
05:05 - tutorial and demo
05:07 - that we can present and hopefully you
05:09 - guys can learn from that as well
05:11 - alright thanks for watching i'll see you
05:12 - guys in the next video
