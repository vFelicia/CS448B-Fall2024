00:00 - hey there how's it going so recently I
00:02 - got an email from one of my core
00:04 - students asking how we can create this
00:06 - forum using Auto layout I'm here to
00:09 - deliver so let's do it
00:11 - so here I've got a brand new Xcode
00:14 - project we're in the storyboard I'm
00:16 - going to show you how to build the form
00:17 - using stack views so first we're going
00:20 - to search for stack view we're going to
00:21 - use a vertical stack view and then we
00:24 - are going to I just add a margin to it
00:29 - all four sides doesn't really matter
00:31 - what you put right now that can be
00:32 - adjusted later but the strategy we're
00:34 - going to take is each row in this form
00:37 - is going to be a horizontal stack view
00:39 - containing a label and the text field
00:41 - and then so they're going to be five of
00:43 - these horizontal stack views all of them
00:45 - are going to be put together into a
00:47 - vertical stack view so so far we have
00:50 - the vertical stack view I'm just going
00:51 - to rename it here so it's easy for you
00:54 - to see I'm going to drag this horizontal
00:56 - stack view into the vertical stack view
00:58 - so you have something that looks like
00:59 - that and maybe we'll just call this like
01:02 - row stack for you and then next we want
01:06 - to add a label and a text field now I'm
01:09 - not going to drag it into the storyboard
01:10 - because it might be a little hard to see
01:12 - I'm going to drag it directly into the
01:15 - document outline search for text field
01:19 - put it in there now you should have
01:21 - something that looks like this when you
01:22 - collapse the row stack view it should
01:24 - contain those two elements and when you
01:26 - collapse the vertical stack view the
01:29 - horizontal one should be tucked into it
01:31 - now what this gives us is one row and
01:36 - it's stretched out for the entire length
01:38 - of the vertical stack view I'm actually
01:41 - going to give a height to this row stack
01:43 - view because even though I give it a
01:45 - height it's still going to work for
01:46 - multiple orientations because as the
01:48 - screen gets wider it's going to stretch
01:50 - width wise but I don't necessarily want
01:52 - it to get taller like it does now this
01:56 - looks ridiculous right to have a text
01:57 - field that tall so I'm going to click on
02:01 - the row stack view and I'm going to add
02:04 - a height to it I'm just going to make it
02:07 - 30
02:08 - so notice that I'm adding the height
02:11 - constraint to the roast a few and not
02:13 - the textfield itself this way both the
02:16 - label in the text field inside will
02:18 - conform to this height that I've set on
02:21 - the horizontal stack view the next thing
02:23 - I want to do is highlight this row stack
02:25 - view I'm going to duplicate it a couple
02:27 - of times you can do that by pressing
02:28 - command D so I'm gonna do it four more
02:32 - times because we have a total of five
02:33 - rows and now I'm gonna highlight these
02:35 - four and I'm going to drag it underneath
02:38 - the vertical stack view now you have to
02:39 - be careful not to drag it into the wrong
02:41 - place
02:42 - but if you do you can just rearrange it
02:45 - again so now we have all five row stack
02:48 - views inside this vertical stack view
02:50 - and there are a whole bunch of errors
02:53 - but don't worry about them for now and
02:55 - the next thing we want to do is add some
02:57 - spacing between each row stack view so
03:00 - let's go ahead and change the spacing on
03:02 - the vertical stack view so let's just
03:04 - say 10 and for each horizontal stack
03:09 - view I want to add some space between
03:10 - the label and the text field so we're
03:13 - gonna highlight them all like that and
03:14 - hit 10 for the spacing so now we get
03:17 - something that looks like this
03:19 - the next thing we want to do is going to
03:22 - be customizing the text of the labels to
03:25 - match this so we have host port username
03:28 - password and type and then we're also
03:30 - going to fill in some of these now this
03:32 - is a placeholder text this is an actual
03:35 - piece of text in this text field
03:38 - placeholder placeholder and nothing in
03:40 - here so host port username password and
03:43 - type so let's see if I can remember this
03:47 - we've got host and the text field is
03:52 - 10.10 10.10 or me down - dot-com now you
03:58 - can't see that placeholder text there
04:00 - right now but it is there when you run
04:02 - it in the simulator you'll see it this
04:05 - is port and the actual text so don't put
04:10 - it in placeholder text 0 this guy was
04:16 - user name don't worry that the text
04:19 - fields are of different sizes and widths
04:22 - this placeholder text was admin this
04:27 - label was password and this placeholder
04:32 - text was a couple of stars make sure you
04:36 - also enable secure text entry for the
04:38 - password and you can see that it's
04:39 - indicated by that dot there this label
04:42 - was type and there was no placeholder
04:45 - text or default text now we want to make
04:48 - sure that all of these text fields are
04:50 - aligned and the same width so what we do
04:53 - is we take the the label with the
04:56 - longest width so that would be username
04:58 - and we're going to have all of these
05:01 - other labels have equal widths with the
05:05 - username label so an easy way to do that
05:09 - is hold down ctrl on this host label
05:12 - click and drag and you're gonna see this
05:14 - blue line drag it to the user name label
05:16 - let go and you're gonna be able to
05:18 - select equal widths and as you can see
05:20 - there the host label has an equal width
05:23 - what the user name label now and then
05:25 - the text fields will be aligned so we're
05:27 - gonna do the same thing with port equal
05:30 - widths and password make sure you're
05:33 - selecting the right element it's really
05:35 - easy to get confused here and
05:37 - accidentally select the wrong one and if
05:40 - you do then you can simply look for the
05:42 - constraint and here and then delete it
05:46 - alright so now we have this form here
05:48 - and we can view it in a couple of
05:52 - different orientations maybe let me zoom
05:54 - out so we can do that you can see here
05:57 - that I want the width to stretch but I
06:01 - don't necessarily want the text fields
06:03 - to get taller that's why I have that
06:06 - high constraint there so you can see
06:08 - that even on smaller screen sizes
06:22 - okay so even on an iPad it would look
06:31 - like that where the text fields are
06:32 - stretching now one thing is if we wanted
06:39 - let me change the device back to an
06:41 - iPhone first if we wanted this form to
06:48 - be kind of at the bottom like the the
06:51 - other screen had this image I mean what
06:55 - we could do is actually just remove this
06:59 - constraint that says that this vertical
07:01 - stack view needs to be 20 from the top
07:03 - if we removed that then there is no
07:06 - constraint saying that and it can stick
07:09 - at the bottom or actually what we could
07:11 - do is take that top constraint and
07:13 - instead of deleting it you can change
07:16 - the relationship instead of equals 20
07:19 - you can say that it can be greater than
07:21 - or equal to and you'll still have this
07:23 - constraint but this will be a flexible
07:25 - constraint so it can be more than 20 but
07:29 - these left right and bottom will be 20
07:32 - now if you have the form down here you
07:34 - have to be careful because when you are
07:36 - typing into these text fields you're
07:38 - gonna have the keyboard slide up and
07:40 - it's going to cover the form I'm not
07:42 - gonna cover how to animate the form up
07:44 - in this video bye do you have another
07:46 - video that talks about that and how to
07:48 - implement that sort of functionality
07:50 - where this form will slide up if the
07:52 - keyboard slides up so I'll link to that
07:54 - video in the description or you'll see a
07:56 - little banner at the top right now
07:57 - linking you to that exact video to do
07:59 - that functionality so that's it if you
08:02 - like this video please subscribe so you
08:04 - don't miss any upcoming tutorials thanks
08:07 - and I'll see you guys in the next
08:08 - tutorial
