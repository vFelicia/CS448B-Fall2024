00:00 - hey coke crew what's up in this video I
00:02 - want to share with you the top 11 skills
00:04 - you should have as an iOS developer if
00:06 - you want to maximize your chances to get
00:08 - an iOS developer job alright let's jump
00:11 - right in
00:16 - hi my name is Kris Ching and welcome to
00:18 - code with Kris where we teach people how
00:20 - to build apps now Before we jump into
00:22 - number 11 I just want to say one thing
00:24 - upfront and that is that if you're just
00:26 - starting out and you're just learning
00:27 - iOS with the intention of getting an iOS
00:30 - developer job in the future don't treat
00:32 - this list as something that you need to
00:35 - know before you start applying yes
00:37 - knowing everything on my list is going
00:39 - to help increase your chances of getting
00:41 - a job but you can always apply for a
00:44 - junior developer positions and a lot of
00:45 - these things that I named can be learned
00:47 - on the job just be honest and upfront
00:49 - about what you know and what you don't
00:51 - know and most employers will be more
00:53 - than happy to grow your skills if they
00:55 - sense that you're an enthusiastic
00:57 - learner and that you have a real passion
00:59 - for this stuff alright with that said
01:00 - let's start with number eleven
01:02 - networking and working with the api's
01:04 - these days it's going to be hard to find
01:06 - an app that doesn't do some sort of
01:08 - networking or download some sort of feed
01:10 - so that's why it's going to be really
01:12 - hard to get your dream iOS job if you
01:14 - don't even know what JSON is which is
01:16 - pretty much the standard format when it
01:18 - comes to working with data from api's or
01:20 - data feeds that also means that you
01:23 - should be familiar with your Apple
01:24 - networking libraries like URL session
01:26 - and popular third party in networking
01:28 - libraries such as Alamo Fire you should
01:31 - be able to parse your JSON using the
01:33 - codable protocol or json serialization
01:35 - number ten Grand Central Dispatch
01:37 - now many iOS developers can tell you
01:39 - differences between the main thread
01:41 - versus a background thread without
01:43 - really knowing much about Grand Central
01:45 - Dispatch but if you understand in their
01:48 - workings of iowa's concurrency then that
01:51 - is definitely going to give you a leg up
01:52 - when it comes to showing and
01:54 - demonstrating your expertise to the
01:56 - interviewer number nine working with
01:58 - databases now there are so many database
02:00 - options out there that it's hard to know
02:01 - them all
02:02 - however knowing some of them will be
02:04 - helpful for your resume and your
02:05 - interview my recommendation brush up
02:08 - your skills on some of the most popular
02:09 - databases to use with iOS apps
02:12 - number eight working with third-party
02:14 - libraries now some iOS development teams
02:16 - will swear not to use them because they
02:18 - don't want to rely on a third-party
02:20 - library but I think the majority of
02:23 - teams do use them the fact is that using
02:25 - a third-party library can speed up your
02:27 - development cycle tremendously I
02:29 - recommend going with time-tested
02:31 - consistently updated ones and that means
02:34 - that you should know how to integrate
02:35 - third-party libraries into your Xcode
02:37 - project using something like cocoa pods
02:39 - or the Swift package manager number
02:41 - seven unit testing if it's your first
02:43 - Iowa s development job and you've never
02:45 - worked in the team before you'll quickly
02:47 - realize how important unit testing is
02:49 - because multiple developers will be
02:52 - submitting code on top of each other and
02:53 - functionality is bound to break and if
02:56 - you discover it late it's going to be a
02:57 - nightmare to unravel that's why creating
03:00 - a test suite to validate the
03:01 - functionality of your app is so
03:02 - important as a professional developer in
03:05 - any programming language you should at
03:07 - least know how to write a test case
03:08 - number six source control and team
03:11 - collaboration tools team collaboration
03:13 - tools are going to be a must-have skill
03:15 - that employers are going to look for on
03:16 - your resume because chances are you're
03:19 - going to be working on an iOS
03:20 - development team so make sure you know
03:22 - your kit commands and spend some time
03:23 - working with github and bitbucket so
03:26 - that you can put it on your resume some
03:27 - iOS development teams will also make use
03:30 - of lint tools such as Swift lint to
03:32 - enforce a consistent coding style so if
03:35 - you've never used it before just spend
03:37 - an afternoon with Swift lint trying it
03:39 - out so that you can put it on your
03:40 - resume continuous integration with
03:42 - Jenkins bit riser circles CI is
03:44 - something that some development teams
03:46 - will use as well especially with large
03:48 - enterprise type of applications don't
03:51 - worry about it if you've never used them
03:53 - before that's something that you can
03:54 - definitely learn on the job but
03:56 - definitely read up on it so that you can
03:58 - speak intelligently about it in your
04:01 - interview if it happens to come up
04:02 - number five Xcode love it or hate it
04:05 - Xcode is still the most popular IDE when
04:08 - it comes to iOS app development now it
04:10 - can be pretty easy to pick up just by
04:12 - spending a few days learning the ins and
04:14 - outs of Xcode with some tutorials
04:16 - however Xcode does have some deeper
04:19 - features that takes years to master such
04:22 - as advanced debugging and
04:24 - using instruments to diagnose your app
04:26 - performance and mastering all of the
04:28 - Xcode shortcuts alright number four now
04:31 - you didn't think there would be a list
04:32 - and Swift wouldn't be on it right if
04:35 - you're just starting out and you're
04:36 - debating whether you should learn
04:38 - objective-c as well or maybe instead of
04:40 - Swift let me just tell you that Apple is
04:42 - going forward with Swift and that is
04:44 - what you should learn there are
04:45 - companies out there that are still
04:47 - looking for objective-c developers but
04:49 - that's usually to support some sort of
04:51 - legacy application that was built in
04:52 - objective-c years ago that has been
04:54 - passed down through lines of developers
04:57 - and you're going to be end up supporting
04:59 - or trying to fix bugs in that app and
05:02 - who wants to do that
05:03 - so objective-c can be a nice to have but
05:06 - definitely focus on Swift programming
05:08 - number three building user interfaces
05:11 - now you can't call yourself an app
05:13 - developer if you can't actually build an
05:16 - app right and half of the app is the UI
05:19 - the problem is that there are different
05:21 - ways to go about it you could use
05:23 - interface builder and storyboards you
05:25 - could build it programmatically and now
05:27 - you can use Swift UI as well between
05:30 - using storyboards and building your UI
05:31 - programmatically I would say that it's
05:33 - best to be able to do both now in my
05:36 - experience building the UI
05:37 - programmatically has been the way to go
05:39 - at the workplace but some workplaces use
05:42 - storyboards an interface builder as well
05:44 - and some use a hybrid approach combining
05:46 - both so it's in your best interest to
05:49 - know how to do it both ways and in
05:51 - regards to Swift UI it's still an infant
05:54 - technology and many companies aren't
05:57 - willing to invest in unproven technology
05:59 - that being said I do think Swift UI is
06:02 - an investment for your future because as
06:05 - we all know with what happened with
06:07 - Swift and objective-c when Apple decides
06:10 - that this is the way that's going
06:11 - forward everyone is going to follow suit
06:13 - so apple says Swift UI is the new thing
06:16 - it's in your best interest to learn it
06:18 - but just know that you might not be able
06:20 - to use this skill right now number two
06:24 - integrating design assets now chances
06:26 - are in the professional environment
06:28 - there will be a dedicated professional
06:30 - graphic designer
06:31 - that is
06:32 - to design how the app looks and give you
06:35 - the graphic assets to implement into
06:37 - your app now a good iOS developer is
06:39 - going to be able to identify which
06:42 - design elements actually needs a graphic
06:44 - asset and which ones can be styled
06:47 - programmatically and if there's ever a
06:49 - decision on which one to use if you can
06:51 - do it programmatically that's going to
06:53 - be preferred because it's going to be
06:54 - faster than loading images into memory
06:57 - as an iOS developer you should also be
06:59 - able to style Vanilla UI kit elements
07:01 - and create custom controls if you need
07:03 - to and number one know your design
07:06 - patterns in design patterns are simply
07:08 - just software development best practices
07:10 - and their programming language agnostic
07:13 - which means that these design patterns
07:15 - can be applied no matter what language
07:16 - you're using so learn your design
07:18 - patterns using best practices especially
07:21 - in a team environment is always a good
07:24 - thing
07:24 - now I listed these 11 skills in no
07:27 - particular order but knowing these ones
07:29 - will maximize your chances to get a job
07:31 - as an iOS developer now did I miss any
07:34 - do you agree or disagree please leave me
07:37 - a comment below and let me know and
07:39 - lastly this video is actually part of a
07:41 - larger piece of content on my website
07:42 - titled how to become an iOS developer
07:45 - and land your first job now in that
07:47 - article I have resources and links to
07:50 - learn all of the 11 skills that I
07:52 - presented today so if you're interested
