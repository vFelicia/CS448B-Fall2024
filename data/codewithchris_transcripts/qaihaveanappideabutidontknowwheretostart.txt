00:03 - hello and welcome to the code with Chris
00:06 - Q&A where I take a couple of minutes to
00:09 - answer questions that you guys have and
00:11 - today I have another question that I get
00:14 - a lot in my email and that is I have an
00:17 - app idea but I don't know where to get
00:19 - started that's actually a very open end
00:22 - question but I'll answer it the best I
00:25 - can the first thing I want to consider
00:27 - is whether or not you should learn how
00:30 - to code yourself because learning a new
00:33 - skill like programming especially if
00:35 - you've haven't gotten any experience in
00:37 - it before is quite daunting it's not
00:40 - impossible and it can be fun however
00:43 - it's not something that you can spend a
00:45 - couple of hours a week and then expect
00:46 - to pick it up you know in a month it
00:48 - requires some serious dedication just
00:50 - like if you're learning a new language
00:51 - or learning to pick up a new musical
00:54 - instrument so the first thing I want you
00:56 - to consider is how much time you have
00:57 - and also how much is your time worth to
01:00 - you so for example a lot of business
01:03 - owners when they ask this question they
01:05 - have an idea for an app for their
01:08 - business I would ask them if it's
01:10 - actually worth their time to learn how
01:12 - to program and then you know to code
01:15 - this app themselves and especially when
01:18 - you're first starting out the apps will
01:20 - be simple it will be you know amateur
01:22 - apps until you get better at it
01:24 - through time so is it worth all of that
01:27 - time investment to create an app that
01:29 - reflects that of a beginner or would it
01:32 - be more worth it for you to pay someone
01:35 - to create that f4u for your business
01:38 - especially and if you expect that app to
01:40 - bring in additional business then it
01:43 - could be worth it it could be more worth
01:44 - it to pay someone to do it rather than
01:46 - to learn it yourself especially if you
01:47 - know you're only learning it to build
01:49 - this one app and you have no intention
01:51 - of using the skill ever again of course
01:54 - there are lots of things to consider
01:55 - before you go hire someone to do it like
01:57 - your budget
01:58 - the added headache of having to manage a
02:00 - contractor or freelancer so yeah it's
02:03 - not a decision to be taken lightly
02:05 - however if you have decided to learn it
02:08 - yourself maybe you really want the skill
02:10 - or you want you know what a career
02:13 - or maybe you're just learning it as a
02:15 - hobby or to keep your skills sharp if
02:18 - you're a previous programmer in another
02:20 - language so if that's the case and you
02:23 - don't know where to start there's tons
02:25 - of resources online for you to learn in
02:27 - fact for free so Apple themselves
02:29 - provides the tool Xcode which you can
02:33 - download in the Mac App Store for free
02:34 - on your Mac and that is the tool the
02:38 - official Apple tool to build your iOS
02:41 - apps and next in order to write code in
02:45 - that application you need to know Swift
02:49 - so that's the name of the programming
02:51 - language and Apple provides a
02:53 - programming guide for that so you can
02:56 - you can read that for free it's a little
02:59 - technical in nature so if you're an
03:01 - absolute beginner you may not understand
03:04 - it the first time through but aside from
03:06 - that there are tons of websites out
03:09 - there with tutorials and beginner series
03:11 - and stuff like that where you can get
03:14 - your feet wet for free all you need is a
03:16 - Mac and that Xcode application which is
03:20 - also free and in fact on my site code
03:24 - with Chris comm if you go up to the very
03:26 - top start here there's a link called
03:28 - start here and on that page you'll find
03:31 - my beginner youtube series which will
03:34 - take you from knowing no programming at
03:37 - all to building a simple randomized by
03:40 - SAP and I think through that experience
03:42 - you'll learn basically how to create
03:46 - some interfaces write some logic and
03:47 - Swift code you'll probably hit a few
03:50 - roadblocks and overcome them
03:52 - so you know you'll learn how to overcome
03:54 - frustrations with learning programming
03:56 - and at the end you can decide whether or
03:59 - not you want to continue learning it'll
04:01 - probably take you a couple of hours to
04:03 - get through so yeah to circle back I
04:06 - have an app idea but I don't know where
04:07 - to get started so I think you should
04:09 - consider whether or not it's worth your
04:11 - time learning and what your goals are
04:12 - and if you do decide to learn then just
04:16 - very simply you know go to my website
04:19 - code with Chris calm and click start
04:21 - here at the top or Google beginner
04:23 - tutorials on how to build I Oh s apps
04:26 - there are tons of resources from there
04:28 - once you get your feet wet you're going
04:30 - to have questions on how to do this or
04:32 - how to do that and then from there
04:34 - let those questions lead how you learn
04:37 - and I think the biggest thing of all is
04:39 - if you're learning you need to set your
04:41 - own expectations to have some patience
04:43 - to learn a new skill
04:44 - because like I said it's almost like
04:47 - learning a new language or learning a
04:49 - new musical instrument you're not going
04:50 - to be very good at it in the beginning
04:52 - it's going to be hard might not be you
04:54 - know absolutely fun all the time but if
04:57 - you stick with it
04:58 - then it's definitely something that
05:00 - anyone can learn alright thanks for
05:02 - tuning in thanks for listening if you
05:05 - like this segment and you find that it's
