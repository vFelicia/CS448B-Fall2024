00:02 - here now I'm so excited to be finally
00:04 - able to say that we've launched our iOS
00:07 - curriculum for schools now this in
00:09 - particular hits really close to home for
00:11 - me because as some of you may know that
00:13 - I discovered programming back in school
00:16 - as a student so if it weren't for
00:18 - programs like these I wouldn't be where
00:20 - I am today now a handful of classrooms
00:23 - have already used our program to great
00:24 - success and now we're opening up to the
00:27 - public now there is a deadline which is
00:29 - in a few weeks to join our pilot program
00:32 - so if you're a student and you would
00:34 - love to see an iOS program in your
00:36 - school or if you're part of school
00:37 - administration or you know someone who
00:40 - is who might be interested if please
00:41 - visit the link below or forward this
00:44 - link to someone that you know if you
00:46 - visit that page it's going to have all
00:48 - of the details for this iOS curriculum
00:50 - and at the bottom of that page if there
00:53 - is going to be a contact form where you
00:54 - can get an information package which has
00:57 - all of the details for their curriculum
00:59 - and teacher support and the investment
01:02 - for this school and so on and so forth
01:03 - now there is one thing that I'll say and
01:06 - that is that even if you don't think
01:08 - that your school has the funds to invest
01:11 - into a new program I would still go
01:14 - ahead and fill out that contact form to
