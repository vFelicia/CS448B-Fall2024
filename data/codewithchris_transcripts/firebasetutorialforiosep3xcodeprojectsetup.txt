00:04 - hello welcome to lesson 3 of the
00:06 - firebase tutorial video series in this
00:09 - lesson we're going to create our Xcode
00:11 - project add the firebase SDK and the
00:14 - configuration file that we downloaded in
00:16 - the previous lesson here and we're going
00:19 - to make a connection to the firebase
00:22 - database from our iOS app let's begin by
00:25 - creating a new Xcode project so take
00:27 - note that the bundle identifier that we
00:31 - use to create this firebase app we're
00:33 - going to use the same one in our Xcode
00:36 - project when we create it so let's
00:38 - create a new Xcode project I'm going to
00:42 - create it as a single view application
00:44 - and the product name is messaging app
00:49 - and the bundle identifier is going to be
00:52 - constructed from the organization
00:55 - identifier so there's column code with
00:57 - Chris and it's going to say dot plus
01:00 - your product name so you can see here
01:02 - that actually it is different from the
01:06 - bundle identifier I put in here so let
01:09 - me go change that just to make sure that
01:12 - it is the same like that and the
01:15 - language you should be using is swift
01:16 - and just follow the settings that I have
01:19 - on the screen there but Swift is most
01:21 - important I'm just going to save it on
01:23 - my desktop pardon the mess and now that
01:27 - we have our brand-new Xcode project we
01:30 - can add that Google service - info.plist
01:33 - file into it all we need to do is drag
01:36 - it right below this info.plist so I have
01:39 - it on my desktop already just drag it
01:42 - and put it in there I would recommend to
01:45 - have this checked on copy items if
01:48 - needed because it's going to make a copy
01:50 - of that P list in your project folder so
01:53 - make sure that this is also checked it
01:56 - should be by default and click finish
01:58 - and now it's made a copy of this P list
02:03 - inside the project folder so if you
02:05 - saved your P list somewhere else like I
02:07 - do on my desktop here I'm just going to
02:09 - delete it just so I know that the actual
02:12 - P list is in the project
02:13 - folder and not the desktop because if
02:15 - you forget you may run into an instance
02:18 - where you need to update that P list and
02:20 - you think replacing it on the desktop is
02:22 - going to update it but it's not this one
02:25 - in your Xcode project is now a file in
02:28 - your project folder like this so it's
02:33 - right there this is the one you would
02:34 - need to replace not the one on the
02:37 - desktop or wherever you dragged it from
02:38 - alright so we've got that now the next
02:42 - thing we have to do is add the firebase
02:44 - SDK now there are a couple of ways to do
02:47 - it
02:47 - so let's go to the documentation there's
02:50 - a button here on your dashboard you can
02:51 - click on that it's going to fire it up
02:54 - and let's go to under for iOS to get
02:57 - started guide and we are at this point
03:03 - let's see so we've done all of this
03:06 - stuff we added the P list now we're
03:08 - adding the SDK so there are two ways to
03:11 - add it one way is that you can just
03:13 - download the SDK and it's just a bunch
03:16 - of files and then you can download them
03:19 - onto your desktop let me see where that
03:21 - is if I yeah so there's a section here
03:24 - integrate without cocoapods then you can
03:26 - download the SDK it's about a hundred
03:28 - megabytes and then you can unzip the
03:31 - file and then you can drag it into your
03:34 - project folder and then you have to add
03:36 - this this linker flag however there is
03:40 - an easier way to do it and that is using
03:43 - something called cocoa pods if you're
03:44 - unfamiliar with what that is well it's a
03:47 - dependency manager and what that really
03:50 - means in layman's terms is just that it
03:53 - helps you manage bits of reusable code
03:55 - that you can add into your project bits
03:59 - of code that are developed by other
04:01 - programmers or other companies that add
04:04 - features to your app and when they make
04:07 - updates to those bits of code you don't
04:09 - have to redownload the package and you
04:12 - know replace all these files in your
04:13 - project and kind of manage which
04:16 - packages are out of date or which
04:18 - packages are up to date
04:20 - instead with cocoa pods it does all of
04:22 - that for you so that sounds wonderful
04:24 - right another benefit is that it's
04:27 - actual
04:27 - pretty easy to set up and use I actually
04:29 - created another YouTube video just show
04:32 - you how to set up cocoapods on your
04:34 - machine if you don't have it set up
04:35 - already
04:35 - so I'm going to link to that in the
04:37 - description and also on the screen right
04:39 - now for a couple of seconds so you can
04:41 - go and watch that in order to set up
04:43 - cocoapods but let me also show you how
04:46 - you can do it right now
04:48 - very quickly so if you go to cocoapods
04:50 - org and scroll all the way down to
04:53 - install all you have to do is open up
04:55 - terminal on your laptop on your machine
04:58 - and type this command here so I can't
05:03 - actually do it because I've already got
05:05 - it installed or I could I could probably
05:07 - do it and it might just update cocoapods
05:10 - if there's a new version but after you
05:12 - do that it's going to ask you for your
05:14 - administrative password once you put in
05:16 - that it's going to download it might
05:19 - take a while so just go grab a coffee
05:22 - give it ten minutes come back and it
05:24 - should be finished and that's yeah
05:27 - that's basically it that's how you
05:28 - install cocoa pods if you actually want
05:30 - to see it in action and to see me
05:32 - install it then check out that YouTube
05:35 - video that I just link to ok so now I'm
05:37 - going to assume that you have cocoa pods
05:39 - installed and when you do go back to
05:42 - terminal you're going to want to jump
05:44 - into that folder your project folder and
05:47 - let me just navigate to it right now
05:50 - so you type LS to list out your files CD
05:54 - folder name to go into that folder and
05:58 - since it's on the desktop now this is my
06:03 - project folder here and I'm going to
06:05 - type in pod in it now when I go into my
06:11 - project folder I have this pod file here
06:14 - I'm going to open it up in my text
06:17 - editor which I use here sublime text you
06:21 - can use a different one
06:23 - just TextEdit and if all of this stuff
06:26 - is kind of over your head right now just
06:28 - be sure to watch that cocoa pods video
06:31 - that I linked to and if we go back to
06:34 - this documentation right here
06:39 - it says that you you do pod firebase
06:42 - slash core but we're going to want to
06:45 - also add a different one so let's add
06:47 - this one first so I'm going to copy that
06:49 - and inside the pod file which I opened
06:52 - you want to put it right here and if you
06:59 - scroll down a little bit actually click
07:05 - this link I want to add this one here as
07:08 - well for the real-time database okay I'm
07:16 - going to press command S to save the
07:18 - file and then I'm going to go back here
07:23 - to terminal and I'm going to do a pod
07:27 - install command and that's just going to
07:29 - read the pod file here and it's going to
07:32 - download these pods and it's going to
07:35 - install it it was really fast for me
07:37 - because it probably I probably already
07:41 - have those somewhere from working on
07:43 - these apps before before recording the
07:46 - video but for you it might actually take
07:48 - a while so again go grab a coffee come
07:50 - back in ten minutes it should be done
07:52 - and if I go back to the messaging app
07:54 - you can see that it's created all of the
07:57 - pods in here it's downloaded here and I
08:01 - have this new XC workspace file which is
08:04 - the one that I open from now on and not
08:06 - the Xcode project so let's open that up
08:10 - I'm going to close close that okay let
08:17 - me close everything first and open the
08:20 - XC workspace there we go now usually
08:25 - what I do i press command B to just
08:27 - build the project to make sure that it
08:29 - still builds and we're going to now want
08:37 - to add the the initialization code which
08:41 - if we go back up a little bit next step
08:43 - is to initialize firebase in your app so
08:46 - what we're going to want to do in the
08:48 - app delegate is import firebase so we
08:52 - can start using its
08:53 - and we call this this type method called
08:58 - configure on this fire app class it's Fi
09:02 - our app I'm just going to call it fire
09:04 - app I'm not sure that's the way you
09:06 - pronounce it though so going back into
09:08 - our project we're going to go into the
09:10 - app delegate that Swift we're going to
09:13 - import import firebase here and in here
09:20 - in the did finish launching with options
09:22 - but before the return statement I'm
09:26 - going to do fi our app dot configure and
09:31 - just like that we're done now we can
09:34 - start reading and writing data to our
09:37 - firebase database if we go back to the
09:39 - console here but before we do that we're
09:42 - going to have to in the next lesson
09:44 - build the user interface for our
09:46 - messaging app and then I'm going to
09:48 - explain to you guys how the data is
09:50 - stored in the database and then we're
09:52 - going to get to actually reading and
09:54 - writing data to the database so thanks
09:56 - for watching and if you liked the video
