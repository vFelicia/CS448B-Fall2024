00:12 - hey guys can you see me can you hear me
00:16 - let me know in the chat below just so we
00:19 - know things are working out and we'll
00:21 - get started in just a minute
00:38 - hey guys can you hear me and hopefully
00:44 - you guys can all see my screen as well
00:54 - I'm super excited today to start this
00:57 - livestream because we're actually going
01:01 - to start an app from start to finish and
01:03 - this is not planned out this is I
01:05 - haven't built this out before there are
01:07 - things that I haven't figured out myself
01:09 - I don't know if this app idea that I
01:12 - have exists so we're gonna go through
01:14 - all of those steps together but I just
01:17 - want to wait a couple more minutes for
01:19 - people to join and we'll get started
01:21 - hey guys hey Chris hey Musa Angela
01:26 - Prakash hey Musa you should actually be
01:38 - able to see my screen I just have a
01:41 - quick agenda on there you guys should
01:43 - all be able to see my screen right now
01:45 - if you can't try refreshing the page I
01:48 - don't know but I am sharing my screen
01:49 - right now I am optimal if you have
01:56 - Windows 10 you have a couple of options
01:57 - we actually have an article for PC users
02:01 - and kind of the options that they have
02:02 - so Adrienne will send that link all
02:06 - right so let's get started if you guys
02:07 - don't know me my name is Chris this is
02:11 - the first time you're on the channel
02:12 - welcome to code with Chris where we
02:13 - teach people how to build iOS apps
02:16 - basically Adrienne is manning the chat
02:20 - and so please be nice to him send in
02:24 - your questions one by one and don't
02:25 - break up your messages into multiple
02:27 - messages and that's gonna help him be
02:29 - able to make sure all your questions get
02:31 - answered but in this live stream I don't
02:34 - know if we'll have a Q&A time we might
02:37 - this is gonna run for an hour and I'm
02:40 - not really gonna be teaching so much as
02:43 - showing in this live stream because like
02:45 - I said this live stream we're gonna
02:47 - start by taking an app idea that I have
02:51 - explain what it is we're gonna look into
02:53 - the app store check out what sorts of
02:55 - apps are existing for this kind of idea
02:58 - maybe check their reviews to see if
03:01 - people complain about certain things
03:02 - we're gonna go through some features and
03:05 - requirements and again this is all from
03:07 - scratch so I haven't I don't have these
03:10 - listed out beforehand I haven't given it
03:12 - any thought so there's gonna be some
03:15 - audience participation right you're
03:17 - gonna be able to suggest features for me
03:19 - for this app we're going to discuss mmm
03:24 - sort of which features should make it
03:25 - into the first version of the app which
03:28 - feature should be like a later phase and
03:30 - I'll show you how I break things up so
03:32 - that mmm I aim to get the project
03:36 - complete and out the door
03:37 - rather than trying to get the whole
03:40 - thing polished and perfect right and
03:42 - super duper feature full before shipping
03:45 - it that's not the way that I think we
03:47 - should work but I'll explain all of that
03:49 - later and then I'll talk about some of
03:50 - the challenges that I foresee with
03:52 - building this app some of the things
03:55 - that I still need to figure out some of
03:57 - the things that I've already figured out
03:59 - like I've done in the past so it
04:01 - shouldn't be a roadblock for me and I
04:04 - think that even though I don't have
04:06 - everything figured out that's that's why
04:08 - I'm doing this so I think it'll be very
04:09 - helpful for you guys to see that
04:11 - building an app isn't like isn't always
04:14 - a smooth process right it's a bumpy road
04:15 - and even for someone like me who you
04:18 - know I was doing it professionally in IT
04:20 - consulting for like five years it's
04:23 - still there's still things to figure out
04:25 - because there's always new features in
04:27 - the SDK there's you know things like
04:30 - even things I've done in the past
04:31 - I don't remember sometimes right so I
04:34 - have to go back and nowadays Google is
04:37 - awesome
04:38 - and having this resource and having all
04:40 - of these people create all of this
04:42 - content for iOS development and then all
04:45 - of the documentation available online
04:47 - it's great like I know some of the
04:49 - people who have been in the tech
04:50 - industry for a while and back then
04:52 - before you know before the internet so
04:56 - widespread we would have to dig through
04:59 - text books and try hopefully try to find
05:03 - the solution to your problem
05:04 - by just flipping through pages of thick
05:07 - tech book tech textbooks and relying on
05:10 - more senior people in the company to
05:13 - perhaps have encountered that problem
05:15 - before and help you solve it but these
05:18 - days development I think has changed a
05:21 - lot where as you can use Google and find
05:24 - your answers hopefully within minutes oh
05:26 - really do utilize that and I am going
05:28 - off on a tangent so I'll stop talking
05:30 - about that but let's get started with
05:33 - unveiling my app idea for this big
05:37 - project and it's basically a Pomodoro
05:40 - timer so if you know if you know what
05:42 - that is there are a ton of Pomodoro
05:45 - timer apps in the App Store already I
05:47 - can tell you that right now and I'll
05:50 - explain what Pomodoro is in a second for
05:53 - those of you guys who don't know but my
05:56 - idea for a Pomodoro timer and it's not
05:58 - an original idea is to integrate social
06:02 - features into the Pomodoro timer so that
06:05 - you can connect with friends like you
06:09 - can add friends to your account and then
06:12 - you guys can see each other's like
06:15 - Pomodoro's how many Pomodoro you have
06:17 - completed during that day so you can
06:19 - motivate each other and can challenge
06:21 - each other to do more Pomodoro's now
06:24 - before I get too far ahead of myself for
06:27 - those of you guys who don't know what
06:28 - the Pomodoro Technique is let me just
06:31 - explain very very quickly and I actually
06:33 - found a graphic on on Google and it
06:37 - talks about it like really really
06:40 - succinctly a Pomodoro timer is basically
06:43 - a timer what so let me back up the
06:46 - Pomodoro Technique I don't even know who
06:50 - developed it but if you google it there
06:52 - was a guy who invented this technique
06:54 - but basically overall revolves around
06:56 - productivity and how to stay productive
07:00 - so the idea works like this you set a
07:03 - timer for 25 minutes and during those
07:05 - twenty five minutes you remove all
07:07 - distractions you just focus on that one
07:10 - thing that you're doing for 25 minutes
07:12 - your timer is going to go off at the end
07:15 - of 25 minutes at that point
07:16 - take a short break which is a
07:18 - five-minute break so for five minutes
07:20 - you just you know get up stretch
07:22 - whatever and then you do another
07:25 - Pomodoro for 25 minutes same task until
07:30 - you get it done so you keep repeating
07:33 - this process you know twenty-five
07:35 - minutes of work five minutes of break
07:36 - until you reach for Pomodoro so you've
07:38 - worked for a hundred minutes then you
07:41 - take a longer break and they recommend a
07:44 - 15-minute break I think for a long break
07:46 - but there is some flexibility and how
07:50 - you use the system so you can you know
07:53 - you can take a longer break as long as
07:55 - you want and then you get back to it so
07:57 - the idea is that a it helps you remove
08:00 - all distractions because your mind
08:02 - thinks oh for twenty-five minutes I just
08:04 - have to do this task for 25 minutes and
08:06 - it makes it easier to start right for
08:09 - something that you really really don't
08:10 - want to do and you're procrastinating if
08:12 - you just think I'm just gonna do 25
08:15 - minutes and then once you get into it
08:17 - you just obviously you do more and more
08:19 - until it's done
08:20 - number two it helps you estimate tasks
08:22 - because if you do that task a lot and
08:26 - you're setting your Pomodoro timers
08:29 - you'll be able to then better estimate
08:34 - how long like how many Pomodoro's that
08:37 - task will take and so you can break up
08:40 - your workday if you have like eight
08:41 - hours or six hours or whatever you can
08:43 - then gauge better how much work you can
08:47 - actually fit in so that's the whole idea
08:50 - of the Pomodoro Technique what I've been
08:52 - using myself is this website called
08:55 - tomato timer and it's like the most
08:58 - basic website you will ever find for
09:01 - this sort of thing but it works and
09:03 - that's why I use it so all you do is you
09:07 - hit start the timer goes for 25 minutes
09:09 - and when those 25 minutes are up it
09:11 - beeps and then you just stop it you
09:14 - reset it and then you go to this tab
09:16 - where it's going to give you a
09:17 - five-minute break then you take your
09:19 - 5-minute break and you go back to the
09:20 - Pomodoro for 25 minutes and after you've
09:22 - done four of them you take a long break
09:24 - so personally when I use this Pomodoro
09:27 - Technique to try to stay productive
09:28 - I don't keep track of how many
09:30 - Pomodoro's I've done I mostly use this
09:35 - as a way to remove distraction because
09:40 - in my mind I'm like I just have to focus
09:42 - for twenty five minutes and also as a
09:45 - motivator to do things that I don't
09:47 - really want to do and if I didn't have
09:49 - anything like this I would just put off
09:51 - those things continuously so I think we
09:53 - all have tasks like that so personally I
09:58 - find this very useful and I know there
10:00 - are apps out there there's like a ton of
10:02 - apps in the App Store for this sort of
10:04 - simple time work but I don't think there
10:06 - is one which has these social features
10:09 - integrated where you can kind of chair
10:11 - each other on and be like oh how many
10:13 - palma doors that you do how many did i
10:14 - do and then just help each other stay
10:16 - productive and again this is not my
10:20 - original idea I was reading a blog post
10:22 - from it was on search engine
10:25 - optimization and this guy he uses
10:27 - Pomodoro timers religiously and one way
10:31 - that he stays so productive is that he
10:34 - he has a partner which he works with and
10:37 - they chat through the messages app and
10:40 - they basically they just tell each other
10:42 - how many Pomodoro's they did and it kind
10:45 - of because they have a competitive
10:46 - nature they kind of spur each other on
10:48 - to do more and so he was he was saying
10:51 - like he can't find anything out there
10:53 - for this sort of social twist to the
10:58 - Pomodoro Technique and if someone were
11:00 - to create it then he would be the first
11:02 - to use it and so that kind of gave me
11:03 - the idea and I think it it would be
11:05 - useful like even if no one paid me any
11:07 - money to do it I think I would use it so
11:11 - that's that's kind of my motivation I'm
11:13 - not doing this for money or anything and
11:16 - I thought that this would be also a
11:18 - great project to share with you guys to
11:21 - go on this journey and take this idea or
11:24 - I build it out submit it to the app
11:26 - store build like a website for it just
11:30 - basically go through the whole thing and
11:31 - you guys can experience all of the ups
11:33 - and downs and the roadblocks and the
11:35 - challenges and I think that's what some
11:37 - of you guys said that you wanted to see
11:39 - and I thought it was a really good idea
11:41 - actually
11:42 - with that because there are a ton of iOS
11:44 - tutorials out there right but what's the
11:46 - problem with all of this knowledge it's
11:49 - that it relies on the reader or the
11:51 - watch or the viewer right to take that
11:53 - knowledge and turn it into practice
11:56 - right be practical with it because just
12:00 - consuming content just reading just
12:02 - watching it doesn't help you get
12:04 - anything done and unless you turn that
12:06 - knowledge into wisdom through doing the
12:10 - work right that's that's the point where
12:14 - that knowledge actually gives you
12:16 - dividends and gives you like a return on
12:20 - return on investment yeah
12:23 - so hopefully this candid real journey of
12:28 - me building this app and showing you
12:32 - guys all of the steps and processes
12:34 - helps you guys understand what it's
12:37 - really like
12:38 - all right behind the curtains and
12:39 - hopefully it inspires you guys to start
12:41 - now in the beginning of next month in
12:46 - the beginning of November I'll be it's
12:49 - kind of not hosting but I'll be starting
12:51 - like a challenge like an app challenge
12:53 - and I think I've talked about this in
12:55 - the previous livestream where I want to
12:57 - get as many people who feel comfortable
12:59 - building apps no matter how simple they
13:00 - are to be involved and the goal is to
13:04 - try to build and ship an app within a
13:06 - month and I think that's completely
13:07 - doable as long as your scope isn't like
13:09 - out to space right if you pick something
13:11 - that's gonna be doable for your skill
13:13 - level I think that's totally doable and
13:15 - I think the point is not to make money
13:19 - or not to you know not to do anything
13:21 - like that the point is to get into the
13:23 - practice of actually producing stuff
13:25 - actually putting into practice what
13:27 - you're learning and actually shipping
13:29 - products because I think you know
13:33 - there's this there's this sort of danger
13:35 - of always tweaking something and trying
13:38 - to get it perfect or always just working
13:39 - on designs and prototypes and
13:41 - daydreaming about stuff right that's not
13:45 - until you actually ship something and
13:46 - maybe get some feedback on it that we're
13:48 - we're you know that you're either onto
13:51 - something or maybe you should close the
13:55 - door on that
13:55 - so got that's gonna be the challenge
13:58 - starting November 1st and for those of
14:00 - you guys who aren't at the skill level
14:02 - where you feel like you can build
14:03 - anything yet
14:04 - I'll have another learning path for you
14:06 - guys to take for the next 28 days where
14:09 - you can get yourself up to speed so
14:11 - that's all coming up and really excited
14:13 - about that but anyways now that we have
14:15 - the intro out of the way let's get
14:17 - started with the next part which is uh
14:20 - so I've told you about my app idea the
14:23 - next part I wanted to do with you guys
14:24 - it's actually just check out the App
14:25 - Store now I've downloaded a couple of
14:28 - the Pomodoro timers by couple I actually
14:30 - mean two and one I found really
14:33 - confusing to use I feel like a timer
14:35 - should just when you launch it you
14:38 - should be able to just see a start
14:39 - button and start it but some of these
14:41 - are actually the way that they've done
14:43 - the user interface is actually a little
14:45 - bit confusing so what I'm gonna do is
14:47 - I'm gonna plug in my phone and hopefully
14:49 - I can show it on the screen we're gonna
14:50 - check out the app store see what's
14:52 - available and hopefully I don't see a
14:54 - Pomodoro timer which already has the
14:56 - social features included because as I
14:59 - didn't look very hard and as far as I
15:02 - know it doesn't exist so we're gonna
15:04 - check that out let me plug in my phone
15:05 - right here alright so hopefully you guys
15:13 - can see my phone see it on the screen
15:16 - right now
15:23 - okay so in case you guys were wondering
15:27 - the app is not going to be submitted to
15:29 - the App Store today
15:30 - right today we are starting the journey
15:32 - to do this so I think by the end of this
15:35 - livestream we will have a list of
15:38 - requirements flushed out the bare
15:43 - minimum requirements to submit to the
15:45 - App Store as an MVP or Minimum Viable
15:46 - Product and I'll be able to tell you
15:50 - guys about what my next steps are in
15:52 - terms of figuring out some of the
15:53 - challenges that are gonna exist for me
15:57 - all right so I'm looking in the App
15:59 - Store here I'm gonna do a search for I'm
16:08 - just gonna search for the more general
16:09 - term just to see what comes up so focus
16:13 - keeper is one which I actually
16:16 - downloaded and this is the one which I'm
16:19 - currently using the nice thing about
16:20 - this one is that it has all of these
16:23 - nice graphs and I really like the idea
16:26 - of it logging how many Pomodoro's you've
16:30 - done and being able to see over time the
16:33 - work that you've done because that's one
16:35 - thing that I'm not doing right now I
16:36 - just use the timer I turn it I time it
16:39 - and I stop it and I just use that tomato
16:42 - timer I showed you doesn't keep track of
16:43 - any history so just by using the app
16:46 - which I've been using this one for the
16:48 - last maybe a couple of days it's nice to
16:51 - be able to keep track of that so this
16:55 - one is pretty easy to use right it's got
16:58 - a start start and a stop but this one
17:00 - doesn't have any of the social features
17:01 - which which I'm targeting and that has
17:04 - some pretty good rating so what I would
17:09 - do is probably take a look at some of
17:12 - the reviews and see what people do like
17:13 - about it and hopefully try to emulate
17:15 - some of those features into the app that
17:18 - we're building right now
17:22 - so there's that
17:31 - yeah this is another kind of like
17:34 - version I guess of a Pomodoro timer but
17:37 - it's not it's not really based off of
17:38 - the Pomodoro Technique for timers like
17:40 - this it's basically like you set the
17:44 - time that you want to work and if you
17:46 - take your phone and try to do something
17:48 - else with it like go on Facebook or
17:50 - whatever then the tree that you're
17:52 - growing is gonna die so the motivation
17:54 - is to stay focused is to not kill your
17:58 - tree so I want to consider this to be a
18:01 - Pomodoro timer it's a Productivity tool
18:04 - but the Pomodoro timer and this one here
18:10 - this one's just in Chinese it's not
18:14 - really my target market but I think it
18:16 - looks like at a bare minimum you've got
18:19 - the timers and then you've got charts
18:21 - right to keep track of how much you've
18:24 - worked which definitely we we should
18:28 - have
18:38 - and some of these some of these as well
18:42 - they're not just Pomodoro timers they're
18:45 - also like to-do lists and there are gold
18:47 - trackers and stuff like that and
18:49 - personally this is my personal opinion I
18:51 - feel like if your app tries to do too
18:55 - much it's gonna be convoluted and it's
18:59 - gonna be more confusing to use and so
19:01 - when I built this Pomodoro timer app
19:03 - it's purely going to be for the Pomodoro
19:06 - Technique and I'm not gonna try to put
19:09 - to-do lists or goals or anything like
19:11 - that and then we're gonna have the
19:13 - social aspect all based around the
19:15 - Pomodoro that you complete
19:25 - see this one has habit training and mono
19:29 - tasking I wouldn't call this like a pure
19:33 - Pomodoro Technique either
19:42 - based on the Pomodoro Technique yeah
19:45 - make a to-do list now
19:55 - Rustom how to quit learning how to quit
19:59 - the learning regimen and start doing
20:00 - your own project so you you just got
20:04 - that you just got to start but I know it
20:07 - can be confusing as to where to start
20:09 - and so I do have a learning plan that
20:13 - I'm going to come up with starting
20:15 - November 1st that's gonna be free for
20:17 - everyone to use and it's gonna basically
20:18 - be like day one you do that stay tuned
20:20 - you do this and you just follow that and
20:21 - hopefully that motivates you guys to
20:23 - actually do stuff rather than just
20:25 - continually learning because I know it
20:26 - can be tempting to just watch like ten
20:28 - videos and then you know back-to-back
20:31 - like a Netflix binging session but
20:33 - that's not really helpful creative
20:38 - rewarding daily have a routine you know
20:40 - what I don't see anything yeah okay this
20:43 - was the other one that I've used flat
20:44 - tomato I downloaded this one I found it
20:47 - really hard to use I didn't didn't
20:50 - really understand because the the
20:52 - interface was so minimal that when I
20:55 - launched it I saw this clock face but
20:58 - there were no like buttons to tell me
21:00 - what to press or what actions to take
21:03 - and I found it really confusing to use
21:07 - but it still got has pretty good rating
21:10 - so maybe I'm just dumb
21:15 - yeah all right so I'm kind of focus I'm
21:20 - sorry I'm kind of satisfied to me yeah
21:29 - see they're a ton of these things but I
21:31 - don't think any of them have had this
21:35 - the sort of social feature it's all very
21:38 - like focused on your own to do the next
21:47 - thing to do I'm not going to do with
21:50 - this right here because it's it's a
21:51 - little mind-numbing but it would be to
21:54 - go through some of the reviews for these
21:56 - apps and kind of see what people are
21:58 - saying about the app what did they like
22:00 - about it what do they don't like about
22:02 - it and that sort of knowledge will sort
22:07 - of guide you into what sorts of features
22:08 - that you should implement into your own
22:11 - app or maybe how to design the user
22:15 - interface of your app like if if a
22:19 - particular app has really good reviews I
22:21 - would suggest you download it and play
22:23 - around with it and see kind of how they
22:25 - did their UI and I want to say copy it
22:29 - but I would say let it guide you and
22:32 - your design when you're designing your
22:35 - own up and so I'm gonna I'm gonna move
22:38 - on now to writing out our own feature
22:41 - set for our app right here I'm just
22:46 - gonna minimize that and we're just gonna
22:49 - do this right here so I will just write
22:53 - it right here features and requirements
22:56 - see if you guys can see this on the
22:58 - screen
23:02 - all right so I would say and I'm gonna
23:07 - break this right right now into like a
23:11 - v1 youtube because I'm gonna tell you
23:15 - right now my v1 is going to be super
23:17 - simple because if you've seen my video
23:25 - right here which I released recently
23:28 - called finish your projects or five tips
23:31 - to help you complete your projects I
23:33 - recommend that you should take your
23:37 - overall feature set and break it down
23:39 - into an MVP that is manageable so what
23:42 - what is the minimum amount of core
23:45 - features your app needs to have to still
23:48 - be useful and so that's what I'm going
23:52 - to base it on to me
23:53 - this tomato timer on this website this
23:56 - is like the bare minimum I think that
23:58 - you need in order to follow the Pomodoro
24:00 - Technique so there's like no history
24:03 - there's no tracking there's no social
24:05 - features there's no charts nothing and
24:07 - so I'm gonna base my v1 off of something
24:10 - like this where you you literally just
24:13 - have three timers start and stop and
24:16 - reset and you know that that is
24:19 - literally it so my v1 is going to be
24:24 - something like we have the 25 minute
24:29 - timer right we have the five minute
24:34 - break timer and we have the long 15
24:38 - minute fifteen minute long break timer
24:43 - and I think in order for it to be useful
24:46 - as well as a Pomodoro timer is if like
24:52 - let's say you get a phone call or
24:53 - something pops up in your app and if
24:56 - you're really sticking to your Pomodoro
24:58 - Technique you're not supposed to be
25:00 - distracted by any of that but let's just
25:02 - say if you do and this app goes into the
25:05 - background I feel like it should still
25:07 - be tracking the time right so that it
25:10 - doesn't like pause the timer when your
25:12 - app goes into the background so I feel
25:14 - like
25:15 - as even as a v1 the app needs to keep or
25:20 - how about let's just say timer needs to
25:23 - continue to run in the background like
25:26 - if you've had if you have that timer set
25:28 - so that's one of the things that I
25:30 - actually don't know how to do but I know
25:32 - it can be done because obviously it can
25:35 - because everyone has these Pomodoro
25:37 - timer apps out there I just need to
25:39 - figure out how to do it and I'm sure
25:41 - it's not very hard because in order to
25:44 - run things in the background I do know
25:45 - that you need to enable certain
25:47 - capabilities for your app so I think it
25:50 - it's just that I think it's just
25:54 - specifying that your app needs to run
25:55 - timers or maybe schedule the reminder or
25:58 - something like that I just need to
26:00 - investigate that so that's one of the
26:01 - challenges but I'll get into that
26:14 - let me see if you guys have any
26:16 - suggestions okay so if you guys do have
26:24 - suggestions type it in now I am keeping
26:27 - track of the chat now
26:28 - so I mean just two future so I don't
26:34 - have to organize those but definitely
26:35 - social features right we're talking
26:37 - about ability for users to create an
26:41 - account also abilities ability for a
26:48 - user to use it as a guest so if people
26:53 - want to use the timer and not create an
26:55 - account and just use the app without the
26:57 - social features out I do want to allow
26:59 - that as well
27:01 - so there or let's say let's break this
27:03 - up into social features timer features
27:13 - so for this would be like ability to set
27:17 - or to customize the durations of breaks
27:23 - or work timers see what you guys are
27:27 - saying ability to set targets Martin
27:32 - maybe you can expand on what you mean by
27:34 - targets do you mean ah so you mean like
27:37 - a goal for how many Pomodoro's you're
27:39 - gonna do that date integration into
27:44 - messages maybe Kevin you can expand on
27:48 - that like in what way would would it
27:51 - integrate into the messages app like
27:53 - would you share your progress with
27:56 - someone through messages that what
27:57 - you're talking about
27:58 - okay Martin we yeah I'm gonna write that
28:00 - down so this would be like goal setting
28:07 - ability to set a daily goal for the
28:14 - amount of palms mom's the palms you're
28:19 - going to do call this sharing I have to
28:26 - merge some of this actually sharing we
28:28 - probably go into social ability to share
28:33 - your progress with others so this would
28:38 - be kind of like a share extension type
28:41 - of thing so that you can share it with
28:42 - messages or whatsapp or anything like
28:46 - that let me just type out some more of
28:48 - these ability for user to follow follow
28:53 - let's follow the right word or add as to
28:57 - add friends ability to like we would
29:02 - need user profiles right so that you can
29:03 - see how many Pomodoro's your friend is
29:06 - doing or something like that Billy to to
29:11 - view user profiles I think what would be
29:15 - very cool is like if you could issue
29:17 - challenges right like if you can have a
29:19 - running challenge with another person or
29:21 - maybe a group of people where you set
29:24 - you set a goal like oh every day you
29:26 - have to do like the goal everyone agrees
29:30 - on is like every day you have to do ten
29:31 - Pomodoro's or something and then whoever
29:34 - doesn't do it gets like kicked out of
29:36 - the group or dropped out and then like
29:38 - you can see who's left standing like
29:40 - king of the hill styles I don't know
29:42 - that's just an idea but I'm gonna write
29:43 - it down ability to issue challenges with
29:48 - a single person or group and we can
29:52 - elaborate on that needs more detail
29:57 - see what you guys are saying yeah Martin
30:05 - I agree yeah I agree with sending daily
30:08 - weekly targets I just don't want to get
30:12 - too far out there that this turns into
30:17 - kind of like a habit tracker as well
30:19 - because I want to stay really focused
30:21 - that this is just like a very strict
30:26 - Pomodoro timer but I might you know I
30:29 - might change my mind on that that's the
30:31 - way I feel right now but see this is the
30:34 - this is why we do an MVP right so we're
30:37 - gonna release the v1 it's a simple timer
30:39 - v2 we might add some of the social
30:41 - features and then depending on what
30:43 - people start saying if people start
30:44 - using this and saying like oh I wish I
30:46 - had this I wish I had that then we're
30:47 - gonna have to start evaluating what's
30:50 - best for the users because you do want
30:53 - to the idea is to iterate on this idea
30:56 - in this product to turn it into
30:58 - something that people love using oh I
31:05 - know now you're saying the long break is
31:07 - 30 minutes yeah I have to verify I have
31:09 - to verify that it might be 30 minutes
31:11 - you might be completely right I don't
31:13 - I'm not so sure if it might be 15
31:15 - minutes or not I'm just gonna say like X
31:18 - minute like what is the the long break
31:23 - that the Pomodoro Technique actually
31:25 - recommends I don't for me personally I I
31:28 - just take like X number of minutes I
31:31 - don't keep track of how long my break is
31:32 - I go off and do something and whenever
31:34 - I'm done taking a break I just come back
31:37 - and start another cycle of for
31:39 - Pomodoro's oh I don't really like that I
31:45 - really like the the messages like keep
31:48 - going the encouragement right
31:51 - Martin so the user profile is not going
31:54 - to be not not social profile it's gonna
31:58 - be like how many Pomodoro's have that
32:00 - has this guy done today and in you know
32:04 - in the last week or something like that
32:06 - so the idea is to keep each other come
32:09 - to stay productive and to to be doing
32:12 - work I'm gonna put Iona I'm gonna put
32:18 - your feature under goal setting so
32:21 - encouragement quotes
32:34 - yeah happy images
32:44 - so I've kind of decided that this is
32:47 - gonna be like v1 we can probably crank
32:49 - this out pretty quickly because I do
32:51 - like my goal is gonna be try to try to
32:54 - release this v1 by the end of the month
32:56 - so that when we start the app challenge
32:59 - on November 1st I can be ready to do
33:02 - like a phase 2 version of the app and
33:04 - I'm gonna use that as my month-long app
33:06 - challenge so I'm gonna keep v1 really
33:10 - simple and probably not very useful to
33:14 - be honest compared to all of the other
33:16 - Pomodoro timers out there but I don't
33:18 - really care I'm just gonna because I
33:21 - think mentally just getting it shipped
33:24 - getting it released in the App Store
33:26 - is a milestone in my head and that's
33:30 - gonna keep me motivated to do v2 right I
33:35 - think when we're talking about
33:36 - motivation like I run into the same
33:39 - problems as you guys do if if any of you
33:41 - guys suffer from that like I said before
33:45 - I have tons of half-done projects in a
33:48 - folder somewhere on my computer and I'm
33:52 - really scared to to publicly now right
33:54 - I'm doing this with you guys to cut the
33:58 - cord on this I don't really want to do
34:00 - that so I'm gonna set v1 to be very
34:03 - manageable to be something like I'm
34:05 - pretty confident like 99% that I can get
34:07 - this done and shipped and then we are
34:10 - going to improve on that from there so
34:15 - I'm I'm following my own advice guys in
34:18 - the five tips on how to finish your
34:20 - project follow my own advice here social
34:24 - features so you know I don't know if we
34:28 - have to decide on a v2 right now but I
34:30 - feel like if you two might be to be able
34:33 - to set durations like that seems pretty
34:38 - pretty necessary because everyone uses
34:41 - plummet or a little differently some
34:43 - people take longer breaks some people
34:44 - not and the social aspect like
34:47 - integrating the ability to create an
34:50 - account
34:50 - - like even even having to create an
34:55 - account requires a back-end so at this
34:58 - point we're getting into databases right
35:00 - and so that's compared to everything
35:04 - else that's a large part of work so it
35:10 - would be you also it would be useless to
35:13 - introduce the ability to create an
35:14 - account but that's it right oh I forgot
35:22 - so let me finish that train of thought
35:24 - so it would be useless to be able to
35:25 - create an account but not do anything
35:27 - with it so if we were to introduce this
35:30 - the ability to create an account we
35:31 - would have to also introduce the ability
35:35 - to like add friends and follow friends
35:37 - and maybe like like there you know maybe
35:41 - give them a thumbs up when they've
35:42 - completed a Pomodoro or something like
35:44 - that but I was about to say that we
35:47 - forgot a huge piece here and that would
35:49 - be like history I don't know if that's
35:56 - the right word but basically like
35:57 - tracking how much work you've done like
36:01 - keeping track of poems completed every
36:10 - day
36:13 - showing them in a graph oh I don't know
36:21 - why I'm capitalizing some of these
36:23 - ability to change date range on the
36:32 - graph so stuff like that like ability to
36:34 - manipulate the graph so that you can see
36:37 - how many you how many maybe Pomodoro's
36:42 - you've done in the last month versus the
36:44 - last week versus the last three days or
36:46 - whatever like that and maybe to be able
36:47 - to average it out so this definitely
36:50 - neat it needs more detail needs more
36:52 - thought around it but see doing this
36:57 - stuff doesn't require user accounts
36:59 - either so we can keep track of this data
37:06 - locally on their device right when they
37:09 - do create an account though we could
37:11 - with her sync that data somewhere so
37:14 - that if they logged in to that same
37:15 - account on another device or maybe
37:17 - they're using two devices at once or
37:19 - maybe in the future would create like a
37:20 - Mac app version of this app as well then
37:23 - the data can get synced into that same
37:25 - account so you know data syncing I
37:35 - actually don't know if this has an H or
37:37 - not I look right
37:42 - all right data syncing so ability to
37:49 - transfer data to another device or keep
37:55 - data in sync with another device let's
38:02 - see what you guys are saying right here
38:11 - oh you have tons of half-done online
38:15 - courses same with me
38:17 - same with me it's you know like life
38:19 - happens things come up it's tough it's
38:22 - tough in a hair Here I am like I'm I
38:27 - have online courses right hate for
38:29 - people so like first hand I know how
38:31 - hard it is to to make time for this
38:34 - stuff yeah I own a thumb I don't want
38:41 - this app to have to be connected to the
38:43 - Internet to work because it shouldn't
38:46 - right just only for the social features
38:49 - it would be yeah Kevin you're right so
38:56 - Kevin says the ability to categorize the
38:59 - palms that you work on whether that's
39:00 - for like school or work or maybe another
39:03 - cat look Billy Billy to set categories
39:05 - so that when you're looking at your
39:07 - history you can see how much work you've
39:10 - done in each category I think that that
39:13 - kind of goes with goal setting I think
39:15 - no timer features I put this under here
39:18 - ability to choose a category for the
39:24 - palm you're running
39:33 - and filter based on category
39:55 - Sofer Khan I'm sorry if I am butchering
40:00 - your name but he's saying the
40:02 - integration with github or bitbucket to
40:04 - buy in the palm with a repository to
40:06 - track how many hours of code in the repo
40:08 - that's interesting that's interesting
40:13 - just get help a bit okay track hours
40:17 - like that I'm actually not familiar with
40:18 - that but I'm gonna write it down I just
40:25 - could make a Miska category with I just
40:32 - say source control so just for us well
40:41 - the social feature work with teams like
40:43 - setting a timer for an entire team I've
40:46 - actually seen that done with this app
40:48 - called a forest which is a Productivity
40:51 - app that revolves around timers as well
40:53 - and I think they've just released a
40:56 - feature or maybe it's not recent but I
40:59 - recently discovered that they have a
41:01 - feature where you can like put your
41:02 - phones together and sync up a timer so
41:05 - like you said if coworkers are working
41:07 - together they have like a group timer
41:11 - and if anyone picks up their phone I
41:13 - think it kills it kills the tree or
41:15 - whatever they're trying to grow for for
41:18 - the whole team so it keeps the whole
41:20 - team focused but to answer your question
41:26 - just for I haven't I haven't thought
41:28 - about it whether it will work together
41:31 - as a team I'm gonna write that down
41:35 - but in my head right now
41:38 - I don't have any I don't have any I
41:43 - haven't thought about doing that
41:46 - so I'm gonna write that down
42:18 - okay let's build a million-dollar
42:23 - Pomodoro app you know what I haven't
42:27 - even thought about monetization I don't
42:29 - like I said my goal isn't to to make
42:32 - money from the app I honestly would just
42:37 - like to use it and I think that's the
42:39 - best motivation although it's kind of
42:44 - idealistic because people need money to
42:46 - survive so if we were to to charge money
42:49 - for it I don't know we could try
42:50 - different forms of monetization now that
42:52 - would be an interesting experiment
42:54 - experiment I think we should do it we
42:57 - should try like just because we're
43:00 - building this together I think you guys
43:01 - would all be interested to see like how
43:03 - much potential you know money we could
43:07 - make off of often releasing an app and
43:09 - monetizing it too right so there are so
43:13 - many different ways to monetize it but
43:15 - like one one way that comes to mind
43:19 - right now would be to be like have a
43:22 - banner with an in-app purchase to remove
43:25 - it let's say for pro version and then
43:28 - like you see apps telling people they
43:32 - could use it for free right but then pro
43:34 - version unlocks maybe like the history
43:37 - version aspect of it or anything else I
43:40 - do believe we cannot put the social
43:42 - features behind a paywall because that's
43:45 - kind of what is the differentiator for
43:47 - this app right without the social
43:50 - features then how is this any different
43:52 - from any of the other Pomodoro timers
43:55 - out there in the app store right now
43:57 - right I wouldn't say any
44:05 - yeah so I'm gonna have to take some time
44:07 - away to take a look at these features
44:10 - which we've talked about and come up
44:11 - with a v2 but I don't think I have to do
44:14 - that until closer to the end of the
44:16 - month I'm gonna focus on doing this part
44:19 - v1 which is pretty doable the only thing
44:22 - I need to figure out right is is this
44:24 - timer in the background and the next
44:26 - time I talk to you guys I'm gonna make
44:28 - it a goal to have figured that out so I
44:30 - can tell you guys what I had to do but
44:36 - the next steps
44:37 - traditionally let me bring up another
44:41 - video that I've done that's this one
44:44 - called the app design process and that
44:47 - basically just runs through the
44:50 - different steps typically taken in
44:53 - building an app so we have now completed
44:57 - like the first step which is basically
45:00 - to gather the requirements for the app
45:02 - and figure out the core MVP version the
45:07 - next step would be to wireframe it out
45:11 - so that you can design kind of like the
45:14 - UI for the for the app and then it would
45:19 - be designed and then it would be
45:20 - development and then integrating the
45:22 - design testing it and releasing it so me
45:25 - coming from as a developer the thing
45:29 - that I like to do all the time is I like
45:32 - to figure out all of the technical
45:34 - challenges first a guy I like to make
45:37 - sure that I can actually do all of these
45:40 - things before starting on the UI and the
45:43 - design and stuff like that because I
45:49 - feel like there's no point in designing
45:51 - an element or a feature if when it comes
45:56 - down to it I can't achieve it
45:58 - technically right so there's nothing
46:05 - here that
46:08 - like the this I told you guys I don't
46:11 - know how to do right now but I know it
46:13 - can be done so I'm not that worried
46:15 - about having to completely figure that
46:18 - out first right so in the next video in
46:23 - this sort of how to make an app from
46:24 - scratch series I'll be mocking up the
46:28 - screens for this version now I'm not
46:31 - gonna go ahead and wireframe all of the
46:34 - screens for like all of these features
46:35 - because we haven't really figured out
46:37 - exactly which features are gonna make
46:39 - the cut and in what order what I'm gonna
46:43 - be focused on is the timer screen
46:46 - because that's really the screen that
46:47 - people are gonna be spending the most
46:48 - time on right and I think that screen
46:52 - has a lot it has a huge impact on
46:55 - whether that person will use the app or
46:58 - not and this is based on my experience I
46:59 - told you guys I downloaded two Pomodoro
47:01 - apps I launched the first one I tapped
47:04 - on the timer it was confusing I started
47:07 - it and I didn't know how to stop the
47:09 - timer or pause the timer and like I was
47:11 - just trying to figure out how to use it
47:12 - and I just gave up and I just like
47:14 - closed the app and then launched the
47:15 - other one and simply for the fact that I
47:19 - it was easy for me to figure out how to
47:22 - start and stop that timer I ended up
47:24 - sticking with that app and using that up
47:26 - so that's why it's so important for for
47:31 - the UI at some of the other Pomodoro
47:34 - apps out there like I told you reading
47:36 - their reviews especially for the highly
47:38 - rated ones taking a look at maybe I can
47:43 - find a commonality in the UI for all of
47:46 - the highly rated ones that I'm gonna
47:48 - take those considerations into my own
47:51 - design process when I'm like wireframing
47:54 - that up so I'm gonna do that work
47:58 - offline however in the next video I am
48:01 - going to recreate the wireframe with you
48:06 - guys if if I've already done that so
48:09 - that I can show you guys how to use the
48:12 - graphic design tools to create a
48:15 - wireframe I'm not gonna just show up and
48:17 - be like hey guys I created the wireframe
48:19 - here you go
48:20 - this is then you guys want wouldn't be
48:22 - able to do that for your own apps right
48:24 - so in the next video or a livestream
48:28 - whatever it might be I will show you
48:32 - guys how to navigate around a graphics
48:35 - design tool and how to create some
48:37 - wireframes I'm in that tool and I will
48:42 - have figured out what my UI will look
48:43 - like so we'll build that wireframe of
48:47 - that v1 version together in that
48:49 - graphics tool and then from there
48:53 - all right well we'll build it out which
48:56 - is like I'm looking at it it's a pretty
48:59 - simple app and then we're gonna launch
49:02 - it together in the app store so you're
49:05 - gonna get to see you know the things
49:07 - that you're gonna be testing the things
49:10 - that the assets that you'll need will
49:13 - create the app icon launch screen and
49:15 - stuff like that and we'll publish it
49:17 - together and then starting in November
49:20 - when we're gonna when I'm gonna run that
49:22 - challenge we'll take a look at v2 for
49:24 - the app and yeah so hopefully you guys
49:27 - stick around and now we've got about 12
49:31 - more minutes I'm gonna take a look at
49:32 - what sort of questions you guys have if
49:34 - you have any questions oh sorry about
49:36 - that I will talk louder and into my mic
49:41 - I should move this mic sorry if you guys
49:43 - had trouble hearing me just now but let
49:46 - me take a look at your chat let's see if
49:50 - you guys have any questions for me
49:55 - well the November challenge have a have
49:57 - a theme do you think you guys would want
50:00 - a theme I don't want to restrict you
50:01 - guys to to building something so maybe
50:04 - maybe I could think of a theme that you
50:07 - can follow or not see yes this is how
50:10 - this is gonna be the first time that I'm
50:12 - doing this it might be a free-for-all
50:14 - this time because my ultimate goal is
50:17 - just to get people to do things right to
50:19 - get people off of their butt and to
50:21 - actually do something so I haven't yet
50:24 - formalized like what's sort of prizes or
50:27 - recognition there might be and there
50:29 - will be recognition for sure prizes for
50:33 - this first one I'm not
50:35 - but it I do plan for it to be a monthly
50:37 - thing and I want to just motivate people
50:40 - to to get off their butt to do stuff so
50:47 - if you guys have any questions for me
50:48 - just type it into the chat right now I'm
50:50 - just going through the chat mm-hmm Iona
50:57 - I missed this the speaker idea that you
51:00 - had which is changing the music or the
51:02 - alarm that sounds depending on the
51:05 - project you're working or maybe having
51:06 - an ability to customize that mm-hmm
51:10 - that's kind of cool women right write
51:11 - that down right here
51:32 - just for we use the Pomodoro Technique
51:34 - while developing your Pomodoro up you
51:38 - have my chest my chest
51:44 - maybe you guys let me know like how many
51:46 - of you guys have actually heard of about
51:48 - the Pomodoro Technique before and how
51:51 - many of you guys actually use it
51:52 - yourself
51:53 - I'd be interesting to hear because I
51:56 - think it's a pretty well-known technique
52:00 - Nelson thank you thank you for your
52:02 - compliment
52:18 - Lauren to ask storyboard or
52:20 - programmatically for the first little
52:22 - complex app it seems like I'm getting
52:24 - I've got this question once every live
52:26 - stream so you have to code well so could
52:31 - you have to sit maybe often uh yeah
52:33 - Lauren - to answer your question like
52:36 - really quickly because I have answered
52:37 - this question before maybe I need to do
52:40 - a video on it but for beginners I would
52:47 - recommend using the storyboard because
52:50 - it's just so much easier to be able to
52:52 - visualize and especially when people
52:54 - aren't beginners aren't used to reading
52:56 - code yet or writing code even it can be
52:59 - daunting to create all your auto layout
53:01 - constraints in code and to create all of
53:03 - your elements and code and lay them out
53:05 - but if you're working in a team in a
53:07 - professional environment you're you will
53:11 - probably be forced to create everything
53:13 - programmatically because in my own
53:16 - experience it's working in the
53:18 - professional environment it's just so
53:19 - much easier to merge code like and
53:22 - resolve conflicts programmatically then
53:25 - trying to resolve conflicts in the next
53:27 - ML file which is what the storyboard is
53:29 - and then also there's the aspect that
53:31 - it's faster when you're generating
53:34 - everything programmatically so to answer
53:37 - your question I think they kind of serve
53:39 - different purposes for me Here I am
53:42 - probably going to be doing it via the
53:46 - storyboard I might be taking a hybrid
53:49 - approach when I start getting to the
53:51 - social features and basically when I
53:54 - pull that data down from the database I
53:56 - might be generating some of like the
53:57 - whatever social cards or social history
54:00 - or whatever aspects of it
54:02 - programmatically but for the timer
54:03 - aspect I might do it through storyboard
54:06 - just so because I'm gonna be
54:09 - demonstrating this and I'm then I'm
54:10 - gonna be using this project series as
54:13 - something for beginners to follow
54:17 - that's why I'm opting for that route
54:33 - you know a lot of you guys have heard of
54:35 - it before
54:38 - team film studies make a video on a
54:41 - pedometer core motion please I actually
54:44 - haven't looked into any of that stuff
54:47 - before so your best bet would be to try
54:51 - googling for it first to see of other
54:53 - YouTube or iOS content creators has
54:56 - created any tutorials for that that will
54:59 - be faster than I mean looking into it
55:03 - first and then creating a tutorial with
55:05 - it yeah
55:09 - Christopher awesome I'm glad there's
55:11 - someone that validates the the whole
55:13 - social feature aspect of it the
55:17 - telephone is your worst enemy Karl for
55:22 - me it's it's not my telephone because I
55:23 - never get calls from anyone but um it's
55:26 - probably like firing up a browser tab
55:28 - and like checking my stat YouTube stats
55:30 - or like I don't use Facebook that much
55:33 - so I'm not I'm not really distracted by
55:35 - Facebook because I know some people are
55:37 - and you know personally you know how
55:41 - they say Facebook is bad for you like it
55:43 - causes depression I kind of feel that
55:45 - way not depression per se you know not
55:48 - to that extreme but when I browse
55:50 - people's newsfeed and I see like people
55:52 - are going on vacation and they have
55:53 - these wonderful lives it just makes me
55:55 - like oh man I wish I was there or wish
55:57 - that was me and it just makes me feel
55:59 - bad about myself and so I I don't end up
56:02 - going on Facebook anymore because of
56:04 - that because I feel like people only
56:09 - post you know the best sides of their
56:11 - lives but everyone's lives just has ups
56:13 - and downs right no one has this perfect
56:15 - life that's all rainbows and sunshine
56:17 - but I'm just going off on a tangent I oh
56:24 - no once the next episode gonna be for
56:25 - this app well I am committing to do a
56:27 - livestream like every single Wednesday
56:29 - so if if not before then then it will be
56:35 - definitely next Wednesday but I'm
56:36 - thinking that I might create a
56:39 - standalone video I'm not going to commit
56:44 - to anything because I'm not completely
56:45 - sure but definitely
56:47 - next Wednesday if not before that but
56:49 - make sure you're subscribed it has the
56:51 - chance I'm gonna plug my channel make
56:53 - sure you're subscribed with the red
56:55 - subscribe button below and click that
56:57 - little bell icon to make sure you get
56:58 - notified if you don't want to miss the
57:01 - next episode
57:02 - so I own it thanks for giving me the
57:04 - chance to to plug my channel like that
57:10 - Android user do you prefer sketch or
57:12 - Adobe XD I actually haven't used Adobe
57:15 - XD before and I prefer sketch but I
57:18 - might not use any of those tools because
57:20 - I want to I want to make as much as
57:25 - possible I want to be using free tools
57:27 - so that you guys can follow along with
57:31 - it and so I'm gonna be using figma at
57:33 - least that's in my head that's what I'm
57:35 - gonna do right now and having used both
57:37 - sketch and figma figma is so similar to
57:40 - sketch it's crazy like all of the
57:43 - shortcut keys the buttons and the things
57:45 - that you can do there it's so similar
57:47 - and so yeah but personally if I like if
57:52 - I wasn't doing any demos or anything
57:54 - like that and I'm doing things for
57:55 - myself I I use sketch I haven't used the
57:59 - dhobi XD although I have a Creative
58:01 - Cloud subscription so I I think I will
58:03 - look into it in the future I can't
58:05 - compare I was about to say I haven't
58:06 - used the dhobi XD so I can't compare
58:08 - with Sketch
58:16 - team film studies I want to register
58:18 - user steps taken any experience no I
58:24 - don't have any experience with that but
58:27 - doesn't like does the health
58:30 - I know Apple watch does keep track of
58:32 - your steps but if you didn't have an
58:34 - Apple watch and you only had an iPhone
58:37 - does the health kit like the health app
58:40 - on your phone does it track steps like
58:42 - that I haven't I don't really use the
58:43 - health app on my phone but if it does
58:45 - track steps I would ask do you den need
58:49 - to track your own steps can you take the
58:51 - data from the health app you might be
58:55 - able to with your app excuse me
59:08 - voice prototyping Martin saying that
59:11 - Adobe XD has awesome new features for a
59:13 - voice prototyping I'd I don't even know
59:15 - what that is I gotta look into that
59:20 - that sounds pretty crazy like he's just
59:23 - narrate what happens or something like
59:25 - that I don't know but I'll take a look
59:28 - into it are you guys are some of you
59:31 - guys designers or like graphics
59:32 - professionals let me know let me know
59:35 - down below because when you guys see me
59:36 - using finger sketch I and and you guys
59:41 - are graphics professionals you guys will
59:42 - probably laugh I mean so I am NOT a
59:45 - professional designer but I I can do
59:49 - like the basic stuff and so I will be
59:51 - like I'm able to use it for what I need
59:54 - to use it for but I can still show you
59:59 - guys in case any of you guys don't know
60:02 - how to use fake more sketch at all no
60:10 - jesper so
60:16 - so my plan is to develop to finish the
60:20 - app well to finish V one of the app and
60:23 - launch it by the end of the month and
60:24 - that's like in two weeks right so I
60:26 - can't do it live in the live stream but
60:30 - what I'm gonna do is like I I will have
60:33 - to release videos in between the live
60:35 - streams in order to be able to show you
60:37 - guys start to finish V one out of the
60:42 - door so I know for a fact that I will
60:44 - have to record videos outside of the
60:46 - live stream to do some of this stuff to
60:48 - get it done so I hope that clarifies
60:50 - stuff Robin we have a Facebook group
60:59 - Facebook community you can go and ask
61:01 - those questions and there would be tons
61:03 - of people that'll help you out and just
61:06 - in case you guys don't know we have a
61:08 - CWC well code with chris communty it's a
61:11 - Facebook group tons of people helping
61:13 - each other out and I'm not just saying
61:14 - that I know some Facebook groups are
61:16 - completely dead not ours tons of people
61:19 - in there chatting helping each other out
61:21 - so if you have any questions on any of
61:23 - the tutorials that you see in here or

61:53 - have attended like all of the three live
61:55 - streams I've done so far so thank you
61:57 - guys for that last question Mohamed what
62:02 - are you used for sketching I just sketch
62:04 - with pencil and a notepad so you know
