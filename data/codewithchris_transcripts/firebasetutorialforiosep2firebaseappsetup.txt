00:04 - hello welcome to lesson 2 of the
00:07 - firebase tutorial video series in this
00:09 - lesson we're going to sign up for our
00:11 - firebase account create our firebase
00:13 - project and then we're going to download
00:16 - the configuration file in preparation to
00:19 - import that into our Xcode project when
00:22 - we create that in the next lesson
00:24 - but first we're going to set things up
00:26 - here on the firebase side of things now
00:28 - what you need to do is go to firebase
00:31 - google comm don't go to firebase comm
00:34 - because it's just going to tell you that
00:36 - the site has moved to firebase google
00:39 - comm since Google owns firebase and
00:42 - they've started to migrate things here
00:44 - now I'm already signed in but you should
00:47 - see a sign-in button up here and all you
00:49 - need is a Google account so if you
00:52 - already have one then you're in luck if
00:54 - not just simply click sign in and you'll
00:56 - see a link to actually create a Google
01:00 - account I think I'm signed in when
01:03 - you're signed in go to console ok
01:05 - so it turns out I'm not signed in so let
01:07 - me sign in right now and if you don't
01:09 - have an account then I think it will
01:14 - prompt you to create one here
01:22 - okay so it's automatically brought me
01:25 - into the console where I can see all of
01:28 - my fire based projects if you don't see
01:30 - that you can simply click let me go back
01:33 - to the home page for a second here you
01:35 - can simply click this link go to console
01:37 - after you're signed in and it's going to
01:40 - show you all of your firebase projects
01:41 - so there's another section down here if
01:44 - you've used the legacy website here at
01:48 - firebase comm and you have some projects
01:50 - here it's going to show up down here but
01:54 - what we want to do is create a brand new
01:56 - firebase project at firebase log Google
01:59 - comm and we're going to name it
02:04 - messaging app I showed you the demo in
02:07 - the previous lesson click create project
02:10 - it's going to take less than a minute to
02:12 - create that project alright so here we
02:18 - are take a look at all of the things
02:20 - that have been provisioned for our
02:21 - messaging app authentication database
02:24 - storage hosting you know all these
02:26 - different things that we can explore so
02:28 - far we're going to be scratching the
02:30 - surface and using the database portion
02:33 - of things here so that was it we've
02:36 - created our firebase app on this side
02:39 - now we need to kind of set things up on
02:42 - the Xcode project side and they've made
02:45 - it really easy for us because what you
02:47 - can do is download a configuration file
02:49 - just import that file into your Xcode
02:51 - project and that plist file it contains
02:54 - all of the configuration data and
02:57 - settings to point to this instance of
03:00 - our database and all of this stuff what
03:03 - we can do now to get started is click
03:05 - this add a firebase to your iOS app
03:07 - button and here you're going to enter
03:10 - some details about your Xcode project
03:12 - since we haven't created it yet all we
03:15 - really need to do is specify a bundle ID
03:17 - here if you've already created your
03:19 - Xcode project you already have a bundle
03:21 - ID because that's one of the first
03:23 - things you specify when you create a new
03:25 - Xcode project so just put that bundle ID
03:27 - here but since we haven't created that
03:30 - Xcode project yet
03:32 - we're just going to make up a bundle ID
03:33 - here
03:34 - and when we create our Xcode project in
03:37 - the next lesson we're going to want to
03:38 - use the same bundle ID we specify right
03:41 - here so I'm going to do comm code with
03:44 - Kris and you can use your name or your
03:46 - company name like comm dot your name and
03:48 - then dot messaging app like that and I'm
03:54 - going to give the app a nickname and you
03:58 - can see here there are a couple of other
04:00 - steps the next step after I click add
04:02 - app is it's going to create that
04:04 - configuration file and it's going to
04:06 - automatically download and then we've
04:09 - got to import the firebase files or SDK
04:13 - into our Xcode project so we're going to
04:16 - do that through cocoa pods and if you've
04:19 - seen that video that I've released
04:20 - before on how to use cocoa pods then
04:22 - you'll be set but otherwise don't worry
04:25 - we're going to go through it together
04:26 - and finally you can add some
04:29 - initialization code to your Xcode
04:31 - project just to initialize that
04:34 - connection to our firebase instance here
04:36 - so those are kind of at high level the
04:38 - steps we're going to go through in this
04:40 - lesson we're just going to finish step
04:42 - two and then the next lesson we're going
04:44 - to do three and four so let's click Add
04:46 - app now okay so you can see here that it
04:53 - automatically prompts me to download
04:55 - Google service info.plist and I'm just
04:58 - going to save it on my desktop there
05:00 - please ignore the mess on my desktop but
05:03 - what could happen is you might get an
05:06 - error saying that you don't have
05:07 - authorization to download it and that's
05:10 - something that I encountered initially
05:12 - when I was working with firebase for the
05:14 - first time so I found out that the
05:17 - problem was that I was signed in to
05:19 - multiple Google accounts so we're just
05:21 - going to hit X here we can do these
05:22 - other steps afterwards so I'm going to
05:25 - click X here as long as you've already
05:26 - downloaded this Google service
05:28 - info.plist to your desktop or somewhere
05:30 - you know your project folder then you're
05:33 - good to go so we're going to hit the X
05:35 - here and I want to show you right here
05:38 - I'm signed in to a single Google account
05:39 - but if you get that authorization error
05:42 - which stops you from downloading that
05:44 - plist simply hit your icon out here sign
05:47 - out
05:48 - and then sign back in with just a single
05:51 - Google account that you want to use for
05:53 - firebase and then after that you'll be
05:56 - out here the console screen just simply
06:00 - click your app to get back in and then I
06:02 - think it was right here so just click
06:07 - manage to get back here and you can
06:10 - download the plist file here after you
06:15 - sign out and sign back in with a single
06:17 - Google account you should be able to
06:18 - click this button and download that file
06:20 - no problem okay so now that we have our
06:23 - Google service info.plist file that
06:26 - contains all of the configuration
06:28 - settings to connect to this instance of
06:29 - firebase we're good to go
06:32 - in the next lesson we're going to create
06:34 - the Xcode project and then we're going
06:36 - to add that plist we're going to add the
06:38 - firebase SDK through cocoa pods and
06:40 - we're going to make that connection to
06:42 - our database on the firebase side of
06:44 - things thanks for watching and I'll see
06:47 - you in the next lesson bye for now
