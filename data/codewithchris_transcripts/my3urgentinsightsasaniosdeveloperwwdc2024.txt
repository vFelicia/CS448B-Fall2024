00:00 - hey it's Chris here so as you've
00:01 - probably heard Apple announced that Siri
00:04 - is getting a huge upgrade in iOS 18 Siri
00:09 - now has the ability to comb through all
00:11 - of your data your contacts your messages
00:14 - your emails your calendar your notes and
00:18 - even app specific data across all of
00:20 - your apps so this gives Siri a personal
00:24 - context and it can perform tasks such as
00:27 - if you just ask it vaguely hey order an
00:30 - Uber for my date tonight right and Siri
00:33 - can intelligently pull from all those
00:35 - pieces of data and perform that task now
00:38 - the downside of that obviously is you
00:39 - have to give up your data to Siri for it
00:41 - to know and the interesting thing is
00:43 - that I asked I just created a poll I
00:46 - think this was yeah
00:48 - yesterday and 60% of respondents said
00:52 - they would not want to give Siri all of
00:55 - that
00:56 - data keep in mind that the people who
00:59 - watch watch my channel and you right we
01:03 - are all Tech oriented people we know
01:06 - what can be done with data we know that
01:08 - the big companies are taking data and
01:10 - they're doing things with it that we
01:12 - wouldn't necessarily want right the
01:14 - masses they only see the frontend UI
01:17 - right and they're like oh I can do this
01:19 - or that but they don't really know the
01:22 - hidden agenda of the big tech company so
01:25 - I feel like us having that knowledge
01:28 - we're definitely more guarded with our
01:30 - data and personal information whereas
01:32 - the general public you know the general
01:34 - iPhone user they are less in tune or
01:38 - aware of how their data is being used
01:40 - they only see the benefit so I think
01:43 - that this poll probably doesn't apply to
01:47 - how the general population is going to
01:49 - perceive Siri uh capturing all of their
01:52 - data and using it as AI so my first
01:55 - takeaway is that there's going to be way
01:57 - more people using AI in in their
02:00 - day-to-day lives now I don't know about
02:02 - you but most of my friends and family
02:03 - they're not tech people and so they are
02:07 - not going to use AI to plan a trip
02:09 - they're not going to ask AI how to write
02:13 - this email they they just won't because
02:15 - they have to go on a different website
02:17 - for example chat GPT and they have to
02:19 - potentially upload information for thei
02:22 - to work with and give it contacts and
02:24 - all that stuff still very reserved for
02:27 - Tech oriented people or tech savvy
02:29 - people
02:31 - but now if it's just on your device and
02:33 - think about how many people like
02:35 - grandmas and grandpas uncles Aunt who
02:37 - are not tech savvy who use iPads right
02:40 - and iPhones because they're easy to use
02:43 - right and now they have access to just
02:45 - ask the to do something they're going to
02:47 - do it and they're going to expect things
02:49 - to be that easy from this point on which
02:52 - brings me to my second takeaway is that
02:55 - people once they get used to and
02:58 - acclimatized to using
03:00 - AI asking Siri to do all of these
03:03 - different things across their apps on
03:04 - their device they're going to come to
03:06 - expect that that's going to be the
03:08 - standard that's going to be the
03:10 - expectation so for us as app developers
03:14 - if let's say our app is a to-do app and
03:18 - the user on the iPhone is telling Siri
03:20 - hey I finished this task please mark it
03:22 - as
03:23 - complete and Siri cannot do that because
03:26 - it can't find the data in your app and
03:28 - it doesn't know about your app
03:31 - the user is not going to like that and
03:32 - they're going to delete your to-do list
03:34 - app and they're going to look for
03:35 - another one that does expose the data to
03:39 - the on device AI to Siri right so to me
03:43 - I think we need to really start diving
03:47 - deeper and paying more attention to Siri
03:49 - kit and app intense because that is how
03:52 - you're going to expose your apps data in
03:55 - capabilities to Siri to be used with
03:59 - various AI tasks let's move on to the
04:01 - second big takeaway from the event which
04:04 - is on the xcode part there's going to be
04:06 - xcode code completion and Swift assist
04:09 - so code completion is AI where it has
04:13 - the context of your project and it can
04:15 - predict what you want to do and you can
04:18 - it'll give you lines of code that thinks
04:19 - you want to write and then you just tab
04:21 - through it and select like code
04:22 - completion but maybe taken a little
04:24 - further Swift assist if you didn't see
04:27 - the video is more of like a co-pilot or
04:29 - or a code assistant where you can just
04:31 - ask it questions if you don't know how
04:33 - to do something or perhaps you uh wanted
04:36 - to change your code somehow refactor it
04:39 - you can just ask it to do that now Co
04:40 - Swift assist isn't available just yet
04:43 - but the code completion stuff is if you
04:45 - download xcode 16 I believe you need the
04:48 - new version of Mac OS as well Sequoia so
04:52 - I haven't downloaded this just yet but I
04:55 - do want to refer to a video here by pit
04:58 - and you can go check out his Channel
05:00 - I'll link this I'll link this video in
05:01 - the description below so you can check
05:03 - it out he's showing off some of xcode
05:05 - 16's code completion and his conclusion
05:08 - is just that you still need to know what
05:11 - you're doing it's not very good in
05:13 - general um it could be that it's still
05:15 - in beta or it could get better but as it
05:18 - stands right now it his conclusion is
05:20 - that it's not as magical as the demos
05:24 - made it to be at dub DC and also if you
05:27 - read the comments below people are not
05:31 - too um Amazed by it let's say which goes
05:36 - back to the point that I want to make is
05:38 - that you still need to have a baseline
05:41 - knowledge of coding you can't expect the
05:43 - AI to Just Produce the software for you
05:46 - working and everything and you have no
05:48 - idea how to maintain it how it's done I
05:51 - still stand by the fact that you need to
05:54 - be the architect you can give the AI
05:57 - bits to write or if you don't know how
06:00 - to do something that's actually a good
06:02 - way to use AI is to tell it what you
06:04 - want and then have it uh generate
06:06 - something you read it so that you can
06:08 - understand and get a general idea of how
06:10 - it's done which gives you a direction to
06:12 - go in then you can Google research ask
06:15 - you have a direction to go because often
06:18 - times if you don't know how to do
06:20 - something you've never done it before
06:21 - you don't know where to start right so
06:23 - my third takeaway is that there's going
06:26 - to be less of an emphasis on the coding
06:28 - part because you can use AI to assist
06:30 - you and to guide you and there's going
06:32 - to be more emphasis on the product
06:35 - development part so that's like the
06:36 - business side of things the marketing
06:38 - the user feedback user testing all of
06:40 - that stuff and I think this presents a
06:43 - few unique opportunities for everyone so
06:46 - first of all if you're a hardcore
06:47 - engineer it's going to make it even
06:49 - easier for you to stand out with your
06:52 - skills and knowledge and expertise
06:54 - because there's going to be a a flood of
06:55 - coders trying to build things that don't
06:57 - really know what's going on
07:00 - so it's going to be really easy for you
07:01 - to stand out second of all because
07:03 - there's going to be a new flood of
07:04 - people using AI coding the competition
07:07 - is going to be stepped up so that you
07:09 - have to focus more on the marketing side
07:11 - and standing out from the crowd rather
07:12 - than trying to learn code Syntax for
07:15 - example and one last thing is that
07:17 - coding and building apps being more
07:19 - accessible with AI inside xcode that
07:22 - means that if you ever wanted to learn
07:25 - how to code or to build it app now is
07:27 - the time now is the best time for you to
07:30 - learn and to build your product because
07:32 - the limit to your success isn't isn't
07:35 - coding anymore the barrier is now
07:38 - expressing your
07:40 - creativity and then getting your vision
07:43 - out there and getting enough people to
07:45 - buy into your vision of your app so I
07:48 - think that's really exciting anybody who
07:50 - has a great idea can now have even a
07:53 - better thought at getting it actually
07:56 - into the hands of people to be used so
07:59 - so those are my thoughts now I want to
08:01 - hear what you think about Siri having
08:03 - access to all of your data about AI
08:06 - inside xcode helping people code what
08:09 - are your thoughts about where coders
08:11 - will be 5 years from now let's say I
08:14 - still maintain the perspective that
08:15 - coders won't be obsolete the game will
08:18 - just have changed a little bit the role
08:19 - will have changed a little bit and what
08:21 - we do day-to-day will change let me know
08:24 - what you think share your thoughts Below
08:25 - in the comment section and let's have a
08:27 - discussion thanks for watching
