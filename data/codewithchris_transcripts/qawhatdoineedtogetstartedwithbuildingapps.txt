00:05 - hello and welcome to the code with Chris
00:07 - Q&A where I take a couple of minutes to
00:09 - answer questions that you guys have
00:11 - today we have another beginner question
00:13 - and that is what do I need to get
00:16 - started with making apps I'm just going
00:18 - to rephrase this question a little bit
00:20 - to what do I need to get started with
00:23 - making iOS apps because I teach
00:26 - primarily how to build apps for iPhone
00:28 - and iPad and furthermore I teach you how
00:31 - to do that using the tools that Apple
00:33 - provides so those tools namely xcode is
00:37 - only available for the Mac so the short
00:40 - answer is that all you need to get
00:43 - started is a Mac computer because that
00:46 - application where you write your code
00:48 - called xcode that's available for free
00:51 - uh from the Mac App Store and then
00:53 - that's all you need you don't even need
00:55 - a device because you're able to uh write
00:59 - your code X code and then they have a
01:01 - built-in simulator which will pop out a
01:04 - screen of the device on your computer on
01:08 - your monitor and you're able to test
01:09 - your app in that simulator and if you
01:11 - don't have a Mac check out my other Q&A
01:14 - episode where I go through some of the
01:16 - PC based Solutions where maybe you can
01:19 - uh rent a Mac online or you can simulate
01:22 - the Mac environment on your PC or maybe
01:25 - use some of the crossplatform solutions
01:27 - that are available on a PC so you can
01:29 - check out that Q&A episode for that
01:33 - thank you for listening and I hope you
01:35 - enjoyed today's episode I'd really
01:36 - appreciate it if you share it with your
01:39 - colleagues and friends if you like the
