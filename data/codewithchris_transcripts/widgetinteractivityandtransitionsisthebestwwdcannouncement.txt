00:00 - widget interactivity and transitions in
00:03 - the last WWDC I noticed that one of the
00:05 - biggest themes was how your app lives
00:07 - outside of your app through glanceable
00:09 - widgets on the lock screen and app
00:12 - intents this year that is even more true
00:15 - with Widget interactivity most apps can
00:17 - benefit from widget because it allows
00:19 - the user another way to ReDiscover your
00:22 - app now with interactive widgets you
00:24 - might be able to include the core
00:26 - functionality of your app through a
00:28 - widget because of this we actually might
00:31 - see a change in user behavior in iOS 17
00:34 - and Beyond widgets may become the
00:37 - preferred way to interact with apps and
00:40 - maybe launching apps will feel old
00:42 - clunky and archaic so definitely see if
00:46 - interactive widgets is something that
00:48 - makes sense for your app
