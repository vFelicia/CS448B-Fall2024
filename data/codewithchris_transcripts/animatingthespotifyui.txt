00:00 - in this lesson we'll learn how to
00:02 - animate between two screens and figma
00:04 - using smart animate hello and welcome
00:06 - back for another video so in our
00:08 - previous lesson we recreated spotify's
00:10 - media player so to pick up where we left
00:12 - off we'll recreate the lyric screen and
00:15 - from there we'll learn how to
00:17 - animate between the media player and the
00:19 - expanded lyric screen that will design
00:21 - later on so this is going to be a very
00:23 - fun lesson so let's get started
00:26 - so to give you a little bit of
00:27 - information and background about our
00:29 - smart animate works in sigma you need to
00:31 - have two or more different states so
00:33 - that can be two screens two frames and
00:35 - so on basically you need to have a
00:37 - starting point and an end point
00:40 - so if we duplicate our frame here
00:43 - and change the position of this element
00:45 - to the center
00:46 - just like that and change its size
00:49 - if we enable the smart animate
00:51 - transition here so just drag this circle
00:54 - to the screen 4 and make sure smart
00:56 - animate is selected
00:59 - basically once we do this um figma will
01:02 - automatically calculate the difference
01:04 - between the two states as well as
01:06 - automatically create a smooth transition
01:08 - between these two for you so now here's
01:10 - the catch smart animate emulates um css
01:13 - transitions one to one so it's very
01:15 - important that the layering and the
01:17 - naming of your elements are the same
01:20 - across multiple frames or multiple
01:22 - screens
01:23 - so as you can see
01:25 - screen 1 is named circle basically all
01:27 - this our name circle just like that all
01:30 - elements are named circle however screen
01:32 - 2 is spelled incorrectly as you can see
01:34 - it's c-r-i-c-l-c-l-e
01:37 - so we won't change that but i'm going to
01:39 - give you an example as to why this won't
01:41 - work
01:42 - so if we play select play
01:45 - so this is screen 1
01:46 - and when we press screen 2
01:49 - the transition is not seamless however
01:52 - if we go to screen 3 and screen 4 you
01:54 - can see that the transition is very
01:56 - seamless it's very smooth and there's
01:58 - some sort of logic between this screen 3
02:01 - to screen 4. so like i said the reason
02:03 - why this flow 1 this screen 1 screen 2
02:06 - doesn't have a smooth transition is
02:08 - because screen 2
02:10 - is misspelled the element here is
02:13 - misspelled so because of this figma
02:15 - won't be able to calculate properly the
02:17 - difference between circle and this
02:19 - element that's spelled incorrectly so
02:21 - take note that when you are
02:24 - applying smart animate for your um
02:26 - designs you need to make sure that the
02:28 - structure
02:29 - and
02:30 - the naming of your elements are exactly
02:34 - the same so to remedy this you just need
02:37 - to make sure that to duplicate the
02:39 - screen and not recreate another screen
02:42 - from scratch because if you recreate
02:43 - another screen from scratch you are
02:45 - running the risk of not being able to
02:48 - smart animate properly so that's one
02:50 - thing to take note of so with that out
02:52 - of the way let's proceed to creating the
02:54 - design for this expanded lyric section
02:56 - so let's just duplicate this
02:59 - and let's remove and we'll use this as
03:01 - the reference material so
03:03 - let's just remove this image for now
03:06 - group one
03:07 - let's remove this let's just drag it
03:09 - here
03:11 - so we'll see we'll use this as reference
03:14 - from here we'll just delete this
03:17 - oops we won't delete this by the way and
03:19 - we'll just adjust the properties so so
03:22 - for the image we'll resize it to
03:23 - something smaller maybe 20
03:26 - or maybe 50 and then we'll adjust the
03:28 - stroke to maybe 5
03:31 - or even 2 something like that so that's
03:34 - enough
03:35 - and we'll remove this header as well
03:37 - and sunday morning maroon 5 let's remove
03:40 - this
03:41 - and just drag it here
03:50 - and adjust the properties
03:52 - to something like
03:58 - that
04:01 - so we just adjust the properties of this
04:03 - text as well so 18 let's make it 14
04:07 - and this one will be 12 or even 11
04:11 - and we'll adjust the spacing between
04:13 - these two
04:17 - or
04:18 - yeah i think they're already good
04:19 - they're already zero so we'll just
04:21 - change the um
04:24 - to packed and then
04:26 - let's just
04:28 - adjust the padding to 100 or something
04:31 - like that
04:33 - and 20
04:34 - or that's good
04:36 - let's just keep this because we still
04:38 - have the pause button so let's remove
04:40 - the shuffle so let's just click this
04:43 - icon
04:44 - and then click on this icon as well
04:46 - click on the repeat and click on this
04:48 - eye icon as well
04:50 - and same goes for the other elements
04:52 - just like that so we won't be
04:54 - necessarily deleting them from the our
04:57 - layers panel we'll just make them
04:59 - disappear for now
05:02 - and then from there
05:05 - we will remove this as well
05:08 - and this one
05:10 - just like that
05:12 - and let's copy this
05:15 - and just like that
05:20 - and from here let's
05:23 - bring back the
05:24 - shuffle button
05:26 - make it appear like that let's just make
05:28 - it zero
05:30 - so we'll still have the play or rather
05:33 - the pause icon in the middle and the
05:36 - share
05:36 - icon on the side
05:39 - so it's here okay
05:42 - so from there we'll just delete this
05:46 - we'll just resize this lyric's master
05:48 - frame and make it full page but before
05:50 - we do that we need to make sure that
05:52 - this sunday morning text let's uh we
05:54 - won't rename this because it contains
05:57 - the same um
05:58 - layer name from screen one so we won't
06:01 - be renaming anything here to make sure
06:02 - that smart animate works so we'll just
06:04 - make sure that frame three
06:07 - is on the
06:09 - top layer as well as the image one
06:14 - so from there
06:16 - we'll just make sure that this lyrics
06:18 - frame will
06:20 - cover all the screen from top to bottom
06:24 - so let's just
06:26 - adjust it from here let's choose make
06:28 - sure to choose the lyrics frame and from
06:30 - there
06:31 - we'll adjust the size
06:33 - just like that make it snap
06:37 - zoom in if you want to
06:39 - get closer
06:42 - just like that
06:45 - so when in doubt you can just adjust it
06:47 - via here so to make more precise
06:50 - adjustments
06:51 - via the numbers
06:53 - so just like that i think we're all good
06:57 - so from here
06:58 - we'll be adjusting the properties of
07:01 - this text
07:03 - so
07:04 - this will be lyrics master
07:07 - make sure to select frame 16 because
07:09 - this contains this is the frame that
07:10 - contains the text or the lyrics itself
07:13 - so
07:14 - make sure to adjust the
07:16 - um padding tap top padding to maybe 44
07:20 - or 100
07:22 - even 200 or something like that
07:24 - or even
07:26 - 164 is a good then from there let's make
07:29 - sure it's 20
07:33 - or even
07:34 - 40
07:36 - or 32 that's closer
07:41 - and make sure to make it snap to the
07:43 - right
07:45 - and from here we'll remove this more
07:48 - icon
07:50 - just make it invisible
07:53 - and the lyrics as well basically this on
07:56 - frame 15 will make it disappear
08:00 - just like that
08:02 - so from here we'll also remove the
08:04 - gradient layer because
08:07 - we don't need it anymore
08:09 - and the share
08:10 - icon we don't need it as well
08:14 - let's make sure
08:15 - to make it invisible
08:18 - from there
08:19 - we'll just google sunday morning lyrics
08:21 - again
08:26 - let's just copy this
08:28 - and go back
08:32 - and paste everything else
08:34 - so as you can see we still have a lot of
08:36 - space here and i just realized that we
08:38 - don't have the media player and the
08:41 - scroll bar here and the reason is
08:43 - because it's in the bottom it's behind
08:46 - this frame layer so we need to make sure
08:48 - to put them on the front or on top
08:52 - so let's just find it so press on this
08:55 - frame and it's named as frame four and
08:58 - this one is named frame six so we'll
09:00 - look for frame four and frame six on our
09:02 - screen to frame and make sure to select
09:04 - them both by holding on command or
09:06 - control then once you've selected them
09:08 - both make sure to hold command option
09:11 - and right bracket
09:12 - and then from there
09:14 - they will just show up just like that
09:18 - now we have our media player
09:20 - so just make sure to adjust the
09:23 - properties of this um
09:25 - scroll bar
09:27 - so we'll just change this to maybe
09:30 - something lighter
09:32 - just like that
09:34 - maybe 50
09:36 - and cool that's all good
09:40 - and i think
09:42 - we also need to look for frame five
09:44 - which contains our timestamps so look
09:46 - for frame five under screen two
09:49 - this is it
09:50 - as you can see it's highlighted here so
09:52 - press command option right bracket as
09:54 - well you can see it just pop up just
09:56 - like that and put it right below this
10:00 - scroll bar
10:02 - just like that make sure it snaps
10:04 - and change the um
10:06 - color of this as well to something
10:09 - that's similar so this is
10:11 - e9e9e9 let's just copy paste that color
10:15 - property
10:16 - make sure it's the same
10:18 - just like that
10:20 - oh double check so these three stacks on
10:22 - top of each other perfectly so that's
10:25 - all good
10:26 - and let's just make sure
10:31 - that this will
10:32 - snap just like that as well
10:35 - and from here we still have enough space
10:37 - here so let's just remove
10:40 - this by dragging up the canvas or the
10:43 - frame and also the home indicator needs
10:45 - to be on top as well so we can see that
10:48 - and also this status bar
10:50 - that just like that so we can have a
10:52 - better scale or understanding of our ui
10:55 - so from here
10:56 - um let's just select them all
10:58 - option l
11:01 - hold
11:02 - suck them all
11:05 - and just make sure that this will snap
11:08 - right here
11:09 - so from here we also have enough space
11:12 - on the top
11:13 - so let's just select this too
11:15 - and drag it make sure just
11:18 - make sure to that it will snap on this
11:21 - um status bar area and from here
11:24 - we also still have enough space
11:27 - and as you can see our frame bounding
11:28 - box isn't properly covering our text
11:32 - to do that just click on this resize to
11:34 - fit
11:35 - and just like that it's now showing
11:37 - properly so let's just resize it
11:40 - as well
11:42 - and just like that that's our lyrics
11:44 - master
11:46 - so let's adjust this um
11:50 - frame 16
11:53 - make sure
11:55 - we can adjust this further maybe 120
11:58 - oops
12:00 - 120
12:01 - and
12:02 - that's all good
12:04 - 132. all right that's all good
12:07 - i think that's about it we just need to
12:09 - have the x icon so let's look for icons
12:12 - eight
12:13 - or your icons plugin of choice i'll look
12:16 - for the close icon
12:19 - in ios
12:23 - not go as close
12:25 - so from here we'll just change the color
12:28 - to something like set major to choose
12:30 - selection colors something white
12:32 - and then just drag it here and resize it
12:35 - to maybe 24 our usual sizes or maybe 32
12:40 - or even 44.
12:42 - yeah that's good so it's not the same as
12:45 - the spotify ui i think this is a
12:47 - proprietary or this is a custom icon
12:50 - that spotify itself designed so
12:53 - we don't have that in our plugin so it's
12:56 - okay
12:57 - this is the best thing that we can find
13:00 - so just like that
13:03 - just drag it here maybe make sure that
13:05 - it will be inside the frame 3
13:10 - or not because
13:12 - it's not in this as you can see right
13:13 - here it's not in the same box or same
13:17 - row so it's okay if it's just above
13:19 - sitting above this
13:21 - frame so if we close this
13:23 - and click on screen two
13:26 - you can see mac os close
13:28 - oops mac os close is
13:31 - sitting will be sitting on the top just
13:34 - like that
13:36 - all right that's good
13:39 - so let's double check on our um frames
13:42 - icons so from here our expanded lyric
13:44 - section is done so next thing to do is
13:46 - to make sure to enable smart animate so
13:48 - let's
13:49 - click on prototype on the right side
13:52 - so you can choose whichever element but
13:54 - i think i'd prefer this one either the
13:56 - lyrics or the more so let's choose the
13:58 - lyrics here
14:00 - make sure that the lyrics section is
14:01 - selected
14:02 - and then drag this circle and the arrow
14:05 - to here to the next frame make sure
14:07 - smart animate is enabled and ease out
14:10 - or maybe even ease in
14:14 - from there all we need to do is press
14:16 - play
14:20 - and
14:21 - as you can see right here is our screen
14:23 - one and if we click lyrics
14:26 - just like that our lyrics expanded
14:29 - beautifully expanded seamlessly
14:31 - so let's go back to our canvas
14:34 - so if you click x and click here and
14:36 - drag it here
14:37 - it will go back to our media player
14:39 - basically that's basically closing our
14:41 - lyric expanded lyric section so this
14:43 - will be ease in this will be this should
14:45 - be ease out
14:48 - and this will be ease in
14:50 - all right so let's read this
14:52 - prototype again so click on screen one
14:55 - click on play
14:56 - so let's scroll down and click on lyrics
15:00 - and that's a beautiful transition very
15:01 - seamless and then let's click with our
15:04 - new animation let's click close or the x
15:07 - and just like that so let's do it again
15:10 - and this one it's a very seamless
15:13 - beautiful transition
15:15 - and yeah that's all done with smart
15:18 - animate on figma so remember when using
15:20 - smart animate duplicate the screen and
15:23 - don't try to like recreate everything
15:25 - from scratch because that will just mess
15:27 - up how smart animate works
15:30 - alright so that's our two part lesson on
15:32 - recreating and animating this spotify ui
15:35 - all in figma so this is just the tip of
15:37 - the iceberg on when it comes to learning
15:39 - figmas prototyping and
15:42 - animation features so if you are
15:44 - interested to know more about it make
15:46 - sure to stay tuned for future lessons in
15:48 - the meantime i hope the past two lessons
15:50 - have inspired you to explore figma on
15:52 - your own and recreate apps that you like
15:55 - for practice figma is a very
15:57 - beginner-friendly tool and we highly
15:58 - recommend using it when learning how to
16:00 - design uis so as usual the resource file
16:03 - for this lesson is in the description if
16:05 - you want to further study the design
16:06 - file yourself and if you have any
16:09 - questions feel free to post in the code
16:10 - group forum and i'll be happy to help
16:13 - again make sure to keep on practicing
16:14 - your design and figma skills because i
16:16 - know i will and it would mean a lot if
16:18 - you would too with those things said i
16:20 - hope you learned something and i'll see
16:22 - you in the next lesson
