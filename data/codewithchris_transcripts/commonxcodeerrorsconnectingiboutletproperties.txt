00:05 - hello welcome to this video where I'm
00:08 - gonna show you guys some tips on how to
00:10 - create your IB outlets for connecting
00:13 - your IB outlets to the elements on your
00:16 - storyboard have you've gone through my
00:18 - beginner series the lessons where we
00:21 - create the war card game you would have
00:24 - had some experience with this where
00:26 - you're adding elements onto the view and
00:28 - then you're connecting those elements to
00:32 - expose them in your view controller so
00:34 - you can access them by a code now let me
00:37 - just demonstrate here I'm gonna do just
00:41 - a let's do a button this is a brand new
00:46 - project you don't need to follow along I
00:48 - just want to show you guys some of the
00:50 - pitfalls so here what we'll usually do
00:54 - is click show the assistant editor and
00:58 - then we're going to click the button
01:01 - we're gonna hold down control on our
01:03 - keyboard and we're gonna click and we're
01:06 - gonna drag it over here so it says
01:08 - insert outlet action or outlet
01:12 - collection and here you want to make
01:15 - sure that your outlet sorry your
01:18 - connection is outlet if you're planning
01:20 - to expose the button if you are planning
01:22 - to do a handle a button tap then you
01:26 - would choose action instead but let's
01:29 - choose outlet and let's say something
01:32 - like I'm gonna type in my my button and
01:38 - I'm gonna purposely spell it wrong
01:40 - because I want to demonstrate a common
01:42 - common problem that beginners run into
01:45 - so now I've called so now I've connected
01:48 - my button element to the view controller
01:50 - but I spelled it wrong
01:52 - so what some people do is they're just
01:55 - going to delete this property and then
01:59 - they're gonna do it again so now I'm
02:03 - gonna spell it the right way and when
02:09 - they run it
02:10 - the app is gonna crash and I'll tell you
02:13 - why in a second so there it's crashed
02:20 - and if you go down to this debug area if
02:23 - you don't have this pane here just go
02:27 - into the upper right and you can toggle
02:28 - it on and if you scroll all the way to
02:30 - the top you're going to see
02:35 - determinating Abdul - uncaught exception
02:38 - MS unknown key exception this class is
02:41 - not key value coding compliant for the
02:43 - key my button this is the misspelling
02:46 - see it spelled with an eye so I thought
02:49 - we deleted that
02:50 - I'll let right why is it complaining
02:52 - that it can't find it well let's just
02:56 - stop this for a second well what happens
02:59 - is when you delete after you make this
03:02 - connection even if you delete this line
03:05 - of code right here the button is still
03:07 - connected to that property except now
03:09 - it's even worse because when you run
03:12 - your app it's expecting to connect this
03:14 - element to a property named my but tin
03:18 - with an eye but it's not there anymore
03:20 - so how do we fix this well you go back
03:23 - to your storyboard and you right-click
03:25 - on the element or if you don't have a
03:28 - two button mouse you can press command
03:30 - and click hold down command and click
03:32 - and you can see down here in the
03:34 - referencing outlets it's connected to
03:36 - two properties in the view controller
03:38 - now the correct spelling in the
03:40 - incorrect spelling so all you want to do
03:42 - to fix this it's click this little X
03:44 - next to the the one you deleted and by
03:49 - doing that now that you run it it won't
03:51 - look for this misspelled outlet another
03:57 - tip is like you see this grey dot here
04:00 - this filled in circle that means that it
04:03 - is connected so this outlet is connected
04:05 - to some element right click if I kill
04:09 - this if I click an X kill that you can
04:12 - see that that circle is not filled
04:13 - anymore
04:14 - so that's just that just indicates to
04:17 - you whether or not it's connected
04:20 - another common mistake that I see people
04:23 - doing when
04:24 - have lots of elements laid out next to
04:26 - each other is sometimes there they may
04:29 - connect the wrong element so I just put
04:32 - a view on top of my button actually let
04:34 - me let me move the button like that so
04:40 - now my button is inside my view so
04:42 - sometimes they may accidentally select
04:45 - the wrong element so let me connect this
04:47 - view here right and I don't think they
04:55 - would type this but somehow they get
04:56 - into this situation where they're
04:58 - connecting the view as as the button so
05:05 - I'm going to delete this other one here
05:07 - so somehow they connected the view or
05:13 - some other element maybe it was the
05:15 - image view as the button so if I right
05:19 - click this button here you can see that
05:21 - there's no referencing outlets that it's
05:23 - connected to but if I right-click the
05:25 - view you can see that it's connected to
05:28 - the button property in my view
05:30 - controller and my button property is of
05:34 - type UI button so you know I'm gonna
05:37 - write some code here and expect that the
05:41 - button dot let's say set title of the
05:48 - button is draw a card for state UI
05:55 - control state dot normal now I'm trying
06:00 - to set the title for the button here in
06:02 - this piece of code and I'm setting you
06:05 - know whatever element is connected to
06:07 - this property well this is gonna crash
06:09 - because what's actually connected to
06:12 - this property is a UI view element it's
06:15 - not a button so it's gonna crash again
06:20 - and it's gonna say set title select are
06:22 - not found on UI view so you already know
06:26 - how to fix this because we just went
06:28 - through it pretty easy right you just
06:31 - click right click the view and click the
06:35 - X next to the connection
06:38 - and then if your views are overlapping
06:40 - each other so that you are prone to
06:43 - making that mistake what you can do is
06:45 - from this document outline and if you
06:48 - don't have this I should have mentioned
06:50 - earlier there's a little button here in
06:52 - the storyboard to hide or show it and
06:56 - then you can click the element from this
06:59 - document outline hold down ctrl on your
07:00 - keyboard and connect the LF from here
07:07 - okay so you can see that this one's
07:09 - connected to the button now and if you
07:10 - hover over the circle look at highlights
07:12 - which element is connected to it so I
07:16 - can delete this one and finally one last
07:21 - tip is let's go back to let's hide some
07:25 - of these panes here and finally one last
07:30 - tip is when you open up the assistant
07:33 - editor in your storyboard and you're
07:35 - expecting to get the view controller dot
07:37 - Swift for the view for this view
07:39 - controller in your storyboard sometimes
07:43 - you may get something else you may get
07:46 - an error when you're trying to connect
07:48 - elements like in faux-fur view
07:51 - controller not found or something like
07:52 - that or maybe you can't even you can't
07:55 - even get the view controller dot swift
07:57 - on the right-hand side well what you can
07:59 - do is you can actually click these
08:00 - little this breadcrumb here and you can
08:05 - manually go and select a view controller
08:07 - that Swift okay another way to do it is
08:12 - here instead of manual just over go down
08:17 - to automatic and you'll see the
08:20 - recommended file for the the view
08:24 - controller or the view that you're
08:25 - looking at and you can click it from
08:27 - there ok I think that does it for the
08:31 - tips for connecting IB outlets I hope
08:34 - this video was helpful for you guys and
08:36 - I'll see you guys next time
08:38 - you
