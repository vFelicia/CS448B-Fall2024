00:00 - a YouTube versus Chris here and in the
00:07 - previous lesson we went through a
00:08 - diagram illustrating how an iOS app can
00:11 - connect to a MySQL database through a
00:14 - PHP web service so starting from this
00:17 - video we're actually going to implement
00:19 - those things the first step is to find
00:21 - somewhere where we can host our MySQL
00:23 - database and web service so the way I
00:26 - chose to do it in this article was to
00:28 - sign up for web hosting which gives you
00:31 - access to upload files so we can upload
00:35 - our web service as well as create MySQL
00:37 - databases now I want to point out that
00:39 - obviously this option is going to cost
00:41 - money because you're signing up for web
00:43 - hosting but there are tons of other
00:46 - options available for instance if you
00:48 - are savvy web developer you probably
00:51 - have set up a local database server
00:54 - before on your machine or a web server
00:56 - and you can host your own files or maybe
00:59 - if you already have an existing MySQL
01:01 - database and you have access to upload
01:04 - files to that server you can use that as
01:07 - well the reason I chose to do it this
01:09 - way is because it goes back to the days
01:12 - when I was learning how to build
01:14 - websites through HTML CSS and JavaScript
01:17 - and stuff like that and I would need to
01:19 - sign up for web hosting to put up my
01:21 - websites publicly from there I explored
01:24 - MySQL and PHP and that was a long time
01:28 - ago when I did any sort of web
01:30 - development like that these days
01:31 - I'm sure there are other options out
01:34 - there but again I haven't done any sort
01:36 - of web development in a long time so if
01:38 - there are any web developers watching
01:40 - this feel free to comment in the comment
01:44 - section below and maybe you can tell us
01:47 - what the best options are these days or
01:50 - maybe some free options to have access
01:53 - to a MySQL database and a place to
01:55 - upload some files so in this article
01:58 - right here
01:59 - step one is to sign up for that web
02:01 - hosting so I'm not going to go through
02:03 - that because I actually already did sign
02:06 - up for this web hosting when I wrote
02:08 - this article so what I'm going to do is
02:11 - skip to step two and show you
02:13 - how to set up the database once you do
02:15 - have access to one
02:16 - and obviously this setting up the
02:20 - database is going to be in the context
02:22 - of the web host that I have if you
02:25 - signed up for a web host as well and
02:27 - it's not Bluehost it may look a little
02:30 - different but most web hosts these days
02:32 - have some sort of cPanel or
02:34 - administrative panel where you can
02:36 - create new databases and also access and
02:39 - admit panel to manage the database if
02:42 - you do want to sign up through Bluehost
02:44 - like I have it feel free to jump through
02:46 - the link in the description below to go
02:48 - to this article and just follow this
02:50 - section one sign up for web hosting and
02:53 - database and I've provided links to
02:55 - Bluehost there and no extra cost to you
02:58 - I'll earn a commission if you decide to
02:59 - sign up through the links that I've
03:01 - provided here for Bluehost so if you do
03:03 - that thank you for your support and it's
03:05 - going to continue to help me provide
03:07 - free high quality tutorials for you guys
03:09 - ok so anyways let's skip step one here
03:12 - let's jump straight to step two setting
03:14 - up the database again this is in the
03:16 - context of the cPanel or control panel
03:19 - for Bluehost
03:20 - but I'm sure you'll be able to find the
03:22 - options in your own web host so this is
03:25 - what the cPanel for Bluehost looks like
03:27 - I'm going to scroll all the way down
03:29 - here to database tools and click on
03:33 - MySQL databases so this is going to list
03:38 - out all of the current databases I have
03:40 - it's going to redirect me here and it's
03:44 - also going to allow me to create new
03:45 - ones
03:46 - so here I can give a new database a name
03:48 - if there's going to be a little prefix
03:50 - here for the database name I've already
03:54 - created one here I've called it sample
03:56 - DB and the full name is iOS quiz 1
03:58 - underscore sample DB the reason it says
04:02 - iOS quiz 1 is because that's the
04:05 - username that I signed up for
04:07 - for my Bluehost account and the domain
04:11 - is iOS quiz comm so I was in the future
04:14 - I was planning to create some sort of
04:15 - quiz
04:17 - to aid in the learning for iOS
04:19 - programming and so that's why I
04:21 - registered that domain iOS quiz comm
04:24 - okay so what I did here was I created a
04:28 - new database I just typed in sample DB
04:30 - like that and I clicked on create
04:32 - database and that created this guy right
04:34 - here the seconds that we need to do is
04:36 - to create a MySQL user because through
04:40 - that user we query the database we
04:43 - create new rows we delete rows and
04:46 - update and do all sorts of things like
04:48 - that so we do that through a user and in
04:52 - fact the web service that we create will
04:54 - actually use this user account to
04:56 - perform all those operations so what I
04:59 - did here I've already created a user and
05:01 - I called him DV user again there's this
05:05 - prefix here so the full user name would
05:07 - be iOS quiz 1 underscore DB user now you
05:10 - could put anything that you want and I
05:12 - specified a password for it and then I
05:14 - clicked on this button to create a new
05:15 - user and the third step is finally to
05:18 - give access to that user to the sample
05:22 - DB so you can see here that I can select
05:25 - a user I can select a database and I can
05:28 - add that user to the database so when
05:32 - you add a user to a database it's going
05:34 - to ask you what sorts of permissions do
05:36 - you want to give this user towards
05:38 - accessing the database so let me see if
05:41 - I can get back to that screen so that I
05:43 - can show you what that looks like I
05:45 - think maybe if I click here yeah so
05:49 - you're going to see a screen like this
05:50 - and by default all of it would be
05:54 - unchecked right so you're going to have
05:56 - to check off to individual privileges
06:00 - that allows now I'm not sure what the
06:02 - best practices are but just my common
06:05 - sense tells me that I probably should
06:07 - not if this were a production
06:09 - application it should not just
06:11 - willy-nilly give this user all of the
06:14 - privileges because for example some of
06:16 - these are pretty dangerous
06:17 - I think drop right this is for dropping
06:19 - a table so this user would be able to
06:22 - delete complete tables right this would
06:25 - allow them to create my SQL
06:29 - procedures I think that's what they were
06:31 - called in sequel server Microsoft sequel
06:34 - server but here they might be called
06:37 - routines it's been a while since I've
06:39 - worked with those and here you'd be able
06:43 - to create tables and you'd be able to
06:44 - delete rows and stuff like that so it
06:46 - really depends what you're going to be
06:49 - doing with the web services for example
06:52 - if you're only want to read data from
06:54 - the database to your iPhone app then I
06:58 - would say you just need to select write
07:02 - but however if your iOS app is going to
07:06 - be sending commands and sending data to
07:08 - maybe insert rows or update rows then
07:11 - you might need you know update and
07:13 - insert wherever that is there is so for
07:21 - me in doing this demo I didn't really
07:24 - want to bother with any of that so I
07:25 - just enabled everything but I want to
07:27 - make it clear to you that for demo
07:30 - purposes it may be okay but if you know
07:32 - don't use this for production so later
07:34 - on the series I'm going to take a deeper
07:37 - dive with familiarizing myself with what
07:39 - the best practices are for this sort of
07:41 - thing and I will create some additional
07:43 - videos for these series so you know as
07:47 - to show you guys what you should do but
07:50 - for this demo right now just because I
07:52 - want to quickly get the iOS app reading
07:56 - data from the database I don't want to
07:58 - have to worry about privileges so I just
08:00 - enabled everything when I added this
08:02 - user into this database okay so be
08:06 - careful about that okay so after you've
08:11 - done that you've created a new database
08:13 - you've created a new user you've added
08:16 - the user to the database and use you
08:19 - know enabled the proper permissions for
08:22 - that user to access the database you're
08:24 - good to go we're going to go back now to
08:27 - the control panel and we're going to
08:32 - scroll down all the way to database
08:35 - tools again and I'm sure there's a
08:39 - couple of different
08:41 - maybe administrative panels that you can
08:43 - use from here but the one now I'm
08:44 - familiar with using as PHP myadmin
08:47 - so I go ahead and I click that it's
08:50 - going to bring me into sort of a control
08:53 - panel to manage that database ok so this
08:58 - is what it looks like on this left hand
09:00 - side I have the databases you can see
09:03 - iOS quiz 1 underscore sample DB if I
09:06 - click that it might be confusing if
09:10 - you've never worked with MySQL before
09:12 - now this it might be hard to tell but
09:16 - this is a table a database table in my
09:18 - database it's called locations I didn't
09:20 - have this before so in order to create a
09:22 - new table I just typed in the name here
09:25 - so I typed in locations and I had 4
09:29 - columns because I was planning to add
09:31 - for the table for each row I needed a
09:35 - location name I needed a location
09:37 - address and then a lot and along so the
09:41 - coordinates representing where that
09:44 - location is so that's why I chose four
09:46 - columns so after you create your table
09:49 - you can actually click into it and then
09:52 - you can add your columns let me see if I
09:55 - can show you that under structure yeah
09:58 - here see I've added a bunch of these
10:01 - columns here so I've added a name
10:04 - address latitude longitude and there's a
10:07 - data type associated with each column as
10:10 - well now I put varchar' and varchar' is
10:14 - kind of like a variable character can be
10:16 - you know letters or numbers or anything
10:19 - like that and this 50 in brackets
10:22 - decided represents the length of that
10:25 - field so it's going to be up to 50
10:27 - characters long so I put 50 for the name
10:31 - and the address and I put 15 for the
10:34 - coordinates so that's the structure of
10:39 - my locations database table now the next
10:42 - step that I did was I added data to it
10:45 - so you can see here you click browse to
10:48 - browse the data for the table I only
10:50 - have two rows of data one is Apple so
10:54 - the Apple headquarters the address is
10:56 - one Internet loop Cupertino California I
11:00 - don't think they've moved yet or maybe
11:03 - they have so maybe this address wouldn't
11:05 - apply but any case this tutorial was
11:08 - done a while back so this was their
11:10 - address and this was the coordinates for
11:13 - it and this is the Google headquarters
11:17 - so same thing and there's tons of
11:20 - websites out there where you can
11:22 - actually punch in an address and it's
11:24 - going to return to you what the
11:27 - coordinates for that address are so a
11:30 - simple Google query is going to turn up
11:33 - those websites for you you can type in
11:35 - something like get latitude or something
11:37 - like that for address and you're going
11:39 - to see a ton of sites that's that will
11:42 - help you with that okay so that is it
11:45 - for creating the database and populating
11:48 - it with these two rows of data because I
11:50 - did this already I'm sorry I couldn't
11:52 - show you actually step by step but my my
11:56 - tutorial here in step two it has a ton
11:58 - of screenshots and it's going to show
12:00 - you step by step basically how to create
12:04 - that database create that database user
12:06 - then add that user to the database and
12:09 - here you can see how I've enabled all
12:11 - these privileges and then going into
12:15 - phpMyAdmin and creating the table and
12:18 - then creating the columns for it here
12:22 - and then inserting some data into it you
12:25 - can see here really step-by-step
12:28 - instructions there and you can see that
12:30 - we end up in the same place with these
12:33 - two rows of data now in the next step we
12:36 - are going to write the PHP web service
12:39 - to query the database and you're going
12:41 - to see that in the next lesson
12:42 - so thanks for watching and I'll see you
12:44 - next time bye for now
