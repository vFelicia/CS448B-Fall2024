00:00 - hey Kaku what's up I've had a bit of
00:02 - time to play around with Xcode 11 and in
00:04 - this video I want to share with you 12
00:06 - changes and improvements that Xcode 11
00:09 - brings to the table now these thing
00:11 - features are really gonna help your
00:12 - productivity so stay tuned hey it's
00:20 - Chris and if this is your first time
00:21 - here welcome to code with Chris where we
00:23 - teach beginners how to make apps now
00:25 - before we dive into number one I have a
00:27 - question for you have you downloaded and
00:29 - used Xcode 11 yet let me know by leaving
00:32 - a quick comment below yes or no and on
00:34 - your way down there please hit the like
00:36 - and subscribe button if you haven't
00:37 - already
00:38 - I really really appreciate that alright
00:40 - let's dive in number one run your iPad
00:44 - apps on a Mac with a single check box
00:46 - and that's right
00:47 - so now you have the ability to what if
00:49 - you're building an iPad app to also
00:51 - allow it to be run on the Mac as a Mac
00:54 - app and it's very simple to do just go
00:56 - into your Xcode project under the
00:58 - project properties under deployment info
01:00 - there is a checkbox now for math but as
01:03 - you can see it requires catallena so
01:05 - make sure you have that installed if
01:07 - you're only building in the iPhone app
01:09 - unfortunately you're not going to be
01:11 - able to deploy it on a Mac so as long as
01:15 - you have iPad checked on you can go
01:17 - ahead and also check off the Mac one and
01:20 - it's gonna tell you how that's going to
01:22 - work
01:22 - now I haven't personally ran an iPad app
01:24 - on a Mac yet but if you have let me know
01:27 - how it is by leaving a quick comment
01:29 - below alright let's go to number two
01:30 - number two a more flexible and powerful
01:33 - editor area now apples whole deal now is
01:36 - that everything is a process of editing
01:38 - whether you're editing code or you're
01:41 - editing your UI using Swift UI so that's
01:44 - why they've invested a lot of
01:45 - improvements into the editor area now
01:48 - let me show you some of them they've had
01:50 - this new button up here now called
01:51 - editor options which allows you to
01:54 - configure the behavior of the editor
01:56 - pane that you clicked it for because
01:58 - later on you're going to see that we can
02:00 - add more editor panes so these are the
02:03 - options for this pane you can show that
02:05 - editor only which is what we're looking
02:07 - at now you can show a side by side
02:09 - canvas which is basically two
02:12 - preview your user interface if this were
02:15 - a swift UI file but it's not and also it
02:19 - requires OS Catalina or later which this
02:22 - computer doesn't have but later on I'm
02:24 - going to jump on my macbook where I have
02:26 - installed Catalina and I'll show you
02:28 - this canvas and action for now let's
02:30 - keep going assistant is what you're used
02:33 - to it's what we had in Xcode ten and all
02:35 - those prior versions it's going to show
02:38 - you the complimentary file to what
02:39 - you're looking at so this is great for
02:41 - the storyboard if you're looking here
02:43 - and I'm gonna jump into the assistant
02:45 - editor I'm gonna see the corresponding
02:48 - class for this view alright let's go
02:50 - back to our view controller and take a
02:52 - look at some of the other options here
02:54 - we've got layout and right now this
02:56 - doesn't make sense because we only have
02:58 - one editor pane right here but if we had
03:00 - multiple you could then orient it
03:02 - horizontally vertically and whatnot now
03:05 - mini-map this is an exciting new feature
03:07 - for the editor this shows you kind of
03:10 - like a bird's eye view of all of your
03:12 - code and if my code file were longer I
03:15 - would be able to then drag this I would
03:17 - see these lines of code going all the
03:19 - way down and I could drag this little
03:21 - window to navigate my file really easily
03:24 - and this is in addition to the old jump
03:27 - list that we had I love this thing too
03:28 - because you can just select a method and
03:30 - jump down to that this one just shows
03:33 - you kind of like a high-level view of
03:36 - your code you can also hover over it and
03:38 - you can you can see what the methods are
03:41 - and you can see some of the keywords are
03:43 - highlighted as well so this mini-map is
03:45 - a much welcomed feature for navigating
03:48 - your editor now going down the list we
03:51 - have authors now right now this isn't
03:53 - connected to any sort of source control
03:55 - but if it were I would see a list of
03:58 - authors and commits that has to do with
04:01 - this particular file that I'm looking at
04:02 - so that's really handy to see who's
04:04 - changed what and when they changed it
04:06 - and why they changed it it's really
04:10 - handy for source control and code
04:11 - coverages for testing this shows you
04:14 - with the unit test that you have how
04:17 - well are you testing all of the code in
04:19 - this file and it's going to highlight
04:21 - all of the parts which are being tested
04:23 - and
04:24 - parts which are not Invisibles this is
04:27 - an option to show you the things that
04:29 - are there but that you can't readily see
04:32 - with the naked eye so for example if I
04:34 - turn this on you're going to see how
04:36 - many spaces there are you're gonna see
04:38 - it these are like line breaks and things
04:41 - like that
04:41 - alright so those are edit or options but
04:43 - not only this they've also allowed you
04:46 - to add as many editor panes as you want
04:49 - and to arrange them the way that you
04:51 - want so if you click this button here
04:54 - beside it add editor on the right you're
04:57 - gonna be able to just add a second pane
04:59 - and you can keep doing this you can just
05:01 - change the layout to what you want
05:03 - alright and sometimes you might want it
05:07 - to be above each other instead of beside
05:10 - each other if you hold down the option
05:12 - key you're gonna see that icon change
05:14 - and you're gonna end up adding an editor
05:16 - in the opposite direction so again you
05:19 - could do that I could hold down this
05:21 - option key and I can add one to the
05:22 - right of this one and then up here these
05:25 - are all independent instances of the
05:27 - editor so for this one I can maybe I
05:31 - don't need the mini-map for this one
05:33 - maybe I you know want to look at authors
05:35 - and for this one maybe I am looking at
05:39 - the storyboard so I want to look at the
05:42 - assistant editor as well right so it's
05:45 - very very flexible in terms of how you
05:48 - want to arrange this editor view so that
05:51 - you can be more productive when you're
05:52 - coding now some of the time I might want
05:54 - to click on a file and then choose where
05:57 - to put it into one of my existing editor
05:59 - panes you can do that too
06:01 - hold down option and shift on your
06:03 - keyboard and then click on a file that
06:05 - you want to load and that launches
06:07 - something called the destination chooser
06:09 - you can see that now I can choose a
06:11 - panel to load that file into or if you
06:14 - hover in between two editor panes
06:17 - you can insert a new editor pane with
06:20 - that file right where that blue line is
06:22 - like that so all-in-all I really like
06:25 - the new editor area especially if you've
06:27 - got a big monitor number three Swift UI
06:30 - and the preview canvas we can't mention
06:33 - xqo 11 without mentioning Swift UI right
06:35 - now here I've got a swift you
06:38 - project in the editor if we go into the
06:40 - editor options and we choose canvas
06:42 - we're going to get to see the preview
06:44 - canvas now if I click resume it's going
06:47 - to show me on the right-hand side what
06:49 - my UI looks like based on the code here
06:53 - as you can see we've got hello world in
06:57 - our little preview canvas here now if I
06:59 - change the text here let's say just
07:02 - hello you're gonna see it updating there
07:05 - in a live preview now this makes it
07:08 - really awesome because you don't have to
07:10 - launch your simulator and see how your
07:12 - UI looks back then we have storyboards
07:13 - it was still visual but some of the time
07:16 - it would be very glitchy and what you
07:18 - see in the storyboard is not what you
07:21 - get actually when you deploy it to your
07:22 - device
07:23 - now hopefully with this premium canvas
07:25 - it's not the case but only time will
07:28 - tell
07:28 - personally I'm really excited to start
07:30 - working with Swift UI and start teaching
07:32 - it to beginners because as much as I
07:34 - like using storyboards for teaching and
07:37 - content creation people still miss click
07:40 - miss drag and make mistakes in
07:43 - storyboards and then they run into
07:45 - roadblocks at least with Swift UI and
07:47 - how we're building the UI
07:49 - programmatically with code here it's a
07:51 - lot less prone to errors because
07:53 - beginners can see exactly what you're
07:54 - typing there and if they type the exact
07:56 - same thing they should get the exact
07:58 - same UI that you're seeing as for how
08:00 - useful Swift UI is right now at the
08:03 - moment I would say not very first of all
08:05 - it hasn't been really tested in
08:07 - production it's still an infant
08:08 - technology in terms of career-wise a lot
08:11 - of companies aren't willing to invest in
08:13 - brand-new technology for their
08:15 - production assets in terms of learning
08:19 - there is beginning to be Swift UI
08:22 - tutorials but by far the majority of
08:25 - content out there tutorials courses you
08:27 - name it it's all still based on either
08:29 - programmatic UI or storyboards in
08:32 - interface builder so it's gonna be a
08:34 - little hard to find content to learn
08:36 - from and shameless plug I will be
08:38 - releasing a lot of so if UI tutorials on
08:40 - this channel so if you're interested in
08:42 - picking up Swift UI and learning it
08:44 - please make sure you subscribe and hit
08:46 - that Bell notification icon so you get
08:48 - notified when those videos
08:50 - Trump thank you so much for your support
08:52 - all right moving on number four features
08:56 - to work with the new iOS dark mode so
08:58 - here in the storyboard if you go down to
09:00 - the view as section here
09:02 - traditionally you can choose the device
09:04 - and orientation but there's also an
09:06 - interface style section now that you can
09:09 - choose dark mode and you can preview how
09:11 - your interface is going to look like in
09:13 - the new iOS dark mode but in addition to
09:16 - that there are some really cool features
09:18 - where you can customize assets and
09:21 - colors to change dynamically depending
09:24 - on whether the user is using the light
09:26 - or dark mode let me do a quick
09:28 - demonstration for you so let's take a
09:30 - look at light mode here why don't we add
09:33 - an image view I'm just gonna pop it in
09:36 - the middle here and I'm going to just
09:39 - add an asset here let's go into the
09:41 - asset catalog and let's choose something
09:44 - like I'll choose Xcode since that's what
09:46 - we're doing I'm going to add that PNG
09:49 - directly into there so it's kind of a
09:51 - dart PNG it's gonna look you know
09:55 - alright in our image view here in light
09:58 - mode but if you go into dark mode you
10:01 - can see that that graphic image is not
10:04 - really visible anymore so we can
10:06 - actually tell Xcode that we want to use
10:08 - a different graphic if the user is using
10:11 - dark mode and you don't even have to
10:13 - write any code so you go into your asset
10:15 - catalog and you choose the asset and
10:17 - then under appearances you can actually
10:19 - set you can choose which modes that this
10:23 - graphic is going to be used in so we use
10:26 - it in light and dark and you can see
10:27 - here that any appearance should be sort
10:30 - of a universal icon that appears great
10:33 - in dark or light these are light
10:35 - specific and dark specific so for you
10:38 - know for the universal I can do
10:40 - something like that now these are not
10:42 - the right sizes I'm just dragging it
10:43 - there but for example in dark mode I can
10:46 - use something like that which might look
10:48 - a little better and we can actually see
10:50 - this in action if we go here so if we
10:54 - now view as dark mode you can see that
10:56 - that graphic asset changes to use the
10:59 - icon that I specified for dark mode all
11:01 - of this happens automatically with
11:03 - any code and in addition to that you can
11:07 - also do it with colors so let's just add
11:09 - a new color set and we're gonna create
11:11 - our custom color here maybe we'll make
11:14 - this like a code with crisp blue
11:16 - something like that not quite but fine
11:19 - and we're gonna we're gonna call this
11:23 - CWC blue all right so you can do the
11:28 - same thing here in appearances just
11:30 - because some colors might not show up
11:32 - that well in dark mode versus light mode
11:35 - so you're gonna again choose this and
11:37 - then you're going to be able to specify
11:39 - for dark mode I want you know this color
11:43 - is dead and if we go back to our
11:46 - storyboard and let's say we want to
11:48 - change the background to our label to
11:50 - our CWC blue all right in light mode
11:54 - it's gonna look like that but in dark
11:55 - mode it's gonna use the color that I
11:57 - specified so I think that is so cool
12:01 - number five localized image assets
12:04 - without writing a single line of code
12:06 - let me show you how this works so for
12:09 - example let's say we had an image asset
12:11 - that was a flag so this might be
12:15 - localization specific if I wanted to
12:18 - change this depending on what the locale
12:20 - of the user was I would just go to my
12:21 - image asset and click this localize
12:23 - button down here when I do that I get to
12:26 - select a language now right now I have
12:28 - just English but you can see now this
12:32 - icon set is for English if I have other
12:35 - locales I can select those as well and
12:37 - they would create different icon sets
12:40 - for me to add icons to and depending on
12:43 - what locale the user is who is using
12:46 - your app it would select the right icon
12:48 - set to use and all of that happens under
12:50 - the hood without you having to write any
12:52 - code at all number six SF's symbols now
12:56 - in the previous part you saw me dragging
12:59 - icons from icons 8 well Apple has
13:02 - designed a set of icons for us to use
13:04 - out of the box and it's integrated into
13:07 - Xcode making it very convenient so as
13:09 - you can see here there's an icon set of
13:11 - over 1500 icons in all sorts of sizes
13:16 - and weights as well
13:17 - so if you wanted to browse all of the
13:19 - available icons you could download the
13:22 - SF symbols app from here and then that
13:25 - would allow you to search and browse but
13:28 - also inside Xcode let's say I wanted to
13:31 - let's just go back to the storyboard
13:33 - let's say I wanted to use one of those
13:35 - symbols I could click on my image offset
13:38 - and under this image drop down instead
13:41 - of just looking at the assets that I
13:43 - have in my asset catalog here are those
13:46 - sf symbols as you can see these are very
13:49 - commonly used in different sorts of apps
13:53 - for different tasks and actions so I can
13:56 - choose something like that and the best
13:57 - thing about these icons is that they
14:00 - work great with dynamic type meaning
14:03 - that if the user has their font sizes
14:05 - larger it may be bolder because they
14:08 - can't see as well
14:09 - these SF symbols would adjust according
14:12 - to those font settings on that user's
14:14 - device and as you can see the symbols
14:16 - can be colored depending on your project
14:18 - tin colors as well so I highly recommend
14:20 - that you use SF symbols wherever you can
14:23 - because you get so much functionality
14:25 - for free number seven the iOS simulator
14:29 - has been improved and one of those
14:32 - things that has been proved is that now
14:34 - it's rebuilt using the metal framework
14:36 - so this means that it's really really
14:38 - fast
14:39 - well at least faster than it was before
14:41 - by a huge margin you're just gonna have
14:44 - to try it out for yourself to believe if
14:46 - you've worked with previous versions of
14:48 - Xcode before I think you'll notice a
14:50 - huge difference right away in how fast
14:53 - this simulator boots up and speaking of
14:55 - simulator improvements we have improved
14:57 - debugging options with the simulator so
15:01 - let me just quickly demonstrate that I'm
15:03 - just gonna hop back into Xcode and rerun
15:06 - this project of ours and you'll notice
15:11 - down here there is this little icon for
15:14 - environment overrides or environment
15:17 - variables and this allows you to control
15:19 - on-the-fly
15:20 - different configurations for your
15:23 - simulator to simulate different
15:25 - conditions of the device so here's light
15:27 - and dark you can switch that this is
15:29 - also great for testing
15:31 - friendly in terms of accessibility your
15:34 - app is for example if you toggle text on
15:37 - some people might have their text set
15:39 - way up high some might have it set low
15:41 - and you can toggle this on-demand on the
15:44 - fly just to see how your app reacts in
15:47 - addition to that you have these
15:50 - different options all of them to make it
15:52 - really really easy to make sure that
15:54 - your app is highly accessible now in
15:57 - addition to testing your app under those
15:59 - environment variables and those
16:01 - accessibility options that I showed you
16:03 - you can also put your app under
16:06 - different network and thermal conditions
16:09 - let me show you where this exists so you
16:11 - need to test this on a real device if
16:13 - you go under window and you go to
16:15 - devices and simulators you're going to
16:18 - see the devices tab and I have my phone
16:21 - connected right now under here you're
16:23 - going to see a section called device
16:25 - conditions now typically I think you
16:29 - would see something here but I don't
16:31 - have iOS 13 installed on my phone yet
16:33 - and so I think that's why I don't see it
16:36 - here but in this section you're going to
16:38 - be able to set throttled network
16:41 - conditions so you can test your app
16:44 - under low bandwidth situations and see
16:46 - how it operates and you can also mimic
16:49 - different thermal conditions so let's
16:51 - say your phone is in a really hot
16:53 - environment or maybe it's in a very cold
16:55 - environment and you can simulate those
16:57 - scenarios and test your app on your
16:59 - phone under those sorts of environments
17:01 - so I think that's really really cool how
17:03 - they figured out a way for us to do that
17:06 - number 9 they've integrated the Swift
17:09 - package manager directly into Xcode 11
17:12 - so if you're not sure what that is
17:14 - just think about cocoa pods it's a way
17:16 - for you to manage your third-party
17:18 - libraries and dependencies so let me
17:20 - just show you quickly how it works I'm
17:22 - looking at a very popular third-party
17:24 - library here called Alamo fire that
17:26 - helps with networking so let's say we
17:29 - wanted to use this in our project in the
17:32 - past if we're using cocoa pods we'd have
17:33 - to jump through all these different
17:34 - steps just to integrate cocoa pods and
17:37 - then to add that pod to our library here
17:40 - I'm going to show you how to do it with
17:42 - the Swift package manager
17:43 - directly in Xcode 11 so we're gonna copy
17:46 - this URL here or this repository URL all
17:51 - right so here inside Xcode you click
17:52 - your root node here and then go to your
17:55 - project and you're gonna see a tab
17:57 - called Swift packages click that and
17:59 - then you're gonna see right now there
18:02 - are no packages but you can click this
18:03 - little plus icon and then you can enter
18:05 - in that your L just like that click on
18:08 - next it's going to ask you what version
18:10 - that you need and then choose next it's
18:14 - gonna grab it and then you can just hit
18:16 - finish and you'll see it all right so
18:23 - let's click finish and you're actually
18:24 - going to see it here now the really cool
18:26 - thing is that this code is searchable as
18:28 - well and all of that you can do without
18:30 - ever leaving Xcode number 10 source
18:34 - control improvements now Xcode has
18:36 - always had integrated source control but
18:38 - they've implemented now the git stash
18:41 - command which lets you stash away some
18:42 - changes and bring it back later now
18:45 - they've also implemented the git
18:46 - cherry-pick command so that you can
18:48 - apply some of the changes in some of the
18:50 - commits to your branch in Xcode 11
18:53 - there's also a source control history
18:55 - inspector now which shows you a history
18:58 - of all of the commits for your project
19:00 - number 11
19:02 - test plans Apple has rolled out a new
