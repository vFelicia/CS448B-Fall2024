00:00 - [Music]
00:09 - hey guys it's Chris here for another
00:10 - episode of the xcode tutorial series So
00:13 - today we're going to be talking about uh
00:16 - adding files to your excode project so
00:19 - let's get
00:21 - started hey guys so we're here talking
00:23 - about adding files to xcode and you can
00:27 - download this xcode project in the link
00:30 - below or you can click The annotation to
00:32 - download it but it's just the fresh
00:34 - project that I created right now so as
00:37 - you can see you know all the files are
00:39 - here in my project folder and if I pull
00:42 - up finder you can see that it's added
00:45 - all those files and dumped it all in one
00:48 - directory so I mentioned before that I
00:50 - kind of like to organize them
00:52 - into uh different
00:54 - folders now one way you might start to
00:59 - do it is you might
01:00 - right click on the project Navigator and
01:02 - you might say new group you know and
01:04 - view
01:06 - controller and I mentioned before that
01:09 - if you create that group and then you
01:13 - drag your view controller into it your
01:16 - files there and you organize it this way
01:18 - in the project that's great but it
01:20 - doesn't actually change any of the files
01:24 - on the file system it doesn't organize
01:25 - it there so you can imagine if you have
01:28 - a really large comp complex project with
01:30 - a ton of files and you organize it this
01:32 - way
01:33 - then um your source code in your you
01:38 - know actual file system is going to be a
01:40 - mess it's just going to be one folder
01:42 - with all of your files in it so what I
01:45 - usually do how I usually start off is I
01:49 - kind of remove all of these files here
01:52 - and you don't want to delete them so you
01:54 - right click delete I mean you don't want
01:56 - to move them to the trash you just want
01:58 - to remove the project reference to it
02:02 - so then I will go into my file system
02:06 - and I'll create the actual
02:17 - folders and now move the files into them
02:20 - on the file
02:23 - system and then I will actually drag it
02:28 - into uh my
02:31 - project so it brings up a dialogue like
02:34 - this and it's just saying so this check
02:37 - mark sometimes if you're dragging files
02:40 - from uh outside of the project so let's
02:42 - say you had some images and it was
02:44 - sitting outside of your project if you
02:46 - had this checked off then it would
02:48 - create a copy of that item in your
02:51 - project folder and you usually want to
02:53 - do this because if you don't copy it
02:56 - into your project folder and then you
02:58 - you zip up the source code and you send
02:59 - it to someone then you might be missing
03:02 - files and here we talked about groups
03:06 - versus folder references and I'm
03:07 - actually going to go into that a little
03:09 - bit more in the next video kind of pros
03:11 - and cons of each but for now I'm going
03:13 - to create uh them as groups so add to
03:17 - targets if you've if you just created a
03:20 - single application then you're just
03:22 - going to have this one Target and it
03:24 - should be the name of your app but some
03:26 - xcode projects may have multiple build
03:29 - targets and that's a future topic so for
03:31 - now you know that's checked that's fine
03:34 - but if you had multiple build targets
03:35 - you would be able to select which Target
03:38 - you want this file to be included into
03:41 - so finish and then it goes ahead and
03:43 - adds it as a group and adds it in there
03:45 - and in the future if I wanted to create
03:49 - a new file I would rightclick and then
03:51 - create a new
03:53 - file let's just create a attempt
03:56 - class and then it would ask me where to
03:59 - save it at this point so I could save it
04:01 - in the folder I created on my file
04:05 - system and then in this manner uh it
04:08 - would still be uh it'll still be
04:10 - organized on the file system as it is in
04:13 - your project Navigator so let me delete
04:17 - that this time I do want to move these
04:19 - temporary files to the trash now another
04:24 - way that you can add files um aside from
04:27 - drag and drop is to rightclick and then
04:29 - go to um existing so add files to
04:34 - xcode project and then I can just select
04:39 - my whole folder and again you have these
04:41 - options here so I'm going to add it and
04:44 - there it's going to
04:46 - add my folder and view controller so
04:50 - these are still groups don't get them
04:52 - confused with uh folders so for example
04:55 - if
04:57 - I you know move my view controller file
04:59 - into the app delegate group that's not
05:02 - reflected in the file system I just want
05:05 - to reiterate
05:07 - that so now you guys know how to add
05:09 - files to xcode but what about organizing
05:11 - them in the next episode we're going to
05:13 - talk about folder references versus
05:16 - organizing your files in the groups um
05:20 - now for your fun fact of the day so did
05:22 - you know that the most expensive part in
05:25 - the iPhone is the retina display screen
05:29 - and it only costs
05:31 - $28 so my question to you guys is do you
05:34 - think the price of technology has gotten
05:36 - too high or do you think that all of The
05:39 - Branding marketing and research and
05:41 - development all of those costs justifies
05:44 - the price that you know an iPhone
05:46 - commands these days I think it's
05:48 - something like $500 or $600 for an
05:51 - iPhone let me know in the comment
05:53 - section below and I'll see you guys next
05:55 - time
