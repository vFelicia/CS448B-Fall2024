00:00 - hey guys what's up it's Chris here and
00:02 - in today's video I wanted to show you a
00:05 - video I recorded for a student in my
00:07 - course uh where I helped him
00:09 - troubleshoot his xcode project because
00:11 - he had a crash I want to show you this
00:13 - for two reasons um in case you are a
00:15 - beginner uh watching my channel uh the
00:18 - mistakes that he made in this project
00:20 - are very common for beginners so I think
00:22 - that will help you if you're just
00:24 - starting to build apps yourself and
00:26 - second of all um it illustrates the
00:30 - thought process I go through when I
00:32 - encounter a crash in the in the app and
00:35 - kind of what steps I take to try and
00:36 - find out what's wrong so that will be
00:38 - very helpful if you're just starting to
00:40 - get the hang of debugging before I show
00:42 - you that video though there's two things
00:44 - I want to mention first are these learn
00:47 - Swift challenges uh I think there were
00:51 - it was a couple of videos ago when I
00:52 - introduced them so if you haven't tried
00:54 - them yet please do so because it's going
00:56 - to really reveal what you don't
00:59 - understand and what you forgot frankly
01:02 - so try out these challenges even if you
01:04 - cannot complete them because it will
01:06 - tell you what you don't know and um I
01:09 - will be posting solutions for them very
01:11 - shortly this week and second of all if
01:13 - you have completed them please be sure
01:16 - to come on this page and click to tweet
01:18 - let me know and I will add your name
01:21 - here there's still a couple of names I
01:22 - haven't added yet but I'll do so soon
01:25 - and the second thing is that um I have
01:28 - been busy
01:30 - um grabbing all of the success stories
01:32 - and putting them on one page here and
01:35 - there are more but I've I need to take a
01:39 - break from doing this so this is not all
01:41 - of them but anyways I feel like this is
01:43 - useful because you can you can click on
01:45 - an icon and then you can go to that
01:49 - story where it illustrates um there's a
01:53 - little tiny interview with the
01:55 - developer and it tells you what their
01:57 - Lessons Learned were and kind of what
01:59 - their struggles were and if you're
02:02 - building your app for the first time um
02:05 - this may be helpful for you as well all
02:07 - of these people who built and published
02:09 - these apps were beginners to the iOS
02:11 - platform who had built apps before now
02:15 - if you've followed my videos or you've
02:17 - learned from my videos or my articles
02:20 - and you've built an app I'd love to hear
02:21 - about it please uh send me a message can
02:24 - be an email and let's get your app
02:26 - featured on this page as well okay so
02:28 - with those two things out of the way
02:30 - let's get down to the debugging video I
02:32 - hope you guys enjoy
02:34 - it hey Jacob it's Chris here I thought
02:36 - it'd be easier to show you what was
02:38 - going on with your project um in a video
02:41 - so I'm just going to build your project
02:43 - here and I took a look at the error
02:45 - message beforehand um it does say build
02:48 - succeed now but uh let me run the
02:52 - project and in running the
02:56 - project you get a
02:58 - crash right this itself doesn't tell you
03:01 - very much so usually what um what will
03:06 - give you an indication of what the error
03:08 - is is if you go down in this console
03:10 - area this debug console area and you
03:12 - scroll all the way to the top because
03:14 - what happens is the error happens and
03:17 - then there's some it gives you what the
03:19 - error message is here like a friendly
03:21 - one and then it dumps out all of this
03:24 - what's called a stack trace and um it
03:27 - has all of these memory addresses and
03:28 - kind of like low stuff which um is kind
03:32 - of not that useful you know and so you
03:36 - scroll to the top and you learn to
03:39 - recognize what the errors are so for
03:40 - this specific one here um the set value
03:44 - for undefined key this class is not key
03:47 - value coding compliant for the key
03:49 - fourth stack View and I can see the typo
03:52 - here and this error is probably the most
03:55 - common error that you'll find um among
03:59 - people who just starting to learn um so
04:02 - this happens a lot for the students in
04:03 - the courses and it's actually a very
04:05 - easy fix so what the problem is um it's
04:09 - when you connect something from your
04:12 - storyboard to your from the storyboard
04:16 - to the code file to the view controller
04:18 - I mean and let's say you make a typo
04:21 - like you did here right so you probably
04:23 - deleted that
04:25 - property so I'm just trying to open
04:27 - things up here so um just to give you an
04:29 - example so you might have done something
04:31 - like this where you're looking at the
04:32 - fourth stack view here um you hold down
04:35 - control and then you know you drag a
04:37 - line over here on your uh view
04:39 - controller you let go and then you start
04:41 - typing in your outlet and then you you
04:43 - know type something you click connect
04:46 - and then you realize that oh no I made a
04:48 - typo so then what you do is you delete
04:51 - this outlet that was the typo and then
04:54 - you try and connect it
04:56 - again um and this time you type it
04:58 - incorrectly well the problem is is when
05:01 - you delete that typo IB Outlet um the
05:06 - connection from the element to that typo
05:09 - still exists so that's why it crashes
05:12 - because it's looking for you know fourth
05:15 - stack view with an H instead of a k and
05:17 - it can't find it cuz you you know
05:20 - obviously you've corrected it here and
05:23 - this is your you know final Outlet so if
05:25 - I go ahead go into this document outline
05:28 - right here and I rightclick on this
05:29 - stack view I'm actually going to see
05:31 - that this element is connected not only
05:33 - to this fourth stack view Outlet it's
05:36 - also going to be connected to this typo
05:39 - outlet that no longer exists and it's
05:42 - also going to be connected to the one
05:44 - that I just made up and deleted so all
05:48 - we have to do is right click that
05:49 - element you can see here it's connected
05:51 - to um fourth stack view this is the
05:54 - correct one this is the type of one and
05:57 - this is that random jumble of letters
05:59 - that I typed see it's connected to all
06:00 - three so when you run your app it's
06:02 - going to look for these connections
06:04 - which don't exist cuz we deleted those
06:06 - Outlets here so all you have to do is
06:08 - click this X on the one that doesn't
06:10 - exist anymore and leave the one that
06:12 - does exist right and after that running
06:16 - your project will be fine so that error
06:18 - that specific error is one that you're
06:20 - going to learn to recognize and the next
06:22 - time you see that message um you're
06:24 - going to you're going to recognize what
06:27 - it is okay so there's another crash one
06:29 - that I I haven't seen yet because I
06:32 - didn't actually let's see
06:35 - here uh constraint items must be an
06:38 - instance of UI view or UI layout guide
06:44 - so constraint items okay so this tells
06:47 - me that we are trying to create an NS
06:50 - layout constraint object and when we're
06:52 - trying to relate two items together into
06:55 - a constraint they must both be you know
06:58 - um
07:00 - a child eventually of uiv like they must
07:02 - be things that are shown in the
07:04 - storyboard so let's go ahead and try to
07:06 - find out where this is because it
07:08 - highlights this line again which isn't
07:10 - very
07:11 - useful so let's go into our code and
07:15 - we're going to double check everywhere
07:17 - where we uh create NS layout constraints
07:19 - so one very useful tip here I'm going to
07:22 - just copy NS layout constraint I'm going
07:25 - to hold down uh command shift and press
07:28 - F and I'm going to paste that there and
07:31 - what this is going to do it's going to
07:32 - search our entire project that's all the
07:34 - files in the project for NS layout
07:37 - constraint so you know I got this list
07:39 - here and I can just check every one of
07:41 - them so let's go and card first so here
07:45 - we are relating the card image
07:48 - view height is equal to nil not an
07:52 - attrib but that's fine image view we're
07:54 - setting the width okay that's fine top
07:58 - constraint the image view related to
08:01 - self so self is a type of a card it's a
08:05 - UI view that's fine they're both views
08:07 - right image view self that's fine okay
08:10 - so it must be these last two ones then
08:13 - let's see here nil not an
08:16 - attribute and it's layout
08:19 - card oh this this is the one that's
08:22 - wrong here you see height constraint
08:25 - you're relating card index but card
08:28 - index
08:30 - is this guy right here it's just an INT
08:32 - right so I think you actually meant to
08:34 - write card in there not card
08:37 - index so you can see how just scrolling
08:40 - up here and just reading this message
08:42 - gives you some indication of what's
08:45 - wrong and the more you see these and the
08:48 - more you you know find out the problem
08:50 - that was causing this message uh the
08:52 - more you're going to begin to recognize
08:54 - what these error messages tell you and
08:57 - the next time you see this one you kind
08:58 - of immediately have an idea of what to
09:00 - look for in your project okay so now
09:03 - let's run it again hopefully this is
09:06 - yeah build succeeded but let's hope it
09:11 - runs okay so I mean it it doesn't look
09:15 - like what it's supposed to I wonder why
09:19 - it's yeah there we go I guess we just
09:22 - didn't set it to landscape for this
09:23 - project yet but you get your cards and
09:25 - you get scrolling and I guess you
09:27 - haven't set the background yet but
09:29 - yeah now your project runs and I think
09:32 - that was a good exercise and I hope you
09:34 - learn something new so thanks for
09:35 - learning with me and I hope this helps
09:37 - bye for now
