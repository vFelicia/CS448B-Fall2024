00:00 - hello and welcome to the lesson for
00:01 - exercise now this exercise is meant to
00:04 - be completed after you watch lesson 4 of
00:06 - the beginner series so if you don't know
00:08 - what that is or you haven't watched it
00:10 - up to that point
00:11 - check out the beginner series I highly
00:12 - recommend it by clicking in the upper
00:14 - right corner or checking in the
00:16 - description below I'll link to lesson
00:18 - one alright so what I want you to do is
00:20 - download the assets for this user
00:23 - interface here and start up a new Xcode
00:25 - project and try to put this together I
00:28 - would pause the video at this point and
00:30 - attempt it yourself and if you get stuck
00:32 - or you can't position something
00:34 - correctly then come back to this video
00:37 - because I'm going to show you how to do
00:38 - it right now
00:39 - [Applause]
00:43 - [Music]
00:44 - all right so here I've got a brand new
00:47 - Xcode project and we are going to choose
00:49 - single view app I'm going to name this
00:52 - lesson for exercise solution now after
00:56 - building the war card game user
00:58 - interface I don't think that this would
01:00 - be too hard for you but it's just extra
01:03 - practice that never hurts right so we're
01:05 - going to go into the asset library and
01:07 - we're going to grab all of these assets
01:09 - and put them in now there's only three
01:13 - things to position and plus a bunch of
01:15 - labels so this is probably going to be
01:18 - relatively quick all right so the first
01:21 - thing we're going to do is add an image
01:23 - view by opening up the object library
01:25 - you can also click on icon up there to
01:27 - do that we're going to set this image to
01:30 - be the image of the girl and I'm going
01:33 - to make it
01:36 - I'm not going to constrain to margins
01:39 - and I'm going to make it zero from the
01:43 - top left and right now the reason why
01:46 - I'm hesitating is because I do I do
01:49 - probably want to constrain it to the
01:52 - safe area and we're going to set an
01:57 - image to that guy so click on the image
01:59 - view and then for the image choose the
02:02 - girl you can put her like that except
02:04 - her face looks stretched out so we're
02:07 - gonna change the content mode because by
02:09 - default it's gonna scale it we're just
02:11 - going to say aspect fit and so that's
02:16 - going to set that image view like that
02:19 - and then we are going to let me see if
02:24 - there's anything else I might actually
02:26 - want to do top and instead so it it was
02:29 - bothering me that this tip wasn't
02:31 - reaching to the top there so I'm gonna
02:33 - choose top instead and we're gonna want
02:36 - to add another image view let's just add
02:40 - these first so let's put that right
02:42 - there this is going to be the close
02:43 - button so go ahead and choose close and
02:46 - we're gonna align it to the top and the
02:50 - right so we are going to constrain to
02:53 - margins and we're going to leave it
02:55 - rather to the safe area and
02:57 - gonna say 20 and 20 20 from the top and
03:02 - 20 from the right so our X is right
03:05 - there and then we are going to add our
03:08 - little chat label or chat icon do that
03:12 - and this one's gonna be a little
03:14 - different so why don't we
03:17 - first let's add 20 from the right all
03:23 - right and the bottom is going to be
03:27 - equal to the image so that's what I'm
03:30 - going to say so this one if you enable
03:37 - the bottom here you're not going to be
03:40 - able to select the girl and so what I
03:43 - would recommend doing instead is you can
03:47 - always so here's one way to do it and I
03:50 - don't know if I showed you this exactly
03:52 - I don't think I did but you hold down
03:54 - control and you can click from this chat
03:56 - icon and you can draw a blue line to the
03:59 - girl image and when you let go you're
04:01 - going to be able to specify a constraint
04:06 - relative to that element so I'm going to
04:09 - choose bottom right and what that does
04:11 - let's go check out that constraint so if
04:14 - you have your chat icon click selected
04:18 - go to size inspector go down and you can
04:21 - see this constraint that gets added
04:23 - double click it it's going to bring you
04:26 - that to that constraint so the chat
04:28 - bottom is equal to the girl bottom so
04:31 - they're both aligned in terms of where
04:34 - they end at the bottom what I'm going to
04:36 - do is change this constant to negative
04:40 - 20 and that will like push it up a
04:41 - little bit that's going to say I want
04:44 - the bottom of the chat icon to align
04:47 - with the bottom of the girl image but
04:50 - minus 20 so that's going to bump it up a
04:52 - little bit so that's how that's how you
04:55 - get to do that
04:58 - let's add a label and again that's one
05:01 - way of doing it there's always multiple
05:02 - ways of doing things so let's add a
05:05 - label here and let's add let's give her
05:08 - a name so I think I told her Joana
05:13 - before I don't know if I spelled it
05:14 - exactly like that we're gonna change the
05:16 - font to a custom one and I don't even
05:22 - remember if this was the right font that
05:25 - I chose something like that and we're
05:30 - gonna just put it right there and we're
05:32 - going to do top left and right so the
05:37 - top is gonna be 20 the left is also
05:39 - gonna be whoops I'm editing the height
05:42 - now so when you start editing this
05:44 - checkbox and you click out of it make
05:46 - sure that that's unchecked or else
05:48 - you'll end up adding that constraint by
05:50 - accident and this one on the right hand
05:54 - side of that label I want to make it
05:56 - relative to the close button and I'm
05:58 - going to say 20 so that's just going to
06:01 - stretch out that label however let's see
06:06 - what this is set the horizontal hugging
06:13 - priority so this is what actually we
06:16 - talked about in the lesson 3 exercise so
06:20 - it's basically saying when there's too
06:22 - much space which of the two elements is
06:25 - going to expand to fill up that extra
06:28 - space because there is a property under
06:32 - the size inspector for all of these
06:34 - elements called content hugging priority
06:36 - and we're gonna we're gonna look at the
06:39 - horizontal aspect of it so we're gonna
06:42 - it's basically saying of these two
06:45 - elements that are aligned here if
06:46 - there's too much horizontal space which
06:50 - element is going to expand to fill up
06:52 - that space and of course I would want
06:53 - the name label right because the names
06:56 - can be longer and shorter and so the
07:00 - tricky part is that content hugging
07:02 - means which element is going to not
07:06 - expand so the element with the element
07:11 - with the hi
07:12 - content hugging priority is going to
07:14 - retain its dimensions while the element
07:17 - with the lowest content hugging priority
07:20 - is going to end up expanding so what I
07:23 - actually want to do if I want this close
07:25 - button to maintain its dimensions I want
07:30 - to increase this guy's priority so I'm
07:33 - going to bump it up and you can
07:34 - instantly see that this label now
07:37 - expands to fill up that horizontal space
07:39 - okay so let's add a couple more labels
07:42 - here I'm going to add a label down here
07:45 - and this one is C so we're gonna do left
07:53 - top and right and the top is going to be
07:57 - relative to the girl and let's do a row
07:59 - left is going to be 20 and right is
08:02 - going to be 20 and we're gonna say that
08:06 - this label I like to and we're going to
08:14 - change this font and make this a little
08:18 - bigger
08:26 - all right and then we're going to add
08:28 - another label down here let's say that
08:33 - this one's going to be all four so the
08:37 - top should be relative to the I'd like
08:39 - to meet you label and the left yeah
08:42 - that's fine all the rest is fine
08:44 - actually all right so the top let's say
08:47 - it's ten points from that top one but
08:49 - it's 20 you know 20 from the left right
08:52 - and bottom boom so we have something
08:55 - like that and this label we can make it
08:57 - multi-line and then we can also add some
09:00 - text like some sort of I'm just gonna
09:04 - type in gibberish let's see see why it's
09:12 - not truncating here so I've got set
09:15 - vertical content hugging priority okay
09:18 - so same problem as up here except that
09:21 - this time it's on the vertical axis so
09:24 - we're going to say that in terms of all
09:28 - of this stuff this image will probably
09:32 - have the highest vertical hugging
09:35 - priority so at 255 let's say this label
09:40 - is going to be at 253 and this one is
09:44 - going to have the lowest priority
09:46 - because I want I want this guy at the
09:48 - bottom to expand to fill up any
09:50 - remaining space all right so this image
09:54 - is going to maintain the dimensions it
09:58 - has the highest priority at 255 this
10:01 - label is next that's gonna maintain its
10:03 - shape in terms of its second in priority
10:06 - and this guy has the lowest content
10:10 - hugging priority so if there's extra
10:12 - vertical space that's going to be the
10:13 - one that stretches out so there you have
10:16 - it I hope you learned a lot from doing
10:18 - this exercise and I'll see you in the
10:20 - next lesson
