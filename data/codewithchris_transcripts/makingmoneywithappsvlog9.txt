00:00 - hello and welcome back the mood Tracker
00:01 - app is really coming together and in
00:03 - this Vlog entry I want to give you a
00:05 - demo of it and show you the app icon and
00:07 - the app screenshots as we are Marching
00:09 - closer to the app submission date now
00:11 - just before we dive in just in case
00:13 - you're brand new here this is a raw and
00:15 - unscripted video format where I share
00:17 - our team's journey into building apps
00:19 - for profit all right so this Vlog entry
00:21 - is dated March 22nd 2024 with that said
00:24 - I hope you enjoy this entry hey welcome
00:27 - back so as we're getting closer and
00:29 - closer to April second our Target
00:31 - submission date of this app things are
00:33 - really coming together and there's a lot
00:35 - to see so let me show you the current
00:37 - state of the app so let me just yeah
00:41 - I'll just rerun the app in the
00:44 - simulator and I did a few entries
00:46 - already but when you come into the app
00:49 - this is the screen that you see you're
00:50 - going to be able to scroll and uh take a
00:53 - look at all the entries that you've
00:54 - logged let's take a look at the logging
00:57 - flow so if I hit this green button I can
01:00 - log a new entry so let's say I choose
01:03 - good I choose good to bad and then from
01:06 - here I could go back I can hit cancel
01:09 - but I cannot proceed until I hit to
01:12 - something let's say
01:14 - amused and then I can uh oh I can just
01:18 - decide that's all I want to log or I can
01:22 - continue on to log something more
01:24 - specific so I'm going to say it's
01:26 - freezing now because it's actually
01:27 - snowing outside and then
01:31 - uh I'm going to choose I'm with uh
01:34 - family and I could always add something
01:37 - so this is recording is something that I
01:39 - added just before when I was testing and
01:42 - this is a custom
01:46 - record um actually this should be
01:49 - activity now that I notice it this is a
01:51 - test build so there are things that
01:54 - aren't working 100% just yet you can see
01:58 - here is a preview of your entry how it's
02:00 - going to look so where I am is home and
02:05 - then it's going to prompt me am I done
02:07 - logging say yes and there it
02:10 - is so the other cool thing is that if I
02:15 - scroll if I go back far enough it will
02:19 - then dynamically load or go farther back
02:23 - in
02:25 - time and we should have a button I think
02:28 - there's a button in the design for me to
02:30 - jump back to the current date otherwise
02:32 - I am lost let me show you the calendar
02:34 - so if I hit this calendar icon we can
02:37 - see what the current date is all these
02:38 - little green dots indicate that I have
02:43 - sorry the black circle indicates that
02:45 - I've logged something the Green Dot
02:47 - indicates the current day I can tap on
02:50 - their current day here to jump back to
02:53 - oh I'm not able to tap that but let's
02:55 - say I tap on the 21st so that's another
02:59 - bug that I'm going to have have to log
03:00 - oh it works
03:02 - now or maybe there's something very
03:05 - specific that I have to tap so that's a
03:08 - problem but anyhow tapping a date is
03:10 - supposed to um bring you to that in the
03:13 - entry list and then I'm also supposed to
03:16 - be able to tap on the this thing to add
03:21 - an entry for that day just in case I
03:23 - missed something and I'm supposed to be
03:26 - able to tap on entries uh to edit what I
03:30 - wrote here so it's really cool to see
03:33 - this app coming together just being able
03:35 - to go through that flow and scroll
03:37 - through my entries and seeing this
03:39 - calendar that wasn't something that I
03:41 - was able to test out before so taking a
03:45 - look at the design let's see some of the
03:48 - things that are missing so the settings
03:51 - tab you'll notice that in our current
03:52 - build we don't have a tab bar down here
03:55 - there should be two tabs entries which
03:57 - is what we saw and settings
04:00 - so for settings this is something that I
04:05 - didn't show you in the last Vlog but we
04:07 - just have a couple of different things
04:09 - so rate the app is very important
04:12 - getting those ratings and reviews for a
04:14 - brand new app is very critical so that's
04:16 - the first thing contact support report a
04:18 - problem these are both ways for them to
04:21 - contact us to give us feedback or to
04:24 - report bugs and then about is going to
04:26 - slide up a little about text here so
04:29 - this this is just a placeholder text
04:31 - we're going to actually write something
04:32 - for that and privacy policy will link to
04:35 - the privacy
04:36 - policy and that's basically it we really
04:39 - wanted to keep this straightforward for
04:42 - launch this is what it looks like when
04:44 - you're tapping an entry you're supposed
04:46 - to be able to edit specific things that
04:49 - you chose or delete it Al
04:51 - together
04:56 - and yeah we're getting closer and closer
04:58 - we're getting there I also want to show
05:00 - you the app icon and screenshots because
05:02 - we're getting closer to app submission
05:04 - day wanted to start preparing these
05:06 - things ahead of time so these are the
05:09 - screenshots these are drafts so they're
05:11 - not final but this is what the
05:13 - screenshots would potentially look like
05:15 - app icons we did a couple variations we
05:17 - started with more cartoony feeli little
05:21 - dude there but we realized that nowhere
05:24 - in this app do we see any sort of
05:27 - cartoony figure or personification and
05:30 - so we decided to go more abstract
05:34 - design so also here would be how those
05:39 - different app icons look so we're going
05:41 - to choose one now before we end this
05:43 - Vlog I want to bring up another really
05:45 - cool interview that I watched recently
05:47 - on the app Masters channel that Steve
05:49 - did with Basher Basher sold an app
05:53 - within 12 months for six figures the
05:56 - cool thing is that in this interview he
05:57 - goes through the process that he uses is
06:00 - going from app idea to sale and what
06:03 - he's trying to do at each step in that
06:06 - process the thing that's really
06:07 - interesting to me is that I never really
06:11 - considered building apps to sell it's a
06:15 - new way of thinking for me that maybe
06:16 - hey for making money with apps maybe we
06:19 - should think about selling the App
06:20 - instead of trying to keep it going
06:23 - anyways I would recommend that you give
06:25 - this a watch it was very insightful for
06:27 - me if you are interested in building
06:30 - apps and selling them I'll link it in
06:32 - the description below thanks for
06:34 - watching and I'll see you in the next
06:35 - video
