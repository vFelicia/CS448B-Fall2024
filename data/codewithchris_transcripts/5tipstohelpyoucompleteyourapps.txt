00:00 - hey guys how's it going it's Chris here
00:02 - in this video I want to talk about a
00:03 - problem that I think a lot of people
00:06 - have myself included and that is trouble
00:09 - with finishing projects you see
00:12 - personally for me I don't know about you
00:15 - but this is how it is for me when I
00:18 - start a new project excitement is high
00:19 - motivation is high and that's what I
00:22 - want to work on the project you know you
00:24 - had all hours of the day but as time
00:27 - goes on if I hit roadblocks
00:29 - maybe something in life comes up I'm
00:32 - starting to loose theme a little bit and
00:33 - forget about my project then it
00:37 - eventually just dies off and ends up as
00:40 - a half-finished project in some folder I
00:43 - keep on my computer and I have like a
00:45 - ton of these folders so that is the way
00:48 - with me in this video I want to share
00:49 - with you guys some tips that I have to
00:52 - combat that and hopefully it's helpful
00:56 - to you guys if you guys suffer from the
00:57 - same problem now number one I think the
01:00 - most important thing especially for
01:01 - beginners is to basically scope out your
01:05 - project properly because a lot of people
01:07 - coming to this thinking they're gonna
01:09 - build this giant great app that
01:11 - everyone's gonna love and then as soon
01:13 - as they get a little bit into it and
01:14 - they start working in Xcode and Swift
01:16 - they start to realize wow it's a lot of
01:18 - work involved and then they have a busy
01:21 - schedule they have a family life and
01:23 - really there's not that much time to get
01:25 - this done and then they start realizing
01:26 - that maybe they can't get it done so my
01:30 - advice for you is to basically take a
01:35 - small core feature scoped version of
01:38 - your project and if you guys have read
01:41 - this book called the Lean Startup by
01:43 - Eric Ries that's basically what I'm
01:45 - talking about there's this concept that
01:47 - he talks about called MVP which is
01:50 - Minimum Viable Product and it basically
01:53 - is like the smallest feature set that
01:55 - you can have for your app where it's
01:57 - still useful and still solves the
01:59 - problem that it sets out to solve
02:00 - because the idea is that you don't want
02:02 - to build this massive giant thing and
02:03 - then no one likes it and you've wasted
02:05 - all this like resource time money effort
02:09 - into it you want to release this small
02:11 - little MVP and
02:13 - feedback on and maybe some people like
02:16 - something and they didn't like another
02:18 - thing you take that feedback and you
02:20 - create like a version too
02:22 - in the new version 3 and as you're
02:24 - creating these iterations your proxy and
02:26 - get better and better and better so
02:28 - that's the way that I think you should
02:30 - approach it as well and that's the way
02:32 - that I approach all of my new projects
02:34 - number 2 is to be specific about your
02:37 - app or your project a lot of people they
02:41 - want to build a social app or they want
02:43 - to build a game like Angry Birds or
02:46 - something that is very hand wavy I know
02:49 - I wave my hands a lot but just be very
02:53 - specific because if you're vague like
02:55 - that you can't do anything with it you
02:59 - said you want to build a social app how
03:01 - do you start working on that
03:02 - what do you start working on but if you
03:04 - say something like my social app will
03:07 - share photos the users will have the
03:09 - ability to take a photo they can apply
03:11 - one of five filters to it so everyone
03:13 - will be like blur filter - will be haze
03:15 - or whatever so the more specific you can
03:18 - be about it the more tangible it becomes
03:21 - and the more you have the more you can
03:24 - perform work on it because now you're
03:27 - you're thinking oh I need to figure out
03:29 - how to upload photos so then you go in
03:31 - and research that and work on that okay
03:35 - number three is to set a timeline
03:38 - because as a procrastinator which is
03:40 - what I suffer from I don't know about
03:43 - you you tend to put the things on the
03:46 - back burner that don't have deadlines
03:48 - and you're just dealing with the things
03:49 - that are due first so if your project
03:53 - doesn't have a timeline or a projected
03:55 - date where it needs to be done you're
03:58 - probably gonna push it off indefinitely
03:59 - especially when it comes time where
04:01 - you've lost that motivation and the
04:03 - excitement that's when you really need
04:06 - these other mechanisms to come and help
04:09 - you finish the project when you're
04:11 - excited and you're motivated you don't
04:13 - need a timeline you're you want to work
04:15 - on the project but the timeline the due
04:18 - date comes in handy when you've lost
04:20 - that steam and you just need to get it
04:21 - done number four we're talking about
04:25 - accountability
04:27 - and I find somewhere before I can't
04:29 - remember exactly where that the act of
04:32 - telling people that you're gonna do
04:34 - something is actually bad because when
04:37 - you tell people you're gonna do stuff it
04:39 - feels good to you the person telling
04:41 - that you're announcing in your you know
04:44 - you're you're making all of these
04:45 - promises it feels like you've done
04:48 - something it feels like you've taken a
04:49 - step towards your goal when in reality
04:51 - no work has been done um so I feel like
04:55 - having like one accountability partner
04:58 - or two maybe is really good but if
05:01 - you're just you know wave your hands
05:03 - saying you're gonna do stuff in general
05:05 - I don't think that's gonna get you
05:07 - anywhere so have someone that you know
05:10 - can tell you with brutal honesty maybe
05:13 - your significant other your mom your dad
05:15 - who's not afraid to really lay it on you
05:19 - tell them you're gonna do this and ask
05:22 - them to help keep you accountable okay
05:24 - so number what are we on number five and
05:27 - this is to work on this habit of not
05:31 - finishing projects because that's what
05:33 - this is it's not a character flaw it's
05:36 - not something you're born with I feel
05:37 - like it's a bad habit you've just
05:40 - personally me we've just got into the
05:43 - habit of not finishing what we started
05:47 - if you've read the book called the power
05:50 - of habit by Charles Duhigg they he has a
05:53 - framework and a lot of good techniques
05:55 - to try to turn bad habits around it to
05:59 - good habits into what you want so I
06:02 - highly recommend you give that a read
06:03 - but one of the things that you can do is
06:06 - ties in with that first rule which is to
06:09 - keep your projects scope small is to get
06:12 - all those quick wins by shipping apps so
06:17 - if you have an app idea or a project
06:19 - that is like small enough you can get
06:22 - actually complete it and get done I'd
06:24 - say that's a win
06:25 - you do that again that's the second one
06:27 - you keep doing that and you will get
06:30 - into the new habit of finishing what you
06:33 - started and that will cure the old habit
06:36 - that'll break the old habit so that is
06:39 - number five
06:40 - and you know I'm talking about all of
06:43 - this I hope it really helps you I don't
06:46 - know if you have the same problem but
06:48 - one of the things that I want to do with
06:50 - you guys is to have like a motivational
06:55 - challenge or like you know this this
06:57 - group of us that wants to build apps and
07:00 - wants to actually like get them done
07:03 - where we try to build and ship an app in
07:06 - a month so I'm gonna start a challenge
07:08 - like that this is like a little preview
07:09 - for our next week and it's free to join
07:12 - whoever wants to join I'll put some
07:14 - structure around it but that's something
07:17 - that personally I think will help me and
07:19 - hopefully help you guys whoever
07:21 - struggling with building and shipping
07:23 - apps to actually release apps and not
07:26 - just have half-baked apps so I'm really
07:29 - looking forward to launching that
07:30 - challenge with you guys and getting some
07:32 - apps built and shipped it together
