00:00 - hello in this video I'm going to explain
00:02 - what the standard app design workflow
00:04 - looks like the first step is business
00:07 - requirements gathering from that you can
00:09 - generate a set of wireframes which
00:12 - basically dictates where all of the
00:14 - controls and the data gets laid out on
00:16 - all of your screens with that skeleton
00:18 - in place you can actually put paint on
00:20 - it and create a set of design comps now
00:23 - the design comps are going to show you
00:25 - what your app will look like as a
00:26 - finished product then from the design
00:28 - comps you're going to generate all of
00:30 - the images that you need to import into
00:33 - Xcode to style your project so let's
00:36 - talk about each of these steps a little
00:37 - more closely during this step you'll be
00:41 - deciding what your app does it's not
00:42 - enough to say that you want to build a
00:44 - social media app really think through
00:47 - what the core features of your app will
00:48 - be then after you know what the core
00:51 - features are think about any additional
00:52 - supporting features that would be nice
00:55 - to have but not exactly a core feature
00:57 - the reason we make this distinction
00:59 - between what a core feature is and what
01:01 - a supporting feature is is so that you
01:04 - don't put all of your eggs in one basket
01:05 - meaning that you can create a smaller
01:08 - but essential version of your app
01:11 - containing all of the most essential
01:12 - features and release that first before
01:15 - you commit to building all of the
01:18 - features out just to discover that
01:20 - people don't like your app for some
01:22 - reason so it's a way of just sort of
01:24 - hedging your bets
01:25 - now you write down all of these features
01:27 - down into a document because you'll need
01:30 - to refer back to it and you might even
01:32 - need to show this document to other
01:33 - people now all of this upfront work is
01:36 - to provide a solid foundation for you to
01:37 - create your app design next up you're
01:39 - going to take these business
01:41 - requirements and organize your ideas
01:42 - into something that is visual
01:44 - specifically wireframes when you're
01:47 - working on wireframes you're focused on
01:49 - usability and organizing the information
01:51 - in a way that makes sense forget about
01:54 - how your app looks for a second and
01:55 - putting yourself in the shoes of your
01:57 - target user imagine they're using your
01:59 - app how do you present the data in a way
02:00 - that's easy to understand where do you
02:03 - put buttons and menus so that using your
02:05 - app is intuitive use tried-and-true
02:07 - structures that are ingrained in iOS
02:09 - users for example if your app has
02:12 - several different sections
02:13 - iOS users are very used to using a tab
02:16 - bar along the bottom so you can consider
02:18 - using that for app in this scenario
02:21 - sometimes when you're stuck try
02:23 - downloading some popular apps and tap
02:24 - around the app get a feel for how
02:26 - they're organizing their app to get some
02:28 - ideas for your own app what you want to
02:30 - get out of this phase is a set of rough
02:33 - wireframes that show all of the screens
02:36 - in your app and how the controls and
02:38 - data are laid out on each screen you
02:40 - don't need any fancy tools for this even
02:42 - just paper and pencil is fine the
02:45 - important thing is that this that forces
02:48 - you to stop and think through things and
02:50 - to make some decisions making sure that
02:53 - all of the business requirements are met
02:55 - because at this stage of the app
02:56 - development process things are still
02:58 - easy and cheap to change trust me you
03:01 - want to avoid a situation where you
03:03 - realize you're missing a requirement
03:04 - after the app has been coded at that
03:07 - point it's going to be costly to change
03:09 - things
03:12 - after you've got a solid idea for how
03:14 - your app is going to be structured it's
03:16 - time to give it a custom look and feel
03:17 - this is where your design skills are
03:19 - going to come into play
03:20 - using the wireframes as a guide you'll
03:22 - be using a graphics program to create
03:24 - the design some popular tools for doing
03:26 - design columns our sketch figma or
03:28 - photoshop i figure that i need to take a
03:31 - little bit of time to mention
03:32 - interactive prototyping this is where
03:34 - you turn your design comes into
03:36 - something that can be put on a device to
03:37 - be swiped through some of these
03:39 - prototypes can get pretty intense with
03:41 - tapping on hotspots to trigger different
03:43 - transitions the whole goal of an
03:45 - interactive prototype is to be able to
03:47 - experience something slightly more
03:49 - tangible than just design comps on the
03:51 - screen because at this point in the
03:53 - process things are still easy and
03:55 - inexpensive to change now this step is
03:58 - completely optional if you need to
03:59 - convince someone to invest in your
04:01 - business or maybe a potential partner
04:02 - then it could be useful to turn your
04:04 - design comps into a swipeable prototype
04:06 - on your device so that you can show it
04:08 - to people however if you're a developer
04:11 - building an app for yourself you can
04:13 - probably skip this step I spoke with
04:15 - some of my friends who are still in the
04:17 - consulting industry and they told me
04:19 - that they don't use interactive
04:20 - prototyping because their clients won't
04:22 - pay for it but the caveat is that their
04:25 - clients are long-term clients who have
04:27 - been with them building apps for a long
04:28 - time so they're used to knowing what to
04:31 - expect for other clients who are new to
04:34 - the app development process they might
04:36 - want to pay for an interactive prototype
04:40 - once your design is done you'll need to
04:42 - separate it out into pieces and export
04:45 - them as JPEGs and PNG images you'll put
04:48 - these images into your Xcode project
04:49 - where you'll apply them to the elements
04:51 - in your storyboard and when you're done
04:54 - your app will have a custom look and
04:56 - feel all right so that's the app design
04:58 - process hey did you join my free
05:00 - Facebook community yet that's where I
05:02 - hang out along with a ton of other
05:04 - people learning iOS just like yourself I
05:06 - also post early access to all of my
05:09 - videos inside that group before I put
05:11 - them on YouTube you can also get help
05:13 - with any questions you're having visit
