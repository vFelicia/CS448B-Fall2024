00:00 - in this video you'll learn how to
00:01 - configure subscription type
00:03 - in-app purchases through app store
00:05 - connect i'm going to show you all the
00:06 - tips and best practices to set up your
00:08 - in-app subscriptions
00:10 - and i'm going to walk you through
00:11 - step-by-step just how to do that through
00:13 - the app store connect portal
00:15 - hey code crew it's chris and welcome to
00:16 - code with chris the place to be if you
00:18 - want to learn how to code and build apps
00:20 - this is the second lesson in our revenue
00:22 - cat video series if you missed the first
00:24 - lesson
00:25 - be sure to check out the playlist right
00:27 - there here's where we are
00:28 - in our seven step process
00:32 - all right let's get started now let's
00:34 - configure our in-app subscriptions
00:36 - i do want to mention that revenuecat has
00:38 - an awesome piece of documentation they
00:40 - call the ios product setup
00:42 - and this one guides you through the
00:44 - process as well as providing
00:46 - very helpful hints on how to name your
00:49 - identifiers
00:50 - and how to set up your in-app
00:52 - subscriptions for future scalability so
00:54 - i'll be referring to this documentation
00:56 - as we go through this process and i'll
00:58 - also link to this
00:59 - in the description below the video
01:01 - alright so
01:03 - we're gonna set up two in-app
01:04 - subscriptions for this demo uh one is
01:06 - going to be
01:07 - a yearly access to unlock pro features
01:11 - and the second one
01:13 - is a monthly access to unlock the pro
01:16 - features so
01:17 - both subscriptions they unlock the same
01:19 - level of features
01:21 - it's just that one is yearly recurring
01:23 - and the other is monthly recurring
01:24 - all right so let's go ahead and select
01:26 - auto renewable subscription and click
01:28 - create now you're going to be able to
01:32 - specify two things here for your
01:34 - first subscription one is a reference
01:36 - name and this is not user facing this is
01:38 - just for
01:39 - your own reporting purposes so here you
01:41 - can use a name that would make sense to
01:43 - you
01:43 - so for example i might choose rev
01:47 - revcat demo annual and
01:50 - i might put the price or something like
01:52 - that so let's say
01:54 - 59.99 and let's see what
01:57 - revenue cat recommends down here so here
02:01 - here they are going through the process
02:02 - that we have
02:04 - and so they put the when it recurs the
02:08 - price
02:08 - and also any introductory offers because
02:12 - with your subscription you are able to
02:14 - offer some sort of
02:15 - a discounted access or trial even like
02:18 - maybe a zero dollar free trial
02:20 - um for a specified amount of time for
02:23 - first-time users
02:24 - so that's in their documentation this is
02:27 - what they're setting up
02:28 - and i'll show you how to set this up
02:30 - later but
02:31 - for my demo i wasn't planning to do an
02:34 - introductory offer at all so there's
02:36 - it's straight off the bat going to be
02:38 - recurring at
02:41 - 59.99 and then also product id
02:46 - so this one is very important to note if
02:50 - and here it also points it out a little
02:52 - bit so this product id is a unique id
02:55 - for your in-app purchase and this id
02:58 - spans across your entire account
03:00 - across all apps so whatever product id
03:03 - you put in here and you create this
03:05 - in-app subscription even if you delete
03:07 - this in-app purchase product
03:09 - in the future you're not going to be
03:11 - able to reuse the same id
03:13 - so it makes sense to have a little bit
03:15 - of organization
03:17 - and a sort of naming convention here and
03:20 - if you're following this documentation
03:21 - this is what they recommend
03:24 - so a good way to keep these ids
03:27 - organized
03:28 - is this sort of convention here app
03:31 - underscore
03:32 - price underscore duration underscore
03:37 - the introductory duration and
03:38 - introductory price
03:40 - so that results in something like this
03:42 - screenshot here rc
03:43 - underscore 39.99 underscore one year
03:47 - underscore one week at zero dollars so
03:50 - that's free
03:52 - so for us uh we're going to put
03:54 - something like
03:55 - rcd for revenue cat demo i'm going to
03:58 - put
03:59 - one oh actually the next thing is the
04:01 - price
04:03 - and then i would put one y as one year
04:07 - i'm going to go ahead and click next i
04:09 - don't have any introductory offer so i'm
04:10 - not going to
04:11 - fill in anything there and now we're
04:13 - going to be prompted to create a
04:15 - subscription group so
04:16 - what is that if you read this blurb it
04:19 - actually
04:20 - explains it pretty well it's basically
04:23 - grouping together different subscription
04:25 - products that the users can switch
04:27 - between
04:28 - but they can only be subscribed to one
04:30 - of those products
04:31 - inside that group at once so
04:34 - for example in this demo app we're
04:37 - offering
04:38 - to unlock some sort of pro access right
04:41 - and we want to let the user switch
04:42 - between
04:43 - yearly membership and monthly membership
04:45 - they might choose to
04:46 - upgrade or downgrade at any time right
04:48 - but they can only have
04:50 - one of them active we would put both of
04:52 - those in the same subscription group
04:54 - so that's what we're going to do here
04:56 - and
04:58 - if we take a look at the documentation
05:00 - let's take a look at right here
05:03 - they point out here that the reference
05:06 - name for this subscription group is
05:08 - actually not user facing so
05:10 - you're going to be able to it it's only
05:12 - you that is going to see this in your
05:14 - reporting so
05:15 - use something that makes sense to you
05:16 - all right so for me i'm going to call
05:18 - this
05:20 - the rev cat demo pro access
05:24 - subscription group and the reason i'm
05:27 - not putting the price or anything in
05:28 - here right now
05:30 - is because i'm going to be putting both
05:31 - the monthly and the yearly
05:33 - in the same group to let the user switch
05:36 - between the two
05:38 - and they're at different prices and so
05:39 - i'm not going to put the price in the
05:41 - group or anything like that
05:44 - so users can only subscribe to one
05:46 - subscription within a group at a time
05:47 - but can change subscriptions within the
05:50 - group
05:50 - as often as i'd like all right so let's
05:53 - go ahead and create this subscription
05:54 - group and then
05:55 - we're going to be able to configure our
05:58 - in-app subscription finally
06:00 - don't be worried if this takes a little
06:02 - bit this process i've
06:04 - found in creating a new ins app
06:06 - subscription
06:07 - or in-app product takes a little while
06:10 - for it to crunch behind the scenes
06:13 - while that's going on let's flip back to
06:15 - the documentation
06:18 - so here we can see that the next step is
06:20 - going to be setting the
06:21 - subscription duration and the price
06:25 - and the price is going to be uh
06:28 - different depending on
06:29 - the the locale and the currency so
06:31 - you're going to be able to fine tune
06:33 - all of that
06:36 - and then there's going to be a separate
06:38 - tab for introductory offers
06:40 - and according to this documentation is
06:42 - showing you how to set a free one-week
06:44 - trial
06:45 - so that's where you would set your
06:46 - introductory offers
06:49 - and then the next step would be to add
06:51 - localization
06:52 - so depending on which language you can
06:55 - provide
06:56 - different names for this subscription
06:58 - let's go back to app store connect
06:59 - and see all right so we've got our in
07:02 - app purchase subscription here
07:06 - so here's the reference name you can see
07:09 - this is the group reference name
07:11 - cleared for sale if you want this to be
07:14 - available for sale
07:15 - when it's approved you enable this
07:18 - for the duration this is where we're
07:20 - going to set this to one year because
07:21 - this is our annual subscription
07:24 - and then let's hit save first
07:27 - and then we're going to hit this plus
07:29 - button beside subscription pricing
07:31 - and i'm actually going to choose i'm
07:33 - going to choose usd
07:35 - because the 59.99 i was referring to usd
07:41 - so you can see here there are a lot of
07:43 - different
07:44 - sort of price levels but it's not a free
07:47 - form text field so you can't just
07:48 - specify any number you want but i think
07:51 - there are a lot of options here going up
07:53 - by
07:53 - one dollar amounts okay so let's click
07:56 - next
07:59 - and then we're going to be able to
08:00 - specify different prices for the
08:02 - different
08:03 - currencies and actually countries and
08:05 - regions
08:06 - so for example for canadians i can
08:08 - specify
08:10 - you know a different amount okay so i'm
08:13 - just going to go with the defaults here
08:14 - i'm going to click create and uh all
08:17 - right that's great
08:19 - and before we hit save this is where you
08:21 - can also
08:22 - put those introductory offers you can
08:24 - also customize some of this
08:26 - promotional offers but we're not going
08:28 - to do that in this video
08:29 - let's go ahead and hit save all right
08:32 - let's go back to our subscription by
08:33 - clicking this breadcrumb
08:35 - up here now
08:38 - we are going to set our localizations
08:41 - next so go down here hit this plus icon
08:43 - let's choose uh english us
08:47 - and let's choose a subscription display
08:49 - name and description
08:51 - now if you're unsure about where this is
08:54 - going to show up because this
08:55 - is user facing revenuecat has a handy
08:58 - diagram that shows you exactly where
09:00 - that is
09:00 - and so this is what we're filling out
09:02 - right now for english us
09:05 - and they have a tip here use the same
09:07 - description display name
09:09 - and the description for all of your
09:11 - products that unlock the same level of
09:13 - access
09:14 - this results in a much cleaner app store
09:15 - listing as your suite of products grow
09:17 - now this was really counter-intuitive to
09:19 - me in the first go
09:21 - because i wanted to do something like
09:24 - this i wanted to say
09:26 - you know annual pro access
09:30 - at 59.99 and
09:33 - you know put something like unlocks
09:35 - proaxis or whatever
09:37 - and the problem with this is that
09:41 - it's going to display this description
09:43 - name for
09:45 - all countries and regions so this price
09:48 - in the description name might not
09:50 - be the actual price that they end up
09:52 - paying because remember
09:54 - there's differences between the
09:55 - currencies and exchange rates right
09:58 - so if i'm in canada it's going to be
10:00 - 79.99 for me
10:02 - and if i see this in the subscription
10:04 - display name it's going to be really
10:05 - confusing and
10:06 - it's going to make me pause and stop in
10:09 - my tracks and not go
10:10 - forward with the purchase because i'm
10:11 - not sure what's going to happen next
10:13 - so there are other ways to
10:17 - grab the grab the currency and grab the
10:20 - price so you don't really want to put
10:23 - this in here
10:25 - so we can go with um go with the
10:29 - recommendation here
10:30 - and just call this pro access and this
10:34 - is the
10:34 - display name let me show you where this
10:37 - information
10:37 - shows up in an app store listing or
10:40 - on the screen where the user manages
10:42 - their in-app subscriptions
10:43 - so if you scroll down just a little bit
10:45 - more
10:47 - you'll see here when the user
10:50 - manages their subscription in the
10:52 - settings of their phone
10:54 - they're going to see the subscription
10:57 - group display name
10:58 - up here and then you can see the
11:00 - subscription display name
11:02 - which we have just said was pro access
11:05 - that's going to show up over there
11:08 - and then below that you're going to see
11:10 - the price and the duration
11:12 - so you don't need to restate the price
11:14 - or the duration
11:16 - in the subscription display name all
11:19 - right so let's go back
11:20 - to our app store connect and let's save
11:23 - this localization here
11:27 - and then the final piece to configure
11:30 - this
11:30 - specific subscription is to provide
11:33 - review
11:33 - information now you're going to have to
11:35 - put a screenshot of where it shows up in
11:38 - your app
11:38 - what it looks like and also some notes
11:40 - for the reviewer
11:42 - and when this passes and is approved
11:44 - then it's going to be
11:46 - available for sale the problem right now
11:48 - is that we're just
11:49 - doing development we don't really have
11:51 - any of this information yet
11:53 - but in order to sort of get this
11:55 - subscription to a state where we can
11:57 - actually
11:58 - you know use it in our development
12:00 - process and test it
12:01 - and see it we actually have to put in a
12:04 - dummy screenshot
12:05 - so i've prepared actually let me just
12:08 - tell you
12:10 - how you know the size if you click this
12:12 - little question icon and you click learn
12:14 - more
12:14 - you can see down here it sort of
12:17 - explains what all of the fields mean
12:20 - but down here this app review screenshot
12:22 - if we're
12:23 - if this is a in-app purchase for ios you
12:26 - can see that the screenshot must be at
12:27 - least 640
12:28 - by 920. and so i've just created a
12:32 - blank 640x920 image and that's what i'm
12:35 - going to put in here for now
12:40 - that one right there and you can see
12:42 - it's just the gradient you can use a
12:44 - solid color it doesn't matter
12:45 - and we're going to save this now in the
12:47 - future we're
12:48 - going to provide the real screenshot and
12:50 - some actual review notes before we
12:53 - submit the app
12:54 - for purchase or for review i mean
12:57 - all right so now let's go back to in-app
13:00 - purchases
13:02 - we're going to configure the monthly
13:04 - subscription now this is going to go by
13:07 - a lot faster
13:08 - in fact it's pretty much the same thing
13:10 - except for
13:11 - you know the duration and the product id
13:13 - and the pricing and so
13:15 - feel free to fast forward through this
13:17 - part i'll just also move a little
13:18 - quicker
13:35 - so i'm going to add it to the same
13:37 - subscription group because it's
13:38 - unlocking the same
13:39 - level of access and i want to let the
13:41 - user switch between
13:42 - monthly versus yearly all right so we've
13:45 - got our new monthly
13:47 - in-app subscription so again let's
13:49 - choose the subscription duration this
13:51 - time to one month
13:53 - i'm gonna hit save and let's add a price
13:56 - so here i'm gonna choose usd
14:00 - at uh where is that 9.99
14:04 - hit next all right i'm gonna go with the
14:08 - defaults and hit create
14:11 - okay let's save this and then let's go
14:14 - back to
14:16 - once that finishes saving
14:19 - all right let's go back to our in-app
14:21 - purchase and scroll down and add
14:23 - a localization for english us
14:30 - again this is going to pro access
14:33 - because it's unlocking the same level of
14:34 - access
14:35 - let's hit save and then let's
14:39 - add that screenshot that i had as a
14:42 - placeholder
14:44 - and we're going to hit save again
14:48 - all right let's go back to in-app
14:49 - purchases here
14:52 - the last thing we're going to need to
14:54 - configure is
14:55 - under subscription groups you know the
14:58 - one that we created to house
15:00 - the two the two in-app purchases
15:03 - we actually have to add some
15:04 - localization strings for this as well so
15:07 - you can see here in this group there are
15:09 - two levels they're going to be able to
15:10 - switch between the two
15:12 - and right here you're going to be able
15:14 - to add localization
15:21 - okay so this one actually gets displayed
15:24 - to the user
15:26 - this reference name just shows up in our
15:28 - reporting
15:29 - but this subscription group display name
15:32 - shows up
15:33 - when the user manages their
15:34 - subscriptions so let's go back to the
15:36 - documentation as you can see there
15:38 - it points out ocean journal subscription
15:41 - so that's exactly
15:42 - what they're going to see
15:46 - for this string here so i'm going to say
15:49 - rev
15:49 - cat demo subscription let's just call it
15:52 - that
15:54 - and the app name display options
15:58 - you can see down here the app name is up
16:01 - there ocean journal
16:02 - and the reason why it
16:06 - gives you two options just use the app
16:08 - name
16:09 - or to use a custom name is because
16:12 - what a lot of people do for their app
16:14 - name
16:15 - in the app store listing is they put a
16:18 - lot of keywords
16:19 - and and subtitles into their app name so
16:22 - it might be something like
16:24 - revcat demo dash the best tour app
16:27 - on the app store or something like that
16:29 - you know it wouldn't just be the app
16:31 - name because
16:32 - people like to use that space to maybe
16:36 - rank for extra keywords
16:37 - or to be more descriptive about what
16:40 - their app does
16:41 - so you're able to use a custom name if
16:45 - that's the case
16:46 - that way it's not going to have all
16:48 - those extra keywords and subtitle
16:50 - information
16:52 - in your subscription you know in this
16:55 - managed subscription part because it
16:57 - would look pretty messy
16:59 - so here i would use a custom name and i
17:02 - would just put
17:03 - revcat demo that way in the future if
17:05 - you change the app name
17:07 - in your app store listing it's not going
17:08 - to affect what the
17:12 - what they see here when they manage
17:13 - their subscription
17:15 - all right so let's go ahead and save
17:17 - that
17:22 - you can see here right away those change
17:24 - they were
17:25 - saying missing metadata and now they say
17:27 - ready to submit we're not going to
17:29 - actually submit it we're just
17:30 - we just need to get it ready to this
17:32 - state
17:34 - for us to be able to work with it even
17:36 - in development and testing
17:38 - all right so now we're done in the app
17:40 - store connect portal we've got our
17:42 - in-app purchases configured
17:43 - the next step is to work in revenuecat
17:45 - where all the magic happens
17:47 - all right we're doing awesome so far
17:49 - we've configured the in-app purchases
17:51 - in our app store connect portal and now
17:53 - we're ready to use revenuecat
17:55 - if you haven't gotten your free revenue
17:57 - account yet sign up for one at cwc.to
18:00 - revcat2 again i don't get compensated in
18:03 - any way if you use that link but it will
