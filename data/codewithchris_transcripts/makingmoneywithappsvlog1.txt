00:00 - now this video is going to seem a little bit 
strange because I never intended to release  
00:04 - this on YouTube it's a behind thes scenes Diary 
Of Us building an app product with the intention  
00:09 - to make money from it I wanted to document all 
of our mistakes our roadblocks decisions made  
00:15 - Lessons Learned by our team as we went along and 
then at some point in the future I was going to  
00:21 - share this with our Cod withth Chris email 
list but then I thought it'd be such a waste  
00:25 - if I didn't share this with you as we're going 
through the process now so here it is the first  
00:30 - Vlog entry dated September 14th 2023 now one word 
of warning it's unscripted and it's raw and I'm  
00:36 - sorry if it's a little bit rambly and not up to 
our usual production standards but it is a real  
00:42 - unfiltered look into my thoughts and experiences 
as we're going through this journey so I hope  
00:49 - you find some value in watching this hello it's 
Chris here so I thought I would start recording  
00:56 - the journey and the process of building an app 
and launching it so that you can get an overthe  
01:03 - shoulder look at what we're doing and this is as 
much of an exploration for us as it is for you  
01:11 - uh but I hope that in recording this even I can 
look back at it and learn from any mistakes that  
01:17 - we made relive the emotions and decisions that we 
made and so on and so forth so this is the first  
01:23 - sort of like journal entry in this process and 
we've come up with nap idea or and yeah it's a  
01:31 - couple of app ideas and I want to just go through 
what my thinking was so that perhaps it might help  
01:38 - you in coming up with your own app ideas first 
of all I set a couple of criteria um to guide  
01:44 - my decision process I a couple of things I don't 
want to do is to come up with something completely  
01:52 - brand new that's not in the app store because that 
to me is the highest risk way of doing it because  
01:59 - it's never been done it could either be a grand 
slam success or it could fail miserably um also I  
02:07 - want to focus on a small idea because as a single 
developer or couple of developers small team it's  
02:16 - really hard to build a big complex app and make 
sure that it's bug-free good user experience and  
02:24 - all of that stuff and that really plays into the 
success of your app I think because the apps that  
02:32 - tend to get good reviews tend to get repeating 
users coming back to the app end up rising in the  
02:39 - App Store rankings which adds discoverability more 
people finding your app and then it's snowballs  
02:46 - so I would rather have a smaller app that's very 
polished and very useful even if it's like very  
02:52 - narrowly it only does one thing well I would 
rather have that than to have some brand new  
02:58 - idea or a big app that is harder to polish and 
there's more testing involved okay so here's my  
03:04 - criteria for coming up with an app idea again I'm 
not saying this is the only way to do it this is  
03:10 - how I went about it so it has to be something 
that I'm interested in this is from experience  
03:15 - if I'm not that interested in the topic of the app 
I it's really hard to get me to work on something  
03:21 - that's just H my personal thing it's really hard 
to work on something if I'm not interested in it  
03:28 - and I happen to be very interested in being Health 
productivity and just trying to live your best  
03:36 - life or being the best that you can and exploring 
your human potential so that's the space that I'm  
03:44 - thinking in because I know that if I can create an 
app on a topic that I'm interested in that I can  
03:52 - actually use the app to benefit my own day-to-day 
life that's a huge driver because I know that I  
03:59 - can use use it even and it would be like I would 
be very happy with this app even if no one use it  
04:06 - something I can do a little differently I think 
you need some a little differentiation from apps  
04:13 - that are already out there it doesn't have to be a 
lot it could be design right it could be a little  
04:18 - bit of gamification could be a little bit of um 
Improvement on what's already out there either  
04:24 - Improvement or differentiation otherwise it's 
really hard to sell to Market the app as something  
04:31 - that users would want right if it's the same as 
everything else why should the user download it  
04:38 - something I can launch quickly I already talked 
about this I don't want to build a big complex  
04:43 - apps that it's going to take me six months to 
build only to launch it and find out that I  
04:47 - can't get users or no one wants it I want I would 
rather have a small little utility app that I can  
04:55 - build in a week let's say and then just launch it 
in it's infantile prototype phase and have people  
05:04 - use it and tell me what's wrong with it and like 
tively improve it that's what I would would want  
05:11 - and that's the lowest risk I think because that 
allows you to also change direction very quickly  
05:17 - and keeping in mind the last thing is that don't 
get too invested in this idea that I'm coming up  
05:24 - with because in speaking with other successful 
app Developers it's never your first app or rarely  
05:32 - your first app that's going to uh have any success 
it's going to take a few tries and it's very easy  
05:40 - to get I think too invested in your initial idea 
you think it's going to be the best you're going  
05:46 - to put so much uh energy behind it and then when 
it doesn't turn out like you expected to get so  
05:53 - discouraged and then to give up completely I 
would rather keep this in mind and this sort  
06:00 - of goes hand in hand with number three right 
if it it's a small app I can launch quickly if  
06:04 - it doesn't work out I don't feel like I've lost 
too much time or energy and then I can just try  
06:09 - something else so I think finding success in the 
App Store is about testing out a whole bunch of  
06:17 - different ideas and see what sticks I've seen a 
company do a stretch a stretching app I guess it  
06:24 - has exercises to help you stretch and gives 
you badges has a little bit of gamification  
06:29 - and it was advertised by the App Store so it was 
featured which means that it's probably a pretty  
06:34 - popular app and sure enough when I clicked into 
the app store listing it was pretty popular and  
06:39 - then when I checked their developer profile I 
saw that they had a very similar stretching app  
06:47 - that they launched a year before this popular 
one and when I checked that app store listing  
06:54 - the apps looked almost similar so it that made 
me realize that sometimes it's just also luck  
07:04 - timing right has to do with it and it might not be 
that your idea sucks it might just be the way that  
07:10 - it's packaged doesn't resonate with the market at 
that time or something like that or maybe when you  
07:16 - launched that for some reason the App Store didn't 
like it didn't R rank it highly and you didn't get  
07:22 - users but maybe if you just take the same app and 
repackage it change the design perhaps and change  
07:26 - the name relaunch it you might get some traction 
the second time that's number four keeping in mind  
07:34 - that your first try may not be the one that is 
successful this is what I came up with the goal is  
07:43 - a collection of apps because keeping in mind that 
one app we're not going to it's going to be hard  
07:48 - to find success with one app so I want to already 
have the mindset I'm going to build be building  
07:52 - multiple apps a collection of apps designed to 
work together and that's the part I'm going to  
07:58 - get to this is the cool part I think for improving 
your day-to-day physical and mental health through  
08:04 - gamification reminders encouragement so all of 
these different things but I think the key Point  
08:10 - here is collection of apps that work together and 
the goal of all of these types of apps as you can  
08:17 - see is all having to do with well-being Health 
like physical health mental health productivity  
08:25 - work that sort of stuff and as you can see all of 
these apps have been done there's nothing new here  
08:33 - also take note that each of these ideas in itself 
is pretty simple what could be more simple than a  
08:41 - streak counter and I I've even done tutorial 
videos on YouTube about this where you just  
08:47 - tap a button and it adds one to your streak these 
are very simple ideas they all been done but if I  
08:53 - were to do any of these single ideas I would have 
to add a little bit of differentiation or improve  
08:59 - movement as I mentioned just now so I think 
there's still room I I I don't think there's ever  
09:06 - no room for an app idea I I don't believe that 
because there are 10,000 app um water trackers  
09:12 - on the App Store that there's no room for a better 
water tracker and better doesn't always mean more  
09:18 - features right it could just be a better user 
experience it could be that you Incorporated a  
09:24 - new Apple framework that just came out that other 
developers have haven't reacted to yet things like  
09:30 - that there's always room for improvement these are 
very individual apps that help you with certain  
09:36 - things what is this work together part that 
I mean what I mean by that is insights shared  
09:43 - through data so I plan to have one user account 
across different across all the apps and by doing  
09:50 - that you can share the data between different apps 
that allows us to draw draw insights and reveal to  
10:01 - you how various aspects affect other aspects of 
your life such as does the practice of gratitude  
10:09 - journaling or gratitude tracking improve your 
day-to-day mood which is using this app or does  
10:17 - getting more sleep improve your productivity as 
demonstrated by how many pomodoros you completed  
10:23 - the very next day after getting 8 hours of sleep 
so I think a lot of the apps out there or a siloed  
10:30 - right you sleep tracker because I want to get more 
sleep I want to get better sleep so you download  
10:34 - a sleep tracker and then you might sleep eight 
hours and then get up the next day and oh I feel  
10:40 - good this app is helping me but rarely do apps 
talk to other apps right so if by releasing all  
10:48 - of these and and sharing that data because these 
would be all of our apps so we to have access to  
10:54 - the data for all of these apps by using a single 
user account we can link your sleep data to your  
11:00 - productivity data and um be able to tangibly show 
you that data be like hey did you know that every  
11:07 - time you get seven hours of sleep or eight hours 
of sleep the next day you're just so productive  
11:12 - and just surface the own data that you logged 
yourself but show it to you in a way that's oh  
11:19 - yeah this is proof that is um the case so I 
should get more sleep I'll give you more of  
11:25 - a reason to form better habits and this also I 
think once you experience that you'll want to  
11:32 - download even more of these apps because the more 
you use the more data um you log into these apps  
11:39 - the more insights the AI can reveal about your 
life and how which habits are really helping you  
11:46 - and which habits aren't so much because it could 
be the reverse so let's say when you're logging  
11:52 - four hours of sleep we could reveal the Insight 
hey every time you log 4 hours of sleep the next  
11:57 - day your mood is foul you're in a really bad mood 
right if you're tracking your mood in your sleep  
12:03 - so things like that's the working together part 
and then gamification reminders like all of these  
12:07 - different aspects just help the single app aspect 
so we can add gamification to sleep tracker or to  
12:15 - um a Pomodoro thing so maybe every time you 
finish a Pomodoro if you're not familiar with  
12:20 - sorry I've been using this term but if you're not 
familiar with pomodora it's just a time management  
12:25 - technique to stay focused while working so every 
time stay focused you might get some encouragement  
12:30 - or like a little reward or something like that so 
these are aspects that would help individual apps  
12:37 - that's what I said right there but yeah I think 
the cool thing is like the data in the insights  
12:42 - when you add multiple aspects of your life and you 
try to look at that data as a whole you can begin  
12:49 - to see patterns in your life and how how different 
aspects affect each other and I think knowing that  
12:57 - is very powerful the app surfacing that knowledge 
to you is very powerful because you can actually  
13:02 - um act on it and uh that's lifechanging so each 
app is useful on its own but together they provide  
13:11 - a holistic picture of what's going on in your 
life and gives you tangible data to make decisions  
13:14 - about how you want to live your day-to-day life 
um yeah so we just started um thinking a little  
13:21 - bit this is just like brainstorming all this 
whole document is brainstorming actually um  
13:26 - nothing is really concrete but marketing some 
technical challenges how do we even start to  
13:32 - analyze data and draw these conclusions and draw 
these patterns and things like that yeah insights  
13:39 - engine we started just thinking about it so 
on the team is joash and inaki and JC that's  
13:46 - actually almost all of our code with Chris 
team so we are working on this on the side  
13:52 - in um addition to obviously creating the courses 
and that's actually more on me and supporting the  
13:59 - the courses supporting the students however half 
of my goal is to create these useful products and  
14:08 - actually try to make money from it because I 
think that's this is what makes it interesting  
14:15 - and what people deem usually as successful app is 
how much revenue does it generate how many users  
14:21 - does it have want to go through this exercise 
where we're treating this seriously learning  
14:25 - about how to do App Store optimization and how 
to improve products and how to get user feedback  
14:31 - and things like that I think that's a really 
cool thing for us to learn because that's not  
14:37 - something we're super duper familiar with and the 
other half of my goal is to allow you guys to see  
14:48 - how this process plays out because there's a lot 
of I don't think there's a lot of information out  
14:56 - there where it is so transparent honest and real 
a lot of guides and articles say hey here are the  
15:04 - 10 steps to build an app and I'll be honest 
we have a ton of those articles and videos as  
15:09 - well but my goal with this is like I'm going to be 
recording these journals and sharing my thoughts  
15:16 - and decisions with you as this progresses so you 
can really get a behind the scenes raw honest look  
15:22 - at what it takes so I'm sure we're going to fail 
at a ton of things I'm sure we're going to make  
15:26 - a lot of bad decisions but hey I think that's 
part of the process and we can learn about it  
15:30 - together so anyways I I don't want to draw 
this out too long uh I will record Another  
15:35 - journal entry when I have something else to share 
I hope this gives you a lot of ideas and um into  
15:42 - the process of how you should approach building 
your own app and coming with your own app idea
