00:10 - hey guys welcome to another episode of
00:12 - Code with Chris in the last xcode
00:14 - episode we talked about uh adding files
00:17 - to your excode project in this one we're
00:19 - going to talk about groups versus folder
00:22 - references so let's get
00:24 - started so we're going to be talking
00:27 - about groups versus folder references in
00:30 - this video and we're going to be using
00:33 - the same excode project as we did in the
00:35 - last video for adding files to your
00:37 - excode project so you can either
00:39 - download this project in the link below
00:41 - or Click The annotation on the screen to
00:43 - download the excode project so if you
00:46 - can remember basically what I did in the
00:48 - last episode was organize my files in
00:51 - the file system the way I wanted them
00:54 - and then I dragged it into the xcode
00:57 - project Navigator and added them as
01:00 - uh groups so if you can remember what I
01:03 - told you these are individual file
01:06 - references each file in this project
01:09 - Navigator is pointing is referencing the
01:12 - file on the local file system regardless
01:15 - of where I move this guy in the project
01:18 - Navigator so for example with this view
01:21 - controller group and these files if I
01:24 - were to go on the file system and I were
01:27 - to let's say rename my file or even
01:30 - delete my
01:31 - file if I go back to xcode it would show
01:34 - that as a broken reference because I
01:36 - can't find that
01:38 - file now let me show you what happens
01:41 - with uh a folder reference so let me
01:44 - drag view controllers in again but this
01:47 - time I'm going to include it as a a
01:49 - folder reference so it shows up in
01:52 - blue now if
01:56 - I rename
01:58 - it back it fixes this but also notice
02:03 - that for the folder reference it kind of
02:06 - reflects what's in the file system so
02:08 - let me let me show you that again so if
02:10 - I go to viewcontroller.h and I add you
02:12 - know some numbers below
02:16 - it in xcode Project Navigator this file
02:19 - reference would be
02:21 - broken but however if I added the whole
02:23 - folder as a folder reference it just
02:26 - takes whatever is in that folder
02:28 - includes it in your project
02:31 - let me rename that
02:33 - back now just from the very fact that a
02:36 - folder reference includes all of these
02:39 - files in that folder into your xcode
02:42 - project that doesn't give you as fine
02:45 - grain control as a group would because
02:49 - these are individual file references so
02:52 - I can rightclick an individual file and
02:55 - I can choose to delete the reference and
02:59 - I would delete the reference uh in the
03:02 - xcode project but that file would still
03:04 - exist in my file system with folder
03:07 - references you can't do that because uh
03:11 - you either include everything in that
03:12 - folder or you delete it off of the file
03:15 - system in that folder because it it just
03:18 - picks up everything in that folder and
03:21 - that also goes with Target membership so
03:25 - if you're creating an application with a
03:28 - single Target which is most of the time
03:30 - then I guess it's not that big of a
03:32 - drawback for you what I mean is this if
03:35 - I click on a certain file and then I
03:37 - open up the inspector here on the right
03:40 - hand
03:42 - side I can actually choose you know what
03:46 - Target if I had multiple targets what
03:48 - Target that this file would belong to if
03:51 - I had a single Target then it would just
03:53 - be that one and I could do this at a
03:56 - file level at an individual file level
03:59 - in a group in a in a folder reference I
04:02 - can't do that for these files in here I
04:04 - have to control it at the folder level
04:06 - so I would either have to include the
04:08 - whole folder and all of its contents in
04:10 - the Target or don't include that folder
04:13 - at all another thing I forgot to mention
04:16 - is that with a folder reference uh don't
04:19 - think that you can drag files around in
04:22 - here and have it reflect on the file
04:24 - system if that was your goal uh it
04:27 - doesn't so it it's kind of like a read
04:29 - only thing where uh if I try to drag
04:33 - this out it's going to ask me if I want
04:35 - to make a copy of it or make a reference
04:37 - to it and let's say I do that it's just
04:40 - going to create a reference outside of
04:42 - it but it's not going to change what's
04:45 - on my file system in this
04:48 - folder so should you use folder
04:50 - references or should you use groups in
04:51 - your xcode
04:53 - project the common practice seems to be
04:56 - using groups and that's what I prefer as
04:59 - well
05:00 - uh I don't like all my files in one big
05:03 - directory I've I've told you guys that
05:05 - in previous videos so what I actually do
05:07 - is I organize my files in the file
05:09 - system and I drag them back into my
05:11 - project Navigator as group references
05:14 - But ultimately I think it comes down to
05:16 - what you're comfortable with and what
05:18 - will make you the most efficient and
05:20 - keeps you
05:21 - organized so there you have it I think
05:24 - over time the more you work with xcode
05:26 - the more you're going to discover what
05:27 - works for you and now for your fact of
05:30 - the day did you know that a recent
05:33 - teenager survey done by market research
05:35 - firm Piper Jeffrey found that onethird
05:38 - of us high school students now own
05:40 - iPhones so that statistic is astonishing
05:43 - to me at least I don't know about you
05:45 - guys and I have a friend who had a baby
05:48 - girl a while back and she grew up
05:51 - playing with iPads and touch screens and
05:54 - stuff like that and he told me one time
05:57 - she walked up to the TV and then tried
05:59 - to SW wipe the TV as if it were you know
06:01 - some giant iPad and you know what the
06:03 - scary thing is that that's probably not
06:05 - too far off in the future so let me know
06:08 - in the comments section below what you
06:10 - guys think about this topic in terms of
06:12 - you know the younger generation growing
06:14 - up with all of this technology around
06:16 - them all right see you guys next time
