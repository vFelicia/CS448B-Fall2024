00:00 - hello let's talk about buttons in Swift UI 
so in this video we're going to cover a basic  
00:04 - usage example we're going to talk about the button 
style modifier and how you can use preset button  
00:09 - Styles and then if you want to go custom we're 
going to show a couple of different examples of  
00:14 - custom buttons and lastly we're going to dip 
a little bit into accessibility with buttons  
00:19 - all right so let's dive into xcode and take a 
look at a basic usage example so here I have  
00:24 - an xod project I'm going to get rid of this 
more complicated button we will get there I  
00:29 - promise so in Swift UI you can create a new button 
component simply by typing button with a capital  
00:36 - B and there are a couple of different ones here 
let's use this one title key in action so here  
00:43 - you can put a string with whatever button 
text you want and then for the action this  
00:50 - parameter you put a code block to execute when the 
button is tapped on and a code block is indicated  
00:58 - with two curly brackets like this in between the 
curly brackets you put the code that you want to
01:05 - execute uh we'll call it action and this is 
what it looks like in the preview so let me  
01:13 - zoom out a little bit so you can see the screen 
there's our first little button now I want to  
01:20 - warn you that when you do what we just did 
here you can also doubleclick or hit enter  
01:28 - from here and it's going to turn this into 
a shorthand what's called a trailing closure  
01:36 - so all it did was it took your block of code 
right the two curly brackets and it moved it  
01:42 - behind the rounded bracket and it took out 
this parameter label right so we can do it
01:50 - manually like this so that's just something I want 
to warn you about but they they are exactly the  
02:01 - same thing this is just a shorthand and again 
this is the where you would execute the action  
02:07 - so this is your most basic button let's dive into 
how to style this button so if we wanted to let's  
02:15 - say apply a default style we can apply the button 
style modifier to this button component and there  
02:25 - are a couple of different styles that we can 
use so inside these rounded brackets hit Dot  
02:31 - and then you can select from five let's start 
from bordered and see how that looks so that's  
02:37 - going to apply this nice gray border onto your 
button now it's a border button now you might  
02:43 - say that's kind of a plain looking button I want 
a colored background so in that case you want the  
02:49 - bordered prominent style so let's apply that to 
this button here and you get a nice bold button  
02:57 - now if you want to change the color for that 
button you can simply add an additional modifier  
03:03 - and change the tint color to Green let's say let's 
take a look at a couple of different other button  
03:10 - Styles so this one we are going to take a look 
at borderless if you don't want any border this  
03:20 - is the default button it actually looks like the 
basic button and then lastly actually not lastly  
03:28 - we have a couple of different ones we have plane 
so this button Style Just removes all the Frills  
03:34 - from it there are no indications for when you're 
tapping it see there's animations but this one  
03:40 - doesn't even have anything and there's no color 
to it so this is a very plain button that could  
03:46 - probably hide as a label which would be really 
confusing for users so I wouldn't recommend that  
03:53 - and you also have automatic this is the last 
one and automatic is cool because the way that  
04:00 - this looks depends on what platform the user is 
running your app on so if it is on iOS if you  
04:09 - have your button set to automatic it's going 
to take the borderless style because that is  
04:14 - what a default button in iOS looks like however 
if your user is using your app on let's say Mac  
04:19 - OS then the default buttons on Mac look like a 
bordered button so that's what automatic does  
04:27 - now let's take a look at a couple of different 
custom buttons so I'm going to do that up here  
04:34 - remember before when I first showed you we chose 
this one button with a title key and an action  
04:41 - well this allows you to put a string to represent 
the button now we want to choose action and label  
04:47 - and inside label we can actually put any other 
view that we want and action is the same thing  
04:55 - this is a block of code that you want to run when 
the button is tapped on so inside here let's fill  
05:03 - this in first this would still be to execute 
the action whereas the label now you can put  
05:12 - whatever you want So Right Now by default it 
is using a text label called button but what  
05:20 - I've done is I've added an image to this x 
code project called donut so we're going to  
05:26 - try to add that in there so we're going to use 
an image view instead and we are going to put  
05:33 - donut that's really really big so we're going 
to say that it is resizable and then we are  
05:41 - going to uh constrain its height to let's say 
40 and we probably want to maintain the aspect
05:50 - ratio all right so there's our little donut 
button okay now let's take a a look at an icon  
06:00 - with text button so we type in button again and 
this one is kind of the same thing as this one  
06:08 - except that when I hit enter here it is going to 
create a shorthand again so this is actually the
06:16 - action and this is going to be whatever label 
I want take a look at this this block right  
06:29 - here here is this one right and then this 
label part back here is this block of code  
06:37 - but gone are the rounded brackets so this is 
just another shorthand way to write this let  
06:46 - us take a look at an image with icon so in this 
case icon I'm going to use some SF symbols so  
06:56 - you can download this SF symbols app through 
if you just Google SF symbols you'll find it  
07:01 - and these are all um symbols that you can use 
that's already on the system and you don't need  
07:09 - to add any additional assets to your project 
so let's take this one for example and we're  
07:15 - going to copy the name and to use this icon 
you use an image view with the system name  
07:22 - initializer and then you put in the name 
as a string so there we have our icon uh  
07:30 - I'm going to also add a text label and call 
say uh upload so this is now our button now  
07:41 - if you wanted an icon only button that 
would be the same as this one except
07:48 - that it would look like that with just icon 
Now using what you learned in the uh button  
07:58 - Style what we talked about you could make this 
a bordered prominent icon button take a look  
08:06 - at that you could do the same thing with this 
one so you can combine button styles with um  
08:15 - with custom buttons now I want to talk about 
a couple other modifiers that you can use to  
08:20 - customize the look and feel of your button for 
example fonts so if we wanted to change let's  
08:28 - use one of these buttons down here let's use 
this bordered button so we can use the font  
08:34 - modifier and you can specify a for example 
a system font that's a different size well  
08:43 - 10 would be smaller uh let's say 30 and that 
would be larger or perhaps you could specify a  
08:54 - um one of the different font styles the default 
font Styles or presets so you do large title or  
09:05 - perhaps you could do uh there's headline it's 
different styles presetting iOS so that's how  
09:13 - you would change the font you could even use 
custom fonts here now we're not going to cover  
09:17 - that in this tutorial but I do have an article 
on the website covering how to use custom fonts  
09:22 - and I'll link that in the description below if 
you're interested but you would use this font  
09:26 - modifier as well you could also use foreground 
style and that can change the uh the text
09:33 - color maybe that is not visible enough but 
there that's red text and don't forget the  
09:43 - Bold modifier which just makes your text 
Bol so there are a ton of other modifiers  
09:52 - that we haven't covered but those are some of 
the basic ones that you can customize the look  
09:55 - and feel of your buttons now let's transition 
to talking about accessibility which is really  
10:01 - really important for your app if you want to 
make sure that anybody can read what's on your  
10:07 - screen you can add some labels to your buttons 
um for the accessibility options like screen  
10:14 - readers and things like that so for example for 
this green button all you have to do is use the  
10:23 - accessibility uh modifier so that as you can see 
there are a lot of different options here and I  
10:29 - would recommend exploring some of these but two 
that I want to point out that you might want to  
10:34 - consider adding is this one here label it adds 
a label to the view that describes its contents  
10:40 - so you can apply this to most any components I 
believe in on the UI so you can describe what  
10:46 - it is to let's say a screen reader and this one 
gives a hint on what happens after you tap on  
10:53 - the button so that's very useful as well two last 
things here here's a video series going through  
11:00 - all of the other Swift UI components and here you 
can find a single xcode project with example code  
11:05 - for all of the Swift UI components thanks for 
watching and I'll see you in the next video
