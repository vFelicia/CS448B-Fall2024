00:00 - are you thinking about becoming a mobile app 
developer well in this video we're going to  
00:03 - talk about the different ways that you can earn an 
income as an app developer the skills you'll need  
00:08 - to build as well as different options that you 
can take to become an app developer as well as the  
00:13 - pros and cons of each option and lastly we'll end 
off this video with actionable steps that you can  
00:18 - take today to start down your journey of becoming 
a mobile app developer in 2022 let's dive in
00:33 - first of all let's start with what mobile app 
developers do they create mobile applications  
00:38 - for most often android and iOS now oftentimes 
they focus on a single platform and you become  
00:44 - an expert iOS developer or android developer 
but there are also mobile developers that  
00:50 - specialize in cross-platform technologies like 
react native or Xamarin for example being able  
00:55 - to do more than one technology is a great way to 
gain a competitive advantage in the job industry  
01:01 - but if you're just starting out i would recommend 
choosing a single platform to focus on first  
01:06 - now as a mobile app developer they could 
be working for a large corporation a small  
01:10 - business for themselves as a freelancer or even as 
an indie app developer trying to publish apps into  
01:16 - the app store or the play store and trying to earn 
a full-time living that way either way if you love  
01:22 - building apps then this is definitely a career 
to consider there are broadly three different  
01:27 - paths you can take as a mobile app developer let's 
take a look at each one and dive a little deeper  
01:32 - now the first and most obvious path is to 
get a job with a company now as a mobile  
01:38 - app developer in a company your job will be to 
either maintain their existing suite of apps or  
01:44 - to build new apps but either way you're helping 
this company move forward in the app industry  
01:50 - your tasks can range from building apps from 
scratch building new features for existing apps  
01:56 - fixing bugs testing or if the business is really 
small you might be doing all of these tasks  
02:03 - another path that you can take as a mobile app 
developer is as a freelancer now as an independent  
02:08 - freelancer you are meeting with clients you are 
understanding their needs and their requirements  
02:13 - you're coming up with a plan and you are 
delivering that app from start to finish  
02:19 - once you become a profession freelancer you may 
be able to handle more than one client at once  
02:24 - the apps that you build will vary from client to 
client depending on what they need as well as the  
02:29 - income and the scope of the apps the nice thing 
about freelancing is that once you build enough of  
02:35 - a name for yourself and enough of a clientele you 
may be able to hire your own developers and start  
02:41 - building a consulting company that way the third 
broad path is working as an indie app developer  
02:47 - this is where you're coming up with your own app 
ideas you are building them you are then marketing  
02:53 - them creating the business model for them and 
publishing these apps in the app store hoping to  
02:59 - get users and to make a living on your own through 
the app store now this is attractive for a lot of  
03:06 - people because you don't have to answer to any 
clients you don't have to answer to any bosses  
03:11 - and you get to implement your own cool ideas but 
on the flip side this is also the riskiest option  
03:18 - because all the revenue hinges on your ability to 
come up with a solution that meets a need in the  
03:25 - market as well as to market it so that people know 
about it and then for people to use it and want to  
03:32 - continue using it and give you their money now 
the great thing about all of these three options  
03:37 - is that you don't have to only select one there 
are people who are working full-time for a company  
03:42 - freelancing on the side as well as building their 
own app ideas for the app store on the side you  
03:48 - can be doing all three options at once however 
do keep in mind that some contracts that you have  
03:54 - with your full-time employer may not allow you 
to do freelancing on the side so obviously you're  
03:59 - going to have to make sure you're free and clear 
to do that but usually i don't see large companies  
04:05 - putting clauses to prevent you from building apps 
on your own for fun and profit now that you know  
04:10 - the three broad paths of a mobile app developer 
let's talk about the different options you have  
04:16 - to educate yourself and to learn the skills that 
you need to become one so first off in this day  
04:21 - and age there are so many options available for 
you to pursue this it's not like in the past  
04:27 - where you had to just go to school for computer 
science or computer engineering and learn this  
04:33 - and then graduate and find a job that is one path 
that is the traditional path and we're going to  
04:39 - talk about that but another path these days is 
that you can enroll in an online program such as  
04:45 - our cwc plus where you can learn how to build ios 
apps or you might be following youtube videos and  
04:52 - reading books and sort of learning on your own 
so let's dive a little deeper into each of these  
04:56 - options and talk about pros and cons the first 
option is to teach yourself or be self-taught the  
05:02 - nice thing about this industry is that it doesn't 
discriminate you don't need a degree in computer  
05:07 - science to get a job it all hinges on what you've 
done and what you can do so self teaching is  
05:13 - totally viable now the good thing about this 
option is that you can learn at your own pace  
05:17 - if you have a busy schedule if you have you know 
demanding kids or whatever the case may be you can  
05:24 - learn in your free time also there are a variety 
of mediums that suit different learning styles for  
05:30 - this self-teaching path you can do videos you 
can do books you can do online classes courses  
05:39 - and things like that there's so many different 
options you find the format that you learn best in  
05:44 - now the pros with this method i think we already 
mentioned a ton of them is that you can sort of  
05:48 - learn at your own pace and there's a variety of 
formats available for your learning another pro  
05:54 - is that typically these options are all they don't 
cost as much as the other options that we're going  
06:00 - to talk about so this can be quite affordable 
now the downside with self-teaching is that you  
06:06 - may not have a guide or professional someone to 
instantly tell you when you're going wrong or  
06:13 - to help you you know break down some of those 
roadblocks that you're facing and so you may  
06:18 - end up wasting time going down the wrong path or 
getting stuck on something for a very long time  
06:23 - and also don't forget that if you are not the 
disciplined type of person this self-teaching  
06:29 - method may not be good for you because it relies 
on your own motivation and discipline to make  
06:35 - progress the next option is to attend school or a 
university program for something like this these  
06:42 - days universities offer mobile app development as 
a course that you can take the nice thing about  
06:48 - attending school for this is that you're going 
to have the assessments you're going to have the  
06:52 - deadlines and there is a structure it's delivered 
by a professional hopefully someone who knows what  
06:59 - they're talking about and all of the materials 
and the lessons they're laid out in a clear path  
07:05 - that gets you a result at the end so i think 
that's the nice thing about courses and structured  
07:11 - learning now some of the pros of this is that you 
will have certification like you you're gonna have  
07:17 - a diploma or a certificate or a degree something 
that tells you yes you've completed these skills  
07:22 - you've been assessed and you have these skills 
now earlier i said that it doesn't really matter  
07:28 - if you self-teach yourself when you're applying 
for jobs versus someone who graduated but however  
07:33 - having that degree and coming from that program 
automatically does give a degree of confidence i  
07:40 - think still i stand by what i said ultimately 
it's going to depend on what you've done and  
07:45 - what you can do so i still think that demonstrated 
expertise is more important or has more weighting  
07:51 - than where you graduated from or if you were 
self-taught but if you do have that degree and  
07:57 - that you know that program written on your resume 
it does automatically let the reviewer know or the  
08:02 - recruiter know that you have those skills or you 
should have those skills i should say now the cons  
08:09 - enrolling in a university program or college 
program is costly like that's the flip side of  
08:15 - this it's going to cost a lot of money and 
many students go in debt just to go through  
08:19 - these programs now whether or not that is feasible 
for you that's up for you to decide you know also  
08:25 - there may be other expenses if your university is 
far away in their travel expenses or you have to  
08:32 - live abroad for example and if you already have 
a full-time job or you are a parent it could be  
08:39 - hard to make time for that sort of study the 
third option is joining a coding bootcamp now  
08:45 - these bootcamps are short and sweet it's kind of 
like the summer camps that we all attended as kids  
08:49 - and we enjoyed hopefully it's fun to be around 
people who are on the same journey as you and  
08:55 - you can learn off each other and figure things out 
together now the pros to a coding bootcamp is that  
09:00 - it's sort of in between the full-time university 
study versus the at your own pace self-teaching  
09:07 - sort of in between that there still is a schedule 
it could be like really intense for a short period  
09:12 - of time or it could be a couple of dedicated 
night classes per week that sort of thing  
09:18 - but so a pro for a coding bootcamp could be if it 
fits your schedule and your budget this could be a  
09:24 - nice option to get started it's got a little bit 
of that structure it's got a little bit of that  
09:30 - freedom of schedule but it's also got that 
guidance that is completely missing from the self  
09:36 - teaching option now in terms of cons for coding 
boot camp again really depends on your schedule  
09:42 - even a few days a week could be too much 
commitment for you and some boot camps could still  
09:48 - end up costing a lot of money so make sure that 
you talk to people who have taken that boot camp  
09:54 - before or or read reviews about the boot camp that 
you are thinking about joining don't just join up  
09:59 - for any random one because i think quality varies 
between different boot camps and you definitely  
10:04 - don't want to pay all of that money and spend 
all that time and still come away with nothing  
10:09 - all right now that you know the different learning 
options to develop the skills that you need  
10:13 - what are the skills that you need so broadly 
speaking we talked about ios app development  
10:19 - and android app development i recommend you 
to choose either or when you're starting and  
10:24 - not try to do both because that could be very 
overwhelming now here at code with chris we  
10:29 - focus on ios app development whether you are a 
beginner or you're an intermediate learning to  
10:35 - gain even more skills we've helped thousands of 
people build their own apps or get jobs in the  
10:40 - industry and things like that so i'm going to 
speak a little bit about the skills you need if  
10:44 - you wanted to go down the ios app development path 
if you want to go down the android app development  
10:49 - path just search for it on google or youtube now 
i'm sure you can find different videos to help you  
10:56 - now as for ios app development the programming 
language that you're going to want to learn  
11:00 - is swift now this is a relatively new language 
compared to other programming languages but that's  
11:06 - actually a good thing because it's modern and it's 
easy to read and it's not archaic it will be a fun  
11:11 - experience to learn swift so swift is the coding 
side where you express the logic for your app for  
11:19 - the ui side which stands for user interfaces the 
visual elements that the user sees when they're  
11:25 - using your app there are two different frameworks 
that you can use one is called ui kit which is  
11:32 - mostly the prevalent one right now however apple 
has released swift ui in the last few years and  
11:39 - this is sort of their modern take or 
upgrade if you will to ui kit and so  
11:46 - while not as widely adopted right now as ui kit it 
will be in the future because that's the direction  
11:52 - that apple wants to move in so if i were you and i 
was just starting out learning ios app development  
11:57 - swift is a given you're going to have to learn 
that but i would also focus on swift ui and lastly  
12:03 - there is xcode which is the application that 
runs on mac and this is sort of like the studio  
12:09 - development environment where you write your code 
and you configure the ui piece essentially that is  
12:15 - the application where you use to build your apps 
so you're going to have to learn your way around  
12:21 - xcode as well but that sort of comes in time if 
you're just learning swift and swift ui you're  
12:27 - going to be using xcode anyways to do those things 
now let's touch briefly on how much you can earn  
12:33 - as a mobile app developer your salary is going to 
depend which of the three paths that you choose  
12:39 - the ones we mentioned earlier on but again you can 
sort of mix and do a variety of these three paths  
12:45 - if you're working for a company the average salary 
would be about a hundred thousand dollars a year  
12:51 - as a freelancer your rates could be anywhere 
from twenty dollars fifty dollars seventy  
12:56 - dollars an hour it really depends on what you're 
comfortable charging and what you feel like your  
13:00 - skill and your time is worth professional 
consulting companies charge their clients  
13:06 - upwards of 150 an hour for their consultants but 
obviously as an employee to a consulting company  
13:12 - you're not getting that amount you're just getting 
a small portion of that as your own freelancer you  
13:18 - get to keep all of it but then you also have 
to manage the client and you have to find your  
13:22 - own clients and and do all of that stuff now 
when it comes to in the app developers building  
13:27 - their own apps releasing it to the app store and 
trying to make a revenue it's really hard to say  
13:32 - what their incomes can be because it's even 
hard enough to get an app that is successful  
13:39 - in the app store enough to earn any income what 
i would say is search for some app case studies  
13:46 - successful case studies from other indie app 
developers and a lot of them actually share  
13:51 - their numbers and how fast or slow the growth of 
the app was so immerse yourself in that space if  
13:57 - you are thinking about doing it yourself and i'm 
sure you can get an idea of how much you can earn  
14:04 - and as starting out i would definitely recommend 
going down the path where you're looking for a job  
14:10 - you can always start freelancing and building 
your own apps on the side and then once those  
14:14 - things show enough promise you can then quit your 
full-time job and pursue those things instead  
14:19 - all right now we've arrived at how to get started 
with your own mobile app career an actionable  
14:25 - step-by-step plan to start down the journey of 
becoming a mobile app developer okay step one is  
14:30 - to get the basics so we talked about the skills 
you need to learn depending on if you want to do  
14:34 - ios app development or android app development 
we talked about how to get those skills whether  
14:39 - you want to self teach do a boot camp or do a 
university program step one is getting the skills  
14:45 - and this is kind of the hard part because you're 
gonna have to put in the effort you're gonna have  
14:49 - to make the time in your schedule to study and 
to practice but if you stick with it you will  
14:55 - slowly learn the skills this stuff is not rocket 
science it's just how much time have you dedicated  
15:01 - to learning it so it's possible for anyone now 
step two would be building a portfolio because  
15:07 - as i said demonstrated expertise that you can show 
someone is more valuable than just i've taken this  
15:14 - course or i've taken this program you know so i 
would focus on filling up your github account or  
15:21 - actually releasing apps in the app store something 
that you can show an interviewer that you have  
15:26 - done that you have built and if you don't know 
what to build for your portfolio perhaps you  
15:30 - can take some of the projects that you've built 
in your course or your program and put that in  
15:35 - your portfolio right you could ask your friends 
if they have anything that they'd like to build  
15:40 - anything again you can put in your github 
account or publish into the app store to  
15:45 - link to step three is to craft your resume now in 
the beginning if you are new to this industry you  
15:50 - obviously won't have a lot to put on your resume 
but focus on those personal projects focus on that  
15:56 - github account focus on those apps that you've 
published anything that you can demonstrate  
16:01 - that you can you have the skills and you can do 
what you say you can do that is going to be a  
16:06 - plus and finally step number four is to start 
applying for junior jobs now when you do this  
16:12 - just understand that right now as you're 
applying for jobs this is the hardest part  
16:18 - because you have no experience all you 
have on your resume is your portfolio  
16:22 - however all you need is for one person to give you 
a chance that's it so you're going to get 100 no's  
16:29 - but all you need is one yes and as soon as you 
get that one yes you get in there you stay humble  
16:34 - you're there to learn and you do a good job that 
will then set you up for either a continued career  
16:42 - growth at that company or an easier time to jump 
to another company later on when you you have more  
16:48 - experience when you apply for jobs the second time 
it's going to be easier the third time even easier  
16:54 - and so on and so forth as you mature in this app 
industry now step five is just to stop watching  
17:01 - this video and get started if becoming an iOS app 
developer is something that you've always dreamed  
17:05 - about check out our playlist right there to get 
started for free see if this is something for you  
17:10 - thousands of people have taken this free 14-day

as it's something that they can do building that  
17:21 - confidence and unlocking those barriers in your 
head telling you that you can't do it sometimes  
17:26 - that is all that it takes to create a path 
that you never thought was possible so go ahead
