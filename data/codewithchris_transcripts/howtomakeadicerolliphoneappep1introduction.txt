00:06 - hey guys welcome to this new series to
00:08 - build a dice roll application in xcode 5
00:11 - and iOS 7 now some of you guys might
00:14 - still be using xcode 4 and you'll be
00:16 - building for iOS 6 but that's not a
00:18 - problem at all you'll still be able to
00:20 - follow along and at any point and
00:22 - there's very few points uh where it's
00:24 - going to differ I'm going to tell you
00:26 - exactly how it's going to look in xcode
00:27 - 4 and what the difference is so feel
00:29 - free to follow along I have total
00:31 - confidence that even if you're using
00:33 - xcode 4 you'll still be able to build
00:36 - the dice roll application so let me give
00:38 - you a quick demo of what it's going to
00:39 - look like so I'm going to launch it
00:41 - right here and we're just literally
00:44 - going to click a button and it's going
00:46 - to randomize two numbers and the label
00:48 - at the top
00:52 - changes and this demo is really building
00:55 - off of the skills that you learned in
00:57 - lessons 1 to9 in the basics series so if
01:00 - you haven't gone through that uh and
01:01 - you're a total beginner I would
01:03 - recommend that you do those videos first
01:06 - and then do this out if you're a season
01:08 - programmer or you've seen and worked
01:10 - with some iOS then feel free to jump in
01:12 - with the dice roll application all right
01:14 - let's get
01:15 - started okay so what we're looking at
01:17 - here is the new project window of xcode
01:20 - 5 and what we want to select is a single
01:23 - View
01:24 - application now in this screen if you're
01:27 - running xcode 4 you're going to see a
01:28 - couple of more check boxes here and the
01:31 - check boxes that you'll want to have
01:33 - checked on if you're running xcode 4 is
01:36 - use storyboards and use automatic
01:38 - reference counting so make sure those
01:40 - two are checked on other than that the
01:42 - rest are the same so I'm going to call
01:45 - my product a dice roll
01:49 - app and save it
01:53 - somewhere and it's going to create this
01:56 - basic application for us and just to
01:58 - review it's starts off with app delegate
02:01 - and we've got a view controller and
02:03 - we've got a storyboard now if you went
02:05 - through the basics series then you
02:07 - should uh be familiar with the setup
02:09 - already now in xcode 5 we have this
02:11 - image or asset catalog and you won't
02:13 - have this with xcode 4 but what you're
02:16 - going to be doing instead is just adding
02:17 - the images and I'll let you know when we
02:19 - get to it so I just wanted to remind you
02:21 - guys of the app flow the entry point is
02:24 - the app delegate and Then followed by
02:25 - The View controller which manages the
02:28 - view that you specify in the storyboard
02:31 - okay we're going to start by adding some
02:33 - image assets to our project now click on
02:35 - The annotation on the screen or in the
02:38 - link in the description below to go to
02:40 - my website and download a zip file with
02:43 - all of the image assets that we're going
02:44 - to be using now when you get to that
02:46 - page on my site you're going to have to
02:48 - create a free code with Chris account
02:50 - and then you'll be able to download the
02:52 - image assets from that very same page so
02:54 - go ahead and do that now and then once
02:56 - you've got those images come back okay
02:59 - I'm going to assume that you guys have
03:00 - downloaded the zip file of the image
03:02 - assets and have unzipped it into a
03:05 - folder so if you're using xcode 5 um
03:08 - what you can do is open up the asset
03:11 - library and then right click here and
03:13 - choose import and then you can import
03:16 - all of these images into your project
03:17 - like
03:19 - this now if you're using xcode 4 then
03:22 - you you won't have the asset catalog but
03:25 - what you can do is just drag all of the
03:27 - files into your project like this
03:33 - and you can copy the items into your
03:35 - project folder if needed you can choose
03:37 - this option here and click finish and
03:40 - you'll have the images into your project
03:42 - as well so since we're using X Cod 5
03:44 - here I'm just going to delete this that
03:46 - was just for the purposes of showing you
03:48 - guys for the xcode 4 viewers okay so now
03:51 - the second thing we're going to do is go
03:53 - to the storyboard and this is our view
03:55 - so let's run the application right now
03:56 - and I'll show you guys that that's
03:58 - exactly what we have
04:01 - there you go and actually I want to be
04:04 - using the iPhone uh 4 in so you can just
04:07 - change the simulator that you're using
04:09 - from this menu up here I'm going to
04:11 - select the 4 in I'm going to stop it I'm
04:13 - going to rerun
04:15 - it and then okay I'm going to stop that
04:18 - right now and similarly in uh storyboard
04:21 - you there's this button here that you
04:23 - can click to apply 3.5 in form factor or
04:27 - the 4
04:28 - in I hope hope that was pretty easy to
04:30 - follow along and I appreciate you guys
04:33 - watching please share it with any of
04:35 - your friends or colleagues who are
04:36 - interested in iPhone development and
04:38 - help me spread the word and as usual the
04:41 - notes are in the description below as
04:43 - well as the link to the source code and
04:45 - the image assets thanks for watching
04:47 - bye-bye
