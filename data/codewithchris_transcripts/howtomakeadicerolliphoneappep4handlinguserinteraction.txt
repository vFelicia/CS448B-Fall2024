00:06 - all we have to do
00:07 - is hook up this roll button to take some
00:10 - numbers from the dice data controller
00:12 - and then tell these die views basically
00:14 - to show the appropriate images
00:16 - okay so let's open up assistant editor
00:18 - and hook up this button to
00:20 - an action so verify
00:24 - that it's looking at viewcontroller.m
00:27 - the implementation file and we're gonna
00:30 - want to hold down control
00:32 - click and drag the role button and
00:34 - create a new action
00:36 - called uh roll clicked
00:39 - so this method gets called when the role
00:41 - button is clicked
00:42 - now because we'll be using the dice data
00:44 - controller we want to
00:46 - import that file the header file
00:52 - and here let's create a new variable
01:04 - which is a new instance of diced data
01:10 - controller and then we'll
01:13 - create two number variables
01:18 - to hold the two random numbers and we
01:21 - will call
01:22 - the method that we created
01:26 - on the dice data controller
01:35 - okay so we created the new instance of
01:37 - the dice data controller here
01:39 - and then in here we are calling the get
01:41 - die number method
01:43 - twice and assigning the two results to
01:45 - these two variables
01:46 - and finally we have to change the images
01:49 - we have to tell these die views
01:51 - to change the image and if we go to the
01:54 - header file
01:55 - of view controller we called it first
01:58 - dive view and second dive view
01:59 - so we expose these two elements as
02:01 - properties that we can access here
02:04 - so we're going to go self first die view
02:09 - and show dye number that's the method
02:10 - that we just created in dive view and
02:12 - i'm going to pass in first number
02:16 - self dot second eye view
02:20 - show die number second number
02:23 - okay so let's run it and see what
02:25 - happens
02:30 - okay let's click roll that's awesome
02:36 - so we've got the dice showing up um we
02:38 - have to change the label
02:39 - and as well as this background you can
02:41 - see this white because the background of
02:43 - the
02:44 - of the die view itself is white so we
02:46 - can just change it to a transparent
02:48 - color so that we just see the
02:50 - ui image view
02:53 - okay so if you look at the header file
02:57 - you you'll remember that we exposed the
02:59 - label as
03:00 - some label so let's go to
03:04 - this self dot sum label
03:07 - and we'll change the text property and
03:09 - once again we'll use the
03:11 - string with format class method
03:14 - so in a string string with format
03:18 - and we'll want to say something like the
03:21 - sum
03:22 - is and we'll have a wild card
03:27 - and what to put in that wild card well
03:29 - first number
03:30 - plus second number and this will be the
03:33 - sum
03:33 - and the next thing we need to do is make
03:36 - these transparent so you can either do
03:38 - it through
03:39 - interface builder let me go back to
03:43 - single view
03:51 - so you can either do it through
03:53 - interface builder by selecting it and
03:55 - selecting the background it's not the
03:57 - color selecting the background
03:59 - to nothing
04:02 - or another way you could do it i'll show
04:05 - you i'll show you
04:06 - i'll show you the other way since this
04:07 - way is pretty straightforward
04:09 - set it back to white you can go into die
04:11 - view and remember that this method gets
04:13 - called
04:14 - first so you can change the background
04:17 - property using code
04:18 - so self dot background color
04:22 - that's a property of a ui view and you
04:24 - can assign it
04:27 - ui color clear color now if you run it
04:30 - again
04:33 - you won't see any background
04:36 - and that works as we expect i hope that
04:39 - was pretty easy to follow along
04:41 - and i appreciate you guys watching
04:43 - please share it with any of your friends
04:45 - or colleagues who are interested in
04:46 - iphone development
04:47 - and help me spread the word and as usual
04:50 - the notes are in the
04:51 - description below as well as the link to
04:53 - the source code and the image assets
04:55 - thanks for watching bye
