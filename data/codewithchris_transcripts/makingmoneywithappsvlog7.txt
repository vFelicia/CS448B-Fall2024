00:00 - hello and welcome back so the app design
00:02 - for our mood Tracker app is finalized
00:04 - and development Sprint number three is
00:06 - underway so I'll show you what the
00:08 - design looks like and I'll talk about
00:10 - the Sprint in this Vlog but just in case
00:12 - you're new here this series is raw and
00:14 - unscripted and I share our team's
00:16 - journey in building apps for profit this
00:19 - Vlog entry is dated February 14th 2024
00:22 - with all that said I hope you enjoy
00:25 - hello welcome so in the last Vlog I
00:27 - showed you this design that I had to
00:30 - come up with and just to jog your memory
00:33 - or in case you're joining new here the
00:35 - original mood Tracker app that we were
00:38 - trying to build looked like this and
00:40 - this was me just asking our lead
00:42 - designer to design something it wasn't
00:46 - exactly what I had in mind but then
00:48 - again I didn't tell my designer what I
00:50 - had in mind so that's the first mistake
00:52 - and because I didn't have a clear
00:54 - picture of what I wanted and so the
00:56 - lesson for you is if you are going to
00:58 - ask a designer to to do something for
01:01 - you you have to be pretty explicit and
01:04 - you have to know what you want I think a
01:07 - client that doesn't know what they want
01:08 - is probably the worst thing for any sort
01:10 - of consultant or designer so I decided
01:13 - to take a crack at it to try to get in
01:16 - my head onto paper I use this photo as a
01:19 - reference for the feeling that I was
01:21 - trying to evoke and I I did something
01:23 - like this I want to like a cozy a cozy
01:26 - warm type of feeling of using this app
01:29 - so I used a lot of Browns like Earth
01:32 - Tones and things like that I also used a
01:34 - lot of non-standard things as I as I
01:38 - later realized when JC did his design
01:40 - based off of this okay so once I came up
01:43 - with this I asked JC okay now looking at
01:46 - this do you understand what I'm trying
01:48 - to go for and so he took this and ran
01:52 - with it and redesigned all the screens
01:54 - based off of this feeling and emotion
01:57 - and this is what he came up with
02:01 - so you can see that it's a mixture
02:04 - between the first version and my version
02:07 - and what I actually really appreciate
02:09 - about this is the fact that it looks
02:12 - more of an app that you would see in the
02:14 - App Store what do I mean by
02:17 - that it's hard to put your finger on it
02:19 - like when I was designing this I thought
02:21 - oh this would be good here this would be
02:23 - good here and overall I was pretty happy
02:26 - with it but when I saw how JC went about
02:31 - the design I was like this looks like a
02:34 - professional app because it's using
02:37 - standard controls for example the tab
02:40 - bar and these icons up here if you look
02:43 - at just this screen like this entry
02:45 - screen like this notice this back to top
02:48 - right here and this plus button versus
02:50 - what I had here so if you look at this
02:53 - design right here you will see a stark
02:56 - difference I think that you'll
02:57 - understand what I'm saying if you look
02:59 - at this screen right here versus this
03:03 - screen right here this screen right here
03:05 - this just looks more of an app that you
03:07 - would see in the App Store that you
03:08 - would launch or use on your phone versus
03:11 - something that like this that sort of
03:13 - doesn't look like an iPhone app right it
03:16 - looks now to me it looks a little bit
03:19 - amateurish so it was hard to put my
03:21 - finger on it when I was designing it so
03:24 - anyways I'm pretty happy with it okay so
03:27 - let me walk you through some of the
03:28 - interactions so when you have a bunch of
03:30 - mood entries you we didn't figure out
03:33 - how to edit or delete entries and this
03:35 - is what we came up with so when you tap
03:37 - on an entry you essentially drill down
03:40 - and you can delete it rather than
03:42 - launching you into the logging flow
03:45 - which asks you these questions one by
03:47 - one so we thought okay for example if
03:50 - let's say you just wanted to edit who
03:51 - you were with you would have to walk
03:54 - through step one step two step three
03:56 - step four to get there just to change
03:58 - that option so we came up with this
04:00 - solution which was to allow the user to
04:02 - swipe any one of these properties you
04:05 - could say and edit it and it would
04:08 - launch you into that specific mood entry
04:11 - screen so to to let you make a different
04:15 - selection and so that's how you would
04:17 - edit an
04:19 - entry the other thing is the calendar
04:24 - so the calendar we I identified
04:26 - something pretty funny here that I
04:29 - didn't understand before so my original
04:32 - idea was to use a circle to indicate
04:35 - days that you have logged something and
04:38 - a DOT to indicate that this is the
04:41 - current date so we looked at another
04:45 - example sorry another design where
04:48 - instead of a big circle you would have a
04:50 - little dot if you logged something on
04:52 - that day so you'd end up with a calendar
04:54 - of a lot of little dots here but it
04:57 - didn't feel right because it didn't and
05:00 - it again this was something that was
05:01 - really hard to put my finger on it
05:04 - didn't give the feeling of satisfaction
05:06 - I'm comparing this to like a fitness
05:07 - workout app when I'm logging a workout
05:10 - on that day it feels like a win to me
05:13 - and a big juicy circle around that day
05:16 - that I can clearly see indicates it
05:19 - gives me this feeling of achievement of
05:21 - satisfaction and then when I see a month
05:23 - full of fat circles it feels like I did
05:25 - a lot that month and so that wasn't
05:28 - something that I had been a I wasn't
05:31 - able to identify when I was designing it
05:34 - but then after looking at the
05:35 - alternative of just like having a little
05:38 - indication that there was something
05:39 - logged on that day I realized something
05:41 - was missing so I told JC like I really
05:44 - need a huge indication that something
05:47 - was done on that day because looking at
05:49 - a calendar full of green circles for
05:51 - example it lets me know that hey I've
05:53 - put in a lot of work and I feel good
05:55 - about that so that was a cool real
05:58 - realization
06:01 - about the this log entry screen let me
06:04 - walk you through this so a couple of the
06:06 - interactions we were unsure about we
06:07 - figured out as well so for example
06:10 - originally I had something where if you
06:13 - tap on an option it moves you to the
06:15 - next screen right away so tapping good
06:18 - just zooms you over here tapping overjoy
06:20 - zooms you and I like that because it was
06:22 - quick and it was fast but it didn't
06:25 - allow for certain types of interactions
06:28 - such as pinning a mood let's say I
06:30 - always want to use this mood I want to
06:32 - pin it to the top yeah what we decided
06:35 - would be better was to let the user Make
06:38 - a selection and then have buttons for
06:41 - them to go to the next screen then the
06:43 - user probably feels a little more in
06:45 - control because you can choose one think
06:48 - about it change your mind choose another
06:50 - change your decision and then hit the
06:52 - green button to move on to the next
06:53 - screen you could always use the back
06:55 - button to go back you can always cancel
06:57 - to say hey I actually don't want to log
06:59 - a mood at all we also simplified it
07:02 - because before logging a custom mood
07:05 - like
07:06 - this my idea was that when you type in a
07:10 - custom mood here and you somehow hit
07:13 - save or whatever it would create a a
07:16 - button here for your custom mood so that
07:18 - you can use this in the future so in
07:21 - this design what we're doing is just
07:23 - allowing you to type whatever you want
07:26 - as your mood as a custom mood and then
07:28 - go on to the next screen but it wouldn't
07:30 - save this necessarily for the next time
07:33 - at least I don't think so in this design
07:35 - it looks like it will save it let me
07:37 - reconfirm
07:39 - that so if you confirm sorry if you
07:42 - cancel we have dialogues because you
07:45 - have made some progress on your entry up
07:47 - till this point so we do want to confirm
07:49 - with the user and also a tap and hold
07:52 - interaction is used for pinning a
07:54 - certain mood to the top or maybe
07:56 - deleting a custom mood I think
08:01 - yeah or maybe removing it from a pinned
08:04 - section we're asking about the weather
08:06 - this is what the button looks like for
08:09 - the location services and they'll allow
08:11 - you to use the location who are you with
08:14 - what were you doing where are you of
08:17 - course you don't have to log all of
08:18 - these
08:19 - things
08:21 - we you can log just as as much or as
08:24 - little as you want and hit save and it
08:26 - will save your mood okay so based on
08:30 - this design which is a lot more
08:32 - finalized than what we had before what
08:34 - we had to do is go back to the drawing
08:36 - board in terms of planning the Sprints
08:39 - and reestimate everything based on the
08:41 - new design luckily we did some work
08:43 - already in the first two sprints that we
08:45 - can reuse so not All Is Lost but based
08:48 - on these story points which is an
08:50 - estimation of effort we are going to
08:52 - plan Sprint three working on this app is
08:55 - not our full-time thing we're also
08:57 - supporting students through our training
08:59 - programs and things like that we are
09:01 - only allocating each person eight story
09:04 - points per 2E Sprint so that's where
09:06 - we're at right now I'm excited to see
09:08 - this come more to fruition and now that
09:12 - we have a solid place to start from it's
09:14 - not a changing design I think we can
09:16 - make some real progress so stay tuned
09:19 - and I will update you guys next time
09:20 - thanks for watching
