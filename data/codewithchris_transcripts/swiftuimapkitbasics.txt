00:00 - map kit for Swift UI man when they announced 
this at ww23 I was pumped and it's not that I  
00:06 - use maps all the time in my apps it's just that 
when I do need it it's quite a chore to add a UI  
00:11 - kit map to my Swift UI project plus the code 
is kind of complex to explain it simply to a  
00:18 - beginner who wants to use maps in their project 
now all of that has been solved let me show you  
00:24 - in this Swift UI map kit Basics tutorial you're 
going to learn how to add a map to your Swift UI  
00:29 - project how to add markers to your map and how 
to customize them how to add annotations to your  
00:34 - map they're kind of like markers but they let 
you add a custom view instead I'll also show  
00:39 - you how to change the region that the map shows 
and finally how to change the style of the map  
00:44 - now for reference I learned all of this stuff 
from this wwc23 video link in the description  
00:51 - so Swift UI maps are only available on xcode 
15 beta and later so depending on when you're  
00:57 - watching this if xcode 15 has officially 
come out or maybe it's xcode 17 now things  
01:02 - may change okay under iOS let's choose app and 
let's call this map kit demo interfaces with UI  
01:10 - languages Swift click on next let's save this on 
the desktop let's make this window a little bigger
01:22 - okay so the first thing we're going 
to do is import map kit at the top
01:29 - next we are going to replace the entire 
v-stack with a swift UI map component and  
01:36 - it's literally as simple as that to add a 
map to your Swift UI project this used to  
01:42 - take ages with the UI kit map okay step two 
we're going to add a marker to this map and  
01:48 - that is very simple as well but first let me 
declare a point of Interest so I am going to  
01:55 - take this lat long of the CN 
Tower and we're going to use that
02:05 - we need a CL location coordinate 2D and 
we're going to pass in the lat and the long
02:20 - all right
02:21 - so that's our Tower and in order to add this to 
the map you open up the content builder for the  
02:32 - map this is where you can add content just open up 
a pair of curly brackets in here you're going to  
02:37 - be able to add content okay so we're going to add 
a marker component and it takes in a title key and  
02:44 - a coordinate so let's call this CN Tower and for 
coordinate we're just going to pass in Tower so  
02:52 - you can see that right away the camera region goes 
automatically to the markers if I had multiple  
03:00 - markers it would frame the map so that all of the 
markers are visible and does that automatically  
03:06 - so here in the map already if I hold down control 
on my keyboard or option rather and you know I can  
03:14 - sort of navigate around you can see all these 
things okay let's add a couple of markers so  
03:21 - we're probably going to zoom ahead for this part 
because it's going to be a little bit tedious
03:30 - okay so now I have a few more points of 
interest let's add these to our map as well  
03:36 - Okay so we've got the art gallery of Ontario 
and we've also got this is the museum  
03:48 - the Royal Ontario Museum ROM now you can see 
it frames the map it zooms out and it frames  
03:57 - it so that all of my markers are visible 
automatically now I want to show you how to  
04:03 - customize these markers so this marker you can 
actually pass in a couple of different things  
04:09 - instead of just this pin so this is the CN tower 
that's this one down here and you can pass in an  
04:15 - image if you have one you just add it into your 
asset library and you can display that instead of  
04:21 - this little pin icon but you can also add an 
SF symbol which is what I'm going to do here  
04:27 - so I can search for unfortunately there's no Tower 
but there is a building so I'm going to use that
04:40 - all right you can see that changed into a building 
there in that corner the other thing you can do is  
04:46 - you can use a monogram which takes up to three 
letters so now I can display a ago instead if  
04:58 - I wanted to so those are a couple of options you 
can also change the color so for the tower let's  
05:06 - say I want this to be blue for the art gallery 
I want that to be red and then for the museum
05:18 - let's give it a system image let's use this 
one that kind of looks like a museum right  
05:24 - put it right there and then tint this one perhaps 
should be Orange all right so that's how easily  
05:35 - you can customize these markers but if you wanted 
to completely change this little bubble and you  
05:41 - wanted to put your own icon there you can as 
well you can use what's called an annotation  
05:47 - instead of a marker and it actually looks really 
really similar so let's say for example for the  
05:52 - art gallery I don't want to display the ago I can 
choose annotation instead and it accepts the title  
06:02 - the coordinate and content in in this content you 
can then put your own view that you want to use so  
06:10 - let's call this Art Gallery coordinate is ago and 
the content is anything we'd like so why don't we  
06:22 - use something like this and then 
we'll also add some padding to that  
06:36 - and we'll add a background color to 
thread so it could be something like that
06:49 - gives any idea you can put in your own shapes 
you can put in whatever you want as a view  
06:55 - so what if we wanted to control what area the map 
shows by default the camera position is automatic  
07:02 - so it frames all of your markers and annotations 
in view however there is a way for you to control  
07:08 - that camera position to let's say single out 
a particular location so the way you control  
07:16 - that is by specifying this position parameter 
and it is a binding to a map camera position  
07:25 - right so let me show you how 
that works we're going to
07:32 - add a state property let's call this camera and 
it's going to be map camera position and we're  
07:38 - going to set it to a default value of automatic 
which is actually what is happening behind the  
07:44 - scenes right now create a position that frames 
the maps content right and what we can do later  
07:49 - is for example when the user Taps on a button we 
can set this camera position to something that  
07:55 - we want and that will then change where the map 
is framing so let's pass this property into our  
08:03 - map component through this position parameter and 
it's got to be a binding oops there we go camera  
08:12 - and then let's add some buttons so this is 
something really cool that I learned from that  
08:16 - WDC video and it is called a safe area inset so 
you can overlay some controls on top of the map  
08:24 - and it's ensured that nothing will cover it so it 
shows content above or below the modified View so  
08:31 - we're going to put it along the bottom Edge and in 
content I can choose what to show so I'm going to  
08:38 - put an H stack here and I'm going to put a button 
that says let's see here how about we Center on um
08:58 - okay so you see the button down there but 
it's kind of hard to read so then you can  
09:04 - put a background on this and you can use a thin 
material to have a slightly opaque background  
09:12 - but notice that it only takes up the width of 
the button so what you can do is add a spacer  
09:19 - to the left and right of the button and you 
can also add some padding at the top so it's  
09:25 - not so close to the text so that creates a little 
more space right there and then when this button  
09:33 - is tapped on what we want to do is just set the 
camera position so we can set the camera equals  
09:40 - there are a couple things you can set this to one 
of them for example you can Center it around an MK  
09:46 - map item if you have a reference to a particular 
marker or map item sorry you can Center it around  
09:54 - erect or a region or user's location even so if 
you want the the map to track a user's location  
10:01 - as the user is like let's say driving or biking 
or something like that you can use that and then  
10:07 - region is what we're going to use here and then 
we're going to specify an MK coordinate region
10:15 - and we are going to center it around the tower 
and specify a number of meters as the area to show  
10:25 - so let me space this out a little bit so 
it's a little easier to see and read these
10:34 - all right so right here it's still automatic 
camera positioning but when I tap on the tower  
10:39 - it's then going to change the the camera to 
show the CN Tower with the specified number  
10:47 - meters here so I can very easily add another 
button here let's just copy and paste this  
10:53 - and this is going to be 
let's do the ROM for this one
11:03 - all right so CN Tower ROM  
11:07 - it's kind of a cool looking building actually 
and the last thing I want to show you guys  
11:11 - is how easily you can change the style of the 
map so let us collapse that and collapse left
11:22 - and then we are simply going to add a matte 
style modifier and you can choose standard  
11:30 - is what we're looking at right now and then you 
have imagery using satellite imagery or hybrid  
11:36 - where you can read that has the road names and 
information layers on top so let's take a look  
11:41 - at imagery because that looks really really 
different so we can zoom in and we can take  
11:47 - a look at this imagery here or let's let's go to 
the ROM yeah that's how that building looks like  
11:53 - so if you have time definitely check out that dub 
dub 23 video that I linked to in the description  
11:57 - that's where I learned all of this and that video 
actually covers a lot more such as about how to  
12:02 - add routes user locations and highlight different 
things on the map It's really informative video  
12:08 - so have you ever tried to add a UI kit 
map to your Swift UI project using UI  
12:12 - view representable if you have you'll know 
what I mean when I say it's quite complex  
12:16 - to do and it took me a while to grasp what was 
going on and now we have this beautiful Swift  
12:21 - UI syntax to work with maps it is awesome 
so what is your favorite part about Swift  
12:26 - UI map kit let me know by leaving a comment 
below and if you are new to app development  
12:31 - check out our three hour beginner master 
class on Swift UI where you will build  
12:35 - your first app no experience required thanks
