00:02 - hey code crews so I got a quick question
00:05 - for you
00:06 - the other day I had an interview
00:07 - question and no this is not for a job
00:09 - interview a student actually wanted to
00:11 - interview me for their school project so
00:12 - that was cool but the actual question is
00:15 - how long have you been a programmer for
00:17 - and it seems like a straightforward
00:19 - question but I really really had to
00:21 - think about this because what does it
00:23 - mean to be a programmer and when can you
00:25 - start identifying yourself as a
00:26 - programmer and I really really wanted to
00:29 - get your opinion on this because to me
00:32 - is a programmer when you first get your
00:35 - developer job or programmer job in is
00:37 - that when you can call yourself a
00:39 - programmer or is it when you've picked
00:41 - up your first programming book and or
00:44 - tutorial and you've decided to take it
00:47 - up as a hobby is that one you can
00:49 - identify yourself as a programmer so I
00:51 - took it to mean the ladder now I'm
00:54 - really interested in your opinion that's
00:56 - why I created this video I want you to
00:58 - tell me when can you start identifying
01:00 - and calling yourself a programmer and by
01:03 - that definition are you a programmer and
01:05 - how long have you been a programmer for
01:07 - let me know by leaving a quick comment
01:09 - below I'm really really curious to see
01:12 - what you guys think all right I'll catch
01:14 - you guys next time
01:15 - bye for now
