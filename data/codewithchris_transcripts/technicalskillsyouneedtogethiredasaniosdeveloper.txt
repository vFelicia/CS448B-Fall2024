00:00 - so you want to be an ios developer well what 
technical skills are recruiters looking for  
00:05 - these days and what can you learn to maximize your 
chances to get your foot in the door and also what  
00:11 - do you not need to know so i'm going to assume 
that you're not currently an ios developer and  
00:16 - if that is true i want you to keep one thing in 
mind as you're applying for jobs you only need one  
00:21 - employer to give you a chance because once you're 
in you can learn on the job you can learn from  
00:26 - more experienced ios developers and you can build 
up your resume to maximize your chances of someone  
00:32 - taking that first chance on you make sure you know 
these eight things that i'm about to share with  
00:37 - you in this video they're the same things that 
i look for when i interview ios developers and  
00:42 - surprisingly only three of them are ios specific 
alright let's dive in all right before we start  
00:48 - just want to say these are not in any sort of 
priority order the first one is source control  
00:53 - because when you're applying for a job most likely 
you'll be working as part of a team and source  
00:57 - control is the best way to work harmoniously 
with your team now you might argue that if  
01:02 - you find a job and you're the first and only 
ios developer that you don't need to know this  
01:07 - i would say that that is not recommended as your 
first ios job because you want to work with people  
01:13 - who are more senior than you so you can learn 
and plus being the only ios developer on the team  
01:19 - there's a lot of pressure on you and that may 
not be ideal for a beginner so as to what source  
01:25 - control you should learn and use it changes from 
a work environment to work environment but i think  
01:31 - as long as you know sort of the basic concepts 
and you know how to merge and resolve conflicts  
01:37 - you'll be in a good place next up we have ios 
concurrency now you don't need to be the master of  
01:42 - multi-threaded programming but you need to know 
the basic concepts because otherwise you're going  
01:48 - to reach a point where you're going to be looking 
at code you're going to be trying to figure  
01:52 - out what is happening and you're not going to 
understand why the app is behaving a certain way  
01:58 - so know the difference between the main thread 
and background threads and how they work  
02:02 - together to perform tasks like networking data 
fetching updating the ui and things like that  
02:08 - number three is the swift programming language 
it goes without saying that if you're going to  
02:12 - be building ios apps knowing swift is a must but 
how much swift do you need to know so definitely  
02:19 - you need a baseline working knowledge you need 
to be able to build apps and write swift code  
02:26 - but do you need to know things that are a 
little more complicated like for example  
02:32 - generics do you need to know how automatic 
reference counting is working behind the  
02:37 - scenes and things like that i would say that it's 
important that you can read code because even if  
02:45 - you are not using let's say generics in your daily 
routine programming with swift but you're going  
02:53 - to be spending a lot of time reading your team 
members code whether that's for code review or  
02:58 - maybe you're part of a larger project and you need 
to understand how a feature works you're going to  
03:04 - be reading a lot of code so i think it's important 
that you at least understand how these things work  
03:10 - and you can recognize it when you're reading the 
code so that you can follow the logic and and  
03:15 - know what's happening even if you are not using 
it as a habit in your programming number four  
03:21 - design patterns and algorithms so why reinvent 
the wheel design patterns are solutions to  
03:26 - common architecture problems that come up during 
programming so i would say it's most important  
03:33 - to know the common ones such as singleton factory 
and you can probably google this and and find out  
03:40 - another thing are algorithms so these 
are sort of known efficient ways to  
03:45 - solve things that come up in programming know 
your sorting algorithms chances are these will  
03:50 - be tested in an interview and then lastly no big o 
notation even if you're not super familiar with it  
03:57 - at least know what it is and know how to evaluate 
some pieces of code get some practice in and if  
04:03 - you are if this term is unfamiliar to you it's 
basically a way of evaluating how efficient  
04:10 - uh your code is number five is xcode goes 
without saying that you need to know how to  
04:15 - navigate and use xcode for building apps however 
more importantly you should also know how to debug  
04:21 - with xcode so get used to the basic debugging 
tools such as setting breakpoints and stepping  
04:26 - through your code and using the console window 
and things like that you should also know how to  
04:32 - create and run test cases and as a bonus know 
how to measure the performance of your app  
04:37 - using the tools that xcode gives you the next item 
is networking rarely these days are there any apps  
04:43 - that are not connected to some sort of service so 
you should familiarize yourself with the concepts  
04:48 - such as the difference between asynchronous and 
synchronous https and http and you should also  
04:55 - know how to work with apis and with apis probably 
comes json is the responses are usually returned  
05:03 - in json so you should know how to decode and 
encode json with swift as well now every api  
05:09 - will be a little bit different but you do want to 
demonstrate that you have worked with some apis  
05:14 - and so it's not going to be completely brand new 
to you number seven is swift ui or ui kit now the  
05:21 - ui framework that you should learn largely depends 
on the type of job that you want ui kit has  
05:26 - definitely been around a lot longer so there are a 
lot more opportunities for developers who know ui  
05:34 - kit and it might actually make you more marketable 
when you're looking for a job however on the flip  
05:39 - side swift ui is newer and it's sort of the the 
future as apple sees it and more and more people  
05:46 - are going to adopt swift ui but as for now there 
may be limited job opportunities to work with  
05:51 - SwiftUI so that's going to limit the pool of jobs 
available to you but you could also argue that the  
05:57 - employers that are looking for swift ui experience 
they're going to be more innovative because  
06:02 - they're adopting new technologies it also could 
be an indication that you are going to be working  
06:08 - on a brand new swift ui project or you're going 
to be adapting a ui kit project towards swift ui  
06:14 - whereas for ui kit you could be maintaining an 
existing ui kit app and the last thing to know  
06:22 - is a database technology now personally my opinion 
is that i don't think it matters what you know as  
06:28 - long as you show that you've worked with databases 
before because you're not going to know exactly  
06:34 - you know what database your future workplace is 
going to be using so by demonstrating on your  
06:41 - resume that you've worked for or worked with let's 
say cloud firestore before then the interviewer  
06:47 - knows that you understand database concepts that 
you've worked with a database before and it's  
06:54 - not completely brand new to you now it's 
important to keep in mind that nobody knows  
07:01 - all of this stuff from the get-go and if you are 
applying to a beginner role knowing all these  
07:07 - things will definitely give you an advantage 
unfortunately here's the bad news even knowing  
07:12 - all these technical skills that's only half the 
battle there's another half consisting of your  
07:17 - soft skills which are arguably even more important 
than the technical skills we'll cover those next  
07:23 - time for now start learning swift and xcode in 
our 14 day challenge over there and if you're  
07:28 - past that level check out the video description 
where i will link to different sources to learn  
07:33 - the eight things that we covered today thanks 
for watching and i'll see you in the next video
