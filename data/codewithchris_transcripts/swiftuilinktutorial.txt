00:00 - hello it's Chris here and welcome to
00:01 - another Swift UI Basics tutorial in this
00:03 - one I'm going to show you how to use
00:04 - links in Swift UI apps so it's great for
00:08 - opening up a link in Safari from your
00:10 - app or opening up the settings perhaps
00:13 - from your app all right let's dive in
00:14 - and take a look before we begin one
00:16 - quick note we have a free exco project
00:18 - containing sample code for all of the
00:20 - Swift UI components use it for your own
00:23 - projects or just to learn from get it at
00:30 - brand new xcode project here let's get
00:31 - rid of the image and text element and
00:33 - we're going to type in link now there's
00:35 - going to be two different ones we're
00:36 - going to go through both let's do the
00:38 - first one this one allows you to specify
00:41 - a piece of text to represent the link
00:43 - followed by a URL instance for the
00:45 - destination that's where you want to
00:47 - bring the user to this one allows you to
00:50 - specify the destination and then any
00:52 - custom view that you want so let's do
00:54 - this one first and let's uh just use my
00:59 - website as an example and then for the
01:02 - URL here you're going to create a new
01:04 - URL instance and I'm going to use this
01:07 - string one here and you can just type in
01:10 - the web address you want to go to but
01:12 - because this returns an optional URL
01:16 - instance we are going to just force and
01:18 - wrap it here now if it cannot create
01:20 - that URL it will crash now let's uh
01:24 - actually I don't know if you can do it
01:25 - in the
01:26 - preview I don't think so but here I've
01:29 - launched in the simulator if you tap on
01:32 - it it comes here simple really really
01:34 - easy now if you want to let's say open
01:38 - settings we can
01:41 - just I'm just going to copy and paste
01:43 - this because it's essentially the same
01:49 - thing except in here you would type in
01:53 - app-
01:55 - settings
01:56 - colon and then let's take a look at that
02:00 - now I'm not familiar with any other
02:03 - types of um this is not exactly a URL
02:07 - scheme I don't think if you know other
02:10 - ones that you can open please let me
02:12 - know in the comments below but that
02:16 - allows you to open the settings very
02:18 - very handy so let's take a look at the
02:21 - last one this one right here where we
02:23 - can spe uh specify the destination H
02:25 - it's typed it out for us okay so let's
02:27 - use that and then as for the label
02:30 - I am going to use an actual label
02:33 - element if uh you've never used that
02:36 - before it's very
02:39 - handy you can specify an SF symbol for
02:43 - it I happen to know the SF symbol that I
02:46 - want to use right there and
02:50 - let's style this a little bit
02:53 - so I'm going to add a width of let's say
02:57 - 250 height of 40 you can see see it
03:00 - there already uh
03:02 - background black foreground
03:06 - style white and then clip shape and just
03:10 - add rounded rectangle Corner radius of
03:14 - let's say eight so something like that
03:17 - and that is how you would have a styled
03:20 - link you tap on that goes to the Apple
03:22 - website so that's how easy it is to use
03:25 - this link view in your Swift UI app if
03:29 - you want to download the sample code for
03:30 - this we've got it all in a single handy
03:33 - exod project in fact it contains sample
03:36 - code for all of the Swift UI components
03:38 - so that you can learn from it or copy
03:40 - and paste the code into your own project
03:42 - just visit
03:45 - cc. dkit it's a free download I'll leave
03:49 - it in the description below the video
03:50 - too
