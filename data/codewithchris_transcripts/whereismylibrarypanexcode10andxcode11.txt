00:00 - hello youtube and welcome back to color
00:01 - with Chris so finally my quest has been
00:04 - updated and Xcode on version 10 now
00:08 - there's a couple of little changes the
00:10 - bigger one is the new theme that is
00:15 - available in that mode and a couple of
00:18 - color changes in font and the text now
00:22 - we have a lot of beginners who are
00:24 - starting to code now following the
00:26 - tutorial we have on the YouTube channel
00:28 - now the tutorials were all recorded with
00:32 - Xcode 9 from a couple of months back and
00:35 - there's not much changes but there's one
00:37 - that is big enough a change to throw off
00:40 - like new beginner say they cannot find a
00:42 - library pane with the uikit elements so
00:45 - as soon as you have in your main
00:47 - storyboard you are looking to add items
00:50 - to your converse now you can see that
00:54 - there's a note selection the library pen
00:57 - has disappeared now Apple decided to
00:59 - move this library pane into this little
01:01 - button right here so if you let's select
01:04 - this one you have the library is going
01:05 - to come back up here and you're going to
01:08 - be able to add your view controller all
01:11 - of your buttons that you need so yeah so
01:13 - it's this little button right here it's
01:16 - not part of the bottom-right corner
01:19 - anymore I see it disappeared again on me
01:22 - I'm not particularly fan of this because
01:24 - I like the old-fashioned way to always
01:26 - have it next to me here if I need
01:29 - something can just drag drag right now
01:30 - if I select it code in the background
01:33 - it's gone again so I need to go back and
01:35 - press that button I feel like it's an
01:37 - additional step which I don't need and
01:40 - also another way to get it is from the
01:43 - view panel library and the show library
01:46 - that's right here so shift command alpha
01:51 - library hopefully in a new update of
01:53 - Xcode they give us a choice to actually
01:56 - bring it back in the corner because here
02:00 - there's no way to stitch it or glue it
02:02 - to it so we have Apple please make us an
02:05 - update and give us a chance to put it
02:08 - back there
