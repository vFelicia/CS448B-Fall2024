00:00 - pay code crew what's up it's Chris here
00:01 - in this video I want to showcase a code
00:04 - library written by one of my community
00:07 - members his name is Stuart and he's
00:09 - actually written quite a number of
00:11 - helpful libraries this one in particular
00:14 - that I want to show you is called CT
00:16 - help and it's a very easy way to drop in
00:20 - a help system or some sort of welcome
00:23 - screen in my opinion it can also be used
00:25 - like that so what it is it's a set of
00:28 - swipeable cards that you can configure
00:30 - so you can do images images with text
00:33 - you can do no images and text only you
00:36 - can have buttons to visit a website or
00:38 - to launch the ticketing system or
00:41 - something like that so it's flexible and
00:43 - it's really easy to drop into any app so
00:47 - I want to show you how that's done let's
00:49 - get to it so this is where you can get
00:56 - CT help it's on github and it's actually
00:59 - available as a cocoa pod here called CT
01:03 - help now if you're not familiar with
01:05 - cocoa pods I have a video just for you
01:07 - so you can go ahead and click in the
01:09 - upper right hand corner and watch that
01:10 - first to install it on your system I'm
01:13 - gonna do it the cocoa pod way so I'm
01:16 - going to create a brand new Xcode
01:18 - project I'm going to choose single view
01:20 - app for the purpose of this
01:21 - demonstration I call this CT help demo
01:24 - and I'm just going to pop this onto my
01:28 - desktop got a ton of stuff on my desktop
01:32 - there okay so now we're going to close
01:35 - it and we're going to open up terminal
01:37 - so that we can navigate to our directory
01:43 - CD desktop and the CT help now if any of
01:49 - what I'm doing right now is a little
01:51 - foreign to you I highly recommend that
01:53 - you go and watch that cocoa pod video
01:56 - that I have first because it shows you
01:57 - how to do all this setup that I'm doing
02:00 - so now that I'm in the project directory
02:03 - I am going to type in pod in it and then
02:08 - I'm going to open up that folder and I'm
02:12 - going to
02:12 - add the pod that we need so that's just
02:17 - this one right here yeah save it let's
02:21 - close it let's go back to terminal and
02:24 - type in pod install all right now let's
02:32 - open up the XC workspace and we are
02:37 - ready to go all right so first things
02:39 - first is we're gonna put a button on the
02:42 - main screen here to launch the help
02:45 - system so I'm just gonna put a button
02:51 - say Center it horizontally I'll just
02:56 - make it 200 from the top and I will call
03:00 - this guy launch help or something like
03:07 - that
03:08 - let's open up assistant editor and I am
03:11 - going to add an IB action help tapped
03:18 - all right so this is going to allow me
03:21 - to detect when the user has tapped on
03:24 - that button so that I can execute some
03:26 - code to launch that menu system let's go
03:30 - back to standard editor and go to the
03:32 - view controller here the next thing I
03:34 - want to do is import CT help that's
03:38 - gonna let me use all of those classes in
03:40 - his library now let's go back to the
03:42 - github page and take a look at how to do
03:45 - this so all we need to do is create a
03:48 - new CT help object here and each of the
03:52 - cards is represented by a CT help item
03:57 - now there are a couple of ways that you
03:58 - can configure each of these cards you
04:01 - can give it a title you can give it some
04:03 - text and then you can give it an image
04:06 - name now this image name references some
04:10 - assets in your asset library on Xcode so
04:14 - we're gonna have to put some assets in
04:15 - there if we want to see some images and
04:19 - then however many cards you need you
04:22 - just create CT help items and
04:25 - into your CT help object here using this
04:29 - new method there are more sort of
04:32 - configuration properties that you can
04:34 - set if you want to configure the way
04:36 - that that card system looks so you can
04:40 - take a look at this in more detail to
04:44 - configure it and lastly present help
04:48 - from the view controller or whoever
04:51 - you're trying to present this from and
04:53 - you're going to be able to show your
04:56 - help system alright so let's do that I'm
05:00 - actually going to I'm going to take
05:03 - Stewart's sample cards here okay so
05:09 - let's create a separate function just
05:11 - like he has show help and let's create a
05:17 - new CD help sit help equals CT help
05:21 - create a new object and let's name it
05:25 - how he named it here alright so I've got
05:29 - three cards I have to add some images
05:34 - this one is an image only so it's got a
05:37 - full sized image just got a small image
05:39 - on top of some text here and this last
05:42 - card has a whole bunch of text now one
05:46 - thing I forgot to mention if you want
05:48 - those last cards where you have these
05:51 - two and we're visit the company website
05:53 - or contact the developer that's actually
05:56 - coming from this right here this line of
06:00 - code so I'm gonna grab that as well
06:06 - alright and then lastly we're going to
06:09 - call CT help dot present help and do it
06:15 - from here
06:16 - all right let's go ahead and add a
06:18 - couple of images I'm going to use icons
06:22 - eight here for my images and this is an
06:26 - icon service which is really helpful I
06:28 - use it for everything if you want to
06:31 - find the link to this just check the
06:32 - description below the video let's see
06:35 - let's add this magnifying glass icon I'm
06:37 - choosing the size here
06:39 - so this is gonna be my big size image
06:42 - and I am also going to grab a smaller
06:45 - one let's just grab this phone one let's
06:49 - grab the green one and let's grab it as
06:52 - a smaller size I'm just gonna drag it
06:54 - right out of this helper app that icons
06:57 - eight has and it's going to create the
07:00 - file on my desktop and I'm going to add
07:03 - these two assets into my asset library
07:05 - like that this is called icons 8 search
07:08 - icons 8 the phone with a dash in the
07:12 - middle so I'm just going to change that
07:14 - [Applause]
07:16 - this was the search this was the phone
07:20 - and now all I have to do is call the
07:25 - show help method that was going to run
07:29 - all of this code so let's give this a
07:32 - run and see what we get so as you can
07:35 - see it's literally just drop in and go
07:46 - so here goes let's click on the button
07:49 - and there we go we have our scrollable
07:51 - cards so this first one is the image
07:54 - only then we've got the smaller image
07:56 - with the text and we've got full text
07:59 - and this even has a built in scroll view
08:02 - so that's nice we've got the company
08:04 - card and then we've also got the contact
08:06 - card so this was very very easy to drop
08:09 - in and add to my app and I can see
08:12 - myself using this as a sort of welcome
08:15 - screen to or like a starter tutorial on
08:17 - how to use the app now stewards actually
08:21 - got his own set of videos and helped
08:25 - guide for this library so in addition to
08:27 - this video if you want more detail I
08:29 - mean there was a lot more detail on the
08:32 - github page itself with different
08:34 - configuration options like colors and
08:36 - stuff like that he also has an article I
08:39 - scroll all the way to the top where he
08:41 - has a lot more detail again so you can
08:44 - see more examples of how to use this
08:47 - library and he's even got a youtube
08:50 - video that walks through how to install
08:52 - it and how to set it up so I'm going to
08:54 - link to all of those things in the
08:56 - description below if you want to check
08:59 - out some more of Stewart's libraries
09:01 - feel free to go to his github page he
09:04 - also has another one which I want to
09:06 - take a look at in the future called the
09:07 - what's new template and it's an easy way
09:10 - of dropping in a dialog like this I just
09:14 - go ahead and click on Stewart Lynch
09:16 - right there and go to his repositories
09:18 - and you'll see a bunch of different
09:20 - things that he's written that could be
09:22 - useful for your app if you want to check
09:24 - out more cool and useful libraries that
09:26 - you can add to your app I have a github
09:28 - library's playlist make sure you check
09:30 - that out on the screen right now alright
