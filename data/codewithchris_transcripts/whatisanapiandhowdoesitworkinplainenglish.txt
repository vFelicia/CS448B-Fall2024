00:00 - hey cuckoo let me ask you a question how
00:02 - do apps let you create an account and
00:04 - login with your Facebook or Google
00:06 - credentials here's another one how does
00:08 - your favorite weather app get today's
00:10 - weather forecast the answer to both of
00:12 - these questions they talk to other
00:14 - systems to get the data or to verify
00:17 - your credentials and the way that these
00:19 - two systems talk to each other is do
00:21 - something called an API or application
00:24 - programming interface an API simply
00:28 - states the rules for the communication
00:30 - to happen for example if you're applying
00:32 - for a passport you can't just go to the
00:35 - printing facilities and make yourself a
00:37 - passport there's a certain procedure
00:38 - that you have to follow you fill out the
00:41 - forms you take a photo you take these
00:42 - documents to a passport office and you
00:45 - talk to the lady and you hand in your
00:46 - documents you pay the fee and then you
00:48 - wait you have no idea what's happening
00:50 - behind the scenes once you hand in your
00:52 - documents the system took your inputs
00:54 - it's working in the back and when it's
00:56 - ready it'll produce your passport and
00:58 - give it to you this is exactly like how
01:01 - an API works the passport production
01:03 - process is the system that we want to
01:05 - communicate with we can't access the
01:08 - internals of the system we can only talk
01:10 - to the API layer which in this case is
01:12 - the lady at the counter at the passport
01:15 - office this is known as an endpoint
01:17 - which just means that she's a point of
01:19 - contact for us to submit our inputs with
01:22 - each endpoint there is a protocol about
01:25 - what inputs are required and what result
01:27 - you'll get in return
01:28 - if you don't supply the correct inputs
01:31 - then your requests will get rejected
01:33 - normally you'll also have to supply an
01:35 - API key with your request which is just
01:39 - a unique ID to identify your app this
01:41 - way the system has a record of who is
01:44 - accessing its endpoints now imagine that
01:47 - different systems will each have their
01:50 - own API with different endpoints and
01:52 - different protocols for each endpoint
01:54 - about what inputs are required your app
01:56 - can communicate and interact with all of
01:59 - these different systems through their
02:00 - respective api's luckily all api's will
02:04 - have some sort of documentation
02:05 - describing how to communicate with the
02:07 - endpoints and some systems won't have an
02:10 - API so you won't be able to talk to that
02:12 - system at all
02:13 - now let's see a more concrete example of
02:15 - working with an API oh yeah one quick
02:20 - thing today's video is sponsored by
02:22 - Atlanta ticket dotnet atlanticnet
02:25 - provides great VPS hosting and they are
02:28 - offering a free one gig virtual server
02:30 - with SSDs free block storage and free
02:33 - snapshots for an entire year in addition
02:36 - to that get $25 and free credits to use
02:39 - on any other services they offer try
02:42 - Atlanta net to develop test or launch
02:44 - your next project ease of use is
02:46 - something that I like as it frees up my
02:48 - mind to focus on coding I also like that
02:50 - they have round-the-clock phone support
02:52 - so if I happen to get stuck I can
02:54 - contact them easily so visit Atlantic
02:56 - dotnet slash code with Chris and enter
02:59 - the code Chris to get your $25 or free
03:02 - credit these guys are great give them a
03:05 - try and don't forget to use the coupon
03:06 - code Chris to get twenty five dollars in
03:09 - free credit that's an exclusive offer
03:10 - just for you guys now let's go through
03:17 - an example with an actual API this is
03:20 - News API where you can get the top
03:22 - headlines and news articles from a
03:25 - variety of different sources and this is
03:28 - an API that we actually work with inside
03:30 - of my courses now let's take a look at
03:33 - the endpoints that are available through
03:35 - News API so this one gives you all
03:39 - articles about Bitcoin in the last month
03:42 - sorted by the most recent first this URL
03:46 - is the endpoint and it gives you
03:50 - everything these are the inputs these
03:53 - parameters here so they're querying for
03:55 - Bitcoin right and they you can supply a
03:59 - date range and then you can also supply
04:02 - a sort what field you want to sort by so
04:06 - they want to sort by publish date and
04:08 - finally the last parameter that you have
04:11 - to input is an API key now this is
04:13 - actually my API key because I am logged
04:16 - in and so if I hit this endpoint right
04:19 - here and pass in these inputs they would
04:23 - know that I did this and they
04:25 - have a record of that and they can
04:26 - identify who is accessing their API
04:29 - before I actually hit this API endpoint
04:33 - let's take a look at another endpoint
04:35 - now this one you can see is a little
04:38 - different and it gives the top headlines
04:40 - so I guess it's the top news for today
04:45 - and here they're specifying different
04:47 - inputs they're putting in the country
04:50 - category just business and then again
04:53 - you have to supply your API key to
04:55 - access here they're using that same
05:00 - endpoint from our first example
05:02 - that's called everything and this
05:04 - applying a query called Apple from -
05:07 - this is a date range sort by popularity
05:10 - this time so let's try one of these API
05:13 - calls so all I have to do is just put it
05:17 - into my browser like that and so I'm
05:20 - hitting this news API dot-org v2
05:22 - everything endpoint and I'm passing in
05:25 - these inputs and I'm also passing in my
05:27 - API key so when I hit enter I make that
05:30 - request to that endpoint and I get that
05:33 - these results according to the
05:35 - parameters that I've specified and this
05:37 - data format is called JSON which we'll
05:40 - go through in the next video next week
05:43 - but it's in the data format that I can
05:46 - parse and process and I can extract this
05:49 - information to use inside my app you can
05:52 - see each of these articles I can it's
05:56 - surrounded by these brackets here I
05:58 - won't get too much into it but each of
06:01 - them has well defined fields called
06:03 - author title description URL URL - image
06:06 - publish that the actual content and so
06:10 - it makes it very easy to grab each piece
06:13 - of information for each article and then
06:16 - format it inside my app and display it
06:18 - inside a scrollable list or something so
06:21 - now you understand what an API is well
06:24 - what's an SDK SDK stands for software
06:27 - development kit these are usually bits
06:30 - of code that will make it easier for you
06:31 - to work with an API so some systems will
06:34 - have an API and offer an SDK
06:37 - you can download and use in your project
06:39 - which will make it easier for you to
06:41 - work with that particular API there are
06:44 - thousands of api's out there and you can
06:46 - browse through them through API
06:48 - directories like this one at
06:49 - programmable web I actually think this
06:52 - is one of the largest API directories so
06:54 - if there's a particular API that you
06:56 - want to see a demo of please leave a
06:57 - comment below and I'll take a look at it
06:59 - and if you've enjoyed this video please
07:01 - give it a thumbs up and subscribe to the
07:03 - channel if you haven't already I really
07:05 - appreciate you and I'll see you next
07:06 - time
