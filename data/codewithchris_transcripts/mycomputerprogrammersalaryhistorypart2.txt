00:06 - uh but anyways I left what most people
00:08 - would call a good thing um because I was
00:11 - getting promoted and I was well
00:13 - respected and everything but I decided
00:15 - to leave that to start my own business
00:17 - now get this I didn't really have a
00:19 - solid business plan or idea or what I
00:21 - was going to do I was really interested
00:24 - in SEO um at the time and I was studying
00:27 - it in my spare time I wanted to start an
00:28 - SEO company
00:30 - uh and keep in mind back then SEO was
00:32 - still relatively new I wanted to work
00:34 - with local businesses and increase their
00:36 - search presence and stuff like that so I
00:38 - left to do that without really a solid
00:40 - plan on what I was going to do so
00:42 - needless to say after I left I had no
00:45 - work um I I didn't really do too much
00:49 - and so I think for the first two weeks I
00:51 - was just resting and reving in the fact
00:53 - that I didn't have to go to work um what
00:56 - I actually ended up doing soon after
00:59 - leaving at company a was I started
01:02 - working with Company B doing contracts
01:04 - for them because uh they knew that I had
01:07 - left and they said hey we have this
01:09 - little project for you if you want it
01:11 - and we're going to pay you a consulting
01:13 - company uh type fee it wasn't $175 an
01:17 - hour but it was still more than I was
01:19 - making at company a so I said you know
01:22 - I'm not doing anything why not so I
01:24 - started doing these little contracts for
01:25 - them and soon enough I found myself like
01:27 - a freelancer I was basically doing
01:29 - contract work what I was exactly what I
01:32 - was doing at company a but except making
01:34 - more money uh in less time it was also
01:37 - at this time that there were two
01:38 - employees from company a you know the
01:40 - consulting company I just left that they
01:42 - wanted to start their own thing and they
01:44 - had some contract work for me to do so I
01:47 - decided to do that for them uh but soon
01:50 - enough I I said you know what I want in
01:52 - on this I I kind of want to start this
01:55 - with you and they eventually they left
01:58 - company a and while they couldn't give
02:00 - me Equity I decided to join them as
02:03 - their first employee but with profit
02:06 - sharing so I got something like 3%
02:08 - profit sharing which was huge because at
02:11 - that company a there was a group of
02:13 - Partners at the very top and they got a
02:16 - small percentage of profit sharing but
02:19 - that company a was making millions of
02:21 - dollars so you can imagine like even 3%
02:24 - 5% or something like that is is a great
02:27 - amount of money uh so you know I had 3%
02:30 - profit sharing I had no equity I was
02:32 - working with these two guys who were
02:33 - much older than me actually and uh so
02:36 - they had a lot of business experience
02:38 - and uh technical experience on top of me
02:41 - and I was okay with that at this point
02:42 - because you know what I'm kind of
02:43 - working in my own business I'm I'm
02:46 - seeing something from the ground up and
02:48 - that was cool I did that for about a
02:50 - year and get this we were working uh in
02:53 - the lunchroom of a dental office that
02:56 - one of the co-founders knew the dentist
02:58 - um the dentist was their friend so the
03:01 - dentist let us work in his dental office
03:03 - in the lunchroom so during around noon
03:06 - while we were working there would all be
03:08 - all these people they were coming in and
03:10 - heating their food and then sitting
03:11 - beside me while they're eating their
03:13 - lunch and I'm cating away if you can
03:15 - imagine that but this wasn't a public
03:17 - lunchroom it was just for the staff so
03:18 - you can imagine us three working at this
03:20 - company doing small consulting jobs we
03:23 - didn't make a lot of money I didn't
03:24 - really get paid I was okay with that um
03:27 - I think in the end we started paying our
03:29 - eles like 1,500 a month which is you
03:32 - know nothing at the point but I was okay
03:34 - because we were working on something
03:35 - we're building something we had to
03:37 - decide on the name of the business the
03:39 - the logo and everything and it was
03:41 - really cool it was really cool to see
03:42 - all of that stuff happen the scariest
03:44 - part about leaving that consulting
03:46 - company a and doing this where I was
03:49 - barely getting paid anything was my
03:51 - girlfriend's mom and telling her that I
03:53 - was going to leave this job where I was
03:55 - getting promoted I was getting like
03:57 - raises every year uh and leaving that to
04:01 - do this which paid me nothing and it was
04:03 - a big risk so you know so I'm thankful
04:06 - that she was okay with it and she didn't
04:07 - tell my now wife back then to leave me
04:12 - because I was you know going to take
04:13 - this risk so she had a little bit of
04:15 - faith in me so I'm thankful for
04:17 - that so working at this company C this
04:21 - little company with the two co-founders
04:24 - and myself let's call this company C uh
04:26 - we weren't making any money but slowly
04:29 - little by little we started getting more
04:30 - clients and we started getting more work
04:32 - so uh we hired a couple of people and I
04:35 - was in charge of managing them and as
04:37 - you can imagine having so little people
04:41 - and going through these kind of growing
04:42 - pains I started working harder and
04:44 - harder and because I treated this like
04:46 - my own business uh there were no set
04:49 - hours there you didn't get to go home at
04:51 - 5 or 6 uh I was working all the time
04:54 - right and partly I think this is my
04:57 - fault right for not having a balance and
04:59 - being the young person that I was um I
05:02 - would push hard I was I would push
05:04 - really hard and I eventually burned
05:07 - myself out to be honest so during this
05:09 - time I got married as well and I
05:12 - remember during our honeymoon to the
05:14 - Bahamas I was actually working uh during
05:17 - the evenings so yeah it was tough and
05:21 - after that around around that time uh
05:23 - one of the co-founders they took me
05:25 - aside and they said Chris you're you're
05:28 - working like in a employee you're not
05:30 - thinking like a business owner and you
05:32 - know what I was giving it my all and I
05:34 - was burning myself out and I was working
05:37 - late into the night every night I
05:38 - thought I was giving everything and to
05:40 - hear him say that really hurt me you
05:42 - know it I think I got a little bit
05:44 - offended now thinking back on it he was
05:46 - trying to help me and he was trying to
05:48 - explain to me to how to work smarter and
05:51 - how to find ways to get the work done
05:53 - without actually burning myself out
05:56 - because I wasn't doing a good job of it
05:58 - you know it wasn't doing anyone one good
06:00 - for me to be stretched so thin so you
06:03 - know thinking like a business owner I
06:05 - probably would have tried to to
06:06 - Outsource get help hire more people you
06:08 - know to get all the work done and
06:11 - anyways I I kind of got insulted and
06:14 - coupled with the fact that we weren't
06:15 - making that much money that fast weren't
06:18 - paying ourselves I was only getting 3%
06:20 - profit I was thinking how long would it
06:21 - take for me to actually realize um those
06:24 - gains you know for the profit sharing
06:26 - and so I decided I couldn't do that um
06:29 - it wasn't worth it for me to sacrifice
06:32 - at that time I thought sacrifice my
06:34 - marriage um for this company and and to
06:37 - do this to myself money wasn't that
06:40 - important to me that I had to do that
06:42 - and so I left and that was probably a
06:43 - year and a year and a half and at this
06:45 - point in time I just decided I'm going
06:48 - to go work at a bank because I had
06:50 - interned at a bank before Banks were
06:52 - notorious for being slow moving uh you
06:56 - know working set hours going home at 5:
06:59 - and pay was decent not good but it was
07:01 - decent and I decided I would rather have
07:03 - decent pay but a good work life balance
07:06 - you know go home at 5:00 not worry about
07:08 - work and not get stressed out and not
07:10 - burn myself out so I I decided to do
07:13 - that um around this time as well those
07:16 - two guys from Company B remember when I
07:18 - did the Silverlight Tech group with
07:20 - those two guys by this time they were
07:23 - actually 11 people big so they caught me
07:26 - at the right time and they said you know
07:28 - Chris how are you doing at at that
07:30 - business how are you feeling so I told
07:31 - them how I felt and said you know what
07:32 - before you go work at that bank why
07:35 - don't you give us a try do four months
07:37 - with us or was it 3 months we'll pay you
07:39 - this amount of money see how you like it
07:42 - and uh we'll take it from there and no
07:45 - harm done if you decide to to leave so I
07:48 - decided to take them up on that offer
07:49 - and I worked at their their startup
07:51 - their little company for about 3 months
07:55 - and it was awesome it was it was really
07:57 - awesome working at a company that was
07:59 - just the right size it was about 10
08:00 - people because it was because you knew
08:03 - everybody and there was a really good
08:05 - sense of family everyone helped everyone
08:08 - out um we shared victories together we
08:11 - shared losses together uh and it was
08:14 - there was just this great sense of team
08:17 - and family in that company and after 3
08:20 - months I decided to join them full-time
08:23 - and I started the salary there at 70k so
08:27 - it was just 2K more than when I left the
08:29 - company a okay so when I started working
08:33 - with this uh company C this smaller 10
08:36 - person or 11 person consulting company I
08:39 - got to work on Windows Phone 7 at that
08:42 - moment in time Windows phone just
08:43 - launched and guess what you built
08:46 - Windows Phone Apps using silver light so
08:48 - it was right up my alley so I got to
08:50 - work on more touchscreen stuff and this
08:52 - time mobile that was my first fora into
08:54 - Mobile and we built Windows phone apps
08:57 - for people for clients I didn't get to
08:59 - travel as much anymore because uh their
09:01 - clients were all local after doing
09:03 - Windows Phone 7 with them uh they got
09:05 - some work for iOS and nobody at our
09:09 - company knew iOS or objective c so they
09:12 - gave me the task to learn it and to do
09:14 - it for this big Canadian Broadcasting
09:16 - Company and so I had to learn Objective
09:19 - C in in something like a month and I
09:21 - built this iPad app for them to read the
09:24 - news on it wasn't great I mean I mean
09:27 - presentation wise it looked good but
09:29 - behind the scenes the code was a mess
09:30 - because it was my first foray into
09:32 - Objective C and memory management back
09:34 - then you had to uh allocate objects
09:37 - deallocate objects you had to manage
09:39 - your own memory and uh you would either
09:41 - get this terrible crash if you didn't
09:43 - manage it well or you'd get a slow
09:45 - memory leak and your app would
09:47 - eventually crash so you'd have to find
09:50 - the sources of these memory leaks and
09:52 - and solve them it was a great learning
09:54 - experience and I and I loved having uh
09:57 - gone through it because now I know um
10:00 - what it's like and how things work under
10:02 - the hood but it was kind of a nightmare
10:05 - to do and I'm so glad I don't have to
10:07 - manage memory now working with Swift and
10:09 - building apps now but anyways working at
10:12 - that company I saw it Grow from uh 12
10:15 - people I keep changing this number but
10:17 - it was something around 10 to 12 I think
10:19 - I was the 12th employee all the way up
10:21 - to 70 people and we moved offices three
10:24 - times and we started working with bigger
10:26 - and bigger clients with bigger and
10:27 - bigger demands and once again I started
10:31 - slowly getting burnt out and there was
10:33 - this one day where I was working on a
10:35 - project and it was tight timeline uh we
10:38 - were nearing the end of the wire and I
10:41 - stayed at the office till something like
10:43 - 2:00 a.m. or 3:00 a.m. and the next day
10:45 - so I went home next day I got into the
10:48 - office at 9:00 I sat down in my chair my
10:51 - eyes were hurting my back was hurting
10:53 - because I had done several nights of
10:55 - this and I said enough is enough you
10:58 - know I I can't do this anymore I need to
11:01 - take a break I literally I I wasn't
11:03 - going to quit um but I was going to take
11:05 - a break so I talked to one of the
11:07 - co-founders and I told him you know what
11:09 - I really need to take two months off
11:12 - um I don't know if I'm going to come
11:14 - back I told him
