00:00 - hey guys what's up it's Chris here in
00:02 - this video I want to show you how to put
00:03 - together an app design like this and
00:06 - this is something that I put together
00:07 - for a web flow video that I did last
00:11 - week and by no means is this a super
00:14 - spectacular app design but I thought it
00:17 - would be super helpful just to show you
00:19 - guys how I was able to build this app
00:22 - design inside of figma for those of you
00:25 - guys who are not familiar with the
00:27 - graphic software that you use for app
00:29 - development two of the most common ones
00:31 - that people use are figma and sketch now
00:34 - they're very similar but figma happens
00:37 - to be very free and so I I tend to use
00:40 - that a lot more because I know that it's
00:42 - a lot more accessible for people to use
00:44 - now the nice thing about figma as well
00:47 - is that its browser-based
00:48 - so that you can use it if you're on the
00:50 - PC or if you're on Mac and you don't
00:51 - need to install any sort of software
00:53 - there is a standalone figma app if you
00:56 - want to use that as a standalone desktop
00:59 - app but I typically use it in the
01:03 - browser a lot and as you can see here
01:06 - because it is so free I use it a lot and
01:09 - it's such a great tool for being
01:12 - absolutely free the only time you have
01:14 - to pay is if you want to collaborate as
01:16 - a team so if you're actually working in
01:19 - a team environment maybe for your job or
01:21 - maybe for an app you're building for a
01:23 - client or something like that then you
01:25 - might want to pay to have those
01:26 - collaboration features but as a solo
01:28 - indie developer using figma solo pretty
01:32 - much it's a free tool so I'm gonna show
01:36 - you how I was able to put together this
01:38 - app design there are some techniques
01:40 - here for those of you who you know are
01:42 - haven't really used figma that I think
01:44 - are interesting for you to learn and
01:47 - would be very beneficial and helpful for
01:49 - you for those of you guys who are very
01:51 - familiar with figma and graphic software
01:54 - in general then you might not learn
01:56 - anything new here furthermore I'm not
01:59 - gonna go over the very basics of figma
02:01 - like where things are and shapes and
02:03 - stuff like that so if you want that
02:06 - because I'm not sure how many of you
02:07 - guys know how to use graphic software
02:10 - like figma and sketch already and how
02:12 - many of you guys don't so if
02:14 - many of you aren't familiar with figma
02:16 - and sketch and you want to learn the
02:19 - basics then just leave a comment below
02:21 - and I'll I'll gauge how many of you
02:22 - there are if there are you know more
02:25 - than ten of you then I would be happy to
02:27 - create a basics tutorial about figma but
02:30 - for now I'm just gonna jump right into
02:32 - it and create recreate this app design
02:35 - for you so you can learn some of these
02:37 - techniques so what we're going to do is
02:39 - jump over to my figma dashboard here and
02:42 - we're gonna create a brand new file as
02:44 - you can see I actually use it quite a
02:45 - bit and you can have multiple projects
02:47 - that you collaborate with different
02:48 - people and so on we're gonna start a new
02:51 - file here and again this is right in my
02:53 - browser so it's crazy how much you can
02:55 - do in your browser one of the things
02:57 - that I like about figma is they have a
02:59 - whole bunch of preset sizes if you just
03:01 - hit a on your keyboard you can see and
03:03 - you can just select the size I'm gonna
03:05 - go with this iPhone 11 that's the
03:09 - smaller size right here and so you can
03:11 - see it creates a canvas on my left here
03:14 - you're gonna see all the layers and
03:15 - shapes that I add on the right-hand side
03:18 - here these are going to be configuring
03:20 - things like borders and positions and
03:23 - colors and gradients and stuff like that
03:25 - for the individual elements that I
03:27 - select so let's go ahead and put some
03:29 - elements on the screen so you can see
03:31 - what I'm talking about there's a ribbon
03:33 - at the top with all of your tools and so
03:36 - let's add a shape so we're gonna go with
03:38 - ellipse and as you use this more just
03:40 - take note of these shortcut keys because
03:42 - it'll really save you a lot of time as
03:44 - you move on I'm gonna try not to use too
03:46 - many keys here because for the benefit
03:50 - of you following visually so you can
03:54 - draw a circle or ellipse like that if
03:55 - you hold down shift it's gonna be a
03:57 - perfect circle so we're gonna hold down
03:58 - shift and we're gonna add a circle
03:59 - something like that
04:00 - to position there let's make it a little
04:03 - bigger actually let's hold down shift
04:05 - and I think I messed up those
04:07 - proportions I hold down shift and let's
04:10 - grow it a little bit and then we're
04:13 - gonna set the fill now the fill is just
04:15 - a fancy name for the color that's inside
04:18 - so we're gonna click open the solid
04:21 - color and instead of choosing a solid
04:23 - we're gonna hit this drop-down and
04:25 - choose linear for a linear gradient
04:28 - you can change the direction of the
04:29 - gradient by just positioning these
04:33 - handles here and by default it starts
04:36 - with a solid color on the right and sort
04:40 - of a invisible color or a color that's
04:44 - kind of near and visible on the
04:46 - right-hand side so if you wanted to
04:48 - solid colors you can just move this this
04:50 - controls to the alpha or the opacity of
04:53 - the color so dragging it all the way to
04:55 - zero just kind of makes that color
04:57 - invisible so I'm gonna go from a blue
05:00 - something like that that's fine to a
05:03 - kind of like more slight blue maybe I'll
05:08 - just go even more fine like that and so
05:11 - that's my gradient oh yeah one quick

06:04 - that's an exclusive offer just for you
06:06 - guys so let's go ahead and close that
06:11 - menu now let's add some text so there's
06:14 - another key T is for text so you can
06:17 - either press this button here or you can
06:19 - hit T on your keyboard I'm going to go
06:22 - ahead and type some text
06:26 - and as you can see I've added two
06:29 - elements to the screen the shape and
06:31 - this text and you can see that both of
06:32 - them are here so I'm going to change the
06:35 - attributes of this text you can add you
06:39 - can add your own fonts by installing a
06:41 - font helper utility
06:42 - I'm just Google think my font helper and
06:45 - you'll see it if you want to use the
06:46 - fonts that are on your own computer they
06:49 - do have a whole bunch of fonts you can
06:50 - use already so I'm just going to change
06:52 - this font to SF Pro display and I'm
06:56 - gonna change this to bold and it's the
06:58 - regular and I'll change the font size to
07:00 - 24 so it's gonna go there and then you
07:03 - can just drag it and position it now if
07:05 - you want to get really accurate with
07:07 - your measurements you can hold down alt
07:09 - on your keyboard and so let's select the
07:12 - text first and hold down alt and you can
07:14 - hover your mouse around different
07:16 - elements and you can see the margins and
07:19 - the relation of that text element to
07:22 - other elements because now my mouse is
07:24 - over the frame I can see how far my
07:28 - label is away from the top edge the left
07:31 - edge but if I hovered over the circle
07:33 - then I would get measurements relative
07:36 - to the circle but I actually want to
07:38 - position the margin so I'm gonna make it
07:41 - relative to the frame and then by
07:43 - tapping the arrow keys on my keyboard I
07:45 - can I can kind of position it I can make
07:48 - sure that it's 20 from the left if I
07:50 - want to be very accurate and line things
07:52 - up alright so the next thing we have is
07:55 - this sort of text here and then we have
07:58 - a sort of progress bar so let's add
08:01 - another piece of text I'm gonna hit T
08:03 - this time because you have already seen
08:06 - me choose that so I say you are 23 hours
08:12 - away from reward and this one we're
08:19 - gonna set to back to regular and please
08:23 - we were using might have been 14 yeah
08:27 - okay so you now because this top label
08:32 - is already in place I can drag it and
08:34 - kind of see you know position like that
08:36 - but there are also some keys up here too
08:39 - kind of aligned at different edges so
08:41 - for example if I want to line these two
08:44 - text elements on the left edge I can
08:46 - hold down shift and select both of them
08:48 - and then hit this and it's gonna make
08:50 - sure that they're aligned on the left
08:52 - and then you get you Center or write a
08:54 - line or top and align those different
08:57 - things all right so now let's go ahead
08:59 - and build this progress bar which is
09:01 - basically just two overlapping
09:03 - rectangles so let's choose rectangle and
09:07 - let's do something like that it doesn't
09:12 - matter exactly what height I'm not gonna
09:13 - try to be exact here but you can adjust
09:16 - the width and the height right here so
09:20 - that's our progress bar but it doesn't
09:22 - have any rounded corners so you'll see
09:24 - that a lot of elements actually have
09:26 - this here this is a corner radius so
09:28 - this dictates you could either enter a
09:31 - number or you could put your mouse over
09:33 - this and you can drag and this indicates
09:35 - you know how rounded the corners are so
09:37 - let's go ahead and just set it to 10
09:40 - right and this is actually degrees so if
09:43 - you want it to rotate something you can
09:44 - go ahead and do that so I'm gonna undo
09:46 - it all right so now we've got this sort
09:48 - of gray progress bar which is going to
09:55 - represent the track now sometimes I like
09:58 - to zoom in and a shortcut key to zoom in
10:00 - is if you hold down command and this
10:03 - might be the Windows key for you if
10:05 - you're you on PC and just scroll your
10:07 - wheel and then you can zoom in and zoom
10:10 - out and then when you're zoomed in
10:13 - sometimes if you want to move quickly to
10:15 - the other side rather than dragging
10:16 - these bars here you can hold down
10:18 - spacebar and your cursor will change to
10:20 - a hand and then you can just kind of pan
10:22 - around like that so I'm gonna scroll out
10:25 - a little bit those two shortcuts will be
10:28 - really handy for you to navigate around
10:30 - the screen I want to position this in
10:33 - the middle so you can kind of just drag
10:35 - and wait for these red lines to show up
10:36 - and that's that's how I know this guy is
10:39 - in the center here now in order to
10:42 - create the track it's basically the same
10:45 - rectangle on top but with less width and
10:49 - then a gradient so I'm going to go ahead
10:51 - and take this element
10:52 - and I'm gonna press command-c and
10:56 - command V just to create a second one so
10:59 - you can see this is my first one this is
11:01 - my second one for the second one am I
11:03 - going to change the width to something
11:05 - like 250 so it's still hard to see right
11:08 - now but let me just change the color
11:09 - there then you can see it's like that
11:13 - and just like before we're going to
11:16 - change it from solid to a gradient but
11:18 - this time we're going to do that do that
11:23 - and we're gonna go from let's say this
11:29 - blue let's say a green and then the
11:33 - second color here we're gonna make it a
11:35 - blue like that but I don't want it to be
11:37 - an invisible color so I'm actually going
11:39 - to drag it to a hundred percent opacity
11:42 - and so you see something like that as
11:45 - for the icon right here I didn't create
11:47 - this icon from scratch instead I use a
11:50 - service called icons eight.com
11:53 - where you can grab a whole bunch of um
11:56 - icons for your use so this is what it is
12:01 - right here
12:03 - this is icons eight and so I think I
12:07 - search for present or gift or gift or
12:09 - something like that
12:14 - and so this is where I get icons so you
12:17 - can when you download it especially if
12:19 - you're working with figma or sketch you
12:21 - want to download it as an SVG as a
12:24 - vector file so that you can scale it
12:26 - down and scale it up without losing any
12:29 - quality and that's a great thing about
12:31 - working with vectors versus with raster
12:34 - and if those terms kind of escape you
12:36 - don't worry about it
12:37 - just look for vector so they also have a
12:41 - desktop app which I love
12:43 - so rather than just grabbing something
12:45 - from the website I have this desktop app
12:49 - right here so I can juice gift and there
12:52 - it is and I can choose what format I
12:53 - want it in so there's that and I can
12:55 - simply click and drag it it rather than
12:59 - from the website I would have to
13:00 - download it to my desktop and then drag
13:02 - that file into my browser so all right
13:05 - so I'm gonna scale it when you're
13:07 - scaling it you can either use these
13:09 - arrows or you can actually use the scale
13:12 - tool which is shortcut key K so when you
13:15 - do that I would recommend that you do
13:17 - that you can scale it down and the way
13:20 - you can tell that you're using the scale
13:23 - tool and not the the move tool is if you
13:28 - take a look at my mouse cursor it just
13:31 - looks like a two-way arrow but when you
13:33 - press K and using the scale you can see
13:36 - that there's an extra arrow on top of
13:39 - the arrowheads on either side so let me
13:41 - show you that again
13:42 - there's V and there's K you can see that
13:45 - difference using the scale tool will
13:47 - give you actually what you want because
13:52 - sometimes using the move tool and you're
13:54 - trying to scale with it it doesn't scale
13:56 - everything properly all the time so
13:58 - there's that little icon there let's
14:00 - zoom out a little bit and so I'm gonna
14:03 - just copy this command C command V and
14:07 - I've got a second piece of text and as
14:11 - you can see you can make sure that it's
14:14 - 20 like you can make sure your
14:16 - measurements are aligned properly so
14:20 - it's 20 from the left it's 20 from this
14:22 - progress bar this guy is 20 from that
14:25 - progressbar it's also 20 from the left
14:27 - so of the frame so you just make sure
14:30 - everything's aesthetically pleasing and
14:32 - lined up properly and and for this
14:42 - design I use the slightly different
14:44 - color for the text you could also do
14:47 - that just change it from block to
14:48 - something else but I'm not going to
14:49 - bother with that for now
14:51 - alright so this part is kind of the the
14:55 - greeting in this that's part
14:57 - well actually this second part is going
15:00 - to be the stats part but this this top
15:02 - part is kind of like a summary right so
15:05 - if you want if you wanted to group it
15:08 - together to keep things organized you
15:10 - could do that rather than having a long
15:12 - list of elements right you can go ahead
15:16 - and select all of the elements here
15:18 - let's not select the circle because
15:20 - that's part of a background we're going
15:22 - to put that in a separate group called
15:23 - background and we're gonna press command
15:27 - G to put it all into a group so used to
15:29 - using these shortcut keys I said I
15:31 - wouldn't use many of them but yeah so
15:34 - you can even right-click and choose
15:35 - group selection so that's command G you
15:39 - put it all into a group like that and
15:40 - you can name it your name its summary
15:43 - all right so now it just keeps things
15:46 - organized and you can move everything
15:48 - together as a group because they're
15:50 - grouped together and you can also apply
15:52 - some of these attributes to it as a
15:54 - group all right so now we're gonna work
15:58 - on the stats here on the bottom so let
16:02 - me just double check one other tip is
16:05 - that you know sometimes if this is
16:07 - grouped up so you can see it's grouped
16:09 - up under stats here it's really hard to
16:11 - select the the individual element but if
16:15 - you hold down command yeah if you hold
16:21 - down command on your keyboard you can
16:23 - then actually select an element inside
16:25 - of the group so let's go ahead and do
16:29 - that
16:31 - yeah so we're gonna do I know the reason
16:38 - why I wanted to select it cuz I wanted
16:39 - to see what font size I used bold 14
16:42 - these guys were bold 48 so that was a 14
16:52 - and then there was another piece of text
16:57 - down here this was 48 and let's change
17:03 - the color to something like that
17:17 - all right now because this text should
17:21 - be centered you can actually change how
17:24 - it's aligned so let's choose text center
17:28 - and I know it visually doesn't make a
17:30 - difference right now but if you end up
17:32 - typing more text into there and then
17:35 - sometimes positioning it is also easier
17:39 - if you set at the center if you're
17:41 - intending that text to be centered or so
17:44 - we can choose these two text elements
17:46 - and we can choose Center them just to
17:48 - make sure that they're they're both kind
17:50 - of aligned in the middles and then let's
17:55 - go ahead and hit command D you know
17:58 - before I use the command C with command
18:00 - V and that's how you create a second
18:03 - copy but you can also press command D to
18:05 - duplicate it and so you you know you
18:08 - just create a second copy there press
18:10 - command D again and there's another copy
18:12 - now the cool thing about figma is that
18:14 - because I made a duplicate and then I
18:16 - dragged it a little bit to the right it
18:19 - kind of knows that you're trying to
18:22 - maybe create multiple duplicates so when
18:24 - you hit command D again it automatically
18:26 - places it at the same it gives the same
18:30 - gap in between this these two and these
18:33 - two and it instead of placing it right
18:35 - on top like it did the first time
18:36 - it put it beside it because then notice
18:39 - that I did it with the second one so for
18:41 - the third one it kind of put it
18:42 - on this side and that's really really
18:44 - nice that it noticed that and then again
18:49 - I can group these guys up right and call
18:52 - this stats and then now I can move it as
18:55 - oops let me just undo now I can move it
18:59 - as a group and kind of place it in the
19:04 - middle you know and we probably want
19:08 - this group to be twenty from there let's
19:13 - see what else we have here
19:15 - all right so now we're gonna work on
19:17 - this little box here and you can see it
19:19 - has a slight drop shadow and these drop
19:20 - shadows are also very easy to do inside
19:23 - of figma so we're gonna start with a
19:25 - rectangle the shortcut key is our in
19:27 - case you didn't notice that and let's
19:31 - drag a rectangle something like that and
19:37 - now here's here's one thing you can do
19:40 - as well which which makes it very handy
19:42 - the reason I was fidgeting with the this
19:45 - width is because you know how we're
19:47 - using 20 pixel margins between you know
19:52 - all the elements on 20 from the left and
19:55 - 20 from the right in case actually this
19:57 - this guy is 23 but if I wanted 20 from
20:03 - the left and 20 from the right you know
20:04 - I can make this rectangle the entire
20:06 - width and then I can go up here and I
20:08 - can say minus 20 and minus 20 and that's
20:13 - gonna essentially minus 40 and then I
20:17 - can position it in the middle and then
20:19 - now it's perfectly 20 from the left and
20:21 - 20 from the right so that's the
20:23 - technique that I used sometimes as well
20:26 - all right you already know how to do
20:28 - rounded corners so we can go ahead and
20:31 - do that
20:33 - actually we rounded it ten before so
20:36 - we'll stick with ten and to do a drop
20:38 - shadow all you have to do is add an
20:40 - effect so let's go ahead and add a drop
20:42 - shadow like that we're gonna configure
20:44 - the blower in the distance by clicking
20:47 - this little Sun icon so let's just use
20:51 - the measurements I used here
20:53 - want to fidget with it there's the
20:57 - rectangle 20 blur and 10 distance and 15
21:05 - 15 opacity in terms of the color of the
21:09 - shadow now this I actually learned from
21:11 - magnet oh so I have him to thank for
21:13 - this sort of generic set of values so
21:15 - his rule is whatever distance you put
21:20 - you blur it double the amount and the
21:24 - value that he usually uses in terms of
21:26 - the opacity of the shadow is 15 and I
21:29 - agree it looks really nice so I've been
21:31 - sticking to that rule myself whenever I
21:33 - do these things so it's got like this
21:35 - nice slight subtle shadow which I really
21:38 - like and I also changed it to white now
21:42 - notice that you can also just type in
21:43 - the color code the hex code if you know
21:45 - it so you can do that all right so what
21:49 - else do we have here we have some bold
21:52 - text 14 size and then we have these
21:54 - little boxes here and now these boxes
21:57 - let's hold down command so we can drill
22:00 - down I just want to notice the different
22:04 - 2412 I just want to notice these
22:06 - different font sizes and we've got this
22:08 - dotted line one which I'll show you how
22:10 - to do as well so let's go ahead and add
22:13 - some yeah we'll add some text here
22:16 - you're on a 10 day streak and we'll
22:22 - change that to sorry let's just
22:27 - double-check what we had okay and then
22:30 - this font was going to be green like
22:36 - that
22:41 - let's make this ten and ten and we're
22:48 - going to choose our four rectangle if
22:51 - you want to create a square just hold
22:53 - shift and drag you're gonna create a
22:55 - square like that I think these were a
23:00 - little bigger like that so we might
23:03 - actually end up making this box a little
23:05 - bigger depending on what we need alright
23:07 - so this this color let's just copy this
23:10 - color because we're gonna need it for
23:12 - these squares as well paste it in there
23:15 - let's give this guy a corner radius of
23:18 - ten and let's put some text inside of it
23:20 - so that's 7.5 and this is gonna be white
23:24 - so let's do FFF because that's gonna be
23:28 - white and then I think I believe it was
23:31 - 14 so let's just put that in there just
23:39 - drill in a little bit it's gonna make it
23:41 - a little easier actually 14 seems kind
23:42 - of small but I'm gonna hit T for another
23:46 - piece of text he's gonna put ours and
23:49 - see this this is actually behind the
23:51 - square if you wanted to rearrange
23:52 - elements you just click and drag so
23:55 - we'll drag it in front of this the
23:59 - square here oops so let's put that here
24:03 - let's change that to regular you can
24:07 - change this to 12 and change it to white
24:11 - as well so let's put it right there and
24:14 - let's make this guy a little bigger I
24:16 - think it was it might have been 18 okay
24:22 - so actually I'm gonna select these two
24:23 - and Center it and I'm gonna change it to
24:27 - text-align:center as well and then just
24:30 - line it up right in the middle there and
24:33 - then I'm going to duplicate this by
24:35 - pressing command D and drag it down here
24:37 - and change it to
24:41 - this color right here so in case you
24:46 - can't click it and you can't see it you
24:48 - can always select it from here and
24:51 - hitting this will make it visible or
24:54 - invisible this sort of eyeball here
24:56 - alright so let's change the font of this
24:59 - text we can actually see it and this
25:01 - would be like Jan 1st or something like
25:03 - that
25:04 - and now let's group this in a single
25:09 - group because we're going to be
25:11 - duplicating them so the 7.5 the Jan 1st
25:13 - the hours the rectangle command G to
25:17 - group it together into a date so let's
25:19 - call this a date and then we're gonna
25:22 - press command D and duplicate it and
25:24 - move it like that and let's press
25:27 - command D and it's actually going to be
25:28 - smart enough to put it beside it right
25:30 - I'd do it again
25:32 - press command you do it again right this
25:35 - last one I'm going to make it a dotted
25:38 - line because I don't think I can fit I
25:39 - can fit another one this is 9 whereas
25:43 - this is 10 that's close enough but it
25:45 - looks a little cramped so I don't press
25:47 - undo and I'm going to position all of
25:50 - these days instead in the middle of this
25:54 - box so it's 33 40 let's move it over
26:00 - like that ok so for this particular
26:05 - square the text I want the text to be
26:11 - green so I still have that green on my
26:13 - clipboard so I'm going to change that to
26:15 - green and I'm going to make this square
26:19 - white but I got to give it a green
26:24 - dotted line right so fill I told you was
26:27 - the color that it's filled with stroke
26:30 - is the border color so it doesn't have
26:33 - any stroke but I'm gonna add a stroke so
26:35 - there by default we get that it's black
26:37 - let's change it to the green and you can
26:40 - say that you want the stroke or the
26:43 - border to be on the inside or sitting on
26:46 - the outside of the shape so it's it's
26:50 - kind of hard to tell
26:52 - so maybe go in here you can see see the
26:58 - border as this blue line you can see
26:59 - that this green line is inside the shape
27:03 - because I've set the I've set it to
27:05 - inside this rectangle here set to inside
27:10 - if I change at the outside you can see
27:12 - that now the green border sits outside
27:14 - of the shape and then centered is
27:16 - straddling yeah it's right in the middle
27:19 - so sometimes that matters sometimes that
27:21 - doesn't matter but depending on you know
27:24 - how you position your shapes and stuff
27:26 - okay now we want to change it to a
27:28 - dotted line and this is the width of the
27:30 - line let me see if I can remember
27:33 - exactly where yeah there it is
27:35 - so we're gonna want dashes and so you
27:42 - specify basically how long you want the
27:45 - dash and then how long you want the gap
27:46 - so if you want like even-even dashes and
27:52 - even gaps you'll do four and four if you
27:54 - want maybe like gaps where it's half the
27:59 - width of the - then you'll do four and -
28:02 - so you can play around with that
28:03 - whatever kind of suits your fancy so we
28:06 - have something like that now so that's
28:08 - how you're gonna do that all right
28:11 - and then now there's one more
28:12 - interesting technique to use with these
28:16 - guys here that's masking which I'll show
28:19 - you and we'll do that a little thing and
28:21 - there's also a blue circle here which
28:24 - all it is is the same blue circle here
28:27 - but positioned a little differently so
28:30 - I'm gonna grab this ellipse hit
28:32 - command-d to duplicate it I'm gonna zoom
28:35 - out a little bit and then I'm going to
28:36 - kind of move it here maybe I can hit K
28:40 - to use my scale tool to scale it up a
28:42 - bit and then I can use the rotate to
28:47 - just rotate that over there right or I
28:51 - could just change the colors or anything
28:52 - like that you can also move your mouse
28:54 - cursor to a corner and you can also just
28:57 - do that that might be a little easier to
28:59 - do so there's that alright so now we're
29:03 - going to add
29:05 - these these guys right here alright so
29:10 - let's go ahead and add a rectangle so
29:15 - you know roughly the same width like
29:20 - that roughly the same height and we are
29:24 - going to give it a corner radius so it
29:27 - looks like that so how are we gonna get
29:29 - the image into this this rounded
29:31 - rectangle
29:32 - well you literally grab an image
29:34 - download it from somewhere and then drag
29:36 - it into your browser into here so where
29:39 - I got these images was pixels com
29:43 - so it's a site where you can kind of
29:46 - grab free free stock photography some of
29:53 - them might not be free to use actually
29:55 - yeah some of them say free to use some
29:57 - of them you need attribution so just
29:59 - double check it I'm not sure but I've
30:01 - prepared a couple here all right so I'm
30:05 - gonna go ahead and drag this image into
30:08 - the browser like that so you can see
30:10 - it's really big so I'm gonna zoom out
30:13 - you can see how big this image is I'm
30:16 - just going to scale it down a little bit
30:19 - hit K on my keyboard and scale it down
30:22 - like that
30:24 - zoom back in scale it down but you can
30:30 - see that it doesn't really fit within my
30:32 - rounded rectangle which is this here so
30:36 - what you do is you you use this
30:40 - technique called masking and it exists
30:42 - in all sorts of graphics software and it
30:44 - it's done a little bit differently in
30:46 - each one but in figma you highlight the
30:50 - two things you want and what you're
30:52 - essentially doing is you're saying you
30:54 - want a cut out of or or imagine this
30:57 - shape as a window or you you want to see
31:00 - this image through that rounded
31:02 - rectangle as a window okay so you select
31:04 - both of them and you hit mask and there
31:09 - you go just like that
31:10 - sometimes you play around with the
31:12 - position I kind of get this mixed up all
31:15 - the time because if you
31:17 - if you have the image underneath like if
31:20 - you have the rectangle on top and then
31:21 - you highlight both then you hit mask you
31:23 - get a different result
31:24 - so I usually I try one way if it doesn't
31:29 - work I just reorder these two layers and
31:31 - then I try it again
31:31 - and you get the get the order that I
31:34 - want okay and then I just overlay text
31:40 - on top so I had this this is gonna be
31:44 - white text and where did my text go so
31:49 - I'm gonna add another text element I
31:51 - think I lost it
31:52 - so let's write some text first let's
31:54 - highlight it change it to white I'm
31:56 - gonna make this left aligned instead and
31:58 - let's just double check what I used so
32:03 - here I use the mixed font actually so
32:05 - this top line was 36 and the bottom
32:10 - lines were 14 and you can actually use
32:12 - that this was bold and this was medium
32:14 - so I'm gonna copy this I'm just gonna
32:17 - paste it in here
32:18 - oh yeah copy the Styles I don't want to
32:20 - do that so I because I want to show you
32:22 - 20% off heal order and Sephora so I'm
32:32 - gonna highlight the top part here I'm
32:35 - gonna choose medium I'm gonna choose
32:37 - what was it was a 36 and this was
32:41 - actually bold 36 seemed a little big
32:47 - okay
32:48 - so this bottom part then you highlight
32:51 - that part and you can choose medium so
32:55 - you can kind of alter it as you can see
32:57 - it's kind of hard to read so let me just
33:00 - position it properly from 10 and 10
33:07 - it's kind of hard to see right you can
33:09 - put a dimmed background I think I I have
33:12 - something slightly there yeah so you see
33:14 - I have this shape this vector that I
33:17 - created that's a sort of like a dimmed
33:21 - background so it fades from block to
33:24 - semi block this is semi-transparent and
33:28 - I'm going to do this same technique here
33:31 - so you can either draw your own vector
33:35 - so you can use the pen tool and you can
33:36 - draw your own shape or you can use a
33:39 - square or polygon even so let's let me
33:43 - just show you using a square here and
33:45 - then you're basically gonna mask it
33:47 - again so we'll use a square like that
33:48 - right and we'll rotate it so that it
33:53 - covers covers everything that we want it
34:00 - to cover and this is going to be let's
34:05 - say block and then again we are going to
34:08 - just put it inside there and then we'll
34:13 - put the text above it sorry like that
34:18 - all right so we've got this is the mask
34:22 - this is the rounded rectangle this is
34:24 - the image this is our sort of background
34:29 - for the text and this is the actual text
34:31 - and it's all inside this mask group so
34:34 - nothing you know it's it's looking
34:36 - through this window this rounded
34:38 - rectangle window nothing ever goes over
34:41 - that border so for this this background
34:46 - I'm going to change it from solid to
34:48 - linear okay so now change the direction
34:52 - of that will have the heaviest block on
34:54 - that side will have the gradient on this
34:57 - side so you can see right
34:59 - it makes the text a lot more legible and
35:04 - then with this mask group let's just
35:08 - change this to reward
35:10 - you're able to add a drop shadow on the
35:13 - whole thing so there's the drop shadow
35:15 - that's again configure it to 20 blur 10
35:19 - distance and 15 opacity so you get that
35:26 - slight actually are we seeing it it
35:32 - looks a little bit invisible so you can
35:36 - click this button and you can actually
35:39 - see it it's just so slight it's hard to
35:41 - tell so what else have we got here so
35:45 - we've got two more same technique so I'm
35:47 - not going to repeat I'm not gonna do it
35:50 - but I'm just gonna duplicate this reward
35:53 - and drag it here so that we can actually
35:56 - finish off this design all right I want
35:59 - to show you this circle here so for an
36:06 - ellipse just choose lips or oh and then
36:10 - go ahead and click and drag
36:12 - holding shift so you get a perfect
36:15 - circle you do something like you make it
36:17 - a little bigger depending on what you
36:19 - want and I'm gonna hold down command and
36:21 - I'm gonna choose the frame so I can make
36:23 - sure that the margins is you know 20
36:25 - from the bottom and 20 from the right
36:27 - and then I'm gonna choose a color like
36:32 - something like that and you can either
36:35 - see here's the thing you can either make
36:37 - the shape itself sorry this is the color
36:44 - so what I want to explain is that you
36:46 - can have an opacity to take color and
36:50 - that's changing the Alpha of the color
36:51 - or you can change the Alpha of the
36:54 - entire layer this is the Alpha of the
36:57 - layer alright and sometimes you just
36:59 - want to have a slightly transparent
37:01 - color and sometimes you want to have a
37:03 - slightly transparent layer it might not
37:05 - immediately be obvious what you need
37:07 - right now but a good example would be
37:11 - lets say this reward right here it's
37:16 - it's a group of items right so if I
37:20 - change if I highlight this group and I
37:22 - make it
37:23 - you know 50% transparent it's gonna make
37:26 - everything inside of that group 50%
37:28 - transparent it's gonna make you know the
37:31 - whole all of the items 50% transparent
37:35 - so that's the handy thing about
37:36 - modifying opacity at the layer level all
37:40 - right and I just realized that we should
37:42 - probably group these things some more so
37:44 - that it it's a little more organized so
37:47 - here are the days there's the streak box
37:50 - here are the days is this one part of it
37:55 - yeah so I've grouped this all up and
37:57 - call this the streak and this one was
38:01 - the stats okay so that's a little more
38:07 - organized so this is my these two are
38:10 - the background so I'm going to group
38:11 - that I'm going to call it the background
38:13 - and this one is my menu well this is the
38:17 - menu circle so let's let's build up the
38:19 - menu circle with a couple more elements
38:21 - and then we're going to group that
38:22 - together and call it the menu so I'm
38:24 - gonna make this semi-transparent let's
38:26 - say 80% and I'm going to put a put two
38:31 - two rectangles for the plus now here
38:36 - would be a chance I could use an ad icon
38:39 - I can simply drag it on but I couldn't
38:43 - find one that was exactly what I wanted
38:46 - and so I decided to just create two
38:49 - rectangles oops
38:50 - like that
38:57 - all right so this one's gonna be a
38:59 - little tricky so 48 48 15 15 oh that's
39:04 - perfect okay now I'm gonna duplicate
39:06 - this and then just change the angle to
39:09 - 90% like that and that gives me my plus
39:12 - and you see how these are two separate
39:14 - rectangles here in my layers list you
39:16 - can actually combine it into one object
39:19 - or one vector if you hold these two and
39:21 - you use this this button called Union
39:23 - now there are a couple different ones if
39:25 - you pull it down you can subtract one
39:28 - vector from the other so it's like
39:30 - taking one shape out of another you can
39:34 - combine the two like I want to do here
39:35 - to create a single vector which
39:38 - represents my plus symbol and you could
39:40 - do intersect and exclude so I'm going to
39:43 - choose Union and now I get my one vector
39:46 - which is consisting of these two
39:49 - rectangles so this is just I'm gonna
39:51 - call this the add icon and I'm going to
39:54 - group these two elements come ahead G
39:56 - into a menu button wow that's a really
40:05 - big menu button but luckily because I
40:07 - grouped it together I can just hit the
40:08 - group hit K and then I can just scale
40:11 - this guy down so that's basically it I
40:19 - hope that you learned some pretty
40:20 - interesting techniques in putting
40:23 - together this screen all right we ran
40:27 - out of time to do it in this video to
40:28 - put together a second screen but I do
40:31 - want to continue to do these sorts of
40:33 - design videos where I demonstrate
40:36 - different techniques with using figma or
40:38 - sketch let me know in the comments below
40:41 - if you'd like to see like a figma basics
40:43 - tutorial and I'll also let me know if
40:46 - you are an expert or a designer
40:49 - let me know if there's different things
40:51 - I can improve on maybe different
40:53 - techniques I didn't know or I could have
40:54 - done better
40:55 - different shortcut keys that I didn't
40:56 - use let me know because I want to learn
40:59 - and I'm not by any means an expert in
41:01 - figma all right I hope this was helpful
