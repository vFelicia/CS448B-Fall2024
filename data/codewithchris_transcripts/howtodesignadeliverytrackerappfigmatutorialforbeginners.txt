00:00 - Design has always been something many
developers also want to learn about.
00:03 - Unfortunately, whenever they explore
design related topics,
00:07 - they often feel intimidated because they
feel that they do not possess a level
00:11 - of creativity or artistry to tackle
the design part of app development.
00:14 - This is probably the reason why some would
just stick to building an app
00:18 - and submitting it to the app store without
exploring the design part of things.
00:22 - But what if I told you that you can still
achieve a great looking app,
00:26 - even if you're not creative or
artistic in nature, just like me?
00:30 - Hey, Code Crew, it's JC here.
00:32 - Designer at Code is Chris, and I'll be
taking over this week's app tutorial.
00:36 - So if you remember, two weeks ago,
we released a community poll to ask
00:39 - which design, release,
topic or tutorial you want us to do.
00:42 - And to our surprise,
most of you actually wanted to learn how
00:45 - to design and eventually
called a delivery tracker.
00:48 - So in this tutorial,
we'll jump right into Figma and to do just
00:51 - that, you can access Figma
on your browser by typing Figma.
00:55 - Com, or you can also visit Figma.
00:57 - Com downloads and download
the desktop app for free.
01:00 - If you've never touched on Figma before,
don't worry, because we have a lot
01:04 - of Figma basics tutorials that you can
explore by kicking the card on top.
01:09 - Also, before we go deeper,
01:11 - when we say Delivery tracker that doesn't
refer to something like Uber or any food
01:16 - delivery app, we don't want to get your
hopes up because the design
01:19 - and development of something
like that can be very complex.
01:21 - We'll just focus on something like
01:23 - a logistics tracking service
like FedEx DHL Ups, you name it.
01:28 - And for this lesson,
we will just focus on designing two
01:30 - screens of such app,
the Homepage and the Results page.
01:34 - Since we're all beginners here,
01:36 - we want this app to be simple,
focus and straightforward while still
01:40 - maintaining that fresh,
green and modern look or UI.
01:44 - Like I mentioned, we will only average our
problem solving skills here and not much
01:48 - on the artistic or
creative side of things.
01:50 - Don't worry, I'm sure that will still
create a really good app design by the end
01:54 - of this tutorial, specifically,
one that looks something like this.
01:57 - So what you're seeing on screen right now
02:00 - is the finished product
of the Delivery tracker app.
02:02 - We'll use this as a reference so that we
don't have to start from scratch,
02:06 - because in this case,
it's going to be a very long video.
02:09 - All right, so first things first,
02:11 - we need to make sure that we have
the right plugins for our icons.
02:14 - We use Icons eight here at Code is Chris,
02:17 - but you can definitely use other plugins
out there on the Figma community.
02:20 - Simply click on the Figma button,
02:22 - click on Plugins and browse Plugins
and Community and search for icons.
02:29 - So right here you can see click on plugin
02:31 - right here, you can see a lot of
icon plugins that you can choose from.
02:35 - So we have icons eight Material Design,
Feather and fund also icons.
02:39 - Let me reinstall this.
02:40 - Alright.
02:41 - So once you have any icon plugin
installed, let's go back
02:47 - and then let's click on F,
Press F or click on the Frame tool
02:52 - and click on iphone Eleven Pro
or iphone Ten reset.
02:56 - And let's name this as the home.
02:59 - Now we want this.
03:01 - We want to set the background color
to something a little darker because we
03:05 - don't want pure white
on our user interface.
03:08 - We need to have that level of dimension.
03:11 - So let's say sounds good.
03:14 - So this one is API seven F, eight F nine.
03:17 - If you want to copy this.
03:19 - Xcode next is to implement a layout
grid system in this frame.
03:23 - So click on the frame,
click on Layout grid the plus icon.
03:26 - Then click on this dot here.
03:30 - Click select columns and then
03:33 - type and four API a stretch
margin of 20 and gather of.
03:41 - Alright, so this is
the four point grid system.
03:44 - So every value should be divisible by four
03:47 - to make things responsive when
they are scaled up or scaled down.
03:50 - So
03:51 - once that's done, you can actually
adjust the color of this.
03:56 - If you want something that's less
03:57 - obtrusive, so maybe blue,
then put it something like that.
04:02 - Ten.
04:05 - Alright, that's a lot better.
04:07 - Alright, so now next step
is create that header.
04:12 - Alright.
So now that we have the grids
04:14 - and the background color, it's time
to create that content on that screen.
04:20 - First things first as the header.
04:21 - There are the menu bar.
04:23 - So this is a simple menu bar so you can
see right here this symbol menu icon.
04:28 - So head over to your icons.
04:30 - Eight plugin or whatever icons
plugin you can download it.
04:35 - But for menu, just type in menu and then
04:37 - the drug and drop on your workspace
as you can see right there.
04:41 - Alright, so let's set this to 32,
make sure that it's big enough or screen
04:51 - and just drag it right there.
04:53 - So
04:55 - if you want to hide the layout grid,
if it's still inclusive or is disrupting
05:00 - you, you can click on the icon here or you
can press control G if you're on a Mac.
05:06 - Alright, so another that's clear.
05:08 - Let's type in the main
content of this home screen.
05:11 - Our home page.
05:13 - Say enter your tracking number here
or enter your tracking number is good.
05:19 - You can choose whatever font you like.
05:21 - Just make sure that it's in bold
or size 24 or around that size.
05:25 - That drag a here.
05:30 - Let's say let's make sure
that it's aligned in our grid.
05:35 - All right.
05:36 - Next is that input field.
05:38 - So to create an input field,
it's very simple.
05:40 - Just type in your place folder first
and a random number like that and then
05:45 - press shift eight, then that converts
your text into an auto layout.
05:50 - So this is the input field.
05:54 - And then what you're going to do is
05:55 - to click on fill and make sure that it's
on pure white so that's six apps
06:02 - and make sure that the padding and this
06:08 - one is 20 2012 and twelve or maybe 16.
06:19 - Alright, so one app dot put
app here and just stretch it.
06:24 - Who decides?
06:27 - Turn on the grid and then make
sure that it snaps for the grids.
06:35 - Turn off the grid and now you're done.
06:38 - You can also add a shadow here
to add a little bit mention.
06:42 - So click on EFC.
06:43 - Click on the plus icon.
06:45 - Drop shadow blur is ten
06:48 - and the Alpha is on ten or
the transparency step can also reduce
06:53 - that to plenty if you
like that's looking good.
06:58 - Also the tax is a little bit harsh.
07:00 - Let's convert this to regular
and size for clean.
07:04 - Now
07:06 - next is we'll create a tip or a hint or
instruction below this input stroke.
07:12 - So
07:14 - press the plus icon,
07:19 - crack multiple acres or multiple items.
07:28 - Just trace that below the input filled and
adjust the color.
07:36 - Or maybe something like Gray
07:39 - or let's say something like this.
07:45 - I like that.
07:46 - That's a lot better.
07:48 - Enter a tracking number.
07:49 - Let's change this to one of our colors.
07:51 - Colors, colors.
07:53 - You can choose whatever color you're like,
but for this instance we'll be using
07:56 - colors color in blue and then same
goes for our input place holder.
08:03 - It will be on the like wrap.
08:06 - I
08:07 - think.
08:09 - I think the drop shadow is a little bit
08:11 - harsh still, so let's
just make this to five.
08:13 - All right to fill out better.
08:16 - If you want to adjust the gap between
these two items, just click on one,
08:21 - then hold Swift, click on another
one and then this is the app.
08:26 - Between them are the margins between
them so you can just them if you like.
08:31 - I would say twelve or 14 or 16.
08:33 - Lot better.
08:36 - Let's make sure that this is also 16.
08:38 - I
08:40 - have equal spacing
between those three API.
08:44 - The next item on our list
is the track button.
08:46 - So
08:48 - to create a button,
08:49 - just type in track type in the text first
and then press Swift A and were that all
08:56 - the layout, then make sure that this is
08:58 - 32 to 16 and 1616 on top and volume and 32
09:06 - on left and right and then convert
the fill press on file present plus, then
09:13 - select the Cosmos Chris Blue and then
09:16 - change the color of that
text and to pure white.
09:21 - That's good enough contrast and change
the font intensity to both right.
09:29 - And also.
09:30 - I think I want to change
the corner radius of this.
09:34 - So if you click on this and select corner
09:37 - radius type in four,
make it a little bit rounder.
09:41 - That's it.
09:43 - Then I think we should just make the same
09:48 - with as the input code so as
you can see it's still funky.
09:53 - It's not placed in the middle.
09:55 - So what you're going to do is just click
on this frame or this button and just
10:00 - click on make sure it's horizontally
and vertically centered, right?
10:05 - Just like that.
10:07 - So select all its heart.
10:10 - It's aligned properly and that's it.
10:14 - I think we have a very clean,
very modern looking UI for the homepage.
10:19 - By the way, one last thing is to change
10:21 - this color to blue, make sure that it's
consistent across the screen.
10:27 - And also we forgot to add an icon here.
10:30 - So if you want icons
10:35 - here, you have the path icon here already.
10:38 - You just type in like
that and place it here.
10:42 - So this is the beauty of auto layout,
because if you drag something inside,
10:46 - that all the layout to automatically fit
the item within it for you where you don't
10:51 - have to worry about limitations
and all those things.
10:53 - So click on the frame the parent frame,
and then click on space between and that's
11:00 - it and make sure that they are
horizontally or vertically centered.
11:04 - And then
11:07 - let's adjust the colors of this
to something like the Cognis.
11:12 - Chris blue.
Alright, that's a lot better.
11:15 - Maybe 24.
11:17 - Alright, that's a lot better.
11:19 - Api so we are done
designing our home page.
11:22 - Next thing we want to do is
to design that results page.
11:24 - So what we're going to do next is
just to duplicate this homepage.
11:28 - You can press command and so
command C and command V.
11:32 - Just copy paste the frame and rename
11:36 - the still results and just
delete some items here.
11:43 - And let's just keep this menu icon
because we'll be using that later.
11:48 - So next thing we want to do is to
implement that.
11:53 - Previous icon or back icon.
11:55 - So go back to our icons a plug in
11:58 - and then press or look for back
icon or left arrow stuff like that.
12:04 - I think that's good.
It's good.
12:06 - I think this one's closest.
12:08 - Alright, so
12:10 - let's change this to 32.
12:12 - So by the way, make sure the constraint
proportions is on because you want them
12:16 - to be in the same with same
height all the time.
12:19 - So go to selection colors,
make sure that it's blue again.
12:24 - Alright.
So now that we have this two icons,
12:28 - you want to make sure that they
are in the same role.
12:31 - Right.
12:31 - So the either way is to place them just
something like this and you're done.
12:36 - But the more efficient or I'd say a bit
more advanced thing to do is to select
12:41 - them both and then press Swift A and now
you have them both in an OTT layout.
12:47 - So when you press Swift A,
they are now grouped together.
12:51 - But more importantly they are within.
12:53 - They are not positioned
within a container.
12:55 - So that makes them responsive
when this device is showed up or down.
13:01 - So make sure that this is zero
and this is space between
13:08 - snap this on the left
and snap this to the right.
13:11 - So
13:12 - there is a lot better compared to what we
13:14 - did a while ago because when you scale
this down to a smaller screen,
13:18 - for example, then the icons
will adapt to that size.
13:22 - So this is like one of the
benefits of auto layout.
13:24 - If you learn auto layout the Xcode,
this is basically the same thing.
13:28 - By the way, we need to make sure that our
13:31 - menu items are at least
44 pixels from the top.
13:35 - So just set this to 44
and you're good to go.
13:37 - It's Apple that here as well.
13:40 - Orfor so.
13:42 - The reason for this is because we need
to consider the notch on the iphone
13:47 - and that notch will take up at least I
think 20 pixels of screen real estate.
13:53 - So yeah, that's why we put
it 44 pixels from the top.
13:58 - Alright.
13:59 - So the next thing we need to do is
to write that
14:03 - subtitle like you are currently tracking
the senses, the results screen.
14:09 - We need to make sure that they are
a the users tracking whatever number.
14:13 - So
14:15 - duplicate list copy paste
14:17 - and then random number something like that
and then estimated
14:27 - the date of delivery.
14:31 - Let's say September 3021.
14:35 - Now that's too big.
14:36 - So let's just set the font regular,
14:39 - then 14 and then this one you can keep it
to 24, reduce the kerning and then
14:48 - place auto they are currently
tracking is list 16.
14:52 - I'm bald and auto and then fill.
15:00 - Let's hide the grid.
15:01 - For now you are currently tracking
15:05 - and let's change the color
of this number to blue,
15:11 - change the color of this
to something like I
15:17 - think Gray is good.
15:18 - Alright, so API auto as well.
15:24 - Narrow or maybe
15:31 - and then set this to regular.
15:34 - We need to make sure
that this is also in Gray.
15:39 - Alright, we're currently tracking.
15:41 - Let's get this back end board,
15:43 - make sure that the gap between this
tree are divisible by four as well.
15:48 - So maybe four as well.
15:49 - That's good.
15:51 - Alright, alright.
15:52 - So this is the fun part.
15:53 - So this is the results page
or the tracking information.
15:57 - So as you can see, we have the date,
the time and the status of that order.
16:02 - Do that here date September 6
and 21 and then time the 50.
16:11 - 04:00 p.m. And then we want to make sure
16:14 - that we're using military time so that we
can avoid using Am and PM in the text.
16:20 - It also saves us from some space.
16:22 - Twelve next is
16:26 - essential for pickup
16:31 - and then
16:36 - that's right.
16:37 - Yeah, and the crew of that.
16:40 - Alright, so they are all booked together.
16:43 - Now what we want to do is to make sure
that scheduled for pickup is highlight,
16:49 - make sure that it's 18 or maybe 16
and the date and time are less empathize.
16:58 - Maybe twelve
17:00 - Bolt or maybe just keep it to twelve.
17:03 - App them to Gray and schedule
for pick up is also in Gray.
17:10 - My name.
17:15 - Alright, that's better.
17:18 - Now let's also add circle
17:24 - which will serve as an indicator of this.
17:27 - Then I like that.
17:31 - Make sure that it's aligned.
17:32 - Control G
17:35 - my brains are not showing because it's
17:38 - the eye is turned off to make sure
that everything is aligned to the left.
17:43 - Alright.
So now that we have this indicator,
17:46 - next thing we want to do is to just
group them and then duplicate them.
17:50 - Hold option and drag all option drag, all
option drag and make sure that they are
17:57 - evenly spaced
18:00 - and all aligns to left.
18:03 - So once they're evenly space,
18:05 - click on this margin and make sure
that they are divisible by four again.
18:10 - So in terms of at least 16 or maybe
if it's too tight and make it 24,
18:18 - that's cleaner.
18:19 - Alright, next thing we want
to do to change the text here.
18:24 - So schedule for pick up next is
pick up my career.
18:31 - Next is departed.
18:34 - The shipping failed
18:38 - and arrived at shipping facility
18:44 - September 29, September 28 and September
18:47 - 27 and maybe 19 it's for there's time for
19:00 - and doesn't really matter.
19:05 - This is just a template anyway.
19:06 - All right.
19:07 - So we're almost done with our design.
19:09 - I think we're 90% on.
One.
19:11 - Last thing is to design that filter
which contains the recipient details.
19:16 - So let's just Press F or our frame tool
19:19 - and then drag it here
and then add the clean white color
19:25 - hide grid because the disturbing
and then just type in recent details
19:35 - and then under one is
the name on their accent.
19:41 - So I'd say Chander bang and then
the dress of that receiver is 15.
19:48 - Yes, even with the contact number of I say
19:55 - 123-4582, two and four, five six.
20:01 - That's just a random number.
20:03 - And then we need to make sure that they
are aligned evenly distributed.
20:09 - And now let's make the
font adjustment ments from here.
20:14 - So 24 or maybe 18 Bolt auto
20:20 - and I
20:23 - think that's cool.
20:24 - I don't think we should change that.
Alright.
20:28 - Chandler Bing 14 is okay,
but I want to change the color of this
20:34 - the Gray again because I don't
like using plain black and our UI
20:40 - great wine is okay, change it to blue
20:50 - and there we go.
20:52 - We now have that UI.
20:55 - Now if you want to be a little more
20:58 - advanced, just a little,
you can press shift a and that converts
21:03 - them into another layout
and drag this container right here
21:08 - and name this container
data rate and drag this
21:13 - to something like this.
21:16 - So drag this from edge to edge
21:19 - and set the padding API 20 and then
20 again and then 24 a 74.
21:28 - So now you can do it just like that.
21:34 - Oh, by the way, we forgot to change
the color of this to blue.
21:41 - Alright, so where are done?
21:44 - One last thing is to copy
this button right here.
21:47 - Select the frame results frame and then
21:49 - paste track, then
just drop it below this container.
21:55 - And now you have the track button.
21:57 - And if they want to track in art,
22:00 - there's a dedicated button just for that.
22:03 - Alright, so we're almost done.
22:05 - We just need to do one last thing.
22:07 - So I promise is the one last thing.
22:09 - So you can notice
22:12 - there's a lot of space here.
22:14 - So we don't want to waste
that screen real state.
22:16 - So you just need to make sure to drag
this like that and then place it
22:23 - API, maybe 1234 for the pixels
below that navigation was done.
22:32 - Click on this.
22:37 - And now that's an evenly space out
22:39 - with you properly utilizing
the screen real estate of the iphone.
22:43 - And if you click on Present, this is what
it would look like on an actual phone.
22:48 - So when you enter your tracking number
22:50 - here contract and then you'll be
redirected to that results page.
22:56 - All right, so that's how you create a very
22:58 - clean, simple, modern and goodlooking
delivery tracker app in Figma.
23:02 - I hope you found this tutorial very useful
because creating goodlooking you eyes
23:06 - doesn't really require a lot of creative
thinking as others think it would.
23:09 - All it needs is an understanding
of the users behavior so that you can
23:13 - design and build an app that will
surely make them happy.
23:15 - If you remember a while ago I introduced
you to powerful Figma features such as
23:20 - other layout that lets you
design components responsibly.
23:23 - If you want to learn more about auto
layout in Figma, then make sure to head
23:28 - over our website and enroll in our CWC
press program because we will be releasing
23:31 - an exclusive that'snot about
auto layout very soon.
23:34 - And if you want to learn more about
designing Enigma or iOS app design,
23:37 - you should check out our iOS design course
that's also exclusively on Cwt Plus.
23:42 - As always.
23:43 - Thank you so much for watching
and we'll see you in the next video.
