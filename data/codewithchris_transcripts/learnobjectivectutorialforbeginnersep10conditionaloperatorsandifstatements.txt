00:08 - hey guys welcome to another episode of
00:11 - code with Chris and today we're going to
00:13 - be talking about conditional operators
00:15 - within if statements so we're going to
00:17 - expand on what you learned in the last
00:20 - video about if statements alright let's
00:22 - get started okay so in the last video we
00:27 - talked about if statements and in this
00:31 - video i wanted to show you some more
00:33 - examples of different kinds of if
00:35 - statements using conditional operators
00:37 - now you can download this Xcode project
00:39 - from the annotation on the screen that
00:41 - you see right now or in the link below
00:43 - so what are conditional operators for
00:46 - example if you know once again I have
00:49 - the age variable and let's say I wanted
00:54 - to have a condition where I wanted to do
00:57 - something if the age was 5 or 10 now I
01:00 - could do something like if h is equal to
01:05 - 0 then do something and then down here I
01:12 - could have something like this do
01:17 - something and what would happen here is
01:20 - first it would run through this if
01:23 - statement and if it you know if it
01:25 - equals 0 do this if it wasn't to equal
01:29 - to 0 then I would check if it was equal
01:31 - to 10 now this would be the worst way to
01:34 - write it I could instead use the else if
01:37 - like we learned last time so first they
01:39 - would check if it equals to 0 if it if
01:41 - it's not then it would filter down here
01:44 - but what I meant to actually say was do
01:46 - something do same do the same code the
01:51 - better way to write this would be
01:52 - something like this if age is equal to 0
01:55 - or h is equal to 10 do something because
02:02 - I'm intending to do the same code in
02:06 - both branches I can use these two pipes
02:09 - as an or claws too
02:13 - chained together to conditions so this
02:15 - reads if age is 0 or 10 you can also do
02:22 - conditions on multiple variables so
02:25 - let's say I have you know I have another
02:29 - variable called brothers age I could do
02:32 - something like you know what i want to
02:34 - write is if if age is zero and brothers
02:41 - age is 10 then it would become something
02:45 - like this that two ampersand signs
02:56 - together equates to an end clause let me
03:01 - just highlight those for you and here is
03:06 - an example of checking against two
03:08 - variables now you can get even more
03:11 - complicated and chained together various
03:14 - ends or ores and do something like you
03:20 - know if age is five and brothers age is
03:26 - five or age is six and brothers age is
03:38 - seven now let's make it clear here I
03:41 - want to execute some sort of code if
03:43 - either this part is true if ages five
03:48 - and brothers ages 5 or if this is true
03:53 - age of six and brothers age of seven so
03:56 - you would first start off by writing
03:59 - something like this
04:04 - now that's the first condition now you
04:07 - put it in it in its own set of brackets
04:09 - and that basically groups those two
04:13 - things together and now the other two
04:15 - condition sorry the other condition is
04:18 - if age is six and whether eight mother's
04:31 - age of seven
04:38 - this code will get executed if either
04:41 - this condition is true or this condition
04:46 - is true so there you have it with the
04:50 - conditional and boolean operators your
04:52 - code can now make decisions that's
04:54 - pretty exciting so until next time talk
04:58 - to you guys later bye
05:04 - you
05:12 - you
