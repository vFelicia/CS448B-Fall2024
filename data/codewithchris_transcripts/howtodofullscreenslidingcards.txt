00:00 - hey cuckoo how's it going in today's
00:02 - lesson I'm gonna show you how to do
00:03 - something like this yeah so typically
00:10 - used in welcome screens onboarding
00:12 - sequences Wizards and stuff like that
00:15 - and you won't believe how easy it is to
00:17 - do so let's jump into Xcode right now
00:18 - and do it together all right so we're
00:21 - gonna get started with a brand new Xcode
00:23 - project go ahead and start one I'm
00:26 - really liking the dark mode of this
00:27 - Xcode 10 under iOS let's choose single
00:31 - view app and for the project name I'm
00:34 - just gonna call it our slides demo and
00:37 - I'm gonna save it on the desktop here
00:40 - alright so first things first I
00:42 - downloaded some images from pixels comm
00:45 - and you can grab some too for your
00:48 - slides or you can use any one I'm just
00:51 - gonna drag them in here and these are
00:52 - the images that we're going to show in
00:54 - our fullscreen slides now let's dive
00:57 - into the storyboard the first thing
00:59 - we're gonna do is add a scroll view to
01:02 - our view so let's do that and we're
01:09 - going to add constraints for all four
01:12 - edges now I want it to be a full screen
01:14 - experience and I want the image to go
01:16 - underneath the knotch
01:17 - and so I'm going to uncheck constraint
01:20 - margins and I'm gonna make these
01:21 - constraints all relative to the view
01:24 - rather than the safe area because the
01:26 - safe area doesn't go underneath the
01:29 - knotch
01:31 - all right so let's do that so we've got
01:33 - our scroll view here next we're gonna
01:35 - add four image views inside that scroll
01:37 - view now before I do that I just want to
01:40 - show you a little diagram about how
01:42 - these image views will be positioned in
01:45 - terms of the auto layout constraints
01:47 - because as I'm doing it if you're not
01:49 - sure what's going on it might be a
01:50 - little bit confusing so all of the UI
01:53 - image views will be zero margin at the
01:56 - top and zero margin at the bottom to
01:58 - ensure that it's a full screen
01:59 - experience the first image view on the
02:02 - left however it's gonna have a left
02:05 - constraint that's zero to the scroll
02:08 - view and then the second UI image view
02:10 - I'm going to set its left side
02:12 - constraint
02:13 - to the right-side constraint of the
02:15 - first image view so it's going to sit to
02:17 - the right side of it and then for the
02:19 - third image view I'm going to set that
02:21 - guy's left side constraint equal to the
02:24 - right side of the second image view and
02:26 - then lastly for the fourth one I'm going
02:28 - to set the left constraint equal to the
02:30 - right side of the third image view but
02:34 - however for the last UI image view
02:36 - that's the rightmost one we're going to
02:39 - also make it zero constraint to the
02:42 - scroll view on the right hand side so
02:44 - that is gonna allow the scroll view to
02:46 - calculate and know how wide its content
02:51 - is and so it can scroll because
02:53 - otherwise it doesn't know how far it can
02:55 - scroll so that's why it's very important
02:58 - for the leftmost and the rightmost image
03:01 - views to have those left and right
03:03 - constraints relative to the scroll view
03:06 - all right so now you understand what
03:08 - we're gonna do let's get started
03:10 - so I'm gonna press command shift + L to
03:12 - bring this guy up and we are going to
03:16 - add the image view and just in case you
03:19 - didn't catch that
03:20 - that was the shortcut for this guy you
03:23 - can also just click this button if you
03:24 - want alright this is our first image
03:27 - view so we are going to specify
03:28 - constraints top bottom and left and all
03:33 - of these will be relative to the scroll
03:35 - view anyways but you can double check
03:36 - because this image view should be
03:38 - sitting inside the scroll view so make
03:41 - sure of that
03:42 - oops I didn't want to add this right
03:44 - side one be careful not to do that so
03:46 - just top bottom and left all right it's
03:50 - also going to complain now because we
03:53 - have to add some height and width
03:55 - constraints to the image view I forgot
03:57 - to specify that but all of these image
03:59 - views are going to have the same height
04:01 - and width as the scroll view that's
04:03 - what's going to make them like a full
04:05 - screen card so hold down control click
04:08 - your image view drag it to the scroll
04:11 - view let go and then you can select
04:14 - equal widths and equal Heights
04:16 - however once you click 1 the menus gonna
04:18 - disappear so if you want to select
04:20 - multiple just hold down command on your
04:22 - keyboard and it'll allow you to select
04:24 - multiple like that another way you could
04:26 - do it is
04:27 - just to have both elements highlighted
04:29 - by holding the shift' and selecting both
04:32 - them with your mouths and then you can
04:34 - come into this menu and just choose
04:36 - equal it's an equalize so both are good
04:39 - options you're gonna see some auto
04:41 - layout errors right now because it's
04:44 - saying that the scroll view doesn't know
04:46 - how wide its content is but of course
04:49 - that's totally expected because we
04:50 - haven't added all of our image views yet
04:54 - and it's gonna be that rightmost one
04:55 - which is kind of gonna close that or
04:59 - have that rightmost constraint so that
05:01 - the scroll view can calculate the total
05:05 - width all right so for this image view
05:08 - let's set some of its attributes for the
05:10 - image I'm going to choose the first one
05:12 - and we're going to do aspect fill for
05:16 - the content mode and we're gonna choose
05:18 - clip to bounds as well and that's just
05:21 - going to allow the image not to overflow
05:23 - the balance of the image view I'm going
05:27 - to just press command D to duplicate
05:30 - this guy and I'm gonna drag it inside
05:33 - the scroll view and change the image to
05:36 - two these are fine now we're going to
05:40 - set some constraints so you know the top
05:43 - and the bottom are going to be zero
05:45 - relative the scroll view however this
05:48 - one this left one is going to be zero
05:51 - relative to the first image view right
05:54 - it's gonna be zero to the right edge of
05:57 - the first image view the only problem is
06:00 - in this menu right here you can't find
06:03 - the first image view because both of
06:05 - them are overlapping and in order for
06:07 - you to see the first image view here in
06:11 - this menu you have to move the second
06:13 - image view so that it's not overlapping
06:15 - with the first one it's kind of hard to
06:18 - drag it out right now so what I'm gonna
06:20 - do is just leave it relative to the
06:22 - scroll view right now but I'm gonna edit
06:25 - that left-side constraint after it's
06:28 - added so let's go ahead and add these
06:30 - three constraints I know this left one
06:32 - is relative to the scroll view which is
06:34 - not what we want but we'll edit it so
06:37 - let's select this second image view go
06:40 - into the size and
06:40 - Specter and for this leading space
06:43 - constraint if you double-click it it's
06:45 - gonna let you edit it so you can see
06:48 - that the leading constraint for the
06:50 - second image view we're gonna change it
06:52 - it is going to be relative to image view
06:54 - number one and also the trailing side of
06:59 - it so when you do that you're gonna see
07:02 - that the second image view is right here
07:07 - oh and also it's like super wide right
07:10 - now because we didn't set equal Heights
07:14 - and widths for the second image view so
07:17 - we have to do that so all the image
07:20 - views need to be equal height and width
07:22 - to the scroll view all right let's
07:25 - duplicate this again let's drag it here
07:28 - let's change the image to the third one
07:32 - did it do it okay and this time I'm
07:35 - going to add the height and width
07:36 - constraints first like that and so like
07:44 - that boom boom boom top is scroll view
07:49 - bottom a scroll view left is also scroll
07:51 - view but again we're gonna edit it after
07:55 - the fact so let's click that leading
07:59 - constraint so the leading edge of the
08:03 - third image view should be the same as
08:05 - the trailing edge of the second image
08:09 - view and take note of this constant
08:12 - right this should be zero but sometimes
08:14 - it defaults to a number based on
08:17 - whatever position it is right then then
08:19 - there in the storyboard but you want to
08:21 - make sure that there's zero offset
08:23 - because you want the leading edge equal
08:26 - to the trailing edge so that they're
08:28 - side-by-side alright so we've got one
08:31 - two and three we're gonna do the fourth
08:34 - one now this one's going to be the
08:35 - tricky one because we have to specify a
08:37 - right side constraint all right so let's
08:39 - go image for this is the prettiest
08:44 - picture in my opinion alright so we're
08:47 - gonna add constraints for this guy
08:49 - it'll be zeros all around
08:53 - scrollview bottom a scrollview right
08:56 - side ah this side now we have some
08:59 - choices right make sure you choose
09:01 - scroll view okay so this right side is
09:04 - zero to the scroll view because that's
09:05 - going to cap things off and allow the
09:07 - scroll view to calculate the total width
09:08 - left side is still scroll view but we're
09:12 - gonna change this so it's relative to
09:13 - the third image view alright so we add
09:16 - those four constraints and again we
09:18 - forgot to add the height and width so
09:20 - let's hold down control drag this guy
09:23 - equal Heights and widths alright and
09:26 - then size inspector of the fourth one
09:30 - double-click the leading constraint so
09:33 - the leading edge of image view 4 should
09:36 - be equal to the trailing edge of number
09:39 - three and this constant this is crazy
09:44 - number we're gonna change it to zero so
09:47 - now everything is neat and tidy what do
09:48 - we have we have one one two three and
09:56 - four all right so why don't we just run
10:01 - our demo right now just to make sure
10:03 - it's Scrolls you can see that there
10:04 - aren't any auto layout constraint errors
10:08 - let me just bring this simulator here if
10:10 - we could drag this guy okay so here we
10:13 - go see it's scrolling but this is like
10:16 - smooth scrolling right it's not
10:17 - scrolling slide by slide and the way you
10:21 - do that is if you hold your sorry if you
10:24 - click your scroll view and you enable
10:28 - paging that's gonna have that behavior
10:30 - where your scrolling slide by slide so
10:33 - let's enable paging and try this again
10:37 - so you can see now it looks like you
10:40 - know pages you're scrolling through
10:42 - pages of something which is what we want
10:44 - the last thing we want to do is just add
10:46 - those paging dots that you see a lot in
10:51 - onboarding and welcome sequences and
10:54 - it's a great idea because it allows the
10:56 - user to see at a glance how many pages
10:59 - are available for them to scroll through
11:02 - so in order to do that
11:05 - yeah we have to add another control it's
11:09 - called the page control and this guy we
11:12 - are actually going to add it no we're
11:15 - not adding it into the scroll view or
11:17 - adding it outside because it's kind of
11:19 - sit on top as of now though it's sitting
11:22 - behind the scroll view so we are just
11:25 - going to close the scroll view like this
11:26 - and we're going to drag the scroll view
11:30 - below it I know it's kind of
11:32 - counterintuitive but the closer the
11:35 - element is to this root view the more
11:38 - behind it is so the page view is
11:41 - actually in front of the scroll view
11:42 - right now okay so what we're gonna do
11:46 - you can see it's sitting right there in
11:48 - the middle we're gonna have some
11:50 - constraints to that guy so let's
11:52 - horizontally Center it in the container
11:54 - and then we're going to make it like 20
11:59 - from the bottom I'm gonna leave all of
12:02 - the margins as is so it's gonna sit
12:05 - right there it's kind of hard to see
12:06 - unfortunately we can change the colors
12:10 - again it kind of depends on the slides
12:12 - you can add some sort of background or
12:15 - change the tint color for some sort of
12:17 - treatment if you want but I'm gonna
12:20 - leave it as is
12:21 - okay so the question is how do we update
12:26 - because it's not going to update out in
12:28 - its own just because you added the page
12:29 - control how are we gonna update the
12:31 - current page well first of all we have
12:33 - to detect what page were on in the
12:36 - scroll view and for that we're going to
12:37 - have to do some calculation because this
12:40 - scroll view has a property called
12:42 - offset or content offset on the x-axis
12:45 - so you can detect basically how far
12:50 - you've scrolled or how far the user has
12:53 - scrolled inside that scroll view so on
12:56 - the first slide the offset would be zero
12:58 - let me just show you that again so right
13:01 - now the offset would be zero the width
13:03 - of this is 375 so if the user Scrolls to
13:07 - the second screen the offsets going to
13:09 - be 375 and if they scroll to the third
13:12 - screen it's going to be like 375 plus
13:14 - 375 which is 750 yeah to be 750
13:19 - order to calculate what page were at all
13:22 - we need to do is take that offset and
13:25 - divide by 375 so this would be page zero
13:28 - right at this point it would be 375
13:31 - divided by 375 would just give us one so
13:34 - that's page one and then this would give
13:36 - us page two and the last page would give
13:39 - us page three and we would simply use
13:42 - that number after we calculate that page
13:44 - index we would use that number and set a
13:48 - property on the page control called
13:50 - current page now that property just
13:53 - basically changes which dot is
13:54 - highlighted or we got to change the
13:56 - number of pages to four pages actually
13:58 - so there's four dots and the current
14:01 - page it's gonna start at zero and that's
14:02 - fine all right so let's let me show you
14:06 - how to do what I just described let's go
14:10 - into assistant editor and we're gonna
14:11 - hook up some of these elements to our
14:13 - code so that we can actually perform
14:17 - these calculations so we're gonna add
14:19 - the scroll view and if you're unfamiliar
14:25 - with how I'm adding these as outlets you
14:27 - can check out this video actually watch
14:29 - my beginner series because I talk about
14:31 - how we're doing this assistant editor
14:34 - just shows you the storyboard with the
14:36 - code behind for this view controller but
14:39 - this is all stuff you'll learn in my
14:41 - basic series if you haven't gone through
14:42 - that yet so I'm not gonna spend that
14:45 - much time talking about that right here
14:48 - in this video
14:51 - so first let's hook up the scroll view
14:54 - so that the view controller can detect
14:56 - that content offset and those like
14:58 - scrolling events of the scroll view and
15:01 - the scroll he talks to the view
15:02 - controller through its protocol you
15:05 - don't know what that is again I've got a
15:07 - video and a series on that so you can
15:09 - check it out in the video card in the
15:11 - upper right hand corner right now
15:13 - alright so wait we're going to do this
15:16 - is I'm gonna create an extension for
15:19 - this view controller and we are going to
15:21 - conform to the UI scroll view delegate
15:25 - here and before we handle any of its
15:29 - methods let's don't forget I always
15:32 - forget this part
15:33 - actually is to specify that the
15:35 - viewcontroller is the delegate for the
15:39 - scrollview so after we do that the
15:42 - scrollview is going to report to the
15:44 - view controller
15:45 - whenever scrolling is happening
15:49 - so there is a delegate method called did
15:52 - scroll and in here we can calculate the
15:58 - page index so let page index equals the
16:04 - scroll view dot con is an offset or
16:09 - content offset there we go
16:10 - content offset and this is a CG point so
16:13 - there's an x and a y we're interested in
16:15 - the X we're just gonna divide this by
16:20 - 375 and we're going to round this to an
16:24 - int just convert it to int and that's
16:28 - going to round things and then we're
16:29 - going to set the page control we're
16:33 - going to set the current page property
16:34 - to the page index so let's take a look
16:42 - at this and see if it works
16:45 - hope I'm not missing anything
16:52 - all right so yeah you can see the dot
16:55 - updating damn some of these dots are
16:58 - really hard to see but I think you can
17:01 - use a different tint color
17:02 - she'd like again if you want the source
17:07 - code you'll find it in the description
17:08 - below
