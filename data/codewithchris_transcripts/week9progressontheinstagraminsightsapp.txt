00:01 - [Music]
00:05 - hey it's chris here wanted to give you a
00:07 - quick update on the state of the app
00:10 - so i think we're really really close
00:12 - we're just working out some
00:14 - uh some of the bugs which i'll point out
00:15 - for you uh so this is a fresh launch of
00:18 - the app
00:18 - this is the uh the onboarding sequence
00:22 - please note that we do have you know
00:24 - some little um
00:26 - graphical uh glitches still to work out
00:29 - so as you see that dimmed screen is not
00:32 - uh
00:32 - full screen which will work out so
00:35 - we have our three-step on-boarding
00:37 - process like i've showed you before
00:39 - what we've added is this little notice
00:42 - here that
00:44 - this is a sample profile so when they
00:46 - look at this this is not a real profile
00:48 - right
00:50 - some of the things which we need to work
00:52 - out are
00:54 - right now tapping on these or tapping
00:57 - and holding on these
00:58 - don't pop up the tooltip for the dummy
01:01 - profile
01:02 - which you know we want to show people
01:04 - what this metric is about when they tap
01:06 - and hold on to it
01:07 - the other thing is that videos aren't
01:10 - showing up
01:11 - uh it's more actually it's more like in
01:13 - the data
01:14 - that comes back we haven't handled the
01:17 - video case
01:18 - just yet so we're gonna find a way to
01:21 - handle that gracefully
01:23 - uh and yeah so this is the unlogged in
01:26 - state
01:26 - so people are going to launch the app go
01:28 - through that three-step
01:30 - you know little mini tutorial they're
01:32 - going to be able to play around with the
01:33 - sample profile
01:34 - we added this because we sent this to
01:38 - our team to test and
01:39 - they were confused when after they went
01:42 - through that three-step onboarding
01:43 - process and they got dropped here
01:44 - they were confused as to what this was
01:46 - there's like a lot of information here
01:47 - and i
01:48 - i sort of agree if more people give us
01:50 - that feedback we might just
01:53 - do three step onboarding and then like
01:55 - direct to call to action to log in
01:58 - but right now as it stands you get to
02:00 - play around with the profile a little
02:02 - bit and then
02:02 - it tells you to click on the list tab to
02:05 - log
02:05 - in so when you come here uh we'll have
02:08 - instructions
02:09 - as to you know what you have to do go
02:11 - ahead and click login
02:13 - and then let me go ahead and log in
02:16 - all right so it's gonna let me log in
02:20 - and because i've selected you know which
02:23 - instagram account i wanted to use
02:24 - already
02:25 - um that's already all set up oops oh man
02:28 - i cancelled the sign in process
02:30 - accidentally okay i'm gonna hit continue
02:32 - as chris ching
02:33 - it's gonna come in again this is one of
02:35 - those visual glitches we definitely want
02:37 - this to be
02:38 - full screen blue uh we're gonna click
02:40 - not now and we've also decided
02:42 - just in the interest of time um
02:45 - we are gonna ignore premium now so we're
02:48 - not even gonna bring that up we're not
02:49 - going to talk about that and we're going
02:50 - to launch it without premium
02:52 - so it'll be no monetization then we'll
02:54 - add it in a
02:55 - next update so this screen probably
02:58 - won't make it into the launch
02:59 - okay so they're going to see this feed
03:01 - you're not following anyone yet
03:03 - then they're going to add someone like
03:06 - for example
03:07 - myself or maybe i'll just do maybe i'll
03:10 - do apple
03:11 - just switch it up okay so there's apple
03:15 - and we've styled the screen a little bit
03:16 - you can see the tabs
03:18 - still need a little bit of work in terms
03:20 - of how they
03:21 - look we have the blue dot but the blue
03:23 - dots have cut off and
03:25 - the icon is touching the edge there
03:28 - and when they tap into apple they can
03:31 - see some of apple's
03:32 - stats right there when you
03:36 - tap that you can bring up that again the
03:38 - dim screen is not
03:40 - fully to the edges
03:44 - and uh
03:48 - yeah the setting screen we don't really
03:50 - have much here except the log
03:51 - out and this premium stuff we're gonna
03:53 - hide this tab altogether
03:54 - so that's how the app looks right now
03:56 - i'd say like we're really close to just
03:59 - launching
04:00 - and things will become a lot clearer a
04:03 - lot more clear after we launch right
04:04 - after people start using it in the app
04:06 - store
04:09 - and giving us feedback i think
04:12 - a lot of the guesswork that we've done
04:16 - will confirm or
04:20 - deny you know we might have to rework
04:23 - some things
04:23 - maybe the flow isn't um isn't intuitive
04:28 - something like that so we'll we'll
04:30 - figure it out but i really want to get
04:32 - this to launch first
04:33 - um that way we can work on some of the
04:35 - marketing stuff
04:37 - um and we can also work on some of the
04:40 - feedback that comes back and we'll
04:41 - definitely
04:42 - i definitely want to monetize the app
04:45 - just so i can get some experience with
04:47 - um what that is like put
04:50 - the revenue cat stuff into production
04:53 - and that would be good i'm really
04:55 - looking forward to that um and i also
04:57 - already
04:58 - have some ideas for the next apps that i
05:01 - want to do
05:02 - so i'm you know this experience this
05:04 - case study has been really good in the
05:06 - sense that
05:07 - it's sort of opened the floodgates for
05:09 - my imagination
05:10 - now i want to build more apps and we're
05:12 - going to continue doing these case
05:13 - studies
05:14 - so that you can sort of get a
05:15 - behind-the-scenes real look at
05:18 - what this process is like and as we do
05:20 - it more i think
05:22 - the process is going to get more refined
05:24 - right we're going to understand
05:26 - uh how best to do it and i'll update the
05:28 - product framework with
05:30 - our process as it solidifies anyways
05:33 - hope you're enjoying it so far
05:34 - thanks for um being a supporter thanks
05:36 - for watching and following along i'll
05:38 - see you in the next video
