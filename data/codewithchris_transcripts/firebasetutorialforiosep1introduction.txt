00:04 - hello what's up it's Chris here and
00:07 - welcome to the new firebase video series
00:10 - just a quick note if you don't know what
00:12 - it is firebase is a platform that's
00:14 - going to allow us to add database
00:15 - capabilities to our app pretty easily
00:17 - but more than that it can also provide
00:20 - other features a lot more actually in
00:22 - terms of analytics monetization storage
00:25 - authentication and a lot more to get the
00:28 - full list just go to firebase Google com
00:30 - and on the home page they list out all
00:32 - of their features another thing I want
00:34 - to mention before we get started is that
00:36 - this video series isn't intended for the
00:39 - complete beginner so if you just started
00:41 - out and you haven't built any apps yet I
00:43 - would recommend you to check out my
00:45 - beginner series instead that's designed
00:47 - for the complete beginner otherwise I'm
00:50 - going to be talking about and doing a
00:52 - lot of things that might go over your
00:54 - head and it might not make a lot of
00:55 - sense okay so over the next few videos
00:58 - or so I'm going to show you how to
01:00 - create your first firebase app how are
01:03 - you going to connect it to your Xcode
01:04 - project how the data is structured in
01:07 - the database and how to save how to save
01:11 - data how to retrieve data and in the
01:14 - process we're going to build something
01:16 - like this together I hesitate to call it
01:18 - a chat app because there really is much
01:21 - more to a chat app this is sort of just
01:24 - the messages app where anyone who is
01:26 - going to launch the app is going to be
01:28 - able to compose a new message and
01:30 - they're going to be able to type some
01:33 - text and want to type garbage here but
01:37 - let's just say hello YouTube and add it
01:43 - and you can see that instantly it's
01:46 - reflected in the database so you're
01:47 - going to be building something like this
01:49 - in the process of learning all of that
01:51 - cool stuff all right I'm really excited
01:53 - to be doing this for you because adding
01:55 - database features to an app is one of
01:58 - the most requested things by you guys
02:00 - and with firebase it's actually not very
02:03 - hard at all so thanks for watching and
02:05 - I'll talk to you soon bye for now
02:08 - you
