00:02 - hey coders what's up I hope you guys are
00:05 - having a great week so far
00:06 - Chris here and in this lesson I'm going
00:09 - to show you guys how to set up and
00:11 - install cocoa pods now if you don't know
00:13 - what cocoa pods is or you've never used
00:15 - it then this video is for you because
00:17 - cocoa pods allows you to manage and use
00:19 - third-party code in your Xcode project
00:21 - and it's widely used by anyone who is
00:23 - building apps right now even the large
00:25 - companies who are building the big-name
00:26 - apps so in this lesson you will learn
00:28 - how to install and set it up and you're
00:30 - only going to have to do this once and
00:31 - then over the next few days I'll show
00:33 - you guys some of the must-haves
00:34 - third-party libraries for those of you
00:37 - guys who have used cocoa pods before let
00:39 - me know in the comments section what
00:40 - your favorite libraries are and then
00:42 - maybe in the future I can even cover it
00:44 - for everyone here so originally I showed
00:46 - how to set up cocoa pods in a video in
00:49 - the shopping app series but it's buried
00:51 - inside that video I really want to pull
00:53 - it out and draw attention to it because
00:54 - it's really important and useful for
00:56 - anybody who's doing app development so
00:59 - this is that video first of all let's
01:01 - install cocoa pods you're in luck
01:03 - because I just got a brand-new shiny
01:04 - iMac and I don't have cocoa pods
01:06 - installed so we're going to be able to
01:09 - go through that together now
01:10 - alternatively a couple of great guides
01:12 - to install cocoa pods can be found on
01:15 - the official cocoa pod site under guides
01:17 - getting started and then under
01:20 - installation and another great one is on
01:22 - ray Wonderlic site how to use cocoa pods
01:25 - with swift so I'll add these two links
01:27 - in the description below ok so what
01:30 - you're going to do first is open up
01:32 - terminal so you can either press command
01:35 - spacebar and search for terminal and
01:37 - open it up that way or if you go to your
01:40 - launch pad it is I believe in utilities
01:43 - or other sorry and it's this one right
01:46 - here terminal so when you click that it
01:48 - shows a little window like this and all
01:50 - you have to do is type sudo gem install
01:54 - cocoa pods now hit enter and it's going
01:58 - to ask you for your password after you
02:01 - enter in your password it might take a
02:02 - little while to get started as it did
02:04 - for me I had to wait about maybe 40
02:07 - seconds before I started to see anything
02:09 - on the screen but I just cut out that
02:10 - waiting time in the editing so you
02:12 - didn't see any of it but when it's
02:13 - finished
02:14 - installing you should see something like
02:15 - this the next thing you want to do is
02:18 - type pod setup - - verbose and that's
02:25 - going to let you see the progress as
02:27 - it's setting things up so with those two
02:30 - commands we are done setting up cocoa
02:32 - pods and if you're not familiar with
02:34 - working in terminal or this kind of
02:36 - looks complicated don't worry because
02:38 - you only need to set up cocoa pods once
02:40 - and then after that as you're going to
02:42 - see soon it's very simple to set up for
02:44 - each new Xcode project that you do so
02:47 - there you have it pretty easy to set up
02:48 - right and you only have to do that once
02:50 - now in the coming days I'll introduce
02:52 - you guys to all of the popular
02:53 - third-party libraries that are really
02:55 - handy to have in your Xcode project and
02:57 - I'll show you guys how to set it up and
02:58 - use it using cocoa pods so thanks for
03:01 - watching if you know someone who hasn't
03:02 - heard about cocoa pods or hasn't used it
03:04 - before please send them this video and
03:06 - if you found it useful please share it
03:08 - thank you so much for watching again and
03:10 - I'll see you guys tomorrow
