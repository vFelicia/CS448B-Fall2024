00:02 - hey coders it's Chris here in this
00:04 - lesson we're going to talk about this
00:05 - Library called Alamo of fire I know we
00:08 - used this and covered this a bit in the
00:09 - YouTube video app Series in the advanced
00:12 - version that is starting from maybe
00:14 - lesson 10 onward but I never did it as a
00:16 - separate video and I think it's
00:18 - definitely worth mentioning because it's
00:20 - so useful and such a staple when it
00:22 - comes to doing networking in your excode
00:24 - project and in this video I'm going to
00:26 - show you guys how to install it in a
00:28 - simple usage case all right so let's dig
00:30 - in in a previous lesson I showed you
00:32 - guys how to set up cocoa pods and we're
00:34 - going to use that to install this but
00:36 - first of all we're going to create our
00:38 - xcode project so I'm going to go ahead
00:40 - open xcode and just create a brand new
00:43 - xcode project I'm going to choose a
00:45 - single View application and just call
00:47 - this um AF sample and make sure that the
00:50 - language is Swift the rest doesn't
00:53 - really matter for this demo I'm going to
00:55 - save it on the desktop and that's going
00:57 - to be important because I'm going to
00:58 - need to find that folder uh now that we
01:00 - have our project I'm going to go ahead
01:03 - and close it because we're going to
01:06 - initialize the Pod file for our project
01:09 - here on the desktop so I'm going to do
01:11 - is hit command spacebar to open
01:14 - spotlight search and I'm going to search
01:16 - for
01:17 - terminal so once we open that up you can
01:21 - type PWD to see where you are currently
01:24 - uh and so it looks like we're in SL
01:26 - users SL Chris now the desktop folder if
01:30 - I press command up command up just to
01:33 - see where it is
01:35 - it's it's under crisk desktop AF sample
01:39 - so that's where I'm going to go
01:41 - CD desktop because I'm already on the
01:45 - Chris folder so you can type LS to list
01:47 - the directory contents and I can
01:49 - definitely see my folder there so CD AF
01:53 - sample and if you need to go backwards
01:55 - just press CD space dot dot to go up one
01:59 - folder level
02:00 - so there I am at the desktop LS to list
02:03 - it so that's just helpful for you guys
02:07 - if you don't know these terminal
02:08 - commands now if you start typing in a
02:11 - couple letters you can also press tab to
02:12 - complete it if that's the only folder
02:14 - with those two letters all right so in
02:16 - my project folder here I want to type in
02:18 - pod space in it and that's going to
02:21 - create the Pod file and if I go back to
02:24 - my directory I can see that now it has
02:26 - this pod file and in the Pod file I'm
02:29 - going to to open it in a text editor
02:33 - like Sublime
02:34 - Text and here we're going to follow the
02:38 - instructions on the Alamo fire GitHub
02:41 - page so under installation under Coco
02:43 - pods you can see how you would install
02:46 - it here let's uncomment platform let's
02:50 - uncomment use Frameworks and in between
02:53 - Target and end we can do pod Alamo fire
02:57 - just follow that text there or maybe you
02:59 - can even copy and paste it so let's do
03:04 - that all right now we're going to save
03:06 - it and we're actually going to need
03:08 - terminal again so I'm going
03:10 - to open that and we're going to navigate
03:12 - to our folder again so desktop slf
03:17 - sample and in here we can type in pod
03:21 - install and that's going to read the Pod
03:24 - file and it's going to install alamoo
03:26 - fire for us okay so now we can go back
03:28 - to AF sample
03:30 - and we're going to open up the project
03:32 - by clicking the XC workspace all right
03:35 - I'm going to make this window a little
03:36 - smaller so we can see more of it on the
03:40 - screen uh and here we're going to jump
03:43 - right into our view controller now
03:45 - before we go on let me talk about what
03:47 - we'll be downloading I created a simple
03:49 - Json file and put it on my server and
03:51 - you can see here it's a dictionary
03:53 - because it's got these curly brackets
03:55 - it's got a key first key and its value
03:58 - is it works
04:00 - it's got a second key and its value is
04:03 - an array with three items and we're also
04:06 - loading this through https so we don't
04:08 - have to worry about the app Transport
04:10 - Security restriction all right so going
04:12 - to viewcontroller.swift all I'm going to
04:15 - do right here is Type in
04:18 - import almal
04:21 - fire and if it doesn't recognize it like
04:23 - that just press command B we're going to
04:27 - build the project
04:30 - all right and then in the view did load
04:33 - I am just going to make a call with
04:35 - alamoo fire to grab this Json file and
04:39 - display some of these values so just to
04:42 - review let's go to the usage part of the
04:46 - GitHub page and here you can see how we
04:48 - would make a request and also how to
04:51 - handle the response the key parts to
04:53 - notice the Alamo fire class you're going
04:55 - to call request and this is the request
04:59 - method or the request type and this is
05:01 - going to be your url any parameters that
05:04 - you need and we're not going to need any
05:06 - so we're not going to put anything in
05:08 - there responsejson to handle the
05:11 - response that comes back and then this
05:13 - part so this optional binding in order
05:15 - to determine if the result had a value
05:17 - and then we get to use the Json result
05:19 - so if this is one of your first times
05:21 - using this Library you might have to
05:22 - refer to this usage section A little bit
05:26 - uh but once you do it a couple of times
05:27 - in a couple of different projects uh
05:29 - you're probably going to know it like
05:30 - the back of your hand okay so let's go
05:32 - back to our EXO project and let's fire
05:35 - off the
05:36 - request and we're going to just use this
05:39 - one without the parameters parameter
05:41 - because we don't need to specify any
05:43 - parameters so the method is going to be
05:45 - a get and the URL I'm just going to copy
05:49 - it from
05:52 - here we're going to write Dot
05:55 - responsejson and this one will suffice
05:58 - with the completion Handler let's
06:00 - doubleclick this block to expand it and
06:02 - it's got a response parameter like that
06:05 - so we're just going to call it response
06:08 - and in here in the code we're going to
06:10 - use some optional binding check if the
06:13 - result has a value so if let Json equals
06:18 - the response do
06:22 - result do
06:25 - value so in here we can print the J on
06:30 - just like they did in the
06:32 - usage all right so now we're going to
06:35 - just give this a quick run and check out
06:37 - the
06:40 - console all right so in our console
06:43 - window it looks like it did grab the
06:44 - Json you can see here first key with the
06:48 - value second key with that and if we
06:50 - wanted to print out specific values of
06:53 - the keys we would just
06:55 - type print
06:57 - Json first
07:00 - key as
07:02 - string all right and let's print second
07:06 - key as n s
07:11 - array all right so I print out the value
07:14 - of the first key and this is the value
07:16 - of the second key so that's how easy it
07:18 - is to use Alamo fire in your project to
07:19 - handle any sort of networking that you
07:21 - need to do hope you guys enjoyed that
07:23 - please leave your comments below uh
