00:08 - hey guys today we're going to be
00:10 - learning about switch statements which
00:12 - are similar to the if statements you
00:14 - guys learned about last time all right
00:16 - let's get started
00:20 - feel free to download this xcode project
00:23 - from the link below or from the link on
00:25 - the screen in the last episode we talked
00:27 - about if statements which allow you to
00:30 - control the flow of your code in this
00:33 - demo we're going to talk about the
00:34 - switch statement and it's similar to the
00:36 - if statement so first i'm going to write
00:39 - an if statement to show you guys what
00:41 - the difference would be and how to write
00:44 - the equivalent so let's say i start off
00:46 - with an age variable again and let's say
00:48 - i wanted to do something if the age was
00:51 - equal to 5 and then equal to 7 and equal
00:54 - to 9 and equal to 11 and so on and so
00:56 - forth with an if statement i could write
00:58 - something like
01:01 - if age is equal to 5 then do something
01:06 - else if age is equal to 7
01:09 - then do something else
01:11 - else if age is equal to
01:14 - 9
01:15 - then do something else
01:17 - else if
01:19 - you know age is equal to 10 so on and so
01:22 - forth and then finally if
01:25 - it doesn't equal any of those things
01:27 - then do something else
01:29 - so
01:30 - you know that would be one way of doing
01:32 - it well with the switch statement you
01:35 - you don't have to write out
01:38 - as many lines of code and it's also
01:40 - more elegant and it's the preferred way
01:43 - when you have to do something like
01:46 - what's outlined above so xcode already
01:48 - breaks it down for us with the switch
01:50 - keyword you have to add an expression
01:53 - and then you have multiple cases kind of
01:55 - like that if statement that we have and
01:56 - then within each case you have your
01:58 - statements and then the default that you
02:00 - see down there that's kind of like your
02:02 - else so let's incorporate the age
02:04 - variable
02:05 - so we're gonna switch on the age
02:08 - variable
02:09 - and we're going to write a case where
02:12 - age is 5 and then our statements would
02:14 - be
02:15 - something like this
02:19 - and then you have your case where it's
02:21 - seven
02:24 - and this break keyword kind of means
02:26 - like if you go into
02:29 - this case let's say h matches case
02:31 - number five and you do something this
02:34 - break keywords means that you break out
02:37 - of this control structure so
02:39 - once the control flow hits break it
02:42 - would exit out of the switch statement
02:44 - and continue executing whatever code you
02:46 - have down there so let's finish this
02:48 - switch statement
02:50 - case
02:51 - case 9
02:56 - case 10
03:02 - and then finally you have uh default
03:05 - which is kind of like your else and you
03:06 - can either you know you don't have to
03:08 - have statements in there you could
03:10 - just not do anything you could choose
03:12 - not to do anything and so these two are
03:15 - equivalent
03:21 - using a switch statement
03:23 - and here's the equivalent using an if
03:26 - statement
03:29 - now something else that's cool about the
03:30 - switch statement is let's say that you
03:32 - wanted to do the same thing whether the
03:35 - age was five or seven well in using an
03:38 - if statement you would do something like
03:40 - this remember the pipes
03:46 - so in this case
03:48 - i would be doing the same thing if the
03:50 - age was seven or nine well we can do the
03:52 - equivalent here in the um in the switch
03:55 - statement by simply
03:57 - going like this and how this reads is if
04:00 - h matches case 7 or 9
04:03 - then do something and then finally break
04:05 - out of the switch statement
04:07 - now that adds to your arsenal for
04:09 - writing conditional logic and objective
04:11 - c
04:12 - now i recently read an article that said
04:14 - that 80 of iphone users check their
04:16 - phone more than 15 times a day
04:18 - now i don't know where they got their
04:20 - facts from but
04:22 - i linked the article below you know what
04:24 - they're probably right
04:25 - i probably checked my phone more than 15
04:27 - times a day what about you let me know
04:30 - in the comment section below and i'll
04:31 - see you guys next time bye
04:34 - [Music]
04:47 - you
