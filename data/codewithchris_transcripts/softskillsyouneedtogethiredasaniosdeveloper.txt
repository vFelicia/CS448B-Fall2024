00:00 - Hey CodeCrew!  Last week we talked about 
the essential technical skills you need  
00:03 - to get your first ios developer job in this 
video i want to talk about something that  
00:08 - is arguably even more important and that is the 
intangible soft skills or attributes that make you  
00:13 - who you are in my opinion these soft skills are 
even more important than the tech skills because  
00:18 - the technical skills they can be learned now these 
soft skills that we're going to talk about if you  
00:22 - don't work on them they may give out the wrong 
impression to the recruiter and it may ruin your  
00:27 - chances of getting your first ios developer job 
so please pay attention all right let's dive in  
00:34 - okay so we're going to try something a little 
bit different because for these soft skills  
00:38 - i wasn't sure what to put on the screen and i 
didn't want you to just watch my talking head  
00:42 - as the full screen so i've put up some uh coding 
footage of my self-coding and i'm just going to  
00:50 - tell you about these important soft skills so 
just pay attention to what i'm saying uh and  
00:55 - and hopefully at least the coding part is 
interesting okay so first things first these soft  
01:01 - skills are what i look for when i'm interviewing 
candidates these things are subjective i think  
01:07 - for every company it could be different but in my 
experience and working with people this is what i  
01:12 - value okay so the first one is arguably the most 
important one it's not that the other soft skills  
01:18 - are unimportant it's just that for this particular 
one if it's missing i consider the interview done  
01:25 - and that is coachability and coachability is 
especially important for someone coming on  
01:30 - board as a junior or new developer to me being 
coachable actually means a few things number one  
01:36 - it means that the candidate checks their ego in at 
the door and realizes that everyone has something  
01:43 - to learn even the smartest guys in the room nobody 
knows everything and not only that everybody can  
01:49 - be wrong at times number two it means that the 
candidate is receptive to criticism and feedback  
01:56 - because without that the candidate will not be 
able to improve their skills right so i'm really  
02:03 - looking for an attitude like i'm here to learn 
and there's a lot that i don't know and there is a  
02:09 - lot that i can learn from from other people being 
coachable also means that the candidate is able to  
02:15 - apply the feedback to their future coding so that 
they don't make the same mistakes over and over  
02:22 - so obviously this one is kind of hard to gauge in 
an interview but however if the candidate doesn't  
02:29 - demonstrate that they are improving by applying 
the feedback that they're receiving then that  
02:35 - is sort of a red flag probably something that 
we should bring up in a performance review or  
02:41 - something like that all right the next one 
is teamwork how well does the candidate work  
02:46 - together with the team are they difficult 
to work with are they argumentative are the  
02:51 - conversations that they have with other people 
constructive a very easy way to tell this is  
02:58 - are they bringing their teammates up or are they 
putting them down so if someone else on the team  
03:03 - makes a mistake are they pointing the finger at 
them and saying so and so did this and that's  
03:09 - why this isn't working or that's why we couldn't 
make this deadline or are they pitching in even if  
03:15 - it's not their fault and and helping to bail the 
team out that's being a team player you know if  
03:21 - someone doesn't play nice with the team it can do 
more harm than good i don't care how smart you are  
03:27 - or how well you can write code okay the third 
one you've probably heard of before and that is  
03:32 - communication now communication is actually two 
types it's verbal and it's written but it's not  
03:37 - about how eloquently you can speak or how well you 
can write technical documentation or emails things  
03:45 - like that i mean that stuff will definitely help 
being able to convey what you're trying to say  
03:51 - in a succinct way without being too verbose 
and things like that for me personally i tend  
03:56 - to ramble on so that's not good that's something 
that i need to work on but communication what i'm  
04:01 - really talking about for example if you're stuck 
on a problem and you're falling behind do you  
04:06 - just sit there and be stuck and don't say anything 
until your team lead rolls around and asks you hey  
04:12 - how's that feature going and you know it's the 
deadlines the day you're supposed to deliver it  
04:17 - and you say well i was stuck four days ago and 
i couldn't figure it out and now i'm stuck and  
04:21 - it's not done that's the worst possible thing 
that you can do if you over communicate you just  
04:28 - say that you've encountered a roadblock a setback 
some delays some unexpected errors or issues  
04:35 - and say that you know you're working on a fix or 
you're working on some sort of work around things  
04:40 - may be delayed and you raise that early there are 
opportunities to get help right for example the  
04:46 - team lead may get someone else to help you take a 
look at it or they may have suggestions or offer  
04:53 - solutions but if you don't say anything about it 
then you're basically failing at this soft skill  
04:59 - so that's just one example of communication 
another example is asking questions when you need  
05:05 - to right there's a balance like are you asking 
silly questions that you can find out on your own  
05:10 - or are you asking valid questions that uh will 
shed light and and actually prevent you from  
05:17 - going down the wrong path for example right so 
communication is one thing that i look for as well  
05:23 - a fourth one is resourcefulness now some 
people call this problem solving i like to  
05:27 - call it resourcefulness because it's not just 
about solving a technical challenge for example  
05:34 - solving some sort of algorithm challenge it's not 
about that resourcefulness is more important to me  
05:40 - and that is the candidate's ability to work around 
issues and problems because face it no matter what  
05:47 - level of developer you are you are always going to 
encounter unexpected challenges now the key is how  
05:53 - you're going to deal with it and this sort of goes 
back to what we mentioned about communication for  
05:57 - example if you hit a roadblock are you just going 
to sit there and be stuck or are you going to  
06:03 - be resourceful and try to find a solution what i'm 
looking for is someone when they hit a roadblock  
06:09 - to try everything that they can think of to find a 
solution to get past that roadblock or to solve it  
06:16 - and if that still doesn't work then i would expect 
that person to do a research or to ask people  
06:23 - you know pull on the people that you have to get 
some help and to get some insight on your problem  
06:29 - and if that doesn't work then i would expect the 
candidate to start thinking about alternative  
06:35 - solutions or workarounds that may not exactly be 
what they needed to do but you know it is also  
06:45 - a solution right oftentimes you might get 
requests from people who aren't technical  
06:52 - and you know some things cannot be done or it 
can be done but it may introduce um fragility  
06:59 - right it may be a very fragile solution so maybe 
not the best thing to do so you have to keep in  
07:05 - mind that there are always multiple solutions 
to something you just have to understand sort  
07:12 - of the underlying intention of of that request 
or you know that feature so going back to it i  
07:18 - would expect the candidate if they've exhausted 
all of their options that they know of they've  
07:24 - pulled on help they've done research and still 
nothing to come up with a list of workarounds  
07:29 - and alternative solutions and a list of pros and 
cons that they know of and then they can present  
07:34 - it to the team lead and they can make a decision 
on how to go so that to me is being resourceful  
07:40 - all right the fifth soft skill that i'm 
looking for is the ability to manage deadlines  
07:44 - oftentimes you won't just have one task with one 
deadline you're going to be juggling multiple  
07:49 - things with multiple deadlines now don't get 
me wrong this is not about trying to finish  
07:54 - everything on time because oftentimes there 
just isn't enough hours in the day it's about  
08:00 - setting expectations and communicating again 
communication that thing it's important to be  
08:06 - able to prioritize your tasks right and to be able 
to track your deadlines so you don't drop the ball  
08:11 - on any of them and just communicating when things 
will be done if things are going to be delayed  
08:17 - things are going to be done ahead of time which 
is rare and especially with development and coding  
08:24 - unexpected things always come up and that is 
expected right that is a known thing but it  
08:30 - goes back to communication you need to communicate 
and set expectations that there's a potential  
08:36 - delay now along with managing deadlines you 
also have to learn when to say no for example  
08:41 - different departments in the company may ask you 
for different things and if you don't push back  
08:47 - or you don't recognize when your plate is full 
already and you commit to too many things you  
08:53 - may just end up dropping all the balls and that 
is bad and i know that there is a tendency for  
08:59 - beginners to want to prove their worth and to show 
everyone how hard they can work but you might just  
09:06 - end up burning yourself out and that doesn't help 
anyone so over time you'll learn when to recognize  
09:13 - when your plate is full and if you take on any 
more things your work quality will start to  
09:19 - deteriorate or you will start to miss deadlines so 
when you learn to recognize that you have to push  
09:26 - back because it's worse to commit to something 
and then drop the ball than it is just to say no  
09:31 - my plate is full i'm afraid you're gonna have 
to find someone else to do that and trust me  
09:36 - people will respect you more for being able to 
recognize when your play is full and saying no  
09:41 - now the soft skills we covered today combined with 
the technical skills that we covered in the last  
09:46 - video should give you a fairly good idea of what's 
to be expected with a newly hired ios developer  
09:54 - and so those soft skills and technical 
skills are the things that you can work on  
09:57 - if you want to start applying for your first 
ios developer job between this video and the  
10:02 - technical skills video do you think we missed 
anything if you think we did drop us a comment  
10:06 - below and let us know also this type of video 
isn't the usual thing that we do we usually  
10:12 - create technical coding tutorials so if 
you want to see more of this type of video  
10:17 - definitely drop us a comment and let us know 
especially if you have some video ideas that you'd  
10:21 - like us to cover alright thanks for watching i 
hope you enjoyed it i'll see you in the next video
