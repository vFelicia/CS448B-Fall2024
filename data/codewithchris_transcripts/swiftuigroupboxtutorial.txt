00:00 - hey it's Chris and today I'm going to
00:01 - show you how to use a swiftui group box
00:03 - you see them everywhere and they kind of
00:05 - look like this this gray box around
00:08 - these elements and I know I know you
00:09 - could use a rounded gray rectangle to
00:13 - put it as a background but why do that
00:15 - when you can use a group box all right
00:17 - let's dive in and check it out before we
00:19 - begin one quick note we have a free exco
00:22 - project containing sample code for all
00:24 - of the Swift UI components use it for
00:26 - your own projects or just to learn from
00:28 - get it at
00:30 - SL Swift ui- kit so I've got a new xcode
00:34 - project here with simply a label on the
00:36 - screen now if we wanted to use a group
00:39 - box to wrap around this text element
00:43 - this is what you would do group Box open
00:46 - a curly bracket you have the closing one
00:49 - and then you simply put the label inside
00:51 - of it and get a group box and it's
00:55 - literally as simple as that so why don't
00:57 - we make it a little more complicated and
01:00 - I'll also show you a couple of options
01:02 - to make it a little more interesting so
01:04 - let's change the text label to be
01:09 - um a
01:14 - toggle and instead of constant let's
01:16 - just sorry instead of binding let's put
01:18 - a
01:20 - constant okay and then you can see how
01:22 - the group box is now push through the
01:24 - edge let's add some padding so you can
01:27 - actually see the whole thing and let's
01:29 - add a second
01:30 - toggle now let's say you wanted to
01:32 - change the
01:34 - background color of your group box you
01:37 - could do that by adding a modifier to it
01:41 - now don't add the background one what
01:43 - you actually want is background style
01:46 - and then let's say you wanted to change
01:48 - it
01:49 - to uh I don't know red no one would
01:53 - really use red um but if you did Black
01:56 - you'd have to change the text color and
01:58 - to change the text color you would do
02:00 - foreground
02:04 - style for example right um I'm going to
02:09 - remove those because I just want to keep
02:10 - it gray now there is another option for
02:13 - the group box if you open up the
02:16 - initializers there is a label parameter
02:20 - what is that well let's take a look so
02:23 - let's go back let's just add the label
02:26 - parameter ourselves so in this label
02:28 - parameter you can add an element let's
02:31 - say text uh settings that or better yet
02:37 - you can use a label instead of a text
02:40 - component you can use a label component
02:43 - so a label component lets you add a
02:46 - piece of text with a SF icon which is
02:50 - handy so we can do settings and then for
02:54 - the system image if you know the icon
02:56 - name that you would like to
02:58 - use such as as
03:02 - gear oh
03:04 - sorry yes
03:08 - gear then you would get that so that's
03:11 - how simple it is to use group box it's
03:13 - great for grouping groups of
03:16 - information so in particular if you look
03:18 - at the health app on your iPhone it uses
03:22 - a lot of group boxes for things like
03:24 - your weight your exercise uh log your
03:29 - you know heart rate log and things like
03:31 - that it groups all of those different
03:33 - categories of information using group
03:36 - boxes now you know how to use them as
03:39 - well if you want to download the sample
03:41 - code for this we've got it all in a
03:43 - single handy EXO project in fact it
03:46 - contains a sample code for all of the
03:48 - Swift UI components so that you can
03:50 - learn from it or copy and paste the code
03:52 - into your own project just visit
03:55 - cc. swiftui dkit it's a free download
04:00 - I'll leave it in the description below
04:01 - the video too
