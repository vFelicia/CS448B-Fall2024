00:05 - hello welcome to this lesson where we
00:09 - are going to integrate the parse
00:10 - framework into our Xcode project now I'm
00:13 - on parse comm and I'm going to open up
00:16 - the documentation so that we can refer
00:18 - to it while we are setting up the
00:21 - project so let's go to the docs link on
00:24 - the parse home page and we're going to
00:29 - download the SDK here under iOS and
00:37 - we're going to choose this one SDK and
00:43 - I'm gonna save it on my desktop but
00:46 - there's actually a QuickStart and so up
00:49 - here click QuickStart we're gonna select
00:53 - data we're gonna select mobile iOS and
00:59 - there's no Swift but I'm gonna show you
01:01 - how to integrate it with our Swift
01:03 - project so just choose objective-c and
01:06 - we're going to choose the existing
01:07 - project because the V choose new project
01:10 - it gives you an Xcode project to
01:13 - download which is objective-c so we're
01:15 - gonna choose this existing project so
01:19 - we've already done this part and
01:20 - download the SDK and the next step is
01:24 - that we gotta unzip that and then add
01:27 - those framework files to our Xcode
01:30 - project so let's go to where I
01:35 - downloaded that zip file I'm gonna unzip
01:38 - it and there are all the frameworks that
01:44 - we have to add to our Xcode project now
01:47 - let's create our Xcode project so I have
01:51 - Xcode open I'm going to create a brand
01:53 - new Xcode project it's gonna be a single
01:57 - View application and I'm gonna call this
02:02 - the simple chat up now for organization
02:06 - name and identifier you can just put
02:09 - whatever is relevant to you language
02:11 - make sure that this is Swift though
02:13 - and devices iPhone use core data is
02:16 - unchecked click Next and I'm just going
02:20 - to save this on my desktop okay so now
02:25 - we have our basic simple application I'm
02:29 - going to go back to that folder which
02:32 - where I downloaded all of the parse
02:34 - frameworks then I'm gonna highlight them
02:37 - all and I'm gonna drag them right under
02:42 - that root node right there make sure
02:45 - that this is checked copy items if
02:48 - needed what this will do is actually
02:49 - copy those frameworks from your desktop
02:52 - into the project folder where you saved
02:55 - your project and that just keeps all of
02:57 - your files together in one neat place so
02:59 - make sure that this is checked click
03:02 - finish and then you're going to see all
03:05 - of these framework files in your file
03:08 - navigator now so going back to this
03:13 - documentation we've done step two okay
03:16 - now let's look at step three we have to
03:18 - add all of these other dependencies to
03:21 - our project ok so the list of them are
03:24 - right here and this is why we have this
03:26 - open so we can refer to this list as we
03:28 - add them so let me scroll up here let me
03:32 - open up Xcode and move it right here so
03:38 - that we can see actually let me shrink
03:40 - the window a bit like that
03:46 - hopefully you can see everything but
03:49 - where you want to go is click this root
03:51 - node of your project so you get to see
03:54 - all of the settings and then make sure
03:56 - you're looking at this general tab right
03:58 - here scroll all the way down and you
04:02 - should see a section that says linked
04:03 - frameworks and libraries and you can
04:06 - already see the parse frameworks that
04:08 - you've added should be listed there if
04:10 - they're not you can just highlight these
04:12 - guys in your file navigator and then
04:14 - click and drag them into this section
04:16 - but they should be there now click this
04:20 - little plus icon that you see it says
04:22 - add items and click plus and one by one
04:26 - we need
04:27 - to search for these guys so let's say
04:32 - audio toolbox there's the one double
04:36 - click that and they'll it's gonna add it
04:38 - and click plus again a search for CF
04:42 - network that's the next one double click
04:45 - it to add it and we're gonna repeat this
04:47 - process for all of those so make sure
04:51 - you get all of them because if you miss
04:53 - one and you try and use a specific
04:57 - feature that relies on that dependency
04:59 - um it won't work
05:01 - so I'm at mobile core now about core
05:05 - services next is quartz core security
05:16 - framework now if you're not using all of
05:20 - the features of the parse platform you
05:23 - probably don't need all of these
05:25 - frameworks either but for this
05:29 - demonstration I'm going to add all of
05:31 - that rather than figure out which ones I
05:34 - need and don't need just for the data
05:36 - part okay down to the last two so
05:43 - there's a couple here make sure you're
05:44 - selecting the right one according to
05:46 - that documentation SQL light again there
05:56 - are two of them that are very similar
05:58 - and according to the documentation I
06:00 - should selected this one without the 3.0
06:03 - I should select this one okay now that
06:10 - we've done that step let's go back into
06:11 - our Xcode project and clean it up a
06:13 - little bit what you can do is highlight
06:19 - all of these frameworks right-click it
06:22 - or hold down command and click if you
06:24 - don't have a two button mouse and then
06:28 - select new group from selection and name
06:32 - it frameworks so that just tucks them
06:36 - away into a group nicely now if you
06:41 - elect to create a group and then drag
06:43 - them into the group instead of doing
06:46 - that then just go back to your project
06:49 - settings and make sure that none of
06:51 - these frameworks and libraries are read
06:54 - because if they are read that means it
06:56 - can't find it you just you just moved
06:59 - them and then all you would need to do
07:01 - is just delete the read entry and then
07:05 - read rag it from where your new location
07:08 - is in your project into that section
07:11 - okay now let's do a simple check so
07:14 - let's go prod product and select build
07:18 - just to make sure everything's working
07:20 - and building and compiling okay
07:27 - succeeded chances are if you have some
07:31 - red entries in here then you wouldn't
07:35 - have been able to succeed in building it
07:38 - okay so let's go back to the
07:40 - documentation and let's see what we have
07:41 - to do so now we have to connect our app
07:44 - to parse let's see what we've got here
07:48 - we have the app delegate actually before
07:52 - we do this so this here is objective-c
07:55 - code and we're working with a swift
07:58 - project so if we want to use objective-c
08:03 - code in our Swift project we need to
08:05 - create what's called a bridging header
08:07 - and the frameworks these parts
08:09 - frameworks are objective-c so we're
08:12 - gonna have to do that and all you need
08:13 - to do is right-click your project folder
08:16 - here go new file so we're going to add
08:20 - an objective-c file I'm just going to go
08:24 - to iOS source make sure you're up here
08:26 - choose objective-c file and you can call
08:30 - it your app name and just save it in
08:40 - your project folder and it's going to
08:45 - ask you would you like to configure an
08:47 - objective-c bridging header because it
08:48 - recognizes that you're using a Swift
08:52 - project right now but you're adding and
08:54 - objective-c file so select yes and what
08:58 - it's going to create for you is this
08:59 - bridging header dot H right here we're
09:02 - going to delete the dot M because we
09:04 - don't need that and all we need is
09:07 - actually this bridging header so in this
09:11 - bridging header we're going to write
09:13 - objective-c code to import the parse
09:16 - files into a C right here says use this
09:19 - file to import your targets public
09:22 - headers that you would like to expose to
09:23 - Swift because we're going to be using
09:25 - the parse classes inside our Swift files
09:28 - and those parse classes are written in
09:31 - Objective C in here we're going to write
09:34 - hash or pound import and do that to
09:45 - import the parse headers from the parse
09:47 - framework so this specifies the parse
09:51 - framework and this is the header file
09:54 - for the parse classes and if you look
09:56 - here in the documentation this is what
10:00 - you would have to do normally in an
10:03 - objective-c project and you would have
10:05 - to do this in every single class where
10:08 - you want to use the parse classes in but
10:11 - for Swift we have this bridging header
10:13 - which we write this import statement
10:16 - once and it's going to be imported into
10:19 - all of our Swift classes that we want to
10:21 - use so let's go to app delegate dot
10:24 - Swift now and look at this did finish
10:27 - launching with options make some space
10:31 - here before the return statement and
10:34 - this is where we are going to do this
10:36 - code so like I said this is objective-c
10:38 - code but we're gonna translate it to
10:40 - Swift so this line we don't really need
10:43 - to worry about it's optional
10:44 - it's just enabling the local data store
10:46 - this one again is optional what we're
10:49 - interested in is this line here where we
10:52 - specify our app ID and our client key so
10:57 - we need to find out what those are in
11:00 - the previous video we created a parse
11:04 - app instance so go ahead and log in to
11:07 - parse
11:07 - now if you don't have an account just
11:10 - create an account so what you're gonna
11:13 - see is the dashboard here this chat app
11:16 - is the one we created in the previous
11:18 - lesson so if you don't have that just
11:21 - click create new app and then just give
11:23 - it a name and you'll have this what
11:26 - we're going to do is we're going to
11:28 - hover over this little gear icon here
11:31 - and click Keys okay and here all my keys
11:38 - it doesn't matter if you see them
11:40 - although you should keep your own keys
11:43 - private but because this is just the
11:45 - public demonstration feel free to use my
11:48 - keys okay so copy the application ID go
11:53 - back to Xcode okay so we got to go parse
11:57 - dot C if we didn't do this bridging
12:02 - header and you don't get this
12:04 - autocomplete then just double check that
12:07 - you have the bridging header and inside
12:10 - that you have that import statement
12:12 - correctly we're going to choose this
12:15 - method set application ID and intercepts
12:19 - a string there's my application ID let's
12:22 - go back here
12:23 - copy the client key and for the client
12:27 - key let's pass that in as well so that's
12:29 - all we need to do here let's go back to
12:33 - the documentation okay and it also
12:39 - recommends to compile and run it just to
12:41 - make sure nothing's broken and you go
12:44 - back you can do command B to build it so
12:49 - while that's building let's take a look
12:51 - at the next line okay so we don't need
12:54 - to do that because of our bridging
12:58 - header and this code right here what it
13:01 - does is create a new parse object
13:06 - it gives it a record name and then it
13:09 - gives it a specifies a column sets a
13:14 - value and then saves it to the database
13:16 - so the cool thing with parse is that if
13:19 - you create an object of
13:21 - specified class and you specify a column
13:26 - that doesn't exist then and you save it
13:29 - then it's actually want to create that
13:31 - record type and it's going to create
13:32 - that entry so in you know back in our
13:37 - chat app parse instance if I go into
13:40 - core up here and take a look at our data
13:45 - right now we have no classes and we have
13:48 - no data so I can either you know add a
13:52 - new class here but I don't even need to
13:56 - do that so I can add a new class here I
13:58 - can you know specify all of the
14:00 - properties that that class would have or
14:05 - I could just go to view controller under
14:08 - the viewdidload I can say let test
14:13 - object be of type PF object equals PF
14:20 - object we're going to create a new PF
14:24 - object i with a class name let's say
14:28 - test class and then we're gonna say test
14:33 - object some property equals some value
14:47 - and then I'm going to say test object
14:51 - dot save we're gonna call this save in
14:54 - background with block method on that
14:56 - object and here you can pass in a block
14:59 - basically it's going to be a chunk of
15:01 - code to execute as soon as it's
15:04 - successfully saved and we're gonna put
15:06 - nil in here because we don't want to do
15:08 - anything after it's saved but you could
15:11 - and you will we probably will when we
15:14 - start implementing our chat app but the
15:17 - purpose of these three lines is just a
15:19 - test that we've set everything up
15:21 - correctly because after running these
15:23 - three lines if our application ID is
15:26 - correct if our client key is correct if
15:28 - you know everything is set up properly
15:31 - then we will see this entry you
15:34 - in our parse admin dashboard so let's
15:38 - hit command R and run this app right now
15:42 - in the simulator and let's see if we get
15:46 - our new class with the sample property
15:49 - and sample value there it goes okay so
15:59 - we don't see anything because these
16:02 - three lines don't display anything on
16:04 - the screen
16:05 - and by default our single view
16:08 - application is just a blank for you okay
16:11 - now we go back here let's refresh this
16:15 - page
16:17 - sure enough under data you can see now
16:20 - we have one class which has one record
16:23 - or one row and it has C this property
16:29 - and this value here so this confirms
16:32 - that we've set up parse correctly with
16:35 - our Xcode project in subsequent lessons
16:38 - we're going to create our class here and
16:42 - then we're going to start setting up the
16:44 - user interface for our simple chat app
16:47 - if you guys want to download the source
16:50 - code as in my particular Xcode project
16:52 - I'm going to make that available in the
16:55 - link below the YouTube video and you can
16:57 - download it but I'm going to erase the
16:59 - application ID and the client key from
17:02 - my project so that you're going to have
17:04 - to set up your own parse app instance
17:06 - and put in your own keys okay so that's
17:10 - it for this lesson thanks for watching
17:12 - and I'll see you guys next time
