00:00 - hello and welcome in this lesson you're 
going to learn how to add your own font  
00:03 - files to your xcode project and how 
to use them all right let's Dive In  
00:08 - okay so here I have a brand new xcode project and 
we're going to take a look at how we can import  
00:12 - our custom font to use and then we're going to try 
to apply it to this text element here first of all  
00:19 - I'm not going to go through all of the sites where 
you can get fonts to use if you're interested in  
00:25 - this lesson then you probably already have a 
font that you want to use inside your app I will  
00:30 - just give a word of caution though that a lot of 
fonts have licenses so you got to take a look at  
00:38 - uh is it free for commercial use or personal use 
it really depends you know how you're using it  
00:44 - um a good place is Google fonts as 
well so you can take a look at that  
00:48 - and we're just going to grab a font from 
here so let's grab this one right here
00:58 - and we'll download the entire family okay all 
right I should have maybe selected a couple of  
01:06 - specific ones that's okay let's unzip the file 
okay and it comes with these fonts right here  
01:15 - now these ttf files sometimes there will be 
like OTF these are the actual font files and  
01:23 - what you're going to want to do is for the 
one that you want to use you want to include  
01:28 - it in your xcode project now let's create 
a specific group inside our xcode project
01:37 - and we will drag let's say 
this one Zen Loop Dash regular
01:43 - uh we'll put in there um you have to make sure 
this part's very critical copy items if needed and  
01:50 - add to targets copy items if needed is going to 
make a copy of that font file inside your project  
01:56 - folder and add to targets is going to bundle 
that font as an asset along with you know when  
02:03 - you deploy and publisher app so it's going to make 
sure that that asset gets included with the amp  
02:12 - okay it's just a double check you can 
highlight your file you can click on  
02:17 - open up the inspector here and just make 
sure Target membership that it is included  
02:23 - in your app here it's very important because 
if this is not included xcode is not going to  
02:29 - be able to find this font file when it tries 
to run the app now the next thing you have  
02:35 - to do is register it in the plist file so make 
sure that this last part is collapsed like that  
02:42 - and click this plus icon to add a new key and type 
in capital f o and and you're going to start to  
02:51 - see fonts provided by application you have to 
type capital F for this autocomplete to pick it  
02:57 - up otherwise it's not going to so capital f o n t 
s we're going to do fonts provided by application  
03:04 - this is an array because you can include more than 
one font if you want let's open up this and you're  
03:11 - going to see item zero um so no let's yeah we 
can add that so we can add this font as item  
03:19 - zero now you're going to want to type in exactly 
that file name here you are specifying the file  
03:24 - name that you want to include as a font provided 
by the application so Zen Loop Dash regular.ttf
03:36 - okay so we're all done here save that if 
we go back to content view you'll see that  
03:45 - there is a font modifier for your text 
element in in here you can provide  
03:53 - a custom font so here you're going to specify the 
font name and the size of the text that you want  
04:05 - just bear in mind that the name that you 
provide here is the font name and it's not  
04:12 - the font file name because this is this name 
that you see right here is just the name of the  
04:18 - font file I could rename this to anything I wanted 
right and in the P list right here you do specify  
04:26 - the file name but when you're specifying the font 
to use each font actually has a name and it's hard  
04:36 - to tell exactly what this name is sometimes it'll 
be exactly the file name that you downloaded it  
04:43 - as but you that's not guaranteed so one way you 
can find out is by doing some digging one way to  
04:51 - do that is you can Loop through all of the fonts 
that are available to use in your app and then you  
04:58 - can you can then peek at the names and you can 
gain that information then you can go ahead and  
05:04 - apply it like this so why don't we go ahead and 
comment out this modifier for now and then what  
05:09 - we're going to do is create an init method so 
this gets run this method gets run as soon as  
05:16 - we launch our app and we're going to use a class 
called UI font this one has a type method where  
05:24 - we can Loop through all of the family names that 
are available to the app right returns an array of  
05:30 - font family names available on the system so we're 
going to Loop through that we're going to say for  
05:37 - family family name in a loop through all of that 
and we're going to print out the family name  
05:47 - now the family name is not necessarily the name 
of that specific font we want to use because if  
05:53 - you take a look at the file folder here Zen Loop 
is probably the family name but you can see that  
06:00 - there's italic and there's regular so those 
would actually be different fonts names so we  
06:09 - have to then Loop through the font names of each 
family name so then we do another we do another  
06:16 - loop so for font name in and then once again 
we use UI font and we can go through the font  
06:25 - names for a specific family name so let's do that 
and we're going to pass in a family name in here
06:35 - and then we're going to print out
06:39 - I will indent it so it's easier to read
06:46 - and we'll print out all of the font names 
that are available under the family names so  
06:52 - I'm going to launch the simulator now and then 
it's going to run this code and print this out  
06:56 - in the console so we can find out for this Zen 
Loop family what is the exact font name that  
07:04 - we need to put in here and you only need to do 
this once because once you know well you know
07:13 - okay so as you can see this list is 
pretty long all of these fonts are  
07:19 - probably available on your system and 
so they're also available to use in  
07:24 - here but let's take a look at Zen Loop 
that should have been near the bottom
07:29 - now if you did this correctly meaning that you 
specified this key in your P list then you typed  
07:37 - in the correct font name sorry file name here 
as it is and also that when you highlight this  
07:47 - font file that it is included in your in your 
app then it should appear on this list and as  
07:53 - you can see this is the family name and this 
is the font name that we need to specify so  
07:58 - let's go ahead and copy that let's go back to 
the content View and now we don't need this  
08:05 - anymore let's just comment all that out or you 
know what I'm gonna comment it out like this so  
08:12 - it's easier for you to copy and paste in case you 
need that in the future and we're going to specify  
08:19 - that name as a string here and for the size I 
don't know we'll say 16. so let's hit resume  
08:26 - and you'll see that it is right there and 
if we run our app this is a very small font
08:35 - so let's say 36. so that's a little bigger and you 
can see now there may be an easier way to do this  
08:46 - um aside from doing it like this and having 
to find or discover the font name you could  
08:53 - install this font on your system so if you 
double click it it should open up font book  
09:00 - and you can say install this font and what's 
going to happen is it's going to open up this  
09:08 - application on your system called font book so 
you see the font book right there and if you go  
09:15 - to all fonts and you go all the way to the bottom 
here well that's because that's where Zen Loop is
09:23 - a lot of the times um it will 
be family name Dash that font so
09:35 - oh and space is removed so this is one 
way to guess at the font family name but  
09:43 - again not guaranteed so for example 
um zapfino here right I'm guessing  
09:53 - that the font name for this font should be 
zapfino Dash regular so you can try that
10:03 - and you can just see if you're right does that 
look like zapfino no that doesn't look like it  
10:13 - um so maybe this is not the best way to to do 
that hold on let me uncomment that init and  
10:23 - run it again and let's see ah you see I'm wrong 
the the font name is actually just Zep you know  
10:32 - there was no regular so I guess that's why we 
should do that this sort of looping through the  
10:40 - family name and the font names to discover 
what the actual font name is you could try  
10:46 - to guess from the font book but as you just 
saw it's not going to be a hundred percent
10:53 - all right so now you know how to use custom fonts 
in your app remember to use this power responsibly  
10:58 - and don't put a variety of different fonts 
into your app I'll see you in the next lesson
