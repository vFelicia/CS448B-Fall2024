00:04 - hello everyone welcome to how to make
00:07 - iphone apps with no programming
00:09 - experience in this lesson we're going to
00:12 - take a look at the tools and materials
00:13 - needed for iOS development in this
00:16 - lesson you're going to learn about where
00:18 - to get these tools and what they are and
00:20 - a little bit about how an app is
00:23 - constructed with these tools and lastly
00:25 - you're going to learn about what you
00:27 - need to do in order to publish your app
00:29 - into the App Store so let's get started
00:32 - now the only thing you really need to
00:34 - start iphone app development is a Mac
00:36 - and before you go and dismiss the video
00:39 - I want to let you know that for PC users
00:41 - there's a low cost solution as well but
00:44 - before I get into that let me tell you
00:45 - why you need a Mac so the program which
00:49 - we write our code in to build the app
00:51 - it's made by Apple and that program only
00:54 - runs on the Mac operating system
00:56 - unfortunately for PC users there's a
00:59 - service called Mac in cloud comm where
01:02 - you can rent a Mac and from your PC you
01:05 - can remotely log in to that Mac and so
01:07 - you'll see the Mac desktop on your PC
01:10 - desktop and the price for that service
01:13 - as of this recording is a dollar an hour
01:15 - or $20 a month for unlimited use so
01:19 - that's a really low cost way to get your
01:21 - foot in the door with iPhone app
01:23 - development instead of having to shell
01:26 - out over a thousand dollars to buy a Mac
01:29 - laptop or computer so what is this
01:32 - program that's forcing us to get a Mac
01:34 - or rent a Mac well it's called Xcode and
01:37 - as I mentioned before it's the program
01:39 - where we're going to write our code and
01:41 - build our app so it's pretty essential
01:43 - but however it's free you can get it at
01:45 - the Mac App Store and if you don't know
01:48 - what that is
01:48 - think of an app store for your phone
01:50 - except it's on your computer it's on
01:52 - your Mac and you can download programs
01:54 - for your Mac it usually requires the
01:56 - latest operating system and about three
01:59 - gigabytes of hard drive space so what
02:02 - does this Xcode program allow you to do
02:04 - well if you think about an app for a
02:07 - second at the very basic level it
02:09 - consists of two things the first thing
02:11 - being the user interface
02:13 - that's what the user sees on the phone
02:15 - and what the user interacts with and the
02:18 - second thing is all of the logic and
02:21 - response that happens in response to the
02:24 - user interacting with the app so Xcode
02:28 - allows you to create this user interface
02:31 - visually in fact if you'd like just by
02:35 - dragging and dropping elements onto the
02:37 - screen and second of all it allows you
02:41 - to write that logic and express that
02:44 - logic in terms of code so you're able to
02:47 - code what happens when a user taps that
02:50 - button or what happens when the user
02:52 - swipes and you're able to use that code
02:55 - to perform calculations or go fetch data
02:58 - or respond to the user or update the
03:01 - view furthermore Xcode also allows us to
03:04 - test our app so in addition to creating
03:07 - the user interface and wiring up that
03:10 - logic with code we can run the app in
03:13 - Xcode and Xcode has a great simulator
03:17 - which will appear on your screen to
03:19 - mimic the iPhone and it will run your
03:22 - app inside of that so you can see what
03:25 - your app looks like and you can use and
03:27 - test your app without actually having an
03:31 - iPhone so it's not even a requirement to
03:33 - have a device if you want to build an
03:35 - iPhone app I mentioned that we use code
03:39 - to express the logic and what happens
03:42 - when the user interacts with your apps
03:44 - user interface well that code follows a
03:48 - set of rules and follows a certain
03:51 - framework just like a language that's
03:54 - why it's called a programming language
03:56 - you may have heard that Apple will
03:58 - release the second programming language
04:00 - for building iPhone apps called Swift
04:02 - and this is what the lessons and the
04:05 - course is going to teach you how to use
04:07 - the reason Swift is better for beginners
04:10 - to learn how to build apps with is
04:12 - because the syntax and the structure of
04:14 - the language is a lot more natural and
04:16 - intuitive so it's a lot easier to read
04:20 - and to understand for beginners in the
04:22 - past when I taught the course with
04:24 - objective-c a lot of beginners
04:27 - struggled with the syntax and all of the
04:30 - different symbols and characters that
04:33 - would be used to write the code
04:35 - beginners would struggle with
04:36 - remembering what keywords to use and how
04:40 - to declare certain things with Swift the
04:43 - syntax is more of like plain English so
04:46 - it feels less like you'll have to learn
04:48 - a separate language so I'm really
04:50 - excited to show you guys how to use
04:52 - Swift so that's all there really is to
04:55 - it at the very core you're going to be
04:57 - learning how to use Xcode to build your
04:59 - user interface and you're going to learn
05:01 - the Swift programming language to
05:04 - respond to user events and user gestures
05:07 - and to express logic so after you finish
05:11 - building your app in Xcode and testing
05:13 - it in the simulator how are you going to
05:15 - get it on your device or how are you
05:17 - going to get it into the App Store well
05:19 - this part actually requires you to have
05:21 - an Apple Developer membership and this
05:24 - is a yearly fee that Apple charges it's
05:27 - $99 as of the recording it has been
05:31 - actually ever since the inception of the
05:34 - program it's been $99 a year and that
05:36 - allows you to publish as many apps as
05:39 - you want into the App Store so when you
05:41 - sign up for the Apple Developer Program
05:43 - it gives you access into two things one
05:47 - is called the provisioning portal which
05:49 - is the place where you upload your
05:52 - certificates and create your profiles
05:54 - that dictate which devices your app can
05:57 - be installed on and the second thing
06:00 - gives you access to is iTunes Connect
06:02 - and that's the place where you're going
06:04 - to create the catalog listing for your
06:06 - app you're going to upload your
06:07 - screenshots it's basically when you
06:09 - browse the App Store and you see all of
06:12 - those app list things with the
06:13 - description and the screenshots and the
06:15 - price and everything you create those
06:18 - things in iTunes Connect so you're going
06:20 - to create the app listing for your app
06:22 - in iTunes Connect and then you're going
06:25 - to upload what you've created an Xcode
06:28 - and then that's where you publish it
06:30 - into the store in iTunes Connect you can
06:33 - also check the stats for your app in
06:35 - terms of downloads and rankings and if
06:38 - you have ads or if you have I add in
06:40 - your
06:41 - app you can check your earnings and you
06:43 - can get those types of reports and if
06:46 - you have in-app purchases iTunes Connect
06:48 - is where you would configure that sort
06:49 - of stuff as well so there you have it
06:51 - the only thing you really require is a
06:54 - Mac which will allow you to install
06:57 - Xcode which is free to build your apps
07:01 - and to test your apps and then if you
07:03 - want to deploy your apps into the App
07:05 - Store or on an actual device you can
07:08 - sign up for the Apple Developer Program
07:10 - which gives you access to two websites
07:12 - to allow you to do that sort of stuff so
07:15 - I hope that was useful to help you
07:16 - understand the ecosystem and all of the
07:19 - tools and materials that we'll be using
07:20 - in the next lesson we'll get started
07:23 - with dabbling in some Swift code
