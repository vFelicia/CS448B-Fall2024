00:01 - [Music]
00:05 - hello it's Chris here and in this video
00:08 - I'm going to tell you about the money
00:09 - that I've made from the App
00:11 - Store and this is almost like a followup
00:14 - to my previous video on the question can
00:17 - you make money with apps so last week my
00:20 - wife and I had decided that finally
00:23 - enough was enough and that we would
00:25 - tackle our budget so I logged into my
00:28 - online banking and I saw this account
00:33 - that uh I I forgot I even had it's a US
00:36 - dollar account and I'm in Canada so we
00:39 - use Canadian dollars and so this account
00:42 - was for my little eBay businesses back
00:45 - in the day so you can see that um I
00:49 - opened this account forgetting that I
00:51 - had it and I was very surprised to see
00:54 - this transaction here and you can see
00:56 - this is the only transaction I had in
00:58 - June like I said I don't really use this
01:00 - account um so yeah June 8th incoming
01:04 - wire transfer from Apple
01:08 - $985 and I thought how the heck could
01:10 - that happen I didn't expect to make any
01:12 - money from the App Store in fact I'm
01:14 - paying for that Apple membership um the
01:17 - iOS Developer membership it's like $110
01:21 - or $100 a year right so in my mind I'm
01:24 - giving Apple $100 every year now you
01:28 - know you can imagine surprised seeing
01:30 - that Apple's giving me some money back
01:32 - so I hop into my iTunes connect and I
01:36 - jump into payments on financial reports
01:38 - so I didn't see anything uh in June here
01:42 - there's not much to see here but I go
01:45 - back two months and I see that indeed
01:49 - they sent this payment to me uh on June
01:52 - 8th
01:53 - here and this is from April because it's
01:56 - delayed 2 months all these payments so
01:59 - this report is a little bit confusing
02:01 - but let me walk you through it and I
02:03 - hope I am allowed to show you guys this
02:07 - I did check out there uh terms and
02:09 - conditions I didn't see anything um
02:12 - saying that I
02:14 - couldn't so it actually lists how much
02:17 - money you've made um by these places
02:19 - here um you can see here that this
02:23 - balance column is in local currency and
02:27 - then there's like um how much you earned
02:30 - pre-tax total and then taxes and
02:32 - adjustments exchange rate blah blah blah
02:35 - and this last column here on the right
02:38 - is how much money you've made and if I
02:41 - scroll all the way to the bottom you're
02:43 - going to see that the big chunk of that
02:45 - $98 came from ad
02:48 - Revenue so that's interesting because
02:51 - the only place I had ads was in this app
02:54 - that I built way way back then and I
02:57 - probably didn't even mention this in the
02:59 - previous video but it was for Blizzard's
03:02 - game Hearthstone it's a card game and
03:06 - this was a free app it basically
03:08 - showcased some YouTube videos of um
03:11 - Trump this guy not not Donald Trump but
03:15 - Trump he's a Hearthstone player who's
03:17 - really good and this kind of um showcase
03:21 - some of his videos so this was the app
03:24 - that I put out for free and it used I
03:27 - add so as you know or maybe you haven't
03:31 - heard but I add shut down so I don't
03:35 - even know I don't think this app is
03:36 - showing a banner advertisements anymore
03:39 - as you can see it was released and last
03:42 - updated in end of July 2014 so I haven't
03:46 - updated this app I kind of just forgot
03:48 - about it so I had this app showing uh
03:52 - banner ads I also had magic hat which I
03:55 - told you guys about down
03:57 - here so I click on this guy and you see
04:00 - that this is actually a paid app this is
04:02 - a dollar and it's really nice to see
04:05 - that we have some good reviews I have to
04:07 - show my friend who we built who built
04:11 - this who he did the art for this okay so
04:16 - if we go back to this report um you can
04:19 - see of this payment all of these
04:22 - different countries
04:24 - here and then finally down here uh we
04:28 - have the ad Revenue so it's interesting
04:30 - to see um how that Abed Revenue came to
04:34 - be so if I jump all the way back to 2014
04:38 - in July when that Hearthstone app was
04:41 - released it was released on the 28th
04:44 - right so I earned like 31 cents in the
04:46 - last 3 days of July and then if we
04:48 - scroll uh in August we earned $
04:51 - 460 earned $4 now keep in mind this was
04:54 - just an app that I published I didn't do
04:57 - any advertising for it at all or
05:00 - anything like that and I think it was
05:01 - just based on the popularity of the game
05:03 - that people would search for it on the
05:05 - app store and they would download it and
05:07 - use it and maybe based on the popularity
05:09 - of trump as well um so you can see I was
05:12 - earning about $5 a month give or take
05:16 - this time this month was a good one this
05:18 - was
05:19 - $8 but you can see the balance slowly
05:21 - accumulating so $5 a month I thought
05:23 - nothing of it um I didn't
05:26 - even pay any attention to it I forgot
05:28 - about it completely
05:30 - and kind of fast forward until 2017 in
05:33 - June so that or April
05:36 - rather so that ad
05:39 - Revenue $76 combined with the sales of
05:44 - Magic Hat up here um that put me over
05:48 - the edge of a payout so you need to
05:51 - accumulate about $100 for them to pay
05:54 - out to you otherwise it just sits in an
05:56 - account or their account and the balance
05:58 - carries forward to the next next month
06:00 - so you can see here in May uh we sold
06:03 - two more units of magic hat so I earned
06:06 - 72 cents and. 70 cents
06:09 - respectively so now I have a balance of
06:12 - like a $150 so who knows now that I add
06:15 - is shut down
06:17 - and this app isn't really bringing in
06:20 - any money anymore any AD Revenue who
06:23 - knows how long it's going to take me to
06:25 - reach the next $100 to get paid
06:28 - out but you know what's going to be
06:30 - interesting is maybe we should do this
06:32 - on the YouTube channel um I'm going to
06:34 - take this app and change out the I add
06:37 - monetization for something that is
06:41 - actually running and um able to generate
06:44 - ad Revenue maybe like ad mob or
06:46 - something like that and then resubmit it
06:48 - and maybe we'll keep track of it as a
06:50 - YouTube community and see um see how
06:54 - much money this makes and over time
06:56 - maybe we can produce more apps and try
06:57 - to make more money from the App Store so
06:59 - this just goes to show you that making
07:01 - money on the App Store is no easy feat
07:04 - um granted that you know I did say that
07:07 - for Magic Hat we didn't try very hard to
07:08 - promote it so with my next app I think I
07:12 - will actually dedicate some effort into
07:15 - some app marketing and I actually have
07:17 - someone who is very good at it in fact
07:19 - he runs his own agency and he is Steve
07:22 - Young from atms. let me see if I can
07:25 - just pull that up really quickly here
07:28 - appmaster .
07:32 - Co so uh I wanted to actually show a
07:35 - picture of him but he runs an agency
07:37 - that actually helps uh
07:40 - companies do app promotion and app
07:42 - marketing for their apps
07:44 - so maybe I can ask him to come on to
07:47 - code with Chris and create a video for
07:49 - you guys just highlighting some of his
07:51 - tips he does hold a webinars free
07:54 - webinar sessions and he sends out free
07:56 - tips to his newsletter so uh do go and
08:00 - check them out if that's something that
08:01 - you're interested in if you have apps in
08:03 - the App Store and you'd like to increase
08:05 - the downloads um go check out app
08:07 - masters. with Steve Young ah I almost
08:10 - forgot Steve Young actually has a
08:12 - YouTube channel uh where he publishes
08:15 - videos pretty regularly so check out in
08:17 - the description below I'll link directly
08:19 - to his YouTube channel so that you can

08:24 - lastly sorry if you're disappointed to
08:26 - find out that it took me 3 years to make
08:29 - 9 $8 from the App
08:31 - Store don't lose hope if you're trying
08:34 - to make money on the App Store I have to
08:36 - say that I wasn't trying very hard at
08:38 - all and I actually do think it would be
08:40 - a very interesting experiment for us to
08:44 - uh produce some apps update that
08:46 - Hearthstone app with the new ad Network
08:49 - and just kind of Follow That and track
08:51 - that and see how much money we can make
08:52 - from the app
08:53 - store if you want to check out the apps
08:56 - that I've built they're all free well
08:58 - Magic hat costs money but there are
09:01 - light versions so let's view more by
09:03 - this developer I'll show you so um there
09:06 - is this one Hearthstone at which is free
09:09 - this one I think maybe the light
09:12 - version these two are the light version
09:14 - yeah so there are free versions of Magic
09:15 - Hat as well that you can check out for
09:17 - free I'll put the links in the
