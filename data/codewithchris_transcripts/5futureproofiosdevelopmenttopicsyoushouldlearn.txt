00:00 - if you've ever tried to learn IOS app development 
you might have found yourself overwhelmed with the  
00:04 - number of principles Concepts and Frameworks 
that you had to learn and on top of that each  
00:08 - year Apple introduces new apis and new Frameworks 
into the mix it's tough to keep up but having said  
00:15 - that here are five Timeless iOS development topics 
that beginners should learn number one the Swift  
00:21 - programming language now this is the code that 
you write to express your app logic such as what  
00:26 - should happen when the user Taps on a button on 
the screen Swift Powers all of Apple's platforms  
00:32 - including iOS iPad OS Mac OS watch OS and so on 
having a basic understanding of Swift is a great  
00:39 - start but as you get deeper and you learn more 
about things like optionals closures protocols  
00:45 - generics and that sort of stuff you're going 
to be able to express your intentions that much  
00:49 - better through your app to get started you can 
read the Swift programming language guide or you  
00:55 - can watch our free master class on Swift basics 
for beginners number two Swift UI y now Swift UI  
01:01 - is the code that describes the user interface 
for your app the Swift UI framework contains  
01:07 - user interface components such as buttons toggles 
sliders but not only that it also contains layout  
01:14 - containers and groups that let you describe 
how these components should be arranged on the  
01:19 - screen the great thing about Swift UI is that 
it's a declarative framework meaning that you  
01:24 - don't have to describe where every single element 
should be placed down to the pixel instead you can  
01:30 - describe relative to other elements how you want 
your user interface components to be arranged and  
01:36 - Swift UI will do its best to arrange it in a 
layout that is the best experience depending  
01:42 - on the screen size that the user is on to get 
started learning Swift UI we have a three hour  
01:48 - tutorial on Swift UI basics for beginners number 
three data flow now after you've got a good handle  
01:54 - on Swift and Swift UI the next topic is to 
learn about how data moves through the screens  
01:59 - of your app you might think that you have to 
write code to manually move data from screen  
02:04 - to screen in your app but in a swift UI app it's 
actually much easier than that by learning about  
02:09 - Concepts such as state bindings environment 
objects and the combined framework you can  
02:15 - take advantage of Swift UI and have your views 
update automatically as the data source changes  
02:20 - personally I had to change the way I thought 
about dataflow when Swift UI came out but I'm  
02:25 - really glad that I did number four navigation and 
view composition after you understand dataflow in  
02:31 - a swift UI app it's not a very big leap to start 
building multi-screened apps Swift UI makes it  
02:37 - really easy to arrange the views in your app such 
as managing them in a tab bar across the bottom  
02:43 - of your app or perhaps letting the user drill 
down into your views using the navigation stack  
02:49 - on top of that composing more complex views out 
of smaller reusable views is very simple as well  
02:56 - once you get the hang of managing and composing 
your use you'll be able to build bigger and more  
03:02 - complex apps on our Channel we have a video about 
navigation in Swift UI go check it out number five  
03:08 - Apple's human interface guidelines while Apple 
releases new apis and Frameworks each year their  
03:15 - guidelines for what makes a great user experience 
and design don't change as often in Apple's human  
03:22 - interface guidelines document you'll find 
best practices for each of their platforms  
03:27 - including common design patterns and guidance 
around things like dark mode and accessibility  
03:33 - by understanding the core principles and best 
practices of what makes an app experience on an  
03:40 - Apple device you'll be able to build your app 
in a way that feels great and looks great even  
03:45 - if you don't have a professional designer or 
if you're not a designer yourself now if you  
03:51 - keep these five Timeless iOS development Topics in 
mind as you embark on your own app Journey you'll  
03:57 - be building your skills on a solid foundation 
that will serve you for years to come to get  
04:01 - started check out our three hour iOS development 
class for beginners you'll find it right here  
04:07 - on YouTube in those three hours you'll learn 
skills in all of these five topics we covered  
04:11 - today and you'll have built your very first 
app thanks for watching and I'll see you there
