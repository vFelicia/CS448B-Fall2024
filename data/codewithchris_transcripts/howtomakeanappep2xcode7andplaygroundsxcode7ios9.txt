00:04 - hey everyone my name is Chris and
00:07 - welcome to lesson two of how to make
00:09 - iphone apps with no programming
00:10 - experience in today's lesson we're going
00:13 - to dabble in some Swift code and just
00:15 - get our feet wet what's important in
00:17 - this lesson is I actually want you to
00:19 - try and do it yourself you should have a
00:22 - Mac and you should have Xcode installed
00:24 - from the Mac App Store when you open
00:27 - Xcode for the first time you'll be
00:28 - presented with a menu like this and
00:31 - we're just gonna select this one saying
00:34 - get started with a playground if you
00:37 - don't have this Welcome menu you can
00:38 - easily open a new playground by going to
00:41 - file new and select playground from up
00:44 - here so we're not starting a whole new
00:51 - app project here we're using something
00:53 - called a playground which was newly
00:55 - introduced in Xcode 6 and you can think
00:58 - of a playground as just a lightweight
00:59 - way for us to try and test out some code
01:02 - without fully having to commit to
01:05 - starting a new app project we're going
01:07 - to get a chance to create a new app
01:09 - project a couple of videos later but for
01:11 - now I wanted to just get our feet wet
01:13 - and test out some Swift code and the key
01:17 - thing I want you to do is to try it out
01:19 - yourself so launch Xcode on your own
01:21 - laptop and type in what I type in and
01:25 - try it out so for our playground we're
01:28 - presented with a name and the platform
01:31 - so I'm just going to leave that as is
01:33 - I'm gonna save it on the desktop okay so
01:38 - see if you can follow along and type
01:40 - what I'm typing in your playground
01:51 - so I'm just gonna put a string into this
01:54 - variable message and a string it's just
01:56 - a piece of text to think of it like that
01:58 - and it's surrounded by these quotes and
02:00 - this equal sign is me putting this piece
02:04 - of text into a variable called message
02:07 - so this total line of code is me
02:12 - declaring a new variable called message
02:14 - and putting this piece of text into the
02:17 - variable so on the right-hand side of
02:20 - this playground you can see the result
02:22 - of what you just typed and now if I want
02:25 - to print let's say if I go like that it
02:32 - will output hello world because that's
02:34 - what I put in and up there so let's look
02:37 - at some other examples so that's me
02:45 - putting the value 10 into a variable a
02:57 - so you can see here that on the right
03:00 - hand side it kind of gives you a preview
03:04 - of what's happening as you're writing
03:06 - these lines of code so I put in the
03:09 - value 10 into the variable a I put in
03:11 - the value 15 into the variable B and I
03:14 - create a new variable called total which
03:18 - is equal to the sum of a and B so if I
03:22 - wanted to print total you can see that
03:27 - it is 25 so I hope you've been able to
03:31 - follow along so far let's try something
03:34 - a little different so I'm gonna say if
03:38 - total is less than 20 then I want to
03:47 - print the text hello and of course
03:55 - nothing happens because the variable
03:59 - total is a plus B which we know to be
04:03 - equal to 25 which is not less than 20 so
04:07 - it's not going to execute this line
04:09 - right here but let's say if we went up
04:12 - here and change the variable a to be 1
04:14 - instead now total is 1 plus 15 which is
04:21 - equal to 16 over here as we can see and
04:24 - now this if statement is true total is
04:27 - 16 which is less than 20 and so this
04:30 - line will execute so an if statement
04:34 - just gives us the power to perform some
04:36 - logic and we'll go over that in a future
04:39 - lesson for now don't worry about trying
04:42 - to memorize the syntax or the structure
04:44 - of what we've written so far we're going
04:47 - to go through in detail in the future
04:49 - all of these different Swift mechanics
04:52 - but for right now all I want you to do
04:55 - is to try it out on your own computer
04:57 - open up Xcode open a new playground and
05:00 - type this in and try it out and the
05:02 - reason I'm making you do this is because
05:04 - I found that the most intimidating thing
05:06 - for students when they're learning
05:08 - iOS development is the programming
05:10 - language aspect of it and I hope that by
05:13 - following along and typing out these
05:15 - statements you'll find that it's
05:17 - actually very logical and easy to follow
05:20 - pretty straightforward and nothing to be
05:22 - fearful about so that's all I really
05:25 - wanted you to do in the next lesson
05:27 - we're going to create a new app project
05:29 - in Xcode and we're going to walk through
05:31 - the different areas of Xcode so that you
05:33 - can get familiar with it
