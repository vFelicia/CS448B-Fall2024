00:00 - hi welcome to module 2 in this module
00:02 - you're going to learn some additional
00:03 - Swift skills that are absolutely
00:05 - essential to the upcoming projects that
00:07 - we're going to build together
00:08 - specifically you're going to dive deeper
00:10 - into the uikit library you're going to
00:13 - learn where to find definitions for all
00:15 - the properties and methods of those
00:17 - classes and just to remind you the uikit
00:19 - library is that framework that apple
00:22 - gives us that contains all of those
00:24 - pre-built ready-to-use
00:25 - elements like buttons image views labels
00:28 - and actually a lot more than just user
00:31 - interface elements as you're going to
00:32 - find out you're going to learn about
00:34 - class inheritance which allows classes
00:36 - to build off of one another this is
00:38 - going to save you a lot of time and also
00:40 - save you a lot of work from having to
00:42 - rewrite code you're going to learn more
00:44 - Swift code specifically how to keep
00:47 - track of a larger collection of data
00:49 - with variables and constants each
00:51 - variable can only keep track of one
00:52 - piece of data so you're going to learn
00:54 - how to keep track of a larger collection
00:56 - of data how to iterate or go through
00:59 - each item of data and how to process it
01:02 - and do something with it and finally
01:04 - you're gonna learn how to have variables
01:05 - and constants that can store nothing I
01:08 - know that sounds really strange but
01:10 - trust me it's absolutely essential some
01:13 - of the concepts may seem theoretical or
01:15 - a little bit obscure and that's why I
01:17 - highly recommend that after each lesson
01:19 - you download that worksheet and practice
01:21 - the concepts that we've taught in that
01:23 - lesson
01:24 - it's really gonna help you put it into
01:25 - practice but doing the exercises you'll
01:28 - also remember the syntax and the
01:29 - keywords better I don't recommend you
01:31 - try to memorize anything just try to do
01:34 - all of the worksheets if you get stuck
01:36 - have that Swift cheat sheet handy and
01:38 - refer to it and sooner or later you're
01:41 - not going to need that reference sheet
01:43 - at all and finally I know for some of
01:45 - you guys this module might not be deemed
01:47 - as fun but think of it this way the
01:49 - skills that you're going to learn in
01:50 - this module is going to enable you to
01:52 - build apps are more complex and apps
01:54 - that can do more and furthermore I
01:56 - wouldn't be teaching you guys this stuff
01:58 - if it wasn't absolutely essential to
02:00 - your app building future all right so
