00:06 - the first thing we're gonna do is add a
00:08 - background to our view so search for
00:11 - uiimageview in this library pane and
00:14 - then once you've found it just drag it
00:16 - here and automatically expands drop it
00:19 - and in the inspector panel here in the
00:22 - upper right hand corner you can actually
00:24 - choose the images that you've imported
00:26 - into your project so I'm gonna pick felt
00:28 - throughout this felt sort of background
00:29 - now and just a quick note the buttons
00:32 - here in the upper right control your
00:34 - workspace so don't forget that if you're
00:36 - not seeing a particular window or pane
00:38 - so make sure you've got the tabs that
00:40 - you want opened and here's the assistant
00:42 - editor which you've used before in the
00:44 - basics series and there's a single view
00:46 - okay so the next thing we're going to do
00:48 - is we're going to create a view that
00:51 - represents each die and we're going to
00:54 - do that by right-clicking here and
00:57 - creating a new file and you're gonna
00:59 - want to make sure that you're under iOS
01:01 - here you're gonna create an objective-c
01:03 - class and I'm just gonna name it dive
01:07 - view and it's gonna be a subclass of UI
01:10 - view now if you don't know what a
01:11 - subclass is you should watch I think it
01:13 - was an episode episode 9 of the basic
01:16 - series that tells you what it is so I'm
01:19 - going to click Next and I'm gonna save
01:21 - it there and so now we have a new die
01:24 - view class that is a UI view which we
01:27 - can put into the storyboard put into
01:30 - view and that's exactly what I'm gonna
01:32 - do I want to add two of those die views
01:34 - to my storyboard here so I'm gonna type
01:37 - in UI view and this just adds a generic
01:42 - view to your page what you have to do is
01:45 - go up here in the inspector pane and
01:48 - then there are a couple of tabs up here
01:50 - so you can see go to the tab where you
01:55 - can specify a custom class right now
01:57 - it's a UI view but you can basically
01:59 - you're telling this storyboard that this
02:02 - view that you put on the storyboard
02:04 - should actually be a die view so you can
02:06 - select it from there like that and just
02:08 - like there are tabs up here in the
02:10 - library pane down here there are tabs as
02:12 - well
02:14 - so make sure if you don't see the UI
02:17 - element library that you're on the right
02:19 - tab okay so I'm just gonna specify some
02:22 - dimensions for it so 100 width and 100
02:26 - height I'm just gonna eyeball it here
02:29 - and what I can actually do is I can
02:31 - click this guy and go command C and
02:34 - command V and create a second copy of it
02:38 - now there's this handy button right here
02:40 - in the lower left hand corner of show
02:42 - document outline that shows you and what
02:44 - sort of elements that you have on the
02:46 - page I'm also gonna want to add a UI
02:49 - label to tell us what the some is just
02:54 - stretch that out a little bit and in the
02:57 - inspector panel in the upper right I'm
03:01 - gonna change it to a centered view
03:04 - I'm gonna put it in the middle just
03:07 - snaps into place and I'm gonna give some
03:09 - default text click to roll now I gotta
03:13 - add the button so that they can actually
03:14 - click something now search for UI button
03:20 - and I'm gonna want to make sure that my
03:23 - button has a background so I scrolled
03:26 - down here in the properties panel give
03:30 - it a white background switch to this tab
03:33 - and give it some width and height
03:43 - I want to go back and give it some
03:46 - default text okay
03:51 - so it's looking pretty good now we want
03:53 - to expose these UI elements to the view
03:56 - controller so that we can manipulate
03:57 - them and reference them and now you've
03:59 - done this before in the basic series so
04:01 - there shouldn't be any surprise but go
04:03 - to the system editor view I'm running
04:05 - out of space so I'm just going to hide
04:09 - this little shelf there remember you use
04:11 - these buttons as you need them okay now
04:15 - you want to be looking at the header
04:17 - file and you hold down control click the
04:20 - UI element and drag and you get this
04:23 - blue line and put it right under the
04:25 - interface then we're gonna call this the
04:26 - roll button so it's automatically
04:30 - created an iboutlet for me to reference
04:32 - that element and do the same thing for
04:35 - the label hold down control drag it over
04:38 - i'll call this the sum label and i'm
04:42 - gonna do it for this first to die and
04:46 - call it first die view and do it for the
04:51 - second one then call it second die view
04:56 - now you can see here in the header file
04:58 - that xcode is complaining about these
05:01 - two properties because it doesn't know
05:03 - about the die view class what we have to
05:05 - do is type this import statement in here
05:09 - to import the header file of the die
05:12 - view so that this file this view
05:14 - controller file can go look at die view
05:16 - dot h and kind of see what sorts of
05:19 - methods it has what sorts of properties
05:21 - it has and generally just to be aware
05:23 - that there is a class like that and now
05:25 - it won't complain anymore okay so now
05:27 - we've got all of our properties hook
05:29 - doesn't I hope that was pretty easy to
05:32 - follow along and I appreciate you guys
05:34 - watching please share it with any of
05:36 - your friends or colleagues who are
05:37 - interested in iPhone development and
05:39 - help me spread the word and as usual the
05:42 - notes are in the description below as
05:44 - well as the link to the source code and
05:46 - the image assets thanks for watching bye
05:49 - bye
