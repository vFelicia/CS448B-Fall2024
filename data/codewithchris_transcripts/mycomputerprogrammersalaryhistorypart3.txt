00:04 - um but I was going to take a break so I
00:06 - talked to one of the co-founders and I
00:08 - told him you know what I really need to
00:09 - take two months off
00:12 - um I don't know if I'm going to come
00:14 - back I told him and you know he said
00:19 - okay he was nice about it he said okay
00:20 - do it because I was one of the more
00:22 - senior people there and
00:26 - um my intention for taking those two
00:30 - months off was to reset myself ask if
00:32 - this was really what I wanted to do and
00:34 - also um give YouTube a chance Believe It
00:37 - or Not by this time I had started my
00:38 - YouTube channel I think I uploaded a
00:40 - handful of videos maybe five or 10 IOS
00:43 - uh programming videos and I wanted to
00:45 - see if I could uh make it a full-time
00:47 - income um through ad Revenue so I think
00:50 - at that time I might have been making $8
00:53 - a day or something like that in ad
00:55 - Revenue so um in the two months I I
00:58 - wanted to publish more and try to make
01:00 - it a full-time job well I couldn't so in
01:03 - 2 months I decided to go back I was
01:06 - refreshed and I decided I was going to
01:08 - climb that kind of climb that ladder at
01:10 - that consulting company and uh make my
01:13 - money like that um through through a
01:16 - good career a good position and so I was
01:18 - doing that I was
01:19 - working I was working at that company uh
01:22 - what I started at 70k and I was slowly
01:25 - making my way up I think I got up to 80k
01:29 - so after I came back I had a cooworker
01:31 - who engaged the Head Hunter and that
01:34 - head hunter found a bank who gave him an
01:36 - offer of 100K so my coworker told me
01:39 - Chris why don't you hook up with this
01:41 - Head Hunter and see what he can get for
01:43 - you as well so I did that and I got
01:45 - something similar and you know what we
01:48 - actually really enjoyed working at that
01:49 - Company B and so I said why don't we
01:53 - take these offers up to the boss and see
01:55 - what he says so that's what we did and
01:58 - we talked to him uh we told them we
02:00 - really like working here but this salary
02:03 - Gap is just too huge right if the market
02:05 - thinks that's what we are worth you know
02:08 - we're only getting paid this much I
02:09 - think at that point I was getting paid
02:10 - 80k I'm not sure what he was getting
02:12 - paid uh but the boss agreed you know to
02:15 - bump us up to 100K and and that was that
02:18 - it was as easy as that so I got to stay
02:20 - at that company doing iOS uh getting
02:23 - paid just got a big salary bump you know
02:26 - and I think I stayed there for about 3
02:28 - years in that process I watched the
02:31 - company grow from 12 to 70 people and we
02:33 - moved offices three times and also I
02:38 - brought on my wife to work at the same
02:40 - company believe it or not as a project
02:42 - manager so we worked together for a good
02:45 - year and uh it was very interesting but
02:47 - that's a story for another time if you
02:49 - guys want to hear it let me know in the
02:50 - comments below uh so that's where I
02:53 - stayed but during this whole time for
02:56 - that last year out of those three years
02:58 - um you you know how in the 2 months I
03:00 - left I was working on YouTube and all of
03:04 - that so when I came back you know for
03:06 - that year that next year I was
03:09 - continuing to do YouTube I was
03:10 - continuing to publish articles and stuff
03:12 - and little by little you know you guys
03:14 - started watching me and subscribing and
03:17 - so I built a little bit of an audience
03:18 - and what I discovered was that you guys
03:20 - were actually willing to pay to learn
03:22 - iOS and there was actually this one guy
03:25 - who followed one of my tutorials at that
03:27 - point it was kind of like a dice game
03:29 - like a ice rolling game and he posted
03:31 - this Vine which I don't know how much
03:34 - longer Vine is going to exist for but he
03:36 - posted a Vine maybe I'll pull it up for
03:38 - you guys of uh what he built following
03:40 - my tutorials and that satisfaction that
03:42 - I felt
03:44 - um no number of apps that I could build
03:47 - for any client could match that type of
03:50 - satisfaction it's it's a different type
03:52 - of satisfaction and I never knew before
03:55 - why teachers wanted to teach you know
03:59 - but at that point I I knew why it was
04:02 - just this great feeling to me it might
04:05 - sound weird to you but to me um having
04:08 - someone learn programming it felt like I
04:10 - was teaching this little kid to walk um
04:12 - and it made me feel really good so I
04:15 - thought if I could do this full-time and
04:17 - I could do this for a living you know
04:19 - even if I wouldn't make as much money as
04:21 - I did you know I I would rather do that
04:25 - so that's what I
04:26 - did um and luckily it was okay with my
04:30 - wife I decided that you know I would
04:32 - give myself 8 months we had savings she
04:35 - still had her job and uh we would try
04:38 - this so for eight months I produced more
04:40 - videos produced more articles and did
04:42 - some courses and uh yeah from that point
04:46 - I had enough confidence to continue on
04:49 - so uh thank you thank you guys yeah
