00:00 - this lesson is going to be more of an
00:02 - exercise because we will recreate
00:04 - spotify screens from scratch hello and
00:06 - welcome to learning design the course
00:08 - where i share my learnings on becoming a
00:10 - better app designer this exercise is
00:12 - going to be a two-part lesson or two
00:14 - videos the first one which is this video
00:16 - will focus on recreating the media
00:18 - player screen from spotify the second
00:20 - video which will be released two weeks
00:22 - from now will be about recreating the
00:24 - lyric screen and not only that in the
00:26 - second video we'll also learn how to
00:28 - animate between the music player and the
00:30 - lyrics screen as you can see right here
00:33 - so it's pretty exciting right well if
00:35 - that's the case let's start learning
00:36 - design
00:38 - so before we get started you can take a
00:40 - screenshot of any song that you want to
00:42 - recreate in this exercise for me i have
00:45 - sunday morning by maroon 5 because it's
00:47 - one of my favorite songs well you can
00:49 - also download the resource file of this
00:50 - exercise down below if you want to
00:52 - follow along while using the same
00:54 - material so next let's have a quick look
00:57 - at our ui first
00:58 - so we have a lot of buttons
01:00 - icons and as you can see spotify is
01:02 - using quite a different font for the ui
01:05 - so first let's download the right
01:06 - plugins for this exercise which means
01:08 - that you should have your icons plug-in
01:11 - in my case i have the icons 8 plugin but
01:13 - any icons plugin that supports
01:15 - ios icons will do also there's a link to
01:18 - the ios 15 ui kit figma file in the
01:20 - description below for you to copy paste
01:23 - a few system elements that we'll be
01:25 - using in this exercise
01:26 - now since we're going to recreate or
01:28 - replicate this as closely as possible we
01:30 - need to use the right font so i
01:32 - mentioned a while ago that they're using
01:34 - a different font for the ui and the font
01:36 - that they're using is circular std so
01:39 - this should already
01:40 - come along with your free figma plan
01:42 - because figma provides you with like a
01:44 - thousand fonts
01:46 - and circular std should be one of them
01:48 - because i know that i don't have
01:50 - circular sad on my desktop but it's
01:52 - available on my figma file
01:54 - so if it doesn't show um you can just
01:57 - google circular std and you can download
01:59 - it for free now for the actual design
02:02 - let's set up our frame or canvas by
02:03 - pressing f and choosing an iphone frame
02:06 - i like to use the iphone 10 frame so
02:08 - we'll choose that for this exercise
02:10 - next let me just resize this um
02:12 - reference image because it's too big
02:14 - it's occupying more than half of our
02:16 - workspace let me just resize this pick
02:17 - it smaller
02:19 - and done
02:21 - next let's choose the right background
02:23 - color
02:24 - and while we're at it let's create some
02:26 - shapes with colors in it so that we can
02:28 - easily access them when we need to use
02:29 - the eyedropper tool
02:31 - now if you look closely the background
02:33 - color of the screen is in a gradient
02:35 - type so the color sort of transitions
02:37 - from medium red to dark red so for our
02:40 - first shape it will be the medium red
02:43 - the second shape will be dark red
02:48 - and our third shape will be the
02:50 - combination of these two in the form of
02:52 - a linear gradient so to do the linear
02:54 - gradient style we just need to click the
02:56 - color settings change this from solid to
02:59 - linear
03:01 - and then we will use the eyedropper tool
03:03 - to apply the medium red
03:05 - and dark red colors to our gradient
03:08 - after that once we have the gradient
03:11 - applied to our third shape right here we
03:13 - will just save this as a style so we can
03:16 - apply it to our background
03:18 - and
03:21 - done we now have an exact duplicate of
03:23 - the apps background
03:25 - next let's design the header now the
03:28 - spotify screen has the downwards chevron
03:31 - the name of the album of the song
03:33 - and a more button for other settings
03:36 - so to do this we just need to open our
03:38 - icons plugin of choice and look for a
03:40 - download chevron and while we're at it
03:43 - why don't we look for other icons as
03:45 - well so we don't have to look for them
03:46 - later on
03:47 - so we have the more icon let's also look
03:50 - for the heart icon
03:52 - shuffle
03:53 - previews
03:55 - pause
03:56 - next
03:57 - repeat
03:58 - share list
04:00 - expand and bluetooth
04:03 - so make sure to organize them properly
04:05 - because we want a clean workspace
04:07 - so let me just organize them
04:10 - accordingly
04:11 - and voila
04:13 - so from here what i always want to do
04:15 - when designing a ui is to copy and paste
04:17 - the status bar and home indicator from
04:19 - the ios 15 ui kit that's available in
04:22 - the figma community so like i said a
04:24 - while ago the link to this ui kit is
04:26 - available in the description so once
04:28 - you're inside the file just look for the
04:30 - status bar and home indicator
04:32 - copy both of them and paste them to your
04:34 - artboard
04:36 - all right so before we put the actual ui
04:38 - elements on this frame let's first
04:40 - create the margins for this ui
04:42 - in my case i'll pull up the grids and
04:44 - columns that i use in our design system
04:46 - so don't worry if you don't have these
04:47 - columns as well because this is just a
04:49 - guide for myself in the future lessons
04:51 - we'll tackle everything you need to know
04:53 - about creating a design system as well
04:55 - so stay tuned for that
04:57 - meanwhile you just need to make sure
04:59 - that your rulers are turned on if
05:01 - they're not just press shift r and from
05:03 - there just click and drag from the left
05:05 - side of the ruler to activate a
05:08 - marginal line
05:09 - so so once you click and drag from the
05:11 - left side of the ruler just drag it to
05:13 - the frame
05:14 - until
05:16 - um
05:16 - it's sort of like 20 pixels from the
05:19 - left
05:19 - and create another one so 20 pixels from
05:22 - the right so this gives our design some
05:24 - breathing space which is essential for
05:26 - ui design
05:29 - now let's design the header by putting
05:31 - the chevron inside the frame before we
05:33 - do that as you can see right here our
05:35 - background color is a bit dark it's a
05:37 - bit dark red
05:39 - and we want to make sure that we have
05:40 - enough contrast for our ui elements so
05:43 - since our background color is dark our
05:45 - ui elements should be in the light side
05:47 - of things
05:48 - so that means our icons should be in
05:50 - white our text should be in white and
05:52 - all those sort of things so in that
05:53 - regard we'll first change the colors of
05:55 - our icons so as you can see right now
05:57 - it's all black so let's first select
05:59 - them all and change them all to white
06:01 - just like that and now we're ready to
06:03 - use them for our design now let's design
06:05 - the header by putting the chevron inside
06:07 - the frame so look for the chevron that
06:09 - we got from our icons plugin drag it
06:12 - inside the frame and done
06:14 - now for the album name let's just type
06:15 - it here
06:16 - the album name is songs about jane
06:19 - etc etc change the font to circular std
06:23 - change the font to medium
06:26 - so let me just put this below the album
06:28 - name of our reference material just so
06:30 - we can gauge how big
06:31 - the font should be so i think maybe it
06:34 - should be size nine so let's change the
06:35 - font size to size nine
06:38 - and then after awards let's just put it
06:40 - back on the frame
06:41 - and let's align the album name with the
06:45 - chevron just make them vertically
06:47 - aligned also don't forget whenever
06:49 - resizing an icon don't forget to lock
06:51 - the proportions because we don't want
06:53 - them to mess up their dimensions and
06:55 - then let's just align them together that
06:57 - looks good let's put the more icon here
06:59 - as well so before we change its size
07:02 - make sure the proportions are locked
07:03 - first and then
07:05 - once that's locked we can change it to
07:08 - maybe around 24 pixels and we're done
07:10 - finally we just need to select all three
07:12 - of them press shift a to convert that
07:15 - into an auto layout make sure that the
07:17 - spacing is set to space between and once
07:20 - you do that
07:21 - we're done let's just make sure that
07:23 - this header is
07:25 - 44 pixels from the status bar to give it
07:28 - enough spacing so to do that we will
07:30 - just quickly create a rectangle that's
07:32 - 44 pixels in height and once you create
07:34 - that 44 pixel tall shape
07:36 - just make sure that the elements snap
07:38 - and done our headers all good now for
07:41 - the next part we are going to create the
07:43 - album art or place the album art on our
07:46 - design so for this one we just need to
07:47 - look for this album art on google
07:49 - because we don't have that saved in our
07:51 - desktop so google search songs about
07:53 - jane
07:54 - look for the highest resolution possible
07:57 - right click to copy the image and paste
07:59 - it to our figma workspace
08:02 - so next let's just resize it to fit
08:04 - inside our margins and add a stroke
08:07 - while we're at it now for the color of
08:09 - the stroke we'll use our handy
08:10 - eyedropper tool and selecting this um
08:13 - pastel color around the album art from
08:15 - our reference material so we can set the
08:17 - stroke thickness to maybe 20 center and
08:19 - we're good to go our album art is done
08:22 - but wait um as you can see
08:24 - the stroke goes beyond the margins that
08:27 - we've set for this ui so a quick fix to
08:30 - this will be to reduce the width of our
08:32 - or reduce the size of our um album art
08:35 - to maybe around
08:37 - um 315 by 315 pixels and see if
08:42 - the
08:43 - outer line of the stroke aligns with the
08:46 - margins left and right and that's done
08:48 - it's that simple so what we're going to
08:50 - do next is to recreate the media
08:52 - settings and of course put the name of
08:53 - the song and the band among other things
08:55 - so let's type in sunday morning and
08:57 - change the fonts properties we'll set
08:59 - the song title to bold and maybe reduce
09:02 - the letter spacing to negative one
09:05 - percent its size to 18.
09:09 - now don't forget to
09:11 - adjust the spacing between the
09:14 - album art and the sunday morning text or
09:16 - the song title so let's make sure that
09:18 - this is around 48 and then let's type in
09:21 - the maroon 5 text by duplicating this um
09:25 - song title
09:26 - and then changing the text to maroon 5
09:29 - and also we need to change the
09:30 - properties of this text so let's change
09:33 - this to light size 14 and at zero letter
09:37 - spacing and that's good so let's just
09:39 - convert them into auto layout by
09:41 - pressing shift a and done
09:44 - and of course we also need to put that
09:46 - um heart or favorite icon beside these
09:50 - details so but before we put our icon
09:53 - here
09:54 - we first need to press shift a again on
09:57 - our existing auto layout frame and make
09:59 - sure that the direction will be
10:02 - horizontal and from there we can now
10:04 - drop the heart icon in the frame and our
10:06 - heart icon will be placed instantly
10:09 - beside this um song details now from
10:12 - here we just need to make some
10:13 - adjustments on the auto layout frame so
10:15 - we'll adjust the sides on left and right
10:18 - we need to make sure that they will snap
10:20 - the edge of our canvas so not the
10:23 - margins the red lines so we will adjust
10:25 - this on to the
10:27 - edge of our canvas or artboard or our um
10:30 - frame and then adjust the padding from
10:32 - there so make sure that it's 20 on the
10:34 - left and 20 on the right and on the top
10:37 - will be
10:38 - maybe 32 and bottom will be 32 as well
10:41 - so from there we can just
10:43 - snap it right below that um album art
10:46 - and there you go so so that's our song
10:49 - details with the um heart icons so
10:53 - next thing we're going to create is the
10:55 - media slider so just select your line
10:57 - tool or press l and then put it right
11:00 - below the song details that we just
11:02 - designed and then change the color of
11:04 - this line
11:05 - so right now i so right now i'll change
11:07 - the color of design to maybe match our
11:09 - reference material so make it a bit
11:11 - translucent
11:12 - and then i'll adjust the thickness of
11:14 - this line to maybe five and then i'll
11:17 - change the starting and end points of
11:18 - this line to round and then from there
11:21 - we'll adjust the color
11:23 - and transparency and make it a bit
11:25 - transparent to reduce the transparency
11:27 - to maybe 44 and then adjust the
11:30 - thickness to three and then just make
11:32 - sure that the line will snap
11:35 - to our margins on the left and right so
11:37 - it will it should snap on the red lines
11:40 - on the left and right and then from
11:41 - there i'm going to duplicate this and
11:43 - resize the width
11:45 - so maybe change it to around 30 pixels
11:48 - and width and change the color of this
11:50 - um line this duplicated line
11:54 - to
11:54 - maybe around white but not pure white
11:56 - maybe something around
11:58 - um
11:59 - with a tinge of red to make it a bit
12:01 - more
12:02 - modern
12:03 - and then from there i'm going to create
12:05 - a circle so open up your ellipse tool by
12:08 - pressing o and create a circle maybe
12:10 - around 32 by 32 pixels
12:12 - and then from there let's make sure that
12:14 - the circle will be in the same color as
12:17 - the um
12:18 - bright line that we just created
12:20 - and then maybe resize the circle to 16
12:25 - just make it suitable for the slider and
12:27 - then align them properly so from there
12:29 - we'll type in the timestamps so type in
12:32 - 19 seconds
12:35 - and type in the minus 3 45 minutes
12:40 - and then make sure that they are aligned
12:42 - so this one you can rely on the
12:44 - align bottom
12:46 - and from here i'm gonna convert the
12:48 - slider to frame instead of a normal
12:50 - group
12:51 - because we want to have that flexibility
12:53 - of adjusting their bounding box
12:56 - so i'm going to adjust the
12:58 - bottom padding of the song details we
13:00 - designed a while ago
13:02 - so that the slider will be able to move
13:05 - higher without merging with the frame
13:07 - above it
13:10 - now let's
13:12 - i'm gonna
13:13 - i'm gonna put the timestamps
13:16 - a few pixels up as well so reduce their
13:19 - size and adjust their size to maybe 12
13:22 - or maybe 10 and adjust the um font
13:25 - weight
13:26 - and the color as well
13:30 - so let me just do some adjustments here
13:33 - and there you go so for this one make
13:34 - sure to select both timestamps and press
13:36 - shift 8 convert that into auto layout
13:39 - and make sure to adjust the left padding
13:41 - to 20 right padding 20 as well
13:44 - and make sure that they are spaced
13:46 - between from there we can adjust the
13:47 - boundaries of this frame of this other
13:50 - layout frame and let them snap to the
13:52 - edges of our ui frame and maybe adjust
13:55 - the bottom padding as well
13:57 - because there will be elements right
13:59 - below it we want to have enough space so
14:01 - we're almost halfway through our media
14:03 - settings so for the second half which
14:05 - are the
14:06 - main media controls
14:08 - um since we organized them already a
14:10 - while ago there's the beauty of
14:11 - organizing stuff what's left for us to
14:13 - do is to drag them into the frame and
14:15 - double check on the sizes make sure that
14:17 - the pause or the middle button
14:20 - is emphasized
14:22 - because it's the
14:23 - main
14:24 - button in this instance and the
14:27 - previous next will be secondary and the
14:29 - shuffle and repeat will be tertiary
14:31 - buttons so let's
14:33 - adjust the size of this let's also
14:35 - adjust the size of the shuffle and
14:36 - repeat buttons so make them smaller
14:39 - and then from there
14:42 - make sure to um align them
14:44 - horizontally so from there we'll convert
14:46 - them into an auto layout frame and for
14:48 - now we'll pack them in the center we'll
14:50 - make some adjustments later on
14:52 - so
14:53 - let's adjust the bounding box of this
14:56 - auto layout frame to the edge of our ui
14:58 - frame
14:59 - and then just
15:01 - let it snap right below that um media
15:04 - slider or the timestamp so from here i'm
15:06 - going to change the properties again of
15:08 - this media controls to
15:10 - space between instead of middle pack in
15:12 - the middle and then i'm going to put 20
15:15 - for the left and right padding and then
15:17 - what i'm going to do next is to select
15:19 - these three main controls and then press
15:21 - shift a again to convert them into an
15:22 - auto layout so the reason we're doing
15:24 - this is because
15:27 - we want to separate these three main
15:29 - controls from the shuffle button and
15:30 - repeat buttons on the side so so if we
15:33 - don't frame this three buttons then all
15:34 - of the five buttons in this row will
15:37 - have equal space between each other
15:38 - which would lessen the emphasis that we
15:40 - want to have in this role so i'm going
15:42 - to select them and adjust the spacing
15:44 - accordingly to my taste
15:46 - and then we're done for our media
15:48 - controls so next thing i'm going to do
15:50 - is to drag and drop our bluetooth icon
15:52 - to the frame and type in jc's airpods
15:55 - pro so i'm going to change the color of
15:57 - this as well so i'm going to use our
15:59 - eyedropper tool and select the color of
16:02 - the color green from our reference
16:04 - material so that we will have the same
16:06 - color
16:07 - so change this colors as well and from
16:10 - there i'm going to resize the bluetooth
16:11 - icon maybe to
16:13 - um 20 because it's not that important so
16:16 - from here i'm going to select the
16:17 - bluetooth icon in the blue deflex and
16:20 - together i'll convert them into an auto
16:21 - layout frame and then from here
16:24 - um i'll make the necessary adjustments
16:26 - so the spacing between them will be four
16:29 - and then i'll change the font properties
16:32 - to light or maybe something lighter
16:34 - just to de-emphasize this booth
16:36 - indicator because it's not that
16:38 - important and then from there i'm going
16:40 - to drag and drop our few remaining icons
16:42 - our share button and our list button
16:44 - right beside that bluetooth indicator so
16:47 - i'm going to resize the share and list
16:49 - icon as well maybe around 20 as well
16:52 - because they are not important on
16:54 - buttons so we want to have that visual
16:56 - hierarchy and then from there i'm going
16:58 - to select the um share and this icon and
17:00 - convert them into an auto layout frame
17:02 - from there once i resize them i'm going
17:04 - to select all of them and i'm going to
17:06 - convert them into auto layout by
17:08 - pressing shift a again and then from
17:09 - there i'm going to adjust the bounding
17:11 - box of this other layout frame and snap
17:13 - them to the sides of our ui
17:15 - and make sure that they are spaced
17:17 - between so let's zoom out a little bit
17:19 - and see our work so far so it's looking
17:21 - great and looking exactly like the
17:22 - spotify ui that we have so we just need
17:25 - to recreate the lyric section but as you
17:27 - can see we don't have enough space down
17:29 - here for the lyric section so we'll need
17:31 - to resize the frame but before we do
17:33 - that we need to first find our home
17:35 - indicator layer on our layers panel and
17:37 - make sure that the constraints will be
17:39 - left and bottom so that
17:42 - so this will make it stay at the bottom
17:44 - whenever we resize the frame
17:46 - so once that's done we can now resize
17:48 - the bottom of the frame by simply
17:50 - dragging it and as you can see the home
17:52 - indicator stays at the bottom because of
17:54 - the constraints that we set earlier now
17:57 - for our lyric section what i'm going to
18:00 - do first is to create a frame
18:02 - press f and make sure that it snaps to
18:05 - the
18:06 - both margins and then from here let's
18:08 - add a color
18:09 - red
18:11 - oops not this red
18:15 - this bright red make sure that it's
18:16 - bright red and also we'll adjust the
18:19 - corner radius of this to maybe four
18:22 - make it a bit similar to the corner
18:24 - radius of this um
18:27 - um lyrics section from our reference
18:29 - material then from there we'll type in
18:31 - the lyrics label
18:32 - like the title of this section and maybe
18:35 - change this to bold
18:37 - resize this to maybe 12
18:40 - and there you go
18:42 - then let's just reposition this maybe
18:44 - here
18:45 - and then we'll just make some
18:47 - adjustments later on then next thing i
18:49 - want to do is to um create the more
18:52 - button right here so type in more
18:55 - um bold i think bold is okay or medium i
18:58 - think bold is but much better let's just
19:00 - make it a bit smaller
19:02 - so size
19:03 - 10 i guess or size 9
19:06 - or maybe size 10 is okay
19:08 - then from here we don't have i think we
19:10 - deleted
19:11 - we accidentally deleted the expand icon
19:14 - so we'll look for it again in the icons
19:15 - eight plugin and
19:18 - there you go
19:19 - so from there we'll just resize this or
19:23 - first change its color to white
19:25 - and then resize this to maybe 16 or even
19:29 - 12.
19:30 - let's make it a bit smaller because it's
19:32 - um a secondary button so from here make
19:36 - sure to select both of them so the more
19:37 - and the enlarged icon so press shift a
19:40 - then from there make sure that they are
19:43 - um
19:44 - packed in the middle
19:45 - and the spacing will be 12 on the sides
19:48 - and four on top and bottom so we can
19:51 - tweak this later on so maybe we can
19:53 - remove um
19:55 - we can apply some color first this
19:56 - medium red and then from here we'll
19:59 - change the corner radius to 50
20:02 - and that's good
20:04 - so i think that's a lot closer to our
20:07 - reference image and then from here let's
20:09 - select the lyrics and this more button
20:11 - and press shift a and this converts into
20:13 - an auto layout header so from here make
20:15 - some changes so spacing will be space
20:18 - between and the left padding will be 12
20:20 - 12 and um i think we can keep it to zero
20:24 - or maybe um 16 or maybe 12 here and then
20:27 - 16 at the bottom yeah that's right maybe
20:29 - 20. and from there we'll adjust the um
20:32 - size of this
20:33 - other layout frame make sure it snaps to
20:35 - the edge of this um lyrics frame just
20:37 - resize it and that's good and from here
20:41 - we don't have the
20:42 - um lyrics so let's just look for let's
20:44 - just google sunday morning lyrics and
20:46 - then just copy paste half of this um
20:49 - lyrics because we can just delete this
20:51 - later on so copy it and then paste it
20:53 - here and as you can see we already have
20:55 - it formatted in the right setting i will
20:58 - just change the alignment to left align
21:01 - and then maybe
21:02 - size will be 13 or maybe 20 and then
21:05 - change the letter spacing to maybe 100
21:08 - oops
21:09 - to zero percent or 120
21:13 - and then just make sure that this will
21:15 - be in an auto layout frame again so
21:18 - press shift a make sure that it will
21:19 - snap on the edges of this frame make
21:22 - sure that it will snap right below this
21:25 - header as well so as you can see the
21:26 - blue box is here it will just snap it
21:28 - right
21:29 - there let's make some adjustments let's
21:31 - make sure that we have enough space for
21:33 - our text so let's remove the percentage
21:37 - let's just change this to 140 or maybe
21:40 - 100 make it more accurate maybe 4 oops
21:42 - maybe 40 40 is good or maybe 35 and
21:46 - that's a lot better and then spacing
21:48 - will be one percent i guess yeah that's
21:51 - good as you can see we have the red
21:53 - spacing on one line for yeah sunday
21:55 - morning we don't we didn't copy this a
21:57 - music icon and it's okay because it's
21:59 - just a program in spotify we didn't have
22:02 - that when we copy pasted it so still
22:03 - some covers sharing skin clouds are
22:05 - shouting us in and next line will be
22:07 - moments are forgettable from here um
22:09 - we'll recreate this share icon so what
22:11 - we're going to do is just duplicate this
22:13 - more icon and command d and just drag it
22:16 - right here so let's just change the text
22:19 - to share and
22:21 - then let's just duplicate this share
22:23 - icon and command d
22:25 - and just drag it away from that frame
22:27 - and just drag it inside this beside the
22:30 - share or maybe right here
22:32 - and just delete this expand icon and
22:35 - resize this to maybe 16
22:38 - or 12
22:39 - 16 yeah i think that's okay yeah 16 is
22:42 - much better and let's change this
22:44 - spacing four
22:46 - and this one to four as well and there
22:48 - you go
22:49 - so from here as you can see we didn't
22:51 - have enough padding here so let's change
22:54 - this back to
22:56 - zero and then the padding will be let's
22:59 - go to the frame make sure that you're
23:01 - selecting the frame and not the text
23:02 - padding will be
23:04 - 14
23:05 - 14 and let's reduce the letter spacing
23:09 - and go back to our and select the text
23:11 - tool go back and make sure that this
23:14 - is fill container
23:16 - so that it will automatically wrap um
23:19 - inside this um lyrics frame
23:23 - so as you can see we don't have any
23:24 - overlapping elements when we click on
23:26 - them so from here let's just resize this
23:28 - frame by dragging this um
23:30 - line and we can also reposition this
23:32 - frame right below this row
23:35 - maybe select them both and make sure
23:37 - that the spacing between this will be
23:40 - like divisible by four so maybe 24
23:43 - is good or even 20 is good or even 16.
23:46 - yeah 16 is good from there um let's just
23:49 - resize this frame adjust this here and
23:51 - remove this text let's just cut it to
23:54 - the moment's unforgettable part and from
23:57 - here
23:57 - let's remove this text zero
24:00 - make sure it's a bit closer maybe
24:02 - negative three and then
24:04 - if we can make this a bit larger twenty
24:06 - one um each other one's good so from
24:08 - here as you can see the share is not
24:10 - inside the lyrics frame so if we
24:13 - um check our layers you can see the
24:15 - share frame
24:16 - let's name this to share
24:18 - it's not inside the lyrics frame this is
24:21 - the lyrics frame
24:22 - so we need to put this inside this
24:24 - lyrics frame just drag it inside here
24:27 - and there you go just make sure that
24:29 - it's aligned properly just let this
24:31 - software do the snapping for you because
24:34 - they will tell you if it's aligned or
24:36 - not
24:36 - then from there
24:38 - we can change this uh the color of this
24:41 - button you can just remove it simply and
24:43 - then apply a stroke and maybe white
24:48 - and there you go you can also change the
24:51 - thickness of the stroke to maybe 0.5 and
24:53 - there you have it now we can resize this
24:55 - frame again so our space should be 12
24:57 - and now we have a 12
25:00 - we'll use this um rectangle as a guide
25:02 - so it's 12 pixels all so we'll just let
25:05 - it snap and there you go
25:07 - and remove this then from there as you
25:09 - can see we have this um faded text
25:11 - effect so what i'm going to do is to
25:13 - lock this frame first and then create a
25:15 - rectangle make sure it's red and then
25:17 - from there let's just adjust the size
25:20 - properties of this and then check the
25:22 - color settings change this from solid to
25:24 - linear and then you can switch this to
25:27 - end points so this one will be
25:29 - the zero percent setting so this one
25:31 - will be in zero percent and this one
25:33 - will be in full color actually from here
25:36 - all you need to do is just drag it up
25:38 - and
25:39 - make sure
25:41 - that it will cover this moment's
25:43 - unforgettable part
25:45 - all right there you have it so
25:47 - this is just a simple faded text effect
25:50 - but that um we can change we can change
25:53 - later on so we'll make some further
25:55 - changes here so for the lyrics let's
25:57 - lock this rectangle first so we don't um
25:59 - select it accidentally
26:01 - so change this colors to um
26:04 - black
26:05 - or maybe dark red use the eyedropper
26:07 - tool and select this one
26:09 - and there you have it and going back to
26:11 - our faded gradient just put it right
26:14 - here lock this lyrics frame and then
26:18 - adjust the size of this rectangle and
26:20 - then maybe we can change the gradient
26:22 - effect here just make sure that it's a
26:24 - bit closer to the starting point just
26:27 - like that it doesn't have to be perfect
26:29 - but i think it's a lot closer to our
26:31 - reference material
26:33 - so from there let's just
26:36 - frame this again because the gradient
26:39 - effect is now a part of this lyrics
26:41 - frame so this will be lyrics master from
26:43 - here let's just
26:45 - realign this make sure that it snaps to
26:47 - the edges
26:49 - and we are done
26:51 - just some final touches maybe height
26:54 - will be 44 and resize the screen and
26:57 - there you have it that's our spotify ui
27:00 - alright so we've successfully created
27:02 - the first and main screen of our spotify
27:04 - music player for our next lesson we'll
27:06 - quickly go over how to recreate the
27:08 - lyric screen and from there learn how to
27:11 - animate between this music player and
27:13 - the lyric screen so just like what
27:15 - you're seeing right here
27:17 - so if you've encountered some challenges
27:19 - while designing this along the way well
27:21 - don't worry because i shared this figma
27:24 - file as a resource document for this
27:26 - lesson so feel free to download that to
27:28 - study the design yourself or if you have
27:30 - any more questions feel free to post on
27:32 - code google forum and we'll be happy to
27:35 - accommodate your concern so stay tuned
27:37 - for our next lesson which will go live
27:39 - in the next two weeks in the meantime go
27:41 - ahead and practice your design skills by
27:43 - recreating other apps that you like or
27:45 - restudying this lesson so with those
27:47 - things said i hope you learned something
27:49 - and i'll see you in the next video
