00:00 - hey code crew how's it going in this
00:02 - firebase crash course we're going to
00:04 - learn how to set up your firebase
00:05 - database and also how to create data
00:08 - read data update and delete data as well
00:10 - now the initial setup of the firebase
00:13 - database may be a little bit
00:15 - intimidating especially if you haven't
00:17 - worked with firebase before but don't
00:19 - worry
00:20 - that's why I'm here after that though
00:22 - the actual code to read data and create
00:25 - data is pretty simple so sound good
00:27 - alright let's get started
00:31 - so first of all go to firebase Google
00:34 - comm and then click on the sign up or
00:36 - login button in the upper right corner
00:38 - in this case I'm already logged in next
00:41 - we're going to create a new project by
00:42 - clicking the add project button and then
00:44 - you're going to give your project a name
00:46 - it doesn't really matter what it is this
00:48 - is just for identification inside your
00:50 - firebase dashboard next click create
00:52 - project
00:56 - after you're in click on the iOS icon
00:59 - where it says add firebase to your iOS
01:01 - app
01:03 - it's going to launch a wizard that walk
01:05 - you through the next step which is to
01:06 - add the fire based code libraries also
01:09 - known as the SDK to your Xcode project
01:11 - the first step however is to register
01:14 - your app and you're going to need the
01:15 - iOS bundle ID of your app now I'm going
01:18 - to type mine in right now because I know
01:20 - what it's going to be but when we create
01:23 - our Xcode project in the next section
01:25 - I'll point out to you where your bundle
01:27 - ID will be as well so I'm going to type
01:29 - comm code with chris dot firebase
01:32 - crash-course I'm going to give the app a
01:34 - nickname and then I'm going to click
01:36 - register app alright so now let's jump
01:40 - on to the next step where we create our
01:42 - Xcode project and I'll show you where
01:44 - your bundle ID will be so you can go
01:46 - ahead and register your app
01:49 - now let's create our brand-new Xcode
01:52 - project we're gonna choose single View
01:54 - app under iOS and for the product name
01:58 - I'm going to put firebase crash course
02:01 - but you can put whatever you'd like this
02:03 - product name together with the
02:04 - organization identifier is put together
02:07 - to create your bundle identifier as you
02:09 - can see on the screen
02:16 - and again you'll notice the bundle ID
02:18 - there in the project properties and then
02:21 - you're going to go ahead and close the
02:23 - Xcode project now it's time to use
02:25 - cocoapods
02:26 - to install the firebase SDK if you're
02:29 - new to cocoapods it's simply a tool that
02:31 - helps you easily install and manage
02:33 - third-party libraries for your Xcode
02:35 - projects I have a detailed video about
02:37 - how to install cocoa pods on your
02:39 - computer here so go ahead and do that
02:41 - first if you don't have cocoa pods
02:42 - installed already so assuming that you
02:45 - have cocoa pods installed the next step
02:48 - is to open up terminal and navigate to
02:50 - your project directory
02:54 - type in pod in it to set up your project
02:57 - to use cocoapods
02:59 - and now if you navigate to the project
03:02 - folder you're going to see a pod file
03:06 - this is where you specify the
03:08 - third-party code libraries your app will
03:10 - use so open this up in your text editor
03:13 - and then add these following lines pod
03:17 - firebase core
03:24 - and pod fire based database save the
03:28 - file and then close it then back in
03:31 - terminal type in pod install press ENTER
03:35 - and cocoa pods will read the new entries
03:37 - and go fetch those code libraries for
03:39 - you now this might take a few minutes so
03:42 - don't worry if there's no indication
03:44 - that anything is happening now after
03:46 - it's done open up the XC workspace file
03:49 - from now on this is the file you want to
03:53 - open to launch your Xcode project
03:54 - because LLL include your third-party
03:56 - libraries
04:00 - now going back to the firebase setup
04:02 - wizard the next step is to download the
04:04 - Google service info.plist this
04:07 - configuration file contains all of the
04:09 - information that your app needs to
04:12 - connect to the firebase API and to
04:14 - access our database then click and drag
04:16 - this Google service info.plist file
04:19 - directly into the file Navigator of your
04:22 - Xcode project now make sure copy items
04:24 - if needed is enabled and also add to
04:27 - targets is checked on as well click
04:29 - finish and we're done with this step
04:36 - now the last step is simply to
04:38 - initialize firebase when the app is
04:40 - launched and we can do that inside the
04:42 - app delegate we're going to need to add
04:44 - an import firebase statement at the top
04:47 - and then also a firebase app that
04:49 - configure a line in the app delegate so
04:52 - let's go ahead and do that
04:55 - now sometimes when you type in import
04:57 - firebase the Xcode project is going to
05:00 - complain that it can't find it just
05:01 - press command B to build your project so
05:05 - that Xcode knows that those libraries
05:07 - are there
05:14 - and then the last step the wizard is
05:18 - going to try to verify your installation
05:20 - by listening for a connection so launch
05:23 - your Xcode project and run it in the
05:24 - simulator now for me I had to do this
05:27 - several times you might need to stop the
05:29 - project and then rerun it a couple of
05:31 - times to get this working but once you
05:35 - do you can get a little green checkmark
05:38 - back in the wizard finally click
05:41 - continue to console and with that you're
05:43 - finished with the setup now let's take a
05:45 - tour of the database
05:48 - in the firebase console click on the
05:50 - database tab that's gonna bring you to a
05:52 - page where it's talking about the cloud
05:54 - fire store which is kind of their next
05:57 - version of the real time database the
05:59 - only thing is it's in beta right now so
06:01 - I would recommend that you start with
06:03 - the real time database if you scroll
06:05 - down a little bit once you get the hang
06:07 - of using this it is not too late to
06:10 - learn about cloud fire store and
06:12 - hopefully by then it's gonna be out of
06:14 - beta
06:15 - so the real time database is what I'm
06:16 - going to be talking about today click on
06:18 - create database now here you can start
06:20 - in locked mode or test mode and I choose
06:22 - test mode whenever I'm developing an app
06:24 - because it's just easier enough to have
06:26 - to worry about permissions or anything
06:28 - like that it makes your database public
06:30 - and you can just worry about doing the
06:32 - database transactions and then after you
06:34 - finish your app you can go ahead and
06:36 - turn it into locked mode alright so now
06:38 - you have your real time database you'll
06:39 - notice that it's not your traditional
06:42 - rows and columns one thing you have to
06:45 - realize is that data is stored in JSON
06:47 - format in the firebase database if
06:49 - you're new to JSON that I recommend
06:51 - checking out this video which I've
06:52 - linked to basically data is stored as a
06:55 - series of key value pairs a single key
06:58 - value pair contains a key and a value
07:00 - now this is an example of a key value
07:02 - pair an employee ID with the name of an
07:05 - employee as you can see a key is some
07:09 - sort of ID and the value can either be a
07:11 - piece of data or actually the value can
07:15 - be another key value pair or a whole
07:17 - bunch of other key value pairs as I
07:19 - demonstrate here
07:28 - you
07:33 - now the employee ID is the key and the
07:36 - value as a whole group of key value
07:37 - pairs which contains information about
07:39 - that employee in the end it's like a
07:42 - tree of nested key value pairs that's a
07:45 - short introduction to JSON for more
07:46 - information check out the video I link
07:48 - to in the description below now let's
07:50 - take a look at writing to the database
07:55 - inserting data into the database is
07:57 - pretty easy first specify that you'll be
07:59 - using the classes in the firebase
08:01 - libraries by using an import statement
08:03 - at the top next you're going to create a
08:06 - database reference
08:15 - then specify the key path to the
08:18 - location you'd like to insert data to
08:19 - the key path is exactly like it sounds
08:22 - it's just a series of keys leading to
08:24 - that location
08:26 - and call the set value method
08:31 - inside the set value method you're
08:33 - setting the value part of the last key
08:35 - or key path so if you'd like to create a
08:38 - new key you can just specify it at the
08:39 - end of your key path and I'll create it
08:41 - and set the value to it
08:45 - if you'd like to Auto generate a random
08:47 - unique key instead you can use the child
08:50 - by Auto ID method
08:53 - and then call the set value method to
08:55 - set a value for that auto-generated key
09:04 - you
09:22 - next let's take a look at reading data
09:26 - with reading data you can either
09:28 - retrieve the data once or you can
09:30 - specify an observer so that you get
09:31 - notified of data changes in real time in
09:34 - this QuickStart tutorial we're only
09:36 - going to be walking through retrieving
09:38 - the data once and in a future video we
09:40 - can cover observers okay so once again
09:43 - make sure you have the import statement
09:45 - at the top create a database reference
09:47 - and then specify the key path to the
09:49 - location you want to read from
09:55 - and then called the observe single event
09:58 - method in this method you can specify
10:03 - what you're retrieving in this case we
10:05 - want to retrieve the value of that key
10:07 - path then in the second parameter you
10:09 - can specify a closure which is the block
10:12 - of code you want to run when the data is
10:14 - returned the closure has a data snapshot
10:16 - parameter that contains the results of
10:18 - the database call from this data
10:21 - snapshot object the results of your
10:23 - query are in the value property
10:27 - remember when I told you about key value
10:30 - pairs and how the value part can
10:31 - actually contain another key value pair
10:33 - or even a bunch of key value pairs well
10:36 - if it's a single value type you can just
10:38 - cast it to whatever data type that is
10:39 - and use it
10:50 - however if it's one or more
10:52 - then you can cast it as a dictionary and
10:55 - then get the pieces of data you need out
10:57 - of the dictionary
11:03 - I'll have to do a more detailed video on
11:05 - retrieving data because there's so much
11:07 - to talk about here including sorting and
11:10 - filtering for this QuickStart we'll
11:11 - leave it at this basic data retrieval
11:13 - use case now let's take a look at
11:16 - updating data
11:19 - for updating data you can use the set
11:22 - value method as well make sure you have
11:25 - the import statement at the top create
11:27 - the database reference specify the key
11:31 - path
11:35 - and then use the set value method to
11:36 - update the value for that key
11:40 - there's also another method called
11:42 - update child values that lets you update
11:44 - several values at once simply create a
11:47 - dictionary with all of the updates and
11:49 - pass it into the update child values
11:51 - method
11:59 - you
12:17 - for deleting data there's a method
12:20 - called remove value again make sure you
12:23 - have the import statement create the
12:25 - database reference specify the key path
12:34 - and then call remove value it's going to
12:37 - delete the key as well so there you have
12:40 - it if you liked this video make sure you
