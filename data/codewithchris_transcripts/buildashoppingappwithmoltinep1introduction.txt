00:05 - hey coders I hope you guys are all doing
00:07 - well today we're going to start building
00:09 - our shopping app and we're going to do
00:11 - that by leveraging Molton so Molton
00:13 - provides all of the infrastructure for
00:15 - the e-commerce side of things so as you
00:17 - can see here it provides support for
00:20 - inventory cart checkout payments and it
00:23 - exposes all of that stuff through an API
00:25 - and we can focus on building our app and
00:28 - all we need to do is make calls to
00:30 - retrieve the list of products to manage
00:32 - the cart and all the way to checking out
00:34 - in this video I'm going to walk through
00:36 - some of the features that molon provides
00:38 - uh we're going to take a look at the
00:39 - dashboard where we're going to add
00:41 - products and configure our store specify
00:44 - payment gateways and stuff like that I'm
00:45 - going to give you a brief look at the
00:47 - molten API and finally we're going to
00:50 - look at some sites that are using molten
00:52 - to power their e-commerce stores so
00:54 - first off let's take a look at the
00:55 - features that Molton offers
01:00 - so as I mentioned it provides Inventory
01:02 - management it gives you a dashboard
01:04 - which you're going to see in a second
01:05 - where you can add all of the product
01:07 - details the product images and stuff
01:09 - like that and because you're building
01:11 - your own front end and all you have to
01:13 - do is make API calls to manage your cart
01:16 - you can structure your checkout
01:17 - experience any way you like and then
01:20 - there's that dashboard which is called
01:21 - Forge so through this dashboard you can
01:24 - view and manage your inventory your
01:25 - customers and your orders and the
01:27 - details of your store
01:30 - because Molton stores all of this data
01:32 - from your product information customer
01:34 - information and your store details you
01:36 - can build e-commerce apps on any
01:38 - platform and simply use API calls to
01:41 - retrieve that data so as you can see
01:43 - here from this photo you can build a web
01:44 - app you can build a tablet phone app all
01:46 - of them are working with the same
01:48 - backend system and you can view all of
01:49 - that stuff through your dashboard so
01:51 - let's take a look at that dashboard
01:53 - right now so I've got my store here
01:57 - which is pretty much a brand new empty
01:59 - store so so on the first screen this
02:01 - overview you can see your inventory your
02:03 - orders how much revenue you've made and
02:05 - stuff like
02:07 - that this is where you're going to
02:09 - customize your inventory you can specify
02:11 - categories products and all the stuff
02:13 - you would expect from managing your
02:15 - store's
02:16 - inventory second of all you've got your
02:19 - customers and you can see right now I
02:21 - don't have
02:23 - any orders same thing uh but this is
02:26 - where it gets interesting you can
02:27 - specify your shipping rules your taxes
02:30 - your currencies and here they support
02:33 - over 50 different gateways which you can
02:35 - add so by setting up your payment
02:36 - Gateway here when you create your iPhone
02:39 - app or your web app or anything like
02:41 - that you can just use an API call send
02:44 - those credit card details over to Molten
02:46 - and it can get processed by the payment
02:48 - gateways that you specify here so all of
02:50 - the data that you configure here all of
02:52 - the products you add in your inventory
02:54 - all of these transactions and stuff like
02:56 - that are available through the API and
02:59 - for our demo app we're going to be
03:02 - adding some products to the inventory so
03:04 - that we can use this API here to
03:06 - retrieve those products and display it
03:08 - in our iPhone app so you can see here
03:10 - there are some calls for example you can
03:12 - get products by ID or by criteria uh you
03:16 - can even create products you can update
03:17 - and delete products so the API provides
03:20 - a lot of flexibility to interact with
03:22 - your store there are calls to work with
03:25 - products there are calls to do checkout
03:27 - to manage your cart working with your
03:28 - customers and so so on and so forth so
03:30 - in the demo app you're going to see a
03:32 - little bit of all of these calls so the
03:34 - main benefit I see from using molten is
03:36 - that it does all of the heavy lifting
03:38 - for you on the e-commerce side so you
03:40 - don't have to worry about writing code
03:42 - to manage a cart writing code to
03:43 - interact with a payment Gateway or
03:45 - anything like that you have this nice
03:47 - dashboard which you you can customize
03:49 - all of that stuff and then you get this
03:51 - nice API to work with all of your data
03:54 - and what's more if you're building apps
03:55 - on multiple platforms like a web app a
03:57 - mobile app let's say an Android app and
03:59 - all that stuff you only need one
04:01 - instance of your molten backend you have
04:03 - the same dashboard that you're seeing
04:05 - all of your data and you've got this API
04:08 - which all of those platforms can work
04:10 - with so to stress that point I want to
04:12 - show you two examples of sites that are
04:15 - using molten right now and take a look
04:18 - at how different they are they're both
04:20 - using molten but their checkout
04:22 - experiences and their store experiences
04:24 - are completely different so you can
04:26 - focus on the front
04:28 - end so for example
04:30 - this store sells shoes and if I click
04:32 - into this
04:35 - product you can see that uh it's a full
04:39 - screen kind of gallery experience right
04:42 - and if I select the size here and then I
04:44 - add it to the cart see what happens so I
04:47 - have this sort of cart slide out when I
04:50 - hit check
04:51 - out I get to a form like
04:54 - this now in contrast take a look at this
04:57 - one which is also powered by multi
05:00 - and let's say I want to buy a
05:04 - jacket I'm going to select the
05:07 - size uh add to
05:11 - cart and I'm going to check out and you
05:14 - can see that this one this checkout
05:15 - experience is kind of in line on this
05:17 - panel they're both using molten but even
05:21 - the shopping experience and the checkout
05:22 - experiences are very
05:25 - different the best part of it all is is
05:28 - that if we go back
05:30 - to the main site here and we look at
05:33 - pricing they've actually got a free tier
05:36 - and it's free forever as it says here uh
05:39 - you get 30,000 API requests per month so
05:43 - how much is that it says here that you
05:46 - can expect to use around three requests
05:48 - per page or in our case doing an iPhone
05:51 - app it may be uh per view so this plan
05:55 - will get us roughly 10,000 views per
05:58 - month which is pretty nice to start and
06:00 - presumably if you're showing products
06:02 - that people can buy a portion of those
06:04 - people will buy your products and you
06:06 - will be making money so maybe then you
06:08 - could scale it up and pay the next one
06:10 - $49 a month which gets you 10 times more
06:13 - API requests and so on and so forth but
06:16 - it's nice that they have a free tier
06:18 - which you can work with and play around
06:20 - in with no risk whatsoever for the demo
06:22 - that we're going to do my primary focus
06:24 - is to show you guys how to set up a
06:26 - store uh how to add some products how to
06:28 - leverage the AP to make calls to
06:30 - retrieve your products retrieve product
06:32 - details add a product to a cart and then
06:35 - check out so I'm not going to be focused
06:37 - on the user experience and the UI I'm
06:40 - going to leave the front-end user
06:42 - experience to you and your imagination
06:44 - so in our demo we're going to be just
06:46 - leveraging basic labels table views
06:48 - image views and stuff like that but I
06:50 - hope that once you see how easy it is to
06:52 - work with the API and set up your store
06:54 - you're going to be able to integrate it
06:56 - into your own shopping app okay so in
06:58 - the next video we're going to get
06:59 - started by setting up our xcode project
07:01 - see you guys tomorrow
