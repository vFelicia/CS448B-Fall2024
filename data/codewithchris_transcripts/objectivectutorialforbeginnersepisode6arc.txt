00:07 - hey guys welcome to episode 6 of learn
00:09 - objective-c and today we're going to be
00:13 - talking about automatic reference
00:15 - counting otherwise known as arc yay okay
00:20 - so this is the project that we had from
00:22 - the last episode on memory management
00:25 - and I've just colored it with some
00:27 - comments here to remind you guys about
00:29 - what's going on so just the quick recap
00:33 - I allocated a new instance of my class
00:36 - here and then I declared a second
00:40 - variable and assigned it that instance
00:41 - as well and I called release on it which
00:46 - would decrement the counter by one and
00:48 - this retain statement incremented by one
00:51 - and then I can still use my second
00:54 - reference variable because the retain
00:58 - counter is the one who hasn't been
01:00 - deallocated yet but then here in this
01:04 - last statement if I forget to release it
01:06 - then that object would get stranded and
01:08 - it would have a memory leak so with all
01:11 - of these you know retain releases you
01:14 - can see how prone it is to error and
01:17 - we're only looking at one method wait
01:20 - till you start passing objects around to
01:22 - other methods and you know stuff like
01:24 - that so with iOS 5 apple introduced arc
01:27 - or automatic reference counting and that
01:29 - saves you from having to write all of
01:31 - these retaining release statements what
01:34 - happens behind the scenes is actually
01:36 - when you compile your app all of those
01:38 - retain and release statements get
01:40 - dynamically injected into your code so
01:43 - it's not a garbage collection system
01:45 - don't think of it like that mark merely
01:48 - saves you from having to write all of
01:50 - the retain and relief statements so why
01:53 - don't we go ahead now and kind of set up
01:55 - the same project but ark enabled and we
01:57 - can see what the difference would be
01:59 - okay so let's create that new project so
02:04 - I go file new project I'd created a
02:07 - single View application before and I'm
02:11 - going to call this one
02:14 - what we call the other one memory
02:17 - management it's called this one arc so
02:21 - all you have to do to make your project
02:23 - ark enabled is make sure that this box
02:25 - is checked off use automatic reference
02:28 - counting I'm just going to create a new
02:36 - folder for it okay so we've got our new
02:48 - project so let me start by creating a my
02:51 - class and then what did we have in here
03:03 - before we had a method called do
03:07 - something which I am going to put back
03:13 - up wrong file should be doing it in the
03:16 - header file and then here in the
03:22 - implementation file I had all of this
03:24 - stuff so all of that remains the same
03:29 - dialogue still gets called so with our
03:33 - queen ever have to call the parents
03:36 - dialogue method it actually does it for
03:37 - us so I can safely remove the statement
03:40 - but I could still have this dialogue
03:44 - method override and I can still provide
03:46 - custom code in here alright so let's go
03:48 - in the implementation file for the view
03:51 - controller so we started off by
03:56 - importing my cloths and then we created
04:04 - you know what so you guys don't have to
04:06 - watch me type I'm going to copy and
04:09 - paste it from here and just modify the
04:11 - code so first of all and an ark enabled
04:18 - project remember that the retain and
04:20 - release statements get injected for us
04:22 - so we don't actually have to call any of
04:26 - it we will need square brackets here and
04:41 - that's it so contrast this project that
04:46 - we built in ark vs the other project
04:49 - where we managed memory manually and you
04:51 - can see how much of a help arc is so I
04:55 - want to make one thing clear when I say
04:56 - that arc was introduced in iOS 5 that
05:00 - does not mean that you can't build apps
05:02 - targeting you know iOS four and below
05:05 - all that means is that if you want to
05:07 - use dark you got to be building your app
05:09 - on iOS 5 SDK or greater and if you're
05:14 - just starting out with iOS development
05:16 - that shouldn't be a problem because if
05:17 - you download xcode these days you're
05:19 - gonna have I OS 6 SDK pre-installed all
05:23 - right now for your fact of the day so
05:25 - these days it seems that Apple and
05:27 - Samsung are the two big smartphone
05:30 - manufacturers you know with Samsung in
05:33 - their galaxy series and iPhone well with
05:35 - their iphones but what's ironic is that
05:38 - Samsung actually manufactures some of
05:42 - the parts that make up the iphone so the
05:45 - the retina screen and the processor
05:48 - found in your iphone is actually
05:50 - manufactured by samsung well who woulda
05:53 - guessed so who you guys think about that
05:56 - let me know in the comments section
05:57 - below all right I'll talk to you guys
06:00 - later
06:13 - you
