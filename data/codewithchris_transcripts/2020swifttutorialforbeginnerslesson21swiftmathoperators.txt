00:04 - in this quick video I'll be going
00:06 - through some of the basic math
00:07 - operations that you can do with
00:09 - constants and variables and just in
00:11 - general equations so why don't we do
00:16 - pretty basic stuff right here and add
00:19 - two numbers together using the addition
00:21 - operator so this is probably what you'd
00:24 - expect you know but there are a couple
00:26 - of them that you might not realize so
00:28 - that's why it's important to go through
00:30 - it
00:30 - there's plus there's - it's gonna get
00:33 - zero from that and there's also a
00:36 - multiplication using the asterisks and
00:42 - there's division and then you can also
00:49 - change these together if that wasn't
00:50 - obvious so we could do something like
00:53 - this okay so you'd get eight
00:59 - alternatively we can use the power
01:01 - function to do Exponential's and that
01:04 - that is that looks like that and it
01:06 - accepts two doubles so this would be the
01:09 - base and this would be ^ we can do two
01:13 - and three but notice that it accepts a
01:18 - double right so if I try to run this
01:21 - right now I'll still get eight so that's
01:23 - fine too I was just worried that these
01:26 - guys were actually integers so these
01:29 - were detected as integer types instead
01:31 - but that's that's awesome
01:33 - there's square root just to show you a
01:36 - couple other ones and some that you
01:41 - might not be familiar with
01:42 - there is ceiling which basically rounds
01:45 - up so if I just had let's say bar D is
01:49 - equal to five point or four point five
01:53 - let's put D in there see what we get you
01:57 - know that that would be five right
01:58 - because it rounds four point five up and
02:00 - then there's also floor which runs down
02:04 - so if we do that you would get four from
02:07 - four point five and next I want to show
02:09 - you the increment or decrement shorthand
02:12 - because that might not
02:13 - be immediately obvious and I tend to use
02:16 - it a lot it's actually very useful so
02:19 - let's say you want to do something like
02:20 - a equals a plus one because you want to
02:25 - increment a by one so you'd get three
02:29 - right so you're basically taking a
02:32 - adding one to it and then reassigning it
02:35 - back to a so if I printed this out well
02:38 - yeah we can just look at the preview
02:41 - window here if I ran this you would see
02:43 - three here on the side
02:45 - now another shorthand way of writing
02:48 - this is just to go a plus equals one
02:52 - like that and this would give you four
02:54 - now right because we're incrementing it
02:56 - again the reason this shorthand exists
03:00 - is because you tend to do this a lot
03:02 - when you're expressing your logic and
03:05 - your writing algorithms and your code
03:08 - incrementing and decrementing tends to
03:10 - happen a lot so that's why that exists
03:13 - you can also decrement like that
03:16 - so decrementing by one now a would be
03:19 - three right this is equivalent to
03:23 - writing a equals a minus one and this is
03:27 - equivalent to writing a equals a plus
03:30 - one so if you see me doing that in code
03:33 - now you know what it means
