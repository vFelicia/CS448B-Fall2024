00:00 - hi my name is Chris and I'll teach you how to 
build an IOS app that displays YouTube videos of  
00:04 - you're choosing in this example I've configured 
this app to fetch videos from my how to build  
00:09 - an app in 8 Days playlist and display all the 
videos from there the great thing is that this  
00:14 - app actually connects to the YouTube data API 
so if you remove or add videos to the playlist  
00:20 - on YouTube it'll automatically get reflected in 
the app without you having to revise any sort of  
00:26 - code oh and you'll also be able to tap into the 
videos and watch the videos in the app or to read  
00:31 - the video description okay so let's take a look 
now at what skills you'll gain after completing  
00:36 - this app all right so by completing this app 
you're going to learn how to work with the  
00:40 - YouTube data API you're going to learn how to 
send and receive Network requests to and from  
00:46 - your app and in doing so you're going to learn a 
little bit about iOS concurrency especially using  
00:51 - async weight and through the process of doing 
this we're going to need to be able to debug  
00:57 - and troubleshoot our network issues and we're 
going to learn how to do that using proxy man  
01:02 - a free thirdparty tool when we get the data back 
from the YouTube API we're going to need to turn  
01:07 - that Json and parse it into usable structures 
and instances inside our app so you're going  
01:13 - to learn about Json parsing and how to do that 
and we're also going to need to store our API  
01:19 - key securely in our xcode project so that it 
doesn't accidentally get leaked out now most  
01:24 - of this networking stuff we covered in the iOS 
networking course so although we are going to go  
01:31 - over that again in this video series it won't be 
as in-depth so if you really want to learn that  
01:37 - material well and you want to dive a little deeper 
check out the networking course all right now on  
01:43 - the IOS app side we are going to use YouTube 
player kit which is a thirdparty library to be  
01:49 - playing the YouTube videos in the app and we're 
going to import that into our xcode project using  
01:55 - Swift package manager now on the UI side you're 
going to learn how to use Swift UI lists geometry  
02:02 - reader async image progress view scroll views 
just to name a few but there's a lot more that  
02:07 - goes into building the user interface and you're 
going to get extra practice just working with uis  
02:14 - Okay so let's do a quick little overview of how 
this all works in case you're new to working with  
02:18 - apis and if you have used apis before then 
this will just be a little review for you  
02:24 - now an API is an interface that you can connect 
to to send and receive data to put it in simply  
02:30 - terms you can think of an API as a collection 
of URLs that your app can access to retrieve  
02:36 - data or to send data now there are many apis out 
there some are free and some are paid but most  
02:41 - of the large platforms like Facebook X Spotify 
Google they all have apis for you to work with  
02:47 - that platform or to retrieve data from it and 
there are some apis that are just data focused  
02:53 - such as retrieving uh recipes or stock prices or 
weather data things like that so being able to use  
03:01 - apis in your app is very very powerful so what 
actually happens and how do you use an API from  
03:08 - your app well from your IOS app you send a network 
request to an API endpoint which remember is just  
03:15 - a URL in your network request you specify what 
data you want to get back and in some apis you  
03:21 - also have to identify yourself in the request this 
identification part is called authentication the  
03:28 - API receives your request and it will authenticate 
you and also make sure that your request is valid  
03:34 - note that not all apis require authentication 
but most do now if your authentication checks  
03:41 - out and your request is valid then the API will go 
ahead and gather the data and send a response to  
03:47 - your app the response contains the data that 
you requested and it's typically in a format  
03:53 - called Json when your app receives the response 
it can read the Json formatted data and and then  
04:00 - convert it into Data that can be displayed on 
the screen for the user to see this process of  
04:06 - converting the Json data into usable data in your 
app this is called Json parsing all right so this  
04:12 - is the process that you're going to learn how 
to do with the YouTube API now let's take a  
04:17 - look at the YouTube API I hope you're enjoying 
the lesson so far now just in case you want to  
04:22 - launch your own app I want to tell you about 
cdb C+ this step-by-step program will help you  
04:27 - launch your own app even if you don't have any 
experience and it takes about 4 months if this  
04:32 - sounds like something you're interested in I have 
a special offer for you I'll leave the link in  
04:37 - the description below this video and hopefully 
I'll see you there if not no worries I really  
04:42 - appreciate that you're here watching this lesson 
and learning with us so thank you for that anyways  
04:47 - now back to the lesson all right so here we are 
the YouTube data API you can visit this page at
04:54 - developers.google.com I want you to go under 
this section that says add YouTube data and  
05:01 - click references and here you can see all of 
the endpoints that are available in this API  
05:07 - for our app to send a request to now remember 
these endpoints they're just URLs so let's take  
05:15 - for instance search so let's look at overview 
first this describes to you what this endpoint  
05:23 - does how you interact with it and it lists 
different methods different ways you can use this  
05:29 - end point so let's take a look at list okay when 
you click into that you can see that changed uh  
05:38 - to this section here and the common use cases 
okay so this is essentially searching YouTube  
05:45 - for something you can search by here are some 
use cases by keyword which is probably the  
05:50 - typical example right location Live Events or 
your videos for instance if you scroll a little  
05:56 - lower this is the important part here this is 
telling you the exact URL that you need to hit  
06:02 - so this is the endpoint and this is the request 
type so when you send a network request it can  
06:10 - be one of a couple a few different types and 
get is the one that's typically used for when  
06:17 - you want to retrieve data from the API okay 
so not only do you need to send a request to  
06:24 - this URL but you need to specify parameters 
of your request remember remember if you're  
06:31 - searching for something on YouTube what are you 
searching for you can't just say search right so  
06:37 - here these parameters they describe what you can 
specify along with your request in order to tell  
06:43 - the API what you want to retrieve or what you're 
searching for in this case so let's take a look
06:49 - here uh one thing I should mention here 
is in the parameter section there's always  
06:59 - they're not not always but there may be required 
parameters so remember in that overview I said  
07:06 - that the API checks a request to see if it's valid 
well if it is a required parameter then you have  
07:12 - to specify this information the optional ones you 
can leave out but the required ones you have to  
07:17 - include as part of your request so what is this 
required parameter okay so this part it's called  
07:23 - part this parameter specifies a comma separated 
list of one or more search Resource Property  
07:30 - that the API response will include set the 
parameter value to snip it okay so it's a  
07:38 - little hard to determine what these things 
mean but what I'll typically say is to try  
07:45 - it out you know the next step is to try this 
API let's set this parameter to snip it as  
07:50 - it says and then let's see what gets returned 
and if it's not what we're looking for we can  
07:56 - probably look at what else we can spe specify 
for this parameter now what I'm looking for  
08:03 - is if we want to search for something specific 
like a keyword what where would we do that or  
08:09 - what would we do so this is searching by location 
this is searching by event this is searching for  
08:16 - uh types of Channel a specific Channel you can 
look for um how many results you want uh this  
08:23 - is the one the CU parameter specifies the query 
term to search for so if you wanted to search  
08:29 - for uh videos regarding let's say uh gardening 
right you would put the gardening keyword in this  
08:37 - parameter and I'll show you a little later how you 
assign that data to these parameters but we're not  
08:43 - going to dive that deep just wanted to give you an 
overview of the YouTube API and all the endpoints  
08:49 - that are available and also how these endpoints 
work right so you learned about the URL this is  
08:56 - the URL that you're going to send the request 
to this this is your request type and there are  
09:01 - required parameters that you have to specify and 
then there are optional ones that would give more  
09:07 - context for your request now the Endo that we are 
going to use in this video series um remember so  
09:14 - this app it can display any YouTube video uh and 
it can play it in the app so for my use case I  
09:24 - want to display a list of videos from a specific 
playlist because I have a YouTube channel and uh  
09:32 - I have some playlists that I want to display 
the videos for so the Endo that I'm going to  
09:37 - use is playlists right here and I'm going to use 
um actually I I believe it was I can't remember  
09:47 - if it was playlists or videos at this point okay 
so let's take a look at this endpoint so here is  
09:53 - the playlist endpoint get and if we take a look at 
the use case let's see it retrieves all playlists  
10:02 - or yeah all playlists for a channel that's not 
what I want um this one is let's see the request  
10:12 - that I use retrieves a specific playlist and I 
believe it was this endpoint because there is  
10:18 - let's see the ID specifies being retrieved yeah 
this is what I used okay so instead of retrieving  
10:29 - all all playlists from the channel I wanted a 
specific one so I had to include this parameter  
10:37 - here which was called ID and this is the ID of the 
specific playlist that I want and then within that  
10:43 - playlist I also got the videos after you complete 
this video series and you follow along and you  
10:49 - learn how to use this YouTube data API feel free 
to change the way that the app works right you  
10:57 - can Implement search in your app if you'd want 
just put a text field right when the user types  
11:03 - something in call this um call this uh endpoint 
pass in the keyword that the user searched for  
11:11 - and return a list of video results and the user 
can play it right in the the app right the what  
11:18 - I'm going to show you in the video series is using 
this endpoint showing a specific list of videos  
11:24 - um or you can create your own playlist or maybe 
create uh specific videos that you want to show  
11:31 - and you might use another endpoint so feel free to 
customize the app but I would recommend especially  
11:37 - if you're new to working with apis and networking 
to follow along in this video series wait till  
11:42 - the end get comfortable after you've achieved the 
result and then customize it all right now let's  
11:48 - take a look at authentication because this YouTube 
data API needs to identify who you are before it's  
11:54 - going to give up its data now before I show you 
the YouTube authentication Part I I want to point  
11:59 - out this line right here these endpoints they all 
have a quota impact and it tells you how much it  
12:04 - costs to send a request and to get a response from 
this endpoint and that has everything to do with  
12:09 - the authentication stuff so now let's move on to 
there now we're going to click on guides typically  
12:16 - with API documentation all the authentication 
stuff is all the way at the beginning so here it  
12:22 - tells you how to do that let's go into overview 
uh actually let's go into get off CR itial here  
12:31 - and you'll see that there are two different types 
that you can two different techniques that you can  
12:36 - go about this so one is ooth and one is API Keys 
now most apis will use one or the other sometimes  
12:44 - both but uh if I were to throw out a number out 
there I would say 90% of apis you can use API  
12:52 - keys let me explain briefly the difference 
between the two so API key Authentication  
12:59 - is where you sign up for an account and they give 
you a long string of letters and numbers that is  
13:04 - your key and when you're making Network requests 
to the API you're going to specify that key with  
13:10 - your request and that way they can associate that 
request with your account and then they can also  
13:18 - rate limit you they can see how much you're using 
the API if you're abusive if you are yeah mostly  
13:27 - rate limiting giving you uh quota and things like 
that because you can imagine if it's unlimited and  
13:36 - as fast as possible and everyone is hitting their 
API it could take it down or the server load could  
13:43 - be too high so this allows them to control access 
to their API and if they find you to be abusive  
13:50 - they could ban your key and you won't be able to 
make requests anymore so that that's how API key  
13:57 - authentication works now o off is a little bit 
different this is where you typically see um a  
14:04 - username and password box in your app and the 
user has to sign into their Google account and  
14:09 - by doing that they are obtaining a token from the 
API and then you attach that token to the requests  
14:19 - that you send so there's a distinction because 
now they're associating those requests with the  
14:26 - user's Google account so no longer are you being 
rate limited it's not counting towards your quota  
14:33 - it's counting towards their quota and also what 
you can do is different because now that Google  
14:40 - can identify their Google account that user can 
perform things like liking a video or subscribing  
14:48 - to a video you can call those types of endpoints 
right or perhaps following a user whereas API key  
14:56 - access right all of your users they're using the 
same API key the one that's that you signed up  
15:04 - for that's associated to your account so that's 
why with API Keys you can't really do things like  
15:10 - liking a video or subscribing to a channel because 
the API has no idea who the user is they all they  
15:17 - can see is that they can associate this API key 
to your account that you created now ooth is a  
15:24 - little bit more involved so we're not going to 
use that in this video series we're going to go  
15:29 - through the API key route and learning how to 
do that is going to cover the vast majority of  
15:35 - apis that you'll encounter all right so now let's 
go on to the next step which is actually creating  
15:40 - an account and getting our API key so all you have 
to do is follow this credentials page link and I'm  
15:46 - going to open it in a new tab it's going to ask 
you to sign into to your Google account because  
15:51 - I'm already signed in it's brought me into this 
credentials page of my project you probably won't  
15:58 - have a project either so let me try to go back 
out onto the the dashboard and you might have to  
16:03 - go through some onboarding questions or something 
like that but eventually you'll arrive at a page  
16:09 - that looks like something like this because right 
here it's saying I have a project but you won't  
16:14 - have a project so it might prompt you to create 
a new project you can go ahead and do that or  
16:18 - you can click on this drop down up here um and 
then we can choose new project and we create a  
16:24 - project together oh it looks like I cannot create 
a new project but this is what you would do so you  
16:30 - would type in a project name you would uh I don't 
think this one matters too much so you can choose  
16:37 - whatever and just hit create and then once you've 
created a project right go ahead and navigate to  
16:43 - that project so for me that' be this one right 
here and you're going to click on credentials  
16:49 - or sorry API and services and then you're going 
to go down to credentials and then once you get  
16:56 - here this is where you can create the API key so 
you're going to say create credentials create API  
17:03 - key it's going to generate one for you and then 
you're going to have to restrict it to the YouTube  
17:10 - data API that would be good Let me refresh the 
screen did it do it for me there it is okay so  
17:16 - this is the new API key that was just created I'm 
going to click into it and then I am going to set  
17:25 - uh the restrict right here I'm going to restrict 
it to a specific API and the reason this is a good  
17:31 - idea is just so that if the API key gets into the 
wrong hands I mean it limits what they can do to  
17:38 - just using the YouTube data API and it's I think 
it's a good um it's a good practice to not just  
17:48 - give free reign to everything restricting things 
and um removing options is always good especially  
17:54 - if you don't need those options because it limits 
what can um it limits any unexpected Behavior same  
18:02 - thing goes for programming right and uh I wouldn't 
set restrictions on that you I mean you could do  
18:10 - this but it's going to get it might interfere with 
your testing especially if this is your first time  
18:16 - so let's just choose none restrict the key to the 
YouTube data API there's your API key right there  
18:21 - you shouldn't be showing this anyone uh I won't 
be using this key so don't try to copy it and  
18:27 - use this key I'll probably delete this after but 
go ahead and save it and there you go you have a  
18:32 - valid key that you can use and you're going to 
be using this key inside your iOS project all  
18:39 - right now we're set all right now we're ready 
to start using the YouTube data API in the next  
18:45 - lesson we're going to build a test project to 
connect to the API and retrieve data from it  
18:49 - if you like this video please give it a thumbs 
up and also comment down below what you're most  
18:54 - excited about learning in this app series thanks 
for watching and I'll see you in the next slide l
