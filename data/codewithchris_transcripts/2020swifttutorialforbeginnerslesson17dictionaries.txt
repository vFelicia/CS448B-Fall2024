00:00 - hi and welcome to my Swift tutorial for
00:02 - beginners in this video we're going to
00:04 - go through another collection type
00:05 - called the dictionary now these are
00:07 - really common especially when you're
00:09 - working with data from a remote database
00:11 - or from a third party API all right stay
00:15 - tuned I'm looking at the Swift
00:21 - documentation here and they give a
00:23 - really good example about the dictionary
00:26 - collection type and before we go into
00:28 - the actual example let's take a look at
00:30 - the differences between dictionaries and
00:32 - race which we went over in the previous
00:35 - lesson and talk a little bit about what
00:37 - makes them different and when you would
00:39 - use one over the other so in the
00:42 - previous lesson when we talked about
00:44 - arrays I said that it's kind of
00:46 - essentially a list of your data with
00:49 - order 0 all the way down sequentially
00:53 - now order matters write that data at
00:56 - index 0 is different from the data at
00:58 - index 1 2 or 3 the dictionary on the
01:02 - other hand is unsorted there is no order
01:05 - now how do you put data into a
01:07 - dictionary
01:08 - well data is put in as key value pairs
01:12 - so each piece of data that you put into
01:15 - the dictionary you have to give it an
01:17 - associated key to retrieve that piece of
01:21 - data later on think of it as kind of
01:24 - like well a dictionary where you have
01:28 - maybe the word being the key right when
01:31 - you're flipping through a dictionary or
01:32 - you're looking for the word the value
01:35 - that you get from finding that word is
01:37 - the definition so you can kind of think
01:40 - of it like that or in this case the
01:42 - example that they give is that the value
01:45 - is the airport name whereas the key is
01:48 - the airport code now one very important
01:52 - thing that I need to stress is that the
01:55 - keys have to be unique right or else
01:57 - it's not going to work if you have two
01:59 - different pieces of data with the same
02:01 - key how are you gonna distinguish
02:03 - between the two when you look them up
02:05 - now why don't we jump into the
02:06 - playground and let me show you an
02:08 - example of how to declare a dictionary
02:10 - and some of the ways that we can use it
02:12 - alright first let's declare a dictionary
02:15 - so I'm gonna say var my dictionary
02:21 - equals and just like an array you start
02:24 - with two square brackets like that and
02:27 - then inside you specify the data type of
02:30 - the key followed by a colon and then the
02:33 - data type of the actual value that
02:35 - you're trying to store so in this case
02:38 - I'm going to put string colon string
02:41 - which means that my keys are going to be
02:43 - strings and my values are also going to
02:45 - be string and just like you saw in the
02:49 - previous lesson about how to declare an
02:51 - empty array you can do the same thing
02:54 - I'm going to declare an empty dictionary
02:56 - just like this so essentially this is
03:00 - the type of the dictionary alright so
03:04 - let's go ahead and put some data into
03:08 - our dictionary so we're gonna type my
03:12 - dictionary and then we're gonna have two
03:14 - square brackets in an index you would
03:17 - put the index in here right well for the
03:20 - dictionary instead you put the key in
03:21 - here now our keys are strings right so
03:25 - I'm gonna go ahead and put a new string
03:29 - key in here and then assign it the value
03:31 - that is going to be associated with that
03:34 - key now the example that I want to use
03:37 - is cars and license plates because the
03:40 - license plates are unique as well so why
03:42 - don't we just make one up so let's say
03:45 - something like that and let's say that
03:47 - this is a red Ferrari and just like that
03:55 - I've put in some data into my dictionary
03:57 - with this associated key now how do we
04:01 - go ahead and retrieve that value well
04:04 - let's try to print that out first you go
04:09 - to my dictionary and then you put in the
04:11 - square brackets and you pass in your key
04:12 - so ours would be SJD two nine three so
04:17 - let's go ahead and print that so you can
04:20 - see that it is a red Ferrari
04:22 - notice that it's wrapped in here in an
04:26 - optional type the reason for that is
04:29 - because if you try and access let's say
04:33 - a key that doesn't exist let me just
04:35 - make something up let's just say one and
04:37 - there is no key in our dictionary with
04:40 - one you know as the key when you run it
04:44 - you actually get nil so that's why what
04:49 - you get from this is an optional type it
04:54 - could be a string or it could be nil all
04:57 - right so I'm going to write down some
05:00 - comments here assigning data into a
05:03 - dictionary this is declaring an empty
05:10 - string straight in dictionary this would
05:15 - be retrieving a value as optional string
05:28 - so typically when you try to retrieve
05:32 - the value for this key you would assign
05:34 - it to something like that let's say my
05:36 - car is equal to this and then you would
05:39 - have to check using one of those methods
05:41 - we talked in the optionals lesson like
05:44 - checking it against nil using equal
05:47 - equals or using optional binding or
05:50 - anything like that okay so how about
05:53 - placing the value for a key so let's say
05:59 - we changed cars but we kept the same
06:01 - license plate well in order to change
06:05 - the data for that key you would just
06:07 - assign it something different so let's
06:12 - call it block Lambo all right so just
06:17 - like that we've replaced the value for
06:20 - that specific key now let's say that
06:22 - you've sold the car and you've kept the
06:25 - license plate so here's how you remove a
06:28 - value for a key
06:37 - equals nil simply by assigning it now
06:40 - like that you're essentially removing
06:42 - the data for that key and the last thing
06:45 - I want to show you is how to iterate or
06:48 - go through the items of the dictionary
06:50 - and remember there is no order but we
06:53 - can still loop through the items of an
06:57 - of a dictionary by using the for loop so
07:03 - it would be for something right for
07:06 - something I'm not I don't want to write
07:10 - it right now I just want to fill in the
07:12 - other part for something in my
07:15 - dictionary and then in here do stuff for
07:19 - each item of the dictionary now what is
07:23 - this something in here well since
07:26 - dictionaries work in key value pairs
07:29 - right so we basically use something
07:33 - called a tuple and a tuple you can think
07:36 - of it as like a collection of variables
07:38 - and what we're going to put in here is
07:42 - let's say key and value so it's going to
07:45 - take each item out of the dictionary
07:48 - it's going to put the key into this
07:50 - variable and it's going to put the value
07:52 - into this variable all right so we can
07:55 - do something like this print key let's
07:58 - say I'll see what that does we should
08:02 - put another car in here
08:03 - just to make things a little more
08:05 - interesting let's just use
08:14 - [Applause]
08:16 - okay let's try to print this now so we
08:21 - get our two keys but we only have one ah
08:25 - that's because we're we removed this car
08:28 - for this key why don't we go ahead and
08:32 - comment that out so we still have two
08:35 - cars in our dictionary and why don't we
08:37 - run it now so now you can see the two
08:40 - keys we can also print out the value
08:43 - instead you'll see our two cars here now
08:49 - we can use them separately we can insert
08:55 - the key say is a value could do that
09:09 - so that's how you iterate through a
09:12 - dictionary so that pretty much wraps up
09:15 - using a dictionary and you will find
09:17 - that it will come in handy alongside
09:18 - using a race when it comes to organizing
09:20 - your data so if you liked this video
