00:00 - a coders what's up I'm Chris and welcome
00:08 - to episode two of the how to make a
00:10 - YouTube video app series in the previous
00:13 - lesson we had created the Xcode project
00:16 - together and I had also went through
00:19 - some of these files in the file
00:20 - navigator to explain what they're for
00:22 - and their purposes let me just pull up
00:25 - our demo app that I showed you yesterday
00:27 - for a quick second so yesterday after
00:30 - releasing that video I went back and I
00:32 - reviewed some of the code I wrote last
00:33 - year and to be honest some of the stuff
00:36 - is actually pretty complicated
00:37 - particularly the feed parsing and
00:40 - working with the YouTube API
00:42 - it gets pretty nitty gritty and I don't
00:44 - know if it's going to be for everyone I
00:46 - was wracking my head about how I was
00:48 - going to explain it because I want this
00:51 - series to be accessible to everyone and
00:53 - I want everyone who is watching this to
00:55 - be able to create an app that displays
00:57 - and plays YouTube videos so for example
01:00 - grabbing these videos dynamically and
01:02 - then parsing that video ID to grab the
01:05 - comments and grab the description that
01:07 - stuff was actually pretty involved so I
01:10 - think true to what I said I'm going to
01:12 - create a simple version first and what
01:14 - that's going to entail is a scrollable
01:17 - list of videos that look like this so
01:19 - we're going to be able to have the video
01:21 - thumbnail and title and stuff like that
01:23 - and when you click into it you're going
01:25 - to be able to play the video and you're
01:28 - going to be able to read the title in
01:30 - the description but the title and
01:32 - description will probably have to be
01:33 - hard-coded into the app rather than
01:36 - dynamically fetched through the YouTube
01:39 - API and if you're not familiar with the
01:41 - term API essentially it's just that
01:43 - Google has a bunch of URLs which you can
01:46 - hit and you can pass in IDs and stuff
01:48 - like that to get more information about
01:50 - any particular video or playlist or
01:52 - something like that but where the
01:54 - difficult part is is that you're going
01:57 - to have to sign up for a YouTube
01:59 - application so that you can get an
02:01 - application key so it knows who is
02:03 - calling those URLs and then when you
02:05 - call those URLs in the API to return
02:08 - data it returns it in the form of data
02:10 - feeds which kind of look like
02:13 - like this like this snippet of JSON here
02:16 - but imagine in a much larger file with
02:18 - lines and lines of this kind of stuff so
02:21 - our iPhone app is going to have to go
02:23 - through a file like this and basically
02:26 - extract out all the information that we
02:28 - need so I think end to end if I were to
02:30 - explain it properly the way I'd want to
02:33 - it'd probably take me somewhere around
02:35 - 20 videos to do to complete so what I've
02:39 - decided to do instead is is do a simple
02:42 - version which I think I can do in a
02:44 - handful of videos and that way very
02:46 - quickly you can have your own app which
02:48 - has a scrollable list of videos like
02:50 - this with thumbnails and stuff and you
02:52 - can click into it and then you can view
02:55 - details about this video and then you
02:56 - can click this and you can play the
02:58 - video in your app and I think that would
02:59 - be an awesome milestone for you guys to
03:01 - be able to hit first so in this video
03:03 - we're going to start by implementing
03:05 - this scrollable list which is
03:07 - essentially what's called a table view
03:09 - and I know that's kind of a funny name
03:11 - because it doesn't resemble a table at
03:13 - all but from here on out I'm going to
03:16 - refer to it as a UI table view or a
03:19 - table view so you know that I'm talking
03:21 - about this type of scrollable list and
03:23 - each of these thumbnails you see here is
03:26 - actually a table cell when you configure
03:28 - the basic table view it's just going to
03:30 - be a line of text and that's going to be
03:32 - your cell so we're going to have to
03:33 - customize the cell to display an image
03:35 - like this and all this fancy stuff here
03:37 - but let's jump back to our Xcode project
03:41 - and let's go into the main dot
03:43 - storyboard first so we've got an empty
03:46 - view here this is what you should be
03:48 - seeing with a view controller and if you
03:50 - don't have these panels on this I don't
03:51 - worry about it for now
03:53 - what you really need is this panel on
03:57 - the right hand side and this button
03:59 - expands or hides it and then down here
04:03 - you should be seeing a bunch of these
04:05 - elements and if you don't make sure that
04:07 - you're on the right tab here which is
04:09 - third one called the object library and
04:11 - furthermore your storyboard if you
04:15 - double click here you you're going to be
04:17 - zoomed out like this you want to double
04:19 - click an empty area to make sure you're
04:21 - zoomed in so you see the view controller
04:25 - in its full size because
04:26 - you won't be able to add any elements on
04:29 - to this view if you're in this sort of
04:32 - zoomed out view right here I'm going to
04:34 - double click an empty area to zoom back
04:36 - in and then down here I'm going to
04:39 - search for table view okay and it's
04:43 - going to reveal a couple of options what
04:45 - we want to choose is this one right here
04:47 - called table view not the table view
04:48 - controller we want to drag this table
04:51 - view onto your view controller it
04:54 - doesn't matter where you put it and if
04:57 - you can't place it into your view just
04:59 - double check that you're not in this
05:00 - zoomed out view right here double click
05:03 - any white area to zoom back in so the
05:05 - first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
05:07 - to click the table view so you can see
05:09 - all these little handles on it and then
05:11 - we're going to add some auto layout
05:13 - constraints so something that you should
05:15 - have went through in the start here
05:18 - lessons on my channel page but you go
05:20 - here click this menu and it's going to
05:23 - give you some options on how you want to
05:25 - position and size the table view so I'm
05:28 - going to uncheck constraint margins and
05:31 - I'm going to enable all four margins and
05:34 - I'm just going to put click these little
05:42 - dropdowns here sorry and choose view
05:47 - because I want to position that margin
05:50 - relative to the view and not the bottom
05:52 - layout guide so these ones should
05:56 - already be view the left and right it's
05:58 - just the top and bottom that have the
05:59 - layout guides I'm going to put them all
06:01 - to zero and then what I want to do also
06:05 - in this little drop-down is choose just
06:08 - choose all frames in containers and
06:10 - basically what this does is after you
06:13 - add these four constraints it's going to
06:15 - automatically apply those four
06:17 - constraints and it's also going to do it
06:19 - for all the other elements in your view
06:22 - so when you do that automatically you
06:25 - should see your table view take on those
06:27 - four constraints that you added and if
06:29 - you forgot to select this little
06:31 - drop-down for update frames don't worry
06:33 - you can manually do it so make sure that
06:36 - your table view is selected and then go
06:39 - here
06:40 - and you can choose update frames it's
06:43 - grayed out for me because my frames are
06:45 - already updated so now we have our table
06:48 - view conforming to the entire view this
06:50 - left-hand side is called the document
06:53 - outline and it's very helpful to see
06:55 - what sorts of elements you have in your
06:57 - view sometimes you have elements
06:59 - overlapping each other and they're hard
07:00 - to select or hard to click and you may
07:03 - not know that something is there but if
07:04 - you take a look at your document outline
07:06 - you're going to be able to see the list
07:07 - of your elements and basically it's also
07:10 - a sort of z-order or layering so
07:13 - anything that is closer to the top right
07:16 - here is at the bottom I know that's
07:20 - counterintuitive but if you think about
07:22 - the view as the bottom layer so the
07:26 - table view is on top of the view so
07:28 - anything you add below the table view
07:30 - will be actually on top of the table
07:34 - view if you don't see this document
07:36 - outline go down here there's a little
07:37 - icon here to slide it out next what we
07:41 - want to do is we want to add a reference
07:45 - to this storyboard element from our view
07:48 - controller because remember the view
07:49 - controller is where we're going to add
07:51 - all the logic to handle the user
07:53 - interaction and it's kind of going to
07:56 - supply the data for the view so right
07:58 - now the view controller not Swift class
08:00 - doesn't know anything about that table
08:03 - view because all we've done is added it
08:05 - to the storyboard so what we're going to
08:08 - do is add what's called an iboutlet
08:11 - to our view controller and that iboutlet
08:15 - is going to give us a reference to the
08:18 - table view so that the view controller
08:20 - can control the table view this was also
08:23 - done in the start here lessons on my
08:25 - channel page so you go up here click
08:27 - this what's called the assistant editor
08:29 - and if you're running out of space you
08:32 - can always hide that right panel so what
08:35 - I want you to do is click the table view
08:38 - either from the document outline or from
08:40 - the storyboard itself hold down control
08:43 - and then click and drag this little blue
08:46 - line over here and then let go I want
08:49 - you to call this you just call it the
08:52 - table view
08:53 - click connect' and now what has happened
08:55 - is that the view controller has a
08:58 - reference to this table view object in
09:01 - your storyboard and that name that it's
09:04 - going to reference that element is table
09:07 - view or whatever name that you gave it
09:09 - and actually here's where a lot of
09:11 - people get stuck connecting IB outlets
09:13 - and maybe potentially deleting this but
09:16 - when you run your app it's going to
09:18 - crash because you deleted it and maybe
09:20 - you added it again but you didn't remove
09:22 - the previous reference so I actually
09:24 - created a video it's called common
09:26 - mistakes with iboutlet properties which
09:29 - I'm going to link to here or at the
09:32 - bottom of the video as well and if
09:34 - you're having trouble creating this IB
09:36 - outlet or you're running into
09:37 - difficulties you racing the outlet
09:39 - maybe you spelled the name wrong and you
09:41 - want to redo it that video that quick
09:44 - video shows you how to do that and to
09:46 - make sure that you haven't done anything
09:47 - wrong and the app doesn't crash I want
09:49 - you to click this left-hand button that
09:52 - says build and run so what that's going
09:56 - to do is it's going to launch your
09:58 - simulator and it's going to launch your
10:01 - app you're going to see this sort of
10:03 - thing here right here says back to Tron
10:06 - videos but you won't have that so ignore
10:08 - that because I just launched this app on
10:10 - top of the other app so you're not going
10:13 - to have this back to Trump videos but
10:15 - you should see this sort of scrollable
10:16 - list and then you can use your mouse and
10:18 - you can click and drag you can scroll it
10:21 - now if you don't see this go back to
10:24 - Xcode if you see something down here
10:28 - like a bunch of text chances are that
10:31 - your app is crashed or if you see your
10:34 - Xcode project jump to a line and then
10:37 - it's highlighted green and it said Sega
10:39 - board or something like that
10:41 - that's a crash as well so chances are
10:43 - you you might have messed something up
10:45 - with the iboutlet so I would highly
10:47 - recommend you go to the common mistakes
10:50 - video which I'm going to link to to fix
10:52 - that problem okay so the last thing I'm
10:54 - going to do in this video is I'm going
10:56 - to stop the app right here by clicking
10:58 - this icon beside the play icon I'm going
11:00 - to go back to single view by clicking
11:03 - here standard editor
11:06 - I'm gonna go storyboard make sure I'm
11:09 - looking at the inspector pain okay what
11:12 - I'm going to do is I'm going to click my
11:13 - table view and on this tab right here
11:17 - there's a couple so make sure you're
11:19 - looking at the attributes inspector and
11:22 - I'm going to change this prototype cells
11:24 - to one and right away you can see that
11:28 - we have one cell and that's just going
11:31 - to be a basic cell with a label although
11:33 - you can't see the label now because
11:35 - there's no text in it but we're going to
11:36 - be customizing this prototype cell to be
11:40 - adding the image and all of that fancy
11:43 - stuff that you saw in the Trump videos
11:45 - app okay so this is a good stopping
11:47 - point for this lesson make sure that you
11:49 - are able to add table view add a table
11:52 - view cell and then furthermore hook up
11:54 - that table view as an iboutlet to your
11:56 - view controller and then run your
11:58 - project and make sure it doesn't crash
12:01 - okay thanks for watching and if you guys
12:04 - enjoyed it I hope you'll like subscribe
12:06 - and share it and I'll see you guys
12:08 - tomorrow at 12:00 eastern time bye for
12:10 - now
