00:00 - hello it's Chris here and welcome back to the how 
to become an iOS Developer series now if you've  
00:04 - missed the last few videos I'll link to them in 
the description this is video number four and  
00:09 - we're going to talk about how to get a job in the 
iOS industry and to be honest I've been out of the  
00:13 - job industry for a long time that's why I had to 
collaborate with someone who is in the thick of  
00:17 - it you might remember Ali who was an intern with 
us a few years ago well he's graduating now and  
00:23 - he already secured a job at a company whose core 
product is an app with over 16 million monthly  
00:29 - active users now this isn't luck that he landed 
this job when he shared his job hunting process  
00:34 - with me I was surprised at how meticulous it 
was with details such as which resume formats  
00:39 - to use how to bypass the popular job sites and 
go straight into the box of the recruiter what  
00:44 - technical skills to study for and how to behave 
in interviews among many more tips now in this  
00:51 - video I want to share some of those practical 
tips with you let's Dive Right In so there are  
00:55 - five major areas to Landing the job here's what 
they are here's the order you should do them in  
00:59 - and I'll tell you why in just a second so number 
one is resume development then online presence  
01:05 - applications technical skills and soft skills 
all right so why this specific order well that's  
01:11 - because this journey is intended to be taken 
after graduating from our launch your first app  
01:16 - program you don't have to go through our specific 
program but before you get to this career stuff  
01:21 - you should have the foundational iOS skills and 
you should have a few projects under your belt  
01:26 - so that there's something to put on your resume 
that's why we can start with resumé development  
01:31 - and online presence now another question is why 
would we start applying to jobs before making  
01:36 - sure that we have solid Technical and soft skills 
in reality the application process takes a long  
01:42 - time and you might be applying to many positions 
before even Landing in interview so the timeline  
01:48 - really looks like this where you are applying 
to jobs while studying for technical questions  
01:52 - and working on your soft skills now that you know 
what the five areas are let's dive a little deeper  
01:57 - into each area starting with resumé development 
now let's start with format and structure some  
02:02 - people do two column RS some people do a single 
column some people do multiple Pages whereas some  
02:06 - people condense everything into a single page 
and then don't even get started on colors and  
02:10 - fonts so what is best well first you have to 
understand that recruiters can get hundreds of  
02:15 - rumes so they actually use an automated resumé 
screening software to sift through and filter  
02:20 - out candidates to a more manageable number your 
first task is to make sure your resume is legible  
02:26 - to a computer if you use fancy formatting your 
application might not even make it through the  
02:31 - screening process regarding colors color theory 
states that certain colors convey different moods  
02:36 - for example red is often associated with being 
bold and yellow as seen as bright and happy  
02:40 - these are all things to consider and that's why 
structure and formatting is important next let's  
02:46 - talk about experience points development this is 
the work experience your personal projects the  
02:52 - meat of your resume obviously you want to have 
as much relevant experience as possible but if  
02:57 - this is your very first job then you should have 
relevant personal projects that you've worked on  
03:02 - furthermore you should write your points in 
this format as much as possible the what how  
03:08 - why an impact method here's an example developed 
a using to allow leading to now let's fill it in  
03:19 - developed a service using Python and AWS to allow 
for the automated syncing of production databases  
03:29 - leading to a less than 1% discrepancy in databases 
now you may not know the impact of your work all  
03:36 - the time but wherever you can use hard numbers 
and facts and stats that makes your experience  
03:42 - more impactful but you know I also have to caution 
against embellishing too much because you need to  
03:48 - be able to talk about each point in great detail 
during the interview so make sure what you're  
03:53 - writing is absolutely true and that you can back 
it up next let's talk about online presence at a  
03:59 - at a minimum you should have a LinkedIn and 
GitHub profile for your LinkedIn fill it out  
04:04 - as thoroughly as possible and get recommendations 
from co-workers and friends for GitHub you want to  
04:09 - put your personal projects on there but make sure 
the code is well documented and that the project  
04:13 - is organized otherwise this could backfire on you 
and as for personal websites with a r/ portfolio  
04:20 - this is a nice to have where you can show off 
your projects and resum but it's not absolutely  
04:25 - necessary if this is something you want to do 
think about using a website builder to quick  
04:29 - set one up such as Wix or you know all The Usual 
Suspects but there's one I discovered recently  
04:35 - which is pretty easy to set up a one pager it's 
called card.co and it's spelled oddly c a r r.co  
04:44 - okay now let's talk about applications aside from 
using the big job sites like indeed and monster  
04:49 - that might have many applicants going after the 
same job postings you can also apply directly  
04:55 - on a company's website and even better if there 
are particular companies you really want to work  
05:00 - for you can use a bunch of different techniques to 
find the email addresses of the head recruiter and  
05:05 - email them directly and there are techniques and 
strategies to this once you start getting replies  
05:11 - from recruiters you want to make sure that you're 
responding in a way that doesn't raise any red  
05:15 - flags so these are things like responding promptly 
using professional language not saying anything  
05:20 - weird and then also knowing when to follow up and 
what to say I think this is mostly common sense  
05:25 - but I've learned not to assume anything now this 
last area isn't something that I even realize that  
05:31 - you have to do but I guess you have to apply to 
so many different jobs these days just to land a  
05:36 - few interviews you need a way to track the status 
of each of your applications because you're going  
05:41 - to be sending off many you need to see which ones 
need following up on which ones are dead ends and  
05:46 - so on tracking also gives you confidence because 
you'll begin to see patterns in numbers like on  
05:52 - average you get one interview seven rejections and 
22 no answers for every 30 applications you send  
06:00 - now I'm just making those numbers up but once 
you see it that way then it takes the emotion  
06:04 - out of it and you know it's just a numbers game 
you know it's just a matter of time if you keep  
06:10 - at it all right let's move on to technical skills 
now there are iOS specific skills that you need  
06:16 - to know these were covered in previous steps 
in the video series but there are also more  
06:21 - General computer science software engineering 
type of skills you need such as algorithms and  
06:26 - data structures these concepts are essential to 
software development and there are websites you  
06:31 - can use to study this stuff just search for 
algorithms and data structures on Google and  
06:36 - YouTube there are tons of videos covering these 
the interviewer may also ask you some technical  
06:41 - trivia these are General Knowledge Questions such 
as what's the difference between a git Fetch and  
06:47 - a git pull now luckily again there are websites 
with lists of these types of questions that you  
06:52 - can study and then lastly this is the most scary 
part the live coding SL problemsolving part for  
06:59 - this the interviewer wants to see you code 
or Reason out the solution to a problem again  
07:05 - there's a pool of common problems and solutions 
that you can study and practice on websites such  
07:10 - as lead code and hacker rank now the last part 
soft skills this is so important because if you  
07:16 - are not good at this part you might not even get 
through the first phase of the interview let's  
07:21 - start with project background and explanation this 
is very important because it usually happens even  
07:26 - before the technical interview the interviewer May 
pick apart your resume asking specific questions  
07:32 - about your work experience and if you can't answer 
confidently and in detail it might raise some red  
07:38 - flags as to whether or not it you actually did 
those things what is a lie what is truth if you  
07:45 - give the interviewer any doubt you're out the 
door so know your resume points inside and out  
07:51 - Next Behavioral questions these are lists of 
common Behavior questions that you can study  
07:56 - from websites these are things that look at how 
you would act in various difficult scenarios it  
08:01 - also gives the interviewer a sense of whether 
or not you'll fit into their team culture and  
08:06 - then there's General communication this part talks 
about how to conduct yourself during an interview  
08:11 - because communication isn't just verbal there's 
a huge non-verbal component such as how you look  
08:16 - how you smell how you carry yourself how you 
greet someone how you respond under stress and  
08:21 - things like that so if this stuff doesn't come 
natural to you definitely look it up study it  
08:27 - practice it now I'm sorry that I was only able 
to briefly touch on each area but in reality  
08:32 - Ali and I are still working on it our goal is to 
produce a handson practical program that people  
08:37 - can follow to find a job in the industry and 
this job ready program is going to be part of  
08:42 - our CWC Plus Membership all right thank you 
for watching I'll see you in the next video
