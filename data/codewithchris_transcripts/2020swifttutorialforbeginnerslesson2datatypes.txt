00:00 - hello and welcome back to my Swift
00:01 - tutorial for beginners this is lesson 2
00:03 - if you missed less than one then I
00:05 - highly recommend that you start there
00:07 - first now back in lesson 1 you learned
00:09 - all about variables and constants and
00:11 - how they're used to keep track of the
00:12 - data in your app now the data in your
00:15 - app can be as simple as text or numbers
00:17 - but it can also be complex such as photo
00:20 - data or maybe employee records in a
00:22 - company database in Swift there are
00:25 - different data types to categorize these
00:27 - different kinds of data and that is
00:29 - today's topic so let's dive in so I
00:37 - thought a brand new playground here and
00:38 - I want to show you something that I did
00:41 - a little preview for you in the last
00:42 - lesson so here we have a variable called
00:44 - STR and we've assigned a piece of string
00:49 - data or text data into that variable and
00:52 - I showed you last time that you're not
00:55 - able to do something like this when you
00:58 - reassign data to a variable you can't
01:01 - change the data type
01:02 - now data types were something that we
01:04 - glossed over in the previous lesson but
01:06 - that's what we're going to talk about
01:08 - here today so in Swift there are
01:10 - different types of data so far you've
01:12 - been introduced to strings which is
01:14 - essentially just text data and I know
01:17 - that's a little bit of a weird name for
01:19 - text data but you can think of it as a
01:21 - string of characters at least that's how
01:24 - I thought of it when I first started and
01:25 - then it is for integers these represent
01:29 - whole numbers positive and negative and
01:31 - then you have your decimal numbers and
01:33 - you actually have two data types to
01:35 - represent your decimal numbers where you
01:37 - have a float and you have double the
01:38 - only difference is that double is more
01:40 - precise so we can actually store a
01:42 - longer decimal numbers and then lastly
01:45 - for this slide at least we have boolean
01:47 - or just bool and this represents true or
01:50 - false data it's perfect for data where
01:53 - there is only one of two options so
01:55 - those aren't the only data types in
01:56 - Swift however they're probably the most
01:59 - common that you'll work with for a while
02:01 - and also when you get a little more
02:03 - advanced you're going to be able to
02:05 - create your own data types that are more
02:07 - complex than the ones that I just showed
02:09 - you just as a quick example you might
02:11 - create a data type
02:12 - called person which includes a lot of
02:14 - information like your age your hair
02:16 - color your eye color your ethnicity your
02:19 - likes and dislikes and all that sort of
02:21 - stuff that's a lot of data but it's all
02:23 - related to one type which is a person so
02:26 - a quick example quick preview but for
02:28 - now let's just focus on these common
02:30 - simple data types now what I want to do
02:32 - is I want to focus on the practical side
02:34 - of data types so I'm going to show you
02:37 - in terms of declaring variables and
02:39 - constants how you would specify the data
02:42 - type for your variable or constant so in
02:45 - the last lesson you learned that in
02:46 - order to declare a variable you would
02:48 - use the VAR keyword followed by the
02:51 - variable name and for constants you
02:53 - would just use the let keyword and then
02:55 - you would use the assignment operator in
02:57 - other words the equal sign to assign
03:00 - some sort of data into that variable or
03:02 - constant well one thing that I did leave
03:05 - out was an optional part of this
03:07 - variable or constant declaration and
03:10 - that is that after your variable or
03:12 - constant name you can put : followed by
03:15 - the data type that you expect this
03:18 - variable or constant to keep track of so
03:20 - in this example we are assigning some
03:23 - string data to our variable if I were to
03:26 - explicitly declare that my variable can
03:30 - only hold string data I will put colon
03:33 - followed by string which is the data
03:35 - type name so now let's take a look at
03:37 - our playground again Y up here in this
03:40 - variable declaration was there no
03:42 - datatype specified
03:44 - well that's because you don't really
03:46 - have to do it if you don't specify the
03:49 - datatype what's going to happen is it's
03:52 - going to take on the datatype of the
03:54 - first piece of data that you assigned to
03:56 - it so if my first piece of data was
03:59 - actually an integer like 100 then my
04:03 - variable STR would now be an integer
04:07 - datatype variable so now you can see
04:09 - that this line actually doesn't produce
04:11 - an error because I can reassign data to
04:15 - my variable as long as it's the same
04:18 - data type that it took on in the first
04:21 - place now just a quick note why is it
04:23 - that if this variable isn't
04:27 - type of variable why is it that I can't
04:30 - assign a piece of string to it what's
04:32 - happening under the hood well the thing
04:34 - is different types of data are stored
04:36 - differently in memory and so when you
04:39 - declare a variable STR and you say that
04:42 - it should store integers well to put it
04:44 - in simple terms it's just going to be
04:46 - set up to store integers if you were to
04:48 - say that that variable would store
04:50 - string data it's going to be set up a
04:52 - different way now there is a data type
04:54 - which gives you more flexibility in
04:56 - terms of storing different kinds of data
04:58 - but that's a topic for another day and
05:01 - the second thing is that it actually
05:02 - helps you as a coder because imagine if
05:05 - your variable can store any kind of data
05:08 - you don't know what to expect but the
05:12 - fact that you know this variable STR can
05:15 - only store numerical data or integers to
05:17 - be specific that sets your own
05:19 - expectation as a coder sometimes having
05:22 - too much freedom is not a good thing
05:24 - because that offers more opportunities
05:26 - for errors and when we're programming
05:29 - and when we're coding the greatest enemy
05:31 - is actually us making mistakes either in
05:34 - our logic or in the way that we've coded
05:37 - something so that's a little bit about
05:38 - why there are data types now let's do
05:41 - some quick examples of some of the data
05:43 - types that we've talked about so we've
05:45 - got STR here so let's leave this as a
05:47 - string alright and let's do let's do
05:52 - another one called a I know I'm not
05:54 - following my same rules about having
05:56 - descriptive variables but you know what
06:00 - we could do that let's call an integer
06:05 - do 100 do a float and this could be like
06:13 - a 0.1 or two if you double you know I'm
06:23 - not and you could do a bar rule this is
06:28 - the datatype for that and then this can
06:31 - be true or false and like I mentioned
06:33 - before you don't have to explicitly
06:34 - specify the data types like this it's
06:39 - going to take on the
06:40 - type of the first piece of data that you
06:42 - assigned to it now this part is a little
06:45 - tricky because float and double both
06:47 - represent decimal numbers it's just that
06:50 - double is more precise so if you remove
06:54 - that data type or what kind of data type
06:56 - is float and double or sorry these two
07:00 - variables what are they well it turns
07:02 - out that double is the default decimal
07:05 - datatype for swift so this one would
07:09 - actually be a double data type that's
07:12 - what the system is going to treat that
07:14 - as and then boolean is just boolean if
07:18 - we remove that it's going to see true
07:19 - and it's going to make this variable a
07:22 - boolean type okay so before moving on to
07:25 - the next lesson let's do a quick recap
07:27 - in this lesson you learned about the
07:29 - most common data types that you'll be
07:31 - working with you also learn that you can
07:33 - explicitly specify the data type when
07:35 - you declare your variable or constant
07:37 - and if you don't do that the variable or
07:40 - constant is going to take on the
07:41 - datatype of the first piece of data that
07:43 - you assign to it and then the last
07:45 - lesson I did forget to mention that I
07:47 - have a swift cheat sheet available for
07:48 - you to download and reference so you can
07:51 - have quick access in case you forget the
07:53 - syntax or maybe data types or anything
07:55 - else and it's very handy to keep besides
07:58 - you as your learning Swift great
07:59 - progress so far let's keep moving I'll
08:01 - see you in lesson 3 just click the
