00:04 - hello and welcome to lesson 13. now in this lesson 
it's going to be more of a hands-on and practical  
00:10 - challenge i want you to try to build this app 
on your own now you have all the skills you  
00:16 - need based on lessons 1 to 12 and this exercise is 
going to be a great way to reinforce what you've  
00:24 - learned and also to identify any gaps in your 
knowledge at this point so that we can go and  
00:30 - review it and also go and figure out what it is 
that you need to get up to speed before continuing  
00:36 - okay so let me just walk through this app you've 
got a title you've got number of credits you've  
00:41 - got some images and when you hit this button it 
merely randomizes the images if they don't match  
00:48 - then you're going to lose credits but however if 
you get three matching ones which i can't seem to  
00:54 - do right now oh there we go then you would gain 
credits so this is very much like the war card  
01:00 - game except that now there are three things that 
you randomize instead of two and the image assets  
01:05 - are in the description in a link so you can 
make sure you grab those uh then you'll have  
01:11 - everything you need whether you think this is 
too easy or if it's too hard either way i highly  
01:16 - recommend that you try it because it's really 
the best way to learn even if you get stuck  
01:22 - when you look at the solution and you figure out 
how to overcome that obstacle that you're stuck  
01:27 - on it's going to be extra meaningful and it's 
going to really help commit it to memory and this  
01:33 - belief about hands-on learning is due to my own 
failure in the beginning when i tried to learn ios  
01:40 - so uh this is not just you know something i read 
or something i heard this is from my own personal  
01:45 - experience that it's there's nothing else that can 
replace it's the best way to learn so long story  
01:51 - short give this challenge a try we have a great 
forum that if you are viewing this on youtube or  
02:00 - on our website feel free to post in the 
app development section for hints or  
02:05 - you know if you want just a little guidance on 
the right direction so that you can complete it  
02:10 - post here if you are in cwc plus and you are 
you have access to the course students area  
02:18 - then post in the swift ui section in there and 
we'll support you there as well so that being said  
02:25 - good luck with the challenge and 
i'll see you in the next lesson
