00:01 - hello welcome to learn Swift for
00:04 - beginners lesson 9 in this video you're
00:06 - going to be introduced to classes which
00:08 - is an absolutely critical part of the
00:11 - Swift programming language if you're
00:12 - going to be using it to build apps I'll
00:15 - tell you all about it let's get started
00:17 - [Music]
00:20 - so I'm going to start off with a
00:23 - hypothetical example so let's say you
00:25 - have something like a blog post which
00:27 - you would like to represent we might
00:30 - have something like a variable here for
00:33 - blog title alright blog title can be
00:36 - hello playground I don't know what kind
00:38 - of article that would be but we would
00:41 - have another variable for the blog body
00:44 - and this is the you know text of the
00:47 - article or the blog post and then we
00:49 - might have something like blog author
00:53 - which in this case let's just put my
00:56 - name here so you can see here this is
00:59 - the data for one blog post now let's say
01:03 - I had two blog posts what what would I
01:05 - do in this case I might have another set
01:09 - of variables down here and of course I
01:11 - can't have the same variable names so
01:13 - let's just append two to these these
01:19 - variable names and let's say this is I
01:23 - don't know this article is good by
01:26 - playground okay now this is what I have
01:30 - for two blog articles now what if I had
01:33 - ten what if I had a hundred how many
01:35 - variables would I have then it it'd be a
01:38 - ton right it would be a mess there needs
01:41 - to be a better way to represent a blog
01:43 - post to kind of group these variables
01:45 - together and there is in fact that's
01:48 - what the class is you know how you
01:51 - learned about the different data types
01:52 - back in lesson two you learned about the
01:56 - string data type you learned about the
01:58 - int data type float double boolean all
02:01 - of those are data types to represent
02:03 - different types of data right well with
02:06 - classes you can define your own custom
02:08 - data type so what we're going to do here
02:11 - is we're going to create our
02:13 - custom data type called blog post for
02:17 - example you can do that with classes
02:20 - let's take a look at the syntax for
02:23 - declaring a new class so first of all
02:26 - you have the class keyword next you have
02:30 - the name of the class and this is going
02:33 - to be the name of your datatype then you
02:36 - follow by two curly brackets and inside
02:40 - those two curly brackets is your cost
02:42 - definition let's take a look at this
02:46 - back in our playground so for example up
02:52 - here let's create and define our class
02:55 - so first I would use the cross keyword
02:58 - and then I would create a name of the
03:02 - datatype or the name of the class in
03:04 - this case let's put blog post and notice
03:08 - that this time I'm starting off with a
03:11 - capital letter in fact all of the data
03:14 - types in Swift start off with a capital
03:16 - letter so we should follow the same
03:18 - convention always start off your class
03:20 - names with the capital letter and that's
03:23 - different from what we've been doing
03:24 - with variables and constants and
03:26 - functions okay then I have these two
03:30 - curly brackets like that what do I put
03:33 - inside of my blog post class well why
03:38 - don't we put this stuff right here I'm
03:43 - just going to cut it and I'm going to
03:46 - paste it inside here and then I'm going
03:49 - to delete this right here and I am going
03:53 - to delete this text inside these
03:59 - variables inside my class and leave them
04:04 - empty and I'm going to explain why in a
04:06 - second okay so just like that we've
04:08 - defined a class called blog post and
04:11 - this class has three properties now a
04:14 - property is just a variable declaration
04:17 - like this but inside a class it's called
04:20 - a property you're going to see why in a
04:22 - second why makes more sense and because
04:26 - this blog title blog body blog author is
04:30 - inside of blog post it's kind of
04:34 - redundant to name them like this
04:35 - so I'm just going to name them title
04:38 - body and author like that okay so this
04:43 - this represents our blog post right here
04:46 - now that used to find what a blog post
04:48 - is let's create an actual blog post
04:51 - because remember this class definition
04:54 - right here this is just a definition of
04:57 - a data type you're defining what a blog
04:59 - post data type is right so that's not an
05:03 - actual blog post just like how this is a
05:07 - string that's not the definition of a
05:11 - string that's an actual string so in
05:13 - order to create an actual blog post
05:16 - we're going to type in the class name
05:19 - followed by two rounded brackets like
05:21 - that and just like that this is a new
05:24 - instance of the blog post type and it's
05:29 - called an object or blog post object so
05:33 - when you define a new class using the
05:35 - class keyword that's what's known as a
05:37 - class definition or just class but when
05:41 - you create actual instances of that
05:44 - class those are called objects you can
05:48 - think of your class definition as a
05:50 - template or a blueprint and you use that
05:53 - template to create actual tangible blog
05:57 - post objects so let's jump back to the
06:01 - playground here this is a very important
06:03 - concept to understand we've defined a
06:06 - class called blog post here it's got
06:08 - these three properties or you can think
06:10 - of them as attributes of a blog post and
06:12 - then down here like this we've created a
06:15 - new blog post object now this blog post
06:18 - object has a title it has a body and has
06:22 - an author but all of it all of them are
06:25 - empty right now
06:26 - so what we're going to do is we're going
06:27 - to assign this blog post object into a
06:30 - constant let's call it my post like that
06:33 - so what we've done here is we've created
06:36 - a new blog post object we've assigned it
06:38 - to my post
06:40 - and now why don't we try setting the
06:42 - title of this blog post and the body and
06:45 - the author what we would do is say my
06:47 - post right that's referring to this new
06:50 - object and then we press dot and that
06:53 - lets us access those properties which
06:56 - we've defined in the class definition
06:58 - set the title to I don't know hello
07:04 - playground I think that's what we had
07:05 - before let's set the author of this one
07:09 - and let's set the body to hello okay
07:18 - just hello now if I print my post dot
07:24 - author I would get my name now let me
07:30 - show you something else we can create a
07:33 - second instance of blog post or a second
07:38 - blog post object and let's call this my
07:41 - second post and we're going to set this
07:45 - to a new blog post object like that and
07:48 - we're going to say my second post title
07:51 - equals goodbye playground and can set
08:00 - the author to someone else let's say
08:04 - John Travolta I don't know why that
08:07 - suddenly popped into my head and let's
08:12 - just do hello again now this is a second
08:16 - my post object this is different from my
08:21 - post these are completely two different
08:23 - blog post objects both of them contain
08:29 - these three properties which we consent
08:31 - because that's what we've defined here
08:33 - in this class now another very cool
08:36 - thing about classes is that you can put
08:40 - functions in them and you can see how
08:42 - all of the lessons so far are coming
08:44 - together let's create a new property for
08:46 - this first let's say a number of
08:50 - comments equals zero this is the number
08:53 - of comments in the blog post and we're
08:55 - going to define a new function in this
08:57 - blog post class we're going to say add
09:00 - comment okay and we're not going to
09:03 - worry about the comment text just yet
09:06 - let's just define this so notice that in
09:10 - my function definition I have these two
09:13 - curly brackets again inside here this is
09:16 - going to be my function code so inside
09:18 - this function I am just going to
09:20 - increase the number of comments by one
09:23 - this is all stuff that you should have
09:25 - learned already in the previous lessons
09:27 - now okay so now every single blog post
09:31 - object is going to have this function
09:33 - now how do we access it we simply go my
09:39 - post dot you can see now in the
09:43 - autocomplete that there is this function
09:46 - called
09:46 - add comment and it doesn't have any
09:49 - return value it doesn't return anything
09:51 - so the return type is void right there
09:53 - let's call this function okay see what
09:57 - happens so add comment you can't visibly
10:00 - see what happens but let's print my post
10:03 - dot number of comments you can see that
10:07 - it's one okay now let's print my second
10:14 - post dot number of comments what would
10:17 - you expect just to print out it prints
10:25 - out zero why because we haven't called
10:28 - the add comment function on my second
10:31 - post we just did that with the first
10:33 - post each of these blog post objects
10:37 - maintains its own properties changing
10:40 - the properties of one object does not
10:42 - affect the other even though they're cut
10:44 - from the same cloth right there both
10:47 - types of blog post there are two
10:50 - independent entities and they maintain
10:52 - their properties separately now there's
10:55 - a lot more to classes but fundamentally
10:58 - I want you to understand what they are
11:00 - so I'm not going to make this video any
11:03 - longer than it needs to be I just
11:05 - to introduce classes to you I hope you
11:08 - can see why classes are a fundamental
11:10 - building block to organize your
11:12 - information in the next video we're
11:15 - going to explore classes further so
11:17 - thanks for watching please give this
11:19 - video a thumbs up if it helped you and
11:21 - please subscribe for more thanks for
11:23 - watching I'll see you in the next lesson
11:24 - bye for now
