00:01 - so when I finally got it all finished
00:04 - and already I wanted to put it on github
00:07 - so that other people could also like use
00:09 - it and learn from it a few a few weeks
00:11 - later I found that all of a sudden my my
00:15 - doubt my muse were going up to a hundred
00:18 - thousand and I'm like where are all
00:20 - these beans coming from right and
00:21 - they're coming from this random app so I
00:23 - go into the app and it's my app and it
00:26 - and then I I tracked it a little bit
00:27 - more and I found out it was actually
00:29 - number 16 in the entertainment category
00:31 - in China I found it on the App Store and
00:34 - all over the place on these random
00:36 - websites without any credit for me I'm
00:42 - Christian and in today's episode how a
00:44 - three-time dub dub DC scholar winner
00:47 - went from playing minecraft to teaching
00:49 - himself how to code and then building a
00:51 - top charting app on his first try the
00:54 - only problem he didn't get any of the
00:56 - credit because someone had stolen his
00:58 - source code and submitted the app as
00:59 - their own
01:05 - [Music]
01:07 - hey everyone it's Chris here and today I
01:10 - have the pleasure of speaking with Nik
01:12 - Khurana and when I first met Nick I was
01:15 - super impressed with him because not
01:17 - only is he a three-time WWDC scholarship
01:21 - winner he's also published apps into the
01:24 - App Store 3 to be exact and he's also
01:27 - gotten interviewed by Apple and so when
01:29 - I learned about all of his
01:31 - accomplishment I just had to speak with
01:34 - him and did I mention that he's only in
01:36 - first year University I'm super
01:40 - impressed Nick thank you so much for
01:41 - coming on this chat thank you yeah
01:44 - definitely I spent a lot of time like
01:46 - making all these apps and it's cool to
01:48 - like share all my experiences with them
01:50 - yeah yeah I can really I can really see
01:53 - that because you put everything up on
01:54 - github and you know I think it's it's so
01:59 - awesome that you share your knowledge
02:00 - and share your code like that but
02:02 - sometimes it can also be kind of bad
02:05 - yeah yeah are we gonna talk about this a
02:09 - little later on about something that
02:11 - happened but first I want to ask you
02:14 - about dub dub DC because you just came
02:17 - back from it and you know I hear you
02:19 - were stranded at the airport yes so what
02:24 - happened was we were I went from San
02:26 - Jose to Atlanta we were here at Atlanta
02:30 - Airport and it was very foggy and we
02:34 - were just looping the the clock on the
02:36 - on the airplane was like five minutes
02:38 - left and then they just decided to take
02:41 - us to Memphis which is like an hour away
02:43 - Wow
02:44 - yes so what happened was the GPS
02:46 - tracking apparently was disabled on many
02:49 - airplanes um so they had they couldn't
02:52 - do a visual landing because of the rain
02:55 - here so they had a ticket to another
02:56 - Airport and then they were trying to get
02:58 - the plane fixed and they didn't give us
03:00 - a hotel or anything or food and I was
03:03 - there for 22 hours waiting for a new
03:06 - plane to arrive with that actually
03:08 - worked and had GPS so that they could
03:10 - land it these things you can't predict
03:12 - it from happening but oh yeah this was
03:14 - after a whole week of events right ahead
03:16 - dubbed of DC yep
03:18 - and between the timezone difference and
03:20 - everything yeah it's not really but I
03:24 - hope you had a great week right oh yeah
03:27 - definitely
03:27 - yes so yeah I've always had this
03:30 - question because I can imagine the
03:33 - experience and now I've never been to
03:34 - doubled up do you see myself but I can
03:36 - imagine if I went you know I would there
03:38 - would be obviously the keynote and there
03:40 - would be sessions and it would be like
03:41 - mingling and then the parties and stuff
03:43 - like that but how does that differ being
03:46 - a double DC scholar do they have do they
03:51 - treat you any differently are there
03:52 - things that are only for the scholars
03:54 - yes definitely and that's like a really
03:57 - big part of it they they give us like so
03:59 - much stuff extra because they want us to
04:02 - have a really good experience so for
04:04 - example the keynote on Monday and on
04:07 - Sunday they have what's called the
04:09 - scholarship kickoff where they have a
04:11 - special event just for scholarship
04:12 - winners so they do they will present for
04:16 - us they'll let us talk directly with
04:18 - engineers and with recruiters and they
04:20 - get a special food so for example last
04:22 - year they took us of the Steve Jobs
04:24 - theatre and they did a presentation Tim
04:26 - Cook came out they presented about like
04:28 - the Apple pencil Apple watch there their
04:31 - plan for renewable and recyclable energy
04:33 - and then after that finished they let us
04:36 - go and tied the Steve Jobs theater like
04:38 - the lobby and the engineers were out we
04:41 - took a group picture with Tim Cook we
04:43 - got to speak with all the engineers and
04:44 - then we were able to go the next day to
04:47 - the keynote and this year they took us
04:49 - to Discovery meadow which is like a
04:51 - little bit of a walk from the Convention
04:53 - Center and they gave us like food trucks
04:55 - they had all of like tons of Engineers
04:58 - like Siri shortcuts er kid recruiters I
05:01 - actually met both my recruiters who
05:02 - interviewed me who set up the interviews
05:04 - for me a few months ago for my two
05:06 - interviews so that was really cool and
05:08 - they remembered me and everything which
05:09 - is really nice that sounds amazing
05:10 - that's absolutely amazing what a great
05:14 - program and you've been you've been
05:16 - three years in a row do you see the same
05:18 - faces every year or are they new
05:20 - definitely sometimes I see people who I
05:23 - saw last year our interns this year and
05:25 - they're answering our questions at and
05:29 - so it's yeah it's really interesting to
05:32 - see
05:32 - yeah some people I see every year or
05:36 - maybe every other year yeah that's great
05:40 - what a great place to meet people right
05:43 - oh yeah definitely every every team is
05:46 - every Apple team is there people who you
05:49 - see on Twitter like posting cool
05:50 - projects there they're there and you
05:52 - could just go up to them and be like hey
05:54 - I saw your cool demo how did you do it
05:56 - and then they'll just do it and then you
05:58 - could take a picture with them I just
06:01 - seen was there who was a famous youtuber
06:03 - and KB HD and I could just go up to them
06:06 - and take a picture with them like I did
06:07 - last week awesome and this is only for
06:10 - the scholars at this point for at the
06:13 - kickoff yeah I just seen was there MTV
06:16 - she was at the keynote but a lot of
06:19 - people come to the kickoff that's
06:22 - awesome and then from that point on are
06:24 - the scholars just treated the same way
06:25 - or are there more activities for only
06:27 - the scholars throughout the week so
06:29 - throughout the week we have a special
06:30 - area just for us called the scholarship
06:32 - lounge and that's where all the scholars
06:34 - are we have a table with ethernet cables
06:38 - wearing couches we're able to talk to
06:40 - each other we get a special badge that's
06:42 - look at different color than everyone
06:43 - else so you're just walking and people
06:45 - are just like congratulations or they'll
06:47 - come up to you and ask you what you made
06:48 - and then you can explain it to them oh
06:50 - that's so cool what a great program
06:53 - because they pay for your ticket they
06:54 - pay for your lodging and I think the
06:56 - lodging is the most expensive right
06:58 - because yeah yeah and the lodging is
07:01 - very nice
07:01 - like the dorms where they take us to San
07:05 - Jose University dorms and I think
07:07 - they're ranked really really well for
07:09 - dorms in the country really nice dorms
07:12 - that's so cool so at the keynote you
07:17 - know out of all the things that they
07:18 - announced well what were you most
07:20 - excited about I think I I think I have a
07:22 - guess but I want you to let me know for
07:26 - me I think Swift UI is like amazing it's
07:29 - it's like a totally new area and a way
07:32 - to do things also specifically I've done
07:35 - a lot of a arkad stuff so the people of
07:37 - kujan is really interesting and all the
07:39 - new technologies they came out around
07:41 - there because like I don't think any
07:44 - other company has
07:46 - is like that technology with people
07:48 - occlusion where I can just detect where
07:50 - you are and the depth and then render it
07:54 - based on that
07:55 - yeah so I saw that and I myself have
07:57 - never really played with a arkad so I
08:00 - can get idea like that seems really hard
08:03 - to do but I mean you you've worked with
08:06 - a arkad a lot so you know like how
08:09 - difficult is it to do that sort of stuff
08:12 - to people occlusion and the motion
08:13 - capture is it like it's really amazing
08:15 - that they managed to do that yeah yeah I
08:17 - really think so because there's just so
08:19 - much hardware and software talking
08:21 - directly together
08:22 - I remember in 2017 when they first
08:24 - announced the arc if I went up to an
08:26 - American engineer and he helped me
08:27 - convert my playground from 3d into a R
08:30 - and I asked him how long have you guys
08:32 - been working on this project and he's
08:34 - like since I've been working here we've
08:35 - been working on this project he said
08:37 - he's been working there where I think he
08:39 - said like three years or four years so
08:42 - like that was just when it was just
08:44 - announced and they're working on all
08:46 - that other stuff behind the scenes that
08:47 - we don't even know about but yeah I
08:49 - think the really cool thing about a arc
08:51 - it is like if eventually we have AR
08:54 - glasses then you could like you don't
08:58 - need like physical objects like a few
09:00 - weeks ago I made a demo where you could
09:02 - just like put a Mac on the table and if
09:04 - you had like glasses on you would be
09:06 - able to use it as if it was actually
09:07 - there and that's like super cool Yeah
09:10 - Yeah what about reality because Oh
09:14 - reality kit I went to they demoed it to
09:17 - me there it makes it so easy to deal
09:20 - with like dealing with physics
09:23 - like for example in 2018 I made Jenga in
09:26 - augmented reality and when he was
09:28 - demoing it to me he literally just put a
09:31 - whole bunch of blocks on the screen and
09:33 - like remade my whole playground within
09:35 - like 30 minutes but physics and
09:37 - everything and you're able to just put
09:39 - on the table that's crazy yeah and I
09:41 - love that demo by the way your demo
09:44 - specifically for your 2018 submission
09:46 - yeah thank you
09:48 - it's got a lot of time on those yeah so
09:50 - for maybe for some of the listeners who
09:53 - don't know what reality kit is can you
09:55 - kind of explain it in a nutshell yeah so
09:58 - reality can't
10:00 - is basically like if you ever use c-kit
10:02 - you would have a seed file and you're
10:04 - able to like drag-and-drop 3d objects
10:06 - and then you could render the scene
10:08 - reality reality kid is they use like
10:10 - reality Composer
10:12 - so that you could just drag like a like
10:15 - similar in a secret you could just drag
10:16 - the file in and it would handle all the
10:19 - physics for you and talking through
10:21 - other devices for physics which is super
10:23 - hard to do because you have to sync all
10:26 - the physics together adding animations
10:28 - is difficult and it'll handle all that
10:29 - for you yeah that's like when I saw them
10:32 - announced that I I thought oh it's
10:35 - finally possible for me to dive into
10:37 - this stuff because I always thought like
10:38 - you know I I have no 3d programming I'm
10:42 - not like super good at math and I always
10:45 - thought it was kind of beyond my reach
10:46 - and so I never really took a dive it
10:48 - into looking at it but with reality
10:51 - Composer it almost makes me feel like oh
10:53 - I can just you know drag and drop these
10:55 - yeah and 3d models in there and then I
10:58 - don't have to worry about at least not
10:59 - part of it
11:00 - yeah and it's extremely smooth to like
11:02 - when I was using it like I've used
11:05 - blender before and it's so simpler you
11:07 - you really don't need any experience
11:09 - it's the icons everything is just so
11:12 - simple there's not too many options but
11:13 - like it's extremely configurable and you
11:17 - can do so much with it they've been
11:18 - spending so much time on it and it came
11:21 - out like really good like the UI I was
11:23 - looking at it when he was demoing it to
11:24 - me and when I was using it and it's just
11:26 - so easy to use but you didn't have any
11:28 - of those tools for your your scholarship
11:31 - submissions because you've worked with
11:32 - Eric it for all three of your
11:34 - submissions and maybe you can tell us a
11:36 - little bit about what you submitted for
11:39 - the the last three years yeah so for the
11:41 - for the first year I used scene kit it's
11:43 - only seen kit and it was just it was a
11:45 - Rubik's Cube in space so that was all
11:48 - done in synced and I had these cool
11:50 - animations where it would it would first
11:52 - show up scrambled and then it would have
11:54 - this like explosion animation and they
11:56 - would go into space kind of like a
11:58 - planet breaking up and then they would
11:59 - come back scrambled and then you would
12:01 - have to unsalted and all those
12:03 - animations and everything we're done in
12:04 - see you kid and you could see it on
12:06 - github to the next year I turned it into
12:10 - a AR kit and 3d so
12:13 - in the backend structure is all team kit
12:16 - really they are cute is basically seeing
12:18 - it just instead of using a virtual
12:22 - camera and a virtual coordinate system
12:24 - you will scan the table they'll create a
12:27 - coordinate system for you and then I'll
12:29 - use your phone's actual camera as the
12:32 - camera and then it will place your scene
12:35 - on the table as if it's a scene cat
12:37 - scene so it's essentially the same thing
12:39 - except it's it's using your real camera
12:42 - and a real coordinate system instead of
12:44 - a virtual one so right yeah so I made um
12:48 - some cool physics animations with
12:50 - particle systems that's like an
12:52 - introduction in introduction scene and
12:54 - then you can place your agenda on the
12:57 - table you could switch between 3d and AR
12:59 - and then you could play Jenga and then
13:02 - the next year this year I'd made in a
13:06 - our source it's been builder so you
13:08 - could place a son on a table or on the
13:11 - floor or something and then you could
13:13 - walk around and where you're standing
13:15 - good planets and they were rolling
13:17 - around the Sun you could change the mass
13:19 - the distance and the radius and see how
13:21 - the planet will like speed up and slow
13:22 - down or how it'll get bigger or slower
13:25 - kind of like teaching you physics and
13:27 - how the planets gonna interact and you
13:30 - can even add moons and as many planets
13:32 - as you want yeah I think that would be a
13:34 - great tool for education for sure
13:36 - oh yeah does that the main reason why I
13:38 - made it was because in AP Physics is
13:41 - hard to like you get questions like if
13:43 - Planet X distance from the Sun increased
13:46 - by 2 what would happen to its velocity
13:49 - and you could see exactly how it could
13:51 - speed up or slow down depending on the
13:53 - changes that's so cool so you took all
13:56 - those equations from what you were
13:57 - learning in school you just built was it
14:04 - challenging for you to build those like
14:06 - reach a lunging yourself yeah definitely
14:08 - because I've never made like a source
14:11 - and cuz like that would actually be to
14:13 - scale like that and I never dealt with
14:16 - like converting an educational thing
14:19 - into like an actual AR scene that was
14:22 - accurate to cuz you want to make sure
14:24 - it's accurate so that and visual so you
14:26 - could see everything
14:27 - yeah like how cool would it be if in
14:30 - classrooms in the future right you just
14:32 - have that thing on your desk and you can
14:34 - just interact with it instead of just
14:36 - seeing a diagram in a book yeah exactly
14:38 - it's so much more it's a it's much a
14:40 - better learning experience yeah now
14:44 - since you've won like three you've been
14:46 - chosen three times in a row like and
14:48 - then this question is for the the vici
14:51 - 2020 Scholars but what's your thought
14:53 - process when you think about building
14:56 - your submission um well I always try to
14:59 - do better than the previous year because
15:01 - I know every year more people apply so
15:04 - the main thing I'd try to do is I use
15:06 - the latest new technologies so AR kid
15:09 - for example when it came out went right
15:11 - to AR kit something was like core mal
15:14 - and create a mouth because you're using
15:16 - new technologies by Apple so it's like
15:18 - really relevant they like when you use
15:21 - new technologies and take advantage of
15:22 - it so that's like the main thing it's
15:24 - used in technologies do something like
15:26 - creative eat like for example like a
15:29 - Rubik's Cube isn't creative right you've
15:31 - seen so many Rubik's cubes but like I
15:33 - added all these animations to it and
15:34 - like all these background effects and
15:36 - then it became creative because it's not
15:39 - just a rubik's cube there's like a story
15:41 - behind it about how like it's it's
15:43 - unscrambled and then it explodes and
15:45 - then it becomes scrambled and you have
15:47 - to solve it and similar with my Jenga
15:49 - just putting Jenga on the table I did
15:51 - that in like a day but then I added
15:53 - realistic textures like the reflections
15:57 - on the wood and they kind of looked
15:59 - really realistic and just like making
16:02 - Jenga but making it detailed adding like
16:05 - a twist to it that makes it like
16:06 - creative so that it has like a better
16:11 - effect on them because they see so many
16:13 - submissions they want something that's
16:16 - that's that's sure like a little bit of
16:18 - your creativity and also technical
16:21 - aspects with like new technologies yeah
16:24 - it looked really good and guys I'll
16:25 - include the links in the the notes so
16:28 - you guys can go check it out as well and
16:30 - how about for your latest one how did
16:32 - you come with that idea oh wait you told
16:34 - us yeah yeah it was it was through
16:37 - sample but when you when you set out to
16:40 - do it did you have a nine
16:41 - of how you'd accomplish it at all I I
16:44 - knew I had some knowledge of my previous
16:47 - submissions but something I had no clue
16:50 - about like for so for the actual planets
16:54 - right I've never made planets before
16:56 - right I didn't want to just download
16:58 - some planet from the internet so this is
17:00 - where also your creativity could show
17:02 - where you have this problem you don't
17:03 - know how to solve it so for me instead
17:05 - of just downloading it from the internet
17:07 - and making like a salt like a actual
17:09 - solar system what I did was I found
17:11 - textures in my house like for example
17:14 - the first planet new place is actually
17:16 - my shirt a tie-dye shirt that I had so
17:19 - what I did was that I scanned in a shirt
17:22 - on my printer and I used that as the
17:25 - texture so every single planet you see
17:27 - is a physical object scanned in by the
17:30 - printer so there's a aluminum foil is
17:32 - one of them
17:33 - the Sun is actually a pillow in my room
17:35 - it's a blue pillow and what I did was I
17:37 - put it in Photoshop and I change the
17:39 - tint to be orange so it looks like a Sun
17:40 - and it kind of looks like the flames are
17:42 - coming out a tie-dye shirt a folder of
17:45 - one of my notebooks and you would have
17:48 - no idea I like it actually looks like
17:50 - planets because of the because it
17:51 - captures the the texture yeah I actually
17:54 - didn't know it that you did that but
17:57 - that's so cool so how did you tell them
17:59 - are there notes that you add to a
18:01 - mission yeah so there's so there's a
18:04 - three essays two of them are optional
18:06 - but the first the first essay is tell us
18:09 - about your playground so you could write
18:11 - up to 500 words explaining all the
18:13 - creative things that you put into your
18:15 - playground
18:15 - because if I didn't explain that then
18:17 - they would have no idea they would have
18:18 - thought I just downloaded it so that's
18:20 - your chance like show how you solve
18:22 - these problems and your creativity
18:24 - behind it very very cool and you shared
18:27 - this source code for all of this stuff
18:28 - yeah all of it is on github
18:30 - now can you tell us a bit about what
18:32 - happened you know and it goes it goes
18:34 - along with how we met - on Instagram
18:37 - yeah so um so when I first started in
18:43 - 2016 I wanted to make the game it's on
18:46 - the App Store's called the spin zone and
18:47 - I was having trouble when I first made
18:50 - it there was no examples online like for
18:52 - example I wanted to hook up Game Center
18:53 - the only thing I had was
18:55 - Apple documentation which is not the
18:57 - best sometimes I wanted like example
18:58 - hood so when I finally got it all
19:01 - finished and already I wanted to put it
19:03 - on github so that other people could
19:05 - also like use it and learn from it
19:08 - a few a few weeks later I found that all
19:11 - of a sudden my my doubt my muse were
19:15 - going up to a hundred thousand and where
19:17 - are all these beans coming from right
19:19 - and actually a week later App Store
19:22 - connect announced a new feature where
19:23 - you could see where all your views are
19:25 - coming from so all of a sudden I'm like
19:28 - whoa I could actually see where they're
19:29 - coming from and they're coming from this
19:31 - random app so I go into the app and it's
19:33 - my app and it and then I I tracked it a
19:36 - little bit more and I found out it was
19:37 - actually number 16 in the entertainment
19:40 - category in China Wow yes and then later
19:45 - on this happened again and it was also
19:48 - becoming popular I found it on the App
19:50 - Store and I I saw like there was getting
19:53 - a lot of ratings a lot of people were on
19:55 - the leaderboards it's called a Reno or
19:58 - something and then I I followed a little
20:01 - bit more
20:01 - I saw it had an Instagram page then I
20:04 - saw that it was Ken that did with it had
20:06 - stories connecting with you and then I
20:08 - saw my app my app like all over the
20:11 - place on these random websites without
20:14 - any credit for me man yeah so that must
20:19 - have been so hard like well be able to
20:21 - get them taken down yes so they were on
20:24 - product Tom I got that was taking down
20:25 - the App Store it's all gone off the App
20:27 - Store and it was also on it was on your
20:29 - Instagram page because they apparently
20:32 - submitted it to you making it look like
20:34 - that they made it but they actually
20:36 - didn't yeah so that was I had the app
20:39 - icon on the app frame behind my wall
20:42 - because someone had submitted it to me
20:45 - and it turns out that they were they had
20:48 - just stolen the code from Nick yeah that
20:52 - that sucks man and then you know you're
20:54 - you're putting this out there for other
20:56 - people to learn from right and right and
20:59 - it's just it's just so sad so where is
21:03 - it now
21:04 - and I see that you put it on the App
21:05 - Store under your name
21:07 - yes it's on my name and well the other
21:11 - people what they also did was they had
21:12 - it adds to it so for me I would never
21:15 - I don't like ads because they're really
21:18 - not user friendly if I were ever to like
21:20 - make money off an app I would do in app
21:21 - purchases but they put ads in the one
21:24 - that I told you about before who made it
21:26 - super high they were getting a hundred
21:27 - thousand downloads in I think a few
21:29 - weeks he was making one hundred and
21:31 - fifty dollars a day off of it until I
21:33 - got it taken down yeah so it's like
21:35 - really sad to see it's cut it's cool
21:37 - because your app is like out there and
21:40 - it's getting downloads but at the same
21:41 - time it you have no credit to it someone
21:43 - else is taking credit to it someone else
21:44 - is earning money from it so it's really
21:46 - sad to see so it was just a verbatim
21:49 - copy except with ads on it exactly yeah
21:52 - and the reason the reason how I found it
21:54 - was because they didn't change the link
21:56 - so when you click the right button it
21:58 - took you to my app instead of their app
22:00 - which is why I was getting so many views
22:02 - I see that guy probably didn't even know
22:06 - what he was looking at in terms of the
22:08 - code
22:09 - yeah can you tell us about the other
22:12 - apps that you have on the story yeah so
22:14 - I have one more app on the store right
22:16 - now it's called smiley I love it and
22:18 - what it does is a thank you what it does
22:21 - is it takes pictures automatically when
22:24 - you're smiling so if you have like five
22:25 - people you hold the phone up y'all
22:28 - highlight who's not smiling in red and
22:29 - once you tell them to smile they'll take
22:31 - the picture it's so convenient because
22:34 - I'm sure everyone has run into this
22:36 - problem before and also when you're
22:38 - trying to take a selfie it's hard for
22:40 - you to get the right angle and then also
22:42 - reach your thumb over and press the
22:44 - button Jack lees yeah yeah so that's one
22:47 - of the reasons how I came up with the
22:48 - idea my family would like to take like
22:50 - group selfies and what would happen is
22:52 - my mom would get everyone ready we would
22:54 - all be smiling she goes to take the
22:56 - picture and she locks the phone instead
22:58 - of clicking the volume button or it's
23:02 - hard to like reach and make sure
23:03 - everyone's face is in it so it like
23:05 - account for all of that automatically
23:06 - take it and another cool feature of it
23:08 - is if you ever use like a timed mode one
23:11 - time when I was hiking me and my dad
23:14 - were hiking and we wanted to take
23:15 - picture of us sitting on a tree which is
23:17 - across the lake right and it took us
23:19 - like a minute to get on the tree so
23:21 - with my app I just set it on the floor
23:23 - pointing at us we go when we climb up
23:26 - the tree sit on the sit on the log and
23:28 - there's like a minute later and then we
23:31 - look at the camera we smile and then it
23:32 - takes the picture contains a yeah
23:35 - scratching your own itch yeah yeah and
23:38 - it uses a this was I made this right
23:41 - after watc last year after I went to one
23:45 - of the vision labs I figured out how to
23:47 - combine vision create amount and quorum
23:50 - oh to make it super accurate Wow and I
23:53 - actually at WCI actually got some some
23:56 - tips from actual Apple designers on how
23:59 - to make the interface a little better
24:01 - support iPad a little bit better than
24:03 - your a better placement some new ideas
24:05 - on how to make it better like for
24:06 - example we were thinking of blink
24:08 - detection so that not only you're
24:10 - smiling but also you're not blinking
24:11 - that's that's awesome and I think
24:14 - because you figured this out on your own
24:16 - and it wasn't like an out of the box
24:17 - solution that there aren't many copycats
24:21 - that at least from what I can see yeah
24:24 - have you tried to look i-i've looked for
24:28 - I've looked for other apps that do this
24:30 - and apparently Samsung does this I found
24:32 - out afterwards
24:33 - I've never used it on a Samsung device
24:35 - but from what people have told to me
24:37 - mine works much better than saying wow
24:40 - they're I haven't found one that works
24:42 - as good as mine or on iOS I've seen
24:46 - other smile apps but they don't work at
24:49 - all like I don't know I think that just
24:52 - randomly taking a picture because I'm
24:53 - not smiling at a stage my picture and
24:55 - there's a startup idea right there yeah
24:59 - that's awesome and I noticed that all
25:01 - the apps that you have you're just
25:03 - there's no way that purchases that
25:05 - doesn't cost any money and you know have
25:07 - you tried to make money off your apps
25:09 - before yeah so right now my apps
25:13 - definitely could make money I think
25:14 - smiley has taken 300 thousand pictures
25:17 - so far I haven't tried to make any money
25:19 - off of it mostly because I want to spend
25:21 - my time like more like learning then
25:24 - figuring out how to do in-app purchases
25:26 - kind of because I could I could figure
25:30 - out like here I could put like a
25:32 - watermark and you know you pick me and I
25:34 - tend to get rid of the water more
25:35 - it's something I would definitely want
25:36 - to do because I spend a lot of time on
25:38 - it but it's just it's not like a
25:41 - priority like it's not that main reason
25:42 - why I do it that's awesome I actually
25:45 - had Adrian from our team he was trying
25:48 - to fool it he couldn't fool it yeah you
25:53 - guys got to check out this out so you
25:56 - know how did you get to this point in
25:59 - terms of skill and also discovering
26:02 - coding and falling in love with it
26:04 - because it sounds to me like you have a
26:06 - real passion for it yeah for it just
26:09 - like it's just coming up with ideas
26:11 - wanted to do something having no clue
26:14 - how to do it and just figuring out as
26:17 - you go because when I first started
26:18 - smiley the model it was not accurate at
26:21 - all like it barely worked but I knew
26:23 - like it kind of worked so at first I had
26:27 - no clue what to do I I looked at their
26:30 - apples documentation for the vision
26:31 - framework core create a malkor ml and
26:34 - they have really good documentation so
26:36 - that's like a great place to look at and
26:38 - you just you could just like figure as
26:40 - you go you could Google I spent a lot of
26:43 - time googling I like it took me a week
26:46 - to make the data set and I had no clue
26:48 - about machine learning or any of it
26:50 - before but asking questions other people
26:53 - like who know about machine learning but
26:56 - when I went to WDC I went to the labs
26:58 - and I just asked them questions on how I
27:01 - could get into it what tools I should
27:03 - use I watched a lot of YouTube tutorials
27:05 - before I started it and then when I had
27:08 - the idea I knew I wanted to do it I knew
27:10 - what happened was popular like it was
27:12 - definitely possible like I can
27:13 - definitely do it it was just a matter of
27:14 - how to use create a mount for my own
27:17 - vision to actually do it that's awesome
27:20 - but going back even further like when
27:23 - did you first start programming so so
27:26 - that was when and I was about 13 and 7th
27:32 - grade and I would play minecraft a lot
27:34 - and it was very popular and it still is
27:38 - which they actually just presented my
27:41 - car we're just cool but yeah that's how
27:45 - I got it started because what would
27:47 - happen is I would go on a serve
27:49 - right they'd have all these cool plugins
27:51 - and one day someone joined and they were
27:54 - like go look at my plug-in and it was a
27:56 - very simple plugin and then I'm just
27:58 - like hmm maybe I could do this so I made
28:01 - my own plugin and it got after like a
28:04 - ton of like YouTube tutorials a ton of
28:06 - thing you're not how to do it I was 13 I
28:08 - published my own one and it got I think
28:12 - it has about 160,000 downloads right now
28:14 - and that's why I first started just
28:15 - because I wanted to just know how to do
28:17 - it because I would play the game and I
28:19 - wanted to like actually know how can I
28:22 - make my own and I wanted to just share
28:25 - it and see it's really cool to see your
28:27 - own plug-in on on a server that other
28:29 - people are playing with and then from
28:31 - there I made more I made one that was
28:34 - paid and I started earning money from it
28:36 - and then from that point when I finished
28:39 - it was it was 2014 Swift came out and a
28:43 - year later I really wanted to get into
28:45 - app development because there's such a
28:47 - big audience there I'm not just limited
28:49 - to a specific market and then I and then
28:52 - I got into iOS I learned Swift I bought
28:54 - I think two books and I watched some
28:58 - really good videos I remember you were
28:59 - one of the first people that start I
29:01 - started watching
29:02 - I specifically remember I think it was
29:05 - like a card game that's so awesome yeah
29:07 - I had a couple of those out there this
29:09 - tutorials yeah I remember the yeah the n
29:12 - dice rollin yeah yeah that one the felt
29:16 - background before yeah yeah the iOS 7
29:20 - change that's awesome so it sounds like
29:23 - you just basically did a lot of googling
29:25 - and self-study yeah and I think yeah for
29:28 - me we're really helpless me is like
29:31 - reading books I bought an iOS book and I
29:33 - swept the book and also the swept some
29:35 - Swift's me like swept a book that they
29:39 - released and when I did minecraft I
29:42 - really didn't know
29:43 - minecraft plugins I didn't really know
29:44 - what I was doing I was just like typing
29:46 - stuff see if it worked watching YouTube
29:48 - tutorial like copy and pasting and then
29:50 - the cool thing is is when you do that
29:52 - even though you have no idea what you're
29:53 - doing you pick up on like patterns that
29:55 - are happening and then when you actually
29:57 - go to learn it right when you when you
29:59 - look at like design patterns and
30:02 - had to actually read documentation you
30:04 - look back at that and you're like you
30:06 - you think of you're like I want to
30:09 - rewrite the whole thing because you
30:10 - realize there's so many better ways to
30:12 - do it and you realize why things are in
30:14 - place Wow
30:15 - so you were able to create a whole bunch
30:17 - of Minecraft plugins and you had no idea
30:19 - what you were doing yeah yeah and then
30:22 - when you finally figure out what you're
30:24 - doing it's much easier because you've
30:26 - been doing it you didn't know why you
30:28 - were doing it but then you learn while
30:29 - you're doing it and you're like oh
30:30 - that's why that's it there's like a lot
30:32 - of like clicking moments where you just
30:34 - like oh that's why I was doing that and
30:36 - then it all just it's like it's hard
30:38 - because like it's self-taught but
30:40 - there's a lot of moments where it just
30:42 - clicks in and you're like you just
30:44 - realize what you're doing and then from
30:46 - there you could take it to other stuff
30:49 - in and it just makes so much more sense
30:51 - but that's such a good feeling right
30:53 - yeah just it clicks yes exactly so all
30:57 - the time like the bugging and figure out
30:58 - why something will work it all like pays
31:00 - off when you finally like understand
31:02 - what it is that's awesome so with spins
31:06 - on your first iOS app then yes it was my
31:10 - first night with that oh wow look at
31:13 - that it just it was a huge success from
31:16 - the get-go your first app yeah yeah I
31:18 - added a then I added like force touch
31:21 - and I designed the whole UI I went
31:24 - through like 15 different iterations of
31:26 - the UI until I finally decided on it and
31:29 - it took me a couple of months because I
31:32 - had no clue what I was doing then did
31:35 - you have any idea about game development
31:37 - and and the process of figuring out
31:40 - whether it's fun or not you know all of
31:41 - that um for that I mostly just I I
31:47 - figured it was like one of those
31:48 - addictive games like you just keep
31:51 - clicking and trying to escape the circle
31:53 - and then I would like give it to other
31:55 - people and they were like oh this is fun
31:56 - they would get addicted and then I would
31:59 - see them using it and then for actually
32:01 - designing it since I'm not a designer
32:03 - I've never designed before it was just a
32:05 - matter of like does this look good does
32:07 - this not look good how can I do this in
32:09 - sprite kit is it possible and it worked
32:13 - out it worked out really well I hate the
32:15 - because I've read about game development
32:18 - a little bit and it seems like they go
32:20 - through such a rigorous process just to
32:22 - find an idea that is fun and then they
32:26 - build upon that and then they you know
32:27 - take it to the finished product but you
32:30 - know you were your own guinea pig
32:32 - yeah yeah just keep testing it and
32:34 - actually the idea originally originally
32:37 - I saw an icon somewhere on github
32:39 - somewhere where it had this like a ring
32:42 - was like a hole in it and then I was
32:44 - just looking at it and then the idea
32:46 - just came into place like what if you're
32:47 - trying to escape that one then it's like
32:49 - in a circle you know coming twist key
32:51 - are you planning to make any more games
32:53 - um well right now I'm more focusing on
32:56 - more productive like productivity or
33:00 - utilities that are that can like make
33:03 - things easier for you or something
33:04 - that's with like AR that's useful than
33:07 - games because games are really cool but
33:10 - there's it's such a there's just so many
33:12 - games out there and I wanted to make
33:13 - something that's useful like smiley I
33:15 - figure if you hand someone a game they
33:17 - play it for a day or two maybe a week
33:19 - and then they get bored of it where if
33:21 - you make like a Productivity app they're
33:23 - like whenever they go to take a picture
33:25 - they take out smiley and there it is
33:27 - it's something that they keep coming
33:28 - back to and they like it helps them
33:31 - which eye is more is a very satisfactory
33:34 - than me to see people using it and like
33:36 - looking at my dashboard and seeing
33:38 - hundreds sometimes thousands of pictures
33:40 - getting taken daily awesome that's so
33:44 - awesome
33:44 - do you have any other ideas I don't want
33:48 - you to you suppose something that you're
33:50 - working on but oh yeah do you have plans
33:54 - for morei orchid apps yeah coming up are
33:56 - you working on stuff definitely
33:58 - especially with all the new stuff that
34:00 - they announce I have like a Notes app
34:02 - with like a whole bunch of ideas like
34:04 - dozens of ideas and I'm trying to go
34:07 - through pick the best one and more ideas
34:09 - coming with all the new stuff and stuff
34:12 - that are available and the new
34:13 - frameworks mm-hmm so about that if you
34:16 - have you know I always have a ton of app
34:19 - ideas too but I never can figure out
34:22 - like I might start a bunch of them but
34:25 - it's hard to take it to the end like
34:28 - it's really really hard to
34:29 - complete a project at least for me do
34:31 - you have any trouble with that yes I I
34:33 - do but the main way that I get past that
34:37 - is by picking a topic that I really
34:40 - really enjoy and it just like sucks you
34:43 - in like for example when I made smiley
34:45 - at first I didn't want to I was like I
34:47 - was kind of hesitant to even start
34:50 - because there's so many roadblocks that
34:53 - you don't know of but then once you
34:54 - start and you see that the one little
34:57 - point where it actually works like the
34:59 - first model it didn't work but it had a
35:01 - label that would kind of tell if you're
35:03 - smiling or not like perfect conditions
35:05 - and then from there like it sucks you
35:07 - and you're like well what if I could
35:08 - make this better and then I make it
35:10 - better and then it works it actually
35:11 - works and then the UI I'm like how can I
35:14 - make the UI good and then the first one
35:16 - looks bad but then I get a little hint
35:18 - of like this is actually really cool and
35:20 - then I make the UI super nice like I was
35:22 - spending like I would wake up at like
35:24 - 8:00 and go to bed at like 2:00 at some
35:27 - points like just working on the app
35:29 - trying to make it super perfect because
35:31 - like I was super interested in it and
35:33 - and I just want to show people but I
35:35 - didn't show them until it was done and I
35:37 - wanted to like thinking of that it that
35:41 - it's gonna be on the App Store and
35:42 - you're finally able to show it kind of
35:44 - motivates you to work and make it
35:46 - perfect so that when it's on the store
35:49 - and you go send it to somebody you're
35:51 - like really proud of it and it motivates
35:53 - you to make it really good and to keep
35:55 - keep going even though at some point so
35:57 - there are some crazy bugs or they got
35:59 - rejected from the app store twice but
36:01 - still it motivates you to keep going and
36:03 - eventually share it with everybody and
36:06 - then to see it on the stores is a really
36:08 - good feeling afterwards that's such a
36:10 - good way to approach it because for me
36:13 - it's it's always thinking about how
36:15 - viable is this idea in terms of you know
36:18 - K does it have legs to to gain an
36:20 - audience and to you know be monetized
36:22 - and stuff like that but if it doesn't
36:24 - align with your passion and what you're
36:26 - interested in and it's really hard to do
36:28 - it for that reason
36:29 - yeah exactly and especially if it's
36:31 - something you will use like my family
36:33 - uses this app my my app like whenever we
36:36 - take a picture cuz and it motivates you
36:39 - because you know it's actually going to
36:40 - be used even if it's not used by
36:42 - everybody and it
36:43 - they grab super attention you're making
36:46 - it so that if you like it I'm sure a
36:48 - bunch of people will like it and have
36:50 - the same problem that needs to get
36:51 - solved yeah yeah that's that's that's
36:54 - gonna be the way that I approach it from
36:56 - now on so so you're in school right now
37:00 - first year yes I just finished my first
37:02 - year Oh awesome Congrats on that thank
37:04 - you so you also had interviews with
37:08 - Apple for is it like a four part-time
37:10 - job for a full-time job what was that
37:12 - about it was for the intern it was for
37:14 - an internship in the summer okay so I
37:17 - had a few weeks ago in February I had an
37:20 - interview requests from the apke team so
37:22 - I got an email from a recruiter asking
37:25 - for my availability so that they could
37:26 - schedule an interview for me and then
37:29 - the next day I got another interview
37:30 - request from the SPG team which is the
37:33 - special product group which is working
37:35 - all the special projects at Apple like
37:37 - for example before the Apple watch was
37:39 - announced they were the ones who were
37:40 - all of the like design for it and
37:43 - getting the first prototype out and
37:45 - seeing is this a good product they're
37:47 - probably working on a whole bunch of
37:49 - secret stuff right now that was about
37:50 - yeah that sounds like a cool team to be
37:53 - on definitely
37:54 - so how was that interview process like
37:56 - yeah so what happens is the recruiter
37:59 - reaches out to you they ask you know are
38:01 - you interested
38:02 - and of course Apple and then they ask
38:04 - for your availability a day later day or
38:07 - two later another person messages you
38:09 - confirming the timeslot you message back
38:12 - you confirm with them and then you will
38:14 - talk with an actual engineer on the team
38:17 - so sometimes the technical interview
38:20 - where they'll actually take you to a
38:22 - website and you have and they give you a
38:24 - programming question and you actually
38:25 - have to solve it you can use any
38:27 - language that you want even I remember
38:29 - one of them they asked I they said I can
38:30 - do pseudocode they just wanted to make
38:32 - sure that you know you know you the fun
38:33 - different the fundamentals and you could
38:35 - figure out a problem they don't care
38:37 - about like do you know how to write
38:38 - Swick you can use any language as long
38:40 - as you can tackle a problem and solve it
38:42 - something and then those are technical
38:43 - interviews and then there's another type
38:45 - of technical interviews where they just
38:47 - ask like general questions like about
38:49 - your experience and they usually tie it
38:51 - to what they're working on like if they
38:54 - ask you a question about like
38:56 - ask you a question about someone like
38:57 - you I like how would you design a UI or
38:59 - like what what kind of design patterns
39:01 - do you know like do you know what and VC
39:04 - is questions like that those are less
39:06 - stressful because you know they're not
39:08 - giving you an actual question then you
39:09 - have to take that in front of them and
39:10 - like explain your thinking and then
39:11 - those are the two types of interviews I
39:13 - think mine were I had to for each team
39:16 - so four in total and one was technical
39:19 - where I was solving the problem and
39:21 - another was just to talk with another
39:24 - member on the team to make sure you know
39:25 - you're a good fit your your skillset
39:27 - aligns with their skill set and a really
39:30 - important thing is every team is
39:31 - different for the apke team they asked
39:34 - me totally different questions than the
39:36 - SBG team because every every team is
39:39 - different so they they normally asked
39:41 - like data structure questions but some
39:43 - teams don't even ask that some teams
39:45 - just they just talk with you for a
39:47 - little bit and then they see if you're a
39:49 - good fit and then you would get an email
39:51 - with an offer to actually an internship
39:55 - so they're both for an internship for
39:57 - summer 2019 which is this summer that's
40:00 - so awesome because I didn't know that
40:02 - they just reach out to people for
40:04 - internships I thought wow is Nick going
40:07 - to quit school and go full-time but yeah
40:12 - I know what are your career goals for
40:14 - after school did you have you thought
40:16 - about that yeah definitely so I think
40:19 - right now right I want to the cool thing
40:23 - right now is I could just try a whole
40:25 - bunch cuz I have like another three
40:26 - years to decide exactly but the cool
40:29 - thing is I have my summers open so that
40:31 - I can internships right right so I
40:34 - internship at a startup to see like what
40:36 - what is what is it like working on a
40:37 - start-up like a very very very small
40:39 - start-up then this year I'm working at a
40:41 - bigger company and then next year I
40:44 - could work at an even bigger company and
40:46 - see like do I want to work at a small
40:47 - company do I want to work at a big
40:49 - company or if I have a really good app
40:51 - idea I just don't have to work at a
40:53 - company at all and I could work on my
40:54 - own stuff so right now I'm more testing
40:58 - to see what kind of like culture I like
41:00 - you I have I have a few more spaces open
41:03 - for internships so that I could even
41:05 - like pick between different companies if
41:09 - I get an interview
41:10 - I get an internship at Google and then
41:11 - when an apple you know I could really
41:13 - see what the atmosphere is liking and
41:15 - then when I graduate try and get a
41:18 - full-time position or even just make my
41:20 - own company with my own app if I have an
41:22 - idea then yeah
41:24 - it certainly looks like you have no
41:27 - shortage of app ideas yeah and and I
41:30 - really this is I'm doing this not
41:32 - because I want to work at Apple or
41:34 - something it's more because I want to I
41:36 - want to like see fully all the choices
41:39 - available I don't want to be super now
41:41 - and be like oh I want to make a company
41:43 - because what if I go to a company I
41:44 - really like it or if I don't have an app
41:47 - idea and even though I want to make a
41:49 - company I don't want to force in half
41:50 - idea just to make a company because then
41:52 - I'm not really doing something that I
41:54 - want to do I'm just doing it so I could
41:55 - have a company or just work in a company
41:58 - because I want to work at that company I
42:00 - like to have like I want to try a whole
42:02 - bunch of stuff and see which which one I
42:04 - like the best now is there anything at
42:06 - school that helps you with these
42:08 - internships are you looking for these
42:11 - yourself
42:11 - so my college I go to Georgia Tech and
42:15 - what they do is they a lot of companies
42:18 - visit us we're able to talk directly
42:20 - with recruiters so for example uber will
42:22 - visit Amazon Facebook Google they all
42:25 - come here you could talk directly with
42:26 - the recruiters and there's special
42:28 - sessions throughout the year where it's
42:30 - like taught to eat your Google interview
42:31 - and they they give you Google Google
42:33 - interview questions that were in the
42:35 - past
42:36 - they give you mock interviews the career
42:38 - fair there's a career fair that comes
42:39 - here or there's tons of companies and
42:41 - you can just go up to a company and
42:43 - learn more about them see if they have
42:45 - any internships available oh that's such
42:47 - a cool process yeah that's so good in
42:50 - anything yeah now beyond apps do you
42:52 - have any other I guess passions you want
42:55 - to pursue um that try out mmm it's all
43:01 - really into apps I think drone flying
43:07 - that seems super fun haha yeah my few my
43:12 - friends have a few drones and that's
43:13 - really cool to do that's cool I've never
43:15 - flown one myself
43:17 - yeah and you feel like you design you
43:19 - can design your own the one you build it
43:21 - you order the parts it's like yeah
43:23 - you're building your own
43:24 - thing and then you get to see it fly wow
43:27 - that's cool and you know outfit them
43:30 - however you want yeah so you know last
43:37 - last thing I want to ask you is any
43:39 - advice you can give to other young
43:42 - students who are trying to pursue either
43:46 - computer science or software engineer
43:48 - and they're not sure it's for them I
43:50 - would definitely like if you're even if
43:55 - you don't know how to do something like
43:57 - try not to be very doubtful and just do
44:01 - it because you know if it doesn't work
44:04 - it doesn't work but being like oh it's
44:06 - not going to work that just like put you
44:08 - in a block and you'll never be able to
44:09 - actually try like when I first started
44:11 - with plugins if I was like oh I can't do
44:13 - that a lot of people like friends of
44:16 - mines are like wow you can make ax I
44:18 - would never know how to do that and
44:19 - automatically they're failing because
44:21 - they're saying they can't but if you if
44:24 - you are motivated and you like research
44:27 - and you're interested in it it'll
44:30 - definitely just come to you and you will
44:33 - just want to like learn how to do it and
44:35 - then like just Google YouTube books try
44:41 - to figure out your best way of learning
44:42 - mine was books so I just went through
44:45 - and got a whole bunch of like Swift
44:47 - books or Java books design pattern books
44:49 - and then find your best way of learning
44:52 - and then just focus on doing that way
44:54 - that's such good good advice because
44:58 - your mindset has so much to do with you
45:02 - know what you can and can't do yeah yeah
45:06 - because it's a lot of a mindset if you
45:08 - go into a project or if I when I wanted
45:11 - smiley if all that's just like detecting
45:13 - smile I need to be a machine learning
45:15 - like professional but you don't if you
45:19 - just Google like you have Google if you
45:21 - just cool and you don't like try and
45:23 - doubt everything and actually try that's
45:27 - like the first step and then if it works
45:29 - then it like it pulls you in and then
45:31 - you want to care more stuff yeah and you
45:34 - know ironically this is the trap that I
45:36 - just demonstrated
45:37 - in this chat because I was telling you
45:39 - before about a art kit right and about
45:43 - three models and like I don't know how
45:45 - to do that but see so I didn't either
45:50 - I had no clue how to do it when I
45:52 - started my first when I do my first
45:55 - playground in it I no clue how to do it
45:57 - and then just if you just google and
45:59 - read Apple documentation find a book or
46:02 - a video or whatever the best way to do
46:03 - it is then you're just you're like I
46:06 - don't know how to do that and then you
46:07 - go read a tutorial you place a block on
46:09 - the table and it's very simple but then
46:11 - it pulls you in because you're like whoa
46:13 - I just put a block on the table and then
46:15 - you can put more blocks in that
46:16 - animation and then you come up with an
46:18 - idea and then you can make it do
46:19 - something and then it just keeps on
46:21 - adding so just to wrap it up any last
46:27 - words that you want to mention where
46:29 - people can find out but more about you
46:31 - or where they can connect with you yeah
46:34 - I have a I have Twitter Instagram those
46:37 - are both at Nicholas karana with two
46:40 - ways so and I CH Ola s GRA and a a my
46:46 - direct messages are open so like anyone
46:50 - people you message me all the time like
46:52 - asking for your eyes I always respond
46:54 - always so it's also that's a great way
46:57 - to uh to get to me awesome well thank
47:02 - you so much Nick for coming on this chat
47:04 - yeah thank you I learned a ton about AR
47:08 - kit it's super inspiring to hear about
47:11 - your story and your attitude you know
47:14 - that you take towards these things and
47:16 - you know my takeaway from this is that
47:19 - you know I I need to adopt some of that
47:21 - attitude of yours yeah and really the
47:25 - sky's the limit and with the resources
47:27 - are available now I don't think anybody
47:29 - should say that they can't do something
47:32 - yeah and it all started like in that
47:36 - position watching your videos like the
47:39 - same exact resources everyone else has
47:41 - it's just a matter of using them I
47:43 - remember I was watching my first video
47:45 - DC right and they're they're like
47:47 - congratulations to her scholarship
47:49 - winners and I'm like I
47:51 - to be a scholarship winner and go to go
47:53 - there and then I I figured out how to do
47:56 - it I and then I just did it so you were
48:00 - at WWDC before you were a scholar
48:03 - oh when I was watching on the live
48:05 - screen live livestream at my house
48:08 - yeah that's an amazing story okay well
