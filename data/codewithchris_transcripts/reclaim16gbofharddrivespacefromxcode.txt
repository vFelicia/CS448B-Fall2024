00:05 - hey guys what's up it's Chris here in
00:07 - this quick video I just like to share
00:09 - this tip with you which helped me
00:11 - reclaim a ton of disk space from Xcode I
00:14 - don't know if you've noticed but Xcode
00:16 - actually takes up quite a bit of hard
00:17 - drive space I recently joined this
00:19 - mailing list called iOS dev Nuggets it's
00:21 - a free newsletter that comes out every
00:24 - Friday Saturday with bite-sized tips and
00:27 - tricks for iOS development that often
00:29 - only take a couple of minutes to read
00:30 - it's curated and created by cui Boonen
00:34 - sorry if I mispronounced your name but
00:36 - there's some really good stuff here so I
00:38 - was browsing the archive and I came
00:39 - across this one reclaimed disk space
00:42 - from Xcode I was curious how much disk
00:46 - space Xcode was actually using and I'm
00:50 - not going to reveal it right now let me
00:51 - just show you as I delete it in front of
00:53 - your eyes how much space I'm reclaiming
00:56 - and I'm just going to demonstrate it
00:58 - right now you go into finder drill down
01:02 - into your hard drive and you're going to
01:04 - see the library folder you can see here
01:06 - the paths that we want our library
01:08 - developer Xcode and it's not this one
01:11 - but it's actually the library folder
01:12 - specific to your user account so as you
01:16 - can see under Chris here there's a
01:18 - library folder this is the one you want
01:20 - if you don't see one for yourself you
01:22 - actually need to it's hidden by default
01:25 - so you need to reveal it and what you
01:28 - want to do is you have to go into your
01:30 - user account folder you actually have to
01:32 - dive into this folder and you want to
01:34 - click this little gear you want to go to
01:36 - show view options and you're going to
01:39 - see this check mark show library folder
01:43 - and you want to enable that now if you
01:44 - don't see this that means you're
01:46 - probably not you're not probably not
01:49 - inside your user account folder it's not
01:51 - enough to just you know start expanding
01:54 - the tabs and you know go like this and
01:57 - then to like this and show view options
02:00 - you can see that it doesn't exist you
02:02 - actually have to double click and go
02:04 - into that folder okay then you're going
02:06 - to go show the options and enable this
02:09 - show library folder okay so with that
02:12 - out of the way let's go into library
02:13 - let's go into developer let's go into
02:20 - Xcode here I've already got that open
02:22 - and we want to get rid of two folders
02:25 - derived data all right let's open this
02:29 - up actually before I open up let's go
02:32 - see how much space this would reclaim so
02:35 - this one is okay
02:36 - I would reclaim 600 megabytes you know
02:40 - it's a good space there and this is just
02:44 - data for each of the projects you're
02:46 - working on they just get regenerated
02:48 - anyways so sometimes if you haven't
02:51 - touched projects like you've moved on
02:53 - and you're working on other projects you
02:54 - can delete the drive data from old
02:57 - projects and even your current project
02:59 - when you rebuild your project it's just
03:00 - going to recreate that stuff this one's
03:03 - a biggie though under iOS device support
03:07 - so it's a combination of iOS physical
03:10 - device you have plugged in an iOS
03:12 - version you are running with it and if
03:15 - you have been doing iOS for a while you
03:17 - might have accrued a number of these
03:18 - folders they will be regenerated for you
03:21 - when you plug in a device okay so let's
03:24 - see get info this guy is a whopping for
03:30 - me at least fifteen point five five gigs
03:32 - I'm going to go ahead and go in there
03:37 - and delete that that and obviously I'll
03:41 - have to empty my trash as well to
03:44 - reclaim that space but I just got back
03:46 - like 16 gigs yeah so that's it I'm
03:49 - interested to see how much space you
03:52 - guys have reclaimed so leave a comment
03:54 - below the video if you actually do this
03:56 - and let me know if you can beat 16 gigs
03:58 - or even if you don't let me know how
04:01 - much did how much harddrive space you've
04:03 - saved and if you've enjoyed this tip you
04:05 - can browse the archives if you like
04:07 - other tips make sure you join iOS
04:09 - delegates and last thing is before I
04:12 - sign off I just figured I should mention
04:14 - that I'm not getting anything from this
04:16 - I just discovered iOS dev Nuggets and I
04:18 - thought that it was really useful so I'm
04:20 - sharing with you guys I haven't met or
04:22 - even talked to Hui boon before
04:24 - and yeah I don't knock anything from
04:26 - this alright so enjoy and I'll see you
