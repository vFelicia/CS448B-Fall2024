00:01 - [Music]
00:06 - hey it's chris here
00:07 - and today i want to tell you about this
00:09 - thing that we're doing for the next
00:11 - three months called the
00:12 - three month app case study essentially
00:14 - we are going to try to
00:16 - build an app prototype get it launched
00:17 - into the store and get our first
00:19 - customer in three months
00:21 - now we've already started and this is
00:23 - day five
00:24 - of the experiment i'm going to be
00:26 - sharing the
00:27 - progress and the process on youtube and
00:30 - social media
00:31 - but before i get into what's happened in
00:34 - the last
00:35 - four days i want to tell you about why
00:38 - we're doing this and
00:39 - the motivation behind this whole
00:40 - experiment you see when i talk with the
00:43 - people who are learning with us
00:45 - i realize that a lot of people have app
00:47 - ideas that they want to build
00:48 - that they think are going to be a great
00:50 - success and
00:52 - you know it's not enough to teach people
00:54 - how to build the app
00:56 - but also you know how they can
00:59 - achieve success with the app this the
01:01 - same success that they're imagining that
01:03 - they will have
01:04 - once it's built but i realize that i
01:06 - don't have any experience
01:07 - in that regard when i used to build apps
01:10 - for clients
01:11 - at my old job we weren't invested in the
01:13 - outcome
01:15 - and there was no emotional investment in
01:17 - it either
01:18 - and now that i've started this process
01:22 - i'm learning so many different things
01:24 - because
01:25 - it's being approached from a different
01:27 - perspective right and i realized that it
01:29 - is a very emotional journey you're
01:31 - really
01:32 - invested in your idea and you really
01:34 - want it to succeed
01:35 - and there's moments where you really
01:37 - don't think it's gonna work and this is
01:39 - just the first four
01:39 - days so the motivation behind this again
01:44 - is a learning experience right so that
01:47 - i know what it's like to
01:51 - try to build a successful app and the
01:53 - reason that
01:54 - i'm documenting everything is so that
01:56 - people can learn from it
01:58 - and then also i can look back on it as
02:00 - well it'll be quite a journey
02:02 - so i want there actually to be two
02:04 - results that come out of this
02:05 - one is the actual three month app case
02:08 - study
02:08 - whether it is whether we meet our goal
02:11 - or not i still think it's going to be a
02:13 - great case study
02:14 - lots of lessons to be learned there but
02:16 - throughout that process i also want to
02:18 - put together
02:19 - a product framework the steps that we
02:22 - took
02:22 - to run our three-month app case study
02:25 - and since
02:26 - we don't know what we're doing right now
02:29 - this framework is sort of a best guess
02:31 - and we're proving it through the case
02:32 - study
02:33 - and then we sort of tweak the framework
02:34 - as we go along
02:36 - all right so with that out of the way
02:38 - let's jump into what's happened so far
02:40 - in the last four days
02:43 - all right so what are we building what's
02:45 - the app idea here
02:46 - so to put it succinctly you
02:50 - know how there are app builders out
02:52 - there
02:53 - where you can put together an app
02:55 - without necessarily learning how to code
02:57 - night i realize the irony here um
03:00 - but there are companies like build fire
03:04 - and appy pie where you can put together
03:08 - an app without
03:09 - necessarily learning how to code and
03:13 - i feel like these things are on trend
03:15 - because with any sort of technology
03:18 - or anything really the barrier to entry
03:20 - is usually really high in the beginning
03:22 - and then as time goes on that uh barrier
03:26 - lowers so i i do think these
03:29 - app builders are low code or no code
03:32 - solutions are on trend
03:34 - and you can kind of see the same thing
03:35 - happening with websites for example back
03:38 - then
03:39 - it was really expensive to get a website
03:40 - built and not everyone
03:42 - had a website and these days it's so
03:44 - easy to set up you can even set up your
03:46 - own
03:46 - you know ecommerce stores with like wix
03:49 - squarespace shopify that sort of thing
03:52 - and a lot of people have websites now
03:54 - hosting is a lot cheaper so the barrier
03:55 - to entry has gone
03:56 - a lot lower you think about things like
03:59 - 3d printers
04:00 - and i recently heard that in this year's
04:02 - ces there was like
04:03 - a soft-serve ice cream maker that you
04:06 - can buy for
04:07 - your home use and you can put these pods
04:10 - in and could
04:10 - instantly have soft-serve ice cream for
04:13 - whatever flavor you want so
04:15 - anyways i think mobile apps will
04:17 - eventually
04:18 - get to that situation too where you
04:20 - don't necessarily have to learn how to
04:21 - code to build one
04:24 - so what is the difference between what
04:26 - we're doing and what these
04:28 - people are doing well i want to
04:32 - do this but for a very targeted audience
04:36 - so while these companies they
04:39 - i think you can see here they advertise
04:43 - all sorts of different apps and my
04:46 - thinking is that
04:47 - if i target and intimately get to know
04:50 - one group of people that
04:53 - our solution will be completely 100
04:57 - tailored to their needs
04:58 - and so will be the go-to solution for
05:01 - that
05:02 - target demographic the and that
05:05 - demographic that i'm choosing
05:06 - initially are youtubers um content
05:09 - creators like myself
05:11 - and that's because i i figure you know i
05:13 - know the audience
05:15 - i think i do and uh and in my mind
05:18 - you know it would be cool to have an app
05:20 - and as a
05:21 - content creator and entrepreneur i think
05:24 - that
05:25 - having your own branded app in the app
05:27 - store
05:28 - is is something that you'd want but for
05:31 - for me for code with chris at least it
05:33 - was never a priority
05:36 - however we actually do have an app in
05:38 - the app store by the way
05:40 - so shout out to david ravinsky chris
05:42 - parker and that team here at code with
05:44 - chris for putting this together
05:46 - um we never really talked about this app
05:49 - or told anyone about it and the reason
05:51 - for that was
05:53 - at that time we were still working on
05:55 - the swift ui 14 day beginner challenge
05:57 - and i wanted to wait
05:58 - to incorporate those lessons into the
06:01 - app
06:01 - instead of the ui kit lessons that it's
06:04 - now using
06:05 - um and so i wanted it to display those
06:07 - swift ui lessons before doing a big
06:09 - um sort of marketing publicity push but
06:13 - even though i haven't told anyone about
06:15 - it it's still getting
06:17 - like 90 downloads a day sorry a month
06:20 - which you know is surprising to me
06:23 - because i thought no one would know
06:24 - about it
06:25 - so it's coming up probably for terms
06:27 - like swift programming
06:29 - ios xcode code with chris so people
06:33 - are are finding it still through app
06:35 - store search
06:37 - so i just imagine like if i were to
06:41 - put you know a notice everywhere that we
06:44 - have a mobile app and you can download
06:45 - and use it that
06:46 - you know how much more exposure we could
06:48 - get with this
06:49 - so that's the idea initially to allow
06:53 - youtube creators to easily have their
06:56 - own branded app and
06:57 - they would be able to create an account
07:00 - configure some details upload
07:02 - their brand assets and they would have
07:04 - their own branded app
07:05 - now beyond just surfacing their content
07:08 - we would also add additional
07:10 - monetization features
07:12 - to that app that could potentially turn
07:15 - that
07:16 - app into a revenue stream for that
07:18 - content creator
07:20 - so while i was discussing with the team
07:24 - about what this app would look like um
07:26 - here are just some
07:28 - i wouldn't even call these wireframes
07:30 - but just some scribbles that i put
07:31 - together
07:32 - as we were having our meeting to discuss
07:34 - sort of what this would look like
07:36 - so imagine maybe a fictional
07:39 - youtube content creator named carly and
07:42 - she teaches yoga on youtube
07:44 - uh the basic app would be something like
07:46 - this where
07:47 - it would be a collection of her best
07:50 - content
07:51 - or maybe a learning path that you walk
07:54 - someone through
07:55 - um this basic experience might be
07:58 - categories of different types of
08:00 - poses and stretches and stuff like that
08:03 - and then
08:03 - people could watch the content by
08:06 - clicking into it
08:07 - and it would still be a very useful app
08:09 - right people looking for yoga
08:10 - or maybe searching her brand name would
08:12 - find this app and download it and
08:14 - you can optionally have a profile screen
08:16 - here
08:18 - and all of this would be configurable
08:19 - through the back end
08:21 - and in addition to that depending on how
08:23 - much time investment
08:25 - carly wants to put into this app there
08:28 - are additional
08:29 - monetization features that she could
08:31 - turn on
08:32 - such as maybe a recommended gear screen
08:36 - because
08:38 - i think if you're a content creator or
08:40 - an influencer or youtuber or whatever
08:43 - you get a lot of questions like what
08:44 - gear do you use
08:46 - um and i think that's a very warranted
08:48 - question when i
08:49 - explore a new topic that's what i think
08:52 - about
08:52 - as well what are the professionals or
08:54 - the people who are doing this
08:56 - day-to-day what tools are they using
08:58 - right and you want
08:59 - good recommendations so um this is an
09:02 - opportunity for
09:03 - the content creator to recommend
09:05 - whatever equipment they
09:06 - might be using and they could
09:07 - potentially link to places that
09:09 - the user can go and buy this equipment
09:11 - and if those places offer let's say
09:14 - um referrals or affiliate uh links or
09:17 - whatever
09:18 - then that could potentially help the
09:20 - content
09:21 - creator earn more revenue for their
09:23 - business
09:24 - some people some content creators have
09:26 - merch right so this would be an
09:27 - opportunity to list some merch as well
09:30 - uh and then
09:31 - right here let's talk about the premium
09:34 - content first
09:36 - this sort of goes this is pretty
09:39 - easy to understand it's basically
09:40 - paywall paywall to content
09:42 - so if people are you know really liking
09:46 - your stuff here
09:47 - they might consider unlocking additional
09:50 - lessons or additional content
09:52 - through one-time purchase or
09:54 - subscriptions or something like that i
09:55 - think it'll remain to be seen what we
09:57 - want to
09:58 - allow the the youtuber to do
10:01 - so you can have locked content i think
10:03 - this is a pretty cool idea here
10:05 - would be personal advice or critique on
10:08 - certain things
10:09 - so if you are let's say a golf teacher
10:13 - or athletic trainer or fitness trainer
10:16 - or something like that
10:17 - where people can sort of have be able to
10:20 - pay
10:21 - to get a critique maybe the user can
10:25 - upload a record and upload a video or
10:27 - upload an image
10:29 - and then the content creator can also go
10:32 - through the app
10:33 - receive that request review the
10:36 - video and then record a critique and
10:40 - send it back to the user
10:41 - so then it becomes like a personal
10:43 - connection to that
10:44 - influencer or that content creator and
10:47 - this could be an additional source
10:49 - for them and obviously this is
10:52 - not super scalable for the content
10:54 - creator but
10:56 - for maybe a smaller content creator who
10:58 - doesn't have
10:59 - a lot of established revenue sources yet
11:01 - this could be a good way
11:03 - for them to basically monetize their
11:07 - expertise
11:09 - now this is sort of the basic idea and
11:12 - what we've done so far
11:13 - is we've reached out to a whole bunch of
11:16 - youtubers
11:17 - to try to get their feedback
11:20 - and see if they'd be interested in
11:22 - something like this
11:24 - so we have a monday board i want to show
11:27 - you
11:29 - here where we reached out to a variety
11:33 - of different youtubers and now you might
11:34 - recognize
11:35 - some of these names already and special
11:38 - shout out to hampton from hybrid
11:39 - hybrid calisthenics he's killing it on
11:41 - youtube and i've been
11:42 - following his journey he's a really
11:45 - friendly
11:46 - friendly guy
11:49 - these email addresses we found through
11:51 - the about tab and
11:53 - a lot of channels list their business
11:54 - email there so that you can
11:56 - submit business inquiries so we sent a
11:58 - whole bunch of emails out
12:00 - to a variety of youtubers in different
12:02 - niches and also different sizes
12:04 - because at this point we don't know
12:07 - which
12:08 - which nisha would respond the best who
12:10 - needs something like this
12:12 - and also what size of youtuber
12:15 - uh most identifies with this sort of
12:18 - solution
12:19 - and so that was maybe 24 hours ago we
12:21 - still haven't gotten any responses yet
12:24 - but seeing as how this is a time-bound
12:27 - case study
12:28 - i think we will we will proceed even
12:31 - though we're not getting the feedback
12:33 - yet
12:34 - however if you were building your own
12:37 - product and
12:38 - you didn't you weren't constrained by
12:39 - time then i i
12:41 - definitely would recommend that you get
12:43 - the uh
12:44 - confirmation that you need before you
12:46 - proceed with building anything
12:48 - now i do want to mention that it's not
12:50 - just me working on this
12:52 - because that would never have been able
12:54 - to fly
12:56 - um i i'm just so busy
12:59 - running code with chris as a business
13:00 - producing content for the courses
13:03 - producing content for youtube and
13:05 - everything else that it leaves very
13:07 - little time for me to work on projects
13:09 - like this
13:09 - and so we do have a co-op student
13:13 - an intern who is sort of
13:16 - leading the charge on this we're having
13:19 - discussions mostly every day
13:21 - and i'm sort of strategically
13:25 - driving the direction of it but
13:28 - in terms of the actual development and
13:30 - the work of it
13:31 - it's going to be mostly bowen and he's
13:34 - going he's doing a great job so far so
13:37 - props to him i want to talk a little bit
13:39 - about the
13:40 - emotional struggle that we've
13:42 - experienced even in the first few days
13:45 - because we sort of lost our way as we
13:47 - were brainstorming features
13:49 - uh as you can see here we were we
13:51 - started talking about
13:53 - content aggregation showing like social
13:55 - feeds and
13:57 - layering features on top of the normal
14:00 - youtube
14:00 - viewing experience like allowing users
14:02 - to like subscribe
14:04 - and interact with other fans
14:07 - gamification
14:08 - features leaderboards and and that sort
14:11 - of stuff
14:12 - and i started getting really discouraged
14:14 - because
14:15 - i had a really hard time seeing and
14:18 - visualizing
14:19 - why users would come back to this app
14:23 - and if this really would be helpful for
14:25 - the youtube content creators
14:28 - the initial idea i think it was
14:31 - trying to help youtubers grow their
14:33 - channel
14:34 - right and it just wasn't compelling
14:36 - enough
14:38 - but now i think we've arrived at a good
14:40 - place where
14:41 - it's not a solution
14:44 - for youtubers to grow their channel
14:47 - rather
14:48 - it's a solution that complements their
14:51 - business as an influencer at or as a
14:54 - content creator
14:56 - and one of the reasons why
14:59 - i went down this route is because
15:02 - in addition to what we've talked about
15:04 - so far i feel like
15:07 - it's a very flexible idea so youtubers
15:11 - might not end up being the right
15:13 - audience for something like this
15:15 - a lot of let's say businesses like
15:18 - restaurants or brick and mortar stores
15:20 - uh or e-commerce or shopify stores for
15:23 - example
15:24 - might want a mobile app where people can
15:27 - buy stuff or order stuff and so i think
15:29 - setting up this process
15:31 - where you know this infrastructure where
15:34 - someone can
15:36 - sign up for an account configure some
15:38 - stuff and then
15:39 - have it you know in the back in backend
15:43 - systems
15:43 - have it collect those assets and
15:46 - automatically generate
15:47 - an app bundle for them that can sort of
15:49 - be applied to
15:51 - different target audiences so if
15:52 - youtubers might not end up being
15:55 - the the right fit for this sort of
15:58 - solution then we can
15:59 - look to identify another market and
16:02 - furthermore
16:03 - um other side benefits are that
16:06 - like i really see this potentially being
16:09 - its own business
16:10 - right and i can also see clients who
16:15 - use this solution would want something
16:17 - custom they'll request
16:18 - something custom and unique for sure
16:21 - something that only applies to their
16:22 - scenario
16:23 - and so that also could potentially
16:26 - open up consulting opportunities for
16:28 - code with chris
16:30 - now this isn't something that we do
16:31 - right now just simply because the team
16:33 - we do we don't have enough uh people to
16:36 - support
16:37 - doing consulting projects and so but in
16:39 - the future like if we start getting a
16:41 - lot of requests from this like this
16:42 - spin-off business could generate
16:44 - um it could justify hiring people to
16:48 - to do to open up a code with chris
16:51 - consulting arm you know
16:52 - so that would be pretty cool um and the
16:55 - reason
16:56 - one other reason for a solution like
16:58 - this is because
16:59 - um i think selling to businesses might
17:02 - be
17:02 - a little easier when i think about
17:05 - myself
17:05 - as a content creator as an entrepreneur
17:09 - running a business i don't really
17:11 - hesitate to
17:12 - invest in a tool or a service if i think
17:15 - that it might
17:16 - help grow my business or increase my
17:18 - revenue
17:20 - because i'm thinking about it as an
17:22 - investment rather than a cost
17:24 - right and so i think working doing b2b
17:28 - might be a little easier than b2c right
17:32 - working with end consumers and that's
17:34 - just that's just what i'm thinking
17:36 - um so that sort of influenced
17:40 - going in this direction as well all
17:42 - right so that's what happened so far in
17:43 - days one to four
17:45 - to stay updated on the progress
17:48 - i think at the end of each week i'll be
17:50 - recording a summary like this if you
17:52 - want to follow more closely
17:54 - and get access to the project boards and
17:56 - see
17:57 - really the day-to-day action then that's
18:00 - inside
18:00 - uh cwc plus you can join the case study
18:03 - and you can
18:04 - sort of get the the day-by-day
18:06 - play-by-plays
18:08 - and get the exact like email template
18:10 - that we reached out with
18:12 - and that sort of thing but you know even
18:14 - for youtube i'm going to be
18:16 - doing these end of week updates giving
18:17 - you sort of like a high level
18:19 - overview of everything that's happened
18:20 - the progress we've made
18:22 - decisions we've made and stuff like that
18:24 - and also
18:27 - pay attention to the stories so i
18:29 - haven't done a lot of stories with code
18:31 - with chris just
18:32 - because um i haven't committed to it to
18:35 - be
18:35 - completely honest with you i'm nervous
18:38 - about them i don't know why
18:40 - but i think that stories would be a
18:42 - great fit
18:43 - for this sort of ongoing case study to
