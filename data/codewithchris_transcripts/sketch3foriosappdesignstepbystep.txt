00:06 - hey YouTubers welcome to this video
00:09 - where I'm going to show you how to use
00:11 - sketch 3 to design the UI for an app and
00:14 - this video was actually released in the
00:17 - course uh we're building a sort of like
00:20 - a quiz type app and so this lesson was a
00:23 - course lesson uh that showed how to
00:26 - design the UI using sketch and so I just
00:29 - adapt it for YouTube and I'm going to
00:31 - show you guys the first part of at least
00:34 - designing the first two screens and yeah
00:36 - hope you guys can get uh a feel for
00:41 - sketch hey guys so in this video we're
00:44 - going to talk about the redesign of the
00:47 - objectiv C trainer app this time done
00:50 - with Sketch sketch three to be exact and
00:54 - I think in general it's a a major
00:56 - improvement from the old design I feel
00:59 - like this one is in general more
01:02 - pleasing to the eye and more
01:04 - exciting and we can definitely play with
01:06 - the gradients in the background which
01:08 - changes the whole look and feel of the
01:09 - screen so let's go through some of the
01:11 - screens and how it's changed this is the
01:14 - question screen specifically for a
01:16 - multiple choice question and as you can
01:18 - see here are the three
01:20 - choices and when you select one the two
01:24 - uh the
01:25 - two wrong answers fade away and the
01:28 - right one kind of slides
01:31 - up here's what a fill-in the blank
01:33 - question would look like you just have a
01:35 - text box and uh a go
01:41 - button and here's what uh find the error
01:45 - question would look like and after you
01:48 - tap on the image uh the screen would dim
01:50 - and it would highlight where you were
01:52 - supposed to
01:56 - tap and here's what the menu would look
01:59 - like and this
02:00 - is probably where a lot of uh a lot of
02:03 - it differs from the old design because
02:05 - instead of having a separate stats
02:07 - screen I decided to incorporate it into
02:09 - the menu so there are three categories
02:11 - of questions easy medium and hard so I
02:14 - decided to incorporate this cell kind of
02:17 - like as a progress bar indicating how
02:20 - much you got right versus how much
02:22 - attempts you made at in that category so
02:25 - this kind of serves as a stats screen so
02:29 - we don't need a separate one the reset
02:32 - button is to reset the stats uh we still
02:35 - have the remove ads screen which you can
02:38 - see right beside it here it's just going
02:40 - to dim the whole screen and have these
02:42 - two buttons and then instead of an about
02:44 - screen which I also had in the old app I
02:48 - will have a button saying visit
02:50 - website which will bring the user to a
02:53 - web page on my site telling people about
02:56 - the
02:57 - app so I feel like in this way I've
03:00 - simplified the app a lot more uh and
03:04 - kind of removed a lot of sections so it
03:06 - doesn't feel as
03:08 - heavy so in this video I'm going to show
03:10 - you how I put together this design in
03:15 - sketch okay so to start sketch is kind
03:19 - of made for iOS design almost because if
03:23 - you create uh a new file from a template
03:26 - you have these options so I selected iOS
03:29 - UI Des
03:30 - design and it starts you off with uh
03:34 - this screen right here which you can
03:36 - kind of get rid of you don't need this
03:40 - stuff so what I did was I basically just
03:44 - deleted that I chose delete the
03:47 - layers uh deleted this I deleted all of
03:55 - this okay
03:58 - and
04:01 - I inserted an artboard from this side
04:04 - you can
04:05 - select a portrait and I called
04:11 - this the multiple choice screen it's my
04:14 - first screen I actually set the position
04:16 - to 0
04:18 - 0 you can hold down space bar and your
04:21 - mouse becomes a hand then you can pan
04:24 - around okay so the first thing I did was
04:26 - I I added a background to this guy
04:30 - and you can just select it select it
04:32 - right
04:34 - here I just gave it this light green
04:38 - background uh the second thing I hit R
04:41 - for a rectangle
04:43 - tool and I just drew drew a rectangle to
04:47 - about that and you might need to play
04:49 - with the sizing a little bit because if
04:51 - it doesn't snap into place you go into
04:54 - this part right here change to pos
04:56 - position 0 0 the width is 640
05:00 - and the height you can leave it as is
05:03 - but this is uh where I disabled the
05:07 - border for the fill I went to this
05:10 - gradient right here and I just selected
05:13 - this
05:15 - gradient and then I selected the
05:18 - rectangle again and you can change the
05:20 - opacity either from this control or you
05:22 - can just simply hit one on your keyboard
05:24 - for 10% or two for 20% and so on I think
05:28 - for this one I did about um like a 50 or
05:31 - 60% so let's do a 60%
05:34 - there and then I I added the question I
05:39 - hit t for
05:40 - text and I just added a new piece of
05:43 - text there I Center aligned
05:55 - it so there's my question and what's
05:59 - cool is that you can actually select the
06:01 - element you want hold down alt and you
06:03 - can see you can keep holding it while
06:06 - you move it and you can see how to kind
06:08 - of move it into the
06:11 - middle it's a little fidgety
06:14 - but can even do
06:20 - that oh I must accidentally created
06:23 - another one let me delete the first
06:27 - one all right so that's in the
06:32 - middle okay then I hit R to create
06:34 - another rectangle and this time I wanted
06:37 - to do the questions area so I created
06:40 - another one this time for the whole
06:45 - [Music]
06:47 - thing position I always seem to have to
06:50 - change the position so go zero that's
06:54 - fine but the width is 640 you want to
06:56 - cover the whole
06:58 - thing uh I always get rid of the Border
07:01 - I don't need that I changed the fill
07:04 - I'll change it to something like that
07:07 - and then I was playing a lot with the
07:09 - opacity
07:11 - actually so this one I've got at a like
07:15 - 40%
07:17 - opacity uh and then I created some
07:19 - blocks here kind of like for a status
07:28 - bar
07:44 - okay I changed this one got rid of the
07:47 - Border changed this one to a a dark
07:52 - gray and then I highlight this and if
07:55 - you press command D you can actually
07:57 - just duplicate it and make another copy
08:00 - so that's what I
08:06 - did selected a different color for this
08:11 - guy and then finally I duplicated it
08:15 - again stretched it out and this time
08:19 - chose an even lighter
08:21 - gray uh T put some text
08:25 - here uh I
08:28 - did a bold with
08:36 - size smaller size something like
08:58 - that
09:20 - okay and then at this point I did a
09:24 - rectangle as you can see it's all very
09:28 - boxy kind of eyeballed it
09:41 - here uh for the color I chose a I chose
09:45 - three different shades of green I think
09:47 - I chose a kind of slightly
09:52 - Olive Type green
09:58 - here
10:01 - uh but but then what I did was for this
10:04 - one I made the
10:06 - opacity something like that then I
10:09 - duplicated it so that I have another
10:12 - one and then I made this one
10:19 - thinner like so and this one was at
10:24 - 100% so I think this one was maybe 80
10:28 - wide
10:30 - maybe not that wide maybe
10:33 - 70 right and then I highlighted both of
10:37 - these I hit uh duplicate to move them
10:42 - down and I would select a different
10:44 - color for these
10:58 - guys
11:00 - so I think all I did was actually maybe
11:02 - use this dropper
11:03 - Tool uh and then
11:06 - go down a
11:08 - little that and then for this guy use
11:13 - the dropper
11:14 - tool select
11:22 - that
11:24 - so let's put some text on this
11:28 - guy
11:32 - so I chose light I made it pretty
11:37 - big that it might have been ultra
11:41 - light Maybe not maybe it was just
11:53 - light uh once again command D to
11:57 - duplicate it
12:01 - oops and the layering ordering is off so
12:03 - I'm just going to move this guy up
12:06 - there so the topmost layers are the one
12:09 - that's uh most
12:28 - visible I'm just going to play around
12:30 - with these colors a little
12:51 - bit I was playing around a lot with the
12:58 - opacity
13:07 - uh and
13:08 - then high like these
13:12 - duplicate by pressing command
13:28 - d
13:32 - okay and now I'm going to modify these
13:35 - colors
13:36 - [Music]
13:38 - again slightly
13:44 - lighter duplicate that move it down
13:51 - here now I've got
13:53 - three uh three
13:57 - question for selection now I'm a little
13:59 - bit off in this one because I have so
14:03 - much space left down here you know what
14:05 - I could do I could just select
14:08 - everything by holding down
14:14 - shift and then just slowly drag
14:18 - everything
14:22 - down like that and drag this one down a
14:26 - little
14:28 - bit now I can add some text
14:44 - [Applause]
14:48 - here duplicate
14:50 - that duplicate it
14:52 - [Music]
14:55 - again the duplicate function is actually
14:58 - uh the shortcut key is actually very
15:01 - handy okay and then finally I created a
15:06 - kind of bar down
15:09 - here okay so width is 640 position is
15:15 - zero I got rid of the Border I made this
15:19 - a dark gray but I made
15:21 - it uh like a 20% opacity maybe or maybe
15:27 - 10%
15:29 - and what I did was I hit duplicate
15:32 - command
15:33 - D and
15:36 - I did that add some text there for skip
15:41 - [Music]
15:44 - button I'm so used to pressing V for
15:47 - move from Photoshop but in sketch V
15:50 - turns out to be the vector pen
15:52 - tool okay so that's how I made the
15:54 - multiple choice screen and to do the
15:58 - next screen
15:59 - basically all you do there's this handy
16:02 - command where um you can select the
16:05 - whole the whole kind of
16:07 - artboard and you go to arrange go to
16:10 - make
16:11 - grid and I if I want to duplicate one on
16:15 - the right I would say I want two columns
16:19 - and I want the margin to be 10 pixels
16:23 - and then it would just duplicate this
16:25 - right here uh so then now I can just go
16:28 - ahead and rename it over
16:33 - here right and then what I can do is for
16:38 - the correct answer can delete all of
16:41 - this delete
16:45 - delete because what I want the result to
16:51 - be move this up
16:55 - there and Skip would become next
16:59 - so that's what the result would look
17:02 - like for a multiple choice question okay
17:05 - so that was designing the first two
17:08 - screens of our app using sketch 3 and if
17:11 - you want to watch the rest of the video
17:13 - or more videos like this I highly
17:15 - encourage you to consider joining the
17:17 - course and finding more about it uh you
17:20 - can either click the link in The
17:21 - annotation or in the description so I'll
17:24 - see you guys next time
17:27 - bye
