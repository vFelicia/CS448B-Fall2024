00:00 - Hey guys what's up today I'm super
excited to share this with you guys. Yes
00:04 - we're talking about Swift for Windows
but it's so much more than that even if
00:09 - you own a Mac. If you've ever struggled
with learning Swift programming then
00:13 - this is also for you so please watch
carefully. Last week I got an email from
00:17 - the University of Southern California
Viterbi School of Engineering and it
00:22 - said: Hi Chris
I work with Professor Buniatyan in the
00:25 - advanced iOS instructor at the USC
Viterbi School we came across your name
00:30 - while researching the top online blogs
and educators of the Swift programming
00:34 - language. Professor Buniatyan has built this
tool, which I've blurred out because I
00:38 - want to reveal it to you guys later in
this video, which he uses in his courses
00:43 - to show the working code of serverless
swift. It's similar to JSFiddle. We would
00:47 - love to get your feedback on it. Are you
available for a quick demo? Thanks in
00:52 - advance for your time, Hamlet. I checked
out the tool, I got really really excited
00:56 - and I immediately replied "yes". Now before
I take you on the tour of this awesome
01:00 - tool, let me ask you one thing:
Are you subscribed to my channel? If yes,
01:04 - then thank you so much but if not, then
please consider subscribing to support
01:09 - and encourage me to produce more videos
for you guys. Alright now let's dive in!
01:14 - So launch your browser and in the
address bar type in: play.swiftengine.io
01:19 - and then launch your favorite Youtube
series for learning Swift just like the
01:24 - playlist i've got here. Link it in the
description. Before you get started
01:28 - though, let me show you a couple of tips:
the first thing I want to draw your
01:32 - attention to is this Run button up here.
When you click on that, what's going to
01:36 - happen is it's gonna take the Swift code
you write in this code window, it's going to
01:41 - send it as a request to the Swift engine,
it's going to process that Swift code,
01:46 - generate the output and send it back to
your browser in this section right here
01:50 - on the right hand side as a response. Now
the next thing I want to draw your
01:55 - attention to is this "New" button. You can
click that at any time to start a new
01:59 - code window and basically just clears
everything that you've written here.
02:03 - Let's start by using a pre-loaded
example from this drop-down here.
02:08 - Now some of you who have seen Swift code
before might notice that it looks a
02:13 - little
strange because of these tags here. I'm
02:16 - referring to these angle brackets and
percentage symbols. Now what's happening
02:20 - here is it's just encapsulating the
actual Swift code to send as a request
02:26 - across the wire to the Swift engine. Now
luckily they've provided us with an
02:31 - option that we can write Swift code
without including those tags and this is
02:36 - going to be super crucial for beginners
to learning Swift because you don't want
02:42 - to have to worry about these extra tags
and where they go. So if you click that,
02:46 - that's not going to change what you've
written so far but whenever you start a
02:51 - new SEFiddle you can make sure that
that is checked and then you can just
02:56 - ignore any of that tag stuff and just
write your swift code. So for example
03:02 - let's write that and then we go ahead
and click Run and you're going to see
03:06 - the output on the right-hand side right
here. Now let's do another example: Let's
03:13 - declare a variable and actually let me
show you what an error would look like.
03:18 - So for example if I did something like
this and I try to run it, you're
03:23 - going to get an error message telling
you what's wrong with your Swift code so
03:27 - that's really helpful as well. It says
that we're missing a space there.
03:31 - Let's declare a loop that's going to go
ten times and I'm just going to add one
03:40 - to it in each of the loops and then I'm
going to print "a" and we're going to get
03:46 - the result right there. Now another thing
I want to draw your attention to is now
03:50 - we have this share button as soon as
you've written some code in the window.
03:54 - So what's cool with that is you're going
to get a link to share this code snippet
04:00 - that you've written here so anybody who
visits this link is going to be able to
04:05 - see the code that you wrote and they're
going to be able to run it and test it
04:09 - out as well. Cool right? The thing that
excites me the most is how accessible
04:15 - SEFiddle makes it to practice Swift,
especially for beginners or people who
04:18 - are using a Windows PC. This tool is
going to be a game-changer for how
04:22 - you're going to see content from me too.
For example if I show you a
04:26 - snippet of code in my video, I can pop it
into SEFiddle get a share link and put
04:31 - it in my video description. So if you
want to just copy my code and paste it
04:36 - into your Xcode window, you can do that and
if I issue an iOS challenge... which
04:40 - reminds me it's about time... you guys can
submit your code with a share link to an
04:45 - SEFiddle where I can run your solution
and see that it actually works. In the
04:51 - past, people have shown me screenshots of
their code as code submissions for the
04:55 - challenges but with SEFiddle, it's going
to be so much better. Finally for the
05:00 - lessons on my site, I can embed a code
window below the lesson for you guys to
05:04 - actually try and type out the code. Come
on, admit it. Half of you guys just watch
05:08 - the videos and call it a day right?... Right?...
Oh, it's just me? But seriously guys if
05:16 - you really want to learn this Swift
programming stuff, you really have to
05:19 - practice it and make mistakes. Now I'm
gonna give you four actionable steps to
05:24 - learn Swift on Windows or Mac. Step one:
visit my learn Swift playlist. Link it in
05:31 - the description. Click on lesson one and
watch it. Step two:
05:35 - launch SEFiddle in another browser
window. Step three: after I run some code
05:41 - in my Xcode project, do the same in your
SEFiddle window.
05:45 - Step four: and guys that's it! There's no
secret to it. You just have to do it. Go
05:51 - through all of the lessons in the
playlist like this and remember if
05:54 - you're having trouble remembering
certain Swift key words or syntax
05:57 - structures, that's perfectly natural. What
might help is grabbing the Swift cheat
06:02 - sheet link in the description below,
printing it out and having it beside you.
06:07 - Now one word of warning though, don't try
to memorize the Swift keywords because
06:12 - that's not really going to help. You
might remember it if you try to memorize
06:15 - it, but you will lose the context of when
to use it and why you're using it.
06:19 - Instead count on repetition to help
your fingers remember what to type, in
06:23 - context of what you're trying to
accomplish. And speaking of which, next
06:28 - week I'm going to reveal my special
technique for learning Swift fast
06:32 - without memorization and I call it the
CH method so if you're not subscribed to
06:37 - my channel make sure you are subscribed
so you don't miss this
06:40 - technique SEFiddle will be perfect for
implementing this technique. So I want
06:44 - you to know that SEFiddle is still in
active development so if you find any
06:48 - bugs or glitches or if you have any
feedback just let me know and I'll let
06:51 - my main man Hamlet know and he can
transfer that to the dev team so that
06:55 - they can work on it. Alright now I want
to turn it over to you and I want you to
06:59 - be very very honest with yourself: Have
you learned Swift before but you didn't
07:03 - actually practice it and type it out? Let
me know by typing "yes" or "no" in the
07:07 - comment section below. Finally if you
learned something new today, please
07:10 - subscribe to my channel! You wouldn't
want to miss the CH method would you?
07:14 - Alright I'll see you guys next time! Bye!
