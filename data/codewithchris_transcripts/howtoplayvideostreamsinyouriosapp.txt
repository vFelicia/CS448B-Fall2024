00:06 - hey guys welcome to another code with
00:09 - Chris video and in this one we're going
00:11 - to talk about how to easily play some
00:14 - video streams in your app now we're
00:17 - going to go through two ways one is to
00:19 - play a full screen video in another view
00:22 - controller and the next way is to play a
00:24 - kind of like an inline video in your
00:27 - view so let's get started we're going to
00:30 - create a new Xcode project a single view
00:33 - application and we're just going to call
00:35 - this one
00:37 - how about video stream demo I'm just
00:41 - going to save it on my desktop and the
00:47 - first thing you're going to want to do
00:49 - is stay on this project settings screen
00:53 - scroll all the way down to linked
00:55 - frameworks and libraries and click the
00:57 - plus icon and what you're doing here is
01:00 - you're adding additional frameworks to
01:03 - your project which will give you
01:05 - additional functionality depending on
01:07 - what you need
01:08 - by default it doesn't include everything
01:10 - or else you'll have you'll end up with a
01:12 - lot of functionality that you don't need
01:14 - so we're going to search for media and
01:17 - we're going to add the media player
01:18 - framework and just double click that and
01:21 - you're going to see it added to this
01:22 - list that you've got here ok now we're
01:26 - going to go to the storyboard and this
01:33 - is where you're going to customize your
01:34 - view over here on the lower right hand
01:37 - side make sure that you can see this
01:39 - pane if not you've got this button to
01:42 - bring it bring it into view and as well
01:46 - make sure you're looking at this list of
01:49 - elements if you're not make sure you're
01:52 - on this tab the object library and yours
01:54 - might look like this actually this is
01:56 - another view that you can you can do so
02:00 - search for button
02:02 - and this shows up so I'm going to drag
02:05 - that on to my screen and then in the
02:09 - properties the attributes inspector here
02:11 - I'm just going to change that to play
02:13 - and what we want to do is when we click
02:15 - this we're just going to want to launch
02:18 - the video player we're going to move
02:22 - that down here a little bit and now
02:24 - we're going to hook up an event
02:25 - basically the event when someone taps it
02:28 - we're going to hook up that event so we
02:29 - can add up add some code to it so go up
02:32 - here and click this assistant editor
02:34 - button you're going to see two panes now
02:37 - on your left hand side you want to keep
02:39 - the storyboard in view and on the right
02:41 - hand side you want to look at
02:43 - viewcontroller.m and what you're going
02:46 - to want to do is hold down ctrl on your
02:48 - keyboard and then click this button and
02:50 - drag over here in between the at end and
02:55 - the closing curly brace of the of any
02:59 - method so you can put it here or here in
03:03 - fact it actually will let you put it
03:05 - inside a method and I won't let you put
03:08 - it here so it's kind of foolproof proof
03:11 - you're going to want to let go of your
03:13 - mouse button and it's going to pop up a
03:15 - dialog in here we can add a name for the
03:17 - method I'm gonna call this play clicked
03:22 - so this is the method with the code
03:25 - inside that's going to execute when
03:26 - someone taps that button
03:36 - okay now I'm going to switch back to
03:39 - single view and I'm going to go to view
03:41 - controller dot M at the top here I'm
03:45 - going to want to import the media player
03:51 - okay and that's that's the one that
03:55 - we're going to use to play I'm going to
03:59 - open up a pair little pair of curly
04:01 - braces in between the @ interface in
04:03 - that and and this is keep in mind this
04:05 - is still in the dot M file okay I type
04:08 - in MP movie and then you'll see the list
04:12 - populate I want to pick MP movie player
04:15 - view controller and keep in mind there's
04:18 - an MP movie player controller right that
04:21 - this is the in line this is the one you
04:23 - want to use if you're going to play your
04:24 - video in line in your view this is the
04:27 - one you're going to want to use if you
04:28 - want to launch a new like full screen
04:31 - type of view and we're going to go
04:32 - through both so I'm going to start with
04:34 - MP movie player view controller okay so
04:37 - I'm in a player okay so I'm basically
04:44 - declaring a new instance variable to
04:46 - hold the reference to the movie player
04:49 - view controller object that I'm going to
04:52 - create okay and I'm actually going to
04:55 - change the name add an underscore there
04:57 - just to indicate that it's an instance
04:59 - variable and so this variable is going
05:02 - to be available throughout the class in
05:05 - in any method because it is an instance
05:08 - variable okay so down here back and play
05:13 - clicked I'm going to allocate initialize
05:18 - a new MP movie player view controller
05:22 - object and assign it to this variable
05:24 - here I'm actually before I do that
05:27 - because I I know that I'm going to want
05:30 - to pass in a URL
05:34 - during the create during the
05:35 - initialization I'm not going to do this
05:37 - yet first of all I'm going to create an
05:39 - nsurl call it video stream URL equals
05:45 - NSU
05:46 - or URL with string and here we're going
05:53 - to pass in a string that represents the
05:55 - video stream that we want to play so I
05:58 - was I don't have any streams this this
06:02 - video actually came up because I had a
06:04 - question from a member of my video
06:06 - course and he was asking me where to
06:10 - host his videos so he found a solution
06:12 - for Vimeo Vimeo has a pro plan which i
06:16 - think is $200 a year or maybe it's
06:18 - $20.00 a month if you pay monthly and
06:20 - what it allows you to do is upload your
06:22 - own videos but it gives you a streaming
06:25 - URL to those videos that you can you can
06:29 - put in here and you can play your videos
06:31 - through your iOS app so that's what he's
06:33 - going to do I didn't have that so I had
06:37 - to just Google for some streaming URLs
06:40 - that I wanted to test it with so I found
06:43 - this page and I'll probably put this
06:45 - link in the description and I'm just
06:48 - going to take one of these streaming
06:49 - URLs for testing purposes and put it in
06:54 - there okay so now I have my NS URL which
06:58 - I'm going to pass in to the
07:00 - initialization of my MP movie player
07:03 - view controller okay so underscore
07:05 - player equals MP movie player view
07:10 - controller a lot so I'm allocating it
07:14 - and in it with content URL and we'll
07:18 - pass in my video stream URL okay and
07:23 - believe it or not we are very close to
07:25 - being done all we have to do now is the
07:34 - view controller has a method
07:36 - so we're saying self presented and the
07:40 - method is called present movie player
07:42 - view controller animated and all you do
07:45 - is you pass in your movie player view
07:50 - controller object now save it I'm going
07:54 - to run it
07:59 - okay now when I click play this these
08:03 - these lines of code are going to get
08:06 - executed and as you can see it's loaded
08:11 - up the the movie view controller and
08:14 - it's loading this stream and so
08:18 - furthermore if I rotate it you can see
08:20 - that it rotates as well so that's really
08:23 - nice
08:29 - okay now you notice that when I click
08:32 - play it launches it presents a new view
08:35 - controller right so what if I wanted to
08:37 - play that video kind of in line just
08:39 - right there
08:41 - well I can use the other thing I should
08:44 - I kind of mentioned before before we use
08:49 - this example you see how there's MP
08:51 - movie player view controller that's the
08:52 - one we just use so if you use MP movie
08:56 - player controller instead that's the one
08:59 - we can use for inline playing so if we
09:02 - go back down here MP movie player
09:06 - controller a lock and it also has this
09:09 - in it with content URL there's a couple
09:12 - of additional properties we gotta set
09:15 - because the player is going to sit in
09:17 - the view you got specify its frame
09:19 - basically the X&Y origin and its height
09:23 - and width so
09:32 - so the movie player' has a view which we
09:38 - can set the frame on cg rekt make I'm
09:44 - going to put it at 0-0 and I'm going to
09:48 - set it to the width of this view
09:51 - controller and for height let's say
09:57 - let's say 320 that might actually skew
10:00 - the the movie itself but I'm not sure
10:03 - what aspect ratio the movies act okay so
10:07 - we don't use this present movie player
10:09 - view controller animated anymore instead
10:10 - what we do is we we add this view we add
10:16 - the players view into this view
10:19 - controllers for you so self dot view add
10:21 - sub view player dot view and I'm not
10:32 - sure if we have to actually call play on
10:34 - it let's see what happens I think we do
10:36 - actually so yeah when you click that
10:40 - play button you can see it's put its
10:43 - added the movie players view onto the
10:46 - view but now we have to play the play
10:51 - the stream okay so we call player it's a
10:58 - method play okay so let's give it a run
11:02 - and to run it you either press command R
11:07 - or you can hit this play icon in the
11:09 - upper left okay so when I hit play now
11:11 - it's going to run that code and the
11:14 - movie will actually start playing
11:16 - because the last line of code is to
11:18 - start the movie player and that's how
11:22 - you can play a video in line so you can
11:27 - see it's pretty easy to play video
11:29 - streams and you got a couple of options
11:30 - as well so I hope that gets you started
11:33 - in playing videos in your own apps and
11:37 - if you like this video please give it a
11:39 - thumbs up and share it with your friends
11:40 - and colleagues with the
11:42 - YouTube share buttons and if you're
11:44 - interested in my video course I'm
11:46 - running a contest right now just follow
11:49 - the URL in the description to go to my
11:52 - site and you're going to see a banner at
11:54 - the top okay I'll see you guys next time
11:56 - bye
