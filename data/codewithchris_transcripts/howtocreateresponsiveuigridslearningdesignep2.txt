00:00 - Today I'll share with you how to create
00:02 - responsive grids or achieve responsive
layouts using grids in Figma.
00:06 - But before we get started,
00:07 - if you're still trying to work your way
around Figma, we have a comprehensive
00:11 - Figma Basics tutorial that you
can watch to get started.
00:13 - It covers all the fundamentals
of designing with Figma,
00:16 - which makes it perfect for any
beginner in the world of UI design.
00:20 - The video is up there in the card,
00:21 - so make sure to watch it
if you want to learn more.
00:24 - Hey everyone, it's JC here Designer Tool
00:27 - with Chris the Place to Learn iOS app
Development I was a copywriter
00:31 - by profession, but I always had a passion
for design in general,
00:34 - and later on develop a strong
interest in UI and UX design.
00:38 - Now I'm becoming a better designer every
00:40 - day through practice and study,
and this series is about the journey.
00:44 - If you have an interest in design and want
to learn more about this field,
00:47 - I hope I can inspire you
to pursue it without further Ado.
00:50 - Let's start learning design.
00:53 - There are four main things
that we'll talk about in this video.
00:56 - First, the importance of having grids.
00:59 - Second, the most popular
grid systems you can use.
01:02 - Third, how to set up responsive grids that
you can use and reuse for your projects.
01:07 - And lastly, we'll take a look at a real
01:09 - world example of how having
a grid can help you.
01:13 - Chapters and time stamps
are available below.
01:15 - If that's your thing and with that out
of the way, let's get started.
01:19 - So first things first,
why responsive grids?
01:22 - So one of the very first things that I
learned when I started in this field is
01:26 - how important it is to have
a structure for our design.
01:30 - When I was starting out, I would just
align UI elements according to my taste.
01:34 - If I see that it's aligned,
then it's good to go.
01:37 - If it's not, I just rely on the alignment
options and stigma or just drag them
01:41 - until they snap on the same baseline,
same line, height and all those things.
01:45 - Sometimes I would also calculate
the spacing between elements and just
01:48 - remember them all throughout
the process of designing the UI.
01:52 - However, as I progressed and learned more
about designing UI, I realized that my old
01:57 - process was counterproductive and would
result in poor UI organization because it
02:02 - did not follow a grid structure
so much so that when the UI was applied
02:08 - in advice of a different size,
it would result in pure chaos and me
02:13 - having to adjust leeway
elements from scratch again.
02:15 - Now, all of these things can be
avoided with a responsive grid system.
02:20 - A grid system is a somewhat invisible
structural guide that will allow you
02:25 - to find some rhythm in your design,
since everything from text to buttons
02:30 - to images will be placed
consistently throughout the screen.
02:34 - Now, if you're wondering how to create a
grid layout grid structure a Grid system.
02:39 - First, you need to know what they are
02:40 - and some of the most
common systems out there.
02:43 - So grid systems, what exactly are they?
02:46 - Well, in UI design, there are two
most common systems that you can use.
02:50 - There's the eight point grid system
and the four point grid system.
02:54 - What these eight point and four point
02:56 - essentially mean is that your UI elements
will be divisible by those numbers.
03:01 - So if you follow the eight point grid
03:03 - system, your elements will be divisible
by eight, whereas if you follow the four
03:07 - point grid system,
they will be divisible by four.
03:11 - So in that case, for example,
your margins will be 20 or 16.
03:14 - If you follow the four point grid system
03:17 - because 28 or 16 are divisible by four
and your input field could be twelve
03:22 - pixels in height, your buttons
will be 24 pixels in height.
03:26 - The spacing between two input fields
will be eight pixels and so on.
03:31 - Basically all of them or most of them,
03:33 - for example, can be or
should be divisible by four.
03:36 - So personally, I prefer to use the four
03:39 - point grid system because it's more
granular, meaning you can be a little bit
03:43 - more intricate with your design,
especially in Sigma,
03:46 - which has a dense workspace that is geared
towards productivity and efficiency.
03:51 - And apart from that, companies like Google
and their Material Design system also use
03:56 - a four point grid layout in terms
of Apple's own design system.
04:01 - I'm not too sure which one they use,
but regardless whether you go for eight
04:05 - point or four point,
the principal and the goal is still
04:08 - the same, having consistent,
structured and responsive user interface.
04:13 - And once you get familiar
with the principle behind these grid
04:16 - systems, you'll be able to create a grid
system yourself for your app,
04:20 - and you'll no longer have to worry about
it looking funky when displayed
04:24 - on a bigger screen,
like an iphone 13 Pro Max or a smaller
04:28 - screen like the iphone 13
Pro Mini or iphone 13 Mini.
04:32 - So yeah, those are some of the fundamental
04:34 - things that you need
to know about grid systems.
04:36 - There's still a lot to learn about them,
04:38 - but I won't go over the more advanced
stuff to keep this video short.
04:42 - But if you want to learn more,
I'll put some links in the description
04:46 - for some articles that you can
read like this one by drade.
04:49 - Shepper on Miyama.
04:50 - I'm not so sure how to pronounce the name.
04:52 - He has an article link in the description.
04:55 - Give that a read if you want.
04:57 - So all said and done.
04:58 - We've touched on the rationale
behind the grid system.
05:02 - Now it's time to put that into application
05:04 - and set up a responsive
grid system in Figma.
05:07 - Right now we have a Figma file.
05:09 - So first things first on your Figma
05:11 - workspace, we want to create
a frame or press the frame tool.
05:15 - Select whichever screen size you want.
05:19 - I'll choose the iphone
Eleven Pro or iphone Ten.
05:22 - Let's rename this as demo.
05:24 - So at this point it really doesn't matter
whichever screen size that you choose
05:27 - because we're creating
a responsive grid after all.
05:30 - But I just have a strong preference
for this size right here because I think
05:35 - it's one of the most common
screen sizes around the world.
05:38 - I'm not so sure I don't
have the data for that.
05:40 - So yeah, I just want
to put that out there.
05:42 - So from here, let's lock this frame,
then go to Layout Grid.
05:46 - Make sure the frame is selected.
05:47 - Layout grid.
05:48 - And then on the right panel,
click on the plus icon
05:54 - and go to the settings of this tab
and make sure to select columns first.
06:01 - And now you'll see we have columns
displayed in red just by clicking columns.
06:05 - So you can change the color of this column
06:07 - by going here, change it
to whatever you want an example.
06:11 - But let's just keep it to red
at 10% because it's the default.
06:18 - So from here, what we want to do is
06:19 - to change all is that most of the values
that are displayed on the screen,
06:24 - so count is simply the number of columns
that will be displayed in our frame.
06:29 - So for our four point grid system,
we're going to have count set to four.
06:34 - So type can be thought of as
the position of the columns.
06:38 - So if you set that in the center,
the columns will be in the center,
06:42 - and if there's Resize,
it will stay in the center.
06:45 - So put that on the left will stay
06:49 - on the left, which are regardless of your
screen size and right and so on and so on.
06:54 - So in our cases,
06:55 - we want to create a responsive grid
for various sizes of mobile devices.
06:59 - We want to set it to stretch.
07:02 - Whenever we Resize the frame,
07:03 - the layout grid follows the size of our
Artboard, which is basically the behavior
07:08 - of a responsive grid or
a responsive design.
07:11 - So let's get stuck to default.
07:14 - It's margin margin is basically the margin
07:18 - or space between the actual
workspace or UI and the device.
07:21 - So think of this frame as the screen
dimensions of an iphone ten.
07:25 - So when you play on present,
07:28 - you'll see the iphone ten device
right here just like that.
07:32 - So this white space, the actual UI.
07:34 - This covers edge to edge.
07:36 - So when we're designing UI,
07:38 - we almost never want to create elements
outside the safe area because it could
07:42 - result in a poor user
experience and unpleasant look.
07:46 - So we always want to set our margins
07:48 - into something that's divisible
by four as well, such as 16 or 20.
07:53 - So next is the gutter.
07:54 - The gutter is basically
the spacing between columns.
07:57 - So having gutters are quite useful,
especially if you are planning to design
08:02 - a carousel or something
with a horizontal scroll feature.
08:06 - So we also want to set this to something
08:08 - that's divisible by four,
which is eight, and that's it.
08:13 - Okay.
So our column settings are done.
08:15 - Next, we're going to want to apply another
08:17 - layout grid so under a panel,
just click on the plus icon again,
08:20 - click on the settings and choose rows,
so this will be pretty quick.
08:25 - Just want to make sure
that count is set to 1000.
08:29 - The type is set to top height is set
08:34 - to four, divisible by four, offset
zero and gutter zero just like that.
08:40 - So the reason behind this setting is
that whenever we want to snap a UI element
08:46 - to our horizontal axis,
the baseline of that property will always
08:50 - be divisible by four because
of our height that's set to four.
08:54 - And because our count is set to 1000,
08:57 - this row basically goes on and on,
which can be useful.
09:00 - If you have a very long app page, though,
if you happen to find yourself exhausting
09:05 - all of the 1000 rows just like this, then
you may have to rethink your app design.
09:10 - Okay, so yeah, just keep it reasonably
09:13 - long because we don't want to design if
it scroll depending on your intention.
09:20 - So save that.
09:22 - And now you have your solid grid system.
09:24 - Now, from here,
we want to make sure that we will be able
09:26 - to reuse this grid system for all
the pages in our app project.
09:30 - So to do that, we'll have to create
a style out of this layout grid property.
09:34 - So click on Style right here.
09:36 - Click on the plus icon and click on.
09:40 - Let's rename this to maybe mobile,
just like that mobile.
09:45 - So if you watch our previous lesson
on styles and components on Sigma,
09:48 - then you already have
an idea on how to do this.
09:50 - If not, I highly suggest that you watch
that video because familiarizing styles
09:54 - and components can really work
wonders for your workflow.
09:59 - Okay, so let's check the styles again.
10:01 - As you can see,
the columns and rows we just made are
10:05 - already combined in one style,
this mobile style.
10:09 - So we just click on.
10:10 - For example, let's create another one
10:13 - another iphone X,
and click on the upgrade mobile.
10:17 - And basically the rows and columns have
10:19 - been applied, so that just gives
us easy access in the future.
10:24 - From here, there's one less thing that we
10:25 - need to do, and it's outside
this layout grid property.
10:28 - So on your Figma workspace, click on this
Sta icon, the Figma menu or main menu.
10:34 - Click on Preferences
and choose Nudge amount,
10:38 - and here we'll change the big
nods to four instead of ten.
10:43 - So in case you didn't know, nudge refers
to the movement of an element in pixels.
10:48 - So if you click on a button, for example,
let's create a button right here.
10:59 - Let's first hide the
upgrade so we couldn't.
11:05 - Have a better visualization.
11:06 - So here's a button.
11:07 - And if you click on the arrow key one
11:09 - time, that's a small nudge,
and it will move one Pixel to the right.
11:13 - As you can see, there's the X axis,
let's move that to the right.
11:18 - There is one nudge.
11:20 - So now our X value is 21.
11:22 - Press the right arrow key
again, 22, three, four.
11:25 - Basically, that's the small nudge.
11:27 - So if your small nudge is set to ten,
then every time you press any of your
11:32 - arrow keys, the element will move
ten pixels to that direction.
11:36 - So ideally a small nudge is always set
11:38 - to one, so you can make very little
adjustments in your UI just like that.
11:44 - So big nudge, on the other hand,
11:45 - is when you hold shift plus
any arrow key on the keyboard.
11:49 - So since our big nudge is set to four
whenever we hold shift and the right arrow
11:54 - key, for example, let's
set this to back to 30.
11:56 - So let's hold shift and press
the right arrow key.
11:59 - The element will move
four pixels to the right.
12:02 - So as you can see, we went from 30 to 34
by pressing Swift and the right arrow key.
12:07 - Press that again,
12:08 - remove another four pixels with a total of
eight pixels since the original position.
12:14 - So we're now 38 pixels
from the left or since we started.
12:19 - So regardless of how many times you press
shift and the arrow key,
12:23 - you can rest assured that the position
will always be divisible by four.
12:27 - So now you have a grid system
that you can use for a whole project.
12:31 - So just a quick demonstration with our
grid systems in place,
12:34 - let's put some basic UI elements and see
how this would work for our demonstration.
12:40 - Let's just remove this frame because
we don't need it anymore in here.
12:45 - I already have some premade
UI elements or organisms.
12:49 - If you watch our previous video that we
12:52 - just need to put on our frame
with the grid in place.
12:56 - So let's just remove this frame ungroup.
13:00 - So these are just organisms that I
could just drag and drop on the frame.
13:05 - So first things first,
let's create a frame iphone Eleven Pro.
13:09 - So on and using our style we made earlier,
13:13 - let's just click on this mobile and you
can always adjust the opacity of this.
13:19 - So just go to maybe five
and same goes for here five.
13:30 - And if you want to disable them or hide
them temporarily, you can just always as
13:36 - a shortcut, you can press
CTRL G on your keyboard.
13:39 - If you are in the Mac,
press CTRL G just like that little grid
13:44 - invisible, or you can just
press this icon right here.
13:49 - But if you want to work fast,
use the shortcut.
13:51 - So our UI premade UI elements,
let's just drag and drop this one
13:56 - so as you can see, it snaps on our grids
or lines that we just set a while ago.
14:04 - So regardless of the position
that we set this on.
14:08 - It will always be divisible
by four as you can see 36.
14:10 - And just like that.
Okay.
14:12 - Next is learn courses with CWC
plus all those things.
14:16 - Let's just drag it here.
14:18 - So let's just make sure to select both,
make sure that they are divisible by four,
14:23 - like maybe 16 or even twelve or eight,
and make sure that they're aligned
14:34 - just like that.
14:35 - So here, let's make sure that they
are divisible 432 and this is eight.
14:43 - Let's just disable that.
14:45 - Maybe that's okay.
14:48 - Just an example.
14:49 - So here, let's make sure
that this is divisible by four.
14:52 - Again.
14:53 - 34.
14:56 - Put that on.
14:57 - So as you can see it, snaps.
14:59 - So this is the button.
15:02 - The height of this button is 44,
which is divisible by four.
15:05 - And as you can see, it, snaps just right
to that rows that we made a while ago.
15:11 - So here's the top row, the bottom row.
15:14 - I mean the bottom line, top line
and snaps on from top to bottom.
15:19 - So that's the first half of our UI.
15:23 - And from here, let's just drag it here.
15:26 - Just get Chris assets right here.
15:28 - Just drag and drop them.
15:30 - Make sure that they are divisible before
15:32 - again, maybe 24, maybe 16,
maybe 812, something like that from here.
15:40 - Make sure.
Yeah, they are 24.
15:42 - But you want to make sure that they have
a little more space to make this 32.
15:46 - This one will be twelve, just like that.
15:50 - As you can see again,
15:53 - I want to make sure that it's 20 pixels.
15:56 - So let's make sure that it will snap.
15:57 - So that's the beauty of this mail grid,
16:00 - because it will snap on that
column, the edge of that column
16:09 - just like that.
16:10 - So as you can see right here,
it doesn't exactly snap on this top row,
16:15 - because the baseline of our font also
goes beyond that top row line this line.
16:21 - So it will follow if you set
them individually in this 1212.
16:26 - What's going to happen is that it will
16:28 - really not snap to that rows
that we just made earlier.
16:31 - So make sure that it will snap
just like that, just like that.
16:37 - So you can always just set this.
16:39 - You can always just adjust the line
height of this font and make sure.
16:45 - And now they are twelve.
16:48 - And from here, as you can see when you
16:50 - click on that, it snaps,
you click on this, it taps,
16:52 - and when you click on them both,
you can see they're divisible by twelve.
16:56 - So let's double check on our
first carousel list.
17:00 - So this is a carousel, by the way.
17:02 - So if you want to see the list all the way
17:05 - to the right, so you just
need to Uncheck clip content
17:11 - here.
Let's just move it right there
17:14 - and that's it.
17:16 - Let's remove this again.
17:19 - Yeah.
17:21 - Let's just drag it here.
17:23 - Make sure that this is
left and right and top
17:29 - drag it like that.
17:31 - Then same goes for the next item.
17:34 - So we can just fast forward this.
17:39 - Now one thing left for us
to do is to Resize this.
17:48 - Make sure that the space is around 64,
17:51 - maybe or 80 because we want
it visible before again.
17:55 - So 80 is somewhere here.
18:00 - There you go,
18:04 - 64 other
18:12 - and let's just adjust the bottom again.
There you have it.
18:17 - It snaps perfectly and it snaps perfectly.
18:22 - Remove this guide.
18:23 - It's just a rectangle that I
often use serve as a guide.
18:28 - And when we remove the layout grids
18:32 - and press on present,
it will show us this UI.
18:38 - You can see if you click on the frame.
18:41 - Press present.
18:43 - It shows us the UI, and it looks good.
18:47 - It has the rhythm.
18:48 - It has that structure because we
followed the four point grid.
18:52 - So as you can see,
18:53 - each item on the carousel span three
columns and the second teaser.
19:00 - I mean, the second item is
19:03 - on the fourth column and it sort
of bleeds over the edge of that device.
19:09 - So this is one of the few instances where
19:11 - you can design outside of the margins or
the safe area of the UI because
19:19 - we intended or we want people to scroll
or we want people to interpret that.
19:25 - This is a scrollable list, just like that
19:29 - when you scroll also
functions just like that.
19:38 - So that's the beauty
of the four point grid.
19:41 - We have the structure.
19:42 - We don't have the status barrage here,
but that's okay because this is just
19:46 - to give you a demonstration
on how UI grids work.
19:50 - So we have the four column grid, the 1000
rows, and all those sort of things.
19:55 - As you can see, we have
a bit of mistake right here.
20:07 - For some reason, I think
20:13 - the second has a bit more
space than usual right
20:21 - now.
I see.
20:23 - Okay, so here we go.
20:26 - Just like that.
20:27 - So the second one is correct.
20:29 - It's the third one that isn't
first and third one, third rows.
20:38 - That's better.
20:40 - All right, let's make
some more adjustments.
20:54 - Just like that.
20:55 - We just made some editing
20:58 - and present again.
21:00 - Now you can see it's much more
structured, much more consistent.
21:05 - So, yeah, that's the beauty of the four
point grid system again,
21:08 - or any other grid system,
because you can easily spot some mistakes,
21:12 - some inconsistency on your design,
and you can remedy it immediately.
21:18 - So that's just one very spontaneous
instance that I gave you.
21:23 - So because we follow the grid system,
any inconsistency will be spotted
21:28 - immediately, and we can
easily resolve that.
21:31 - And now we have a responsive grid
system and a more structured UI.
21:36 - All right.
So that's all the basics of creating
21:38 - responsive UI grades
and Figma before we end.
21:41 - I just want to inform you guys that our
21:42 - chat mini course is now live
in our CWC plus program.
21:45 - So in there you'll have access to lessons
on how to design and develop a simple chat
21:51 - app, plus all other courses in our CWC
plus catalog links in the description.
21:57 - If you're interested so with that out
21:59 - of the way, I hope you learned something
like and subscribe if you did leave
22:03 - a comment, if you have any questions or
suggestions and again,
22:06 - thank you for learning design with me
and I'll see you in the next video.
22:10 - Bye.
