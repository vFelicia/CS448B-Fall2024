00:08 - hey guys welcome to another episode of
00:10 - code with Kris what I realized with our
00:13 - old series how to build an iPhone app is
00:15 - that when we got to Episode five I
00:18 - started jumping into code and Xcode and
00:20 - you guys might not have necessarily been
00:23 - comfortable with that so I'm going to
00:25 - start a new series about Xcode and how
00:29 - to navigate around it how to use it and
00:31 - you know all you could ever want to know
00:33 - about it for this particular episode
00:35 - we're going to talk about very simply
00:37 - where can you get Xcode and then we'll
00:39 - move on from there
00:40 - all right the easiest way to download
00:43 - Xcode is actually through the Mac App
00:45 - Store on your Mac so if you go to the
00:48 - App Store right here and you type in
00:50 - Xcode you'll be able to find it and then
00:53 - simply download it so let me show you
00:56 - how that works
01:03 - so I've already got it installed
01:04 - otherwise this would be an install
01:07 - button and when you click it it will
01:09 - just start downloading and it will
01:11 - install it and afterwards it will
01:14 - probably be right here so another way to
01:24 - download Xcode if you don't have the Mac
01:25 - App Store is through Google so just
01:28 - bring up your browser and search for it
01:32 - and on the developer side of apple
01:37 - developer apple comm slash xcode you'll
01:42 - be able to download it here for free
01:47 - click here view downloads this button
01:50 - would otherwise bring you to the App
01:51 - Store so click view downloads you'll
01:54 - have to sign in with a developer account
01:57 - if you have one if you don't you can
01:59 - register one for free so I'm just going
02:01 - to sign in to show you guys but alright
02:03 - so here it is Xcode 4.6.1
02:07 - and you can download the image file
02:10 - alright so either either way install it
02:13 - from the Mac App Store or through this
02:15 - and when you open it you won't get this
02:18 - because this is a project that's open
02:22 - already I'm going to give you the source
02:23 - code in the link in the description and
02:26 - in the next episode we're going to go
02:29 - through the different parts of the
02:31 - interface of Xcode if you don't want to
02:34 - download that source code you can just
02:36 - create a new project and it can be a
02:39 - single view application and then we'll
02:41 - move on from there
02:44 - hey guys so that was the first video
02:46 - quick and easy from now on I'm going to
02:49 - start doing something at the end of my
02:51 - videos and that's sharing a fun fact
02:53 - with you guys either about Apple iOS or
02:56 - programming in general so I've got the
02:58 - first one here let me read it out to you
03:00 - guys did you know that in 2011 Apple
03:05 - sold more iOS devices 156 million of
03:09 - them then all the Mac's that had sold in
03:11 - 28 years 122 million
03:15 - so in one year that's a lot of devices I
03:19 - think I have f3 myself so do you guys
03:26 - have an iOS device and if so how many
03:29 - and if you don't why not let me know in
03:33 - the comment section below and I'll share
03:35 - the results with you guys in a future
