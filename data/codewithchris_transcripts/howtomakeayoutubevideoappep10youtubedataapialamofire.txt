00:01 - hey coders what's up I hope you guys are
00:04 - having a great day Chris here and as
00:06 - promised we are going to start with the
00:09 - dynamic version of the YouTube app or
00:11 - the so called advanced version we're
00:14 - going to build off of the simple
00:16 - hard-coded data version so for those of
00:19 - you guys who are just joining us
00:20 - in late November we started building a
00:23 - YouTube app but it was the so called
00:25 - simple version where we had hard-coded
00:27 - the video data or the video IDs that we
00:30 - wanted to display inside of the Xcode
00:32 - project and so it wouldn't update
00:34 - dynamically but it was a lot easier and
00:37 - a lot simpler for beginners to follow a
00:39 - bunch of you guys expressed interest in
00:41 - learning how to do the dynamic version
00:43 - which is to have the app go through the
00:46 - YouTube data API download feeds parse
00:48 - the feeds to display the latest content
00:51 - from the channel now if you haven't gone
00:53 - through the simple version yet or you're
00:55 - a beginner just starting out with Swift
00:57 - and building apps I would recommend you
00:59 - do the simple version first and
01:01 - furthermore we're gonna build off of
01:03 - that simple version so so think of this
01:06 - as a continuation of that simple version
01:09 - YouTube app series if you haven't
01:11 - watched it I'm going to link to it on
01:13 - the screen so click that it's gonna open
01:15 - up the video series in a new window for
01:18 - you so please check that out first
01:19 - alright with that out of the way let's
01:22 - take a look at how we're going to
01:23 - accomplish this what I have here is the
01:25 - getting started guide for the YouTube
01:27 - data API there is going to be a couple
01:29 - of things you need to do first before
01:31 - you're going to be able to work with the
01:33 - API and to retrieve data hopefully
01:35 - you're able to go through the Moulton
01:37 - shopping app videos last week so we also
01:39 - worked with an API in that video series
01:42 - anyways with the YouTube data API you're
01:46 - going to need a Google account in order
01:48 - to access the Google developers console
01:50 - and we're gonna have to create an API
01:52 - key and then we're going to need to
01:54 - create an application or register our
01:56 - app with it that's going to give us this
01:59 - API key which we're going to include in
02:01 - every single one of our requests to
02:03 - retrieve data so for example if we go
02:06 - over to the reference section and we
02:09 - take a look at playlist items and we
02:12 - a list of playlist items we can make a
02:14 - request like this and then we can
02:17 - specify different parameters we're gonna
02:19 - have to pass in the API key and it's
02:21 - gonna return to us a response in JSON
02:24 - which we're going to parse and retrieve
02:26 - those playlist items so for example the
02:29 - most recent uploads is actually a
02:31 - playlist so we're going to be working a
02:33 - lot with playlists okay so how are we
02:35 - going to make these requests and parse
02:38 - the responses well we're going to use a
02:40 - library called Alamo fire it's a really
02:42 - popular library used in a lot of popular
02:44 - apps that allows you to very easily
02:47 - handle networking in your app so
02:49 - scrolling down a little bit more we can
02:51 - see that there's a way to install it
02:53 - through cocoa pods which which we
02:55 - learned in a previous video if you
02:57 - didn't see that video click on the
02:59 - thumbnail in the upper right hand corner
03:00 - and you can jump to that video and watch
03:02 - that section to install cocoa pods and
03:04 - learn how we can include libraries for
03:07 - use in our Xcode project okay so with
03:09 - that said let's first of all install
03:11 - Alamo fire in our YouTube app project so
03:15 - I'm going to open up terminal and I am
03:18 - going to go to my YouTube app folder so
03:22 - I've got it on my desktop I'm gonna go
03:24 - with CD desktop and it's under YouTube
03:29 - it's under YouTube app and here I'm
03:38 - gonna type in pod in it now if I open up
03:42 - the folder in my Finder window I'm gonna
03:45 - see that I have a pod file and all I'm
03:47 - going to do is open it up in my text
03:50 - editor and let's follow these
03:52 - instructions here to install it okay so
03:56 - let's uncomment the platform uncomment
03:59 - use frameworks and inside here let's put
04:02 - pod ELMO fire comma tilled 3.0 okay save
04:11 - it that should do it I don't know if
04:13 - we'd need this line up here I'm going to
04:15 - close the file go back to terminal and
04:18 - in here I'm going to say pod install
04:23 - so wait a while while it retrieves Alma
04:27 - fire and installs it okay so it's
04:30 - complete and from this point on we open
04:34 - up the XC workspace file when we want to
04:37 - launch our project we're not going to do
04:39 - that just yet we're actually going to
04:41 - jump back over to the guides getting
04:44 - started because we're going to jump into
04:47 - the Google developers console to
04:49 - retrieve that API key right here so I'm
04:53 - going to click this link and I'm going
04:54 - to switch accounts to my code with Chris
04:56 - email by the way don't use that email
04:58 - right there it's my personal email and I
05:00 - won't answer any questions on it so if
05:04 - you want to reach me you can use the
05:05 - contact form at the bottom of code with
05:07 - Chris calm alright so let's see what we
05:09 - got here
05:10 - Google API is to click that and right
05:14 - away we can create a new project so I'm
05:16 - gonna call this the YouTube app demo
05:20 - alright it gives me a project ID right
05:22 - here let's see what the Advanced Options
05:25 - aren't all right we don't need to worry
05:27 - about that it would not like to be
05:30 - emailed and okay click yes create that
05:33 - okay so down here you can see that it's
05:35 - creating it and here our page has been
05:40 - refreshed so what we gotta look at is
05:43 - the YouTube data API right here and I
05:47 - want to enable this API and by doing
05:52 - that it tells me that the API is enabled
05:54 - but I can't use it in my project until I
05:57 - create credentials so click the go to
06:00 - credentials right now to create them
06:02 - alright so what type of API are using
06:04 - I'm using the data API version 3 and
06:08 - where will we be calling it from I'm
06:11 - going to choose iOS what credentials do
06:13 - I need let's click that and it seems
06:16 - like the only action I can do here has
06:18 - cancelled so let's go back see what
06:21 - happens ok so here you need credentials
06:24 - to access the api's let's click a new
06:28 - credential so I'm going to choose API
06:30 - key I'm going to choose iOS key and here
06:35 - I'm going to just say
06:36 - let's see Google verifies that each
06:38 - request comes from an iOS app that
06:40 - matches one of the bundle identifier is
06:42 - listed below although this is optional
06:44 - so we don't actually have to specify a
06:46 - bundle identifier but if you want you
06:50 - can make it so that only requests from
06:52 - your apps bundle identifier is accepted
06:56 - and where is the bundle identifier well
06:59 - let me show you really quickly in your
07:02 - Xcode project if you click on the root
07:07 - node and go to your project properties
07:08 - this is the bundle identifier so if you
07:10 - wanted you can copy this and you can
07:13 - paste it here and only requests from
07:16 - that app will be used will will be
07:19 - accepted essentially so here I'm going
07:22 - to call this the my YouTube demo key
07:27 - create okay and now we've finally got an
07:32 - API key after all those steps you only
07:34 - need to do this once though so why do we
07:36 - need an API key to access the YouTube
07:39 - data API well one thing is so that
07:42 - YouTube or Google can identify who's
07:45 - calling their API and they can contact
07:47 - you if something is wrong or something
07:49 - comes up with that another thing is that
07:52 - they actually have a quota so you can't
07:54 - overuse the API but for our purposes I
07:57 - don't think we would ever go past that
07:59 - quota anyways okay so we're going to
08:01 - need to keep this API key handy and if
08:04 - you guys don't want to go through the
08:05 - trouble of creating a Google account and
08:07 - signing up for this API key I'm just
08:10 - gonna make this public so I'll include
08:12 - it in the link below the video and you
08:13 - can use my API key I hope that's not
08:16 - against the rules but hopefully you guys
08:18 - don't tell anybody either but at least
08:20 - that's gonna get you guys up and running
08:22 - quickly
08:23 - and so that you can hit the API and
08:25 - retrieve some videos so that's it for
08:27 - this video I want to thank you for
08:29 - watching I want to thank you for
08:30 - subscribing and sharing and generally
08:32 - supporting code with christen the code
08:34 - with Chris YouTube channel so thank you
08:36 - so much and I'll see you guys in
08:37 - tomorrow's video bye for now
08:40 - you
