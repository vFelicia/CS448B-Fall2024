00:00 - hey guys what's up it's Chris here I
00:02 - just wanted to tell you what's coming
00:03 - down the pipe this month on this channel
00:05 - and why you should tune in so I've
00:07 - gotten comments from you guys like this
00:09 - one that you guys want to progress in
00:12 - difficulty and that's something that I
00:13 - want to deliver on right after we lay
00:16 - down some groundwork now there are some
00:18 - foundational knowledge videos that I
00:21 - need to create so that when we build the
00:23 - more complex apps together I can refer
00:25 - people back to those videos things such
00:28 - as how to install cocoa pods what is
00:30 - JSON how do you parse JSON what our API
00:33 - is that sort of stuff and I've already
00:35 - created some of these videos already so
00:37 - you know we're a good way into that but
00:39 - in addition to those videos I want to
00:42 - also cover some design related stuff so
00:45 - how to work with figma and Adobe XD
00:48 - because I really want to show in these
00:50 - upcoming app series how to build an app
00:52 - from end to end and that includes kind
00:55 - of design and prototyping and all the
00:57 - way to you know testing and triaging
00:59 - bugs and fixing and releasing and that
01:01 - sort of stuff and plus in my previous
01:04 - video about designing an app in figma i
01:06 - asked you guys if you wanted to see a
01:08 - basics tutorial with figma and a lot of
01:10 - you guys said yes so I want to make good
01:13 - on that promise as well so what's
01:15 - motivating me to create more app series
01:18 - and lay on the complexity is because
01:21 - right now on the channel there is kind
01:23 - of a pretty big problem I think right
01:26 - now a lot of people follow my work hard
01:28 - game tutorial series and that's great
01:30 - but it's not immediately obvious what
01:32 - comes next after that if you visit my
01:35 - youtube channel page you will see that
01:37 - right under the war card game there's
01:39 - like a part two and then there's a part
01:40 - three and some people actually see that
01:42 - and they follow all three parts now my
01:44 - original intention after that was that
01:47 - if the person was able to learn
01:49 - something and they liked the way I teach
01:50 - that they would go check out my paid
01:53 - courses and training on my website now I
01:56 - did that before because my sole source
01:58 - of income was from those courses and I
02:00 - needed to make this work as a full-time
02:02 - job but now at this point the courses
02:05 - are no longer my only income I mean
02:08 - there's ad revenue from YouTube and you
02:10 - might have noticed I've also started
02:12 - doing some sponsorships
02:13 - in my videos so thank you guys for your
02:16 - support that's been able to generate
02:19 - source of income as well so now I don't
02:21 - have to rely on just the courses and I
02:23 - don't have to push those courses as hard
02:25 - so my plan is to create more app series
02:28 - showing how to build apps from end to
02:31 - end and piling on the complexity so that
02:33 - when someone watches the wor card game
02:37 - after that they can go on to the next
02:39 - app and go on to the next app where will
02:41 - increase the complexity with each app
02:43 - and will teach new things and there will
02:46 - be a learning progression here on
02:48 - YouTube so I think that's really really
02:49 - cool
02:50 - so that's pretty much what's coming down
02:52 - the pipe this month and probably into
02:54 - the next month as well but I do want to
02:56 - do one of these update videos at the
02:58 - beginning of every month because I think
03:00 - it's a great way for us to chat
03:02 - informally so anyways I hope you stick
03:05 - around because I'm so excited to be
03:07 - releasing new app series here on YouTube
03:10 - and to make sure you don't miss any of
03:12 - it subscribe to the channel if you
03:14 - haven't already and if you have thank
03:16 - you so much I really appreciate it I'll
03:18 - see you guys next time
