00:02 - hey coders how's it going Chris here and
00:05 - today we're going to talk about this
00:07 - library called
00:08 - SV progress HUD now if you've ever had
00:10 - to display some sort of loading or
00:12 - waiting indicator you've probably used
00:14 - the UI activity indicator view that's
00:16 - built into the SDK while that's fine SV
00:19 - progress HUD offers several customizable
00:22 - options for how the indicator looks and
00:25 - it's also very easy to use so there's a
00:28 - demo here that I click through and here
00:31 - I can show you the different options
00:32 - that you can choose so here's the basic
00:35 - one you can show it with a status
00:37 - message you can show it with a progress
00:40 - you can show status like that
00:42 - you can show success with a status error
00:45 - with a status and you can also choose
00:48 - light or dark styles so that's the dark
00:50 - style and then you can also choose the
00:53 - native style so this looks like the UI
00:55 - activity indicator view also you can
00:58 - choose some sort of backgrounds so let's
01:00 - say I want black and I want this flat
01:03 - version you can show it with a dimmed
01:05 - screen like that unfortunately with the
01:07 - dimmed screen I can't click this dismiss
01:09 - button anymore so I'm going to have to
01:11 - reload it but you kind of get that idea
01:13 - there's a whole ton of options here and
01:15 - here's the gradient one so you can see
01:17 - that it goes from white to black in the
01:20 - corners but again I can't click the
01:22 - dismiss or any of these buttons anymore
01:23 - because of that dimmed view so anyways I
01:26 - hope you get the idea
01:27 - SV progress HUD is simple to use and
01:30 - offers a bunch of customizable options
01:32 - in fact if we look down in order to
01:35 - display it you just call show and - and
01:38 - to hide it you just call dismiss right
01:41 - here so first of all we're going to
01:42 - create our Xcode project demo here I'm
01:45 - going to open up Xcode and I'm going to
01:48 - create a brand new single view
01:50 - application project so there's single
01:53 - view application I'm just going to call
01:55 - this the SV progress
01:59 - HUD demo it's just that a space there
02:04 - make sure the language is Swift device
02:06 - iPhone the stuff after that doesn't
02:09 - really matter at this point and I'm
02:12 - going to save this on my desktop okay so
02:16 - now we're going to close the project
02:18 - because we're going to use cocoapods to
02:21 - install this library if we go up here
02:24 - this is what we're going to need to add
02:26 - to our pod file now if you don't know
02:28 - what I'm talking about and you don't
02:29 - know what cocoa pods is take a look at
02:31 - this video up here on the screen click
02:33 - it it'll open in a new window and that
02:36 - will show you how to set up and install
02:38 - cocoa pods so that you can work with all
02:40 - of these third-party libraries okay so
02:42 - moving on with our cocoa pods
02:44 - installation I'm going to press command
02:46 - spacebar to open up terminal and I'm
02:48 - going to navigate to my project folder
02:50 - so typing PWD shows me my current path
02:54 - CD desktop gets me into the desktop
02:57 - folder LS lists what I have on my
03:02 - desktop and there is the folder that I
03:04 - need so I'm just going to type CD SV
03:07 - progress I'm going to hit tab and it's
03:11 - going to complete that folder name for
03:14 - me and notice that because there's a
03:16 - space in my folder name this slash is
03:18 - used to escape that space okay so now
03:21 - I'm in my project folder all I have to
03:24 - do is write pod in it and inside my
03:29 - project folder it's going to create a
03:32 - pod file now I'm going to open that in
03:36 - my text editor sublime text you can use
03:39 - any text editor you want and then let's
03:43 - look at the installation instructions
03:46 - here now it doesn't tell us what we need
03:48 - to uncomment here but from installing
03:50 - the other libraries we know that we need
03:52 - to uncomment this platform line and this
03:55 - used frameworks because we're installing
03:57 - this for a swift project and then in
04:00 - between the target and the end tags
04:02 - right here we're going to go ahead and
04:05 - copy this line here
04:09 - so let's just paste it in there save the
04:12 - file and go back to terminal and then
04:15 - we're going to type pod install and it's
04:18 - going to read that pod file and it's
04:20 - going to install the SV progress HUD
04:22 - library all right there goes and now
04:26 - it's done so we can go back to our
04:29 - project folder now we notice there's an
04:31 - XC workspace so double click that that's
04:33 - the file that you're going to be opening
04:35 - from this point on for your project and
04:38 - immediately we're just going to press on
04:41 - our keyboard command B to build the
04:43 - project and that's going to compile the
04:46 - SV progress HUD library so now in the
04:49 - view controller we can begin to use it
04:51 - we can go import SV progress HUD like
04:55 - that if we go back to the page the usage
04:58 - page you scroll down a little bit let's
05:00 - take a look at some of the methods
05:01 - really quickly
05:02 - so you can call show and these are all
05:04 - class methods notice that so we wouldn't
05:07 - need to create an SV progress HUD object
05:10 - we just need to call SV progress HUD dot
05:13 - so because it's a class method you can
05:16 - also show with status and pass in a
05:18 - string we've seen that right here in
05:20 - this show with status right is the doing
05:24 - stuff and there's also progress in
05:26 - progress status so I guess here you can
05:29 - pass in a percentage of the progress
05:32 - that your task is done and you can
05:34 - dismiss the HUD with this dismiss or you
05:37 - can dismiss it with a certain delay
05:39 - after a number of seconds let's see
05:41 - there's a whole bunch of other stuff
05:43 - I'll leave it to you to explore but what
05:45 - we're going to try to do in our project
05:47 - is just do this basic show and hide so
05:50 - here it's really as simple as SV
05:54 - progress HUD dot so like that and if we
05:58 - want it to show with a message we would
06:00 - say show well see here the show air with
06:03 - status there's a bunch of other ones
06:06 - show progress show success show with
06:10 - status we can even pass in here and just
06:12 - say it's it's working
06:17 - and we can run that okay so I'm not
06:24 - seeing anything on the view here and we
06:27 - should be expecting to see the progress
06:28 - indicator now sometimes when you're
06:30 - putting things into viewdidload and not
06:33 - showing up as you expected it might be
06:35 - because even though the view has loaded
06:37 - it hasn't appeared yet and this progress
06:40 - HUD dot show method is putting something
06:43 - into the view so if the view is not
06:45 - visible yet like it has loaded but it
06:47 - hasn't appeared on the view yet it might
06:49 - not be able to show the progress
06:50 - indicator so sometimes what I try is I
06:54 - override another method called view did
06:57 - appear and when this method gets called
06:59 - it means the view has actually been
07:01 - shown and presented to the user so
07:03 - viewdidload happens first the view has
07:06 - loaded and then it gets presented and
07:09 - shown to the user and then view did
07:11 - appear happens so I'm just going to copy
07:13 - this line and move it into the view did
07:15 - appear method instead and we're going to
07:18 - run it again alright and that seems to
07:24 - have been the trick so there's the
07:26 - progress indicator with our status
07:27 - message I'm not going to go through all
07:29 - of the other options that it has because
07:32 - there's a whole bunch of things you can
07:34 - customize as we've seen in this demo
07:36 - right here so you customize you know
07:38 - progress status error success you can
07:41 - customize the you know the background
07:43 - gradient and stuff like that so there's
07:45 - usage instructions below here all I
07:49 - wanted to do was introduce you to this
07:51 - library one thing I will point out
07:52 - however is this notation right here so
07:55 - what it recommends you to do is show it
07:57 - and then use dispatch async to create a
08:00 - new thread to do your time consuming
08:03 - task basically the thing that the user
08:05 - is waiting to complete right do that in
08:08 - another thread this line right here is
08:10 - going to create a new background thread
08:11 - to do the task because you don't want to
08:14 - do that task on the main thread or also
08:16 - freeze the UI so it's dispatching a new
08:19 - thread you're going to do your time
08:21 - consuming task inside that and then when
08:23 - that's done you're not just going to
08:25 - dismiss the HUD from this background
08:27 - thread because you never want to modify
08:29 - the
08:29 - you i from a background thread so you
08:32 - use this again just dispatch it back on
08:35 - the main thread to dismiss the HUD so I
08:37 - hope you enjoyed the video if you liked
08:39 - it please give it a thumbs up please
08:41 - subscribe to the channel and please
08:43 - share it with your coworker some friends
08:44 - it really helped me out so thank you so
08:46 - much again
08:47 - and I'll see you guys tomorrow bye for
08:49 - now
