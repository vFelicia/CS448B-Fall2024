00:05 - hey guys welcome to lesson 16 of how to
00:08 - make an iPhone app with no programming
00:10 - experience and in this lesson we are
00:13 - going to look at if statements first
00:15 - we're going to start a playground to try
00:17 - out the code before we go into the Xcode
00:20 - project I'm just gonna save this
00:24 - playground on our desktop okay so this
00:33 - is the first time we're going to be able
00:34 - to express some sort of logic or
00:37 - decision-making in our code so for
00:40 - example let's say I have a variable a
00:43 - which is equal to 20 and let's say I
00:47 - want to print out a statement but
00:49 - depending on what the value of a is so
00:52 - this is a perfect time to use an if
00:54 - statement now an if statement follows
00:56 - this sort of syntax you type if followed
01:00 - by the condition which you want to check
01:03 - so in my case let's say I want to print
01:05 - a statement if a is less than 10 then I
01:13 - want to do something now what I do is I
01:17 - use the curly brackets to specify some
01:22 - code to run if this condition is true so
01:26 - I'm just going to print line hello and
01:33 - you can see that this code doesn't do
01:36 - anything because it's going to check
01:38 - this condition right now it's false so
01:40 - it's not going to execute that code but
01:43 - let's say if I were to change a to 9
01:46 - which is less than 10 now you can see
01:48 - that the code in there executes there's
01:51 - a couple more things that you can do
01:53 - with an if statement you can say if this
01:57 - condition is true then do this code else
02:02 - do something else
02:09 - so what happens here now is ill check
02:13 - this condition if it's true it's going
02:15 - to run this code if it's false it's
02:17 - gonna run this code but it's not going
02:19 - to do both it's gonna do one or the
02:21 - other depending if this condition is
02:23 - true or not so right now it's nine so
02:26 - it's gonna print hello but if I change
02:27 - this to something like 19 then it's
02:30 - gonna run this code and print goodbye
02:33 - instead now I can take this even further
02:35 - and I can say I can add another
02:39 - condition in the middle here else if a
02:46 - is greater than 10 and a is less than 5
02:54 - sorry 15 then do this code so in the
02:59 - middle here I can put something like
03:02 - print line in between and this operator
03:12 - acts as an end both of these conditions
03:15 - have to be true so what happens here is
03:18 - that first it's going to check this
03:20 - statement if it's false it's going to
03:22 - check this statement else if and then
03:26 - finally if that isn't true as well it's
03:28 - going to execute this one so it reads
03:31 - kind of like English if this is true
03:34 - then do this if it's not true then is
03:37 - this true if it's not then finally do
03:41 - else and you can have as many else ifs
03:45 - as you want but it's gonna check from
03:48 - top to bottom and the first true
03:50 - condition that it meets its gonna
03:53 - execute that code in there now also I
03:57 - used this operator and this is an and
04:00 - operator think of it as and basically if
04:03 - a is greater than 10 and a is greater is
04:07 - less than 15 then this condition is true
04:10 - and execute this code in here but this
04:14 - end is just expressed as that
04:18 - I can also do or if I do or then it
04:26 - checks if this is true or if this is
04:30 - true then the whole condition is
04:33 - satisfied and it's gonna execute this
04:35 - code so with an or you'll only need one
04:39 - of these two conditions to be true for
04:42 - this whole branch to be executed and you
04:47 - can chain the ORS and the ends together
04:49 - to express some interesting logic
04:52 - furthermore you can do equals so I can
04:57 - do something like if a equals 15 then do
05:01 - this now keep in mind that I'm not using
05:05 - that because a single equal sign is used
05:08 - for assignment like up here I'm
05:10 - assigning 19 into the variable a so if
05:13 - you're gonna do comparisons you want to
05:15 - do that and lastly if I don't want to
05:20 - have an else statement I don't need it I
05:22 - can go like that so if a is less than 10
05:26 - then print hello if it's not check is a
05:30 - equal to 15 if it's not that nothing
05:34 - happens and then finally there's also
05:39 - less than or equal to you know or
05:42 - greater than or equal to and there's
05:45 - also not equal to so that's expressed by
05:49 - an exclamation mark and an equal sign
05:51 - and you can see here that a is 19 which
05:54 - is not equal to 10 so this condition is
05:57 - true and it executes this code so if
06:01 - statements are pretty powerful and we're
06:02 - going to be using them a lot in our code
06:04 - let's go into our Xcode project and
06:07 - implement an if statement to check which
06:09 - card is higher so right here I have our
06:14 - Xcode project opened and we're going to
06:17 - implement the if statement inside the
06:21 - view controller dot Swift in the
06:23 - playground tapped method so right now
06:25 - when we execute this code it's going to
06:29 - randomly generate a number and
06:32 - sign the corresponding card to the
06:35 - uiimageview and then it's going to
06:37 - randomize a second number and do the
06:40 - same for the second imageview so down
06:43 - here below that we want to determine the
06:50 - higher card so all we have to do is
06:55 - basically write if first random number
06:58 - is greater than second random number
07:02 - open a set of curly braces and inside
07:06 - here let's write a statement to do first
07:13 - card is larger okay
07:17 - and we write an else because if the
07:23 - first number is not greater than it must
07:27 - be less than so in the else branch of
07:30 - code we write second card is larger now
07:36 - we haven't considered the case what if
07:38 - they're tied what if they're the same
07:41 - number right now this code if it's a tie
07:45 - it's going to go into the else statement
07:47 - because all it checks is if the first
07:50 - number is greater than the second number
07:52 - anything else goes into this else branch
07:56 - of code right here what we want to do
07:58 - here is add another condition else if
08:03 - first random number is equal to second
08:08 - random number and that would indicate a
08:11 - tie
08:22 - so with this if statement here we're
08:24 - able to determine a winner based on the
08:27 - random numbers that have been rolled in
08:29 - the next lesson we're going to add some
08:31 - labels to the story board and then we're
08:33 - going to fill in the code in these if
08:35 - branches to update the score label
