02:06 - take advantage of that alright so this
02:08 - week's challenge this week you're going
02:10 - to be working with code I want you to
02:11 - write a function
02:12 - that takes in a string and it checks
02:15 - that string for either lowercase or
02:18 - uppercase A's and it returns an integer
02:20 - either returns zero for no A's in that
02:23 - string or it returns the total count of
02:25 - lowercase and capital uppercase A's in
02:30 - that string you'll find all of the
02:32 - particulars specifics requirements even
02:35 - some sample input in the weekly
02:37 - challenge thread which you can find in
02:39 - that link there's also a reddit thread
02:42 - which i've created for that challenge
02:44 - where you can discuss with other people
02:45 - who are working on it and get some help
02:47 - if you're stuck or something like that
02:49 - so there's is that available alright so
02:52 - that is it for the challenge next up we
02:55 - have the Q&A segment now we only got one
02:58 - question this week so I highly encourage
02:59 - you guys to submit questions for next
03:02 - Friday's video where I'll do the Q&A
03:04 - again and you can ask me any questions
03:06 - like personal business you know anything
03:09 - you want to know about me my life you
03:12 - know it doesn't have to be technical
03:14 - questions I just want this to be fun and
03:16 - a way to engage with you guys alright so
03:18 - this week's question from Dave Noel's on
03:21 - Twitter what Mac are you using it seems
03:23 - so much quicker to start the simulator
03:25 - than my brand-new Mac any tricks to
03:28 - speed it up so to answer question the
03:33 - videos that you see I actually edit out
03:35 - the loading time of the some layers
03:37 - because I don't want people waiting
03:38 - around for the simulator to load so what
03:40 - you might be seeing is that you might
03:43 - think my instantaneous when it really
03:45 - isn't but to answer your question I'm
03:47 - using a retina 5k iMac
03:49 - it's a 27-inch but I upgraded the RAM to
03:52 - 32 gigs of ram and it's got an SSD hard
03:55 - drive I believe there was one viewer who
03:58 - had 4 gigs of ram on their macbook and
04:00 - they were experiencing slow simulator
04:02 - load times when they upgraded their RAM
04:04 - to 16 gigs they experienced significant
04:06 - improvements so I would try upgrading
04:09 - the RAM as kind of like the cheapest
04:10 - solution first and if that doesn't work
04:13 - then you can see if there is a deeper
04:16 - problem than that so that's it for the
04:17 - Q&A this week I highly encourage you
04:19 - guys to submit your questions for the
04:21 - Q&A I'm going to do next Friday
04:23 - remember it doesn't have to be technical
04:24 - questions can be personal you know
04:27 - within reason it could be about my
04:29 - background about my experiences about
04:32 - business whatever okay so in the last
04:33 - bit of news we have a shiny new
04:36 - subreddit you can find it in this link
04:38 - below come hang out share what you're
04:40 - working on share what you're having
04:42 - trouble with if you're having trouble
04:43 - with one of my tutorials post it there
04:45 - as well I can find it sometimes hard to
04:47 - write code in the YouTube comments so I
04:49 - want the subreddit just to be a place
04:51 - where we can all hang out get to know
04:53 - each other interact with other fans of
04:55 - code with Chris and yeah I hope to see a
04:57 - lot of you guys on the subreddit alright
04:59 - so that's it for this week's video
05:00 - before I show you guys what I picked up
05:03 - for Black Friday there's one Black
05:05 - Friday deal that I want to mention and
05:06 - this has to do with all of the motion
05:09 - graphics that you see on my videos all
05:10 - the icons in the thumbnails of my videos
05:13 - and even in my blog articles I use this
05:15 - everywhere and this is a deal by icons
05:19 - eight.com
05:20 - so this site basically provides icons
05:22 - for all of your icon needs and if you
05:25 - they don't have the icon that you need
05:27 - they'll make it for you so I use this
05:29 - stuff everywhere you'll see on my
05:30 - website like I mentioned and videos and
05:32 - apps and stuff like that so I have a
05:35 - subscription I paid one hundred and
05:37 - ninety nine dollars for it per year and
05:39 - my current subscription lasts till the
05:42 - end of June 2018 but they release the
05:45 - deal that's only valid for this weekend
05:47 - it's ninety nine dollars a year so
05:49 - that's fifty percent off I've bought it
05:51 - anyways even though I have another 7
05:53 - months left in my subscription and so
05:55 - that's basically wasted but I wanted
05:58 - this lifetime deal of 99 dollars per
06:02 - year so that's what I wanted to mention
06:03 - it to you guys if you guys want to build
06:05 - apps icons 8 has all of the icons you
06:07 - could need so go check that out in the
06:10 - link in the description below I want to
06:12 - mention that this is an affiliate link
06:14 - so I do get a kickback for it
06:17 - and if you purchase it through my link I
06:19 - thank you sincerely for supporting me
06:21 - and the channel I've been using them for
06:23 - almost a year and I have nothing but
06:25 - good things to say about them alright so
06:27 - that's that let me show you what I
06:28 - bought for Black Friday so I was waiting
06:32 - to pick up these guys the Apple earpods
06:34 - I really like
06:35 - unfortunately they didn't go on sale for
06:38 - Black Friday so I had to buy them full
06:39 - price but I was waiting for a long time
06:41 - and I couldn't wait any longer
06:42 - I also bought a chromecast I actually
06:45 - have an Apple TV but I wanted to try out
06:47 - the chromecast I picked up the Google
06:50 - home Mini because the home pod isn't out
06:53 - yet and I wanted to try this guy out
06:55 - kind of regret it now because it doesn't
06:58 - work with my Apple music subscription
06:59 - there are some rooms in my house that my
07:02 - wife I can't reach so this has actually
07:04 - solved that problem so highly
07:06 - recommended quite expensive though kind
07:08 - of pricy so that's what I've got so far
07:11 - share with me what you guys have picked
07:13 - up or trying to pick up in the comment
07:15 - section below thanks for watching I'll
07:17 - see you guys next week
