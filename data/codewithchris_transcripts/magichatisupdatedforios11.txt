00:15 - hey guys now that I'm my coffee I just
00:18 - wanted to give you guys a progress
00:19 - update and I was able to update magic
00:22 - hat where maybe about 90s % there as you
00:26 - can see everything looks pretty good
00:28 - there are some visual artifacts of
00:30 - thick's kind of like the glow around the
00:32 - letters of the animals and the the Yeti
00:35 - also the animation is a little messed up
00:37 - when he slides in but all in all pretty
00:39 - good so and to share my experience with
00:42 - updating the app because this was built
00:45 - in Swift to not even to a three so I had
00:47 - to update it from sort of two to three
00:49 - and then from three to four and the
00:51 - process from two to three was painful as
00:54 - expected because there were a ton of
00:56 - breaking changes from Swift two to three
00:59 - so I first tried to use the Xcode
01:02 - automatic updater which is supposed to
01:05 - comb through the project and then try to
01:07 - auto fix as much as many things as it
01:10 - can except that when I tried to do that
01:13 - I ran it and then it said it failed it
01:15 - couldn't for some reason it didn't work
01:18 - so what I had to do was I had to
01:21 - basically go through it one by one but
01:24 - the saving grace of it was that I told
01:27 - you there was a lot of generated code
01:29 - right in the last video you saw there
01:32 - was something like five hundred four
01:34 - hundred and sixty three errors or
01:35 - something almost five hundred so a lot
01:38 - of that you know one fix I was able to
01:41 - kind of do a search and replace and fix
01:43 - like thirty things at once
01:46 - but the whole process took about an hour
01:48 - and a half so I did you know that's
01:51 - searching and replacing and updated this
01:53 - with three and then I used Xcode nine
01:56 - beta and I opened the project and the
01:59 - update from Swift three to four was
02:02 - barely anything at all and that's you
02:05 - know that's amazing because the Swift
02:08 - team they promised that with Swift war
02:10 - they wouldn't introduce any breaking
02:12 - changes or they would try not to and
02:14 - sure enough when I was updating my out
02:17 - from three to four it was such an easy
02:18 - process so I hope for you guys out there
02:21 - today who are updating to have three
02:23 - apps to four that you find in the pros
02:26 - pretty easy as well but for me because
02:28 - this hat was Swift too it just just took
02:31 - a lot of time most of it was it wasn't
02:33 - hard it was just tedious work it was a
02:35 - lot a lot of manual labor because a lot
02:37 - of it was just some tactical changes in
02:40 - Swift three that was breaking my old
02:43 - code for example methods might accept
02:46 - different parameters they might be named
02:48 - slightly differently some properties
02:50 - might be accepting different data types
02:52 - now so I had to make those kinds of
02:54 - changes nothing nothing too too bad
02:57 - all right so what's next well we have
03:00 - fixed those couple of visual effect bugs
03:02 - that I mentioned and now we're gonna
03:03 - have to test the app on a whole bunch of
03:05 - different devices to see what comes up
03:07 - and fix those and then lastly we have to
03:09 - prepare the eye for submission like work
03:11 - on the app listing and stuff like that
03:14 - in a couple of videos before I mentioned
03:17 - Steve Young and AB masters
03:18 - well I asked them and he's gonna come on
03:21 - to the YouTube channel next week so he's
03:24 - gonna share some tips and strategies for
03:25 - us that we are going to implement with
03:28 - magic hat when we upload that out to the
03:31 - App Store so be on the lookout for that
03:33 - also next week I'm going to start really
03:36 - seeing some beginner lessons updated
03:38 - ones the ones that I have on my series
03:40 - now the 17 beginner lessons to build a
03:43 - war app those are probably my most
03:45 - popular videos and so I'm going to
03:46 - update those for Xcode 9 and Swift 4 if
03:49 - you've already seen them before or you
03:51 - are an intimate intermediate level
03:54 - programmer then just bear with me while
03:57 - I update those and put those on the
03:59 - channel for people who are just starting
04:01 - out and then I'll get back to producing
04:04 - more intermediate content but I will
04:07 - still release another vlog next week and
04:09 - the Steve Young episode is coming next
04:11 - week as well and also last thing last
04:15 - but not least I want to give you guys
04:18 - the answer is it the question I asked
04:20 - you last week and I want to give you a
04:22 - new question ok so the answer first when
04:26 - I saw people replying after I uploaded
04:28 - that video I actually instantly regret
04:32 - asking that question because some people
04:34 - actually you know I'm so happy and I'm
04:38 - so
04:38 - the fact that some of you think I'm a
04:41 - tiny person because the reality is
04:43 - unfortunately to disappoint is that I'm
04:46 - not tidy and so I did clean up the
04:50 - office for you guys and hopefully I can
04:52 - keep it that clean you know you can
04:53 - comment below and ask me if my office is
04:57 - clean or not from time to time and I can
04:59 - tell you and so that's the answer thank
05:01 - you to all who participated and thank
05:04 - you to you guys who said that I was a
05:06 - tidy person now the this week's question
05:10 - we actually went on a Costco trip and we
05:14 - do these like once every two months and
05:17 - it's always a big affair we always buy a
05:20 - ton of stuff but this time in particular
05:22 - I couldn't believe how much we spent in
05:24 - one single trip and it didn't look like
05:27 - that much in the shopping cart but when
05:28 - I saw the built men so I actually
05:31 - recorded our haul because I forgot the
05:35 - bags we didn't bring bags to Costco so I
05:37 - had to load everything in the car one by
05:39 - one they took everything out of the car
05:41 - when we got home and just put it in a
05:43 - pile before we put everything away I
05:45 - just said hey quickly I'm gonna take the
05:47 - video camera and I'm going to just show
05:50 - you guys what I took so check out this
05:51 - haul let me know in the comments section
