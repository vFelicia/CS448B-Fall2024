00:00 - hey code crew what's up it's Chris here
00:02 - now from time to time I get some of you
00:04 - asking if there's some way that you can
00:07 - support the channel and show your
00:09 - appreciation by sending me a donation or
00:12 - joining my patreon page but
00:14 - unfortunately I don't have a patreon
00:16 - page and I'm not going to create one
00:18 - because you know I thought about
00:19 - creating a patreon page before but when
00:23 - I was brainstorming different types of
00:24 - perks that I can offer in exchange for
00:26 - your support
00:28 - nothing was compelling enough for me to
00:30 - actually go ahead and create that page
00:32 - and it wasn't until recently that I
00:34 - discovered the YouTube membership
00:37 - program which is kind of like patreon
00:39 - but it's actually integrated into the
00:41 - YouTube platform so that's kind of cool
00:43 - I mean it wasn't until I saw that
00:45 - program and saw one specific feature
00:48 - that made me want to create and launch
00:51 - this program and that was that people
00:54 - who are supporting the channel will be
00:56 - recognized in the comment sections below
00:59 - all of my videos as well as in the live
01:01 - chat of my live streams so beside your
01:04 - username you're going to have a badge
01:05 - indicating that you are supporting this
01:07 - channel through the membership program
01:09 - and that badge changes over time the
01:12 - longer your supporter and in addition to
01:15 - that you get access to custom emojis
01:17 - that you can use in your comments and in
01:20 - the chat and so I thought this was
01:21 - really really cool and something that
01:23 - you know a patreon account wouldn't be
01:26 - able to do so that's what this video is
01:27 - about is that I'm launching this YouTube
01:30 - membership program on the channel if you
01:32 - go down below beside the subscribe
01:34 - button you'll actually see a join button
01:36 - and if you click that you'll get a
01:38 - chance to see what the badges look like
01:40 - and what the custom emojis look like now
01:42 - the thing is at this point I have 0
01:44 - members because this is just being
01:46 - launched so I'm limited to only
01:48 - providing 4 emojis now and I don't know
01:52 - why they do that but that's all I could
01:54 - put now when we get at least two members
01:58 - I can do 5 emojis and I only assume that
02:02 - as the membership grows I can add more
02:04 - and more now I've been working with a
02:06 - designer together to custom design these
02:09 - badges and the emojis that we're going
02:11 - to
02:12 - and we created way more than four but
02:14 - unfortunately to my dismay when I tried
02:17 - to add them I could only add four so
02:20 - just to let you guys know as time goes
02:22 - on and there are more members I will be
02:24 - adding more emojis into the membership
02:26 - and also I'd love to hear your feedback
02:29 - what sort of emojis and sentiments and
02:31 - emotions do you guys want to express in
02:33 - the comments and in the chat let me know
02:35 - and we're going to get those emojis
02:37 - created so why don't we jump into the
02:40 - screen right here my desktop and we can
02:43 - take a look at what we what I've been
02:45 - working on with the designer so here are
02:48 - two different versions of the badges
02:49 - that we thought of oh that we arrived at
02:52 - and I decided to go with this version
02:55 - here on the left I just like the way
02:58 - that it looked a lot more so the emojis
03:01 - that we have so far are these guys right
03:04 - here
03:05 - the fist represent Sun pump you might
03:08 - have seen some of those in my beginner
03:09 - videos there is code crew there is my
03:13 - logo there's an Xcode logo which we
03:16 - might do something with and there's a
03:17 - yeehaw now some other icons that we have
03:20 - been working with on actually you can
03:24 - see some of the iterations that we've
03:26 - done together there another one that we
03:30 - want to do is on fire now again I would
03:34 - love to hear what you guys think would
03:37 - make great emojis because that's going
03:39 - to really guide what we create and what
03:42 - sort of emojis we put into the
03:44 - membership now in addition to emojis
03:46 - there are perks that I can offer right
03:49 - now because this program is just
03:51 - launching I don't have anything else to
03:53 - offer aside from the badges beside your
03:56 - name and the custom OGIS that you can
03:58 - use however in the future I am thinking
04:01 - of adding some exclusive trainings that
04:04 - you would get as part of the membership
04:06 - and potentially it just may be a private
04:11 - forum or something like that or a
04:12 - private group where supporters of the
04:15 - channel can meet and make a chat with
04:17 - each other so all of those perks or any
04:20 - perks that I decide to add to the
04:22 - membership you will get access to
04:24 - as a member even if you joined today and
04:27 - one last thing I want to say is that
04:29 - don't feel pressured to join this
04:31 - membership program it's only if a it's
04:35 - something that you can afford and beat
04:37 - you want to show your appreciation and
04:38 - support the channel and see even if you
04:41 - can't or don't join the membership I
04:43 - love each and every one of you guys and
04:46 - I appreciate so much you guys watching
04:48 - the videos liking the videos commenting
04:50 - that in itself is a lot of support for
04:54 - code with Chris because we're nearing
04:56 - two hundred thousand subscribers and by
04:58 - the time this video goes out I think we
05:00 - might just be out of 200,000 so you know
05:04 - thank you guys so much for that this
05:07 - membership program is purely optional
05:09 - nothing's gonna change with the channel
05:13 - so I don't want you guys to worry about
05:15 - the introduction of this thing it's
05:17 - merely for people who want to support
05:19 - this channel and I feel like I want to
05:22 - recognize those people and the YouTube
05:24 - membership program makes that possible
05:26 - so thank you guys so much
05:27 - check out the badges and the emojis by
05:29 - clicking on the join button below and
05:31 - whether you join or not I appreciate
05:33 - every single one of you thank you so
05:35 - much I'll talk to you guys next time
