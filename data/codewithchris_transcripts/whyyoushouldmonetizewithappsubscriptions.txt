00:00 - This year we've built an Instagram
analytics app and we're on the verge
00:04 - of launching V,
one of the official code with Chris app.
00:06 - Now there's no doubt in my mind that when
it comes to monetizing these two app,
00:10 - I'm going to be using
a subscriptionbased strategy.
00:13 - Now, in this video, I want to tell you why
that is and what are the important metrics
00:17 - to watch out for with a subscription
based business or app.
00:20 - Alright, let's dive in.
00:21 - Hey, Code per.
00:23 - My name is Chris and welcome to Code
00:24 - with Chris where we learn how
to build app and monetize apps.
00:27 - Let me explain to you why I'm such a huge
fan of the subscription model and how it's
00:31 - resulted in better products
for my business,
00:33 - better customer experiences, and how
it's made my business sustainable.
00:37 - The business I'm talking about is this one
00:39 - cold with Chris, but there are a lot
of parallels to an app business.
00:43 - Let me explain.
00:44 - You see, we used to sell courses as one
time fee with lifetime course updates.
00:50 - And while that was great and it did make
00:52 - the business sustainable when we were
looking to grow and that meant hiring more
00:57 - people, Apple bringing
more people on board.
00:59 - It was really hard to do that.
01:01 - I felt really nervous because I didn't
want to make a commitment to hiring
01:04 - someone and then only to have to let them
go because we couldn't make payroll.
01:08 - So about a year ago we moved
to a subscription model for our courses,
01:13 - and at first I was really,
really scared to do that because I thought
01:17 - the business would tank and code was
Chris would no longer be sustainable.
01:21 - Instead, here's what happened.
01:23 - Instead of a one time purchase of $294,
it is now $29 a month,
01:28 - which meant that it lowered the barrier
to entry for a lot of people.
01:32 - The price was a lot more inclusive
and at the end of the day I was able
01:36 - to help a lot more people through
the courses and that aligns
01:40 - with my mission to bring more
people into the world of coding.
01:44 - Number two, my paid courses got a lot
better because instead of focusing
01:48 - on marketing and trying to bring as many
people in through the door as possible,
01:52 - my focus became on the training inside
of the paid program so that the current
01:57 - customers would continue
with their subscription.
02:00 - Number three people were getting a lot
more for their money because when they
02:04 - were paying 294 for a one time fee,
they were getting three courses,
02:08 - the foundations, the databases,
and the design course.
02:11 - Now for $29 a month, they're getting those
three courses as well as all of the other
02:16 - courses that we have added
since then to the membership.
02:19 - So it's an all access fee
for an even lower price.
02:22 - Number four people are actually getting
better results, believe it or not,
02:26 - and that's because they're more motivated
to learn and to use the product.
02:29 - Think about it this way.
02:30 - And I'll be honest as well.
02:32 - How many times have you bought a course
for a one time fee only to leave it there,
02:36 - never to access it again
and never to use it.
02:39 - I know I've done it many times,
02:40 - and the reason for this is because
the act of buying the course feels good.
02:44 - It feels like you're taking
a step towards your goal.
02:46 - But the real work comes in actually using
02:49 - the course, doing the work
and putting in the effort.
02:52 - Right.
02:52 - So now being a monthly subscription every
single month, when the user gets filled,
02:58 - they are reminded that either A,
they should cancel the subscription or B,
03:03 - they should actually use the product
and try to get some results from it.
03:07 - And as a result, people are actually
using it more and getting more results.
03:12 - Now, number five,
03:13 - we eventually reach the same revenue
levels as we did
03:16 - before we implement the subscriptions,
and the revenue has continued to grow
03:21 - because people have continued
to renew their subscriptions.
03:25 - Now, how does all these things
relate to the world of apps?
03:28 - Well, just in the same way
that subscriptions have helped code
03:32 - with Chris, I'd expect the same
thing to happen with an app.
03:35 - To proof my point, let's compare
a paid app versus a subscription app.
03:40 - So
03:41 - let's pretend here's my app
and we're doing a paid app strategy.
03:45 - Now I'm going to sell it
for a one time cost of $1.
03:47 - Someone finds it and buys it.
03:49 - So I get a dollar and they really like it.
03:51 - They use it all the time.
03:52 - Then let's say another person comes
03:55 - and buys it and I get a dollar
and they don't like it that much.
03:58 - Well, you know what?
Either way, I still get my $1 from them.
04:01 - Also, my marketing is currently bringing
04:04 - in 30 people per month,
so my revenue is $30 per month.
04:08 - If I want to grow my business,
04:10 - I'm going to have to increase my marketing
to get users through the door that might
04:15 - be paying for ads working on my app Store
rankings, creating a blog to educate
04:19 - people and lead people to my app or any
other variety of ways to do app marketing.
04:24 - If I focus instead on the product,
04:25 - my revenue will still be $30 a month,
whether it's a better product or not.
04:31 - Now, ideally, you would work on both your
product to make it a better product
04:35 - and work on your marketing to increase
the number of users you get per month.
04:40 - But as an indie developer or a solo
developer that's often hard to do.
04:45 - You need to focus in one place.
04:46 - Now, let's switch gears and monetize
this app with a subscription strategy.
04:51 - Here's how that would look.
04:53 - Our app is free with a $1
per month subscription.
04:56 - The marketing is still bringing in 30 free
04:59 - users per month, same as
with the previous scenario.
05:02 - Now, let's say maybe ten users out
of 30 convert to paying customers.
05:07 - That means that they buy the subscription.
05:09 - So the first month revenue would be $10.
05:12 - Now in the second month, this is where
things start to get interesting.
05:16 - My marketing again brings in another 30
05:19 - new people, ten of whom convert
to paying customers.
05:22 - So the revenue this month is $10.
05:24 - But in addition to that,
05:26 - a portion of the people from month
one stay for another month.
05:30 - So let's say five people,
so they pay another $1 each.
05:34 - So my total month
to revenue is $10 plus $5.
05:38 - So in total $15.
05:41 - So I hope you can see that even though
my marketing is still only bringing 30 new
05:46 - people a month, my monthly revenue will
slowly start to build up as users renew
05:50 - their subscriptions, and it's going to get
up to a point where it's going to surpass
05:55 - the $30 a month that the former
paid app example was bringing in.
06:01 - So with this subscription strategy,
I can focus on creating a great app
06:06 - that is engaging, helpful,
and deliver so much value that people
06:10 - happily pay every month because
they think it's worth it.
06:13 - My time is focused
on product and retention.
06:16 - Instead of marketing.
06:17 - To recap with a paid app,
06:19 - I have to focus on getting more paid
users in order to grow my revenue.
06:23 - So that's going to be
a focus on marketing.
06:26 - With a subscription based monetization
strategy, I can increase my revenue either
06:31 - by getting more users through marketing
or by making a better product.
06:36 - So people continue paying
month after month.
06:38 - If I'm a solo indie developer or
entrepreneur who only has time to focus
06:43 - on one thing,
I would choose the subscription
06:45 - monetization strategy and focus
on making a great product.
06:49 - Now all of that is great.
06:51 - But the question on your mind
has to be, how do we do it?
06:54 - Well for our Instagram Analytics app
and for the code with Chris app,
06:58 - I'm going to be implementing
subscriptions using Revenue Cat.
07:01 - Now they're sponsoring this video,
but regardless of that,
07:04 - I would still choose to use Revenue Cat
than to not use Revenue Cat.
07:08 - They just make implementing subscriptions
and in app purchases so much easier.
07:12 - And with the charts that I'm about to show
07:15 - you, they give me a clear view
into my app subscription business.
07:19 - If this is the first time you're hearing
07:21 - about Revenue Cat, I have a video series
on how to sign up for a free account,
07:25 - how to set it up, how to use
It inside your Xcode project.
07:27 - You can check it out right over here.
07:29 - Now let's dive into the Revenue App
dashboard and take a look at their charts.
07:33 - Now, a quick note that Revenue Cat has
changed their pricing so that they don't
07:38 - make any money unless you are
making money with your app.
07:41 - It used to be that the Starter and Pro
07:43 - tiers were a fixed monthly fee,
but now it is a percentage
07:47 - of your monthly track revenue
beyond the first $1,000 per month.
07:53 - So the charts that I'm going to talk about
07:55 - and the metrics that will be analyzing
is going to be in this starter tier.
07:59 - So the in App Purchase Analytics you do
get some basic metrics and basic charts
08:04 - for the free tier,
but for the starter tier,
08:06 - you can use all of this for free getting
started and you won't be charged anything
08:11 - unless your app starts making
more than a $1,000 a month.
08:15 - So we go down here with a
calculator $1,000 a month.
08:19 - It's still all free.
08:21 - But for example, if you're making 2000 or
08:25 - $3,000 a month, it becomes $24
a month with a starter tier.
08:29 - So this sort of pricing sort of taxes
08:31 - the rich and taxes the people who are
making a ton of money with their app
08:35 - and really helps us in the app developers
who are just getting started to use some
08:40 - of these very powerful
features for no cost up front.
08:43 - Now, having said that,
let's dive into the Revenue App dashboard
08:46 - and take a look at how these charts are
going to help us make informed
08:49 - and intelligent decisions
about our app business.
08:52 - Now, when you come into your Revenue App
08:54 - dashboard, you're going to see something
like this under the charts section.
08:58 - For me, I don't have any data in my charts
yet because I've yet to implement this
09:02 - inside my Instagram Analytics
app and the code with Chris app.
09:05 - But I do have some charts
with data that we will use.
09:09 - And I'll explain to you how the data
09:11 - and all of these charts translate to your
decisions that you make for your app.
09:15 - So let's start off by looking
at the Active Subscriptions chart.
09:19 - Now, this active subscriptions chart shows
09:22 - you how many total active subscriptions
you have at the end of each period.
09:26 - It's a great top level metric
09:28 - that at a glance tells you
how big your business is.
09:31 - Keep in mind, however,
09:32 - that there are different types
of subscriptions that you may have
09:35 - with different periods
and different dollar amounts.
09:38 - This aggregate doesn't show you
09:40 - that breakdown which subscriptions
make up this number.
09:43 - Also, keep in mind that subscriptions
that have auto renewed disabled.
09:48 - That means the user is not intending
09:50 - to renew, but their subscription
is still currently active.
09:54 - Those numbers are also counted in here.
09:57 - Luckily, we have other charts at our
09:59 - disposal to drill down
and get a clearer picture.
10:02 - So let's move on to the Active
Subscriptions Movement chart.
10:06 - This chart is a supplement to the Active
10:08 - subscription chart that we
just talked about.
10:10 - It shows you how many new subscriptions
you're getting in each period,
10:14 - but also how many subscriptions
have been canceled.
10:17 - Also known as turned subscriptions.
10:19 - The number of new active subscriptions
10:22 - indicates the health
of your marketing engine.
10:25 - If it is dropping,
10:26 - then your existing marketing channels may
be dying off, or maybe they may be losing
10:31 - effectiveness, or there
may be new competition.
10:34 - Or maybe it's just the seasonal
10:35 - fluctuation and maybe
it's completely normal.
10:38 - And there are some more charts that we're
10:40 - gonna look at that will help you
pinpoint exactly what's the problem.
10:43 - On the other hand, if you're implementing
10:45 - a brand new marketing strategy or you are
trying out a new marketing channel,
10:51 - this number of active subscriptions will
also tell you if that initiative is
10:56 - working out because you'd expect to see
a rise in this number period over period.
11:01 - Now, the number of turn subscriptions is
also a really useful number to watch,
11:06 - because if this is growing,
then you should be concerned about why
11:10 - the number of people leaving your app or
canceling their subscriptions is
11:15 - on the rise as you refine your product
and you implement new features.
11:19 - I would expect to see this
number get lower and lower.
11:22 - So that is one number to monitor if you
are actively working to reduce your turn.
11:28 - All right, let's move on to the annual
Recurring revenue chart.
11:32 - This shows you the annual recurring
revenue of your subscriber base.
11:36 - Now, this is a better measure
11:38 - of the health of your business compared
to the number of active subscriptions.
11:42 - Using this number, you can make strategic
11:44 - business decisions, such as how much money
to allocate to various parts of your
11:49 - business, such as marketing, product
development, hiring employees, and so on.
11:53 - Also, on a side note,
11:55 - if you decide to sell your app business
in the future,
11:57 - this is the number that potential buyers
are going to be looking at as well.
12:02 - Now, the monthly recurring revenue chart
12:04 - tells a different story compared
to the annual recurring revenue.
12:08 - While the Arr is great for judging
the size of your business,
12:12 - the MRR gives you an idea of the direction
your business is going in.
12:17 - Is MRR going up or down?
12:20 - If it's flat lining or even declining?
12:22 - Do you have a churn problem?
12:24 - Or maybe you're not bringing
in enough new users through the door?
12:27 - If, on the other hand,
your MRR is trending up.
12:30 - Congratulations, that's great.
12:32 - Identify ways to make it
increase even faster.
12:36 - Furthermore, if you have a few years
12:38 - of data to look at,
interesting patterns start to emerge,
12:41 - for example, fluctuations due to world
events or seasonal fluctuations that will
12:47 - give you some clues as to when
you should boost your marketing.
12:51 - For example, now moving on.
12:52 - If the MRR chart tells you that direction
your business is going,
12:56 - the MRR movement chart shows you more
detail about why it's happening.
13:01 - It shows you the new revenue you've added
in each period through new active
13:06 - subscriptions, or maybe
subscription upgrades.
13:09 - And it also tells you how much revenue has
turned or how much revenue you've lost
13:13 - in the same period through
cancellations or nonpayment.
13:17 - This lets you identify whether you need
13:19 - to focus on reducing turn
or upping your marketing.
13:22 - Ideally, you do both.
13:23 - But again, as an indie developer,
13:25 - you've got limited time and this is going
to show you where to focus that time.
13:29 - Now moving on to the revenue chart.
13:31 - This chart shows you the actual revenue
that was collected in the period the Arr
13:36 - and Mr are projections based
on the active and lost subscription data.
13:42 - This revenue chart shows you actual
dollars earned and collected.
13:46 - Not much more to say about it than that.
13:48 - Now, the next chart is very important.
13:50 - The Subscription Retention Chart this
13:52 - shows you how long users
are staying subscribed.
13:55 - This is extremely important.
13:57 - It gives you a picture of the average
lifetime value of a customer.
14:01 - On one hand, it shows you how satisfied
14:05 - your customers are with your product
and how long they continue to use it.
14:09 - On the other hand,
14:11 - it also gives you a number for when you're
spending dollars on marketing,
14:15 - how much you can afford to spend
to acquire new customers.
14:19 - So it's very important to know how
long your subscribers are staying.
14:23 - Subscribed.
Now customers are broken into cohorts as
14:27 - you can see by month,
and this lets you run experiments
14:29 - on certain months to see if
those users stay longer.
14:32 - Now in the starter tier of revenue cat,
you can also do custom cohorts.
14:36 - So that's really helpful.
14:37 - If you want to run an experiment and you
want to change something up and then you
14:42 - want to see for those customers that you
change things up for,
14:47 - how long they end up staying to see if you
should implement that tweak or that change
14:52 - or not, that's something
that you can do as well.
14:55 - Now, one very common thing that you'll see
14:57 - in subscription based app are free trials,
or usually it's a free trial.
15:03 - So the next chart trial conversion chart
15:06 - shows you how your free trials, or rather,
how many of your users are taking you up
15:13 - on your free trial,
and then how many of them are either
15:16 - canceling that free trial or
converting to paying subscriptions?
15:20 - So let's go through this really quickly.
15:22 - All the new users in your app are
counted in the new customers column.
15:26 - I know that's a little misleading because
15:28 - they're not technically a customer
yet they're a potential customer.
15:33 - If they take you up on your free trial,
they'll move over to the trial column,
15:37 - but they'll also be represented
in the pending column.
15:40 - Now why is that user represented in the
trial column and also depending column?
15:44 - Well, this lets you compare the number
of new customers or new users.
15:49 - I would actually say the number of new
15:52 - users compared to the number of people
who took you up on your trial.
15:56 - So you can get a percentage of how many
15:59 - users actually took you
up on the free trial.
16:02 - And as for the pending column,
they'll either move to the abandoned
16:07 - column if they disabled renewing
of that trial,
16:11 - or they'll move over to the converted
column if they actually to a paying
16:17 - subscription and they didn't
cancel the free trial.
16:20 - So again, using this data, you can see how
many users took you up on the free trial.
16:26 - And then of those people who took you up
on the trial, how many of them either
16:30 - canceled or turned into a paid
subscription, and that data is really
16:35 - useful because it gives you a benchmark
of where you stand, and then you can tweak
16:40 - your app, maybe tweak your offers,
your prices, your durations,
16:45 - present the offers at different points
16:47 - in the app and see how
that affects this data.
16:51 - So again, this is split by cohorts
16:53 - by default is by month,
so you can either run your experiments per
16:57 - month, or again, you can do custom
cohorts, which is what I'd recommend.
17:02 - That's going to let you see if
17:04 - that particular experiment was successful
or not in increasing the number of trials
17:10 - or increasing the number
of trials to paid users.
17:14 - And then you can actually integrate
17:16 - that feature into your app or
ditch it and try something else.
17:20 - All right, let's move
on to the Active Trials chart.
17:22 - This shows you how many people are
currently on a trial subscription.
17:26 - These people can potentially abandon the
trial or convert to a full subscription.
17:32 - Using this chart,
you can foresee the potential impact
17:34 - on your business and revenue
in the near feature.
17:37 - Now the Active Trials Movement Chart this
17:40 - chart breaks down what's actually
happening with your trials.
17:43 - You can see the growth or decline in both
new trials and abandoned trials going back
17:48 - to the trial conversion
chart for just a moment.
17:51 - If I were trying to convert more new users
into trialing users, I could tweak my app,
17:58 - maybe tweak my prices or my offers,
or where I'm presenting that trial offer.
18:06 - And then I would monitor the Active Trials
18:08 - movement to see if there is an increase
in the number of new trials.
18:13 - On the flip side,
if I'm running an experiment to try
18:16 - to reduce the number of abandoned trials,
I would be looking for a decline
18:21 - in the number of expired
trials throughout the period.
18:25 - This Active Trials Movement chart allows
18:28 - me to see if my experiments
are effective or not.
18:31 - So as you can see, Revenue Cat helps you
18:34 - make smart decisions about your business
because it gives you a clear picture
18:38 - into the health of your
app subscription business.
18:41 - And just to recap.
18:43 - I think the subscription monetization
18:45 - strategy is a great one for indie
developers or solo entrepreneurs because
18:50 - we have limited time to decide
where to place our focus.
18:53 - And having a subscription based app allows
18:56 - you to focus on your app,
trying to make it the best product you can
19:00 - while still enjoying revenue
growth month over month.
19:04 - Now, if you are interested in trying out
19:06 - Revenue Cat for free, you can
go ahead and create an account.
19:09 - Just visit code with Chris.
19:11 - Com our Cat now just to be completely
19:14 - transparent, I'm not going to get any sort
of Commission or kickback from that,
19:18 - but it does allow Revenue Cat to know
that you guys being coded with Chris.
19:22 - Viewers are interested in more
content around App monetization.
19:27 - After you do that, go ahead and watch our
series right over here on how to use
19:32 - Revenue Cat inside Xcode
and for building your iOS apps.
19:36 - Lastly, if you liked this video,
