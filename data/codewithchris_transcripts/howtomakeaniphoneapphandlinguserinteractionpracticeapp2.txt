00:06 - okay so what's an iPhone application
00:08 - without some user interaction right so
00:11 - now in this next demo you're going to
00:14 - practice how to handle user interaction
00:18 - for buttons and how to let the user into
00:21 - text into a text box and we'll make that
00:23 - text change the hello world label all
00:26 - right let's do it so we're going to
00:28 - learn how to handle some basic user
00:30 - interaction and get you guys
00:32 - familiarized with how to hook up the UI
00:34 - elements you create in the zip files to
00:36 - the view controller so that you can
00:38 - manage those UI elements so let's get
00:40 - started by creating a brand new project
00:42 - I'm going to go to Xcode create a new
00:44 - Xcode project and I'm going to choose
00:46 - single View application for these
00:48 - settings I am going to just name mine
00:51 - user interaction demo you can name it
00:54 - anything you want actually and for
00:56 - devices we just want to choose iPhone
00:58 - and use automatic reference counting and
01:01 - the other two are unchecked you
01:03 - starboard zone unit click Next and save
01:06 - it somewhere and if you guys forget what
01:09 - the create new project settings are I'll
01:12 - have the link to the article where I
01:14 - explain them in the description of this
01:15 - video so you can go ahead and check that
01:17 - if you're curious okay so let's start by
01:21 - adding some UI elements to our view so
01:22 - go ahead and click view controller zip
01:24 - and then down here in the lower
01:26 - right-hand corner now a couple of you
01:28 - guys have stumbled on this in the
01:30 - comments so I just want to point out
01:32 - that in the lower right hand corner here
01:34 - there are a couple of tabs so yours
01:36 - might be on file template library code
01:37 - snippet library the one we want is
01:39 - objects and it's this third icon right
01:41 - here so once you're on here you actually
01:43 - have these UI elements that you can drag
01:45 - on to the screen so I'm going to add a
01:47 - label just drag that onto my view put it
01:50 - in the middle I'm going to stretch it
01:51 - out a bit and then I am also going to
01:57 - add a a button and lastly I'm going to
02:03 - add I'm going to search for text field
02:05 - and add a UI text field to our screen as
02:09 - well
02:11 - so the last practice that we did was a
02:14 - simple hello world that we just put a
02:17 - label on the view and then we renamed it
02:19 - hello world and we ran the simulator
02:21 - this time we're going to allow the user
02:23 - to type in some custom text in here and
02:26 - when they click the button it's going to
02:28 - change the label so I'm going to teach
02:29 - you how to handle that you know basic
02:30 - sort of typing and button handling
02:33 - interaction okay I'm just going to hit
02:36 - the button here and change the name
02:40 - change text okay and what you want to do
02:53 - now is in the upper right hand corner
02:55 - here you see this little icon that looks
02:57 - like a tuxedo well that's called the
02:59 - assistant editor and if you click that
03:01 - you'll see that it opens up two panes so
03:04 - if you've got a small laptop screen it
03:06 - might be a little hard to see if you
03:08 - need more space there's these icons up
03:10 - here in the upper right called view and
03:11 - you can actually hide specific tabs of
03:14 - your interface so right now what we want
03:18 - to really see are the two panes
03:20 - so what assistant editor does is in your
03:23 - main view you've got the zip file here
03:25 - assistant editor tries to show you the
03:28 - companion file for for the file you're
03:30 - looking at so remember we we talked
03:32 - about a class having a dot H and a dot M
03:34 - file so if you are looking at a dot H
03:36 - file and you opened up assistant editor
03:38 - then it might open up the dot M file as
03:40 - the companion file and vice-versa so we
03:43 - know that the zip file is a view and
03:45 - each view is managed by a view
03:47 - controller so when we open up assistant
03:49 - editor it attempts to figure out what
03:51 - file I should open and right now it's
03:53 - it's thinking view controller dot H
03:55 - which is exactly what we want and if
03:57 - your file on the right pane is not view
03:59 - controller dot H then here are a couple
04:01 - of ways that you can choose so you can
04:03 - can hit this button here and you can
04:06 - choose or here or if that doesn't work
04:08 - you can hit this little icon right here
04:09 - and you can choose counter parts you
04:13 - know there's a couple of files in your
04:15 - project that you can choose and so once
04:18 - you have the zip file on your left hand
04:19 - side and the view controller dot H on
04:21 - the right hand side what we want to do
04:23 - now is a
04:24 - beause these UI elements to the view
04:26 - controller so that the view controller
04:28 - has references property references to
04:31 - these elements so that we can modify
04:33 - them I'll show you what I mean so on
04:35 - your keyboard you have to hold down the
04:36 - control button and then I'm going to
04:38 - while holding down the control button
04:40 - click and drag and you'll see that
04:43 - there's a blue line following your mouse
04:45 - as soon as you do that don't let go of
04:46 - control and then drag it over here under
04:49 - the interface file sorry in under the
04:51 - interface line in the dot H file and
04:54 - then let go of the click so while still
04:56 - holding control and what pops up is a
04:58 - little dialog asking you what do you
05:00 - want to name your property and I I don't
05:02 - think we've gone through properties in
05:03 - the last lesson yet but keep in mind
05:05 - this is a practice so I'm going to tell
05:06 - you what to do in this practice video
05:08 - and then the following video is a recap
05:10 - where I explain what happened and what
05:12 - the app flow was and kind of go more in
05:14 - depth about what you did for now I just
05:16 - want you guys to follow along and try to
05:18 - practice so what I hadn't type here is
05:24 - I'm going to call it the change text
05:27 - button so this is a very easy way for
05:30 - you to create properties that reference
05:32 - your UI elements by doing this control
05:34 - click I'm go also going to control click
05:36 - the text box and I'm going to call it
05:40 - custom text field and then I'm going to
05:44 - do the same thing with the UI label so
05:46 - cold down control click drag and call it
05:50 - we call it the hello label okay so now
05:53 - we've created three properties that
05:55 - represent the three UI elements and so
05:57 - now our view controller we can reference
05:59 - these properties to control the elements
06:01 - here and so let's let's run our
06:03 - application to see what we get so you
06:09 - know at this point button doesn't do
06:11 - anything and the text field brings up
06:14 - the keyboard but you can't dismiss the
06:16 - keyboard and clicking the button doesn't
06:17 - do anything okay so let's stop it and
06:19 - let's look at how to handle a button
06:22 - press so now what we want to do is we're
06:24 - going to stay in an assistant editor on
06:26 - the right hand side you want to go into
06:28 - the implementation file because we want
06:30 - to create a method to handle the button
06:32 - click so in the dot M file all you have
06:34 - to do is use the control click and drag
06:36 - for the button
06:37 - and then just drag it in an empty space
06:39 - here to create a new method I'm going to
06:41 - call it to change text click now
06:46 - whenever that button is clicked it's
06:48 - going to call this method and if you
06:49 - remember back in the dot H file we've
06:51 - created properties for all of these
06:53 - things so what I can do is I can say
06:56 - first I'm going to store the text in the
06:58 - custom text field in a variable so I'm
07:01 - going to create a new string variable
07:03 - called custom text and inside this
07:06 - variable I'm going to put in the
07:09 - property that we created was custom text
07:12 - field and it has a text property so what
07:15 - this does is it's going to take the text
07:17 - from this custom text field and it's
07:19 - going to grab the text property of that
07:22 - UI element which is the text that the
07:23 - user filled in and I can put it into
07:25 - this variable called custom text the
07:27 - next thing I'm going to do is reference
07:30 - the label hello label and change its
07:33 - text so the label also has a text
07:35 - property I'm just going to assign it the
07:38 - custom text variable so it's going to
07:40 - put whatever text is in the custom text
07:42 - variable into my hello world label so
07:45 - now let's run that and see what happens
07:49 - so I'm going to fill in some text here
07:51 - maybe let's put it something more
07:54 - concrete say hello
07:55 - right-click change text so you change
07:57 - the text here now this keyboard is still
07:59 - is still up so we got a final way to
08:02 - address that so stop the simulator and
08:04 - what we want to do is say after we hit
08:08 - the button and it changes the text we
08:09 - also want to call a method on the custom
08:13 - text field called resign first responder
08:15 - and this method will actually cause the
08:18 - keyboard to disappear so let's run our
08:20 - simulator and try it out so now I hit
08:24 - hello and you can see the keyboard
08:27 - disappears but there's also another
08:29 - situation where we would want the
08:31 - keyboard to disappear right if we want
08:33 - it to cancel out of it we didn't want to
08:34 - change the text and you want to you know
08:36 - click somewhere out here you want it
08:37 - also to to make the keyboard disappear
08:41 - so what we got to do is add another
08:43 - method
08:46 - so you'll actually see that it will
08:48 - attempt to pre-fill it for you and in
08:52 - the next lesson when we go through
08:54 - storyboards and navigating multiple
08:56 - views then I talked about method
08:58 - overriding but this is a little preview
08:59 - of what's to come you are actually
09:01 - overriding this method so what happens
09:03 - is when the user taps on the screen
09:05 - it'll trigger this method so that's the
09:08 - perfect method we want to use to resign
09:12 - first responder and cause that keyboard
09:14 - to disappear so now let's run it again
09:16 - and now you can see that I can tap
09:19 - anywhere to get rid of the keyboard and
09:24 - changing the text will get rid of the
09:26 - keyboard as well so that was pretty easy
09:28 - now you've learned how to use a UI text
09:31 - field and you've learned how to handle
09:34 - button presses so now let's go to the
09:36 - next lesson and explain the app flow and
09:38 - talk about what's happening behind the
09:40 - scenes as always don't forget that there
09:42 - are notes in the description below that
09:44 - you can go to the text version and you
09:46 - can ask any questions here or on my site
09:49 - and I will answer them and if you felt
09:51 - that you've learned something please
09:52 - share it with any friends or colleagues
09:54 - that would be interested in iPhone
09:56 - development and help me spread the word
09:58 - thank you so much for watching and I'll
10:00 - see you guys in the next lesson bye bye
