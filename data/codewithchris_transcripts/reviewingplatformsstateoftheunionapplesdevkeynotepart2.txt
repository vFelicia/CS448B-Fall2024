00:06 - hey everyone can you hear me
00:08 - uh is the the mic good
00:12 - how's it going zach akhil
00:16 - are you back
00:22 - hello sri charon sorry if i'm
00:24 - mispronouncing that but please let me
00:26 - know
00:28 - zac you were testing concurrency
00:30 - features how did that go you downloaded
00:32 - xcode beta
00:43 - guys today i have a second monitor so i
00:45 - set up a second screen
00:47 - so now hopefully i'll be able to keep an
00:50 - eye on the chat
00:50 - while also um doing whatever we're doing
00:54 - on the screen
00:59 - how's everyone doing
01:07 - all right cool so yesterday if you were
01:11 - here
01:11 - we were going through the platform state
01:13 - of the union just for
01:15 - anyone that is wait before i just
01:18 - speak for 30 minutes with no one can
01:20 - hear me uh
01:21 - let me check the audio can you guys hear
01:23 - me is my mic
01:24 - loud enough is the background music soft
01:27 - enough
01:28 - and you guys can see me right
01:30 - everything's good
01:37 - is my chat not updating okay
01:47 - cool yeah my chat is really not
01:50 - updating in real time give me a sec
01:57 - all right great um and this time
02:00 - the chat hey mark good to see you
02:03 - so this time the chat stream should
02:06 - actually be
02:06 - it should actually stay on the screen
02:09 - under my
02:10 - uh thumbnail in the upper right corner
02:12 - because yesterday i think when i had set
02:13 - it up the chat messages just disappeared
02:15 - as soon as they appeared
02:17 - after a couple of seconds so hopefully
02:18 - we get a stream of chat messages now
02:21 - uh give me a high give me a yes give me
02:23 - uh you're excited if
02:26 - you're excited to see this uh just so
02:30 - just
02:30 - a small recap for everyone yesterday
02:32 - that wasn't here the platform state of
02:34 - the union
02:35 - is basically apple's dev oriented
02:39 - broadcast to talk about all of the wwc
02:42 - dc new features and how it applies to
02:45 - developers and how developers can
02:47 - take advantage of the things that are
02:49 - coming down the pipe
02:50 - uh and all of this you know applies to
02:52 - the xcode betas and
02:55 - the mac os betas and stuff like that so
02:57 - you will have to download some beta
02:59 - software if you want to test some of
03:00 - these out
03:01 - like zach did um in the chat so
03:04 - yesterday we went through a couple of
03:05 - big announcements i'm not going to go
03:06 - through
03:07 - all of these in depth again but just at
03:10 - a high level we went through xcode cloud
03:12 - which is apple's new way of helping us
03:16 - take more of the development process
03:18 - into xcode so we don't need to leave
03:20 - xcode to do a variety of different
03:22 - things and it applies more to
03:25 - working in teams with more than one
03:26 - person but even if you're working with
03:29 - one person there's some pretty handy
03:30 - features like
03:32 - building in the cloud and being able to
03:34 - run your test cases simultaneously on
03:36 - multiple devices screens
03:38 - and even beta os's so that's really cool
03:42 - we talked a little bit about swift
03:44 - concurrency and we did an xcode demo
03:46 - about
03:47 - what that currently looks like and by
03:49 - the way i'm mentioning this so that
03:51 - in case you want to go and check out the
03:53 - the stream replay for that
03:55 - it is available on the channel so you
03:57 - can check that out
04:03 - excuse me we talked about the swift ui
04:06 - a couple of new components that they
04:09 - actually really useful components
04:11 - there's a
04:11 - new table component there are a lot of
04:13 - new modifiers that made it really easy
04:15 - to work with lists and add
04:18 - special features to lists and this is
04:21 - where we ended off
04:22 - on swift playgrounds so let me just
04:25 - bring up that section and again i'm not
04:28 - gonna play the audio
04:29 - uh so that i can talk over it but number
04:31 - two i don't want
04:33 - to potentially have any sort of uh
04:36 - copyright strikes so right now
04:39 - on ipad you can already get this app
04:43 - called swift playgrounds if you weren't
04:44 - aware of it and it's actually a great
04:47 - interactive way for people to learn
04:48 - swift and to
04:51 - learn how to code but the current
04:53 - version of swift playgrounds you can't
04:55 - really build apps on it
04:57 - so we actually get a lot of people
04:59 - coming to our channel and our forum
05:01 - and messaging us saying that they only
05:03 - have an ipad
05:04 - can they build ios apps on it and we
05:07 - have to say no
05:08 - unfortunately you need xcode and it's
05:10 - only available
05:11 - on mac machines and you know a mac is
05:14 - not
05:15 - cheap so a lot of the time that is a
05:18 - barrier to entry for a lot of people
05:20 - so what they showed here was that in the
05:23 - next iteration
05:24 - of swift playgrounds which i think i
05:27 - read that
05:28 - it should be available in the fall so
05:30 - it's not available right now
05:31 - but in the fall with swift playgrounds 4
05:34 - you'll be able to
05:35 - build apps within swift playgrounds
05:39 - and they they do a demo of this so
05:42 - just to do a quick run through all of
05:45 - the learning content is still
05:47 - in the app so you can still learn to
05:48 - code with that interactivity which is
05:52 - what the app is known for but you can
05:54 - also start a new
05:55 - swift playgrounds project and then you
05:58 - get a code editor that looks like this
06:00 - on the left hand side
06:01 - and you get a little preview on the
06:03 - right and the cool thing about this
06:05 - is that they also have code completion
06:08 - so you know you're typing i don't know
06:10 - if i can
06:12 - yeah so there there's that nice code
06:14 - completion
06:16 - you also have this uh this library
06:19 - button here where
06:20 - when you tap on that it brings up a
06:22 - library where you can add
06:24 - a ton of uh components
06:27 - here so you can add components you can
06:29 - search for modifiers you can search for
06:31 - sf symbols and
06:33 - this basically looks like the one from
06:35 - xcode right
06:37 - now no one has seen this app yet i have
06:40 - to assume that
06:42 - you know this is not full-fledged xcode
06:45 - on your ipad
06:47 - but i think that over time
06:50 - you know they're probably going to add
06:51 - more and more capabilities to this
06:53 - for right now i think this is an amazing
06:56 - step
06:57 - to transition from using this app to
06:59 - learning
07:00 - and then actually being able to uh apply
07:03 - it
07:04 - okay cool cool cool sorry let me just
07:07 - adjust my volume i just saw that chat
07:09 - message
07:11 - now if it gets too loud just let me know
07:15 - actually i can adjust it from here
07:23 - okay so i'm if it gets too loud if it is
07:27 - too loud just
07:28 - give me a chat message because right now
07:31 - i have this awesome second screen that i
07:33 - can see it's actually just an old
07:34 - monitor
07:35 - i pulled out of my closet okay
07:40 - so we're talking about this
07:43 - library panel here that you can drag and
07:46 - drop and you can
07:47 - sort of build your app like this uh
07:50 - you can also test your app you can run
07:52 - your app from within swift
07:54 - playgrounds so you can then
07:57 - test it out
08:04 - and there's a little console section at
08:05 - the bottom where you can see the output
08:07 - if you're testing different things like
08:09 - that and then finally you can actually
08:13 - distribute this if you have an apple
08:15 - developer account which is that paid
08:17 - membership
08:19 - you can ship your app to the app store
08:21 - uh and then you can
08:22 - log into the app store connect portal so
08:25 - sorry
08:26 - did i i meant app store connect so you
08:28 - can ship it to app store connect you can
08:29 - log into your portal and from there your
08:31 - build would be available
08:33 - to send to all your friends and family
08:35 - via test flight
08:36 - to try out your app so again this is
08:39 - really cool
08:40 - and i'm i have ipads
08:44 - i have kids so i definitely have ipads
08:46 - but they're really old and
08:48 - i think the older ipads are built like
08:50 - tanks because my ipads
08:52 - they are at least i don't know they're
08:55 - at least
08:56 - eight years old and they're still going
08:59 - i mean
09:00 - they can barely run any apps anymore um
09:03 - but again for the kids the only thing
09:05 - they need to be run is
09:06 - netflix and maybe youtube for kids
09:10 - and kudos to those teams for making
09:12 - those apps
09:14 - be able to run on such old devices
09:16 - because that's really not
09:18 - an easy thing to do but yeah i'm looking
09:22 - into getting a new ipad
09:23 - even though this app isn't available
09:26 - right now
09:27 - i mean version 4 where you can build
09:29 - apps
09:30 - because i i really predict that by the
09:33 - time
09:34 - it releases in the fall where you can
09:36 - build apps that
09:37 - it's going to bring a whole new audience
09:39 - of people
09:40 - probably especially younger people
09:43 - younger
09:44 - kids who've been learning coding on ipad
09:47 - and then you know now they can actually
09:48 - build
09:49 - apps on an ipad for for all those people
09:52 - that don't have macs i mean so
09:54 - i want to get an ipad now i want to
09:56 - start checking out this
09:57 - swift playgrounds app at least the
09:59 - learning content side of it
10:01 - and seeing if there's really a way for
10:03 - me to supplement that
10:05 - is there a way for me to to make it
10:08 - easier
10:09 - for people to learn with swift
10:11 - playgrounds
10:12 - using the already existing learning
10:14 - content and then
10:16 - by the time version 4 hits in the fall
10:19 - i'll be in a great spot to transition
10:21 - that
10:22 - to you know here's how you can build
10:24 - some cool apps
10:25 - using the swift playgrounds app so this
10:28 - is not going to take over my
10:30 - you know the main content that we do
10:32 - here uh using xcode but i think this is
10:35 - definitely
10:36 - uh something worth exploring
10:40 - okay so that was swift playgrounds
10:46 - i'm just
10:53 - all right just checking the chat uh the
10:56 - next thing they were talking about
10:57 - is augmented reality okay so here's an
10:59 - app that
11:00 - he was showing and this is like a full
11:02 - screen testing of his app
11:04 - on swift playgrounds that looks pretty
11:07 - cool
11:07 - i don't know you know how much of it is
11:09 - actually functional
11:10 - sort of remains to be seen how powerful
11:14 - of an app you can build on swift
11:16 - playgrounds
11:18 - really curious about that
11:26 - okay next up they talked about reality
11:28 - kit so i haven't worked
11:30 - very much with ar but i'm always super
11:33 - impressed by the
11:35 - augmented reality apps that i see um
11:39 - so she's talking about one of the big
11:42 - barriers
11:43 - to working with augmented reality is
11:46 - creating those 3d models either you have
11:49 - to buy them or download them
11:51 - or create them yourself if you know how
11:54 - to create these 3d models
11:57 - but in reality kit 2 they introduce
12:00 - something called
12:01 - object capture and this is a process
12:03 - where you turn
12:05 - a series of 2d images into a 3d
12:10 - model so what you do
12:13 - is this is another app that they're
12:15 - showing it's called the clone app
12:17 - i think this is the clone app because
12:18 - they mentioned it a bunch of times
12:20 - that it helps you capture a real life
12:23 - object and make sure that you get all
12:24 - the angles
12:26 - so you basically if you want to capture
12:28 - this croissant for example you use that
12:30 - app
12:31 - and then you sort of it's taking
12:33 - pictures as you're moving around that
12:35 - object
12:36 - and it sort of makes sure you can get
12:39 - all the angles of it
12:40 - uh and even underside so you have a
12:42 - completely
12:44 - you know you can look at it in any
12:45 - direction so then you take these series
12:48 - of images and you
12:49 - go into um you go into your mac
12:53 - and in swift you there's a couple of
12:56 - lines of code where you can turn those
12:58 - 2d images into a 3d model so
13:01 - this is this is what they showed i
13:04 - haven't actually done this myself
13:06 - but what you can generate from the
13:08 - series of 2d
13:09 - images is a usd
13:12 - zed model and this is a
13:17 - this is a model that is optimized for ar
13:20 - quick look
13:20 - so you can actually use this 3d model in
13:23 - messages mail safari and other apps
13:26 - so this to me this is sort of like i
13:28 - guess a lighter weight
13:29 - 3d model that you can send for previews
13:32 - and you can use in
13:33 - a bunch of applications but if you
13:35 - wanted to generate
13:37 - you know a maybe a heavier 3d model
13:42 - you can also export or generate obj and
13:45 - usd
13:46 - asset bundles to be used in like real
13:49 - production workflows
13:50 - so again this is sort of stuff that's
13:53 - really um
13:55 - i haven't touched before so this is
13:57 - really all new to me but
13:59 - um the
14:02 - the thought of being able to create your
14:04 - own 3d models easily
14:06 - really opens up the possibilities right
14:08 - even for
14:10 - people who don't typically work in 3d
14:13 - like myself do any of you guys
14:16 - have you guys played with uh ar
14:19 - augmented
14:20 - ar kit augmented reality reality kid
14:22 - have you guys tried any of that let me
14:24 - know
14:24 - in the chat
14:30 - okay and then the next section there
14:33 - they were talking about the metal
14:35 - framework
14:37 - and again i don't do anything super
14:40 - graphics intensive
14:41 - yeah so they're just showing this
14:43 - croissant
14:44 - that they captured uh
14:48 - okay so metal this part i'm
14:52 - honestly a little hazy about in terms of
14:54 - what they talked about
14:56 - for metal i can give you a summary
15:00 - but in terms of really intensive
15:02 - graphics work
15:04 - uh that is really not my area of
15:06 - expertise and there was a lot of jargon
15:08 - that i didn't really understand but
15:11 - the gist of what i got from this section
15:14 - was that uh because of the new apple m1
15:18 - chip
15:19 - um and uh the metal framework
15:23 - and their apple gpus and unified memory
15:26 - they've
15:26 - they've sort of uh melded all of that
15:29 - and created this
15:31 - uh harmonious
15:34 - working uh of all of these things to
15:38 - really improve graphics performance see
15:41 - i'm struggling to even put in my own
15:42 - words
15:44 - but they were talking about a lot of
15:45 - different graphics workflows like ray
15:47 - tracing
15:48 - and dynamic libraries and variable
15:52 - refresh rate displays and all these
15:54 - things
15:55 - that are now improved but i can't really
15:58 - tell you
16:00 - what it all means so if you work in
16:02 - graphics
16:03 - this section will probably be especially
16:05 - interesting to you
16:07 - i'd recommend that you check it out
16:10 - uh in terms of game development
16:14 - they now support more controllers like
16:16 - the latest xbox and ps5
16:18 - controllers so more support for
16:21 - controllers
16:22 - um there's talking about how you know
16:24 - their improved graphics performance can
16:27 - now
16:28 - better handle aaa console games on mac
16:31 - platforms um apple platforms i mean so
16:34 - that includes ios and ipad os and things
16:36 - like that
16:37 - so they're talking about all of this
16:39 - graphics jargon that
16:41 - flew over my head
16:45 - and then new graphics debugging tools
16:48 - and
16:48 - xcode so
16:53 - i'm just going to breeze over that
16:56 - because i
16:58 - don't know how to explain that but if
16:59 - you work in graphics again highly
17:01 - recommended that you check out this
17:03 - section
17:11 - okay let's talk about focus focus was a
17:13 - huge part of wwdc
17:16 - and uh sort of the whole
17:19 - idea here was that
17:22 - they want to make it easier for you to
17:24 - focus on your
17:26 - task and sometimes your phone is just a
17:28 - distraction
17:29 - right and i don't know about you guys do
17:31 - you guys keep your phone
17:32 - beside you when you work and do you
17:35 - leave it face
17:35 - up or do you leave it face down or do
17:38 - you move it out of the room
17:40 - do you put it on do not disturb
17:43 - so for me um i find that if it's right
17:47 - there beside my
17:48 - my desk i tend to just check it all the
17:52 - time
17:53 - when i get bored or maybe i have a break
17:54 - i grab my phone
17:56 - check what notifications do i have and
17:59 - that sort of thing
18:01 - um if you move it out of the room
18:04 - you're not gonna go run and check it
18:06 - right and then when you go to sleep is
18:08 - it
18:09 - at your bedside is it on your nightstand
18:12 - or is it somewhere else right
18:15 - so they you know i think it's really
18:18 - cool that apple does
18:20 - this it's trying to help you improve
18:21 - your life because if you think about it
18:24 - from their perspective they want you to
18:25 - be using their device
18:27 - all the time they want you to you know
18:29 - to just have it
18:30 - on your face but they implement all
18:32 - these mechanisms to actually
18:34 - um try to keep things in balance right
18:37 - like the screen time stuff that was
18:40 - that was new a couple of years ago
18:41 - before
18:43 - you didn't know how often you used your
18:45 - phone or for for how long
18:46 - you know all those little chunks those
18:48 - little segments throughout your day
18:49 - really add up
18:50 - right so them giving you that sort of
18:52 - feedback is amazing so you can
18:55 - you can then decide what to do so again
18:57 - i applaud apple for that
18:58 - so this this new focus mechanism
19:02 - is for you to uh basically
19:05 - set a do not disturb mode it's like a
19:08 - mode
19:09 - but you can customize it so do not
19:11 - disturb his blanket right
19:13 - like no notifications get through but
19:16 - with focus you can create your own
19:19 - modes that maybe you only want to let's
19:23 - certain apps through
19:25 - so you create like a work mode um
19:28 - so maybe only your co-workers can get
19:31 - through
19:31 - maybe only certain apps can get through
19:34 - and notify you whereas all the other
19:37 - apps you know
19:38 - their notifications get blocked um
19:41 - so again you can create custom focuses
19:44 - they call it
19:45 - which is really cool um a big focus for
19:49 - them was notifications because
19:53 - you know you get a ton of notifications
19:55 - through the day and there's
19:56 - no priority you know you can't tell
19:59 - which one's really important
20:00 - which one's not so important they just
20:02 - all show up in the same way
20:04 - so as a developer now when you are
20:07 - sending notifications
20:09 - from your app you have the ability to
20:11 - specify
20:12 - four different levels yeah four
20:15 - different levels of
20:16 - um urgency so passive
20:20 - means like your no notification uh
20:23 - isn't really time sensitive it's not
20:25 - that important the user will see it when
20:27 - they see it
20:28 - um so you said it as passive don't wake
20:31 - the device
20:32 - it's not time sensitive when they said
20:35 - that
20:35 - you know what the first thing i thought
20:37 - about is as an app developer
20:39 - wouldn't i want my app notifications
20:42 - always to be
20:44 - because i'm trying to get the user's
20:45 - attention right so when i always put it
20:48 - as the highest urgency like critical or
20:51 - something like that
20:52 - they didn't talk about how your app
20:54 - would be punished
20:55 - i don't think it it would be because
20:59 - what they're implying is that on the
21:01 - device there's some sort of intelligence
21:03 - right
21:04 - so if you keep marking your
21:06 - notifications as like critical
21:08 - when it shouldn't be and they sense that
21:11 - the user
21:12 - over time you know it's it's alerting
21:14 - the user but the user is not checking it
21:18 - that intelligence is just going to like
21:20 - downgrade your app
21:21 - automatically there's some sort of
21:23 - intelligence on the device that
21:26 - um that sort of tunes that
21:29 - okay so passive we talked about that
21:31 - active is basically your normal
21:33 - notification it plays a sound it plays a
21:36 - haptic
21:37 - if the user's phone is you know not on
21:40 - um
21:40 - not on do not disturb normal
21:42 - notification this is
21:43 - this is the one that all notifications
21:46 - are
21:46 - right now and then there's a more urgent
21:50 - one so if something is time sensitive i
21:52 - guess
21:53 - you know live stream is starting or like
21:56 - time is about to run out on something or
22:00 - whatever it is so this visually stands
22:03 - out more
22:03 - it stays on the screen longer and if the
22:06 - user is wearing air pods
22:07 - siri will actually announce it to them
22:10 - so
22:10 - i don't know how i feel about that i if
22:13 - the notification
22:14 - actually is time sensitive and it was
22:16 - relevant i would be like oh that's cool
22:18 - thank you but if it was you know not
22:22 - actually time sensitive i i would kind
22:24 - of be annoyed if i was listening to
22:26 - something
22:27 - or audiobook or music and and siri
22:30 - suddenly just
22:31 - interrupts and and gives me like a
22:33 - promotional message or something like
22:35 - that
22:36 - so i don't i don't know about that maybe
22:39 - maybe we'll see and again i think the
22:42 - intelligence would automatically
22:43 - downgrade your app if you're
22:46 - sending time-sensitive notifications
22:47 - that aren't actually time-sensitive
22:49 - and then critical is reserved for like
22:52 - serious health and safety
22:54 - concerns uh in ontario here where we
22:57 - live
22:57 - we get these things called amber alerts
22:59 - that the police sends out to all of our
23:01 - cellular devices when
23:03 - you know kids are abducted and and
23:05 - everyone should be on the lookout and
23:07 - these sort of just play a loud sound and
23:08 - they come on regardless
23:10 - of what what's happening on your phone
23:12 - so
23:13 - that's sort of what this is and it plays
23:15 - a sound even if your device is muted
23:18 - um this requires a separate entitlement
23:20 - which you need to get approval for
23:22 - so i i'm not sure when they said get
23:25 - approval i'm not sure if they said
23:26 - approval from apple or approval from the
23:28 - user so if any anyone knows that
23:30 - um please comment it in the chat
23:36 - okay and then notification summary this
23:38 - is
23:39 - uh where they batch up all of your
23:41 - notifications
23:42 - into and deliver it at one time so it's
23:45 - like almost
23:46 - like an email digest of the
23:50 - it's a summary essentially it bundles
23:52 - all your notifications
23:54 - delivers it at once now that summary
23:56 - actually has
23:57 - two it features two notifications very
24:01 - prominently
24:02 - let me show you what that looks like so
24:05 - it looks like this
24:06 - so that's what a bundle looks like and i
24:08 - think the user gets to choose what time
24:10 - these things get delivered
24:12 - um but you can see there's two
24:13 - notifications at the very top
24:15 - that are front and center and then the
24:18 - rest of them are just
24:19 - bundled down here now you as a developer
24:23 - to increase your chances of being
24:26 - selected because
24:27 - this is just handled by the ai or
24:29 - intelligence
24:31 - and they're only going to feature
24:33 - notifications
24:34 - which have a thumbnail so
24:37 - um yeah i didn't
24:41 - yeah so that notifications with
24:42 - thumbnails are considered for featuring
24:46 - and it it's based a little bit on
24:50 - from what i read or from what i heard
24:53 - it's based a little bit on
24:54 - what the user uses but at the same time
24:57 - it also selects a variety so it's not
25:00 - it's not going to have like two yelp
25:01 - ones or two espn ones
25:04 - uh in the bundle there may contain
25:07 - multiple
25:07 - notifications from your app so how do
25:10 - they
25:10 - order it right well now when you send a
25:14 - notification
25:15 - you can assign a relevancy score
25:18 - to your notification and based on that
25:21 - score
25:22 - it's going to order your notifications
25:25 - so if maybe
25:26 - you send multiple notifications
25:28 - throughout the day
25:31 - maybe you would assign the latest ones
25:35 - a higher score so they would be kind of
25:37 - ordered in that same
25:40 - uh in that same time sequence
25:44 - so that i have to do some testing on but
25:47 - that's what that is so we've talked
25:51 - about this do not disturb silence is all
25:53 - notifications
25:54 - and then you can set your own custom
25:56 - focus
25:57 - where people can still get through this
26:00 - and also
26:00 - um i don't know if you guys caught in
26:02 - wwdc that
26:04 - um different apps now especially the
26:08 - apple ones
26:09 - will tell other people that you are on
26:12 - do not disturb
26:14 - so if someone's trying to message you
26:17 - through the messages app
26:19 - they're gonna see that you have a status
26:22 - of do not disturb
26:23 - and then you can choose whether or not
26:24 - to still send it that actually happens
26:26 - on slack
26:27 - if any of you guys use slack if someone
26:30 - has do not disturb it still gives you an
26:32 - option to send
26:38 - so the app that you build you'll be able
26:41 - to get the user's current focus as well
26:44 - so you can sort of display that if if
26:47 - your app is a
26:48 - a communication app and that actually
26:50 - brings me back to one point so
26:52 - if your app deals with communication
26:54 - from people
26:55 - so if it's like an email or a messaging
26:58 - app or something like that
26:59 - um you should mark your notifications as
27:02 - communication between people because
27:04 - apple treats those notifications
27:06 - differently so let me see if i can give
27:09 - you guys a visual for that
27:14 - so just talking about ah so that's what
27:17 - this looks like
27:18 - so your notification will actually show
27:20 - that person's avatar
27:21 - or memoji and your app icon here and i
27:25 - actually don't know how they're going to
27:26 - get the user profile from from people
27:29 - maybe they have to be on your contact
27:30 - list for you to see
27:32 - something like that but you have to tell
27:35 - apple that your communication
27:36 - is from people rather than just your app
27:40 - trying to tell your users something
27:45 - okay let me just turn down the music a
27:47 - little bit guys
27:49 - since i hear some of you guys saying
28:00 - that
28:02 - okay hopefully is this better hopefully
28:05 - this is better
28:07 - um okay cool so
28:10 - screen time we talked about screen time
28:12 - a little earlier and that's
28:14 - um you know keeping track of which apps
28:17 - you use and for how long you stare at
28:18 - your screen how long
28:19 - you use each app for and parental
28:22 - controls which exist now
28:24 - and my my kids aren't old enough that
28:27 - where i have to implement parental
28:29 - controls
28:30 - because i can just take away their ipads
28:32 - that is my parental control
28:35 - but they have now exposed the screen
28:38 - time api so you can be building your own
28:41 - parental control apps for example
28:45 - maybe an app that encourages homework or
28:47 - something like that and
28:48 - it it locks your ipad
28:51 - at certain times but basically there's
28:54 - an api now
28:55 - where you can do those sorts of things
28:58 - so
28:58 - it is in three different parts let me
29:01 - just scroll to the
29:02 - relevant slide here
29:10 - he's talking about the screen time api
29:16 - all right so there's the homework app
29:18 - okay i can't really find a relevant
29:20 - slide here
29:21 - um so we'll leave it here okay
29:24 - so first let's talk about manage
29:28 - settings
29:29 - um this restricts what um
29:33 - your child can do across all their
29:34 - devices
29:36 - and you can set a number of restrictions
29:38 - it that could be like app-based
29:40 - or it could be time-based
29:44 - family controls is where
29:48 - it's for the parent to select which apps
29:51 - so this is the
29:52 - family control screen where you select
29:54 - you know what you want to allow your kid
29:56 - to access and what you want to prevent
29:59 - now the important thing is that because
30:02 - they want to encourage
30:03 - privacy they don't want your app
30:06 - to be able to see what the parent is
30:10 - choosing
30:11 - so for example if i'm the parent here
30:12 - and i'm choosing what apps
30:15 - i want them to be able to access
30:18 - or not access your app
30:22 - is not going to know these names it's
30:24 - going to be tokenized so it's going to
30:25 - turn into like a random string of
30:27 - letters and numbers
30:28 - and you're just going to have to work
30:30 - with that token uh
30:32 - you can still you know pass that token
30:34 - around to do things
30:35 - such as restrict access to that app or
30:38 - enable access to that app but you won't
30:40 - know what that app
30:41 - is or you won't know what that activity
30:44 - is they call these things activities
30:45 - because
30:46 - it could it doesn't have to be an app it
30:48 - could be you know visiting
30:50 - certain websites and things like that
30:57 - uh the the last part of this parental
30:59 - controls
31:00 - or screen time api is device activity so
31:03 - this is a new api where your app
31:05 - can register um windows of time
31:09 - where certain things are allowed or not
31:11 - allowed
31:12 - so you kind of have control to lock down
31:14 - the device
31:15 - through this api
31:19 - i'm sure the kids are not happy about
31:21 - this
31:23 - and it'll be interesting to see what
31:25 - sort of parental control
31:26 - type of apps appear on the app store
31:29 - because this is
31:30 - this is new that we can do all of this
31:32 - on a device
31:36 - i'm not happy yeah
31:46 - yeah zach talking about the
31:47 - notifications it wouldn't pass review i
31:49 - think
31:50 - um but they the reviewers might not
31:52 - catch it
31:53 - to be honest you know it's it's so hard
31:57 - what they that review team has to do and
32:00 - i really don't know how they can
32:02 - make sure that um your app is clean and
32:06 - not fraudulent and that's why so many
32:08 - like fraudulent apps still get through
32:11 - so i'm just gonna move my mic closer
32:12 - maybe that'll actually help
32:14 - away from my speakers
32:17 - okay no we're getting to the end here
32:20 - actually really excited about share play
32:22 - i'll tell you why in a second okay so we
32:28 - talked about widgets
32:29 - right now you can create widgets i've
32:31 - actually never created one have you any
32:33 - of you
32:34 - looked into creating widgets or have
32:36 - created widgets yourself
32:37 - for your own apps
32:42 - turn this down
32:47 - um so now what's new is that there is a
32:50 - larger widget size because of
32:52 - ipad because they brought widgets to
32:54 - ipad
32:55 - so there is a giant one and this
32:58 - jumbo one here uh so they're just
33:01 - talking about that and how you can
33:03 - create super sized widgets now
33:11 - uh the other thing that they talked
33:13 - about this
33:14 - intense so you know widgets are based on
33:19 - someone putting your app's widget
33:22 - on their screen right so if they never
33:25 - do that
33:25 - then your app never gets the chance to
33:27 - really show up as one
33:29 - so it's very user driven right like they
33:31 - have to add your widget
33:32 - to the screen but they're saying now
33:35 - that
33:36 - they have certain things called widget
33:37 - stacks and if you have um
33:40 - an iphone you might have seen this where
33:42 - it's like a single widget but you can
33:44 - swipe
33:44 - up and down through it to display like
33:46 - different views
33:47 - in that single widget so in here
33:51 - they're saying that depending on
33:55 - you know what patterns they notice about
33:57 - the user that intelligence
33:59 - on the device may suggest your app
34:03 - to display something now your app has to
34:07 - give some information for it to actually
34:09 - display in that widget
34:11 - so they call this the intense api
34:15 - so it allows your app to suggest
34:17 - information
34:18 - so in here in this article they're
34:20 - suggesting that your smoothie app
34:23 - um sends this intent
34:26 - to order this at this time maybe because
34:29 - it notices
34:30 - that the user does this or maybe there's
34:32 - like a special sale
34:34 - or something like that about that and
34:36 - then the os will determine
34:37 - if they want to take that information
34:40 - and recommend it
34:41 - and show it in that widget stack so
34:44 - there's an
34:44 - there's a chance for your app to
34:48 - display some information in that widget
34:50 - stack even though
34:53 - your app's widget is not actually there
34:57 - so that's pretty cool
35:02 - and then we get to the last announcement
35:04 - which is share play
35:06 - so this is they started off wwdc talking
35:09 - about share play and facetime
35:11 - and this is if you missed that this is
35:14 - essentially where
35:16 - you can get on you know a group facetime
35:20 - and you can all together watch like a
35:22 - movie or listen to a song
35:24 - all in sync
35:28 - and us developers we can sort of take
35:30 - advantage of that
35:32 - sorry i don't mean take advantage of it
35:34 - but i mean use it
35:36 - so doing you know syncing media
35:39 - between people the code that they showed
35:42 - it's pretty simple to do
35:43 - but it's not limited to just syncing
35:46 - media
35:46 - across across multiple people
35:53 - one thing i want to mention is that
35:59 - the cool thing is like
36:02 - let's say you're watching a movie uh and
36:04 - you want to share play it with your
36:06 - group
36:08 - um what happens is
36:12 - when those people join your group
36:14 - activity to watch that movie
36:17 - um their movie plays in sync but it's
36:20 - not
36:21 - um they're you're not streaming your
36:23 - movie to them
36:24 - like they're actually watching like
36:27 - their device
36:28 - is doing the heavy lifting there is just
36:30 - a sink
36:31 - in terms of you know the the time stamp
36:35 - or whatever it is to keep it in sync but
36:37 - it's not like right now this stream
36:39 - right it's my computer
36:41 - sending the data um which is then coming
36:44 - to all of you guys
36:45 - where whereas the way that they have
36:48 - um they describe it here is that you
36:50 - know their own devices are playing the
36:52 - movies there's just
36:53 - a layer keeping things in sync
36:58 - so that is like syncing media playback
37:00 - but there's
37:01 - also a way to use apple's
37:05 - servers as a host so that you can
37:08 - do other group activities so what they
37:11 - show here
37:13 - is they show a bunch of people getting
37:15 - together they show some code on how to
37:17 - do the media sync it seems
37:19 - seems relatively uh not too complicated
37:23 - but in here they're showing an app where
37:26 - multiple people are drawing on the
37:28 - screen
37:33 - and what's happening here is that
37:38 - you know when you you're writing your
37:40 - handwriting
37:42 - it's not like you're sending your data
37:45 - um to their screen and then you know
37:48 - they're seeing what you're seeing it's
37:50 - not like a screen share type of thing
37:52 - it's that their device is actually
37:54 - receiving data about what you did
37:56 - and it's actually uh rendering that
37:59 - itself like it's strong
38:00 - it's devices drawing that out itself
38:03 - so there's a difference there because
38:04 - you're not just like sharing your screen
38:09 - and the thing that i find really
38:10 - exciting about this um
38:12 - is because it sort of relates to an app
38:14 - idea that i've had for
38:16 - a little while and if you go back to
38:18 - some of the very first live streams i
38:20 - did
38:20 - i don't know like four or five years ago
38:22 - i wanted to do like a social pomodoro
38:24 - app
38:25 - and now that i'm doing sort of live
38:27 - stream study with me's
38:28 - that idea sort of popped up in my head
38:30 - again but
38:32 - i thought it'd be so cool uh for all of
38:35 - us to be able to join
38:37 - like a pomodoro room if you guys are not
38:40 - familiar with the pomodoro technique
38:42 - it's just it's just a
38:44 - technique to do like a block of work and
38:47 - then like a little bit rest and then
38:48 - another block of work and sort of keeps
38:50 - you
38:51 - motivated and it keeps things in small
38:53 - chunks for you to do
38:55 - so i know apps exist out there already
38:57 - where you can sort of do group
38:59 - pomodoros but i wanted to incorporate
39:02 - some gamification into it and stuff like
39:04 - that so
39:05 - seeing this group activities framework
39:08 - makes me think that maybe i can use it
39:11 - for that app idea
39:13 - maybe so
39:16 - that is the end of their presentation
39:21 - i would encourage you to check it out
39:24 - i'll also be sharing my notes
39:26 - posted as a blog post on my website and
39:29 - i'll just
39:30 - send out the link through social media
39:33 - if you guys are interested in that but
39:35 - aside from that there are a ton of wwdc
39:38 - sessions which i haven't even started
39:40 - watching yet because yesterday
39:42 - i didn't have any time to to do that
39:46 - but did you guys bookmark any sessions
39:50 - are you guys going to watch any of these
39:52 - they're actually not bad because i
39:54 - thought most of them would be like an
39:56 - hour long but some of them
39:57 - like this one 16 minutes
40:05 - i had
40:22 - so i know some other creators have been
40:25 - streaming recently too
40:26 - so um i know paul hudson did
40:29 - one on uh what's new in swift so
40:32 - definitely go and check that out
40:36 - i don't know if sean allen did uh this
40:38 - did a stream i think he
40:39 - he did as well so it's so awesome that
40:44 - um
40:51 - yeah hey ed if you go into my channel
40:54 - youtube.comcodewithchris
40:55 - you'll find my beginner playlist
41:13 - yeah it's at the very top
41:19 - so what do you guys think just in
41:20 - general about
41:22 - what they announced at wwdc i know a lot
41:24 - of people were expecting hardware
41:26 - announcements
41:27 - a lot of you expressed disappointment on
41:29 - that first day on monday
41:31 - um but aside from that you know in terms
41:34 - of what they announced
41:35 - does anything in particular excite you
41:37 - guys any apis that you're thinking about
41:40 - using yourself
41:44 - and sort of where are you in your ios
41:46 - journey are you just starting out
41:48 - or are you in a great position to take
41:50 - advantage of
41:51 - you know some of these things because i
41:53 - know a lot of these topics
41:55 - that we've covered here are not exactly
41:58 - beginner friendly
42:00 - but i think it's still a very exciting
42:03 - time
42:04 - um because there's you know continuing
42:06 - to improve swift ui
42:08 - uh make and this is so much easier to
42:11 - pick up than
42:12 - ui kit was for beginners i've heard that
42:14 - time and time again
42:16 - in fact we we licensed our
42:20 - foundations course into a classroom and
42:23 - that
42:24 - they used that swift ui curriculum for
42:26 - their semester
42:27 - and at the end of the semester i got a
42:29 - chance to appear
42:31 - you know through zoom to their classroom
42:33 - and do sort of like a meet and greet and
42:35 - q a
42:36 - and you know i got some feedback from
42:39 - them and listening to
42:40 - how it was like for them going through
42:42 - that swift ui course
42:44 - and a lot of people found it it was a
42:47 - lot easier to learn
42:48 - you're not wrestling wrestling with ib
42:50 - outlets storyboards and stuff like that
42:53 - so i think swift ui uh is
42:56 - such a great step um especially from
43:00 - from my perspective coming as a as an
43:03 - educator
43:04 - and with swift playgrounds right making
43:07 - just building apps more accessible to
43:10 - everyone and lowering the barrier of
43:12 - entry
43:13 - that's that's only a good thing right
43:14 - because
43:18 - um you know maybe it's hard to justify
43:21 - investing in a mac up front if you don't
43:23 - even know
43:24 - if this is something that you're going
43:26 - to pursue that you like or not
43:29 - but swift playgrounds if you have an
43:30 - ipad already right you can just
43:32 - test things out and then when you decide
43:34 - to get more serious into it
43:36 - if you can't you know the swift
43:39 - playgrounds app is sort of lacking
43:41 - then you can be more confident in
43:43 - investing in
43:44 - maybe an older mac or a refurbished mac
43:49 - in fact this mac that i i bought this is
43:52 - a mid
43:53 - 2015 imac the retina 5k one and i bought
43:56 - it refurbished and it's
43:57 - it's been like amazing all this time
44:02 - no problems so i usually look at the
44:04 - refurbished stuff first but
44:06 - now that i'm looking at these new macs
44:08 - that came out now that
44:10 - my computer is straining more because
44:12 - i'm starting to stream
44:14 - uh maybe i will invest in a new mac
44:18 - that's a lot of money though because
44:19 - we're talking about what ipads
44:22 - i haven't gotten a new iphone for a long
44:24 - time though
44:26 - my iphones usually last me about four
44:28 - years
44:31 - and this mac has has been
44:35 - about four to five years
44:44 - yeah zach did you sign up for the xcode
44:46 - cloud
44:48 - beta wait list i wonder how many people
44:51 - they're going to allow
44:52 - into that my guess is that they're going
44:55 - to allow
44:56 - you know larger companies in first
44:58 - because they're probably going to be
45:00 - able to stress test it the most
45:02 - and give apple feedback for you know
45:04 - single developers and
45:07 - i don't know if we'll get to us
45:10 - but i did register for the wait list
45:12 - with our
45:14 - code with chris like company accounts so
45:17 - maybe they will accept us thinking that
45:19 - we have
45:20 - tons and tons of developers whereas we
45:30 - don't
45:33 - uh lordison you got confused with
45:36 - staying in javascript react native
45:38 - course or jump back to swift really
45:40 - liked
45:40 - for native um i think at the beginning
45:43 - it's
45:44 - it's really important to sort of stick
45:47 - with something
45:48 - at least get deep into into it enough so
45:51 - that
45:52 - you have a grasp of it before jumping
45:54 - around because
45:56 - you're not going to make any progress
45:57 - you're essentially going back to square
45:58 - one when you jump into a different thing
46:00 - right
46:01 - so my advice to you
46:04 - if if you don't have an alt if you don't
46:08 - have
46:08 - like um exterior mode of driving you
46:10 - like maybe you have to learn it for a
46:12 - school a course in school or like maybe
46:15 - your employer is asking you to learn
46:17 - that
46:17 - if you don't have a motive like that
46:19 - then i would definitely go with
46:21 - what you're interested in because that
46:23 - interest and that passion
46:25 - flows through and you're going to find
46:27 - that you're you're going to spend your
46:28 - evenings and free time
46:30 - learning about this stuff and digging
46:32 - into it
46:35 - it's just going to be a lot easier it's
46:37 - if it's something that you don't really
46:38 - want to do but you feel like you should
46:40 - do
46:41 - like maybe working out staying
46:44 - fit eating healthy you know those are
46:47 - usually the things that
46:49 - um people know they should be doing but
46:51 - it's hard to do and
46:53 - it's not until you make a lifestyle
46:55 - change
46:56 - that it really happens
47:01 - um i haven't made that lifestyle change
47:03 - yet
47:08 - oh is that cool you had a corporate
47:09 - account too for your work i assume
47:11 - or
47:15 - maybe you have your own business oh mark
47:18 - you're using a 2015 as well
47:22 - cool yeah it's amazing how
47:25 - how well these machines hold up i
47:27 - remember when i was using a pc
47:29 - um for some reason they'd get
47:32 - really slow really fast um but
47:36 - these macs max are pretty good
47:47 - ah that is just your beta machine nice
47:50 - nice you know i have another machine too
47:53 - so this is my
47:54 - um at the same time i bought this 5k
47:56 - retina mac
47:57 - imac i mean i also bought a macbook pro
48:01 - um and i my intention was to leave this
48:05 - because at that time i had a separate
48:06 - office we had rented a little office and
48:08 - i was going to leave this imac there
48:10 - i was like okay i'm going to leave work
48:12 - at work when i come home
48:14 - you know i have my laptop for non-work
48:17 - purposes
48:19 - um but didn't really turn out that way
48:23 - but now my macbook is being used by
48:27 - my four-year-old daughter because of
48:30 - online schooling
48:33 - so she's basically beaten
48:36 - the crap out of that macbook and
48:39 - because she's got the speakers on full
48:41 - blast you know all day for the classroom
48:44 - she's she has you know greasy fingers
48:47 - from eating snacks
48:48 - on the keyboard and she took crayon to
48:51 - my screen
48:52 - i see crayon marks on my laptop screen
48:56 - so now the left speaker is blown out so
49:00 - anyways anyways it's an old it's an old
49:04 - laptop anyways and
49:05 - education comes first right
49:13 - uh bargain are you ref are you referring
49:15 - to me i haven't
49:16 - installed any of the betas yet um
49:20 - yeah it's just been a busy couple of
49:21 - days so i haven't done that
49:23 - oh is that cool cool that's awesome so
49:26 - hopefully
49:26 - good luck with the wait list maybe
49:29 - you'll get into the xcode beta if you do
49:31 - please let us know let us know how it is
49:38 - did you always start off as uh did you
49:40 - transition from sort of like a full-time
49:42 - corporate job into
49:43 - becoming an independent contractor did
49:46 - you make that shift or did you start out
49:48 - just doing contracting contract work
49:52 - this is why you can't have nice things
49:53 - mark yeah
49:55 - i remember when we were just having kids
49:59 - we we wanted this really nice white
50:03 - uh couch from pottery barn
50:07 - was it called pb comfort i forget what
50:09 - it was called
50:10 - but you know like pottery barn furniture
50:12 - isn't it
50:13 - isn't cheap and uh luckily we had the
50:16 - foresight
50:17 - to to not do that and instead just buy
50:21 - things buy cheaper things that we knew
50:24 - would just get ruined and we wouldn't
50:25 - get heartbroken over
50:27 - and so that has been like a super smart
50:29 - decision
50:31 - so there's no way we're keeping a white
50:33 - couch
50:35 - free from kids fingers and stuff like
50:38 - that
50:44 - wow zack super impressive third
50:46 - generation computer engineer
50:48 - so you you must have grown up like what
50:51 - was your childhood like um
50:54 - were you exposed to
50:58 - engineering and you know circuitry stuff
51:02 - like that i don't know what
51:04 - computer engineering yeah you must have
51:06 - been exposed to that stuff when you're
51:07 - really young
51:09 - and that's one one thing i'm thinking
51:10 - about for my kids my kids are four and
51:12 - six
51:13 - and uh they're learning actually the
51:15 - older kid
51:16 - six years old she's learning um what is
51:19 - it
51:19 - scratch now in school it's
51:22 - pretty cool pretty cool so they're like
51:24 - dragging these little jigsaw blocks to
51:27 - uh make sequences right so they're
51:30 - recording their own
51:31 - audio into the program uh
51:34 - and each audio bite is like a little
51:37 - jigsaw block
51:38 - and then they can visually uh and then
51:41 - she's also
51:43 - drawing images as well and they're
51:45 - basically assembling stories
51:48 - using these little jigsaw audio blocks
51:50 - with
51:51 - the um with the images that she's drawn
51:54 - on the screen
51:55 - and then she has to you know program the
51:58 - transitions and when the audios plays
52:00 - and she can like repeat certain audio
52:02 - clips and it was really funny
52:04 - for her to uh when i was watching her
52:07 - uh seeing her uh accidentally
52:11 - uh put an audio clip on repeat
52:14 - and when she played it it just like kept
52:17 - repeating and she
52:18 - started freaking out she's like ah
52:19 - what's going on that was really cool to
52:21 - see
52:22 - but yeah i didn't know that they started
52:25 - so early now
52:29 - yeah zach the wallpapers are nice
52:36 - wow super impressive guys
52:41 - yeah i only started programming or you
52:44 - know i only realized
52:46 - that was something that you could do in
52:48 - grade
52:49 - 10 for me in grade 10
52:52 - and i sort of just fell in love with it
52:54 - right away
52:58 - and we learned this language called
52:59 - turing
53:04 - it's a it was invented by someone in the
53:07 - university of
53:12 - toronto
53:15 - awesome awesome yeah it's sort of
53:19 - a really cool feeling for me because i
53:22 - was exposed to programming in school and
53:24 - that's how i
53:24 - went down this path and then seeing
53:28 - you know seeing teachers saying that
53:29 - they're using some of my youtube stuff
53:32 - to supplement their lessons or uh you
53:34 - know some classrooms are using our
53:36 - courses in their classrooms
53:37 - uh really sort of brings it full circle
53:40 - for me and it's like this really great
53:42 - feeling
53:42 - it sort of um completes things and
53:46 - really drives me forward for this i'm so
53:49 - lucky
53:50 - to be honest i'm really really grateful
53:53 - that i can do this
53:55 - as my full-time job um
54:00 - yeah so i mean one downside to this
54:03 - though i'll tell you guys right now is
54:06 - that
54:07 - because i've been doing this since 2013
54:10 - and
54:11 - you know in 2013 when i left my
54:13 - corporate job
54:14 - and started doing this i really knew my
54:17 - stuff
54:18 - right because i was working on this
54:20 - eight hours a day
54:22 - um and then over time because
54:26 - i just wasn't like i was more focused
54:30 - on building code with chris as a brand
54:32 - and as a business
54:34 - than i was coding and developing my
54:36 - coding skills
54:38 - that that balance
54:41 - sort of shifted right so on one hand
54:45 - where i did sort of i was able to make
54:48 - this
54:49 - my full-time gig but on the other hand
54:51 - my coding skills
54:52 - started going down because i wasn't
54:54 - using them as much as i used to
54:57 - so um now
55:01 - and it was really hard because as the
55:04 - business grew there was just more to do
55:06 - right and i love learning about things i
55:09 - love learning about
55:10 - uh you know marketing and business
55:13 - development and all those things and
55:16 - those are all skills and um areas which
55:20 - have their
55:21 - own degrees and programs right so you
55:24 - you get a sense of how deep it goes
55:26 - and when you're starting your own thing
55:27 - you're the only person
55:31 - so i was going down these rabbit holes
55:33 - learning a lot and i was having a lot of
55:35 - fun
55:35 - but i it just wasn't you know coding
55:40 - um so now you know after so many years
55:44 - we've gotten to a point where
55:46 - luckily we we do have more people
55:48 - helping with
55:49 - code with chris now so
55:52 - i i can be more removed from doing every
55:56 - single thing
55:57 - and i can be streaming with you guys and
55:59 - interacting with you guys here
56:01 - and that's amazing to me right and
56:05 - you know i have this renewed interest in
56:07 - wanting to
56:11 - learn and study and code and that's why
56:14 - i want to do these
56:15 - study sessions on stream to keep myself
56:17 - accountable as well
56:18 - as well as i know for other people it's
56:20 - motivation right to get together and do
56:22 - something
56:23 - social and code together because
56:26 - sometimes it's just lonely
56:27 - at night wanting to you know go and code
56:30 - by yourself uh if it's not something
56:33 - like you super really want to do
56:36 - so i have this renewed interest in
56:38 - wanting to learn and upgrade my skills
56:41 - but another thing is that something that
56:44 - i've never done
56:45 - is build my own apps to try to
56:50 - gain traction and build a big user base
56:52 - and to monetize them
56:54 - because in my full-time job we built
56:56 - apps for clients
56:58 - so we were a consulting company and
57:00 - these clients were usually
57:02 - you know big media companies uh
57:04 - broadcasting companies that just wanted
57:06 - an app to you know as a different
57:10 - distribution channel for their content
57:12 - so they didn't really care you know if
57:14 - it made money or not to them it was just
57:16 - another distribution channel
57:17 - and plus we were always only
57:21 - in charge of the development of it we
57:23 - weren't in charge of the
57:24 - you know marketing side or anything like
57:27 - that or user acquisition side or growth
57:29 - or anything like that
57:30 - so um and because i was coding so much
57:34 - and we would have to you know sometimes
57:38 - pull like really late hours especially
57:40 - close to crunch time the deadline
57:42 - um we would be going in in the morning
57:45 - and staying till
57:46 - you know like 10 sometimes like i've
57:48 - i've left in the ams
57:50 - and then i'd have to show up the next
57:52 - day to uh
57:54 - you know at 9am again and you can only
57:57 - do that for so long that was one of the
57:58 - reasons i sort of burnt out but anyways
58:01 - because it was so tough i i really
58:03 - wasn't interested
58:04 - in coding for myself and building my own
58:06 - apps and exploring that
58:09 - um and then when code with chris started
58:12 - in the back of my head i was sort of
58:13 - like oh i need to have my own apps
58:15 - because i need credibility and authority
58:19 - and and who would want to learn from
58:20 - someone who didn't have their own apps
58:22 - and that was sort of the mindset i was
58:23 - in right
58:27 - so but again i was so busy with just
58:30 - building the business that i wasn't
58:32 - building my own apps and so now i've
58:34 - gotten to a point where
58:36 - i do want to build my own apps and i do
58:38 - want to explore
58:39 - this this art of growth and
58:42 - user acquisition because i think it's
58:45 - it's not that easy anymore
58:47 - right the app store is so crowded um
58:50 - a lot of the apps are dominated by
58:52 - bigger companies indie developers i mean
58:54 - they still have
58:55 - they still have opportunities but i
58:57 - think you have to be pretty smart about
58:59 - it there's definitely
59:00 - a business and marketing side to app
59:03 - like building your own successful apps
59:05 - now you can't just
59:07 - no coding and that's it
59:10 - sorry i went off on a big tangent
59:15 - do you guys do any of you guys have your
59:17 - own apps in the app store
59:19 - um i mean you guys probably have if you
59:22 - do you have more experience than me
59:23 - about
59:24 - user acquisition and how to how to get
59:30 - users
59:35 - zach it sounds like yeah um
59:37 - [Music]
59:39 - you could probably explain this part
59:41 - better than i can
59:43 - you know we were talking about the
59:44 - unified metal graphics platform
59:48 - because all of this during the platform
59:50 - state of union was sort of gibberish to
59:52 - me i'm like how does though
59:54 - i don't know if you do like graphics
59:57 - rendering and you do
59:58 - you know game development i'm sure i'm
60:00 - sure this is all
60:01 - you know very interesting news to you
60:20 - awesome you got to show us some of the
60:22 - do you have a link to
60:24 - to anything you want to show us zack
60:30 - bargain this is a great question that's
60:33 - a great question
60:34 - uh number one is that the app um
60:38 - because when it was developed and we
60:39 - published it in the app store
60:41 - we were featuring our ui kit content so
60:44 - we had a
60:44 - like a 30 day beginner series on
60:48 - youtube and
60:51 - you know at that time we were busy with
60:53 - something or another and
60:55 - we're just like okay we're gonna update
60:57 - it with the swift oh we were busy
60:59 - developing swift ui content
61:03 - yeah we're busy developing this stuff
61:05 - let me bring this on screen
61:09 - we were busy developing this new series
61:12 - transitioning from ui kit to swift ui
61:16 - and so we didn't want to promote that
61:18 - because everyone would be
61:19 - you know digging into the ui kit stuff
61:23 - whereas now we're like trying to
61:24 - transition this with ui
61:26 - so we were gonna update that app with
61:28 - the swift ui content instead and then
61:31 - do the big announcement in the big push
61:34 - um but then now we're at this point
61:36 - where we are
61:38 - rebuilding a cwc app that is
61:40 - multi-platform that can connect to our
61:42 - learning platform
61:44 - so people can download videos offline
61:46 - for offline viewing and stuff like that
61:48 - so that
61:49 - should um maybe in the next three months
61:52 - or so
61:53 - that we're trying to release that and
61:54 - that will sort of replace that app that
61:56 - you see in the
61:57 - app store it's a great question
62:05 - thank you sergio appreciate it um
62:09 - yeah like aside from my material there's
62:10 - tons of content creators
62:12 - uh nowadays that are also sharing
62:16 - uh sharing their knowledge and helping
62:18 - people out at night you know that's
62:20 - that's so awesome to see check out the
62:24 - uh
62:24 - the subreddits for swift programming and
62:28 - swift ui a lot of content creators are
62:30 - are posting their stuff there
62:40 - ah flow yes if flow is here if he's
62:46 - flow is also teaching and he's an active
62:50 - member of our
62:51 - community and definitely check out his
62:54 - content
62:54 - he teaches at boot camps live boot camps
62:58 - so his experience really is really
63:01 - battle
63:02 - tested so definitely check out his
63:04 - content right here
63:07 - um let's see what else so sean allen i
63:10 - think goes without saying
63:11 - you guys probably have all seen him
63:14 - let's see uh
63:18 - he didn't do a live stream but
63:21 - design code mengto and his team
63:25 - really cool speaking of uh design
63:27 - actually
63:29 - before we get to that um i think bengto
63:32 - is a great resource
63:33 - for for learning design especially as a
63:35 - developer if you need to just
63:37 - know you know enough to to make your app
63:40 - look good you don't need
63:42 - to become a full-fledged designer he has
63:44 - a lot of great content
63:45 - on on doing that and just from like
63:47 - watching his workflow
63:50 - um but yeah in terms of design
63:53 - we actually hired a designer on our team
63:56 - recently so i'm really excited to to
63:58 - work with him he's actually the one
64:00 - that's going to be
64:01 - teaching a large chunk of our um
64:05 - and here i'm going to do a uh sort of a
64:07 - shout out
64:08 - or what do you call it
64:13 - not a shout out a plug to my own program
64:16 - uh but we have a design course that
64:17 - we're working on here
64:20 - and he's going to be teaching a large
64:21 - part of it so
64:24 - i'm going to be teaching the
64:25 - implementation part of it
64:27 - he's going to be teaching the actual
64:28 - like design in figma
64:30 - part of it and so then we're going to
64:32 - meld their two parts together
64:33 - that should be pretty cool and then in
64:34 - the future he's going to work with me
64:36 - on content for the youtube channel and
64:39 - content for our demos
64:41 - so hopefully all you know all of my
64:44 - demos and apps are going to look much
64:46 - better
64:47 - when you guys go to build it
64:54 - yeah appmasters steve steve is great
64:58 - i'm going to be learning a lot from
64:59 - steve especially
65:01 - you know for the app marketing user
65:03 - acquisition side
65:07 - the problem um i'm a little bit
65:10 - intimidated because he has so much
65:12 - content
65:13 - like a lot of content and his main
65:16 - channel isn't on youtube
65:19 - right his main thing is on podcast and
65:22 - he has hundreds of podcast episodes
65:25 - so it's impossible to go through go
65:28 - through all of them
65:29 - but yeah definitely a great guy sharing
65:31 - a lot of what he knows
65:33 - you know the thing with the app store is
65:35 - it's so dynamic things are changing
65:37 - all the time so now that i think of it
65:41 - what
65:41 - used to work may not be working now
65:45 - so he actually has a
65:49 - agency that helps people market apps and
65:52 - actually that's where the knowledge
65:53 - really comes from
65:54 - those little little tweaks and little
65:56 - hacks
65:57 - um it's it's battle tested
66:01 - right because he does it for clients so
66:03 - that he can share it
66:05 - [Music]
66:07 - and it's really cool that he does share
66:08 - it because i mean in a way
66:10 - if you expose your techniques
66:14 - that you use for working with clients it
66:16 - becomes more widely used
66:18 - then that might not work anymore apple
66:19 - might patch it up you know because
66:21 - before
66:22 - i know there was a technique that he
66:24 - told me where
66:27 - i think you could you know you only have
66:29 - so much space
66:30 - to put keywords and your titles and
66:33 - stuff like that
66:34 - but he found out with his clients that
66:37 - you can use
66:39 - um like the titles and keyword fields
66:43 - for
66:44 - a couple of other countries and you can
66:46 - specify
66:47 - you know english words there and they
66:49 - sort of apply
66:50 - to the app store ranking as well so
66:54 - you're sort of getting you know it's
66:56 - like a cheat code you're
66:57 - you're getting uh advantage over other
67:00 - people who are only using the
67:01 - the english fields for keywords and
67:04 - descriptions
67:05 - or something like that i don't remember
67:06 - exactly what it was but it's all these
67:08 - little like tweaks and these little
67:09 - hacks that
67:10 - you only notice from actually doing it
67:13 - right and he has that through his agency
67:25 - hey ts thanks for joining
67:29 - all right guys i think i'm going to call
67:30 - it a day for the stream
67:33 - but i will be back streaming again
67:35 - tomorrow
67:36 - at 10 30. i haven't thought about what
67:38 - we're going to do yet
67:39 - if if i don't have a topic then we're
67:42 - just gonna
67:44 - i'm probably just gonna turn off the mic
67:46 - and i'm just gonna do some coding
67:48 - um i might not show my screen maybe i
67:50 - will maybe i won't
67:51 - but uh come join anyways through the
67:54 - chat we'll chat
67:55 - we'll code together take that time
67:58 - as a meeting time in your calendar
68:02 - for you to do some learning and studying
68:04 - and coding to be honest i will probably
68:06 - spend that time watching wwdc sessions
68:10 - and that's going to give me um
68:14 - yeah it's about time and catch up
68:15 - because i'm i'm already a day late
68:18 - and there are so many sessions that i
68:19 - bookmarked and every day they're coming
68:21 - out with like a ton of new sessions
68:23 - right so i have
68:24 - in my bookmarks i'll just show you guys
68:26 - some of the stuff that i'm interested in
68:30 - um yeah these are not out yet this one's
68:33 - not oh yeah the design awards
68:34 - this is always really interesting to see
68:37 - so there's the async await stuff that we
68:39 - went through
68:40 - the practicing inclusive design i have a
68:42 - huge interest in
68:43 - you know how to design really cool apps
68:46 - really beautiful apps that
68:49 - have great user experiences so obviously
68:51 - a lot of the what's new in swift ui
68:53 - what's new in swift
68:57 - mac catalyst
69:03 - in-app purchases a lot of the debugging
69:05 - stuff i want to
69:06 - get better at detecting and diagnosing
69:09 - memory issues
69:10 - i remember working in objective c back
69:12 - in the day
69:15 - used to be not really fun trying to
69:17 - figure out but you know what being
69:20 - you know having to manage your own
69:22 - memory actually gave me a really good
69:24 - understanding of how things work under
69:26 - the hood so now
69:27 - you know with swift and swift ui and
69:30 - stuff that
69:30 - that that's a little bit abstracted
69:35 - right and if you're just coming into
69:36 - learning
69:38 - you probably don't know what's happening
69:41 - under the hood things like reference
69:43 - counting
69:43 - and and all of that stuff um so it might
69:47 - you know when you're trying to debug a
69:48 - memory leak it might be harder for you
69:50 - because
69:51 - those things haven't been exposed to you
69:56 - group activities this is this is a cool
69:59 - one
70:00 - yeah see i imagine building this like
70:02 - group pomodoro thing where we can
70:04 - actually use it together here on these
70:06 - streams
70:07 - um so we can sort of set a timer and
70:09 - have a timer on the screen and then
70:11 - when the work timer is on we're all
70:13 - coding and doing our own thing and
70:14 - studying
70:15 - and learning and when we take a break
70:16 - we'll do some fun things
70:18 - we'll do some fun games with this stream
70:22 - labs
70:22 - software there's actually like commands
70:25 - and little games you can play and little
70:27 - points you can earn
70:28 - so i'm just exploring that and getting
70:31 - used to that
70:39 - all right
70:43 - let's check the chat
70:52 - uh bargain uh shazam kit i have no
70:55 - idea how to use but i think i saw
70:59 - a session on that right like this one
71:03 - you should definitely bookmark that
71:04 - watch it tomorrow come on the stream
71:06 - you can watch that while i watch
71:08 - something else and
71:10 - you can let us know how easy or hard it
71:12 - is to use
71:13 - this one right here unfortunately i
71:14 - don't have any experience with it
71:16 - i can't really teach teach you about it
71:22 - yeah okay in any case thank you guys
