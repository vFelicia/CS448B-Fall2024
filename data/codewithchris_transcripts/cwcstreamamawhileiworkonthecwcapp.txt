01:52 - my
03:01 - hey everyone can you hear me
03:08 - how are you guys all doing
03:18 - now that i've been streaming for a week
03:20 - and a half it's nice to see a lot of
03:22 - returning faces and getting to really
03:25 - know you guys
03:27 - and i know my streams are still a little
03:28 - bit random because
03:30 - i'm sort of like thinking on the fly
03:32 - about what
03:33 - i want to talk about uh or what we can
03:36 - do on these streams
03:38 - um but i think you know give it a week
03:41 - or two and we'll get into a natural
03:43 - rhythm
03:43 - where i'm thinking maybe one day of the
03:45 - week will just be
03:47 - like group study code um or work
03:52 - and then another day might be like just
03:55 - hangout
03:56 - ama or maybe showing you guys a
03:59 - particular project that i'm doing
04:01 - and then maybe another day it'll be a
04:03 - presentation where i teach you guys
04:04 - something but
04:05 - for that if i'm gonna be coding in xcode
04:07 - and compiling
04:09 - i'm gonna need my new mac that hasn't
04:11 - actually come in yet hey good morning
04:14 - james
04:16 - yeah what time of day is it for you guys
04:18 - does this time slot
04:21 - work out um i know there's no perfect
04:25 - time that's going to work for everyone
04:26 - unfortunately but hopefully we can
04:30 - you know make the stream at a time where
04:33 - most of
04:34 - everyone can make it and for me i
04:36 - actually prefer
04:37 - uh prefer the mornings just because
04:40 - i feel like i'm the most alert after
04:43 - lunch is probably the worst
04:45 - after just eating a meal
04:57 - hey sergio thank you for joining
05:00 - um during your afternoon
05:04 - hello mr worker and hello slava
05:07 - thank you so much for watching uh the
05:09 - videos i know it's been a while did you
05:11 - guys catch the
05:12 - the video that just came out yesterday
05:15 - um i took
05:16 - a lot of that uh coding tips from the
05:19 - audience and from the newsletter so
05:21 - from time to time i'll pose a question
05:23 - to our
05:25 - newsletters and every saturday we send
05:28 - one
05:29 - and i got so much feedback coming back
05:31 - that it was it took me a long time to
05:33 - actually
05:34 - compile that feedback or not feedback
05:37 - because i was asking
05:38 - for coding tips for beginners um and
05:40 - these
05:41 - the people who reply there was a mixture
05:43 - so the people who
05:45 - you know were into ios a little bit
05:47 - farther down the road
05:49 - they gave their advice to beginners and
05:51 - to their former selves
05:54 - but for people who were just starting
05:56 - out they gave me feedback on what they
05:58 - were struggling with so that's really
05:59 - helpful too and i've got a bunch of that
06:01 - feedback
06:02 - for a future video
06:12 - hey john yeah is anyone else having
06:15 - a low low volume or low audio issue let
06:18 - me know
06:18 - um i think from my end
06:22 - the the mixer the audio mixer looks
06:25 - pretty good if i
06:26 - increase the mic anymore i might start
06:28 - getting some feedback and that's not
06:30 - going to be good for your ears
06:34 - all right well just let me know in the
06:36 - chat so uh let's get started with
06:39 - what i wanted to show you guys today
06:43 - and in the last stream i talked about
06:45 - this code with chris app
06:47 - and so we've made a little more progress
06:49 - on it just in terms of planning out this
06:51 - next sprint that we're working on let me
06:53 - just increase the font size a little bit
06:55 - more
06:57 - zoom in
07:02 - so that you guys can see
07:07 - let me just pull up another chart
07:13 - just for those of you who have not
07:18 - weren't here in the last stream i can
07:21 - show you what this is all about
07:22 - just very quickly before i dive in and
07:25 - also
07:26 - i'm treating this stream as a ama so
07:29 - i'm gonna be checking the chat a little
07:30 - more frequently for your questions
07:33 - so do drop me any questions down there
07:37 - in the comment section or the live chat
07:40 - and uh and i'll i'll get to answering
07:44 - tutor
07:44 - you can't hear me as your speakers don't
07:46 - work
07:48 - wait as your speakers don't work or my
07:52 - speakers don't work
07:54 - can you guys even hear me i think my mic
07:57 - is yeah my mic is on
07:59 - okay you scared me there for a second i
08:01 - honestly thought
08:08 - all right let me just let me just double
08:10 - check her i don't want to be talking for
08:12 - an hour without anyone actually hearing
08:14 - me
08:24 - okay you know what i okay
08:28 - so maybe i'll turn down the music maybe
08:31 - that will help
08:32 - you know let me turn down the music a
08:34 - little bit
08:35 - maybe that will actually help
08:39 - okay cool tutor your your speakers don't
08:42 - work
08:42 - okay got it got it got it okay so i
08:46 - unfortunately i can't do anything about
08:48 - that you're gonna have to get some new
08:49 - speakers tutor
08:53 - all right cool so i'm going to talk
08:55 - about this cwc
08:57 - app and just very briefly because i do
08:59 - see a lot of familiar faces here so i
09:01 - don't want to rehash everything
09:03 - that we talked about in the last stream
09:05 - but essentially
09:06 - this app is going to be the official
09:08 - code
09:09 - with chris app so we're going to feature
09:11 - our content in here but
09:13 - also for our program members
09:16 - you know the cwc plus program where we
09:19 - have all of our courses and stuff those
09:21 - people will be able to log into the app
09:23 - and then download videos for offline
09:27 - access so that's one of the huge
09:28 - motivating factors for creating this
09:34 - so in this charting software we've
09:36 - identified
09:37 - several different user journeys that
09:40 - you know this app will include but the
09:42 - very first one
09:44 - and we're just getting started with this
09:46 - app so you're really getting a
09:47 - you know on the ground look at it uh we
09:50 - are
09:51 - doing this guest journey where
09:55 - people don't have to create an account
09:56 - but they can still view
09:58 - some of the videos in particular the 14
10:00 - day
10:01 - beginner challenge so that's sort of the
10:04 - background in the context
10:06 - what we've done here is we've mapped out
10:08 - some of the tasks that
10:10 - some of the very first tasks that we're
10:11 - going to need to tackle in order to get
10:13 - that done so today on the stream i
10:15 - thought
10:15 - i would answer your questions while
10:19 - i do some of the work here and we'll see
10:21 - how how well i can do that because
10:24 - that's sort of splitting the attention
10:25 - between two different things uh
10:27 - i mean one of the very first things we
10:29 - need to do is take a look at the data
10:32 - on the screen uh and we do have some
10:35 - wireframes that our designer has put
10:38 - together
10:39 - and so from these wireframes they're not
10:41 - finalized
10:43 - so it's maybe not the best idea to work
10:45 - off of
10:46 - unfinalized wireframes uh us as a team
10:49 - we haven't like
10:52 - gone through this and sort of decided
10:54 - okay
10:55 - this is all of the data we want to show
10:57 - on the screen
10:58 - but i'm going to use it anyways just for
11:00 - the purpose of maybe demonstrating some
11:02 - of my thought process and how
11:04 - i would take a look at an app and and
11:07 - think about how
11:08 - the data is gonna be represented on the
11:10 - back end uh and i'll talk about
11:12 - the back ends that we're using and stuff
11:13 - but anyways for now let's
11:15 - take a look at the chat because i did
11:17 - say that this is going to be an ama so i
11:19 - did see some questions come in
11:21 - okay i think i saw a question from
11:24 - robert so robert asks how did you
11:28 - get started on your programming journey
11:31 - so for me it was
11:34 - it was pretty accidental because i had
11:36 - to take a mandatory
11:38 - coding class in high school in grade 10.
11:42 - so that introduced me to the world of
11:45 - programming and i sort of
11:46 - fell in love with it there i didn't know
11:49 - that this was something that people
11:51 - could do you know write programs and
11:53 - make computers do stuff
11:56 - so it was just this epiphany that i had
11:59 - and that i could even use my pc at home
12:03 - to write programs so that really opened
12:06 - up my eyes and that sort of became my
12:07 - hobby for a lot of the time and
12:09 - it was at that time i decided okay as my
12:11 - career that's what i want to go into
12:13 - for you know post-secondary education
12:15 - that's what i want to do
12:16 - before that i i think i wanted to do
12:20 - graphic design
12:21 - i had always liked graphic design
12:27 - so let's see what other questions we
12:29 - have here
12:39 - when learning to code what's the best
12:41 - approach as in how many
12:43 - hours of reading and watching tutorials
12:46 - to actually writing code
12:49 - uh i so in the past i said that
12:53 - this is a one-to-one one-to-one because
12:57 - um whatever you're learning whatever
13:01 - you're seeing
13:02 - someone do in a video it's best to try
13:04 - it out yourself on your own computer
13:07 - because that's how you learn
13:10 - it helps you retain the information and
13:14 - you know reading it and watching it is
13:16 - sort of just like the theory
13:18 - but it's not until you actually do it
13:20 - yourself
13:21 - that there are a lot of like insights
13:24 - that
13:25 - that will come up and you sort of
13:27 - understand it in a different way
13:29 - so just to tell you a funny story for me
13:32 - when i first started learning ios
13:34 - programming
13:35 - and back then it was objective c um
13:39 - i had already been you know programming
13:42 - as a professional
13:43 - at that time i was i was working
13:45 - full-time at a company
13:47 - and they had the first ipad project
13:50 - for a news broadcasting company here in
13:53 - canada they wanted to build a news
13:55 - app to feature their articles and stuff
13:58 - so
13:59 - i was tasked to build this and
14:03 - at that time no one else at the company
14:04 - had had known objective c
14:07 - or done any ios development so i picked
14:09 - up a book
14:10 - and i read it and because i had that
14:13 - background
14:14 - that programming background and computer
14:16 - science background
14:17 - it was it was pretty simple to read
14:19 - through
14:20 - and i i basically went through the whole
14:22 - book and
14:24 - through every chapter i understood what
14:26 - they were talking about
14:28 - uh things made sense but i didn't do any
14:31 - of it
14:31 - right i did i wasn't actually doing it
14:34 - while reading it
14:35 - and at the end of the book i thought
14:37 - okay like now i have a firm grasp on
14:41 - objective-c and ios development well
14:43 - when i sat down to actually start i
14:45 - realized i didn't know how to start
14:47 - and so that became you know later on
14:49 - this experience became a basis for
14:51 - how i teach and how i recommend
14:53 - beginners to learn is that
14:55 - you know you cannot just watch the
14:59 - videos
14:59 - or read the book and you shouldn't even
15:01 - wait that long
15:03 - to get your hands dirty so as much as
15:06 - possible try to start
15:07 - if you don't have a mac you can still
15:09 - start there are you know
15:11 - online what is a repel is one
15:15 - is it repellent yeah this one
15:20 - this is one that you can use it has a
15:23 - you can do swift in here online so even
15:27 - if you don't have a mac right away maybe
15:29 - you're waiting for it to come in or
15:30 - maybe you
15:30 - actually don't have a mac you can still
15:32 - learn swift through
15:34 - uh through things like this swift online
15:38 - editor
15:41 - yeah there are there are a bunch of
15:42 - different ones here so
15:44 - repel it this one i talked about
15:49 - this one is a little older one i don't
15:51 - know if this one still works
15:52 - yeah all right
15:57 - so let me i'm going to transition
16:00 - between the questions and here so
16:02 - let's come back here for a second and
16:04 - let's talk about
16:05 - our designer and sort of how he started
16:08 - thinking about it because you know
16:12 - as a designer you want to be following
16:15 - best practices
16:17 - and you want to
16:21 - um you want to design something that
16:24 - you know in the same design language
16:26 - that people are used to seeing for that
16:28 - type of app
16:29 - and so in talking with a lot of the
16:32 - different designers i
16:33 - i find that one of the first things that
16:35 - they do is take a look at
16:37 - other types of apps sorry other apps out
16:40 - there
16:41 - that are of the same type so in this
16:45 - case
16:46 - our designer took a look at master class
16:49 - and also at skillshare and i mean there
16:51 - are other apps out there
16:53 - that are video based you know online
16:56 - learning platform type of things but
16:58 - we've only
16:59 - taken a look at two of them so far and
17:02 - you know you want to get an idea for
17:04 - what other people
17:06 - are doing and sort of the
17:10 - user experiences that they have and
17:12 - obviously these larger companies have
17:14 - gone through
17:14 - user testing they've done iterations to
17:17 - improve
17:18 - the interface so you're sort of
17:20 - shortcutting things
17:21 - right by by taking a look at what
17:24 - they're doing
17:25 - in terms of the look and feel like
17:27 - that's going to be your own
17:29 - look and feel and your own design but
17:32 - there
17:32 - are maybe ways that the user uses these
17:36 - apps that you can
17:37 - draw from so for example i mean netflix
17:40 - is a big one
17:42 - and masterclass is one we were we were
17:46 - one thing that i want to mention in
17:48 - particular is the ability to download
17:50 - videos offline so if you guys have used
17:52 - the netflix ios app
17:54 - you actually uh you tap on each
17:58 - video or each episode you want to
17:59 - download and it downloads it
18:01 - whereas for skillshare they had a very
18:04 - different way of doing things so i don't
18:06 - know if it's shown here it's actually
18:09 - yeah here so for example for this course
18:12 - the skillshare course
18:13 - they have this toggle switch right here
18:16 - which when you toggle on
18:18 - it just downloads all of the lessons in
18:20 - that
18:21 - course and if you want to
18:24 - toggle like if you want to delete your
18:26 - offline downloads you just toggle this
18:28 - off so that you cannot download
18:30 - individual lessons
18:31 - and at first i thought you know i didn't
18:33 - like that lack of control
18:35 - but then i began as i used this app a
18:37 - little more i began to appreciate
18:40 - you know the simplicity of it so i don't
18:42 - have to manage individual
18:44 - downloaded lessons and episodes it's
18:46 - just a single toggle
18:48 - right and the idea is that if i'm going
18:50 - through this course chances are
18:51 - i'd want to watch all of these lessons
18:54 - in the course
18:55 - and so it just goes ahead and downloads
18:57 - all of them offline so i mean those are
18:59 - you know
19:00 - those are the reasons why that's just an
19:02 - example of why you do these sort of
19:03 - exercises and take a look at what other
19:05 - people are doing
19:08 - all right let's take a look at the chat
19:09 - here
19:15 - sigh i started you say i started
19:18 - programming in university i wish i could
19:20 - have started earlier
19:21 - yeah yeah same here um people are
19:24 - starting really early now
19:25 - my four-year-old daughter is learning
19:27 - scratch coding through school now
19:29 - so it's great to see that
19:34 - june welcome back it's nice to see you
19:35 - again do you think flutter or react
19:38 - native will replace
19:39 - native development so
19:44 - and then you had a second question there
19:46 - what should you learn first with ui or
19:48 - ui kit if you want to get a job
19:50 - uh so regarding the first question
19:52 - flutter or react native
19:54 - uh i actually haven't played around with
19:56 - them before
19:57 - so i can't say but um
20:02 - mark who i don't think is in the chat
20:04 - today but mark from big mountain studio
20:06 - as part of his full-time job he was
20:09 - working with
20:10 - xamarin for a long time and so xamarin
20:13 - is
20:13 - is that sort of thing where i can't type
20:18 - properly
20:20 - where it's not native ios development
20:24 - but it's where you can use c-sharp and
20:27 - visual studio
20:28 - is it visual studio that you use xamarin
20:30 - with i don't know
20:32 - but you can build ios apps and android
20:34 - apps with it
20:35 - so he ran into a lot of
20:38 - difficulties with xamarin and i think
20:42 - his opinion is he doesn't really
20:43 - recommend it if you have a choice
20:45 - if you don't have a choice you're
20:46 - constrained by other limitations then
20:48 - you know you do what you have to do but
20:50 - in terms of
20:51 - flutter and react native i'll always see
20:53 - them as
20:54 - sort of like non-native solutions and in
20:57 - my head at least
20:58 - i might be mistaken um those will never
21:01 - be as
21:02 - good as native if you want to harness
21:04 - the power of
21:05 - everything that apple has to offer on
21:08 - their platforms
21:09 - you know all of their apis and stuff
21:11 - because
21:13 - if you think about just conceptually um
21:16 - these cross-platform solutions have to
21:19 - they're like there
21:20 - has to be a bridge somewhere between
21:24 - what you do on flutter and react to
21:27 - the apple apis um
21:31 - and so it's always another layer
21:34 - that you're you're introducing on top so
21:37 - my opinion and again i might be biased
21:40 - and i might be wrong here
21:42 - so if anyone in the chat
21:45 - you know has great experiences with
21:47 - flutter and react native and have
21:48 - has really pushed the limits of it and
21:51 - and tested it out
21:52 - then um definitely chime in but my
21:55 - opinion is i i would go native if if you
21:59 - had to
22:00 - if you had the choice i mean and plus it
22:02 - really depends on
22:03 - how complicated your app is so if it's
22:07 - you know not using a lot of the
22:11 - low-level apple apis and it's pretty
22:13 - simple and you need
22:15 - a cross-platform solution where because
22:17 - you want android version and you want
22:19 - like your ios version then maybe that's
22:21 - a great solution for you so
22:22 - i guess it you know it depends and the
22:25 - job
22:26 - prospects for flutter and react nate
22:29 - react native i'm sure there's jobs out
22:32 - there and employers
22:33 - out there looking for those developers
22:35 - right so i don't think it sort of
22:37 - limits you but in terms of swift ui
22:40 - or ui kit if you want to get a job uh i
22:43 - honestly haven't been in the job market
22:45 - but i have seen swift ui pick up
22:48 - significantly since it was introduced
22:51 - and
22:51 - at that point in time i guess it was
22:54 - like
22:55 - a year and a half ago or two years ago
22:57 - now
22:58 - where i was like ui kit is still the
23:01 - the thing to learn if you want to get a
23:04 - job where swift ui is sort of like the
23:06 - play thing
23:07 - that you do on the side the thing that
23:10 - most companies might be just dedicating
23:13 - very little resources very little
23:14 - developers to explore
23:17 - but then now you know we're starting to
23:20 - see full apps built in swift ui that are
23:22 - pretty compelling
23:23 - and also you know with apple
23:27 - they decide what they want to push
23:31 - and that's the thing they're going to
23:32 - put their full marketing
23:34 - and pr power behind
23:37 - so the same thing happened with swift
23:39 - right when it was introduced over
23:41 - objective c and now swift ui so if they
23:44 - say like that is the future
23:46 - then you can be sure that over time um
23:50 - you know new features and new things
23:52 - could only be limited to swift ui and
23:55 - it's only a matter of time maybe we're
23:56 - talking about
23:57 - years and years into the future where
23:59 - swift ui
24:01 - might uh might overtake but in terms of
24:03 - job prospects maybe
24:05 - for like right now i guess you're asking
24:07 - for right now um
24:09 - maybe the simplest thing to do is just
24:10 - go on a job site
24:12 - right and then look for swift ui versus
24:14 - ui kit
24:15 - developers at the end of the day i feel
24:18 - like most
24:19 - ios developers won't be able to
24:22 - pigeonhole themselves
24:23 - into one right just because you are a ui
24:27 - kit developer doesn't mean you can't be
24:28 - a swift ui developer as well i feel like
24:31 - uh these things like they're not going
24:33 - to be looking for
24:35 - a swift ui developer or ui kit developer
24:38 - i feel like
24:38 - the job posting is going to be for an
24:40 - ios developer
24:42 - and you might just need to know both
24:48 - uh splash fruit your question is sort of
24:50 - similar do you think it's still worth
24:51 - learning ui kit i completed the
24:54 - ios foundations and databases course
24:56 - thank you should i
24:57 - remain learning ui kit or switch to
24:59 - swift ui
25:07 - so if you're starting brand new right
25:11 - now i would say that swift ui definitely
25:13 - is the way to go
25:15 - to start if you have already
25:18 - you know you're well into ui kit then to
25:21 - be honest
25:22 - swift ui wouldn't be a really far
25:26 - reach for you but if your priority
25:30 - is building your own apps right now and
25:32 - you want to like implement
25:34 - your ideas really quickly or maybe you
25:37 - want to try out one of the new apple
25:39 - apis that are just
25:41 - swift ui only uh
25:44 - then that's a reason to learn swift ui
25:46 - but i mean if you want to implement your
25:47 - own apps and you already know ui kit
25:49 - then
25:50 - then maybe just stick with that um
26:02 - uh what were you doing there before
26:04 - software too yeah so
26:05 - i guess you're asking about my uh
26:09 - my old company yeah i was a software
26:12 - developer there
26:14 - so zeus of hollywood got to go audio
26:16 - unacceptable i really want to get to the
26:18 - bottom of this audio problem
26:20 - uh is it too
26:23 - soft or is it staticky definitely let me
26:26 - know
26:29 - okay land asks if you had to start over
26:31 - learning swift what would be your
26:33 - best approach would you start by
26:34 - learning the fundamentals first or would
26:36 - you dive straight into a project
26:38 - i think you'd have to at least get some
26:40 - fundamentals down first before you can
26:43 - you can build anything if you just dive
26:45 - straight into a project you wouldn't be
26:47 - able to
26:48 - to do it so definitely learn some of the
26:51 - basics first like how to
26:53 - construct some basic layouts how to
26:55 - construct some
26:57 - uh basic to do some basic swift logic
27:01 - um thank you so much jun i really
27:03 - appreciate your
27:05 - your super chat thank you
27:08 - uh i would definitely learn the basics
27:10 - first land just
27:12 - like how to express some basic logic
27:14 - with swift how to build some basic
27:16 - layouts
27:16 - and then like i said before you have to
27:19 - get your hands dirty you have to
27:20 - definitely
27:21 - try things out so
27:25 - definitely again learn the basics and
27:28 - then
27:28 - go transition into trying to build your
27:31 - own small project start really small
27:33 - i know for a lot of the beginners my
27:35 - advice is
27:36 - uh a lot of people get into app
27:39 - development because they have an app
27:40 - idea
27:41 - but usually it's pretty far out of reach
27:45 - so don't lose sight of that app idea
27:48 - keep it in mind but at the same time
27:50 - realize that what you're learning
27:52 - can't be rushed it's a it's a skill it's
27:54 - a very valuable and marketable skill
27:56 - that um it's just like learning a
28:00 - language or learning piano or learning
28:02 - guitar or something it does take time
28:04 - and practice
28:05 - and if you have that sort of mindset
28:07 - where
28:08 - you know you can make it it's just going
28:11 - to take practice and time
28:13 - if you keep that sort of mindset then
28:15 - you will reach your goal
28:16 - you know often people give up because
28:19 - they had unrealistic expectations about
28:21 - how far they can get
28:22 - and how quickly they can get there
28:30 - uh sudito asks can we integrate swift ui
28:33 - and ui kit
28:34 - together in a single project yes you
28:36 - definitely can
28:38 - and you can do it both ways too if i
28:39 - believe i've only done it the way where
28:42 - uh i have a swift ui project and you
28:45 - integrate ui kit into it
28:48 - um but i haven't done it the other way
28:49 - around but from what i've
28:51 - heard you can and the reason why you
28:54 - you probably will have to do that to a
28:57 - swift ui project
28:59 - is because swift ui doesn't have all of
29:00 - the components
29:02 - and all of the cool things that ui kit
29:05 - has
29:05 - because uikit definitely has been around
29:07 - longer so
29:09 - maybe going back to your question splash
29:11 - fruit
29:12 - do you still think it's uh worth
29:15 - continuing ui kit
29:16 - versus switching to swift ui um
29:20 - that's one aspect to consider is that ui
29:22 - kit has
29:24 - you know a ton more libraries and
29:27 - controls and
29:29 - things like that that if you're used to
29:31 - using then by all means go ahead and
29:33 - stay
29:33 - using that but at some point you're
29:35 - gonna have to start picking up and
29:37 - learning swift ui
29:39 - okay so let's take a look at what we
29:42 - have here while we wait for more
29:43 - questions to come in
29:46 - so we decided to start with
29:49 - uh ipad we wanted to do
29:52 - this code base that would support mobile
29:56 - and ipad both form factors and
30:00 - maybe mac os as well
30:04 - but in this ipad format what we were
30:06 - imagining here is that when someone logs
30:09 - in
30:10 - they you know that there's a learning
30:12 - path and that's one thing that
30:14 - i i've learned over the years in
30:17 - teaching ios is that
30:19 - uh there's a ton of content out there
30:22 - but i think what's very valuable is
30:24 - organizing that content in a way
30:27 - in sort of like a step-by-step fashion
30:29 - for someone to follow
30:31 - and that's why someone would pay for
30:34 - lessons right or pays for a course
30:36 - even though there are tons of tutorials
30:38 - out there because you don't really know
30:39 - where to start and you want to be taken
30:41 - on a journey you want to be guided along
30:44 - and be
30:44 - told here's what you do next and here's
30:46 - what you learn next and here's
30:48 - you know and so that's what we try to do
30:50 - with our
30:51 - foundations course in our cwc plus and
30:54 - i've basically taken like the first
30:56 - 14 lessons of that foundations course
31:00 - and it's free on youtube if you go
31:04 - into youtube.com code with chris you'll
31:06 - see the 14 day beginner challenge
31:08 - in swift ui and that basically is the
31:11 - starting point that i would recommend
31:13 - then beyond 14 lessons even if you don't
31:17 - decide to continue with that after those
31:19 - 14 lessons you have a pretty solid idea
31:23 - of building uis in swift ui
31:26 - and also some basic expressing some
31:30 - basic logic with swift
31:31 - and you get introduced to swift as if
31:34 - you don't have any coding background
31:36 - because that was the intention for
31:37 - the course so that's in this app that's
31:40 - what i really want to present to the
31:41 - user
31:42 - is here's your starting point so this
31:44 - big gray block
31:45 - is going to feature that 14 day beginner
31:48 - challenge
31:50 - um and down here will be
31:53 - our different course listings
31:57 - that we have we have a course
32:00 - overview so when you click into a course
32:02 - there's obviously
32:04 - a description i want to have a overview
32:07 - video for each of these course
32:09 - descriptions sorry course overviews
32:13 - outcomes is actually something that i
32:15 - learned about
32:17 - when we tried to get our program into
32:19 - classrooms and schools
32:21 - the language that teachers use in school
32:24 - boards and
32:24 - you know in the education system i was
32:28 - not familiar
32:29 - with those terms
32:35 - and i learned that you know if you want
32:38 - to
32:40 - be taken seriously in that sort of realm
32:43 - you have to be speaking the language so
32:44 - learning outcomes is really important
32:47 - but if you're not in the education space
32:50 - like the school
32:51 - education space learning outcomes just
32:54 - means the goals like what are you gonna
32:56 - get
32:56 - by taking this course what skills are
32:59 - you going to end up with
33:01 - and so that's what that's what it is and
33:04 - you know it's important to list that out
33:06 - so someone
33:07 - they're dedicating their time and effort
33:09 - into taking this
33:10 - course or watching this lesson what do
33:13 - they get out of it and that's actually
33:14 - something i'm starting to really make a
33:17 - focus to do
33:18 - on the youtube tutorials as well in the
33:20 - upcoming ones is that
33:21 - in the right in the beginning of the
33:23 - video to tell
33:24 - the viewer by watching this tutorial
33:28 - what are you gonna accomplish by the end
33:31 - of it or
33:32 - you know show them the result um
33:35 - because often those tutorials are pretty
33:37 - long too
33:39 - okay so aside from this course overview
33:42 - page
33:44 - uh there's gonna be lessons and it
33:47 - really boggles my mind when i was
33:48 - starting this ios foundations course
33:50 - that there are actually so many lessons
33:51 - to it
33:52 - so anyways going back to looking at this
33:54 - data i've certainly forgot
33:56 - forgotten the purpose we were here um i
33:59 - wanted to model the data like how
34:01 - are all of these pieces of information
34:03 - that we see here on the wireframe how is
34:05 - it going to be
34:05 - represented in data right because the
34:09 - app
34:10 - needs to connect to some data source to
34:11 - get all of this information
34:14 - so you take note of things like this so
34:16 - a course
34:18 - might have an overview video
34:21 - right so we're gonna need some sort of
34:23 - stream url
34:25 - attribute for to represent that it has a
34:28 - title
34:28 - right a description learning outcomes if
34:31 - we
34:32 - if we actually end up doing that because
34:34 - like i said these wireframes aren't
34:36 - finalized yet
34:37 - but if you go down here this is actually
34:40 - sorry this is a lesson page this is an
34:42 - individual lesson so when you go down to
34:44 - an individual lesson
34:45 - you have the title of the lesson
34:47 - description of the lesson
34:49 - and also uh duration
34:54 - pretty simple not very complicated at
34:57 - all
34:59 - and maybe we'll just pull up
35:03 - i was planning to just to do this in a
35:05 - document
35:10 - let's check the stream see if there's
35:12 - any questions here
35:20 - june asks should swift developers also
35:22 - prepare
35:23 - uh for coding interviews and lead code
35:26 - and hacker rank
35:29 - you know i don't know what
35:33 - i i think it really depends on the types
35:35 - of companies you are
35:37 - applying to first of all i don't think
35:41 - those things would hurt
35:42 - like if you created an account on those
35:44 - and you have
35:46 - you know you spend time on them and you
35:48 - can show
35:49 - you know some sort of i don't know what
35:52 - they do accreditation
35:53 - accreditations or certificates or
35:56 - rankings or something like that
35:58 - i don't think it will hurt to put that
36:00 - stuff on your resume
36:02 - because i haven't been in the job market
36:05 - i don't know if companies are
36:08 - specifically looking for those types of
36:10 - credentials
36:11 - from those two sites but
36:14 - if they prepare you for algorithm
36:18 - questions
36:19 - or like technical questions that
36:21 - definitely cannot hurt
36:23 - another good way to prepare for
36:26 - interviews as a swift developer um
36:29 - someone that i
36:30 - actually always recommend is uh wayne
36:33 - bishop
36:34 - i don't know if you guys have heard of
36:35 - him before oh man
36:37 - not like there's too many wine bishops
36:41 - there we go
36:46 - so i believe that wayne bishop is an ios
36:50 - architect at a company
36:51 - and he his whole thing is basically
36:55 - helping people with uh
36:58 - algorithms and data structures and as
37:00 - you can see here
37:01 - to pass your ios interview so he has a
37:04 - lot of
37:05 - like books and services as well like he
37:07 - he has a service where you can actually
37:09 - help he'll like help you interview prep
37:12 - so i think he might i don't i don't
37:14 - actually know because i haven't taken
37:16 - it but uh he might do a mock interview
37:20 - with you
37:20 - that's what it's called yeah
37:28 - yeah so definitely check wayne out he's
37:30 - got
37:31 - even if you don't uh take any of his
37:34 - services or products he has a bunch of
37:36 - blog posts and stuff like that
37:55 - so let's talk a little bit about the
37:58 - data for this app
38:00 - and where that data is coming from so
38:04 - people will be able to log into their
38:07 - code with chris account
38:08 - and these accounts are basically um
38:11 - accounts the user store is on our
38:14 - wordpress platform on our website
38:16 - because that's what we use
38:18 - on the back end so in terms of
38:21 - authentication and
38:22 - and confirming that you actually have an
38:26 - account
38:27 - we're going to be hitting the wordpress
38:29 - api to
38:31 - authenticate you but then in terms of
38:34 - the
38:35 - the content and what you have access to
38:37 - you know whether or not
38:38 - you are a cwc plus member so you have
38:41 - access to all the courses
38:43 - or you don't have a membership which is
38:46 - fine because you can still access all of
38:48 - the
38:49 - the free content we have that sort of
38:52 - authorization on what sorts of courses
38:54 - are available to you
38:56 - is through the thinkific api
39:01 - so thinkific is the learning platform
39:02 - that we use
39:04 - um and they have an api for us to
39:07 - access to look at
39:10 - different things so for example
39:15 - we would be looking under enrollments
39:18 - to take a look at we'll probably pass in
39:22 - the
39:22 - email of the logged in user into this
39:25 - api to see
39:26 - what courses they are enrolled in
39:29 - and then this would give us a bunch of
39:31 - information back on what courses they
39:33 - have access to
39:35 - now i wish it stopped there but
39:37 - unfortunately
39:38 - it doesn't because this thinkific api
39:42 - doesn't actually expose the streaming
39:44 - video urls for all of the lessons
39:47 - so you can see here it has courses and
39:50 - each course will have uh chapters
39:54 - so chapters are modules and then each
39:57 - chapter
39:58 - will have contents and these are the
40:01 - lessons
40:02 - unfortunately these lessons
40:06 - do not give the video url for us to
40:11 - play through the app so this url
40:14 - that the lesson exposes this is
40:17 - just the url to visit that lesson page
40:21 - on thinkific
40:23 - so i don't think they meant for this api
40:27 - to be used in the in the way that we
40:30 - want to use it
40:30 - as you know a way to play the learning
40:34 - platform content
40:35 - on a mobile app now they themselves say
40:39 - that they have a thinkific mobile app
40:40 - but that's not what we're looking for
40:42 - we're looking to build
40:43 - you know a code with chris official app
40:46 - so what
40:47 - i decided to do or what we are going to
40:50 - do
40:51 - is we are going to keep a separate
40:54 - set of these videos on vimeo
40:57 - which we have a company vimeo account
41:01 - and then that those videos will have
41:04 - streaming urls unfortunately we can't
41:07 - store those
41:08 - streaming urls in thinkific
41:11 - because it's not a database or anything
41:13 - like that so we're gonna have to have a
41:15 - separate
41:16 - firestore database to keep that
41:19 - so now like this is getting more and
41:21 - more complex
41:24 - um the the benefit is
41:27 - having our own database where we can
41:29 - sort of store anything we want including
41:31 - these
41:31 - video streaming urls is that we can
41:33 - store other metadata
41:35 - for example if in the future for this
41:37 - app we want to do
41:38 - like achievements or badges or whatever
41:42 - for user metadata we can use firebase
41:45 - or the firestore database to store that
41:48 - information
41:49 - so just to do a quick recap the app
41:53 - connects to wordpress api
41:54 - to confirm your account to authenticate
41:57 - you
41:57 - it connects to the thinkific api to
42:01 - check what sorts of courses you have
42:03 - access to
42:04 - on our platform and then it's going to
42:06 - connect to a firestore database
42:08 - for the actual streaming urls and any
42:11 - other metadata we decide to keep about
42:13 - the user
42:15 - inside the app all right let's check
42:18 - some questions here
42:24 - a barcode asks do you have any tutorials
42:27 - on writing ios apps in objective c
42:29 - i'm a new developer and my work has
42:31 - older apps that i'm trying to understand
42:32 - on how to navigate
42:34 - i don't understand how to view and
42:35 - navigate to each screen in xcode
42:38 - unfortunately well so to start i
42:42 - i started my blog in objective z
42:45 - so and then on youtube if you look way
42:48 - way back in my channel you'll find a ton
42:49 - of objective c content as well so if you
42:51 - go to
42:52 - code with chris and you just search
42:54 - objective c
42:55 - i have a tutorial on um
42:59 - writing objective c code so like
43:01 - understanding it
43:03 - and let me just find it
43:07 - yeah blast from the past
43:11 - okay
43:22 - yeah so in here i actually wrote the
43:24 - equivalent for swift so
43:25 - if you know swift act this actually
43:27 - might be helpful and to be honest if
43:29 - objective c has changed
43:31 - since then this might not actually be
43:35 - relevant either so
43:38 - oh wait this is about learning swift
43:40 - from objective c you know i had
43:41 - something else
43:43 - anyways this is uh
44:00 - yeah this is what i was referring to so
44:02 - this is my
44:03 - objective c guide so this i was trying
44:06 - to teach people objective c here so
44:08 - this is really uh this is an old article
44:10 - i wrote in the first year of starting
44:14 - code with chris
44:19 - that's actually changed so
44:22 - i'll paste this url in here in case
44:26 - you want to check it out
44:29 - but that's objective c
44:32 - uh in terms of how objective c like a
44:35 - project
44:36 - looks like in modern xcode now i'm
44:39 - actually not sure
44:40 - so unfortunately i can't help you with
44:42 - that but there must be
44:44 - objective c resources out there and
44:46 - still there's definitely still people
44:47 - working with objective c so
44:49 - hopefully a google search will turn up
44:51 - something useful for you
44:54 - hey good morning adrian ethan asks chris
44:58 - i got my undergrad in data management
44:59 - going for a graduate in software
45:01 - development
45:02 - any advice in general for students in
45:04 - regards to networking having a linkedin
45:06 - portfolio website
45:07 - so this is actually a really good
45:09 - question because uh i go through
45:12 - well i interview and screen a lot of
45:15 - students
45:16 - for internships here through that
45:20 - university co-op program cooperative
45:23 - education i think they call it but
45:25 - essentially
45:27 - these students alternate between four
45:30 - months of school and four months of work
45:32 - placement and us as employers
45:36 - if we hire these students the government
45:39 - heavily subsidizes our costs for hiring
45:42 - the student
45:44 - because they definitely want to help you
45:46 - know it's a
45:47 - government incentive to help students
45:49 - get more work experience
45:50 - so anyways that's so that's why i
45:52 - interview a lot of students through the
45:54 - university
45:55 - and one of the things that i look for i
45:58 - feel like the greatest
45:59 - indicator for success
46:03 - is not actual knowledge about
46:06 - what the job does so i don't look for
46:09 - people with
46:11 - swift ui experience or like a lot of
46:14 - xcode and swift experience
46:16 - i do look for people who have done swift
46:19 - and xcode but like even if it
46:23 - is a small app but what i really look
46:27 - for is the ability to learn
46:29 - and also passion so to put it into more
46:32 - concrete terms um i heavily favor people
46:36 - who
46:37 - list their github accounts on their
46:40 - resumes
46:41 - that i can actually click through and
46:45 - see the projects that they've worked on
46:48 - and it's not like i'm screening their
46:50 - code and looking through it and seeing
46:51 - how they write code
46:52 - but it's just a demonstration to me that
46:56 - this person actually likes to code and
47:00 - likes the program
47:01 - you know versus another applicant that
47:04 - doesn't have a github account
47:05 - or hasn't linked to it right so that's a
47:08 - good indicator for me another one
47:10 - is joining hackathons so i understand
47:12 - that now during covid hackathons are
47:14 - still happening but they're happening
47:15 - virtually and online so on your resume
47:19 - definitely list any hackathons that
47:21 - you've been to
47:22 - that you've participated in uh because
47:26 - those are extracurricular right that's
47:28 - not part of school and it's mandatory
47:30 - and what that shows me
47:32 - as an employer is that you're definitely
47:35 - passionate about this
47:37 - uh about software development and coding
47:39 - and hacking
47:41 - and also the nature of a hackathon is
47:44 - usually that
47:45 - you're trying to figure stuff out in a
47:47 - very short amount of time
47:49 - and so the the more participation that
47:52 - you have in hackathons
47:54 - the more it shows me your ability to
47:56 - learn
47:57 - i mean it's not a perfect indicator but
47:59 - it definitely helps and
48:01 - we've hired about maybe four
48:04 - or five students so far and obviously
48:07 - not all five are working because
48:09 - here now because they have you know they
48:11 - do four months here and then
48:12 - four months of school and then four
48:14 - months at another company and things
48:15 - like that but
48:17 - you know all in all i've i've
48:20 - hired four or five students and they've
48:23 - all been phenomenal
48:25 - so so far so good uh so that's my
48:28 - screening process if that helps
48:34 - yeah again definitely demonstrate uh
48:38 - try to demonstrate ability to learn and
48:40 - passion and interest
48:42 - in that that area having a portfolio
48:45 - website definitely helps
48:46 - having a linkedin profile definitely
48:48 - helps if i can see your face
48:50 - and click through linkedin and i can see
48:51 - your face on your linkedin profile
48:53 - that's
48:53 - definitely better than just you know an
48:55 - empty profile image
48:57 - oh and one funny story
49:01 - is uh don't list anything you wouldn't
49:05 - want your employer to see right i had
49:08 - this one
49:09 - applicant list his instagram account
49:12 - on um on his resume
49:19 - and um when i clicked through to it
49:23 - it had images of him holding
49:26 - guns and he was like this he's holding
49:28 - guns and he was just
49:31 - you know like drinking and this i mean
49:34 - what you do in your personal time
49:35 - is your own thing but i don't think
49:38 - that helps your job prospects you know
49:41 - what i mean
49:42 - so just be a little sensitive about that
49:45 - i mean if someone really wants to dig
49:47 - into your personal life and like look
49:48 - you up on facebook and try to find your
49:50 - instagram account
49:51 - you know i don't think you can stop that
49:54 - but definitely don't make it so easy for
49:56 - them to
49:56 - to find that stuff by putting it on your
49:58 - resume
50:00 - okay let's see any more questions here
50:04 - good morning scott hey call of
50:07 - programming
50:08 - uh what are we doing here today so we
50:09 - are just talking about the code with
50:11 - chris
50:12 - app i was walking through a little bit
50:13 - about the design and i was going to
50:15 - model some of the data
50:16 - that we have in the wireframe but it
50:19 - looks like i haven't
50:21 - really gotten to that just yet
50:24 - and we've had a lot of good questions
50:27 - and i tend to actually talk too much too
50:30 - uh sami asks sir i really start coding
50:33 - from zero what should i do
50:35 - completed my btech this month
50:36 - congratulations
50:38 - and i don't i really don't have a job
50:40 - and i am
50:43 - uh you want to work abroad please guide
50:45 - me so i think
50:47 - one of the easiest ways to start getting
50:50 - some experience
50:51 - is um well this sort of ties into
50:55 - ethan's question
50:56 - up there is that the more stuff you can
50:59 - show
51:00 - on your like github things that you've
51:03 - done
51:03 - the better your job prospects will be
51:06 - right if
51:07 - you want employers to to see and get a
51:09 - taste of what you've done
51:10 - but in terms of like actual employment
51:13 - um there are tons of places where you
51:17 - can
51:17 - freelance and you can sort of get some
51:20 - exposure it might not be like your
51:22 - end-all be-all thing that you want to do
51:26 - but ultimately you just need your foot
51:28 - in the door like you need someone to
51:30 - give you a chance
51:32 - and if you don't have anything to show
51:34 - it's hard for someone to give you a
51:35 - chance
51:36 - because like i remember when i first
51:40 - started my job i was super nervous and i
51:42 - didn't feel like i was qualified
51:44 - um but i think that
51:48 - you know if you you don't have to be
51:50 - fully qualified like i'm thinking about
51:52 - my own experience i felt like i wasn't
51:53 - qualified but i worked hard
51:55 - in in that job and i you know got up to
51:58 - speed
51:59 - and i um you know figure things out
52:02 - on the job learned on the job and
52:06 - yeah so it really goes back to just you
52:08 - need someone to give you
52:10 - a try whether that is paid or not now i
52:14 - i want to be very careful because i
52:16 - don't want to say
52:18 - that we should work for free like that's
52:20 - not what i'm saying i don't want to
52:22 - be like yeah you should work for free
52:24 - for four months and
52:26 - and get some experience i mean that's a
52:29 - very easy way of getting experience and
52:31 - and having something to put on your
52:33 - resume
52:34 - and that might be the approach that some
52:36 - people take
52:38 - i don't think it's a bad approach but
52:40 - ultimately
52:41 - i think it boils down to um
52:45 - your personal
52:51 - i don't want to say personal values but
52:55 - you know just don't devalue yourself and
52:57 - what you can offer but at the same time
52:59 - realize that
53:00 - you do need to get some proof that you
53:03 - can do stuff and that you can figure
53:05 - stuff out
53:06 - so again just going back to what ethan
53:08 - said that could be attending hackathons
53:10 - right so there you can have fun and you
53:12 - can have something to put on your resume
53:14 - it could be uh what june said earlier
53:17 - about
53:18 - um doing hacker rank and leap code and
53:20 - and those sort of programs if they give
53:22 - you some sort of
53:23 - uh certificate or some sort of ranking
53:25 - that can sort of demonstrate your
53:27 - ability
53:28 - that definitely helps and some students
53:31 - i've seen
53:31 - that don't have any work experience what
53:34 - they put instead
53:36 - are relevant courses that they've taken
53:39 - in school
53:40 - that might be helpful for the job that
53:42 - they're applying to
53:44 - you know that definitely helps uh
53:46 - extracurricular so
53:48 - uh if if i see on someone's resume
53:51 - that in their spare time they've built
53:53 - you know this app or if they've worked
53:55 - on this
53:56 - project that shows me that they've done
53:58 - that out of
54:00 - interest right and out of the
54:03 - coding and development might be
54:05 - something that they like to do in their
54:06 - spare time anyways
54:07 - and to me that is a really strong
54:11 - indicator of someone who
54:13 - is a right fit for a software developer
54:22 - sami no no i'm not i'm not the master in
54:24 - fact you know i struggle with
54:27 - with uh imposter syndrome still if you
54:30 - guys have heard of that right it's that
54:32 - thinking you're not good enough right
54:33 - thinking that
54:35 - you um you know you don't know
54:37 - everything so why should you be here
54:40 - creating a video or live streaming for
54:42 - example but like what i try to keep in
54:44 - mind is that
54:45 - um okay so
54:49 - the the best way to overcome that is
54:52 - just to be honest actually
54:53 - is just to say like i'm here just like
54:56 - you
54:58 - learning and that's why i want to do
55:00 - like group coding and study sessions to
55:02 - keep myself accountable to continue
55:04 - continuing my own learning right and and
55:07 - to code here on live stream to show you
55:10 - guys
55:10 - that i'm not just typing in xcode
55:13 - and building an xcode and staying in
55:15 - xcode 100 of the time
55:18 - um you'll see me going to google going
55:21 - to stackoverflow
55:22 - you know searching out error messages
55:24 - looking at other people's tutorials
55:26 - to implement stuff that i need because
55:29 - you know if you're honest about it then
55:31 - you have nothing to hide and nothing to
55:32 - be ashamed of because we're
55:34 - uh we're all on this learning journey
55:36 - it's just that you know some people
55:38 - are farther ahead some people are
55:39 - farther behind but wherever you are
55:41 - at at that journey you can help the
55:43 - people behind you and that's
55:44 - that's what i firmly believe
55:52 - says i just got a mac and installed
55:54 - xcode just out of curiosity and found it
55:56 - very complicated
55:57 - uh your your teaching has helped me pass
55:59 - through it now i created my own app
56:01 - oh that's so awesome to hear thank you
56:04 - thank you for watching my videos and i'm
56:06 - glad that that those lessons have worked
56:08 - for you
56:11 - uh scott asks do you have a course on
56:12 - how to use figma
56:14 - uh i do actually so
56:17 - but before that we actually have a video
56:20 - we have videos on
56:24 - uh let's see
56:40 - yeah so i've done a couple of figma
56:42 - videos on youtube and as you can see
56:44 - there's
56:44 - there's a bunch of different ones and
56:46 - there's one of me looking very angry
56:47 - here
56:48 - angry thumbnail but in addition to that
56:51 - we have
56:51 - a course on our membership that
56:55 - we're actually working on right now
56:59 - so this one right here and we have an
57:02 - in-house designer
57:04 - who is teaching the figma portions
57:07 - and i am doing the xcode integration
57:10 - portion so i'm really excited for this
57:11 - course
57:12 - because this designer we i've worked
57:14 - with him for a long time
57:16 - but it was only recently that we hired
57:18 - him
57:19 - into code with chris so he's now a
57:21 - full-time employee and
57:23 - he he's a great presenter and a great
57:25 - teacher so glad i found him and
57:27 - and just it worked out like that
57:30 - but i'm also excited to show more
57:33 - figma like design to code sort of
57:36 - tutorials
57:38 - on the youtube channel because in the
57:40 - past it was just me
57:41 - doing most of the coding and then
57:42 - throwing together something for a design
57:44 - but now i can actually show that process
57:47 - where
57:47 - you know we go from figma to xcode so
57:49 - you can expect to see more of that
57:52 - sort of content here
57:58 - all right good luck summit work on those
58:01 - uh
58:01 - extracurricular activities and put them
58:04 - on your resume and and
58:05 - get back out there applying the jobs
58:07 - honestly
58:08 - uh a little bit of it is just a numbers
58:11 - game in luck
58:12 - right the more you apply to the more
58:13 - rejections you get you will eventually
58:15 - hit a yes and you'll get your foot in
58:17 - the door and as long as you're a hard
58:19 - worker
58:20 - you know and a smart worker and you can
58:22 - figure things out
58:24 - um that then then your gravy
58:27 - right because after that first job if
58:29 - you do well in
58:30 - it that is your stepping stone to other
58:33 - jobs and
58:34 - that second job will be much easier to
58:36 - find
58:41 - ethan asks when coming up with your own
58:43 - app do you recommend completing the
58:44 - design and user flow before you start
58:46 - building or do you recommend building
58:47 - first
58:48 - so this is a question that i get pretty
58:51 - often
58:51 - and you know if you look at what i'm
58:54 - doing here
58:56 - for these wireframes uh i would
58:59 - definitely say you need at least
59:00 - an idea of what screens you have
59:04 - in your app and what data or what
59:07 - you want to show on each screen before
59:09 - you start now they don't have to be
59:11 - wireframes like this you don't have to
59:15 - you know this is not a design it's just
59:17 - blocks of
59:19 - color on a rectangle to show you
59:23 - where you might put something and how
59:25 - you might arrange something
59:27 - but at least doing this at a bare
59:29 - minimum forces you to think about
59:32 - how to architect your app because
59:34 - without some sort of
59:36 - visual even if that visual is just in
59:38 - your head
59:39 - if you haven't thought about it how are
59:41 - you going to start
59:42 - building the base right of your project
59:45 - so whether that's on pen and paper which
59:48 - to be honest i
59:49 - that's how i do it before we had a
59:51 - designer come on board
59:52 - i just grabbed my notebook
59:57 - i just have a notebook and i
60:00 - just sketch out some screens and it's
60:03 - honestly like very therapeutic and it's
60:05 - really fun
60:06 - because we don't often at least for me i
60:08 - don't often get to work with paper and
60:10 - pencil
60:10 - paper and pen anymore so to me that
60:13 - process is kind of fun
60:14 - roughly sketch out the screens i want
60:17 - what elements will exist in it and then
60:19 - i just
60:20 - jump straight into code i actually don't
60:21 - design it
60:23 - because for me you know as a developer
60:27 - what i only see technical challenges
60:30 - right so
60:30 - when i'm thinking about the app my head
60:33 - is on
60:35 - what are going to be the roadblocks or
60:37 - big obstacles that i have to
60:38 - overcome what do i have to figure out
60:41 - for this app to come to life
60:43 - and that is what i'm focused on i'm
60:45 - focused on solving those technical
60:47 - puzzles
60:48 - um whereas you know with jc our designer
60:53 - he's focused on um how do i make this a
60:56 - great user experience
60:59 - you know and what sort of navigation
61:02 - and the way we present the information
61:04 - what makes sense
61:07 - what makes this like a joyful app to use
61:10 - and i think that because my expertise
61:13 - isn't there i treat that as sort of like
61:16 - an
61:16 - afterthought so i'm not saying that my
61:19 - way is right
61:20 - but just as a developer that's how i
61:23 - approach it as a designer they
61:24 - obviously would go the other way around
61:27 - i think if you were strong in both
61:29 - let's say that you were equally strong
61:31 - in development and design
61:33 - in the ideal world i feel like you would
61:35 - go through design
61:36 - first
61:40 - because you know if you look at
61:45 - what is it the waterfall
61:49 - software development process or life
61:52 - cycle whatever you want to call it
61:54 - this is one way of you know building
61:56 - software
61:58 - and it's basically a sequence of steps
62:01 - that you go through
62:04 - and if you look at this
62:08 - right it's requirements you gather the
62:10 - requirements from
62:12 - the client or from yourself if you're
62:14 - building the app you gather the
62:15 - technical requirements write down
62:17 - everything
62:17 - that your app should do go through
62:19 - design right and this is i think
62:22 - uh it says software architecture here
62:25 - right but i think
62:26 - this would also like before you can
62:28 - architect your app you need to know
62:29 - what you're architecting and what
62:31 - screens there will be so i think
62:33 - this step also involves like visual
62:36 - design
62:37 - as well as like technical design and
62:38 - then implementation and all this so this
62:40 - is the waterfall model
62:42 - um i think that nowadays
62:45 - uh product development is more you know
62:48 - iterative is
62:50 - the more popular approach so
62:53 - you know a lot of people like to use the
62:55 - agile software development but i feel
62:57 - like here you're still
63:00 - you're still going to need to go through
63:02 - like a minimal level of design so i
63:04 - don't know if you guys can see this if i
63:06 - click this
63:08 - it says that
63:12 - should go through requirements design
63:14 - development testing deployment
63:16 - review but you're just doing it in like
63:18 - a tighter
63:19 - smaller chunk so at the end of the day
63:23 - i feel like yeah as a developer you
63:25 - still at least need to
63:28 - rough out some screens in your notebook
63:34 - uh you raj you asked how did you find
63:37 - your purpose and love for coding
63:39 - i fell in love with it in school i had
63:41 - to take a mandatory programming class in
63:42 - grade 10
63:43 - and instantly sort of just fell in love
63:46 - with it i was trying to build
63:47 - pokemon pokemon was a game that was
63:49 - popular at that time and
63:51 - to be honest i didn't actually even play
63:53 - pokemon on the gameboy
63:55 - i didn't but for some reason i wanted to
63:59 - i wanted to build it because i just
64:01 - learned programming and i wanted to
64:03 - learn and i built a volleyball game and
64:05 - and chess and i sort of just fell in
64:07 - love with it building
64:08 - games because as a kid who doesn't like
64:10 - playing games right
64:14 - so i would play i would build little
64:17 - games
64:17 - and then that's when i decided i wanted
64:20 - to go to university for that
64:23 - beau asks hello chris first time being
64:25 - here i learned about your tutorials
64:26 - because one of my teachers used your
64:28 - tutorials to teach i'm so
64:29 - so happy to hear that i found them very
64:31 - useful and also subscribe to your
64:32 - courses thank you so much
64:34 - and yeah so earlier i was talking about
64:37 - the language that schools use like
64:39 - learning outcomes and there were some
64:41 - other ones
64:42 - like uh pedagogy or something like that
64:46 - anyways we we created documents there
64:48 - was a lot of documents that we created
64:51 - for the purpose of you know
64:55 - being a legit course curriculum provider
64:58 - for schools
65:00 - and we actually got to the point of
65:01 - talking to school boards which is really
65:03 - really cool
65:04 - but what we learned was that school
65:06 - boards there's a lot of like
65:08 - bureaucracy and and
65:11 - red tape they don't like sometimes
65:15 - what courses and what curriculum uh gets
65:19 - chosen like what training materials get
65:20 - chosen is not
65:22 - based on the merit of the material
65:25 - itself and i think this goes with
65:27 - just life in general there's a lot of
65:29 - business relationships
65:31 - uh other motives that drive those
65:35 - decisions
65:37 - um into what they choose to use
65:41 - right money could be exchanged there
65:43 - might be incentives to go with different
65:45 - anyways so we realized that at that time
65:48 - it was just
65:49 - my wife and i ellen working on code with
65:51 - chris so we realized that
65:52 - man we'd really have to dedicate a lot
65:54 - of resources
65:56 - and a lot of time to try to get into
65:58 - schools like that
65:59 - um so we sort of abandoned trying to get
66:02 - our course as a school board
66:06 - wide curriculum for like all classes
66:09 - but however however we have gotten some
66:13 - teachers
66:13 - coming to us wanting to use our
66:16 - foundations course for
66:18 - teaching their class and this is really
66:21 - a happy medium because
66:23 - you know it's not school board wide and
66:25 - that teacher probably has
66:27 - some sort of autonomy on what they want
66:30 - to use to teach
66:31 - and because they've taken some of our
66:33 - lessons maybe they find that
66:35 - our teaching method jives with
66:39 - their class and the way they want to
66:40 - present the class
66:42 - then we we do have a handful maybe about
66:45 - four
66:46 - different classrooms actually in school
66:49 - using
66:49 - this curriculum for their computer
66:53 - science class or their
66:54 - app development class and what was
66:56 - really cool was i actually got to um
66:59 - i got to appear to one of the classes
67:01 - and we did sort of like a zoom thing
67:02 - with all the students
67:03 - and it sort of brought me full circle
67:05 - back to where
67:06 - where i started with my programming
67:09 - journey
67:10 - it was in school that's where i
67:11 - discovered coding and programming
67:13 - so that was really cool in terms of the
67:15 - experience
67:22 - in 2018 your video for creating an app
67:24 - in excel got me coding and since then
67:25 - i've recently come back to finish it
67:27 - that's great that's great i'm so glad to
67:30 - hear that
67:31 - yeah never give up and to be honest
67:35 - i i never knew that i'd still be doing
67:37 - this you know eight years later
67:39 - but i'm so thankful so thankful to all
67:42 - of you guys
67:42 - for learning with me jeff says i created
67:46 - a game with
67:47 - 5 000 lines of code and it's getting
67:48 - hard for debugging and it's almost done
67:50 - but the ui is not very good
67:52 - but it is nice doing it and i can't wait
67:53 - to publish the game on android that's
67:55 - awesome congratulations jeff
67:58 - that's uh that's going to be a huge
68:00 - achievement
68:03 - suny says hey chris i'm a high school
68:05 - student who loves your channel is
68:06 - wondering if you offer a student
68:08 - discount
68:08 - very low budget so actually
68:12 - if you look at the description of this
68:14 - live stream you'll see a special offer
68:16 - uh like a heavily discounted price to
68:19 - join our courses
68:21 - check it out that might fit your budget
68:24 - if not um then
68:27 - we will think about doing some giveaways
68:30 - or some other ways
68:31 - where you can maybe earn uh earn a
68:34 - membership or something like that or win
68:35 - a membership
68:36 - recently we did a cwc stories
68:40 - campaign where i i asked you guys
68:44 - for all of your programming and coding
68:47 - stories
68:48 - like how you got started
68:52 - and we said that anyone who submitted a
68:54 - story
68:55 - will get a free month of cwc plus
68:59 - and i don't know if you you've missed
69:01 - that
69:03 - maybe you didn't see it or anything like
69:04 - that but we are going to feature those
69:07 - stories
69:08 - uh that campaign has ended but if you
69:11 - want to uh also submit let's see
69:15 - where do we go here video peel is the
69:18 - platform that we use if you want to
69:20 - submit
69:21 - a testimonial or a video you know your
69:24 - story
69:25 - if you want to do that we have a
69:31 - yeah i'll paste this url in here
69:38 - let me see what this looks like
69:49 - i'll give you this one
69:56 - so you could record a testimonial right
69:57 - from your browser and basically what
69:59 - we've been doing is anyone who records a
70:01 - video for
70:02 - us we offer them a free month of cwc
70:05 - plus just as a thank you
70:06 - so i'll paste this in the chat just in
70:08 - case anyone wants to
70:10 - go ahead and do this
70:14 - so there's that um
70:17 - but we're about to wrap up the stream
70:20 - here
70:21 - time is time is ending but i'll stream
70:23 - again
70:24 - i think probably next tuesday check out
70:27 - the
70:28 - cwc.to streams
70:31 - if you come here you'll always see the
70:33 - schedule for streams coming up and the
70:35 - links
70:43 - yeah suny okay so in that case it won't
70:46 - work but if you
70:47 - if you want to check out the link in the
70:48 - description of this video
70:50 - if that fits your budget then
70:54 - awesome so check that out um
70:58 - i'll probably stream again next tuesday
71:01 - mondays are a little bit busy and again
71:03 - i think that
71:07 - the types of streams maybe i'll ask you
71:10 - guys i asked you guys what sort of
71:11 - streams do you guys want to see
71:16 - let me just do a poll here let's do a
71:18 - straw poll before i go
71:21 - there's actually a polling feature
71:24 - in stream labs i just have not used it
71:27 - before
71:29 - so okay
71:38 - oh
71:47 - favorite favorite
71:51 - okay because i have to give you some
71:52 - concrete options here so
71:57 - study code work streams
72:01 - what else do we have we have a q a
72:06 - chat hangout streams which is
72:09 - kind of what this stream turned out to
72:11 - be uh
72:14 - presentations this is more of like
72:18 - powerpoint or keynote type of slides
72:21 - types of presentations um
72:24 - you know like powerpoint keynote
72:28 - slide presentation
72:32 - or how about uh
72:36 - yeah so there's like building something
72:39 - on stream that is not prepared
72:44 - so it's like random not like
72:47 - i will probably think about what i want
72:49 - to build but i wouldn't have built it
72:51 - before
72:52 - and so you can sort of see the process
72:53 - of me
72:55 - trying to put it together and that will
72:57 - sort of be the ultimate
72:59 - humbling experience right because um
73:04 - you know you'll get a sense of what uh
73:07 - i think all developers go through is uh
73:11 - the idea in the beginning is very messy
73:13 - and very hazy but then as you
73:15 - work on it more and as you like pull
73:17 - pieces from here pull pieces from there
73:19 - it starts getting a little more concrete
73:22 - are there any other answers here that
73:24 - you guys want to
73:30 - add
73:32 - a build with me so i think a build with
73:35 - me would would be something like this
73:38 - but with this i have to wait for my new
73:40 - mac to come in because
73:41 - what i told you guys before with this
73:43 - mac as soon as i hit
73:44 - compile or build on xcode
73:47 - the cpu it takes up all my cpu
73:51 - and then the stream sort of stutters and
73:53 - buffers
73:54 - and that's not going to be great so i
73:55 - have a new mac coming in it'll probably
73:57 - be closer to the end of june
73:59 - where i can actually stream and
74:02 - build stuff at the same time so let me
74:04 - create this now
74:07 - um i think this
74:10 - is fine or you know what i'm gonna allow
74:12 - multiple choices
74:14 - just so we can get some more answers
74:20 - uh can i just share this with you guys
74:31 - awesome scott i'm so glad to hear that
74:33 - yeah that's what i have coming in here
74:54 - chris do you think the website for swift
74:56 - xcode open
74:58 - when app development comes to ipad
75:02 - um i'm not sure what you mean by that
75:05 - can you rephrase your question
75:08 - jeff
75:15 - we've just got one vote so far we have
75:18 - we have 30 people on the stream
75:22 - or are the results just a little slow
75:24 - coming in
75:32 - all right guys get your answers in
75:36 - like i said i do want to these are
75:38 - definitely on
75:39 - well these are all sort of on my on my
75:42 - radar to do
75:46 - hey suny yeah unfortunately um the
75:49 - discount is for a month unfortunately i
75:51 - can't
75:52 - i can't give a rate like that for uh
75:55 - forever
75:56 - so sorry about that
76:00 - votes are coming in yes
76:03 - okay so there's a clear winner here
76:10 - okay while you guys do that i'm going to
76:14 - do
76:14 - a typing test
76:17 - i'm not a fast typer well i don't feel
76:20 - like i am a fast typer because i watch
76:21 - some other people type and they can type
76:23 - really fast
76:24 - so have you guys ever checked your
76:28 - words per minute or rate of
76:32 - typing rate all right so i'm going to
76:34 - try to try this while you guys
76:36 - get in what you guys guess guess what my
76:39 - words per minute will be
76:40 - on the stream
76:44 - ah start over
77:42 - ah
77:48 - wow guys this is crazy this is
77:52 - my highest yet and this is on stream
77:55 - i thought i'd be so nervous that i'd
77:57 - like choke and seize up but
77:59 - that's crazy i should do these tests
78:02 - more often on stream i just hit a
78:05 - a personal record here
78:08 - but you can you guys can see
78:11 - see my uh
78:14 - what what a nerd i am doing typing tests
78:18 - but yeah
78:19 - this is cool my before my highest was
78:21 - that
78:22 - so today gotta hire one maybe we'll do a
78:26 - few more
78:27 - in the future let's check the results
78:34 - what no study code and work streams you
78:38 - guys
78:42 - these would be like the most chill and
78:44 - relaxing for me i would i could just uh
78:46 - turn on the camera for hours we'll just
78:49 - do like
78:50 - a five hour study code work stream or
78:53 - something like that
78:55 - um but okay i see where your guys heads
78:58 - are at
78:59 - okay but you guys are gonna have to wait
79:01 - until the new mac comes in and we'll
79:02 - build something on stream
79:07 - uh unfortunately i have to go uh but
79:09 - ethan last question
79:10 - very quickly do you recommend learning
79:12 - official ios frameworks versus google
79:13 - firebase
79:14 - or is that more dependent on the jobs
79:16 - you're applying for startups
79:18 - versus legacy applications um i think
79:21 - that
79:24 - there you know there aren't official
79:27 - ios frameworks for everything right so
79:28 - unfortunately you can't use that for
79:31 - everything but
79:32 - in the cases where you can you know
79:34 - you'd definitely like if there is
79:36 - a uh swift ui component that
79:39 - fits my needs i would use it if it
79:41 - doesn't fit my need you could try to
79:43 - extend it
79:43 - or you can try to find like a pre-built
79:46 - one
79:47 - um but i think first i would look
79:50 - towards
79:51 - apple definitely like in in the past
79:54 - for example i've used realm for
79:57 - local database
80:02 - but then mongodb acquired realm
80:06 - and it really changed everything and so
80:08 - you know if you had
80:09 - built a serious app using realm as your
80:12 - back end
80:14 - uh you'd have to do some crazy
80:16 - modifications but
80:18 - let's say that you opted to use core
80:20 - data instead like let's say both
80:22 - realm and core data fit your needs
80:23 - perfectly and you couldn't you just
80:25 - couldn't decide which one
80:27 - um you know it turns out that sticking
80:29 - with the
80:30 - apple framework would have saved you a
80:33 - ton of work
80:34 - so i feel like if the apple frameworks
80:36 - fits your needs then that might be the
80:38 - way to go
80:39 - but anyways thank you guys so much
80:41 - unfortunately i have to
80:42 - run and have lunch with the family but
80:45 - again i'm so glad to see
80:46 - so many familiar faces come back and the
80:48 - next time i'll streaming
80:50 - i'll be streaming is probably on tuesday
80:53 - so
80:53 - again check out cwc.to slash
80:57 - streams and you'll see this i don't have
81:01 - it up here but i'm going to
81:03 - you'll find the schedule and you'll find
81:04 - the link alright thank you guys so much
81:07 - and we'll do this again next time see
81:09 - you guys
