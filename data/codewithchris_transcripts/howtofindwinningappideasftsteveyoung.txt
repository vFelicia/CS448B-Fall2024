00:02 - [Music]
00:06 - hey code crew what's up it's chris here
00:08 - so today i am so excited to be talking
00:11 - to
00:11 - steve because a couple of days ago he
00:13 - reached out and he wanted to see if you
00:16 - guys would be interested in hearing
00:17 - about
00:18 - how to come up with the winning app
00:19 - ideas and i was like
00:21 - well this guy's reading my mind because
00:24 - as you guys know we're gonna start doing
00:25 - monthly app challenges
00:27 - and i've been racking my head about what
00:29 - sorts of apps
00:30 - i could create and i was kind of
00:32 - shooting in the dark i was thinking
00:33 - about what would i want
00:34 - but i didn't really have any sort of
00:36 - data or any sort of way to validate the
00:39 - idea and
00:40 - so i know steve's the guy to talk to
00:42 - when it comes to that sort of stuff he's
00:44 - got the number one app business podcast
00:46 - he's interview people
00:47 - director of shazam creator of color
00:49 - switch podcast is over
00:52 - hundreds of episodes long but as i
00:54 - understand today he's got a presentation
00:56 - for us to tell us exactly
00:58 - how to go through that process and not
01:01 - you know shoot in the dark and waste our
01:03 - time really figure out
01:05 - is my app idea does it have the
01:07 - potential
01:08 - to rank up there you know compete with
01:11 - the other apps in the space
01:12 - and at the end of the day generate a
01:15 - nice and healthy passive income for us
01:17 - so steve hi hey chris thanks for having
01:20 - me on we're
01:20 - close to seven or over 700 episodes now
01:24 - that is a lot yeah yeah man
01:27 - hey i wanted to provide my on your
01:29 - audience with
01:30 - the the tools and the step-by-step
01:33 - process on how to find
01:34 - winning app ideas i'll tell you a quick
01:36 - story why this i feel like it's so
01:37 - important
01:38 - i had a friend of mine who we ended up
01:40 - working together to help grow his app
01:42 - it was a game really well designed it
01:44 - was a scrabble
01:46 - meets solitaire game i thought
01:48 - everything was awesome
01:49 - we drove tens of thousands of downloads
01:52 - on a very limited budget he even spent
01:54 - more money on this
01:55 - we got it featured by apple like we did
01:57 - phenomenally well with this app yeah
01:59 - guess what happened chris
02:01 - well shut it down because it was not
02:03 - engaging enough it was not retaining its
02:05 - users
02:06 - and it wasn't monetizing enough and this
02:07 - was a game that he spent
02:09 - lots of time on and so he went through
02:11 - this exact process that i'm about to
02:13 - show you
02:13 - and it completely turned his company
02:16 - around because he had three months
02:18 - of cash runway left and he was like look
02:20 - i gotta figure out what's working in the
02:22 - app space
02:22 - and kind of make similar apps and
02:25 - when he did that it totally flipped his
02:28 - company around
02:29 - and he was able to save his company
02:31 - that's a great story
02:32 - that's amazing should i go into it then
02:35 - yeah yeah
02:36 - i'm excited i'm waiting let's do it
02:38 - because i was in a similar boat you know
02:40 - in 2011 i started making apps and i was
02:41 - like
02:42 - this would be cool and so right now i'm
02:44 - going to show you the step-by-step
02:45 - process and you're going to find that
02:46 - there are some apps out there making
02:48 - hundreds of thousand dollars a month
02:50 - and you would be like what this simple
02:53 - thing i can do this
02:54 - in a weekend using code with chris all
02:56 - right here we go chris
02:57 - all right guys so here's the tools app
03:00 - annie these are all
03:01 - free tools and i'll go into some of the
03:03 - paid options if you guys want to go more
03:05 - advanced
03:06 - but these are all free right now all
03:07 - right i'm in my app banning account
03:09 - here's what you're going to do you're
03:10 - going to sign in
03:10 - you can sign up for free and then you're
03:12 - going to go into the top charts
03:14 - here now obviously because of the things
03:18 - that are happening right now
03:19 - you're going to find that zoom all these
03:21 - other apps are doing pretty well
03:23 - and you're going to want to see what you
03:25 - want to see is what types of
03:27 - abs are grossing the most so the main
03:30 - column that you want to focus
03:32 - on is this grossing tab you're going to
03:33 - see the the more popular ones right
03:36 - fortnite tinder clash of clans all this
03:39 - stuff
03:39 - and so what i like to do is these are
03:41 - going to be the obvious ones so that you
03:43 - can see all the way to the top 100.
03:46 - what i like to do is let's say chris
03:48 - like do you have an idea like is there a
03:50 - certain category that you
03:51 - would want to focus on yeah i wanted to
03:54 - focus
03:55 - on health and wellness i'm really
03:57 - interested in that i think that's a huge
03:59 - part of our lives that
04:00 - are lacking especially um in the i.t
04:03 - space and so
04:04 - you know like meditation type of apps um
04:07 - home workouts that sort of stuff yeah
04:09 - and it's
04:10 - very telling so what you can do then is
04:13 - go into this category
04:14 - and then you can sort it by health and
04:16 - fitness
04:17 - and you can see which ones are the top
04:19 - grossing apps and you can go down
04:21 - as far as you want so maybe the most
04:23 - popular ones
04:24 - are gonna be the obvious ones and so i'm
04:27 - gonna scroll down fast and you slow me
04:28 - down if you need me
04:30 - to but you're gonna just look through
04:32 - some of these and you can sort
04:33 - get to 500 right and i found that you
04:36 - want to probably stay within the first
04:37 - 200
04:38 - because once 500 they're probably not
04:40 - making as much money as you want
04:42 - okay so it's a great way to kind of look
04:45 - through everything
04:46 - and here's what you're gonna do you're
04:47 - gonna try to find an app so i found an
04:50 - app for you guys that i think is super
04:51 - easy to make i personally like the
04:53 - entertainment space
04:54 - sure because you know like you'd be
04:56 - surprised because i find that a little
04:58 - bit easier to make
05:00 - and like there's a celebrity voice
05:01 - changer app that is making three hundred
05:03 - thousand dollars that i found
05:05 - wow and i did a little analysis on this
05:07 - and so i found entertainment apps are
05:09 - pretty easy to make
05:10 - and so i like to explore that category
05:12 - right
05:14 - so here's an app that i found for you
05:15 - guys it's called find hidden objects in
05:18 - picture
05:19 - super simple app and
05:22 - here it is so it just says can you find
05:24 - all the hidden objects
05:26 - in this main picture my daughter has a
05:28 - book exactly like this
05:30 - no way for me yeah it's like where's
05:32 - waldo right yeah exactly
05:34 - super simple idea okay so here's what
05:36 - we're gonna do
05:38 - you find this app you're gonna go into a
05:40 - tool called sensor tower
05:42 - you're gonna sign up again free
05:44 - absolutely free or just send it for a
05:45 - trial if you need to
05:46 - and then i found this app so i clicked
05:48 - on it just to
05:50 - make sure we don't have any loading
05:51 - problems
05:54 - can i pause you there for a second steve
05:56 - so just to recap for
05:58 - for anyone as and also from my own
06:00 - understanding app annie was where we
06:01 - looked at kind of the top grossing
06:03 - charts basically to get an idea of
06:05 - what's making money what's working in
06:07 - the app store in terms of generating
06:09 - revenue
06:10 - but then now we're jumping over to
06:12 - sensor tower to look deeper into
06:14 - a specific app correct and why is that
06:16 - why
06:17 - we can't do that in app annie or it's a
06:19 - different tool
06:20 - yeah app annie won't expose those
06:22 - numbers because
06:24 - unless you pay essentially i see yeah
06:27 - yeah
06:27 - yeah that's absolutely right sorry then
06:29 - here's where it is right it's number 30
06:31 - under top grossing and i i just scrolled
06:35 - right like i was just scrolling and then
06:37 - i was like what is this hidden
06:38 - find hidden objects in picture like
06:40 - that's a cool name for it and so i
06:41 - clicked into this
06:43 - and then i'm gonna go into why you might
06:44 - need this screen but here
06:46 - we won't see any revenue numbers so
06:48 - we'll need another tool to give us that
06:51 - okay great question so i'm interested to
06:54 - hour now
06:54 - what i did essentially was just look for
06:56 - that app and i just said find hidden
06:59 - objects in picture and then awesome i
07:02 - clicked on
07:02 - this and it brought me to here
07:06 - and here is the app page and this is
07:09 - where you can see the revenue numbers
07:10 - so they did in february 2020 they did
07:12 - about a million downloads
07:14 - and then 300 000 in revenue and
07:16 - obviously when you get these huge
07:18 - numbers
07:18 - they're going to be doing some
07:19 - advertising
07:22 - but just imagine if you don't obviously
07:24 - if you don't want to spend any money on
07:26 - marketing
07:26 - if you can just get a piece of the pie
07:29 - of that 300 000
07:30 - and make a similar app just think like
07:33 - we
07:34 - as indies we probably just need to make
07:35 - a tenth of that and be like
07:37 - that's pretty good money right and so
07:39 - just think about that the value
07:40 - that's where you see okay here's an
07:42 - opportunity for me so maybe now i can
07:44 - spin it
07:44 - right now that now your wheels should be
07:46 - turning maybe i can spin it for
07:47 - kids or maybe i can have different
07:50 - animations or their hero characters
07:53 - or different graphics so you should go
07:54 - check out the app and figure out what's
07:57 - what it's doing and then figure out how
07:59 - you can easily
08:00 - create a similar app to it but one thing
08:03 - i want to note here is that it's hard to
08:05 - determine
08:06 - if maybe the advertising is completely
08:09 - driving the revenue like without the
08:11 - advertising that they'd have zero and so
08:13 - i just want to point out that you could
08:15 - keep scrolling down the list
08:17 - right there's 500 entries over on the
08:18 - app annie side
08:20 - and you can try and find an app that
08:21 - might not be doing zero like you know
08:23 - doing zero advertising
08:25 - so that you can model it after or get a
08:27 - better idea of what no advertising
08:30 - would look like true and i'm going to
08:32 - show you ways where you can
08:34 - you can still drive growth without
08:35 - advertising too and chris you brought up
08:37 - a good point too here's all the top
08:38 - in-app purchases
08:40 - so you know they're they're you can
08:41 - figure out are they making money off of
08:44 - ads on their own like is it ad generated
08:46 - or is it
08:47 - a subscription and mostly you're gonna
08:50 - find that a lot of these top grossing
08:51 - apps
08:52 - are subscription based and it's
08:54 - surprising the number of people
08:56 - that are in the weekly and i'll get into
08:58 - some of the things why you may not want
08:59 - to do weekly
09:00 - but you'll also find that a lot of these
09:03 - high-grossing apps are charging on a
09:05 - weekly basis
09:06 - wow okay so you're like wow this is
09:10 - great so easy to build
09:12 - we're gonna hop back into app annie and
09:14 - here's what you're gonna do
09:16 - you're gonna go into the review section
09:20 - right okay and then what you want to
09:23 - really look for
09:24 - are what are people loving about the app
09:26 - and then what are people
09:28 - not liking about the app and that gives
09:30 - you ideas on
09:31 - how you can improve upon an existing
09:34 - successful app idea
09:36 - and maybe things that you can keep in
09:38 - the app
09:39 - and so i'm in the ratings section and
09:42 - you can go and sort by
09:43 - the most critical
09:46 - right and here's why i'm telling you
09:48 - maybe you don't want to do
09:50 - a weekly subscription because the first
09:51 - review we see it's like this does not
09:53 - tell you that it will charge you weekly
09:55 - this app is a joke stay away
09:57 - right so be careful that's why i'm like
09:59 - you might want to do monthly you don't
10:00 - want to trick your users into it
10:02 - but you can start reading through what
10:05 - people
10:06 - hate about the game and how you might be
10:08 - able to improve upon it
10:10 - and so maybe they hate that they have to
10:12 - pay but look most people hate that they
10:13 - have to pay
10:14 - so i would i would probably like take
10:16 - that with a grain of salt
10:17 - but you can start reading through and
10:18 - you can sort this by english as you can
10:20 - see there's other languages
10:21 - up here you can sort it by english if
10:23 - you want worldwide you know there's a
10:25 - little filter here
10:26 - sorry my computer's getting stuck and
10:28 - it's crazy to me that
10:29 - it's got a cumulative rating of 2.6 but
10:32 - it's
10:33 - making 300 thousand dollars a year i'm
10:36 - sorry a month
10:37 - yeah well i think look i think if you do
10:39 - yeah totally right
10:41 - it's got tons of ratings and it was just
10:43 - the the thing is it was just launched
10:45 - may of 2019 so you can see that within
10:47 - center tower hop back
10:49 - that it was launched towards the end of
10:50 - may 2013 2019.
10:54 - so again you can start reading through
10:57 - these and figure out
10:58 - what is good about the app what is bad
11:01 - about the app how you can improve upon
11:03 - the app
11:03 - and start building a different version
11:07 - of this app now my friend that i told
11:08 - you earlier in the story early in their
11:10 - interview
11:11 - that's exactly what he did he created a
11:13 - similar app
11:14 - to what he found that he said i can do
11:16 - this i'm going to create this
11:18 - and create a very similar type of feel
11:21 - and he
11:21 - remixed it right he built a community to
11:23 - bond it without revealing what the app
11:25 - is he built he added some features that
11:27 - he thought would be more valuable than
11:29 - the existing
11:30 - app as well cool any questions here
11:33 - chris i mean this is just great like i
11:37 - can't believe
11:38 - this is free like this is a free account
11:40 - right yeah this this is
11:41 - definitely a free account my sensor
11:42 - tower is paid but you can get it for
11:44 - free
11:45 - because in one of my articles um around
11:48 - generating app ideas i i talk about this
11:51 - too and i talk about how
11:53 - you should look through in apps reviews
11:54 - but i told people to
11:56 - literally go on the app store and scroll
11:58 - through those reviews but this makes it
11:59 - so easy
12:00 - right yes yeah right and you can start
12:02 - really totally through critical
12:04 - and the favorable and so you can make it
12:06 - if you just want to see one stars
12:08 - you can do all that right here yeah this
12:10 - is gold this is time savings
12:12 - yeah and then here's the trend if you
12:13 - wanted to see that
12:15 - all right the next thing we want to do
12:17 - is look
12:19 - maybe you don't want to spend money on
12:21 - advertising
12:22 - totally understandable so how do you get
12:25 - growth
12:26 - one of the ways is through app store
12:27 - optimization which is essentially
12:29 - seo for the app store right having the
12:31 - right keywords in your app title
12:33 - your subtitle your keyword fields you
12:35 - can get in depth on this but i want to
12:37 - give you sort of a little taste of how
12:38 - you can start thinking about
12:40 - what to name that particular app now you
12:42 - have an app idea
12:43 - you know it's successful it's been
12:45 - proven you're going to build upon it
12:47 - you're going to maybe remix some things
12:49 - well you're going to go to another tool
12:50 - called app follow again this is a free
12:52 - account so everything you're seeing
12:54 - is from my free account you're gonna go
12:57 - into this traffic score section
13:01 - and then you're gonna put in the app
13:03 - that you just found
13:04 - so here's what i did chris i feel like
13:06 - this is like a cooking show you know
13:07 - like okay put these flavors and then
13:09 - boom it's done this is what i'm doing
13:12 - hey if we could
13:12 - automate all of this into a workflow and
13:14 - just you know have it pop out
13:16 - uh gold app ideas for us that'd be
13:19 - brilliant
13:20 - totally so i put fit in or find hidden
13:23 - objects in picture
13:24 - again right i put this app in this tool
13:27 - and this is what i love about app follow
13:29 - is
13:30 - it gives me all the keywords that
13:33 - they that apple is actually suggesting
13:36 - so if you put this
13:37 - app into apple search ads which you can
13:39 - do for free
13:41 - you're gonna get apple suggestions on
13:44 - what
13:44 - people this app should be bidding on the
13:46 - keywords that they should be bidding on
13:47 - so that's why i love this tool
13:49 - is because this is literally from
13:51 - apple's
13:53 - tool right like hey this is what apple's
13:55 - suggesting and what i found here is
13:58 - a lot of different keywords now it won't
13:59 - give you the difficulty but give you the
14:01 - popularity
14:02 - and so if you want to pay for some tools
14:05 - or maybe sign up for a free trial
14:06 - what i typically do is hit this little
14:08 - button right here to copy
14:10 - and then i put all these keywords into a
14:12 - pay tool so i can get
14:14 - the difficulty scores and what i've
14:16 - found are sometimes you'll get some
14:18 - misspellings you'll find
14:20 - oh these keywords have good traffic but
14:22 - low difficulty
14:23 - and so for you on a limited budget if
14:26 - you're not going to get any paid
14:27 - advertising well you're going to want to
14:28 - try to find those keywords
14:30 - with i would say anywhere from a score a
14:32 - popular score of above
14:33 - 30 and that has a lower difficulty score
14:36 - anywhere from
14:37 - 80 and up depending on the aso tool
14:39 - you're going to use
14:40 - okay you want that like because sensor
14:42 - tower will give you like
14:44 - a difficulty score similar to the
14:45 - popularity and so the lower the better
14:47 - there so i would say anything 30 and
14:49 - under
14:50 - from a difficulty score some other
14:52 - scores are chance
14:53 - so it's like the higher number is better
14:56 - but like
14:57 - lower difficulty would be three and
14:59 - under or
15:00 - if it's a chance score 70 above okay so
15:03 - just to see if i got this straight
15:05 - um this app follow doesn't tell you what
15:08 - the difficulty scores are but you take
15:10 - this list you pop it into your own
15:12 - keyword tool and there's just
15:13 - a whole number out there and
15:18 - usually keyword tools will have a
15:19 - difficulty score for you
15:22 - so you want to target can you repeat can
15:25 - you go back and
15:26 - which one should we be targeting the the
15:28 - lower difficulty scores and i i don't
15:30 - know how to explain the lower typically
15:32 - because it all depends on the aso tool
15:34 - you use yeah anything that i would say
15:36 - is below let's say a 30. so if it's on a
15:39 - one to ten
15:40 - scale yeah right three and under would
15:42 - be the ones that you want to target
15:44 - okay cool so below half below a third
15:48 - yeah all right and this is these
15:50 - keywords you're working into your
15:52 - uh your app title your description and
15:54 - that sort of stuff
15:55 - yeah okay i'll tell you exactly where
15:57 - you want to put them you want to put the
15:59 - most
15:59 - valuable keywords so let's say you found
16:01 - a gold mine you're like this keyword
16:02 - that's high traffic lower difficulty
16:04 - you definitely want to put it in the app
16:06 - title that has the most weight
16:08 - and so that's why i'm i want to share
16:10 - this with you guys before you even make
16:12 - the app
16:13 - is because then you can start thinking
16:14 - through let's say you find here there's
16:17 - one that i found here that i thought it
16:18 - was pretty
16:19 - valuable like puzzle right that's
16:22 - misspelled
16:23 - now i don't know what the difficulty is
16:24 - yet and i can kind of figure this out
16:25 - for you on the fly
16:27 - but this becomes like an interesting
16:29 - right like
16:30 - keyword because it's misspelled and it
16:32 - has decent traffic 35 is not too bad
16:34 - and so it might be a way that you start
16:36 - thinking through oh
16:38 - i might be able to incorporate this this
16:40 - keyword somehow
16:41 - and search without the e and without the
16:44 - vowels
16:44 - like that might be interesting i think
16:46 - it might be another app but these are
16:47 - now it gives you ideas on what you might
16:49 - be
16:50 - able to call that particular app
16:53 - okay okay make sense right okay because
16:57 - some app names you know they they spell
16:59 - things funny it's
17:00 - because i was about thinking you
17:01 - wouldn't want to literally put a typo
17:03 - into your app description that doesn't
17:05 - sound very professional
17:06 - but some app names are finally spelt
17:09 - like hexa
17:11 - right well actually chris so i had a
17:13 - client and it was
17:14 - a let's say it was puzzle app right
17:17 - without revealing too much either
17:19 - but let's say it was a puzzle app and we
17:20 - found a keyword like this puzzle
17:22 - now this has a higher difficulty so this
17:24 - is what i was referring to right
17:25 - sensor tower is going to give you and
17:26 - this is a paid one but
17:29 - 8.3 which is really high because since
17:31 - you want it to be low
17:33 - so this wouldn't be a keyword that i
17:34 - would want to target but we found one
17:36 - that was a misspelling like this
17:38 - and it had a very low difficulty with
17:40 - similar traffic scores
17:42 - and we didn't use it in a prominent
17:43 - place because obviously you don't want a
17:45 - misspelling there but we did put it
17:47 - into so there's a trick where you can
17:49 - use the spanish mexico there's a spanish
17:52 - localization within the app stores
17:54 - and you can put english keywords in
17:55 - there so rather than putting spanish
17:56 - because it's really meant for the mexico
17:59 - mexico market but if you put english in
18:02 - there it's indexed by the us app store
18:03 - and so what we did chris
18:05 - we put that particular misspelling into
18:07 - the spanish mexico
18:08 - title or you could put in subtitle and
18:10 - we were able to rank number one
18:12 - in two i think it was top two for that
18:14 - keyword and that dramatically helped us
18:16 - grow downloads for this particular app
18:19 - wow that's a ninja hack right there it's
18:21 - like doubling the space you have to put
18:23 - your keywords and your descriptions and
18:25 - stuff right
18:26 - and so what i really want to show with
18:28 - this was thinking about
18:30 - ways that you can sort of use different
18:32 - keywords on how you might be wanting to
18:34 - name
18:34 - your particular app so whether it's
18:37 - hidden objects in a picture
18:39 - obviously this app title is going after
18:42 - a ton of keywords right find hidden
18:44 - objects in picture that is right
18:46 - i am trying to optimize for a lot of
18:48 - different keywords
18:49 - and you know i mean this exercise is
18:52 - really helpful right now because
18:54 - this is the process where you're
18:55 - thinking about your app idea you haven't
18:57 - created yet you haven't named it yet
18:58 - but let's say you have and then you're
19:00 - doing this
19:01 - after that are you able to just change
19:05 - your app name
19:06 - maybe rebranding inside the app might be
19:08 - difficult but in terms of an app store
19:10 - listing
19:11 - can you just go ahead and change the
19:12 - title yeah so before we move on to that
19:15 - and i'm going to answer that question i
19:16 - do want to show one last thing
19:17 - so within app annie you can go to this
19:20 - other tab so you saw the reviews right
19:22 - and you can go into keywords
19:24 - and what i like about app annie again
19:26 - this is free your app and is the only
19:28 - tool that will give you
19:30 - the keywords that this particular app
19:32 - ranks well for
19:34 - so then it'll give you ideas on oh
19:37 - now you don't know if this has traffic
19:39 - unfortunately unless you pay
19:41 - but it will give you ideas on what
19:44 - keywords are driving growth
19:46 - as long as there are there's traffic for
19:49 - these particular keywords
19:50 - what keywords are driving growth for
19:52 - this particular app
19:53 - and so it's a great way to start
19:55 - obviously doing more keyword research
19:56 - and figuring out what keywords to use
19:58 - within your app and title
20:00 - okay great so back to your question
20:03 - about i've already launched it steve
20:05 - i watched this a little bit too late
20:06 - it's out in the app stores
20:08 - but what you can do is change the title
20:11 - so you still want certain keywords
20:12 - within the title
20:13 - and you can still use these free tools
20:15 - to figure out what those titles are
20:16 - going to be
20:17 - but you can change that you just need to
20:18 - upload a new build and from a code
20:20 - perspective
20:21 - that build could be the same thing but
20:23 - you do need to upload a new build
20:25 - got it so the the other thing i would
20:27 - say chris if you start thinking about
20:29 - icons are very important screenshots are
20:31 - very important
20:32 - you want your screenshots to have a
20:34 - little bit of social proof
20:35 - or talk about the benefits i think too
20:37 - many times developers
20:39 - and i follow you on instagram the they
20:41 - just put the screen
20:43 - of the app right so you want to put
20:45 - certain keywords
20:46 - not keywords but here's this is a simple
20:49 - way like can you find all the hidden
20:51 - objects i immediately get what the game
20:53 - is all about yeah based on this so if
20:55 - you just put this screen
20:57 - that just shows you a screen of the
20:58 - actual gameplay it's not helpful
21:01 - add some screens in here you found it
21:03 - well done challenge yourself win a
21:04 - trophy i mean these are simple
21:06 - screenshots and this
21:07 - this app is making 300 000 a month right
21:09 - but like
21:10 - you can add more stuff like compete with
21:11 - your friends or
21:13 - harder than you think so these are there
21:14 - are ways and you can going back to
21:16 - sensor tower you can see what ads are
21:18 - performing well for them
21:20 - and that can give you inspirations on
21:22 - what kind of screenshots because you
21:23 - know
21:24 - if they're running they're spending
21:25 - money on this this is probably a high
21:27 - performing ad right so this will give
21:28 - you some inspiration
21:30 - on what types of words that you can use
21:33 - because they're running this as an ad
21:34 - for your screenshots
21:37 - that's brilliant yeah i mean
21:40 - so that's mainly it i don't know if you
21:42 - had any other
21:43 - questions yeah just a couple of comments
21:45 - on on the screenshot front because
21:47 - it goes back to the whole don't make me
21:50 - think
21:50 - philosophy right so make it really
21:53 - simple um
21:54 - anything that people are spending brain
21:55 - power on there's the chance for them to
21:57 - just hit
21:58 - that back button right totally totally
22:01 - i'm so glad you brought this up because
22:02 - i was reading this book too
22:03 - and i'm a big believer in this we've
22:05 - we've a b tested a bunch of this
22:07 - sometimes we try to be too clever for
22:09 - our own good right
22:10 - and you came up with a brilliant youtube
22:12 - channel code with chris
22:13 - i get it and i think it's the clear
22:16 - titles the clear
22:17 - app names the clear messaging that
22:21 - wins over and over again rather than you
22:24 - trying to be too clever
22:25 - yeah yeah right now i'm going through
22:27 - this book without going too far into a
22:29 - tangent but it's called story brand and
22:31 - it's
22:31 - dude i'm doing the same thing yeah all
22:33 - right let's chat about it later
22:36 - but anyways it's clear messaging is the
22:38 - main
22:39 - pitch of that book but going back to the
22:42 - app stuff
22:43 - um this is gold this is brilliant
22:45 - because it's a data driven way
22:47 - right to get some proven app ideas but
22:50 - one thing i'm sure
22:51 - are on people's minds are okay we're
22:53 - modeling our app idea
22:55 - after something that's successful but
22:57 - inherently then
22:59 - you're thinking that you need to beat
23:01 - them
23:02 - or are you just trying to get a little
23:05 - bit of that success
23:07 - unless you have the biggest budget and
23:10 - you want to try to beat them look
23:11 - i'm all for it but i think what you want
23:13 - to try to do
23:14 - is figure out what's already working and
23:17 - then just improve upon it
23:18 - and as an indie developer out there
23:20 - who's just getting started well
23:22 - too many times we all have this very
23:24 - similar story of our first app and being
23:26 - so beautiful and spending so much time
23:29 - on it and then
23:30 - checking the app stores every day and
23:32 - being like oh i'm gonna see a million
23:34 - dollars right after launch right
23:35 - and that doesn't happen right and so
23:38 - it's a proven model that
23:39 - helped save my friends company who's
23:42 - already made apps was making money
23:44 - just didn't couldn't find a way to
23:46 - sustain that growth
23:48 - it's a proven model to do it that way
23:49 - and so as a startup as an indie
23:51 - you just want a piece of that pie of a
23:53 - proven model
23:55 - and i i think it's it's almost like um
24:00 - i think a lot of people approach this
24:02 - when they want to build an app they have
24:03 - their own
24:04 - great idea maybe something that it
24:06 - doesn't even exist
24:08 - right there right and so you're you're
24:09 - putting it out there and you want to
24:10 - take a chance
24:12 - i think that's cool because it's your
24:14 - own creative idea
24:16 - and it's like a labor of love right it's
24:18 - something that you want to see
24:19 - out in reality but what you want might
24:22 - not be the thing that
24:23 - particularly sells i think it goes back
24:25 - to authors right some people just want
24:26 - to write what they want to write
24:28 - and some people need to write or maybe
24:30 - movies right like indie films versus
24:32 - blockbusters there's a certain type of
24:35 - book or film or app that works and sells
24:39 - right and so what would you recommend
24:41 - for someone
24:42 - i guess it really depends on their goal
24:44 - right if they're trying to make money
24:45 - from the app store or not
24:47 - yeah i think you know and i think
24:49 - building
24:50 - a a new brand or a completely
24:54 - different app idea is going to take a
24:55 - lot of investment and so if this is
24:58 - going to be your first couple of abs
25:00 - then start small start with a proven
25:02 - model and then you can always level up
25:04 - right and so there are
25:07 - friends of ours that have built an app
25:10 - that's very successful now they want to
25:11 - take it to the next level
25:13 - right and so i think if you're just
25:14 - starting out that journey you want to
25:16 - find something that's proven
25:17 - because too many times we all have this
25:19 - energy that we want to learn something
25:21 - we build it
25:22 - and we get it out there and we just
25:23 - don't see it and it becomes deflating
25:25 - and we just don't get motivated and so i
25:28 - think that's the way i see life is
25:30 - i can start this now it's going to be
25:32 - popular or i'm going to get it to a
25:34 - certain level and then
25:35 - if it's making money great i'm going to
25:36 - move on to something bigger and now i
25:38 - have a story that says look i already
25:40 - made a successful app i'm going after a
25:42 - bigger vision this brand new app idea
25:44 - that nobody's ever seen
25:45 - now maybe you need some investors for
25:47 - that too yeah and now you've got some
25:49 - capital
25:50 - to invest into your new idea which is
25:53 - maybe something nobody has ever seen and
25:55 - you have to educate the population
25:57 - on on what this is and why it's good and
25:59 - you know that takes a lot more
26:00 - investment that's a good point
26:02 - right and you know i point to this
26:04 - because i get this question too but i
26:05 - point to this app called hooked
26:07 - where you'll be familiar with it chris
26:08 - it's the stories one
26:10 - yeah it's the chat stories right okay
26:12 - and so very you got to check it out like
26:13 - it is
26:14 - so well done in in terms of the
26:16 - onboarding process like i literally
26:18 - wanted to
26:19 - sign up after going through that
26:20 - tutorial but
26:22 - they sort of created a brand new
26:24 - category right nobody knew about what
26:26 - chat stories were
26:27 - until she created this category and she
26:29 - was a past podcast guest of mine
26:32 - but essentially like that's hard but she
26:34 - came from
26:36 - a company where she created an app
26:37 - that's mule bot
26:39 - right and so now there's some capital
26:41 - now she can try to do something
26:43 - different and she has some experience
26:45 - with it so i think when you're building
26:46 - that first app
26:47 - you don't know the intricacies hey what
26:49 - should i call my app title what should
26:51 - have my subtitles be what should my
26:52 - screenshots
26:53 - and then i didn't know i had to get
26:54 - apple to approve every little thing that
26:56 - i'm gonna build right like
26:58 - and so there's all these little
26:59 - intricacies that you don't know
27:01 - until you actually go through it and
27:02 - going through it with a winning model
27:04 - will give you that motivation to keep
27:06 - going because i know back in the day
27:08 - when i created my app
27:09 - i was like remixing certain things and i
27:11 - was just like oh this would be a great
27:12 - app idea and it launched it as a paid
27:14 - app and back then in 2011 paid apps were
27:17 - still
27:17 - profitable and so that next day i was
27:20 - like hey honey
27:21 - you know trust this watch this because
27:23 - my very first app got like thousands of
27:25 - downloads a day
27:26 - as a free app so i was like oh if i can
27:28 - get like half of that we're gonna be
27:29 - great but it was zero and then i just
27:31 - started
27:32 - implementing more like i added color i
27:34 - started changing some screenshots
27:36 - and then it got to a pretty good level
27:38 - where i was making you know two three
27:39 - thousand dollars a month and i was like
27:40 - pretty happy with this because i was
27:42 - just died right yeah
27:44 - that's awesome yeah so if someone
27:47 - follows that strategy to find
27:50 - you know good app ideas to model after
27:52 - are there any kind of red flags that
27:54 - would say
27:55 - no you shouldn't you shouldn't follow
27:57 - this app idea you shouldn't try to
27:58 - compete with it
27:59 - you know what are the things that should
28:01 - dissuade someone
28:03 - from proceeding great question i think
28:05 - it would be
28:06 - anything that you'd feel like is trendy
28:09 - right
28:09 - okay so i guess you know with the
28:11 - coronavirus going on right now
28:13 - it would be something that you feel like
28:14 - this isn't this doesn't have legs like
28:16 - there's things where it's gonna pop and
28:18 - then it's gonna go down
28:20 - so i think like things like casual games
28:22 - where things are
28:23 - the very their life cycle is very very
28:26 - small
28:27 - right their lifetime value and so that
28:29 - needs a lot of budget
28:30 - a lot of things and what i would look
28:32 - for is how long has the app been out
28:34 - how long are they been doing this is
28:36 - this just a spike
28:38 - a trendy thing that's gonna go away or
28:40 - is this something built upon
28:42 - something else an existing idea like you
28:44 - said with the hidden that app that we
28:46 - kind of featured you said
28:47 - my daughter has a book about this yeah
28:49 - that's a great like
28:50 - aha like it's already existing somewhere
28:53 - else
28:54 - i'm gonna make it even better yeah
28:57 - that's awesome
28:58 - and so it goes back to um
29:01 - looking for types of apps that would be
29:03 - useful you know
29:04 - not just trendy and might go away right
29:07 - um
29:08 - and the other types of apps that are
29:10 - more
29:11 - long-term are content-based ones so i
29:13 - want to get your thoughts around
29:14 - you know apps that are only useful uh
29:17 - because of the content that they provide
29:19 - like spotify and audible
29:21 - because when people ask me about um if i
29:24 - want to make money
29:25 - out of the app store my first thoughts
29:27 - are like i want to create
29:29 - because i mean code with chris is a
29:30 - content-based business i'm thinking
29:32 - content right i'm thinking
29:34 - oh i'll create an app that has a lot of
29:37 - valuable content
29:38 - and i would charge a subscription for it
29:41 - but obviously
29:42 - content-based businesses or sorry apps i
29:44 - think also have downsides so i'd like to
29:46 - get your input on
29:48 - content or not i love content-based
29:50 - businesses i just think it requires a
29:52 - lot like
29:52 - you know because we're both sort of in a
29:54 - content based
29:56 - business you got to keep creating the
29:57 - content so it's not just one of these
29:59 - things
30:00 - like a fine hidden objects thing i have
30:03 - a friend of mine that does a sleep
30:05 - sounds
30:05 - app that does pretty well in the app
30:07 - store like
30:09 - you know above 50k a month in simple
30:12 - designs
30:12 - and he doesn't have to create much more
30:15 - content
30:16 - as long as the functionality is there so
30:17 - if with a content base
30:19 - i think it's a great model i just think
30:21 - it's more of an active
30:23 - income rather than a passive one so if
30:24 - you're looking for a passive one that
30:25 - you can sort of just
30:26 - let it out there and kind of stay back
30:29 - then
30:30 - you know these type of apps are the ones
30:31 - that are better but
30:33 - one of the things to keep users engaged
30:35 - is to create new content so i think
30:37 - i guess i'm contradicting myself at the
30:39 - same sentence but like you're
30:40 - always going to need to create new
30:42 - content regardless but i like the
30:44 - content if you can do it
30:45 - yeah i mean there there's a big
30:47 - difference because a content based
30:48 - business is
30:49 - you're creating a lot of content whereas
30:51 - the other types of apps i
30:52 - i think with it goes without saying that
30:54 - if you just let your app go stale
30:57 - um things change right rankings change
31:00 - competitors pop up and stuff so you kind
31:01 - of have to be staying on top of it
31:03 - so it's not completely passive but it's
31:06 - more passive than actively working for
31:08 - for someone so yeah anyways that's
31:11 - awesome
31:12 - steve i'm so glad that we had this call
31:14 - because
31:16 - i don't have any sort of content like
31:18 - this i don't
31:19 - it's not really my expertise so i'm so
31:21 - glad that you reached out
