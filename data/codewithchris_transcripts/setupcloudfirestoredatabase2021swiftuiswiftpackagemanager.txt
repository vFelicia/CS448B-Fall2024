00:00 - Last week I released a Firestore Setup
tutorial, but little did I know
00:04 - the Firebase SDK is now compatible
with Swift Package Manager.
00:08 - If you didn't know,
the Swift Package Manager helps you add
00:12 - manage third party code libraries with
your Xcode project, among other things.
00:16 - But the nice thing about
Swift Package Manager is that it's
00:19 - integrated right into Xcode,
so it's a smooth and easy process to use.
00:23 - This video is a rerecording
00:25 - of that Firestore Setup tutorial using
Swift Package Manager this time.
00:30 - If you're just interested
in the Swift Package Manager section,
00:33 - check in the description below for the
time stamp and jump straight there.
00:36 - Otherwise we're gonna
start from the beginning.
00:39 - Firestore is a free remote database
solution for your mobile app using.
00:44 - It allows you to do cool things like
letting your users create accounts,
00:48 - saving user generated data, and syncing
data across devices just to name a few.
00:53 - This video is a guide on how to start
using Firestore Database for your iOS app,
00:59 - you'll learn how to set up a new Firebase
project with a new Firestore database
01:03 - instance, you'll learn how to add
the Firebase SDK to your Xcode project
01:07 - and you'll learn how to use
Swift Package Manager.
01:10 - By the end of this tutorial,
01:12 - you'll be ready to harness
the power of Firestore database.
01:15 - Hey, code crew, my name is Chris and I've
01:18 - been teaching Beginners how
to code and build app since 2013.
01:22 - If you're brand new to app development
01:24 - and you're just starting out on a journey,
check out our 14 day Beginner challenge.
01:28 - It's the best place to start.
01:29 - In fact, we have a community full
01:31 - of people who are on the same journey
taking the exact same challenge.
01:35 - So definitely check that out with that
said, let's dive into today's topic.
01:40 - First, let's take a look at the bigger
01:43 - picture here's how your app is going
to interact with the Firestore database.
01:47 - First of all, Fireface is a platform
that you can go and create a project on.
01:51 - When you do that,
01:52 - you'll get your own Firebase project,
which also has a Firestore database.
01:56 - Your Firestore database is in the cloud so
that your data is accessible from anywhere
02:00 - as long as you have
the address to the database.
02:03 - Those details are stored
02:04 - in a configuration file called
the GoogleService Info Plist file.
02:09 - And yes, in case you didn't know,
Firebase is owned by Google.
02:13 - Next, you have your Xcode project,
02:14 - which you're planning to use
with your Firestore database.
02:17 - So in order for your Xcode project to know
02:20 - where to read data from and to write data
to it needs to know the address of your
02:25 - database and that's where
that configuration file comes in.
02:28 - You drag and drop that configuration file
into your Xcode project,
02:32 - and now it has the details to connect
to your Firestore database.
02:35 - Alright, so now your Xcode project knows
02:38 - where your database is,
but how do you actually write the Swift
02:41 - code to interact with it, such as reading
data from it, writing data to it.
02:47 - Well, Firebase has made that easy for us
by writing all the code already for us
02:52 - and giving us a bunch
of classes that we can use.
02:55 - We just have to supply the data that we
want to put into the database or maybe
03:00 - the query if we're trying
to retrieve data from it.
03:03 - Oh, and we also have to handle
any potential errors as well.
03:08 - In part two of this series,
you'll learn to do all of that for now.
03:12 - We're interested in adding these Firebase
classes to our Xcode project so we can use
03:17 - them to interact with our
Firestore database.
03:19 - These classes are collectively
known as the Firebase SDK.
03:24 - There are a couple of ways to add
the Firebase SDK to our Xcode project,
03:28 - but in this tutorial we'll be using
the Swift Package Manager,
03:31 - which helps us add and manage
thirdparty libraries for Xcode, so
03:36 - that's at a high level how Firebase works,
Firebase is known as a backend as
03:41 - a service, and that means that a lot
of the infrastructure and nitty gritty
03:45 - details of database management
and setup are handled for you.
03:48 - Things like load balancing and database
replication are all invisible to you,
03:53 - and all you need to care about
is your data and your app.
03:56 - Now, the other nice thing about Firebase
03:58 - is that it's got a bunch of other services
that you can use in addition to Firestore,
04:02 - things like analytics, messaging,
authentication and more.
04:06 - So if one of these features catches your
04:09 - eye and you are interested in learning
more about it and you'd like me to create
04:13 - a tutorial for it,
drop me a comment below.
04:15 - The last thing I want to mention is
04:17 - that we can use all of these things
for free until we hit bigger numbers.
04:20 - All right, let's dive into how to set
up Firestore database for our iOS app.
04:25 - Alright, so let's create our
brand new Xcode project.
04:28 - Let's click on create a new Xcode project.
04:31 - Under is let's choose App
04:33 - and I'm going to call this Firestore Demo
SPM for Swift Package Manager.
04:40 - Take note of this bundle Identifier.
04:43 - We'll get a chance to copy and paste this
04:45 - later because we're going to need
this to set up our Firebase project.
04:49 - Make sure your interface is Swift UI life
cycle is Swift UI app and your language is
04:53 - Swift and you can leave core
data and tests unchecked.
04:56 - Let's choose where we want to save this.
04:59 - I'm going to create this on my desktop.
05:02 - All right.
05:03 - And there's our brand new Xcode project.
05:05 - Now, if you click on this root node here
in the File Navigator,
05:10 - you're going to get a chance to copy this,
which I'm going to do right now.
05:13 - Next we're going to go
over to Firebase Google.
05:16 - Com and set up our Firebase project
using this bundle Identifier.
05:20 - So here we are at Firebase Google.
05:24 - Com and you need a Google
account to use this for free.
05:28 - If you have one, log in to it
in the upper right corner.
05:31 - I'm already logged in.
So I'm just going to click go to console.
05:34 - That's where we're going to see
all of your Firebase project.
05:36 - So you can see I have
a bunch of demo ones.
05:38 - I'm going to start a brand new one
just for the sake of this demo.
05:42 - So click Add project and you can
name it anything you'd like.
05:45 - Let's call it Firestore SPM demo
and click continue.
05:51 - Now, Google Analytics would be great
05:54 - for a project that you are planning
to ship into the App store.
05:57 - But for this demo, I am going to turn
it off because we don't need it.
06:00 - So let's go ahead and create the project.
06:02 - Now it's going to take a minute or two
06:04 - for it to create your project, but we've
just sped that up in post production.
06:08 - So now we are going to set up
and configure our Firebase project so
06:15 - that we can point our Xcode
project to this instance.
06:18 - Click on iOS right here.
06:20 - And this is where we are going
to paste in our project bundle ID.
06:25 - I had copied it from Xcode,
so I'm just going to paste it here.
06:28 - But just to remind you,
06:30 - if we look into our Xcode project,
you click this root node right here.
06:34 - This is what you are looking for.
So copy that.
06:37 - Paste it in there.
06:38 - You can go ahead and fill in some of these
06:40 - optional things if you need to,
I'm going to register the app.
06:43 - The next thing that's going to do is
06:45 - generate a configuration file for us
to download and add to our Xcode project.
06:51 - So let's go ahead and download this
GoogleService info plist and that's going
06:55 - to contain the details to point to
this Firestore instance.
06:59 - Now I actually already
have one on my desktop.
07:01 - So that's why it's named it like this.
07:03 - Why don't I go ahead
and delete that first?
07:06 - And so
07:08 - it's got to be named this
Google Service info.
07:12 - Otherwise it's not going to work.
07:14 - It's going to it's not going to be able
07:17 - to successfully find
this configuration file.
07:19 - So let's save it on my desktop and we are
07:23 - going to click and drag that file
into our Xcode project.
07:26 - So let's go back to our
Xcode project right here.
07:29 - And depending on where you saved it,
07:31 - go ahead and drag that Google Service
infoplist into your project.
07:37 - Now I'm going to put it right there
under or above the Info P list
07:43 - and just make sure that you have copy
items that's needed is checked so
07:47 - that it's going to make a copy
of it inside your project folder.
07:51 - This is also very important.
Add to targets.
07:53 - Make sure this is checked.
07:54 - So
07:56 - there it is.
This contains all of the information
07:59 - my project needs to know in order
to point to this Firebase project.
08:03 - So let's go ahead and click next.
08:05 - Now we're going to add the Firebase SDK
into our Xcode project, and remember,
08:10 - these are the code libraries that our
project can use to call different
08:15 - functions and methods to interact
with the Firebase platform.
08:19 - Now what you see here are the instructions
08:22 - for Cocoa Pods, but we're not
going to do that in this tutorial.
08:24 - We're going to use Swift Package Manager.
08:26 - So go ahead and click this link.
08:28 - It's going to give you some documentation
08:30 - for it, but all you really
need to know is this URL.
08:33 - So go ahead and click this to copy it,
08:35 - because this is going to be
that reference to the Firebase SDK.
08:40 - This is helpful if you don't know how
08:43 - to use this with Package Manager,
it just tells you where to find this menu
08:47 - option inside Xcode, but we're going
to do that right now together.
08:51 - Go to Xcode and then
under file Swift packages
08:58 - add package dependency and you're going to
paste that URL in there and click next.
09:05 - That's going to take a couple of seconds.
09:07 - Recommends you to leave it as is up
09:10 - to the next major version,
and you click next and it's going to fetch
09:15 - all of the available modules
because Firebase contains a lot
09:20 - of different features and you
might not need all of that code.
09:24 - So in this instance where
09:26 - interested in using Firestore database, so
that's the only module we're gonna add.
09:30 - So we're gonna look at that in a second
and give it some time to go.
09:34 - But I want to go back to this
09:36 - documentation for just a second because I
do want to note that if you want to use
09:41 - this method to install Firebase SDK,
you're going to need Xcode 12.5 or higher.
09:46 - Right.
So just a note.
09:47 - Let's go back.
Okay.
09:49 - So it's ready now.
09:51 - These are all of the different
09:53 - different components you can add.
09:56 - We're going to scroll down
and look for Fire store now.
10:00 - For some reason in this version of Xcode,
10:03 - at least I can't really expand these
different sections,
10:06 - but I can tell you that what I believe
this one to be is beta, right.
10:12 - So we probably don't want to install that.
10:14 - This is the only thing we need.
10:16 - Firebase Firestore
10:18 - it's unfortunate that I can't really
expand any of these things to see.
10:24 - Okay, so we're going to make sure
10:26 - that that is checked and we're going to
click finish and grabbing it right here.
10:32 - You're going to see.
10:33 - In addition to Firestore,
10:35 - it's also grabbed all of these other
dependencies that it needs to work.
10:39 - And just like that,
10:40 - we've added the Firebase SDK, at least
for the Firestore bits that we need.
10:47 - What we're going to do now is just build
the project to make sure that it runs.
10:51 - I'm going to switch
similar to iphone Twelve.
10:53 - I'm going to press Command B to build
10:55 - the project and make sure
that it happen successfully.
10:59 - Now this actually might take quite
11:01 - a while, depending on your
machine and how fast it is.
11:04 - It could take up to a couple of minutes,
but hopefully it results in success.
11:09 - Alright.
11:10 - So we're looking good.
11:13 - Now let's go back to the setup steps here
and we're going to click next because
11:19 - we've already just added the Firebase SDK,
and the next thing we need to do is add
11:25 - two lines of code, import Firebase
and Firebase app dot configure.
11:29 - Now in this code app, it right here.
11:31 - It's not meant for a Swift UI project
11:34 - because it has the class app delegate,
but in Swift I
11:38 - if you create a new Swift I project,
you might find that you don't have that.
11:42 - That's okay because you can still
do that in this file right here.
11:46 - So instead of the app delegate file,
11:49 - you do that right here and you put import
Firebase,
11:53 - and then you might also find that you
don't have this method right here called
11:57 - application did finish
launching with options.
12:00 - So what we're going to do instead is
12:03 - inside this opening curly
bracket right here.
12:07 - We're going to create an init method
which will automatically be run
12:14 - when your app gets initialized, and we're
going to put that line of code in there.
12:20 - Let's click that.
12:22 - Copy that to clipboard
and put it right there.
12:25 - And just to double check,
you can set a Breakpoint right there
12:29 - and you can run your project and make
sure that it hits that Breakpoint.
12:33 - If you're new to break points.
12:34 - This is just a way for you to stop
the execution of code at that specific
12:40 - line of code, and then you can
do various things like debug.
12:44 - What's going on?
Great for troubleshooting.
12:47 - So here it's hit our Breakpoint,
12:49 - meaning that it is about
to run this line of code.
12:53 - So I'm just going to click
continue execution
12:56 - and our program runs,
12:59 - and we've just connected our Xcode project
to our Firebase project right here.
13:05 - Let's click on next and then
continue to console.
13:08 - So now our setup is complete.
13:10 - Let us set up our Firestore database.
13:13 - If we go over to the left hand
side here Firestore database.
13:17 - We're simply going to hit Create database.
13:21 - Now it's going to ask us to start
in production or test mode.
13:24 - We're going to go ahead and start in test
13:26 - mode, which essentially will allow anyone
who has the data contained in the Google
13:32 - service Info file a reference
to this instance.
13:36 - They're going to be able to write
to our Firestore database.
13:40 - Now that's definitely not what you want
13:42 - in production, but for demos
and for testing and things like that.
13:46 - This is great.
13:47 - It also puts a time stamp on it,
so it's automatically going to close
13:52 - itself off at a certain time because it it
doesn't want you to indefinitely leave
13:57 - public databases, readable
and writable to anyone indefinitely.
14:02 - So it's going to put
a time stamp on there.
14:04 - And you can change that if you need
more time or anything like that.
14:07 - But we're going to start in test mode.
14:09 - Choose the closest location to you.
14:12 - You can change this after the fact.
14:14 - Sothere you have it.
14:16 - We have our brand new empty Firestore
database ready to be used and we have our
14:21 - Xcode project with the Firebase SDK
added to it.
14:24 - It's pointing to this Firebase instance
14:27 - and it's ready to interact
with this database.
14:32 - Alright, so you set up your new Firestore
14:35 - database and you're ready to go
in the next part of this series,
14:38 - I'll show you how to read and write
data to your new database.
14:41 - That part of the series is
coming out on September 20.
14:44 - So if you're watching this and it's
14:46 - already past that date,
then keep watching because I'll link
14:49 - to that part two in the end
screen of this video.
14:52 - Now, before we end off this video,
14:54 - quick shout out to my CWC plus program
in there, we have a Swift UI Databases
14:59 - course where we build full fledged app
using Firestore database and core data.
15:02 - So definitely check that out
if you're interested.
15:05 - Lastly, if you enjoyed this video and you
want to see more,
15:08 - consider subscribing to the channel
