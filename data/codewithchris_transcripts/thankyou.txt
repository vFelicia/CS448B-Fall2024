00:00 - thank you I can't express how grateful I
00:03 - am for your constant support and an
00:05 - encouragement through these years it was
00:07 - around this time of year when I released
00:09 - my very first youtube video back in 2013
00:12 - and I remember feeling so nervous like
00:14 - how people would judge me the way I
00:15 - looked the way I talked the way I acted
00:18 - but I published that video anyways and
00:20 - I'm so glad that I did because that
00:22 - allowed us to connect and that one
00:24 - little video started a snowball that
00:27 - grew and grew to the point where code
00:30 - with Chris is what it is today when I
00:32 - reflect back on 2019 it's been the best
00:35 - year yet for coach Chris growth wise
00:37 - team wise financially but I can't help
00:41 - but feel like I'm kind of missing the
00:43 - point along the way on this journey of
00:45 - growth I think I lost something you know
00:49 - back when I first started it was simple
00:51 - and it was great I loved creating these
00:53 - videos and chatting with you guys like
00:54 - this but then as the channel started to
00:57 - grow I started having trouble keeping up
00:59 - with everything I got more comments on
01:01 - YouTube and my blog people started
01:03 - emailing me and when I finally released
01:06 - my paid courses which made everything
01:07 - financially viable I committed to
01:09 - personally helping those people who join
01:12 - my course to succeed however at some
01:14 - point it became a business it turned
01:16 - into my full-time job and don't get me
01:18 - wrong I'm so happy and grateful for that
01:20 - because it's allowed me to wake up every
01:23 - day feeling motivated and loving what I
01:24 - do and it's all because of the support
01:27 - from you guys but the thing is when it
01:29 - became a business there was a mental
01:30 - shift in my head and I started worrying
01:32 - about things like business development
01:34 - marketing building a team outreach and
01:38 - to be honest I still don't really know
01:40 - what I'm doing but completely
01:42 - unintentionally as each year passed I
01:45 - became more and more obsessed with the
01:47 - business side of things
01:48 - because I didn't have it figured out I
01:50 - didn't know anything about how to run or
01:52 - grow a successful business but I loved
01:54 - to learn so it was a challenge for me it
01:56 - was exciting it was kind of like solving
01:59 - a puzzle it was fun to learn about
02:01 - branding marketing acquiring customers
02:03 - and all that sort of stuff the problem
02:05 - was that because there was so much to
02:07 - learn and so much to implement I was
02:09 - jumping from one thing to the next and
02:11 - I'm sure some of you
02:12 - can relate to that you get really
02:14 - excited about something and you dive
02:16 - right in only for next week to get
02:18 - excited about something else and then
02:20 - you completely drop the first thing so
02:21 - that was me for a while and I was really
02:23 - frustrated and I was hard on myself
02:25 - about it
02:26 - fast forward to 2019 and this is the
02:28 - first year that I felt like I had some
02:30 - sort of direction my youngest daughter
02:32 - became old enough to send to daycare and
02:34 - Ellen joined me on Team Code with Chris
02:37 - she's really the one that keeps me on
02:38 - track and focused and then early in 2019
02:42 - we also brought on a couple more team
02:44 - members to help out with various aspects
02:46 - of code with Chris it's taken a while to
02:48 - learn to work together as a team and to
02:50 - build trust with each other but it is
02:53 - slowly happening and for the first time
02:55 - in a very long time I'm feeling very
02:57 - positive because I don't feel stuck or
02:59 - torn between whether I should wear my
03:02 - developer hat or my business hat with
03:05 - the team doing their thing I can get
03:07 - back to focusing on doing what I love
03:09 - which is coding and sharing with you
03:11 - guys
03:11 - it might sound simple but honestly I
03:14 - think that's what made code with Chris
03:15 - so special back in those early days if I
03:18 - wanted to create a video than I would do
03:19 - it I wouldn't care about how many views
03:21 - it would get or you know if someone else
03:24 - had done a video on that already things
03:27 - were a lot simpler so I'm sorry for
03:28 - being so long-winded but I'm just
03:30 - feeling really touched and thankful for
03:32 - you guys I'm really hanging in there
03:34 - while I figured this stuff out I feel
03:36 - like saying that I'm back but you know
03:38 - I've never really gone anywhere but
03:40 - mentally it's a huge shift let me tell
03:43 - you my high level goals for code with
03:45 - Chris this year are simple I want to
03:47 - code more and I want to encourage more
03:49 - people to start coding and get their
03:51 - feet wet I've got a lot of ideas and fun
03:53 - challenges that I think can get a lot of
03:56 - you guys participating especially for
03:58 - those of you who have just been watching
04:00 - but have not actually started coding yet
04:03 - and I'll share those ideas with you in
04:05 - the coming weeks in closing I'm really
04:07 - looking forward to this year where I
04:08 - hope to connect with you guys on a
04:10 - deeper level I hope you guys had a great
04:12 - 2019 and I wish you a monstrous 2020
04:15 - where you're going to achieve everything
04:17 - that you want thank you for being here
04:19 - and listening to me ramble supporting me
04:21 - and encouraging me
04:23 - talk soon
