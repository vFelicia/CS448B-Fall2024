00:00 - if you're 100 a figma beginner and want to learn 
how to design an app in figma then this video is  
00:06 - for you hey code chris jason here and welcome back 
to the channel if you've been here for quite some  
00:10 - time then you've probably encountered several app 
design tutorials from us most especially the figma  
00:16 - tutorial that was released two years ago in 2020 
now this video is going to be an updated version  
00:20 - of that tutorial because it's been two years and 
figma's evolved and has made a lot of changes to  
00:25 - the software which would make it very attractive 
for you if you want to learn more about designing  
00:30 - user interfaces and figma so in this video we'll 
take a tour around the figma user interface  
00:36 - learn the different features or tools that can 
help you create an app design and in the end we'll  
00:41 - design one screen using the tools that i'll be 
discussing later on so without further ado let's  
00:46 - move on to the video so first of all why figma 
there's already a lot of design and prototyping  
00:52 - tools out there but why figma well first of 
all it's free so right here i'm in the pricing  
00:57 - page of the figma website and they have like three 
plans for p for everyone they have the starter the  
01:02 - professional and organization plan so they offer 
a lot of features but even if you're a free user  
01:08 - you can already have three figma files unlimited 
personal files unlimited collaborators plugins and  
01:15 - templates like access to plugins and templates 
and also you'll be able to access their mobile app  
01:19 - which you can use to like view and test your 
designs second is that it's browser-based so  
01:25 - there's no need to download their app so 
they have an app that you can download  
01:29 - like a desktop client that you can download but 
there's no need to use it because the browser  
01:35 - version is already good enough in itself third 
is the wide variety of plugins that can help you  
01:40 - design more efficiently so plugins vary from 
being able to help you organize your files  
01:45 - plugins that help you come up with icons plugins 
that help you come up with images and so on  
01:50 - so these things you don't have to start from 
scratch knowing that there are already available  
01:55 - plugins that can help you achieve these things so 
fourth is the collaboration features that may be  
02:00 - useful if you want to ask for feedback with your 
design so figma primarily is a collaboration tool  
02:07 - so right here you can see their selling point is 
that nothing great is made alone so it emphasizes  
02:12 - on the collaboration features that they have 
that some tools out there don't necessarily have  
02:16 - so figma right here is like you can think of figma 
as like a google docs for design uh you can see  
02:23 - right here um this is a sample interface of figma 
as you can see right here there are two users in  
02:29 - this figma file and they are collaborating 
simultaneously on one figma file or design  
02:35 - file so that's why we really recommend figma if 
you want to like um use it with your friends or  
02:40 - co-workers and all those things so as for us we've 
been using figma here at code with chris for years  
02:46 - and we absolutely love how it works such as the 
file organization and collaboration features  
02:51 - as for me i've only been using figma for the past 
two years and before that i was using adobe xd and  
02:58 - envision studio and i don't think i'll ever look 
back with the experience that i now have with  
03:03 - figma and because i've only been using this app 
for two years i think you can think of me as a  
03:09 - relatively beginner user so i can show you your 
way around figma with a beginner's perspective  
03:15 - now to access figma all you need to do is to go 
to figma.com and sign up for an account right here  
03:20 - you can sign up by email so it's 
really an easy experience from here  
03:24 - once you have an account you'll be automatically 
redirected to the figma dashboard and from there  
03:29 - you can create a design file and voila welcome to 
your canvas so voila here we are at our dashboard  
03:36 - so here we're going to rename this file as 
figma practice so from here we're going to  
03:43 - take a tour around the figma user interface 
as you can see right here and i'm not going to  
03:49 - dive into the details about each tool 
so i'll just give you a brief overview  
03:53 - and after that we're going to like redesign an 
app and as we do that we'll dive into like the  
03:58 - common tools tips and techniques that are used 
in the design so as you can see right here so  
04:04 - so in here in the top um section is like your 
menu bar so here we have the figma button so  
04:11 - this is our like um figma related actions so 
you can see file edit view object these are all  
04:17 - like figma related options or settings so you 
don't really have to worry about most of them  
04:23 - most of the time except for like the plugins in 
which case um you may may use often than not so  
04:30 - as you can see right here i have lots 
of plugins that help me with my design  
04:34 - so preferences um basically i don't think you also 
need to worry about these things except if you  
04:40 - want to like change the theme of your figma ui so 
if you want a dark interface or a light interface  
04:46 - something like that but let's keep it in the 
default just for this video so light and then  
04:53 - get desktop up and help an account so these are 
all self-explanatory but again as i mentioned you  
04:59 - really don't need to worry about most of them 
most of the time all right so next one is the  
05:02 - move and scale tool so the move is basically 
your way of moving around the user interface  
05:08 - and the scale allows you to resize objects so 
for this one let's say for example we have a  
05:13 - rectangle and we want to scale this proportionally 
if we want to do that then let's we're going to  
05:20 - press k as a shortcut and once we have 
that you can see this double edged arrow  
05:26 - as you can see right here so this is the normal 
arrow if you want to resize it it's a normal  
05:31 - two-sided arrows but if we want to if we're 
going to scale for you to know that you are  
05:36 - scale there's like four arrows like two on each 
side so that means that you are um enabling the  
05:43 - scale option so right there scaling it lower 
and bigger it's just basically a proportion  
05:49 - right there so if you want to go back just press 
v and right here as you can see your move cursor  
05:56 - so next is our so i'm going to delete this 
if you want to delete anything just press the  
06:01 - object and press backspace or delete so next 
one is our frame tool so frame is like the  
06:07 - most one of the most common elements used to 
create an app design so frame and frame is like  
06:14 - here so if you click on frame you'll basically 
you'll have a lot of presets frame presets on  
06:21 - the right side so you have like the phone 
tablet desktop and all those things so  
06:27 - basically what these means that these things are 
the dimension of the screen size of each device  
06:33 - so if you click on like frame oh sorry if you 
click on frame and click on iphone 13 pro max  
06:40 - then basically you have a frame like or like an 
artboard or a canvas the size of the iphone 13 pro  
06:47 - max so this is like the exact um screen dimensions 
of that device particular device and for the slice  
06:53 - tool this is one of the most like one of the 
lesser known or lesser used tools in figma so  
06:59 - i don't think you need to worry about this i i 
don't think i've ever used it before as well so  
07:05 - no need to worry about this as well so next one is 
the shapes the shapes are here the shapes are like  
07:11 - the building blocks of the user interfaces like 
apps are built around shapes like um rectangles  
07:18 - which are basically your buttons your menu 
icons or something like that basically  
07:24 - they are shapes that were like modified to make 
it look like an icon or something like that but  
07:30 - that's something that's quite advanced 
so don't worry about that right now  
07:35 - the main purpose of shapes like i mentioned is 
like they help you create the building blocks of  
07:42 - user interface like buttons icons and all those 
things and basically sections like on top section  
07:49 - or a menu section right here so let's change the 
color and something like that just a little accent  
07:56 - on your app design so we'll dive into the details 
later on but basically that's how shapes work  
08:01 - so shapes you can they have a variety of shapes 
to a shape if that makes sense or a polygon so you  
08:08 - have the option to create a line so if you press 
line or press the l and you like drag it anywhere  
08:15 - you'll form a line right there so if you let go 
you'll now you have a line so if you want if so  
08:21 - you don't need to worry about creating um straight 
line because if you created it something like this  
08:26 - you can always just set the angle to zero so now 
you have a straight line so if you want it to be  
08:33 - like vertical you can just change it to 90 and 
you're done so let's delete that and then you  
08:39 - have an ellipse which is basically a circle and an 
arrow that arrow like hit like this is basically  
08:46 - a line with an arrow on the on the edge 
which is basically self-explanatory again  
08:53 - so again polygon so this one you can customize 
the size of this um shape so we here we have our  
09:02 - yeah over here we have like three sides or three 
corners so if you want it to be four now you  
09:08 - have a diamond five pentagon all those things 
so basically it's very customizable so if you  
09:14 - want a custom shape just go to the polygon tool 
and start self-explanatory and place image oops
09:24 - place image is basically a way for 
you to import images in your canvas  
09:28 - so i usually don't open this drop down and place 
an image what i do is just you can just drag and  
09:34 - drop from your desktop to your figma canvas you 
can drag and drop items there or you can also do  
09:40 - a command shift k like like like that and it you 
can easily import images from there so pen tool  
09:47 - is pencil is basically it kind of requires like 
immediate experience or a bit of experience in  
09:52 - figma because even i am not well versed with the 
pen tool so basically this is your way to draw  
09:58 - so to draw things like um for example like this or 
basically like blobs basically those elements like  
10:09 - to that add some styles in your design so 
that's how pen tool works and yeah it kind  
10:16 - of requires a little bit of experience for 
you to like get familiar with the pen tool  
10:21 - but with the app that or with this practice 
video um we won't be diving into so much about  
10:27 - the around the pen tool so we'll be mostly using 
the shape so no need to worry about that for now  
10:33 - a pencil pencil is basically a way for you to 
like if you want to draw like arrows like that  
10:40 - basically um you can do that so pencil tool is 
something that is also not used as much if you are  
10:48 - going to design an app screen or an app ui so you 
won't be using the pen tool or the pencil tools  
10:55 - as much as the shapes so no need to worry about 
these things as well but yeah it pays to know  
11:00 - how these things work so the text tool again 
here text and you can type the quick brown fox  
11:08 - just like that so you can click 
on text or just shortcut key t  
11:15 - and just type in like that and yeah so the hand 
tool is basically lets you move around the canvas  
11:24 - as well so it's just like the move tool but the 
hand tool is basically lets you move around like  
11:29 - this so if you have like multiple designs this is 
a good way for you to navigate to those on designs  
11:36 - so you can also the shortcut for the hand tool is 
h so let's cancel that so h hand tool or you can  
11:44 - also press space or hold space and while you're 
holding that you can like just move around so this  
11:50 - is my approach to the hand tool because it's also 
the same approach with other design tools as well  
11:56 - yeah so this one comments basically 
for collaboration features if you want  
11:59 - to comment here just click on the comment 
or c hotkey c and type in this looks good
12:08 - and there you go and you now have generated 
a comment in the design and basically anyone  
12:14 - who is invited to this file will be able 
to preview your comment just like that  
12:20 - let's delete this or basically um resolve and here 
are just your profile share if you want to share  
12:28 - your file to other people and then you play if you 
want to preview this as a prototype so here is the  
12:34 - play like this is what it would look like in an 
actual device your your app design here is your  
12:40 - basically your zoom on settings uh if this is like 
a 50 zoom and all those things so on your right on  
12:47 - your left side rather you have your layers and 
assault assets panel so layers are basically  
12:53 - how your objects are stacked on top of each other 
so if you have here the rectangle you have the  
12:58 - rectangle one if you are going to copy and paste 
or if you're going to duplicate this so ctrl  
13:04 - c and control v now you have rectangle two 
so rectangle two is basically on top of  
13:09 - rectangle one so that's how layers work so 
you're like a very beginner knowledge here  
13:15 - so if you want to like change the color of that 
just to emphasize on how these layers work so here  
13:23 - um underneath this um rectangle two is rectangle 
one so that's how layers work so as you practice  
13:31 - more you'll get the hang of things but yeah 
this is how layers work so if we group them
13:40 - they are basically combined as one layer so it but 
yeah this the group the group itself is one layer  
13:47 - but underneath that group is the rectangle 
one rectangle two which are still on like  
13:54 - in different layers so if that makes sense um i 
hope it does all right so page basically if you  
14:03 - have like multiple files like for example page 
two so for page one for example this can be your  
14:09 - ideas and this page two can be your design so if 
you want to like stay organized the page one can  
14:16 - be ideas page two will be your actual design 
or you can just put both ideas and the designs  
14:22 - in one page there's also uh there's nothing wrong 
with that and for the assets these are stuff from  
14:29 - like components so if you're a beginner like me 
when i started out i never i almost never like  
14:35 - access this pat assets panel because these 
are like most of the time um components like  
14:42 - were housed in this panel and like any other 
assets like i think images i can't remember but  
14:48 - mostly these are like for images icons basically 
components stuff that that really doesn't concern  
14:56 - on most beginners especially me when i was 
starting out when i was just practicing figma i  
15:01 - was more concerned about utilizing the bare bones 
um functionality of figma which is designing the  
15:07 - designing an app and basically get things done 
so assets for now you don't need to worry about  
15:13 - these things so let's delete this so next on 
your right is your design prototype and inspect  
15:19 - panel so design is basically for example let's 
create an object again like a shape rectangle  
15:26 - so when you click on this the design panel will 
give you a lot of options so here is your x  
15:32 - y position so 84 basically means that they are 84 
points on the x axis so if you place that to zero  
15:41 - then it will like be placed on the zero the x-axis 
of the frame that it's in so right now because  
15:51 - it's inside this frame right here if you click 
on zero um basically it will be placed on the  
15:58 - very edge of that frame which is this iphone frame 
so the same goes for if we put zero on the y axis  
16:06 - it will go to the very top just like that so 
that's how x and y axis work in sigma and this  
16:13 - is basically width and the height of the shape or 
the rectangle so if we customize this right here  
16:19 - so if you hover over this w letter you'll see the 
like the double edged arrow and if you drag it  
16:27 - just you can just like customize the width 
of the shape and same goes for the height  
16:34 - you can just like customize it just like that or 
you can just input a number whichever you want  
16:41 - and here is like your proportion setting 
or constraint proportion if you want to  
16:46 - scale the object just as like what we did earlier 
so this is also another way so if you want to  
16:53 - scale it proportionately click on constrain 
proportions once this is enabled whenever you  
16:58 - like customize the numbers in here like for 
example if we customize the make this 200  
17:05 - basically adding another 100 in the height 
then the width will also have like like  
17:12 - double so basically we we made the height 
doubled so the width was also doubled in  
17:19 - the in value so if we make the height again of 
this like double it double the height to 400  
17:25 - then the width will also be doubled to 600 and all 
those things so that's how constrained proportions  
17:29 - work so basically it mostly concerns um adjusting 
whenever you adjust the settings right here so  
17:36 - here the angle the corner radius if you 
want to adjust the corner radius make  
17:42 - this a rounded rectangle this is where you'll 
do it so corner radius just drag it like that  
17:50 - so the bigger the object the more corner 
radius you'll need if you want it to look  
17:56 - like a rounded rectangle so if this is 
like a 50 in height let's set this to zero  
18:04 - so if this is 50 in height if it's just 
a small object a corner radius of maybe  
18:09 - 20 is good enough to make it look like a rounded 
rectangle or even like eight yeah just like that  
18:17 - um we now have like a corner radius set 
to eight and it look it already looks like  
18:22 - a rounded rectangle so here constraints on 
constraints is basically where your i would  
18:28 - like to interpret this as a way where your where 
the object attaches itself to like for example  
18:34 - um the object rectangle one is inside this iphone 
13 frame right so if our cons if our constraints  
18:43 - are set to left and top whenever we resize this 
um frame then the object itself will remain at  
18:50 - the left and will basically attach itself to 
the left and the top um sides of the frame  
18:57 - so if we change the so if we change the size of 
this frame on the right side then it won't move  
19:04 - at all even if we change it to the bottom it won't 
move at all but whenever we change it to the left  
19:10 - as you can see right now it's it is attaching 
itself to the left side of the frame i hope that  
19:17 - makes sense um so yeah um right here and goes to 
the top it it's basically attached to the left and  
19:25 - the top part so yeah that's how those things 
works that's how i'd like to interpret things  
19:31 - um scale for now for scale if we want 
to like change this size so something  
19:37 - like that then basically it will follow 
the scale of that frame that it's in
19:44 - okay so next one is a fixed position when 
scrolling this basically an interaction  
19:49 - feature you don't need to worry about this 
these are blending modes so also if you don't  
19:55 - this is quite also like a little bit of familiar 
knowledge with blending types but for now we don't  
20:02 - need to worry about these things blending modes 
transparency of the object so set to 50 those  
20:07 - things and then these are the color options so 
i've been using this a while ago so by now you've  
20:15 - probably been familiar with how these things 
work so just select the object and the fill  
20:21 - and right here you can change the color to 
whatever you want and then you also you can also  
20:26 - enable like linear gradients um radial gradients 
and all those types of gradients or you can also  
20:32 - add an image and upload an image just like that 
that's also possible and then stroke is basically  
20:40 - allows you to add a border or a stroke 
around your object or any kind of object  
20:47 - so here basically where your stroke is positioned 
in so if it's center inside or outside that frame  
20:54 - and the effects is basically your drop 
shadows so these are some things that  
20:59 - you can play around with as you gain more um 
familiarity with the design tool or design  
21:05 - approaches so but for now we don't need to worry 
about this thing so export is basically if you  
21:10 - want to export your file and upload it to 
a website or something or a social media  
21:16 - you can just basically export this export to 
jpeg now you'll have an image of your app design  
21:22 - so that's the figma user interface all right so 
now that we know the basic functions of each tool  
21:28 - in the user interface let's try to create a simple 
app design using what we've learned so far so  
21:33 - we'll be redesigning a symbol to do this app that 
i found here so this is an app called tictic so  
21:40 - this is an existing app and it's one of the most 
or not really one of the most but a more popular  
21:46 - um to-do list apps out there so some youtubers 
out there are using tiktek because it's a very  
21:51 - simple to do this app right here as you can see 
um so we'll be copying or redesigning this app  
21:58 - from scratch so let's just copy this image 
so right click copy image and just paste it  
22:03 - here so now we have that one now we have an 
image as our reference so let's delete this  
22:11 - frame oops it's frame so let's click on the frame 
door or press f and select um iphone 13 pro max  
22:19 - or iphone 13. um i guess i'll just 
move forward with iphone 13 from here  
22:26 - we'll let's just crop this image first because um 
i'm a bit distracted with this um second device  
22:33 - image on the background so to crop this you can 
just hold command if you're on a mac hold command  
22:41 - um or control then just drag it like that 
and now you're just basically cropping the  
22:46 - image so let's just focus on this user interface 
because this is the ui that will be redesigned  
22:52 - or re-engineer from scratch so here as you can 
see we have the hamburger icon the today basically  
22:59 - the title of the screen or view and then the more 
settings that today are basically a list of tasks  
23:06 - to do and then a plus icon and be another set of 
icons in the tab bar or basically we don't have  
23:14 - to represent all of these accurately but if you 
want to learn how to come up with these things  
23:21 - just continue watching the video all right 
so now that we have this let's just redesign  
23:28 - all right so first things first uh we have our 
um status bar right here so if we want to have  
23:34 - a status bar like this one you can just google 
ios 15 you or 15 ui kit on figma and as you can  
23:43 - see right here you have the ios 15 ukra figma 
the first thing the first on the search results  
23:50 - and once you arrive in this page you can duplicate 
this so i already have this in our um on my figma  
23:56 - file so once you have this so let's verify so 
let's say for example we want to duplicate this  
24:03 - so here let's find the let's go to 
components and find the status bar
24:16 - oh it's here
24:20 - um after looking for the status bar component just 
double click on here make sure to keep on double  
24:29 - clicking until this item is selected 
so as you can see here the rectangle  
24:35 - piece we have the whole of the status bar so just 
copy command c so i'm using a mac so i'm using  
24:42 - like mac terminologies here but if you are 
using on if you are using windows you can  
24:48 - substitute command for control or if you're um for 
option you can substitute option for alt so here  
24:55 - command c and command v here and there you go 
now we have basically you can copy and paste  
25:03 - in between files so that's also one of the good 
things about figma so here from here we can just  
25:09 - right click and detach instance because basically 
it came from a separate file and we don't want  
25:14 - to mess things up here just drag it on the top or 
basically if you want it to be exactly at the top  
25:21 - just make sure both items are zero and then we 
make sure to check fixed position when scrolling
25:31 - make sure that it's always on the top layer so 
everything that's fixed in fixed position is  
25:36 - always on the top layer so for example if you 
duplicate this if you put this here as you can  
25:41 - see it's displaying underneath that fixed layer so 
okay enough segway uh let's move forward with the  
25:49 - next item is the um hamburger icon the today and 
this another icon right here so another thing here  
25:57 - for if you want to have like icons 
or illustrations basically anything  
26:02 - you can just rely on plugins or you you can 
create them on your own so if you want to  
26:07 - create them on your own you can just create 
different lines of like different rectangles  
26:12 - and their smallest possible size until you get 
the right size or the easy way is to go to plugins  
26:20 - and look for icons eight so icons eight is our 
icons plugin of choice because it basically  
26:26 - houses a lot of plugins and different styles so 
it's in bubbles cloud and ios it's in material  
26:35 - yeah it's in google's material 
design language it's also in  
26:39 - office like microsoft office language basically 
all those things but we are sticking with ios  
26:43 - because we are designing this as an ios app 
for example so ios glyph click on azure glyph  
26:49 - and just type in menu and now you have like a 
menu and it's free so if you have an icons 8  
26:56 - account and if you're using an icons 8 account 
for free basically if you are on a free account  
27:02 - you'll just use this as a png so png is 
basically an image and you won't be able to  
27:10 - customize them like their colors and if you scale 
them up and down there's maybe there may be some  
27:15 - compromises when in terms of the quality but 
if you just want to practice there's nothing  
27:19 - wrong with using png here let's resize this so 
if you want to resize and be more precise with  
27:24 - our measurements click on make sure to click on 
these constraints proportions and click on 24  
27:30 - because that's the typical size for icons so 
just put it here and then let's type in today  
27:38 - text tool today type in that and then let's 
change the font to bold and that's good  
27:46 - so you don't need to worry about which font 
to use by default i think figma is using  
27:52 - enter so there's nothing wrong with enter it's 
a very um web friendly and ios friendly font so  
27:58 - it also is a bit similar to ios default font so 
the default font that you're seeing on your iphone  
28:04 - it's quite similar to enter so there's nothing 
wrong with that so next one is the settings icon  
28:10 - or maybe more icon something like that let's 
say type in more so right here you can see more  
28:18 - and there you go again this is a png file as 
you can see here the icon is image so it's  
28:22 - not a vector or an svg file so svg is basically 
is most preferred because it lets you customize  
28:30 - and scale images without losing its quality so 
as you can see right here there's some pixelation  
28:35 - that's going on but again we're just practicing 
so there's nothing wrong with this so again  
28:40 - make sure it's selected change just and there 
you go so if you want to make sure that they are  
28:46 - aligned you can just drag the arrow just like that 
and then make sure that they are aligned vertical  
28:53 - center and there you have it so the bigger 
approach when it comes to like grouping this items  
28:58 - like in one row is to like right click and group 
that's how i did things before but if you want to  
29:06 - have a little bit more advantage as a beginner the 
right thing to do is to use right click and add  
29:12 - auto layout so the shortcut for this is shift a so 
this is one of the most valued features in figma  
29:19 - suppress shift a because it will let you change 
the position of elements whenever you're in auto  
29:25 - layout mode it allows you to change the position 
of the elements responsibly and you don't need  
29:31 - to worry about the spacing in between them the 
margins between them and all those things because  
29:35 - basically it's auto layout the figma itself 
will automatically arrange this stuff for you  
29:42 - so to note that if you're an auto layout 
you'll see this icon right here like a three  
29:47 - three lines so basically they are stacked 
um from left to right something like that  
29:52 - so from here we will just change the padding 
to 16. basically padding is basically the space  
30:01 - inside the frame so it's like the padding so it's 
like a margin but inside the frame so let's say  
30:08 - name this as header so this is the header there 
are 16 margins as you can see so if we hover over  
30:17 - this frame auto layout frame you can see there's 
like um overlay of red lights so as you can see  
30:23 - and if you drag and you keep on hovering it'll 
show up like a 16 value basically this is the 16  
30:30 - pixels of worth of space from the edge 
of the frame so that's how padding works  
30:37 - so let's just align this to the leftmost side of 
the frame just like that and we can also create  
30:47 - if you click on this independent paddings we can 
create separate padding sizes or thickness to each  
30:56 - side so the top padding can be 64. if it's too 
much you can just make it 24 or 32 something like  
31:03 - that and the bottom padding here at the bottom 
of this frame can be 16 again and if we drag it
31:15 - and let it snap to this just below this um 
status bar and we need to resize this because  
31:22 - as you can see it's not utilizing all of the 
space on the right so let's just make sure  
31:26 - that it will snap on the right and from here 
go to this um advanced auto layout settings  
31:32 - click on spacing mode space between and just 
like that it will automatically utilize all of  
31:37 - the available space all the available space with 
the auto layout tool so i think we're doing okay  
31:46 - we can adjust the settings just like that again 
so basically from this um the padding is evenly  
31:54 - distributed across all sides so 16 on top 
bottom left and right so next one is today  
32:02 - check emails discuss marketing when etc etc so 
from here let's just create that today and let's  
32:11 - adjust the size of this to maybe 14 so it 
should be a little bit smaller than this one  
32:18 - so let's change this to medium or semi-bold 
that works and then let's type in four  
32:27 - and then let's type in or let's go to the 
plugins again and then go to the icons 8.  
32:33 - so if you've opened icons 8 before let's close 
this so if since we've opened icons 8 before  
32:40 - the shortcut to open it again is command alt 
b if you're in windows the shortcut is ctrl um  
32:48 - alt p if you're on mac control the shortcut 
is command option p rather command option p  
32:56 - it opens up the icons 8. so basically that 
shortcut opens up the most recent plugin that  
33:00 - you opened or used so moving forward let's just 
put it here um chevron basically this download  
33:13 - arrow is called the chevron so this chevrons will 
be displayed in different orientations uh like app  
33:20 - chevron downgrade all those things all right 
so again it's in png let's change this to 24.  
33:29 - don't forget to constrain proportions there 
you go let's put it beside here maybe 16 or 20.  
33:36 - yeah keep it 16 then from here let's select 
them both like just drag it just like this and  
33:44 - then press shift a convert them to auto layout and 
let's adjust the space in between these two items  
33:51 - so the space between the four and the chevron 
let's make it maybe four or eight give them enough  
33:58 - space and then from here we'll select this one and 
this one and two so you can just drag them just  
34:06 - like that then press shift a again and there 
you go let's edit the padding our padding by  
34:13 - default should be 16 because that's what um we've 
set under above so we want it to be consistent  
34:21 - so here let's drag it just like that and adjust 
the oops let's close oh let's just move it around  
34:29 - go to the advanced layout settings spacing 
mode to space between there you have it
34:38 - so that's our today like subheading  
34:41 - and then below that is our task items so our 
task items are comprised of like a square  
34:50 - a task and the time itself so let's see um the 
square oops square so let's make this 40 as  
34:59 - well make sure that they are proportioned and add 
the stroke just like that and let's make it blue
35:12 - yeah i think that's good or maybe a little bit 
darker and here you can see the there's a fill  
35:20 - color so the main color is gray so we want 
to remove that or disable that so you can  
35:26 - either turn this off or remove it altogether 
either way and then let's resize this to 24  
35:35 - there you go and we can adjust the thickness 
of this stroke by two to emphasize on that  
35:43 - and yeah i think that's good the 
corner radius can be i guess two  
35:50 - yeah all right so we have the checked box and the 
task just type in check emails and then the time  
36:01 - so 18 o'clock and then the 
icon there's an icon like clock
36:10 - right here i guess this one
36:16 - how the time should be so select them both or um 
since we can't change the color of this icon so  
36:26 - if we are using svg we can definitely change the 
color of this to something gray but since we we  
36:32 - are using png or an image file we can just set it 
to like 20 or 10 and this one you can just apply  
36:40 - the fill and use this eyedropper tool this will 
basically adapt the color that this one has so  
36:48 - if we hover over this alarm clock icon basically 
you'll see the time in the same color as this one  
36:55 - so select them both or maybe let's resize this 
first in 24 or 16. then the 18 can be i think it's  
37:06 - too light so let's adjust this just like that 18 
and this one you can make it like 20. there you go
37:17 - so 18 so select them both and then pressed shift 
a now as you can see this one are stacked on on  
37:27 - top of each other they're not side to side so 
what we're going to do is just to click click on  
37:32 - this frame and then this one make sure to click 
vertical direction and just like that and make  
37:40 - sure to this one make sure that they are top right 
aligned not center so that's the difference if we  
37:47 - click on this oops that's the difference and 
then adjust the spacing to zero now we have it  
37:59 - so we can make this smaller a bit more smaller 
to 12. and then select them both and shift eight  
38:08 - and then maybe eight this 
one can be a bit more smaller  
38:16 - check emails 18 o'clock so from here we can just 
select them all so we have the first frame the  
38:23 - check box and the task item and then the time 
so select them both and press shift a again  
38:32 - now we have another layout frame and we need 
to first change to alignment to left aligned  
38:39 - and then change the spacing oops i'll 
change the padding to and then a guest 8
38:50 - and then spacing mode should be spaced between
38:56 - now let's drag this just like that
39:02 - all right we have today check emails so we want to 
have multiple tasks right so in order to do that  
39:08 - we only need what we need to do is just select 
this one and press command d or control d and just  
39:17 - drag it here you can see so let's redo that part 
again task item one will be duplicated command d  
39:24 - now we have task item two so we just need 
to drag it below make sure that it's below  
39:33 - and just like that until it will snap you will 
feel it whenever you're um changing its position  
39:40 - so let's adjust the top and bottom padding 
to maybe four same goes for this one four and  
39:49 - just drag it just like that oops all right 
so once they're snapped duplicate them again  
39:59 - and it will snap duplicate it and once you've set 
that position you can just keep on duplicating  
40:04 - things and basically um change this to like 
this cost marketing plan morning meeting
40:14 - branding campaign
40:17 - and whatever else tasks that you 
want to do so we want to keep this um  
40:22 - same as this one here we go so now we have 
basically basically have these things already  
40:29 - so but as you can see let's close this as you 
can see this tasks are grouped together right  
40:37 - they are in this like white group of frame or 
shape so in order to do that we just first need  
40:45 - to we should have done this earlier by the way 
but we forgot so what we're going to do is just  
40:49 - change this make sure to click on the iphone 13 
pro or iphone 13 frame this is our top level frame  
40:57 - click on the fill and change the color to 
something like um something off white maybe  
41:04 - blue and then change it to a little 
bit whiter but not pure white  
41:12 - so yeah i guess that works and then we are going 
to select all of these things so these frame this  
41:23 - check emails this this cost marketing plan this 
task basically you will select them all and as  
41:28 - you can see by the way this one frame 2 is showing 
up and the reason for this is because frame 2 is  
41:34 - not inside the iphone 13 frame so i should have 
us seen this earlier so in order to fix this you  
41:42 - just need to put it down just like that it's no 
longer showing up and basically they're all part  
41:48 - of the iphone directing frame they're basically 
inside this frame so next one is again going back  
41:55 - just select them all and press shift a and just 
like that we now have this group of tasks so  
42:05 - we just need to change the color of this frame 
so task section let's rename this section as task  
42:13 - section then we have our layout grid or rather the 
fill and as you can see we now have it in filled  
42:22 - pure white so it's kind of it's kind of separated 
to the background so let's just adjust the some  
42:31 - um settings here so let's click on 
the today frame like the day frame
42:40 - um let's set the padding to maybe eight
42:47 - there you go and let's also change 
the top and bottom padding of this  
42:51 - task items to two so they are usually so we set 
them earlier as four so let's just change them all  
42:58 - so double click on each of them and so in cases 
like this you may want to not just drag to select  
43:06 - all of them so you can also hold shift so while 
holding shift you can select multiple items just  
43:13 - basically for selecting multiple stuff so 
apart from like dragging things selecting  
43:18 - multiple items there's also a good way to do that 
so just change this to four and there you have it  
43:25 - now from here we will set the bottom padding 
to something like 16 or 8 something like that  
43:35 - and then from here we will press shift a again 
so that's so much all the layout but you'll  
43:42 - in a few seconds you'll understand why so 
press shift again now we have like a frame  
43:50 - basically this slightly container it's basically a 
frame within a frame or a frame outside the frame  
43:55 - so as you can see it it's already overlapping 
the iphone 13 frame so we just need to do this  
44:03 - and then this one then adjust the padding to 16. 
basically it snaps hug contents oops this one  
44:15 - so this one now the task section we need to select 
fill container basically it will wrap inside that  
44:22 - frame but at the same time respecting the spaces 
that we've set a while ago so this one again let's  
44:28 - select them each task item let's select each tax 
item the full container as well and just like that  
44:37 - for the today as well let's select 
make sure that today frame is selected  
44:41 - check fill container and there you have it  
44:45 - so as you can see this is the beauty of other 
layout so even if you're still a beginner um  
44:50 - teaching you these things will basically unlock 
a lot of possibilities for you when designing  
44:55 - a figma so understanding the auto layout this 
early in this stage is a very useful technique  
45:03 - let's just design an icon or a button so you'll 
know how to design one as well so let's press  
45:09 - o this will open up our ellipse tool and while 
you open up the ellipse also press o again  
45:15 - hold shift and then drag it drag the circle just 
like this until your desired size so i want it  
45:21 - to be a bit like 64. or maybe 62 just changes 
here 64. and then put it here and then what  
45:30 - we're going to do is to click on the eye dropper 
tool from the color settings and hover it over  
45:37 - this button and now we have the blue button right 
there now next thing to do is just type in plus
45:49 - and then what we're going to do is to right 
click and flatten this object or text what will  
45:59 - what this will do is that it'll convert the 
text into a vector shape which we can now scale  
46:07 - accordingly just like that and change the color 
of it to something like blue or white or black  
46:16 - basically a vector image now or vector 
illustration or vector object so if  
46:20 - we put this together here and change the 
color to white that's basically our button  
46:26 - so let's change it with that and now you 
have the plus icon now here we can just  
46:32 - group we can either group or frame but 
for me i'll choose the frame selection  
46:37 - and then i'll make sure that this is constrained 
proportions and now we have it and then next thing  
46:45 - to do is to check on the effects and drop 
shadow and let's just make sure to lessen  
46:52 - the transparency of this shadow to ten percent 
now you have like a floating button right here  
46:58 - um let's change the color to something like blue 
as well and then let's reduce the opacity of this  
47:06 - on this one let's reduce its opacity to something 
like that so it's like a floating blue button
47:17 - next one is um if you want to change the 
background color of your canvas by the way  
47:23 - just click on the background here 
change the color to something like  
47:27 - black um whichever you prefer so let's just 
put it in something like this grey so we can  
47:34 - better emphasize on the screen that we're 
designing and then put it at the bottom so  
47:42 - from the last part we just need to um 
get this icons i think these are the  
47:48 - check box calendar focus timer settings let's just 
you know what let's just select four so maybe i  
47:56 - don't know what this is maybe it's a unique 
icon or something so let's just find checked
48:07 - this checkbox
48:16 - all right so now we have the four icons let's 
just resize them all select them all and then  
48:23 - constrain proportions then 24 or 32 and then 
from here let's just align them together  
48:30 - but we have the on tasks the calendar the timer 
and the settings so these things are like i think  
48:38 - they are custom icons that were made exactly 
for the app so we don't have like um i think  
48:44 - i don't think we can replicate these things 
so let's just select them all press shift a  
48:50 - let's drag it here and then maybe adjust 
the opacity to 20 or rather let's don't  
48:59 - do that make sure to select all of them 
so here select all of them in this layer  
49:06 - you can also select them via the layers panel 
while holding shift and then press 20 percent
49:15 - and then since we have our um auto 
layout this is like tab bar let's just
49:24 - resize this and make it snap to the sides and 
just like that and adjust the spacing make it  
49:32 - space between or maybe um packed in the middle 
and then adjust the spacing manually or 40 eight  
49:43 - something like that i think that's good maybe 
54. yeah i think that's good and then from here  
49:50 - we can set the bottom padding or rather this 
um left and right padding to 16 and the bottom  
49:59 - padding to 32 i guess and 16 here so the reason 
for this is because we still need to put the  
50:09 - home gesture button so i don't i'm not exactly 
sure what's that what that's called so yeah  
50:16 - we don't need to worry about having the blue icon 
basically um you can just do it on your own like  
50:22 - this and like a rectangle and duplicate it and 
just like that make a check mark or something
50:39 - we have a check mark it's not 
perfect but that i think this will do
50:46 - so select them both and command e or flatten 
and just drag it here and then this one  
50:53 - will make it blue um make sure 
the eyedropper tool is selected  
50:57 - and make it in the same color as 
this one so this one will be in white
51:04 - and white select the white and 
then resize this to maybe 16
51:18 - resize this to maybe 24.
51:22 - and yeah also this one let's put this to scale and 
scale so this one i think the better way to do it  
51:32 - is to create a frame just like this one select 
a frame tool the fill will be in the same color  
51:39 - as this one so let's delete this and then this one 
will be inside this frame and now you have like um  
51:49 - a check mark um icon so the size of this is 32 so 
let's just make sure to change this so 32 by the  
51:58 - way if you want to customize the size of this 
um frame without affecting the elements inside  
52:04 - you should hold control or command hold command 
and resize this on side to side so 32 and 32
52:17 - there you have it and change the corner 
radius to maybe eight or four or three  
52:25 - yeah oops change this to four and 
there you have it so let's drag it here
52:34 - change this to 28 i guess or 24 yeah 
that's better change the coordinates to two  
52:43 - and let's change this and remove 
this now we have our task item  
52:49 - and there you have it so one last thing let's 
move back to the ios 15 ui kit file and then  
52:56 - let's find the gesture button or the home 
button i think it's here somewhere oh it's here  
53:03 - so here just double click double click again and 
then copy and then paste so before we do anything  
53:10 - just make sure that it's inside this frame 
so by default copy and pasting items won't  
53:17 - automatically be redirected inside this frame 
so you just make sure to drag it over and then  
53:23 - this will highlight the page and then what 
we'll do is to align bottom and align center  
53:31 - and basically i think we can adjust it make it 
snap to the sides and there you go we now have  
53:40 - our home indicator so we can detach this instance 
and circuit again and fix position now we have  
53:50 - our two simple to-do list app that we designed 
and figma so it took quite a while but again  
53:56 - it's it's very simple it will take some time 
um if you're a complete beginner it will take  
54:01 - some time to get used to but just keep on 
redesigning things and you'll be good to go  
54:06 - so if we present this click on the present 
and then here you go there you have our app  
54:13 - design that we designed on figma again if you're 
a complete beginner the best way to practice is to  
54:18 - redesign apps it's just like learning how to play 
guitar like you learn by playing existing songs  
54:24 - once you know your way around the tool you can be 
more confident and write and play your own song  
54:29 - the same goes for design and development 
by re-engineering existing works  
54:34 - we can learn from how such designs were achieved 
alright so that's it for our step-by-step guide  
54:39 - to designing with sigma in 2022 i hope you 
learned a lot from this video let us know in  
54:44 - the comments if you have any questions until 
then see you and good luck with your design
