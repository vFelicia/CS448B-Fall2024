00:00 - Hey CodeCrew today I'm going to show you
00:01 - how to make an app using Xcode for
00:04 - Windows now if you do a search for this
00:06 - topic you'll find a lot of articles and
00:08 - videos saying how you can't get Xcode on
00:11 - Windows and then they're going to
00:12 - proceed to give you a list of
00:13 - alternatives now it's true that there's
00:15 - no Windows version of Xcode but I'm not
00:18 - gonna leave you high and dry today we're
00:20 - gonna dive a little deeper and I'm gonna
00:22 - show you step by step instructions on
00:24 - how to set up what I think is the best
00:26 - solution for beginners who are
00:28 - non-technical and who want to dabble in
00:30 - iOS app development without committing
00:33 - too much of a upfront investment all
00:35 - right stay tuned
00:41 - welcome to code with Chris, the place to
00:43 - be if you want to learn how to make an
00:45 - app I'm Chris and I hear that you want to
00:47 - learn iOS app development and you're
00:49 - using a PC well you're not alone in fact
00:52 - the most trafficked page on code with
00:54 - Chris calm is my article on Xcode
00:58 - alternatives on the PC in fact I get
01:01 - questions about how to run Xcode on
01:04 - Windows every single day.  So in 2019, I
01:07 - decided to dive a little deeper to
01:09 - figure out what's the best solution for
01:11 - Windows users and what I found is that
01:14 - there is no universal one-size-fits-all
01:16 - best solution instead the best solution
01:19 - depends on what your goals are and how
01:21 - technical you are for example if you're
01:23 - a hundred percent committed to doing iOS
01:25 - app development then I would say go buy
01:27 - a Mac or go borrow someone else's Mac or
01:30 - get access to a Mac computer lab there
01:32 - really is no better way to do iOS app
01:35 - development if you're not a hundred
01:38 - percent committed but you do have a
01:39 - technical background then building a
01:41 - hackintosh or using virtualization
01:43 - software like VirtualBox to install macOS
01:46 - on your PC could be a good solution
01:49 - however I know that a lot of my audience
01:51 - are non-technical beginners who aren't
01:55 - sure if I was app development is for
01:57 - them yet and they want to try it out and
01:59 - see if that's something that they like
02:01 - if that sounds like you then I would
02:03 - recommend getting access to an actual
02:05 - Mac maybe your friend has a MacBook that
02:07 - you can borrow maybe your local library
02:09 - has access to Mac's
02:11 - now the most important thing is that you
02:13 - can install
02:13 - Xcode on those machines so that you can
02:15 - actually try out iOS app development and
02:18 - see if it's something that you want to
02:19 - do long-term now if you can't get your
02:22 - hands on a Mac the next best solution is
02:25 - to rent remote access to a Mac there are
02:28 - services out there which allow you to
02:30 - connect to a Mac over an internet
02:32 - connection and you're going to see that
02:34 - Mac's desktop on the desktop of your PC
02:37 - in a window and you can control that Mac
02:38 - like that now this is not as ideal as
02:42 - actually having access to a Mac because
02:44 - there is a little bit of a lag as you're
02:46 - controlling that computer through an
02:48 - internet connection but compare this
02:50 - with the actual investment of buying a
02:54 - Mac upfront which starts at $800 now if
02:57 - you're anything like me you've probably
02:58 - bought a ton of stuff in the past that
03:01 - you thought you would use a lot more
03:03 - than you actually did for be gym
03:05 - memberships come to mind so instead of
03:07 - investing in Arman and like buying a Mac
03:09 - upfront I would first invest into one of
03:11 - these remote access Mac's just to learn
03:14 - the basics of app development first to
03:15 - see if it's something that you like and
03:17 - you want to do long term the service
03:19 - that I like the most is called MacStadium
03:20 - it's because they've got the
03:22 - newest Mac and they've even been
03:23 - featured by Apple on stage so here's
03:26 - what I'm going to show you how to do
03:28 - step one I'm going to show you how to
03:29 - sign up for MacStadium step two we're
03:31 - going to connect to your Mac from
03:33 - Windows with a piece of software called
03:35 - TightVNC which is free step 3 we're
03:38 - going to download Xcode and then step 4
03:40 - we're going to launch Xcode and build
03:41 - our first hello world app
03:44 - the first step is to sign up for MacStadium
03:46 - now they have a free trial but
03:48 - it's not very long to be honest I like
03:51 - their service the best so I reached out
03:52 - to see if I could get something special
03:54 - for you guys and in fact they gave me an
03:57 - exclusive coupon code where you can use
03:59 - to get 50% off your first month that's
04:02 - going to be enough time for you to go
04:04 - through this video go through my
04:05 - beginner video series where you're going
04:07 - to learn the core app development skills
04:08 - and also enough time to get a ton of
04:10 - practice in and by the end of that first
04:12 - month you'll be able to know if iOS app
04:15 - development is something that you want
04:16 - to continue with and you can just
04:19 - continue using the MacStadium service
04:21 - or try to find access to another Mac or
04:23 - to buy an actual Mac and if you find out
04:26 - that it's not something that you like
04:28 - then hey it's better than having bought
04:31 - a Mac upfront which then you're gonna
04:33 - have to sell right so all you have to do
04:35 - is visit CodeWithChris.com/MacStadium
04:38 - and then you're gonna click on
04:40 - the start my free trial button you're
04:41 - gonna go through all of the steps and
04:43 - before the last confirmation button
04:46 - there's a checkbox which you can enable
04:48 - to enter in a coupon code and you're
04:49 - gonna use the coupon code CODEWITHCHRIS
04:52 - now I do want to mention that if you do
04:54 - use this coupon code to get 50% off your
04:56 - first month then I'm going to get a
04:58 - small kickback at no extra expense for
05:00 - you so it's going to be a win-win
05:01 - situation and thank you so much for
05:03 - supporting my channel now we're going to
05:05 - jump on the computer and I'll show you
05:07 - how to sign up for MacStadium so after
05:09 - you go to codewithchris.com/MacStadium
05:11 - it's going to bring you to this
05:13 - page and you can get a little more
05:15 - information about Mac Stadium and about
05:17 - the Mac's that they have when you're
05:19 - ready to sign up on the right hand side
05:21 - click on start my free trial and this is
05:25 - kind of the lowest tier Mac that they
05:28 - have it's gonna be enough for iOS app
05:30 - development but it's got also going to
05:32 - be the lowest cost for you so click on
05:35 - start my free trial it's gonna allow you
05:37 - to configure your Mac you can leave it
05:39 - as it is any upgrade that you do is
05:43 - going to add to that monthly cost now
05:45 - there's nothing that you can remove that
05:47 - will lower the monthly cost because this
05:49 - is kind of the base configuration but
05:51 - it's going to be enough for us so once
05:54 - you're satisfied with this click
05:55 - the orange start trial button on the
05:58 - right hand side and here you're going to
06:02 - just enter in some account information
06:05 - you're gonna create a brand new account
06:07 - so for me I've already got account so
06:09 - I'm going to just go ahead and login for
06:14 - you you'll probably be creating a brand
06:16 - new account down there so here's where I
06:18 - want to point your attention to you're
06:20 - going to add a payment method but before
06:22 - you click on that orange button make
06:25 - sure that you check off I want to use a
06:27 - coupon code and in here put in CODEWITHCHRIS
06:31 - in all capital letters and then
06:34 - submit card payment or whatever that
06:36 - orange button says to proceed what's
06:39 - going to happen is you're going to get
06:40 - the one-day trial and then you're going
06:42 - to be paying 50% off for that first
06:46 - month and after you submit your order
06:49 - it's going to take about an hour for
06:52 - them to set up your Mac they're going to
06:53 - send you an email right away telling you
06:55 - that that's what they're doing then
06:57 - you're gonna have to wait a couple of
06:58 - hours for them to actually set it up
06:59 - you're gonna get another email at that
07:01 - point with a link and you're gonna click
07:03 - through that link which is going to
07:05 - bring you to their ticketing system and
07:07 - you're going to be able to see your
07:09 - login credentials for your Mac
07:13 - now we're going to connect to our Mac
07:15 - using TightVNC
07:16 - in your browser go to TightVNC.com and
07:21 - you're going to let me go back to the
07:24 - home page here and you're going to find
07:25 - this link called get your free copy of
07:28 - TightVNC click that on this page you're
07:31 - going to be able to download an
07:32 - installer for Windows now if you're not
07:34 - sure if you should to download 64-bit or
07:36 - 32-bit just go to your About your PC and
07:42 - scroll down a little bit and your gonna
07:44 - be able to see so here system type for
07:48 - me a 64-bit operating system so I'm
07:50 - going to download the 64-bit version so
07:52 - let's go ahead and download that
07:54 - installer for Windows we're gonna save
07:58 - it right there it's a really small
07:59 - download and the reason I'm showing you
08:01 - each of these steps is because this
08:04 - installer actually has a couple of
08:06 - options that we want to configure so go
08:08 - to next read the Terms of agreement if
08:13 - you want and accept them and here you
08:15 - want to choose the custom installation
08:17 - type because what I want you to turn off
08:19 - is the type VNC server we don't need
08:24 - that for this purpose that's for
08:27 - actually allowing other computers to
08:30 - control your computer remotely that's
08:32 - when you would want to install TightVNC
08:33 - Server and set that up and get that
08:35 - running all we want to do is use the
08:37 - TightVNC Viewer which allows us to
08:39 - connect to another computer so click on
08:43 - next and these options are fine click
08:46 - Next and click install click yes and
08:51 - then we finish alright so now we're
08:54 - going to launch the program might be on
08:57 - my desktop oh there it is
09:00 - and all we have to do is specify the
09:03 - remote host IP address which is going to
09:06 - be in that installation ticket after
09:08 - they've set up your Mac so I've already
09:10 - got it saved here in my configuration
09:13 - but if you don't you're going to want to
09:14 - jump into that installation ticket to
09:16 - grab that IP address and you're going to
09:20 - want to keep that password handy too
09:21 - because you're going to
09:22 - need to use it right here now I don't
09:26 - remember mine so I actually need to log
09:29 - in and get it all right so if you don't
09:38 - see any support tickets keep in mind
09:40 - that there is a toggle here so you can
09:42 - toggle open and closed so maybe it the
09:46 - ticket was closed so you're gonna need
09:48 - to check to close the status so there's
09:50 - mine I'm gonna scroll up and grab my
09:54 - password we're gonna copy and I'm just
09:57 - gonna paste it here and click OK
10:00 - and then it's going to connect to our
10:03 - map there it is now this password for
10:10 - your administrator is the same password
10:11 - you just used to connect to this Mac and
10:14 - you might try to paste your password
10:16 - right here but it's not going to work
10:18 - because the password that you copied is
10:20 - on your Windows clipboard not on your
10:22 - Mac clipboard so here you're actually
10:24 - going to type it in manually and if your
10:28 - screen if you can't see the whole
10:30 - desktop through this window what you can
10:31 - do is click these zoom buttons right
10:33 - here these scale and then scale out so
10:35 - you can kind of scale it so that you can
10:38 - see the entire desktop and you can also
10:40 - click on this fullscreen button as well
10:42 - all right so let me type in the password
10:45 - before I fullscreen it because otherwise
10:47 - I won't be able to see it alright so as
10:56 - you can see I was playing around on the
10:57 - Mac but the first thing you'll want to
10:59 - do is actually go into the Mac App Store
11:02 - and download Xcode
11:05 - so you should be able to see the Mac App
11:08 - Store icon right here and you're gonna
11:11 - click on it now you're gonna notice a
11:13 - little bit of a lag as you're using your
11:16 - remote Mac and this is what I mentioned
11:18 - before you know ideally you can get
11:20 - access to a Mac so that you can try out
11:22 - iOS app development but if you don't if
11:25 - you can't and you don't want to buy a
11:27 - Mac this is kind of the next best
11:28 - solution so in order to download Xcode
11:32 - through the App Store you're going to
11:33 - need an Apple ID which is free and
11:37 - instead of signing up for it through
11:39 - your Mac here I would go back to your
11:42 - Windows desktop just visit Apple.com
11:44 - and up here click on sign-in and
11:50 - obviously you don't have an Apple ID yet
11:52 - but there's going to be a link there
11:53 - that says don't have an Apple ID create
11:55 - one now so click that and you're going
11:57 - to be able to create an Apple ID for
11:59 - free and after you have your Apple ID
12:02 - jump back into your Mac and login to the
12:05 - App Store and that's going to allow you
12:08 - to download Xcode so search for Xcode
12:11 - hit enter it's gonna bring it up and
12:13 - then you're going to click on get and
12:16 - then install so for me it's already open
12:19 - downloading and installing Xcode is
12:21 - probably gonna take at least an hour so
12:23 - I would just go grab a coffee
12:25 - or do something else and then come back
12:26 - because Xcode is quite a large program
12:31 - so once you've got Xcode installed -
12:34 - just launch it and you're going to see
12:37 - something like this and in fact I'm just
12:39 - going to full screen my window take note
12:43 - of this keyboard command to get out of
12:45 - full screen ctrl alt shift + F so at
12:49 - this point we're just going to create
12:51 - our brand new Xcode project and we're
12:53 - going to do a simple Hello, World demo so
12:56 - we're going to choose a single View
12:57 - application and you're you're gonna have
13:01 - to have a little bit of patience working
13:03 - with Xcode through this remote
13:05 - connection because there is a bit of a
13:07 - lag unfortunately but it's still going
13:11 - to give you a chance to see if app
13:14 - development is for you so I had to enter
13:17 - a product name and change some of these
13:21 - organization name you
13:24 - can just put your own name and
13:26 - organization identifier is com dot
13:28 - whatever your name would be without spaces
13:31 - and I would uncheck unit tests an
13:34 - UI tests
13:35 - click on next and then we're going to
13:40 - uncheck create get a repository on the
13:42 - Mac you're gonna create it on the
13:44 - desktop now in this demo I'm just going
13:47 - to build a basic Hello World app but if
13:50 - you want a lot more instruction and a
13:53 - lot more teaching you should check out
13:56 - my beginner video series because this
13:57 - video is really just to demonstrate
13:59 - using Mac through Windows so I would go
14:04 - into the storyboard right now and then
14:07 - we would go ahead and click on this icon
14:10 - up here I'm going to add a label as soon
14:14 - as our view shows up that's it there
14:23 - it's still loading okay you've got it so
14:27 - we're gonna go ahead click this button
14:29 - up here type in label so I already have
14:35 - a label here and then she's gonna click
14:37 - and drag it on to the view alright so
14:41 - I'm holding the mouse here while the
14:43 - screen updates I'm gonna release it put
14:46 - it right there
14:47 - and now I'm gonna click on this
14:49 - inspector while I have that label
14:51 - highlighted and then I'm going to put my
14:56 - text box in there and I'm gonna say
14:59 - hello world press ENTER I'm going to
15:06 - Center this label by adding two
15:07 - constraints so click open this menu here
15:11 - we're going to add a horizontal in
15:14 - container and vertical in container
15:16 - let's wait for that check box to appear
15:18 - before I click add constraints and then
15:21 - we're going to add these two constraints
15:23 - that's going to center label onto the
15:27 - screen and then I'm going to run my
15:29 - project and the simulator is going to
15:32 - show up now the first time you're gonna
15:34 - run your Xcode project that simulator is
15:36 - going to take a long time to show up so
15:39 - be patient subsequent times will be a
15:41 - little bit faster and also that
15:43 - simulator might be way way too big all
15:46 - you have to do is hold down alt and
15:48 - press 1 2 or 3 to change the zoom level
15:50 - to get it to a size that you'd like or
15:53 - you can click on the simulator and then
15:56 - click on window and you can change the
15:59 - zoom level as well so you know the it's
16:04 - command 1, 2 or command 3 but on the
16:06 - windows keyboard it be alt 1 alt - there
16:14 - we go
16:15 - I've created a handy Xcode cheatsheet
16:18 - specifically for Windows users so it's
16:20 - got keyboard shortcuts and reminders for
16:22 - a PC keyboard to download it simply
16:25 - click below or check the description for
16:27 - a link now that you have access to a Mac
16:29 - it's time to learn the basics of iOS
16:32 - programming with my beginner video
16:33 - series it's been viewed by over 1.2
16:36 - million people and tons of success
16:38 - stories have come out of it simply click
16:40 - on the thumbnail and I'll see you there
