00:00 - hey coke crew how's it going in today's
00:02 - video I'll teach you guys how to
00:03 - implement ads into your apps
00:04 - specifically we're going to be using
00:06 - Google AdMob to implement banner ads and
00:09 - you know it couldn't be easier to do as
00:11 - you're gonna see now before we begin one
00:13 - word if you're brand new to the channel
00:15 - welcome and if you're brand new to the
00:17 - iOS app development you're in the right
00:19 - place be sure to check out my beginner
00:21 - video series which I'll link to right
00:23 - now because watching that is going to
00:24 - equip you with all of the proper skills
00:26 - you need in order to understand what's
00:28 - going on in this video
00:29 - all right so without further ado let's
00:32 - get started so the first thing you're
00:35 - going to want to do is to go to AdMob
00:37 - comm and create a new account because
00:40 - that's we're gonna see your stats you're
00:42 - gonna get paid essentially so you're
00:44 - gonna want to do this go to AdMob comm
00:46 - sign in with your Google account or sign
00:48 - up for a brand new account and once you
00:51 - do you're gonna get to some sort of
00:52 - dashboard like this or you might get
00:54 - like a quick start wizard that's asking
00:56 - you to add a new app go ahead and click
00:59 - that because we're gonna need to create
01:01 - an AdMob app now I already created this
01:04 - as a demo so I'm just gonna click on add
01:05 - app here but I think when you first
01:07 - start your brand new account you're
01:09 - gonna get a screen that looks something
01:10 - like this since we're starting a new
01:13 - demo we're gonna click no for this I'm
01:15 - going to enter in our app information
01:18 - and also enable or select iOS for our
01:21 - platform I'm going to call this the ads
01:24 - demo and I'm gonna click Add and this
01:29 - app ID is very important because when we
01:33 - display an ad inside our app we're going
01:36 - to need to take note of this app ID that
01:39 - is what links those ads to this AdMob
01:43 - app that we're creating okay we're not
01:45 - going to create an ad unit now just go
01:48 - ahead and click I'll do it later now the
01:50 - next step is to create our Xcode project
01:52 - for the actual app where we're going to
01:54 - display our banners so let's create a
01:57 - brand new Xcode project we're going to
02:00 - choose a single view application I just
02:03 - call this the ads demo as well it's just
02:07 - okay
02:08 - so I'll click Next I'll save it on my
02:10 - desktop here
02:12 - and take note of that bundle ID that's
02:16 - sort of the unique identifier for your
02:18 - Xcode project now that we have this
02:21 - project created we need to add the AdMob
02:24 - SDK or the libraries into our project
02:27 - now if you happen to be using firebase
02:29 - this is going to be very easy because
02:31 - the AdMob service is actually part of
02:34 - the firebase platform so in the process
02:36 - of installing firebase you can also
02:38 - install AdMob and you're not familiar
02:41 - with firebase I've done a whole bunch of
02:43 - tutorials covering it it's basically a
02:45 - remote database that you can use it's
02:47 - offered by Google and so you can store
02:51 - and retrieve data it's very easy to use
02:53 - and it's got a very generous free tier
02:55 - so I highly recommend it if you're not
02:57 - using firebase you can still download
02:59 - the AdMob library separately and add
03:02 - them into your Xcode project but for
03:04 - this tutorial we're going to use the
03:06 - firebase way so if we go back to the
03:09 - AdMob dashboard there's actually a very
03:11 - easy link to proceed to link it to a
03:16 - firebase project and then get those
03:17 - firebase libraries and AdMob libraries
03:20 - installed what you're gonna do is come
03:23 - back here and then click on some of
03:26 - these icons are hard to understand what
03:28 - they are but if you hover over them
03:30 - you're gonna see it go to app settings
03:32 - and then there is see there's your app
03:36 - ID if that you're gonna need and
03:37 - firebase link so you can go ahead and
03:40 - just click this there is some sort of
03:45 - policy that you can read let's confirm
03:47 - that and we're going to need the bundle
03:50 - ID so this is very important because it
03:52 - can't be changed later we're going to
03:54 - come here and grab our bundle identifier
03:56 - for our project and then come back here
03:59 - and just paste it in there and it's
04:02 - gonna let us continue it can't find a
04:05 - specific firebase project for this guy
04:07 - and so I'm going to create a brand new
04:10 - firebase project I'm going to call this
04:13 - the ads demo
04:17 - click continue and it's creating a new
04:20 - fire based project in the firebase
04:22 - console for us it's kind of equivalent
04:25 - of coming here into your firebase
04:27 - console and then adding a brand-new
04:28 - project except that it's just doing it
04:30 - here for us so it's successfully linked
04:33 - the add demo that we created in AdMob to
04:39 - a firebase project that it just created
04:42 - for us so if we refresh this firebase
04:46 - console page we should be able to see it
04:49 - and let's see there it is
04:52 - other projects using firebase so we
04:55 - haven't finished setting this guy up yet
04:57 - at this point it's telling us to go over
05:00 - to the firebase documentation to setup
05:03 - the firebase project so we'll just click
05:04 - done here and in the app settings you
05:07 - can see now it's linked to that firebase
05:09 - project going back to the firebase
05:11 - console though we can now finish setting
05:14 - up this firebase project choose data
05:18 - sharing all right
05:20 - Google wants us to share some data with
05:23 - them for you you should actually read
05:25 - those for me says this is just a demo
05:30 - application I'm not as concerned so we
05:33 - need to set things up here let's click
05:35 - on this guy we're going to need to
05:39 - download this Google service info dot
05:41 - plist because this guy contains all of
05:44 - the configuration settings to point to
05:46 - this firebase instance so we're going to
05:49 - need to download this file and add it to
05:51 - our Xcode project so let's go ahead
05:53 - download it I'll just save it on my
05:57 - desktop and then just drag it into your
06:01 - Xcode project like that make sure that
06:04 - copy items if needed is enabled as is
06:07 - targets for that guy right there
06:12 - all right so we have it added here now
06:15 - what we're going to do is just close
06:18 - that Xcode project because now we're
06:20 - going to use something called cocoa pods
06:22 - to get those firebase and AdMob
06:25 - libraries into our Xcode project if
06:27 - you're unfamiliar with installing
06:29 - firebase with cocoa pods
06:30 - or if you don't have cocoapods installed
06:32 - in your system I'm gonna link to a
06:34 - couple of other videos that I've done
06:35 - right now and you can get cocoapods
06:38 - installed on your system first so you
06:40 - have this package manager which helps
06:43 - you manage all these third-party
06:44 - libraries that you're using it's pretty
06:46 - standard stuff and it's definitely
06:48 - something that you're gonna want to have
06:49 - if you're going to be building different
06:51 - apps utilizing third-party SDKs like
06:54 - we're doing now
06:55 - so cocoapods is a must or a really good
06:59 - thing to have and then the next thing
07:01 - would be using cocoapods to get the
07:04 - firebase and AdMob libraries now we're
07:07 - gonna do that together here using
07:09 - cocoapods
07:10 - but if you want a slower tutorial where
07:13 - I walk through everything in much more
07:15 - detail you can watch my firebase quick
07:17 - start video which I'll also link to
07:19 - right now alright so let's go ahead and
07:22 - use cocoapods to install the firebase
07:24 - and AdMob libraries we are you can see
07:29 - how I did it from a previous demo but
07:32 - essentially let me close this first so
07:35 - that we get a fresh start we're gonna
07:37 - open up terminal here and we are going
07:40 - to navigate to our project folder I've
07:42 - saved it on the desktop so I'm gonna go
07:45 - ahead and navigate there so here I am
07:47 - we're going to type in pod space in it
07:50 - to basically initialize our project to
07:53 - use cocoapods I'm gonna double-click my
07:56 - folder here and here I've got this pod
07:59 - file I'm going to open it up in a text
08:02 - editor like that and we are going to add
08:05 - a couple of pods so one of them we need
08:09 - is firebase core and this is all of the
08:13 - firebase kind of like the basic
08:17 - libraries and classes that we're going
08:19 - to need and then we're also going to add
08:21 - AdMob and keep in mind that this M has
08:24 - to be capitalized if you do a lowercase
08:26 - M it's not going to recognize it let's
08:29 - save this file and let's jump back into
08:31 - terminal and type in pod install that's
08:35 - gonna go out and fetch those libraries
08:36 - it's gonna be really fast for me here
08:38 - because I've done it before and so for
08:41 - you it might take a little longer
08:43 - take note of this though we're gonna
08:45 - have to use the XC workspace file from
08:47 - now if you have Xcode open right now go
08:50 - ahead and close it so you don't get
08:52 - confused this is what you used to open
08:55 - now we're going to open this so go ahead
08:57 - and open XC workspace in your file
09:01 - navigator under pods you're gonna see
09:03 - all of these different libraries that's
09:04 - downloaded for you go ahead and hit
09:07 - command B to build your project just to
09:09 - make sure that everything is working
09:10 - right now
09:11 - all right built succeeded so we can go
09:14 - on the next thing to do is go into app
09:17 - delegate where we are going to basically
09:20 - when the app launches we want to tell it
09:22 - to initialize firebase and configure it
09:26 - for use so in the app delegate Swift at
09:29 - the top we're going to import a firebase
09:32 - and then in the view did finish
09:36 - launching with options here we are going
09:39 - to type in firebase app dot configure
09:43 - and we have to do this before the return
09:45 - statement all right so this is
09:47 - initialized firebase we also have to
09:53 - initialize AdMob so if we go back to the
09:59 - documentation I don't I want to make
10:01 - this a habit for you to go through and
10:03 - I'll show you where in the documentation
10:05 - it is if you just go into the firebase
10:07 - documentation on the left hand side
10:10 - scroll all the way down under Google
10:12 - AdMob under iOS get started it's going
10:15 - to tell you all of the information that
10:17 - we're going to do right now
10:18 - so installing the firebase SDK we've
10:20 - done that create an AdMob account we
10:22 - also did that register an app did that
10:24 - link the app to a firebase project we
10:27 - did that and so this is where we're at
10:29 - right now we're adding these two pods
10:31 - right we did a pod install and now we
10:35 - need to initialize the AdMob SDK so you
10:40 - can see import firebase did that
10:42 - firebase app configure did that and now
10:45 - this part is what we need to do GAD
10:48 - mobile ads thought configure with
10:50 - application ID and this is our AdMob app
10:53 - ID so we go into your AdMob account
10:56 - that's where this ID is going to be
10:59 - needed let's copy app ID let's go here
11:04 - dad mobile ads dot configure with
11:08 - application ID create a string with that
11:11 - and that's where that goes let's go back
11:15 - to the documentation here you scroll
11:18 - down there are different ad formats that
11:22 - we can use we can do a banner
11:24 - interstitial native record rewarded
11:28 - video so I'll let you read those
11:29 - descriptions we're gonna create a basic
11:31 - ad banner that's the one that everyone
11:33 - knows and loves I don't know about loves
11:36 - but knows for sure we're gonna scroll
11:40 - down here this is very important always
11:42 - test with test ads because if you're
11:44 - showing live ads in your simulator an
11:48 - advertiser is paying dollars for that
11:51 - view and you're technically not showing
11:54 - it to anybody that's really going to
11:55 - click it and provide a return on
11:57 - investment for that advertiser so if if
12:00 - you do that a lot your account will
12:02 - probably get banned when you're testing
12:04 - in building your app you want to be
12:06 - using this this specific ID here which
12:10 - will show test ads and no one's gonna be
12:12 - paying any money to for those ads
12:14 - they're just placeholder ads so we're
12:17 - gonna take note of that we're gonna use
12:18 - that in a second
12:20 - we're gonna need to create a GAD banner
12:22 - view this is the class that's used to
12:24 - display that banner and there's two ways
12:27 - of doing it you can do it
12:29 - programmatically so I'll walk through
12:32 - this way with you first you import
12:34 - Google mobile ads you create a GAD
12:38 - banner view property and then in the
12:40 - viewdidload you can instantiate it with
12:42 - a whatever size you want and after that
12:46 - you set translates Auto resize a mask
12:48 - into constraints to false because you're
12:51 - going to be specifying those Auto layout
12:54 - constraints yourself so you don't want
12:56 - the system to automatically convert that
12:58 - Auto resize mask into constraints for
13:00 - you then you're going to add that view
13:02 - into the route view of your view
13:05 - controller and then finally you're going
13:07 - to add the constraints in this case they
13:09 - are centering
13:10 - it and then they're also adding a bottom
13:15 - attribute now there's a note here that
13:18 - says we don't give it a specific height
13:20 - or width as the provided ad size will
13:22 - give the banner and intrinsic content
13:24 - size to size the view so it's talking
13:26 - about this guy right here this ad size
13:29 - that you're passing in it kind of gives
13:31 - that better view and intrinsic size the
13:34 - other way to add a banner view is
13:36 - through the interface builder and for
13:37 - the sake of the beginners watching this
13:39 - video I'm actually going to do it this
13:40 - way now in this way we are going to be
13:45 - using the storyboard we're gonna be
13:47 - adding the banner of you and then
13:48 - specifying a height and width that we
13:51 - want to get ads for and then we're going
13:55 - to position it then we're going to
13:56 - connect this banner view as an iboutlet
13:59 - property so we can trigger the ad for it
14:02 - now the the thing is you're not going to
14:06 - find GAD banner view in the storyboard
14:09 - so we jump into the storyboard here and
14:11 - we open up the object library that's
14:13 - this button up here you type in gasps
14:15 - man interview you can't you can't find
14:17 - it right what you do is in the view
14:21 - controller you can import get or Google
14:25 - mobile ads and you can take a look at
14:27 - this class GAD banner view what sort of
14:30 - classes this is subclass of and if you
14:33 - just hold down option on your keyboard
14:36 - and click it you can see that its
14:38 - subclasses UI view so essentially you
14:41 - just need to add a UI view into your
14:43 - storyboard and set the custom class the
14:45 - GAD banner view so let's erase that come
14:49 - back here and we are going to add a UI
14:52 - view
14:55 - and we are going to set the height and
14:58 - width of this guy to 320 by 50 as the
15:02 - documentation set we are going to
15:04 - horizontally Center this guy and we are
15:07 - going to add a bottom constraint of
15:09 - let's say let's say 20 and you can see
15:15 - our battery there it's white on white
15:17 - does he can't really see it but when we
15:19 - display an ad in there you'll be able to
15:21 - see it oh I almost forgot
15:24 - highlight that uiview set the custom
15:27 - class to get a banner view yeah if you
15:31 - don't do that it's just going to be a
15:32 - basic UI view now go into the assistant
15:35 - editor we are going to connect this
15:39 - banner view here as an iboutlet let's
15:43 - call this banner view and then let's go
15:46 - back to the documentation it's going to
15:50 - the view controller here and see how
15:52 - exactly do we load up and add into that
15:55 - banner view element alright it's
15:58 - configured ad banner view properties so
16:01 - there are two that we need to set one is
16:03 - the root view controller this view
16:05 - controller is used to present an overlay
16:07 - when the ad is clicked it should
16:09 - normally be set to the view controller
16:10 - that contains the GAT banner view so
16:13 - that's easy we just set it to self the
16:16 - other one is the ad unit ID now inside
16:21 - your AdMob dashboard you would be coming
16:25 - here to ad units and you would basically
16:27 - create a if you are going to display a
16:30 - 320 by 50 banner ad in your app you need
16:33 - to create that ad unit in here and
16:35 - you're going to get a specific ID for it
16:37 - and then you're going to be setting that
16:39 - ID here so counter view dot ad unit ID
16:45 - you're going to set it to that banner
16:48 - view that view controller equals self
16:51 - that's the second one we need to set but
16:53 - remember what I told you about testing
16:55 - right so since we're testing we are
16:58 - going to use their test ID if we scroll
17:01 - all the way up that's this guy right
17:04 - here so we're going to use this
17:07 - test ad that's the ID for that and we
17:10 - paste it in there and then let's see
17:15 - what else we have to do we're gonna have
17:17 - to load an ad right so this is the code
17:20 - for that batter view download and then
17:22 - create a new guide request the object
17:25 - represents a single ad requesting
17:27 - contain properties for things like
17:28 - targeting information let's give that a
17:34 - try save it and then we're gonna run it
17:47 - so there we go we've loaded a test ad in
17:51 - the bottom right there and that's how
17:53 - easy it is to implement AdMob ads for
17:56 - your app now I highly encourage you to
17:58 - read further remember there are
18:01 - different ad formats you can do write
18:03 - interstitial native ads and rewarded
18:05 - videos and also you can listen to events
18:08 - for your banner view if you handle this
18:12 - GAD Banner View protocol and set your
18:15 - view controller as a delegate for it you
18:18 - can hear events such as when it's
18:20 - actually loaded and AD when the requests
18:22 - failed and stuff like that so I'll link
18:25 - to this documentation below the video so
18:28 - you can check it out and if you want the
18:30 - source code you'll also find it in the
18:31 - description below the video so what do
18:34 - you think pretty easy right if you like

18:46 - over to you guys the question of the day
18:48 - is on the topic of banner ads are you
18:51 - interested in building apps to make
18:53 - money in the App Store and provide a
18:55 - little side income or are you interested
18:57 - in building apps just for your hobby or
18:59 - something else let me know by leaving a
19:01 - quick comment below and I'm gonna be
19:03 - sure to read all of your responses ok
