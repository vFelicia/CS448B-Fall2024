00:05 - hello welcome to this lesson where I'm
00:09 - going to show you some common auto
00:11 - layout constraint errors and how to fix
00:13 - them so you can add Auto layout
00:16 - constraints in two ways one is through
00:18 - the storyboard like I'm about to show
00:20 - you and the second way is
00:22 - programmatically through Swift code I'm
00:24 - going to show you both ways but we're
00:26 - gonna start with the storyboard version
00:29 - so first let me just put the text field
00:32 - onto the view and I'm going to add some
00:37 - constraints to it now by horizontally
00:41 - and vertically centering it in the
00:43 - container and then I'm gonna go here and
00:46 - select update frames and you can see how
00:48 - it's so small because I don't have any
00:50 - height and width constraints to it so
00:52 - I'm gonna select that click this icon
00:54 - right here and I'm gonna add a height
00:57 - and a width so for width I'm gonna add a
00:59 - hundred and for height I'm gonna put 40
01:01 - so let's add these two constraints now
01:04 - let's update frames again and now we
01:08 - have this text field that's in the
01:10 - center now sometimes because you have so
01:12 - many elements on the screen and you're
01:15 - adding so many constraints that you can
01:17 - accidentally add constraints that would
01:19 - conflict with the constraints that you
01:22 - have already added so in other words
01:24 - that element can't simultaneously
01:27 - satisfy all of the constraints that
01:30 - you've put on it and remember constraint
01:33 - is nothing more than a rule so if you're
01:35 - you know having two rules here saying
01:37 - that it should be horizontally centered
01:39 - in the screen and vertically centered on
01:41 - the screen and then I'm going to add
01:43 - another rule to say that it should be
01:47 - zero margin from the top and zero margin
01:49 - from the left let me add these two so
01:52 - you can see now instantly there's all
01:54 - these red lines because on one hand two
01:58 - of my constraints put the location of
02:00 - the text field up here on the other hand
02:03 - the other two constraints put it in the
02:05 - middle here so you see all these red
02:07 - lines indicating that there are it's an
02:11 - error conflicting constraints
02:13 - you click this red button up here and if
02:16 - you don't see this doc there's a little
02:19 - button here in the lower left hand
02:21 - corner where you can hide and show this
02:23 - document outline so you click this
02:25 - little red guy right here you can see
02:28 - that here are the conflicting
02:30 - constraints and if you just run your
02:32 - mouse over it you can see which ones
02:34 - they are and you can fix them so what
02:36 - happens if I just run the app now which
02:39 - I'm going to do to show you well the
02:42 - system in order to produce a layout it's
02:48 - going to break some constraints in order
02:50 - to satisfy as many constraints as it can
02:53 - so you can see right here there's a
02:55 - faint grey outline along the edges of
02:58 - the simulator you you might have to look
03:01 - hard to notice it but what it's done is
03:03 - it's broken my height and width
03:05 - constraint for the text field so it's
03:09 - broken those two constraints so that it
03:11 - can adhere to the centering constraints
03:16 - as well as the left and top zero margin
03:19 - constraints so by breaking the height
03:22 - and width constraint it's just made my
03:24 - text box or my text field huge in order
03:27 - to satisfy those four constraints the or
03:30 - the two different positioning ones that
03:32 - were conflicting so that's how it would
03:35 - work and furthermore in the console down
03:36 - here you scroll all the way to the top
03:39 - you can see the it tells you unable to
03:42 - simultaneously satisfy the constraints
03:44 - and so that's your indication that
03:48 - something is wrong
03:49 - so when you're laying out these
03:50 - constraints on the storyboard it's it's
03:52 - very easy to see what's wrong or it's
03:55 - really easy to get an idea of what's
03:57 - happening because of all these red lines
03:59 - and actually an aside if you don't see
04:03 - this console what you want to do is make
04:05 - sure that you have this tab highlighted
04:07 - because you can close the console window
04:09 - like that and if you don't have this
04:12 - bottom drawer at all its this top icon
04:14 - here you can hide it and show it okay so
04:18 - now let's go into programmatic
04:20 - constraints so I'm just going to get rid
04:23 - of the text field here
04:26 - so our view is empty and I'm gonna save
04:29 - it I'm going to go into the view
04:30 - controller here I've commented out all
04:34 - of this code but I'm gonna comment them
04:38 - back in and I'm gonna show you with
04:42 - programmatic constraints you can also
04:45 - have errors it's a little harder to
04:48 - debug but in my experience it's usually
04:52 - at least for beginners it's usually one
04:55 - or two different things that could be
04:58 - the problem
05:08 - so just remember when you have an
05:10 - element that you want to add constraints
05:13 - to if you're adding size constraints
05:15 - like I'm doing here
05:17 - adding the height and width you want to
05:19 - add the constraints to the actual
05:21 - element so my text field add constraints
05:26 - now if you're adding layout constraints
05:29 - here be sure to add them to the parent
05:34 - container of the element that you want
05:36 - to position so in this case we want to
05:38 - position the text field right so these
05:40 - two constraints we want to add it to the
05:43 - parent that contains the text field in
05:45 - this case it's the view controllers view
05:47 - so self refers to the view controller
05:50 - because I'm writing this code in side
05:52 - view controller dot Swift and view is
05:55 - the view property of the view controller
05:57 - which references the view and you can
06:01 - see up here that I've placed the text
06:05 - field as a sub view of the view so in
06:09 - other words the view is the parent
06:11 - container of this text field right so
06:14 - that's why I'm adding these positioning
06:15 - constraints to the view now if you added
06:19 - these positioning constraints to the to
06:23 - the text field itself you're gonna get
06:25 - an error I'll show you
06:27 - so let's do my text field dot add
06:31 - constraints and I'm adding these
06:32 - positioning constraints this is gonna
06:34 - cause an error because I'm gonna run it
06:36 - now because remember the positioning
06:40 - constraints you want to add it to the
06:41 - parent container of the element so let's
06:45 - see what we have in the console here we
06:47 - scroll all the way up and you can see it
06:49 - doesn't even highlight the line that is
06:52 - wrong so you can't always rely on this
06:55 - where it's crashing
06:57 - so go into the console here scroll all
06:59 - the way to the top the view hierarchy is
07:01 - not prepared for the constraint so
07:03 - that's your clue that indicates that
07:06 - that might be a problem so check that
07:08 - your size constraints are being applied
07:10 - to the element and your position
07:12 - constraints are being applied to the
07:14 - parent container of the element okay so
07:17 - let's stop this and let's undo
07:20 - so it will run again so that's one
07:23 - common problem that I see another common
07:26 - problem is that when you're adding these
07:28 - position and constraints even though
07:30 - you're adding it to the view you know
07:33 - the container the parent of the element
07:36 - you have to make sure that that element
07:38 - is actually added to the view first so
07:44 - if I forget to add the element to the
07:47 - view you can see up here I've just
07:50 - created it I've created some size
07:52 - constraints then I've added those size
07:54 - constraints to the textfield element and
07:56 - then I proceed to add these positioning
07:58 - constraints to the view but nowhere have
08:03 - I actually put the textfield element
08:05 - into the view and because these two
08:08 - positioning constraints refer to the
08:12 - text field for positioning within that
08:16 - view it can't because the text field
08:19 - actually isn't in the view yet so now if
08:23 - I run it I'll show you what kind of
08:24 - error you get so it crashes scroll up
08:32 - all the way up here in the console the
08:35 - view hierarchy is not prepared for the
08:36 - constraint yep you read that right it's
08:39 - the same error message as the the other
08:42 - mistake that I just showed you right so
08:45 - if you see a mistake like this an error
08:47 - message the view hockey is not prepared
08:49 - for the constraint then you want to
08:51 - check two things first of all if you're
08:53 - positioning that element I'm gonna undo
08:56 - now has that element been added to the
09:00 - container view or the the view and if
09:05 - you're adding positioning constraints
09:06 - are you adding it to the parent
09:09 - container of that element and if you're
09:12 - adding size constraints are you adding
09:14 - it to the element itself so those are
09:18 - the things to check when you get that
09:20 - that sort of error and I see this quite
09:24 - it's quite common so be sure to keep an
09:26 - eye out for it I hope that was helpful
09:28 - to you guys and stay tuned for more
09:30 - helpful videos to help you resolve Xcode
