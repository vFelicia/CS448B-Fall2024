00:00 - should you create your user interface
00:01 - programmatically or with interface
00:03 - builder if you do a little bit of
00:05 - googling you'll be met with articles
00:07 - with headlines like these life without
00:10 - interface builder why I don't use
00:12 - storyboard why I fell out of love with
00:14 - storyboards you get the idea
00:16 - let me tell you I was a huge advocate of
00:19 - building the UI programmatically in fact
00:21 - in my last workplace I led the movement
00:23 - to build all of our UI programmatically
00:26 - for all of our projects but now I am a
00:28 - huge fan of interface builder and
00:30 - storyboards and in this video I'll tell
00:32 - you why
00:33 - I'll also tell you what you should be
00:34 - using depending on what type of person
00:36 - you are stay tuned
00:42 - welcome to code with Kris the place to
00:45 - be if you want to learn how to make an
00:46 - app I'm Kris and I'm so glad you're here
00:48 - now just in case you don't know what
00:50 - we're talking about in this video take a
00:52 - look at this button I can do it through
00:54 - code like this or I can do it through X
00:57 - codes visual interface builder which
01:00 - method is better well to answer that
01:01 - question we need to look at some cold
01:03 - hard facts number one it's tough to get
01:07 - the entire picture with interface
01:08 - builder Chris what are you talking about
01:10 - if laid out all there man yes but there
01:12 - are a ton of options check boxes and
01:15 - dropdowns and interface builder I have
01:16 - to click into every single element and
01:18 - look through all of these options just
01:21 - to see if you've changed anything and
01:23 - then don't forget for each element there
01:25 - is filled a size inspector and an
01:27 - identity inspector as well with the
01:30 - programmatic UI it's easy because I can
01:31 - just read every single line of code and
01:33 - I can see what you're changing to that
01:35 - element if you don't have a line of code
01:37 - changing a specific property for that
01:39 - element then I know that that value
01:41 - hasn't changed
01:42 - [Music]
01:44 - number 2 loading storyboards in Xcode is
01:47 - notoriously slow in Xcode when you try
01:50 - to open up a storyboard it's gonna take
01:52 - a couple of seconds to load before you
01:54 - can work with it and that wait time is
01:56 - gonna get longer as your storyboard gets
01:58 - more and more bloated now this issue can
02:00 - be lessened a little bit if you split
02:02 - your storyboards up into smaller
02:03 - storyboards what you should be doing
02:05 - anyways as a best practice when you're
02:07 - working with storyboards to be honest
02:09 - this isn't going to bug you much when
02:11 - you're a beginner but as your skill
02:13 - level gets higher and higher it's going
02:15 - to become increasingly frustrating
02:17 - because at that point Xcode can't keep
02:19 - up with you number three when you're
02:22 - working in a team it's easier to resolve
02:24 - conflicts with a programmatic UI if two
02:27 - people modified the same piece of code
02:29 - in the same file then you're going to
02:30 - get a conflict but that's alright
02:32 - because it's very easy to look at the
02:34 - two offending lines of code and decide
02:36 - how to merge them or which ones to keep
02:38 - with a conflict in the storyboard
02:40 - however you're going to be looking at
02:41 - two pieces of XML and you're gonna have
02:43 - to be able to interpret what they mean
02:45 - so you can decide how to resolve that
02:48 - conflict and reading and understanding
02:50 - that underlying XML of the storyboard is
02:52 - not easy because it's not always human
02:55 - readable so that adds to the difficulty
03:00 - okay so I know it's looking pretty bad
03:02 - for interface builder now but let's put
03:04 - some on the scoreboard for it shall we
03:06 - number four interface builder is faster
03:09 - for constructing a UI if you're building
03:11 - a UI from scratch and you're familiar
03:13 - with using interface builder I've got to
03:15 - say that specifying constraints in
03:17 - interface builder is a lot faster than
03:19 - having to type out all that code I mean
03:21 - take a look at me centering this button
03:23 - if I were to code these constraints out
03:25 - I'd have to type this there's an
03:26 - interesting video by Brian moon of let's
03:28 - build that app where he times himself
03:30 - building the same UI using interface
03:33 - builder and then again doing it purely
03:35 - in code I'm not gonna spoil it for you
03:37 - but do note that he is using some custom
03:39 - extensions that allow him to specify
03:41 - auto layout constraints in code without
03:43 - typing out that much code
03:46 - number five store boards are great at
03:49 - conveying a sense of the apps flow for a
03:52 - new person jumping onto an existing
03:54 - project glancing at the store board can
03:56 - tell a lot about how the screens flow
03:58 - from one to the next but if it's a
04:00 - purely coded UI you're gonna have to
04:02 - take a little more time to look at the
04:04 - code and understand what's going on so
04:07 - now you might be thinking programmatic
04:09 - UI is the winner well no it depends who
04:13 - you're talking to when I was learning
04:15 - Iowa's app development
04:16 - I found interface builder confusing and
04:18 - buggy I felt like I was at the mercy of
04:20 - its quirks and glitches do keep in mind
04:23 - that this was back in Xcode 3 and it's
04:24 - come a long way whereas when I wrote
04:26 - code to generate the UI I felt like I
04:28 - was in control and it felt like it I was
04:30 - at home so that's what I did I built all
04:33 - of my UI programmatically I think part
04:35 - of why it felt so natural to me was
04:37 - because I had a programming background
04:39 - that's what I did I wrote code for a
04:41 - living so I felt very comfortable with
04:43 - it since I was the first and only person
04:45 - at the company who worked with iOS as
04:47 - our team grew everyone followed the same
04:50 - trend they built all of the UI
04:52 - programmatically that is until one day
04:54 - Kiev ash came in he was trained in the
04:57 - ways of the storyboard and poor guy he
04:59 - didn't stand a chance his arguments for
05:02 - using interface builder and storyboards
05:04 - Justin holed up against the rest of us I
05:06 - think we were about six guys at that
05:09 - point so it was six versus one in the
05:11 - end we converted him and he had to work
05:13 - our way because that's the way the rest
05:15 - of the team was doing it when I left the
05:17 - company to teach iOS I realized what a
05:19 - godsend storyboards an interface builder
05:21 - was try telling someone who's never
05:24 - written a single line of code that in
05:26 - order to put a button on the screen they
05:28 - had to type this out I began to realize
05:30 - that for beginners with no programming
05:31 - experience learning how to code is
05:34 - frigging intimidating and it's hugely
05:37 - psychological as well it's like when
05:39 - they start out they have this breaking
05:41 - point and each time they get frustrated
05:42 - it builds up if they reach this breaking
05:45 - point they just give up and they abandon
05:47 - learning iOS however as the learner
05:49 - makes small wins and little
05:50 - accomplishment that tolerance gets
05:52 - higher and higher until they have gone
05:54 - deep enough and they start to find it
05:56 - fun then that's when the breaking point
05:59 - disappears
06:00 - all together so that's why I use
06:02 - storyboards an interface builder in all
06:04 - of my teaching because most of my
06:05 - audience is just starting out and I know
06:08 - they're going to eventually reach a
06:09 - point where they're comfortable with
06:10 - code and then they can start learning to
06:13 - build their user interfaces
06:14 - programmatically in fact in all of
06:16 - apples beginner guides they use
06:18 - storyboards as well so back to the
06:20 - original question should you build your
06:22 - user interface programmatically or with
06:25 - interface builder if you're a beginner
06:27 - who has never coded before start with
06:29 - storyboards if you're a beginner in iOS
06:32 - development but you have prior coding
06:34 - experience start with programmatic UI I
06:36 - think you'll feel much more at home if
06:38 - you're working in a team environment you
06:40 - have to roll with whatever technique
06:42 - that project is using but if it's a
06:44 - fresh project I would recommend the
06:46 - programmatic method this also implies
06:48 - that you need to know how to work with
06:49 - both the programmatic approach and the
06:52 - storyboard approach and finally if
06:54 - you're working solo then do whatever
06:55 - makes you happy
06:56 - and don't forget it doesn't have to be
06:59 - so black and white if you're working on
07:01 - a solo project and you feel a lot more
07:03 - comfortable with storyboards go ahead
07:05 - you do you and if you want to do a
07:07 - little bit of programmatic UI with a
07:08 - little bit of storyboard you can do that
07:10 - too
07:11 - in fact Shaun Allen has this method
07:13 - called skeletal storyboards go check out
07:15 - that video now if you want to learn iOS
07:17 - development with a step-by-step plan
07:19 - using storyboards then you have to check
07:21 - out my beginner playlist just click on
07:24 - that short playlist that you see on your
07:25 - screen right there and I'll see you over
07:27 - in those videos okay and that's a wrap
