00:00 - hi I'm Chris and I'm going to show you
00:01 - how to add buttons to your navigation
00:03 - bar so I've got a simple xcode demo here
00:06 - that is just a single text element let's
00:08 - add a navigation bar by wrapping this
00:11 - element inside a navigation
00:18 - stack all right and now we have a
00:20 - navigation bar although you can't see it
00:23 - in order to help you visualize it why
00:24 - don't I add a navigation title this
00:27 - isn't
00:28 - necessary uh for adding the buttons in
00:31 - the navigation bar but it does sort of
00:34 - give you a reference of where that bar
00:36 - is now the actual modifier you want to
00:39 - use to add the bar buttons it's called
00:41 - toolbar and it's a common mistake to try
00:45 - to add it here on the navigation stack
00:47 - what you want to do is add it to the
00:50 - element inside of the navigation stack
00:52 - so while we go ahead and do that and
00:55 - inside the toolbar you're going to add
00:58 - your buttons there is is a toolbar
01:02 - button
01:03 - item and first of all we're going to use
01:06 - this one and let's just add the you know
01:09 - a text that
01:11 - says settings perhaps now it just
01:14 - appears there by default but if you
01:16 - wanted to uh customize the placement
01:19 - let's say you want to put it on the left
01:21 - well the toolbar item has a parameter
01:23 - called placement and you can
01:26 - specify uh it is going to be top bar
01:29 - leading or trailing so this would move
01:32 - it to the uh left if you wanted to make
01:35 - this a button you definitely could I
01:37 - just made it a text for demonstration
01:40 - purposes so let's assume that we want to
01:43 - add another
01:45 - one on the right hand side and for the
01:48 - placement I'm going to put it on the
01:50 - right and for the content why don't we
01:53 - try making this a button and we are
01:56 - going to um for the action let's leave
02:00 - it as a to-do and for this let's put an
02:04 - image and we're going to add an icon
02:07 - here or it say plus and it's really that
02:11 - simple and that's how you add buttons to
02:13 - your navigation bar in Swift UI for more
