00:01 - hey coders what's up hope you guys had a
00:04 - great new year it's the first day back
00:06 - in the office for me but you know I
00:08 - haven't been slacking because I've been
00:10 - creating videos for you guys up until
00:12 - December 31st now it's the first weekday
00:15 - of January and I'm back with a brand new
00:17 - video for you guys we're going to take a
00:19 - break from looking at github libraries
00:22 - and instead spend the next few lessons
00:24 - looking at building an app together
00:26 - remember when I asked you guys to tell
00:29 - me what you guys wanted to see well I
00:31 - was surprised that a whole bunch of
00:33 - people mentioned they wanted to know how
00:35 - to build a soundboard app and since it's
00:37 - a pretty simple app to build I'm going
00:40 - to spend the next few lessons maybe
00:41 - three or four lessons just building this
00:43 - out for you guys and there's probably
00:45 - gonna be enough time to even themed it
00:47 - and so I chose a Star Wars theme now
00:50 - probably would have been better if I did
00:52 - this before the movie came out in
00:54 - December but whatever I actually haven't
00:57 - even seen the movie yet I've been really
00:59 - meaning to and I do enjoy the Star Wars
01:01 - movies I'm not a die-hard fan or
01:03 - anything but I do enjoy them but over
01:05 - the holidays my whole family got sick
01:07 - I'm the lone survivor I'm still not sick
01:10 - so I'm thankful for that but pretty much
01:12 - we were home ridden for the holidays did
01:14 - you guys see the movie and did you like
01:16 - it let me know in the comments section
01:18 - below
01:18 - but please don't spoil anything for me
01:21 - because I do intend to see it so don't
01:22 - write a comment like revealing the end
01:25 - or anything like that but anyways the
01:27 - app we're going to build here is a
01:28 - soundboard app it's gonna be very very
01:30 - simple I've got some Star Wars sounds
01:33 - here and let me play them for you
01:38 - and this one's my favorite how creepy is
01:42 - that so I got these sounds from this
01:46 - website The Sound Archive dot-com / Star
01:49 - Wars you can go to the URL as you can
01:51 - see on the screen or I'll put this link
01:53 - in the description below if you are
01:55 - going to use these sounds in an app that
01:57 - you're gonna sell or put in an app store
01:59 - or something I would just check the
02:01 - licensing I didn't check so I'm not sure
02:03 - please do not link to these files
02:05 - they're intended for entertainment
02:07 - purposes so you know I would just look
02:08 - for some information or permission
02:11 - regarding whether or not you could
02:12 - include these sounds in your app but
02:14 - here I'm just using it for the demo to
02:16 - show you guys how to build a soundboard
02:18 - app and this isn't the finished product
02:20 - I just whip this up quickly before
02:22 - recording the video I do want to theme
02:24 - it and style it I think we can spare a
02:26 - lesson to do that so I hope you guys are
02:28 - as excited as I am to build this and
02:30 - I'll see you guys in the next few
02:32 - lessons where we're going to do just
02:34 - that
02:34 - all right talk to you guys tomorrow bye
