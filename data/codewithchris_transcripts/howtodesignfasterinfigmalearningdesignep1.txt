00:00 - Today I want to share with you how I
learned how to design user interfaces
00:04 - in Figma at blazing fast speeds
using styles and components.
00:09 - Hey, everyone, it's JC here
designer at quote with Chris.
00:12 - So I was a copywriter by profession,
00:14 - but I also always had a passion
for design in general.
00:16 - And later on develop a strong
interest in UI and UX design.
00:20 - Now I'm becoming a better designer
every day through practice and study.
00:24 - And this series is about the journey.
00:26 - If you have an interest in design,
00:28 - I hope I can inspire you
to pursue it without further Ado.
00:31 - Let's start learning design.
00:34 - So episode one is going to be all about
00:36 - how I learned how to design fast using
styles and components and Figma.
00:40 - But before we dive into that,
00:42 - I first want to introduce you
to the principle or the framework behind
00:45 - all this, which is
the atomic design framework.
00:49 - Buzzword I know, but give me
a minute here it'll be quick.
00:52 - So the ADF is a framework that was
00:55 - authored by Brad Frost, who also happens
to be a designer speaker consultant.
01:00 - And he came up with this framework to help
anyone understand the process
01:04 - of effectively building a digital
product like a website or an app.
01:08 - So the ADF goes like this.
01:10 - So we have the atoms, the molecules,
01:13 - the organisms, templates
and pages first are the atoms.
01:17 - So if you remember your science class,
atoms are the most basic element of matter
01:22 - in the same way that it is
the most basic element in the UI.
01:25 - So in a UI, these are usually the colors,
the typography, pictures or illustrations
01:31 - and eye concepts that
you'll use in your UI.
01:34 - Basically, these are the most
01:36 - bare minimum elements that are
needed in your interface.
01:40 - So if you are going to follow this
framework, you need to work on your atoms
01:44 - first before you start moving on to your
organisms, molecules and so on.
01:49 - And once you've identified those,
you move on to the molecules.
01:53 - The molecules are like elements like
01:55 - buttons, input fields,
search fields, and so on.
02:00 - And then after that you combine these
02:02 - molecules and then you form
an organism or organisms.
02:07 - So organisms are basically combined
molecules, as you can see here.
02:11 - So these are buttons and three buttons,
02:13 - individual buttons that were
combined and they form a tab bar.
02:16 - So as you can see,
02:17 - some examples of organisms are
sidebars tab bars, headers and so on.
02:22 - So from there put all your organisms
02:24 - together and you'll have a template
like what you can see right here.
02:27 - So in this template we have
the header and the tab bar.
02:30 - And we're referring to Chris as a template
02:31 - because we can always drag and drop these
templates or copy and paste these
02:35 - templates into whichever page that we like
or whichever page that it is suitable.
02:40 - As an example, just copy
and paste this one.
02:42 - Copy and paste this one as well.
02:44 - And from here we'll just change the
02:48 - indicator to contacts,
drag it to the contacts
02:55 - and change this contacts.
And that's a template.
03:01 - So we can always change the details like
the page title and all other content
03:04 - accordingly, depending on what we want,
because essentially it is a template
03:08 - and it functions as any other
template that you know.
03:11 - So finally, after you have a template,
you can now combine these together
03:14 - and have a page like a home page product
page setting page, which are now elements
03:21 - on the final stage of your
UI design process.
03:23 - So here, for example,
what I'm going to show you is just create
03:28 - the body of this chat list page
or the homepage of the chat app.
03:32 - And here's an example of an organism.
03:34 - So this contains the atoms such as our
03:36 - type or typography, and a picture
that we showed you a while ago.
03:41 - So from here, I'll just
duplicate this command D
03:47 - and let it fill the screen just like that.
03:50 - So here we now have a full
fledged homepage of the chat.
03:54 - And basically that's all you need to know
03:56 - about the ADF or the atomic
design framework.
03:59 - So the reason I wanted to share this
04:00 - with you first is because this is the same
framework that I also follow here
04:04 - at Kolisus Chris when designing apps,
and as a result of that,
04:07 - I am able to create a full
fledged UI within a day or two.
04:11 - Well, of course,
04:11 - provided that the requirements and
wireframes have already been approved.
04:16 - So yeah, the main reason why you want
to follow this framework, too,
04:19 - by designing your own UI
is because it's efficient.
04:22 - It's as simple as that.
04:23 - When you work and finalize elements
04:25 - starting from the smallest one,
you lessen the time that you'll have
04:29 - to spend tweaking or finding
the colors or fonts.
04:31 - For example.
04:32 - Also, if you're also coding your own UI,
then this is also another reason why you
04:37 - should go down this route,
because this way you're already able
04:40 - to organize the assets that you'll
need later on in the project.
04:43 - So how do we materialize
this framework in Figma?
04:46 - Well, we can do that with style
guides and components.
04:48 - And for this video,
04:49 - we'll use the home page and chat page of
our newly released chat app as reference.
04:53 - Make sure to check out Colutris dot
com to know more about that minicours.
04:57 - All right.
04:58 - So for atoms, we'll basically choose a few
colors and fun styles and icons that we'll
05:03 - use for these pages only the home page
and the chat page, as I mentioned.
05:07 - And basically for our style guide.
05:09 - Since we're only using two pages as
05:11 - an example, we'll just keep
it as simple as we can.
05:14 - But of course, if you're going to create
05:16 - a style guide for an actual project or
an actual app with more than 30 or 50
05:21 - pages, then it makes more sense
to have a comprehensive style guide.
05:25 - But I hope this will give you an idea
on how to get started from here.
05:29 - Let's just say that these are the colors
05:31 - that I want to use
for the UI of the chat app.
05:35 - So let's just say that we
already skip that part.
05:39 - So you can always choose whichever
color palette that you want for your app.
05:44 - In my case, these were
the colors that I wanted to use.
05:47 - So from here, let's
just create the styles.
05:49 - So create style by clicking on color,
press on the right panel,
05:53 - click on style and click
on the plus icon to create style.
05:57 - So here let's just say this is the blue,
06:07 - and that basically converts it
into a blue category or blue group.
06:11 - And this is the sub category,
which is the primary.
06:15 - So here's another example.
06:16 - So click on the plus icon
again, blue secondary.
06:22 - And when you click on the icon,
you see that this is the blue.
06:27 - The subclasses are primary and secondary.
06:30 - So that's basically how
styles work and Figma.
06:33 - So let's just fast forward this.
06:34 - But I hope that gives you an idea already.
06:53 - All right.
06:53 - So we're done with creating
styles for our colors.
06:56 - So if you click on the empty space right
06:58 - here, you'll see all the color
styles listed on this right panel.
07:02 - So you have the blue primary,
07:04 - secondary background, primary, secondary
text, primary, secondary and tertiary.
07:08 - So basically these are all the colors
07:11 - that I want to use later on in this
project or in this video.
07:15 - But yeah, also, don't worry if you're
going to have some changes here later on.
07:19 - If you feel like the colors don't fit your
07:22 - taste, if you want to change them,
you can always do that.
07:24 - But basically, I hope this gives you
an idea on how to create styles and how
07:28 - to apply them efficiently as
you move towards your project.
07:32 - So let's move on to our fun styles.
07:35 - So this one is heading one subheading
paragraph, paragraph, semi bold caption.
07:40 - So here let's just say that this is
07:42 - already the font properties that I
want to use for my heading.
07:46 - So what I'm just going to do is create
07:48 - a style textile and make sure this
is named as Heading One or H one.
07:56 - There you go.
07:57 - And this one is great style subheaded.
08:03 - So let's just fast forward this again.
08:20 - Alright.
08:21 - So we're done creating the fun styles
or textiles for our demo project.
08:27 - So click on the empty
space right here again.
08:30 - So as you can see,
we now have a list of our textiles,
08:33 - our subheading, our heading one,
our paragraph styles.
08:36 - And I think we can do this right.
08:39 - P one regular, semi bold and caption.
08:43 - And yeah, that's our style guide,
and it's as simple as that.
08:46 - So next we move on to our component.
08:48 - So from here on out from the molecules
08:50 - to pages, we'll be using
components as often as we could.
08:54 - And in a few minutes, you'll know why
I think that Chris is more efficient.
08:58 - All right.
08:59 - So once we're done with our atoms, let's
create our molecules so our molecules.
09:03 - Let's just use this two as a reference.
09:05 - So our molecules include the buttons,
09:09 - and I think that's it molecules such
as the buttons and this chat bubble.
09:15 - I think these are molecules.
All right.
09:18 - So with our icons, by the way,
09:20 - these are also part of our atoms,
and we don't need to create a style guide
09:25 - for this because we just downloaded this
from the Internet, but open source icons
09:31 - back, so we can just copy and paste Chris
to your Figma workspace,
09:34 - and you don't need to do anything apart
from modify them according to your UI.
09:40 - But when it comes to styles,
09:42 - there's no need to style them
like what we did a while ago.
09:44 - All right, so here,
let's just create the chats button.
09:48 - So here, let's pull up this icon.
09:50 - Type in chat,
09:52 - and as you can see,
let's remove this style
09:55 - and make sure pull up our caption
regular style and drag it here.
10:01 - Select them both.
10:03 - Press Swift A, convert them to auto
10:06 - layout, and then make
sure that this is four
10:11 - and the alignment is in the center
10:14 - and change the color to make
sure to go to selection.
10:18 - Change the color to maybe
text secondary from there.
10:23 - Pull up this new chat icon.
10:25 - Just select this chat.
10:26 - You can just duplicate this new chat,
10:30 - and maybe this one can be paragraph
one or something like that.
10:38 - Or you can stick with caption,
10:42 - keep it consistent and select them both.
10:44 - Shift a same goes for contacts.
10:51 - Let's drag it here.
10:53 - Changes the contacts,
10:58 - change the color the secondary text.
11:01 - Select both Swift A and press four.
11:05 - Make sure it's vertically aligned,
horizontally centered.
11:08 - Let's remove the shadow here.
11:11 - There you go.
11:13 - These are our molecules,
11:17 - but we can modify them just a bit
more so we can change this to blue,
11:23 - change the selection colors to blue
11:26 - instead, this one will be blue,
and that's a lot better.
11:31 - So since this is a chat app,
we want to emphasize the new chat button
11:36 - because that's the main action
that we want them to do.
11:39 - So once we're done here,
we now have a set of molecules.
11:47 - So each of them are molecules.
11:49 - So we're not grouping them just yet
because we'll do that later on.
11:54 - But yeah, having them individually as
buttons are considered as molecules.
11:59 - So next up is let's put this outside.
12:03 - Next up is the chat bubble.
12:06 - So let's just copy paste or maybe
let's just pull up our
12:12 - Lord Epsom plugin so you can download
this on the Figma community.
12:15 - Lorim Epsom, the name of the plugin.
12:18 - So let's just type in.
12:20 - Create a text layer.
12:22 - Pull up the Lorem FM again.
12:25 - Make sure that maybe
two sentences is good.
12:29 - Paragraph one, P one regular.
12:31 - Change this to caption,
12:33 - change the color to text tertiary and make
sure that this is wrapped properly.
12:44 - Let's just delete.
12:46 - Let's just do this later on.
12:49 - But yeah, after this
press shift a, select the text.
12:54 - Press shift a and then
12:57 - since Chris is a chat bubble,
we want to make sure this is maybe 30 or
13:03 - 32 and then
add the background fill to blue
13:12 - and one change Chris to P one,
13:16 - change the color to background,
13:20 - and then change the padding, maybe 1616
and maybe just keep it 16 all throughout.
13:29 - All right, that's good.
13:31 - And then next thing I want to do to keep
13:34 - this lower right corner zero,
and that maintains it as
13:41 - a more realistic chat bubble.
13:43 - So chat bubble
13:48 - so you as a sender
13:52 - will have this blue chat bubble.
13:56 - I think that's good.
13:59 - We can always modify the size of this
14:01 - later on, but basically,
that's how it should work for container.
14:06 - All right, so now we have organisms.
14:11 - This is our next organism that we need
14:13 - to rather this is our next
molecule that we need to do.
14:18 - So we have our input fields right here.
14:21 - So that's great.
14:22 - The input field type in two A's.
14:26 - Let's Zoom in, type in the two as
press shift eight.
14:33 - Make sure that the corner
edges is around 50 maybe.
14:37 - And then make sure Apple a fill
14:40 - to that background layer is secondary
and just stretch this
14:46 - as far as you can or as far as you want
and then change the text color to tertiary
14:53 - or maybe secondary, because this
is just like a placeholder.
14:57 - Then after that,
15:00 - we now have an input field.
15:05 - So let's just double check
on the rise of this.
15:08 - So this is 285.
15:13 - So you can always change this.
15:15 - I just wanted this to be the same as
15:18 - my original design,
so you can always change this later on.
15:25 - All right.
So once we're done next is create our
15:30 - organisms or wait before we do that,
we also need to create Chris's picture.
15:36 - So we don't have Chris's picture here.
15:38 - So what I want to do is to just
15:44 - copy and paste this picture.
15:48 - What happened?
15:50 - Just detach this,
15:53 - press this picture and copy
and paste this here.
15:57 - So let's just say that I
imported this from my desktop.
16:00 - Doesn't really matter as long as you
have a picture we can use as an avatar.
16:04 - And from here, select your
picture frame selection.
16:09 - Right click on frame selection.
16:11 - Let's rename this to avatar.
16:14 - Next, change this to 100.
16:17 - Make sure and make sure
that it will be circle.
16:22 - The square will be converted
to a circle just like that.
16:27 - As you can see right here, Cress's face is
16:33 - going beyond the boundaries
of the frame or the CircleCI.
16:36 - So what you want to do is to clip
the content just like that.
16:40 - Let's change the fill to maybe blue.
16:45 - Just that good to go.
16:46 - Let's just change the I think that's okay.
All right.
16:52 - So let's just change the stroke,
apply some stroke here outside two.
16:59 - Who's good and Resize this to maybe 24.
17:06 - Sorry.
17:07 - Make sure to Select Chris portrait here or
17:11 - the picture that you're
using and select scale.
17:15 - Make sure to select scale before you
17:17 - Resize so that the picture itself inside
the frame will be able to scale as well.
17:22 - So change this to 24.
17:25 - Select the frame 24.
17:28 - There you go.
17:29 - Or maybe there's too small.
17:32 - Then use 32,
17:35 - maybe 44.
17:36 - All right, good to go outside.
17:38 - One, two.
17:42 - Finally, we now have our set of molecules.
17:45 - So from here we can create organisms.
17:48 - But before we do that,
17:50 - I just want to create the frame finally,
so that we can have a better scale.
17:54 - So open up the frame tool.
17:55 - Select
17:57 - any preset that you want.
Here.
17:59 - I want to use the iphone Eleven Pro
preset or the iphone ten preset.
18:04 - And I'm going to rename this as
18:09 - chat homepage,right?
18:12 - Just like that here,
18:16 - using our atoms,
18:19 - using our set of style guides, we'll just
change the background cocoa primary,
18:26 - and then finally, we can create
the organisms of the tab bar.
18:33 - So let's do that and press
auto layout and add a background color
18:45 - just like that.
18:46 - And let's put it right here.
18:50 - Change the adding to 30, 216, 20 and 20.
18:58 - Good to go.
19:01 - Make sure it snaps there you have it.
19:05 - Make sure they are all
aligned in the middle.
19:09 - And from here, just make sure
that it is vertically packed.
19:17 - So here I just want to make
this something like
19:32 - so the reason that they have different
19:35 - padding is because a while ago,
as you can see,
19:39 - the new chat button was slightly off
center, so it was a bit to the left.
19:45 - So I just modified the
19:48 - padding just a little bit so
that it won't affect usability.
19:52 - Anyway, they are just two pixels so
19:55 - that the new chat button will stay
in the middle, just like that.
19:59 - All right.
So from there next, we now have a tab bar.
20:06 - What I want to do next is
to create the list organism.
20:11 - The list grow.
So here, let's just type in Chris Ching.
20:17 - Duplicate that plug in placeholder.
20:23 - Lorimp some generate text.
20:25 - So change this textile to ibaction.
20:30 - I'm going to change the color to text.
20:33 - Tertiary
20:35 - and P one.
20:36 - Change the textile to semi boat, something
like that, or maybe regular is okay.
20:46 - Maybe somebody is okay.
Select them both.
20:50 - Make sure to press shift
a again auto layout.
20:54 - There you have it.
20:59 - Let's rename this to main text.
21:05 - Page the spacing to four, maybe zero,
just four to get clean.
21:13 - And then from here,
let's just Resize this a bit.
21:16 - Select this text layer the Laura Mapson
21:20 - placeholder, make sure
it's filled container.
21:23 - And then
21:26 - you can just Resize this accordingly.
21:28 - So let's delete this.
21:33 - Just crop that text from here.
21:36 - You have two frames.
21:37 - As you can see, there's
the auto layout frame.
21:39 - There's a normal avatar frame.
21:42 - Next, select them both and then press
21:45 - shift a and that will convert
them into an auto layout.
21:48 - From here, change the spacing to 16.
21:51 - This is the lowest list item.
21:56 - From here.
21:58 - Change the pattern 2016 or
maybe twelve and twelve.
22:09 - Change the background color to
background color from there.
22:15 - Now have
22:21 - a list item.
22:22 - But as you can see, it's
going beyond the boundaries of the frame.
22:30 - The quick fix to this is to just Resize
the text, make sure that it's filled
22:35 - container just like that and just
remove this excess text.
22:41 - Put a three dots there.
22:44 - There you have it.
22:45 - Also, we forgot to put some time here.
22:49 - So caption good text tertiary.
22:53 - Make sure that
22:55 - the text color is in tertiary
and just add this just like that.
23:00 - So that's the beauty of auto layout.
23:02 - You can just drag and drop things and it
will automatically snap to your frame.
23:08 - Okay, so let's Resize this again.
23:10 - This was the original state.
23:12 - Let's Resize that.
23:13 - And as you can see,
23:18 - Resize that.
23:20 - And I think we still have access to here.
23:24 - So let's just do this again or maybe
23:36 - something like that.
23:38 - There you have it.
23:39 - So now you have a list row.
23:41 - It goes from edge to edge.
23:43 - So this is basically our organism.
23:48 - We now have a list item.
All right.
23:52 - So I hope you now have an idea of what
atoms, molecules, and organisms are.
23:57 - I hope my demonstration worked
or helped your understanding.
24:01 - So what's left for me is to create
24:04 - a heading here that says Chats
and homepage or something like that.
24:09 - So using our existing atoms or I think I
could consider them as molecules because
24:17 - these icons themselves are standalone
secondary buttons.
24:22 - I treat them as secondary buttons because
24:25 - they are located here in my wife
and the original wife that I did.
24:30 - We have the text here.
24:32 - And these two buttons here can be
found in this section right here.
24:38 - So we'll just recreate that from scratch.
24:40 - So type in chats, change this to H one.
24:45 - Then let's just select them both
and just like that.
24:50 - So from here, what I'm going to do
is to select them both again.
24:53 - Press shift eight,
converge them to auto layout,
24:57 - change the spacing, maybe eight or twelve,
maybe 16.
25:03 - That's good.
25:04 - Change their color to text secondary
and change this color to text primary.
25:11 - All right.
From there, what I'm going to do is to set
25:15 - all of them both of them this frame
and this chat and press shifter again.
25:21 - And there you go.
25:22 - Now we have the heading,
25:26 - organism
25:29 - or header.
Rather, header is much more appropriate
25:36 - header.
Let's just snap this to the top
25:43 - and change the padding to 64
25:47 - and 32 and 20 changes.
25:57 - And of course, you want to make sure
25:59 - that they are spaced between
just like that and make sure that they are
26:05 - vertically aligned or
horizontally aligned.
26:09 - I'm really not sure which one is which.
26:12 - And there you have it.
26:14 - You now have the header.
26:17 - So now we have a template.
26:19 - We now have a set of organisms right here.
26:22 - We have the header just to recap.
26:24 - We have the header,
the list item and the tab bar.
26:29 - These are a collection of organisms.
26:32 - These are a collection of atoms.
26:35 - These are a collection of atoms.
26:37 - And these combined,
26:39 - they form a molecule and combined,
they form an organism right here.
26:47 - So this is one organism,
second organism, third organism.
26:51 - So combine them together.
26:52 - And now we have a template just like that.
26:54 - So why template? Because I can
just simply duplicate this.
27:01 - And now we have a chat homepage,
and it's as simple as that.
27:05 - Right.
27:06 - So yeah, if you want to have a better
understanding of this, we can always copy.
27:12 - Paste this system
and Gesture or Home button.
27:17 - Let's just copy and paste this here.
27:19 - And we'll have a better scale
of the App UI home indicator.
27:23 - Copy and paste this here.
27:28 - Now we have a chat homepage.
27:30 - We just redid the chat list from scratch,
and I think it's pretty much identical
27:36 - to what I initially
or what I originally designed.
27:39 - So next up is the actual chat view using
27:41 - this bubble in portfolio,
all the remaining components right here.
27:46 - So let's just duplicate this again
and remove this.
27:54 - Change this to subheadingtype in.
28:00 - Chris Chris,
because there's the actual chat.
28:04 - And let's just find a back button.
28:09 - So like I said a while ago,
28:10 - you don't need to worry if you don't have
anything laid out right
28:14 - from the beginning, as long as you
have most of them at your disposal.
28:18 - So here, as you can see,
I'm looking for the back button.
28:25 - I think this works.
28:28 - All right.
So what I'm going to do is just drag it
28:31 - here, select them both
and make sure that they are
28:38 - an algorithm and change
the direction to vertical.
28:42 - Just like that.
28:43 - Change the spacing to zero.
28:45 - And just like that,
I want to change this to 24.
28:51 - There you have it.
28:52 - Maybe change this to six or eight,
28:56 - and it's much more suitable.
29:00 - So from here, what I want to do
is to add an avatar right here.
29:04 - So what I'm going to do is just click on
this avatar frame and drag it right here.
29:11 - And there you go.
29:13 - You now have a header or our chat view
or chat view or chat page rather.
29:24 - And next thing you want
to do is just delete this
29:29 - because it's essentially a new page.
29:34 - So we can always change the background
29:36 - color of this if you want to add
a little bit of dimension.
29:40 - So maybe
29:42 - pure white.
29:43 - If it's not there, you can always
choose pure white, just like that.
29:50 - Just like that.
29:51 - So our header in pure white.
29:53 - And I think it's much better because
it adds a little bit of dimension.
29:57 - So it's not super
uniform from top to bottom.
30:02 - All right.
There you have it.
30:04 - And then from there,
we just need to drop this.
30:10 - So from here, we'll
create another organism.
30:15 - So we already have our molecules
right here the chat bubble.
30:18 - So what's left is to add
the time which it was sent.
30:24 - For example, so just click here and drag
30:27 - and drop copy and paste it
just beside this chat bubble or anywhere.
30:35 - Then press them both so I can both press
30:37 - shift a make sure that they
are spaced between
30:42 - and that they are in the center.
30:46 - So from here, let's just drag it here,
30:51 - snap them to their edges and make
sure that the padding is 2020.
30:58 - Next is to you can always duplicate this.
31:01 - Create another molecule receiver.
31:05 - So this one let's just change the
31:12 - let's just change the corner
on which we have a zero value.
31:17 - So here we have the lower left.
31:19 - Change it to zero.
31:20 - Change this back to Rebirth Chris
to 32 and change the color to blue.
31:25 - Secondary.
31:27 - Change the color to text
color through text primary
31:33 - and just duplicate it.
31:36 - Drag and drop.
31:37 - Select auto layout
center space between 20.
31:47 - Click there
31:49 - and there you have it.
31:55 - So depending on your preference, you can
always set the uniform padding like here.
31:58 - So we have 20 all throughout.
32:01 - You can set 1616,
32:07 - save some space,
or you can even set twelve.
32:14 - Save some space.
32:16 - And what's next is to create a component.
32:20 - So from here, I want to create a component
because this is basically close to final.
32:27 - Create a component.
32:29 - Create a component.
32:31 - Rename this to chat bubble
32:36 - receiver.
32:45 - And what I want to do is
to combine them as a variance.
32:48 - So select them both.
Combine them as a variance.
32:51 - So from here, just drag it
somewhere away from this chat page.
32:58 - So I can always just
33:02 - from here I can just select this
hold option and drag it here.
33:07 - So what this essentially does is now
that I have a component that I can change
33:12 - the property for when I
would design later on.
33:17 - So all I needed to do was to create
33:19 - two sets of properties for this
chat page or chat bubble.
33:24 - And from here, I can just duplicate them.
33:27 - So command D, I pressed command B,
33:33 - I just kept on duplicating them.
33:35 - And from here, I can just
33:38 - change the property of this
two receiver just like that.
33:42 - So now we have a chat page that was
just designed in around five minutes.
33:46 - I guess.
33:46 - So let's just say, for example,
in a specific scenario, this
33:51 - chat bubble had very small text within it,
so we can always just delete one,
33:58 - and the chat bubble will
automatically wrap around that text.
34:02 - So that's the beauty of auto layout.
34:03 - You don't have to worry about stuff not
being able to wrap around properly.
34:10 - So a while ago, as you
can see, I deleted them.
34:13 - But this
34:15 - item here did not follow the boundaries
34:20 - of this, so they still have
that space between them.
34:23 - So to solve that, what I
want to do is to create
34:28 - them all basically,
34:30 - and press shift a convert this all
the way out and rename this to body.
34:37 - So this is basically the body Chris,
34:38 - the header and we have an input field
later on, we'll design it here.
34:44 - So from here, since there's another
34:46 - layout, let's say, for example,
you replied four or five words,
34:51 - delete this, and now that automatically
wraps around that body text.
34:56 - So yeah, that's basically how I designed
this chat app 36 screens in one day,
35:04 - and we just need to finalize
our input field.
35:07 - So put the send and camera icon here.
35:12 - Change this to blue
35:16 - and change this to
maybe something like that.
35:22 - Yeah, that works.
All right.
35:24 - So next we have them all aligned.
Don't worry.
35:27 - If they're not aligned,
you can always just modify them later on.
35:30 - So from here, select them all,
press all the layout and select them.
35:35 - Make sure that they're
aligned at 16, 2014 or 16.
35:41 - It's okay.
35:42 - Always change them.
35:43 - Input section.
All right.
35:46 - From there, we now have our
input section, our input field.
35:51 - Just file some changes,
changes to 20, changes to 20 as well.
35:56 - And change this.
35:59 - Change the width of this to a bit smaller
36:04 - just so that we'll be able
to snap this on the SDKs.
36:09 - Now you have one.
36:10 - Change this to 32.
36:13 - Change this to 24,
36:16 - since Chris is just a secondary action.
36:19 - So now you have the input field
36:25 - and just always put the tab
bar back at the input field.
36:29 - Let's adjust this to the input field.
36:35 - Let's just adjust this to the side.
36:37 - But before we do that, as you can see,
when you drag something inside this body
36:42 - frame, it will automatically
go inside this frame.
36:46 - And we don't want that to happen.
36:47 - So to prevent that, you just need
to click on the body and lock it.
36:52 - You just lock
36:55 - so that whatever happens,
it won't snap inside that frame.
36:58 - So going back,
just change this right here.
37:02 - Modify it just like that and change
37:05 - the background color by the way,
to something like this.
37:08 - There you have it.
37:13 - Change the heading to 16.
37:20 - There you have it.
We now have the chat page.
37:22 - So I shared with you how great
components of this so you can use them.
37:29 - You can also Apple them on the list item
37:32 - if you want to create a different
screen that shows unread messages.
37:37 - So from here, let's just create component.
37:41 - And here let's just modify this
text will be primary as well.
37:46 - So these are basically this is basically
a text that hasn't been read yet.
37:53 - Just like that.
So create components as well.
37:57 - So rename this to Chris item and Conrad
38:06 - like this one, this item red, as you
probably already know, select them both.
38:12 - Combine as a variance and put them away.
38:17 - And from here, what I want
to do is just drag it here
38:23 - and delete all of them because
we now have a component.
38:26 - We don't have to worry about them
38:29 - and duplicate them
and keep on duplicating them as they reach
38:35 - the bottom of the tab bar or
as to reach Tabar section.
38:39 - All right.
So now let's see our components in action.
38:42 - So this is red.
38:44 - Let's say if it's on red, just like that.
38:48 - And that's how I designed these
things very fast in Figma.
38:54 - So I know that this video,
38:56 - the length of this video may say otherwise
that this is not as fast as you thought
39:01 - would, but once you master components,
it will allow you to design things very
39:07 - fast and stigma because you don't
have to recreate them from scratch.
39:11 - You can just rely on your components
and let them do the work.
39:14 - Here's one final example.
39:15 - Let's say I want to put
an indicator here on the tab bar.
39:20 - Let's create a rectangle
and change the height to maybe ten
39:27 - to maybe ten.
39:28 - And the wind is maybe
39:31 - 48.
Something like that.
39:34 - Maybe change the to eight.
39:36 - Change the Conrad is to maybe 1616 and 16.
39:44 - As you can see, we have this sort
of like Blade esque of an illustration.
39:51 - And let's lock this tab bar.
39:55 - Select this
39:57 - tab bar, unlock it and make sure frame
selection so that this rectangle will go
40:04 - inside this frame,
but not inside this tab bar.
40:08 - Auto layout frame.
40:09 - So let's just put it down a bit.
40:13 - Put it in front.
40:14 - Your tab bars should be in front
40:17 - so that it will naturally
cover this body items.
40:25 - So tab bars and heading items should be
40:28 - in front and the body
will be underneath those.
40:30 - So let's just put it back.
40:32 - Let's snap it just like that.
40:35 - Change the height to maybe six or four.
Yeah.
40:39 - Or is the sweet spot for me.
40:41 - Change the width to 48
40:48 - just like that and change
the color to primary blue.
40:53 - Now we have an indicator
40:56 - that indicates that we are in the Chat
page chat home page.
41:03 - Lock it.
41:04 - All right.
41:10 - From here.
Let's just
41:15 - duplicate this old option.
41:17 - Then create another one.
41:24 - Drag it to the Contacts page
contacts button rather.
41:28 - And name this as contacts.
41:38 - Duplicate this.
41:39 - This will be tabbarchat.
41:45 - Let's add space here right from here.
41:48 - Just create component command
option K command option K.
41:54 - Then from here, select them both.
41:56 - Combine as variants.
41:57 - Now you have
42:00 - collection or component parent component
42:02 - of tab bar that you can use for
chats and contacts pages.
42:10 - All right.
So here's an example.
42:13 - There's the chat page.
42:15 - I can just drag it here.
42:17 - List in front, but not super in front.
42:23 - The home indicator still be in front.
42:26 - There you go.
42:30 - So let's say, for example,
this St contact page.
42:36 - What I'm going to do is just
simply select the property.
42:39 - Select this, select the property,
search the contacts and that's it.
42:42 - We now have a tab bar
for the contacts page.
42:46 - All right.
42:47 - Atoms check molecules, check organisms,
check templates check.
42:52 - And now we just designed two pages using
those things that we just mentioned.
42:58 - So I apologize if this video wasn't
as short as you thought it would.
43:02 - So it's ironic that we're talking
about designing fast and efficient.
43:05 - And this video goes on for, like, 20 or
30 minutes, but you can't rush learning.
43:10 - So I hope this video gave you an idea
on how you can design very fast.
43:14 - And Sigma still using styles
43:15 - and components, even if it took quite some
time now, this is just the tip
43:20 - of the iceberg because there are so many
things that you can do with components,
43:24 - like creating a design system for your app
or company brand, something like that.
43:29 - But since we are all beginners here,
including me, yes,
43:32 - I consider myself a beginner because
I still have a lot to learn.
43:35 - I wanted to share what I learned so
that you'll be interested in exploring
43:39 - the vast potential of 1000 components
in Figma or even Figma as a whole.
43:44 - With that said, thank you for learning
43:46 - design with me and I'll
you in the next video.
