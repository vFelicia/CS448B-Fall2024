00:00 - hey code crew I can't believe it's March
00:02 - already in the last month's update I
00:03 - said that we're gonna lay down some
00:05 - groundwork before we started on the more
00:07 - complex apps and we have done that in
00:10 - February but there are a few more video
00:12 - topics that I'd like to cover around
00:14 - source control around using figma and
00:17 - designing apps and stuff like that but
00:19 - we're close we're definitely close it's
00:22 - funny how things move so much faster in
00:24 - your head versus reality I thought that
00:27 - I would be a lot farther along than I
00:30 - actually am right now but in addition to
00:33 - producing videos for YouTube I've also
00:35 - been updating the videos in my paid
00:37 - courses and come to think about it I've
00:40 - been doing that since 2013 because Apple
00:42 - just changes things all the time so if
00:45 - you had bought the course from me in
00:47 - 2013 to this date you'd still have an
00:50 - up-to-date learning resource and I think
00:52 - that's pretty cool now some quickfire
00:54 - progress updates since the last February
00:57 - update video I have started the process
01:00 - to organize all of my content into an
01:02 - index so that newcomers can come and
01:05 - they know where to start and where to
01:06 - progress but it is a process because I'm
01:09 - literally taking an inventory of all of
01:11 - the videos and content and articles that
01:14 - I've produced and seeing what's up to
01:16 - date and where things should go so it is
01:20 - a it's quite laborious but it's
01:22 - happening another thing I talked about
01:24 - last month was monthly challenges to get
01:27 - you guys going to get your feet wet just
01:30 - to give you a reason or a goal for you
01:33 - to take action and for me personally I
01:35 - know that's kind of the kick in the butt
01:37 - that I need to get things done so the
01:39 - first monthly challenge is going to
01:41 - start in April because in March I'm
01:43 - actually getting going to be away for a
01:45 - little bit so we'll start in April but
01:47 - my idea is that in the month of April
01:50 - the challenge is to build and ship an
01:53 - app into the App Store now I know a
01:55 - month isn't a lot of time to build a
01:58 - very meaningful app but it's gonna force
02:01 - me and you if you partake in the
02:03 - challenge to take imperfect action right
02:06 - to just get something out the door
02:08 - that's usable but maybe it's not your
02:11 - ideal dream
02:13 - perfect app but just to get it out the
02:15 - door and stop procrastinating or
02:17 - analyzing or planning you know I know I
02:21 - get stuck in that rut a lot so hopefully
02:24 - this challenge is going to force us to
02:26 - kind of break that habit and just to get
02:29 - into a new habit of building and
02:31 - shipping and taking an iterative
02:34 - approach to building an awesome app now
02:37 - for beginners who aren't ready to build
02:39 - their own app yet they can always do my
02:42 - 28 day app challenge to kind of get up
02:46 - to speed so that when we run this
02:48 - monthly challenge in May again they'll
02:51 - be ready to build their own app and ship
02:53 - it into the App Store so that's pretty
02:55 - much what's happened so far in February
02:58 - we're going to continue to lay down the
03:01 - groundwork that I talked about we're
03:02 - going to start building those complex
03:04 - apps I also have some one-day build
03:06 - ideas for people to progress to after
03:09 - the foundation and beginner stuff so
03:12 - there's a lot going on and I also really
03:15 - look forward to the challenge in April
03:17 - because it's the first time I'll have
03:18 - done something like that all right
03:20 - thanks for watching I love you guys I'll
03:22 - see you guys next time
