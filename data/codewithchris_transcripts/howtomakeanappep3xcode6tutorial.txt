00:01 - [Music]
00:05 - hello this is Chris and welcome to
00:07 - lesson three of how to make iPhone apps
00:09 - with no programming experience so in
00:12 - this lesson we're going to walk through
00:14 - do a little tutorial of xcode the
00:17 - program which you will be spending a lot
00:19 - of time in to build apps we're going
00:21 - through xcode 6 which is the latest
00:24 - version and every year or two apple
00:26 - rolls out a new version but not uh the
00:28 - changes there are changes between the
00:30 - different versions but it's not so
00:32 - drastic that you'll have to learn
00:34 - everything a new it's kind of like uh
00:36 - how Adobe rolls out new versions of
00:38 - Photoshop and each iteration has new
00:41 - features and stuff like that but at the
00:43 - core the core product is still there and
00:46 - you know if you know how to use one
00:47 - version you'll be pretty well versed in
00:49 - the next version so in this video we're
00:52 - going to go through the major sections
00:54 - of the xcode interface that you'll be
00:56 - using the most and so that will set you
00:58 - up kind of for that core functionality
01:01 - that you can leverage for any version of
01:04 - xcode we're going to start by creating a
01:07 - new xcode
01:08 - project and I'm not going to touch in
01:11 - too much detail all of the different
01:13 - project types or settings uh in this
01:16 - video in the next one we will actually
01:18 - create a new project and we'll go
01:19 - through the settings but for this one I
01:21 - just kind of want to whip up a new
01:23 - project I picked single View application
01:26 - there I'm just going
01:28 - to because the main point is I want to
01:31 - get to the interface so I can show you
01:32 - guys the different sections of the
01:36 - program this is your project properties
01:39 - but we'll go into that in the next video
01:41 - so the first thing you'll notice on the
01:42 - left hand side you can see that it's
01:44 - split up into kind of three distinct
01:47 - sections so you have this left pane over
01:49 - here you have this big middle
01:53 - section then you have another column on
01:56 - the right hand side and then you have
01:58 - this gray strip across the top with some
02:00 - buttons and a status let's go over the
02:03 - left hand side first because this is
02:06 - where your project file Navigator is
02:08 - when you create a new app project it
02:10 - consists of a whole bunch of folders and
02:12 - files and so this is where you can uh
02:15 - look at the various files of your
02:17 - project not only that though this paint
02:20 - actually has a couple of different tabs
02:22 - which you won't need to know right
02:25 - now by far on this side of the screen
02:28 - you'll be looking at your file
02:31 - Navigator when you click on a file let's
02:34 - say this viewcontroller.swift
02:38 - the middle section changes and this is
02:41 - the code editor section actually
02:43 - depending on what kind of file you
02:45 - select if it's a code file you're going
02:47 - to see your lines of code here and
02:49 - you're going to be able to write your
02:51 - code and edit your code
02:53 - here if you're selecting
02:57 - however one of these interface files
03:00 - this area changes into interface Builder
03:03 - and you're going to be working visually
03:06 - to build your
03:08 - interface okay so what about this right
03:11 - hand side over here so let's go back to
03:14 - a code file view controller. Swift and
03:17 - you can see here on the rightmost
03:20 - pane there's a couple of tabs as well
03:24 - and this is called the inspector pane so
03:27 - here it gives you details about the file
03:29 - that you have highlighted or the file
03:31 - that you're currently looking at the
03:32 - inspector pane is actually split into
03:35 - two different panes one taking up
03:37 - probably
03:38 - 75% at the top this is the inspector Pan
03:41 - the bottom is called the library pan and
03:45 - again this has a couple of tabs so just
03:48 - going back to the storyboard
03:51 - file you can see that on the library
03:54 - pane down here it shows me a bunch of
03:56 - different elements that I can add add to
04:00 - my interface so you'll see in the in the
04:03 - next video when we're building our
04:04 - interface we're literally dragging and
04:05 - dropping elements from there and if we
04:08 - select an element so let's do let's do a
04:12 - quick I'll show you you're going to drag
04:15 - a button on here and then when you tap
04:17 - on this and you look on the right hand
04:20 - side here you flip to the appropriate
04:22 - tab the attributes tab you're going to
04:26 - be looking at all the attributes for
04:27 - your button so that's what this right
04:31 - hand pane is useful for as well when
04:34 - you're in a code file so let's go back
04:37 - to viewcontroller.swift there's actually
04:40 - a hidden section down here let's see if
04:43 - we can just bring it up we'll go to view
04:47 - debug area show debug area and that's
04:51 - essentially what this part is called
04:52 - It's called The debug area which we will
04:54 - get to uh later on when we actually
04:57 - start building our app and this is the
04:59 - area where we'll be able to inspect our
05:01 - code we'll be able to see any errors
05:03 - error messages and we'll be able to keep
05:06 - track of uh different variables and
05:08 - stuff like that it's basically an area
05:09 - that's going to be very helpful for us
05:11 - when we start uh writing code and we
05:13 - start troubleshooting our code and
05:16 - things like
05:17 - that and then at the very top here this
05:21 - gray strip the most prominent thing
05:23 - you'll see is this play button well this
05:25 - play button will actually run your
05:27 - project in the simulator so I'm going to
05:28 - go ahead and just
05:30 - tap that so you can see what happens and
05:33 - now you can see the stop button is also
05:35 - highlighted so that will stop your
05:38 - project from running and return you back
05:40 - to the project for
05:43 - editing so there's my simulator that
05:45 - pops up and I've I alluded to this in
05:50 - the um first video and this similar
05:54 - basically mimics an iPhone so you don't
05:57 - actually need a device to test your app
05:59 - in
06:00 - uh as soon as you click run your project
06:02 - in xcode it launches the simulator and
06:04 - it allows you to test your
06:06 - app so we'll get more into that in the
06:09 - future to stop your project you just
06:11 - have to go here and click the stop
06:13 - button there's a drop down here that
06:15 - lets you select what kind of simulator
06:17 - you want to run your project in so you
06:19 - can try out your app on different
06:22 - devices and there's also iOS device and
06:25 - this is used for when you actually have
06:28 - a device to test on and you have an
06:30 - apple membership Apple developer
06:32 - membership to deploy your app on the
06:34 - phone and then you'll be able to select
06:37 - this option to do so on this status bar
06:40 - here it tells you if there are any
06:43 - errors with your project if you run it
06:46 - uh among other things and on the right
06:49 - hand corner right here there's some
06:52 - buttons just for some different views so
06:54 - you can toggle you know if you need more
06:56 - space you can
06:58 - toggle the different areas like this so
07:01 - at its core that's pretty much what
07:03 - xcode is split into right here the file
07:08 - Navigator in the middle you have your
07:09 - code editor
07:11 - area and in your in the right hand side
07:14 - you have the inspector pane or inspector
07:16 - area on the bottom here you have the
07:18 - debug area and at the top here you have
07:21 - your status bar and that's kind of
07:24 - remained the core of xcode for the last
07:26 - few
07:28 - iterations so don't don't worry if it
07:30 - looks confusing to you just like with
07:32 - any other program or app the more you
07:34 - use it the more comfortable you'll feel
07:36 - in it and when we start building our
07:39 - apps and and developing apps we'll be
07:41 - using all of these sections and then
07:43 - you'll really get familiar with all of
07:46 - this stuff now there are some finer
07:48 - nuances and shortcuts and stuff like
07:50 - that that you can do with xcode but I'm
07:52 - going to save those for another video
07:53 - later on when it's relevant and I don't
07:55 - want to overload you guys for now that
07:58 - does it for your tour of code in the
08:00 - next lesson we're actually going to
08:03 - explain a little more about the
08:04 - different files in the app project and
08:07 - we're going to build and run our first
08:09 - project
