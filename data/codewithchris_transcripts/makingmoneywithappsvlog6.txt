00:00 - hello and welcome back it's Chris here so 
since the last Vlog we have completed our  
00:04 - first development Sprint we've started the second 
one I've redesigned the way that the app looks  
00:09 - and I know that ordering is a little bit sketch 
but I've learned so much along the way I want to  
00:15 - share all those Lessons Learned with you in this 
Vlog but before I do that in case you're new here  
00:20 - this is a raw and unscripted video format where 
I share our team's journey in making money with  
00:26 - apps this Vlog entry is dated January 25th 2024 
so with that being said I hope you enjoy today's  
00:32 - Vlog all right since the last video update we've 
finished our first development Sprint that was  
00:38 - here Sprint Acorn I'll talk about that in just 
a second but just to take a couple steps back in  
00:43 - case you're brand new here because we're into Vlog 
six now the original idea was a moot Tracker app  
00:49 - that I sketched out in my notebook and then 
we designed it into a flow that looked like  
00:54 - this and then we decided to take the first very 
simple core user flow which is to make a entry  
01:03 - and to look at your logged entries and look at 
a calendar view and turn that into a series of  
01:09 - tasks to complete then we estimated each of the 
tasks in terms of something called story points  
01:15 - which is a rating of how complex it is and an 
approximation of how long it would take after  
01:21 - breaking down the tasks and estimating them we 
decided to work in two we Sprints now for the  
01:25 - first Sprint we only actually had about a week 
and a half because of other priorities and we had  
01:30 - two developers on this project which are inaki 
and joash so we assigned the tasks to them in  
01:37 - this first Sprint at the end of the two weeks or 
week and a half we had a demo of what they were  
01:43 - working on and then we had a retrospective where 
we talked about what went well and what we could  
01:48 - improve on and then we had something called the 
backlog grooming step which is to take a look at  
01:54 - the status of the project what's been done what's 
not been done and reorganize things for the next  
01:59 - Sprint which is this one Sprint Pak laava so 
first of all let's talk about what went well  
02:04 - and what didn't so what went well was um they 
were really excited to work on a new project  
02:10 - because it's been a while since we have built our 
own stuff and so they're really excited to do that  
02:16 - um but let me touch on some of the things where 
we could improve on one was uh misestimation of  
02:23 - the story points so what we wanted to get done in 
the first Sprint it ended up being two months in  
02:30 - reality to do so I would say we got done maybe 
half of what we had set out to do in the first  
02:36 - Sprint so we had really underestimated the amount 
of time and effort it would take to do the tasks  
02:45 - there were also unforeseen dependencies because 
you have two people working with each other one  
02:51 - person might get stuck on their task because 
they're relying on a piece that someone else  
02:58 - is doing so joash says the same thing here didn't 
anticipate for some other uh dependencies and the  
03:05 - UI so they were working off of this UI here that 
we had designed now the problem is that me as the  
03:13 - project owner I didn't feel like this design 
was final but yet I got the guys to start on  
03:17 - this anyways so that is a bit of a problem because 
they're building off of something that may change  
03:24 - and so that would that become very apparent as 
a huge detriment after this first Sprint because  
03:32 - they weren't able to build finalized UI and when 
I was looking at the demos there were also things  
03:40 - that there were assumptions that were made that 
weren't very clear for example let me just put  
03:44 - this into concrete terms here let me see if I can 
find okay so for example this screen right here  
03:55 - where you're supposed to be able to scroll through 
your moods for that day now it's not clear looking  
04:01 - at this timeline this little strip on this side 
where are you supposed to see timestamps right so  
04:09 - when inaki was building this to him he interpreted 
this design as okay you see the starting time like  
04:15 - the time stamp of the first entry and the time 
stamp of the last entry and so he was trying  
04:21 - to build that and he was running into difficulty 
because he was implementing this as a list and he  
04:26 - needed to make sure the lines connected and all of 
that but when I look at this design I interpreted  
04:32 - this as you thinking about what would be useful 
for a user I would think there's a time stamp  
04:37 - beside every entry and then the lines just connect 
all the timestamps together so that is what became  
04:45 - apparent this sort of miscommunication where this 
isn't spelled out that sort of stuff and this  
04:52 - was so easy to overlook when you're looking at a 
design you're like oh yeah this looks good I see  
04:56 - that there's a line here but it's not until you 
actually try to build it out that these questions  
05:02 - come to mind and uh one thing I think we could do 
better is to make sure that every aspect of the  
05:11 - user interface is thought out and all the wha ifs 
are answered before we start development so that's  
05:18 - something that I'm definitely um taking into the 
next Sprint so in this next Sprint we had most of  
05:26 - the tasks to be honest from the first Sprint were 
not done so they were moved into the second Sprint  
05:31 - here so they were continuing to work on like the 
mood entry and the scrollable calendar things like  
05:37 - that but while they were working on that I decided 
that I really needed to finalize this design so  
05:43 - that inyi and joash could work off of something 
uh more final and that things weren't up in the  
05:50 - air so I did this exercise which actually worked 
out really well so I think in my head I couldn't  
05:58 - put my finger on why I wasn't happy with design 
because I don't think it was how I imagined the  
06:04 - app so it needed to come from me to drive that 
direction and I was imagining a mood tracker being  
06:12 - very calm I wanted also the theme to be simple 
so with the focus on that I took an image that  
06:19 - I found calm and soothing which is this one and I 
took the colors from it and I decided to use that  
06:26 - as a starting point for my design and I'm not a 
professional designer I I wanted to put something  
06:32 - down to give direction to JC who is our designer 
to really put the finishing touches and the  
06:39 - details together but I wanted to start him off to 
give him a sense of where my head was at so this  
06:46 - is what I I started creating and I want to take 
you through the process of how I arrived uh closer  
06:53 - and closer to a final design so this was what I 
did first I started with this screen and I wanted  
06:58 - to make it very simple instead of overwhelming the 
user with options I wanted to just ask a simple  
07:04 - question are you leaning more towards the bad side 
or the good side and after you make a selection uh  
07:10 - for bad and good then we begin to drill down and 
ask more questions but if you don't want to you  
07:16 - can just hit save and then you just feel good or 
bad because sometimes you're not in the mood to  
07:22 - enter more details but if you are then you can so 
I imagine there to be a library of preset let's  
07:30 - say you selected good so preset of good emotions 
here or moods You' be able to type in a custom one  
07:37 - these are your recent ones and these are pinned 
ones if you use often and this is a scrollable  
07:43 - section right here and then I imagined when you 
selected something it would come down here into  
07:49 - this little area and then we would ask additional 
questions like we obviously these options don't  
07:56 - make sense for WEA but I I just just wanted 
to give the gist of it rather than designing  
08:02 - it for real so then the next question is are are 
you with anyone what activity were you doing and  
08:07 - things like that because the more detail that you 
log now in the future when you look back on it and  
08:12 - you're trying to analyze how you feel and and what 
sorts of triggers you have and all that stuff the  
08:17 - more data you have the better uh so that was my 
first attempt at at that uh the second attempt I I  
08:26 - thought of instead of like I I wanted to indicate 
where you were along that path of logging a full  
08:35 - um emotion or full entry so I decided to use these 
icons to represent the different questions but as  
08:41 - I was doing it as I got to this step I scrapped 
this idea because to me looking at this it it  
08:48 - didn't fit the ethos of being simple like when I 
look at this it actually makes me anxious that I  
08:54 - have to answer so many different questions but 
what this does do well is it allows you to jump  
08:59 - back let's say you're at this point and you want 
to change an answer from a previous screen you  
09:06 - can tap on something to jump back to that section 
so that was my second iteration but I didn't like  
09:11 - how cluttered and how overwhelming it looked and 
decided then to start working on how the entry  
09:18 - screen might work and I wanted to carry through 
that cozy and calm feeling so uh it really helped  
09:27 - to have a color palette and and I would these 
colors I I picked out from this photo right here  
09:35 - so I really used all of these colors except green 
I couldn't find a good place to use green until I  
09:40 - got here and I decided I actually needed a couple 
of other colors as well so I wanted to weave your  
09:46 - entry into a sentence so it looked like this so 
from there at that point on I knew I was onto an  
09:54 - idea so I decided to formalize it a little bit by 
charting out the main screens and the logging flow  
10:03 - uh the on this great box is the onboarding which 
I haven't done yet and the other thing I thought  
10:09 - through was how these screens get presented so 
I wrote here that this is an initial screen uh  
10:17 - when the app is launched this is the first screen 
they see because let's say you are in the mood to  
10:24 - log in motion right you launch the app that's what 
you probably typically want to do is like you're  
10:30 - launching the app to log in EM motion so I wanted 
to pop this up first as the initial screen if it's  
10:35 - the very first time you're ever launching the app 
which is show an onboarding sequence that tells  
10:39 - you a little bit about the app first but aside 
from that subsequent uh launches would show this  
10:45 - screen on app launch and I wanted this to be a a 
sheet a popover sheet so that it can be dismissed  
10:53 - by the user dragging down on it and if you select 
mood and you go forward with logging and entry  
11:02 - then you go into this logging flow which I showed 
you a little bit about and you can cancel out of  
11:07 - it at any time and you can hit uh confirm at any 
time so I made sure to add a lot of notes as I  
11:15 - was designing this because I wanted to capture 
all of my thoughts as well on what happens when  
11:23 - a certain button is tapped and uh what screen 
should it go to so for example when you tap on  
11:29 - this x button at this point in time you've already 
made a selection which is you've selected bad or  
11:35 - good so you've started an entry right in that case 
we shouldn't just discard it when you hit X I want  
11:41 - to show a dialogue that says discard or continue 
and then same thing here you see a check mark to  
11:48 - save if you don't want to continue answering all 
these different questions you can hit this to save  
11:54 - at any time and go back to the entries screen at 
this point when you hit X they haven't actually  
12:02 - made any data entry there's no data entry here so 
if you hit X we don't need to show a confirmation  
12:08 - dialogue we just dismiss it and there's no save 
button here because they haven't actually made any  
12:13 - selections yet so in both of those cases whether 
they dismiss this popup or they save the entry  
12:22 - they will come down here and I decided to organize 
it by day because I realized that I need to show  
12:30 - that a certain day has no entries and I realized 
this when I thought about the calendar view so  
12:37 - this is the calendar view it shows the calendar 
view as a full screen sheet so again it slides  
12:44 - up and it looks like this and if there's a circle 
over it that means there are entries for that day  
12:52 - and this little dot represents the current day I 
modeled this calendar off of the Calendar app in  
12:59 - iOS so what happens when you select a certain day 
it goes to the entry screen scrolled to that date  
13:08 - so that's why let's say you hit 11 of January and 
it it would go here and it would show you 11th of  
13:16 - January with no entries if I didn't show these 
dates with this no entry label then where would  
13:21 - you scroll to it wouldn't really make sense and 
other things that are really helpful to add these  
13:28 - little comments are like a to-do things that I 
haven't thought through yet so for example how  
13:34 - do you edit or delete an entry and so I just left 
a little note there for myself and something I  
13:41 - thought about for v2 was to add a filter button if 
you tap on this button we should be able to filter  
13:46 - show me all of the entries where I felt good 
show me all of the entries where I felt happy  
13:51 - or whatever and that would allow you to do that 
I thought through this scrolling mechanism will  
13:59 - allow you to scroll through different days but you 
would soon get lost so this button allows you to  
14:05 - go back to the current day and this white button 
here brings up the new mood entry screen like it  
14:13 - would slide up this screen right here and allow 
you to log in motion that's what that button does  
14:20 - and this would lead you to a profile screen as a 
sheet as well so I haven't designed this either  
14:28 - but as you can see the entries this is the main 
view but the profile is a slide up full screen  
14:37 - sheet the new entry is a slide up full screen 
sheet and the calendar is as well so I think it's  
14:44 - much simpler especially this screen with the entry 
and it's only if you select one of these options  
14:52 - where you go into a deeper logging flow and at 
any time you can exit and start stop answering  
15:00 - questions by hitting this save button now there 
are certain interactions that I've identified  
15:06 - here that I haven't really thought through yet 
for example how do you edit a custom emotion or  
15:13 - mood that you've added let's say you made a typo 
because I imagine when you hit when you tap on  
15:17 - this to add a custom mood that the keyboard would 
pop up and you'd type it directly into here and  
15:23 - then if you hit enter it would turn into a bubble 
here that you can select so how would you edit  
15:28 - that or delete one of the ones that you added 
yourself would it be a tap and hold interaction  
15:34 - but if it is a tap and hold interaction how would 
that be discoverable because it's really hard to  
15:39 - see that you would be able to tap and hold this 
to bring up some options so you have to think  
15:44 - about that discoverability aside from just maybe 
literally putting a label here that says you can  
15:51 - tap and hold these little bubbles you could do 
that but ideally you would make make it more of a  
15:59 - discoverability thing now the other question that 
I got asked when I showed this to nyaki and joash  
16:05 - and it's a really good observation is that when 
you tap on one of these does it go to the next  
16:10 - screen automatically or does it just select it and 
it was show a selected State and then you'd have  
16:16 - to tap on some sort of button to go to the next 
screen another thing that was brought up was that  
16:22 - if you are in on the next screen how would you go 
backwards to let's say change your answer so those  
16:30 - are things that I still need to think about and we 
still need to solve the reason why this x button  
16:37 - there's like overlap here is because this x button 
was added after the fact when we were in a meeting  
16:43 - so I haven't gotten a chance to adjust that but 
it's a work in progress but I'm a lot happier with  
16:49 - the general direction of this versus this where I 
gave this to our designer and I literally gave JC  
16:59 - this like these images these Doodles right here 
and he came up with this so I realized that it's  
17:06 - a even for you if you have an app idea and you 
are going to send it off to a designer people  
17:13 - can't read your mind now you probably have 
some sort of idea of how you want it to look  
17:18 - like the colors like even some sort of ethos like 
Simplicity is the one that I decided to use here  
17:28 - right even something like that would be something 
to go on for a designer so I think JC would be  
17:36 - able to take this and develop it further because 
I think there's enough indication of the direction  
17:43 - I want to go in and furthermore I don't want this 
direction to just be for this app because if you  
17:51 - go back to Vlog number one you'll know that this 
is going to be a series of health and wellness  
17:56 - and productivity type apps I really want to carry 
this theme um across all of the family of apps so  
18:04 - that they're cohesive and the other thing is that 
I know this color scheme isn't for everyone I find  
18:10 - the soothing everyone's different I do plan 
to allow theme like color theme changes and  
18:18 - that's something that I I put on the backlog and 
I think it would be a nice thing to have as well  
18:23 - now all of this stuff that I'm talking about here 
this new design Direction I did this while Sprint  
18:30 - Bak laava was underway so joash and and Yaki are 
not working off of this new design yet so at the  
18:37 - end of Sprint baklava we have to reestimate some 
of the things based on this new design and then  
18:44 - we are going to plan Sprint number three and then 
we'll be working off the new design so I want to  
18:50 - say that going through this process so far working 
with other people has been really eye openening  
18:56 - actually some of the things that have come up for 
example making sure like how do you communicate  
19:01 - what's in your head to someone else making sure 
that you have things finalized and well thought  
19:07 - out before you hand it off and then also like how 
do you properly estimate things all of those have  
19:15 - come up as Road bumps in the journey so lots of 
learnings I'm really glad that I'm going through  
19:21 - this process and I hope that um you're having 
some takeaways as well just by following along
