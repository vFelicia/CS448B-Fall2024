00:02 - hey coders happy Monday Chris here first
00:04 - of all I want to thank you guys for all
00:06 - of your well wishes and heartfelt
00:09 - comments in response to the quick video
00:11 - that I posted on Friday it was really
00:13 - heartwarming for my family and I to read
00:15 - all of your comments and warm wishes and
00:17 - I'm happy to say that my wife is doing a
00:19 - lot better she started taking
00:20 - antibiotics and she's getting over her
00:22 - flu so over the weekend I was trying to
00:24 - figure out what to cover next and from
00:28 - that video where I asked you guys for
00:29 - feed back about 30% of you guys wanted
00:32 - to see some Sprite kit stuff and
00:33 - building simple games I'm not quite
00:35 - ready to do that yet because I consider
00:37 - myself to be a Sprite kit beginner but I
00:40 - am very interested in building games and
00:42 - creating games that's what got me into
00:44 - programming in the first place so I will
00:46 - do that for you guys at some point in
00:48 - the near future uh but for now the other
00:51 - thing that you guys requested is to look
00:53 - at pars and build Swift apps with pars
00:55 - so for today and the next few videos I
00:58 - want to cover what parse is and how to
01:01 - work with it and tutorials to save data
01:04 - save images save sounds and stuff like
01:07 - that we're not specifically going to
01:09 - build an app at least not immediately uh
01:11 - I'm going to try and cover different
01:12 - features of parse and how to use it and
01:14 - then in the future we will be well
01:16 - equipped to use parse in our apps so we
01:19 - can build some more complex apps that
01:21 - save and retrieve data and for those of
01:23 - you guys who aren't familiar with what
01:25 - it is it's basically a backend service
01:28 - where you can store your data and your
01:29 - media and it exposes an API for you to
01:32 - retrieve that stuff back now the nice
01:34 - thing about it is that you're basically
01:36 - getting database functionality without
01:38 - having to maintain your own servers and
01:40 - set up your own databases and stuff like
01:42 - that and it also scales with you as you
01:44 - grow so you don't have to manage all of
01:47 - that uh manage redundancy scalability
01:50 - and all that stuff so parse is free for
01:53 - the most part um unless your app gets
01:55 - really really popular and you need a lot
01:57 - of requests per second and you need a
02:00 - lot of seor space uh then you're going
02:02 - to have to start paying for it but it's
02:04 - really nice because for the most part
02:06 - when you're testing out ideas and you're
02:07 - building apps and you're not sure if
02:09 - it's going to work out uh you're getting
02:11 - a lot of functionality for free
02:13 - essentially and if you need to scale and
02:16 - you need to start paying for parse well
02:17 - that probably implies that you are
02:19 - making money or you're going to be
02:21 - making a lot of money because the parse
02:23 - free tier is so generous so before we
02:26 - get into that um there's a couple of
02:28 - other features of parse I just want to
02:30 - go through if you're unfamiliar with it
02:32 - so it just goes through trying to sell
02:35 - its service and stuff like that but I
02:37 - wanted to tell you about what it can do
02:40 - aside from storing all of the media and
02:43 - data it can also do push push
02:46 - notifications uh and that you get a
02:48 - million push notifications for free as
02:50 - well I think that's per month or
02:51 - something like that and now it has a new
02:53 - thing that's analytics and that's free
02:56 - as well so you get all of that stuff for
02:58 - free and I forgot to mention that it's
03:00 - also crossplatform because all of your
03:03 - data and your media is stored on their
03:05 - servers and it exposes an API for you to
03:07 - retrieve that stuff uh it doesn't matter
03:10 - what your client is it could be an IOS
03:11 - app it could be an Android app it could
03:13 - be a desktop app it could be uh website
03:16 - and all of those platforms can hit the
03:19 - parse backend to retrieve that data in
03:21 - that media so you kind of have one
03:23 - backend system and you have all of these
03:25 - different clients or devices connecting
03:28 - to it and the last thing I want to
03:29 - mention is if we go into the
03:32 - customers there are actually a bunch of
03:35 - there are actually a lot of big Brands
03:37 - using pars so it's not something that
03:40 - was just set up yesterday or it's not
03:42 - you know some little startup it's
03:44 - actually a pretty popular service now so
03:47 - what I want you to do for this lesson is
03:48 - just sign up for a new account so you go
03:51 - to the sign up link right here uh you
03:54 - can you know just fill in this stuff and
03:56 - what you should get to is a dash board
04:01 - like this I haven't used it in a while
04:04 - so I guess they've changed the dashboard
04:07 - and let's try the new let's try the new
04:10 - dashboard so this is what you should get
04:13 - once you sign up as you can see I have
04:15 - been using pars for a while now and I
04:17 - can tell you it's really easy to use and
04:19 - it's great so over the next few videos
04:21 - I'll show you guys how to integrate
04:22 - parse into your xcode project and then
04:25 - how to start saving and retrieving data
04:27 - all right so thanks again for watching
04:28 - and thank you for your continue to
04:30 - support and I'll see you guys tomorrow
04:32 - bye
04:36 - [Music]
