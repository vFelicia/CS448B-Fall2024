00:00 - hey code crew this was a talk that I did
00:02 - at the Swift teal conference last week
00:05 - and just to give you a little bit of
00:07 - context to this talk at the audience the
00:10 - attendees to this conference were Swift
00:12 - developers and Swift enthusiasts mostly
00:15 - Swift developers and so my talk is about
00:17 - inspiring them to share their knowledge
00:20 - and I did this through my own journey
00:22 - and how I went from a swift and
00:25 - objective-c developer to doing what I do
00:27 - now so it was really fun and exciting
00:30 - and I was pretty nervous because I
00:32 - hadn't done any public speaking in a
00:34 - very long time in any case I hope you
00:36 - enjoy it
00:40 - [Music]
00:52 - a little testing testing hello yeah okay
01:03 - man when I wrote that I didn't think she
01:05 - was gonna read it out and use it as my
01:06 - intro so it's a little bit embarrassing
01:10 - but hey everyone my name is Chris Chang
01:13 - and for the last six years I've been
01:15 - teaching non coders how to code in Swift
01:17 - and I do this through my YouTube channel
01:19 - and my website code with Chris calm but
01:22 - the thing is I never dreamed of becoming
01:24 - a youtuber I was actually an objective-c
01:26 - developer before and through a series of
01:28 - weird twists and turns and unexpected
01:30 - decisions I found a passion for teaching
01:33 - and well here I am today and I didn't
01:35 - think I'd be doing this six years later
01:38 - but the point of this talk today is not
01:41 - to inspire you guys to also become
01:43 - youtubers instead I want to inspire you
01:45 - guys with my story to keep your door
01:48 - open for the unexpected and wonderful
01:51 - things that can happen by doing the four
01:54 - things that I'm going to show you how to
01:55 - do today now before this turns into some
01:59 - weird motivational speech I assure you
02:01 - it's not it's not gonna be fluffy like
02:03 - that I have some concrete examples that
02:06 - I'm gonna share with you all these
02:08 - people here have had life-changing
02:10 - things happen to themselves and when I
02:13 - look back at my own journey and their
02:14 - journeys I realized that there were four
02:17 - things that I identified that we all did
02:19 - in common and that's really what I want
02:22 - to share with you today and I'm gonna do
02:24 - that in the context of my own journey so
02:26 - number one is I got involved with the
02:30 - developer community now why is this
02:32 - significant for me it was very
02:34 - significant because that was how I got
02:36 - exposed to Iowa's development and had it
02:39 - not been for this I don't think I would
02:40 - have so let me explain when I graduated
02:43 - at my first job I worked with Microsoft
02:45 - Silverlight and I see we have some
02:48 - civilized developers here and it was a
02:52 - lot of fun at that point it was a brand
02:54 - new technology to enable rich user
02:56 - experiences on the web as new not many
02:59 - people working with it was visual is fun
03:01 - for me but it was a pretty tight-knit
03:04 - community because there it wasn't that
03:06 - widespread and as a result I got
03:08 - involved with the Toronto Silverlight
03:10 - user group and this user group was
03:12 - started by two founders from Mississauga
03:14 - who had a consulting company so I helped
03:17 - them organize events monthly and I would
03:19 - sometimes speak at these events or I
03:21 - would attend them but the bottom line is
03:23 - that I got to know these organizers
03:25 - really well and at the time I didn't
03:27 - know it but eventually they would become
03:29 - my bosses because you see I left my
03:31 - first job tried to start my own business
03:33 - failed tried to start another one
03:35 - failed and then eventually started
03:37 - freelancing for these two guys and then
03:39 - I joined their consulting company as
03:41 - maybe the twelfth employee or something
03:43 - like that but it was at this second
03:45 - company that I got involved with Windows
03:47 - Phone development so you see a trend
03:49 - here everything I work on just kind of
03:51 - like dies so that's not the case
03:52 - received but um Windows Phone
03:55 - development so being good at that led me
03:58 - to become that company's first
04:00 - objective-c developer and being the
04:02 - first objective-c developer and only one
04:04 - at that company was kind of tough for me
04:06 - because I struggled to learn memory
04:07 - management I didn't have a more senior
04:09 - mentor to guide me and I didn't have
04:12 - objective-c team members to bat ideas
04:14 - back and forth with so every obstacle
04:17 - that I overcame every hurdle that I
04:19 - solved it was really hard one but at the
04:21 - same time it was really satisfying I'm
04:23 - sure as you guys being developers you
04:25 - know how it feels like to solve a really
04:26 - tough problem and I think this slide
04:28 - really epitomizes that feeling right yes
04:31 - finally got it so when our CTO said you
04:34 - should share our knowledge I was totally
04:37 - on board with that you know spending
04:39 - time so much time trying to figure these
04:40 - things out I thought I could really help
04:44 - other people in case other people were
04:46 - facing the same problems and save them a
04:47 - ton of time so that brings me to my
04:49 - second point which is sharing your
04:51 - knowledge to me for me that took the
04:54 - form of a wordpress blog so I just
04:57 - whipped something up I started
04:58 - documenting my day-to-day learnings and
05:00 - the things I was figuring out with no
05:03 - expectations of who would read it and
05:04 - trying to build an audience or anything
05:06 - like that but I thought if I could just
05:09 - help someone you know in the odd case
05:13 - that they were trying to figure out the
05:14 - same problem that I was I would save
05:18 - them a ton of time
05:20 - and I continued to do this I continue to
05:22 - document my learnings and over time I
05:25 - start to realize I had a pretty
05:26 - in-demand skill set because up till that
05:28 - point I would tell my friends and family
05:31 - that I did da net I did C sharp I did
05:35 - Windows Phone what's that right and then
05:37 - now when I was doing this I told people
05:39 - I I built I phone apps and instantly
05:41 - they got it but then the next question
05:44 - was I have an app idea all right so it
05:49 - seemed like back then at least in 2013
05:51 - everyone had their own app idea and
05:52 - everyone thought I'd be the next big
05:54 - thing it'd be the next million dollar
05:56 - billion dollar app idea and so I thought
05:58 - hey it'd be kind of cool to try to teach
06:01 - people how to build their own apps
06:03 - because everyone seems to want to but I
06:06 - was really doubtful because you know how
06:09 - can you try to teach a non developer
06:10 - objective-c I mean I was having enough
06:12 - trouble with it so it was a fun
06:15 - challenge for me to see if I could teach
06:18 - someone who's never coded a single line
06:20 - of code before to build their own app
06:23 - using objective-c and so I decided to
06:27 - use the video to do this because I
06:28 - thought for someone who had never coded
06:30 - before being able to see me go through
06:32 - the motions would be very beneficial and
06:34 - choosing video naturally led me to
06:36 - YouTube and so I bought a $30 mic and I
06:39 - started to produce videos now this
06:43 - snapshot kind of documents my six-year
06:46 - journey on YouTube so far but we're
06:48 - gonna get back to this slide the most
06:50 - important thing is that I got started
06:51 - that brings me to my third point I got
06:54 - started now this might seem kind of like
06:56 - a cop-out point but actually getting
06:58 - started is really really tough because
07:00 - there's so many obstacles to stop us
07:03 - from getting started from doing anything
07:05 - and going back to Tim's talked about the
07:08 - MiG bella is actually natural for your
07:10 - brain to stop you from doing unknown
07:12 - risky uncertain things it's like a
07:13 - safety mechanism and so for me I had a
07:16 - lot of obstacles that I had to overcome
07:18 - just to start putting videos on YouTube
07:20 - and so I want to talk about a couple of
07:22 - them some of my biggest ones so number
07:25 - one is I knew my friends and family
07:27 - we're gonna see these videos and so I
07:29 - wanted them to be perfect my first video
07:31 - on YouTube was actually eight and a half
07:33 - minute
07:33 - long but I remember I kept tree
07:35 - recording it it took me days just to get
07:37 - it right and I thought it was perfect at
07:39 - that time but now when I look back on
07:40 - that first video I still cringe so
07:42 - you're just gonna have to believe that
07:44 - you're gonna get better at it over time
07:45 - it's like a skill number two is imposter
07:48 - syndrome and Tim touched on this it's
07:51 - just that feeling when you get up there
07:53 - and you're talking just like I am now
07:54 - what qualifies me to be up here to teach
07:57 - him to talk and whenever this still
08:00 - creeps up on me today and when it does I
08:02 - try to remember that it's like a path
08:03 - it's a journey so there are people ahead
08:05 - of you way ahead of you experts and
08:07 - there are people behind you just getting
08:09 - started and those are the people that
08:12 - you're helping that you're enriching
08:14 - their lives and you're trying to bring
08:15 - them up to where you are and so that's
08:18 - what I try to keep in mind and actually
08:20 - keep a page on my website with all of
08:22 - the heartfelt thanks and comments that I
08:24 - get when I feel like an impostor I read
08:26 - this and it reassures me that I'm doing
08:28 - the right thing and I'm changing
08:30 - people's lives and I'm enriching their
08:32 - lives and I'm I should keep doing what
08:33 - I'm doing another thing that might help
08:36 - you to get started is the thought that
08:39 - you are making the world a more
08:41 - efficient place because think about some
08:43 - of the problems that you're solving at
08:44 - work sometimes they can take days and by
08:47 - you sharing that knowledge to the
08:49 - community you could potentially be
08:51 - saving other developers hours of time
08:53 - and productivity that they could
08:55 - dedicate to something else and thereby
08:57 - you're making the world a better and
08:59 - more efficient place but getting started
09:02 - is one thing the next step is you have
09:04 - to have the right expectations because
09:06 - going back to this graph you can see
09:09 - that it was really long during six years
09:11 - and that is the one year mark and that's
09:13 - when Swift came out and along this way I
09:16 - also had two kids probably that plateau
09:18 - there but I didn't post regularly hey
09:22 - these big red bars represent months at a
09:25 - time where I didn't post at all and then
09:27 - the yellow arrows are time for when I
09:28 - posted like a madman it probably would
09:31 - have been better if I was consistent
09:32 - with it but I was doing it for the right
09:36 - reasons I knew I was helping people I
09:38 - was getting good feedback from people
09:40 - thanking me and stuff like that so
09:42 - that's what kept me going and had I
09:44 - stopped early on or had I had that
09:46 - thought of
09:47 - I'm gonna make X amount of dollars in
09:49 - the first year or have X amount of
09:50 - subscribers in six months or something
09:52 - like that I probably would have put in
09:53 - the first month and then I never would
09:56 - have seen that tail end I speak from
09:58 - experience because at eight months I did
10:01 - quit my job to try to make this my
10:03 - full-time gig and there was a
10:05 - combination of different reasons for me
10:08 - quitting my full-time job but the
10:11 - biggest reason was I discovered the
10:14 - satisfaction and teaching that I never
10:17 - knew existed I couldn't understand why
10:19 - anybody would want to be a teacher but
10:21 - once I started hearing feedback from
10:25 - people and see how people reacted when
10:28 - they ran their first a little bit of
10:29 - code it reminded me when I got exposed
10:32 - to programming at first that wonderment
10:34 - that aw that joy right and to think that
10:38 - I could help other people experience
10:40 - that that really blew my mind and I was
10:43 - like this is way more satisfying than
10:45 - what I was doing at work and so I was
10:48 - like if I could do this full-time that
10:50 - would be my dream job just giving people
10:52 - this feeling changing their lives and
10:54 - storing them on this coding journey like
10:55 - I had when I discovered the only problem
10:59 - was that you too really wasn't paying me
11:00 - anything and so I quit my job and I
11:04 - ended up doing a bunch of freelancing
11:06 - that's a big blue part there I had built
11:08 - up a little bit of an audience so I had
11:10 - some course I made a course and I was
11:12 - selling that that's the green part and
11:14 - YouTube represents that little red
11:16 - sliver but like I said I kept doing what
11:20 - I was doing I kept producing videos and
11:23 - six years later the green parts are my
11:27 - core sales and the red part is my
11:28 - YouTube revenue and I would never have
11:30 - guessed that this would become my life
11:32 - but I love what I'm doing but you see my
11:35 - story isn't unique because this Shawn
11:37 - Allen he started his he started sharing
11:40 - his tech job interview experiences on
11:42 - YouTube and he was getting great
11:43 - feedback and he decided to continue to
11:45 - produce videos it was also a creative
11:47 - outlet for him he got involved with the
11:50 - Swift community on Twitter and now two
11:51 - and a half years later he's made the
11:53 - leap to become a full-time content
11:54 - creator with some freelancing on the
11:56 - side and then there's Mark Morgan's he
12:00 - always loved
12:01 - his knowledge with his coworkers I
12:02 - worked but one day no one was in the
12:05 - office so he decided to record a video
12:07 - put it on YouTube for his co-workers to
12:08 - watch little did he know that it was
12:11 - public and he started getting good
12:13 - feedback on it which motivated him to
12:15 - continue producing videos and now four
12:18 - years later he's built up this little
12:19 - audience that it might possible for him
12:22 - and his wife see traveled the world with
12:24 - no end date and this was a totally
12:27 - unexpected result from him just teaching
12:30 - online and he also had to overcome a
12:32 - huge sense of impostor syndrome and then
12:36 - there's Johnson Nell I don't think this
12:37 - guy needs any introduction but this year
12:40 - he's made the leap to become a full-time
12:41 - content creator he stopped doing his
12:43 - freelancing and there's this tweet that
12:46 - I really love because it really captures
12:47 - the essence of my fourth point now read
12:49 - it to you guys in case anyone can read
12:51 - it every blog podcast and github project
12:54 - started out with an audience of zero if
12:56 - you want to create content or open
12:57 - source do it because you love it and
12:59 - keep working hard even when no one is
13:00 - paying attention just look at my number
13:02 - of readers it's all about time and
13:04 - consistency so that goes back to just
13:07 - doing it for the right reasons
13:08 - so just to recap number one get involved
13:11 - with the community you guys being here
13:12 - you know that's on the right track and
13:15 - don't forget Twitter reddit user groups
13:17 - like I did start sharing your knowledge
13:19 - this doesn't have to be really hard just
13:21 - document your day to day learnings on
13:23 - Twitter or on Instagram give me it as
13:26 - easy as that
13:27 - and then get started the best advice I
13:30 - can give you is to take imperfect action
13:32 - I love that term because that perfectly
13:35 - captures you know it's not going to be
13:37 - perfect at the start and having the
13:42 - right expectations so for me it took six
13:44 - years but I think that had I been more
13:48 - consistent and maybe more focused on it
13:50 - it would have been shorter for a lot of
13:52 - people that I highlighted in this talk
13:53 - it was about two and a half to three
13:55 - years remember John's tweet and then I
13:58 - have a quote from Steve Jobs that really
14:00 - captures the essence of my talk here you
14:03 - can't connect the dots looking forward
14:04 - you can only connect them looking
14:05 - backwards so you have to trust the dots
14:07 - will somehow connect in your future you
14:09 - don't you have to trust in something
14:11 - your gut destiny life karma whatever
14:13 - this approach has never
14:15 - me down and has made all the difference
14:16 - in my life so by you guys getting out
14:20 - into the community putting yourself out
14:21 - there sharing your knowledge you're in
14:24 - essence putting more dots on the map and
14:26 - you just have to have some faith that
14:28 - those thoughts will connect in some
14:29 - weird unexpected life-changing way in
14:32 - the future so I've got some of my
14:35 - contact info there if you want to reach
14:37 - out and chat if you guys were thinking
14:39 - about starting your own journey feel
14:41 - free to reach out and contact the info
14:43 - of some of the other people I mentioned
14:45 - in this talk as well thank you so much
14:47 - you guys have been a great audience
14:52 - thank you so much Chris
14:54 - [Applause]
