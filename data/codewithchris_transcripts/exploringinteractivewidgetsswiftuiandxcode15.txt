00:00 - if you haven't heard widgets on iOS can
00:02 - be interactive now and this is so
00:04 - exciting to me because it presents a new
00:06 - way and a new opportunity for people to
00:08 - use your app now I downloaded the xcode
00:10 - 15 and iOS 17 betas and did some
00:13 - experimentation and this is what I came
00:14 - up with
00:18 - [Music]
00:23 - let me show you how simple it is to add
00:25 - this interactivity to your widget now
00:27 - you might be in one of these two
00:28 - scenarios number one you don't have an
00:31 - app and you don't have a widget and if
00:33 - that's you make sure you watch the end
00:34 - where I will give you some tips and
00:36 - guidance on what to do or you might be
00:37 - part of scenario 2 where you already
00:39 - have an app that has a widget and you
00:42 - just want to add some interactivity to
00:43 - that widget and that's what we're going
00:45 - to cover right now okay so step one
00:47 - first you need to understand what sort
00:49 - of interactivity can you add to your
00:51 - widget in iOS 17. for now the only
00:54 - interactive elements you can add to your
00:56 - iOS widgets are buttons and toggles now
00:58 - step two you need to understand what
01:00 - actually happens when the user Taps on
01:02 - that button or toggle on your widget so
01:04 - when the user Taps on a button or a
01:06 - toggle on your widget an app intent that
01:09 - you've defined gets triggered if you're
01:11 - unfamiliar with this term think of an
01:13 - app intent as a piece of functionality
01:15 - that you code that can be executed
01:17 - outside of your app by System services
01:20 - or other apps for example your app
01:23 - content that does something in your app
01:25 - can be triggered by Siri or perhaps the
01:28 - shortcuts app and now even through
01:30 - buttons and toggles on your widget so
01:33 - step two is to create an app intent that
01:35 - performs the task that you want to
01:37 - trigger when the user Taps on that
01:39 - button or toggle on your widget Now app
01:41 - intents aren't a new thing in ww23 so I
01:45 - won't cover them in this video they were
01:47 - actually introduced back in 2020 as a
01:50 - way for your app to interact with Siri
01:52 - kit I'll include some links in the
01:54 - description to app intent tutorials that
01:56 - you could follow to build one for your
01:57 - own app and finally step 3 add the
02:00 - button or the toggle to your widget UI
02:03 - there are new initializers for the Swift
02:05 - UI button and toggle components that you
02:08 - can use in your widgets UI to invoke an
02:12 - app intent when they are triggered so
02:14 - let's dive into xcode and take a look at
02:15 - how that works so here I've got the
02:17 - widget this is what it looks like so far
02:19 - there is no interactivity with this
02:21 - widget it does show a streak though when
02:23 - I up on it it launches the app and then
02:27 - this is what happens it updates but when
02:30 - I tap on it it just launches the app so
02:32 - let's dive into the UI code for this
02:34 - widget which is here and I'm going to
02:37 - add a button right under the ring and
02:39 - I'll show you how easy it is so there is
02:42 - a new uh button there's a new
02:44 - initializer for the button this one
02:46 - right here where you can pass in an app
02:48 - intent and then also have a label for
02:51 - what the button looks like when the
02:52 - button is tapped it's going to invoke
02:54 - that app intent so I've already coded
02:57 - one up
02:58 - and all it does is it puts it logs one
03:03 - streak to the to the data store
03:06 - which is just app storage
03:08 - so we've got that that's the name of my
03:12 - app intent and as for the label I'm
03:15 - going to show a simple
03:17 - just Plus
03:19 - one
03:20 - so see if that shows up in the preview
03:22 - I'm also going to
03:24 - add some padding
03:30 - and it makes the button just a little
03:31 - bit wider and a little easier to tap on
03:33 - now just to remind you this is xcode 15
03:36 - and iOS 17 in beta so depending on when
03:40 - you're watching this things may have
03:42 - changed and this also may be buggy
03:44 - because it's beta software but I still
03:47 - think it's interesting and worth taking
03:50 - a look at how it works so this is the
03:52 - widget now it has a button when I tap on
03:54 - it you can see that it actually invokes
03:57 - my app intent which
04:00 - um which goes to increase the streak and
04:02 - you can see how the numbers change you
04:04 - can see the numbers kind of flipping up
04:06 - that animation right there
04:08 - animating numerical text is simply with
04:12 - this modifier this content transition
04:15 - passing in numeric text for the streak
04:18 - that's how easy it is to get that effect
04:20 - it's really cool
04:26 - right and that's how it works
04:28 - and just like that you've got an
04:30 - interactive widget beautiful now what
04:32 - about scenario one where you don't have
04:34 - an app and you don't have a widget well
04:36 - for starters flow's masterclass on how
04:40 - to build widgets with Widget kit is a
04:42 - great start and if you want me to create
04:44 - a walkthrough step-by-step video of how
04:46 - I built the streaks app with the
04:48 - interactive widget and having them share
04:50 - the same data comment below with I love
04:52 - widgets alright thanks for watching and
04:55 - stay tuned for more ww23 content alright
04:58 - see you next time
