00:00 - hello and welcome back so Sprint 4 is
00:02 - underway and we're 4 weeks away from
00:04 - submitting our app to the App Store
00:06 - we've laid a lot of the ground workor
00:07 - some of the screens are up and running
00:10 - and I want to show you our progress in
00:11 - this Vlog but before we get there just
00:14 - in case you're brand new to this series
00:16 - this is a raw and unscripted video
00:17 - format where I share our behind
00:20 - the-scenes journey of our team trying to
00:22 - build apps for profit so this Vlog entry
00:25 - is dated March 6th 2024 with that said I
00:28 - hope you enjoy this one hello and
00:30 - welcome back so we just finished Sprint
00:32 - 3 which was mostly about laying out the
00:34 - groundwork so that we could work on the
00:36 - UI and the screens let me play some
00:39 - b-roll in the background so you have
00:40 - something to look at while I talk now
00:41 - there was some UI work done in this
00:43 - Sprint such as the entry screen the
00:45 - calendar and some of the initial mood
00:47 - logging screens and but it was mostly
00:50 - about setting up the data model the
00:52 - relationships between the different
00:54 - entities the queries that we're going to
00:56 - need and then wrapping that all up in a
00:59 - data service so that each of the screens
01:01 - can use that data service to get data
01:04 - and the reason why we were still able to
01:06 - set up some of the UI as you saw earlier
01:10 - was mostly due to the early proof of
01:12 - Concepts that we did before we even
01:14 - started the Sprints so we did some some
01:18 - Discovery work around the calendar and
01:21 - around things like the tags which I
01:24 - think in the design world are actually
01:25 - called chips and these These are those
01:28 - little bubbles where you select the
01:29 - motions they're called chips because we
01:32 - worked on those separately in a
01:35 - different project we were able to then
01:37 - Port that functionality into this
01:39 - project when it came time to actually
01:41 - build the app let me bring you back to
01:43 - the app design for a moment because I
01:44 - want to talk about the fact that there
01:46 - are not that many unique screens right
01:48 - we have the entry screen which we saw is
01:52 - was designed I don't know about the
01:54 - cards I don't think those specifically
01:56 - are built yet but it is a kind of a
01:59 - simple list we have the calendar screen
02:01 - which you saw in the development meeting
02:04 - and we also have this mood logging flow
02:07 - so the first step of the mood logging
02:10 - looks a little different it's kind of a
02:12 - simple screen but subsequently there are
02:14 - about six more steps or five more steps
02:17 - that the user can do to log more detail
02:21 - if they would like but each of those
02:23 - five steps uses the same sort of UI so
02:27 - this can be built once and it can be
02:29 - reused over and over so as you can see
02:32 - there's maybe like three or four unique
02:34 - screens here that we're really talking
02:36 - about so now that we've laid the
02:37 - plumbing for powering the data for these
02:40 - screens it should be relatively simple I
02:43 - know that's really dangerous to say
02:44 - right should be relatively simple to set
02:46 - up the rest of the screens now the other
02:48 - thing I want to talk about was a big
02:50 - decision was that as a team we decided
02:52 - to launch this app or submit it rather
02:55 - submit this app by the end of the month
02:57 - specifically on April 2nd now the real
02:59 - reason for setting that date is because
03:01 - I need the team back for some other work
03:03 - but I realized that in setting a date it
03:05 - creates some urgency and I think will be
03:07 - more productive from it now looking at
03:11 - how much runway we have left which is
03:13 - about 4 weeks we have two sprints to go
03:16 - so Sprint four is underway and then
03:18 - we'll have Sprint five and because of
03:20 - that shortened Runway I asked the team
03:22 - if we could still launch with the same
03:23 - feature set not launch but submit the
03:25 - app by April 2nd can we still submit the
03:28 - app with the same feature set and we
03:30 - identified that we probably need to cut
03:33 - out this profile tab because this hasn't
03:36 - even been defined yet there's no design
03:38 - for it there's no requirements for it so
03:40 - we decided to change the profile tab
03:42 - here into a settings tab that is
03:45 - something that we're going to need
03:46 - anyways which contains links to things
03:48 - like submitting feedback reporting bugs
03:51 - looking at the privacy policy visiting
03:53 - the developer website and things like
03:54 - that so that's one of my action items to
03:56 - Define that screen and what's exactly
03:58 - involved and it'll probably be a simple
04:01 - screen that looks something like this
04:02 - another thing I have to do now that the
04:05 - app submission is imminent is to prepare
04:07 - things like the App Store screenshots
04:10 - the app icon description text this is
04:12 - for the code with Chris app and things
04:15 - like that so that's another task that I
04:17 - have to do all in all I'm really excited
04:19 - to submit this by the end of the month
04:21 - and we will see if we can get there I'm
04:25 - hoping testing and QA will be quick and
04:28 - painless and of course if something big
04:30 - comes up we'll probably have to address
04:31 - it and fix it but seeing as how the uh
04:35 - functionality is not that complex and
04:37 - heavy hopefully it'll go smoothly so
04:39 - fingers crossed thanks for watching and
04:41 - I'll see you in the next one
