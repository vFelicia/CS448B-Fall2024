00:00 - hey code crew what's up welcome to my
00:02 - firebase tutorial series where we are
00:04 - going to build an app together that is
00:06 - going to leverage various parts of the
00:08 - firebase platform the first one being
00:10 - firebase authentication we're going to
00:13 - build a custom login UI that is going to
00:16 - connect to the authentication store on
00:18 - the firebase platform and we're going to
00:19 - use that to store the users and the
00:21 - credentials and stuff like that but it's
00:24 - going to be interacting with our custom
00:26 - built UI now the second part of it is we
00:29 - want to use firestore I'm going to show
00:31 - you how to retrieve data from fire store
00:33 - and then display it into a table view in
00:36 - your app I'm also going to show you how
00:38 - you can input data from your app and
00:40 - write that data to the remote fire
00:42 - storage database now if that all sounds
00:44 - good to you I want you to give this
00:46 - video a big thumbs up hit subscribe
00:48 - below and hit that Bell notification so
00:50 - you don't miss the next video in this
00:52 - series and one more thing before we get
00:54 - started I want you to drop me a comment
00:56 - below and let me know if you've ever
00:58 - used firebase before because depending
01:00 - on your experience level with firebase
01:02 - and the other people watching this
01:04 - series I am going to tailor the next
01:07 - videos coming up and go faster and
01:09 - slower depending on what you guys reply
01:11 - so please make sure drop a comment below
01:13 - and let me know if you've used firebase
01:15 - firestore or far based authentication
01:17 - before alright so let's get started
01:25 - we're gonna start by creating a brand
01:27 - new Xcode product here now I want you to
01:30 - go here create a brand new Xcode project
01:33 - under iOS choose single View application
01:36 - and I'm gonna call this a fire store
01:40 - demo if this is the first time ever that
01:42 - you're creating a new Xcode project then
01:44 - chances are this will be empty but you
01:47 - can copy what I have here instead of
01:49 - comm code with Kris you can put either
01:51 - comm dot your name or comm that your
01:53 - company and together with the product
01:56 - name it's going to form this bundle ID
01:58 - which is going to be important for us as
02:00 - your team you can leave it as none for
02:03 - now if you don't have a team you can
02:04 - always set one up for free after with
02:06 - the fact now for the language I want you
02:08 - to choose Swift and for all of this
02:11 - stuff just leave it unchecked or if it
02:12 - is checked just uncheck them all so you
02:15 - have what I have here now Swift UI is
02:18 - something that is still in beta right
02:20 - now and it's changing so I'm not going
02:22 - to use it we're still gonna stick with
02:23 - trusty old storyboards as much as we
02:26 - love it or hate it so let's go ahead and
02:29 - click Next and I'm going to save this in
02:32 - a folder on my desktop that I've created
02:35 - for this project called firebase Tut and
02:37 - the source control unchecked so let's
02:40 - create our project alright just like
02:42 - that we've got our brand-new project
02:44 - again take note of the bundle identifier
02:46 - because we're going to need that real
02:47 - soon
02:48 - so we're going to now navigate to
02:52 - firebase Google comm so let me actually
02:54 - just back out of here so I'll show you
02:57 - what this looks like in case you don't
02:59 - have an account yet you're gonna land on
03:01 - a web page like this I would click there
03:04 - should be a sign-in button in the upper
03:06 - right hand corner or something like that
03:07 - or sign up go ahead and log in with your
03:11 - Google account or sign up for a new
03:12 - Google account and then you will be
03:15 - brought to a screen that kind of looks
03:16 - like this except that you might not have
03:18 - any projects I'm gonna add a new project
03:20 - as should you and it sees that I'm three
03:25 - projects away from the project limit now
03:27 - there is a limit I think it's like what
03:30 - do I have here seven ten twelve so
03:33 - that's 15 projects you can request for
03:36 - more projects if you need to
03:38 - depending on the reason they will allow
03:41 - you or deny you I've requested it before
03:44 - on my other Google account and they have
03:46 - proved me so I don't I don't think it
03:48 - should be a problem a new project I'm
03:51 - gonna call this fire store demo and how
03:56 - about fire store youtube demo project
04:01 - idea why would it do that I mean I don't
04:04 - think it really matters just for your
04:06 - own identification purposes
04:08 - now for this part if you're actually
04:09 - creating a an app that you're going to
04:12 - push into production and you're gonna
04:13 - release it I would actually take a
04:15 - closer look at how they are using this
04:17 - data and you know decide whether you are
04:20 - okay with that or not for this demo I am
04:23 - just going to acept
04:25 - and create project you know because if
04:28 - you're going to be storing let's say
04:29 - really confidential information you just
04:32 - want to make sure that how they're going
04:36 - to be using your data and sharing your
04:37 - data is compliant with your company or
04:41 - different standards in your industry all
04:45 - right so let's click continue and we're
04:48 - going to continue setting up this
04:50 - back-end now since we're creating iOS
04:54 - apps we're gonna click on iOS here
04:56 - actually before we do this I think I
04:59 - skipped a step let me just explain to
05:02 - you what we're doing here so so far
05:04 - we've signed up for a firebase account
05:06 - if you haven't already but when you
05:09 - click on add a new project you're
05:11 - basically creating a back-end for your
05:13 - app a firebase back-end and that's going
05:16 - to give you several things for your app
05:18 - one is if you see here on the left hand
05:21 - side an authentication user story you
05:23 - have database obviously for the data
05:25 - that you're gonna store storage which is
05:27 - file storage these things I haven't
05:30 - really used so I can't say as much but
05:33 - essentially by creating a firebase
05:35 - project you're creating a firebase
05:37 - back-end for your specific app you're
05:40 - going to get a configuration file for
05:43 - your app which you're going to add to
05:45 - Xcode as you're going to soon see all
05:47 - right so let's click on iOS here and
05:50 - this is where that bundle ID
05:52 - comes into play so go back to your Xcode
05:55 - project and copy this bundle ID here
05:59 - paste them into there you can add a
06:01 - nickname for your app this is just for
06:03 - your own identification purposes or an
06:05 - app store ID if you are submitting this
06:08 - or after you've submitted it and created
06:11 - the catalog listing in the App Store but
06:14 - for us we're not going to do that we're
06:16 - just going to register the app and we're
06:19 - going to download this configuration P
06:21 - list and we're going to add it into
06:23 - Xcode as you can see here we simply drag
06:26 - it and drop it into the file navigator
06:28 - so let's go ahead and download that I'm
06:31 - just going to I'm going to put it into
06:33 - the same folder right here and we're
06:37 - gonna click Next and then we are going
06:41 - to add it to our Xcode so let's open
06:43 - that up let's open the folder and I'm
06:46 - going to just click and drag this under
06:48 - my info.plist it's gonna pop this open
06:51 - the two important things for you to take
06:54 - note of here is make sure that this is
06:56 - checked add two targets is this is going
06:59 - to add that file and include it into
07:01 - this specific app now destination copy
07:06 - items if needed I usually check this as
07:09 - well because this makes a copy of that P
07:12 - list into your project folder and it
07:14 - just keeps it all nice and tidy so we
07:18 - can finish that so let me just show you
07:21 - what it's done here this is where I
07:23 - downloaded the file but as you can see
07:25 - inside it's actually copied it into the
07:29 - project folder so I can actually delete
07:32 - the one that I download it because it's
07:34 - made a copy of it inside the project
07:36 - already so you just don't have files
07:39 - floating around everywhere alright so
07:41 - this part is done
07:42 - the next part is all of the firebase
07:46 - library files or the firebase SDK now
07:49 - this contains all of the firebase
07:51 - classes that is going to let us talk to
07:54 - the firebase back-end and this is what
07:57 - makes using these sorts of platforms
07:59 - really attractive because you don't have
08:02 - to write a lot of code they give you all
08:05 - of these class
08:05 - and libraries for you to leverage and
08:08 - you can just call methods passing data
08:10 - and these pre-written methods will
08:13 - basically contain the networking code to
08:16 - go talk to their back-end and send them
08:19 - the data retrieve the data that's going
08:21 - to let you query the data all that sort
08:22 - of stuff so that's what this far based
08:24 - SDK is all about and we need to add
08:27 - these files and this code into our Xcode
08:31 - project now there are a couple of ways
08:33 - to do this you can actually download the
08:35 - zip file and then you can manually add
08:38 - it to your project as just a whole bunch
08:41 - of files the downside of this is that
08:45 - from time to time
08:47 - firebase updates these libraries they
08:50 - make changes to the methods changes to
08:52 - the codes and you're not going to know
08:54 - this unless you kind of keep up to date
08:57 - with their changes and then you're gonna
08:59 - have to redownload the zip file and re
09:01 - import it into your project and it
09:03 - becomes a nightmare when you're talking
09:05 - about lots of code libraries if you're
09:06 - using a lot of different third-party
09:08 - libraries this is where cocoa pods comes
09:11 - in if you haven't used this before you
09:14 - actually have to set this up on your
09:16 - computer first and this is a package
09:19 - manager or a dependency manager which
09:23 - basically keeps track of which libraries
09:25 - need updating and then you can type in a
09:27 - simple command and it's going to
09:29 - download all of the updated versions of
09:31 - those libraries and update the copies in
09:34 - your project so it is an easy way to
09:37 - manage all of these third-party
09:39 - libraries and make sure that you have
09:41 - up-to-date versions alright so if you
09:44 - haven't installed cocoa pods on your
09:46 - machine yet I have a video to show you
09:48 - guys how to do that just check out the
09:50 - video on the screen in the upper right
09:52 - hand corner now I guess you would have
09:54 - to pause this video and then go install
09:56 - cocoa pods following that video first
09:58 - and then come back to this video now if
10:00 - you already have it installed then we
10:02 - can continue on right here so I already
10:05 - have it installed I'm going to go on
10:07 - with this video so what you do is you
10:10 - can open up terminal on your Mac and you
10:13 - can navigate to that folder that your
10:16 - project is in so if you're not going
10:19 - familiar with these terminal commands LS
10:21 - will list all of the current files and
10:24 - directories in your in the path that
10:27 - you're at currently since my folder is
10:30 - in the desktop I need to navigate there
10:32 - and as you can see this is my route a
10:36 - user directory that's there's my desktop
10:38 - folder right there and to kind of drill
10:40 - into that you do CD space desktop and
10:45 - then now I'm you can see that the path
10:48 - has changed to desktop if you do LS
10:50 - again you can see all of the files and
10:51 - folders here the one I want is actually
10:55 - fire-based
10:56 - Tut so CD firebase and a shortcut is
11:01 - actually just press tab and it's going
11:03 - to autocomplete that folder name for you
11:06 - so if I do LS I've got the project
11:10 - folder in there too so I'm going to
11:12 - drill into that and finally I'm at the
11:15 - folder that has my Xcode prod project
11:19 - file here from here from here you type
11:23 - pod in it so if you get an error just
11:30 - like the one that I experienced where it
11:32 - was saying that you didn't have
11:34 - permission and you needed to look at the
11:37 - license first
11:38 - well what you'd have to do like this one
11:43 - right here
11:44 - it tells you to agree into the Xcode iOS
11:49 - license requires that min privileges
11:51 - please run this command and then that's
11:54 - what I did around this command and then
11:56 - you have to read well you can read or
12:00 - not read it but you can scroll through
12:01 - it and then you hit agree at the end and
12:04 - we should be good now so that's not
12:06 - something that I had to do before but it
12:08 - might have something to do with the fact
12:10 - that I'm using a beta version of Xcode
12:12 - and maybe this is something that they
12:14 - will do now so let me type in pod in it
12:17 - and after you do that if you just go
12:22 - ahead and open up your folder you're
12:24 - going to see now you have an additional
12:26 - pod file inside your Xcode project so
12:29 - we're going to open this up in a text
12:31 - editor
12:32 - for example sublime the one that I use
12:35 - right here we are going to then in this
12:39 - file lists all of the third-party
12:41 - libraries that we're going to use with
12:43 - this Xcode project so as you can see
12:46 - from these instructions here we're going
12:47 - to want to add this to our pod file so
12:50 - I'm going to grab that and paste that in
12:54 - there and then I'm going to save this
12:56 - file make sure you hit save and then
13:00 - we're gonna run pod install which is
13:02 - going to read all of those libraries
13:05 - from the pod file it's going to go and
13:08 - fetch them and then it's going to add
13:09 - them into your Xcode project so this is
13:12 - how cocoa pods helps you manage those
13:15 - dependencies for your app through this
13:17 - pod file now many of the third-party
13:20 - libraries that you want to work with
13:21 - let's say for example Twitter or
13:23 - Facebook or maybe even the github
13:25 - libraries some user generated ones a lot
13:28 - of them will be available as a cocoa pod
13:31 - that you can just grab that pod URL and
13:35 - then put it in your pod file and then
13:36 - just run pod install so simple as that
13:39 - and then when it comes time to updating
13:41 - those libraries all you're gonna have to
13:43 - do again it's just hip hot installer pod
13:46 - update it's going to make sure that you
13:48 - have all of the appropriate versions or
13:50 - the latest versions and then you're good
13:53 - to go alright so that part is done let's
13:56 - click Next
13:57 - oh one thing if you're unfamiliar with
13:59 - cocoa pods let me just go back to here
14:03 - after you hit pod install it's going to
14:06 - create this X C workspace file for your
14:09 - app use this file for all future
14:10 - development on your application so what
14:13 - we're supposed to do here is we're gonna
14:15 - close the project in Xcode and then if
14:18 - you open up your folder you're gonna see
14:21 - that there's a whole bunch of new files
14:23 - inside the pods directory you're gonna
14:25 - have all these libraries the firebase
14:28 - libraries that we wanted to add but now
14:30 - instead of opening up the Xcode projects
14:34 - C workspace file and this will include
14:37 - your pods or your libraries that you
14:42 - added all right so that's done let's go
14:44 - now
14:45 - so we're gonna add the initialization
14:47 - code we're gonna choose the swift
14:48 - version and you can see here there are
14:52 - two different lines in the app delegate
14:54 - file you're going to import database
14:56 - right this is going to say that you're
14:58 - using those firebase libraries and then
15:01 - the firebase app dog configure which is
15:03 - going to configure your app it's going
15:05 - to basically take a look at your
15:09 - configuration file that we added
15:11 - remember this guy right here Google
15:12 - service info pls contains all of the
15:15 - configuration details to connect to this
15:17 - particular firebase back-end alright so
15:21 - let's go into app delegate we are going
15:24 - to import firebase and then in here it's
15:32 - just in case you're not familiar did
15:34 - finish launching with options and that's
15:36 - this one right here and we're gonna want
15:38 - to do it above the return true statement
15:41 - it's a firebase app dot configure now if
15:46 - you know you're typing that and it
15:48 - doesn't autocomplete or doesn't show up
15:50 - or maybe you get some errors after
15:52 - typing this what I would try and do is
15:55 - just press command B to build your
15:58 - project to make sure that Xcode realizes
16:01 - you've added all of these Xcode I sorry
16:05 - I mean firebase libraries to your
16:07 - project so that's what you want to do
16:08 - there all right so while that's building
16:11 - let's go on to the next part now run
16:14 - your app to verify your installation so
16:16 - it's gonna continue checking for a while
16:18 - what we're going to want to do so they
16:21 - are build succeeded and so no errors
16:24 - what we're gonna want to do now is just
16:25 - run our project in the simulator we're
16:27 - gonna launch it let's click this button
16:29 - or press command R to launch it your
16:33 - simulator might take a while to boot up
16:35 - if you don't have it up already but
16:36 - after it launches your app it's going to
16:38 - ping the firebase servers and this
16:42 - should turn into a check mark and then
16:43 - that's our flag that we've set all of
16:47 - this up correctly so you know I know
16:49 - this setup process was a little bit
16:51 - tedious but after you do it a couple of
16:53 - times and you've got cocoapods installed
16:55 - already it makes working with
16:58 - fire base in the future a lot more
17:00 - simple as well as working with any other
17:02 - third-party libraries that also have
17:05 - cocoa pods you're gonna see a lot of
17:08 - debug output here I wouldn't worry about
17:11 - any of this you can see there's a ton on
17:14 - line too
17:14 - now the app has finished launching it's
17:16 - a blank screen because it's a new
17:18 - project but this sometimes takes a
17:20 - couple of minutes a couple of seconds to
17:24 - register because it doesn't check
17:27 - constantly so I don't know what that
17:28 - interval is but if you don't see it
17:32 - after a couple like a minute I would
17:34 - just close your app just stop it and run
17:37 - it again just to make sure and then
17:40 - continue to console so that's it now
17:43 - we're ready to build the login UI in the
17:47 - next video and then we're gonna hook it
17:48 - up we're going to set up the
17:50 - authentication store and we are going to
17:52 - start doing all the fun stuff now that
17:55 - the setup is done so thank you so much
17:57 - for watching if you've enjoyed this
17:58 - video and you want to see the next one
18:00 - make sure you don't miss it by making
18:01 - sure you're subscribed and enabling that
18:04 - Bell icon so that you get notified when
18:06 - I upload the next video so don't forget
18:08 - to thumbs up the video and leave a
18:10 - comment below letting me know if you've
18:12 - worked with firebase before or not and I
18:14 - look forward to seeing you in the next
18:16 - one alright bye for now
