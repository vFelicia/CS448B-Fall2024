00:00 - hi welcome to lesson 4 of 10 it cooked
00:03 - with your new skills in Auto layout and
00:04 - stack views it's time to put your skills
00:07 - to the test by the end of this video
00:09 - you're going to have built the user
00:10 - interface for our war card game app
00:13 - we're gonna start a brand new Xcode
00:15 - project make sure you're looking under
00:16 - the iOS tab at single view app let's
00:19 - click Next
00:20 - for the product name I'm going to call
00:22 - it the war app and the rest of the
00:24 - details should be the same as your
00:26 - previous project so you don't need to
00:27 - change any of it the only thing I want
00:29 - you to make sure of is that the language
00:31 - says Swift and if it doesn't just hit
00:34 - this drop-down and select it let's click
00:36 - Next and then let's save it on the
00:38 - desktop or anywhere you'd like the first
00:41 - thing we're gonna do is add the graphic
00:43 - assets into our Xcode project so below
00:45 - the video you're going to find a link to
00:47 - download these assets
00:48 - it's called lesson for assets just go
00:51 - ahead and click that link and download
00:52 - that zip file save it on your desktop
00:54 - and I've already done that so I'm gonna
00:57 - go ahead and double click that zip file
01:00 - to unzip it after you unzip it you're
01:02 - going to get a folder if you open up
01:04 - that folder you're gonna see all of the
01:06 - graphic assets for our project now you
01:09 - might notice that each of these assets
01:12 - come in a set of three so let's open up
01:15 - a set of these assets I'm going to open
01:17 - up back dot PNG this is the back of the
01:20 - card let's open up back at 2x dot PNG
01:23 - and back at 3x dot PNG if I spread them
01:27 - out a little bit you can see that back
01:31 - dot PNG is the original size back at 2x
01:34 - thought PNG is two times that size and
01:37 - the 3x version is just 3x the size of
01:40 - the original and the reason why we have
01:42 - three different sizes for the same
01:44 - graphic asset is to accommodate the
01:47 - different iPhone screen resolutions so
01:49 - the retina screens use the at 2x version
01:52 - and the larger screens like the iPhone 8
01:55 - plus use the at 3x version let's go
01:59 - ahead and close these now we're gonna
02:02 - actually just add all of these to our
02:04 - project so first go into the asset
02:07 - library for your Xcode project and then
02:09 - go back to the folder hit command a on
02:12 - your keyboard to select everything
02:13 - and then let's drag and drop them into
02:16 - our asset library and you're going to
02:19 - see that Xcode is smart enough to group
02:21 - all of the different sizes together so
02:24 - if you click on let's say back you're
02:26 - gonna see the 1x 2x and 3x group
02:29 - together like that
02:30 - so you should have back background car 2
02:32 - all the way to card 14 deal button and
02:35 - logo now let's go back to the main dot
02:38 - storyboard and in the lower right hand
02:40 - corner in the library pane make sure
02:42 - you're looking at this object library
02:44 - tab and the filter box let's type in
02:47 - image view and let's drag and drop that
02:50 - guy right there and make sure you've
02:53 - selected it in the document outline
02:55 - let's go to add new constraints we're
02:58 - gonna uncheck constraint margins and I'm
03:00 - going to pull down these little drop
03:02 - downs and I'm going to choose view
03:04 - inside of safe area because I want this
03:06 - background to be edge to edge
03:10 - let's go ahead and do that and then
03:13 - let's change all of these to 0 so 0 Tab
03:16 - 0 tab 0 tab hitting the tab button on
03:20 - your keyboard just helps you jump from
03:21 - box to box and I just want to draw to
03:25 - your attention if you change it to view
03:28 - now or you click view again like I'm
03:31 - doing now that number changes so just be
03:34 - cautious of that and make sure that
03:36 - those are zeros and in any case even if
03:39 - you add the wrong constraint you know
03:41 - how to edit or remove it and we add it
03:44 - because we learned that in lesson two so
03:46 - let's go ahead and add these four
03:48 - constraints you're going to see your UI
03:50 - view stretched from edge to edge even
03:53 - all the way to the top and of yours
03:55 - doesn't look like that just go in the
03:57 - document outline delete all four
03:58 - constraints and try that again okay so
04:01 - now having the image view highlighted in
04:04 - the inspector pane on the right hand
04:06 - side choose image and let's choose
04:09 - background like that the second thing
04:12 - we're going to do is we're gonna add a
04:13 - stack view a vertical one because we're
04:15 - gonna have the logo and have the cards
04:17 - everything is kind of stacked in a
04:19 - vertical fashion so let's go down here
04:21 - in that filter box let's search for a
04:24 - stack view I'm going to add a vertical
04:26 - stack view
04:27 - like that and now we're gonna set some
04:29 - constraints for it
04:30 - click add new constraints I'm going to
04:33 - remove constraint margins and I'm gonna
04:36 - put zeros for all of them again but this
04:39 - time I'm gonna leave them relative to
04:41 - the safe area because I don't want the
04:44 - elements in the stack views to be
04:46 - blocked by anything so let's add those 4
04:49 - constraints you'll see that they are
04:51 - edge to edge except for the top here
04:53 - where the status bar is covered okay so
04:56 - we're good for that and now it's time to
04:58 - add some elements so let's go back to
05:00 - the stack view here and again we're
05:01 - going to search for image view so go
05:03 - ahead and drag that into the stack view
05:05 - in the document outline you should see
05:08 - the stack view right here and then you
05:10 - can see the image view is inside of the
05:12 - stack view if you collapse the stack
05:14 - view that image view should be inside of
05:16 - it okay and the background is outside
05:18 - it's behind the stack view okay so we've
05:20 - got this image view here we are going to
05:24 - add another stack view and this time
05:28 - it's going to be a horizontal stack view
05:30 - so rather than dragging it onto the
05:33 - screen here I'm actually going to drag
05:35 - it into the document outline and the way
05:38 - I've done it here is I've put it inside
05:41 - the stack view but below the image view
05:43 - so if you collapse the stack view both
05:45 - the horizontal stack view in the image
05:47 - view should be inside of it and in fact
05:49 - I'm actually going to click this you can
05:50 - hit enter and I'm going to just rename
05:53 - this right now and call it the root
05:55 - stack view so when I refer to the root
05:57 - stack view you know I'm talking about
05:59 - this guy the stack view that contains
06:01 - everything ok so we've got this stack
06:03 - view this horizontal one right here and
06:05 - in the filter box we're going to type in
06:09 - an image view again and we are going to
06:11 - drag this into the document outline and
06:13 - this time I'm going to put it inside
06:15 - that horizontal stack for you okay so if
06:18 - I collapse this you should see that
06:19 - image view being tucked inside of it I'm
06:22 - gonna do that again because we have two
06:23 - cards and again you can put it inside
06:25 - now if you accidentally put it on the
06:28 - outside let's say you know you put it
06:29 - somewhere like that and then you
06:31 - collapse that stack view and that image
06:33 - view is still there just go ahead and
06:35 - put it inside like that you can
06:37 - rearrange them and sometimes it takes a
06:40 - little bit of
06:40 - patience to get it just right okay so
06:43 - we've got to image views here these two
06:45 - represents the two cards so it's
06:47 - starting to get a little bit confusing
06:49 - in the UI here so let's start setting
06:51 - some images and start naming some of
06:54 - these things so I'm going to call this
06:55 - the card stack view and you can hit
06:57 - enter to rename it and this one I'm
06:59 - going to change the distribution to fill
07:02 - equally and so you can see that change
07:04 - down there and for this image view I'm
07:07 - going to click it and in the inspector
07:09 - property I'm going to choose back and
07:12 - then this one I'm going to choose back
07:14 - as well so don't worry that it doesn't
07:16 - look quite right
07:17 - right now all right so there's our card
07:20 - stack view containing the two card
07:23 - images for this one above it this one is
07:26 - supposed to be the logo so I'm gonna
07:27 - scroll down and choose a logo like that
07:29 - and then right now it really doesn't
07:31 - look right but we can deal with that in
07:34 - a second okay and now we're gonna go to
07:39 - button and we are going to drag this
07:42 - button now this part is going to be a
07:44 - little tricky because we want to put it
07:47 - into the root stack view but below the
07:50 - card stack view and sometimes when you
07:53 - drag this button here it wants to put
07:55 - itself inside this card stack view look
07:58 - I've just accidentally put it inside the
08:00 - card stack view and you can see there's
08:02 - a card there's a card hand then there's
08:03 - a button beside it that's incorrect I
08:05 - actually want the button outside of it
08:07 - so an easy way to position it is if you
08:11 - drag this guy out and then just drag it
08:13 - in between the logo and the button like
08:14 - that you know it's not supposed to be
08:16 - there but now you can collapse this card
08:19 - stack view and then just move this one
08:20 - above the button and so that's an easy
08:23 - way to get get what you want for the
08:26 - route stack view what we can do now is
08:28 - actually highlight it on the right hand
08:30 - side change the distribution to fill
08:32 - equally so that's going to give an equal
08:35 - amount of space to all of the elements
08:37 - inside of it so the next thing we're
08:39 - going to do is we're gonna add some
08:41 - labels so let's go down here in the
08:44 - bottom right let's choose label or type
08:47 - in label rather and let's drag this
08:49 - label and again I'm going to just drag
08:51 - it into the document
08:53 - and put it below that button you know
08:55 - everything should actually be inside of
08:56 - this root stack view so I just want you
08:58 - to do a sanity check here so collapse
09:01 - that root stack view you shouldn't see
09:02 - any elements outside of that stack view
09:04 - if they are just click it and drag it
09:07 - into the root stack view and inside the
09:09 - root stack view you should have the logo
09:11 - the card stack view which contains these
09:13 - two card images and then a button and
09:16 - then the label so let's add a couple
09:18 - more labels let's click and drag that
09:20 - guy and put it in between the button and
09:22 - the label let's click it and do that
09:25 - again we're gonna add a total of four
09:26 - let's do that again okay and then I'm
09:30 - going to select all four labels you can
09:32 - hold down command and you can
09:34 - individually select all four and then
09:37 - let's change the color of the text to
09:41 - white and then now what we're going to
09:44 - do is to let's select it from here we're
09:49 - going to select that label and hold down
09:51 - command and select the second label and
09:53 - we are going to click this button to put
09:56 - them both into a stack view and so
09:58 - that's gonna put them into a vertical
10:00 - stack view we're gonna do the same for
10:02 - these two bottom ones click this guy
10:04 - hold down command to select this guy
10:06 - simultaneously and then we're going to
10:09 - click this button and embed that into a
10:11 - vertical stack view as well so now in
10:14 - the document outline below this button
10:16 - element you should have two vertical
10:18 - stack views inside of each of them
10:20 - you're gonna have two labels okay now
10:22 - let's collapse these two staff use a
10:25 - hold down command select both of them
10:27 - simultaneously like that and then let's
10:30 - click this embed in stack view again so
10:34 - now you're gonna have a vertical stack
10:36 - view with two vertical stack views
10:38 - inside each of them containing two
10:40 - labels however for this stack view that
10:43 - contains all of this stuff below it
10:45 - we're gonna change this to a horizontal
10:47 - axis so go on the right-hand side and
10:50 - inspector pane and let's change that to
10:52 - a horizontal and then you're gonna get
10:54 - something that looks like this it still
10:57 - doesn't look quite right but we're gonna
10:58 - fix it so in this horizontal stack view
11:01 - that you just changed let's change the
11:03 - distribution to fill equally and then
11:06 - for this first stack view in here let's
11:09 - change the alignment to Center and let's
11:11 - change distribution to fill equally and
11:13 - then for this one that contains the
11:15 - labels on the right-hand side we're
11:16 - going to do the same alignment is Center
11:18 - and distribution is fill equally so now
11:21 - it's starting to take shape okay so for
11:24 - this label that is on top on the left
11:27 - hand side let's change that to change
11:30 - the player the text the player and then
11:33 - let's change the font to a bold type of
11:37 - font and then for this one right here
11:43 - we're going to change that to CPU and
11:46 - then we're going to change the font
11:49 - weight to bold and then for this label
11:53 - right here we're going to change that to
11:57 - zero for this label we're going to
12:02 - change that to zero okay so now we have
12:05 - pretty much all the elements on the
12:07 - screen it still doesn't look quite right
12:08 - but we're not done yet so for this
12:11 - button let's go here and change the
12:15 - image to deal button and let's erase
12:20 - that text right there okay starting to
12:23 - take shape for this logo up here I want
12:26 - you to click that and right now it's set
12:28 - the scale to fill so it's stretching it
12:31 - out and I want to change that just the
12:33 - center instead and so where it's not
12:36 - going to try and stretch it it's just
12:37 - going to Center that image inside of the
12:40 - image view and for these guys right here
12:43 - instead of scale to fill you know it's
12:45 - really pulling it in all directions to
12:48 - fill up the image view I'm going to
12:50 - change it to aspect to fit and same
12:53 - thing for this guy I'm going to change
12:55 - from Seattle Phil to aspect fit and then
12:58 - you get something like this which looks
13:00 - like what you intended so one thing is
13:04 - that one thing we can change is for this
13:06 - route stacked view if you feel like it's
13:09 - stretching all the way down here too
13:11 - much we can just bump everything up a
13:14 - little bit so for this route staff you
13:16 - select it let's go into size inspector
13:19 - and scroll down to all of the
13:22 - constraints that relate to the rootstock
13:24 - view and for this one that aligns the
13:27 - bottom of the stack view to the safe
13:29 - area let's click Edit and let's change
13:32 - that constant to something like 20 and
13:34 - then you're gonna see it bump up just by
13:36 - a bit alright so let's take a look at
13:40 - this UI in a couple of different
13:42 - orientations and devices so down here it
13:46 - says view as iPhone 8 I'm just gonna
13:48 - open that up and I'll leave it at
13:51 - portrait right now so we'll test out the
13:53 - portrait ones first let's choose the
13:55 - iPhone 10 yea let's minimize it a little
13:59 - bit so we can see everything and if your
14:01 - screen turns white and you can't see
14:03 - anything just change the zoom level here
14:05 - if you can't see that these zoom
14:06 - controls just hide this document outline
14:08 - by clicking this button here that's
14:11 - gonna create more space here to allow
14:13 - you to see those zoom buttons all right
14:16 - let's see the iPhone 8 plus like you see
14:18 - my screen just turned white let's just
14:20 - zoom in and zoom back out this is the
14:24 - iPhone se this is the iPhone 4s okay so
14:27 - that now let's check out the horizontal
14:30 - ones or landscape orientation so change
14:32 - the orientation looks pretty good you
14:36 - know the cards are kind of small which
14:38 - is something that we can definitely
14:39 - address clicking that now looks a little
14:42 - messed up but that's just kind of a
14:43 - refresh issue so let's zoom out and zoom
14:46 - back in and you can see that it looks
14:48 - fine
14:48 - now on these bigger screens you can see
14:50 - that the cards are really smaller and
14:52 - the reason for this is because the root
14:54 - stack view we told it to distribute its
14:56 - spaced equally between all of the
14:58 - elements so the logo gets an equal chunk
15:01 - of space the cards get an equal chunk of
15:04 - space the buttons the labels down here
15:06 - they all get an equal chunk of space if
15:08 - we wanted these cards to be bigger we
15:10 - would actually have to tell that root
15:12 - stack view instead of distribution fill
15:15 - equally and we might say something like
15:16 - fill and then you can see it looks a lot
15:19 - better right but the problem is if we
15:21 - change the distribution to its fill if
15:24 - we go back to the portrait orientation
15:28 - you can see that the things start to
15:30 - look scrunched up so this real
15:33 - solution here is if we have distribution
15:37 - to be fill equally for this vertical
15:40 - orientation but for the horizontal
15:43 - orientation you know that we could
15:45 - change the distribution to fill and that
15:47 - is something that we can do actually
15:50 - I'll show you that in a second but first
15:52 - we need to talk about something called
15:54 - size classes size classes are basically
15:57 - categories of screen sizes because there
16:00 - are so many devices and two orientations
16:02 - for each device that Apple decided to
16:05 - separate all of these into different
16:06 - categories of screen sizes so when
16:09 - you're adding a constraint you are able
16:11 - to say something like add this
16:13 - constraint for all size classes as in
16:16 - all categories of screen sizes or only
16:19 - add this constraint for a specific size
16:22 - class so this gives us some flexibility
16:25 - to change the layout depending on a
16:28 - specific size class let's say your app
16:31 - might look different on the iPad size
16:34 - classes versus like a smaller device
16:36 - like an iPhone and each size class is
16:41 - defined by two parameters a height and a
16:44 - width now the height can be compact or
16:47 - regular and the width can also be
16:50 - compact or regular so for instance one
16:53 - size class might be compact width and
16:56 - compact height another size class might
16:59 - be compact width but regular height and
17:01 - in the case where you don't care about
17:03 - size classes and you want to add your
17:05 - constraint for all size classes it would
17:08 - be any width and any height now let's
17:11 - dive back into our Xcode project and I
17:13 - can show you how we can add a constraint
17:16 - for a specific size class now the first
17:19 - thing I want you to look at is down here
17:21 - in the view as iPhone 10 you can see the
17:25 - size Clause here that this is it is
17:28 - compact width and compact height let's
17:31 - change it to the portrait orientation
17:34 - and you can just see that size class
17:36 - changes to compact width but regular
17:38 - height so just to reiterate what we want
17:41 - we want distribution to be fill equally
17:45 - on the compound
17:46 - with and regular height or actually we
17:49 - want it to be filled equally for any
17:50 - size class but when it comes to this
17:55 - size class right the compact width and
17:59 - compact height we want distribution to
18:02 - be fill instead all right so that's just
18:04 - for that case just for that size class
18:06 - of compact width and compact height we
18:09 - want distribution to be fill otherwise
18:11 - we want fill equally for all other size
18:14 - classes so this is where you're going to
18:17 - let's set it back to fill equally and we
18:21 - are looking at this size class right now
18:23 - right compact width and combo tight and
18:25 - we're going to click this very for
18:27 - traits button and we're going to
18:30 - introduce a variation based on the width
18:34 - and the height so we're going to click
18:36 - both and then just click out of that and
18:39 - this section turns blue and it shows you
18:43 - your you are currently varying for all
18:45 - of these screens all of these screens
18:49 - are in this size class or in this
18:51 - category of screen size I don't know if
18:55 - you've noticed but we are actually
18:57 - missing a screen size there was one to
18:59 - the left of this iPhone 10 and that was
19:01 - the iPhone 8 plus now let's take a look
19:04 - at Y varying for this size class doesn't
19:08 - include that iPhone 8 plus so I'm gonna
19:11 - click done varying to kind of get back
19:13 - to all size classes and let's go ahead
19:17 - and click this iPhone 8 plus well this
19:20 - iPhone 8 plus is not in the same size
19:22 - class as these other guys it's in the
19:25 - regular width and compact height and the
19:29 - reason is is because the screen is just
19:31 - so big that it it counts as regular
19:34 - width it doesn't count as compact width
19:37 - whereas these other guys like the iPhone
19:39 - 10 counts as a compact width so if we
19:43 - wanted you know to also add our
19:47 - constraint for this size class as well
19:51 - what we're going to do is we're going to
19:53 - click on vary for traits but we're going
19:55 - to introduce the variations simply on
19:57 - the height
19:58 - we're gonna say that for any compact
20:03 - height size class we don't care about
20:05 - what width it is whether its regular
20:07 - width or compact width we don't care we
20:09 - only want to care about the height so if
20:12 - it's compact height right now you can
20:15 - see that it includes the iPhone 8
20:17 - alright whereas before when I varied on
20:19 - both of them both the high end the width
20:23 - it did not so I'm just gonna vary on the
20:26 - height right now all right so I'm gonna
20:28 - have this blue section here and it tells
20:31 - us we are varying for the compact height
20:34 - devices and what I'm going to do is go
20:37 - up to distribution it should be set to
20:39 - fill equally right now click this little
20:41 - plus icon beside distribution and here I
20:45 - can say again you can kind of set the
20:48 - variation that you want leave it as
20:50 - width as any and the height is compact
20:53 - click Add variation and then now you can
20:56 - see that you can actually change this
20:59 - value specifically for this size class
21:03 - which is compact height so I'm going to
21:06 - change this to fill and now it's
21:09 - basically going to use fill equally for
21:11 - all cases except for size classes of
21:15 - compact height in that case it's going
21:18 - to use fill all right let's click done
21:20 - varying down here and then let's test
21:22 - this out so if I go into portrait mode
21:26 - you can see that it uses fill equally it
21:28 - still looks good but when I go into
21:30 - landscape mode you can see that it uses
21:32 - fill and my cards look bigger than they
21:35 - were before let's go check out the
21:37 - iPhone 10 see how big those cards are
21:41 - when I go into a portrait you can still
21:44 - see that everything is spaced out evenly
21:46 - all right so let's run this in the
21:49 - simulator as a last task and I'm going
21:53 - to choose the iPhone 8 plus simulator
21:56 - this time
22:00 - all right so here we are with the
22:03 - portrait orientation I'm gonna press
22:05 - command and the right arrow and here we
22:08 - have the landscape orientation and then
22:10 - let us stop this project and let's
22:12 - choose a small one like the the 5s and
22:16 - let's launch that oh and we've actually
22:20 - popped up a different simulator so here
22:25 - we have the portrait orientation let's
22:26 - press command right arrow and here we've
22:29 - got the landscape one and both look
22:31 - pretty good that's awesome right if
22:34 - you're having trouble putting this
22:35 - layout together just leave me a comment
22:37 - below and I'll jump right in to help out
22:39 - also make sure you download my Xcode
