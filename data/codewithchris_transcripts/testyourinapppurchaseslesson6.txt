00:00 - in this video i'll show you how to
00:01 - create a sandbox test user in app store
00:04 - connect
00:04 - and then we're going to use that test
00:06 - user to test our in-app purchase
00:08 - implementation on an
00:09 - actual device hi i'm chris and welcome
00:11 - to code with chris the place to be if
00:13 - you want to learn how to code and to
00:14 - build apps
00:15 - this is lesson six of the revenue cats
00:17 - video series so if you missed the
00:19 - previous episodes i highly recommend
00:21 - that you check those out
00:22 - in the playlist right over there here's
00:24 - where we are in our seven step process
00:27 - all right let's get started all right so
00:30 - there was a slight modification that i
00:32 - did from our last lesson
00:34 - and what i did was in the view will
00:36 - appear of the main view controller where
00:38 - we check
00:39 - if the user has pro entitlements
00:42 - and then we showed you know the tours
00:45 - and we removed the
00:46 - uh the pay wall button um that code was
00:49 - in here before
00:51 - so all i did was move that out into its
00:53 - own method called
00:54 - show tours and the reason i did this was
00:58 - so that we can trigger this method
01:00 - when the user actually makes a purchase
01:02 - and dismisses the view controller
01:05 - if you remember in the pro view
01:07 - controller
01:09 - when the purchase button is tapped and
01:12 - the user
01:13 - purchases that package before we only
01:15 - had this line here to dismiss
01:17 - the pro view controller and i was
01:19 - counting on the
01:21 - view will appear to trigger but that
01:23 - doesn't actually fire
01:24 - and so what i did was a quick and dirty
01:27 - way to
01:29 - fire this show tours method when a
01:32 - purchase happens and that is just to use
01:34 - notification center
01:35 - so i'm sending a notification called
01:37 - turn pro
01:39 - whenever the package is purchased and
01:41 - the user
01:42 - becomes pro and in the view controller
01:46 - up here i'm listening for that
01:48 - notification
01:49 - and when it detects that
01:52 - that notification is fired it's going to
01:54 - call show tours
01:56 - so that's how we can ensure that right
01:58 - after the purchasing
02:00 - that this code will run in addition to
02:04 - whenever the user relaunches the app
02:07 - this will fire and then it will also run
02:09 - the show tours code
02:11 - alright so now let's take a look at how
02:12 - to test all of this out
02:14 - so go to your app store connect portal
02:17 - and log
02:17 - in and then go to users and access
02:21 - on the left hand side you're going to
02:23 - see a bottom section called
02:25 - sandbox testers so go ahead and click
02:27 - that
02:28 - and this is where you can create a test
02:30 - apple id
02:32 - you're going to have to use an actual
02:34 - email address
02:35 - because you're able to log into the
02:38 - apple
02:39 - website with this account even though
02:41 - it's a test user
02:43 - it functions as a real apple id alright
02:46 - so go ahead and do that
02:47 - but remember which email address you
02:49 - used and what password you used as well
02:52 - now the next thing we're going to do is
02:54 - to launch our application
02:56 - on our actual device so plug in your
02:58 - actual device
03:02 - and then go ahead and launch the
03:04 - application
03:08 - all right so i've got it showing here
03:12 - so i'm going to hit the join pro tours
03:14 - button
03:16 - and we're going to see our in-app
03:18 - purchases here
03:19 - and i would suggest to test the one
03:22 - month
03:24 - button first and the reason for that um
03:27 - i'll get to in a second but let's go
03:29 - ahead and tap on this button
03:34 - so you can see that it pops up something
03:37 - kind of like the purchase confirmation
03:39 - screen that you would usually see
03:40 - except that notice it says environment
03:43 - sandbox
03:44 - and that's how you know that this is a
03:45 - test purchase
03:47 - there isn't going to be any money
03:49 - actually processed
03:50 - and also notice that it says plan
03:52 - automatically renews for
03:54 - 1349 and this is in my local currency
03:57 - even though
03:58 - if you remember in app store connect
04:00 - when we configured these in-app
04:01 - purchases
04:02 - it was 9.99 usd so that's why you don't
04:05 - want to put
04:06 - the actual price in the
04:09 - product name because if you did that it
04:12 - would say
04:13 - enter your password to subscribe to
04:14 - proaccess
04:16 - monthly 9.99 and then it would say plan
04:19 - automatically renews
04:21 - in my local currency and so it's really
04:23 - confusing and that's why
04:25 - we made special care not to put any
04:27 - pricing information or duration
04:29 - information into the product name and
04:31 - instead we dynamically
04:33 - uh generated this button string pro
04:36 - access one year you know 79.99
04:38 - in my local currency all right so here
04:41 - if you're doing this for the first time
04:42 - you're going to see
04:43 - an account and password text box and
04:47 - this is where you're
04:48 - going to enter your sandbox tester email
04:51 - and your sandbox tester password because
04:54 - i've done this before
04:56 - it's already logged in my sandbox tester
04:59 - and so all i have to do here is enter in
05:01 - my password
05:02 - so let's go ahead and do that and test
05:04 - this purchase
05:06 - all right i'm going to hit continue
05:10 - and then if there are any errors you can
05:11 - see in the
05:13 - debug information there alright so
05:15 - confirm
05:16 - subscription and click ok here
05:20 - and then you're all set and you can see
05:22 - it dismissed it and
05:24 - in the main view controller it received
05:26 - that notification
05:27 - and so it removed the button and it also
05:31 - you know changed the labels to reflect
05:33 - pro mode
05:34 - all right and now we're going to go over
05:36 - to the revenue cat side
05:38 - and if you go under
05:41 - you know your in your app here and you
05:44 - go
05:44 - over to overview and make sure you
05:48 - toggle this button
05:49 - to view sandbox data you can actually
05:52 - see active subscriptions here
05:56 - and you can actually see uh you know
06:00 - the the users that we have just
06:02 - purchased this product
06:04 - a few seconds ago and it expires
06:07 - in four minutes and it's counted as a
06:11 - renewal because i've used
06:12 - this sandbox tester before a little
06:15 - earlier to test this out so you can see
06:16 - this first
06:17 - initial purchase right was not a renewal
06:21 - but when you're testing in-app purchases
06:25 - all of the time frames are shortened so
06:28 - this is a one-month
06:29 - subscription but it is actually
06:33 - going to only last five minutes and in
06:36 - five minutes
06:37 - time that one month will have expired
06:40 - and it will
06:41 - renew and it's gonna do this a maximum
06:44 - of five times
06:45 - so that's why i recommended testing one
06:47 - month first
06:48 - so that the maximum duration you're
06:50 - going to have to wait is
06:51 - half an hour whereas if you tested one
06:54 - year
06:55 - one year equates to one hour then you're
06:57 - gonna have to wait six hours
06:59 - because it's gonna run you five times so
07:01 - you can see back in here
07:03 - that every five minutes it was
07:06 - it was purchasing right until
07:10 - until the fifth time where it stopped
07:14 - and that's where the subscription ended
07:17 - because
07:18 - this is a test uh a test subscription so
07:21 - it only renews five times
07:23 - um after that point uh when i launched
07:26 - the app
07:26 - it detected that i didn't have pro
07:28 - entitlements anymore so that's how you
07:30 - can test
07:31 - all the scenarios of your application
07:34 - unfortunately there isn't really a way
07:37 - to cancel
07:38 - the subscription of a test user you can
07:42 - see it
07:42 - in your settings of your phone so let me
07:45 - show you that
07:49 - so if you go to your settings
07:54 - and adren you're gonna have to blur some
07:55 - stuff out things you hit
07:57 - that and you go to itunes and app store
08:00 - and you can see my apple id is up there
08:03 - but if you scroll all the way to the
08:04 - bottom
08:05 - you'll see that there is a sandbox
08:07 - account
08:08 - section with my sandbox account email
08:11 - now take special note that you will not
08:14 - be able to see this section uh the
08:17 - sandbox section
08:18 - unless you have um made that purchase
08:22 - and logged in with your test user at
08:24 - least
08:24 - once because i was looking for this
08:26 - section before and
08:28 - it didn't exist and it wasn't until i
08:30 - made a purchase i logged in as my test
08:33 - user
08:33 - and i made that first purchase that then
08:36 - i see this section here
08:38 - and from what i've been reading in ios
08:40 - 14
08:41 - if your device is already running that
08:43 - uh
08:44 - you're going to be able to actually
08:46 - cancel this test subscription in your
08:48 - sandbox account for me
08:49 - i'm still currently on ios 13 so i am
08:52 - not able to do that
08:53 - but it will renew and expire
08:56 - in a matter of minutes too so while my
08:59 - subscription is live
09:02 - and let's say we just reboot the app on
09:04 - our device here
09:08 - oops not the simulator but my actual
09:11 - device
09:11 - you can see that when the app launches
09:14 - it's already detected that
09:17 - i have the pro entitlement and so it's
09:19 - showing me the tours right away
09:21 - and not the pro button but if we wait
09:24 - long enough
09:25 - if we wait 30 minutes when it reaches
09:27 - the maximum
09:28 - amount of renewals and essentially the
09:30 - subscription ends
09:32 - you're going to be able to launch the
09:33 - app and you're going to see that this
09:35 - user won't
09:36 - have the pro entitlement anymore and
09:37 - they'll see the pro button again and
09:39 - then you can go through that
09:40 - test purchase flow once again so that's
09:43 - how easy it is to test your revenue cat
09:45 - in-app subscription
09:47 - integration on an actual device
09:50 - in this revenue cat series you've seen
09:52 - how to configure your in-app purchases
09:54 - in app store connect how to organize
09:57 - your products offers and entitlements on
09:59 - the revenue cad side
10:00 - you've also learned how to integrate
10:02 - that revenue sdk into your xcode project
10:04 - so that you can easily display your
10:06 - in-app purchases
10:07 - process purchases from the user and to
10:10 - check their level of access
10:12 - and now you know how to test your
10:13 - implementation as well
10:15 - now there's a lot more that revenuecad
10:17 - can do including experimenting with
10:19 - offers and diving deep into analytics
