00:00 - hey guys it's Chris here I'm back with
00:02 - another video from my course and this
00:05 - one deals with how to troubleshoot some
00:08 - landscape orientation layout issues as
00:12 - well as some issues with checking some
00:14 - text fields for empty empty text fields
00:17 - before submitting data to our database
00:20 - before I jump into that lesson I just
00:23 - want to mention one thing and that is
00:25 - that I'm not posting these videos from
00:29 - my course to my youtube channel to
00:31 - entice you guys to join the course it's
00:34 - just that I've been working on the
00:36 - course and I haven't had that much time
00:38 - to produce new YouTube content and I
00:39 - don't want to leave you guys hanging so
00:42 - I genuinely think that what I'm teaching
00:46 - in this course lesson is applicable and
00:49 - helpful for you guys as well and so
00:50 - that's why I'm posting here so don't
00:52 - there's no hidden agenda I think that
00:55 - most of you already know that I do have
00:57 - a course on my site and I've been
00:59 - running it for three years so it's
01:00 - nothing new this is a bit of a new
01:02 - content some new modules for the course
01:05 - and I recognize the courses aren't for
01:08 - everybody so don't be scared that now
01:10 - I'm only focusing on the courses and not
01:12 - YouTube that's not the case I do have a
01:14 - lot of content planned for the YouTube
01:16 - channel coming up it's just that I want
01:18 - to finish off the course first and I
01:21 - don't want to have a dry spell on my
01:23 - YouTube channel so I'm posting some
01:24 - stuff from the course here and I hope
01:26 - you guys can appreciate that and I hope
01:28 - that it's helpful for you guys too okay
01:30 - so now on to the video
01:34 - [Music]
01:38 - this video is going to be talking about
01:41 - the landscape view for our guidebook app
01:43 - and you can go to you can rotate the
01:46 - simulator by holding down command and
01:48 - pressing left or right you can notice
01:51 - immediately that the images in the back
01:53 - of the cells they're stretched with
01:55 - twice so that's going to be a pretty
01:57 - easy fix other than that the scrolls
02:01 - fine let's check out the map there's our
02:04 - map that works fine as well let me jump
02:11 - back to places let's go into one of
02:12 - these guys now it's going to harvest and
02:16 - you'll notice that the image kind of
02:19 - overflows its boundaries so we're going
02:21 - to have to set the clipping for that so
02:25 - it doesn't overflow and maybe adjust the
02:27 - content mode as well for that to
02:29 - reposition it and this description is
02:34 - fine the reviews these reviews are fine
02:37 - I guess there's some empty ones here
02:39 - which now that I'm reminded it to do
02:42 - that we have to prevent people from
02:44 - submitting empty reviews and let's write
02:47 - a review this guy is a problem because
02:50 - there's not enough space for it so let's
02:53 - go ahead and address these problems one
02:55 - by one first of all we're going to jump
02:58 - into the storyboard and for the
03:00 - uiimageview here I'm just going to set
03:04 - the content mode by default of scale to
03:06 - fill and I'm going to change it to a
03:09 - spec to fill that's going to correct
03:10 - that problem of the stretching now
03:13 - moving on to the detail view controller
03:17 - here if we take a look at the this is
03:22 - the cell image view right see content
03:27 - view weight looking at the wrong thing
03:29 - here so down here in the document
03:34 - outline this is the place
03:35 - image view this is the top half view
03:39 - here what we can do actually is we can
03:42 - set for the top half view can set clip
03:45 - to bounce and what that's going to do
03:48 - because the image view is inside of it
03:50 - if
03:51 - not going to show that overflow it's
03:54 - actually going to clip that so let's
03:56 - quickly run our app and take a look at
03:59 - our two changes there okay so right away
04:05 - you can see that these are no longer
04:06 - stretched and now you can see that it
04:12 - also doesn't overflow
04:14 - okay so let's address this one here this
04:17 - problem of there not being enough space
04:20 - for this child view controller right now
04:22 - this top path is half the screen and
04:25 - this bottom half from this purple line
04:27 - downwards is the second half of the
04:30 - screen while this works beautifully you
04:33 - know for a profile view it's again half
04:36 - and half it doesn't work so well for a
04:39 - landscape view so what we can do is
04:43 - specifically for the landscape view
04:45 - change it so that we do maybe 25% for
04:50 - the top and like 75% for the bottom you
04:53 - know just a different ratio so we give
04:56 - ourselves more space on the bottom ok so
05:00 - now let's go back into our storyboard
05:01 - and do some cool stuff with the
05:03 - constraints and take a look at which
05:07 - constraint we have to modify here this
05:10 - one bottom half equals the top half for
05:14 - the width note that's not the one we
05:16 - want we want the height one so this one
05:18 - is bottom half the height is equal to
05:21 - the top half height and by making them
05:24 - equal they will be 50/50 right now this
05:28 - multiplier is the the value that I want
05:32 - to change for the landscape orientation
05:35 - so what I can do is I can pull this up
05:38 - here this tray here which is dictating
05:43 - what size class we're looking at if we
05:46 - tap on this landscape icon right here
05:48 - it's going to change the size class so
05:51 - you can see this is compact width and
05:53 - compact height if I go back to the
05:56 - portrait see this is a compact width and
06:00 - regular height so let's switch it to the
06:03 - landscape one
06:05 - and for that same constraint that I have
06:08 - highlighted here bottom half height is
06:12 - equal to top half height what I want you
06:14 - to notice for these constraints that we
06:17 - have here is here
06:19 - it has this check mark beside installed
06:22 - and that is basically saying that these
06:24 - constraints are installed for any size
06:27 - clause so no matter what device
06:28 - what orientation this constraint exists
06:33 - what we want to do is we want to let me
06:36 - just get that constraint back here what
06:42 - we want to do is we want to specifically
06:45 - install a constraint for this size class
06:47 - compact within compact height so how you
06:50 - can do that is you can click this button
06:52 - very first traits and you can say that I
06:56 - want to install straits based on both
07:02 - the width and the height and it's going
07:04 - to take the size class that you're
07:06 - viewing so I'm viewing the landscape one
07:08 - which is compact click on back type so
07:11 - instantly this bottom part turns blue
07:13 - and now whenever I'm working with
07:16 - constraints it's going to install it
07:19 - specifically for this size class rather
07:22 - than for everything so I'm going to
07:25 - highlight that constraint that we're
07:27 - looking at that equates the two halves
07:31 - for equal height and I'm going to click
07:33 - this plus icon and I'm going to add this
07:38 - variation for compact with compact
07:40 - height and I'm going to add this
07:42 - variation down here and I'm going to
07:44 - uncheck installed so that it's not so
07:50 - that this variation that I'm about to do
07:52 - is only installed for the combat with
07:54 - combat height and I'm going to change
07:57 - this multiplier here so for the bottom
08:00 - half equal to the top half I'm going to
08:03 - put a multiplier of two and that's going
08:07 - to basically say the bottom half site
08:09 - should be two times greater than the top
08:12 - half height now if for some reason in
08:15 - your project and you might have this
08:17 - reversed you might have the top
08:18 - half equals the bottom half in that case
08:21 - you would want the top half to be equal
08:23 - to 0.5 times the bottom I hope you
08:29 - understand what I'm saying this
08:31 - constraint is basically setting the
08:35 - first item so if you have the first item
08:38 - as the bottom half like I do I want the
08:42 - bottom half to be two times larger than
08:45 - the top half right that's going to give
08:46 - me more space in the bottom half however
08:49 - if you have the first item as the top
08:51 - half then you're basically specifying
08:54 - the height for the top half so you would
08:56 - say I want the top has to be half as big
08:59 - as the bottom half height so that's why
09:02 - you put 0.5 if your first item is top
09:05 - half and if your first item is bottom
09:07 - half you would put 2 and effectively
09:10 - that would give you a proportion like
09:12 - this where the bottom half is 2 times
09:14 - greater than the top path and again this
09:17 - is only installed for this size class
09:19 - which is this landscape size class so
09:22 - I'm going to click done varying now and
09:24 - I want to make sure that when I go back
09:27 - to the portrait view right that you can
09:32 - see that constraint which I modified now
09:35 - is greyed out why is it grayed out
09:37 - because you can see it's only installed
09:40 - for compact height and compact width and
09:42 - now I am looking at the compact width
09:47 - and regular height size clause so what I
09:49 - want to do now is I can very for traits
09:54 - again based on the width and the height
09:56 - and now I can create a new constraint
10:00 - for the two halves so hold down control
10:06 - drag from the bottom half to the top
10:08 - half and let's check this one equal
10:11 - Heights so taking a look at this new
10:15 - constraint that popped up you can see
10:17 - this one is only installed for compact
10:21 - width and regular height and this one
10:23 - says the bottom half should be equal to
10:26 - the top half making them 50/50
10:29 - now I'm going to click done varying now
10:33 - when I click the landscape one see it
10:35 - uses the other constraint which is only
10:38 - installed for this guy and it gives more
10:41 - room for the while if I go back to the
10:43 - portrait it uses the other constraint
10:46 - which makes them equal house and this is
10:50 - going to give me more space for that
10:54 - write reviews child view controller so
10:56 - let's run the project okay so you can
11:05 - see here now that I can actually write
11:12 - in the text fields now while I was
11:15 - working on this one of the things that
11:17 - really bothered me especially in the
11:19 - landscape view because you don't have
11:21 - much space is tapping on an empty area
11:23 - to dismiss the keyboard I did this a lot
11:27 - I actually tapped this area because this
11:28 - is the biggest empty area you can tap
11:30 - and looks empty
11:32 - although the button is actually this
11:34 - full width so I would tap on this empty
11:36 - area thinking that I just want to
11:38 - dismiss the keyboard but I would
11:40 - actually submit the review so I found
11:42 - that really annoying and that is
11:44 - probably bad bad design on my part so
11:48 - I'm actually going to color this button
11:51 - give it a background so you can see
11:56 - where it starts and where it ends so I'm
11:58 - just going to click this submit button
12:00 - here and quickly change that background
12:03 - color I'm going to give it this gray
12:05 - color but at the same time I want to
12:08 - make it kind of have rounded rounded
12:11 - edges because these text fields also
12:14 - have rounded edges so let me just double
12:16 - check in the right reviews
12:19 - child ooh controller yeah we do have an
12:21 - outlet for that submit button so I'm
12:23 - just going to and button set it right
12:28 - here submit button layer dot corner
12:32 - radius equals five point zero okay so
12:35 - now let's work on this to do here submit
12:40 - tap check that the text field text video
12:42 - are
12:42 - empty and I'm going to just throw up an
12:47 - alert if they are empty and exit this
12:49 - function if they try to submit kind of
12:53 - an empty text field or text view so
12:57 - let's say I can check it like this if
13:01 - name text field text you can see that
13:03 - this is an optional one right so if I
13:07 - can if I say it's either nil or maybe
13:10 - name text field oops
13:14 - double equal remember so if it's nil or
13:20 - if it's completely empty then return to
13:26 - do show and alert however this only
13:32 - checks if the text field hasn't then
13:36 - basically doesn't have any white space
13:39 - in it or is completely empty string if
13:41 - they for some reason go in the text
13:44 - field and they start pressing spacebar
13:47 - like that
13:48 - this isn't going to capture that so what
13:52 - we must do is actually take this text
13:56 - and we need to strip out all white
13:59 - spaces and then check if it's empty
14:02 - string and you can actually do that
14:04 - pretty easily using some built-in
14:06 - functions so you can go trimming
14:10 - characters here and in the character set
14:14 - you can type in character set dot white
14:19 - spaces and new lines and that is going
14:22 - to take that text field and it's going
14:25 - to trim out all the white space and then
14:27 - compare it to that okay so I'm just
14:32 - press ENTER there and we're going to
14:36 - check if the Revue textview dot text and
14:43 - you'll notice that this one is not
14:44 - optional here right so there will be
14:47 - something in it so I'm just going to
14:50 - check it for that
14:52 - and again we're going to have to trim it
14:55 - for the character set dot white spaces
14:59 - and new lines so those are the three
15:01 - things that we are going to check in if
15:04 - any of them are empty we're going to
15:07 - show an alert so let's quickly drum up
15:10 - an alert here I don't like using the
15:20 - word error I'm just going to say almost
15:24 - there please double check that you've
15:34 - filled in the name and the review fields
15:41 - and for the style we're just going to
15:45 - have this as an alert and we're going to
15:47 - have to add an action to it so the user
15:50 - can dismiss the alert so let action
15:53 - equals UI alert action okay style is
16:00 - default handlers
16:02 - no and then we're going to add the
16:06 - action to the alert add action
16:16 - create another and action so be alert so
16:26 - I'm going to use present we're going to
16:30 - present the alert
16:31 - let's have true for the animated and
16:34 - nothing for the completion and then this
16:38 - is key because we want to get out of
16:42 - this function after this point so that
16:45 - we don't actually save the review to
16:47 - firebase so let's try this out here okay
17:01 - so see even if I put some spaces in here
17:03 - I try to click submit you can see that
17:07 - it doesn't allow me to do it it doesn't
17:12 - allow me to do it so anyways that's
17:15 - great one more thing that I want to
17:18 - address is this right here it looks kind
17:22 - of strange you know it's functional but
17:24 - it doesn't look centered you know write
17:26 - a review should probably in the B in the
17:28 - middle there in description should be in
17:29 - the middle so I'm going to show you how
17:33 - to vary that as well and it's actually
17:36 - easier than what we had to do for the
17:40 - other one okay so we're looking at the
17:46 - detail view controller again and you can
17:50 - see here that this nav button stack is
17:54 - is what we need to change right if I go
17:59 - into the landscape orientation here you
18:05 - can see that it does look that that kind
18:09 - of strange spaced out look that it's got
18:12 - going on what we need to change is we
18:18 - had a constraint here for the width of
18:21 - the nav button stack
18:24 - you can see here that we are saying this
18:26 - constraint is saying actually the nav
18:28 - button stack width is equal to the
18:31 - bottom half width minus a constant of 40
18:37 - and that is going to take 20 from the
18:41 - left 20 from the right what we want to
18:44 - change for the landscape specifically is
18:47 - to change this constant to maybe
18:49 - something like 150 so I was playing
18:53 - around with these numbers and you know
18:55 - 150 or 140 seems about right to me right
19:03 - now it is just minus 40 so negative 40
19:07 - so what we can do is again we can vary
19:10 - four traits so this is the constraint in
19:16 - question let's vary four traits based on
19:20 - the height and the width because I am
19:21 - looking at the landscape right now and
19:23 - this time I'm going to add a variation
19:27 - for the constant here so I'm going to
19:29 - click plus and this is just double check
19:34 - that compact compact at that and I'm
19:37 - going to change that for negative 140
19:41 - and I'm going to click done varying now
19:44 - so you can see that when I go into
19:48 - portrait mode it's going to basically
19:52 - use this constant for everything but if
19:54 - I'm in this size class compact width
19:59 - compact height it's going to use this so
20:02 - my constraint is installed for
20:04 - everything right I didn't have to change
20:07 - this part I was able to add a specific
20:11 - variation for the constant property of
20:15 - my constraint which is really cool the
20:17 - reason why we couldn't do that with the
20:19 - other constraint you see here this
20:24 - bottom half equalled the top half
20:26 - constraint we we didn't we couldn't do
20:30 - that we have to create a separate
20:31 - constraint and kind of make this one
20:34 - only installed for this one because the
20:35 - multiplier which we wanted to vary
20:38 - doesn't have that ability to create a
20:40 - variation for that property whereas the
20:43 - constant does so with this nav button
20:47 - stack it's a lot easier to do and just
20:50 - create a variation for that specific
20:52 - constant you don't have to create a new
20:53 - constraint all right so see looks like
20:59 - that and then if I go back into portrait
21:04 - mode looks like that okay so I hope that
21:07 - was helpful and I'll see you guys in the
21:09 - next lesson bye for now
