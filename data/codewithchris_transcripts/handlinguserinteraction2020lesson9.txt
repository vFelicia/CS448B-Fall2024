00:00 - hi welcome to lesson 9 this is a fun
00:02 - lesson we're going to make the card
00:04 - images change when we click on the deal
00:06 - button so if you're ready let's jump
00:08 - right in so here I've got our war card
00:16 - game Xcode project I'm looking at the
00:18 - storyboard and I'm going to go ahead and
00:20 - select that left image view now in the
00:23 - attributes inspector on the right hand
00:25 - side I'm gonna go to this image property
00:28 - and I'm just going to change it to a
00:30 - different graphic asset by choosing
00:32 - something different in this drop-down
00:34 - remember that what we're doing here is
00:37 - just an easy visual way to do the same
00:40 - thing that we could do through code so
00:43 - essentially what I'm changing up this
00:45 - image I set I am really just assigning a
00:48 - different graphic asset to the image
00:51 - property of this image view object now
00:56 - let's jump into our view controller and
00:57 - see how we can do that through code just
01:00 - as a reminder we have references to
01:03 - those image view objects right we have
01:06 - the left image view in the right image
01:08 - view I want you to also note that the
01:12 - type you know the class is uiimageview
01:16 - okay that is for displaying images let's
01:19 - jump down to the deal tapped method here
01:22 - let's erase this line and let's access
01:24 - our left image view using dot notation
01:29 - we're going to access the image property
01:31 - so hit dot type image and this is the
01:36 - same image property we were just
01:37 - flipping around in the storyboard you
01:39 - know changing that graphic asset so to
01:42 - do the same thing through code we would
01:44 - just assign you know a different graphic
01:48 - asset to this image property of the
01:50 - image view I want to draw your attention
01:52 - to one thing here on the left hand the
01:56 - column right here we can see the
01:57 - datatype that this property expects so
02:01 - this image property expects you to
02:04 - assign to it a UI image object this is
02:09 - different from UI image view UI image
02:12 - view
02:13 - is a element that displays UI image data
02:18 - and UI image is the data that represents
02:20 - the actual graphic assets so essentially
02:23 - what we have to do here is we have to
02:25 - create a new UI image object and assign
02:28 - it to this image property so let's just
02:34 - do it and you will probably make a lot
02:36 - more sense than me just explaining it
02:38 - like this alright so go ahead hit equals
02:41 - and then we're going to create a brand
02:43 - new UI image object now keep in mind
02:47 - that you have to type it exactly how I
02:49 - have it right here cuz class names lower
02:52 - case and upper case do matter so it
02:54 - needs to be capital u capital i capital
02:57 - i' and then lower case m a GE same thing
03:01 - goes for these property names it has to
03:03 - be lowercase i image so when you're
03:05 - watching me type this stuff out and
03:07 - you're getting errors on your own laptop
03:09 - or a computer make sure that you're
03:11 - typing the right casing for your
03:15 - property names and your class names also
03:17 - another mistake I've seen is that you
03:20 - have to have spaces like proper spacing
03:24 - so make sure that you have a space
03:26 - before and after equal signs because you
03:29 - know this is not the same thing alright
03:33 - so what we've done here is we've created
03:36 - a brand new UI image object and we're
03:40 - assigning it to the image property of
03:42 - the image view however if we do this
03:45 - we're really not going to see anything
03:47 - because this is just an empty UI image
03:50 - object it doesn't actually have any
03:52 - image data to show so the cool thing
03:55 - about this UI image class is that it's
03:58 - got a method where you can create a new
04:02 - UI image object while passing in some
04:05 - input parameter to tell what sort of
04:08 - graphic asset you want it to represent
04:10 - so let me show you let me show you what
04:14 - that is so I'm gonna open up a pair I'm
04:17 - going to open up the first rounded
04:19 - bracket and you can see all of these
04:20 - different functions and scroll down
04:24 - or this one find this one called named
04:27 - right here and we are going to simply
04:32 - use that one here as enter and we're
04:38 - going to be able to specify a graphic
04:41 - asset name now we're going to choose one
04:44 - of the ones in here
04:45 - take a note how you're spelling this if
04:48 - you've just dragged my graphic assets in
04:51 - here then they should be lowercase C
04:53 - with no space in between the D and the
04:57 - number so let's say card five lowercase
05:00 - C a Rd with the number five it has to be
05:03 - exactly like that otherwise it's not
05:05 - going to find that graphic asset we're
05:07 - going to type card five like that so why
05:10 - don't we run our project right now just
05:13 - to see that appear all right so right
05:19 - now it's a three in a tent when I click
05:20 - deal it's going to execute this function
05:24 - here and it's going to set it's going to
05:28 - create a new UI image object grabbing
05:31 - the graphic asset here and then it's
05:33 - going to assign that to the image
05:34 - property of the left image view object
05:37 - which is this guy right here so clicking
05:39 - deal there that turns into a five which
05:41 - is really really cool because that's the
05:43 - first time I think where you wrote code
05:45 - to influence what happens in the user
05:48 - interface so awesome now we're going to
05:51 - do the same thing for the right image
05:53 - view right image view dot image is equal
05:56 - to UI image right and we're gonna just
06:01 - you can actually start typing and it's
06:04 - going to narrow it down for you so you
06:06 - can choose that this time I'm going to
06:08 - choose card
06:09 - I think our upper limit is 14 if I'm not
06:13 - mistaken yeah so we've got up to card 14
06:17 - all right so I'm gonna run that and this
06:22 - time let me just put the code on the
06:25 - screen here this time when I click on
06:27 - deal we have the ACE on the right-hand
06:30 - side and number 5 now if I click on deal
06:35 - again nothing's gonna change because
06:36 - it's always just
06:37 - running the same code right we need to
06:39 - basically randomize these numbers so
06:42 - that every time we click deal we get a
06:44 - different set of cards so let me tell
06:46 - you about how to generate random numbers
06:48 - it's actually quite easy so we're going
06:51 - to declare a new constant let's call
06:53 - this like left number and you know the
07:00 - int data type it's actually got a method
07:03 - called random that we can use right and
07:07 - we can specify a range and we can say
07:11 - the lower range that we have let's see
07:14 - is two and the upper range is 14 so we
07:17 - want to specify a range between 2 to 14
07:20 - inclusive we're going to go here and
07:22 - we're gonna type - dot dot dot 14 no
07:27 - spaces like that and we are going to
07:31 - then print the left number all right now
07:35 - let's do the same thing with right
07:37 - number we're going to randomize another
07:41 - one same thing 2 to 14 and then we're
07:45 - going to print the right number
07:48 - so after you've typed that in let's run
07:51 - our project it's not going to change the
07:53 - images just yet but it is going to print
07:55 - the random numbers to the console just
07:57 - so we can see that we're doing this
07:59 - properly and move this over here so we
08:01 - can see and I click the deal button oops
08:03 - that's still covering it up oh oh right
08:08 - here I've got that little panel hidden
08:11 - so click on this if it's hidden for you
08:13 - there we go
08:17 - you can see different pairs of random
08:20 - numbers generated now the next step is
08:23 - how do we get these numbers into here
08:28 - well all we have to do actually first
08:32 - thing is let's comment these lines out
08:35 - so we're not printing them out into the
08:36 - console and I would also want to point
08:40 - out that when you're calling taking out
08:43 - lines of code like this make sure that
08:45 - you clean it up after when you don't
08:47 - need it anymore
08:47 - so you don't want to leave too much
08:49 - common too
08:50 - code lying around because it can look
08:52 - messy and it's not a good practice to
08:55 - keep okay so remember what we what we
09:00 - learned about inserting variables into
09:03 - strings so it goes back to that instead
09:05 - of five here we want to put left number
09:09 - so I'm going to erase five
09:11 - I'm raised five put back slash open up a
09:15 - pair of rounded brackets and insert left
09:17 - number as a variable right so the string
09:21 - is going to read card and then whatever
09:23 - left number is now I'm gonna do the same
09:26 - thing here you raise 14 backslash put
09:30 - into round the brackets and I'm gonna
09:32 - put right number all right so let's
09:36 - erase these print statements I don't
09:38 - think we need that anymore okay so let's
09:43 - run our project here see if we get the
09:48 - desired result let's go ahead and click
09:53 - on deal so yeah this is really cool now
09:56 - one thing I want to point out is that if
09:58 - you are clicking this you're randomizing
10:00 - the cards and you're seeing some blank
10:01 - space like you're seeing a card that's
10:03 - just completely not there what that
10:06 - means is that it's looking for a graphic
10:10 - asset that doesn't exist in your asset
10:13 - library so maybe you're double check
10:16 - your range make sure that you know you
10:19 - have cards 2 to 14 and make sure that
10:22 - they're named properly and maybe you
10:24 - might be even be missing that graphic
10:26 - asset completely so check you have two
10:28 - three four five six let's check that you
10:30 - have all of them because if you're
10:32 - randomizing and you see an empty card
10:34 - you don't see the image it either means
10:37 - that you don't have the graphic asset
10:40 - here or you've spelled it wrong so that
10:44 - you know when you're trying to create
10:46 - this UI image object it's not finding
10:48 - that graphic asset in your asset library
10:51 - oh hey I can't stop hitting this deal
10:55 - button now in this lesson you learned
10:57 - about how to change the image of a UI
10:59 - image view using Swift code you also
11:02 - learned
11:03 - how to randomize numbers and how to
11:05 - insert variables into a string now how
11:07 - they recommend that you download the
11:09 - recap notes by clicking on that card
11:10 - over there or in the description below
11:12 - and don't forget to subscribe if you
11:14 - like this video hit that Bell icon too
11:16 - and then click on the thumbnail over
11:18 - there for the next lesson and I'll see
11:19 - you there
