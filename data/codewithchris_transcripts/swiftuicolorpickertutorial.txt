00:00 - hi it's Chris here and in this tutorial
00:02 - I'm going to show you how to implement a
00:04 - Color Picker in Swift UI it's actually
00:06 - really really simple so here I have a
00:10 - basic uh xcode project brand new project
00:13 - nothing special about it I am going to
00:15 - remove the image and the
00:17 - text and we are going to use the Color
00:20 - Picker component to be honest I didn't
00:22 - even know that this was a
00:25 - thing so here you can add a string uh as
00:29 - a call to action for what the user
00:31 - should do so how
00:35 - about like that the other thing you need
00:38 - is a binding to a color property so
00:41 - we're going to create a state property
00:43 - up here which is going to hold the
00:46 - selected color that the user selects as
00:49 - well as an initial default color so
00:52 - let's call
00:53 - this selected
00:55 - color and we're going to default it to
00:58 - Blue and now we can set it by to
01:02 - it and just like that if you take a look
01:05 - at the preview we get this functionality
01:08 - if you tap on it you get a Color Picker
01:12 - you look at that it's pretty full
01:14 - featured you can get this for free we
01:17 - barely had to do anything to get this
01:20 - functionality oh and one quick thing if
01:22 - you want to download the sample code for
01:23 - this we've got it all in a single handy
01:26 - exco project in fact it contains a
01:28 - sample code for all of this Swift UI
01:30 - components so that you can learn from it
01:32 - or copy and paste the code into your own
01:34 - project just visit
01:37 - cc. Swift ui- kit it's a free download
01:41 - I'll leave it in the description below
01:43 - the video too all right now back to the
01:44 - tutorial and after you select the color
01:47 - and you close it that selected color
01:50 - will be in this state property so why
01:52 - don't we put it into a rectangle just to
01:55 - show how to access it
02:06 - and I'm going to set the foreground
02:07 - color to the selected color so let's go
02:11 - and choose different color there you go
02:14 - that's how easy it is to implement a
02:17 - Color Picker in Swift UI so for more
