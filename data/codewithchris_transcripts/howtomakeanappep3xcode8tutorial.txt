00:05 - hello welcome to lesson three of how to
00:08 - make iphone apps with no programming
00:09 - experience in this lesson I'm going to
00:12 - give you a walkthrough of the Xcode 8
00:15 - application and this is going to be very
00:17 - useful for you because we're going to be
00:19 - spending a lot of time in Xcode building
00:21 - our applications now again I'm using
00:24 - Xcode 8 beta but by the time this video
00:27 - comes out or shortly after Xcode 8 will
00:30 - officially be available in the Mac App
00:32 - Store in the previous lesson we had used
00:35 - a playground to dabble in some Swift
00:38 - code well this time we're going to
00:39 - create a brand new Xcode project this
00:42 - one right here if you don't have this
00:44 - welcome screen you can always go up to
00:46 - file new and project like that and it's
00:51 - going to ask you what type of project
00:52 - you want to create you can see here that
00:56 - you can create a game master detail
00:58 - application page based application and
01:00 - so on but we're going to start with a
01:02 - single view application and this is
01:04 - going to be your basic application with
01:06 - just a single screen that doesn't mean
01:08 - that you can create any of these other
01:10 - types of apps but if you work to create
01:13 - an app that was more suited for this
01:15 - type of structure it just gets you
01:16 - started in the right place but even if
01:18 - you start with a single view application
01:20 - you can still get to these places and
01:22 - for the purposes of this walkthrough
01:25 - I'll be using a single view application
01:27 - make sure that you're under iOS though
01:30 - because there's other types of
01:33 - applications you can build with Xcode so
01:36 - under iOS single view application and
01:39 - here it's just a single view this may be
01:42 - a Xcode 8 bug but it should say single
01:46 - view application so for my product name
01:49 - I'm just going to call it it doesn't
01:51 - matter what we call it actually at this
01:52 - point I'm going to call it Xcode tour
01:54 - and you may not have a team under this
01:57 - drop-down don't worry about that
01:59 - organization name you can just put your
02:02 - name unless you have a company you can
02:05 - put that and the identifier usually is
02:08 - comm dot followed by your organization
02:11 - name
02:13 - and it's going to automatically upend
02:15 - your product name to it to create a
02:18 - unique identifier for this application
02:19 - now this part is very important make
02:22 - sure under language you choose swift we
02:24 - do not want to work with Objective C at
02:27 - least not in this video so we're working
02:29 - with Swift device you can leave as
02:31 - iPhone here and all of these I've left
02:34 - unchecked so uncheck them if they are
02:36 - checked click Next and we're going to
02:40 - I'm going to save it on the desktop but
02:42 - you can save it wherever you see fit and
02:45 - under source control here I have this
02:48 - unchecked okay we can go through that in
02:51 - the future but for now let's create our
02:53 - project so right now we have a brand new
02:57 - basic app project and with this I'm
03:00 - going to show you the main areas of
03:01 - Xcode now right off the bat you're going
03:04 - to notice that Xcode is separated into
03:06 - four major regions first of all you have
03:09 - this tab bar at the top and kind of
03:12 - similarly to the playground that we used
03:14 - in the last lesson there's a little
03:17 - status indicator here telling you what
03:19 - the project or what Xcode is doing
03:21 - currently right now it's at the ready
03:23 - it's not processing or loading anything
03:26 - you've got this play button icon
03:28 - similarly to what you saw in the
03:30 - playground and when you press this it's
03:32 - going to run your project in the Xcode
03:34 - simulator we're going to see in a quick
03:36 - second and then here you can actually
03:38 - choose different types of simulators
03:41 - we're going to do that in a quick second
03:43 - but before we do that let me show you
03:45 - the other three major regions on the
03:48 - leftmost side you have your file
03:49 - Navigator and here you can browse
03:51 - through the different files of your
03:53 - project you can see here we've got a
03:55 - couple of them take note that this
03:58 - actually these are tabs they just look
04:01 - like icons but you can actually click
04:03 - these in their different tabs by far
04:06 - we'll be using this file navigator tab
04:08 - the most now the middle region is your
04:11 - largest region because that's where
04:12 - you're going to be doing most of your
04:13 - editing whether that's code or the user
04:16 - interface or project settings and this
04:19 - is called the code editor area and this
04:22 - area changes depending on which file you
04:25 - have selected
04:26 - right here we have Xcode our root node
04:29 - selected and right here we see our
04:32 - project properties so we can modify some
04:34 - attributes of our project but if you
04:37 - select the code file so let's say I
04:39 - select view control a lot swift you can
04:41 - see that this code editor region changes
04:43 - to as you would expect a place for you
04:46 - to edit code now if I select may not
04:50 - storyboard this middle region changes to
04:53 - what is called interface builder and
04:55 - it's going to allow us to visually
04:58 - design our our app in our view moving on
05:03 - we've got assets dot exe assets and here
05:06 - you don't see much right now but this is
05:08 - actually the asset library for your app
05:11 - and here you're going to add all of the
05:12 - graphics for your app and you're going
05:14 - to be able to give them metadata such as
05:17 - modify the names and the sizes and stuff
05:20 - like that so that you can use them in
05:22 - your project so quickly going through
05:24 - the last two files launch screen dot
05:26 - storyboard is another interface builder
05:28 - file that lets you modify the launch
05:30 - screen for your app and info.plist is
05:33 - another sort of configuration file for
05:36 - your app and this is another view where
05:39 - you can add new key value pairs or
05:42 - simply attributes to configure your app
05:44 - or you can modify the existing ones
05:46 - don't worry about this too much right
05:48 - now I know it might look confusing we
05:50 - won't spend very much time in this file
05:51 - at all so I want to go back to the
05:56 - storyboard or interface builder because
05:58 - I want to show you on this right-hand
06:00 - pane what this is all about so you know
06:03 - how I said this middle region changes
06:06 - depending on what you select from the
06:07 - file navigator
06:08 - well this rightmost pane changes as well
06:11 - depending on what you select in this
06:13 - middle region this pane is actually
06:16 - separated into two panes the top half
06:19 - actually it's not half it's about 75%
06:22 - because it comes from here all the way
06:24 - down to this part it's called the
06:26 - attributes inspector and it also has a
06:29 - couple of tabs as you can see here so
06:32 - what happens is when you're building
06:35 - your layout visually let's say I've got
06:39 - a button
06:40 - and I want to modify well if I highlight
06:41 - and select the button in this visual
06:44 - interface builder this attributes
06:46 - inspector is going to show me the
06:47 - attributes for that button and I'm going
06:49 - to be able to modify the properties for
06:51 - that button to configure things like
06:53 - size color text stuff like that and down
06:57 - here on the bottom right half of the
07:00 - screen I've also got a couple of tabs
07:02 - this is called the library pane and most
07:05 - of the time we're going to be working
07:07 - with these library objects here on this
07:10 - tab take note that there are two types
07:13 - of views that you can have for a library
07:15 - pane you can click this button to go to
07:18 - this sort of view but I find that this
07:21 - ListView is a lot more helpful because
07:23 - it has the name of the element so if
07:25 - you're not used to what the icons
07:26 - represent yet you should stick with this
07:29 - ListView so let's do a quick
07:31 - demonstration down here there's a filter
07:34 - box I can type in button I'm going to
07:38 - click and drag this button from the
07:41 - library pane onto my interface builder
07:43 - storyboard view so I am going to do that
07:48 - you see the button there in my view if I
07:51 - tap on that button you can see here on
07:53 - the upper right hand side that it shows
07:55 - me the attributes for that button and I
07:57 - can change stuff like the text for it I
07:59 - can call it my button and I can change
08:05 - things like the type of font it uses the
08:07 - font size the color and so on so one
08:10 - thing that you might run into if you
08:12 - have a small screen size let's say
08:14 - you're working on your laptop and you
08:17 - don't need all of these panes at once
08:19 - you can use these buttons up here to
08:22 - hide and show different panes so you can
08:25 - see that I can click this button hides
08:28 - in shows the utilities pane that's the
08:31 - name for this whole thing I can press
08:34 - this one and it will hide the file
08:36 - navigator pane and there's an a fourth
08:40 - area that we haven't seen yet and that's
08:43 - this button here that brings up this
08:45 - bottom pane it's kind of like the in our
08:48 - playground in the last lesson where we
08:50 - saw the output
08:53 - well when we're building our app if
08:55 - there are any problems when running our
08:57 - app chances are there's going to be some
08:59 - error messages that show up here and
09:00 - similarly we can write code to output or
09:03 - print as you saw in the previous lesson
09:05 - to print out different variables or
09:08 - print out different statuses that would
09:11 - give us an indication of how the project
09:13 - is running this is helpful when there's
09:15 - a bug in our app or a problem and we're
09:18 - trying to track down exactly where it's
09:19 - happening so this is called the debug
09:22 - area here and in the future you're going
09:24 - to learn how to use this to solve
09:26 - crashes and errors in your own project
09:28 - now there are a couple more things with
09:29 - interface builder that I can show you
09:31 - guys but I'm going to save that for a
09:33 - future lesson when we actually start
09:35 - working with interface builder right now
09:37 - I want to show you guys the iPhone
09:39 - simulator so let me go ahead and go up
09:43 - to here it's selected iPhone se by
09:45 - default that is fine I'm going to click
09:47 - this Run button and it's going to build
09:49 - our project it's going to compile all
09:52 - the code and it's going to launch this
09:55 - simulator this iPhone simulator and our
09:57 - app as it is now is going to show up
10:00 - inside here now by far the question I
10:03 - get most is how do I change the size of
10:07 - the simulator because sometimes although
10:09 - on the screen you see that this is a
10:11 - fair size but if you're working on a
10:13 - laptop screen sometimes this simulator
10:15 - can be pretty huge and take up the
10:18 - entire screen you can go up here under
10:20 - the simulator menu to window and go
10:23 - under scale and then you can choose one
10:25 - of these options or you can see the
10:27 - hotkeys for this is command v command
10:30 - for command 3 which is the current
10:32 - setting command 2 and command 1 so let's
10:34 - try that out on our keyboard so this is
10:37 - command 5 you can see that it's really
10:39 - small and this is command 1 where you
10:42 - can see it's so large that I need to
10:44 - scroll so a set a command 3 you can
10:47 - choose one that's comfortable for your
10:49 - screen size so there's your tour of
10:52 - Xcode it may look overwhelming but you
10:55 - know what as we start building apps
10:57 - together you're going to get more and
11:00 - more familiarized with Xcode and it's
11:01 - going to become second nature it's going
11:03 - to become really familiar to you
11:06 - so if you haven't downloaded Xcode
11:08 - already I would highly recommend that
11:10 - you do so now if you're serious about
11:11 - building and try it out try out a new
11:15 - project and just jump through the
11:16 - different paints like I did in this
11:18 - lesson you're going to need Xcode soon
11:20 - anyways if you want to follow along
11:21 - again thanks for watching and I'll see
11:24 - you guys in the next lesson bye for now
