00:06 - hey guys it's Chris here and today I'd
00:08 - like to show you guys a handy tip with
00:11 - the iOS simulator in Xcode now sometimes
00:14 - I see people who are maybe running the
00:17 - simulator for the first time but they've
00:19 - got the simulator really large and they
00:21 - ask me the simulator is too large for my
00:24 - screen how do I fix that well you can
00:26 - actually go up to the window here and go
00:30 - to scale and you can change the scale
00:33 - level there are five different settings
00:35 - so right now I'm at a hundred percent
00:37 - you can see it's even too large for my
00:40 - screen and you can change it all the way
00:42 - down to 25% and notice the shortcut keys
00:45 - here from command one to command five so
00:48 - let's take a look at what 25 percent
00:50 - looks like when you run the app here and
00:54 - this app is just a sample app from my
00:56 - course it's it's something that the
00:58 - students build together so this is zoom
01:01 - level five and if I go command four it's
01:05 - a little bigger command three command
01:07 - two and command one which is at a
01:10 - hundred percent and you can see there's
01:11 - scroll bars here but I could just make
01:14 - that bigger so there you have it if your
01:17 - simulator is too large for your screen
01:20 - try hitting command five right and then
01:23 - that's the smallest zoom level then you
01:25 - command four and then you can get it to
01:28 - just the right size with command one
01:30 - being the largest or you could go up to
01:33 - window here and go to scale making sure
01:35 - that you have the simulator at the
01:38 - forefront so you're looking at the iOS
01:41 - simulator menu and not the Xcode menu
01:45 - because then you won't see it if you're
01:46 - looking at Xcode all right so I hope
01:49 - that is a handy tip for you guys and
01:52 - stay tuned for more see you guys next
01:55 - time
01:57 - you
