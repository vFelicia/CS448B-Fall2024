00:03 - hey quoters
00:04 - Chris here with episode 7 of how to
00:07 - build a shopping app in the previous
00:09 - lesson we had implemented an Add to Cart
00:11 - button on the product detail page today
00:13 - we're going to put a checkout button
00:15 - right here in the upper right hand
00:16 - corner so that people can actually pay
00:18 - for their items and checkout
00:20 - so we're going to start by diving into
00:22 - Xcode and just adding that checkout
00:24 - button in the upper right hand corner
00:26 - it's actually pretty simple so in the
00:29 - viewdidload of the master view
00:30 - controller dot Swift we're going to
00:32 - create a new button so let's call this
00:34 - the checkout button equals UI bar button
00:40 - item and it's got an initializer like
00:44 - here title style target in action so
00:48 - this is going to let us specify the text
00:50 - which I'm going to put as checkout style
00:52 - is UI bar button item style dot plain
00:59 - and the target is self and the action is
01:05 - going to be checkout so the target in
01:10 - action is basically specifying which
01:12 - method of which object should we call
01:14 - when this button is tapped so because
01:16 - I'm going to create a function in the
01:18 - master view controller called checkout
01:21 - so the target is self as in this object
01:24 - and the method name is checkout so I'm
01:28 - going to go down here I'm just going to
01:32 - put it right up here and we can use this
01:36 - notation to create a section check out
01:42 - methods so what happens when you use
01:45 - this syntax right here is that when you
01:48 - pull this down you're going to get this
01:50 - little header here when you look at all
01:51 - your functions so it's a good way to
01:53 - organize your class so we can say func
01:58 - checkout and inside here we're going to
02:03 - create an order
02:08 - process the payment okay and but before
02:11 - we can do that we need to specify some
02:14 - shipping and enable some gateways in our
02:16 - dashboard so I showed you guys this
02:18 - Forge dashboard in the second lesson of
02:21 - the series so if you go here under
02:24 - advanced and under shipping you can see
02:26 - that I've added a shipping method so all
02:29 - you need to do is click this green
02:30 - button and create a shipping method but
02:32 - what's important is to remember this
02:34 - slug okay so that's going to be the
02:37 - identifier that we pass into the call to
02:40 - specify to use this shipping method and
02:43 - second of all if you go to gateways I've
02:46 - enabled a dummy gateway here for our
02:49 - testing purposes but if you are doing
02:52 - this live you would actually add the
02:54 - integration details for your select
02:56 - gateway and then hit the switch to
02:58 - enable it now we have the details that
03:01 - we need in order to make a checkout call
03:03 - we look at the API reference under
03:05 - checkout and pass a car to checkout you
03:08 - can see the URL that we're going to hit
03:11 - and the parameters that we're going to
03:13 - pass in so we're going to need some
03:16 - customer information the shipping method
03:18 - to use which is the slug that I told you
03:20 - about the gateway slug to use and let me
03:23 - show you that actually under this column
03:26 - this middle column you can see the slugs
03:28 - for all the gateway and for the dummy
03:30 - gateway the slug is just dummy so that's
03:32 - what we're going to be passing in and we
03:34 - need to build to address in the ship to
03:36 - address so for the purpose of this demo
03:38 - I'm not going to create all of the user
03:40 - interface elements to capture all of
03:43 - this data from the customer but
03:44 - essentially if you were doing it it
03:46 - would be a bunch of text fields and
03:48 - labels so that the user can enter in
03:50 - their customer information their billing
03:53 - address their payment information like
03:55 - credit cards and stuff like that for
03:57 - this demo we're going to hard-code all
03:58 - of that data okay so let's go back into
04:01 - Xcode and just create this checkout
04:04 - method so here I'm going to create the
04:08 - order data actually I'm going to write
04:11 - hard code the order data in a real app
04:15 - you would gather this data from the user
04:21 - using a bunch of text fields and labels
04:27 - so I've actually got this order data pre
04:29 - done I'm just going to copy and paste it
04:32 - here and I'm going to explain to you
04:34 - what these fields mean so here we have a
04:38 - constant named order parameters and this
04:41 - is a dictionary so you can see here as
04:44 - NS object any object so we have a
04:47 - customer key and the value is another
04:50 - dictionary with a couple of key value
04:53 - pairs first name last name and email
04:55 - that represents the customer next we
04:59 - have the shipping key and the value is
05:01 - free shipping because that is in my
05:04 - dashboard here the slug for my shipping
05:07 - method the only one I've got is actually
05:10 - free - shipping so that's why I've
05:13 - specified that here the gateway is dummy
05:15 - like I showed you before and the bill 2
05:18 - is another dictionary which contains a
05:20 - couple of key value pairs namely first
05:23 - name last name address 1 address 2 city
05:26 - country or county sorry country postcode
05:30 - and phone and if the shipping address is
05:32 - the same as the bill to address all you
05:34 - need to do is specify the bill - key as
05:36 - the value of the ship - key so those are
05:40 - the order parameters that we're going to
05:41 - pass into the call that we're about to
05:44 - make so in order to make that call we
05:46 - say moulten shared instance dot cart dot
05:51 - order with parameters and for the
05:55 - parameters we're going to pass in these
05:58 - guys right here so let's say order
06:02 - parameters and it has two callbacks so
06:06 - let's expand the success callback first
06:09 - it's got one response parameter
06:12 - I'm just going to call that response
06:14 - dictionary and we're going to fill in
06:16 - some code here once the order is
06:18 - successfully created then we actually
06:20 - process the payment and there's failure
06:23 - so there's two parameters for this guy
06:29 - in here I'm just going to print can
06:40 - create the order I'm going to put a
06:41 - breakpoint there okay so if the order
06:45 - was successfully created what we have to
06:47 - do is get the order ID of the order that
06:52 - was created because we need that in
06:53 - order to pass it into the our next API
06:57 - call which is this one process payment
07:00 - for an order okay so first of all we're
07:03 - going to capture the order ID if we go
07:06 - back to the reference document this was
07:09 - the call we made to create the order and
07:12 - under result and under the ID field we
07:15 - have the ID of the order that was
07:18 - created so we're going to grab that
07:20 - we're going to say let order ID equals
07:26 - response dictionary as nsdictionary
07:32 - we're going to cast it as an NS
07:34 - dictionary so that we can use this
07:36 - method value for key path and for the
07:38 - key path we're going to pass in result
07:40 - dot ID and this is going to come out as
07:44 - a string okay so if let the let's just
07:53 - call this a no ID if it was able to
07:56 - retrieve an order ID we're going to need
08:00 - to process the payment now but again if
08:02 - this were a real app you're going to
08:04 - need to capture that information from
08:06 - the user in a series of text fields so
08:08 - here we're going to hard-code the credit
08:12 - card details in a real app you would
08:17 - gather this from the user in a form so
08:23 - let's go back here I have this data as
08:27 - well let me paste it here and let me
08:29 - explain to you what's going on here
08:31 - we have a constant named payment
08:34 - parameters and this is a dictionary and
08:37 - inside that dictionary we only have one
08:40 - key pair so the key is
08:41 - data and the value is a dictionary and
08:45 - that dictionary has the key value pairs
08:48 - for the credit card information so the
08:50 - number expiry date and the code at the
08:53 - back so these parameters are what we're
08:56 - going to pass into the API call we're
08:59 - going to say Moulton dot shared instance
09:01 - dot checkout dot payment with method and
09:06 - the type of payment we're going to make
09:08 - is a purchase so that's just that string
09:11 - there for the order this is the order ID
09:14 - so we're going to put oh I D and for
09:17 - parameters we're going to put the
09:19 - payment parameters and lastly there's a
09:22 - success callback in a failure callback
09:24 - so we're going to open up the success
09:25 - callback let's call that response
09:29 - dictionary and inside this code here
09:33 - we're going to display a message to the
09:36 - user that checkout was successful in the
09:42 - failure callback there's two parameters
09:45 - response dictionary and error and here
09:51 - we're going to just write could not
09:55 - process the payment I'm going to set a
09:59 - breakpoint there in case it hits that
10:01 - point okay so that's all you need to do
10:04 - to process the payment for the cart in
10:06 - here the payment has already been
10:08 - processed so all we need to do is
10:10 - display an alert to the user we're
10:12 - actually going to go back to the detail
10:14 - view controller to just copy the code
10:16 - that we had here to display an alert so
10:19 - I'm going to copy these three lines copy
10:23 - and I'm going to paste it right here and
10:26 - just change the title and the message of
10:28 - the alert so the title is order complete
10:33 - the message is your order is complete
10:40 - and your payment has been processed
10:45 - thank you for shopping with us and then
10:50 - next we add an OK button to that alert
10:53 - and then finally we present that alert
10:55 - to the
10:55 - user okay so let's run our app now and
10:58 - see it in action
11:02 - okay so we're missing a checkout button
11:04 - here I actually forgot to add it we
11:08 - created it but we forgot to add it so
11:10 - here back in the viewdidload of the
11:13 - master view controller that Swift we
11:14 - created a checkout button but we didn't
11:16 - add it so in order to add it we type in
11:19 - self navigation item dot write bar
11:24 - button equals checkout button okay so
11:29 - let's run it again okay so now we've got
11:34 - that checkout button let me add the imac
11:36 - to the cart okay go back and let me hit
11:41 - checkout and you can see in the console
11:44 - window that the calls are being made and
11:45 - then our order is complete and now we're
11:49 - done so we go here we can see all calls
11:52 - that were being made so this was
11:54 - creating the order and this was
11:57 - processing the payment so now let's go
11:59 - back to our forge dashboard and we can
12:02 - check out under the orders manage orders
12:05 - we can see the one that I just made
12:08 - which is this one right here this one
12:11 - right here was just another test order
12:13 - that I did before recording the video so
12:15 - if this were a live store you would have
12:16 - gotten two orders already now of course
12:18 - we simplified a whole bunch of things
12:20 - with our demo here but I hope you can
12:22 - see that it's pretty simple to implement
12:24 - a user flow where they can browse items
12:27 - they can add them to the cart and they
12:29 - can checkout and pay now all you have to
12:31 - focus on is the user experience for your
12:33 - app and making it look really slick and
12:35 - polished before we go I actually want to
12:38 - show you another demo that Moulton has
12:40 - for Swift and it has a more complete
12:43 - checkout flow so let me see if I can
12:45 - find it here I'm just going to go on the
12:48 - Moulton homepage scroll all the way to
12:52 - the bottom and let's see getting started
12:56 - it's under Swift and if you scroll all
13:03 - the way to the bottom there's a swift
13:05 - example app which we are going to view
13:07 - on github
13:08 - and we are going to download this zip
13:12 - I'm just going to put it on the desktop
13:15 - I'm going to unzip it so it's right now
13:19 - it's on my desktop right here and we
13:24 - have to before we can actually run this
13:27 - project we need to use cocoapods to
13:29 - install the dependencies that the
13:31 - project needs so if you go back to go
13:34 - back a couple lessons where we talked
13:36 - about how to use cocoapods you'll know
13:39 - how to do this so I'm in terminal right
13:41 - now I'm going to go to the desktop
13:44 - all right go CD iOS Swift and then you
13:48 - can press tab to fill in the rest of the
13:51 - folder name press Enter
13:54 - now I'm inside that folder I need to go
13:56 - one more folder deeper so moulten swift
14:00 - example and then here I can see the pod
14:02 - file so I can just write pod install and
14:06 - it's going to go ahead and read the pod
14:09 - file and fetch all the dependencies and
14:11 - download them okay so now we're done now
14:17 - we can open up the x-c workspace file
14:22 - right here and I'm just going to go
14:24 - ahead and run the project okay so here
14:27 - we go so what we have here is a
14:31 - collection of products and you can click
14:35 - on the tab and you can view your cart so
14:37 - let's click this one right here because
14:40 - I know there are some products in there
14:41 - and here we're looking at the products
14:44 - in that collection so you click that
14:46 - you're going into the product details we
14:49 - click the Buy Now it's going to add it
14:51 - to the cart and then it's going to bring
14:54 - you to the cart page and here you can
14:55 - actually increase and decrement the
14:58 - quantity of the product and then finally
15:00 - you can checkout and in here it's
15:03 - loading the form where you can fill in
15:05 - your address and your country and stuff
15:07 - like that so I'm not going to do this
15:09 - but you can check out this demo for a
15:11 - more complete example of a shopping app
15:14 - where there's actually the form for you
15:16 - guys to fill out the information I hope
15:18 - you guys have enjoyed this series how to
15:20 - build a shopping app
