00:00 - hey guys it's Chris here I just wanted
00:02 - to give you a little update on what's
00:03 - been going on behind the scenes that
00:04 - code with Chris because it's been a
00:06 - while since I've sat down here to chat
00:08 - with you like this and I've got six
00:10 - updates for you today I know it's a lot
00:12 - but like I said it's been a while so
00:15 - update number one I've finally finished
00:17 - the 2019 beginner series they were
00:20 - really fun to make and they're perfect
00:21 - for beginners so if you're in that boat
00:23 - or you know anyone who wants to learn
00:25 - how to build an app well I'll link to
00:27 - those in the description below and
00:29 - number two I can't believe I'm saying
00:31 - this I'm still in awe but my code with
00:35 - Chris training materials were featured
00:37 - on a big screen in an Apple retail store
00:41 - to a live audience like I can't believe
00:43 - that never did I dream that code with
00:46 - Chris would show up in an Apple retail
00:48 - store well a retail store employee
00:50 - reached out to me and they told me that
00:52 - my tear he was using some of my material
00:55 - to demonstrate some coding in a live
00:58 - session in a retail store and I got a
01:01 - picture of it so that's really cool but
01:03 - I didn't know that they offer free live
01:07 - coding sessions in the store so it's an
01:09 - initiative called today at Apple and you
01:12 - can visit Apple comm slash today and
01:15 - turn your location and it's gonna give
01:17 - you a schedule of free live sessions
01:19 - that you can go to to not only learn
01:21 - about coding but you can learn about
01:22 - like photography art music all that sort
01:26 - of stuff completely for free so I didn't
01:29 - know that that existed I think it's a
01:31 - great resource and I just want to throw
01:33 - it out there just in case you don't know
01:34 - about it as well me being featured in an
01:37 - Apple Retail Store is a secondary thing
01:39 - but I was like still super super excited
01:41 - about that all right number three
01:43 - Xcode 10.2 and Swift 5 was released this
01:47 - week as you might have known but the
01:49 - good thing is that so if I didn't break
01:51 - a whole ton of stuff I do have a learn
01:53 - Swift video series which is still
01:56 - relevant but it's a little bit dated now
01:58 - it's a year old and it's about time I
02:02 - update and refresh those lessons I think
02:04 - most of you guys watching probably have
02:07 - gone through some sort of swift training
02:09 - already that's for people who are just
02:12 - starting out
02:13 - Swift so in terms of content for not
02:16 - beginners well that's where I want to
02:18 - ask you so my plan is to go back and
02:21 - update some of my older series and I
02:23 - just wanted to ask you what in what
02:27 - preference or what order you want me to
02:29 - do them in so some things that I've
02:31 - shortlisted are the molten video series
02:34 - and this is was an app where I
02:36 - integrated with the molten platform
02:39 - which enables ecommerce shopping cart
02:42 - functionality for your app there was the
02:45 - YouTube API app where I taught you how
02:48 - to work with the YouTube API to grab the
02:51 - feeds and grab videos to play them there
02:54 - was also the Pomodoro app video series
02:57 - where we started building an app
02:59 - together through livestream that we
03:01 - intend to submit to the app store
03:02 - together and work on it build like a
03:05 - website for it and a marketing plan and
03:07 - everything like that
03:08 - so let me know which of those ones you'd
03:11 - be interested in me working on first or
03:14 - maybe completely something else let me
03:16 - know by leaving a quick comment below
03:18 - all right and number five so that was
03:21 - number four number five I'm super duper
03:24 - hyped to say this but behind the scenes
03:26 - we've been working with a couple of
03:27 - teachers to bring the code with Chris
03:29 - curriculum into their classrooms now the
03:33 - real reason I started coded Chris was
03:35 - because I believe so strongly that the
03:38 - coding was for everyone anyone can learn
03:41 - to code and my mission was to bring as
03:43 - many non coders into the coding world as
03:46 - I could and what better way to do that
03:48 - than to work with young kids and inspire
03:50 - them and empower them to pursue coding
03:53 - so I'm super duper excited about this
03:55 - initiative and when it launches I'll
03:58 - keep you guys posted on how that goes
03:59 - now if you're a teacher and you're
04:01 - interested in bringing your classroom
04:03 - into our pilot program all you have to
04:06 - do is reach out to us at code with Chris
04:09 - comp slash contact and we'll send you
04:11 - the details for that now number six is
04:13 - recognition you guys are doing such cool
04:15 - stuff day in and day out and I really
04:17 - want to share in those milestones and
04:18 - victories with you guys so whatever you
04:21 - guys are doing if you're learning with
04:22 - some my material or you're building
04:24 - something let me know
04:25 - tweet at me
04:26 - send me a message on Instagram leave me
04:29 - a youtube comment you know where to find
04:30 - me just let me know and I'll share that
04:32 - across all my social media channels so
04:34 - that we can motivate each other and we
04:36 - can inspire each other to move on now I
04:39 - have started issuing completion
04:41 - certificates for people who have
04:42 - completed the work card game because I
04:43 - feel like that is a huge milestone for a
04:46 - beginner especially someone who has
04:48 - never coded before so if that's you
04:50 - you've completed the war card game those
04:52 - ten beginner lessons just visit the URL
04:54 - below to grab your digital certificate
04:56 - and also if you've submitted an app
04:58 - before in to the App Store and my
05:01 - tutorials have helped you in some way
05:02 - please let me know I really love to
05:04 - share your story in your app I do have a
05:07 - link in the footer of my website just
05:09 - visit code with Chris comm scroll all
05:11 - the way to the bottom there is an app
05:13 - submission link just click on that and
05:14 - fill out the details on a weekly basis
05:16 - we'll be sharing all of these victories
05:19 - and milestones with everyone across our

05:24 - that's update number six number seven
05:26 - bonus update is this t-shirt right here
05:29 - you might have noticed me wearing it
05:30 - says code crew which is a term I've been
05:33 - using with you guys for a while now
05:35 - to be quite frank I'm not that happy
05:38 - with the quality that this prototype
05:40 - turned out quality of the t-shirt the
05:43 - quality printing so until I can get
05:45 - those things right I won't be releasing
05:47 - any code with Chris t-shirts but it is
05:50 - something that is being worked on in the
05:53 - progress alright so that's it for this
05:55 - week thank you so much for listening and
