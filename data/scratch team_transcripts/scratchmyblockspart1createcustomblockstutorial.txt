00:09 - Have you seen the “My Blocks”
category in the Scratch blocks 
palette?
00:13 - When you click on it,
00:14 - no blocks are present
until you create one.
00:16 - Let's explore
how to create a customized block
00:19 - and when and why
you might want to use them.
00:22 - Let's say
00:22 - you are creating
a Scratch program
00:24 - and you've written
a sequence of steps
00:26 - that performs
a particular action.
00:28 - That action could be performing
a complicated spin move,
00:31 - playing a set of musical notes,
drawing a shape with the 
pen tool,
00:35 - performing some complex
math, or anything else.
00:39 - That stack of blocks is known
as a “procedure” or a “routine.”
00:43 - Most computer
programing languages
00:45 - allow you to create
a special name
00:46 - for a group of commands
or lines of code and then call
00:50 - for that sequence to run at any
point in the main program.
00:53 - In Scratch,
we use “My Blocks.”
00:56 - Click on “My Blocks” in the 
blocks palette
00:58 - and then click on “Make
a block.”
01:00 - You can give your block
any name you want,
01:02 - but I'd recommend something
descriptive
01:04 - so you can recall later
what this stack of blocks does.
01:08 - Let's say I want to create
a series of blocks
01:10 - that makes my cat sprite spin
forward and backward.
01:13 - I'll call my block “cat spin.”
01:15 - Once I click “OK,”
01:16 - you'll see a new event
handler block
01:18 - appears on the scripts area
that says, “define.”
01:22 - Under this block,
01:23 - I want to add all the code
blocks in my procedure.
01:26 - For this example,
I've added some repeating code
01:29 - that makes the cat whirl
01:31 - and turn forward
in two complete circles
01:34 - and then reverse the whirl,
01:35 - turning in the opposite
direction.
01:37 - Let's click on this
stack and see how it looks.
01:41 - Now that I've defined
01:42 - what my custom block does,
let's use it in my main program.
01:46 - When I want the spin to occur,
01:48 - I'll grab my custom “cat spin”
block now available
01:51 - in the blocks palette
and place it in my main program.
01:54 - In this program
that I'm writing,
01:56 - the cat will spin after
01:57 - each background change and say
something after the spin.
02:02 - Let's see how this looks 
by clicking the green flag.
02:09 - The advantage of writing
this procedure separately
02:12 - is that I can use one block
to call for a whole set of steps
02:15 - to be run each time I need it.
02:17 - Creating separate procedures
using custom blocks
02:20 - makes the code faster
to write and read,
02:23 - and easier or quicker to edit.
02:25 - If I wasn't
using a custom block,
02:27 - this is how the code would look.
02:29 - Looking at them side-by-side,
which is easier to read?
02:35 - And look,
if I wanted to change the spin,
02:38 - I only have to edit it
in one place, versus
02:41 - editing it in multiple places
in my long single code sequence.
02:46 - You don't have to use a custom
block
02:48 - just for code that will repeat.
02:49 - If you have a long, complex
sequence
02:52 - that performs
a particular action,
02:53 - you may want to define it
as a custom block
02:56 - so you can more easily identify
all the steps involved and edit
02:59 - it later.
03:00 - As a program becomes longer
and more complex,
03:03 - it can be easy for a programmer
to lose their place as they
03:06 - develop and debug
and refine the code over time.
03:09 - If you have planned out
your program
03:10 - and know the procedures
you want to define separately,
03:13 - you can set up your custom block
at the very beginning.
03:16 - Or if you've written a program
that is very long,
03:19 - you can revisit your program
and identify repeating code
03:23 - or specialized code you want to
define as separate procedures,
03:27 - create custom blocks,
and use them to make your code
03:30 - more efficient
to read, write, and edit.
03:34 - In other videos,
03:35 - we'll explore using My Blocks
versus Broadcast blocks
03:38 - (which both can store
a set of procedures),
03:41 - go over some tips and tricks for
using My Blocks successfully,
03:44 - explore creating more complex
custom blocks using inputs.
03:48 - We’ll also discuss that option 
to run without screen refresh.
03:52 - The possibilities are endless.
