00:00 - - Hey, everyone.
00:00 - My name is Eric and I hope you're having
00:01 - a great Scratch Month.
00:02 - (giggles)
00:03 - (cheers)
00:04 - We are officially two weeks
into this global celebration,
00:06 - where people are coming on
to the Scratch community
00:08 - to imagine, create and share together.
00:10 - And I wanna give you a quick
recap of what we've seen.
00:13 - So, on Monday we launched
three new activities,
00:16 - one of them was Interview Anything.
00:18 - So, were used to interviewing people,
00:20 - but what if you could
literally interview anything?
00:23 - I love this one where it's reported Berry
00:26 - interviewing Mr. Milk.
00:27 - - [Reporter Berry] Hello Mr. Milk,
00:28 - today we will ask you what
everyone wants to know.
00:30 - Do you get cold in here?
00:35 - That's really interesting.
00:36 - - And we also saw this
hard hitting interview,
00:38 - where a chipmunk was interviewing a chair.
00:40 - ♪ Babadoo-Bada-Bapbap-badoo the nut show ♪
00:44 - - Now, tell me what's
it like being a chair?
00:49 - Fascinating.
00:50 - - We also launched the
activity Sprite Art,
00:52 - which encouraged people
to make art out of,
00:54 - well, anything as well.
00:56 - I was super mesmerized by
the number of spiraling
00:58 - food projects that we saw.
01:00 - I was also really digging
this Sprite paint tool,
01:03 - that even included a rainbow mode.
01:05 - (light classical music)
01:05 - And, finally, we launched our
01:06 - How Do You Peace out activity,
01:08 - which is all about creating relaxing
01:10 - and soothing Scratch projects.
01:12 - I really loved this
project where a puffer fish
01:14 - was leading you through
a breathing exercise.
01:16 - So, every time the puffer fish
would go up you'd breathe in,
01:19 - and when it went down you'd breathe out.
01:22 - We were also taken onto this awesome
01:23 - journey into our own imagination.
01:25 - - [Girl] Think that you're in a forest
01:28 - and you come across a beautiful lake
01:32 - and you close your eyes
01:35 - and you think you've had
the most beautiful day.
01:37 - - And I especially loved this project
01:39 - with a view out a window
01:41 - that reminds us,
01:42 - while we're apart we're
all together in this.
01:44 - And I've especially been
feeling that togetherness
01:47 - seeing all the awesome collaboration
01:48 - that's been happening at
Scratch online community
01:50 - during Scratch Month.
01:51 - So, there you have it,
01:52 - there's just a little sneak peak
01:54 - into what's been happening
during Scratch Month.
01:56 - And, as a reminder, we
would love for you to join.
01:58 - So just hop on over to
the Scratch website,
02:00 - scratch.mit.edu, and on the home page
02:03 - you'll see a featured studio row.
02:05 - That's gonna have all the
Scratch month activities.
02:07 - And, of course, we also have
the Scratch Month website
02:10 - that has all the details as well.
02:12 - So, hope to see you online
and happy Scratch Month.
