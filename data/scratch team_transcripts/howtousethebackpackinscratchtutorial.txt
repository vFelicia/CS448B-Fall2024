00:00 - - Hi everyone,
00:00 - it's Zoe from the Scratch
Team, also known as Zinnea.
00:03 - Today I wanted to show you how to use
00:04 - a really helpful feature in Scratch.
00:07 - The Backpack.
00:08 - Now, what is the Backpack?
00:09 - The Backpack lets you transport things
00:11 - from one scratch project to another.
00:13 - So, if you have a
character you want to use
00:15 - in multiple projects, the
Backpack is great for that.
00:17 - You could also transport
sounds, pieces of art,
00:20 - and also pieces of code.
00:21 - I'll show you how to use it.
00:22 - So, say you want to transport a sprite,
00:24 - from one project to another.
00:25 - Let's say I'm making
this new ocean project.
00:27 - And in this other project I made,
00:30 - I have this rainbow star sprite,
00:32 - and I want to put that,
in the ocean project.
00:34 - I can transport it with the Backpack.
00:36 - The Backpack, lives down here,
00:38 - and I can click on it to open it up,
00:40 - then click and drag the
star into the Backpack.
00:44 - It'll appear there.
00:45 - And then go back to my ocean project.
00:47 - I can click to open up
the Backpack in there,
00:49 - and then I can click and drag the star
00:52 - into the sprite area here,
00:54 - and there you go,
00:55 - now I have the star in my ocean project.
00:57 - You can also transport a sound.
00:59 - So, say I have a sound in this project.
01:01 - (suspenseful tune)
01:03 - I can, go to the Sounds tab.
01:06 - There's the sound,
01:07 - I can click to open up the Backpack,
01:09 - and then drag the sound into it.
01:11 - Go back to my ocean project,
01:13 - open the Backpack,
01:14 - and drag the sound,
01:15 - and the sprite that my mouse is over,
01:16 - is the sprite that it'll go to.
01:18 - And I think I want to give it to Giga.
01:20 - So, I drop it on Giga,
01:22 - and then go to the Sounds tab,
01:24 - (suspenseful tune)
01:26 - and there it is.
01:27 - You can also transport
just one piece of code.
01:30 - So say I have this project
with a frog that jumps,
01:33 - and I don't want the frog,
01:34 - but I just want to give
this piece of jump code
01:36 - to this character Giga.
01:38 - I can, open up the Backpack,
01:40 - click and drag this piece
of code, right in there.
01:43 - As you see it shows up as a script,
01:45 - and I can then go back
to my ocean project,
01:48 - open the Backpack,
01:48 - and then just click and drag
this code to this code area.
01:52 - And now,
01:54 - Giga can jump.
01:55 - You can also transport just one
costume of a certain sprite.
01:58 - So, say I have this other project
02:00 - and I don't wanna to take
the whole Giga sprite over,
02:02 - but I do want this costume
where Giga has a nice hat.
02:04 - What I can do is,
02:05 - go to the Costumes tab,
02:07 - open up the Backpack
02:08 - and I can click and drag that in there.
02:11 - As you see it appears as a costume
02:12 - and not a sprite like the star did.
02:15 - I can then go back to my ocean project,
02:18 - I can open the Backpack in here,
02:20 - whatever sprite I drag it
to, will get the costume.
02:24 - Just like with the sound,
02:25 - and I want it to go to Giga so I'll,
02:27 - drag it to Giga.
02:28 - And now, Giga has a hat.
02:30 - You could also transport a backdrop.
02:31 - So, if I wanted this blue sky backdrop,
02:34 - I could go to the Stage,
02:36 - go to the Backdrops tab,
open up the Backpack,
02:40 - put this backdrop inside,
go back to my ocean project,
02:43 - open up the Backpack,
02:44 - and drag this backdrop to here.
02:47 - You could also use the Backpack
02:49 - to transport things from
other people's projects.
02:51 - When you do this, it
becomes really important
02:52 - to give credit, and I'll
show you how to do that.
02:55 - So let's say someone has made a project
02:56 - with this spinning puffer fish
02:58 - and I'd like to use the
puffer fish in my project.
03:00 - I can click See Inside on their project,
03:03 - open up the Backpack,
03:05 - click and drag the puffer fish in,
03:06 - open up the Backpack in my project,
03:08 - drag the puffer fish into this area,
03:11 - and there it is.
03:12 - Now, to give credit,
03:13 - I can click See Project Page,
03:16 - and I can edit the notes
and credits of my project
03:19 - and say, thanks Zooetrope
for the puffer fish,
03:24 - I got it from this project
03:27 - and I will copy the link by right clicking
03:30 - and clicking copy.
03:31 - You can also do Command + C on a Mac,
03:33 - or Ctrl + C on a PC,
03:35 - and then paste it here.
03:37 - Right clicking and clicking paste,
03:39 - and there you go, now you've given credit.
03:41 - The ability to remix and
to build on the things
03:43 - other people have made
03:44 - has been a really
important part of Scratch
03:46 - since it started.
03:47 - I think it's part of what's so wonderful
03:48 - about having an online community is that
03:49 - you can build on other people's creations.
03:51 - It just, is really important
to give credit when you do,
03:54 - and to make sure you change something
03:55 - or add something to it,
03:56 - to make your project unique from theirs.
03:58 - Anyway, that's what I
wanted to show you today.
04:00 - The Backpack can be so useful,
04:02 - it can be great for collaborating.
04:03 - It's great for, if you
have a logo or a character
04:06 - that you want to use in
a lot of your projects.
04:08 - So I hope you have fun trying it out.
04:10 - Anyway, I'll see you
next time and Scratch on.
04:13 - (playful music)
