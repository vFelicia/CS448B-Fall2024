00:03 - - Kick off the day with a keynote session.
00:08 - I think it's a really special one.
00:11 - We're really lucky to have
as a moderator of the session
00:14 - Ricarose Roque, who's a,
00:17 - so it's great to have Ricarose
back, she's a former member
00:19 - of the Scratch team here at MIT
00:21 - is now a professor at the
University of Colorado,
00:24 - I think it's really
appropriate that Ricarose is
00:26 - moderating the session
because while she was here
00:27 - on a Scratch team she
did a lot to both support
00:31 - and study the online community,
00:33 - of work with all the young
people who are interacting
00:36 - in the community and collaborating
00:38 - in the community in so many ways,
00:41 - so Ricarose did her dissertation here
00:44 - on family creative learning,
00:45 - and has continued to extend that work
00:46 - with her research in Colorado,
00:48 - and it's great to have her back
00:50 - with three long-time members
of the Scratch community
00:52 - to talk about their experiences
in growing up with Scratch,
00:56 - so let me welcome Ricarose
and other panel members
00:59 - to the stage.
01:00 - (audience applauds)
01:01 - - Hi everyone it's so good to see you all
01:05 - and I'm so excited about this panel,
01:09 - when I joined the team in 2010,
01:12 - and for the six years
I was part of the team,
01:14 - there's so many things
about it that I loved,
01:17 - I loved working with the team,
01:19 - it was nice to be Mitch's advisee,
01:22 - also getting to know you all through
01:23 - the different gatherings,
01:25 - but one of the things that I loved
01:27 - the most was interacting
with the Scratchers,
01:31 - Scratch members, but also
call them Scratchers,
01:35 - one of the things that really caught me
01:38 - as we were working in the community
01:40 - and watching what was happening,
01:42 - was seeing the ways that young people
01:45 - were growing up in the community,
01:48 - they might start when they're 10 or 12,
01:51 - and suddenly they're looking at colleges
01:54 - and they're still Scratching
and they're introducing
01:55 - others to Scratch,
01:57 - and it's just so wonderful
to see the different ways
01:59 - that they were growing and learning
02:01 - and connecting with each other,
02:03 - So it's such a pleasure to
bring three of them here today,
02:08 - over here is Bella and Jocelyn and JT,
02:12 - they're gonna introduce
themselves a bit more,
02:15 - so I thought maybe you
could say a brief thing
02:18 - about yourselves and then we're gonna
02:20 - show something about each of them.
02:23 - - Hi my name is Isabella,
02:24 - I have been Scratching
for about five years now,
02:28 - I'm from LA and my username
is Bellamai on Scratch.
02:32 - hi I'm Jocelyn Marencik,
02:34 - I've been Scratching also
for about five years,
02:36 - I'm from Richmond, Virginia
and my Scratch username
02:38 - is CrazyNimbus.
02:42 - - Hey my name is JT I've been Scratching
02:43 - for almost 5 years now,
02:45 - I'm from Sheldon, North Carolina
02:47 - and my username is St19_galla,
02:50 - I'm sorry my teacher made us.
02:52 - (audience laughs)
02:57 - - You've talked to your teacher recently?
02:58 - - Yes,
03:00 - so technically Gala in the last name
03:02 - is a break of the community guidelines,
03:05 - so I had to let her know. (mumbles)
03:07 - (audience laughs)
03:10 - - Just as a pro tip as you're
creating new user names.
03:14 - I thought as a nice way to
start getting to know them
03:18 - that they could share their
very first Scratch project,
03:22 - so we all remember ours,
03:24 - I thought we could share some of theirs,
03:27 - so let's start with,
03:31 - here's Bella's.
03:37 - Let me refresh it so you
get the full experience.
03:45 - (animals calling)
03:57 - Do you wanna say a little
bit about the project?
03:59 - (audience laughs)
04:02 - - Yes as you can see it has
a very complex storyline,
04:08 - yeah this is my first project,
04:09 - it was right after I figured
out how to use Scratch,
04:12 - and I got familiar with
what the blocks mean,
04:15 - and I just took a couple
04:16 - of the most self-explanatory blocks,
04:18 - put them together and I
was actually really proud
04:20 - that I was able to make something
04:22 - on my first day using Scratch,
04:24 - and as you can see it's very simple,
04:25 - I just repeated the same little
loop over and over again.
04:30 - - Cool.
04:33 - (audience applauds)
04:40 - Share it gracefully.
04:42 - - Here's my first project ever,
04:51 - if I just move the mouse.
04:54 - As you can see the car
moves perfectly sideways.
05:00 - It goes around in a circle,
05:02 - and if you touch the
green at all you lose.
05:06 - I was just happy to create
something on my first day,
05:10 - just like Bella was, and
then just not too long after
05:14 - that I joined the community.
05:16 - - Cool.
05:18 - (audience applauds)
05:26 - I notice it had 22,000 views.
05:31 - My first project did not have that many.
05:35 - So here's JT's,
05:37 - do you wanna preface it or
should I start playing it?
05:41 - - You might not be able to tell because
05:42 - I'm a cross-country
runner, but I love food,
05:44 - I especially love doughnuts,
05:47 - and yeah I just decided to
do something with doughnuts,
05:51 - so here's my disco donut.
05:54 - (audience laughs)
06:01 - - So I'm curious actually how did
06:02 - you find out about Scratch?
06:06 - - My dad actually introduced Scratch
06:08 - to me just one day when
I was in sixth grade,
06:11 - he said hey check out
this really cool website,
06:14 - because he is a programmer himself,
06:16 - and so he saw this something fun,
06:18 - inviting that I would be interested in,
06:20 - and right away the
colors and the community,
06:25 - And just how much fun the website looked,
06:27 - it drew me in,
06:28 - and I was so excited to get started.
06:31 - - So I joined when I did a Google search
06:35 - for different kinds of
programming languages
06:37 - that I could use to
teach myself how to code,
06:41 - so I originally joined to
learn how to make games,
06:44 - but then after that I kept expanding
06:45 - to art and animation and stories,
06:47 - and so much more,
06:49 - as soon as I saw the community was giving
06:50 - so much positive feedback.
06:53 - - I'm curious actually how did
you know about programming,
06:57 - did you hear about it--
06:58 - - I heard about it from a
few of my friends one day,
07:01 - they were like, oh, I just
coded this little thing
07:04 - that can make my computer
change colors or something,
07:08 - and I was like that sounds
cool, what is coding,
07:11 - and then I looked it up
and I got so interested
07:13 - in it and I discovered Scratch,
07:15 - and then I got so much
further now it's been great.
07:20 - - Cool, how about you JT, how
did you first hear about it?
07:22 - - Yeah, so mine was from a
teacher like I mentioned,
07:24 - it was actually a week-long unit
07:26 - in my general computer
class in seventh grade,
07:31 - and so after that week
though after sharing
07:34 - some projects and seeing
people interact with them,
07:36 - I had no clue who they were,
07:37 - but seeing their positive feedback
07:38 - from all across the world,
07:40 - I just had to stick with it.
07:43 - - Does your teacher know that you're
07:45 - still on Scratch and doing things?
07:47 - - Yeah I email her every now and then
07:49 - to keep updated on different
things I've been doing,
07:50 - And she loves it,
07:51 - she always mentions me with her new class
07:55 - because she keeps the program going
07:57 - and sometimes I'll Skype in with them,
07:58 - and introduce them to Scratch.
08:04 - - I haven't Skype with my teachers,
08:06 - that's awesome you keep in touch with her.
08:10 - So Jocelyn you mentioned the community,
08:12 - so how did you first find
out about the community,
08:16 - was it something you saw immediately or?
08:19 - - Right after I shared the first project
08:21 - that I shared which was a dance project,
08:24 - different than the first
project that you saw there,
08:27 - I started getting some feedback
08:29 - in ways that I could improve,
08:31 - so not just I like this or this is cool,
08:35 - I got ideas for it maybe you could
08:36 - add another character doing something,
08:38 - or you can add a feature
where they get scored based
08:41 - on certain ways they move
and things like that,
08:44 - so after seeing that
feedback and adding products
08:47 - to studios and collaborating
and all the different comments,
08:51 - and the welcoming committee
when I first joined,
08:54 - I knew that this was a
very positive community
08:56 - and decided to keep going.
08:58 - - I wanted to show something
09:00 - as you mentioned in your own case,
09:03 - because I know people have
a different experience
09:06 - here with the Scratch community,
09:07 - I think sometimes when I
talk to people they see
09:12 - the website and they think
it's a place to share projects,
09:15 - but I think something
that might not be obvious
09:19 - right away until you start
clicking and digging in,
09:22 - and seeing that there's this
really dynamic community
09:24 - of young people participating in it,
09:29 - and actually when you first
join and make an account,
09:33 - I won't be able to sign in here
09:35 - because I've been in the
Scratch community for some time,
09:37 - but on this site you
will see something like
09:40 - the welcoming committee
you mentioned Jocelyn,
09:43 - I wonder if I could Google
search welcoming committee,
09:48 - oh look, when I Google welcoming committee
09:50 - there's a project by CrazyNimbus.
09:53 - (audience laughs)
09:54 - - That was a guide for helping people
09:58 - who would like to join
the welcoming committee.
10:01 - Yes that's my voice.
10:04 - So yeah I also have a normal
welcoming project in there too,
10:08 - so basically what we do
in there is I've been
10:11 - a coordinator in the welcoming
committee for a while now,
10:14 - or a curator or a person
that's helping new members,
10:19 - so I've been showing them where
they can go on the website,
10:21 - where they can get started
if they're feeling stuck,
10:23 - and then showing them
where they can show off
10:26 - their projects and get positive
feedback from each other,
10:29 - such as the discussion forums,
10:31 - and it's been a very pleasant experience
10:34 - with all the new members
and watching them grow,
10:38 - it's like watching a kid grow up,
10:40 - watching them do more and more amazing
10:42 - things with each other in the community.
10:45 - - I agree,
10:46 - I think it's really lovely watching people
10:48 - interact in the community,
10:49 - over time especially,
10:51 - Bella I'm curious what were
your early experiences like?
10:55 - - My earliest experience
in the Scratch community
10:59 - was actually on my first day of Scratch,
11:01 - I remember when I first
opened up the create page
11:04 - and was about to make my first project,
11:06 - I had no clue how it works at all,
11:09 - there's a little yes right there,
11:11 - so the gray space is where you're supposed
11:14 - to drag the blocks and
put something together,
11:15 - but I just remember for
a solid 15 minutes trying
11:18 - to drag the blocks into the stage
11:21 - and that's not at all how it works,
11:23 - and I was extremely confused as
11:24 - to why nothing was happening,
11:27 - and then I went on the Scratch homepage
11:29 - and saw you can actually look
11:31 - at tons of different Scratchers projects,
11:33 - and see inside look at their code,
11:35 - and it's just extremely interactive,
11:37 - so I remember browsing
projects for a while,
11:39 - finally figuring out how it worked,
11:40 - and that's actually how I made
my very first Scratch friend,
11:44 - and yeah he actually
would give me feedback,
11:49 - I remember we would comment
on each other's profiles
11:50 - and ask how do you do this,
11:52 - help each other out,
11:54 - and actually on my first project
you can see he commented.
11:57 - - Yeah let's see,
12:00 - see project page.
12:03 - (audience laughs)
12:08 - - Great to have someone
right there supporting you.
12:11 - (audience laughs)
12:15 - - Speaking of which, we
were also looking at,
12:18 - JT now you just posted this even though--
12:21 - - Yeah it wasn't originally shared so
12:23 - I had to share it for this conference.
12:26 - - But I notice the comments
here are really sweet,
12:29 - LifaytheGoblin,
12:30 - if you don't know LifaytheGoblin's
12:32 - a pretty awesome Scratcher as well,
12:35 - did this keynote four years ago,
12:38 - left a comment, oh JT so cool.
12:40 - Did you know I made a disco
cat as a first project.
12:45 - So I'm curious, Bella you
mentioned your first friend,
12:49 - and we're seeing some
people here, on squares101,
12:51 - for example, so they're meeting
from the very beginning,
12:55 - from those early experiences
what made you keep coming back,
13:00 - you're mentioning feedback,
13:01 - what else was keeping
you in the community?
13:07 - - For me it was just how
supportive everyone was,
13:10 - and how friendly everyone was,
13:12 - it was just constant like
you said positive feedback,
13:18 - just everyone was so ready to help,
13:21 - and there are also these things
on Scratch called studios,
13:24 - and they're really fun,
13:26 - it's almost like a mini
website on Scratch,
13:29 - because you can add in your projects,
13:31 - there's a comments section,
13:32 - people can join and be creators,
13:35 - people can follow,
13:36 - it's like a mini community,
13:38 - and so there are just a lot of things like
13:40 - that that just help people
find similar interests,
13:43 - and talk to each other,
13:45 - this one's for shark week,
13:46 - you can see there's a description,
13:48 - people can share their projects,
13:49 - and just like little features like this
13:52 - on the Scratch website that are
13:54 - so different from everything else,
13:57 - because I always say this,
13:58 - a lot of people think of coding
as what they see in movies,
14:02 - when there's a hacker trying to get in
14:04 - and you see the lines of code,
14:06 - it's not always like that,
14:08 - and of course that is coding too,
14:10 - but just seeing something
like this that is young kids
14:15 - and adults alike programming
and forming community,
14:18 - it's just so different and
that's what kept me coming back,
14:22 - just having the space to share.
14:25 - - Yeah mine was pretty much the same,
14:26 - I started with Panel2C,
14:29 - it's another Scratch team member,
14:31 - he's a moderator, and he loved Pi Day,
14:33 - and he actually created
a Pi Day studio for 2014,
14:36 - and I helped him curate it for that,
14:39 - and it was just supercool seeing all
14:42 - the different people get super
excited about the same topic,
14:45 - like everyone that you didn't
14:47 - even know people from around the world,
14:48 - just coming together and
getting excited about one thing,
14:51 - and leaving comments,
14:53 - wow this is supercool, I love Pi
14:55 - everyone just getting
behind a similar topic
14:57 - it's something that was
just amazing to see.
15:01 - - And speaking of studios,
15:02 - about once every month we
have a Scratch Design Studio
15:06 - on the homepage with all
different types of products,
15:10 - this month we have symmetry,
15:11 - and we've been Scratch
Design Studio curators
15:13 - for a while the two of us,
15:15 - and it's been great seeing a variety
15:17 - of different projects but
Scratchers come up with
15:19 - with this one theme,
15:20 - we get collaborations,
we get solo projects,
15:23 - all kinds of different things
that people are making,
15:25 - and just another positive
community within the community.
15:29 - - Can you say more about what
a Scratch design curator is?
15:33 - - Yeah so Scratch Design
Studio curators are able
15:35 - to leave comments to other
Scratchers and add projects,
15:41 - so we basically lead the
Design Studio through
15:43 - more feedback and helping
each other along the way.
15:49 - - Yeah it's like a month long studio,
15:51 - it usually runs a month,
15:52 - and it's featured on the homepage,
15:54 - it's like the fourth row I think,
15:55 - and the website just
chooses random projects
15:58 - in the studio to be
featured on the homepage,
16:00 - which is really awesome
because it's a great way to--
16:02 - - All different perspectives.
16:03 - - Yeah it highlights the
other people's ideas and have
16:06 - your project able to be
seen by the people as well,
16:08 - so yeah it's just a month-long thing,
16:11 - people will come if
they link to the project
16:14 - you have added and then will
make sure it fits the theme,
16:17 - and then added and everyone really gets
16:18 - to join in on the experience.
16:21 - - Yeah I love seeing the projects
16:23 - that come in for the Design Studio,
16:26 - it's especially a fun way for
Scratchers who are looking
16:29 - for something to do if they're fairly new
16:32 - it's like a nice creative constraint
16:34 - to help people get started.
16:38 - Okay so how long have you
been Design Studio curators?
16:42 - - Probably about three or four years now.
16:46 - - Yeah four years for me.
16:47 - - Oh my gosh.
16:49 - And how has it evolved as
you've been participating in it?
16:54 - - It's just grown with
more and more projects
16:55 - and more and more users over the years,
16:58 - maybe it started off small with just over
16:59 - a hundred projects and now there's lots
17:02 - and lots of different projects,
17:03 - and each new one to me is like
17:05 - a whole new perspective
on the topic on there,
17:08 - so it's just great to see what different
17:09 - people's opinions are,
17:11 - what they think what they would
like to do with that topic,
17:15 - maybe it's something
they're really interested
17:16 - or maybe it's something they'd like
17:18 - to explore a little later,
17:20 - so it's just great to
see what they've made.
17:22 - - Yeah and we actually have
a forum for the curators,
17:24 - and we use that to help
decide the next theme,
17:26 - and it's like a really
fun experience being able
17:29 - to have to figure out a new theme
17:31 - that we haven't used before,
17:33 - you can imagine there's
over a hundred themes
17:35 - that we've had in the past,
17:37 - because every month a new
monthly activity for them,
17:40 - so it's really cool being able to be
17:42 - like okay here are some ideas,
17:43 - we have some drafted and
then choose by voting
17:44 - or any other discussion
topic in the forums,
17:48 - so it's really awesome too.
17:50 - - It's so cool how simple the theme is,
17:51 - like this one's just symmetry,
17:53 - the only guideline is to just to make
17:54 - a project that involves that,
17:55 - but you see 100+ projects
that are completely different,
17:59 - so unique,
18:01 - everyone's sharing and
there are so many different
18:04 - takes on the same idea which is so cool.
18:07 - - Yeah I see right there
just simple dots in the tree,
18:10 - and then up there there's like cats
18:12 - and characters and things,
18:14 - so it's a whole range
of different projects
18:17 - that Scratchers made.
18:20 - - I was gonna say that reminds me
18:22 - of another great thing
that comes with Scratch,
18:26 - which is the scene inside
which you mentioned how
18:28 - to being able to see
all the different style
18:29 - of code that people use,
18:31 - is just awesome,
18:32 - so there's multiple ways to
get to the same end on Scratch,
18:36 - with different pieces of code,
18:38 - some use long bits of code,
18:39 - some use short bits of code,
18:41 - but both ways get you there,
18:42 - and it's super cool to see the way
18:43 - that people approach different problems
18:45 - that they wanna achieve,
18:46 - so I think that's the coolest part,
18:47 - being able to see the other people's work.
18:50 - - And you've been showing some parts
18:51 - of the community on the website,
18:55 - what are some things that you're surprised
18:58 - that people don't know
about the community,
19:00 - from your experience,
19:02 - especially with the years
that you spent on the website?
19:09 - - I guess it's surprising to
a lot of people and to me,
19:13 - that we just all met
through this conference,
19:19 - but there are a lot of
Scratchers on the site
19:22 - that we become friends with,
19:26 - and that we've never met,
19:28 - we've never seen in person,
19:29 - but just through this love of coding
19:31 - and the love of this
website and community,
19:34 - we have such a strong connection,
19:37 - it feels like a crazy strong bond
19:40 - with someone that we've never met,
19:43 - and it can be such a
long journey together,
19:48 - I mean it feels like we've
been friends forever,
19:50 - just the other day I think,
19:53 - maybe like a month ago,
19:54 - the friend that I was talking about,
19:56 - my first Scratch friend
who I haven't talked
19:57 - to in quite a while,
19:59 - commented on my profile,
20:00 - hey, do you remember me,
20:01 - we met five years ago on this website,
20:04 - and I was like yeah I
do remember you you were
20:06 - a huge part of me getting
started on Scratch,
20:09 - and it's crazy because
that happens all the time,
20:12 - and I know both of you have talked
20:14 - about similar experiences where there will
20:16 - be people that you know
on the site for years,
20:19 - and you may not have met them,
20:21 - but it's just we are all
so passionate about this,
20:24 - and this is such a great community
20:26 - for people who are passionate about it,
20:28 - that it just creates something that you
20:31 - wouldn't think is possible,
20:32 - and it's surprising that it's so strong.
20:35 - - Yeah I'd say the same
thing as you would,
20:37 - so I've had lots of people come back
20:40 - and come to my profile like
hey, do you remember me,
20:43 - and I'm like of course I do,
20:45 - and we've been friends for quite a while,
20:47 - so it all starts always with a comment,
20:51 - or positive feedback
on somebody's profile,
20:53 - and then it expands,
20:55 - like we are giving
feedback back to theirs,
20:57 - and then it keeps going back and forth,
20:59 - it's like a chain and
just watching each other
21:01 - grow further and further
projects over the years,
21:04 - and then we've improved
a lot over the years,
21:07 - it's amazing to see how much
we can do with each other.
21:10 - - And I know that it's
super scary to release
21:11 - your kids onto a website
where they can talk
21:14 - to whoever they want around the world,
21:16 - but I promise it's super safe,
21:18 - we have a great moderation team that
21:20 - is looking over all the comments,
21:21 - and making sure everything is secure,
21:23 - you don't have to worry about that,
21:24 - so I think that's the coolest part,
21:26 - how you really don't have to
worry about people talking
21:29 - to anyone from across the world,
21:30 - the get exposed to all
these different cultures
21:32 - and backgrounds that they never would have
21:34 - had the chance to before,
21:35 - so that's probably the
best part in the community,
21:38 - being able to experience
all these new people
21:39 - that you would never
have met before Scratch.
21:42 - - And something so cool about Scratch,
21:44 - I mean there are so
many different projects
21:46 - you can make from games to animations,
21:48 - there are a lot of people who just use
21:50 - the Scratch editor to post,
21:51 - they draw different creative characters
21:54 - and they just post that
and it's just a picture
21:56 - with maybe a description of the character,
21:59 - there's a million different
creative things you can
22:00 - do no matter what your interests are,
22:02 - but one of my favorite things
are multi animator projects,
22:05 - and it's crazy to see so
many different Scratchers
22:09 - come together and work on one project,
22:12 - because a lot of them are music videos,
22:16 - they'll pick a song and a
bunch of different Scratchers
22:20 - will choose a little part,
22:22 - like maybe a verse or maybe a chorus
22:24 - and animate in their
style however they want,
22:26 - and then they just submit that,
22:28 - and then whoever is managing the project,
22:30 - will take all of that code,
22:34 - smash it together into one project,
22:37 - and then share it,
22:37 - so something like this,
22:38 - you see so many different animating cells,
22:40 - so many different Scratchers that worked
22:42 - on the project to create one final result,
22:45 - and it's just so cool that
we can do that on Scratch,
22:49 - I think it's amazing.
22:51 - - Shall we try this one,
22:52 - JT whispered to me he's like, "This one."
22:55 - - I remember this one this is a good one.
22:57 - - You wanna give an introduction
or shall I just play it?
23:00 - - I know it's a song,
23:01 - so basically most multi animator projects
23:03 - are based on a song,
23:04 - and it's all the different
people coming together
23:05 - and I think if you scroll down
23:06 - to the credits you'll see
the ads with each part,
23:10 - yeah there we go,
23:11 - so there's the different
Scratchers that worked
23:12 - on each part of the project,
23:13 - so if you wanna just give a little brief.
23:18 - - Okay do a brief play.
23:23 - (upbeat music)
23:34 - ♪ I can hold my breath ♪
23:41 - ♪ I can bite my tongue ♪
23:47 - ♪ I can stay away for days
if that's what you want ♪
23:56 - - The bottom right corner
showed that he person
23:59 - who worked on that part of the project.
24:02 - ♪ I can fake a smile ♪
24:07 - ♪ I can forge a laugh ♪
24:14 - ♪ I can dance and play the
part if that's what you ask ♪
24:21 - ♪ Give you all I am ♪
24:27 - - I hate to stop it, so enchanting.
24:29 - (audience applauds)
24:36 - - So that's an example of something,
24:38 - and then another one I
remember not too long ago
24:40 - we did this thing called
24:42 - I'd Like to Teach the World to Code,
24:44 - and a lot of people collaborated on art,
24:47 - and it was a parody of
24:49 - I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing,
24:53 - and we had a lot of Scratchers doing art
24:55 - and some of them sang the song,
24:56 - and it turned out really cool.
- Yeah it was really nice,
24:59 - I remember being part of the singing.
25:04 - mic was over there,
25:05 - I tried to be as far back as I could.
25:09 - It's one of the things I really love,
25:11 - also looking at in the community
25:13 - that Scratch members collaborate
on projects together,
25:16 - MAPs are just one example,
25:19 - some of the different
creative collaborations
25:22 - that have happened,
25:24 - there's collabs,
25:25 - that concept is the first
time I ever heard of it,
25:28 - when they work in small or large teams
25:31 - to work on a single project,
25:33 - there's role-playing games,
25:35 - are there some that I'm missing?
25:37 - - There's many groups of
people working together
25:39 - on something as you can imagine.
25:42 - - And remixing.
25:44 - - Yes.
25:46 - I love the remixed tree feature,
25:49 - you can click on it for that one.
25:51 - All the different branches of people.
25:56 - - Yes 71 pages.
26:00 - - Keep flipping.
26:01 - - So I think basically what you
guys are getting a feel for,
26:04 - how many different things
you can do in the community,
26:07 - it's easy to just imagine Scratch
as a programming language,
26:09 - because that's what it is at its core,
26:11 - but when you start
branching off into different
26:13 - areas of the website,
26:14 - there is truly many more
skills and experiences
26:17 - that you get for your students,
26:19 - so not only do they get
the primary experience,
26:21 - they also get working
together and problem-solving,
26:23 - and other things too,
26:24 - so it's not just a programming
element that they get,
26:27 - as soon as they enter the community
26:28 - there are so many more
valuable experiences
26:29 - that they can use.
26:34 - - That's very true,
26:36 - I mean obviously you don't have
26:37 - to be a student to be a Scratcher,
26:40 - anyone can go on this website
26:44 - and either teach themselves how to code,
26:46 - just browse round projects,
26:48 - but one thing that I advocate for
26:51 - is just getting Scratch
into more classrooms,
26:54 - because like you mentioned there are
26:56 - so many things that you
can get from Scratch,
27:00 - and from programming in general,
27:02 - but this is such a great website,
27:03 - so many different features,
27:04 - one of my favorite things is,
27:10 - and we were talking about this
27:11 - with the assembly studio earlier,
27:13 - you can have one concept and there's
27:14 - a million different ways that
someone can interpret it,
27:19 - a million different ideas
for that one concept.
27:22 - So one thing that's really cool is if kids
27:28 - use Scratch to do
presentations and projects,
27:32 - I meant we're all familiar
27:33 - with the classic
PowerPoint or poster board,
27:36 - but after a while sitting
through the same exact project,
27:40 - for a very long time in a classroom,
27:42 - it can get a little boring,
27:45 - but this is so engaging,
27:46 - because you can have the same topic
27:50 - that you're learning about in school,
27:52 - and kids can make a game about it,
27:54 - kids can make an animation about it,
27:55 - they can make slides on Scratch,
27:58 - and so I think that's just one way
28:00 - that Scratch can be used in the classroom,
28:03 - and there's so many other things
28:04 - that I think are great for students,
28:07 - teachers and then of course
anyone who wants to use Scratch.
28:11 - - I love how Scratch
is just so interactive
28:12 - especially for the classroom,
28:14 - so it's not like she was staying
28:16 - with the boring PowerPoints,
28:17 - it's just like here is this,
28:19 - here's this,
28:21 - here's this.
28:23 - - And then in Scratch you get 20
28:24 - to 30 completely different perspectives,
28:29 - maybe one student makes the game,
28:31 - once students does a PowerPoint,
28:33 - but it's completely interactive
28:35 - with other students in the class,
28:37 - maybe it poses a question for other people
28:39 - in the room to answer,
28:41 - so it would probably be an amazing tool
28:43 - to add to everybody's classroom.
28:45 - - Yeah there is actually a teacher here,
28:46 - I can't remember what her name was,
28:49 - but in a breakout session she was talking
28:50 - about how she posed her history teachers
28:53 - and her English teachers at school,
28:55 - and said hey if your students
turned in their report
28:57 - as a Scratch project would you accept it?
28:58 - And they're like hm, and
then they took a look
29:00 - at the website and what they could do
29:01 - and they were like, yeah I think I would,
29:03 - so that students could not
only get her class grade,
29:05 - but also their class great
using a Scratch project,
29:08 - so I think that was a really cool idea.
29:09 - - Yeah back in eighth grade
when I was in eighth grade,
29:11 - my history class,
29:14 - our teacher used to sometimes
give us an assignment,
29:16 - where it's like make a creative
thing about this topic,
29:20 - and then I had an account that
I used for school projects,
29:23 - and I did it with Scratch,
29:25 - and then the teacher would always
29:26 - be like wow this is so cool,
29:28 - different from everybody
else's piece of paper,
29:30 - this one is interactive,
29:31 - and the little dancing
character or something,
29:35 - makes it even more engaging
for people looking at it.
29:40 - - Yeah speaking of the
classroom I actually wanted
29:42 - to shift gears a little and talk
29:44 - about some of the things
you've been up to till now,
29:48 - I know Bella you've been doing
something with classrooms
29:51 - and clubs.
29:52 - - I've been teaching Scratch
for about four years now,
29:58 - currently I teach classes
of fourth and fifth graders,
30:04 - I have also worked with
seventh and eighth graders,
30:06 - there are some pictures from my classes,
30:09 - and it started with my brother's
in that photo right there,
30:13 - yet so his fourth-grade teacher actually,
30:17 - just to preface real quick,
30:19 - when I was in middle school
30:21 - we had these banking days every week,
30:23 - so it was just an hour in the morning
30:26 - on Fridays when teachers would meet,
30:28 - so students didn't have to come in to 9 AM
30:31 - so they would get an hour
to do whatever they want,
30:33 - and I would always go
into my elementary school
30:36 - and do community service before heading
30:38 - over to school at nine,
30:40 - and my brother's fourth-grade teacher,
30:41 - she's absolutely amazing,
30:43 - she is so great about
incorporating technology and art
30:49 - and just building an amazing classroom,
30:51 - so she offered to let me teach her class
30:55 - for an hour in the morning,
30:56 - teach her students how to code,
30:58 - and she used Scratch a
lot in her classroom,
31:02 - just after I would code she
would then use whatever lesson
31:06 - and say alright now go make
a Scratch project about it,
31:10 - and the kids loved it,
31:12 - so that was my first experience teaching
31:14 - in seventh grade with her.
31:16 - And then from there I started creating
31:18 - my own classes over at my middle school,
31:21 - just after school classes,
31:23 - and it's been amazing seeing kids getting
31:26 - so excited about programming,
31:28 - just the after-school classes were ones
31:32 - that they could sign up for,
31:33 - and you could see that I had
such a huge turnout this year,
31:36 - because there are so many kids
31:37 - that are getting engaged
with this website.
31:41 - - So I have kind of a long story
31:45 - but I'll try to make it short
with the time that we have,
31:48 - so back when I discovered
Scratch in sixth grade,
31:52 - I was also getting interested
in community service,
31:55 - my art teacher was
teaching us how to crochet,
31:57 - and I wanted to do some
crocheting for community service,
32:00 - so I started doing it for cancer patients,
32:02 - and then over the years I've been seeing
32:04 - these news stories and news articles
32:07 - about all the lack of technology,
32:10 - as I said I live in Richmond, Virginia
32:11 - in the inner city areas,
32:14 - so with combining those two passions,
32:17 - I ended up forming this
community initiative that I call.
32:20 - Got Tech Richmond,
32:22 - and what we do is we donate and deliver
32:24 - all the needed technology equipment
32:26 - to underserved and underfunded schools
32:28 - in the Richmond, Virginia area,
32:30 - we were able to donate around $30-$40,000
32:32 - worth of technology so far,
32:34 - so it's been an amazing experience,
32:36 - and we also teach and
learn to code classes
32:38 - at some of the schools,
32:41 - we have a picture of that in there.
32:43 - - Jocelyn in action.
32:45 - - So yes we use Scratch,
32:47 - and this was a school called
Swansborough Elementary School,
32:50 - and the students were super into it,
32:52 - but I have a couple of specific stories
32:54 - with the students there,
32:56 - so there was these third graders,
32:57 - we were teaching them how
to make dance projects,
33:00 - a little girl jumped up on her desk,
33:04 - started dancing with her character,
33:06 - and she was like, I did it, I did,
33:09 - it was so cute,
33:11 - and I was like yes this
student is beginning
33:13 - to share a passion with computer science,
33:15 - exactly what I wanted to do,
33:17 - and then at the same time
there was a fifth grade girl,
33:21 - I was just talking at the end,
33:23 - okay we're closing this,
33:24 - she ran up to me and just
give me a hug from behind,
33:27 - and then a little boy right next
33:28 - to me just started going, "I love coding."
33:31 - And that same school started
a weekly coding club,
33:36 - and they're still going
with the coding club,
33:38 - and it's amazing what's happened with it.
33:41 - - It's definitely exciting
I'm sure we all feel this,
33:43 - that when we introduce
or support other students
33:46 - there's that high that happens
33:48 - you see them have those aha moments,
33:50 - but I've never had a
dancing on the table moment.
33:54 - - You'll get there.
33:56 - - It's something to aspire to.
33:58 - (audience laughs)
34:00 - (audience applauds)
34:05 - I'll hand over to you JT.
34:09 - - So I'm a part of the
Chem Club at my school,
34:12 - I know, Chem Club, not
really computer science,
34:14 - but we do outreaches at our
local elementary school,
34:17 - and they have a science club there,
34:20 - so I actually introduced Makey Makey to that,
34:22 - so I figured you can add a little science
34:24 - to that with the whole
electricity and circuitry thing,
34:27 - so we just basically
have the kids go around
34:30 - and just have some fun activities,
34:32 - like teaching them about conductivity
34:33 - and non-conductive objects,
34:35 - we had plastic and tinfoil,
34:38 - so which one would be conductive,
34:39 - and then at the end we had a
a whole Dance Revolution game,
34:43 - and we put tinfoil on the floor,
34:45 - and then they could do Dance Revolution
34:46 - with the Scratch project
which is really cool,
34:48 - and then we all joined hands,
34:50 - and we had the Scratch cat meow
34:53 - whenever our hands were joined,
34:54 - because the electricity
would actually travel
34:56 - through the whole circle of us,
34:59 - and as soon as someone broke the link,
35:00 - then the circuit will break,
35:01 - and the Scratch cat would stop meowing,
35:03 - so it was supercool seeing
them all being like,
35:05 - breaking hands and coming back and then
35:07 - it would never play because
everyone was breaking hands,
35:10 - so basically that's 80
ways to incorporate Scratch
35:14 - and other things into different
local elementary schools
35:17 - and other initiatives in your community.
35:21 - - I'm curious,
35:22 - so we're about to open it for questions,
35:23 - so this is your chance to ask a Scratcher,
35:27 - I'm gonna have one more question
and then I'll open it up,
35:32 - we're gonna throw this around
and we'll see how it works.
35:36 - - I stopped it don't worry.
35:38 - - So I want to ask Bella,
35:39 - so when I started
introducing many years ago,
35:45 - when I started introducing
people to Scratch and coding,
35:48 - I was really excited about it,
35:49 - they're gonna love it because I love it,
35:53 - and sometimes I would have success
35:54 - and sometimes I would not have success,
35:57 - I definitely had a workshop
where someone said I hate this,
36:01 - I was like I'm doing it all wrong.
36:05 - I'm curious have you run into challenges
36:08 - and what are those challenges look like,
36:10 - and what have been your strategies,
36:14 - what's one challenge
that you've encountered?
36:16 - - Yeah so for me I know
that the way I do it,
36:19 - and it is similar to the
way that I know Sarah
36:21 - and her session with Scratch for big kids
36:23 - they had a similar approach,
36:24 - and it was about find
something on the website,
36:27 - and you definitely can,
36:28 - over 30 million projects I promise,
36:30 - that interests the students,
36:32 - so just have them be
like what is your hobby,
36:33 - what do you love to do,
36:34 - sports, games, whatever,
36:36 - and then just search for it,
36:37 - you'll find a project with it,
36:39 - I know you will,
36:40 - and then just show them that project
36:41 - and they'll be much more
perceptive to wanting
36:43 - to learning code when they see
36:45 - that they can actually do
things that interest them,
36:47 - as opposed to a blank screen
with the Scratch logo on it,
36:50 - which we all love I know,
36:52 - but sometimes it's a
little daunting seeing just
36:53 - a blank plate and having to
start from the beginning,
36:57 - at that age,
36:58 - and so when they actually see
something that's finished,
36:59 - and they know what they can achieve
37:01 - and be capable of on the website,
37:02 - it's much more easy for them to jump
37:04 - in and get excited about it.
37:06 - - Yeah and as JT might
have been mentioning
37:09 - a little bit earlier,
37:10 - there's all different
ways to code a project,
37:12 - there's not just one correct answer,
37:14 - you can get super creative with
37:16 - all your different ways
of doing the projects,
37:19 - and so I always tell people that debugging
37:22 - takes a lot of practice,
37:24 - coding can also be like
learning a language or an art,
37:29 - and learning a language and art takes
37:30 - a lot of practice before
you start getting bigger
37:33 - and better until you grow,
37:35 - and eventually you'll be amazing,
37:37 - but you're not gonna
be perfect right away,
37:39 - so you just have to keep trying.
37:42 - - Yeah it's all about showing
especially with younger kids,
37:45 - that coding there are
so many different things
37:49 - that you can do with it that
appeal to different interests,
37:52 - I know there's a lot of
cool programs out there such
37:56 - as Girls Who Code who just
encourage different people
38:00 - to try coding even if they don't think
38:02 - that they're gonna like it,
38:04 - I know that in my seventh
and eighth grade class
38:07 - it was a class of all boys,
38:10 - but the most recent class that I have,
38:14 - I was so excited because it is
38:16 - I think more girls if not an equal amount,
38:20 - which is so big,
38:22 - because just getting girls into coding,
38:24 - because they might think it's a guy thing,
38:27 - even though it's not,
38:28 - so just being able to break
that stereotype and show them,
38:33 - and they get so excited
about it every time
38:34 - I show them a funny project,
38:36 - a funny animation or a cool game,
38:39 - we start out with really
simple animations,
38:42 - that's always the first lesson,
38:43 - how do you put the blocks together,
38:44 - how do you make a dog
chasing a cat on loop,
38:47 - stuff like that,
38:50 - but then when I show them different
38:52 - things that they can start building up to,
38:55 - they get so excited,
38:57 - like you don't just stop at,
38:59 - okay I'm in elementary
school I started learning
39:02 - this and am gonna ditch
Scratch and go to other stuff,
39:05 - there's actually a lot of people
39:07 - on the site who code for a living,
39:09 - professional programmers,
39:11 - who still use Scratch,
39:11 - and they make crazy games,
39:13 - I know there have been people
39:15 - that code Minecraft on Scratch,
39:18 - they make Minecraft for Scratch,
39:20 - just using their own methods to code it,
39:24 - so when kids,
39:25 - especially young kids
that are so into gaming,
39:27 - and just different things,
39:29 - when they see what they can
eventually learn how to do,
39:32 - they get so excited about it,
39:34 - so I think the biggest strategy would
39:35 - just be show them all
the different projects,
39:38 - show them simple ones that will start
39:39 - by learning how to make,
39:40 - and show them more complex ones that might
39:42 - take a while but they're gonna
be so excited to get there.
39:45 - - Yeah teaching them how
to make different projects
39:46 - from Scratch no pun intended.
39:50 - - I know that we love to talk about
39:51 - wide walls, which is a
great part of Scratch,
39:54 - but there is also a high ceiling
39:55 - that is often not talked about,
39:56 - because you're always gonna have
39:58 - that one kid who more excels,
40:00 - and you have to show him that there's
40:00 - so much that he can still do,
40:03 - there's never really a top layer,
40:05 - you're never gonna be done with Scratch,
40:07 - you can always keep going and creating
40:09 - and imagining and sharing.
40:12 - - Exactly.
40:13 - - As we are the Scratch community.
40:16 - Do you wanna do the thing?
40:18 - A group selfie?
40:19 - - Yeah to we wanna take a group selfie?
40:22 - - Okay alright.
40:25 - - Oh we don't have a phone, so.
40:27 - (audience laughs)
40:31 - (audience applauds)
40:39 - - I don't have long arms, so
you're gonna have to do it.
40:44 - - You all wanna try and squeeze in?
40:48 - - That should do it.
40:50 - (audience applauds)
40:57 - - Would someone like to ask a question?
41:00 - Okay I'm gonna throw it
slowly and we'll just like.
41:05 - (mumbles)
41:06 - (laughs)
41:11 - - Bottom one.
41:13 - (audience applauds)
41:17 - - I wanted some tips,
41:18 - oh this actually is a microphone.
41:21 - (audience laughs)
41:23 - - Yes it is.
41:24 - - I wanted to make some tips on how
41:26 - to make these multi-animator games,
41:28 - the process of doing this,
41:31 - how could you do it?
41:33 - - So I think the way that most people
41:33 - do it is they find a song,
41:35 - or anything that really interests them,
41:38 - it's usually a song,
41:39 - and dividing the song into parts,
41:41 - you can do it by verses,
41:42 - in verses of two or three or however many,
41:45 - so I guess finding a lyric
video or a lyric project,
41:48 - have people to be able to
see the words in the song,
41:50 - and then having people to be
able to come and pick parts,
41:53 - so I'd like to do these verses,
41:54 - I'd like to do these verses,
41:56 - and then first come first serve basis
41:58 - and then given a week
or however long you want
42:02 - to let them make their animation,
42:04 - and then they'll share it,
42:05 - and then you just pull all their sprites
42:08 - and backdrops into the same project,
42:10 - so it's a little bit more
work on the owners part.
42:12 - - That's the part I'm confused about.
42:15 - How do you mash them all together?
42:17 - - So you can use your backpack,
42:21 - it's like a feature on Scratch,
42:22 - if you wanna show it real quick.
42:25 - - A little thing underneath.
42:28 - - You have to sign in.
42:29 - - You have to sign in to see it.
42:31 - There's like a little
arrow on the bottom there.
42:33 - - So basically the backpack is a way
42:34 - if you add another person's
project you can take
42:37 - one of their sprites or backdrops
42:38 - and just open up the backpack down there,
42:41 - and then drag the sprite
into your backpack,
42:46 - so now if you reopen up another project,
42:49 - and then go into your backpack,
42:50 - that sprite will be there.
42:52 - - And all the coding.
42:53 - - And all the code with it.
42:55 - - I'll just put in some blocks here
42:56 - and try to get it for you.
42:58 - - So now she goes to another project.
43:01 - - I need to open a new one.
43:04 - - And she can drag the code in
and there's the box with it.
43:08 - - So a lot of times people will share
43:10 - one initial project
saying here's the idea,
43:12 - here's the concept, the song I wanna use,
43:14 - it doesn't have to be a song,
43:16 - you can also make a story in animation
43:17 - and have people do different
parts of the plotline,
43:20 - just things like that,
43:21 - but they'll say, okay, here
are the different parts,
43:24 - comment if you want one of them,
43:26 - and then I usually would make a studio
43:29 - and just have everyone
post their parts in there,
43:33 - that way I can just easily
go into all of them,
43:35 - again there's a really
cool see inside button
43:39 - and all the projects that
is super easy to find,
43:41 - but for this you just dragged
sprites in the JT said,
43:45 - and then you have
everything in your backpack
43:48 - to just drop into your final project
43:49 - that you're gonna share.
43:50 - - And just troubleshooting real quick,
43:52 - I know I had this problem
when I was using it,
43:53 - if you have two tabs open,
43:55 - and you drag something to
the backpack On one tab,
43:57 - you have to refresh the
other tab for it to show.
43:59 - Just a little troubleshooting.
44:02 - - One thing I would add,
44:04 - is that one thing I also
love about the community
44:06 - is that they create all kinds
of tutorials about things,
44:08 - so is Scratchers have created
a how to make a map tutorial,
44:11 - they can just google as well.
44:13 - - Yeah I'm sure you'll find one.
44:14 - - Take all the notes,
44:15 - so I see a hand up here,
44:19 - so shall we pass over in this direction?
44:21 - - And while we're throwing that,
44:23 - I wanted to mention.
44:25 - (audience laughs)
44:29 - Back when I was a virtual camp counselor
44:31 - for some of these camps,
44:32 - I used to make tutorials
for each stage of the way
44:34 - to show Scratchers of different things
44:36 - that they could do with each step,
44:38 - there was an art part,
44:40 - and I showed them how to
do different types of art,
44:42 - there was an animation part
so I showed them different
44:45 - types of animation,
44:46 - I liked getting feedback
from the Scratchers
44:48 - on all different things
that they've done with them.
44:50 - - Yeah never hesitate to ask anyone,
44:51 - because everyone will be more than happy
44:53 - to explain to you, so if you
just wanna leave a comment,
44:55 - how did you do this,
44:56 - everyone loves to talk
about their work too.
45:01 - - Hi, how would you change school
45:06 - in general given your experience,
45:07 - I mean in a general way,
45:10 - from the beginning,
45:11 - rethinking school given your experience?
45:14 - - That's a really great question.
45:15 - - That's a good question.
45:18 - - So for me at least,
45:19 - I know for me creative learning
45:21 - is so much more powerful
than conventional learning
45:24 - that we have in classrooms today,
45:26 - so notes on a PowerPoint are great,
45:27 - but getting a more creative aspect
45:29 - is so much more powerful and so much
45:31 - more meaningful to the student,
45:33 - so Scratch is a wonderful way to do that,
45:36 - if you wanna have them make a game
45:37 - about the subject that their learning,
45:39 - it's so much more memorable
and easy to learn,
45:42 - way more than just taking notes,
45:44 - and it's much more easy
to engage the students,
45:46 - that are less wanting to learn.
45:50 - - Exactly hands-on
learning is a lot of fun,
45:52 - and I always use this as an example,
45:55 - shout out to my English teacher Mr Crosby,
46:00 - I have a bunch of teachers
that do things like this,
46:02 - which is just awesome,
46:03 - but rather than just
standing up at the board
46:06 - and giving a lesson had
having students take notes,
46:09 - he designs different projects
46:11 - and activities where we're giving,
46:14 - just touched my mic,
46:15 - we're giving ourselves
the answer we're finding
46:17 - the information for ourselves,
46:18 - and then will have a classroom discussion,
46:21 - so things like that where the students
46:24 - are really discovering
things and getting engaged,
46:27 - Scratch is a great tool for that,
46:30 - there are plenty of different activities
46:31 - that teachers can come up with,
46:33 - I think that's something that will get
46:35 - all students super interested in learning
46:38 - and just having fun with it.
46:41 - - Yeah and I like the community
and collaborative aspects
46:42 - of it being brought into classrooms,
46:46 - so this morning I saw
a tweet from a teacher
46:49 - saying about different perspectives,
46:52 - like if you have a
question you should share
46:53 - it with the world,
46:55 - share it with the rest of
your class before asking,
46:57 - you can get all answers
and perspectives out of it,
47:00 - and that applies to Scratch definitely,
47:02 - as we're talking about
studios and Design Studios,
47:05 - just that one topic,
47:07 - there were so many expensive varieties
47:09 - of different projects
you could make out of it.
47:13 - - Thank you.
47:15 - - I see, toss it on the other side,
47:18 - other side here.
47:22 - Back there.
47:26 - - Back there yeah.
47:32 - (audience applauds)
47:37 - - Hi thank you for sharing,
47:39 - what I wanna know is
when is sharing too much,
47:43 - so you made a friend from way back when,
47:45 - but do you tell them more
information about you,
47:48 - when do you start to make
a non-anonymous community?
47:55 - - So I would you say again,
47:57 - Scratch is super safe,
47:59 - there's no phone numbers
there is no emails,
48:01 - you won't even be allowed to post it,
48:03 - they won't let me post anything,
48:05 - so I guess,
48:08 - I don't really know if
there is a fine line,
48:11 - if you wanna share what you
cooked that morning go ahead
48:12 - and share what you cooked that morning,
48:14 - whatever you wanna share.
48:16 - - The sky is the limit.
48:18 - - Yes I would say you
don't have to worry about,
48:22 - I wouldn't share any personal information,
48:23 - but half the time you
won't even be allowed
48:25 - to share it in the first place.
48:26 - - Yeah it usually doesn't come up,
48:27 - we're all so excited to
talk about programming
48:30 - different interests we
have outside of that,
48:32 - it's never been an issue
of safety or privacy,
48:39 - it's a very safe site for all.
48:46 - - Anybody else have any questions?
48:49 - - I have a quickie thank you,
48:51 - it was really great to
see your first projects,
48:54 - I'm super curious hearing how
48:56 - your identities have developed,
48:58 - what are you working on right now?
49:02 - - What am I working on right now?
49:03 - For me I'm trying to take the curriculum
49:05 - in the elementary schools
like 3rd to 5th grade,
49:08 - and giving that unit a Scratch project
49:11 - they can present to their class,
49:13 - so basically incorporating
creative learning into it,
49:16 - so I know for solids and
liquids and gases I've created
49:18 - a little project that hasn't matured yet,
49:21 - but it's the different types
of cells and liquids and gases,
49:24 - and then there is a game
that goes along with it,
49:26 - and different ways to be creative,
49:28 - so that's what I'm doing.
49:29 - - I'm not really working on any specific
49:30 - Scratch projects right now,
49:32 - but I'm still working to expand my learn
49:34 - to code classes to different
elementary schools this year,
49:38 - with my final year in
high school coming up,
49:42 - I'm gonna expand to more
elementary schools in my area,
49:48 - show them the different aspects,
49:49 - I like to always end my
learn to code classes
49:51 - with a community aspect,
49:53 - I tell the students go ahead and make
49:55 - a studio and leave a comment
on each other's projects,
49:57 - and it's just great to
see each other's reactions
49:59 - when they refresh the page,
50:01 - they're like, wow, I got a love,
50:03 - and this is really cool here's
how you can improve, comment,
50:07 - and I'm gonna work to keep adding that
50:09 - to the classes more and more
so it's not just project-based,
50:12 - it's also peers and collaboration based.
50:16 - - Yet I'm definitely gonna
continue teaching Scratch,
50:19 - but I also wanna start doing more things,
50:22 - there are pictures from a Scratch Day
50:25 - that I did two years ago,
50:27 - it was a small thing in our computer lab
50:31 - that got kids interested
in joining the class,
50:35 - but I wanna keep making it bigger,
50:37 - I think about doing something that
50:38 - my entire community can participate in,
50:41 - I also wanted to just try to get Scratch
50:47 - into more classrooms,
50:49 - when I was in eighth
grade I presented to some
50:52 - of the teachers at my
school and just talked
50:54 - about how important it is to get coding
50:58 - and those skills into classrooms
51:01 - and how they can use Scratch to do that,
51:03 - and since then I know the robotics program
51:05 - is now using Scratch
at my elementary school
51:08 - they started using Scratch
and more classrooms,
51:11 - but I want to continue pushing
to get more people involved,
51:15 - and just show different people
51:18 - that didn't know Scratch existed,
51:20 - hey here's a cool program
that you can create things on,
51:26 - so I just wanna reach out to more people,
51:28 - do some really cool
projects coming up, yeah.
51:34 - - Question.
51:36 - - About five minutes anyway.
51:37 - - There's a question over there.
51:39 - - Okay let's see.
51:44 - - So close.
51:46 - - I'm just curious like
you grew up with Scratch
51:48 - learning to code on Scratch,
51:50 - has anybody of you learnt any
other programming language,
51:53 - and if so how has Scratch helped you
51:55 - with that getting started?
51:57 - - Yes Scratch introduced me to
my love of computer science,
52:01 - from Scratch I started
working on Khan Academy,
52:05 - which is another great website
52:07 - for more line based programming,
52:09 - and there I started learning JavaScript,
52:13 - and also on the website
Scratch is also open source,
52:16 - open source on GitHub,
52:19 - so you can go and help
contribute their which
52:21 - is a great way to practice the skills
52:22 - that you've learned in
a real-world setting,
52:25 - so I've been trying to
help out around GitHub,
52:27 - and they use React JS and
HTML and CSS and all that.
52:32 - - Yes after I discovered Scratch
52:33 - I've tried some other languages,
52:35 - line based like he was saying,
52:37 - I've also done some game
and animation coding,
52:40 - I've done some computer science
summer camps over the years,
52:44 - some overnight, some local,
52:45 - all different kinds,
52:46 - and then eventually ended
up going to a high school
52:50 - that has a specialty program known
52:52 - as the Center for information technology
52:54 - with computer science-based courses,
52:57 - like AP computer science and
computer science principles,
53:02 - and programming courses
and a web design course,
53:05 - from there I'm hoping to double major
53:07 - in computer science and digital media arts
53:09 - when I get to college.
53:12 - - There are tons of different resources
53:13 - out there to learn new
programming languages,
53:16 - I know I learned
JavaScript on Khan Academy,
53:19 - just so many different
ways that you can learn,
53:22 - and just starting on Scratch
helps you to do that,
53:28 - because you just are able to learn
53:31 - so simply the different concepts,
53:36 - the way you have to
think to be able to code,
53:39 - obviously it escalates from there,
53:43 - you can keep doing work on Scratch,
53:45 - but just being able to
learn how coding works,
53:49 - what does a loop do,
53:51 - how do you put things in a forever block
53:52 - and why does that work,
53:54 - how does that work,
53:56 - especially with young kids,
53:57 - having them understand the concepts first,
54:00 - before moving onto anything else,
54:02 - they can easily learn any
programming language they want,
54:05 - so quickly just by learning this first.
54:07 - - And I know that we all agree on this,
54:09 - Scratch is a real language,
54:11 - it is a real programming language,
54:12 - don't think that it's a stepping stone
54:14 - onto bigger and better things,
54:16 - if anything I'd say it's
probably more powerful
54:17 - than other programming languages,
54:19 - because you have a much easier element
54:20 - of sharing to the community
and world around you,
54:23 - so don't get confused on that.
54:29 - - So we have time for
one very quick question,
54:33 - Sorry.
54:38 - Go for it.
54:50 - - Good throw.
54:51 - - There we go.
54:54 - - So my question is sometimes
students are reluctant
54:57 - to share and to get
involved in the community,
55:01 - can you talk about some good
steps to encourage them,
55:04 - or first steps to encourage them
55:05 - to start getting involved in the community
55:07 - so they can start getting
that kind of feedback
55:09 - that got you going?
55:11 - - Scratch Design Studio,
55:13 - for sure I would introduce them
55:14 - to the Scratch Design Studio,
55:15 - it's right on the homepage,
55:16 - it's a really amazing way to
interact with other people,
55:18 - get a feel for joining the community
55:20 - and having conversations
with another Scratcher,
55:23 - and having your project get exposure to,
55:26 - other people being able to see it
55:27 - and leave comments and
loves and favorites,
55:29 - so that would be my suggestion,
55:31 - Scratch Design Studio.
55:32 - - And also making their own studio,
55:34 - with their own interests,
55:35 - whether that's music or
animals or something specific
55:39 - or something else really broad,
55:41 - they can just make a studio,
55:42 - and find kids in their
class that agree with them
55:45 - and they can get in smaller
groups and collaborate with them
55:48 - and that gets them
started with the community
55:51 - part of people that share
a passion with them.
55:53 - - Exactly,
55:54 - looking at all of the
different projects on Scratch,
55:57 - obviously having to do
with their interests,
56:00 - and things that maybe
they are interested in,
56:02 - and the just wanna see what
other people are making,
56:04 - and then looking through the comments,
56:06 - 'cause I know so many
projects have thousands
56:09 - of comments with positive
feedback with critiques
56:15 - and just stuff like that,
56:16 - so being able to see other people
56:18 - are sharing their projects,
56:19 - whether there's simple or complex,
56:21 - and people are having
such positive reactions,
56:24 - yet just seeing that I
think will really encourage
56:28 - them and get them excited to
experience it for themselves.
56:31 - - Yes sometimes the easiest way to have
56:33 - a conversation is to start a conversation,
56:35 - just have them leave a comment,
56:36 - leave a love,
56:37 - and it will flourish from there.
56:40 - - It's a really nice sentiment to end on,
56:46 - unfortunately we're out of time,
56:49 - but they've offered to
stay here for a little bit
56:51 - if you wanna ask more questions.
56:53 - - Right here on the stage.
- Right here on the stage,
56:56 - and throughout the rest of the day,
57:01 - you can also find them on Scratch,
57:04 - and thank you all for your questions,
57:07 - and let's thank the three
of them for joining us.
