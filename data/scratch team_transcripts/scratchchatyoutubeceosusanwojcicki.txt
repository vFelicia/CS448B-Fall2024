00:00 - (upbeat music)
00:05 - - I'm so glad to be here.
00:06 - And Scratch is such a wonderful way
00:08 - for people to learn computer science.
00:10 - When they first get started,
I've been a big supporter
00:13 - and I've used it myself and
I see how effective it is.
00:17 - So I'm very glad to be here today.
00:19 - - Wonderful.
00:20 - Well, I'll start off.
00:21 - My name is Shawna Young.
00:22 - I'm the Executive Director
for the Scratch Foundation.
00:25 - We're one of the largest coding platforms,
00:28 - free coding platforms
for kids in the world
00:30 - to learn how to code creatively.
00:32 - Actually, Scratch is
founded about 15 years ago.
00:34 - We're actually celebrating
our 15th anniversary
00:37 - and birthday next week.
00:39 - It spins out of-
00:41 - - Congratulations.
00:42 - - Thank you so much.
00:43 - Thank you so much.
00:43 - Our founder, Mitch Resnick
is a professor at MIT
00:47 - and it came out of MIT's
Lifelong Kindergarten
00:49 - group at Media Lab.
00:51 - And so a lot has been done
over the last 15 years.
00:54 - Thank you.
- A lot.
00:56 - - A lot, actually last year,
00:59 - over 42 million kids
made projects on Scratch,
01:02 - made over 114 million projects.
01:05 - - Wow.
01:06 - - We thought those are great numbers,
01:08 - big numbers until Susan.
01:10 - Susan Wojcicki, thank you
so much for joining us today
01:12 - as CEO of YouTube.
01:14 - The largest digital platform
for people around the world
01:18 - with over 2 billion users.
01:20 - So welcome, Susan, to
the Scratch community.
01:24 - - Sure, I'm so glad to be here.
01:25 - I love Scratch and I love
that people are using it
01:29 - and learning about it on YouTube.
01:32 - - Absolutely.
01:33 - I'd love to just jump right
in 'cause we have questions
01:36 - from our Scratchers.
01:37 - I love that you call
your creators, creators.
01:40 - So really I guess our
Scratchers are also creators
01:44 - and I'd like to start
with asking you a question
01:49 - about how has learning changed on YouTube
01:52 - since the pandemic,
01:53 - which has really happened over
the last two plus years now.
01:57 - Have you seen change in
terms of learning on YouTube
01:59 - due to the pandemic?
02:01 - - Sure.
02:02 - Well, we've definitely seen people
02:03 - learning a lot more on
YouTube than ever before.
02:06 - And learning and YouTube have
so much potential together.
02:14 - I think about YouTube a lot
of times as like a library
02:17 - where anyone can go, that's free,
02:19 - it's a video library and you
can learn pretty much anything
02:22 - that you wanna learn.
02:24 - And people have always known about it
02:27 - and people always come up
02:28 - and tell me about what
they learned on YouTube.
02:29 - And I love hearing those
stories, but during the pandemic,
02:32 - when people were at home
02:33 - and they didn't have as many
opportunities to go out,
02:37 - we saw a lot of people come to YouTube
02:39 - and choose to learn something new.
02:41 - And a lot of people have
shared those stories,
02:43 - whether it was like baking
bread or doing an art project,
02:49 - a skill like playing in an instrument.
02:51 - So we definitely saw a lot more people
02:53 - continue to innovate and
learn new skills on YouTube
02:59 - and be very creative.
03:00 - People also had to learn new
skills because a lot of times
03:03 - they were doing something
for the first time.
03:05 - Like they could just go to
the supermarket as easily.
03:07 - And so they would be like,
"Oh no, I'll bake a cake.
03:10 - I need a recipe.
03:12 - How do I do that?"
03:13 - Or "I wanna try fixing
something in my house.
03:17 - And normally I would've called
someone to come and fix.
03:19 - And now I'm..."
03:20 - So we saw people really use
YouTube to be able to expand
03:24 - what they were learning and growing.
03:25 - And we're very committed
to learning on YouTube
03:28 - and continuing to grow all the content.
03:30 - We talk about Ed YouTubers
03:32 - who are doing educational content
03:35 - and we're hopeful to continue to invest
03:38 - and to grow our Ed YouTuber community.
03:41 - - I appreciate that.
- I know
03:43 - you had tremendous growth too,
03:45 - that a lot of people during
the pandemic decided to code
03:49 - and learned to code.
03:50 - And I think that's just a
great example of how people
03:53 - had more free time and
they could use YouTube.
03:55 - So I'd love to hear what did
you see during the pandemic
03:58 - and how did your channel
change over that time?
04:01 - - Yeah, absolutely.
04:02 - Good questions.
04:03 - I have to tell you,
04:04 - actually I started at the Scratch
Foundation November, 2020,
04:06 - so I was one of the pandemic hires.
04:10 - And it's been a ride since then,
04:13 - but I really enjoyed
getting to know our team.
04:16 - And even I before started I
know for Scratch Foundation,
04:19 - we realized that we had
to do something different
04:21 - and we looked at our YouTube channel
04:23 - and Eric and Zoe on our team in particular
04:26 - saw that we had 8,000 subscribers.
04:28 - So with a lot of intention,
04:30 - a lot of new video and tutorials,
04:32 - and that's really what we use
04:33 - a lot of our YouTube channel
for is helping kids learn
04:35 - how to Scratch and how to make projects
04:39 - on the Scratch platforms for
Scratch and Scratch junior.
04:41 - And with their hard work and
the hard work of our team,
04:44 - we now have a hundred
thousand plus subscribers.
04:47 - So we have a creator
award which are really,
04:49 - really excited and proud about.
04:51 - I also have a letter from
you for our role, so.
04:55 - - Well, congratulations.
04:58 - - Thank you.
04:59 - Actually, some of our videos,
05:00 - including how to make a jumping game,
05:02 - how to make a catch game,
have over a million views.
05:05 - We've really seen even with
the recent travel I've done.
05:09 - I know that a lot of our Scratch
community has appreciated
05:13 - having our YouTube
channel as a way for them
05:15 - to learn how to use Scratch.
05:17 - So thank you for having us
05:18 - also be part of the YouTube community.
05:22 - - I'm so glad that
you've been able to grow.
05:25 - Scratch is a great way for
people to learn to code.
05:27 - I get that question a lot.
05:28 - Like how do I start?
05:29 - And it's great, kids a
lot of times wanna learn.
05:32 - So it's a really great way to start.
05:34 - And video is really a
wonderful teaching mechanism.
05:42 - People appreciate the fact
that they can just do it
05:44 - in their own time.
05:46 - And then if they don't
understand anything,
05:47 - they can play it again, play it again,
05:49 - like however many times, right?
05:51 - And they don't feel bad if they
need to play it many times.
05:58 - So we've definitely seen a lot of ways
06:02 - that video has enabled
learning in new ways.
06:04 - And I'm so excited to
see that with Scratch.
06:07 - There's a shortage of
teachers who can teach coding.
06:10 - And so the fact that you can
make it scalable and accessible
06:13 - to anyone no matter where they are,
06:15 - even if there's no coding
teachers in their area,
06:17 - they can use it with your
channel, which I love.
06:21 - So that's great to hear.
06:23 - And I'm so glad.
06:24 - Congratulations on your
growth during the pandemic.
06:29 - - Thank you.
06:30 - And you've been a huge supporter of video
06:33 - and education for years.
06:35 - And from doing research
on the work you've done,
06:37 - you were one of the people
who really convinced Google
06:39 - to buy or acquire
YouTube in 2006, I guess,
06:43 - which was right around the
time we started Scratch.
06:47 - - Definitely.
06:48 - I definitely saw the
potential for online video
06:51 - and I immediately saw it for learning too.
06:54 - People could suddenly learn
all kinds of new skills
06:59 - without really a teacher.
07:00 - And so I think about it a
lot as a library and people,
07:05 - wherever they are, can access it.
07:07 - And it's pretty incredible.
07:08 - We go a lot of times into
different communities
07:11 - where people didn't have
access to the internet before.
07:13 - And we asked them like,
07:14 - "What did you do when you had internet?"
07:16 - We'll give them access to the
internet with various tools.
07:20 - And a lot of times they're
using it to learn something new
07:23 - and to empower themselves in some way
07:26 - that they couldn't do before.
07:27 - So it's definitely been great
to see just the way that
07:31 - the internet and YouTube have
enabled a lot more education.
07:36 - - I have to tell you,
07:37 - I'm also one of those people who learned
07:38 - how to do air frying using
YouTube and things like that.
07:42 - So I think it is really been
insightful personally for me.
07:46 - And I appreciate it
07:47 - because actually when I was
also applying for the role,
07:49 - for Scratch Executive Director,
07:52 - I learned a lot through
being able to go to YouTube.
07:54 - So I really appreciate that.
07:57 - Yeah, I'd love to also jump in.
07:59 - We have questions from our
Scratches around the world
08:02 - and love to jump into that.
08:05 - Probably gonna give you
08:06 - some hard hitting questions to start.
08:08 - - Okay.
08:09 - - Not too hard.
- I'm ready.
08:11 - - Okay.
08:12 - Actually, google.org has been
a huge supporter of Scratch.
08:16 - And with our last grant,
08:18 - we actually were able to start
08:19 - the Scratch Education Collaborative.
08:21 - So it's a group of
organizations around the world
08:25 - that are really focused
on helping kids learn
08:28 - how to code creatively.
08:30 - Our first question is
actually coming from Nigeria.
08:32 - Fortune, who's part of
the Odyssey Foundation.
08:34 - And Nigeria has a couple
questions for you.
08:37 - - Hi, Fortune Sumuadina
and these are my questions
08:39 - for Susan, YouTube CEO.
08:40 - My first question is, did you,
08:43 - at some points have conflicting thoughts
08:45 - on the correct path you should follow?
08:47 - My second question is
how did your dream start?
08:50 - How did you become the YouTube CEO?
08:52 - And my third question is,
08:53 - were you discriminated gender-wise
08:55 - when it was clear that
you had interest in STEM?
08:59 - - Okay, those are great question.
09:02 - I love too that there are
three questions there,
09:05 - so I'll try to answer all of them.
09:07 - So the first question is,
09:11 - did I have any conflicting thoughts
09:13 - about the correct path
that I should follow?
09:16 - And I mean, I'll start by just saying that
09:19 - I didn't really have a clear path.
09:26 - The internet didn't
really exist as we know it
09:28 - until after I had already
graduated from college.
09:31 - So I was never thinking as a kid
09:35 - that I would work in
computers or in technology,
09:39 - it just wasn't that big a field.
09:41 - Really what I was
thinking was that I wanted
09:43 - to do something creative.
09:44 - I loved making things, building things.
09:49 - I loved Lego as a kid,
09:51 - I loved doing art projects
and I liked having impact
09:56 - and thinking about how
09:58 - what I did could have some positive impact
10:01 - on people all over the world.
10:02 - And what I saw is that as soon
as I discovered technology,
10:05 - when I was in my early 20s,
10:07 - I saw that this was a
way of making product
10:11 - and that people all over
the world would use it.
10:14 - And that is what really
inspired me is to...
10:16 - I actually started making
educational software.
10:19 - That was the first company I worked at.
10:20 - And then people all over would write to us
10:23 - and tell us how they had
used it and learned it.
10:25 - And that that's just when
I was hooked and said,
10:28 - I wanna continue to work in technology.
10:31 - And then the second question was,
10:33 - how did I become the YouTube CEO?
10:34 - Well, that's a good question.
10:38 - And a lot of people ask me,
10:39 - "Oh, wait, how did you get that job?"
10:41 - Well, I've been at
Google for 23 years now.
10:44 - I was at Google when it first started,
10:47 - when it had probably a lot fewer employees
10:49 - than Scratch does now.
10:51 - I was officially employee at 16.
10:53 - So I worked on many
products across Google,
10:55 - but I always was excited and passionate
10:58 - about video and saw the potential.
11:04 - Well, first of all, I did
really advocate when YouTube
11:06 - was really small for Google to buy it.
11:09 - It took a lot of investment.
11:10 - And so it was clear to YouTube
11:12 - that they needed a large partner.
11:14 - And I worked to convince
Google to be able to buy it
11:19 - and invest in it.
11:20 - And as soon as the CEO job opened up,
11:22 - I was very excited.
11:24 - And Larry, Founder, who's
the page of Google asked me,
11:26 - and I knew I had about one
second to think about it.
11:28 - That if I didn't say yes
right there on the spot,
11:30 - he would give it to someone else.
11:31 - So I immediately said, yes, and
it's been about eight years.
11:35 - So it's been great years.
11:37 - I've been really busy,
but very fulfilling.
11:39 - And I'm really glad
11:41 - that I've had this incredible opportunity,
11:43 - very honored to have this opportunity.
11:45 - - That's awesome.
- And then
11:47 - the last question was,
11:48 - have I ever felt discriminated
against gender-wise?
11:51 - And I would say, I'm sure
there have been many times,
11:57 - but this is something that is really hard.
12:00 - Sometimes you don't know,
like, is this discrimination,
12:03 - is this not discrimination?
12:05 - And so what I've really focused
on is just focused on trying
12:10 - to do the best job that I
can and getting what I need
12:14 - and making sure that my work is recognized
12:17 - when I need it to be recognized.
12:18 - So if I feel like, for example,
there's always the concern,
12:24 - like, are people listening
to you in the room?
12:27 - When you stand up and you speak
like, are you listened to,
12:29 - are you taken with the
same amount of seriousness?
12:32 - And so for example, like
something like that,
12:35 - I would just be really persistent.
12:38 - I encourage people to keep working at it.
12:40 - If I didn't think people had
registered what I had said,
12:43 - I would keep saying it.
12:45 - I would maybe say it in
a new and different way
12:46 - or say it to other people afterwards.
12:48 - And I'm sure there's always
12:52 - some amount of issues and
discrimination we all face.
12:56 - And there are many ways to deal with it,
12:57 - but certainly one trick
that will work for everyone
13:01 - is just to be really
persistent and to not give up
13:05 - and to believe in yourself and believe
13:07 - that if you have something
important to say, you say it
13:10 - and you keep going.
13:14 - So there's a lot more there,
13:17 - but I think if you keep working hard
13:22 - and speak up and believe in yourself,
13:26 - you'll get through a
lot of the challenges.
13:29 - - I really appreciate your response.
13:30 - It's to all three questions from Fortune.
13:32 - I can relate, I can relate a lot.
13:35 - And I think that you stand
13:37 - as an example for
children around the world,
13:40 - but especially girls around the world,
13:41 - that they can really
achieve anything they want.
13:44 - So I really appreciate
you sharing your thoughts,
13:47 - but also sharing some
of your personal story.
13:49 - Thank you, thank you for that, Susan.
13:51 - - Sure.
13:52 - - So we have another question
13:54 - from Odyssey Foundation, Nigeria,
and Joshua has a question.
13:57 - - My name is Joshua Chukwudi-Denis.
13:59 - I am 11 years old.
14:01 - I have two questions to
ask the CEO of YouTube.
14:04 - The first question is
who really motivated you
14:08 - to become who you are today
14:10 - and what challenges did you
face on your way to success?
14:15 - - Okay, so great questions.
14:17 - And the questions here
were what motivated me
14:24 - to become who I am today
14:25 - and what are the challenges
that I fact along the way.
14:30 - And yeah, I would say
it's hard for me to answer
14:33 - in terms of who inspired
me to be who I am today.
14:37 - And the reason is,
14:38 - is because I was very
early in the tech industry.
14:41 - And so when I first started,
14:44 - it wasn't clear what
technology was gonna be.
14:47 - The internet didn't really exist
14:50 - or at least not as we know it.
14:51 - And there weren't a lot of women either
14:56 - in those roles.
14:59 - But what inspired me
was just the fact that
15:01 - I loved creating product
and I loved having impact.
15:04 - And so the lesson that
I've taken away from that
15:08 - is to try to find something
that is meaningful to you
15:11 - in your life in terms
of what you're doing.
15:13 - And if you can,
15:15 - and it brings you a lot of satisfaction
15:18 - and you feel like you're doing
15:20 - something important and meaningful,
15:22 - it can help you get through
a lot of hard times.
15:24 - And so, yes, I definitely
had a lot of challenges.
15:27 - I can make a long list of the challenges.
15:32 - Certainly, lots of late nights
and long hours and travel
15:38 - that maybe wasn't always
easy for me to do.
15:43 - And there certainly were times
where things didn't go well,
15:46 - where we would launch a product
15:48 - and we would think it's gonna
do really well and it didn't.
15:50 - And so I've really encouraged
everyone to always,
15:56 - first of all, as honestly as you can,
15:59 - in terms of what's happening,
if something isn't working,
16:01 - acknowledge that, try to fix it
16:03 - and have a plan about
what you learn from that
16:06 - and how to do it differently next time.
16:07 - So that's one of my main
advice is just be very honest,
16:12 - and it's okay to make mistakes.
16:14 - It's good to learn from your mistakes
16:17 - and everyone makes mistakes.
16:20 - And the most important thing
is that you learn from them.
16:23 - So, but still I talk to lots of other CEOs
16:30 - of tech companies, we compare notes.
16:33 - I learned from them still.
16:37 - I certainly learned a lot
from the founders of Google
16:40 - and the first CEO of Google
16:45 - and continue to work with all my peers.
16:47 - I learned from my peers.
16:48 - So you can learn from everyone around you.
16:51 - And so I encourage all of you to look at
16:57 - who you wanna be like
and what you wanna do
17:00 - and see what you can learn from them.
17:02 - - Thank you, Susan.
17:03 - I also appreciate from
seeing a lot of the videos
17:06 - and interviews you've done is
like your passion for the work
17:09 - and the transparency
you have around the work
17:12 - you're doing on YouTube.
17:13 - So I think that also like ads
to what you've also shared.
17:17 - Thank you for that.
17:19 - Yeah, we're gonna move to New York,
17:21 - and actually hear a question from Enrique,
17:24 - who's part of deaf kids code in New York.
17:27 - - Hi, my name is Enrique.
17:30 - I'm 13 years old.
17:33 - I go to school at St.
Joseph's School for the Deaf
17:37 - in the Bronx, New York.
17:39 - I'm involved in Deaf Kids Code.
17:41 - DKC stands for Deaf Kids Code.
17:44 - I love technology.
17:46 - I can communicate with my
friends through FaceTime
17:50 - or texting with my friends.
17:53 - My one question for YouTube is do you have
17:59 - deaf people working at your company?
18:03 - - All right.
18:04 - Well, that was a great
question from Enrique.
18:06 - Thank you so much, Enrique.
18:08 - And yes, we definitely do have deaf people
18:11 - who are working at our company.
18:12 - And I would say there
are a number of people
18:15 - that I have personally
worked with over the years
18:19 - that I know are hearing impaired.
18:21 - And they've worked on a
broad set of functions
18:25 - at YouTube and Google.
18:27 - So definitely there
are lots of deaf people
18:29 - who are working at our company.
18:31 - And we recognize too that it's
really important for YouTube
18:34 - to support the deaf community
18:37 - and the hearing impaired community
18:40 - when they're watching videos too.
18:42 - And it's been really helpful for us
18:43 - to actually have employees at YouTube
18:47 - who can work with us on that
18:49 - and make sure that we are thinking
18:51 - about all the different ways that
18:53 - we can make YouTube accessible to everyone
18:55 - regardless of their disabilities,
18:57 - how YouTube could be accessible to them.
19:00 - So some of the things, for example,
19:02 - that we've worked on have been an effort
19:04 - to make sure that the captions
19:06 - are more available to everyone.
19:08 - And we've been working on
making sure that the captions
19:11 - are accurate for them.
19:13 - And that we recently
just did auto captions
19:16 - for any live stream that's in English.
19:18 - And we're planning to expand
that to a lot more languages.
19:22 - And we're also testing
something too for creators
19:27 - or for our visually limited community
19:35 - so that people could
actually have audio tracks
19:38 - on the videos to be able to hear
19:41 - what's actually happening in the video.
19:42 - So across various disabilities,
19:45 - we are definitely innovating
19:47 - and trying to make sure
that we satisfy that.
19:49 - And we find that a lot of times
19:52 - when we come up with a feature,
19:53 - actually, maybe it started
19:54 - because we are looking at some disability,
19:56 - but it turns out that that feature
19:58 - is actually really valuable for everyone.
20:01 - And so it makes our products
20:03 - better for the entire community.
20:05 - So I really encourage you to keep coding.
20:10 - I love that you're working
with Deaf Kids Code.
20:13 - I think technology is a great opportunity
20:16 - for people with all backgrounds.
20:18 - And there are many people
with many disabilities
20:20 - across Google and YouTube.
20:22 - So I encourage you to
keep up the good work.
20:25 - And thank you for the question.
20:27 - - Thank you, Susan.
20:28 - I appreciate that.
20:28 - Even at Scratch, we're
doing the same thing.
20:30 - We're thinking about how can
we increase accessibility
20:34 - on our platform.
20:35 - So just hearing the work
that YouTube is doing
20:37 - is really helpful too.
20:40 - So we have a question
actually from Mexico.
20:42 - Guillermo has a question from you
20:44 - from the organization called
20:45 - - Hi, Susan, I'm glad to meet you.
20:47 - I'm Guillermo and I'm from
Jalapa, Veracruz in Mexico.
20:51 - It would be an honor
20:52 - if you could answer to these questions.
20:54 - The first question is, okay,
20:57 - how do you organize your
time when you were a child
21:00 - to your business and time at school?
21:05 - - Okay. No, thank you for that question.
21:08 - And the question is about
how did I organize my time
21:13 - as a child between my
schoolwork and my business time.
21:17 - So thank you Guillermo for the question.
21:19 - And I would say that as a kid,
21:22 - I was lucky that most of my
time was focused on school
21:27 - and activities and doing
things with my friends.
21:31 - But I also did a lot of babysitting.
21:35 - I actually had a business
where I would sell handycrafts
21:40 - and sell it to the various neighbors
21:43 - and go around and make money that way.
21:47 - And so I would say that,
it's really important
21:52 - when you're young to really
focus on your studies
21:54 - and that is what's gonna help you in life,
21:58 - is to be a good student,
to be able to build skills.
22:01 - But it's also good to be
able to explore new things
22:04 - when you're young.
22:04 - You can create, you can
develop a lot of new habits,
22:07 - whether you're interested
in music or dance
22:10 - or computers or a sport.
22:14 - It's a great time to
be able to explore it.
22:16 - So I really encourage all the young people
22:19 - to do what you love as
well with the free time
22:26 - that you have, and really
invest in yourself.
22:29 - And I think that will pay
off for you over time.
22:33 - But I will say like having a job
22:35 - and doing work is a really
valuable skills too.
22:38 - Let you learn a lot about the world.
22:40 - You learn about being independent.
22:45 - But it's always a balance.
22:47 - Everything in life is a balance.
22:49 - You can do some work,
22:50 - but you also have to make
sure that you have enough time
22:52 - to do your studies and to be effective
22:56 - at school since that's what
will help you in the end,
22:59 - be able to achieve the job
and career that you want.
23:02 - So I encourage you to really
learn whatever you can,
23:09 - both at work and at school
and continue to grow,
23:13 - especially while you're young
23:14 - and be able to explore new areas.
23:18 - - I appreciate that answer.
23:18 - I'm a fellow babysitter too.
23:20 - When I was 12, I did babysitting.
23:23 - I think for me also, it was helpful.
23:25 - My parents had their
own gymnastics facility,
23:27 - so I had a job.
23:28 - So I had to organize my time.
23:30 - I had multiple things happening
23:32 - in extracurricular activities.
23:33 - So I agree with you that that's good,
23:35 - but school comes first, for sure.
23:38 - - It is really good to be
able to help you manage time.
23:41 - It's hard.
23:41 - It's a hard skill, time management.
23:44 - And writing down a schedule,
23:47 - planning out how much
school of work you have,
23:50 - how to manage your time.
23:51 - Do you have enough time?
23:52 - Like planning ahead?
23:53 - "Oh, look, I'm gonna be really busy.
23:55 - I'm gonna be working during those hours.
23:57 - I have to do it ahead of time."
23:58 - So it does teach you to manage
your time very effectively.
24:02 - - Yeah, I totally agree.
24:03 - We have one last question.
- Sure.
24:06 - - From Chheang, from
Cambodia, Sisters of Code.
24:09 - - Hi, my name is Chheang Novomreasey
24:11 - and I'm 15 years old
and I'm from Cambodia.
24:14 - What is your favorite
content to watch on YouTube?
24:19 - - All right.
24:20 - Well, thank you so much for the question.
24:23 - I mean, I would, first of all say
24:25 - that there's so much
great content on YouTube.
24:29 - And so I watch many different parts of it.
24:32 - Well, first of all,
24:33 - there's personally some things
that I really like to do.
24:36 - I like the exercise videos,
like yoga on YouTube.
24:41 - It's been a great way to be able to,
24:42 - especially during the
pandemic, keep up exercise,
24:46 - but not have to go anywhere
and do it when you're free.
24:49 - There's a lot of great cooking videos.
24:51 - You can learn to make dishes
from all over the world
24:55 - and see people who are
from different countries
24:59 - and how they cook.
25:01 - I've also really enjoyed
seeing travel videos,
25:05 - which I've enjoyed a lot.
25:09 - And sometimes I watch videos in a language
25:11 - that's not my main language.
25:13 - I also speak French and Spanish.
25:15 - And so I've enjoyed being
able to watch content
25:18 - in different languages to
help keep up the language
25:20 - and to be able to grow it and
see different perspectives.
25:24 - I also watch the news a lot,
25:26 - which I've enjoyed
25:28 - because you can get it on specific topics.
25:32 - I watch what's happening with...
25:34 - I try to learn about new
companies actually on YouTube.
25:37 - So I've seen that whenever
there's a new company,
25:40 - usually the best way
to see their product...
25:42 - Yes, I try out all their products,
25:43 - but I also go and look
at their YouTube video
25:45 - about how their product
is supposed to work.
25:48 - A lot of times it's a lot faster
25:49 - and then I'll try out the product too.
25:51 - And then there are lots of great creators
25:55 - who can just make you laugh,
especially after a hard day.
25:59 - It's nice to watch them.
26:00 - And so I use YouTube for
many different things,
26:03 - and I hope it's useful for all of you too.
26:07 - - I felt like that's probably
the number one question.
26:09 - All of our Scratches wondering,
26:10 - "What does Susan watch on YouTube?"
26:12 - So, thank you for sharing.
26:13 - I have to tell you,
26:14 - I also love that you call
26:16 - or you name your creators, creators.
26:18 - 'Cause I think that's really core
26:21 - to the work that's being done on YouTube.
26:22 - And we really appreciate
26:23 - being part of the creator community also.
26:27 - - No, that's really core,
and what unites all of us.
26:32 - The fact that our creators are creating
26:35 - and Scratch is enabling people to create.
26:38 - It's giving them the
tool to be able to build
26:41 - and create and express themselves
26:43 - and learn more coding skills
26:46 - where they'll be able to
create applications or apps
26:50 - or tools to express
themselves and to do whatever
26:53 - is useful and necessary for them.
26:55 - So I'm a big supporter of
people learning to code.
26:58 - I see the world as moving more digitally.
27:02 - And I can tell you,
27:04 - I started learning to code actually,
27:06 - when I was a senior in college.
27:10 - I was 21 and I thought I was
too old to learn to code.
27:15 - I can tell you, you're never
too old to learn to code.
27:17 - You can always learn to code
27:19 - and that there are many easy
ways to learn and get started.
27:23 - Like Scratch is a great way
to learn and get started.
27:27 - And I really, again, for
anyone who's interested,
27:30 - I encourage you to try it and to learn.
27:34 - And I you'll see that
27:35 - you'll be able to do quite
a lot pretty quickly.
27:39 - And there are great channels
27:41 - to be able to learn like the
Scratch Foundation channel.
27:45 - And so I encourage everyone
27:46 - who is thinking about learning coding,
27:49 - who always wanted to learn
to code to try it out.
27:52 - And I'm confident that
27:54 - you will be able to do
something pretty quickly.
27:57 - Just trying it out and
learning a little bit.
28:01 - - Well, thank you, Susan.
28:01 - This was so nice to have
this conversation with you
28:04 - and our Scratches from around the world.
28:06 - And we look forward to continuing
28:08 - to be part of the YouTube family
28:10 - and YouTube creator community.
28:12 - - Yeah.
28:13 - Yeah, no, thank you.
28:14 - And thank you to you
28:15 - and all the Scratchers around
the world doing great work.
28:20 - And I look forward to
continuing the conversation.
28:24 - - Absolutely.
28:24 - Thank you.
