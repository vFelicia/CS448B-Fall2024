00:09 - Did you know you can draw
in Scratch using pen blocks?
00:12 - These digital pen drawings,
commonly referred to as 
00:15 - turtle graphics, are created
when a cursor (the turtle)
00:18 - draws on a plane
(like the Scratch stage).
00:22 - Turtle graphics were named
after a class of educational
00:25 - turtle robots that often came
with pen mechanisms,
00:28 - which allowed the programmer
00:30 - to create a design
on a physical sheet of paper.
00:33 - Turtle graphics can be created
00:34 - in a variety
of programing languages.
00:37 - They most often employ
geometry concepts
00:39 - and focus on direction, location
and repetition (looping).
00:44 - Using the Pen blocks in Scratch
to create a visual artifact, 
00:48 - helps you observe results,
debug, and iterate.
00:52 - Let's create a turtle graphic.
00:54 - First, choose the sprite
you want to act as the turtle.
00:57 - That is the object
that will be drawing.
00:59 - You can pick any sprite
from the sprite library.
01:02 - Note: some sprites are large
and may 
01:04 - hide the pen line if it's short.
And some sprites are round,
01:07 - so it can be hard to tell
the direction they face.
01:10 - As you work on your program, 
you may need to experiment
01:13 - to find the sprite
that works best for you.
01:15 - Now, you need to add the
Pen extension.
01:18 - In the lower left-hand 
corner of the editor,
01:20 - click the Extensions icon
and select the Pen category.
01:24 - The Pen block category will then
appear in the block palette.
01:27 - To start your program,
let's add this starter script,
01:30 - which positions your sprite
in the center of the stage 
01:33 - each time the program is run.
01:35 - You can always play
with the values later
01:37 - if you want a different 
starting position.
01:39 - Now, look at these shapes.
01:41 - And pick one to recreate
in Scratch using the Pen blocks.
01:45 - Study your shape.
What do you notice?
01:48 - Are the sides the same length
or different length?
01:51 - Are the angles
the same or different?
01:53 - Are there any points 
where the steps you’d take
01:55 - might be the same?
Repeated?
01:58 - As you think
about which blocks to use,
02:00 - imagine if you were poised
with a pen in the air
02:02 - over a piece of paper,
ready to draw the shape.
02:06 - What is the first thing
you would do?
02:08 - You'd need to put the 
pen to the paper
02:10 - in order for the lines
to be recorded. Right?
02:13 - Do you see a block that talks
about putting the pen down?
02:16 - What's the second thing
you would do?
02:18 - The third?
02:20 - Perhaps you would 
move the pen
02:21 - a certain distance
across the paper.
02:24 - Perhaps you would turn your hand
in a particular direction
02:27 - and then move the pen.
02:29 - As you write your program,
02:30 - keep in mind the need to use 
clear instructions 
02:32 - and break the
task down into smaller steps.
02:36 - Once I have finished 
drawing my shape,
02:38 - what if I want to draw it again?
02:40 - Just as we had to think about
putting the pen to the paper,
02:43 - we need to be clear about when
to take the pen off the paper
02:47 - or we'll end up with 
errant lines.
02:51 - Let's head to the Scratch editor
02:52 - to look at the Move and
Pen blocks again.
02:55 - Experiment to see
what each block does by clicking
02:58 - on each block in the block
palette or in the script area.
03:01 - Play with the values
and see what effect it has.
03:04 - Then, combine the blocks
to start your program.
03:07 - Note: there's often
more than one solution
03:09 - that will accomplish the task.
03:11 - For this example, I'm going to
choose to draw the square
03:15 - and I'm going to focus on these 
03:16 - Motion and Pen blocks
to create the shape in Scratch.
03:20 - When you're creating your shape,
03:21 - you don't have to use
all of these blocks. And you can
03:24 - use any of these blocks 
as many times as you need.
03:28 - Pause the video here as you
think about which Scratch blocks
03:31 - you want to use for each step
needed to create your shape.
03:35 - Write your program, test,
and debug it.
03:37 - Then, unpause the video 
for a few more tips.
03:46 - Did your shape
come out as expected?
03:48 - If not, can you spot the problem
and debug/find the error?
03:53 - Do you want to 
erase all the lines 
03:54 - before the program draws again?
03:56 - What block
might you use to do that,
03:58 - and where should it appear
in your program?
04:01 - Do you need to add
further instructions
04:03 - about when the pen should be up
and when it should be down?
04:06 - Remember, that 
sequential order matters.
04:08 - Where have you used 
blocks like 
04:10 - “erase all,” “pen up,” and 
“pen down” in your sequence?
04:14 - Are you adjusting the direction
before or after a move?
04:18 - What happens if you place
these blocks at the beginning
04:21 - or end of a sequence,
or in a different order?
04:25 - You could insert a 
“wait” block at key points
04:27 - to slow down the action.
04:29 - Now, you know where to 
start looking to debug.
04:32 - Keep in mind, there's 
04:33 - often more than one solution or 
program to accomplish a task.
04:37 - You can compare your program
with other’s solutions
04:40 - who are drawing 
the same shape,
04:41 - to see the similarities
and differences.
04:44 - Is one method more efficient, 
using fewer lines of code?
04:48 - Is another person's program 
full of customization?
04:57 - How could you use a loop 
like “repeat”
04:59 - to speed up your coding
for repeated steps?
05:02 - Do you need to adjust 
the blocks you've used 
05:04 - from more specific 
to more general, 
05:06 - in order to utilize a loop?
05:12 - How could you use 
a loop to make more 
05:13 - complex patterns or shapes
from this single shape?
05:28 - And just like drawing on paper,
05:29 - with the Scratch pen blocks,
you can use different pen sizes
05:32 - or pen colors
when creating digital drawings.
05:35 - Experiment and customize
the shape to your liking.
05:39 - Want to see your program 
run really fast?
05:42 - Try turning on turbo mode
05:43 - by holding Shift and 
clicking the green flag.
05:47 - What else can you do
with the Pen blocks?
05:50 - Here are just a few examples 
of ways Scratchers have 
05:52 - incorporated Pen blocks into 
their project in creative ways
05:56 - to make moving lines,
06:01 - complex shapes,
06:09 - object allusions,
06:15 - interesting patterns,
06:21 - drawing games 
06:23 - and more!
06:24 - What will you create?
