00:27 - the theme of this episode for the
00:30 - scratch video update we're trying to go
00:31 - over the theme and we're like well maybe
00:32 - Random randomness like the randomness
00:35 - that is part of our everyday lives like
00:37 - we should embrace that randomness like
00:39 - it's random I'm wearing a hat today
00:40 - yeah and it's random I don't know it's
00:43 - random that had nothing to say so for
00:47 - for our love it section we have a couple
00:49 - projects that really embrace randomness
00:51 - I want to highlight the project random
00:54 - excuse generator and this is by happy
00:57 - lollipop and this if you're ever looking
00:59 - for a good excuse this project comes up
01:01 - with random excuses for you so we should
01:03 - probably come up with one for why it is
01:05 - we're a month late for the scratch video
01:06 - update but anyways we want to run that
01:08 - now we'll come up with one at p.m. we
01:11 - have we have plenty of excuses so I
01:13 - totally check out that project by happy
01:15 - laptop it's quite cool cool so the
01:17 - project that I am loving is random land
01:20 - for are there three more I don't know
01:26 - random land for by Hobson TV the goal of
01:30 - the earth game it's a game the goal of
01:32 - the game is to get out of the randomness
01:36 - that is this land and I personally have
01:39 - been trying to play the game and I
01:40 - haven't passed the first random thing
01:42 - hopefully I have and I can assure you
01:45 - there's a lot of bad things that happen
01:46 - so those are two kind of Lovett things
01:48 - you love in the community love the
01:50 - things you love in the community that
01:51 - was a random way to phrase that but not
01:54 - random is the things to try sections
01:56 - triple cheese these are the fun things
01:59 - that are happening in the community that
02:00 - we invite you to try though there are a
02:01 - lot of cool things happening I want to
02:04 - point people to the randomness studio
02:06 - this is actually an old scratch design
02:08 - studio but it's projects that are using
02:11 - the random block so if you're not
02:12 - familiar the random block
02:14 - allows you to kind of pick a random
02:16 - value and that's a really powerful thing
02:17 - to be infusing into your scratch project
02:19 - and in fact the studio has hundreds of
02:22 - examples so definitely encourage you to
02:24 - check it out and add your own project to
02:26 - that studio what about you
02:28 - I really am loving the upside-down
02:31 - studio which is basically a bunch of
02:34 - projects where it's things are flipped
02:37 - upside down so check it out it's fun
02:39 - it's random well I'm saying things are
02:42 - falling but no they're upside down
02:48 - studio is quite cool definitely check
02:49 - that out
02:49 - not nauseous if you haven't already
02:53 - stopped watching the random video update
02:55 - that we're doing yeah I would encourage
02:57 - you to check that out we have a very
02:58 - special message from the scratch team in
03:02 - the theme of randomness we thought it
03:04 - would be fun if chimp ikanai walked
03:06 - around and found some of the random
03:09 - things that are on scratch team members
