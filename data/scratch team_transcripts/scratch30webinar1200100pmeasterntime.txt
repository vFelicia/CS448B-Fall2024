00:03 - okay I think we're on the air
00:07 - hello everybody welcome to the second
00:10 - installment of the scratch 3.0 webinars
00:13 - yay and certainly we have joined in this
00:19 - session we're joined by a few new
00:22 - scratch or different scratch team
00:23 - members in the morning session so maybe
00:26 - we'll start by doing a quick round of
00:27 - introductions and first welcome to
00:29 - everyone who's joining us my name is
00:32 - Champ Iike Fernando I lead outreach and
00:36 - communications for the scratch team and
00:38 - I'm here with I'm Amy Scott metal and
00:40 - I'm a graduate student in the lifelong
00:42 - kindergarten when scratch has board hi
00:47 - everyone my name is me um I help out
00:50 - with communications for scratch so if
00:53 - you follow us on Twitter or Facebook or
00:55 - Instagram chances are we've interacted
00:58 - also hi to people who are joining us
01:00 - from around the world I see in the chat
01:02 - we have Peru Switzerland and really
01:06 - close to us Brookline so hey everyone um
01:08 - and hey my name is Eric Schilling but on
01:11 - the scratch team for about five years
01:12 - first three years I was the manager of
01:15 - the scratch online community but in the
01:17 - past two years I've been working on
01:19 - scratch learning resources and maybe the
01:22 - title I'm most proud of is co-host of
01:24 - the scratch video update was Campeche
01:25 - but anyways super glad to be here with
01:28 - you all sweet so I think the reason we
01:31 - wanted to do these webinars is as many
01:33 - of you may know we're about to launch a
01:36 - new version of scratch which we're
01:38 - calling scratch 3.0 it's planned to
01:42 - launch January 2nd so you know just a
01:45 - few months away and we wanted to host
01:48 - this webinar as a way to just sort of do
01:53 - sort of walkthrough of that we've we've
01:55 - had the beta version of the editor live
01:57 - for a few months now hopefully folks
01:59 - have had a chance to try it but we
02:01 - wanted to do like a live walkthrough of
02:02 - it but also have you know some
02:05 - opportunity for folks to ask us
02:07 - questions so I think for today what
02:11 - we're gonna add the the way the agenda
02:12 - will work is
02:14 - and actually all of this will be
02:15 - recorded and we'll put up a version
02:18 - later that you can access so if you miss
02:20 - this or you want to go back and see
02:21 - things you'll be able to access it but
02:24 - what we want to do is sort of I'll start
02:26 - by talking a little bit about scratch
02:28 - 3.0 what you know why we created another
02:31 - version of it or why we're doing this
02:32 - new version of scratch then carmella and
02:36 - I will do a click creating a project in
02:38 - the new editor we'll talk a little bit
02:43 - about the extensions library Eric will
02:45 - talk about the new resources we'll talk
02:48 - a little bit about our code which is
02:50 - around the corner and then we'll try and
02:53 - save a lot of time for questions so
02:58 - let's start yeah I can't wait to make
03:02 - this
03:05 - but but before we dive into the editor
03:07 - actually I'll share um an important link
03:10 - let me try and present here you can all
03:14 - start asking questions we're going to be
03:16 - taking questions from Twitter on the
03:19 - YouTube chat but then also through poll
03:22 - everywhere so let me share that so this
03:30 - is the hashtag we're using on Twitter
03:31 - it's a hashtag scratch 3 webinar you can
03:35 - post your questions there and then we
03:39 - also have a poll everywhere link
03:41 - it's full of dot-com flash scratch team
03:45 - and so we'll be watching that and
03:49 - gathering questions and and if there are
03:51 - things that we don't get to in this hour
03:53 - we'll try and address them afterwards
03:56 - through on our ethic he or Twitter as
04:03 - well okay so um let me Harry said before
04:11 - before we jump into making a project you
04:15 - know we've been working on scratch 2.0
04:16 - for the last couple of years and you
04:21 - know the last time we did a total sort
04:23 - of redesign or new version of scratch
04:25 - was a little over five year
04:27 - ago now would scratch 2.0 and so this
04:30 - new version is a complete rewrite and it
04:32 - moves scratch out of Flash which is
04:35 - great but it's it's really designed to
04:39 - sort of work across a broader range of
04:41 - devices and and specifically work well
04:44 - on touch devices as well and as we've
04:48 - been designing it we've sort of focused
04:50 - on two specific areas we wanted to
04:53 - really expand the types of things you
04:56 - can create with scratch and so that gets
04:58 - into the extension library which we'll
05:01 - talk about a little later and we want to
05:05 - provide easier ways to get started or
05:08 - more support for getting started with
05:10 - scratch which gets into the resources
05:12 - that Eric will talk about and one thing
05:18 - to note with this launch is a lot of the
05:21 - changes in the updates are focused on
05:23 - the editor we haven't made a lot of
05:25 - changes to the community and so on
05:28 - January 2nd you'll see this new editor
05:30 - but you know and it'll be connected to
05:33 - the community you'll be able to share
05:35 - into the community all your projects
05:36 - from that you've ever created them
05:39 - scratch should continue to work in this
05:40 - new editor without you know doing it
05:42 - work
05:44 - but you won't see big changes in the
05:46 - community yet that's planned for after
05:49 - the launch and later and another thing
05:52 - to note is I know we've gotten questions
05:54 - about educator accounts and we have lots
05:57 - of ideas for improving that experience
05:59 - and lots of things that we want to do
06:01 - there but that also won't be timed with
06:04 - the January 2nd launch that will come
06:06 - later next year when we sort of like
06:10 - free up some time to work on those
06:11 - things and one last thing that is a
06:16 - common question is about the offline
06:17 - editors we will have offline versions of
06:21 - scratch 3 ready on January 2nd working
06:25 - on Mac and Windows and later next year
06:29 - we'll have versions at work on
06:30 - Chromebook and Android and iOS ok so now
06:36 - that we got all the sort of like details
06:38 - out of the way let's actually take a
06:41 - look
06:41 - the editor and try making a project so
06:45 - when you load the beta editor the URL is
06:47 - beta that scratched mit.edu you'll get
06:50 - this window and you can jump in and
06:52 - click try it or you can also there's a
06:54 - button here that says view 2.0 project
06:57 - and if you click on that you can
06:58 - actually load one of your 2.0 projects
07:01 - and see how it works so I definitely
07:03 - recommend trying that and seeing how
07:05 - your 2.0 projects look in here
07:07 - but for now Camila and I are gonna go in
07:09 - to try it I know someone I like carmella
07:12 - kick us off with creating this project
07:14 - sure I'm always excited to make a new
07:17 - project and you know like this is gonna
07:19 - be even more exciting because it's a new
07:20 - project in a new interface and as you
07:23 - might see you know like there are like a
07:25 - couple of different things that we're
07:27 - gonna explore as we make something one
07:30 - thing that I usually start doing when I
07:32 - start a new project like that doesn't
07:35 - involve the scratch cat is deleting the
07:37 - cat so I feel bad every time but I also
07:40 - wanted to show you like how to delete
07:42 - the project like the sprite and it's a
07:45 - new way right you can click on this
07:47 - video X and now you have like a blank
07:50 - slate
07:52 - so let me add the new sprite so the way
07:55 - which we added you spry like we have
07:57 - like multiple ways to do it to choose a
07:59 - sprite so I can choose one from the
08:01 - library and or you can paint it as usual
08:04 - there's a new thing which is a surprise
08:06 - I will get that random prior that I can
08:08 - play with or I can upload my own right
08:11 - for now I'm gonna choose a sprite from
08:14 - the library this gives us the
08:16 - possibility to show how the library has
08:18 - changed right so there are like you
08:21 - might recognize some kind of like
08:23 - scratch - classic very classic sprites
08:27 - you know the Apple bo-beautiful
08:29 - but also there are new sprites here I
08:32 - think the bear is a new thing right and
08:35 - we have like KC I really love the new
08:38 - dinosaurs so I think I'm gonna choose
08:41 - one of them and actually you can also
08:43 - another cool thing about the new sprite
08:45 - library is when you mouse over them you
08:47 - see all the costumes associated with
08:49 - that sprite right away which is I love
08:52 - this yes
08:54 - yes so let me pick like this dinosaur
08:56 - too and now I have it here on on stage
09:01 - and that actually I was inspired by
09:03 - saying like how many costume different
09:04 - costumes
09:05 - it had so let me just like go and grab
09:07 - just a block as you can see that can
09:10 - again just like jump into different
09:11 - categories but what one thing is I love
09:14 - is I can just like scroll so I don't
09:16 - need to remember what is that you know
09:18 - which category was the switch costume
09:20 - here we go it's right here in looks so
09:23 - that scrolling works really nice on
09:25 - tablets to you which is another thing
09:27 - that sort of thought about and that in
09:29 - this design is like the blocks are a
09:31 - little bit bigger to work on touch
09:32 - devices but also the scrolling is much
09:35 - easier when you're browsing on a tablet
09:37 - yeah that's great so I can just like as
09:41 - usual I can just like click on it and I
09:44 - can see the effect all of this code let
09:47 - me just like grab control oh no it was
09:51 - an events what I was looking for is like
09:53 - when the sprite is clicked so now every
09:55 - time I click on the dancer
09:57 - kind of changes what do you want to add
10:01 - you're like there needs to be some sound
10:04 - here I want the dynastar to say
10:05 - something so I'm gonna go into the
10:08 - sounds tab here and add a sound for the
10:12 - dinosaur and again similar to adding a
10:14 - sprite you have this little menu here
10:16 - where you can choose a sound from the
10:19 - library record a sound you can get a
10:21 - surprised sound or you can upload your
10:24 - own sound I'm gonna go ahead and record
10:27 - a sound and so we've made a lot of
10:30 - improvements to the sound tab sound
10:33 - editor to make it both easier to record
10:36 - and edit your own sound but also adds
10:38 - all sorts of interesting filters and
10:41 - effects so I think if you'll help me
10:44 - Carmello we can maybe make our our sound
10:47 - for the Dinah stop so loosely on the
10:49 - count of three okay one two three
11:06 - so I'm gonna easily just trim it here by
11:09 - dragging these out save it I think that
11:15 - sounds pretty good but it might sound
11:16 - even better with like an echo effect
11:22 - like that so we'll keep that and then
11:26 - maybe I'll just change the name of it to
11:28 - be rawr
11:31 - I'll go back into the code tab and then
11:35 - if I go into the sounds category and
11:39 - drag out the play sound and change it to
11:44 - rawr see I'll just add that to your
11:50 - existing okay that works
12:01 - I feel like we need to be a little more
12:04 - here than yeah I was wondering where is
12:07 - this dinosaur leave right it's like yeah
12:12 - and from the boy from the egg Oh like I
12:14 - was thinking everything is I don't know
12:16 - in space or is it like somewhere else
12:19 - let me just like choose a backdrop and
12:21 - as usual I can choose a backdrop from
12:24 - the library I can paint a new one get a
12:26 - surprise or you know upload one of the
12:30 - backdrop so let me just like go ahead
12:31 - and see what is in the library and again
12:34 - you might recognize some of the classic
12:38 - kind of backdrops of scratch and some
12:42 - new ones let me go and share or some
12:46 - classic but have been like redrawn like
12:49 - like and one of that one of those is the
12:52 - underwater I think then the waters
12:54 - looked different
12:55 - it's just too and yes yeah that's
13:04 - actually let me see if I can code let me
13:08 - see he still works
13:13 - that's awesome okay so we have a
13:16 - dinosaur roaring underwater so I think
13:21 - maybe one other thing that I'll add to
13:24 - it is something from the extensions
13:28 - library so as I mentioned we designed
13:30 - this new extensions library which you
13:32 - can get to by clicking on this little
13:34 - icon in the bottom left here and the
13:38 - idea here was to you have sets of knee
13:42 - blocks that really expand the types of
13:44 - things you can create with scratch and
13:45 - give us an opportunity to sort of
13:47 - continue to grow this library over time
13:50 - and continue to expand and grow all the
13:53 - types of things you can make with
13:54 - scratch and you'll notice I'll quickly
13:56 - point out that there's some things that
13:58 - used to be sort of in the editor that
14:01 - are in the sort of default set of blocks
14:03 - that we've moved into extension so for
14:07 - example if you're looking for the pen
14:08 - blocks they're now an extension some of
14:12 - the music blocks have been moved into
14:14 - this music extension that also includes
14:16 - some new music blocks and then video
14:19 - sensing has also been moved into the
14:21 - extensions library but more exciting
14:24 - we've added all these new extensions if
14:28 - some of them are software extensions
14:30 - like text-to-speech and translate but
14:35 - then we've also added some Hardware
14:36 - extensions which connect devices like
14:38 - micro bit a Lego Mindstorms ev3 and the
14:43 - Lego form will be available all those
14:49 - will all be available on January 2nd at
14:51 - launch and then we hope to you know
14:55 - continue to release more of those over
14:57 - time so I think I'll actually one thing
15:00 - I'll point out is you know we get a lot
15:01 - of questions about sort of other people
15:03 - are also creating their own extensions
15:05 - and that's something we would love to
15:07 - support and we plan on putting out
15:09 - documentation and support for that later
15:13 - next year
15:15 - okay so I think enough sort of
15:18 - description of extensions I will add
15:20 - maybe Texas yeah let's try that wise see
15:25 - what we can do with that so when I click
15:26 - on it it adds this new category of
15:28 - text-to-speech and I've got the new 3d
15:34 - blocks block maybe y'all see the
15:44 - dinosaur say hello Carmelo hello hello
15:50 - okay that's interesting I was like it's
15:54 - not exactly the voice I was expecting
15:55 - from the dinosaur but you never know in
15:57 - script yeah you can have all sorts of
16:00 - but I but maybe we should change the
16:01 - voice so we have another block here so
16:20 - actually I noticed okay cool I actually
16:47 - went when you show the extensions I was
16:50 - curious about another extension oh is
16:52 - that the translate X yes you can add
16:54 - multiple exceptions the same project
16:56 - that's great so I'm going to like check
16:59 - this one and translate text into many
17:02 - languages so now I have both the Texas
17:04 - beach in the Translate here and I was
17:07 - actually very curious to see you know
17:09 - like when the sprite is clicked now the
17:13 - voice is kidding so I guess it would it
17:15 - would say like and yeah Meow's later and
17:17 - we can try but so instead of that I'm
17:21 - gonna translate hello well say hello in
17:27 - Russian pika
17:28 - I wonder if it'll translate share be
17:31 - good into I hope I spelled it right in
17:37 - Italian like this how would she say ciao
17:44 - let's see if it works on us click I'm
17:46 - sprite blur oh wait you said by me I'll
17:49 - because there's a kiddin okay let's see
17:57 - [Music]
18:04 - okay that's that sort of you know you'll
18:09 - see that creating in scratch 2.0 is very
18:12 - familiar and similar to if you've been
18:14 - creating in scratch to which you know
18:16 - was the goal we don't want it to be a
18:17 - totally confusing new experience but for
18:22 - the most part we've done a lot to just
18:23 - like make it feel a lot nicer work
18:26 - better on touch screens and then you
18:29 - know we have these new sounds new
18:32 - characters new backdrops and then this
18:34 - brand new extensions library so I think
18:38 - another new thing that I mentioned we've
18:40 - focused on was you know more ways to
18:43 - support people getting started and so
18:45 - I'll hand it over
18:46 - I think to air it about that gonna stop
18:50 - presenting cool can you see us yeah okay
18:56 - cool well try to match the energy that
18:58 - you two have but it shouldn't be hard so
19:01 - actually before we start I wanted to
19:03 - actually share just one or two time to
19:04 - label things that I'm living in this
19:06 - fast viewpoint 3.0 editor so I'm gonna
19:09 - attempt to screen share
19:10 - maybe champ and Carmelo you could let us
19:13 - know if you have to see the screen yeah
19:15 - okay cool I just like a couple like
19:18 - small things that really make me happy
19:19 - in 3.0 the color picker is like so great
19:23 - now so it's gonna drag out we win
19:26 - touching colors a block that we use and
19:28 - a lot of you know games and now so when
19:31 - you want to pick a color you can use the
19:32 - color picker and it's so beautiful like
19:34 - it zooms in and gives you a sense of the
19:38 - color by sort of filling up that ring
19:40 - with the color so this is super
19:41 - delightful
19:42 - super useful also thinking of you know
19:46 - when you first introduced scratch and
19:47 - people start to put together their first
19:50 - couple of blocks tax and then they
19:52 - accidentally throw in a block that they
19:55 - don't want and it's in the middle of
19:56 - their stack it's sometimes difficult to
19:59 - say okay we'll remove it and then put
20:01 - that back on so actually in 3.0 now you
20:03 - can you can control click and then
20:06 - delete that block in the stack which is
20:09 - really really great especially for
20:10 - newcomers and then I wanted to highlight
20:12 - this block that I also think is great
20:14 - for for newcomers which is you can glide
20:17 - to a sprite now so you can use glide to
20:21 - random position or glide to in this case
20:24 - unicorn 2 so I will collide so that's
20:27 - really good for like you know animating
20:29 - characters like interactive pet like
20:31 - glide to the food bowl live to the water
20:34 - or you can do an infinite loop where
20:36 - everyone tries to glide to each other so
20:38 - anyways it's just like the small things
20:40 - like that in addition to everything that
20:42 - Carmelo and champ shared so with that I
20:45 - wanted to talk about the resources that
20:48 - we've been developing for scratch 3.0 we
20:53 - you can access a lot of these resources
20:55 - in the scratch 3.0 editor if there is a
20:59 - button right here called tutorials that
21:01 - takes you to I guess what we're calling
21:02 - the tutorials library and let's just
21:05 - kind of cruise through some of these so
21:07 - first things first is we have a great
21:09 - getting started activity this is I'll
21:12 - click it for you it's a 60 second video
21:14 - that introduces you can orient you to
21:16 - the scratch and editor and which
21:17 - scratches and then you can then click
21:21 - this right this arrow here and then see
21:24 - some of the block stacks that are
21:26 - featured in the video and this kind of
21:28 - paradigm of video followed by animated
21:31 - gifts with the cards is kind of seen
21:33 - throughout all of our activities here in
21:36 - scratch 3.0 I should note that we've
21:39 - been sort of developing these and
21:40 - iterating them we've been doing play
21:42 - tests around Boston and we learned so
21:44 - much after each play test so you can
21:46 - expect that these will continue to
21:48 - evolve in small ways but we think it's
21:50 - really important to be testing these and
21:53 - so I I would say it's each
21:56 - research that we have here has been a
21:57 - place that said at least five or six
21:59 - times locally so let's go back into
22:01 - tutorials page you can see a number of
22:06 - resources I've some number of activities
22:07 - up here at the top these are two hour of
22:10 - code activities which I'm going to wave
22:12 - my hands at now and we'll get back to a
22:14 - bit later when we talk about hoc but you
22:16 - can see some of the familiar ones like
22:18 - animated named make music make a clicker
22:20 - game the hitch J's game continued add
22:22 - more but I wanted to quickly maybe spend
22:25 - 30 seconds to show you the make music
22:28 - tutorial so let's go ahead and click
22:30 - that we see it's gonna be a modal that
22:32 - pops up that contains all of sort of the
22:35 - learning resources content here and and
22:39 - here's maybe I don't wanna bury the lead
22:40 - you notice this isn't a YouTube video so
22:44 - I'm happy to report that we've sort of
22:48 - moved off on YouTube so I can hear the
22:50 - screams of educators of enjoy actually
22:53 - this is gonna be so we're hosting the
22:55 - videos which is something that educators
22:57 - have been asking us to do for a long
22:58 - time so that's that's the player that
23:01 - we're using is sort of an internal
23:02 - scratch player so uh it should work at
23:06 - this video then so let's watch sort of
23:10 - this thirty second video about make
23:13 - music you can use scratch to make music
23:18 - create a song make a beat or anything
23:22 - else you can imagine
23:26 - to get started take a spray I'll pick
23:29 - the saxophone now let's make it
23:33 - interactive
23:34 - I'll make the saxophone play a sound
23:37 - when I click it click the green arrow to
23:45 - see this code again and explore what
23:47 - else you might add to your project well
23:49 - so that 30-second video is just supposed
23:51 - to be a teaser it's supposed to generate
23:53 - inspiration on what you might make and
23:56 - just give you just a quick sense of at
23:58 - least one of the stacks that you might
23:59 - create and then you click the right
24:01 - arrow that learners would click the
24:02 - right arrow and then you can see that
24:04 - code again plus more ideas on one of
24:07 - those what else you might add to your
24:08 - project
24:10 - they're supposed to generative and then
24:12 - at the end of the tutorial
24:13 - you get links to the tutorials page or
24:18 - you get to see two different tutorials
24:21 - so in this case add back drop and add a
24:23 - sprite which are again twist
24:25 - regenerative so you've made your musical
24:27 - instrument
24:28 - what next maybe adding a background
24:29 - maybe adding a new character maybe
24:32 - adding a sound and so we sort of once
24:35 - you've gone through the deck of cards as
24:37 - we call them we want to make sure that
24:39 - there's many possibilities after that to
24:42 - make the project really your own and
24:44 - then quickly I want to go over some of
24:47 - the some of what we call the how-to
24:49 - videos which are sort of topic focused
24:51 - so if we if we scroll down the page past
24:55 - the activities you can see so add a
24:57 - background glide around record a sound
24:59 - use arrow key switch costumes these
25:02 - about 30 seconds long they sort of they
25:05 - show you the concept in a very tinkerer
25:07 - Bowl kind of way so this is again
25:09 - wonderful if you're in the classroom and
25:12 - you hear the classic well I'm done with
25:14 - my project well I have you thought about
25:16 - you know moving with arrow keys or
25:17 - recording a sound so you can be guiding
25:19 - learners here we'll continue to add to
25:21 - this library and something that's really
25:24 - important to us is making sure that
25:26 - these videos are all localized so it's a
25:28 - priority that we've been that's one of
25:31 - our priorities so just to give you a
25:32 - quick sense of what that looks like we
25:34 - started to sort of translate in Japanese
25:36 - so this is the animator name of video in
25:39 - Japanese it's gonna jump it no Maya will
25:46 - go video don't mine you know Joe come on
25:49 - once you know it okay buddy and you can
25:51 - see the editor is also translated so you
25:57 - don't have to go to youtube to get these
25:58 - this is again coming uh we're working as
26:01 - fast as we can but it will these videos
26:04 - will live in 3.0 and when you switch
26:06 - languages you will have audio that is
26:09 - localized and you will have the scratch
26:12 - editor localized as well so I think is
26:14 - really important for us so I have run
26:17 - down my list of things that I wanted to
26:19 - mention as far as resources are
26:22 - concerned please do
26:23 - send any questions that you have about
26:24 - these resources to the I'm not sure the
26:28 - URL there me pull Eve yeah slash scratch
26:34 - team but it looks like I'm supposed to
26:37 - talk about hoc as well exact is that
26:39 - right champ
26:40 - yep okay so our of codes super excited
26:45 - right around the corner me do you know
26:47 - the dates for our code I believe it is
26:50 - December 9th December 9 13 December 9 to
26:54 - 13 sorry maybe that's not I didn't mean
26:57 - to put you on the spot there anyways we
26:59 - have two new activities for hour of code
27:02 - and you can access those activities
27:05 - either you know in the tutorials on the
27:08 - toriel's page so that's gonna be create
27:12 - animations that talk or animated
27:13 - adventure alternatively if you're a fan
27:16 - of going to the hour of code website
27:17 - hour of code comm slash us activities
27:21 - and you'll see us here animated
27:24 - adventure game this is a collaboration
27:27 - with Cartoon Network we're using some of
27:29 - the Cartoon Network sprites and you make
27:31 - it pretty simple but fun game where
27:33 - you've got run around and collect
27:34 - objects and then we'll scroll down
27:37 - you'll see our second tutorial which is
27:39 - create animations that talk this is also
27:43 - maybe even better for newcomers than the
27:46 - Cartoon Network activity this is using
27:48 - the text-to-speech activity and it's I
27:51 - think a phenomenally well developed
27:55 - exercise for folks that are that are new
27:57 - to scratch kind of reminds me of like an
27:59 - animated character so you're giving a
28:01 - person sort of personality and movement
28:06 - to the character so I check both of
28:07 - those out and if you really love the
28:11 - scratch 2.0 hour of code activities
28:15 - those are still going to be available so
28:17 - no worries no worries there in fact if
28:19 - you want to go to those activities
28:21 - during hour of code if you log in on
28:25 - your scratch account right there there's
28:27 - gonna be a massive banner a huge banner
28:29 - that links directly to the scratch 2.0
28:32 - resources and so that's important
28:34 - there's an important distinction there
28:35 - again all I went to because
28:37 - they scratch 3.0 activities for our code
28:40 - the ones that I just showed here you
28:43 - will have to download you want to save
28:44 - your project you download those on your
28:46 - computer if you really want to use to
28:49 - scratch 2.0 resources the hour of code
28:51 - resources you'll just log into your
28:52 - accounts and you'll see them on the home
28:54 - page banner so it's an important
28:56 - distinction to make and I just wanted to
28:59 - make a correction to the dates I
29:01 - provided co-ed week is actually December
29:05 - third through ninth so I think I got
29:07 - some of the numbers right there but just
29:10 - repaired yeah
29:11 - confirming CS ed week is December 30 39
29:15 - every day is yes so don't feel like can
29:19 - you tell just one hour but yeah I have
29:22 - many hours of code but again yeah I
29:24 - would love to answer any resources
29:26 - questions that folks have so please fill
29:28 - up that poll with questions I think I
29:31 - talk forever
29:32 - I don't launch so I'm sorry add one more
29:35 - thing to resources and our our tips page
29:39 - I just want to make a quick plug to
29:41 - check out scratch that MIT that edu
29:45 - slash tips you go there today you know
29:49 - you'll find a set of activities and
29:51 - links to our activity cards which people
29:54 - let me see we have free sort of PDF
29:59 - versions of our activity cards there but
30:01 - we're but we also have the hard copies
30:04 - that are available for purchase and
30:07 - we'll have updated versions of these
30:08 - ready for the scratch 3.0 watch on
30:11 - January 2nd as well and then one other
30:15 - thing you know we know that one thing
30:17 - that makes scratch so great is the sort
30:20 - of community around it both you know
30:22 - kids educators but also resource
30:25 - developers for making all sorts of
30:26 - resources on top of the things that
30:28 - we're making and we've been working with
30:32 - a few resource developers to help ensure
30:35 - that right when we launched there will
30:36 - be a good range or variety of resources
30:41 - available in addition to the ones that
30:42 - Eric just showed so the scratch ed team
30:46 - at Harvard is working on updating their
30:48 - creative computing guide
30:50 - and that should be available around the
30:53 - launch as well the CS first team at
30:57 - Google is working on updating all of
30:59 - their video content and resources and
31:01 - they plan to launch those January 2nd
31:04 - and then the Raspberry Pi foundation is
31:07 - working on updating all their activities
31:09 - their scratch activities that are part
31:12 - of code club and I'll just quickly share
31:15 - the links to all of those very good so
31:30 - these are the links to those resources
31:33 - that I mentioned and then again our
31:37 - resources in addition to the videos that
31:40 - use video tutorials inside the editor
31:42 - you can go and find more resources at
31:45 - our tips page and we'll be updating that
31:47 - for the launch and I think we wanted to
31:50 - show really quickly because we mentioned
31:51 - that key point about you know for our
31:54 - code if you're using the beta tutorials
31:57 - that you should be saving so maybe I'll
31:59 - have carmella yeah yeah this is
32:03 - something that I usually do when I
32:05 - create a project with scratch 3.0 as I
32:08 - can't like save it on on the community
32:13 - yet
32:14 - yes yep I can download it on my computer
32:18 - so going in two to five and load to your
32:22 - I'm gonna have here up to scratch
32:27 - project that it's safe so now if I
32:31 - certainly below the pager I go back to
32:35 - scratch people you know and I want to
32:37 - open to try it and this time I'm gonna
32:43 - do upload from your computer can be a
32:52 - salad
32:56 - [Laughter]
33:01 - our dinosaurs came yeah okay great so I
33:12 - think that covers oh and then I guess
33:16 - like one more before we jump into Q&A
33:18 - you know just reiterating the launch
33:22 - timeline so the beta is available today
33:24 - for you to go and try at beta
33:27 - scratch.mit.edu again it's not connected
33:31 - to the community so you can create
33:33 - projects save them locally and then I'm
33:36 - January 2nd is when we will flip the
33:40 - switch and when you go to
33:42 - scratch.mit.edu the editor there will be
33:45 - the 3.0 editor and I can't remember if
33:50 - we mentioned this earlier but for those
33:52 - of you who want to continue using the
33:54 - 2.0 editor we will still have the
33:57 - offline version of the 2.0 editor
34:00 - available for download and we'll
34:02 - continue to support that and you'll be
34:05 - able to get to that by going to scratch
34:06 - that MIT that edu slash downloads and
34:10 - you can get previous versions of the
34:12 - editor they're great so I have a very
34:17 - long list of questions for the team here
34:20 - so thank you everyone for submitting
34:22 - them we've gotten messages from Portugal
34:26 - Turkey Malta France Brazil Brooklyn so
34:32 - people are joining us from all over so
34:35 - just a reminder if you want to ask a
34:37 - question you can tweet us using the
34:39 - hashtag scratch 3 webinar or you can use
34:43 - the pull that we've dropped in the
34:45 - YouTube chat it's pull Evie comm slash
34:49 - scratch team so this first question I'm
34:52 - gonna group them together just to
34:55 - reiterate for folks who have me may have
34:57 - joined later will there be an offline
34:59 - version available on January 2nd will it
35:02 - work on Chrome books will work on
35:05 - tablets and phones I think I can't be a
35:09 - you can probably take this one yes
35:11 - that's a great question and it has
35:14 - somewhat complicated answer so there's
35:18 - there will be offline versions available
35:21 - on January 2nd there will be a Windows
35:25 - and a Mac version of the offline editor
35:27 - available to download we will later next
35:32 - year release an offline version that
35:35 - works on Chromebooks which we've never
35:36 - had before so excited about that we had
35:38 - a lot of requests for that and then
35:41 - native versions of Android and iOS will
35:44 - also release later next year but in the
35:48 - meantime I just want to point out the
35:50 - way that scratch 3.0 is designed it's
35:53 - all html5 so it'll work in any modern
35:56 - browser which means you can open it up
35:59 - on your Android or iOS device through
36:03 - true a browser and you know we've been
36:06 - testing it on those devices and so they
36:08 - should work pretty well it's obviously
36:10 - not going to be as great a native
36:12 - experience but it's designed to work
36:15 - really well on those devices as well and
36:17 - and I will point out one thing we
36:19 - haven't mentioned is you'll also be able
36:22 - to play your projects on a phone and
36:25 - well you know that experience will have
36:26 - to continue to improve after launch but
36:29 - one of the things we're working on is a
36:33 - redesign of the project cage just to
36:35 - make it easier to crash on your phone
36:38 - [Music]
36:40 - great so folks are curious about what's
36:44 - what changes may be planned for the rest
36:46 - of the website and what the community
36:48 - will look like in scratch 3 point now
36:51 - you want to take that one there resident
36:57 - yeah maybe toss to toss excuse me to my
37:00 - question one more time sure so what
37:02 - changes are planned for the rest of the
37:04 - website and what the community will look
37:07 - like the QA what's the same I don't
37:09 - think the community is change much so
37:12 - that's I hope the changes for the rest
37:16 - of the website uh you know January 2nd
37:19 - you won't see too many changes to the
37:21 - scratch website and I think changes
37:23 - incrementally will we're allowed to
37:25 - crops the
37:27 - project page maybe the splash page I
37:31 - mean you'll see updated resources
37:32 - certainly so those will be changes but
37:35 - unless I am mistaken I don't think
37:38 - there's gonna be any like noticeable
37:40 - changes to the sort of the website side
37:42 - of things on January 2nd and I get
37:44 - incrementally wrong enough is that is
37:46 - that accurate so I got serious I just
37:47 - but you talk to you this that's totally
37:51 - accurate and I think yeah just to
37:55 - reiterate like the the major the January
37:58 - 2nd launch is mostly focused on updates
38:00 - and changes to the editor do you plan to
38:04 - make your improvements and updates to
38:07 - the community over time but what you'll
38:10 - see on January 2nd at most is like you
38:12 - know the project page will be will have
38:15 - like a bit of a visual update to match
38:17 - the look and feel with the editor no big
38:20 - like the feature changes there and then
38:22 - the home page you'll see some banners
38:24 - and things talking about scratch things
38:26 - I know but again you know no big feature
38:28 - changes there and then one thing I'll
38:31 - just preemptively say again as I think
38:34 - we mentioned this maybe earlier but
38:35 - educator accounts there's you know lots
38:39 - of questions that we get around
38:42 - improving that experience and updating
38:44 - that and I think you know we've been
38:46 - having a lot of conversations here about
38:48 - things we can do to improve that
38:49 - experience including tapping into like
38:52 - popular platforms and then we then we
38:56 - definitely want to make those
38:59 - improvements but that will come after
39:01 - the launch January 2nd so it's different
39:05 - okay so these next three questions I'm
39:10 - gonna throw rapid-fire so I think maybe
39:13 - yes or no will suffice since we have a
39:16 - bunch of questions are you removing any
39:18 - existing blocks its registry point oh we
39:27 - definitely made some slight changes to
39:29 - existing blocks I can't think of locks
39:33 - that were removing but I could be wrong
39:35 - here
39:36 - yeah
39:37 - according to the FAQ no blocks have been
39:40 - repeated there are there are some assets
39:46 - in the library that will not will not
39:49 - only be there that said we tried to make
39:51 - sure that that wouldn't impact any
39:53 - previous resources that were produced so
39:56 - if you're using the 2.0 resources I'm
39:58 - 99% sure that you won't have to worry
40:00 - about those assets not being in it so I
40:03 - did one thing we kind of trimmed on the
40:04 - library to add some new stuff great it's
40:07 - like this is like also related to old
40:11 - projects like keeping working on on the
40:14 - new version of stretch so like so
40:17 - surprising to not find a block that
40:20 - would be I use them so when you're gonna
40:24 - scratch to burn your project you will
40:27 - have to keep working on it
40:30 - yeah great um will there be a backpack
40:33 - in scratch 3.0 yes okay so will that be
40:36 - done by January 2nd I'm not sure will
40:40 - there be an option to switch the stage
40:42 - left and right no okay right at all that
40:50 - sure okay so so the previous version of
40:57 - scratch scratched 2.0 or the current
40:58 - version of scratchers had the stage on
41:01 - the left side if you're familiar with
41:03 - the version before that the stage was
41:05 - actually on the right side so the
41:06 - decision to move it to the left side
41:09 - came from when we designed scratch 2.0
41:13 - it was the first time we were moving the
41:15 - editor to connect to the community and
41:17 - have it beat in the browser and we had
41:19 - that whole see inside button or you can
41:22 - switch the project page to the editor
41:24 - and we wanted to make that feel seamless
41:27 - and so we tried to keep the stage in the
41:30 - same place on the project page and the
41:32 - editor so that was sort of what was
41:33 - driving the shift to the left side and
41:37 - then in the design of 3.0 I think the
41:39 - play testing and try and think that
41:42 - scratcher is what we found was it's
41:46 - actually a better user experience and a
41:49 - better flow to have
41:50 - it go from you know like dragging blocks
41:52 - to the left and then playing on the
41:55 - right just for natural flow so we went
41:58 - back to the original some might say cool
42:02 - great we have a specific question about
42:06 - the demo that Carmelo and sham pika did
42:08 - they they loved the rollover costume
42:11 - preview is that something that will work
42:14 - on tablets that is a good question
42:18 - I think so there's a lot of things like
42:21 - that that they're sort of like figuring
42:24 - out that are sort of like design an
42:27 - engineering team are sort of trying to
42:28 - figure out like the goal is to make the
42:31 - experience on tablets be as much to say
42:35 - that we got a question in the previous
42:36 - webinar about like will it be a
42:37 - different experience on tablets only the
42:42 - only place where it all differs if we've
42:44 - had to do something
42:45 - because of the sort of form factor of
42:48 - the device or the constraints of the
42:50 - device but so I imagine you know
42:53 - obviously you can't do this or rollover
42:56 - but I think having some way of
42:58 - previewing the costumes associated with
43:02 - the right is something we'll try to do
43:08 - great so many questions I know a
43:12 - question that we have been getting a lot
43:13 - but I'm also curious to know will there
43:17 - be any online collaboration features in
43:20 - 3.0 or how are we encouraging
43:22 - collaboration in scratch 3.0 I don't
43:26 - think there's any explicit new
43:27 - collaboration features that we're adding
43:29 - to the editor I think it's been a
43:31 - question that's been asked quite a bit
43:32 - over the years and still thinking
43:33 - through what that looks like I don't do
43:37 - anything else dad maybe one thing that
43:40 - would mention like one thing that I'm
43:42 - very excited is that the code of scratch
43:47 - it's open source that means that like
43:50 - everybody can somehow remix the entire
43:54 - interface of strands and they can like
43:57 - you know like add features or work on
43:59 - things
43:59 - hmm yeah I care about and who knows
44:02 - maybe some of this
44:04 - features would be at some point
44:05 - incorporated in in the official scratch
44:08 - so when I hear about like features like
44:11 - this one that would be super exciting
44:13 - you know for people to try I will try I
44:15 - would encourage developers like to jump
44:18 - in to try it out and some of this seems
44:22 - kind of like simple from the conceptual
44:24 - point of view but implementing and
44:26 - making it like easy for children of all
44:29 - ages and easy to understand
44:31 - he's a challenge like working very every
44:37 - single pixel yeah and we want to say I
44:42 - think the resources team is thinking
44:44 - about ways in which we can develop
44:45 - resources to show how kids are
44:47 - collaborating now in the scratch
44:48 - community or in like multi animator
44:50 - projects and things like that and so
44:51 - highlighting more ways in which using
44:53 - the current tools that you have to
44:55 - collaborate cuz we see like beautiful
44:57 - collaborations happening the scratch
44:58 - community there's left to learn for sure
45:00 - yeah okay so for these last 15 minutes
45:03 - I'm gonna shift to resources and then
45:06 - maybe we can end on extensions let's see
45:10 - so questions about the scratchcards one
45:15 - will scratchcard still be available per
45:17 - scratch 3.0 and a follow-up question
45:19 - will they be translated yeah so they we
45:23 - are working on updating all of the
45:26 - scratch cards for three Fredo Eric do
45:29 - you know I I know that there is a goal
45:31 - I'm sure of eventually having them
45:33 - translated I don't know it's that
45:34 - timeline matches be ready right we're
45:37 - not playing the time I literally will be
45:39 - available translated great and maybe we
45:49 - can answer this question again for folks
45:52 - what is happening to the tips window
45:54 - inspections yeah this window is kind of
45:58 - being converted into a gel just screen
46:00 - chat really quick the tips page which I
46:04 - think we all love and I know is me what
46:08 - does they claim this way so the
46:09 - tutorials and those activities now live
46:11 - in the tutorials library again which you
46:13 - can access from a map I read going to
46:15 - tutorials and then the tips bar
46:17 - is now more like a tips modal in the
46:19 - sense that it kind of lives on top of
46:21 - the editor and you can access all that
46:24 - content here I'm happy with this sort of
46:29 - arrangement I think it's nice to sort of
46:30 - be moving it around yeah one thing you
46:34 - tutorial like this new library and the
46:37 - moat like it's much more visual and I
46:42 - think there's like a consistent feel
46:44 - with all the tutorials or a question
46:49 - related to that is whether we're
46:51 - planning to build out more scratch
46:53 - toriel of course yeah yeah yeah
46:55 - definitely and I think there's been a
46:58 - lot of interest and I just a loaded term
47:00 - but like more advanced quote-unquote
47:03 - advanced tutorials than like I think we
47:05 - have a great sort of breadth of sort of
47:07 - introductory very generative activities
47:10 - and with addition to those small concept
47:12 - how-to videos but we've certainly been
47:14 - thinking about some of the ways in which
47:16 - like platform games and that in gravity
47:19 - and telling some of these concepts that
47:21 - folks it was a more comfortable familiar
47:23 - scratch so I would be on the lookout in
47:26 - the new year or in expanding tutorials
47:30 - library and maybe even leaning heavily
47:31 - towards sort of these more advanced yeah
47:35 - topics so these two questions are
47:38 - related what will happen to scratch 1.4
47:41 - and 2.0 when scratch 3.0 launches and
47:43 - will I need to update existing resources
47:47 - or curriculum yeah so though the offline
47:52 - versions are the standalone versions of
47:54 - 2.0 and 1.4 will continue to exist if
47:58 - you go to scratch
47:59 - will people continue to be available for
48:00 - download if you go to scratch that
48:02 - mit.edu /downloads so you'll be able to
48:07 - continue that we aren't actively
48:09 - developing those but we will continue to
48:12 - sort of like make sure they are
48:14 - available for people to use and so if
48:17 - you have resources that are designed
48:19 - specifically for those editors you
48:22 - should be able to use them with these
48:24 - standalone versions or the offline
48:26 - versions we do encourage you to go for
48:30 - research
48:31 - we know that it's like a big process to
48:33 - update resources and we've tried to
48:35 - design this new version so that there
48:37 - isn't isn't a huge pain for people
48:40 - updated losers but we know that it is a
48:42 - lot of work we do encourage people to
48:45 - try and do it but also understand that
48:48 - it's something that takes time okay
48:51 - for educational publishers and content
48:54 - creators and resource developers is
48:56 - there a way to access scratch 3.0 blocks
49:00 - for updating books and tutorials so this
49:05 - the question essentially of like is
49:07 - there a way to get like PNG yes yes that
49:11 - also came up in this morning's to turn
49:13 - on I don't think right no more here but
49:18 - I don't know that we have I know we've
49:21 - gotten questions about this from other
49:23 - resource of opera isms like that just a
49:25 - file in geez I don't think we have
49:28 - something like that but I know there's
49:30 - been we've thought about creating
49:32 - something I don't know if we've made any
49:34 - progress on doing that it's so stay
49:38 - tuned stay tuned yeah and could we talk
49:41 - about we've been trying to we haven't
49:43 - even no list that we sort you know to
49:44 - folks who are developing special
49:47 - resources and this seems like maybe the
49:49 - next email we do out to them we should
49:51 - mention a question just like this yes
49:53 - all actually just for a moment show the
49:55 - URL where you can sign up for that
49:57 - mailing list yeah
49:59 - we can leave that up and we can jump to
50:01 - another question yeah um actually why
50:05 - don't we go back to this question about
50:07 - the sound editor I'm curious if there
50:09 - are there is a new sound library in 3.0
50:13 - yeah yeah so there's yeah I would have
50:16 - happy to crew see that really click and
50:17 - show you so we've updated we even I
50:20 - think improved the sound library this
50:22 - selection quite a bit Eric Rosenbaum
50:24 - who's on the team did a deep dive to try
50:27 - to find oh my gosh Creative Commons
50:32 - license
50:33 - loops and keys other sounds and so you
50:36 - can you can use sort of this new
50:38 - interface that we have tags to search
50:40 - the different sort of areas again you
50:42 - can mouse over to play it
50:44 - so I won't spend too much time with this
50:47 - there's a variety of really high quality
50:49 - new sounds from loops to sound effects
50:52 - so totally I check it out probably
50:55 - continue to add that to the coming year
50:58 - the person who asked that question
51:00 - really enjoyed that
51:01 - they said awesome okay great I'll give
51:03 - thanks for that
51:05 - so we have a few questions here about
51:07 - extensions let's see one will each
51:13 - recognition extension be available that
51:16 - was a good question
51:19 - Oh are we still on okay so yeah I don't
51:23 - know I'll toss it can peek on that one
51:26 - yeah sorry we were having I think there
51:30 - might have been some weird inception
51:33 - sharing going on
51:35 - Paula jeez so the witch extension was
51:42 - that that recognition yeah
51:47 - so that is something so there's there's
51:50 - a whole like you know so there's
51:53 - extensions that are available in the
51:54 - beta now which will be ready for launch
51:56 - and then there's I mentioned that's an
51:58 - area where we want to grow that library
51:59 - it's there some that are sort of in
52:01 - development and so people may have seen
52:03 - demo the speech recognition one in
52:06 - various places but that's not that will
52:08 - be ready for January a second and there
52:10 - are a lot of things that I think are
52:12 - still some challenges with on the
52:15 - development side with that one and so we
52:17 - don't have a clear timeline for when
52:20 - speech recognition will be available but
52:23 - you know like this kind of getting
52:25 - stayed staying tuned I just read some
52:28 - comments about like the the link wasn't
52:32 - like couldn't see it so let me just like
52:38 - straight sure and one thing snow should
52:42 - just pause as we screen shares I think
52:44 - it okay tree rapid fire some questions
52:51 - at the end
52:52 - yeah so well in offline
52:57 - version of scratch three be available
52:59 - for Raspberry Pi actually let's just
53:02 - pause for a second oh sorry sorry
53:04 - what's pause for one second and just
53:06 - share this URL yeah maybe you can also
53:08 - type it into the ly scratch resource yes
53:17 - and we just dropped it into the YouTube
53:20 - chat as well three working at the
53:25 - technical k99 will there be a Raspberry
53:32 - Pi extension available on in January not
53:36 - at the January 2nd launch but we have
53:39 - been working closely with folks at the
53:42 - raspberry PI's Edition on lots of
53:43 - different things and that's one of the
53:46 - things that we have been talking to them
53:49 - about and working on so hopefully it
53:53 - will be available sometime soon but we
53:59 - have this one that developers oh sure
54:04 - how can developers create extensions
54:08 - yeah that's a great question so we
54:11 - definitely want to support unofficial or
54:16 - experimental extensions and the plan is
54:20 - we will be will be releasing some
54:23 - documentation and support for doing that
54:26 - but it'll be later in 2019 and hopefully
54:29 - not too long after the launch but stay
54:33 - tuned for that because we definitely
54:34 - that's one of the areas that were most
54:35 - excited about with extensions is great
54:39 - just following up we've received a ton
54:41 - of questions about micro bit and scratch
54:43 - 3.0 and whether it will be available
54:48 - yeah yeah so that would data and we're
54:53 - continuing to develop that and we have
54:56 - lots of ideas for improving it and
54:58 - extending and then we also received a
55:04 - question about whether projects that
55:08 - were created in 2.0 won't work in
55:10 - three point oh yes yes yes we've been
55:14 - testing like crazy to make sure that's
55:16 - the case
55:18 - and we'll scratch three will scratch
55:22 - online the only 3.0 starting January 2nd
55:27 - yeah I see a block recommendation from
55:34 - game masters thanks for the
55:35 - recommendation we don't we don't have
55:36 - any plans to put that in yet great so I
55:40 - think maybe to wrap up we can just share
55:46 - again what extensions will be available
55:49 - in January 2nd win 3.0 launches yeah so
55:54 - when we launch we'll have the
55:58 - combination of software and hardware
56:00 - exceptions there will be new extensions
56:04 - like text-to-speech translate and then
56:08 - some hardware extensions which are micro
56:12 - bit Lego Mindstorms ev3 thank you Lego
56:17 - we do 2.0 and then as I pointed out
56:21 - earlier we'll have some extensions that
56:24 - are basically blocks that were in 2.0
56:27 - that we packaged in extensions which we
56:29 - put out like 10 videos and then you know
56:32 - stay tuned because this is an area we'll
56:35 - continue to add exceptions every time
56:38 - well microbe Network for your on
56:41 - Chromebooks I believe at launch they
56:47 - will not work you'll have to wait for
56:49 - the offline but a standalone version ok
56:52 - no but that's one of the one of the
56:55 - things we should double check on that
56:56 - data I make you are good I'm sure things
56:59 - like tablet will be able to connect to
57:02 - the hardware extensions and actually
57:07 - maybe in these last three minutes we can
57:10 - let people know where to find the FAQ
57:13 - which answers a bunch of questions that
57:16 - we covered and also didn't cover in this
57:19 - session
57:21 - all right there we go
57:31 - so we have our FAQ at scratch that
57:34 - mit.edu slash three FAQ and then you can
57:39 - also follow us on Twitter and Facebook
57:42 - and then as we mentioned earlier there's
57:45 - no research developer you can also sign
57:47 - up for a resources alternate I don't
57:51 - actually we shared earlier those of you
57:54 - that are really interested in the
57:56 - development process and want a closer
57:58 - look at how we're developing scratch or
58:00 - if you want to remix the editor in some
58:02 - way you can go to github.com /lk and see
58:08 - sort of the code as it's being develop
58:11 - yeah and also like speaking of
58:14 - extensions you know like it's not like
58:17 - the extension so I wish Ray was here but
58:20 - I like the extension it's not support
58:24 - it's not official yet but you can go in
58:27 - the code like I did it like last month I
58:30 - was just like playing around with
58:31 - extensions so you can see how the
58:34 - current extensions have been developed
58:36 - and create your own extension if you
58:39 - want to play with Arduino or if you
58:40 - wanna do something that's not yet
58:43 - officially supported you can way around
58:48 - where we definitely seen folks already
58:51 - starting to events or sharing with us
58:53 - what they're creating and then it'll be
58:57 - officially will have a special support
58:59 - for that episode later next year yeah
59:13 - thank you
59:14 - if you liked it you can come back at
59:15 - 6:00 p.m. Eastern or gain it again and
59:20 - just a reminder this has been recorded
59:22 - so a webinar of some kind will be
59:26 - uploaded to our YouTube channel and
59:28 - we'll be recapping what happened
59:31 - blog posts on the scratch blog also
59:34 - links everyone I see you on Shawn hi
