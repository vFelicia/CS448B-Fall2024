00:09 - Hello! I’m Justin from 
STEAM for Vietnam.
00:12 - I’m collaborating with the 
Scratch Team to explore creating
00:16 - a culturally and geographically-
relevant asset pack 
00:19 - in the Scratch editor
00:20 - that can be shared with other 
Scratchers around the globe.
00:24 - Hi, I'm Maren 
00:25 - (a.k.a. algorithmar
from the Scratch Team).
00:28 - To start creating an original
sprite or asset pack,
00:31 - you’ll want to sign in
to your account
00:33 - and start a new project.
00:35 - Click “Create” in the header.
00:36 - Note: You can create assets
using the offline editor
00:40 - or without being logged
in to the online editor.
00:43 - But you'll need to save
your project to your computer
00:45 - in order to save your work
or share later.
00:48 - You could upload an image
or sound, or edit sprites
00:52 - that are already in the Scratch
library to create an asset.
00:55 - But for this example,
00:56 - Justin is going to show us
how to create an original sprite
00:59 - by drawing a costume.
01:01 - Hover over the sprite menu
in the lower-right corner
01:04 - of the sprite area
and choose “Paint,”
01:06 - which brings you to a blank
costume window
01:09 - under the Costumes tab.
01:11 - There are two modes
for drawing in Scratch.
01:13 - Bitmap-mode allows you to edit 
photos and paint with pixels.
01:18 - Vector-mode allows you to create
and edit shapes.
01:21 - If you're creating
your own sprites, 
01:22 - it's important you stay in 
the default vector-mode 
01:25 - to create your artwork.
01:27 - Vector-mode allows users 
to adjust colors,
01:30 - change the shape of an object
in the costume, 
01:32 - add and remove elements, etc.
01:35 - If users remix your assets,
this flexibility is important.
01:39 - Now, back to Justin.
01:41 - Let's get into drawing the 
bowl of phở.
01:44 - First, I’ll choose 
the circle [tool] here. 
01:47 - For the bowl, I would like 
to use the fill color 
01:50 - that’s slightly orange. And then
I’ll choose an outline of
01:55 - the rim of the bowl
that’s slightly brown.
01:57 - Awesome!
Now, I will start drawing.
01:59 - Hit “alt” or “option” to 
drag from the middle.
02:03 - And then, I can use this tool,
 (“Select” tool) to move around.
02:09 - Hmm, now the rim seems 
a little thin.
02:11 - I will increase it,
probably to ten.
02:16 - Next step: I'm going to make 
the bottom of the bowl.
02:19 - I will use this and hit
“Copy” and “Paste.”
02:24 - Then, I'll move it to the back.
02:26 - I'll drag it down
a little bit here.
02:29 - And then, I'll change the fill
color to more slightly orange.
02:33 - And I will choose the outline
color [that is the] same 
02:37 - using the color
picker tool.
02:40 - Next, I use this “Reshape” tool.
02:42 - I click on the top point
and then I hit “Delete.”
02:46 - Next, let's draw some 
phở noodles in there.
02:50 - To draw the phở noodles, I’m 
going to use the “Line” [tool].
02:53 - And then, the phở noodle 
is usually white.
02:56 - I’ll drag it to here.
02:58 - The thickness is ten for now.
03:01 - The noodles is usually wavy,
right?
03:03 - So how can we do that?
03:03 - I'll use a “Reshape” tool.
03:06 - Click on here.
03:07 - Choosing this point,
and then hit “Curved.”
03:10 - Then, I can move this handle
to adjust the curve like I want.
03:16 - If you, by chance, hit another 
point and then hit “Create,”
03:19 - you can always hit “Back”
or delete that point.
03:23 - Now, let's make some 
wavy noodles in a bowl.
03:26 - Use the “Select” tool.
Copy and paste.
03:28 - Use the “Reshape” tool.
03:31 - A bowl of noodles!
03:32 - Next, let's add some 
beef in here.
03:35 - So, in phở,
I like to have brisket.
03:39 - So, we’re going to draw 
a shape
03:41 - that looks like a rounded
rectangle.
03:44 - Okay, so how should we do that?
03:46 - First, we choose 
the “Circle” tool.
03:48 - It's usually cooked to 
medium-rare or medium.
03:51 - So I’ll use this color.
03:53 - I will choose the 
“Reshape” tool.
03:54 - Make the top handles 
longer to make it look more 
03:57 - like a rounded thing.
03:59 - Now, [to make] this piece 
look more 3D a little bit
04:03 - [hit] “Copy” and “Paste,”
04:05 - and offset it diagonally
and bring [it] to the back.
04:09 - I will change
the color to slightly darker.
04:12 - Use the “Select” tool. 
Choose the two shapes. Group it.
04:15 - Bring it to our bowl of
phở here.
04:18 - Next, we're going to put
some basil leaves in here.
04:21 - I'll make one of it
04:23 - slightly darker color
so it can separate out.
04:25 - Finally, we will draw
a slice of lime in here.
04:30 - Okay, here's a tip.
04:31 - If you want to do a perfect
circle, you can hit 
04:33 - “Shift” on your keyboard
while you're dragging it.
04:36 - I would use the “Reshape” tool.
Delete this bottom point
04:40 - This slice of lime 
will be a half circle.
04:44 - I will make a slightly smaller
white half circle in here.
04:49 - I will draw two white lines
to make it look like 
04:52 - a slice of lime.
04:54 - Phở actually does
have some scallions in there,
04:57 - but I don't like it on 
my phở, so...
04:59 - Voila! We have a bowl
of phở here.
05:02 - While it isn't required, 
consider creating at least
05:05 - two costumes for your sprite
to show animation or variation.
05:09 - You can duplicate a costume to
quickly create another version
05:12 - by simply right-clicking 
on the costume you want to copy
05:15 - and then choose “Duplicate” 
from the menu.
05:19 - You could create
alternative looks by 
05:21 - adding or removing elements,
or changing colors.
05:24 - Or, you can think of how
your sprite might be animated,
05:27 - with each costume serving
as a frame of the animation.
05:31 - So now, when you 
05:32 - click alternatively between 
two costumes, [it is] moving
05:37 - just like the elements
were floating in a bowl of soup.
05:41 - Be sure to also name the sprite.
05:43 - You can change the name 
in the sprite area 
05:46 - by entering new text in 
the field next to “Sprite.”
05:50 - Even though it is optional,
considering adding at least
05:53 - one related sound
for each sprite you create.
05:56 - Select the “Sound” tab. 
05:58 - Hover over the Sound menu 
at the bottom of the tab
06:02 - and choose to upload
a sound or record your own.
06:05 - Here, I'm going to make a 
sound of my compliment
06:10 - when I am eating phở, 
 in Vietnamese.
06:14 - [Vietnamese] Dạ, ngon quá đi.
06:17 - The thing I just said means, 
“Oh, it’s so delicious.”
06:21 - Once your sound is recorded,
you can use the sound editor
06:24 - to make edits like changing the
length or adjusting the volume.
06:30 - I took a picture of the local
phở restaurant in Vietnam.
06:34 - You can upload an image
or picture as a sprite.
06:37 - If you want to create a backdrop
asset, you can add one 
06:40 - using the Backdrops menu.
06:41 - However, when creating an asset
pack to share, we recommend
06:45 - creating your backdrop
as a sprite instead.
06:48 - Backdrops created as sprites
can be more easily exported.
06:52 - Especially when they contain
sounds or multiple versions.
06:56 - I can click this 
“Convert to Vector” button
06:59 - to change it to vector format,
07:01 - which allows me to move it
around as an object 
07:04 - if I want to resize or 
reposition it. 
07:07 - When your asset pack project 
is ready, name your project 
07:11 - and share it to the 
online community 
07:14 - by clicking the “Share” button.
07:16 - Now, your asset can be remixed
and used by others.
07:20 - To help others
find your asset pack,
07:23 - you can look for studios
that match the theme of
07:25 - your asset pack,
 or for studios 
07:28 - that are specifically 
 collecting asset packs.
07:32 - Now that we've explored 
creating an asset,
07:34 - in our next video, 
we'll talk about using
07:37 - another user's asset from their
asset pack in your projects.
