00:04 - so I've been drawing basically since
00:08 - preschool when I liked how to hold a
00:10 - crayon I'm interested in all sorts of

00:45 - kind of walk around and collect items I
00:48 - got a lot of comments from people and I
00:51 - thought that that was just the coolest
00:53 - thing and wanted to keep making more

01:14 - sometimes when people see it usually
01:16 - they're the first reaction was like wow
01:18 - that's so cool I wish I could do that
01:20 - but it's like you can just like try it
01:26 - you
