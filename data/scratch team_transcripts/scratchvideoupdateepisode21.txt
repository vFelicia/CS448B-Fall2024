00:35 - want to give a shout out to the scratch
00:37 - in space studio if you're not familiar a
00:41 - couple months ago I had sort of put an
00:44 - invitation out to the scratch community
00:45 - to make projects scratch projects for
00:48 - space because I was going to go on a
00:50 - zero gravity plate which mimics the zero
00:53 - gravity environment that you might see
00:55 - astronauts floating in in the
00:57 - International Space Station so I am
00:59 - proud to report that I was able to play
01:03 - with a small handful of those projects
01:05 - on a zero gravity flight here's some
01:07 - footage of me playing a game by
01:09 - scootering which is I have to avoid the
01:11 - wall so you can see me in zero gravity
01:12 - trying to do that I promise I'm putting
01:15 - together a longer video where I'm gonna
01:18 - highlight the different projects that
01:20 - were played on that zero gravity flight

02:51 - encourage you it's really fun I spent
02:53 - some time when they're just checking out
02:54 - projects and it's really fun to learn
02:55 - about other people's stories so I
02:58 - encourage you encourage you to check out
03:00 - that studio what about you so I wanted
03:05 - to share a little bit about next week
03:06 - it's a huge week for us it's the hour of
03:09 - code hour of code what is our code again

03:15 - it's really focused on if you're getting
03:19 - if you want to get started with coding
03:20 - or you want to do more with coding
03:22 - there's a lot of tutorials and
