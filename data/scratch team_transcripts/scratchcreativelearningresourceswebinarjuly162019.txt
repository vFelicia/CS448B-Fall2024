00:00 - sorry hello hi everybody I'm Kristen I'm
00:08 - Zoey and I'm Eric we're the learning
00:11 - part of the Learning Resources team at
00:13 - scratch and we're excited to be chatting
00:17 - with you all live today we're going to
00:20 - be talking about learning resources so
00:23 - if you're someone who's working a using
00:25 - scratch as an educator and you need
00:27 - ideas or just want to know what kinds of
00:29 - resources are out there there's a lot
00:31 - and they can sometimes be hard to find
00:32 - so we're gonna kind of give you an
00:34 - overview of some things and then dive a
00:36 - little bit deeper and the first half of
00:38 - this webinar then and the second half
00:39 - will actually be doing a live Q&A so
00:44 - hold on one second because there might
00:45 - be some transitions between when we go
00:48 - from our slide show to other things
00:50 - there with us is actually at least my
00:53 - first yeah my first webinar - are you
00:56 - sure I think the links yes we have some
01:00 - links to screen share with yes but so as
01:03 - Kayla mentioned we really want to invite
01:06 - everyone to be sharing questions over
01:09 - the over the coming hour and so we have
01:12 - a number of ways in which you can do
01:13 - that one way and I think people are
01:16 - already doing this is there's a chat on
01:18 - YouTube live on the right side feel free
01:22 - to drop in your questions there you can
01:25 - start asking questions now yeah yeah we
01:27 - we have people from Genoa hi also some
01:30 - smiley heart emoji you can also just
01:32 - send yeah yeah yeah yeah well which is
01:35 - the scratch team introduce yourself
01:37 - so YouTube live chat is one way to ask
01:41 - questions
01:41 - another way is on Twitter you have a
01:44 - Twitter account you can tweet us your
01:46 - questions using hashtag scratch and
01:48 - practice again that's hashtag scratch
01:51 - and practice and then if you really like
01:53 - Google Forms I like Google Forms we have
01:56 - a Google Form where you can type in your
01:58 - question so to get to the Google Form
02:01 - you go to bitly slash your scratch
02:05 - questions again that's bitly slash your
02:08 - scratch questions so there's a lot of
02:10 - different ways to ask questions and we
02:12 - really really really really hope that
02:13 - you do ask question
02:14 - people are asking if they will have
02:16 - access to the slides
02:18 - oh yeah right yeah Wow yes so there is a
02:23 - link to this slideshow and it's another
02:26 - bitly link so it's bit dot ly / actually
02:31 - I think it's it's slash actually we'll
02:36 - put it in the chat we'll put the link in
02:37 - the vibe we got a whole hour to figure
02:39 - that it'll be good it's in our yeah it's
02:43 - in slack so if someone wants to drop
02:46 - that in there it's a slack yeah thanks
02:47 - so much okay so I'm Kristin and I'm
02:50 - gonna give you a brief overview of like
02:52 - what some of the main resources on our
02:55 - website are but so don't worry these are
02:57 - vast descriptions we're gonna come back
03:00 - to these and kind of dive in deeper so
03:02 - some of the main resources on earth that
03:05 - you can get from our website are the
03:07 - tutorials library and we'll kind of walk
03:09 - you through that in a bit the coding
03:12 - cards which you can buy online or you
03:15 - can download and print that are a
03:17 - resource we've got a lot of positive
03:18 - feedback on from educators they come in
03:21 - sets that help kids create their own
03:24 - unique projects based on games or
03:27 - telling stories or creating animations
03:30 - or dances or music so they're just a
03:32 - bunch of really amazing theme based
03:34 - activities that kids can really make
03:37 - their own then we also have educator
03:39 - guides which are designed for educators
03:42 - who are running potentially a one-hour
03:44 - workshop and it kind of gives you the
03:46 - kind of imagine create share structure
03:48 - that we often use in our workshops to
03:52 - kind of help you get set up and start
03:53 - running a scratch workshop of your own
03:57 - the philosophy behind all the resources
04:01 - that we create is kind of low floors
04:04 - wide walls high ceilings and what that
04:07 - really means is there's a low entry
04:08 - point so anyone can get up and running
04:10 - and start making something creative that
04:12 - they're passionate about right away
04:14 - and we've really tried to support that
04:16 - with the Learning Resources by creating
04:18 - things that help people dive right in
04:20 - and get them making projects they're
04:21 - excited about why walls means that you
04:24 - can explore like a broad range of
04:26 - interests and passions
04:27 - so no matter who you are or what you're
04:29 - interested in you can find a way to
04:30 - connect to scratch and make projects
04:33 - that you're passionate about high
04:35 - ceiling is is that there's room to grow
04:37 - so as you grow scratch can grow with you
04:40 - so I know we've heard a lot of
04:42 - scratchers talking about like they go
04:43 - back and look at their first project and
04:45 - they can't believe that the progress
04:47 - that they've made so they might come in
04:50 - and do a really kind of simple
04:51 - introductory project and then they build
04:53 - and create you know way more complex
04:55 - things as they continue learning yes so
05:01 - the next thing I'm going to go over is
05:02 - tutorials and I'm feel free other people
05:05 - in the room to chime in at any time yeah
05:07 - so now I'm actually gonna go to the
05:09 - scratch website so when you come to
05:12 - scratch on your own and you're not
05:14 - logged in this is what it will look like
05:16 - in order to get to the tutorials you
05:19 - actually have to open the scratch editor
05:21 - so I'm gonna click create to open the
05:23 - scratch editor since I'm not logged in
05:28 - it automatically opens this getting
05:30 - started tutorial for me right away and
05:32 - what's nice about this is if you're you
05:34 - know entering the scratch editor for the
05:36 - first time as a new scratch user there's
05:38 - this kind of welcome experience for you
05:40 - where it kind of shows you a brief intro
05:43 - into scratch and even if you click
05:46 - through these arrows which are sometimes
05:48 - a little bit hard to see you get
05:51 - actually a set of cards that shows you
05:52 - the you know how to create your first
05:55 - simple block stack and even what the
05:57 - blocks do um the other nice thing we
06:00 - just recently added this you can
06:02 - actually shrink the tutorials window so
06:04 - if you're working on something and
06:06 - you're you know adding your own blocks
06:08 - here and coding you can shrink it and
06:10 - move it around and then you can expand
06:12 - it again
06:13 - which is is new and we're super excited
06:15 - about it and we hope it's really helpful
06:16 - especially for people working on
06:18 - Chromebooks and other smaller devices
06:20 - but I'm actually gonna go ahead and
06:22 - enter the tutorials library so our
06:27 - tutorials library is full of kind of a
06:29 - broad range of different kinds of
06:30 - activities that kids can engage in so we
06:33 - have everything from creating animations
06:36 - making music making all different
06:39 - kinds of games if I scroll down here you
06:41 - can see there's also some a little bit
06:43 - towards the bottom things that maybe
06:45 - focus on specific skills like how to
06:47 - hide and show a character or how to use
06:50 - costumes to create a sprite animation so
06:53 - I can pick any one of these and I'm
06:54 - gonna choose kind of a classic scratch
06:58 - tutorial animate a name and you'll see
07:01 - that when I click play I'm gonna mute
07:03 - this that you can kind of there's a
07:09 - quick quick inspiration video that each
07:11 - tutorial starts with that shows you the
07:12 - broad range of things that you can
07:14 - create you know in scratch or with this
07:17 - tutorial and then you can dive into
07:20 - these cards that walk you through step
07:22 - by step you know how to add your first
07:24 - write and what kind of block staff we're
07:27 - gonna add to create that animation so
07:30 - this is kind of the basic structure for
07:31 - all of our tutorials and I'm going to
07:33 - kind of quickly go through these when
07:36 - you get to the end of the tutorial
07:37 - you'll see there are options of other
07:39 - things you might want to do so all the
07:42 - scratch tutorials have been designed to
07:43 - be kind of modular and that means that
07:45 - you might start your own project you
07:49 - know creating an animation and that
07:51 - animation could become a story it could
07:53 - become a game it could become any kind
07:55 - of hybrid of any of the kinds of
07:58 - different tutorials in our library and
07:59 - you can keep adding to your project
08:01 - using different tutorials so you could
08:03 - pick from one of these two or you could
08:05 - actually go back into the tutorials
08:06 - library and by clicking see more I don't
08:10 - know you guys have anything else to add
08:14 - yeah they're very generate I think you
08:16 - got it's a very generative so so the
08:19 - hope is and I think this happens in the
08:20 - tutorials you can really truly add your
08:22 - own ideas your own sprites you can add
08:25 - your own sounds you sort of make it your
08:26 - own
08:27 - yes um hi I like super exciting to see
08:32 - people from Venezuela Belarus Ukraine
08:35 - Canada and Boston in the chat welcome
08:37 - everyone it's really exciting um so if
08:41 - you go I just gonna show you a little
08:43 - bit of the I DEA's page on scratch uh
08:47 - that yeah so if you you know what
08:51 - where you can get a lot of like ideas
08:52 - for scratch projects which is just if
08:54 - you are on the scratch website and then
08:56 - go up here to ideas first it's gonna
09:00 - have a link to you know this will take
09:02 - you to the tutorials library that
09:03 - Kristin just showed you um and then you
09:06 - know this just links right to the
09:07 - getting started tutorial here we have a
09:10 - lot of our activities with and sorted so
09:14 - you have all the resources for one
09:15 - activity together so you know if you
09:17 - click on animate a name you have this
09:20 - link which will take you to that
09:21 - tutorial video there's also this link
09:23 - that will take you to the coding cards
09:26 - um right here um that like and if you
09:29 - haven't seen our coding cards uh you
09:31 - know it'll be a set of cards like around
09:33 - a theme uh with a bunch of cards in a
09:36 - set each card will have some sort of
09:38 - thing you can do in scratch this one is
09:40 - changing the color of a letter and then
09:42 - on the back of the card it shows you
09:45 - like the simple code to do it so anyway
09:48 - so the cards end or the video tutorial
09:50 - could both be used for animator name
09:51 - this also has a link to the educator
09:53 - guide for animator name which is just
09:56 - some extra info for educators on how to
09:58 - run a workshop or a lesson with this
10:01 - activity so we have that for quite a few
10:05 - of our of our tutorials then got this
10:09 - link that'll take you to the all of the
10:11 - scratch quoting cards like all of the
10:13 - decks we have I think we have eleven on
10:15 - here right now and they're translated
10:17 - into there I know that they're
10:18 - translated into Spanish and we're
10:19 - getting in more and more translations
10:21 - which is awesome thank you our community
10:23 - of translators this link will take you
10:27 - to the scratch starter projects page
10:29 - which I find a really a fun way of
10:33 - getting getting people like started with
10:37 - a project might make sense start a
10:39 - project but so like it'll tend to be
10:41 - like they're just the bare bones of
10:42 - something like this one is a maze
10:43 - starter project and it just has the
10:46 - absolute minimum of a maze but it you
10:50 - know you can you can remix it or anyone
10:53 - can remix it to make their own project
10:55 - and get it go in any directions so I
10:57 - find the starter projects are really
10:58 - helpful like if you have a student who's
11:00 - wants to know what to do next or if you
11:02 - a student you know getting students
11:04 - started in
11:05 - making a larger project so yeah that's
11:09 - uh that's about the ideas page we also
11:12 - one of the really cool new things in
11:15 - scratch three is that we have a lot more
11:18 - extension supported which you can see
11:21 - all the extensions if you go to the
11:23 - scratch editor so create and then if you
11:28 - go yeah I'm just gonna close this video
11:33 - um if you go down here to this bottom
11:36 - button in the bottom left then and that
11:40 - is the add an extension button so if you
11:42 - click on it there's all these different
11:44 - blocks you can add to scratch these ones
11:47 - up top are software extensions so
11:50 - they're built into just about most
11:52 - computers like you've got music and pen
11:54 - that should work on any machine video
11:55 - sensing you just need a webcam and then
11:59 - here we have our hardware extensions
12:01 - that you need some kind of hardware to
12:04 - connect to so we have make it a key
12:05 - micro bit on a bunch of Lego ones and
12:09 - veneer so if you just you know you can
12:13 - click on one and then it'll help you
12:16 - connect to that device and it adds these
12:19 - you know I had an item micro bit so
12:22 - it'll add these new blocks that let you
12:25 - code with a micro bit
12:28 - also if when you're going to this add an
12:33 - extension button and if you when you
12:39 - click on this when you click on an
12:40 - extension to add it this help button for
12:44 - all of our hardware extensions if you
12:46 - click on it will take you to a landing
12:48 - page that has a lots of information
12:51 - about requirements for work doing that
12:54 - hardware extension how to get it
12:56 - connected installing scratch link with
12:58 - which helps will you need to connect to
13:01 - any hardware um and then down here it
13:05 - has some very initial things to try and
13:07 - then they have three starter projects
13:09 - that we've designed for getting people
13:11 - started so yeah that uh that'll do it
13:15 - for extensions and here right here in
13:18 - the slides we have
13:19 - okay oh yeah totally I'll I'll show one
13:23 - more time how to get to get to the
13:25 - landing pages or the yeah yeah yeah yeah
13:31 - so totally um so you know again down
13:34 - your bottom left is the add an extension
13:36 - and then any of these Hardware
13:39 - extensions so my cravat
13:41 - if I just click on it in the extensions
13:43 - library then this menu pops up and it's
13:46 - this button that says help will take you
13:49 - to that landing page also
13:51 - scratch.mit.edu slash uh whatever the
13:57 - name is a bit of ice so slash my crabbit
13:58 - slash boost / 83 / lee news flash for
14:01 - ringer will be all the links here those
14:03 - one super tiny tip with extensions is so
14:07 - we mentioned downloading um scratch link
14:09 - you also want to make sure you have that
14:11 - running anytime you want to use that
14:12 - extension I think that's something that
14:15 - people forget sometimes oh that's oh yes
14:17 - I wanna make tiny tip cool Wow so that
14:21 - was a lot of that was a lot of good
14:22 - information right there so I want to
14:24 - remind again people to be asking
14:25 - questions in the chat I'm gonna I'm
14:28 - gonna try to add to this conversation by
14:30 - sharing a bit about the scratch online
14:32 - community and I see there's some
14:34 - scratchers to some folks in the only
14:36 - community in the chat right now and I
14:37 - want to share with folks there's so many
14:40 - fun things to engage with in the online
14:42 - community I wanted to highlight just
14:45 - three of them so I'm we're screen
14:48 - sharing now so I could just jump to one
14:49 - of these tabs right so let's go back so
14:51 - the nice thing is you just go to scratch
14:53 - stop and we see that edu and so this is
14:55 - the online community we can stay logged
14:57 - out as we cruise through this so I want
14:59 - to show you here on the home page if you
15:01 - scroll down you'll see we have a couple
15:03 - rows here we have future projects
15:05 - featured studios project curated by but
15:07 - then we have this road called the
15:09 - scratch design studio and for folks that
15:12 - are familiar scratch design studios are
15:14 - essentially thematic studios that change
15:17 - every month or two and they're around
15:19 - certain themes so for instance puzzles
15:21 - the puzzle these are projects around
15:23 - puzzles we've had like in the year 3000
15:27 - design a restaurant and every theme is
15:31 - inviting to
15:32 - the scratchers of various sort of levels
15:35 - of expertise or familiarity with scratch
15:37 - and so this is a wonderful opportunity
15:38 - if you have a classroom with kids and
15:41 - you're thinking about how you want to
15:42 - engage with the online community this is
15:43 - I think a good first step it's a fun
15:46 - theme and then what you can do is when
15:48 - you create a project you can sort of
15:51 - leave a comment here with the project ID
15:53 - and then one of the curators will add it
15:55 - to the studio and this is like a really
15:57 - really living breathing wonderful place
15:59 - to sort of get your feet wet in the
16:01 - community and even if you're kind of
16:04 - looking for inspiration even if you
16:05 - happen in the community a long time I
16:07 - think the scratch design studio is
16:08 - definitely one of the first places that
16:11 - I would suggest checking out another one
16:14 - that's a resource is the next to them
16:17 - going to talk about rather you can find
16:19 - via the search bar so one thing that I
16:23 - love about scratchers is that they want
16:26 - to help each other so if they learned
16:27 - something they want to sort of share
16:29 - that learning and one way in which you
16:31 - see this happening is literally just
16:33 - type in a tutorial in the search bar I
16:36 - spell that right
16:37 - I'm live in front of a bunch of people I
16:39 - think I did I spell it right thank thank
16:40 - God so yeah if you type tutorial you can
16:44 - see a number of different tutorials that
16:46 - are scratch elated you know what's even
16:47 - cooler - I'm not even cooler what's also
16:50 - cool is there's a lot of artists in the
16:52 - the scratch community that want to share
16:54 - about drawing and vector bitmap and so
16:56 - it's gonna be a nice mix of sort of
16:58 - coding related art related tutorials
17:01 - sometimes what's also cool is this is
17:03 - gonna bring us the projects related to
17:05 - tutorials but also you can check out
17:07 - studios and these are sort of curated
17:09 - spaces of tutorials so I could check out
17:12 - those so for instance maybe you type an
17:14 - art tutorial and see what comes up or
17:16 - platform tutorial things like that I
17:19 - think it's safe to say there are tens of
17:22 - thousands of tutorials out there made by
17:24 - scratchers so if you're looking for some
17:26 - help on a project or want some new ideas
17:28 - check those out one more sort of
17:32 - resource that I want to show folks that
17:34 - I get really excited about kind of like
17:36 - a broken record it's this concept of an
17:38 - engine project so let me bring this up I
17:41 - spelled engine right ok good I'm so
17:44 - nervous to misspell in front of you all
17:47 - so the idea behind an engine project is
17:50 - this will have like the fundamental code
17:52 - that might power project so if you're
17:55 - thinking about how you want to add
17:56 - gravity to your project or let's type in
17:58 - the platform engine let's see what this
18:02 - brings up this will give you sort of the
18:05 - bare-bones code and usually it's
18:07 - commented and that can help you get sort
18:09 - of a running start if you will and build
18:13 - off that project so I just clicked here
18:14 - I researched platforming engine because
18:16 - we might want to work on a platformer
18:17 - game and so we see here we can go back
18:20 - and forth let's see inside really quick
18:23 - so here we go we can see the code and
18:27 - it's nicely commented for us so we get a
18:29 - sense of how it was built so you might
18:32 - backpack you might throw this code in
18:34 - your backpack and that's that gives you
18:36 - a nice sort of jumping-off point for
18:37 - your project and there are thousands of
18:40 - engines out here on scratch so pretty
18:43 - much if you type in the search bar blank
18:45 - engine you might find one and also if if
18:48 - if you're feeling like you have a
18:50 - concept or an idea that you want to
18:52 - share gosh I would really I really you
18:54 - know suggest making one of these
18:55 - yourself and sharing them with
18:56 - commenting um you can see they're very
18:58 - popular and I always do appreciate when
19:01 - I'm trying to figure out something if I
19:02 - search online on scratch and find an
19:04 - engine to help me so those are just
19:06 - three things in the scratch online
19:08 - community if you weren't aware of and I
19:10 - just think it's a really special place
19:12 - because of those scratches that are in
19:14 - there so yeah alright so the next thing
19:20 - we're gonna chat about is scratch
19:22 - desktop um so if you're working in a
19:25 - place where you don't have great
19:27 - internet access or maybe you have no
19:29 - internet access at all you can still use
19:31 - scratch um so if you go to
19:34 - scratch.mit.edu slash download um which
19:40 - I'm gonna go there right now it's
19:43 - everything you need to figure out which
19:45 - version of scratch desktop will work on
19:47 - your machines and kind of gets you
19:49 - started setting up scratch and we also
19:53 - have scratch 2.0 which educators ask us
19:56 - sometimes because they're used to using
19:58 - or they created
19:59 - you know resources 42.0 I mean I also
20:02 - even have one point for so if you are
20:05 - using older computers that are not
20:08 - compatible with 3.0 we also have these
20:11 - other two options down here one thing
20:14 - that's really great about scratch
20:15 - desktop is that you can still access the
20:17 - whole library of tutorials so if you
20:20 - still want to use those resources with
20:21 - your students and you don't have access
20:24 - to the Internet you can download a
20:26 - scratch desktop and you can still access
20:28 - all those things one major tip for kind
20:31 - of classroom management that I think is
20:32 - a good thing to know about scratch
20:34 - desktop is you'll have to you know file
20:36 - if you go into savor creating something
20:38 - and it ends up in the same place on
20:41 - scratch desktop you'll actually need to
20:43 - save the UM to your computer so you'll
20:46 - have to save files just like you would
20:48 - if you were using any other kind of
20:49 - offline piece of software to the desktop
20:52 - and then load them in with scratch
20:55 - desktop when you're working on them
20:58 - again so that's kind of I would say them
21:00 - the most major difference of just using
21:03 - scratch to create projects offline cool
21:06 - so do we want to talk a bit more about
21:08 - ways to sort of engage in some of these
21:10 - resources maybe connect with educators
21:12 - yes so I'll kick it off I can start with
21:14 - sip so scratching practice for those
21:16 - that aren't familiar it's sort of a
21:18 - monthly series that we've been working
21:20 - on here at the scratch team to sort of
21:22 - highlight educator strategies and
21:23 - educator voices around using scratch in
21:26 - your practice so I think we actually
21:28 - have a tab with scratch with sip open do
21:30 - we not yes nice present they all look
21:35 - like scratch but anyway so we started
21:38 - when we start this February yes so we
21:41 - started in February so each each month
21:43 - has a different theme and within a theme
21:45 - we have a bunch of resources to check
21:48 - out so let's check out some of the past
21:50 - themes really quick so we'll go view all
21:52 - themes we can see getting started was in
21:55 - February curriculum connection so how
21:57 - you connect scratch to your curriculum
21:58 - many pass many styles that's thinking
22:00 - about ways to introduce scratch and and
22:04 - then we have peer learning so the
22:05 - collaboration that happens in scratch so
22:06 - I'm gonna quickly kind of search through
22:09 - one of these pages so let's jump to
22:10 - curriculum
22:11 - connections this is going to show you
22:13 - what one month looks like we have here
22:16 - sort of an actionable thing to do so
22:18 - this is a workshop it's really great at
22:20 - sort of connecting to the curriculum
22:22 - create a story you know there's so many
22:24 - different ways that you can be using the
22:26 - the creative story activity and so I
22:29 - could click go to activity guy that sort
22:31 - of helps you understand how you would
22:33 - implement this in your classroom well
22:35 - usually I'm a minute with Mitch which is
22:37 - a video where Mitch talks at a high
22:38 - level about sort of the theme and then
22:42 - we have Natalie's notes which sort of
22:45 - digs in a bit deeper and shares some
22:47 - examples so for instance in this
22:50 - Natalie's notes you're gonna you're
22:52 - gonna see actual examples of kids using
22:55 - scratch in a variety of different
22:58 - classes you see here the water cycle is
23:00 - one one one project that we're
23:02 - highlighting here and then we usually
23:04 - have a featured resource or two as well
23:07 - so this is time to scratch add and then
23:10 - super important we want to highlight
23:11 - those educator voices and so we'll have
23:14 - at the bottom of every month
23:16 - educators talking about how it is
23:18 - they're you know using scratch as it
23:20 - relates to that month so in this case we
23:22 - have Gulen Miguel talking about a
23:24 - wonderful project about making their own
23:27 - botanical garden and and Justin talking
23:32 - about projects around sort of youth
23:35 - interests and sort of what they are
23:37 - passionate about and so this is just
23:39 - kind of our we're trying to go this
23:41 - route we're four months in we've got a
23:43 - lot of cool content to cruise through so
23:45 - again if you go to the SIPP website and
23:47 - do you all themes you can check out the
23:49 - different months and this homepage now
23:51 - looks a little bit different because
23:52 - we're in the summer so we sort of step
23:55 - back and for three months we actually
23:56 - spent that time going to a number of
23:59 - conferences trying to meet with
24:00 - educators but SIPP will start up again
24:03 - in September am i right mmm yeah and
24:07 - everyone's like they're doing it looks
24:09 - like it yeah so we're still working
24:12 - through what September looks like for
24:14 - SIPP September and Beyond looks like per
24:16 - said but I think there's also a survey I
24:18 - was supposed to pitch a survey right yes
24:20 - that's true yes okay link to
24:23 - there's a link on the next slide to a
24:24 - survey which is important and I'm gonna
24:28 - toss it to someone else to explain it
24:30 - oh okay
24:33 - so yeah the the SIPP survey is kind of I
24:36 - think so scratching practice we're just
24:38 - trying to figure out like you know we're
24:40 - really focused on empowering educators
24:42 - who are using scratch in their classroom
24:43 - and we'd like to learn more about what
24:46 - we could do to best support you all and
24:49 - I don't know Lily do you have anything
24:50 - to add to that yeah so it's super
24:53 - helpful to kind of if you do fill it out
24:56 - we really do appreciate it and one thing
24:58 - I can say about the the scratch team
25:00 - overall is like all the feedback that we
25:02 - get we really do care about and
25:03 - everybody here puts a lot of work into
25:05 - making sure that we're you know serving
25:09 - scratch users and educators who are
25:12 - using scratch can I have one more point
25:14 - to scratch and practice sure I'm gonna
25:15 - go back a slide because we're talking
25:16 - about scratch in practice um I forgot to
25:19 - mention that every month we also tend to
25:21 - have a Twitter chat a Twitter chat
25:23 - wherein you can sort of ask questions
25:25 - about that theme and resurfacing content
25:27 - and even this webinar is sort of
25:30 - scratching practice related this is part
25:31 - of our summer of scratch scratching
25:33 - practice so shout out to the Twitter
25:35 - chats
25:36 - okay yeah one of their resources that I
25:40 - wanted to share with you all that's not
25:41 - a part of a scratch website is learning
25:44 - Creative Learning and learning creating
25:47 - learning is a free six week course that
25:51 - you can take focus on creative learning
25:54 - so it's not necessarily scratch focus
25:56 - though there might be some scratch
25:57 - involved but it's an interactive course
26:00 - online where you'll participate in
26:02 - weekly video meetings forums discussions
26:04 - hands-on activities and exchange
26:07 - facilitation ideas with other educators
26:09 - from around the world and actually one
26:11 - of the coolest things obviously you know
26:12 - you can click through and see all the
26:14 - different parts of this course and the
26:15 - website but one of the things that gets
26:17 - me super excited is when you scroll down
26:19 - and you see the map of who's
26:20 - participating and learning Creative
26:22 - Learning and it really is you know a
26:24 - global community of people focused on
26:27 - creative learning and sharing ideas so
26:30 - definitely if you're working on finding
26:33 - new ways to bring creativity into your
26:34 - classroom
26:35 - learning Creative Learning is a
26:37 - wonderful resource and I think it's
26:39 - definitely something that can be used
26:40 - ham and ham a scratch
26:42 - all right all right yeah I think that
26:44 - brings yeah you and I we like show our
26:56 - amazing the wall the whole time yeah
27:01 - we're still here yeah so I think now
27:05 - we've been pretty I'm actually impressed
27:07 - by the fact that it is 1228 and you're
27:09 - just about hitting the halfway mark and
27:11 - we're ready to start answering I hope we
27:13 - have a half-hour of questions I hope
27:14 - people are asking questions yeah yeah
27:15 - sweet okay yeah just a little further
27:19 - okay wait so we should start answering
27:22 - questions right yeah you're reading the
27:33 - question thanks for your questions in
27:39 - the chat and the Google Form again if
27:41 - you want to share questions we're on
27:43 - twitter at hashtag expression practice
27:45 - or there's a Google form that we shared
27:47 - I don't know if we actually might have a
27:48 - slide we know we can we can share that
27:51 - again or you can just type right in the
27:53 - chat why don't I get started off with a
27:56 - question about students who are already
27:58 - like familiar with scratch a bit and
28:00 - they're looking to go beyond what
28:01 - they've already tried good I'm sure yeah
28:04 - I'm happy to take that one I'm not quite
28:06 - sure what to do with the computer so you
28:07 - can see all of us yeah but yeah I'm one
28:11 - of the things I think and Eric really
28:13 - highlighted this nicely while he was
28:14 - chatting it is a really great way to
28:16 - kind of support like if you have a bunch
28:18 - of different learners in your classroom
28:20 - and everybody's kind of working at their
28:21 - own pace a great way to support kids is
28:25 - by you know connecting them with the
28:28 - scratch community and if that's not
28:29 - something you're quite ready to do in
28:31 - your classroom you don't feel like
28:32 - you've explored enough on your own one
28:34 - of the things you can do is either find
28:37 - a project or you know projects a
28:39 - collection of projects or a studio that
28:41 - relates to what that students interested
28:43 - in or the kind of project they're trying
28:44 - to create and share that with them
28:46 - because it's a great way for them to
28:47 - kind of
28:49 - you know remix another person's project
28:51 - and see how it works and that sort of
28:52 - thing I think a lot of scratchers once
28:54 - they get into dive into scratch are
28:57 - really learning from each other which i
28:58 - think is what's so wonderful right yeah
29:01 - so much I see another question actually
29:04 - from from me thinking about if there
29:08 - will be a scratch conference this year
29:10 - and next year this year the scratch
29:15 - conference is in in Cambridge UK hosted
29:19 - by Raspberry Pi um the next year it will
29:22 - be again in Cambridge here oh my god
29:25 - yeah rich Massachusetts here at MIT yes
29:30 - need to be announced oh yeah we also
29:33 - have details on the scratching practice
29:35 - website about the UK conference and some
29:38 - other events that are upcoming there's
29:40 - also a conference in Chile yes sure as
29:43 - well I believe
29:43 - yeah time travel backs again so you can
29:49 - make that happen I feel like we need a
29:51 - turntable yeah so actually and I might
30:05 - screen share again for this so hold on
30:08 - one second will I awkwardly
30:10 - do that no it's important so there's a
30:15 - creative curriculum computing guide and
30:18 - I'm gonna I have that window open so I'm
30:20 - gonna go here we go so there's an entire
30:22 - website developed by scratch Edie who
30:26 - also produces a lot of content and we
30:28 - work with them quite a bit around
30:30 - scratch and they actually have a really
30:32 - wonderful creative computing curriculum
30:35 - which is available entirely on their
30:37 - website for free you can download it as
30:39 - a PDF or you can go through it on their
30:42 - website so it contains everything from
30:44 - things that might get you kind of
30:46 - started or more like a kind of
30:49 - conceptual aspect of you know how you
30:52 - might introduce this to students to even
30:53 - things that support you in the classroom
30:55 - like here's a reflection page page that
30:58 - helps students reflect on their work so
31:01 - it has a lot of really great resource
31:03 - to support educators who are using
31:04 - scratch in their classroom so that's
31:07 - definitely kind of where I would start
31:09 - if I was using scratch in my classroom
31:10 - right now that's a creative creative
31:13 - computing curriculum yeah I know I
31:16 - always yes yes yes I'm cool and actually
31:21 - should I show what we're up here did we
31:23 - want to show a link to something else
31:24 - earlier that we did oh the slides I just
31:26 - know how you could submit questions oh
31:27 - yeah I mean so here's yeah here's where
31:29 - you can see I'll leave that up her for a
31:31 - minute oh yeah great
31:34 - so we also were getting a lot of
31:35 - questions about teacher accounts in
31:38 - terms of like great suggestions for
31:39 - changes and questions about the status
31:41 - of that proposed scratch and scratch jr.
31:45 - know I can also yeah I think that um we
31:49 - are we really appreciate we so right
31:52 - where we're right now just like in a
31:55 - gathering feedback mode necessary saying
31:57 - that it's just great to hear what what
32:01 - you would like in teacher accounts like
32:04 - but and basically if you could just put
32:05 - all of your thoughts and feedback into
32:07 - this surgery um that would be great
32:10 - because then we will get them and the
32:11 - whole team will so yeah thank you so
32:15 - much to those of you who've already been
32:16 - sending in suggestions both in the
32:18 - Google forum or in the chat or in this
32:20 - survey um some other things actually I
32:22 - guess I can answer this quickly there's
32:24 - people asking about scratch for
32:26 - Chromebooks and scratch for Raspberry Pi
32:29 - and we're excited the team is actively
32:30 - working on both of those and so there
32:33 - will be a version on Chromebooks later
32:35 - this year and raspberry PI's is also in
32:38 - progress for later this year so stay
32:39 - tuned for some announcements about that
32:44 - another question that came in early it
32:47 - was how can you embed scratch projects
32:49 - can you embed scratch projects on a
32:51 - webpage message back to so can you
32:57 - invent scratch projects on your website
32:59 - the answer is yes so let me let me let
33:03 - me show you so let's go scratch website
33:05 - so let's say the breath of the wild
33:08 - project we want to embed so we'll go to
33:10 - the project page and then it's two
33:13 - clicks so what you'll do is you will
33:16 - one so I go to project page then you
33:19 - hear it says copy link so I will click
33:21 - that copy link and then you'll see this
33:24 - is the link to the project and this is
33:25 - the embed code so the embed
33:27 - it's an iframe so you just drop it on
33:30 - your web page and it will be there yeah
33:33 - whoo so again copy link can get you that
33:37 - it's the same embed code is 2.0 nothing
33:40 - nothing nothing new there I got so many
33:46 - questions thank you we can make this
33:50 - work sure well not stop broadcast oh my
33:56 - oh my god the scratchcards online the
34:06 - same cards that you have available
34:07 - purchase how do you get the cards yeah
34:10 - so the scratchcards online and the ones
34:12 - that are available for purchase are the
34:14 - same content you can download a PDF on
34:17 - our website on the ideas page for free
34:19 - but if you want a nice printed box of
34:22 - cards you can also order them from
34:26 - Amazon no starch press prints them for
34:28 - us and we're super excited to see them
34:30 - out in the world so yeah they are the
34:34 - same content wise yeah let's really look
34:36 - so like tips its ideas page and then
34:38 - it's scrolling down BAM download PDF
34:43 - right beside it so that PDF of all the
34:45 - cards and actually there's a bonus set
34:48 - of cards in the back well yes PDF if you
34:50 - download it that is at least it should
34:52 - be so care yes for video sensing so we
34:55 - actually have a deck of cards for video
34:57 - sensing that is not so our the deck of
35:00 - cards you buy online doesn't have any
35:02 - extensions really in it um so yeah we
35:06 - have this deck of cards that we
35:08 - developed for video sensing and we
35:09 - figured we'd include those in the PDF so
35:11 - that's kind of like a little surprise
35:13 - extra for anyone who downloads that PDF
35:15 - but wait there's more yeah cool yeah
35:20 - this is a tough one someone asked about
35:22 - like grading and assessment of student
35:24 - projects if there are supports for that
35:28 - or ways that you think about that
35:30 - the one thing that I've heard I've just
35:34 - been traveling this month to a couple of
35:35 - conferences talking to teachers about uh
35:37 - how they use scratch and this came up a
35:40 - bunch and a couple of teachers that felt
35:42 - really confident about it
35:43 - would sort of create rubrics with
35:46 - students at the beginning like talk
35:47 - about how about making a conversation
35:49 - with students like what do you think is
35:51 - would be okay we're making a game in
35:53 - this class what should I have the
35:54 - components okay yeah sure you can have a
35:56 - win condition and maybe a game over and
35:58 - like you know some kind of user input
36:01 - and so build obviously that's just for
36:03 - games but building the what the students
36:06 - think would make up a good strategy
36:08 - because you know we all know that like
36:10 - the number of blocks or all these things
36:12 - like they never quite describe like how
36:15 - much work this didn't put in and stuff
36:16 - so I think that you know and I think it
36:19 - would be a really good idea for a
36:20 - scratching practice theme is like
36:21 - assessment or you know yeah like how did
36:24 - I do it
36:24 - yeah I think that's a big thing that's
36:25 - really tough to tackle in one question
36:27 - and it is oftentimes it's really
36:29 - specific to the group of students you're
36:31 - working with and the kind of content
36:33 - that you're covering you know I used to
36:35 - be a high school art teacher and I would
36:37 - spend like hours making rubrics just
36:40 - kind of carefully designing them to be
36:41 - open-ended enough for my students to be
36:43 - able to explore but then to also support
36:45 - me when I was trying to be fair and
36:46 - assessing their work um one thing I know
36:49 - and this is kind of just a smaller thing
36:51 - is like whenever we run a workshop kind
36:53 - of how we gauge our own success is that
36:55 - we look at the diversity of student
36:57 - projects and we know that if we created
37:00 - a truly open-ended project and supports
37:02 - students exploring that there none of
37:05 - their projects look the same at they
37:06 - were for the most part they've all kind
37:07 - of explored and felt free to express
37:09 - their own ideas and I think when we kind
37:12 - of feel like we really need to do more
37:13 - work on a resource that we're creating
37:15 - is when we see a bunch of projects that
37:17 - all look the same so for us that's kind
37:20 - of like I think a bar that we set for
37:22 - ourselves
37:23 - I mean it's more about self assessment
37:25 - yeah but I do think that you know we
37:27 - place a strong emphasis on creativity
37:29 - and I think definitely for scratch and
37:32 - practice can assess of assessing
37:34 - creative learning is a big challenge and
37:36 - I think a bigger question that we want
37:37 - to address their screens and related to
37:42 - thinking about that there's pee
37:43 - asking about like professional
37:44 - development opportunities workshops like
37:47 - we mentioned the conference like what
37:48 - kinds of opportunities are there for
37:50 - teachers who are like getting started
37:51 - with scratch I'm wanting to share with
37:53 - others and find out more well one that
37:56 - comes to mind is the scratch ed meetups
37:58 - so if folks aren't familiar with scratch
38:01 - scratch heads out of Harvard and they're
38:03 - focused on sort of connecting with
38:05 - educators who are using scratch and
38:07 - they're getting brilliant work I don't
38:09 - know maybe the pulp the website really
38:11 - quick scratch n meetups so um scratch
38:15 - that has a number of resources online
38:17 - like the creative computing curriculum
38:19 - guide but they also have the support a
38:24 - network of what they call scratch ed
38:26 - meetups which are events that are
38:31 - organized by educators around the world
38:33 - wherein they invite educators to share
38:36 - periodically together what it is they're
38:40 - working on and there's a couple dozen
38:44 - that are like active happening around
38:47 - the world
38:47 - Keio is now showing you sort of like the
38:52 - listing here and in fact if you want to
38:55 - start a scratch ed meetup that is
38:59 - something that is totally possible and I
39:01 - believe the scratch ed website has
39:03 - information on how you would do that
39:05 - they have this really brilliant kit that
39:08 - this is like wonderful book that
39:09 - explains sort of all the aspects of a
39:11 - scratch I'd meet up and there's really
39:14 - nothing like going to a meetup to talk
39:15 - with educators nearby to see what
39:17 - they're working on it's a really really
39:19 - wonderful experience so I think of PD
39:22 - and scratch that comes to mind is at
39:25 - least one thing that you all should
39:27 - really really know about yeah and I
39:30 - think that we are looking into exploring
39:32 - the idea of doing more PD and yeah I
39:36 - think if should we like people are
39:40 - interested in that should they say in
39:41 - survey hairlike yeah yeah I mean
39:43 - definitely if you if you have anything
39:45 - or specific opinions or feelings about
39:47 - what you would most need from the
39:49 - scratch team as far as professional
39:50 - development that is definitely something
39:52 - that we're thinking about in the future
39:54 - how we can support more educators and
39:56 - definitely scratching practice is also
39:58 - part of that and that's something that
39:59 - launched in February that we're still
40:00 - building and learning about how we can
40:03 - best support educators through things
40:05 - like sip and also how we can support
40:07 - people in person as well yeah hopefully
40:12 - we'll do Mario sorry please
40:13 - I was totally doing more webinars and
40:15 - sit I mean supposed also like something
40:16 - that like we're really trying to focus
40:17 - in on yeah someone's asking about
40:21 - scratch on little phones what the
40:24 - opportunities are for that I can do
40:28 - anything also in it yeah that's me
40:30 - that's a good question
40:30 - so but one way is you can outplay it
40:34 - scratch project on mobile phones so
40:35 - that's good
40:36 - feel free to chime in folks in the room
40:39 - Qi I do think there's a lot of thinking
40:41 - of like how it is you'd have like a good
40:43 - experience coding I'm you're known yeah
40:45 - and so I don't want to give a non-answer
40:49 - but I do think it's something that we're
40:51 - looking into but I think there's just a
40:53 - lot to think about there and so the fact
40:55 - that you can now at least sort of engage
40:56 - with the scratch project and watch on
40:57 - your mobile phone is a good step in the
40:59 - right direction but yeah yeah yeah I
41:03 - guess there are no guns we got more they
41:04 - answer than that yeah them creating
41:09 - creating project experience on mobile
41:11 - like isn't I'd rather go to my computer
41:13 - but tablet yeah yeah it would be
41:18 - incorrect to say we're not thinking
41:19 - about it but I don't have we don't have
41:21 - any like nightly inside information on
41:23 - when if that's gonna it's becoming it's
41:25 - really something on their mind yeah but
41:28 - it's one of the exciting things about
41:29 - 3.00 is that you can use it across news
41:31 - any time it's great it's wonderful to
41:33 - watch that funny something fun yeah yeah
41:34 - and the end and the yeah just there's
41:37 - lots of really cool mobile projects and
41:39 - like uhmm Oh someone's asking what can
41:43 - we look for with scratch in the hour of
41:45 - code this year yeah so we are I you know
41:51 - I don't know how much of this I can
41:52 - reveal but we have been working with
41:55 - Cartoon Network again this year to
41:58 - create a project for hour of code we're
42:01 - super excited about it they're you know
42:04 - I just we're sharing resources back and
42:07 - forth and they're creating
42:10 - some awesome sprites for fur scratch so
42:13 - you'll be able to edit and interact with
42:14 - those sprites and scratch yeah I don't
42:17 - know how much more we want to say we're
42:23 - so working on it and though I do kind of
42:25 - like the idea of people being surprised
42:27 - yeah yeah we're we're still working on
42:29 - it we're excited about it so we'll
42:31 - definitely have at least one activity in
42:33 - our code this year yeah we're also
42:36 - helping with Africa code week yes
42:38 - imagine if activity that is now live in
42:41 - the editor imagine a world it's it's a
42:44 - it's a really awesome new tutorial super
42:47 - open-ended and so that's something look
42:49 - forward to you can use that today
42:50 - actually it's a man it's in the skaters
42:53 - are right now we designed that
42:54 - specifically for one of these competing
42:58 - so yeah questions I also see we have a
43:04 - lot of people who are writing in great
43:05 - like requests and feedback about scratch
43:07 - jr. and I'm so we'd love to hear more
43:09 - about that in the survey I don't know we
43:11 - can speak as much to it right now but
43:13 - that's something that we're always
43:14 - thinking about and would love to hear
43:15 - from you in terms of that and we also
43:18 - have like questions about extension
43:21 - someone asking can you make your own
43:22 - extensions uh yes yes the answer is yes
43:28 - and there is documentation that exists
43:34 - to help you let's let's let's circle
43:37 - back to that in like five minutes I'm
43:40 - gonna I'm gonna search because I think I
43:41 - could actually answer that or maybe
43:42 - maybe maybe Natalie or someone in the
43:44 - chat can link to it but but the answer
43:47 - is yes and there's documentation to help
43:49 - you understand how to do that
43:50 - I believe sorry I need to put me on this
43:54 - back so I'm gonna go over here and look
43:55 - at that great and someone's asking about
43:59 - like other physical devices that are
44:01 - supported with scratch I mean we've
44:02 - already you spoke to some of them if you
44:05 - want to mention what hardware right
44:06 - primarily at this point in time the
44:09 - things that Zoe introduced us to for the
44:11 - hardware that we support in the
44:13 - extensions library in scratch or what
44:14 - we're supporting right now but I'm just
44:16 - like our tutorials library that library
44:19 - will also grow over time so death
44:22 - keep an eye on things and check back I
44:23 - don't think that any of us can quite
44:26 - speak to like how soon specific things
44:28 - will be added but um definitely that
44:30 - library will always be growing another
44:33 - pretty common question is about the
44:35 - center sprite tool question will it come
44:38 - back or is it community but it it it is
44:42 - plans to come back we've heard a lot of
44:44 - people say that they want it so I it is
44:47 - it is on the list of things that are
44:49 - coming back I don't know when but I do
44:51 - know it's yeah yeah I was coming back
44:54 - thanks for asking did we miss it yeah
44:58 - okay can I move back to the extension
45:02 - question yes I Google Google this I
45:07 - googled scratch three extension
45:08 - documentation and a links to our github
45:11 - repository oh okay that has what looks
45:13 - like this the specs early the
45:15 - documentation of of making it and I hope
45:18 - that is helpful yeah it should be you
45:24 - can also if people do have a question
45:25 - other other questions should be
45:26 - mentioned that contact us yeah yeah so
45:32 - in the footer of the website I think
45:33 - Eric is gonna most venture screenshare
45:35 - momentarily there is a link that and
45:39 - there's a lot of amazing stuff hidden in
45:40 - the footer of the website yeah but
45:59 - there's also contact us and what happens
46:02 - when you contact us is
46:05 - yeah oh my god we raised under support
46:06 - yeah there it is
46:08 - so what happens when you click contact
46:12 - us it gives you a variety of different
46:15 - ways to get in touch with us but we'll
46:18 - probably expect and you can send us
46:21 - basically an email through the contact
46:22 - us page and those kind of gets sorted
46:25 - and sent to groups on the team that are
46:28 - most able to answer those questions so
46:30 - if you do send a question about
46:32 - resources it does come to the three of
46:34 - us and yeah I will say again I think I
46:38 - mentioned this earlier that everybody on
46:39 - this team really really cares very
46:41 - deeply about everybody who's experienced
46:44 - using scratch so you know we do hear
46:50 - that whatever feedback we get through
46:52 - contact us and we definitely address
46:54 - those yeah I might also say to on this
46:58 - date does have links to some of the
47:01 - facts there's actually a lot of like
47:03 - frequently asked questions that we have
47:05 - addressed on the stretch doesn't pertain
47:07 - to scratch and so sometimes it's good
47:09 - just write check out what's already on
47:10 - the site
47:11 - yeah well would now be a good time to
47:13 - address at some point we got a question
47:14 - about like what do you do when things
47:16 - aren't working so yeah this is one of
47:19 - your options but then you know eric has
47:21 - also mentioned this before that a great
47:23 - resource on the scratch website when
47:25 - you've found something challenging it
47:27 - could just be it could be any number of
47:29 - things it could be like you think you
47:31 - might have found a bug in the website or
47:32 - it could be like your project won't work
47:34 - and you need some help debugging that
47:37 - the forums are super helpful because
47:41 - again the scratch community is amazing
47:42 - and then there are people there are
47:44 - scratchers who you know if you post in
47:48 - the forum and ask a question it's very
47:49 - active and you should get a response
47:51 - and/or a reasonable amount of time to
47:54 - whatever question you're asking so that
47:55 - can be a good way to debug things and
47:59 - get answers to questions as well great
48:03 - someone asked me about what your
48:05 - favorite scratch tips all right now
48:07 - we've already covered a lot of them I
48:08 - don't know anyone has anything else they
48:09 - want to share ravers you're actually
48:12 - doing was a great question
48:16 - I I mean I I guess one thing I think is
48:20 - like the backpack is like a super
48:22 - powerful tool for like collaboration
48:24 - whoa we're getting some weird yeah we
48:26 - get rich and I think I even often forget
48:30 - about like I'll be looking at someone
48:32 - else's project me at home you know see a
48:34 - block stack that's like oh I could use
48:36 - that for you know my own project I often
48:39 - forget about the backpack because it's
48:40 - down at the bottom and sometimes kind of
48:43 - hard to see um so yeah I think that's a
48:46 - really great tool for a collaboration
48:48 - like especially if you're an educator
48:49 - and you're asking kids to do group
48:52 - projects and they're working on
48:53 - individual machines that they can like
48:54 - share sprites and they can share code
48:57 - using the backpack is pretty rebel yeah
49:00 - yeah I would say getting involved in the
49:04 - scratch online community I'm not sure
49:05 - that the tip but there's just so many
49:08 - wonderful helpful kind people there's so
49:11 - much inspiration there backpacking
49:13 - sprites checking out the design studios
49:16 - it's just like a whole nother aspect Oh
49:19 - scratch that just saw them so important
49:21 - yeah I think also exploring extensions I
49:24 - know some people who made the 2.0 2 3.0
49:27 - switch feel like they you know
49:30 - separating certain things out into
49:31 - extensions you know kind of hit them a
49:35 - little bit but I think that the in a way
49:38 - it kind of highlights all those
49:39 - different things in a way that's really
49:41 - unique and I think like exploring the
49:43 - software extensions is really great if
49:46 - you don't have any hardware and then you
49:48 - know even software extensions allow you
49:50 - to kind of combine the physical and the
49:52 - virtual and interesting ways like video
49:54 - sensing is really fun so don't forget
49:57 - about extensions I guess great so we
50:00 - only have time for a couple more
50:01 - questions and please do keep asking them
50:03 - we also encourage you to write into the
50:04 - contact us and we can keep on a chat a
50:06 - little bit someone's asking about
50:08 - strategies for time constraints working
50:11 - with stones with scratch in class
50:13 - starter graphics for those for that yeah
50:16 - yeah so um one thing this is just this
50:19 - is this isn't the whole answer
50:21 - but certainly you could think to us to
50:25 - sort of build off of a starter project
50:27 - if you kind of have limb
50:29 - time so again it's ideas page starter
50:31 - projects and these are sort of so simple
50:35 - that you can just start it begins I see
50:36 - so many people about the dark theme we
50:38 - will get to that in a minute I I think
50:41 - that's maybe one sort of thing that you
50:44 - might think to do is because we have
50:46 - stories games animations to sort of look
50:49 - at some of the code and then start to
50:50 - fill out move in is good yeah that is
50:56 - one aspect of that question yeah and
50:58 - even there are a lot of different ways
50:59 - to look at that question it's like are
51:01 - you designing activities that you feel
51:05 - are easily digestible or are you trying
51:07 - to support long-term deeper learning in
51:10 - scratch in like really short chunks of
51:12 - time so again that's like such a big
51:15 - question that I hope that we can like
51:17 - address that more in scratch and
51:20 - practice on that website
51:22 - yeah because there are so many different
51:24 - ways you could you know kind of make
51:27 - better use of your time in a short class
51:30 - period with scratch yeah so thank you
51:32 - for that question and we should then we
51:33 - think to talk about that more injection
51:35 - practices today I mention the dark theme
51:39 - so we're aware that people wanted our
51:42 - theme there's no information that could
51:46 - pass along to you that it's going to
51:47 - happen or not happening but rest assured
51:49 - yeah yeah we know about it yeah it's
51:54 - also put it in the survey also questions
51:59 - about our history so someone asked us
52:01 - about logo insta-kill ago and someone
52:03 - else s why scratch is called scratch it
52:07 - is and I actually um mentioned this
52:10 - really quickly in the chat but yeah it's
52:13 - because I I thought it was because of
52:15 - like cats scratch but it actually is
52:17 - because that DJ's scratching records and
52:23 - like making new music and like because
52:26 - such an important part of scratch is
52:28 - remix in and like changing things up and
52:31 - taking different elements and combining
52:33 - them together that is where it
52:35 - originally came from then I think when
52:36 - they were picking a logo they were like
52:37 - : it cats do scratch so that
52:40 - and and the idea of like making projects
52:42 - from scratch well it makes it so every
52:44 - time when I want to say oh yeah like I
52:46 - made this from scratch I mean I couldn't
52:48 - make it in trash you isn't that fun that
52:49 - you can't stop making something the fun
52:51 - that keeps on giving
52:54 - so I think we have to probably wrap up
52:57 - pretty soon oh there any final reminders
52:58 - that we'd like to share I don't know no
53:02 - we've never done the survey again yeah
53:05 - so if you have more feedback or
53:07 - questions we'd love to hear from you
53:09 - either at the contact us link that we
53:11 - shared or at the survey so we also will
53:16 - be back live again in a we are happy you
53:20 - want to come back we're we're here live
53:22 - July 23rd now the next Tuesday at 7 p.m.
53:26 - a week from the day yes
53:29 - 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time cool yeah and
53:31 - there's a Twitter chat which will be in
53:34 - August to make sure the date right Omega
53:39 - 6 yeah you know what might be fun to is
53:42 - yeah so the scratching practice hash tag
53:44 - is also we invite people on Twitter to
53:46 - be sharing a lot of a lot of these
53:47 - questions are like totally totally
53:49 - related to scratch and practice and so
53:51 - if the chats gonna probably end when we
53:53 - shut down the broadcast so like if you
53:55 - have some of these questions about like
53:56 - oh there's time constraints how do we
53:58 - get around that
53:58 - I would totally suggest on Twitter you
54:01 - know raising that question with the have
54:02 - no distraction practice because that's
54:04 - something that we check you know every
54:05 - day and we'd love to see a lot of
54:07 - conversations or using that hashtag yeah
54:14 - yeah we I was just trying to leave up
54:17 - that link for a bit but yeah yeah this
