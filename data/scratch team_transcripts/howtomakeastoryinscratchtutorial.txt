00:00 - - Hi, everyone.
00:01 - It's ZoÃ« from the Scratch
team, also known as Zinnea.
00:04 - Today I wanted to show you how
to make a story in Scratch.
00:08 - It can have any characters that you want
00:10 - and whatever scenes you want,
00:12 - and you can write all the dialogue,
00:14 - and yeah, by the end of this tutorial,
00:16 - you'll be able to create
any story in Scratch.
00:20 - Let's get started.
00:21 - So first let's pick a character
to be the main character
00:24 - of your story.
00:25 - You can just hover over choose a Sprite.
00:28 - If you wanted to draw your
character, you could click paint.
00:32 - If you wanted to upload a
picture of your character,
00:35 - you could click upload.
00:37 - Or if you wanted to choose one
of the characters in Scratch,
00:40 - you could click choose.
00:41 - And you can have any character
that you'd like to have.
00:45 - I'll take the princess, but
maybe I'll rename the character.
00:49 - I'll name my main character Maya.
00:51 - And let's also add a
backdrop for the first scene
00:54 - of our story.
00:55 - You can hover over choose
a backdrop and click choose
00:59 - and pick a background for
wherever you want the story
01:01 - to take place.
01:02 - Maybe I'll pick the forest background.
01:04 - To start your story,
01:06 - let's make your character say something.
01:08 - You can go to the looks category
and drag out a say block,
01:13 - and they will say whatever's in here.
01:16 - So you can write in whatever
01:18 - you'd like your character to say.
01:20 - And let's put when green
flag clicked block on top,
01:24 - because now every time
I click the green flag,
01:27 - the character says, "Hello."
01:29 - Now, let's say you want
to add another character
01:32 - to your story.
01:33 - You can just hover over
choose a Sprite again
01:35 - and choose another character.
01:37 - Maybe I'll pick Gobo.
01:39 - And if you want this
character to be facing
01:41 - your main character,
01:43 - you can just click on the costumes tab
01:46 - and click flip horizontal,
and that will flip it.
01:51 - And now you can go back to the code tab.
01:54 - Now let's make this
character have a conversation
01:57 - with the first character.
01:59 - So I will drag out another say
block and all have Gobo say,
02:06 - "Hi, Maya."
02:07 - And I'll put when green
flag clicked block on top
02:11 - so that the conversation can start
02:13 - when the green flag is clicked.
02:16 - Okay, so they both talked,
02:18 - but I don't want them to
both talk at the same time.
02:21 - Here's how I can make
Gobo talk after Maya.
02:25 - I can go to the control category
and drag out a wait block
02:30 - and I'll put that above
the Gobo's say block.
02:35 - And Maya talks for two
seconds, so I can make Gobo
02:41 - wait for two seconds before talking.
02:44 - Let's try that out.
02:49 - Okay, so Maya talks and then Gobo waits
02:52 - and talks after Maya.
02:53 - There we go.
02:54 - And by the way, let's say
Maya talked for three seconds,
02:59 - then I would just have to make
Gobo wait for three seconds.
03:03 - So if you want a character
to talk after another,
03:06 - they just have to wait for
the same amount of time
03:09 - that the other character is talking.
03:11 - Let's say I want Maya
to say something else
03:13 - after Gobo talks.
03:15 - I can go back to Maya and
have Maya wait for two seconds
03:20 - while Gobo talks.
03:22 - And then maybe say,
"Let's go to the city."
03:25 - Let's try that.
03:27 - There we go.
03:28 - So they go back and forth
with one character waiting,
03:31 - while the other one talks.
03:33 - So that's how you can make a conversation.
03:35 - Now, let's say I want to add another scene
03:38 - and make them go to the city.
03:40 - Here's how you do that.
03:41 - I can hover over choose a
backdrop and click choose.
03:46 - And I'll pick a background
to be the city background.
03:49 - Maybe I'll pick this one.
03:51 - Now, after Maya says,
"Let's go to the city,"
03:55 - how can we switch to the city background?
03:59 - Well, in the looks category,
04:01 - there's this block, switch backdrop,
04:04 - and we can just drag out switch
backdrop to colorful city.
04:08 - Let's try it out.
04:11 - Okay, she says, "Let's go to the city,"
04:14 - and they go to the city backdrop.
04:15 - Now, let's try and restart the project.
04:20 - Okay, when the project starts,
04:22 - we want them to start at
the forest background,
04:25 - so to do that, we just have
to drag out another switch
04:29 - backdrop block and put a
when green flag clicked block
04:33 - on top and now when the
green flag is clicked,
04:38 - they go to the forest and
then they go to the city.
04:42 - There we go.
04:43 - Now, let's say you want to
have a new character show up
04:48 - when they get to a certain scene.
04:50 - Here's how you can do that.
04:51 - I will hover over choose a Sprite
04:53 - and choose a new character.
04:55 - Maybe I'll pick Giga.
04:57 - And we want Giga to appear
05:00 - when the characters get to the city.
05:02 - To make a character appear or disappear,
05:04 - there are these blocks in the
looks category, hide and show.
05:08 - The block hide will make
a character disappear
05:12 - and the block show will
make a character appear.
05:15 - And in the events category,
there's this helpful block,
05:19 - when backdrop switches
to, and with this block,
05:22 - you can make a character
do a certain thing
05:25 - when the backdrop switches
to a certain backdrop.
05:28 - So we want Giga to not be there
05:31 - when we're at the forest scene,
05:33 - so when the backdrop switches to forest,
05:37 - we can make Giga hide.
05:39 - Let's try that out.
05:41 - Okay, there we go.
05:43 - And when we get to the city
scene, we want Giga to show up.
05:47 - So when the backdrop
switches to colorful city,
05:52 - we can make Giga show.
05:54 - And there you go.
05:56 - That's how you can have a
character appear in some scenes,
05:59 - but not all of the scenes.
06:01 - And now, by using these blocks,
06:03 - you can have certain
characters that show up
06:05 - in certain scenes and
other characters show up
06:07 - in other scenes and
you can make your story
06:09 - be exactly how you want it to be.
06:12 - Now, let's say you want
Giga to say something
06:14 - when the characters get to the city.
06:17 - You could use the method
I showed you earlier
06:19 - with the wait blocks
and have Giga do this.
06:22 - When the green flag is clicked,
06:23 - wait seven seconds while
Maya and Gobo talk,
06:27 - and then say something.
06:29 - But it can be kind of annoying
to count all the seconds
06:32 - that many different characters talk for,
06:34 - so I'm gonna show you another way
06:36 - of making a conversation in Scratch.
06:38 - So let's say method one
is using wait blocks.
06:42 - Method two is using broadcasts.
06:44 - So here's how the broadcast method works.
06:48 - You might already know this,
06:49 - but in case you don't, I'll explain.
06:52 - A broadcast in Scratch is
like an invisible message
06:57 - that one character sends out,
06:59 - and then you can make other characters
07:01 - do something specific when
they get that message.
07:06 - So when Maya finishes talking here,
07:10 - I can have Maya broadcast message one.
07:13 - She sends out the invisible
signal, message one.
07:16 - And then if I click on Giga, I can say,
07:21 - when I receive message one,
07:23 - I can make it Giga say
something like, "Welcome."
07:26 - So let's try that out.
07:29 - Maya says, "Let's go to the city
07:31 - and she broadcasts message one.
07:34 - And when Giga receives
it, Giga says, "Welcome."
07:38 - Now let's say I want Gobo to say something
07:41 - after Giga finishes talking.
07:43 - I just need to create a new
message by clicking here.
07:47 - I'll call this message two.
07:49 - And then Giga can broadcast message two
07:53 - when they finish talking.
07:54 - And then I'll go to Gobo
and for Gobo I'll say,
07:59 - when I receive message two
say, "I like this place."
08:03 - I don't know, that sounds
like what Gobo might say
08:05 - when they get to the city.
08:06 - So let's try that out.
08:08 - The princess talks, sends a
message, and then Giga talks,
08:11 - and then Giga sends a
message and Gobo talks.
08:14 - So that's how you can do a
conversation with broadcasts.
08:18 - Some people prefer doing
it with wait blocks,
08:20 - some people prefer doing
it with broadcasts,
08:22 - both of them always work.
08:24 - Personally, if I have just two characters,
08:26 - then I think the wait
blocks works pretty well,
08:28 - but I have a hard time keeping
track of the wait times
08:30 - if I have three characters or more,
08:32 - so then I usually use broadcasts.
08:34 - So yeah, with the things I
showed you in this video,
08:37 - you can pretty much make any story.
08:39 - You can switch the backdrop and
have different things happen
08:41 - at different backdrops
and different characters
08:44 - talk to each other.
08:45 - Also, the link to this
project that I made today
08:48 - will be in the description below
08:49 - so you can always remix
that as a starting point.
08:51 - And yeah, I will see you
next time and Scratch on.
