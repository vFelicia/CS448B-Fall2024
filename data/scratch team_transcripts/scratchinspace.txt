00:00 - What happens when you invite kids from
all around the world to create their own
00:03 - computer programs to be used in space?
00:27 - Hey, everyone. It's Eric from the MIT
Scratch Team.
00:31 - If you're not familiar with Scratch.  Scratch is a visual programming
language and online community where
00:35 - people of all ages can create their own
stories games animations. It's quite cool.
00:39 - ... and usually people are creating scratch
projects for Earth. So to be played by
00:45 - someone sitting at their computer here
on earth. However, we ask young people in
00:50 - the Scratch online community what kind
of projects would you create for space?
00:54 - and even cooler, what if instead of using
the keyboard to play the project you use
00:59 - your body. So, we actually asked this
question and we had an overwhelming
01:03 - response hundreds of people submitted
projects from over a dozen countries.
01:09 - We actually selected a small number of
these projects and experimented with
01:12 - them on a special zero gravity flight,
which mimics the weightlessness of space
01:16 - A special shout-out to the MIT Media Lab
Space Exploration Initiative who made
01:21 - this possible so here's some footage of
myself and some other MIT researchers
01:26 - working on other projects on this flight.
05:08 - A special shout-out to everyone who
participated in this initiative. I so
05:13 - wish I could have flown all the projects
but I hope you enjoyed this small
05:16 - experiment and hopefully there's more to
come and with that: Scratch on!
