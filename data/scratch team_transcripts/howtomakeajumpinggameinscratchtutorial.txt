00:00 - - Hi, everyone.
00:01 - It's Zoe from the Scratch team.
00:02 - Also known as Zinnea.
00:03 - Today,
00:04 - I wanted to show you how to
make a jumping game in Scratch.
00:06 - By the end of this tutorial,
00:07 - you'll be able to make
a game like this one,
00:09 - where you can have a
character jumping over
00:11 - moving obstacles.
00:12 - We'll do this in five steps.
00:13 - Make your character jump,
00:15 - make a moving obstacle, stop the game,
00:18 - add more obstacles, and keep score.
00:20 - Let's get started.
00:21 - So first, let's pick a
character, and make it jump.
00:24 - You can pick any character you
want. I will pick the chick.
00:27 - And let's also choose a
backdrop. I'll use the blue sky.
00:30 - To make the character jump upwards,
00:32 - we can use this block,
00:33 - change y by 10
00:36 - And if we make it repeat that 10 times,
00:38 - it'll go up really high.
00:39 - Now, we also want it to come back down.
00:41 - To do this, we can, change y by -10.
00:45 - And let's put that in a repeat loop, too.
00:47 - Nice.
00:48 - It would be fun for the character to jump
00:50 - when we press the space key,
00:51 - so we can add the,
00:52 - when space key pressed
00:53 - block on top.
00:54 - And then, we can make a jump with space.
00:57 - We can also enhance the jump
by making it play a sound,
01:00 - so we can just add this block,
01:01 - start sound Chirp
01:03 - (bird chirping)
Nice.
01:04 - Now our character can jump.
01:05 - Next, let's make a moving obstacle,
01:07 - so our character has
something to jump over.
01:09 - First, let's pick an obstacle.
01:11 - It could be anything you'd like
it to be. I'll pick the egg.
01:13 - I'm actually gonna make
the egg a little smaller,
01:16 - by setting it size to 80.
01:17 - You want the obstacle to be a bit smaller
01:19 - than your character, so your
character can jump over it.
01:21 - Now,
01:22 - we want our obstacle to start
at this side of the screen,
01:24 - and glide over to this side of the screen.
01:27 - First, how do we tell the
egg to start over here?
01:30 - We can tell it to go to a
certain position with this block,
01:33 - go to x and y
01:34 - In Scratch,
01:35 - every position on the stage
has a certain number X,
01:38 - and a certain number Y.
01:40 - In case it's your first time seeing this,
01:42 - X represents how far your sprite is,
01:44 - from this side of the screen
to this side of the screen,
01:46 - so side to side,
01:47 - and Y represents how
high up your sprite is.
01:49 - So, we need to tell the egg to
go to this spot, right here.
01:51 - Here's an easy way to do that.
01:53 - Just drag the egg to
where you want it to go,
01:55 - and then the
01:56 - go to
01:57 - block in the menu over here,
01:58 - actually updates to the
exact X and Y of that spot.
02:02 - So, we can just drag this block out.
02:04 - And then to make the egg
glide across the screen,
02:07 - we can use this block,
02:08 - glide to X Y
02:09 - which makes a sprite glide
smoothly to a certain place.
02:12 - We want the egg to glide to here,
02:14 - so we can just drag the egg over here,
02:16 - and then this glide
block in the menu updates
02:18 - to the X and Y of this spot.
02:20 - So, we can just drag that out, too,
02:23 - and connect it.
02:24 - And now the egg can
glide across the screen.
02:26 - Now, the egg glided once,
02:28 - but we want more eggs to keep coming.
02:30 - We can do that by putting
this in a forever loop,
02:32 - and let's make this start
when we click the green flag.
02:35 - Gliding across the
screen in just one second
02:36 - is a little fast,
02:37 - so let's make the egg take three seconds,
02:40 - to glide across the screen.
02:41 - Now we can jump over obstacles.
02:42 - Next, let's make the game
stop, if we run into the egg.
02:45 - There's this block,
02:46 - stop all
02:47 - that will stop everything in your project.
02:49 - And we can make the egg wait
until it's touching the chick.
02:53 - And then if it does run into the chick,
02:56 - have it stop the game.
02:57 - Let's try that out.
02:58 - I'll purposely not jump.
03:00 - There you go. Everything stopped.
03:01 - Oh, and let's fix this problem.
03:03 - Sometimes the chick gets stuck in the air,
03:06 - because its code gets stopped
when it runs into the egg,
03:09 - but it might not have been
finished with its jump,
03:11 - so it's just frozen there.
03:12 - So, we can fix this by making the chick
03:13 - go to a starting position,
when the game starts.
03:16 - So, I'll put my chick
where I want it to start,
03:19 - and then I will drag out a
03:21 - go to
03:22 - block, which will be set to
that X and Y of that spot.
03:25 - And make that happen when
you click the green flag.
03:27 - (bird chirping)
There we go.
03:29 - Now, to make our game even more fun,
03:31 - let's add more obstacles.
03:32 - It's actually really easy to do that.
03:34 - Just right-click on the egg, and click,
03:37 - duplicate
03:38 - Now we have another egg,
03:39 - with all the same code as the first egg.
03:41 - So, it will glide just
like the first egg does.
03:43 - Let's try it out.
03:44 - So, we can't see the second egg,
03:46 - and that's because it's right
on top of the first egg.
03:49 - They have the exact same code,
03:51 - so they're gliding at the exact same time.
03:53 - So, let's make the second
egg wait one second,
03:55 - before it starts gliding,
03:56 - so that they're spaced
out from each other.
03:58 - Now, this looks good,
03:59 - except this egg is just sitting
in the middle of the screen,
04:02 - while it waits for one second.
04:04 - So, let's make it,
04:04 - hide
04:05 - when the project starts,
so it'll be invisible,
04:07 - and then make it,
04:08 - show
04:09 - once it's done waiting.
04:10 - That looks much better.
04:11 - And lastly, let's add a score,
so the player earns points,
04:15 - every time they jump over the egg.
04:16 - To do this, let's make a variable.
04:18 - In Scratch,
04:19 - you can use a variable to keep track
04:21 - of a certain number in your project.
04:23 - So, I'll make a variable called,
04:24 - score
04:25 - and we'll use it to keep
track of the player score.
04:27 - Every time the player
manages to complete a jump,
04:29 - we can increase their score by one.
04:31 - (bird chirping)
Nice.
04:32 - And when the player loses
and the project restarts,
04:35 - we can set their score back to zero.
04:37 - There we go.
04:37 - That's a jumping game.
04:38 - I hope this tutorial helped you out.
04:40 - There are lots of other
things you could try.
04:42 - You could have multiple
kinds of obstacles,
04:43 - you could have, once the
player reaches a certain score,
04:46 - the backdrop changes, so it's
like they went to level two.
04:48 - I can't wait to see all
the things you make.
04:50 - Well, I'll see you next
time, and, scratch on.
04:53 - (lighthearted music)
