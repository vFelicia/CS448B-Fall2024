00:00 - hi everyone welcome to episode six of
00:03 - our scratch video updates I'm Rick Rose
00:05 - also known as Rick Rose on Scratch and
00:07 - uh I am Eric also known as speak
00:09 - visually on Scratch and we're joining
00:11 - you today for the sixth episode of the
00:13 - scratch video update on the sixth floor
00:17 - deck of the MIT media lab and it's
00:19 - finally warm this is the first warm day
00:21 - we've had in a long time in Boston so
00:23 - Boston can be beautiful be not like that
00:26 - other update that we had in January um
00:29 - so we're glad with you uh we want to
00:31 - start with our first segment Rick Ros is
00:32 - holding the phone but love it the love
00:35 - it section so these are projects that we
00:37 - found in the community that we love and
00:39 - we want to share with you um and the
00:41 - project that I found is actually um it's
00:44 - a contest that's happening and it's
00:46 - called chopped it's a chopped contest
00:48 - and I'm not sure if you've ever seen the
00:50 - television show I think it's called
00:51 - chopped but it's essentially where you
00:54 - create your own dish and you share it
00:56 - with people and since this is scratch um
00:58 - you create a scratch project with your
01:00 - dish and so people are creating
01:03 - different uh Entre and and sharing them
01:06 - um in a scratch project it reminds me of
01:08 - the edible scratch that we released on
01:10 - April 1st a little bit that was a lot of
01:12 - fun so the project that I love that I
01:14 - saw recently is called adopt an alpaca
01:17 - by Care Bear 17 and you can uh play with
01:22 - an alpaca that you name yourself and uh
01:26 - you can Farm you can uh shower the Alp
01:29 - Al you can also transform your alpaca I
01:32 - turned mine into a uni
01:34 - PKA or a rainbow PKA and uh it's just
01:38 - fun to kind of play with the the aeka
01:41 - you adopted in this project cool and
01:44 - then so I guess our next segment is
01:46 - things to try oh my gosh things to try
01:48 - sorry I almost hit you in the face this
01:50 - things to try um and there are a lot of
01:52 - things to try in the community um but I
01:54 - think one thing that I saw um that I
01:57 - think is fun to jump into is the scratch
01:58 - Design Studio we just released a new one
02:01 - it's create a planet and so it's a
02:03 - really sort of open-ended prompt where
02:05 - you say well what kind of planet would
02:07 - you create and so we've got a couple
02:09 - hundred projects shared already uh one
02:12 - that sticks out to me was a planet it
02:15 - was like it was it was around the theme
02:17 - of cotton candy the planet was made out
02:18 - of cotton candy and it had a moon that
02:22 - was made out of chocolate which I
02:24 - thought it was pretty sweet wow that's
02:26 - that is very sweet yeah that is sweet
02:28 - pun intended
02:30 - one I that was cool okay so I'm on an
02:32 - alpaca theme right now and so it's
02:34 - called an alpaca planet and you can walk
02:37 - around with a Rover and kind of explore
02:41 - the planet I thought that was cool super
02:43 - awesome so make sure to check that out
02:45 - check out the projects and definitely
02:46 - make one as well we also have another
02:48 - thing to try uh we had mentioned scratch
02:50 - day I think about a month ago in the
02:52 - last video update and we've officially
02:54 - launched the website so it's day.
02:57 - scratch.mit.edu you're probably
02:59 - wondering what is scratch day it's
03:01 - essentially just it's a Global Network
03:03 - of events where people come together to
03:05 - celebrate scratch and so that can mean
03:07 - having a pizza party at your house or
03:09 - coming to MIT where we host 300 people
03:12 - for to celebrate scratch so really
03:14 - whatever it is you want to make it you
03:15 - can check out the scratch day website to
03:17 - find out resources on sort of Hosting
03:19 - your own scratch day or finding other
03:21 - scratch days so it's coming up when is
03:23 - it May 9th May 9th but you can host the
03:26 - scratch day anytime and you can have it
03:28 - any time of the year but there something
03:30 - fun about doing it around May 9th with
03:32 - everybody else yeah definitely and then
03:34 - so since we're actually joining you on
03:36 - the sixth floor because we have an event
03:38 - at the media lab called member event
03:41 - where all the groups uh at the media lab
03:43 - share what it is they're working on and
03:46 - we thought it'd be nice we're part of
03:47 - the lifelong kindergarten group uh at
03:49 - the media lab and so we wanted to show
03:51 - you what some of the students are
03:53 - working on in our research group cool
03:56 - let's jump over to our space hi everyone
04:00 - Welcome to our lifelong kindergarten
04:02 - space ready to visit some
04:06 - projects so some scratch demos over
04:13 - here so our first project is Lea who's
04:17 - one of the students hi so I'm working on
04:20 - a project called making good stories
04:22 - where I'm trying to help children to um
04:25 - make things that tell stories about
04:26 - their lives using electronics and
04:28 - computational Tool so as you can see
04:30 - here's an example of a big textile mural
04:33 - with uh electronics embedded inside with
04:36 - like this tiny little computer called
04:38 - Lily tiny which you can
04:39 - sew uh other example is this card where
04:43 - you can see a princess or a girl is
04:45 - dreaming and while she's dreaming she's
04:47 - trying to blow the bubble which are
04:49 - represented with lights now if you see
04:51 - inside there's this tiny little chip
04:54 - that's making the light glow but it's
04:56 - making the light glow like in different
04:57 - patterns like fading you can see it's
04:59 - bright and them and similarly you can
05:02 - make other kinds of projects so yeah
05:04 - that's all I do cool so we're going to
05:07 - shift over to another
05:13 - student so this is Dave he's another
05:17 - graduate student in the group and he's
05:19 - going to share the project with you yeah
05:20 - so I've been um working on helping
05:22 - people make their own electronic
05:23 - products and the best example of that I
05:25 - guess is my DIY cell phone so this is a
05:28 - cell phone I made myself and use every
05:31 - day and um trying to help other people
05:34 - make things like this uh also lots of
05:36 - other kinds of products like radios and
05:38 - speakers and mice and various sorts of
05:40 - Internet connecting things as well so
05:43 - cool well so those are just a couple of
05:45 - projects in the group and I hope you
05:47 - enjoyed the
05:50 - tour there's also all right welcome back
05:53 - everyone I hope you enjoyed the tour of
05:55 - our lab and learning more about our
05:57 - different projects that we have we'll

06:03 - think we're going to enjoy this
