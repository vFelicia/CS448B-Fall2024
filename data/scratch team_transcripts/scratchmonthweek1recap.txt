00:01 - Hey, everyone. My name is Eric,
00:02 - and I want to wish you
a Happy Scratch Month!
00:04 - (crowd cheers)
00:05 - Yes, so we are officially one week
00:06 - into our first ever Scratch Month.
00:08 - And for those aren't
familiar with Scratch Month,
00:10 - it's a global event
00:12 - where people all around the world
00:13 - are invited to come onto
the Scratch on the community
00:15 - and to imagine, to create
00:17 - and share together.
00:18 - And every week,
00:19 - we're going to be launching
some new activities.
00:21 - So a lot has already happened.
00:22 - We're only one week in
00:23 - and I want to give a quick recap
00:25 - of what we've been seeing folks do.
00:27 - So first, we saw over three thousand
00:29 - five hundred people dance their way
00:32 - into Scratch Month.
00:33 - So yes, Scratch Cat put
out a Remixful project
00:35 - that invited people to dance with them.
00:37 - And you all answered the call
00:38 - in like the coolest way possible
00:40 - so that was a super amazing way
00:41 - to start the month.
00:43 - And we also launched a few activities
00:45 - this past Monday.
00:47 - So the first was Scratch Avatar Creators
00:50 - so this is kind of like
Icon Maker projects
00:52 - And we saw some amazing ones.
00:54 - So there was everything from, I think,
00:56 - a duck icon creator
00:57 - to making your own pineapple icon,
01:01 - ice cream, and yes (chuckles),
01:04 - even a human avatar creator.
01:07 - But that's not all.
01:08 - We also launched the DIY Crafts Studio,
01:11 - so these are things
01:12 - so it's like dig into your recycle bin
01:14 - and pull out some materials,
01:15 - and make something pretty cool.
01:16 - I was really lovin'
the DIY Ring Toss game.
01:20 - So just grabbin' some old paper plates,
01:22 - cutting out the middle,
01:23 - and then making them
01:24 - into a super super fun game.
01:26 - But wait, there's even more.
01:27 - So we launched a third activity
01:29 - called Share the Love,
01:31 - which is, as the name says,
01:33 - just sharing the love with Scratch.
01:34 - So we saw beautiful expressions of love,
01:37 - like this simple reminder
that you are important.
01:40 - We saw a shout-out to the folks helping us
01:42 - keep us healthy and safe.
01:44 - We saw an animation where someone
01:45 - literally was covered with love.
01:49 - But don't worry, it
looks like they are okay.
01:51 - We saw a beautiful Mother's Day card.
01:53 - Even this really special greeting
01:55 - from a group of coders in Iraq.
01:57 - So as you can see,
01:58 - it's been an awesome
01:59 - and busy Scratch Month,
02:01 - and I want to remind you,
02:02 - you are all invited to participate.
02:03 - And so if you want to participate,
02:05 - just head over to the Scratch website,
02:07 - www.scratch.mit.edu.
02:08 - And on the homepage,
02:09 - you will see a Featured Studio row,
02:12 - and in that row,
02:13 - you'll see the Scratch Month activities.
02:15 - And of course, we also have a fancy
02:17 - Scratch Month website
02:19 - that you can go to
02:19 - for even more details.
02:21 - So hope to see you online.
Happy Scratch Month.
