00:00 - - Hi everyone.
00:01 - It's ZoÃ« from the Scratch Team.
00:02 - Also known as Zinnea
00:04 - Today I wanted to show you,
00:05 - how to make a scrolling
background in Scratch.
00:07 - By the end of this tutorial,
00:09 - you'll be able to make
a project like this one
00:10 - where the background is
moving behind your character.
00:13 - Let's get started.
00:13 - First, let's pick a character
to be walking in our project.
00:16 - You can just click this button
that says, choose a sprite
00:18 - and then pick any character you want.
00:20 - I will pick Avery walking.
00:23 - So, now let's make a background,
00:25 - but the actual background in
Scratch the stage, can't move.
00:30 - See if you click on it,
00:30 - you'll see it says stage
selected no motion blocks.
00:33 - So, what we're going to do is,
00:35 - we're going to make a sprite
00:36 - and have that sprite be the background
00:39 - and that's gonna be what's moving.
00:40 - So, I'll hover over choose
a sprite and click paint
00:44 - for drawing a scrolling background.
00:46 - The important thing is that this edge
00:48 - of the drawing has to line up
with this edge of the drawing,
00:51 - so that it can transition
smoothly between them.
00:54 - So, my favorite way of doing that quickly
00:56 - is just make one flat
rectangle to be the ground.
01:01 - And then one other flat
rectangle to be the sky.
01:04 - It's good for these edges
to line up with each other.
01:06 - So, I'm just gonna drag this to here.
01:08 - And I also like to add some kind of detail
01:10 - that can be passing by.
01:12 - I showed this in my video
01:12 - on how to draw backdrops in Scratch.
01:14 - But one of my favorite tricks
01:16 - is just to set the color to gray,
01:18 - draw a circle with the circle tool
01:21 - and then just click on
the point editing tool
01:23 - and drag this point upward.
01:27 - Then you got a rock.
01:27 - So, where did my character Avery go?
01:30 - She's behind this backdrop sprite.
01:32 - What we want to do is make this sprite,
01:34 - that is the background,
be on the back layer.
01:37 - And there's a good block for
that in the looks category.
01:39 - If you scroll down, there
is this block right now
01:41 - it says go to front layer
and you can just click back.
01:45 - And then there you go.
01:46 - So, now we want to make
the background move.
01:48 - How do you move a sprite in Scratch?
01:50 - You might already know this,
01:51 - but in case you don't, let me show you.
01:53 - In Scratch, you control how far a sprite
01:55 - is from this side of the screen
to this side of the screen,
01:58 - with this number X.
02:00 - X is 240 all the way over here.
02:03 - It's zero in the middle.
02:05 - And then over here, it's negative 240.
02:07 - Let me show you with Avery,
02:09 - because there'll be a
little bit easier to see.
02:10 - So for Avery, if I set X to 240,
02:13 - she goes all the way over here.
02:15 - And if I set X to zero,
she goes to the middle
02:17 - and then this number Y, controls
how high up a sprite is.
02:22 - So, we can use these numbers, X and Y
02:24 - to move the background sprite.
02:25 - If we set X to zero and Y to zero,
02:28 - that puts it right in the middle.
02:29 - And that seems like a
pretty good place to start.
02:31 - So, let's have it go there
when we click the green flag
02:34 - and then we want it to move this way.
02:36 - So, we want to change X somehow.
02:39 - To do that, there's this
block change X by 10.
02:41 - Let's try it out.
02:42 - Okay so, that makes it move,
02:44 - which is what we want but the
backdrop is going this way
02:47 - and I would like it to go this way.
02:50 - So for that, we just need
to put in a negative number.
02:52 - Awesome, now I would like
it to keep going this way.
02:55 - So, I'll put this block
inside a forever loop.
02:57 - So, it'll keep happening over, over again.
03:00 - Okay, it moved.
03:01 - But now it's stuck on
this side of the stage.
03:03 - So, if it gets to this side of the stage,
03:05 - I want it to go all the way back
03:07 - and restart at this side of the stage.
03:09 - And now you might ask, how do you do that?
03:11 - I'll show you.
03:12 - We want it to do something
if it's over here.
03:16 - So, for that, we can
get this if then block,
03:20 - this block is good for
making a sprite do something
03:23 - if a certain thing is true
03:25 - and then you can go to
the emotion category.
03:27 - And there's actually a block
that just says X position.
03:30 - And this block just tells
you the current exposition
03:33 - of your sprite.
03:34 - You know the number that's right here.
03:36 - So, right now we can click on this block
03:37 - to see what our sprites X is.
03:40 - Right now it's negative 465,
which is just what we see here.
03:43 - And if we drag the backdrop
sprite to here, it's 20
03:48 - which is again, what's right here.
03:50 - And now we're gonna go
to the operators category
03:52 - and we can use this green less than block
03:55 - to check if the exposition
is less than a certain value,
03:59 - let's see, is the
exposition less than 100?
04:02 - Yes, it's true.
04:03 - Because X is 20 and 20 is less than 100
04:06 - but then if I drag it
over here and X is 351,
04:09 - let's see if that's less than 100.
04:11 - There we go.
04:12 - It's false, because 351
is much greater than 100.
04:15 - It's not less than 100,
04:16 - but instead of 100,
04:17 - let's put in negative 460,
04:19 - because that's what the
X of the backdrop is,
04:21 - when it's all the way over here.
04:22 - So, if it's X is less than that,
04:23 - then we know it's time for
it to go back over here.
04:26 - So, this will check
04:27 - if X is less than negative 460
04:29 - and then if it is, we
want the backdrop sprite
04:31 - to go all the way over here.
04:33 - So, I'll drag it over here
04:35 - and see what X and Y I
should make it go to,
04:38 - to start over here.
04:39 - Okay, it looks like X
is 465 and Y is zero.
04:43 - So, that'll be the
position I'll make it go to
04:45 - and let's put this
inside the forever loop.
04:48 - So, every time it changes
X by negative five
04:51 - and moves a little bit.
04:52 - It's going to check, am
I all the way over here?
04:55 - And then if it is, it
will go back to this side.
04:57 - So let's see it goes, it
goes, it goes, it goes.
05:01 - And then it comes back around.
05:02 - Nice, now you've probably noticed
05:04 - this big blank part of the screen.
05:06 - We will get to that.
05:07 - In fact, let's get to it now.
05:09 - So, the reason this is happening
05:10 - is when our backdrop
starts moving this way,
05:12 - we need something to follow it.
05:13 - So, what we can do is we can
make a copy of this background
05:17 - and make that copy,
fill in the blank spot.
05:19 - So, the way to copy a sprite
is to right click on it
05:22 - and click duplicate.
05:24 - So, now we have a copy of the background.
05:26 - Let's see what happens.
05:27 - So, nothing changed.
05:28 - And that's because this second sprite
05:30 - is right on top of this one,
just to help you see it,
05:33 - I'm gonna change the color
effect on the second sprite.
05:36 - So, they start at the exact same place.
05:38 - So, they're moving completely
in sync with each other.
05:41 - So to fix it, let's have this one,
05:43 - the duplicate not start in the middle.
05:45 - Let's have it start all
the way to this side.
05:48 - If I set X to 465, the main
one will start in the middle
05:52 - and then the duplicate
will be following it.
05:54 - And that way it fills in the blank spot.
05:56 - Basically both of these
sprites are gliding across
05:59 - and because we have two of them,
06:00 - the entire stage is covered.
06:01 - Now, there are so many things
you might want to add to this.
06:03 - Let's say you want
different scenes to appear
06:06 - as the character keeps going,
06:07 - you can duplicate one
of these backgrounds.
06:11 - You can make this be something different.
06:12 - So, maybe I'll delete the
rock and draw a simple plant.
06:16 - And then what we can do is
add a next costume block.
06:20 - Every time this background
starts over here
06:22 - and then you'll get to the
background with the plant.
06:25 - So anyway, that's just a little idea
06:27 - of how you can make
different scenes up here
06:28 - or different worlds or
different locations or anything.
06:31 - Anyway, that's what I
wanted to show you today.
06:33 - I hope this video helped you out.
06:34 - There's also a link in the description
06:36 - to this starter project that I made.
06:38 - So, if you want to,
06:38 - you could open that
project up and remix it.
06:40 - I hope you have fun making
scrolling backgrounds
06:42 - and see you next time.
06:44 - Scratch on.
06:46 - (beeping)
06:47 - (upbeat music)
