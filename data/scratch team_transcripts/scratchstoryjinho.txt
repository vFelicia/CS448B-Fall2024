00:04 - I remember reading the news...
00:07 - and thinking that I should so something about this...
00:10 - But I don't know what I
should do about it?
00:13 - And then I listened to this song "Hands."
00:16 - It featured different artists coming together and singing a song together
00:21 - and I thought why couldn't we scratchers create something together?
00:27 - I have a multi
animator project that like we scratchers
00:32 - made together after the Orlando tragedy
that happened to honor the people who
00:38 - died in the Orlando tragedy this project
is a multi animator project which means
00:44 - that each like each part was animated by
a different animator and we all stitched
00:50 - it together to create the final product
I think around 40 or 50 people were
00:57 - involved making that project. Scratch is
a really open place or you can like
01:03 - share anything you want and you can
express your feelings however you want
01:09 - and I think that's a really beautiful
part of it
01:27 - Mh hope for the project when I shared it with the community was to be able
01:32 - to reach out to some of the other people
in this generation and know that there
01:40 - are people who support them.
