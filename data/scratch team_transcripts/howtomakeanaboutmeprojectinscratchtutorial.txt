00:00 - - Hi, everyone.
00:01 - It's ZoÃ« from the Scratch
team, also known as Zinnea.
00:04 - Today, I wanted to show you
00:06 - how to make an about
me project in Scratch.
00:09 - You might have seen these
kinds of projects before
00:11 - where people will make a
project about themselves,
00:14 - random facts, things they
like, favorite foods,
00:17 - hobbies, interests, and yeah,
by the end of this video,
00:20 - I will show you how to make
your own project like this
00:23 - that's all about you
00:25 - and you can design it
to be whatever you want.
00:28 - Yeah, let's get started.
00:29 - So first, let's add one item to your game
00:32 - that describes something about you.
00:35 - So you can just click on
this button that says,
00:37 - choose a sprite and click choose.
00:40 - And you can pick absolutely any object
00:44 - or person that you want.
00:45 - You could add a type of animal you like,
00:47 - or a type of food that you like.
00:49 - Or you could add a
sprite that just connects
00:51 - to something about you.
00:53 - So if you like making people happy,
00:55 - you could add a rainbow or a heart.
00:56 - Or if you like writing,
you could add a pencil,
00:59 - or really just anything you want.
01:00 - One thing I really like is art.
01:02 - So I think I will add an
easel to my about me project.
01:07 - It's a little big.
01:08 - So I will decrease the size of the sprite
01:11 - by clicking here and typing in a new size.
01:14 - And what we'll do is we'll make
it so that in this project,
01:18 - when you click on an item, it
will say some fact about you.
01:23 - So I want to make it so that
when I click on this easel,
01:27 - it says, I like art.
01:29 - And a way you can do that is
01:31 - if you click on the looks category,
01:34 - you can drag out this block that says,
01:36 - say hello for two seconds.
01:38 - And here you can type in the fact
01:39 - that you want the object to say.
01:41 - So I will type in, I like art.
01:43 - And to test it out, you
can click on this block.
01:47 - There you go.
01:47 - The item says that thing.
01:49 - Now, how can we make it so
that the easel says this
01:53 - every time the player clicks on it?
01:55 - You can go to the events
category and drag out a,
02:00 - when this sprite clicked
block and put it on top.
02:03 - And now, whenever you click on the sprite,
02:07 - it does this code that's here.
02:08 - It says, I like art.
02:11 - So there we go.
02:12 - We have one interactive item
in our about me project.
02:15 - To add to our project,
first, let's add a backdrop.
02:19 - You can just hover over choose
a backdrop and click choose
02:23 - and pick any backdrop that you'd like
02:25 - for your about me project.
02:26 - In the patterns category,
I like the heart backdrop.
02:30 - So I think I'll use that one.
02:31 - You can also add a title to your project
02:34 - that says, about me.
02:36 - So to do that, I will draw a title sprite
02:40 - by hovering over, choose a
sprite, and clicking paint.
02:45 - And then I can click on
the text tool to type text,
02:50 - and I will type in about Zinnea.
02:55 - It's important to type your username here
02:58 - and not your actual name in real life.
03:00 - And if you want to,
03:01 - you can click here to change
the color of the text.
03:05 - I'll make mine a dark purple.
03:08 - And if you want your
text to stand out more
03:11 - against the backdrop, you can
draw a rectangle behind it.
03:15 - So since my text is dark, I'll
draw a light white rectangle.
03:20 - And the way to do that is
03:22 - you can click on the rectangle tool
03:25 - and set the color by clicking here.
03:28 - I'll drag the sliders to make it white.
03:31 - And then you can drag a rectangle out
03:36 - and it shows up in front of your text
03:38 - when you first draw it.
03:39 - So you can click the back
button to send it back a layer.
03:44 - And now the rectangle is behind the text.
03:47 - One thing that's important
is if your text is dark,
03:50 - you always want the rectangle
behind it to be really light,
03:53 - or you can have it be the opposite way.
03:54 - If your text is really light,
03:56 - then you want the rectangle
to be really dark.
03:58 - You don't want something like this,
03:59 - where one color is not that
much lighter than the other,
04:02 - because for people with
visual disabilities,
04:05 - it can be really hard to read.
04:06 - So a way to make your project
really easy for people to use
04:09 - is to have either really light
text on a dark background
04:12 - or really dark text on a light background.
04:15 - And this is actually a
really great thing to do
04:17 - any place that you have
text in a Scratch project.
04:20 - Now, let's add another
sprite to your project,
04:23 - but with this sprite,
04:24 - let me show you how to do an animation.
04:26 - So I'll hover over, choose
a sprite, and click choose,
04:30 - and you can pick some other sprite
04:32 - that connects to something about you.
04:34 - So I like hedgehogs.
04:36 - So I will pick the hedgehog sprite.
04:39 - And just like with the easel,
04:40 - I'm going to make it say something.
04:43 - I'll make it say, I want a
pet hedgehog, which I do,
04:47 - and I will make it do that
when the sprite is clicked.
04:51 - One thing is when you're
writing these random facts
04:53 - about yourself, make sure not to include
04:56 - any personal information,
04:57 - like about where you live or your name,
04:59 - but it's totally okay to
have your hobbies and likes
05:02 - and dislikes and favorite
food and stuff like that.
05:05 - Now, let's make it do an animation.
05:07 - So in the looks category,
there's this block, next costume.
05:12 - And if you click on it,
it will make a sprite
05:15 - change its pose to the next pose it has.
05:18 - Most sprites in Scratch
come with multiple poses
05:21 - that are called costumes.
05:23 - So the next costume block
will make it animate.
05:28 - And if we put a, when this
sprite clicked block on top,
05:32 - now, when it's clicked, it
will do both of these things.
05:37 - It will say, I want a pet hedgehog,
05:39 - and it will also go to the next costume.
05:42 - And so, you can see all of its cute poses.
05:45 - That's one nice thing about Scratch.
05:47 - If you have one, when
this sprite clicked block,
05:49 - the sprite will do that
thing when it's clicked.
05:51 - And if you have two separate,
05:53 - when this sprite clicked blocks,
05:55 - the sprite will do both of
the things when it's clicked,
05:58 - and the same goes for
any of the other blocks
06:00 - in the events category,
06:02 - like it would work if you had multiple,
06:03 - when green flag clicked blocks.
06:05 - Now, here's what you could do
if you want to add something
06:08 - that we don't have a sprite for.
06:10 - Mangoes are one of my favorite foods.
06:12 - And let's say I wanted
to add a mango sprite.
06:14 - We don't actually have one in Scratch.
06:17 - So you can hover over the,
06:19 - choose a sprite button, and click upload.
06:22 - And then if you have a
picture of that thing
06:24 - on your computer, then you can upload it.
06:26 - So I could click upload
06:28 - and I could upload this
picture of mangoes,
06:30 - and I will make this sprite
06:33 - also say something when I click on it.
06:36 - Now, let's say you want to have a sprite
06:38 - that plays a sound when you click on it.
06:40 - Let me show you how to do that.
06:42 - So I'll hover over, choose a sprite,
06:44 - and pick another sprite.
06:46 - Another thing I really
like is playing soccer.
06:49 - I grew up calling it soccer,
06:50 - but I know most people call it football.
06:52 - So anyway, I will add the soccer
ball and I'll make it say,
06:58 - I like playing soccer, when it's clicked.
07:01 - And here's how you can
make it play a sound.
07:04 - In the sound category,
07:06 - you can drag out this block, start sound,
07:10 - and let's put a, when
this sprite clicked block
07:13 - on top of that.
07:14 - So now, when I click on the sprite,
07:16 - it plays the sound
(ball bouncing)
07:17 - that it comes with, which is
a basketball bounce sound.
07:20 - It's close enough, I guess.
07:23 - Yeah, most of the sprites in Scratch
07:24 - come with a sound attached,
07:26 - but if you wanted to pick your own sound,
07:28 - you could always go to the sounds tab
07:32 - and click here to choose a sound,
07:35 - and you can pick whatever you want.
07:37 - So if you wanted to add the collect sound,
07:40 - you could pick it
(bell beeping)
07:41 - and then click back on the code tab
07:44 - and just choose it in the menu here.
07:48 - And you know what?
(bell beeping)
07:49 - I will also make the sprite
turn when I click it.
07:52 - So I'll go to the motion
category and drag out a
07:56 - turn 15 degrees block,
(bell beeping)
07:58 - and I'll attach it with this block here.
08:01 - And yeah, with this,
you can pretty much make
08:04 - whatever kind of about me
project you want to make
08:07 - with whatever random facts about you.
08:09 - And the starter code that
I made in this project
08:12 - will be in the description below.
08:14 - So you can always open up
that project and remix it.
08:17 - And yeah, I can't wait to
see your about me projects.
08:21 - I'll see you next time.
08:22 - And Scratch on.
08:26 - (whistle squeaking)
(cheerful music)
