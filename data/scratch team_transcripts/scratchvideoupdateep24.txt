00:12 - this month's episode is scratch day
00:14 - scratch day
00:16 - what is scratch the area that's that's a
00:18 - good question so I would describe
00:20 - scratch day as a global celebration of
00:23 - scratch and the people who scratch and
00:25 - the way it's celebrated is there's
00:27 - events that happen all over the world I
00:29 - think there's about a thousand events
00:30 - that happened and that will continue
00:32 - actually to happen where people just
00:34 - come together and they scratch and it's
00:36 - a great time and it also happens
00:37 - somewhat in the online community people
00:38 - celebrate scratch day and that's
00:40 - actually what we're gonna highlight so
00:42 - the Lovat section is scratch state
00:45 - projects that we loved in the community
00:47 - the online community there's a really
00:49 - awesome platformer called I think it's
00:51 - trash day platformer by ferial two to
00:55 - eight and you essentially it's a
00:57 - platformer game where you try to go to
00:59 - your scratch day event there's a bunch
01:01 - of obstacles I won't ruin the ending but
01:03 - it is worth the I think twenty different
01:05 - levels that you have to go through I'm
01:07 - pretty bad at platformer games so maybe
01:09 - just try it out try that what about you
01:11 - what is a project called scratch day

01:27 - celebrates scratch day where each it's
01:29 - collaborative so each person takes a
01:32 - balloon and passes it on exactly check

02:12 - get a scratch project as a card it means
02:15 - a lot and so thank you everyone for

02:21 - nice tutorial activity on making your
02:24 - own cards it's available it's scratched
02:27 - on mit.edu flashcards and it sort of
02:30 - steps through how did you might make a
02:31 - card and I would totally encourage you
02:33 - if you have upcoming birthdays or just
02:34 - celebrations graduations to make a
02:36 - scratch card and and send it to someone
02:38 - it's special people love it I'm not
