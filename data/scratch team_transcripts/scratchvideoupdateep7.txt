00:10 - eventful weekend it was two events yes
00:13 - scratch day and mother's day and sorry

00:26 - scratched a themed projects and one of
00:29 - them that first stood up to me was crazy
00:31 - nemesis project it was a scratch day

00:37 - shirts have like really cool facts about
00:39 - scratch like when it was launched and
00:41 - some other things about the community so
00:42 - I really like that and also the
00:45 - underscore grits created this sort of
00:47 - like community remix in project where
00:50 - you have a little character this little
00:52 - 8-bit character and then you use the
00:54 - paint editor to put a costume on it and
00:56 - the idea is he's going to put in all the
01:00 - characters into one big project so it's
01:02 - gonna be a massive scratch day
