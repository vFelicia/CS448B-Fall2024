00:00 - hi everyone Welcome to our fifth scratch
00:03 - video update I'm Rick Rose also known as
00:05 - Rick Rose on Scratch and I'm Eric also
00:07 - known as speak visually on scratch
00:09 - welcome we're joining you from a very
00:10 - sunny and warm Boston much different
00:14 - than episode three um so we're glad to
00:16 - have you here um we're going to jump
00:17 - into our first segment which is love it
00:20 - which is projects that we found in the
00:22 - community that we really well love uh
00:24 - and so one project that I loved you know
00:26 - I'm a sucker for those dress up games
00:28 - and there was one called 18th century
00:31 - dress up and what I thought was cool was
00:33 - it used sort of these clothing clothing
00:36 - items from like 300 years ago and a lot
00:39 - of them I actually weren't Familiar of
00:41 - what they were and so when you click it
00:43 - and you sort of drag it onto your person
00:45 - it explains what it is and where it goes
00:47 - which is pretty cool so I was like
00:49 - trying to piece it together I'm like
00:50 - which goes on where and so anyways I
00:52 - really really enjoyed that game cool so
00:55 - a project that I love is a project by
00:57 - scratcher mini Dash macaroon and it's
01:00 - how to make a pancake so I really love
01:02 - waffles and I can have it any time of
01:04 - the day but Minnie macaroon wanted to
01:07 - highlight the counterpart of waffles
01:10 - pancakes and so in this project you put
01:13 - different ingredients into a bowl milk
01:15 - baking soda eggs and you whisk it
01:18 - together and then towards the end of the
01:20 - project you throw it in a pan hence the
01:22 - name pancake and you um wait till it
01:25 - kind of gets golden brown and then it's
01:27 - ready to eat and you can put berries in
01:29 - it it's really delicious it sounds very
01:31 - delicious I can go for one of those
01:33 - right now get pancakes um and as I
01:35 - didn't mention the dress up game was by
01:36 - creative Rarity yes was the person who
01:38 - made the dress up game um and so we have
01:41 - our next segment which
01:44 - is things to things to try Triple T um
01:48 - and we have um a really cool thing to
01:51 - try and it's related to something that
01:52 - I've been thinking about um which is
01:54 - sort of scratch around the world so I
01:56 - was thinking about scratch Day stuff and
01:57 - I'm like wow scratch really is something
01:59 - that happens around the world world and
02:00 - so we just launched a new scratch design
02:02 - studio called scratch around the world
02:05 - um and so have to think about that for a
02:07 - moment and so if you if you check it out
02:09 - it's on the homepage you can see there's
02:11 - already like over a 100 maybe 200
02:13 - projects in there and the projects
02:14 - revolve around um sort of where you live
02:18 - so uh and your culture so maybe it's
02:20 - what you eat maybe you have a special
02:22 - way of making pancakes um what kind of
02:24 - music you listen to what celebrations
02:26 - you have and so it's like super super
02:29 - fascinating to see all the different
02:31 - representation around scratch so another
02:34 - thing to try it's another Studio on the
02:37 - homepage called uh super pie day and uh
02:41 - I know it might be confusing but it's
02:42 - not pie you don't eat this pie although
02:45 - pie sounds good right now it does
02:46 - pancakes and Pie is the theme of this
02:48 - video update but pie is the number 314
02:54 - and5 well the reason why I remembered
02:57 - five is that this P day is Super P day
02:59 - because of
03:01 - 31415 and there is this featured Studio
03:04 - where people are already contributing
03:06 - different projects about the number Pi
03:09 - one suggestion I have is maybe making a
03:12 - pi maker so actually with pi but you can
03:15 - eat oh a p pie a p pie I like saying
03:19 - that pie
03:20 - pie anyways um cool so definitely check
03:23 - out that studio it's on the homepage um
03:25 - and so that we have a very very special
03:27 - although all the messages from the team
03:30 - are special I really especially like
03:31 - this one um a drum roll we have to do a
03:34 - drum roll sorry we have to do a drum
03:35 - roll and it's really sunny so let's
03:37 - bring that keeps coming into the camera
03:39 - it's a good thing it's melting the snow
03:41 - um and so we have a very special uh
03:42 - video update from Mitch and Natalie on
03:45 - the scratch team you may you might uh
03:47 - remember I think two episodes ago Mitch
03:50 - and the tour of his office showed us a
03:52 - book and that book had um the early
03:55 - screenshots of scratch uh and so Mitch
03:57 - and Natalie have been around for you
03:59 - know as long as scratch has been around
04:00 - and they're going to show us give us a
04:02 - peek into what scratch look like when
04:04 - they're first developing it all right
04:05 - let's take a look hi I'm Mitch also
04:08 - known as EMZ on Scratch and I'm Natalie
04:10 - also known as Natalie on Scratch and
04:13 - actually we've been working on scratch
04:14 - for a long time now I think we started
04:16 - in 2002 probably before a lot of you
04:19 - were even born uh so scratch has come a
04:21 - long way from where we first started u
04:23 - it's great we have this book that one of
04:24 - the scratch team members Tommy you know
04:27 - created so it's great to take a look at
04:28 - some how far scratch has come so here's
04:31 - what scratch looked like all the way
04:33 - back in
04:34 - 2004 it's pretty different we had the
04:37 - top down view of a cat I can see that
04:41 - the blocks didn't even have little no
04:42 - notches on them yet and there weren't
04:44 - any categories yet or you had to use a
04:46 - little pull down menu for categories and
04:49 - I think one of the things we were we
04:51 - would think we started thinking about is
04:52 - what should be the main character Bay I
04:54 - remember we had an illustrator come up
04:56 - with some possibilities for us here are
04:59 - some of the first sketches of what might
05:00 - be the main character yeah so Wing made
05:03 - these and we had talked about a cat
05:05 - although it wasn't quite what we thought
05:07 - but you'll see the Gobo which we had
05:09 - first called just the blob um before I
05:12 - came up with the name Gobo looks a lot
05:15 - like Gobo does now except for those ones
05:17 - with the little the longer legs but we
05:19 - like these ones and for a while I
05:20 - thought that we should make this the
05:22 - main character but then we talked about
05:23 - more and we thought it' be better to
05:24 - have it should be recognizable animal
05:27 - like a cat so we asked to illustrate our
05:28 - wing to come with some more we didn't
05:30 - really like these so much so we asked
05:32 - for him to come up with some other ones
05:33 - here some of his sketches of the scratch
05:36 - cat and you can see some would look like
05:39 - today's cat but there some other ones
05:41 - that one's a little crazy yeah this was
05:43 - already a six iteration so it took a lot
05:45 - of different tries to get to one that we
05:48 - thought would really work for the
05:49 - scratch kit and then we just worked on
05:51 - how to color it in and there was still a
05:53 - long way to go and Shifting the eyes uh
05:56 - then uh we also continue to think a lot
05:59 - about the interface you know here if we
06:00 - go through the years uh you can see
06:04 - here's one before we had the idea of
06:05 - broadcast to send messages from one to
06:08 - another one idea was to have colored
06:10 - Flags like a you would wave a different
06:13 - color flag to send a message or then we
06:15 - also tried different color envelopes
06:17 - which actually you can see now on
06:18 - scretch Jr but then it was hard to
06:20 - remember what those were about then I
06:22 - remember before broadcast you really
06:24 - wanted shout yeah was I thought would be
06:26 - nice to you once once once Sprite would
06:28 - shout a message to another one yeah but
06:30 - then I thought that was actually sounded
06:32 - too fun cuz it sounded like well you'd
06:33 - really expect your Sprite to shout and
06:35 - you'd expect to hear it but in fact you
06:37 - wouldn't hear anything so we s it on
06:39 - broadcast you see other things too like
06:40 - it wasn't moved then it was forward at
06:42 - first so a lot of the names changed over
06:44 - time uh and again it continued to evolve
06:49 - uh I hated when the interface looked
06:50 - like this I just didn't think it looked
06:52 - very good uh but then now it started to
06:55 - look a little bit more like it showed up
06:57 - as like it came out as and continue to
07:00 - evolve through still the top down cat
07:03 - here but we started have when green flag
07:05 - clicked came the flag just for that and
07:09 - then
07:10 - finally we came out and the cat made its
07:13 - appearance and this is right around the
07:15 - time we were ready to come out and show
07:18 - scratch to the rest of the world so
07:20 - welcome back I hope you enjoyed that yes
07:22 - scratch has changed a lot over the years
07:24 - I really especially love the scratch cat
07:27 - and the goo how that changed amazing
07:30 - super amazing so we'll see you again
