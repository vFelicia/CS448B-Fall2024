00:10 - Did you know that 
you can use Scratch
00:11 - to create virtual costumes,
like a hat and glasses?
00:15 - Or that you can experiment with
games and interactive projects
00:18 - that use the features 
of your face?
00:20 - You can try it on Scratch Lab,
00:22 - where we create new, 
experimental coding blocks
00:25 - and ask for your feedback.
00:26 - Face Sensing is one of our
Scratch Lab experiments.
00:29 - It uses AI to detect 
parts of your face.
00:32 - [Hello]
00:34 - Let's try it out!
00:35 - I've got Eric, the Director 
of Scratch Lab, here
00:37 - to help us experiment.
00:39 - [Magical Spell Sound]
00:41 - Thanks, Maren!
00:42 - To try out the Face
Sensing blocks,
00:44 - navigate to our 
Scratch Lab site 
00:46 - and click the 
“Try it out” button
00:48 - at the top of the page.
00:49 - This loads up the Face
Sensing blocks.
00:52 - You may need to 
allow camera permissions 
00:54 - to get your video 
to appear on the stage.
00:57 - But then, you can use this 
“go to nose” block.
01:01 - If you click on it,
the cat will jump to your nose.
01:04 - Here, I'll click again
01:06 - and again.
01:07 - If I want the cat 
to stick to my face,
01:09 - I can use a 
“forever” block.
01:12 - And now, when I 
click on it that,
01:14 - the cat follows me around.
01:16 - I can also 
stick it to my ear
01:20 - or even make it
01:23 - spin while it's there.
01:25 - Let's try 
another experiment
01:27 - and make a hat 
(or another object) 
01:29 - stick to our head, 
like a face filter.
01:31 - You can choose a sprite
that is a fashion item
01:33 - (like a hat or glasses)
01:35 - from the sprites available 
in the sprite library.
01:38 - Or, in the costume Paint Editor,
try drawing a funny hat
01:41 - using the brush 
or shape tools.
01:51 - Using what you learned
in our first experiment,
01:53 - can you write a script
to make the sprite
01:55 - stick to the 
top of your head?
01:57 - Here, I've altered a script
that Eric showed us
01:59 - to make this hat continually
go to the top of my head.
02:03 - Notice that this hat 
doesn't quite fit 
02:05 - on my head
the way that I expected.
02:06 - It's really low 
on my face.
02:08 - I can actually change
the position of this hat
02:10 - by going back to my costume,
selecting the entire costume,
02:14 - and then moving it around
02:16 - until it's just in the right
place on the top of my head.
02:21 - I also noticed that 
this hat may be 
02:22 - too big or too small 
for my head.
02:25 - I could resize it
using the tools.
02:27 - Or, I could actually use
a bit of code.
02:30 - How does your 
costume respond
02:32 - if you're close to the camera
versus further away?
02:34 - When you tilt your head,
does it follow the tilt?
02:37 - Or does it just sort of sit
awkwardly atop your forehead?
02:41 - We can actually use
some code blocks to change this.
02:43 - Do you see some blocks
that we could use?
02:45 - For instance, I can add this
“set size to face size” block.
02:49 - When I get close to the camera
or further away,
02:51 - the hat changes size
02:53 - based on the size of my 
face in the webcam.
02:56 - I can also add this block “point
in direction of face tilt.”
03:00 - Now, when I turn my head,
03:01 - my hat goes with me,
just like a normal hat would.
03:04 - What else could you try?
03:05 - Navigate to the Face
Sensing homepage
03:08 - and check out
our other starter projects.
03:11 - At Scratch, we're focused
on making tools to help learners
03:14 - express their own 
creative ideas.
03:16 - That's why we're 
experimenting with AI, 
03:19 - to let you explore new
possibilities like face sensing.
03:22 - It is important to note
that our Face Sensing blocks
03:24 - try to detect if a face exists,
but they're not able
03:27 - to identify who the face is,
or even if it is a human face.
03:31 - That means the AI
we use for Face Sensing 
03:33 - sometimes makes 
interesting mistakes.
03:35 - Identifying these mistakes 
can help us
03:37 - see the difference
between our own 
03:39 - human intelligence 
and AI.
03:42 - So, for example, the
AI can detect the face of
03:45 - a toy like this, if I hold it up
close to the camera.
03:49 - But what about 
this whale?
03:51 - It definitely has a face,
but it's not that humanlike.
03:54 - So you can see the AI makes the
costume jump around a lot.
03:58 - Now, what about 
a drawing of a face?
04:02 - It'll detect even a very simple
drawing like this smiley face,
04:05 - especially if we get it
close up.
04:08 - One thing I've learned
04:10 - is that the drawing
actually can be
04:13 - just a circle 
that's filled in.
04:16 - But what I have to do
is fill the screen
04:20 - with the white paper,
04:22 - and then, it actually thinks
that's a face.
04:26 - That's a way the AI sees
04:28 - a little differently
from a person.
04:29 - What if my face is
partly covered up?
04:32 - Well, if it's covered 
all the way,
04:34 - it can't see me.
04:35 - But even if it can just see
the top of my head and my eyes,
04:39 - it works really well.
04:41 - That's kind of surprising.
04:42 - The AI we're using for Face
Sensing was created
04:45 - by training it on millions
of photos of people's faces.
04:50 - It detects faces 
based on the patterns
04:51 - it has seen in those photos,
04:53 - like the arrangement
of the eyes,
04:54 - nose, and mouth
relative to each other.
04:56 - That's also why it sometimes
makes mistakes.
05:00 - Thanks, Eric!
05:01 - I can't wait to experiment
with objects around my house
05:03 - to see what the AI recognizes
as a face, and then create games
05:07 - and other interactive
projects with these blocks.
