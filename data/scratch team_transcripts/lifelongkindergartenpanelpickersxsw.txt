00:04 - hi I'm Mitch Resnick professor of
00:07 - learning research here at the MIT Media
00:09 - Lab think of a traditional kindergarten
00:13 - kids are playfully creating things in
00:15 - collaboration with one another you know
00:17 - making castles out of wooden blocks or
00:19 - pictures with finger pain they're
00:21 - learning about the creative process and
00:23 - developing as creative thinkers now
00:25 - unfortunately if you walk into most
00:27 - elementary schools or middle schools or
00:29 - high schools you see something very
00:31 - different often kids are sitting in
00:33 - desks listening to lectures filling out
00:36 - worksheets the focus is on delivering
00:39 - information or delivering instruction
00:42 - this approach is even seeping down into
00:45 - kindergarten where kids are looking at
00:48 - phonics flashcards or filling out math
00:49 - worksheets in short
00:51 - kindergarten is becoming more like the
00:53 - rest of school in my research group here
00:56 - at the Media Lab we're trying to do
00:58 - exactly the opposite
00:59 - we want to make the rest of school in
01:01 - fact the rest of life more like
01:03 - kindergarten so we call our group the
01:06 - lifelong kindergarten group
