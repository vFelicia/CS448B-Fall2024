00:05 - rick ross on scratch and i am eric also
00:07 - known as speak visually on scratch
00:08 - anything this is episode unless episode
00:11 - 11 double digit su sauce we were in
00:14 - Amsterdam covering scratch conference
00:16 - and now we're back in Boston outside the
00:18 - immediate lab yeah so let's jump in to
00:21 - love it I love it there so the lovett
00:26 - section is projects that Rick arose and
00:27 - i have found in the community that we
00:29 - love and so there was one i came across
00:31 - that was by the user sensitive and was
00:35 - called sneak peek and it was a sneak
00:37 - peek of a game they were working on and
00:39 - you get to just play through sort of the
00:41 - first level and get to test out the
00:43 - controls and I thought it was nice
00:44 - because I think a lot of times myself
00:46 - included we can be a bit afraid to share
00:48 - project because we want to make sure
00:51 - it's perfect but I think it's cool and
00:53 - it's really beneficial to share before
00:55 - it's done because you can get feedback
00:56 - and so that was really cool to see ya
00:57 - and I also liked seeing people's process
00:59 - exactly yeah so another thing that we
01:03 - loved is in the summer mean by firewall
01:07 - 400 its started it started as one
01:10 - project and it's a simple project where
01:13 - like the music starts playing and
01:15 - there's this adorable cat and then all
01:17 - of a sudden the music starts dancing it
01:19 - starts dancing
01:26 - and the title also has remixed it and so
01:31 - people have been remixed again it's been
01:33 - over a hundred and fifty projects yeah
01:36 - it's pretty awesome you're having a bad
01:37 - day you can just go through the remixes
01:39 - and they make you smile yes and and
01:41 - beyond Katz is also a raccoon that dance
01:44 - yes there's other ones taking there's an
01:46 - alien that's called all adore walhalla
01:50 - equally adorable you should try three
01:52 - mixing it too yes which brings us to our
01:53 - next section things to try it's always
01:56 - we have to like things to try cool so I
02:00 - always talk about the scratch design
02:02 - studios you know this but there is a new
02:04 - scratch design studio the scratches
02:07 - entity a scratch island and so that's
02:09 - essentially some explorers found in
02:11 - island that is shaped like scratch cat
02:14 - although it doesn't need to be shaped
02:15 - like scratch cat but anyways the idea is
02:17 - you get to explore the island and see
02:19 - what you find so who lives there what
02:21 - language do they speak was the flag look
02:22 - like what does the island look like and
02:25 - so there's been some pretty awesome
02:26 - scratch islands that have been created
02:27 - so I would encourage you all to check it

03:31 - especially drumroll please what is our
03:34 - message from the scratch yes so you
03:36 - might have noticed earlier this month
03:38 - that the site was up and down and you
03:41 - might have seen like a pico a character
03:44 - with other servers and technical schools
03:46 - and what that meant was the servers were
03:49 - down because we did some upgrades and
03:51 - then go exactly according to plan and so
03:54 - the site for a couple days there was
03:56 - pretty shaky and without some project
04:00 - went viral which is just checking as we
04:02 - have a project link there there's the
04:03 - there's a spacelander project that was
04:06 - shared on a lot of different new sites
04:08 - around the internet and so that sort of
04:10 - made the server go even slower it's like
04:12 - a perfect storm but there's nothing
04:14 - wrong with projects going viral we love
04:16 - that and so we have to make sure our
04:18 - servers can handle it yeah and our
04:20 - developers have been working really hard
04:21 - to make the site more robust and be able
04:24 - to respond to like new changes and also
04:26 - things that just happen in the world
04:27 - would scratch and you want to thank you
04:30 - for your patient thank you so much for
04:31 - your patience we apologize for that so
04:33 - what do you do when the site goes down
04:35 - or you're experiencing issues is a good
04:37 - thing to talk about so one thing you can
04:39 - do is to go to the bugs and glitches
04:41 - forum it's the bugs and glitches forum
04:43 - is if you're as if you're on the website
