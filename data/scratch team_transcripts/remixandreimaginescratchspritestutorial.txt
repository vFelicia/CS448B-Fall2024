00:09 - Let's explore remixing and 
re-imagining characters
00:12 - to create fun new sprites.
00:14 - There are two modes
for drawing in Scratch.
00:16 - Bitmap mode allows you to edit
photos and paint with pixels.
00:20 - Vector mode allows you to create
and edit shapes.
00:23 - The sprite library 
contains a mix 
00:25 - of bitmap and vector sprites.
00:27 - You can remix and re-imagine
either type of sprite,
00:29 - but for this exercise,
00:30 - we're going to focus on
vector sprites.
00:33 - I am going to select
00:34 - the pieces of the Giga costume
that I don't want
00:36 - and delete them.
00:37 - Now, I'm going to go to 
the Choose a Costume library 
00:40 - and I'm going to 
look for the octopus.
00:44 - I only want the octopus legs,
00:46 - so I'm going to use my Select 
tool to select all the legs,
00:49 - copy them, 
00:50 - go back to Giga, paste them,
and then I can change the order.
00:55 - I'm going to send these
to the very back.
00:56 - So that Giga’s head is on top.
00:59 - That looks really cute,
but maybe I want to make sure
01:02 - that Giga’s hair matches 
the octopus legs.
01:07 - If I select Giga’s head,
I notice that the fill shows
01:10 - multiple colors.
01:11 - That's because Giga’s
head is a group.
01:14 - There's things with different
colors inside of it.
01:16 - If I only want to select
the red hair,
01:18 - I can use my Reshape tool
to just select the piece
01:21 - that is red 
and change the color.
01:24 - I can try to find the color
by hand,
01:27 - or I can use my Eyedropper tool
01:29 - to select the orange
that I want.
01:31 - I notice that
Giga has an outline in black.
01:33 - So I might select all of my legs
and adjust the outline.
01:38 - Nice.
01:39 - Now, I've got a very cool,
very different Giga
01:42 - that I created using pieces
01:43 - of the Scratch sprites
that were already there.
01:46 - If I want to further manipulate,
I can always
01:48 - use the Reshape tool
and do things like
01:50 - change the size of the mouth,
01:53 - change the curve of the hair, 
01:54 - change colors, change outlines.
01:57 - I can do a whole host of things
using these vector tools
02:00 - and just the sprites
that I already have
02:02 - in the sprite library.
02:04 - [Mystery Music]
02:07 - The possibilities are endless.
What will you create?
