00:02 - along and a huge thank you to everyone
00:05 - for dealing with all these technical
00:08 - difficulties we're running into but
00:10 - we're all here now and let me just go
00:13 - over the beginning of the stream really
00:15 - quickly uh so uh this is the scratch
00:19 - create along in which you can make
00:22 - projects in a one-hour live stream but
00:24 - with me Zoe
00:25 - also known as zinnia on scratch um and
00:28 - uh the plan for today I hope this isn't
00:33 - too much going over the same material
00:35 - but I just want to go over it uh for
00:37 - people who are just joining now um so
00:40 - here's the plan for today um which is
00:44 - that we all gather what I forgot to
00:46 - leave out of this plan what I forgot to
00:48 - put into this plan was spend many
00:49 - minutes dealing with technical
00:50 - difficulties um but you never plan that
00:54 - just happens um so we gather right now
00:58 - and then you will take a look at the
01:03 - projects that were shared two weeks ago
01:05 - and the projects that were shared of one
01:07 - week ago um usually we just look at last
01:09 - week's but uh due to other technical
01:12 - difficulties we're gonna look at the
01:13 - past two weeks
01:14 - this week and then we will I will share
01:21 - the prompt for this week's activity and
01:23 - then we'll all get to make projects
01:26 - using that prompt and I also think we'll
01:28 - go over a little bit today because we
01:30 - started late so thank you so much to
01:32 - everyone for your extreme patience in
01:34 - all of this but we're back on um oh and

02:20 - people just took in so many directions I
02:24 - like you might have heard me I'm not

03:19 - weeks ago
03:19 - I love the studio and then last week uh
03:23 - he prompt was create a story and use
03:27 - projects for some wonderful as well like
03:29 - the just like seeing people's original
03:31 - artwork
03:32 - it seemed that like different types of
03:35 - ways of making a story interactive like
03:38 - a lot of these have different ways that
03:39 - you could like press a button to make
03:42 - something happen or to make a character
03:43 - say something but they're all different
03:44 - which is so cool uh so I love and they
03:48 - like oh cool animation and this one and
03:50 - this one like walking and fish
03:52 - animations so I love seeing these
03:55 - projects as well thank you to everyone
03:57 - who joined it a week ago also and now I
04:01 - think it's time to talk about this
04:05 - week's prompt let me switch it to being
04:08 - at my face up are you ready to hear this
04:11 - week's from I know technically it is in
04:12 - the title of a video but I'm just still
04:15 - gonna say so this week's prompt is make
04:20 - a virtual pet so I you can take that and
04:26 - anyway you want make a pet in scratch
04:29 - scratch has lots of characters in it
04:31 - that you can use to to they have one of
04:35 - those being your pet um that's a great
04:38 - place to start but you could also take a
04:41 - picture of your actual pet you have and
04:43 - make a project about that and I'll show
04:45 - you how to do all these things you could
04:48 - do a project of you know drawing your
04:51 - own pet someone actually asked a
04:53 - question if they could do that
04:54 - you told me we can um I'll show you how
04:56 - to do that as well
04:58 - you can make a completely fictional pet
05:01 - really just anything you want to do uh
05:04 - that sound good
05:06 - I hope so uh so I think let's get
05:10 - started um and if you're new to scratch
05:13 - or if it's been a while uh let me show
05:16 - you how you can get started with scratch
05:18 - so to do that
05:20 - where's that link yes uh you're going to
05:24 - want to go to a new tab scratch.mit.edu
05:33 - so yeah just go to scratch.mit.edu and
05:37 - I'll keep this link up for a little
05:38 - while in case anyone's going now welcome
05:41 - people joining now if you're joining now
05:42 - and again just a big THANK YOU to
05:44 - everybody for uh dealing with all of the
05:48 - audio troubles we had thank they're
05:50 - fixed now appreciate you all sticking
05:53 - with us um and I am so excited to make
05:56 - pets with all of you uh so let's go to
06:01 - so scratch.mit.edu and then you can
06:04 - click on create' and uh so it's to
06:09 - clicking on create well make a project
06:12 - and let me first just show you like the
06:16 - sort of basics of scratch which i will
06:19 - do if this page modes ever it'll load
06:24 - I'm sure it will and keep sending in
06:31 - your questions in this questions link uh
06:34 - all and I'll answer them um so let's
06:37 - close this
06:38 - tutorial that pops up so if it's your
06:43 - first time seeing it this is scratch
06:46 - this is a page where you can make a
06:50 - scratch project and in scratch you have
06:53 - these characters down here who are can
06:58 - be all the characters in your project
06:59 - and then over here you have these blocks
07:02 - that all sort of say something that a
07:06 - character could do so this one says move
07:09 - ten steps and in scratch if you click on
07:11 - a block it will actually make the
07:13 - character do that thing so if we click
07:15 - on this then the cat moves ten steps so
07:20 - you know and and you can kind of guess
07:23 - what it might do if you drag out one of
07:25 - these says turn 15 degrees it's probably
07:29 - make the cat spin in some way but let's
07:30 - let's see yeah so if we click on that it
07:34 - makes the cat turn um and you know this
07:37 - one go to random position I guess that's
07:40 - probably will make the cat you know let
07:43 - me zoom out a tiny bit attached to that
07:46 - one but you could also just have it be
07:47 - on its own but when I click that make
07:49 - the cat go to a random position and
07:51 - basically in scratch you can combine
07:54 - these in whatever way you want so if I
07:57 - want it cat to go to a random position
08:00 - and then turn 15 degrees you can click
08:04 - on that and it goes to a random position
08:05 - and then it turns and so that's like the
08:10 - basic idea of scratch and the these are
08:12 - all sorts of blocks that have to do with
08:15 - moving a character but there's also
08:18 - different things you can do to a
08:19 - character so there's like we could
08:21 - change how it looks like you could have
08:22 - it say something so you can have oh you
08:28 - know what maybe this code is a little
08:30 - bit under my video there you go um and I
08:33 - hope you all got the link to go to
08:36 - scratch.mit.edu slash create to start
08:39 - making the project like this maybe I'll
08:41 - take the link off now but there we go
08:45 - but if you're joining later in the
08:47 - stream you can send in a question and if
08:49 - you want me to say what that link is
08:51 - it's just scratch.mit.edu slash create
08:54 - uh so um anyway so you could click on
08:58 - this one
08:58 - and then it makes the cat say hello in a
09:01 - speech bubble um but you can have it say
09:02 - whatever you want
09:03 - you'd say hi friends I've misspelled
09:07 - friends didn't die hi friends
09:11 - so yeah the there's all kinds of blocks
09:15 - and you can sort of play around with
09:17 - different ones so that is the idea of
09:21 - scratch but if you still like more of an
09:23 - explanation send that into the comments
09:26 - and I'll uh I'll answer it so that's the
09:30 - basic idea of scratch but how can you
09:33 - get started making a virtual pet project
09:37 - well let me show you um maybe I will I
09:43 - will maybe get rid of the cat you could
09:46 - have the cat be your pet but maybe we
09:50 - can we can click the Delete icon to get
09:52 - rid of a cat and I would say a good
09:56 - first step in making a pet project is
09:59 - you can choose a pet and I say choose
10:02 - because in scratch we have a lot of
10:05 - pre-made characters and so if you hover
10:08 - over this button here this little tap it
10:12 - says choose a sprite and then you can go
10:14 - up to this icon and click Choose and it
10:19 - takes you to the sprite library which
10:22 - has tons and tons of pre-made characters
10:26 - and many and many of these any of these
10:30 - could make a great pet so you can scroll
10:33 - around
10:34 - oh I sell some questions coming in
10:37 - someone asks can I make more than one
10:39 - pets totally you totally can
10:42 - thanks that the question and I think
10:43 - someone else asked uh uh can you make an
10:47 - object be a pet you can totally do that
10:50 - too so I mean there's if you click on
10:52 - the animals category there are tons of
10:55 - animals you could choose from that could
10:56 - all make wonderful pets but you can also
10:59 - click type in thing
11:03 - in this search bar and which is a way of
11:05 - getting all of these objects we have and
11:08 - there could be lots of great pet options
11:12 - here too personally I think the rocks
11:14 - would make a fantastic pet also I
11:17 - thought the jar would be nice yeah so
11:20 - anyway you can totally make objects your
11:23 - pet but for now maybe I'll look at
11:27 - animals because this could be you know
11:30 - you can look at all of the animals we
11:32 - have here and pick one of these to be
11:34 - your pet so maybe I have always wanted a
11:37 - pet dragon
11:38 - uh so I'm going to pick the dragon to be
11:41 - my pet so that that could be a nice
11:46 - first step is just click on this button
11:48 - here choose a sprite and then and then
11:52 - pick out some creature to be your pet
11:55 - from seed so I hope you've all got to
11:59 - get to that point um you would also of
12:03 - course be independently doing your
12:04 - project while I'm talking about all this
12:06 - you know you but but if you'd like to
12:08 - hear some steps you could follow along
12:10 - so you can pick a creature be your pet
12:13 - and then you can let's see what what
12:19 - should we have our pic do to start out
12:21 - with uh it seems sort of nice to have
12:25 - our pet say something it's sort of
12:27 - introduce itself whoa I assumed in a lot
12:29 - blocks not very big oh maybe make them a
12:31 - little bit smaller
12:32 - yeah so drag that out and click on it
12:37 - and now you know the dragons saying
12:39 - hello my lovely little pet dragon here
12:41 - um so anyway that's that's nice
12:48 - say my name is what did the name of this
12:54 - dragon be let's see someone someone
12:59 - asked can you make a robotic head he
13:01 - totally can and maybe I'll make this
13:03 - dragons name a robot in honor of that
13:05 - even though it's definitely a real
13:07 - dragon so my name is robot that's cute
13:11 - cute little dragon name robot um
13:14 - and so you could you can not see maybe
13:19 - what this dragon to say this like when
13:22 - we start the project and to do that this
13:25 - this green flag button is button click
13:28 - to start a scratch project and now how
13:32 - do you make something happen when you
13:33 - click the green flag well you could go
13:36 - to over here to the events category and
13:40 - these are all blocks that can start
13:42 - something happening so this block will
13:46 - start things make things start happening
13:48 - when the green flag is clicked so you
13:51 - can drag that over here and now we've
13:54 - attached this when green flag clicked
13:56 - block to this save and now when I click
14:01 - the green flag it says that in a speech
14:04 - bubble uh
14:05 - so that is a way to start making a
14:09 - project with your pet now let me see let
14:13 - me see other ideas of things ways you
14:16 - could add to your pet project a one is
14:18 - you could choose a background for it to
14:21 - live in uh so that's just if you go down
14:24 - here uh you can click choose a backdrop
14:27 - and then got all these all these
14:32 - different backdrops to choose from I'm
14:33 - trying to think where I'd like my dragon
14:35 - to Lou I'm a big fan of this you like
14:39 - the forest
14:39 - I like the desert maybe I'll pick the
14:42 - desert uh so my drag on my dragon in the
14:45 - desert named a robot okay it's kind of
14:48 - nice to pick like a place for your pet
14:49 - to live and then you could also add sort
14:52 - of toys for your pet to play with or
14:54 - food for your pet uh and you can do that
14:56 - you can add as many sort of characters
14:58 - or objects to your project as you want
15:00 - so I'll go back to where I got my dragon
15:01 - from which is just hovering down here to
15:03 - choose a spring and then go up to click
15:06 - Choose and then uh there is this food
15:12 - category which I could click on and to
15:15 - get some idea of what my dragon might
15:18 - like for food hmm
15:19 - I think dragons would like cake yeah so
15:22 - now now we have a cake for our dragon
15:27 - so yeah I I think that's like oh yeah
15:31 - and there's one thing to notice when I
15:33 - added the cake it looked like all that
15:35 - code went away but that's just because
15:37 - when you've selected a character here
15:41 - you just see the code that's for that
15:43 - character because every character has
15:46 - their own blocks so the dragon does this
15:49 - it's like you know when the green flag
15:51 - is clicked it says my name is robot but
15:53 - the cake is not gonna do that
15:54 - the cake is you know doesn't those same
15:57 - things wouldn't apply to the cake you
15:58 - could make the cake do something else
16:00 - like oh we could so either we started
16:03 - that other one with this when the green
16:05 - flag is clicked block but we could start
16:07 - the cake doing something with this when
16:10 - this sprite clipped block which instead
16:13 - of it getting started when you click the
16:17 - green flag whatever you put here will
16:20 - get started when you click on the cake
16:22 - so we could make the cake in the up in
16:25 - the sounds category but there's this
16:28 - okay this is start sound walk which will
16:30 - start playing a sound so we can attach
16:33 - that there and and now when we click on
16:37 - the cake happy birthday sound anyway so
16:45 - I am I love this little dragon and it's
16:48 - cake uh so yeah that's kind of how I'd
16:51 - start making a pet project um but you
16:54 - know you could start any way you like
16:55 - and if you'd like more sort of tips or
16:57 - advice on how to get started them ask
17:00 - away
17:00 - no let me get to answering some
17:02 - questions um let's see so okay so
17:11 - someone asks where is the studio um
17:14 - the studio for this week is in the
17:16 - YouTube description for this video if
17:18 - you scroll down there's a couple of
17:19 - links and and one of them is those links
17:22 - to the the studio Ferb where these make
17:25 - a virtual pet project and you can add
17:26 - your projects to the studio if you don't
17:29 - know how to add to a studio don't worry
17:30 - at all I'll show that at the end of the
17:32 - string oh and also I should mention
17:35 - another one of the links down there is
17:37 - there is a bass starter project which
17:39 - you could have also used
17:41 - to get started in your project actually
17:43 - maybe I'll show that now so if you're if
17:46 - you're looking for another way to sort
17:47 - of jump into making your virtual pet
17:50 - another option is this starter project
17:53 - link in the description um and that link
17:56 - will take you here which is this virtual
18:01 - pet starter project um so when you open
18:05 - up this starter project you know it says
18:07 - like here are some ideas of things you
18:09 - could do you could change the pet change
18:11 - background let me show you how you could
18:14 - do that so you can click a see inside
18:18 - and clicking see inside will let you
18:21 - look into the the code of any scratch
18:23 - project and see how the person who made
18:26 - it did it um so in this project there's
18:32 - this monkey and has a football and
18:34 - bananas and a glass of water
18:36 - um and so you could you can do now that
18:39 - you've opened this up you could change
18:41 - it and make it roll that won't change
18:42 - the original project that the person
18:44 - made so it's the one of the suggestions
18:47 - was like maybe you want to not have a
18:50 - monkey have a different character so
18:53 - though what you could do is if you want
18:56 - to keep this these like we also you
18:58 - could just add a character from here
19:00 - like hover over choose a sprite and
19:02 - click Choose you could also just yeah
19:07 - let me show you how to do that I'll show
19:09 - you so hover over choose a sprite and
19:12 - click Choose and then maybe for this one
19:16 - instead of a monkey maybe we want attack
19:20 - that I think that that is adorable so I
19:23 - definitely want to pet that um and then
19:27 - now now I've got a pet back and the
19:31 - monkey you could if you wanted the back
19:35 - to still do these things you could take
19:39 - this like block of code and just drag it
19:43 - over to the back and then you see how it
19:45 - you just drag it over with a bats
19:47 - icon is and then click on the back it's
19:51 - right there so that's how you can get
19:52 - you know
19:53 - if you say you want the the these these
19:57 - things that the monkey does to apply in
19:58 - the back you can drag that over as well
20:02 - put that in as well
20:04 - and then maybe I'll get rid of the
20:05 - monkey and now we have a back instead um
20:09 - and maybe I want the back to say like
20:14 - what should the bat say um I would say
20:17 - hello um so anyway you could also change
20:27 - the background by clicking background uh
20:30 - and do whatever whatever I know wherever
20:33 - you want the bat to be uh I think the
20:36 - bat bat in the forest to be nice so yeah
20:40 - so that's you can just go in and change
20:42 - this code of this starter project
20:44 - however you want and yeah anyway let me
20:49 - know if you'd like more examples of how
20:50 - you could work with the starter project
20:52 - um let me look at these questions um
20:57 - okay uh someone says uh what is your
21:01 - favorite animal well it's a great
21:02 - question i I do love cats a lot also
21:06 - really love dogs
21:08 - if the fictional animals can count I
21:10 - would probably say dragon but I think
21:14 - that maybe Fox yeah so um anyway I think
21:24 - I think I think Fox is right now I love
21:26 - Fox also love owls I love a lot of
21:28 - animals uh and dragons a fun fact is
21:32 - when I was a kid I had a pet a tortoise
21:34 - um and I really wanted to have a pet
21:37 - dragon so my tortoises name is dragon
21:40 - because it was wishful thinking I also
21:44 - want like tortoises too clearly
21:47 - um okay more questions oh my god I don't
21:54 - see the question um okay uh Oh someone
21:57 - says uh can I draw my own pet you
22:00 - totally can let me show you a little bit
22:03 - of how you could do that um
22:06 - let's see I'll make a new project for
22:09 - this I'll show a few a few ways you
22:13 - could draw your own pay for it look
22:18 - going to anywhere I'm going is I'm going
22:21 - to scratch.mit.edu and gonna click on
22:24 - create' which is how you could create a
22:26 - new project so if you're just joining
22:28 - this dream now well it's really nice to
22:31 - have you join uh this is new scratch
22:33 - create along where we get to make a
22:35 - scratch projects together for an hour um
22:37 - we started a little bit late today
22:39 - because we had some audio issues which
22:41 - thank you so much everyone for your
22:43 - patience as we figured out what was
22:46 - causing those um and we're gonna go a
22:50 - little bit we'll go to like a little bit
22:51 - 10 minutes after today just so we get
22:54 - the full hour of creating stuff um so
22:59 - anyway the question that people just ask
23:02 - and oh yeah and if you're just joining
23:03 - now you can ask questions at this link
23:05 - uh that is right below um so yeah ask
23:12 - any kinds of questions you want um the
23:14 - question that someone just asked was um
23:16 - can I draw my own pet and I just wanted
23:20 - to show a few ways that you could draw
23:22 - your own pet so I'm going to get rid of
23:26 - a scratch cat goodbye dear scratch cat
23:28 - you will be missed
23:29 - um and then uh I'm gonna hover over this
23:34 - choose a sprite button but instead of
23:36 - clicking this choose you can go up to
23:40 - paint this option that appears and click
23:44 - paint and then that will take you to you
23:49 - know it makes a new sprite and you can
23:51 - actually uh just paint and control what
23:55 - it looks like um so I'll show a few tips
23:58 - of like for therefore drawing a
24:00 - character in this paint editor that
24:03 - appears drawing a pet that is um the
24:07 - this this mode of drawing is is one it's
24:11 - called
24:11 - vector art and it's one where you can
24:15 - create sort of shapes
24:18 - uh in your drawing and then you can
24:21 - actually move them around by clicking on
24:23 - this this select tool and you can also
24:28 - uh with this what it's like it'll say
24:32 - reshape tool you can actually sort of
24:36 - control you can you can edit the points
24:39 - of a shape and so there I just clicked
24:43 - somewhere and then I dragged it up and
24:47 - now it sort of looks a little bit like
24:49 - the ears of some creature and then I can
24:51 - click here to add another point here and
24:54 - I'll drag that down that's what I like
24:56 - really quick way of making years and let
24:58 - me show that for you again in case you
25:00 - missed how I did that so by clicking on
25:03 - clicking here clicking this circle tool
25:05 - I'll drag and make a circle and then you
25:11 - can click on this reshape tool and then
25:15 - anywhere and so it shows that this shape
25:17 - is made up of these four points they
25:20 - that and then it's like a curved line in
25:23 - between all points and then you can add
25:25 - more points to sort of the outline of
25:28 - your shape so if you want to have ears
25:31 - up here you could click a point here you
25:34 - just click anywhere on the outline to
25:37 - add a point and then you can drag it
25:39 - upward and that makes kind of a little
25:42 - ear and then you could do the same on
25:44 - this side I'll just click here on the
25:46 - outline and then drag that upward and
25:49 - then I'll also click at a point there
25:52 - and then drag it down and that makes
25:54 - kind of like a the top of the head
25:56 - so yeah the that's like some of how I
26:00 - get started with drawing um you can also
26:03 - make up a little just do a lot of
26:06 - drawing of your pet with just making
26:08 - circles so you can click up here to
26:11 - change the color of the circle your
26:12 - about to draw maybe I'll give this pet
26:15 - green eyes so you can click to change
26:18 - the color you click anywhere on this
26:20 - sort of rainbow color slider to pick
26:22 - what kind of color it is and then within
26:25 - that color you pick you can make it
26:28 - darker with this by dropping the
26:30 - brightness
26:31 - but by driving this brightness slider
26:33 - down actually maybe I'll make it have
26:35 - brown eyes and if you're wondering hi
26:37 - Michael Brown its if you go to orange
26:40 - it's a little counterintuitive but if
26:41 - you go to orange and then you drop the
26:44 - bring the brightness down then you can
26:48 - make a brown so I'll and then and then
26:52 - what I was saying is that with making
26:54 - circles you can make so much of a
26:56 - creature so you know some eyes can be
27:00 - sort of ovals or circles there and then
27:05 - maybe all to do a nose you could do
27:08 - another little oval and maybe I'll make
27:10 - the nose be black so I'll drag this
27:13 - brightness all the way down and then
27:15 - that'll make black and then if I make
27:16 - them nose going this direction
27:21 - yeah and and so anyway that's like a
27:25 - little bit of how you could start
27:27 - drawing a pet I love these little
27:28 - creatures cute maybe this will be like
27:31 - the parent or something oh and this is
27:33 - the child and so I think that's that's
27:39 - just some of how you can get started
27:41 - drawing with the vector paint editor and
27:44 - scratch I'm drawing a pet of your own
27:46 - but anyway sending more questions if you
27:47 - like more more ways you could draw a pet
27:50 - let's see okay flower asks um what are
27:55 - your tips on animating hi flower um so
27:58 - yeah that may be all all show some tips
28:01 - on animating um with this little
28:03 - character I drew I might um delete this
28:07 - character for now which I can do by
28:09 - clicking on this shape and then just
28:12 - clicking delete on my keyboard and then
28:15 - if I want to sort of move this towards
28:16 - the middle of the sprite the middle of
28:19 - this drawing I can click I with this
28:22 - with this select tool I can click and
28:24 - drag and then sort of drag it into the
28:28 - middle and it's actually really easy to
28:29 - Center it with this new tool you just
28:31 - Center it right there um nice so I think
28:34 - some of my tips on animating and maybe
28:36 - we can do a whole create along on
28:38 - animating because there's just so much
28:40 - so many different ways you can do it one
28:43 - of my tips on animating is
28:45 - I will duplicate this picture of that ID
28:52 - Ron so you don't have to draw it all the
28:55 - way like new again it'll start out with
28:59 - like a copy of it and then I'll just
29:00 - edit that second one a little bit
29:02 - actually let me do a mouse for this
29:06 - creature I will do and maybe I'll have
29:09 - that Mouse be also a black circle so
29:12 - I'll drag the color all the way the
29:14 - brightness all the way down to it black
29:15 - and and then I'll make a little mouth
29:20 - like that and and now I will duplicate
29:25 - so it's like talking so so let me show
29:27 - you how actually I did that really
29:28 - quickly because I'm gonna have it of it
29:30 - um you can to duplicate to copy the
29:34 - drawing you did you can click you can
29:37 - right click and then click duplicate and
29:42 - now you've got two of them so if I edit
29:46 - this one then I can then I can have two
29:50 - of these sort of costumes and then I can
29:53 - animate between them so I'll zoom in
29:56 - which bikes pressing this button and
29:59 - then you know one sort of easy way to
30:02 - start animating is just start sort of
30:04 - changing the shapes a bit so maybe if I
30:07 - was to make it talk I could have this
30:09 - one be like an open-mouthed opposed and
30:11 - then have this one I couldn't squash
30:14 - this shape in and now we have like a
30:19 - sort of a closed mouth pose so if I
30:23 - switch between these it's like it's
30:25 - talking and so and then now I'm
30:30 - switching between these by clicking on
30:32 - one or the other and by the way anyone
30:34 - who's wondering why I'm not wrapping up
30:36 - yet I'm gonna go a little bit over today
30:38 - I'm gonna go to about 210 Eastern Time
30:41 - okay because it started a little bit
30:43 - late so we'll get a little bit of focus
30:44 - time to go um so let's go back to the so
30:50 - anyway so now you've got this little
30:52 - animation where it has the two different
30:54 - poses and that'll go back so
30:57 - - but how can you do that in the code
31:00 - how could you make it switch between
31:01 - there's this really helpful block in the
31:04 - looks category uh which is this next
31:08 - costume walk and let me zoom in a bit so
31:11 - with this next costume block uh you can
31:15 - actually switch between the costumes in
31:17 - the code and and then now before in the
31:24 - stream I was showing that in the let's
31:26 - say I wanted to do this animation when I
31:28 - click the green flag because the green
31:31 - flag is sort of like a start button for
31:33 - scratch projects um what you do is
31:36 - connect this little next costume block
31:38 - to a when green flag clicked block
31:41 - because if you have a win green flag
31:42 - clicked off and anything you attach to
31:44 - it will will happen when you click the
31:46 - green flag so I can click the green flag
31:49 - and now it makes a little bit and you
31:52 - can even um put that in a loop now
31:57 - what's a loop it will make it a loop is
32:00 - let me show you what one is a loop is
32:03 - just one of these blocks that's sort of
32:05 - like a mouth that says repute or forever
32:08 - and what it does is it just if you put
32:11 - uh you can see that this little shake
32:13 - here a block will fit really nicely
32:15 - there any block that you put inside a
32:18 - loop will happen as many times as the
32:22 - loop tells it to so this if you put this
32:24 - next costume inside this repeat ten loop
32:27 - oh my gosh animated it so fast because
32:31 - it's just doing its costume X costume
32:33 - really really quickly so let's put a
32:35 - weight in there let's slow it down
32:37 - we'll have it do next costume and then
32:39 - wait one second and now if I click it
32:42 - yeah it like animates them out open and
32:45 - close um but you know one second is a
32:48 - little bit long maybe I'll change it to
32:50 - something like point three zero point
32:52 - three seconds and then it opens the
32:54 - mouth so you can have it be talking and
32:56 - then you can attach this to the green
32:58 - flag to have it sort of talk when you
33:01 - click the green flag so those are some
33:03 - of my tips on animating maybe we'll do
33:05 - more stuff about animating later because
33:06 - it's very very fun
33:08 - but yeah thanks for the question flower
33:09 - um okay um let's see
33:13 - Oh someone asks um can we just take a
33:15 - photo of our pets yes totally you could
33:19 - take a photo of your pet how'd it be in
33:20 - the project you could take a photo of
33:22 - like a book or something we are one
33:25 - second I have this Totoro journal I kind
33:28 - of want to make a pet project with this
33:30 - taking a picture of this Totoro journal
33:32 - and have it meet my pet because it's
33:34 - extremely cute so yes you can take a
33:36 - picture of your pet you'd also take a
33:37 - picture of an object around you have
33:39 - that be your pet um someone asks also um
33:44 - do i oh yeah can you add a picture from
33:49 - the internet totally make sure you give
33:51 - credit to the image in like the notes
33:54 - and credits of your project but totally
33:56 - uh oh my gosh infinity of cute animals
34:00 - on the internet but would be great in
34:02 - youth projects and you know we have
34:05 - another question about the paint editor
34:06 - um someone asks what's the difference
34:09 - between vector and bitmap some great
34:12 - questions your source all these are such
34:13 - great questions yeah let me show you the
34:16 - difference between vector and bitmap so
34:19 - I mentioned before that um that this is
34:24 - drawing in vector art mode in a vector
34:27 - art here's here's sure the the features
34:30 - of vector art let me pick out like a red
34:33 - color so you can see it a little bit
34:34 - better than a lot in in vector art mode
34:39 - you it's really good for making shapes
34:44 - and then changing them later so I can
34:47 - drag around to create this circle but
34:50 - then I could decide that I want the
34:51 - circle over here and grab it pull it
34:53 - over there or you know I could decide
34:56 - that I want to click on this reshape
35:00 - tool and grab one of the points of it
35:02 - and make it like a scene it's really
35:06 - easy to just make those changes so it's
35:09 - it's it's vector art is not like that's
35:14 - not that easy to like draw as you would
35:17 - on a piece of paper it's it's you more
35:20 - think about the shapes that something
35:22 - and then you can like create those
35:24 - shapes and then it's really easy to
35:25 - change them if you want to now on the
35:28 - other hand let me
35:29 - hover over oh you know what I can hide
35:32 - the the I think this would work
35:35 - oh yes haha I added a new trick I can hi
35:38 - to the questions button if I want to
35:39 - show something it's down here um and
35:41 - thank you all for sending in comments
35:43 - but that would have been helpful
35:44 - um so down here if you click on choose a
35:48 - costume uh you can actually click up
35:51 - paint and paint a new costume I'll paint
35:55 - a new costume to show you uh I know I'll
35:57 - put the questions link back up um to
36:00 - show you what that mode is like so
36:03 - that's vector mode it's good for making
36:06 - shapes and then moving them around
36:08 - changing them whenever you want to now
36:11 - if you click down here you can click
36:13 - convert to bit and now we are in bitmap
36:17 - mode and these tools on the side change
36:20 - and you know what bitmap mode is good
36:24 - for is it's really good for painting
36:26 - directly on the canvas so it's a little
36:28 - bit more similar to drawing on a piece
36:31 - of paper the first you know tool here is
36:34 - this brush tool and so you can write
36:37 - something you could draw something so I
36:39 - could draw a oh wow my computer's a
36:42 - little laggy so this is gonna be quite a
36:43 - angular creature but you could draw a
36:46 - face with some ears and draw eyes and a
36:53 - little smile oh my gosh I love this will
36:55 - be um Wow so cute and then you can click
36:58 - on the fill bucket and color it in can
37:04 - make the color a little bit my pale
37:07 - click and you know click with the fill
37:10 - bucket so it's it's a bitmap sort of
37:13 - makes it easy to just draw right on the
37:15 - canvas but then the drawback is that you
37:19 - if let's say I was like oh ok no I want
37:21 - to move this right here you can't
37:25 - there's no select tool you can't like
37:27 - grab that right here
37:29 - you have to like select something in a
37:32 - rectangle but then you can't just get
37:34 - the
37:34 - you're also gonna get the face too so
37:37 - you know that it in vector it's really
37:41 - good because you can you can undo so it
37:43 - gets its year back in vector you could
37:46 - do that so you could be like actually no
37:48 - I want the C over here so it's like a
37:50 - phone that this creature is calling on
37:53 - much made it smaller um then I could be
37:56 - like actually no nevermind I should want
37:58 - to see you over here you can change your
38:00 - mind you can you can move things but in
38:02 - bitmap you can't so so that's like the
38:05 - difference between vectors but not thank
38:06 - you for the great question um let's see
38:11 - do okay and I noticed that YouTube is is
38:15 - cutting the stream in and out
38:17 - occasionally um so sorry for the stream
38:21 - drops that you're experiencing I hope we
38:23 - can make that better as well um and I
38:27 - think we'll start wrapping off in like
38:29 - five minutes but I mean you can answer
38:32 - just a couple more questions um you do
38:36 - so okay you've got questions someone
38:39 - says um how do you edit sprites it's
38:43 - also a great question let me show you so
38:46 - if you hover over this choose a sprite
38:48 - button and click Choose we can so I
38:52 - showed how to draw some of your own
38:54 - sprites you can also edit sprites from
38:57 - the library here so let's pick up
38:59 - character to edit to BR hit yeah edit
39:04 - this butterfly uh so sorry my computer
39:09 - is being a little bit slow so and let's
39:12 - so we'll go over to the to the code and
39:16 - and so now we got this butterfly that
39:19 - could be our pet um and how you can add
39:21 - a sprite is so let's say you're you're
39:25 - coding your pet in and you're in you're
39:28 - in this code tab you can click over to
39:31 - this costumes tab and now you can edit
39:35 - that character in the paint editor so
39:38 - you could click on this fill bucket and
39:39 - recolor some segments of it so click
39:42 - there all the wings to recolor it or you
39:46 - cou
39:46 - like you could click on the select tool
39:49 - and select everything and you grab this
39:52 - anchor down here you could rotate it so
39:55 - yeah those that's the those are like how
39:58 - you can edit edit sprint is you you
40:00 - might start me starting out from the
40:02 - code tab but you can just click on the
40:04 - costumes tab and edit the Xperia P rinse
40:08 - of a sprite so yeah thanks for that
40:11 - question yeah let's see someone else
40:14 - asks can you make food for your pet
40:16 - totally so one way you could do it is if
40:20 - you hover over this choose a sprite
40:22 - button here and click shoes then we have
40:27 - tons of food you can choose from like
40:30 - right over here if you click on the food
40:32 - category it's an easy way to get all of
40:34 - it you could add in any of these foods
40:36 - you want so maybe your pet loves bread
40:38 - maybe it loves fruit salad its fruit
40:41 - salad it's very fun um so you can add
40:45 - food for your for your sprite that way
40:48 - you can also upload a picture of food so
40:52 - if you hover over the choose a sprite
40:54 - button here but then go all the way up
40:55 - to upload yeah you could just upload a
40:58 - picture of food for your sprite and and
41:02 - you could also go to paint and then you
41:08 - do and then you could draw your own food
41:10 - so like I think I could probably draw an
41:12 - apple very easily so go to the circle
41:15 - and click on the color and set it to red
41:18 - and then that's an apple but also if I
41:24 - wanted to make it a little bit more
41:26 - clear that it was an apple you can click
41:28 - on this lime tool and you can draw a
41:29 - little line maybe I will click the
41:34 - select tool and select this line and
41:36 - make it a little bit bigger a little
41:38 - increase the thickness of the line oh
41:40 - yeah now you got a little apple that's
41:42 - like super simple food do do Oh someone
41:48 - asks what is the big t shape in the
41:50 - editor this I think thank you for
41:52 - talking about this T shape this is a
41:54 - text tool so you can actually click on
41:56 - that and let
41:58 - set the color to like red or something
42:00 - and then you can click somewhere and
42:03 - write text so I'm an apple so that's
42:09 - what that tea is is you can write
42:11 - actually write text right there that's
42:13 - right oh thank you for all these
42:15 - questions um let me see if I have time
42:21 - to answer one of them really really
42:22 - quickly and then I'm gonna wrap up this
42:23 - question was can we make our pet follow
42:27 - our mouse pointer yes you totally can
42:29 - let me show you how to do that let's say
42:32 - we want the butterfly to follow our
42:35 - mouse pointer so we can click on the
42:36 - butterfly and then there is this block
42:41 - that says glide 1 seconds to random
42:44 - position when you drag that out and then
42:47 - click on it to see what it does so it
42:49 - makes it the butterfly glide to a random
42:51 - position actually this blog has a menu
42:54 - so you can click on random position and
42:57 - actually you could choose mouse pointer
43:00 - from the menu so now if I click on this
43:03 - block the butterfly actually glides to
43:06 - my mouse pointer so my mouse pointer was
43:08 - there because I was clicking on that so
43:11 - so this glide 2 mouse pointer block
43:13 - could be helpful for that now the
43:16 - butterfly went to my mouse pointer once
43:18 - but how do I make it go I to my mouse
43:21 - pointer over and over again so we keeps
43:22 - following it well if you meant remember
43:26 - these loops that I talked about earlier
43:27 - in the stream in the in the control
43:29 - category we could drag out this forever
43:33 - block and then just put it here and then
43:37 - if we put the glide 1 seconds - mouse
43:39 - pointer block inside the forever block
43:42 - then then the butterfly is gonna keep
43:48 - following my mouse pointer uh so that's
43:51 - okay I see that the stream is still
43:53 - freezing so maybe I'll just start to
43:55 - wrap up um anyway so but that's that's a
43:58 - little bit of code that could get your
44:00 - pet if all your mouse pointer which
44:01 - could be really really cute awesome and
44:04 - and thank you everybody for bearing with
44:06 - the the stream of freezing and all the
44:09 - other in the audio
44:11 - thank you for bearing with all of this
