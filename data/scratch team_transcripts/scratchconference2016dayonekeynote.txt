01:04 - for those who don't know me I'm Mitch
01:05 - Resnik also known as M reses on Scratch
01:08 - and I head up the scratch team here at
01:10 - MIT it's just wonderful to be surrounded
01:13 - by so many people who have done so much
01:15 - to help spread the ideas and the spirit
01:18 - of scratch around the world so it's just
01:20 - great having you all here it's hard for
01:22 - me to you know you know believe that
01:25 - it's already the fifth scratch
01:27 - conference we've had here at MIT
01:30 - uh back in 2007 just a year after we
01:34 - 2008 a year after we launched scratch
01:36 - Karen brenon and I organized the first
01:38 - conference and we've been doing them
01:40 - every other year here at MIT since in
01:42 - between years others in Barcelona and
01:45 - Amsterdam other places of organized
01:47 - scratch conferences it's been great to
01:49 - see how it's just grown and grown over
01:50 - the years as scratch itself has grown
01:53 - and grown over the years and I just love
01:56 - the way that these conferences bring
01:58 - together people from so many different
01:59 - back backgrounds and interests I think
02:01 - at this year's conference we have people
02:03 - from 25 different countries around the
02:05 - world actually maybe people from outside
02:08 - the United States could stand up for a
02:10 - moment just to
02:11 - see so it's great to have so many people
02:13 - coming from around the
02:24 - world but there you know also people I
02:27 - think the crowd the people coming they
02:29 - also represent working in schools but
02:32 - also working outside of schools people
02:34 - working with very young children up to
02:36 - people working with college students and
02:38 - Beyond you know people working across
02:41 - different disciplines connecting
02:43 - together uh computer science and
02:45 - technology and art education and design
02:48 - so connecting together all those
02:49 - different disciplines uh so it's just
02:51 - been wonderful to see the wide range of
02:54 - different ways that people are
02:55 - connecting with scratch and coming
02:57 - together but I think one thing that also
02:59 - is wonderful to despite the very
03:00 - different backgrounds and interests
03:02 - people have I think people come here you
03:05 - know sharing some common values and
03:07 - common vision and we see people coming
03:10 - here dedicated to helping young people
03:12 - around the world learning to think
03:14 - creatively and reason systematically and
03:17 - work collaboratively dedicated to
03:20 - helping young people not only develop
03:22 - their thinking but also develop their
03:24 - voice so they can express themselves in
03:26 - the world and and developing their
03:28 - identity so they see themselves as
03:30 - someone who can be an active participant
03:31 - and contributor you know to the world so
03:35 - it's just you know wonderful to see all
03:36 - the ways that people come together
03:38 - around these shared ideas the conference
03:40 - also brings together some longtime
03:43 - members of the scratch Community there's
03:44 - some of you who've been using scratch
03:46 - for almost a decade now I know others
03:48 - are just getting started some have been
03:50 - to many scratch conferences before I
03:53 - know for some of you are was talking
03:54 - last night at the reception I know it's
03:56 - the first conference for some actually
03:58 - I'd just be interested for for how many
03:59 - of you if it's your first scratch
04:01 - conference could you stand
04:03 - up
04:10 - right so you know we want to welcome all
04:13 - of you for coming for the first time
04:14 - although I know I met some people where
04:16 - it's their first scratch conference but
04:17 - they've been using scratch for a long
04:19 - time but I hope that we all find ways
04:21 - for those of you who' have been at other
04:23 - scratch conferences Reach Out connect
04:25 - you know with others who are here for
04:26 - the first time we've tried to design
04:28 - this as a very participatory conference
04:31 - you know over the next few days there'll
04:32 - be you know Hands-On workshops and
04:35 - interactive panels and posters and demos
04:38 - where you can go up and talk to people
04:39 - who are developing things around scratch
04:42 - you have the chance to meet all
04:43 - different you know people not just
04:45 - Educators but developers who are
04:47 - developing extensions to scratch or
04:49 - variance to scratch uh and also
04:52 - researchers who are studying the ways
04:54 - young people are learning with scratch
04:56 - uh so I hope you'll take this as a
04:58 - chance to meet other people uh to share
05:01 - ideas to learn with and from one another
05:04 - and in that Spirit maybe we'll just get
05:06 - started by learning a little about your
05:07 - neighbors I'd like if you can just take
05:09 - a couple minutes and maybe share with
05:11 - your neighbors a scratch memory from the
05:14 - past year if you've just getting started
05:16 - talk about how you found out about
05:18 - scratch but share a scratch memory with
05:20 - the people sitting around you for a
05:22 - moment or
05:28 - two
05:58 - e
06:28 - for
06:58 - for
07:26 - okay are you
07:32 - I always hate breaking up act of
07:44 - conversation
07:48 - so as I said I always feel bad breaking
07:52 - up such you know active
07:54 - conversation but we did organize the
07:56 - conference there'll be lots of
07:58 - opportunity for conversation
07:59 - there's lots of time in between the
08:01 - sessions and I think this type of
08:03 - interaction is exactly what we hope will
08:04 - fill the next few days so since you had
08:07 - a chance to share some of your scratch
08:10 - memories from the past year I thought I
08:11 - would share a couple of my scratch
08:13 - memories you know from the past year uh
08:17 - one a bunch of the memories are
08:19 - associated with the annual event that we
08:21 - do called scratch day as you know a
08:24 - number of years ago we started having a
08:25 - scratch day here at MIT uh but then
08:28 - started encouraging other people to run
08:30 - their own scratch Day events around the
08:33 - world and every year it's grown and
08:35 - grown this year there were 659 events in
08:38 - 74 countries in May when we had scratch
08:41 - day actually may just raise hands how
08:43 - many people were involved in a scratch
08:45 - day so it's great to see so many people
08:47 - and hope we can continue to spread that
08:49 - and grow it in years ahead and it was
08:51 - great as we see just people sharing
08:54 - their ideas about scratch day from all
08:56 - over the world you know from Indonesia
08:58 - China Oman
08:59 - and different people all having
09:01 - different types of scratch days again I
09:03 - think in the spirit of scratch and in
09:05 - the spirit of the theme of this
09:07 - conference with many paths many styles
09:10 - it's not a cookie cutter every scratch
09:12 - day around the world is exactly the same
09:14 - they share in spirit but we love seeing
09:17 - how different places around the world
09:19 - all have their own put their own stamp
09:21 - on scratch day uh and if we look at
09:23 - other places from Japan Brazil Rwanda
09:27 - all around the world some many different
09:29 - people finding different ways of
09:31 - bringing young people Educators others
09:33 - together to work together on scratch
09:36 - share ideas about scratch actually the
09:39 - group that did the Rwanda scratch day
09:41 - also produced a video that was one of my
09:43 - most memorable videos from the year so
09:46 - in addition to scratch day they were
09:47 - actively participating in Africa code
09:50 - week and they posted this video about
09:53 - some of their participation using
09:55 - scratch during Africa code
09:58 - week
10:28 - fore
10:50 - and again we saw other videos and photos
10:52 - from around the world of people sharing
10:54 - the spirit and supporting young people
10:56 - growing up as creative
10:58 - learners for me though a lot of the
11:00 - strongest memories I have of the year
11:02 - are from Individual scratchers and
11:04 - seeing how you know how how scratch has
11:08 - entered their lives so I want to share
11:10 - with you a few quotes that we got we get
11:12 - lots of mail from scratches around the
11:14 - world I thought I'd share with you
11:16 - quotes from a few messages that we
11:19 - receiv received this year from young
11:20 - people using
11:22 - scratch here's one scratch has become
11:24 - part of my life every morning I wake up
11:26 - and I immediately think how can I
11:28 - improve with scratch my friends and
11:30 - family don't quite understand the beauty
11:32 - of this website but I do it's art music
11:35 - games and animation compressed into
11:37 - visual coding blocks and that in my
11:38 - humble opinion is pretty
11:42 - amazing so this idea how can I improve
11:45 - with scratch the idea it's not just how
11:47 - I can make a project but saying this
11:49 - isign I can sort of continue to improve
11:51 - with in ways I can keep learning from
11:53 - here's another quote scratch has made
11:56 - such a huge impact on my life ever since
11:58 - I started is piie
12:00 - 31415
12:01 - n265 two years ago I'm a ninth grader I
12:05 - still use it even though I could easily
12:07 - switch to writing out my code it's
12:09 - usually not even about the code the
12:10 - animations the games it's all about the
12:13 - community and again that's something we
12:15 - hear from so many scratchers around the
12:17 - world they start out to express
12:19 - themselves gring projects but stay for
12:21 - the community to become part of the
12:22 - community I think I was especially happy
12:24 - that someone who thought to create a
12:26 - username piy 31415 9 got so connected
12:30 - with the community because sometimes
12:31 - there's a feeling if someone who get
12:32 - started that would just be you know
12:34 - focused on you know the writing the
12:36 - project but so nice to see everyone
12:38 - getting involved in the community and
12:40 - one more quote that I'll share thank you
12:42 - so much for everything scratch has done
12:44 - for me scratch really is an amazing
12:46 - Community some things can be annoying
12:48 - and scratch could use a lot of
12:49 - improvement but you're getting
12:51 - there scratch is a huge part of my life
12:54 - I'll say
12:57 - 60%
13:02 - so the same way that scratchers wake up
13:04 - every morning think how they can improve
13:06 - a scratch we on the scratch team also
13:08 - think how we can improve scratch and
13:10 - it's good to get some encouragement you
13:12 - know that that we're getting there so
13:13 - it's nice to hear that and if we keep
13:15 - doing it maybe you'll get to 65% next
13:17 - year
13:18 - so but again so it's great to hear from
13:21 - scratches but of course a main way that
13:23 - we interact with scratches is through
13:24 - the projects that they share on the
13:27 - scratch website to make every day now
13:30 - there's more than 20,000 projects shared
13:33 - on the scratch website from young people
13:36 - around the world actually many more than
13:37 - that are created that's the number that
13:39 - are shared every day for other people to
13:41 - see and to interact with so that's more
13:43 - than 100,000 projects every week you
13:45 - know more than six million projects over
13:47 - the past year uh and you know it's been
13:51 - so exciting for us to see and so
13:53 - inspiring for us to see all the
13:55 - different ways that young people are
13:56 - using scratch and there are many
13:58 - projects that sort of capture our
13:59 - attention and just Delight us and you
14:02 - know make and and also give us ideas of
14:04 - how we can continue to grow and evolve
14:06 - scratch over the past year one project
14:09 - that really stood out to us was a
14:11 - project by a member of the scratch
14:12 - Community bubble
14:14 - 103 and this came across in the past
14:16 - year was a project called color divide
14:19 - and actually became a series of projects
14:22 - it started out the first one that we saw
14:24 - was a trailer for a series of projects
14:27 - that she was planning to work on so let
14:29 - me show you the trailer project that
14:31 - that she you know that she created and
14:33 - that caught our
14:37 - attention welcome to Aurora land of
14:40 - color and Magic every child at the age
14:43 - of 12 faces the test to determine their
14:45 - magical strength and their color rank
14:48 - but all is not as it seems this test
14:51 - means everything to me I can't fail what
14:54 - if I don't get a color I don't want a
14:57 - color anyways I'm I'm going to fail the
15:00 - test but banishment haven't you ever
15:03 - wondered what's out there I mean there's
15:05 - got to be something I got close to the
15:07 - gates once and I saw something a boy I
15:11 - hate living in this place The Magicians
15:13 - are dictat they tore my family apart
15:17 - they destroyed they destroyed my home
15:19 - and burned my mother together we'll fail
15:22 - this test
15:25 - together let's see what you made of then
15:44 - so we love this project it's not just
15:46 - that we click the love it button on
15:47 - scratch we really love this project and
15:50 - we were so happy when actually we were
15:52 - organizing the conference and the
15:54 - creator of this project submitt a
15:56 - proposal so I'm very happy that she's
15:57 - here with us today today and I want to
15:59 - invite Tyran also known as bubble 103 to
16:02 - come up on stage to to talk a little bit
16:04 - about her
16:12 - experiences D it's great having you here
16:15 - uh and to to be able to share your
16:17 - project and more people to see it so I
16:20 - thought maybe it would be great to to
16:22 - have F hear a little bit more about some
16:23 - of went into how you got the ideas for
16:26 - this project and the process of working
16:27 - on this project I know this was just a
16:29 - trailer and then you uh got you engaged
16:33 - lots of other people from the community
16:34 - to work with you on the projects that
16:36 - led from it um so the trailer kind of
16:39 - started out as a collaboration well the
16:42 - story was a collaboration um I was
16:45 - actually role playing with these like
16:47 - five other scratches that I'd kind of
16:49 - just met in the
16:50 - community and we started coming up with
16:53 - this story called the color divide where
16:55 - they'd be well the trailer and um I
16:59 - wasn't planning on like making a project
17:01 - for it we were just we were just having
17:02 - fun role playing and like getting to
17:04 - know each other still like friends all
17:06 - of them um but then I I sort of got like
17:10 - struck by inspiration and I was like I
17:12 - need to animate this I I hadn't ever
17:15 - animated in scratch or animated all
17:17 - before but that didn't matter because I
17:19 - was inspired um and I'd been working
17:22 - with the scratch environment for long
17:24 - enough that I I kind of felt comfortable
17:26 - enough to just try it but you you start
17:29 - you did start with scratch around five
17:30 - years ago so right yeah so it's it's
17:33 - been a
17:35 - while um and then I I I wasn't planning
17:38 - on kind of sharing this trailer on
17:40 - scratch at first I was kind of like well
17:41 - I don't know I've never made something
17:43 - like this before but I mean I kind of
17:45 - just shared it and I was
17:47 - like um and then what was the reaction
17:49 - like when you shared it wow um I mean
17:54 - I've I've always got a lot of support
17:56 - you know from the scratch community and
17:58 - and I I was so like overwhelmed with the
18:01 - response and you know at first I wasn't
18:03 - kind of I didn't really think about oh
18:05 - let's make an animated series I was kind
18:07 - of just like oh I've got these images in
18:08 - my head and a story I'm inspired by and
18:11 - scratches that I kind of want to share
18:13 - um this with but then you know other
18:16 - scratches in the community would come to
18:18 - me they' be like bubble bubble you need
18:20 - to make this a series I'm like okay I'd
18:22 - never done that before but from them
18:24 - kind of believing in me and supporting
18:26 - me I I guess I kind of started to
18:27 - believe in my myself and I was like you
18:29 - know what I haven't make an animated
18:30 - series don't know what I'm doing but and
18:33 - then you put out a call to ask other
18:34 - people to help in developing characters
18:36 - and voices yes um well at first I I was
18:39 - kind of kind of kind of I was I was
18:42 - doing it all myself like I did most of
18:44 - the voicing in the first episode but I
18:46 - mean a lot of people were really
18:47 - offering to help and so I I started to
18:50 - get more and more people involved you
18:52 - know it felt less like you know
18:54 - something I was making something that we
18:56 - were making together you know um
18:59 - that was that was great yeah and then
19:02 - actually maybe just you play a little
19:04 - bit of then the next one the the first
19:07 - installment episode of the series uh is
19:13 - here well we'll just play a short bit of
19:16 - this and then maybe can talk a little
19:17 - bit about or the how people collaborated
19:19 - around
19:26 - it welcome to Aurora
19:29 - my
19:31 - home some call it the city of color and
19:43 - Magic it's great we all know our place
19:48 - here you see we're all ranked based on
19:52 - our magical ability if you're not so
19:54 - good at Magic that's a level red the
19:57 - most powerful of Violet if you're not
19:59 - strong enough to get even a red you're
20:02 - banished to outside Aurora to the
20:06 - Wilderness so I mean I can so I can see
20:08 - here that he used 598 assets and has 413
20:13 - scripts so clearly a lot of work went
20:15 - into this project
20:18 - yeah and I also see if if I look down on
20:21 - the notes and credits and it's great
20:22 - that you give lots of notes and credits
20:23 - we always encourage members of the
20:24 - community so you have a long list of all
20:26 - the people who help design characters
20:28 - and voice them and who conceive things
20:31 - but maybe you can say a little bit more
20:32 - about how you all collaborated on this
20:33 - yeah so I ended up with this impressive
20:35 - credits list um so one of the things
20:37 - after I released the trailer like a lot
20:39 - of scratches were kind of um well since
20:41 - it started from a role play and each of
20:43 - the characters were designed by the kind
20:45 - of five of us who started the story a
20:47 - lot of other scratchers were like I want
20:49 - to be in this too I want to make a
20:51 - character for this which was so cool I
20:52 - was so excited for me exciting for me
20:56 - and uh so I wanted to have a a way for
20:59 - like all of us to kind of be involved in
21:01 - it so what I did was so in the episode
21:04 - there's like a lot of kind of faces like
21:06 - in the scenery and characters there and
21:08 - all of those were designed by other
21:10 - scratches so they'd come to me with
21:12 - their design or a drawing they've made
21:13 - and then I just redraw it and put it in
21:15 - and they not their name in the notes and
21:17 - credits I mean also the music is um I I
21:21 - don't something that's important to me
21:22 - is all the music I use is by other
21:24 - scratches because I'm so inspired by
21:26 - like way scratches um they share like
21:29 - the music they've made on scratch
21:31 - specifically for other scratches to use
21:32 - in their
21:34 - projects yeah I see it's clearly it
21:36 - became very popular in the community we
21:37 - see that about 15,000 people watched it
21:40 - and of those 20 almost 2,800 people
21:43 - loved it so uh maybe you can say a
21:45 - little bit about uh the storyline you
21:48 - know about the color divide and why that
21:50 - had a special meaning for you or and and
21:53 - how you thought about that I mean at
21:55 - first it was you know the kind of
21:56 - collaborative story and the the sort of
21:58 - setting for it was made by the other
22:00 - scratcher who created the role play but
22:03 - I mean since then that I've been working
22:04 - with it and um it it's taken on like so
22:07 - much more meaning for me and I'm only
22:09 - really understanding now why I was so
22:11 - drawn to it at first
22:15 - um so the the kind of main message that
22:19 - I'm doing from it is that you know
22:22 - Society will oh okay now it gets all
22:25 - deep so um so the one kind of
22:28 - thing that Society is putting so much
22:30 - weight on um and saying well to be a
22:33 - good person you have to be this one
22:35 - thing you know people are so much more
22:37 - than that you can be so much more than
22:40 - that um you know okaye of this it's like
22:43 - magic but I mean it's so many other
22:44 - things um in our world you know and I
22:47 - mean that's May yeah a special meaning
22:50 - from where you grow up maybe yes
22:52 - especially since um so I'm from South
22:54 - Africa so um I've grown up
22:58 - kind of still seeing the kind of scars
23:00 - that have been left by a parted like in
23:02 - my country um so like each character is
23:05 - kind of inspired by a the way different
23:09 - people kind of reacted to it and the
23:11 - kind of things I'm still seeing now so
23:14 - like uh Leia the one who was talking
23:17 - there she's the one who's feeling like
23:20 - kind of gut feel like oh something's not
23:22 - right here but I'm too afraid to
23:24 - challenge it the other um one Fage the
23:27 - one with the
23:28 - the fire in the eyes how tragic story
23:30 - and everything it took me ages to
23:32 - animate um she's the one who's you been
23:35 - oppressed and she's got nothing to lose
23:37 - so she's just like screw it I'm going to
23:40 - rebel and stuff and then I mean lots of
23:43 - other characters have specific messages
23:44 - as well about the importance of um
23:47 - fighting for something instead of just
23:49 - against it you know and building instead
23:52 - of kind of breaking
23:55 - something that stuff that's great maybe
23:58 - you can say a little bit so as you said
24:00 - you started working on this in the past
24:02 - year you've been working on this you
24:03 - started around five years ago maybe you
24:05 - can say a little bit about what
24:07 - attracted you to scratch and what is it
24:08 - that kept you coming to scratch and how
24:10 - that's evolved over time so I was
24:12 - introduced to scratch um just like one
24:15 - lesson um at school and we were kind of
24:18 - we were kind of just told like put this
24:20 - block here do this do this which I
24:22 - didn't find that exciting but so I went
24:25 - home I went home like okay this this
24:28 - thing called scratch all right so I went
24:30 - in and I started messing around with it
24:33 - um I couldn't really get it to do what I
24:35 - wanted it to but the thing I was so
24:37 - entranced by was
24:39 - like um the kind of magic
24:43 - of doing some making something and then
24:45 - the computer like does it like scratch
24:49 - cat moved I'm a computer genius
24:52 - guys so I kept coming back to kind of
24:55 - feel that kind of magic of like playing
24:56 - around um
24:58 - and making things happen and you know
25:00 - most of the time it didn't do what I was
25:02 - expecting at all and that that was the
25:03 - best part I mean especially as someone
25:06 - who's always like being afraid of of
25:09 - getting something wrong and making
25:10 - mistakes it was so like freeing to be in
25:12 - a space where making mistakes is the
25:14 - best thing you can do and but I mean I
25:17 - got even more like kind of sucked into
25:19 - scratch when I found the scratch online
25:20 - community which is
25:24 - just yeah they um they're they're
25:27 - probably the reason I'm actually like
25:29 - able to be not nervous right now as they
25:31 - they all know that I'm here at the
25:32 - scratch C they're like bubble you're
25:34 - going to do great I'm just like thank
25:35 - you
25:37 - guys they're so supportive and I mean
25:41 - it's a community that's kind of
25:42 - interacting on a different level you
25:44 - know where we're all working together as
25:47 - content creators um so when we when we
25:50 - look at each other's projects we're not
25:51 - taking it like at face value like well I
25:54 - I don't know what to say man this is
25:56 - this animation it's not quite what
25:57 - Disney did or whatever it's it's like
25:59 - you can see exactly how they made it and
26:01 - it's and so inspiring so
26:05 - inspiring maybe we can take a look at
26:07 - some other projects that you did in the
26:08 - past as as I looked at your projects so
26:11 - and there's a wide variety one thing
26:12 - that again I always like first of all
26:14 - look at the website overall and also
26:16 - with individual scratches it always I
26:18 - get excited when I see that people have
26:19 - done a wide variety of projects because
26:21 - I think that's what we' hope that people
26:22 - could express themselves in so many
26:24 - different ways so here was one that I
26:26 - saw they did there was a water cycle
26:28 - game where if you do this it's a type of
26:30 - simulation where I can get to move the
26:33 - cloud and I bar move it over here to
26:35 - rain on the desert but I didn't I there
26:38 - wasn't enough I didn't get enough water
26:40 - from the
26:42 - ocean
26:44 - there may you can tell the story around
26:47 - this well
26:49 - um so I you know I started scratch at
26:53 - school um and then I I kind of started
26:55 - to experiment with using it in school
26:59 - like for when we did projects so I don't
27:00 - know we were supposed to design a
27:02 - computer game and write about it I
27:05 - didn't really want to do that so I just
27:07 - made it instead I have to keep working
27:08 - so it doesn't die
27:10 - off um and then like a few of the
27:13 - teachers were like okay this is a
27:15 - scratch thing and this kid's doing
27:16 - things all right oh so is it is it
27:18 - possible to make like a like a a thing
27:20 - that teaches people stuff and I was like
27:23 - uh yeah I think so cool um so then I
27:27 - kind of messed around a bit and made
27:29 - this thing it's so weird seeing CU I
27:31 - haven't looked at it in like a year or
27:34 - something um um it didn't it didn't run
27:36 - on the school computers though cuz uh we
27:38 - we didn't have very good internet or the
27:40 - computers are the these brick things
27:41 - like this big so yeah he our teacher
27:44 - didn't really see it but it was fun
27:46 - making it well it looks like you're
27:49 - playing out something you've been
27:49 - learning about in school and making it
27:51 - come to life but this idea you said
27:53 - about using scratch help other people
27:55 - learn things I know that's something
27:56 - else that has been part of what you've
27:58 - done on scratch you had mentioned me
28:00 - tried to you set up like to try to have
28:03 - people Mentor each other on scratch yeah
28:05 - that was
28:08 - um I I wanted to so when I don't know I
28:12 - love teaching I love sharing like
28:14 - knowledge I mean think that's a thing
28:15 - that is a lot in the scratch Community
28:17 - is sharing ideas like and knowledge not
28:20 - just projects so um I wanted to make a
28:23 - thing where I'd be able to teach new
28:25 - scratches all the things that I was
28:27 - confused about when I was a new
28:28 - scratcher but I wanted it to be like a
28:30 - kind of mentoring like one-on-one thing
28:33 - so I came up with this whole idea and I
28:37 - put this whole thing together where I'd
28:38 - make a like a project um which would
28:40 - teach kind of Concepts um and then walk
28:44 - the scratcher through making a kind of
28:47 - simple project using those Concepts CU I
28:49 - thought that was kind of the best way to
28:50 - learn which is the way I kind of did it
28:53 - didn't really work out that well because
28:55 - that time in South Africa um the
28:56 - electric was really messed up lots of
28:59 - drama and we kept getting load shedding
29:00 - so three times a day electricity is gone
29:02 - I'm just like I'm done it's not working
29:06 - but I learn I learned a lot from that
29:07 - but then you started making individual
29:09 - projects to help explain how to do some
29:11 - things yes so the mentoring thing didn't
29:13 - work so I was like you know I kind of
29:14 - want to make um so I didn't want to do
29:16 - something that with so high maintenance
29:17 - but I still wanted to share these
29:19 - Concepts um that I wanted to teach so I
29:22 - started making a few tutorials like
29:24 - here's one where it was about using the
29:27 - Vector editor and the paint editor and
29:29 - know your in your projects you make
29:31 - great use of the vector editor Vector
29:33 - editor I'm like I'm such a weird fangle
29:35 - I like Fango over Vector it's amazing
29:38 - well it made us really have to go when
29:40 - we did scratch 2.0 it was a lot of work
29:43 - to add Vector editing in addition to
29:44 - bitmap and sometimes you thought should
29:46 - we really be doing this so it that makes
29:48 - us feel happy when scratchers are so
29:50 - happy with it so maybe you can just say
29:53 - a little bit I'm just going to very
29:55 - quickly uh page through this this is a
29:57 - very long tutorial that starts out
29:59 - explaining the different parts of the
30:01 - vector editor but then how to make use
30:03 - of it I don't know if you can just say
30:04 - some things about as I just page through
30:06 - very quickly yeah so um the main thing
30:08 - that I wanted to focus on besides the
30:10 - just the tools was teaching the kind of
30:11 - Concepts
30:13 - um i' you know I'd seen a lot of
30:15 - tutorials um where they where scratcher
30:17 - would kind of teach like how to do a
30:19 - specific thing but for me I really
30:21 - wanted to focus on the kind of concepts
30:23 - for me the biggest concept to kind of
30:25 - grasp in Vector was that you're working
30:27 - with shapes instead of like a a flat
30:29 - image so I I wanted to find a way to
30:32 - kind of explain that to scratches so
30:35 - again um I I like the kind of learning
30:36 - where you're walking someone through
30:38 - making something and then explaining
30:39 - Concepts as you go cuz when you're
30:41 - working you're walking someone through
30:43 - making something like these eyes um you
30:46 - understand like why am I learning this
30:48 - concept um and kind of showing them how
30:50 - to apply
30:51 - it that was the kind of motivation for
30:54 - this yeah this
30:56 - is I love drawing eyes so that that was
30:59 - my thing but it's great start seeing the
31:01 - process cuz you know some we just see
31:03 - final products of things so for me I
31:05 - sort of love I sort of can feel you
31:07 - going through it as I do this so it's
31:09 - great to see the process we also did
31:11 - other types I noticed one other tutorial
31:14 - this was more on the creating images we
31:16 - had another one called you got to love
31:19 - variables so make can say about this um
31:22 - so that was the one that I did for this
31:24 - like mentoring thing so I kind of uh
31:26 - edited it to make it stand alone is like
31:28 - a tutorial um I do this because uh I
31:31 - love variables vector and variables are
31:33 - like my thing I mean also it had like a
31:36 - lot of meaning to me because that was
31:37 - the one concept that I struggled with
31:39 - the most when I was starting scratch was
31:41 - most abstract kind of thing
31:44 - um so I I wanted to kind of share that
31:47 - with scratches you know and I mean all
31:50 - the kind of analogies I lose I I lose I
31:53 - can't words right now all the analogies
31:55 - I use are the ones that have like helped
31:57 - helped me to kind of understand it like
31:58 - how a variable is a is like a box for
32:00 - like shoving information in and then I
32:02 - have like the variables like almost like
32:04 - talking to the and
32:07 - stuff so maybe can you share a little
32:10 - bit now some of your future plans of I
32:13 - know there's still more work on the
32:14 - color device series but other things
32:16 - that you think you might be working on
32:18 - or both on scratch or how this might be
32:20 - influencing other things you're thinking
32:21 - about I have so many plans like I'll
32:23 - wake up in the middle of the night I
32:24 - have to have like my Sketchbook and
32:25 - everything next to me I'm like oh what
32:27 - if I make this thing in scratch so write
32:29 - it down whatever um so I mean some of
32:31 - the main things I'm thinking about you
32:33 - know besides color divide because that's
32:35 - happening I'm continuing
32:36 - that um I I want to do well I want to do
32:41 - kind of projects with like where I'm
32:42 - more experimenting with programming more
32:44 - because I feel like I've kind of settled
32:46 - into a bit of a rhythm with color div ey
32:47 - doing the same kind of things I was like
32:49 - I want to get back into experimenting I
32:50 - want to make like a maybe a story game
32:52 - or something and then other things
32:54 - there's a lot of stuff I want to do like
32:56 - with the community so um they kind of
32:58 - vag ideas one of them I call like
33:00 - doodling with code which is kind of I
33:02 - don't know like an initiative thing um
33:06 - kind of capturing like like celebrating
33:07 - that kind of magic of like first like
33:09 - playing around with something you know
33:11 - just having room to just experiment and
33:13 - have fun I haven't figured out the
33:15 - details yet but it's happening sometime
33:17 - I'll figure it out great well we all
33:20 - look forward to see it because we've
33:21 - been so inspired and excited by seeing
33:23 - the things you've done and I'm sure
33:24 - we'll continue to you know learn more as
33:26 - as you continue to contribute to the
33:28 - community so I want to thank you for all
33:29 - your contributions it's been great
33:31 - having you
33:33 - here thank
33:48 - you so originally with this opening
33:51 - keynote after talking about some of our
33:53 - favorite memories from the past year we
33:55 - were going to move on to looking ahead
33:56 - and and I was going to be joined by some
33:58 - other members of the scratch team
33:59 - because there are lots of new things
34:00 - that we're planning for Scratch for the
34:02 - year and the years ahead uh things about
34:04 - new resources we're coming with a a set
34:07 - of 10 thematic packages of activities to
34:09 - have new Pathways into scratch and we're
34:12 - introducing we're just introducing Now
34:14 - teacher accounts to help you know
34:15 - teachers
34:17 - you
34:20 - glad and we're also starting to work on
34:23 - a next generation of scratch you know
34:24 - right now we're on the second generation
34:26 - scratch 2.
34:27 - which moves scratch online and we're
34:29 - starting to work on a next generation of
34:31 - scratch which will be much more friendly
34:32 - for mobile devices we're also doing more
34:35 - of connecting it to the physical world
34:37 - and we want to share all those things
34:39 - with you and there'll be more time
34:40 - through the conference in the conference
34:42 - there'll be session both sessions and
34:44 - posters about all of those things so
34:47 - it'll be a chance for you to learn more
34:48 - about the teacher accounts and the
34:50 - scratch 3.0 and individual sessions we
34:52 - also have a what's next session on
34:55 - Saturday but we changed plans because
34:58 - instead of looking ahead we did decide
35:00 - it would be right to look back and give
35:02 - a tribute to a person and I get
35:04 - emotional this so I hope you'll bear
35:06 - with me you know to to spend some time
35:09 - talking about person who had a huge huge
35:11 - influence on Scratch and that's sour
35:25 - paper
35:43 - I think you know you know sour would
35:45 - just touched so many people in so many
35:47 - ways around the world through his work
35:50 - and engaging us and rethinking you know
35:53 - the ways that we think about learning
35:55 - and children and Technology
35:57 - um you know through the work he did with
35:58 - the logo programming language the first
36:01 - real programming language for kids which
36:02 - was a direct inspiration for scratch but
36:05 - you know more generally his ideas have
36:08 - sort of sparked many so many of the
36:10 - things that we've been doing with
36:12 - scratch uh so uh it felt it would be
36:15 - good to sort of spend some time
36:17 - reflecting on CMR I was you know so
36:20 - fortunate and so lucky to be able to
36:22 - work closely with seamour for many years
36:23 - to have him as a mentor and as a
36:26 - colleague and friend I know there other
36:28 - people in the audience too work very
36:29 - very closely with Seymour from the early
36:31 - days from the early days when he was
36:33 - first inventing you know with had a team
36:36 - here at MIT working on the original logo
36:38 - which actually was like this year's like
36:40 - the 50th anniversary of logo start is is
36:44 - right now and you know he worked very
36:45 - closely with Cynthia Solomon who you
36:47 - know was there a close collaborator from
36:49 - the very very beginning and did the the
36:53 - the the the project wrote The Paper 20
36:55 - things to do with the computer
37:01 - and I know there are other people here
37:03 - from the original logo effort who both
37:05 - who did work in schools trying out the
37:07 - initial versions you know on these you
37:09 - know big expensive computers with kids
37:11 - to see what was possible uh and then
37:13 - wrote about it and know know Brian
37:15 - Harvey is here and Dan and Molly watt
37:18 - Michael Temple there's whole collection
37:20 - of people who are from the early days
37:21 - Brian Silverman who is one of the se's
37:23 - closest collaborators and led the
37:25 - implementation and develop of logo and
37:27 - spreading it to the world through the
37:29 - work he did logo computer systems
37:30 - incorporated and elsewhere we have some
37:32 - of Seymour's students here like Claud
37:34 - ARA who work closely and continue to
37:37 - spread Seymour's ideas uh actually I'm
37:40 - really happy that Seymour's daughter
37:41 - Artemis is also
37:50 - here so for you know for some of us you
37:53 - know we work so closely with Seymour and
37:56 - uh but I know for many of you you know
37:58 - as many as many of you know seamour had
38:00 - a very bad accident 10 years ago uh it
38:03 - was you know he was hit by a motorbike
38:05 - in in Hanoi and had and never never
38:09 - fully recovered so he hasn't been able
38:11 - to be a full participant in the last 10
38:12 - years so many people here you know
38:16 - really have never directly interacted
38:17 - with Seymour some of you who are new to
38:19 - this might not know much about seamour
38:21 - at all so especially for for those I
38:24 - want to spend some time talking about
38:26 - Seymour's contributions and some of the
38:29 - ways in which Seymour's ideas and his
38:31 - work directly influenced us with scratch
38:34 - and continue to directly influence us
38:36 - with
38:37 - scratch I want to start I was going to
38:39 - show a video because I want you to sort
38:41 - of you know at least hear see where
38:42 - talking is important um this a I'm G to
38:46 - show a video that was made just in this
38:48 - past year was made by The Lego company
38:51 - uh in recognition of the 30th
38:54 - anniversary of the Lego company's
38:56 - collabor ation with the media lab was
38:58 - you know Lego 30 years ago approached
39:01 - Seymour because they saw what he was you
39:03 - know they they were inspired by his
39:04 - ideas about children and learning and
39:06 - they thought there'd be a good
39:07 - connection and indeed there was uh so
39:10 - seamour became seamour the Lego company
39:12 - then became a close collaborator seamour
39:15 - became the first Lego Professor at MIT
39:18 - they endowed a professorship uh and
39:20 - we've worked together in in wonderful
39:22 - ways over the years uh I have the great
39:25 - honor to when see became an ameritus
39:27 - Professor they uh renamed the chair in
39:30 - Seymour's honor the Lego poer Professor
39:33 - uh so actually I'm so very honored now
39:36 - to be the Lego paper Professor which
39:38 - feels so right because in some ways the
39:39 - two biggest influences of my life my PRI
39:41 - are paper and Lego and in some ways some
39:44 - two of the biggest influences on scratch
39:46 - so I thought it' be nice to show this
39:48 - video it's around seven minute video
39:51 - that talks about the 30 years for those
39:52 - who have never bit the media lab it also
39:54 - tells you a little about the
39:55 - introduction to the media lab but more
39:57 - important an introduction to seamour and
40:00 - his ideas and how it influenced the the
40:02 - interaction and collaboration with the
40:04 - Lego company but then I want to talk
40:06 - more about how we built on those ideas
40:08 - in in our work on
40:14 - scratch the great thing about the
40:16 - computer is that it can bring together
40:19 - in one experience the aesthetic the
40:22 - personal the bodily the analytic the
40:25 - mathematical the abstract all these
40:27 - things happen in one combined integrated
40:29 - experience in 1984 there was a
40:32 - television program in the Danish
40:34 - television called talking turtle and I
40:36 - happen to watch that and there was this
40:38 - charismatic person there telling about
40:41 - what children could do with computers
40:44 - that guy was Simo papot what we really
40:47 - have to think about is what produces
40:49 - involvement engagement what grabs the
40:52 - individual what interested me was Simo
40:54 - Papa's view on children and how they can
40:57 - learn through experimentation how they
40:59 - can learn through play education has
41:02 - very little to do with explanation it
41:04 - has to do with engagement with falling
41:06 - in love with the material I was
41:08 - absolutely fascinated and I said go and
41:11 - get contact with uh with him we have to
41:13 - talk to him in 1984 I was already
41:17 - working with Seymour poer helping to
41:18 - connect Lego bricks to the computer so
41:21 - the children could control their Lego
41:22 - constructions from the computer then out
41:24 - of the blue SE more got a letter from
41:27 - Top Executives at The Lego company
41:29 - Seymour whose life's work was children
41:32 - and learning um met keld whose life work
41:39 - was children and the two of them really
41:42 - hit it off we started working together
41:45 - and that's lasted now more than 30
41:55 - years
41:57 - the MIT media lab has 25 different
41:59 - research groups doing all different
42:01 - types of creative Innovative work in my
42:03 - work I combine arts and crafts with
42:05 - electronics to create artistic
42:07 - expressive pieces the city scope
42:08 - platform was developed to allow people
42:10 - to engage with Urban Planet this is the
42:12 - first device ever to make it easier for
42:14 - people to walk the researchers and
42:16 - students here at the meab they're
42:18 - constantly experimenting trying new
42:20 - things building complex structures from
42:22 - simpler Parts they're doing it in a Lego
42:25 - spirit my own group is called the
42:27 - lifelong kindergarten group where we
42:29 - focus on designing new technologies and
42:31 - activities to engage people in Creative
42:33 - Learning
42:35 - experiences a big part of our
42:36 - collaboration with the Lego company is
42:38 - sharing ideas we explore technology and
42:41 - how it can impact the human potential if
42:44 - from our perspective primarily through
42:48 - play the Micky miy is a little circuit
42:50 - board we invented here that lets kids
42:53 - transform anything in their world into a
42:55 - controller for Gam or
42:58 - music one of the things that we always
43:00 - talk about is we want to solve big
43:02 - challenges and big problems and in order
43:04 - to do that you have to be Innovative and
43:06 - I think to be Innovative you need people
43:08 - who are sort of not afraid to try new
43:10 - things make mistakes so that means we
43:12 - need to help children become creative
43:16 - thinkers the goal of these creative
43:19 - workshops is really to give children an
43:21 - opportunity to come up with their own
43:24 - ideas imagine something and then figure
43:26 - out how to design it we should still
43:29 - keep this plate but take this they need
43:31 - to be constantly exploring experimenting
43:34 - work oh my God through natural Discovery
43:38 - by testing things by tinkering by
43:40 - experimenting by creating they're using
43:44 - Lego motors and sensors then if it
43:46 - doesn't work the way they want they
43:48 - start revising it so you have to kind of
43:50 - adjust the motor power so they it
43:53 - actually has enough power to knock the
43:54 - knights off
43:57 - so they're really learning through
43:58 - having a goal having imagining something
44:00 - and then bringing it to life so rather
44:02 - than just thinking of the computer of
44:04 - something that I think what am I
44:06 - supposed to do they start thinking what
44:07 - do I want to do with it they start
44:09 - getting new ideas the children are
44:11 - learning to program they're learning
44:13 - about motion above all they're learning
44:16 - the scientific knowledge is not
44:17 - something separate from their passion
44:20 - for
44:23 - toys after a couple of years of
44:25 - cooperation it crystallized that we
44:27 - really want to make a set for the
44:29 - schools we worked for several years on
44:32 - designing prototypes testing out with
44:34 - children in classrooms when the elevator
44:36 - comes up it'll reverse the direction and
44:39 - call elevator again IED up now get it we
44:42 - could in 1988 Market the first product
44:45 - that had come out of the coroporation
44:47 - which was called Lego TC
44:54 - logo and as elect elonics got smaller
44:57 - and lighter and cheaper we realized we
44:59 - could build the electronics of the
45:01 - computer directly into a Lego brick SEO
45:04 - at a point in time probably maybe in the
45:06 - early '90s started talking about the
45:08 - intelligent break I remember many
45:10 - occasions walking into Kell's office
45:13 - with the latest prototype that we've
45:14 - developed at MIT and you'd see The Gleam
45:17 - in Kell's eyes we would start talking
45:19 - about it but he would immediately want
45:21 - to get his hands on the Prototype we
45:23 - ultimately came up with the final
45:25 - version that The Lego company came out
45:27 - with in 1998 as LEGO
45:36 - Mindstorms one thing that surprised us
45:38 - was that even though we designed it
45:40 - primarily for children initially a lot
45:43 - of the sales were to adults they would
45:44 - build into robots as part of robot
45:46 - competitions they would build piano
45:48 - playing robots they would walk on the
45:50 - piano keyboard and play plant watering
45:52 - robots that would test out when the soil
45:54 - was dry dancing robots would dance to
45:56 - different music it just opened up all
45:59 - sorts of new Creative Design
46:00 - possibilities for children around the
46:03 - world we can't say what children will
46:06 - need in the future adults shouldn't be
46:08 - saying what children ought to learn but
46:10 - I think we can say something about how
46:13 - children should be learning everyone
46:14 - should be able to learn to express their
46:16 - ideas with the computer and that's what
46:18 - coding is all about when you say coding
46:20 - people think of like numbers that are
46:22 - super complicated and stuff that even I
46:25 - don't understand but like scratch is
46:27 - much easier scratch is uh an visual
46:30 - programming language for kids that we
46:32 - developed here these these elements on
46:35 - the screen actually look like Lego
46:36 - blocks and you snap them together and
46:38 - very quickly you can make things start
46:40 - happening programming is like playing
46:42 - with Lego bricks is the same structured
46:44 - and very creative process you know that
46:46 - it can be done it's just a question of
46:48 - how you find the way that is exactly the
46:51 - same as your Lego experience it's
46:53 - constrained in a way that's really easy
46:55 - for kids to to get started but it's
46:57 - open-ended so people can build anything
47:00 - it tells us the legal idea is alive in
47:02 - the physical world but it's very much
47:04 - alive in the digital world and that's
47:06 - highly inspirational for
47:08 - us as I think about the future of our
47:10 - relationship with the Lego company is
47:12 - not just about bringing products to the
47:14 - world but bringing change to the world
47:16 - we're always thinking of Seymour's
47:18 - vision of a world where children can
47:20 - take control of their own learning to
47:22 - use the materials around them to explore
47:25 - world to understand the world in new
47:27 - ways and to understand themselves in new
47:29 - ways we think the approach of the media
47:31 - lab to learning is the way of the future
47:34 - and that's why we take so much
47:36 - inspiration from this partnership
47:38 - because we think it really defines how
47:40 - education but also informal learning
47:42 - should happen in society the fact that
47:45 - we share these values about creativity
47:48 - imagination play and learning belongs
47:50 - together that is something that has kept
47:53 - us together for all these years this is
47:56 - where it leads to a fundamental change
47:58 - in the nature of the
48:16 - learning so I want to spend a few
48:18 - minutes just reflecting on some of the
48:20 - ideas that at least I took away from
48:22 - Seymour and the ways that they've
48:23 - influenced us as we've sort brought
48:25 - worked on Scratch and other projects and
48:29 - as difficult as might be I sort of
48:30 - boiled it down I sort of grabbed six
48:33 - phrases uh that I thought sort of
48:35 - captured some of the spirit of things
48:36 - that I learned from Seymour and so I
48:39 - want to talk a little about those so the
48:41 - first you know Seymour in talking about
48:44 - his approach to learning he used the
48:47 - term
48:48 - constructionism and that grew out of
48:50 - seamour had worked with Jean P the great
48:54 - sort epistem ologist and philosopher and
48:57 - psychologist in Switzerland uh in
49:00 - understand children's learning and P he
49:03 - learned swh learned from P about the way
49:05 - that children actively build up their
49:07 - knowledge structures through their
49:08 - interactions in the world and what seem
49:11 - we layered on top of that was that one
49:13 - of the best ways for help kids to build
49:15 - up that knowledge was to engage them in
49:17 - building things in the world and see
49:19 - still building in the world in a very
49:21 - broad way uh it wasn't just building
49:23 - with Lego bricks although that's one way
49:25 - it was also building sand castles on the
49:28 - beach or building animations on the
49:30 - screen with logo or with scratch or
49:32 - building and creating a story or a poem
49:36 - you know it was all about sort of taking
49:37 - your ideas and getting your ideas out to
49:39 - the world where they could be shared
49:40 - with others and I think that was sort of
49:42 - the core of things that sour was talking
49:44 - about he sometimes would contrast
49:47 - constructionism with what he termed was
49:49 - too common in the world with
49:51 - instructionism people thinking that the
49:54 - way to help people learn was to have
49:56 - better instruction and of course
49:58 - instruction can be a worthwhile thing
50:00 - but he said that's not the way that
50:01 - we're going to transform young people's
50:03 - lives is by just coming with better ways
50:06 - of instructing better ways of delivering
50:08 - information better ways of delivering
50:10 - instruction instead we have to change it
50:13 - and create create situations where
50:15 - children can design create Express
50:18 - themselves and that's really what he did
50:20 - through his life uh in many ways the
50:22 - current maker movement very much grows
50:25 - out of Seymour's ideas about learning
50:27 - through making creating building and you
50:30 - really should see Seymour as the patron
50:31 - saint of the of the maker movement um
50:35 - and I do think similar with scratch had
50:37 - a big influence there's with all the
50:39 - work going on in the world these days
50:40 - around coding a lot of it really isn't
50:43 - about making things you see a lot of
50:46 - things around coding where it's learning
50:47 - certain Concepts uh or solving a certain
50:52 - puzzle and again there's some value to
50:54 - that but I think you know SE word always
50:56 - argued that the way for people to really
50:58 - become engaged with something and to
51:00 - engage with the ideas in a deep way is
51:02 - to be doing it while creating a project
51:05 - so in scratch the project is the core
51:07 - unit in scratch it's because we want
51:10 - people to create things and share things
51:12 - with others that sort of comes right out
51:14 - of Seymour's
51:16 - ideas the second seamour idea that I
51:19 - talked that thought of was he talked
51:21 - about objects to think with and he would
51:25 - emphasize that the objects in a child's
51:27 - world make a big have a big influence on
51:30 - the way they make sense of the world uh
51:32 - you know the fact that we're born with
51:34 - two hands helps us in understanding
51:36 - Symmetry and pairs so the things that we
51:39 - have around US influence how we think
51:41 - about things uh one reason he think he
51:44 - he liked the collaboration with the Lego
51:45 - company was it was an object in child in
51:48 - children's world that could help them in
51:50 - understanding the world and building in
51:51 - the world in seamore's work with logo he
51:54 - really you know took that seriously and
51:57 - building on his own personal
51:59 - experiences uh in the forward to Sour's
52:02 - classic book
52:03 - Mindstorms uh he talks about his own
52:06 - childhood experience with gears the
52:08 - forward is called Gears of my childhood
52:10 - and he talks about the way that he GRE
52:12 - actually he grew up in South Africa like
52:14 - Tyran and uh uh and and was oftentimes
52:19 - in the bush with his father who was an
52:21 - entomologist and loved car parts and
52:24 - truck parts and became fascinated with
52:26 - gears and looking back he said there was
52:28 - so so much of mathematics that you
52:30 - learned from playing with
52:32 - gears but another important part there
52:35 - is not just learning the mathematical
52:37 - Concepts which he learned from Gears
52:39 - which he did but importantly in that
52:41 - forward seamour says and he italicized
52:45 - this he said I fell in love with the
52:47 - gears and I think seamour recognize it
52:50 - wasn't that the best objects to think
52:52 - with are also objects you can relate to
52:54 - and objects you can engage with and
52:57 - objects you can care about so he fell in
52:59 - love with the gears and that's what made
53:01 - the gears so special and why he was able
53:03 - to learn those mathematical ideas was
53:05 - because he fell in love with the gears
53:07 - and I think he tried to do similar
53:08 - things when he invented logo along with
53:11 - you know others here you know a central
53:14 - object in logo was the turtle and so you
53:18 - you know with logo you give commands to
53:20 - the turtle and you have the turtle you
53:21 - tell to go forward and it moves forward
53:23 - and to turn and it turns so you can
53:25 - relate to the turtle as an object like
53:27 - your own body so you draw on your own
53:29 - personal experience with your body and
53:30 - you learn programming not some abstract
53:33 - way of doing calculations but by you
53:35 - know interacting with an object an
53:37 - object you could care about the turtle U
53:40 - I think we've also tried to keep that in
53:42 - mind in all of our work you know when we
53:44 - develop scratch scratch is you know the
53:46 - Sprite of scratch is sort of the central
53:48 - object and we made scratch we might call
53:51 - very Sprite Centric uh in fact there not
53:54 - even an easy way to sort of be the
53:56 - conductor of saying I want all of this
53:58 - is what all the different objects should
53:59 - do in scratch you sort of go inside the
54:02 - object and inside all the programming
54:04 - scratch say what should this Sprite do
54:05 - what should this object do so you can
54:07 - imagine yourself as a Sprite and you
54:09 - give the commands for what you want the
54:10 - Sprite to do so again very much we want
54:13 - to turn that into objects to think with
54:15 - and objects to care about and objects to
54:17 - engage
54:21 - with seamer also chose the objects like
54:24 - the turtle in order to help highlight
54:26 - what he would call powerful
54:29 - ideas uh because it wasn't just a matter
54:32 - of becoming engaged with these objects
54:33 - but for learning deep and important
54:35 - ideas from your engagement with these
54:37 - objects in fact the subtitle to seamor
54:40 - book Mindstorms was children computers
54:44 - and powerful ideas and actually 20 years
54:47 - after the publication of mindss it came
54:49 - out in 1980 in 2000 he wrote a paper uh
54:54 - where he lamented the fact that people
54:56 - didn't pay enough attention to that
54:57 - third phrase he said people pay
54:59 - attention to children and computers more
55:01 - children are using computers now but
55:03 - it's usually missing the powerful ideas
55:06 - and for seamour the powerful ideas were
55:07 - always Central uh and when seamour
55:10 - talked about powerful ideas he was you
55:12 - know talking about you know ideas that
55:15 - can you know cut across different
55:16 - disciplines it wasn't a idea that could
55:18 - just help you do one thing but ideas
55:20 - that could help you in many different
55:22 - things ideas that could help you learn
55:24 - other things
55:25 - ideas that could help you learn about
55:26 - learning itself so he was always looking
55:29 - to see how can we sort of engage people
55:32 - with a core set of powerful ideas that
55:34 - can help them in all of their learning
55:36 - so like he would often give example of a
55:39 - scientific concept like feedback which
55:41 - used to be you studied only at the
55:43 - University level of places like MIT but
55:46 - he said new technologies could let
55:47 - children start playing with this idea uh
55:51 - and it was an idea that cuts across it's
55:53 - not just an idea that you should think
55:54 - about in an engineering curriculum at
55:56 - MIT but it's used in your everyday life
55:59 - feedback certainly it is a way of
56:02 - understanding how your you know
56:03 - thermostat works in the heating system
56:05 - when it gets colder it turns on the heat
56:07 - when it gets warmer it turns off the
56:08 - heat that's a type of feedback but also
56:11 - The Way We Walk is feedback if you start
56:14 - to lean one way your body adjusts the
56:16 - other way uh the way things inside of
56:19 - our body work is about feedback systems
56:21 - uh that when something starts to get out
56:23 - of whack one way the body reinforces an
56:25 - alternate way to bring it back in line
56:28 - so this idea of feedback with he saw is
56:30 - important and I think one reason he was
56:32 - so excited when we connected the logo
56:34 - programming language to Lego it gave
56:36 - more ways to use the sensors of Lego to
56:38 - explore that type of powerful idea so
56:41 - see always look at those powerful ideas
56:43 - and again I think in scratch we've tried
56:45 - to also do that like inheriting from
56:48 - logo a core idea was the modularity so
56:50 - it's not just a matter of writing a
56:52 - program to get something done but giving
56:54 - you new strategies for thinking
56:56 - strategies for solving problems
56:57 - strategies for Designing projects to be
57:00 - able to break down complex things into
57:01 - simpler parts to take small building
57:03 - blocks and make more complex things or
57:06 - the idea of debugging is a powerful idea
57:10 - uh actually I thought it was lovely when
57:11 - Tyran was talking about her experience
57:13 - with debugging and which she used
57:15 - scratch that it's okay that things go
57:17 - wrong and things go wrong and then you
57:19 - figure out and you play around with it
57:20 - to see how to fix it and that's part of
57:22 - the process so that idea of debugging
57:24 - was also something that I think seamour
57:26 - saw as a powerful idea and that we tried
57:28 - to highlight in scratch and to give
57:30 - people ways that they can you know play
57:33 - around experiment it's okay for things
57:35 - to go wrong uh We've but then to try to
57:38 - figure out how could I make changes in
57:40 - that and that debugging the pro the
57:43 - project is also a way of debugging your
57:44 - own thinking so it's a way to think
57:46 - about your own thinking which is
57:48 - something that se was always looking to
57:51 - support a fourth uh idea
57:55 - was related to sambas schools so s
57:58 - seamour did not invent sambus schools
58:00 - but he was very influenced by sambus
58:02 - schools in one of the later chapters in
58:05 - Mindstorms sour talks about going to
58:08 - Brazil and observing the samba schools
58:11 - and I think this was very this chapter
58:13 - was important because especially when
58:14 - seamour was writing Mindstorms most
58:16 - people thought of computers in a very
58:18 - individual way it was before the
58:20 - internet and in fact it was called the
58:22 - personal computer it's your personal
58:23 - machine you act on the machine you do
58:25 - things and that's the way most people
58:27 - thought about the computers that were
58:29 - entering entering lives but seem more
58:32 - saw the computer to be part of a broader
58:35 - culture and that learning was always
58:37 - situated within a broader culture and he
58:39 - points the example of the sambus schools
58:41 - where they're planning the different
58:42 - dances for the festival you know in in
58:45 - Rio and in other cities in Brazil and he
58:48 - talked about that it wasn't just you
58:50 - come and you take a class to learn
58:51 - something how to make a float or how to
58:53 - do a dance but is the community came
58:55 - together and everybody was learning with
58:56 - and from one another so as a way to
58:58 - bring people together not just with an
59:01 - instructor delivering information or
59:03 - instruction to a learner but a whole
59:05 - Community coming together learning with
59:07 - and from one another and seamour had the
59:09 - vision that that's what the how computer
59:12 - should enter the world as well and he
59:14 - was ahead of his time because the
59:15 - technology wasn't quite there yet the
59:17 - tech the internet certainly has helped
59:19 - support that over time and had a deep
59:22 - influences on us as we worked on scratch
59:24 - the scratch online community we see it
59:27 - as a type of somus school of bringing
59:29 - together kids from around the world and
59:31 - adults too who will share not just
59:33 - projects but share ideas with each other
59:35 - mentoring each other doing tutorials the
59:37 - way that Tyran was talking about so this
59:39 - idea of learning with and from one
59:40 - another is a key part of what seamour
59:42 - was talking about seamour loved the
59:45 - phrase hard fun he said he he he took it
59:48 - from what he heard from kids when kids
59:50 - were using logo he said they would often
59:53 - say well it's hard but it's fun
59:55 - um and that resonated with seamour
59:57 - because seamour said too often people
60:00 - think that kids want things easy and he
60:01 - said that's wrong kids are willing to do
60:03 - things that are hard as long as it's
60:05 - things they care about and he said it's
60:08 - you know when kids lose interest in
60:09 - school it's not because it's too hard
60:11 - it's because they find it boring he said
60:13 - what you need to do is to have things
60:15 - that you know that they are deeply
60:17 - engaged with and they're willing to
60:18 - tackle difficult challenges and I think
60:21 - he would be skeptical right now there is
60:23 - more of an interest in the education
60:25 - world of bringing some sort of fun into
60:27 - the learning process but sometimes it's
60:29 - by just sprinkling sugar on top that if
60:31 - you do something you can get a reward
60:33 - and that's not at all what Seymour meant
60:34 - by hard fund he meant something where
60:36 - the fund came from the deep engagement
60:39 - with the thing you were creating with
60:40 - the ideas you're exploring the ideas
60:42 - that you were grappling with and playing
60:44 - playing with and again this side that we
60:47 - always try to do both in scratch and the
60:48 - way we introduce scratch is to connect
60:51 - to both interests and ideas to make sure
60:54 - that we connect to Young people's
60:55 - interests to connect to where they are
60:58 - with their interest and what they're
60:59 - interested in doing but also connect
61:00 - with the powerful ideas so to always
61:03 - make sure and we see that kids are
61:04 - willing to to work hard persist in the
61:07 - face of challenges and difficulties if
61:09 - they're working on things they care
61:11 - about and ideas that they care
61:13 - about the final phrase epistemological
61:17 - pluralism it's a mouthful I couldn't
61:19 - even fit it on one line on the
61:21 - slide so and this is a phrase that
61:24 - Seymour developed uh with his colleague
61:27 - Sher turkle another professor here at
61:29 - MIT and a longtime collaborator with
61:32 - Seymour and it very much connects with
61:35 - the theme of this conference many paths
61:37 - many styles what they meant by
61:39 - epistemological pluralism is multiple
61:42 - ways of knowing multiple ways of
61:45 - understanding the world multiple ways of
61:47 - understanding yourself and I think
61:49 - Seymour was always concerned that there
61:52 - was too much of uniformity in the world
61:54 - that too often schools privileged
61:57 - certain ways of knowing and for people
62:00 - who are very good at that way of knowing
62:02 - they succeeded at school and were happy
62:03 - at school but it left aside so many
62:06 - others and SE was always saying it
62:08 - doesn't have to be that way there's not
62:09 - just that one way of knowing U as an
62:12 - example you often talk about two forms
62:14 - of Engagement in the paper he wrote with
62:16 - Sher called epistemological pluralism
62:18 - they talk about planning and tinkering
62:22 - where planning is an approach where you
62:24 - come up with a problem you sort of
62:26 - analyze the problem you come up with the
62:29 - solution you try it out and you assess
62:32 - it with tinkering you see something
62:35 - you're not quite sure how it's going to
62:36 - work you try something out doesn't quite
62:38 - work you try to debug it you try
62:39 - something else and you keep on iterating
62:42 - to try to come with something better and
62:44 - SE where says too much of school and
62:46 - Society privileges planning and planning
62:48 - is useful this is not a put down of
62:50 - planning it's useful to do planning but
62:53 - he said in some situ situations and for
62:55 - some people tinkering is a much better
62:57 - approach so this idea of valuing many
63:01 - paths and many styles was an important
63:03 - part and again in developing scratch
63:05 - that was important for us we didn't want
63:07 - scratch to be something just for kids
63:09 - who already would have gotten involved
63:11 - in coding and programming we want to
63:13 - reach out to everybody from all
63:14 - different interests all different styles
63:16 - all different backgrounds to have many
63:18 - different Pathways so we try to set up
63:21 - the way scratches and the type of
63:22 - materials we develop around it to have
63:24 - multiple Pathways into scratch to make
63:27 - sure that everybody especially those who
63:30 - normally wouldn't have been engaged in
63:32 - these types of activities in the past
63:33 - that everyone feels comfortable engaging
63:35 - and excited about engaging in these
63:39 - ideas these ideas sort of again I
63:42 - mentioned Mindstorm which is a classic
63:44 - book I mean if there's one thing to
63:46 - remember from this if you haven't read
63:47 - Mindstorms I really encourage you to go
63:50 - out and read Mindstorms It Was Written
63:52 - In 1980 36 years ago you have to
63:55 - recognize some things feel a lot out of
63:56 - dat writing about computers in 1980 it's
63:59 - hard to predict exactly what the world
64:00 - is going to be like in
64:02 - 2016 but for me what's more striking is
64:05 - how much is still so much re so relevant
64:09 - to today and how much of what seamour
64:11 - writes about with learning in children
64:13 - is so true to to the issues of today so
64:17 - although so sadly Seymour is no longer
64:20 - with us I think you know the challenge
64:21 - for all of us is to make sure that
64:23 - Seymour Spirit stays alive and that what
64:27 - we do at this conference and Beyond is
64:29 - one of the ways that we can contribute
64:30 - to make sure that se's ideas and see
64:32 - with Spirit stay alive and healthy and
64:34 - grow and spread around the world thank
64:53 - you
64:54 - with that I'm going to pass on to saskia
64:57 - Leed who many of you met as the
64:58 - organizer who's been organizing the
65:00 - conference and she'll talk about some of
