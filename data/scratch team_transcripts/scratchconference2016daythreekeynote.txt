00:01 - good morning
00:02 - everyone everyone have a good day
00:09 - yesterday well the way I knew it was a
00:12 - good day yesterday is I woke up early
00:14 - this morning and I started reading
00:16 - through the tweets from yesterday and I
00:18 - kept on thinking oh I wish I had seen
00:19 - that oh I wish I had seen that I wish I
00:21 - had seen that and I did that over and
00:23 - over so for me that was an indication of
00:25 - that there's a lot of good things
00:26 - happening and uh and I love the things I
00:28 - saw but I saw there a lot of other great
00:30 - things going on as well and I'll
00:32 - continue to today through today as well
00:35 - uh so it's great to have you here for
00:37 - the last day of the conference and we'll
00:40 - be kicking off with another great
00:41 - keynote session again on the theme of
00:44 - many pasme styles we'll have a special
00:47 - pan panel presentation about creative
00:50 - Computing for all um I want to start by
00:52 - introducing the facilitator and
00:54 - moderator of the panel Karen Brennan of
00:56 - the panel Karen Brennan actually Karen
01:00 - came to the media lab in the fall of
01:02 - 2007 just a couple months after we had
01:05 - launched the scratch software and
01:08 - scratch was already getting out to the
01:09 - world and we were already starting to
01:11 - talk about organizing the first scratch
01:14 - conference and even though Karen was the
01:16 - newest member of the team it quickly
01:18 - became apparent that she was the best
01:19 - person to organize the conference both
01:22 - because of her great organizational
01:23 - skills but also she was so perceptive of
01:26 - so many aspects of of scratch from the
01:29 - Cod in to the community from the kids to
01:31 - the teachers from the technology to the
01:34 - pedagogy so Karen took the lead on the
01:37 - organizing the scratch conference in
01:39 - 2008 and again in 2010 and in 2012 so a
01:42 - lot of the things you've been
01:43 - experiencing over the last few days are
01:45 - building on that framework that Karen
01:47 - helped establish with that first scratch
01:49 - conference and at that first scratch
01:51 - conference I remember one of the best
01:53 - sessions was early in the conference we
01:55 - had a panel of some scratches from
01:57 - around the world and everyone loves
01:59 - seeing the scratch so it was great and
02:01 - then at the end a lot of people said we
02:03 - have to have lots more scratchers at the
02:04 - next conference and we thought about
02:07 - that because of course we love seeing
02:08 - scratchers but Karen said well I'm not
02:10 - sure that's what the conference should
02:12 - be about this conference is mostly about
02:14 - how we can support people in learning
02:16 - scratch but we need something else to
02:18 - really pull scratches together and that
02:20 - led to the birth of scratch day uh and
02:23 - came up with the idea of as much as we
02:25 - love the online community it's great to
02:26 - bring scratches together physically and
02:30 - Karen not only came with the idea but
02:33 - made the first website uh and put up the
02:35 - map where people started adding their
02:37 - own scratch days and every year there
02:38 - have been more and more it's been
02:40 - wonderful to see how scratch day has
02:42 - grown around the world and if if the
02:45 - conference and scratch day weren't
02:46 - enough Karen I think was also frustrated
02:48 - that seeing who it was that was using
02:51 - scratch as it got out in the beginning
02:53 - and people were finding out about it
02:54 - through their parents their relatives it
02:57 - wasn't really reaching as broadly and
02:58 - diversely as as we would like and Karen
03:01 - saw the importance of getting into
03:02 - schools and that's what led her to get
03:04 - started with scratch Ed Community uh and
03:07 - scratched teacher meetups that she
03:10 - started here and has continued as she
03:12 - graduated from here moved on to Harvard
03:15 - Graduate School of Education where she's
03:17 - now a professor there has continued work
03:20 - on these sorts of ideas putting out the
03:22 - creative Computing curriculum gu many of
03:24 - you particip have used that and have
03:26 - participated in the creative Computing
03:28 - online workshop and she to build on
03:30 - those ideas and with today's session on
03:32 - Creative competing for all we'll
03:34 - continue to build on those ideas and go
03:35 - even further so with that I'd like to
03:37 - welcome and hope everyone will join me
03:39 - in thanking Karen
03:41 - [Applause]
03:48 - Brennan thank you for that
03:51 - embarrassingly long but embarrassingly
03:54 - kind introduction Mitch I actually want
03:57 - to start with two notes of thanks one
03:59 - note of thanks to you Mitch this is and
04:03 - I say this uh unrepentantly this is my
04:05 - favorite Community the scratch
04:07 - conference is
04:10 - [Music]
04:13 - phenomenal so it's it's an honor to have
04:16 - been invited to facilitate a keynote
04:17 - today the second note of thanks I want
04:19 - to say a special thank you to saskia to
04:22 - abisola to the scratch team I have
04:24 - special insight into how hard this is to
04:27 - do uh so a huge thank you you to you in
04:30 - making it possible and
04:37 - amazing and I I know that you will sleep
04:40 - very soundly tonight so I hope you enjoy
04:42 - that as well so let's Dive Right In so
04:44 - the topic for today the theme is this
04:47 - big idea of for all and so we're going
04:50 - to sort of press into this lean into
04:52 - this today and so I just want to sort of
04:54 - set it up in this cultural moment so
04:57 - huge announcement here in the United
04:59 - States at the beginning of the year our
05:01 - president President Barack Obama
05:04 - yes yes yes uh announces that CS should
05:10 - be something for all Learners this
05:12 - amazing and I know that we're behind the
05:14 - United States is a little behind other
05:15 - countries I know some of you are
05:17 - thinking like we did that we did that
05:19 - before you did so this is a really
05:21 - powerful idea and I got really obsessed
05:23 - with this idea of computing for all I
05:25 - mean you can quibble over its computer
05:26 - science it's computational thinking I
05:28 - think of Yas Meine CFI and computational
05:31 - participation whatever you want to call
05:32 - it we could have a whole set of
05:34 - conversations around that what we're
05:36 - going to really focus on today is this
05:38 - idea of for all and why am I so obsessed
05:42 - with this idea for all well partly I
05:44 - think it's really easy to say that when
05:47 - we're designing whether we're designing
05:49 - tools or learning experiences we say
05:51 - like this is for everyone but what tends
05:54 - to happen at least it's been in my
05:55 - experience is that it ends up being
05:57 - bracket in some ways some people are
06:00 - included some people are excluded and I
06:03 - wanted to sort of use this keynote not
06:05 - as an opportunity for a lecture or just
06:07 - hearing us talk about it but as a sort
06:09 - of a moment of collective reflection and
06:11 - thinking about are we using that
06:13 - signifier for all and when we're using
06:16 - it what do we mean by it and I wanted to
06:19 - share with you three people who have
06:21 - significantly Advanced my own thinking
06:23 - about what I think about when I think
06:25 - about all Merill Nick and Rihanna and
06:29 - I'm going to ask them to start us off by
06:32 - just introducing themselves a bit sure
06:34 - hello everyone scratch and out there on
06:37 - the internet uh my name is Marl Alper
06:39 - and I'm an assistant professor in the
06:41 - communication studies department at nor
06:43 - Eastern University here in Boston on the
06:45 - other side of the river uh the work that
06:48 - I do uh mainly centers on young people
06:50 - with disabilities and their use of
06:53 - technology and informal spaces my
06:55 - background before I entered Academia was
06:58 - as a Creator research strategist in the
07:00 - children's media industry more broadly
07:02 - so Sesame Workshop Disney Nickelodeon um
07:05 - and so that influences my sort of
07:07 - relationship between researching
07:09 - products that are out there but also how
07:11 - that can inform
07:12 - development great uh good morning
07:14 - everyone uh my name is Nick giobi and
07:17 - I'm a second generation special
07:19 - education teacher my father was a music
07:22 - therapist and my mother was a special
07:23 - education teacher before they both
07:25 - became special education professors so I
07:27 - feel like I've grown up around this work
07:30 - uh I'm entering my 11th year as a
07:32 - special education teacher in the Chicago
07:34 - public schools at Augustus H Burley
07:36 - School in the lake view neighborhood
07:39 - where I've worked with students in first
07:40 - through sixth grade uh I'm the current
07:43 - Chicago Public Schools technology
07:44 - innovator of the year and I think that's
07:47 - due in part that I'm a huge proponent of
07:49 - constructionism particularly for
07:51 - Learners with disabilities I first
07:53 - learned about constructionism through
07:54 - Karen while on sabatical at the Harvard
07:57 - grad school of Ed in 2014 and I also had
08:00 - the opportunity to intern here at llk
08:03 - with Rick Rose uh Ro who is actually
08:05 - doing a session right after this so if
08:07 - you haven't selected one I'd highly
08:09 - recommend
08:10 - [Music]
08:12 - it good morning everyone my name is ran
08:14 - GES um at present I'm a digital learning
08:17 - specialist in the Boston public schools
08:19 - and in my role I support teachers with
08:21 - technology integration um but I also
08:24 - bring a personal and a deeply personal
08:27 - perspective of disability I myself heart
08:29 - of hearing today I'm using an
08:30 - interpreter and captioning um I also
08:33 - have a younger brother who has Down
08:35 - syndrome and my mom has been a special
08:37 - teacher for over 30 years so I feel like
08:39 - I understand on multiple levels it
08:41 - doesn't explicitly have to be about
08:43 - disability but disability pervades our
08:45 - life and so I'll be bringing that
08:47 - perspective to today's conversation
08:50 - thank you so much I'm so thrilled that
08:51 - all three of you are here so our first
08:54 - question is what does for all mean to
08:56 - you and I'm going to come I'm going to
08:57 - come back to the three of you I wanted
08:59 - to sort of share an activity that um
09:03 - Willamina perene who works with me at
09:05 - the Ed school we we tweeted this last
09:07 - week from the scratched team and just
09:09 - said like what does for all if we think
09:12 - about Computing for all mean to you and
09:14 - I thought we could make this a little
09:15 - participatory and so we let's do like
09:17 - two minutes of turn and talk so with
09:19 - your neighbor what does for all mean to
09:22 - you I will this is a trick I learned at
09:24 - the edge School rather than try and like
09:26 - I'll cue you when the two minutes are up
09:28 - by just putting my hand up okay so when
09:30 - you see my hand go up we'll come back
09:31 - together so 2 minutes just with your
09:32 - neighbor what do you think about when
09:34 - you're thinking about for all
09:54 - [Applause]
10:28 - think okay
10:59 - than
11:31 - she
12:00 - he ping for
12:22 - [Music]
12:40 - thank you I'm amazed how that is so
12:43 - orderly every
12:44 - time so I wanted to share some of the
12:48 - sort of major thematic clusters that
12:50 - emerged when we took a look at all of
12:51 - the tweets we wanted to just we could
12:52 - have just filled an hour showing all of
12:54 - the tweets that people posted so I
12:56 - encourage you to to check it out but
12:58 - some of the like the major themes that
13:00 - emerged when people thought about all
13:02 - they were thinking about for all
13:04 - abilities for all ages for all
13:07 - disciplines for all genders for all
13:10 - interests for all languages for all
13:13 - Races and ethnicities for all
13:15 - socioeconomic statuses and so with that
13:18 - as the backdrop I then wanted to turn it
13:21 - over to our fabulous panelist what are
13:23 - you thinking about when you're thinking
13:25 - about for all and we'll start with
13:27 - Merill yeah so when I took a look at
13:29 - that list I I saw more of the what I saw
13:33 - some discrete categories and the way I
13:36 - tend to think about this is a little bit
13:37 - more about processes about the why
13:39 - what's behind that concept of for all
13:42 - and so I think about for all as having
13:44 - to do with something social there's
13:46 - something political about it and there's
13:48 - something cultural about it um so
13:50 - something social about it and that
13:52 - inherently has to do with stratification
13:55 - so it has to do with when you mix a
13:57 - couple of those different categories
14:00 - uh or you consider them separately
14:01 - you're going to be creating ingroups and
14:03 - outgroups and so in what ways those get
14:06 - get preferred into different
14:07 - institutions uh there's a political
14:10 - component to it in that who gets to set
14:12 - the terms of their own participation who
14:15 - is involved in the conversations
14:17 - themselves and setting up panels on
14:19 - participation who participates on the
14:21 - panels about participation there's a
14:23 - political component to for all um and
14:25 - then a cultural component um and
14:27 - thinking about accessibility is
14:29 - something that isn't just technical that
14:31 - isn't just about does it work or not
14:32 - work but something cultural um and to
14:35 - just pull it back more you know
14:36 - specifically to something like scratch
14:38 - um as a platform thinking about in what
14:41 - ways uh is cultural participation valued
14:45 - um as something accessible on scratch
14:47 - you think about you know there's the
14:48 - flash platform Flash in many ways has
14:51 - many accessibility issues um and what
14:54 - kinds of content is being created on
14:56 - something like that is that is
14:57 - accessible to all in the scratch
14:59 - community so for all I think of it as
15:01 - having a sort of cultural social and
15:03 - political
15:04 - component great so when I think about
15:07 - for all as a career special education
15:10 - teacher I'm always a bit curious about
15:13 - what for all really means have my
15:16 - students been thought about in that
15:18 - process and uh on Thursday I was
15:21 - inspired by mitches kote to go back and
15:24 - reread uh Gears of my childhood and
15:27 - there was a quote uh from Seymour paper
15:29 - in there that's what you can learn and
15:31 - how you learn depends on the models
15:33 - available to you and so that made me
15:36 - think a lot about a fifth grade student
15:38 - that I worked with last year uh he had
15:41 - to do a science project and what he
15:43 - decided to do it was on the human body
15:46 - he decided to make a scratch game called
15:48 - immune man and immune man was a white
15:50 - blood cell that was designed sort of
15:52 - like Pac-Man and he had a maze that was
15:54 - the human body and so immune man would
15:56 - Chomp Chom Chomp all the bacteria and it
15:58 - was a great visual way to show what the
16:00 - white blood cells do and I was really
16:03 - Amazed by it and he had the aptitude to
16:04 - do it on his own but I thought about
16:07 - what are the models for him in his life
16:09 - he has a lot of advantages he has a
16:11 - parent who has a computer science
16:13 - background and works in computers uh he
16:16 - goes regularly to coding camps uh so for
16:20 - this uh particular example this project
16:24 - was great and it was hard fun for him
16:27 - but when I look at my students who who
16:29 - don't have those models it wouldn't be
16:31 - hard fun it would be really challenging
16:33 - for them so my call uh to all of you is
16:37 - when thinking about computer science for
16:39 - all
16:41 - uh it actually goes back to what Nicole
16:44 - said yesterday talking about those
16:45 - overlapping opportunities so if we do
16:48 - someday have scratch in McDonald's for
16:51 - students to play with informally I want
16:53 - us to think hard about developing those
16:55 - Technologies so that they include for
16:57 - all as a component
16:59 - because for me computer science for all
17:01 - is both formal and informal
17:05 - education for me when I think about for
17:07 - all I think about um empathy and design
17:11 - so there's a lot of conversations about
17:14 - what exactly does good design look like
17:17 - and I like to ask people that question
17:19 - so for me in my own experience um
17:23 - thinking about planning planning for
17:25 - that variability a huge part of um my
17:29 - Foundation is Universal Design for
17:31 - Learning and so I think a lot about like
17:34 - we're thinking about designing learning
17:35 - experiences we thinking about designing
17:38 - Technologies we have to think about who
17:41 - we're including in that process um
17:44 - people of all abilities everything that
17:46 - was listed up on the
17:48 - screen and we also have to think about
17:50 - empathy because empathy is a huge
17:52 - component there's a lot of talk about
17:54 - social emotional learning and we cannot
17:57 - dismiss the value of empathy and design
18:00 - and I really encourage you anytime you
18:02 - think about planning to consider how you
18:05 - can involve people with disabilities in
18:07 - the process people who have atypical and
18:12 - variable personalities because people
18:15 - with disabilities can be innovators um
18:18 - we need them to be a part of it there
18:20 - are ton of articles that are coming out
18:21 - online there's one on Fast Company
18:23 - design about Microsoft working with all
18:26 - these people with disabilities they've
18:27 - been doing this for years
18:29 - and there's also um different pieces of
18:32 - code that are shown you what it's like
18:35 - for a dyslexic learner when they're
18:37 - navigating a website and when we think
18:39 - about designing websites um just watch
18:41 - someone who's blind tell you how they
18:43 - navigate a website so think about who's
18:46 - involved in this process not afterwards
18:49 - but from the
18:51 - beginning so that's sort of a 10,000
18:53 - foot view of how you're thinking about
18:54 - for all I asked our panelists um to dig
18:58 - in a bit like what does that look like
19:01 - on the daytoday for you in your work and
19:04 - wanted to illustrate it with some
19:05 - visuals so I'm GNA we're going to pass
19:08 - the Baton down the line so it starts
19:10 - with Merill sure uh so I should take a
19:13 - like one step back before getting into
19:15 - the the visuals and that um so some of
19:18 - the work that I've published takes a a
19:19 - way broader view about Youth and
19:21 - disabilities so I published uh through
19:23 - the MacArthur Foundation a report it's
19:25 - freely available online both in print
19:28 - through it press but also as a free PDF
19:30 - on digital youth with disabilities and
19:32 - thinking about what do we know about
19:34 - outside of just School purely or
19:36 - Rehabilitation settings how are young
19:38 - people with disabilities hanging out
19:39 - messing around geeking out with
19:41 - technology what do we know um and then I
19:43 - have a book coming out at the beginning
19:44 - of next year uh called giving voice
19:47 - mobile communication disability and
19:49 - inequality also through MIT press that
19:51 - takes a kind of sociological view of
19:54 - what's going on in family settings
19:55 - around uh disability and technology and
19:58 - what are the other kind of resources
19:59 - that people draw upon um because it
20:02 - technology doesn't automatically fix you
20:05 - all of society's ills nor does it repair
20:07 - some idea of disability as meaning that
20:09 - something is broken in a person um not
20:12 - at all there's this we need to sort of
20:14 - critically look at how do people uh make
20:16 - things meaningful in their lives um in
20:19 - relation to disability but also in
20:21 - relation to their class background their
20:23 - ethnic background their you know
20:25 - immigration background and whatnot um
20:27 - but another thing that I um I've been
20:29 - wonderful to take part in the
20:31 - interaction design and children
20:33 - community which kind of overlaps in
20:34 - certain ways with the scratch community
20:36 - and uh a little bit back uh a um two
20:39 - colleagues um JP orad uh who's at
20:42 - University of Iowa and shulie glutes
20:44 - who's in Israel um we started thinking
20:47 - about uh the wonderful framework that
20:50 - Mitch and and folks are at MIT had laid
20:53 - out uh in thinking about designing
20:56 - spaces like scratch computational cre
20:58 - tools as having everybody knows low
21:02 - floors wide walls High ceilings right so
21:07 - H thank you you bring me so uh we had
21:11 - just run a workshop uh at the
21:13 - interaction design for children
21:14 - conference and thinking about young
21:16 - people with disabilities and thought
21:19 - about a little twist on it if we thought
21:21 - really concretely about different
21:22 - research we'd been doing around young
21:24 - people on the autism spectrum young
21:26 - people with visual impairments um Young
21:28 - people with uh Speech disorders in in
21:31 - what ways was that model great but it
21:34 - could be better and so we wrote an
21:37 - article that was in ACM interactions
21:40 - that kind of laid out a kind of proposal
21:42 - for what these tools to think of might
21:45 - look like and so to start off one of
21:49 - those was thinking about not just low
21:51 - floors but ones with ramps and I mean
21:54 - that in both very concrete ways and
21:56 - metaphorical ways so also so you have to
21:59 - get into the building if you're running
22:00 - a scratch Workshop uh that's a that's a
22:03 - necessity that's not a a nice to have
22:04 - that's a necessity but also Ram says
22:07 - invitations so what kind of invitations
22:10 - do different kinds of Learners need to
22:12 - approach the floor in the first place um
22:15 - and I say invitations such as other
22:18 - people in stem Fields other people with
22:20 - cs backgrounds who are leading workshops
22:22 - with disabilities themselves um as sort
22:25 - of mentors as people to deliver explicit
22:28 - invitations to take part so thinking
22:31 - about low floors in that capacity
22:33 - thinking about uh wide
22:36 - walls but with frames of Interest so
22:39 - wide walls has to do with you know kids
22:41 - can can explore lots of different kinds
22:43 - of interests in a space any kind of um
22:46 - interest that they have they can they
22:48 - can dip into but not all Learners enjoy
22:51 - that kind of variety that kind of
22:53 - variety and too much Choice can make
22:54 - people stressed out or uh raise anxiety
22:58 - or um just not be what they're into um
23:01 - young people for example on the autism
23:02 - spectrum might be really really uh
23:05 - interested in one specific or one kind
23:07 - of range of interests and it's not to
23:10 - say that a specificity that that's
23:13 - narrow and that that's negative but that
23:15 - might be some somebody's space of
23:17 - comfort so being okay with the it's not
23:20 - every sort of inch of the wall that
23:21 - needs to be covered by every child but
23:24 - that sort of certain spaces that are
23:26 - carved out are okay too in any of these
23:28 - kinds of spaces um thinking about then
23:31 - High ceilings but with tall ladders to
23:34 - get there so what are the kinds of
23:35 - scaffolds that Learners need to work
23:38 - their way up in increasing complexity in
23:40 - any kind of project um and that again
23:43 - can be scaffolding that's baked into a
23:45 - system um whether that's other kinds
23:47 - drawing on udl other kinds of um
23:50 - captioning or other kinds of font
23:51 - choices even what's the kind of what's
23:53 - the different kind of scaffolding that
23:55 - somebody might need to move through a
23:57 - platform um but also social scaffolding
24:00 - as well and then the sort of one
24:03 - additional so a fourth component then is
24:05 - thinking about the corners and thinking
24:08 - about what about Learners and I say in
24:10 - the corners there who are perhaps twice
24:13 - exceptional so gifted uh Learners with
24:15 - disabilities thinking about what are the
24:18 - areas of achievement for them that um
24:22 - that you need we need to maybe think and
24:24 - reinforce a little more what other extra
24:25 - kinds of supports or um uh you know
24:29 - resources might be Marshall to support
24:32 - those Learners who very often there's
24:33 - lots of research on there about those
24:35 - students um or extra risk of being bored
24:38 - or extra risk of U being kind of tuned
24:40 - out if there's not those those kinds of
24:42 - opportunities there so um so for me it's
24:46 - it's kind of a more theoretical visual
24:48 - representation of that's kind of how I
24:49 - think but thinking about how to adapt um
24:53 - these kinds of models for explicitly not
24:55 - just in um a loose way but in explicit
24:57 - way how it fits with
24:59 - disability so this was a model that was
25:01 - published in 2012 yeah how would you
25:04 - extend it reimagine It remix it yeah no
25:08 - that's a that's a great question I think
25:11 - uh it's a thing that came out and so I
25:12 - haven't had a lot of conversations with
25:14 - people about so I'm very interested in
25:16 - afterwards hearing from people about it
25:18 - um because for me the the pushing on of
25:20 - on the walls from the inside of the you
25:22 - know outside comes from conversations
25:25 - with people so I think that um there's a
25:28 - lot of new ways to take it that I
25:30 - definitely haven't considered yet what
25:32 - are your initial reactions responses to
25:35 - it when you see this does this resonate
25:37 - with your work how would you extend
25:44 - it I I think it's lovely and I love how
25:48 - it it seems to really synergize with how
25:51 - I think as a designer for students with
25:54 - disabilities so thinking about having
25:56 - high expectations but scaffold each
25:58 - individual student to what they need to
26:01 - feel successful and to grow having those
26:03 - wide walls and making sure that students
26:06 - have a personal connection to their work
26:08 - and are extremely interested and
26:11 - invested in it it's really
26:15 - fantastic I reinforced what he said um
26:18 - one of the things about spaces like this
26:20 - is that um how much flexibility do we
26:24 - have to actually adapt a space that
26:26 - we're working with um and that is one of
26:28 - the challenges that you know we have I'm
26:30 - not a classroom teacher present um but
26:32 - in the classrooms and I go in and work
26:34 - in there isn't as much flexibility and
26:36 - adaptation possible um but I would love
26:40 - to think about this in the context of
26:43 - our current conversation about
26:45 - redesigning what the schools look like
26:46 - in the future in Boston public schools
26:48 - and in other districts as well um
26:51 - because I think that's enormously
26:52 - important yeah that's great yeah I'd
26:54 - love to have this annotated with
26:57 - specific instances of what it would look
26:59 - like in the classroom and how could we
27:01 - help teachers think about it both in
27:03 - formal learning environments and outside
27:05 - of school that would be amazing okay so
27:07 - maybe we'll
27:08 - transition to udl to
27:11 - Rihanna sure so I was introduced to
27:14 - rihan and by my nextdoor neighbor at
27:17 - hgsc David Rose who's like the father of
27:19 - Universal Design for Learning he's like
27:21 - you have to meet Rihanna and she's
27:22 - amazing she's doing this work in the
27:24 - field so that's how we were introduced
27:26 - yeah yes um so thank you Karen um so
27:30 - actually what brought me to Boston four
27:32 - summers ago was udl um I was an
27:36 - undergrad not an undergrad a graduate
27:38 - student at the um University of Michigan
27:40 - in Ann Arbor and I learned about
27:43 - Universal Design for Learning the first
27:45 - time there um and it made so much sense
27:48 - to me it wasn't something I knew about
27:50 - in theory but in practice and so I said
27:53 - I'm going to cast that's why I have to
27:55 - do my internship and I've been in Boston
27:57 - since so I spent a good year and a half
28:00 - at cast learning about udl and how we
28:03 - can use that in both formal and informal
28:06 - learning spaces so being that I work
28:09 - with teachers what I try to do is uh
28:12 - design those online and Blended learning
28:15 - experiences that demonstrate udl
28:18 - principles and the biggest thing if you
28:21 - are new to Universal Design for Learning
28:23 - is that it's about learner variability
28:25 - by planning from the beginning we can
28:28 - design these flexible learning
28:29 - environments we have to have goals that
28:32 - are set so that we can um design the
28:34 - best space for our Learners and we're
28:36 - going to make mistakes you know I know
28:38 - I've made mistakes but that's how we
28:40 - learn and another thing about udl like
28:43 - if you think about these three different
28:44 - principles um we have to think about how
28:46 - we're taking in information right now um
28:49 - we're taking things in visually and
28:50 - auditorally some people might need some
28:52 - movement so we have to think about
28:54 - representing that information and then
28:56 - we think about expressing like some
28:58 - people want to say something out loud
29:00 - other people need to write it some
29:01 - people need more time to respond and so
29:04 - this is really critical when we think
29:05 - about designing in any kind of
29:08 - environment and then the most critical
29:10 - piece where empathy comes in really is
29:12 - the engagement the why like why should I
29:14 - care how can I Foster authentic learning
29:17 - experiences so I'm always thinking about
29:20 - udl in the work that I do every day so I
29:23 - want to ask you what can you do to plan
29:26 - for variability I hope that by
29:29 - demonstrating some of the work that
29:30 - we've done so far you can think about
29:31 - how you can do that in your own practice
29:33 - if you're not already doing
29:36 - so so this past year um BPS participated
29:40 - in the hour of cod and it was a great
29:42 - event we did a district wide and these
29:45 - are a few images from the hour of code
29:48 - um we have the top two pictures from
29:51 - students at the Horseman's School for
29:53 - the Deaf in Austin and then on the
29:56 - bottom on the bottom right right is
29:58 - another student at The Horseman school
30:00 - for the deatha and the one on the bottom
30:02 - left is a student at the Gardner pilot
30:04 - Academy and all of these are students of
30:07 - color students who may have multiple
30:10 - disabilities um and they were so engaged
30:14 - my personal favorite picture is the one
30:15 - where the the little kid at the top
30:17 - right he just wants to jump into that
30:19 - computer and I just I love it because
30:22 - you know what he's engaged something
30:24 - must be going right on that computer but
30:27 - if it wasn't accessible do you think you
30:28 - would still have the same response so
30:30 - thinking about what that looks like in
30:32 - terms of your design and I absolutely
30:35 - enjoyed participating in the hour of C
30:37 - because it was really transformational
30:39 - for teachers and students they thought
30:42 - about Cod for the first time and others
30:44 - thought about taking the extra step with
30:47 - Cod and then finally um we are having a
30:51 - conversation in Massachusetts and
30:53 - specifically in the Boston Public
30:55 - Schools about the new Massachusetts
30:57 - digital literacy and computer science
30:59 - standards they were recently uh
31:01 - published in June and these are going to
31:04 - be very critical for how we are talking
31:06 - about technology integration in our
31:09 - district um and these are the four
31:11 - strands and I want to highight highlight
31:14 - a couple of them you can read this
31:16 - Computing in society digital tools and
31:18 - collaboration Computing systems and
31:21 - computational thinking now all of these
31:23 - are critical pieces
31:24 - to uh understanding online learning
31:27 - learning understanding how we're
31:30 - thinking about computational thinking
31:32 - and what I absolutely love I have to say
31:35 - this and it gets me excited anytime
31:36 - people even talk about this um tells you
31:39 - that people don't talk about it enough
31:41 - um is that in Computing in society it
31:44 - specifically addresses accessibility IT
31:47 - addresses teaching Learners about
31:49 - accessibility how to build accessible
31:51 - websites how empathy is an important
31:54 - part in fostering Equity so I really
31:57 - encourage you check out these standards
32:00 - and if you're interested in exploring
32:02 - our work we create a lot of videos and
32:05 - professional learning experiences for
32:06 - our teachers and our channel is up there
32:09 - in YouTube we have two separate channels
32:11 - and we talk about the standards there
32:13 - there's a lot of teacher created
32:14 - resources on there as well and all of
32:17 - this is part of our conversation about
32:19 - seos for all and digital literacy more
32:23 - brought me that's beautiful I loved in
32:26 - your second slide this calls think about
32:28 - plan for variability if I want to get
32:31 - started how do I do that what are my
32:34 - first steps I also appreciated that you
32:36 - said like it's okay to make mistakes
32:38 - it's better to try and fail than not to
32:40 - have tried at all but like where where
32:41 - do I get started and what type of
32:43 - supports are available for me I would
32:46 - get started by really looking at the udl
32:50 - guidelines look at the udl guidelines
32:52 - find somebody you know who's passionate
32:55 - about udl someone who's passionate about
32:58 - working on the same issues that you want
33:00 - to work on because they can tell you the
33:02 - things that they've done um that work
33:04 - for them and didn't work for them and I
33:07 - think a big part of this is that you
33:09 - have to be vulnerable and you have to
33:11 - also say like this is going to become a
33:13 - change in my mindset
33:15 - um because it really is critical like
33:18 - you really do have to plan from the
33:20 - beginning to consider all the different
33:23 - components how do how do the kids that
33:26 - the teachers you support get involved in
33:28 - supporting planning for variability how
33:31 - do the kids get involved that's an
33:33 - excellent question I want to have deeper
33:35 - conversations about that this year full
33:38 - transparency last year was my first year
33:40 - in the Boston Public Schools so I'm
33:42 - still learning as I go along and every
33:45 - day is a learning day but that's one of
33:47 - the things that I want to find out more
33:48 - about um one school that I was more
33:50 - involved with Horseman they do so much
33:54 - already around that they I think they
33:57 - one of the things about learner
33:59 - variability in udl is an awareness of
34:01 - your own learning what you need to learn
34:04 - better uh because they always talk about
34:07 - becoming a masterful learner you know
34:10 - Mastery of learning because Master
34:12 - Teachers are Master Learners yes yeah
34:15 - that's
34:16 - beautiful Nick oh
34:20 - okay so for me to show you uh what it
34:23 - look looks like in practice I thought I
34:25 - would transfer you virtually to my class
34:27 - classro in Chicago for a few minutes so
34:30 - as you can see there are some very
34:31 - simple Technologies on display in this
34:33 - room like couches incandescent lighting
34:37 - I'm very intentional about my space so
34:39 - that it's very welcoming more like a
34:41 - coffee shop than a traditional classroom
34:43 - and uh we honor student curiosity and
34:46 - inquiry as part of our curriculum and
34:48 - that's where this project came about uh
34:50 - all of my students in fourth grade get
34:53 - to go for the first time uh to perform
34:55 - through our school's music program at uh
34:58 - Symphony Center downtown which is where
35:00 - the Chicago Symphony Orchestra performs
35:03 - and it's a great experience for them and
35:04 - they had some wonderful questions like
35:06 - where did instruments really come from
35:09 - who designed them in the first place and
35:11 - I thought what a fabulous teachable
35:13 - moment so what I did is I used uh
35:16 - Mitch's learning spiral as a framework
35:19 - for guiding my students through the
35:21 - process of making their own instruments
35:23 - with scratch Makey Makey and lots of
35:25 - cardboard and copper tape
35:28 - so would you like to see what one of my
35:30 - students imagined her instrument to be
35:32 - all
35:35 - right no cheery all right back it up
35:39 - yeah redo and I want to make a flip that
35:44 - that makes cheery sounds like Whimsical
35:47 - music and that's what I want to
35:50 - make and so what we did is we used
35:53 - seesaw as a tool so that students at the
35:56 - end of each working period would record
35:58 - a brief reflection on what they did that
36:00 - day and what's great about seesaw is
36:02 - that it's a two-way street so not only
36:05 - did I have students assigned into
36:06 - critique groups where they would give
36:08 - each other feedback on their design
36:09 - choices they could also asynchronously
36:11 - give each other audio feedback in these
36:14 - messages I blotted out the student names
36:16 - but uh and in the interest of time I'll
36:17 - just tell you what student B said he
36:19 - gave her two great suggestions the first
36:22 - was as she was building a Whimsical
36:24 - flute he wanted her to have a Twizzler
36:26 - as like a read or a mouthpiece so she
36:28 - would put that in her mouth connect it
36:30 - to the ground and then she could play
36:31 - like a real flute uh his other
36:34 - suggestion because he's a fourth grader
36:36 - was that she should cover it with
36:37 - lightning bolts because lightning bolts
36:39 - make everything more awesome
36:43 - true so what I did for create is that I
36:47 - went to scratch and then we played some
36:50 - notes and we messed them and then we um
36:54 - changed the beats and the notes to make
36:57 - it to make it a Whimsical
36:59 - flute and what I love about this is that
37:02 - it actually hearkens back to Thursday's
37:04 - keynote with bubble 103 she used the
37:07 - same words messed around when describing
37:09 - her process in using
37:12 - scratch but this is what really blew me
37:14 - away hello for create I did cheap music
37:19 - for my
37:21 - FL
37:22 - and Mr G put down all the keys that I'm
37:26 - using for my leg make
37:28 - and I put them down in an order that I
37:30 - like them to so a two
37:33 - times so here's a copy of her sheet
37:36 - music that she developed for her madeup
37:39 - instrument and it's fascinating she
37:40 - wanted me to put all the inputs of the
37:42 - Makey Makey up and then she went to the
37:44 - computer and tapped them out because we
37:45 - hadn't finished the physical artifact
37:48 - yet but it's amazing to me that she
37:50 - coded the instrument in scratch and then
37:52 - music itself is sort of like a form of
37:54 - code that follows a logical sequence so
37:56 - it's sort of fascinating how those two
37:57 - come together but here we are on the
37:59 - final day where she got to finally put
38:01 - it all together and
38:03 - play so for play I played with my flet
38:09 - right here that has all the Mickey
38:11 - mickys and so
38:14 - like and it's really cool and I also
38:18 - practice my sheet music that you saw
38:21 - earlier earlier and stuff that I would
38:24 - want to improve at it is add a little
38:27 - bit more
38:28 - sound and so what I love about this and
38:30 - here's a picture of the finished project
38:33 - when we hung it up at the end was that
38:35 - at this point in the process she's no
38:37 - longer working for me she's no longer
38:40 - trying to earn a grade it's about her
38:43 - own passion for the work that she does
38:44 - and I think that's the magic that's in
38:46 - constructionism that and working with
38:49 - her peers of course oh my goodness it's
38:52 - so Beau
38:56 - [Music]
38:59 - as a side note I think we have a little
39:00 - time at the end so if you want to come I
39:02 - brought it with me so you can fiddle
39:05 - around with it
39:07 - yourself so I felt incredibly fortunate
39:10 - earlier this year to go visit your
39:12 - classroom in Chicago and I really saw
39:15 - this like profound commitment to
39:16 - planning for variability that rihan was
39:19 - talking about I was wondering if you
39:21 - could talk a little bit about what makes
39:24 - it possible for you to do that work in
39:27 - Practice dayto Day in the classroom and
39:29 - I'm also going to ask Marl and Rihanna
39:31 - to comment on what did you notice using
39:34 - sort of your set of lenses in your work
39:36 - what did you see in this example that
39:38 - made this possible so uh well for me I
39:41 - think it's having a very secure and
39:44 - confident administration at my school
39:46 - that trusts the teachers uh we have a
39:48 - long history of developing our own
39:51 - curriculum and so we're given a lot of
39:53 - autonomy to do work with children that
39:56 - we're pass about and so that's what
39:59 - gives me the freedom to get to
40:01 - experiment with things like this just so
40:03 - that you know this was a process they
40:05 - went on the field trip on Monday they
40:08 - finished these instruments on Friday and
40:10 - they spent about 30 minutes each day so
40:12 - total about two to 2 and a half hours of
40:14 - Total work in this
40:16 - project so what did you see what did you
40:19 - see in the example that made this
40:22 - possible I'm really drawn to the um the
40:26 - sort of social scaffolding was provided
40:28 - in Sea and the um both the the
40:32 - opportunity to see to visualize feedback
40:35 - in that way um to have uh an audio
40:39 - component of feedback as opposed to like
40:40 - a Google doc on the side you know Google
40:42 - doc doesn't let you necessarily record
40:45 - your feedback in a in a tidbit you just
40:47 - type a little message uh and so the the
40:49 - platform choices and the options of
40:52 - being able to provide feedback in a way
40:54 - that is natural um you know for her
40:57 - giving you her journaling in a video
41:00 - short video format it's more natural uh
41:03 - perhaps than you know writing a long
41:05 - form or typing in a Google doc or
41:06 - something so for me um the social
41:08 - component and then the tools that had
41:10 - certain affordances for the kinds of
41:12 - sociality that were most natural for for
41:14 - these students also going back to your
41:17 - triplet that you presented at the very
41:18 - beginning about the social cultural and
41:21 - political the politics of the school and
41:24 - that you commented on the power of the
41:25 - administration like it just the entire
41:28 - environment just oozed support in every
41:32 - space and how would that be possible
41:34 - without
41:36 - it I would agree with everything they M
41:38 - said um I just think it's super exciting
41:42 - that they have this opportunity to be
41:43 - able to create in this way I see this
41:47 - student as a leader I want to see her at
41:49 - this year's next year's scratch
41:51 - conference telling us how she did all
41:53 - that yeah it's it's it's phenomenal yeah
41:57 - just to to LY off that yeah that's the
42:00 - thinking about leaders in this space and
42:02 - sort of you know young people um with
42:04 - different abilities being able to then
42:06 - sort of take charge and speak on their
42:08 - own behalf and being able to give
42:10 - feedback to what would make their
42:12 - learning better what would make their
42:14 - their ideas for learning among their
42:15 - peers better um and sort of this same
42:18 - process of you know she seemed
42:19 - incredibly capable of of of expressing
42:22 - those um what worked for her and so
42:24 - being able to uh then be a leader and to
42:28 - in whatever if you know whatever her
42:29 - desires are but I think that it's
42:31 - important to have those opportunities to
42:32 - um to build leadership skills as well as
42:36 - computational creation skills and
42:39 - something that I'd like to add uh
42:40 - something else that made this possible
42:42 - now that I think about it is going back
42:44 - to the classroom this year after a year
42:46 - at hugsy uh something that I've taken
42:47 - with me from the media lab was from Rick
42:50 - Rose's work a very fine look at student
42:55 - process and recording student process
42:57 - and then giving that tool to the
42:59 - students as a way of reflecting on their
43:00 - own process so that's something I'm
43:03 - certainly much more driven in that way
43:06 - now what what are you working on still
43:09 - like what are the puzzles that you're
43:10 - still struggling with mulling over
43:13 - keeping you up at night but hopefully
43:15 - not too much your big
43:21 - questions I'm trying not to make direct
43:24 - eye contact with anyone so they can have
43:25 - a second to think about it that's a
43:26 - question for all three of us it is a
43:28 - question for all three of you your
43:29 - puzzles what are your big puzzles what
43:31 - are you going to work on over the next
43:32 - year let's say so I think for me part of
43:35 - it is
43:38 - uh connecting family the family
43:41 - conversations the classroom
43:44 - conversations the administrative
43:46 - conversations and the ways in which
43:48 - those can be so different um and to add
43:50 - another layer to the sort of clinical um
43:53 - so uh the work I've been doing has
43:55 - focused for a little bit on on um young
43:57 - people with significant speech
43:59 - impairments who use uh Technologies as a
44:01 - way to produce synthetic speech and to
44:03 - communicate which sometimes overlaps
44:05 - with um young people on the autism
44:07 - spectrum and so doing more ethnographic
44:08 - work in homes among kids on the Spectrum
44:11 - and thinking about what are the way the
44:13 - both the challenges that they encounter
44:15 - and the successes that they what they
44:17 - achieve and how families can scaffold
44:20 - this and what resources families have to
44:23 - support that kind of learning but not
44:25 - just what they on their own can do but
44:27 - ways in which there is both a deliberate
44:30 - uh and and not necessarily so deliberate
44:32 - discriminatory practices that happen um
44:35 - in the education system in the US um it
44:38 - can be a real challenge to um to be able
44:42 - to hold on to one's educational rights
44:44 - um considering different kinds of
44:45 - violations that can that can happen
44:47 - pretty regularly and the kind of
44:48 - advocacy that's very often required on
44:51 - behalf of families for their kids to get
44:53 - the kind of differentiated
44:55 - individualized education plan IEP um
44:58 - people are aware of that term um to get
45:00 - those things um carried out into
45:02 - practice so in my work I I discovered a
45:04 - lot of expectations and hopes um
45:07 - especially parents who' maybe just come
45:09 - to this country looking for something
45:11 - better and and significant
45:13 - disappointment and it's partly
45:14 - individual choices but it's also lack of
45:16 - funding in some critical areas so some
45:19 - funding that you know was put towards
45:21 - new iPads that could have really been
45:23 - spent on paying you know educator
45:26 - teachers to come for like an hour and
45:28 - visit a family and understand what's
45:30 - happening there there's a lot of
45:32 - assumptions and a lot of biases that get
45:35 - baked into people's own childhoods and
45:37 - backgrounds I found but um but on on the
45:40 - ground um again think about empathy but
45:43 - do we what money do we put behind
45:46 - empathy do we pay people uh and not ask
45:49 - them on their own unpaid to go do this
45:51 - kind of work um what are we really on a
45:54 - sort of institutional level on a on a
45:56 - polic level funding actively in ways
45:59 - that really matter and I think that how
46:00 - do we fund empathy how do we you know
46:03 - what are the ways that we do that um is
46:05 - a question that's open and I think
46:07 - that's what I think about oh that's
46:10 - great uh and thinking about next steps
46:12 - for me I'm really looking at thinking
46:16 - about Partnerships for doing more work
46:19 - like this outside of the school day in
46:21 - informal settings because if you ask any
46:23 - teacher the one thing that they're
46:25 - always short on is time
46:27 - and so I'm very curious about ways that
46:30 - we can do this kind of work for Learners
46:33 - of all ability levels I often see
46:36 - programs listed as enrichment and for
46:39 - gifted students but I don't see programs
46:42 - that actively seek out uh the
46:45 - variability of these kinds of Learners
46:47 - so that's my big push is push is to go
46:50 - hunting for those kinds of services
46:52 - that's
46:54 - awesome what keeps me awake at night is
46:56 - is uh how I can help teach and actively
47:02 - act in designing a more inclusive World
47:05 - um I don't necessarily work with
47:07 - students every day I've said this
47:08 - already but I work with teachers and I
47:11 - like to think everyone in this room is a
47:13 - lifelong learner we're all learning
47:15 - that's why we're here so I would love to
47:18 - work more on designing professional
47:21 - learning opportunities that are
47:23 - inclusive of all Learners I mean
47:25 - scratchers of all ages all abilities
47:27 - right so having these professional
47:30 - opportunities like at camps and um
47:33 - conferences like this I mean this
47:34 - conference has been awesome I have
47:36 - accessibility here but this is actually
47:38 - a rarity um unfortunately so I want to
47:42 - see more opportunities for us to design
47:46 - those um professional learning
47:49 - experiences for all of our teachers
47:52 - because not everyone is comfortable with
47:54 - disclosure I have a lifetime of advocacy
47:57 - um I have a mom and a grandma who were
47:59 - big huge Advocates and that's made a
48:01 - difference I mean Mar talked about the
48:03 - parents the families I mean every single
48:06 - parent in my experience who has a child
48:08 - with a disability experiences some level
48:11 - of guilt you like that that's never
48:12 - going to go away even my Mom feels that
48:15 - way so but you can get um past the guilt
48:18 - by still you know acting upon it some
48:21 - people never do um but I think it's our
48:24 - job to like design those spaces so when
48:26 - people come in they can have it ready
48:29 - you know it's already accessible for
48:31 - them because they may not even know they
48:33 - need it either um so that's my big thing
48:36 - that keeps me off every day yeah small
48:39 - small
48:41 - matter and actually a core sort of one
48:44 - of the core tenants of udl that I love
48:46 - so much is sort of like what's good for
48:48 - one is good for all that everyone can
48:50 - benefit from it and so when you create
48:52 - these accessible spaces you aren't just
48:54 - thinking about this one person everyone
48:56 - can benefit from which is so beautiful
48:58 - so the last question I'm going to ask is
49:01 - purely selfish but I hope everyone else
49:03 - benefits from it as well sort of advice
49:05 - you've given me so much guidance and
49:08 - given me new ways of seeing the world
49:09 - and thinking about things so what's an
49:11 - idea about for all that you hope people
49:14 - asking for a friend uh will take away
49:17 - from this
49:18 - session uh so I think if there's one
49:21 - word uh and you can tweet this out you
49:23 - can you know spread it far and wide the
49:25 - word intersectionality
49:27 - you can Google it you can research it um
49:30 - it it starts explicitly uh it's a term
49:34 - that GRE grew out of uh black feminist
49:36 - spaces uh and thinking about in what
49:39 - what ways especially this is started off
49:41 - kind of in the legal space but what are
49:42 - ways in talking about women's rights and
49:44 - legal rights very often excluded women
49:46 - of color and an active uh reassertion of
49:51 - uh of power imbalances and thinking
49:52 - about who gets to define the terms of
49:54 - participation and so explicitly
49:56 - intersectionality that no no child with
49:59 - a disability you know is not only the
50:01 - same because of the same you cost
50:03 - diagnosis can be different um but also
50:07 - just thinking about the intersections of
50:09 - class and so the resources and just
50:11 - getting a diagnosis is itself a very uh
50:14 - tricky thing to get if you don't know
50:15 - where to go or who to ask um so
50:17 - intersectionality and thinking about to
50:20 - basically we say about for all but
50:22 - without thinking about intersectionality
50:24 - you inherently are privileging some and
50:27 - so an active push back on on it's a it's
50:31 - always a work in progress for all is
50:32 - always a a moving Target but we can
50:35 - better aim on the Target by having a
50:38 - sort of intersectional component in mind
50:40 - where we're thinking about all of the
50:42 - different differences that individuals
50:47 - represent so uh the thing that I want to
50:49 - leave you with is a couple of Statistics
50:52 - first so right now uh roughly 133% % of
50:57 - students in schools receive special
51:00 - education services so that's 6 and A5
51:03 - million Learners that's one every one
51:06 - out of every seven to eight uh students
51:09 - so as you go forward and work with
51:11 - students um look at the ratios of the
51:14 - kids that you're working with are do
51:16 - those line up with the actual population
51:19 - and I'd invite you to go and seek out
51:22 - special education students uh and if
51:24 - you're having trouble doing so uh Mimi
51:26 - said it best yesterday she said uh
51:28 - teachers are great Wranglers and so make
51:32 - a friend with a special education
51:33 - teacher and get them to funnel students
51:35 - to you you won't regret
51:37 - it I think they both said it beautifully
51:41 - I feel like most of what I've been
51:42 - saying today is what I want to leave you
51:44 - with I want to leave you with the
51:46 - urgency of having to design right now
51:50 - don't be ret with anything things plan
51:53 - it from the start um and it will be be
51:57 - um hard but be open about how it's hard
52:00 - and be willing to learn always thank you
