00:00 - - Hi, everyone.
00:01 - It's ZoÃ« from the scratch team.
00:02 - Also known as Zinnea.
00:04 - Today, I wanted to show you
00:06 - how to make a clicker game in scratch.
00:08 - If you haven't played one before,
00:09 - a clicker game is a game where
00:11 - there's a certain item you can click on
00:13 - to get more points
00:14 - and then,
00:15 - there's other items that you can buy
00:17 - and they'll give you even more points.
00:19 - It sounds so simple,
00:20 - but they're really satisfying to play.
00:22 - And it's really fun as a game maker
00:24 - because you can decide
00:26 - what are all the objects
00:27 - that the player can unlock.
00:28 - So, yeah.
00:29 - By the end of this tutorial,
00:30 - you'll be able to make
your own game like this.
00:33 - Let's get started.
00:34 - So first,
00:35 - let's pick the first object
00:37 - that you want the player
to be able to click on.
00:39 - You can just hover over it,
00:41 - choose a sprite,
00:42 - and click choose,
00:43 - and pick any object that
you want for your game.
00:46 - I will pick the apple.
00:48 - And let's start by making this sprite
00:51 - play a sound when you click it.
00:52 - You can go to the sound category
00:55 - and drag out a start sound,
00:57 - block and click on that
00:58 - to make the sprite play a sound.
01:00 - (sprite sound)
01:01 - And if I go to the events category
01:03 - and add a
01:04 - when this sprite clicked block on top.
01:08 - Now, whenever I click on the apple,
01:10 - it plays a sound.
01:11 - Now, let's make it so that
01:13 - every time the player clicks on the apple,
01:15 - they get a point.
01:16 - To do this,
01:17 - we can make a variable.
01:19 - In scratch, a variable lets you keep track
01:22 - of a certain number in your project.
01:25 - So here, we can make a variable
01:27 - and call it points.
01:29 - And now, we can use this to keep track of
01:31 - how many points the player has scored.
01:33 - I'm also going to delete this
01:35 - my variable
01:36 - variable by right clicking on it
01:38 - or CTRL clicking on it
01:39 - and clicking delete.
01:41 - So, to make the player get a point
01:43 - every time they click the apple,
01:45 - we can drag out this block,
01:47 - change points by one.
01:48 - This increases our points by one.
01:50 - And if you put this block under the,
01:52 - when this sprite clicked block,
01:54 - now whenever the sprite is clicked,
01:56 - (sprite sound)
01:57 - it plays a sound and the
points increase by one.
02:00 - And we would like the points to be zero
02:02 - when the project starts.
02:04 - So, you can drag out this block,
02:05 - set points to zero
02:07 - and then, put a
02:09 - when green flag clicked block on top.
02:11 - And now, every time you
click the green flag,
02:14 - the points start back at zero.
02:16 - Also, we can make the
click even more satisfying
02:19 - by making the sprite grow and shrink
02:22 - when you click on it.
02:23 - So, if you go to the looks category
02:26 - and drag out the set size block.
02:29 - So, if I try
02:30 - set size to 110%,
02:33 - it gets a bit bigger.
02:34 - Set size to 100,
02:36 - will set it back to its usual size.
02:38 - And if I do
02:39 - set size to 110,
02:41 - wait for 0.05 seconds
02:45 - and then, set size to 100,
02:47 - it does a little animation
02:49 - where it froze and shrinks really quickly.
02:50 - So, if I attach this under the
02:53 - when this sprite clicked block,
02:54 - now every time I click on it,
02:56 - it does a little animation.
02:57 - You could also choose
your own sound to play
03:00 - when the sprite gets clicked.
03:01 - So, if you click on the sounds tab
03:05 - and then click on choose a sound,
03:07 - you can pick whatever sound you like.
03:09 - My favorite thing to do is,
03:10 - I'll choose the sound,
03:11 - boop bing bop
03:13 - and then, I'll click and select
03:15 - everything except this last piece.
03:18 - And then, click delete.
03:20 - And then, the only part that's left
03:21 - is this little sound
03:22 - (animation sound)
03:23 - which I love.
03:24 - So then, once you're done with your sound,
03:26 - you can click on the code tab
03:29 - and just click in this menu
03:31 - and choose it.
03:32 - Now, let's add the next item
03:34 - in the clicker game.
03:35 - And let's make it so that with this item,
03:37 - you have to save up points and buy it.
03:39 - I'll show you how to do that.
03:41 - So, pick what you want
the next item to be.
03:44 - I'll pick the orange.
03:46 - And here's what we'll make the orange do.
03:49 - This is how purchasable items
03:51 - in clicker games work.
03:52 - It will cost 10 points
03:54 - to be able to click on the orange.
03:56 - And then, when you click on it,
03:58 - you will start automatically getting
04:00 - one point every second.
04:02 - Then, you could click on the orange again
04:04 - and buy another.
04:05 - And now you're getting two new points
04:06 - every second.
04:07 - And this is where clicker games
04:08 - start to get really fun.
04:09 - Which is, you can eventually be getting
04:11 - thousands of points every second,
04:13 - automatically,
04:14 - which could enable you to buy
04:16 - even more expensive items.
04:17 - So to start,
04:18 - let me show you how to
do that with the orange.
04:20 - So, we're going to need a new variable
04:22 - to keep track of
04:24 - how many automatic points
04:26 - the player is getting every second.
04:28 - So, let's click make a variable
04:30 - and I'll call it
04:32 - automatic points per second.
04:34 - Now, let's click on the costumes tab
04:37 - and click on the text tool
04:39 - and write down how much
04:41 - you want this item to cost.
04:43 - I will make the orange cost 10 points
04:46 - and let's also write down
04:48 - how many points per second
04:50 - it will give the player
once the player buys one.
04:53 - I'll make it give the player
04:54 - one automatic point per second.
04:56 - Let's go back to the code tab.
04:58 - So, if the player has less than 10 points,
05:02 - we want the orange to appear grayed out
05:05 - because they can't buy it yet.
05:06 - Here's how you can do that.
05:07 - In the looks category,
05:09 - you can drag out a set color effect block,
05:12 - but instead of color effect,
05:14 - choose ghost effect.
05:15 - And if you set that to 60,
05:18 - that makes a sprite look
05:20 - transparent or faded.
05:21 - And then, this block,
05:22 - clear graphic effects,
05:23 - will make a sprite look normal.
05:25 - And let's drag out an
05:26 - if else block,
05:28 - we can say if the points are
05:32 - less than 10,
05:36 - set the ghost effect to 60,
05:37 - make it look faded out.
05:39 - Otherwise, clear graphic effects
05:42 - and make the sprite look normal.
05:43 - And if we put this inside a forever loop,
05:47 - now, the project will always
05:50 - be checking this if else block.
05:52 - So, it will always check
05:55 - does the player have less than 10 points?
05:57 - If the player has less than 10 points,
05:59 - it will make the orange look faded.
06:01 - Otherwise, it will make
the orange look bright.
06:04 - And we can put a
06:05 - when green flag clicked block on top
06:08 - so that, this code starts
06:09 - when the green flag is clicked.
06:12 - Now, so when the game starts,
06:15 - we only have zero points.
06:16 - And so, the orange looks faded.
06:19 - And then, once we have 10 points,
06:21 - it looks bright.
06:22 - Like, we can buy it now.
06:23 - Now, let's drag out a
06:24 - when this sprite clicked block.
06:26 - In the game,
06:27 - what should happen when the player
06:29 - clicks on the orange?
06:31 - Well, let's drag out another
06:34 - if else block,
06:35 - because if the player
has less than 10 points,
06:38 - nothing should happen
06:40 - because they don't have enough points
06:41 - to buy the orange yet.
06:42 - So, we can actually just leave this part
06:44 - of the if else block blank.
06:46 - However, if the player
does have 10 points,
06:50 - then...
06:51 - Well, let's make it play a sound.
06:53 - We'll start with that.
06:53 - (animation sound)
06:54 - Okay.
06:55 - Okay, I don't have 10 points yet.
06:56 - I try to click on the orange,
06:58 - nothing happens,
06:59 - but now that I have 10 points,
07:00 - I can click on it
07:01 - and it makes a sound.
07:02 - And what else should happen
07:04 - when the player
successfully buys an orange?
07:07 - Well, it should take away 10 points
07:09 - from the player.
07:10 - So, let's change points by negative 10
07:15 - because you see,
07:16 - we've got to spin,
07:18 - you have to make sure that
07:18 - the player actually spends the money.
07:20 - And the orange should start giving you
07:23 - an automatic point every second.
07:26 - So, here's how you do that.
07:29 - Let's change automatic
points per second by one.
07:34 - You're increasing it by one.
07:36 - Okay, let's try it out.
07:37 - So, I get 10 points,
07:40 - I click on the orange and buy it.
07:42 - Okay, it decreased my points,
07:44 - I spent the money,
07:45 - and my automatic points
per second went up,
07:49 - this variable went up,
07:53 - but if I don't do anything,
07:54 - if I don't click,
07:55 - I'm not actually getting
07:57 - any automatic points per second.
07:58 - We have to add some code
08:01 - that will do that.
08:02 - Let's click on the apple to add this code
08:05 - because only one sprite
needs to be doing this.
08:08 - So, let's just make
the first sprite do it.
08:10 - Try this.
08:11 - If we say,
08:12 - when the green flag is clicked,
08:13 - forever wait one seconds
08:16 - and change points by one.
08:18 - What happens?
08:19 - Okay, this makes your score
08:21 - increase by one every second
08:22 - because it waits one second
08:24 - and then, adds one to your points.
08:26 - Even if you're not clicking.
08:27 - But let's say I buy two oranges.
08:30 - Now, I should be getting
two points every second.
08:34 - And if I have three oranges,
08:37 - I should be getting three
points every second.
08:39 - So, we don't just want our points
08:42 - to increase by one every second.
08:44 - We want them to increase by
08:46 - whatever this variable is.
08:49 - So, instead of one here,
08:52 - you can just drag in the variable,
08:54 - automatic points per second,
08:56 - and put that here.
08:57 - And now, the project always adds
09:00 - whatever this number is
09:03 - to your points.
09:04 - So, if you've gotten
automatic points per second
09:07 - up to five,
09:08 - you'll get five points every second.
09:10 - And if you've gotten it up to a thousand,
09:12 - you'll get a thousand points every second.
09:13 - And when the game restarts,
09:15 - we want the automatic points per second
09:18 - to start at zero.
09:21 - So, we can just add this block,
09:23 - set automatic points per second to zero
09:26 - under the when green flag clicked block.
09:29 - So, that's how you can
add automatic points
09:32 - to a clicker game.
09:33 - And now, if you just make more objects
09:35 - like the orange,
09:36 - you can have as many items as you want
09:38 - and you can make them as
expensive as you want.
09:40 - Let me show you how you
could add one more item.
09:42 - So, let's say for the next item
09:44 - I want a fruit salad.
09:46 - You just have to give
all the items this code.
09:49 - It's very similar to the oranges code,
09:50 - but let me show you where it's different.
09:52 - I want the fruit salad
to cost 80 points to buy.
09:56 - And I want it to give you
09:58 - plus seven points per second.
10:01 - So, in all of these places,
10:04 - I have to put in 80
10:06 - because that's the cost
of the fruit salad.
10:09 - We want to check that the player
10:11 - has 80 points to be able to buy it.
10:13 - And then here, we want
to take 80 points away
10:15 - from the player because they paid for it.
10:17 - And then here,
10:18 - because the orange is giving you
10:20 - plus seven to your
automatic points per second,
10:23 - there should be a seven here.
10:25 - Oh, and I also went to the costumes tab
10:27 - and wrote in the cost of
this item and the reward.
10:30 - So, that's all you need to do
10:31 - to be able to add as
many purchasable items
10:34 - as you want to your game.
10:35 - Anyway, that's what I
wanted to show you today.
10:38 - The link to this project
10:40 - is in the description below
10:41 - if you want to remix it.
10:43 - And yeah, I hope you have
fun making clicker games
10:46 - with your own items
10:47 - and your own themes.
10:48 - I can't wait to play them.
10:49 - I will probably spend
too long playing them.
10:50 - I played so many clicker games
10:51 - when I was making this video.
10:52 - Yeah, I'll see you next time.
10:54 - And scratch on.
10:57 - (animation sound)
