00:26 - love in the community know we love them
00:27 - all yes it's always hard to choose
00:29 - so one project that we loved was this
00:31 - project by Amy laser emulator called
00:34 - journey's end and it was this MV art
00:37 - project and its really beautiful setting
00:39 - a mood and music of a person walking

01:10 - and then we have things for trisection
01:14 - these are fun things happening in the
01:16 - community that you can get started with
01:19 - yeah and so one thing that you might try
01:21 - is this studio and participate in the
01:23 - studio called scratch or appreciation
01:25 - studio made by bubble 103 and different
01:28 - scratchers are sharing their
01:30 - appreciation of different people in the

01:33 - it's just a really great way to share
01:35 - gratitude yeah and we have a featured
01:37 - studio called lyrics taken literally and
01:41 - so like for instance a song lyric like
01:44 - Adele's I set fire to the rain it's kind
01:46 - of like what does she mean by setting
01:48 - fire to the rain does she really set
01:50 - fire to the rain that's like the I think
01:51 - there's a few of those projects in that

02:28 - a professor in the University of
02:30 - Colorado so if you're in if you're in
02:32 - the Colorado please catch on to me but
02:38 - this means that even though I'll still
