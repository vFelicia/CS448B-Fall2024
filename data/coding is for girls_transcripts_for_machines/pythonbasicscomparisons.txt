hello everyone I'm Ola and this is coding is for girls we already know how to represent data in Python using example in types but what if we want to do different things depending on the value stored in the variable for example if you want to display a different message depending on the person's name or using the language the person is speaking so what I want to show you today is how to compare things okay so let's open console and try some basic comparisons the first thing that comes to mind is obviously comparing numbers let's type five is greater than 2 and press Enter it's true now let's try free lower than 1 this is false what about something more complicated then like 5 is greater than 2 multiple to this is true the values we are getting here when we compare things in python are called billions and they could be either true or false if you studied anything connected to logic I think it should ring the bell and please note that in Python when we write true or false we always start with a capital letter and the rest is lowercase so only these forms are true or false or correct and anything else like true lowercase or having capital case somewhere in between or all capital cases is incorrect ok let's experiment a little bit more what if we want to check if things are equal to each other like one equals one okay that's true if you wonder why we use here a double equal sign instead of single one this is because we already use the single equal sign to something else assigning variables if you watch my previous video about Python basics you know that we use the single equal sign to assign things to variables and because it has so important meaning in Python already we cannot use that for comparing things too that's why when we want to compare if two things are equal to each other we cannot used a single equal sign and Python use double equal sign instead and please note that you cannot put space in between two equal signs let's try what would happen if we try that we're getting syntax error so it is not something fighten understands okay so what is still missing is checking that two values are not equal to each other and we do that with exclamation mark and equal sign so we do that like this v naught equals two okay what if we want to check if one side is greater and equal or lower and equal than other side to do that we simply use lower or greater sign followed with equal sign like this three is lower or equal to or six is greater or equal six so to sum up when we compare numbers we can use one of the following signs in a use crater sign lower sign greater or equal sign lower or equal sign equal sign which is a double equal sign in Python or not equal which is exclamation mark and equal sign if you know a little bit about boolean algebra or logic you are probably familiar with boolean operations what's that if you think about numbers you can do number of operations like adding two numbers obstructing multiplying and so far well we have something similar for boolean values we have operation we can use and these operations are and or and not for the first operation and above left hand side and right hand side of the operation needs to be true to the whole sentence to be true okay let's have an example let's think about it us about sets let's say we have a group of people some of them speak English some Polish and there is also a group of people speaking English and polish if you would like to know who is speaking both English and polish would you use and operator so if we take Alice and we will check does the person speak English yes and if the person speaks polish that is also true so the result of this operation is true Alice speaks both English and polish but if we choose Bob and check if Bob speaks English yes and if Bob speaks polish no the end result is false Bob is not speaking of English and polish okay what we our operator then you probably suspect the answer we use or to check if one of the values is true for example we would like to know if the person either speaks English or polish in this scenario for both Alice and Bob this is true it is also true to Moorea who speaks only Polish finally we have not operator for example we can use that to check if Alice does not speak Polish this is not true for Alice but it is true for Bob okay time to see that in action in Python let's type true and false this is obviously false true or false it's true and not true is false in Python boolean operations are typed lowercase any other variation of lower and uppercase will basically result in name error like this so far we compared only numbers with each other and billions true and false values what if you want to compare for example text with number let's try it let's compare one with text Ranga we get a type error telling us that fightin cannot compare text with numbers in general the rule of the tongue is that Python cannot compare things with a different type however there are some exceptions for example if we compare one integer with one float this is true basically Python is pretty logical here if that makes sense to compare two values for example two numbers but one integer and float it does that but if there is absolutely no sense like comparing number with some random text then it rises error okay let's practice a little bit more we could use variables when comparing things let's assign true to variable a like this a is true or let's assign a result of comparison to the variable like this a assign two is greater than five and now a is false comparing things and billions are one of the most important things in programming so congratulations you just learn about them if it's still not super clear make sure to practice a little bit on your own for example you could try one of these lines here true and true false and true false or 1 2 or 1 equals 1 or 1 is not equal to and true and true and false this is quite a bit of knowledge today we learned that there is something like true and false in Python follows boolean algebra and we use that to compare things my next video I will show you how to use comparisons to do certain things only when the condition is met we will also learn how to create Python script and we run it without need to type every single time the very same thing in Python interpreter so if you want to learn more about programming and don't miss any of my further videos make sure to subscribe my channel and stay tuned have a nice day and see you
