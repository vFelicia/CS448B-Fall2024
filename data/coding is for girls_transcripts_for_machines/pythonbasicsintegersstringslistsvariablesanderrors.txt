hello everyone I'm Ola and this is how it is for girls today we will learn very basic of Python programming language if you haven't installed it yet check my previous video where I explain what is a programming language and how to install by them why we use language why we speak obviously we do that to communicate with other people but to do that effectively we use the language the person understands and if we have a closer look at the languages we'll discover that there is special words they're the special grammar we follow some words have a special function like noun verbs adjectives language also in contextual so depending on the context of the conversation some things can mean something else like your math teacher is a different teacher than your friends one but we'll find all these things in programming languages too special grammar keywords and context in our variables let's open command line or terminal on your computer if you don't know how to do that check my previous video about command line and you know everything you need to know at this point in command line who will type titan3 after running that the prompt changes from dollar to free greater than signs it means we are no longer giving orders to our operating system from comment line but now we are inside Python interpreter and only write needs to be written in Python language so writing things we learned in comment line videos like alas or city will fail actually let's try ha it will fail invite them find an interpreter will tell us that there is nothing called LS will get name error ok time to see that Python is not number then let's say the Sigma's calculator out there then struck if item could ask numbers like 2 plus 3 we type 2 plus 3 and hit enter the result appears immediately and it's correct is file so by the nose map but let's check if it can multiply divide and subtract so for multiple 5 yes it's 25 minus one correct answer it's for 40 / yes it's 20 perfect numbers and in this scenario integers are one of the Python socalled builtin types one of the main things that a programming language needed to deal with is answer the question how you should represent data so the language will understand what you try to achieve is it a number is it text or is it something else how could you tell your programming language then what's your name for example to do that you need to use the format that your programming language is expecting in Python we have a number of building types that allows us to communicate with computer effectively numbers we just use are one of the building types in Python that's the representation of integer numbers but what if you want to tell peyten what's your name this is obviously not integer your name is a text type in your named Python interpreter like this will result in error so it's not good well here comes next building tire called string to write a string we need to wrap text we want to write with quotes okay so let's try double chords this time it worked by two recognized your name as a text you could also use single pots too like this yeah let's try we're faces in between for example like saying hello world the interesting thing in programming languages like Python is that he put out two texts using plus operator like this in Python we could even in multiply text so if you want your name to be repeated three times you could type it us your names multiply by three okay but what if we want to actually have text with quotes inside like my name is in quotes hola well in fluent type it like this there is an error again syntax error if you want to use double quotes inside the string defined with double quotes we simply could use single quotes instead throughout our string and it works perfectly all right okay but let's make it even harder but if we want to have a text that contains both double quotes and single quotes well item can deal with that and to do that in the problematic word so if we wrap our text with single quotes and we have a single quote inside the text we can use backslash just before the single quote inside our text it's called escaping and it's nothing more than telling fightin hey this is not the end of our text yet okay let's try it first we found backslash to see an error so I type my name is Ola and I am a programmer yes heightened complaints that there is a syntax error that basically means that item does not understand what we tried to tell now let's escape a single quote that is a problem here by using backslash just before it so my name is Ola and I backslash single quote m8 programmer this time it's perfectly okay and to have it nicely displayed we could type print and the text we've escaped single quote now let's move to something more complicated building types could have some special superpowers they called methods and they could do some magic with your object in this scenario the text for example let's say we want to make a text uppercase there is a method our magic spell called upper that could be run on any text to make it work we type dot after our text than upper and opening and closing parentheses like this our methods our magic spell worked we'll talk a little bit more about methods later on in this series next videos so don't worry about it in Python there is also something called function and we'll talk much more about it also in next videos but now let's see some very easy function that we can use with text let's say we want to know how many letters the text we just typed have we can use their function Len so let's type this then open parenthesis our name and close parentheses and it karateka counted number of letters make sure to play with builtin types just learn about integers in text see what's possible see what costs the errors and actually this brings us to the next thing I want to talk about the errors we already serve some of them right we serve syntax errors and neighbors so let's have a closer look now but first let's generate some error so let's use function land with not text but integer like 200 now we try to count characters of something that is not text but it's a number so it'll resulted in an error if you want to learn how to code it's very important to learn that errors are your best friend and they will tell you what's problematic what it's not working yet they are important so we need to learn how to read them this time we get type error might assess that object of type integer has no length in the line above it it says where there ever happened in nine one errors are important and I think it's a worthwhile to create a little cheat sheet for you like the look of notebook so you take all the errors you see and write them down and write a little explanation what the error means like in case of syntax error Python is telling you that it does not understand what's going on so there is a problem with the syntax so you for example miss type something or in case of name error Python says that it does not know what something means so it's not miss type but there is something unknown which is different so for example when you have a variable that is not defined yet then Python will throw this error yes but what is the variable you ask and this brings us to the next point I want to talk about today variables are one of the most important concepts in all programming languages remember all this map formulas for example for area of the square containing letters instead of numbers thanks to this formulas for example for area of square no matter how big the other square was one meter or 2 meters or 100 meters you know how to calculate the earlier of that so our formula a multiple a contains a variable a is a variable so it is a name name for a concept like a member of the side of our square sense of variables it's extremely important in computer science it allows you to define the certain formulas or steps you need to follow no matter what its actual value for example if we would like Python to say hi to the user no matter who is daser and was the same at the user we could do that we could create a formula that does that so far to make items say hi to you we need to type the whole text like hi Ola Atwood if I want to make it work for any name like Mary or release its Allah is the same then what we really want to do is say hi and then the name so we could split our text in hi + oh now let's replace all that with variable name we'll have 5 + name her name is the variable we actually could run it for any value that is stored in variable it will be beliefs Mary Barbara or Sonia or anything else we created something abstract something credible and this is quintessence of computer science create formulas create steps that could be reused with different values we provide to our computer ok but let's try it in our Python interpreter if we type now hi + name there is an error it's name error that means that variable name is undefined what does it mean it means that there is no value provided in name variable yet variable is empty it's there is nothing there to run it properly without error we need to define value for the variable we need to put some actual value to the variable name let's do that we do that by assigning the value using equal sign so we type name equals hola so no name stores value hola we could run a now our code PI plus name and it worked obviously good question why writing name equals hola and then hi first name is better than to simply this hi hola variables similarly to their usage in macro millas will be extremely useful later on when we talk about methods and function will be able to extract many steps many things in one function and use that no matter what is the value want to operate on one of the side which is very very important is also readability of the code if we use good names for our variables we actually know more what we try to do in our code for example if you would like to calculate area of a square we could have in code simple to multiple to which means nothing to us it's just two numbers we multiply so it could be anything but if we have this area equals side multiple by side we actually know that we are calculating area of something using formula for re L square that is why one of best practices for all the programmers to name variable nicely it's very hard at times and a lot of programmers struggle with that but make sure to take some effort and name variables in some meaningful way but wait what happens with the variables that already have some volume for example we have their names that contains text hola can we reassign that can we put something else there the answer is yes okay so let's type name is Ola now when we check what is the value of the variable name its hola let's try to redefine which means change volume of the variable we use equals sign and to assign the value so name is Liz now the current value of the variable is this and the previous name hola is gone so the value of the variable is the last thing we assigned using equal sign that means that this name equals hola main equals sonia name equals marie will result in named variable containing the last name so name will be Chris Mary time to learn next building type in Python we already learned about integers and texts now it's time for lists to create empty lists we open and close square parentheses emptiness is not very interesting so let's create a list of notary numbers we will put our list in a variable so we don't to write the lottery numbers every single time we want to use that summons define lottery s we open square parentheses and then free comma 42 comma 12 the 1913 59 lottery variable contains our first nonempty list now we can do number of things with this list for example check how many numbers we have in this list by using a function you already learned then we could also use some methods the magic powers of the given building type this for example could be sorted if you want our numbers to be sorted from the lowest to highest number we could do that with sort method like this lottery dot sort wait but it does not print anything right the thing is that our list under the motor is variable to change in place so it would print lottery now with print from lottery you will see that our list have been nicely sorted for us what do you want to have our list reversed and we have next handy method next superpower of list building time and it's called rivers let's see this in action which I have lottery don't reverse and then print the variable lottery it's perfectly reversed you could also add something in the end of the list there is another method for it called happened so let's try it lottery dot append 100 and let's print a lottery number 100 is added at the very end of the list okay all these methods all the special powers of building types aren't very handy but how do you know what's possible and what's not to know all methods that Python as a language provides for all builtin types you just need to go to their Python documentation and just visit this page and check the documentation okay so once back to our list one of the most important abilities of each list is to being able to refer to the elements of the list by its index what is that index it's the number that says what is the position element in the sequence so remember I would not very variable right if you would like to see only the first element of the list we could print it with this print rotary index zero why zero well in computer science we index things from zero instead of one so the first element is under zero the second under one and so on it might be very confusing just follow the sputter and it will be natural for you it's some time okay so we already said that we can add 11 to the least what do you want to delete the element and not any element but a certain element given index you would like to delete for example 40 from the list which is a third element so we've indexed to we'll do it like this del notary index 2 now when we print our lottery variable will have the list not containing 13 now let's play a little bit more with lists what if we try to print the element of the lottery variable that has index that is too high for example 1000 only has now 6 elements but let's try to ask feyten what is the element under index 1000 so we will print lottery with index 1000 you get a new type of error this is index error if you get this error it means you try to access something what is not there and your list is not big enough of course list could contain not only numbers we could have lists of text like this names is all our list and Sonja or list of elements of different types like mix is a la 7 and the list of 1 2 3 ok we learned a lot I'm sure you are totally exhausted it's a lot a lot of knowledge in one go there will be much more in next video and don't be afraid just practice whatever you learn today play with Python interpreter see what you can do with integers if texts see different kinds of errors and now that just sum up what we learned so far we learn how to start by the interpreter from command line we also learn there is something called building types and they are used represent values for example tax for numbers we also learned free building types so far integers strings and lists we also learned what is the variable how to use that and how we can print it finally we learned that feyten informs us that something is wrong and we learned how to read errors in Python it's a lot of knowledge so make sure you feel comfortable with whatever we learned so far if you want to learn more about python basics make sure to subscribe my channel and stay tuned have a lovely day and see you
