hello everyone I'm Ola and this is SCS for girls today as promised I will show you how to write your own custom functions in Python but first we need to answer the question what is a function we all remember functions from math and all the complicated formulas for example the one that calculates the area of the square maff defines function as a relation that associate a set of possible inputs into a set of the possible outputs but that's to abstract for us so let's take a look at functions from the real word point of view for example how to make a cup of tea you will need a cup a teab buug water to to make it so you'll take a capup put tea back inside your cup and then boil the water and pour it inside then you wait until the water changes color take the tea back out and your tea is ready there are quite a few steps to make a tea R and each single step is even more detailed as you can see in real world we already use the shortcuts to Define certain algorithms for example how to make a tea so what is a function in computer science it is it's a nice way to Puck all the steps into one nice thing one block of code and then reuse it for any values you will provide any combination of cup teab back and water okay let's go back to python so how we Define the function each function in Python starts with the keyword def it means that python will know that we are starting to define the function then we need to provide the name in this scenario we will call call it make tea now we can provide some input to the function our capup teabag and water then we can close parentheses and type colon as we already know colon means that we are starting to Define Block in Python and then we can Define all the steps for our function we just need to remember that in Python we Define a block with indentation let's open a file in our code editor and let's start with some super easy function first to start defining function we type def then we give it a name for example hi this function will simply greet you now we open parentheses here should come all the arguments all input we want to have but in this scenario we don't want any so we can go ahead and close it with parenthesis again now it's time for column and we are ready to define body of our function what we want to do here is is to print hi there and in the next line how are you note that we have the same indentation so both lines are inside the function now let's try it in console we save the file and run it in console like this Python 3 and then the name of your file in my case it's python intro remember to be in the correct folder when running it from console we need to be in the very same place as our python intro file in my scenario it's desktop if you feel lost make sure to watch my previous python videos if we run it now nothing happens why is that this is because function is an algorithm or a sequence of steps it's like a difference between describing how to make a t and actually making one let's open the file and execute the function High we do that typing name of the function in this scenario Hi and then parentheses if we had any arguments we would need to give them here function High expects to get nothing so we could close parentheses and save the file now let's go back to the console and type python free and then name of our file this time we have hi there how are you displayed okay but let's write a function that takes some input some ARG arents it would be nice if our high function is saying High using the name of the person right let's open python intro file again and let's change the file we will add name as a parameter we will place it inside parenthesis now let's remove the body of the function and try it once again from scratch let's say that in this function we would like to check if the name is Ola and then print hiola or if the name is Sonia use hi Sonia greeting or say hi Anonymous overwise if that sounds unfamiliar make sure to look at my previous video about conditions in Python okay let's start if name equals Ola We will print hiola L if name equals Sonia print hi Sonia and else print high Anonymous now it's time to save and check how our program runs in console we go back to console and run once again Python 3 python intro uhoh there is an error but as I already said it errors are your best friends so let's take a look it says that in line 10 we forgot to add argument to function High it even gives us name of the argument that's awesome let's fix it then we go back to console and run once again congrats you just created your very first function that takes argument and makees something meaningful with it but let's go one step further let's say we always want to say hi and the name of the person let's delete the body of the function with this complicated if statement and write instead print high plus name plus exclamation mark and then let's call it with some other name for example Rachel let's say the file and run it in console python free python intro it printed correctly High Ral as we wished now it's time to experiment a little bit more what if we want to write some mathematical function we could create a function that calculates area of the square we can add a function in the very same file under definition of high we'll type def ARA so the name of our function then in parenthesis we will provide the argument the input in this scenario it will be side of the square then in the body of the function we will print side multiple side so mathematical formula of the area of the square now we could call the function with different length of side of the square for example area with argument two or area with argument four let's remove calling High to we don't want it displayed for now let's save the file and go back to the console let's type Python 3 python intro and we got values of area of square with side two and one with side four the last thing I want to show you is returning values so far our functions were just printing values on the screen but what if the value is more important and we want to use that to some further calculations for this very reason we have a keyword return let's modify our ARA function and instead of print site multiple site we will replace it with return side multiple side now let's save the file and run it in the console nothing is displayed of course we did not print anything here but we could do it in the moment we call the function let's change area of two into print of area of two now we are printing the thing that function area returns to us when we run now the script we will get for printed okay let's go one step further let's store the value that is return from the ARA function in a variable called small square area and use this value as a argument to the area function again so we will get big Square AR area let's type small square area variable and assign the value returned from calling area function on argument two then in big square area variable we will stall the result from area called with argument small square area and finally we will print big square area now let's save and run it in the console python 3E python intro that's correct this is super exciting now you can write as many functions as you want and use the values returned from them to run in other functions for example what you could do is write one function that is taking the name and make all the characters in your name capitalized and return it and then use the result of that into your high function so in the end you will say hi and the name that will be capitalized functions are very important important in computer science and they are not easy to write but with a little bit of practice I'm sure you will very soon know how to write nice functions and you already know the basics next thing I want to show you is also super exciting it's Loop this is something that gives us even greater control in our program but for now I hope you enjoyed this video
