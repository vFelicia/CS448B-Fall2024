hello everyone I'm Olaf and this is shouting is for girls last time we talked about fighting basics we learn about three building types in Python texts integers and lists and today we're gonna talk about next building type of dictionaries similarly to the list it's more complicated structure that stores multiple values but instead of accessing them by their positions of the index we access that by P ok it sounds really abstract so we need an example when you want to call your friend what you need is her phone number so you open your phone the phone book and look for your friend's name and the number is under the name the name of your friends is a key and the number is the value stored in dictionary so if you compare it with the list we learned in the last episode you'll notice that we are accessing the phone number not by the position in your phone book but by the key so by the name of your friend so if you compare with the list we learn in the last episode you see that instead of knowing that exact position in the list you have a little shortcut your key so we can jump exactly to the place you want to be ok so even we start our phones in the list like this we would need to know that own of our friend Marta is under index free but if we use dictionary we just need to know her name Marta and we'll find the correct number immediately okay it's about time to play with dictionaries in Python open Python interpreter let's create an empty dictionary we do that by using curly brackets like this let's create a dictionary that actually contains some data for example let's create a variable with phone numbers okay that's it we just created a dictionary that contains four phone numbers similarly two lists values in a dictionary could be different stops let's say we would like to create a dictionary with informations about lottery participants we would like to store information like name of the person country phone and person's favorite numbers if we would use list for that we could store the information in a list like this but now when we would like to check their country of the person we would need to remember that country is under index it's not easy to remember and making mistake is very easy here but if we use dictionaries it will become much nicer we will add a key to each element the first one is person's name though the country and finally favorite numbers but then each per key and value is defined the way we first start the key name then and value here it will be named Ola then when we want a second birth this time country and Poland we needed to use comma separated from the previous birth and type again key first colon and value after that now let's add phone and numbers to now let's see if we could access follows easily for example would like to know what is the participant name we type print participant open square parentheses name is our key and close parentheses so the way the axis value is very similar to the list but instead of accessing using index we use let's check the country now neat okay but what happens when you ask Python for the value of the key that is not in the dictionary let's try and see for example we don't have any key called age in our current dictionary if a minute ago you thought that fighting will arise error you were right we have new type of error this time it's a key error that tells you that there is no given key in the dictionary in this case a key age okay let's think about other things for example what happens if you define the same key twice in the same dictionary for example we will create action area like this with name defined twice one with Cola and one with lace what do you think would happen will have error well let's hit enter and find out this time will have no error but does it mean that peyten saved all the values let's bring the dictionary as you can see will lost the first definition for a key name containing Cola it works a little bit like variables whatever stores last will stay in a dictionary in our scenario with the find name list as the last thing so that will be saved in dictionary okay but when we should use this and when dictionaries in Python code then if you need to store data that are a sequence of items and order is very important then using list is the most natural choice for example if you have a list of people you want to phone then storing that in list like this hola Marta and lace makes the most sense however if you want to store values the way it is easier to access data and order is not that important storing values in dictionaries like in the phone book is a better choice I'm sure after some experiments and writing a little bit of more code you will have a better intuition when to use which one there are other similarities between lists and dictionaries for example both are mutable well what does it mean basically it means that once you created one in the list or dictionary you still can change values you can add them you can delete them and you can change existing ones with that like this will add favorite language key to our participant dictionary now when we print the participant favorite language is one of the values similarly to lists and strings you could use function land on dictionary let's try it on participants yeah the result is 5 so basically it tells us how many pairs key and value our dictionary stores at the moment similarly to lists we could also delete element using though like this the participant favorite numbers now favorite numbers are no longer in the dictionary finally let's check how to change value of the certain key for example let's change country from Poland to UK we do that like this participant country assign UK now let's check our dictionary and yes it contains UK instead of Poland now that was exciting I really love that something as simple as dictionary you see so much power if you want to learn a little bit more about dictionaries in Python visit the link I am displaying right now and read a little bit more it's very fascinating you can learn more about building function in dictionaries what is possible and what is not we already learned how to store values things like text integers how to store things lists and dictionaries which is awesome but what if you want to do something more in my next video I will talk about comparing things I hope you enjoyed this video and if you want to learn how to program with me and don't miss any of my next videos make sure to subscribe my channel and stay tuned have a nice day and see you
