hello everyone I'm Ola and this is coding is for girls last time I promised you that I will talk a little bit more about by them and one of the things you requested is talking about wine lips I have this love/hate relationship with while loops in any programming language on one hand they are so useful in some situation on other and they are very tricky sometimes and they might cost you some headaches while statement in Python is an expression that allows you to repeat some code until some condition is not met anymore the syntax of while loop looks as follows while expression colon and the body where expression is anything in Python that is evaluated to true or false in a way while live and for loops are very similar because in puff scenarios we are repeating some chunk of code many times the difference between while and for loop is in the fact that in for loop we are doing some piece of code for every element in the list or set but in piece of while we are repeating that over and over again as long as condition is met and they know that it might seem complicated right now but worry not I hope that it will be much clearer in a moment let's say we want the program that asks us a question and expects us to answer yes or no and we want this program to be smart enough to know that if we responded with anything that is not yes or no for example if we type Ola or one then program will ask the question again and expect us to provide the answer once again let's open code editor and create a file called wilder file let's start with no question we would like to ask in variable question so let's type question equals are you polish then we would like to specify possible answers we will store them in variable possible answers in a list like this so we will type possible answers yes No now what we want to do is to display the question we can do that with print like this print from question and then we want to display all the possible answers which we store in the list so we will need for it up here since we want to do something for it 11 in the list and it will look like this for possible answer in possible answers print possible answer now we want to know what user responded and we'll store user provided value in an answer variable like this answer equals input and we'll have some greater than signs okay let's save and run in the console item free wild goodbye if we type yes program finishes as expected however if we run the program again and we type hola instead of yes or no the program stops again which is wrong what we really want to do here is to make sure that user is funded in either yes or no but how to do that we will use file up obviously let's open the world to the PI file again and drop this lines within while loop statement lets up while answer not in possible answers this will check if whether user typed is indeed either yes or no everything in this flock will be repeated as long as the condition in wild live is true let's save and run in console python 3 while to the PI and we have an error peyten says that answer is not defined and if we open our file again will indeed see with boot or assign some value to the answer only in mine mine where as we try to use it in line for for the first time it's a little bit too early we need to have some value first one of a solution here is just copypaste everything we have in wire loop and copy that before the while so at least was assign value to answer but this is not good because we repeat the code we could do better and one of the solutions here is to make sure that the variables is somehow set and what we can do in Python is set it to the empty value which is known so we kind of say to python that we are aware that there is no model yet but it will come later on so don't panic everything is under control I prefer the second solution so before while I will simply write answer equals known some known as you remember means that the value is empty now we can save and run it in the console again write in three wilder file now when we type allows an answer the question will be repeated as we wanted let's try something else for example one and we will click enter the same we cannot go past this point but if we now type no the program will finish this is very handy because this way you can ensure that these are responded with some meaningful for you value and if you might challenge number two in one of my previous video and I will leave the link in the description below if you haven't seen that you probably suspect how this might be very useful for this challenge okay but I think we need more examples of wire loops and at the beginning of this video I said that there are in a way very similar tool for them and the thing is that every for loop you can translate into wire loop unfortunately the other way around is not true let's see how to do that we will create a file called for to wildfire Android a for loop like to translate into oil first and let's do something very simple for example for loop that breeds a greeting for each person in the list so we will start with defining the list of names and let's say we will store it in periodic old people so we'll write people equals and in the list Rachel Monica and Phoebe now we will write for person in people Colin and then in the body will print hi and then the name of the person and we'll use format method so we'll have dot format person it's me run our program in the console so we will type Python 3 4 1 2 5 will have three rows saying hi Rachel hi Monica and typing in ok let's write the program that does pretty much the same but with the while loop in case of for loop we use the syntax for person in people so we do stop for every single element in the list but in one loop this syntax is not allowed ok let's write the program that does exactly the same but using go a loop in case of for loop what we did was iterating over people list so we wrote for person in people and we did something for every single person in the list but in walnut we can't do the same because the syntax is not allowed in a while we expect to have expression that evaluates to either true or false but there is a way to do that kind of manually if you watched my video about lists you might remember that every single element in the list has special number index so index is something that says what is an order of the list so in this scenario for example the index 0 is for Rachel Monica is under indexed 1 and he'll be under index 2 so we always start from index 0 and idea of the index will be very useful here because inside the wild you can just take the index and go step by step incrementing that let's say we will start with index 0 then we would like to start our while loop we would like to see if the index is not bigger than the length of the list we use Python building function then to check how many elements list contains so we type Len and here the name of the list people now inside we will print our greeting to fetch name of the person will type people from index ok that's done let's delete 4 from the file and let's save and run in the console Python free for to wild at 5o something is very very bad the program prints hi Rachel over and over again and keep working and working and it doesn't want to stop this is bad and I think I need to kill the program using force I will type ctrl + C to kill it completely so what happened why program does not stop the thing is we fell into infinite loop and let's look step by step what happens here to understand that better at first index is 0 and in the condition in while we are checking if that is slower than the number of people and it is true because Europe is lower than 3 so we print higher and the name of the person under index 0 so that is Rachel now we finish the body of 1 so we go back while and we check the expression but our index is still 0 and it's still lower than 3 so we go inside and print hi Rachel again and then we go once again to while loop and check the condition it's still 0 this is why we are repeating the same thing over and over again index is not trained over time so to make our program work we need to make sure that index is bigger every time we run through the body of the while loop so what we just need to do is the index equals index plus one now in every step we'll increment our index and move forward in a list so at first we start with index zero which is lower than free so we print the first person in the list people so we'll print hi Rachel now we are incrementing index from zero to one we go back to the condition in Wilder now index is one one is still no more than three so we print this time we take a person with the indexed one which is Monika so we print hi Monica and increment the index so now it is equal to we go back to check the expression in while loop index is 2 2 is still lower than 3 so we can print hi now the person under index 2 so Phoebe finally we increment index again and now it is free and it's no longer lower than free so we no longer go inside the body of the while loop and we can proceed with the rest of the program let's go back to our file and add the missing index implementation role of save and run in the console this time it worked we successfully translated for loop into what this example was fun because I had a chance to show you why while loop gets a little bit thunderous and with some small mistake where you can end up in infinite loop in this scenario finding the problem and finding the mistake we did inside while loop was very easy but very often when you use while loop and you have much more complicated code inside you can find yourself in a really really scary place and to prefer if you want to do something for every single in a set or list juices for loop so much easier but I also hope that with the first example when the program forces you to provide one of the allowed values yes or no I'm sure that there are also times when using while loop is much better choice and it's more natural so if you are interested and you want to learn how to program with me make sure to subscribe this
