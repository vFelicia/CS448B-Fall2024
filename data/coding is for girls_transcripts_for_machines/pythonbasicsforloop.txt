hello everyone I'm Ola and this is counting is for girls I hope you had fun learning Python with me so far if you are here for a first time make sure to look at my previous video in a correct order to make any sense out of this video I created a playlist so you can just go there there is a link in description below and watch them in a correct order also make sure to visit Jungle Girl tutorial I already put all the links to this video out there so you can follow those steps there and look at the videos simultaneously the link to the drama girls tutorial is in the description below ok today we will talk about something exciting loops what is loop similarly to the if statement it is something that allows us to control flow in programming in case of its statement we could decide which line is executed depending on the condition in case of loop we will be able to repeat the same steps many many times for every single element in it even set or until some condition is not generals programmers are very lazy and don't like to write the same code many times there is even a famous try principle don't repeat yourself and thanks to that you will write something only once and use it whenever possible so if you need to change it at some point of time you don't need to go over 400 occurrences and chained it for every single place for example if we have a list of girls like this so invariable girls we will have Rachel Monica Phoebe and Ola and we would like to breed them using a function hi we created when talking about functions we could do that like this hi Rachel hi Monica hi Phoebe and viola then when we save it and run it in console titan3 and the name of the file would have all of hi and names printed however we could use loop to write it in a more compact way and thanks to that it will be very easy to create for women as well as for a hundred to define loop in Python we'll use another keyword this time is a keyword for we will write it as follows 4 then we'll choose name of the variable here simply name then we will write keyword in and after that we will place our list stored in variable girls then there comes as you already know means that we define a block so next line needs to be indented now we'll call function high with name variable as an argument let's run it the result is the same but what this for in structure really means it means that for each element in a set or list in this scenario for each name of the girl we will assign girl name to the variable name and execute everything in the block here huhai let's say it stepbystep at the beginning we assign rachel to variable name now inside the body we use variable name and call function hi we've named Rachel then the loop finishes and we go back here at this point we assign the value Monica to name and we call hi with this next we go back and assign name Phoebe to name and call hi and finally we do the same with name hola this is what is called flow control we keep repeating the same lines of code for every single element in the list okay but what happens when we don't have a list for example if the variable girls contains number four not the list let's try it for name in four color print name now let's save and check in the console Python free Python intro to the file we get an error it says that integer is not big trouble basically loop expects us to give it something that contains elements is that list dictionary number is not like that it has no inner items so for loop cannot work with that let's try loops with dictionaries then we'll create one like this person with name equals hola height 155 centimeters favorite language Python and now we will iterate over the dictionary using loop so we will type for element in person so the variable name and then print element now let's save it and run in the console that's interesting in case of dictionaries what we have printed is not a pair key and value but only a key how we could access the value of them we could use one of the builtin methods for the dictionaries and access them directly the method is called values so we could write for element in percent values print element let's save and check in the console we could also access both key and value at the same time by using the builtin method items on dictionaries so for element in person items print a land that looks nice okay this time we got Paris but we can go one step further and on level of loops we could extract key and value and use it in nicer way we will use two variables this time so we will always assign key names to variable K and the value stored in a dictionary in the variable called volume then we will print person now we need to escape special character as we talked about it in my videos about strings then we add key but since we don't know if the key is text or number or anything else we need to make sure that we convert it into that we use builtin function STR for it then we type is now it's time to print value once again we use STR function to make sure we have text now let's save and try to run it in the console that looks nice if you wonder what would happen if we remove STR around volume we can try it now now when we save and run it will have a type error saying that we cannot add a text to the number finally let's look at the very useful Python building function called range it generates a given number of integers for example if you would like to have integers from 1 to 10 instead of writing them by hand like this for a number in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 we could write for number in the range 1 11 so basically anything between 1 and 10 would print a number now we can save and run it in the console and see numbers printed from 1 to 10 oh wow that was intense make sure to experiment a little bit more with libs in Python also visit this link to the Python documentation I will put this link in the description and next time we'll make something fancy we will make it possible to read values provided in the console to a program so here as a user will be able to pass some values to your program and then operate over it if you enjoyed this video and you want to learn
