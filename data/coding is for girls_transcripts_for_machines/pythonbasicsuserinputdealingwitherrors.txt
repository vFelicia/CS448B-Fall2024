hello everyone I'm Ola and this is coding is for girls as promised in my last video today I will show you some fun things today we will learn how to make it possible to allow user who is running your program to provide the value and then use it in our program while we'll talk about it we will also learn something very very useful in programming which is try accept Clause okay so without any further Ado let's open our code editor and start coding we already have function High we wrote in one of the previous episodes so far when we run it we had to call it in the end of the file like here we we have high Ola what we would like to do instead is to wait for user to give us a value and then run it with the text she provides the first thing we need here is to be able to read the value that the user is typing in programming jargon we say that we are reading from standard input python has the buildin function that does that and it's called input it basically waits for user to type something until the user clicks enter and then it just reads the whole line okay let's try it in our file we will replace hiola with input function the function takes one argument it will act as prompt for the user so she will know what to do let's say we would like to print what's your name and then maybe some greater signs so we know where to type we also want to store The Returned value from input in a variable named line finally we will call High function with the value from the input so from the line time to save the file and run it in the console what's your name text is displayed now and the program waits for you to provide a value so it haven't finished yet we can now type the name I will just type Ola and click enter hello Ola is printed now and the program is finished well done isn't that awesome you just created the program that expects user to provide the values and you are operating over these values and producing some output not knowing what the value will be this is a real programming you just get stuff from the user and and then do something with that okay let's try something similar but with the function that calculates the area of the square we wrote it when talking about functions I have a code stored in the square. pi file so I will open it and we will change it to use input now we would like to do the same as with our high function we will type input and then text let's say we want to print provide length of the square side we will store the value from the input in a variable called side finally we will call the area function with the value stored inside variable let's save and run it in the console so we type Python 3 squar Pi there is an error it says that it's impossible to multiply to text the thing is that input function in in Python is reading everything that user types as a text so as a string but our function expects to get a number so we can multiply it side by side so to fix it we would need to make sure that the text from the user is somehow transformed into the number and obviously python knows how to do that there is nice function called float that will take our text and change it into number let's try it in area function we will type float from side and assign it back to the side variable now this variable have value returned from the function float with argument with old value of the side so we sent number as a text to the float method and it is returned as number and assigned to variable side let's save and run the script again when we are asked to provide number we will type for and click enter it worked we got an area of the square with side of length for calculated for us but wait a minute what happens if the user makes the mistake and instead of typing the correct number she will type something different for example her name let's run our program again but this time we will try writing name I will write Ola instead of providing the number there is an error what happened well float function in Python expects to get text that you could somehow change into number transforming Ola into number is not possible and python complaints and in the programming jargon we call this complaining Rising an error ER or exception in this scenario value error was rised saying that transforming Alla text into number is not possible but what to do now then we don't want our program to crash anytime user type something that we don't expect to get it would be so much nicer to print some nice message so the user know what to do for example display the page saying this is not a number please rerun the program here comes the fun part python has something called try accept statement and if you wrap the code that you suspect might cause the error or exception in this try accept part you would be able to do some things when this error actually occurs to do that we start with typing try keyword and then colon we will start now a block of code the code we had so far that was converting text into number so float from side will be now inside this block so we need to indent it like this we will also indent the next line with print then we will type accept keyword this time not indented here we tell python if there is an error jump here after that you need to specify what kind of error or exception you are suspecting to get here we will type Val error as that was exactly the problem we encountered previously trying to convert text Ola into number then we will add column so we are starting the block of code again and this code will be executed only when the error happens and in the block of code we will type print this is not the correct number try to run the program again this time it's a success we have this is not the correct number try to run the program again print it congrats you just wrote your first program that deals with the user errors this is awesome and if you wonder what happens if you forget to add accept part and you just go with your program without having accept value error and then the block defined then please try now and see what happens what kind of error will you get will it be syntax error or maybe something else and if you have the code that might be very problematic on many levels you could catch different kinds of Errors you already SE quite a few of them and if you want to do something different depending on the error you can totally do that if you are interested in errors and exceptions in Python you should go and visit the python documentation page and read a little bit more about them I will put this link in the description below so we can check that later that's it for now you just learn how to read and use the value provided by user when the program is executed you also learn how to deal with possible errors I hope you enjoyed this video and if you want to learn how to program with me make sure to subscribe this Channel and stay tuned have a lovely day see you n
