hello everyone I'm Ola and this is goting is for girls so far we learned a very basics of Python programming language and if you feel lost you should not worry it's normal there is a lot of knowledge you need to absorb and it takes time lately when I was uploading one of my python basic videos someone pointed me out that I'm leaving you links to the python documentation and the thing is that python documentation is very technical and it's very very hard for beginners to make any sense of that that is why I decided that I will dedicate whole episode just talking about python documentation how to use it how to find information you are looking for for and what the things described there means first thing to remember is that when you start to Learn Python there is absolutely no obligation for you to read whole python documentation and it is so so weak that I doubt that any person any programmer out there actually read everything from the very beginning to the end maybe there is somebody there but I don't know them so it is not about learning every single thing that is described in Python documentation but it's about knowing how to use Python documentation when you are looking for something you could treat python documentation as a language dictionary when you learn new language you don't need to know every single word in given language and I bet even native speakers don't know every single word in their native language it's all about knowing enough words to make you fluent and then being able to look up whatever is missing for you okay so first thing where is python documentation python docs are available online and you can access them anytime you need you just need to go to the www.python.org this is the website managed by python software Foundation an organization that takes care of python as a programming language now let's click in doc stop and here it is python documentation in top left corner there is a drop down that allows you to change between Python versions python is updated regularly but there are a lot of people who are not using the newest version out there and a lot of people use older versions so it's very very important to know what version of python you are using and check the documentation if you followed my videos step by step it should be 3.4.3 but if you jumped somewhere in the middle then you might have different version installed let's open the console and type Pyon three minus minus version and click enter as I mentioned my version of python is this one however I have also installed another one that my Mark is using to if I type this python space minus minus version and click enter you'll see that my default python version is 2.7.1 okay we know what version of python we are using let's go back to documentation I switching to 3.4 version and now I see all relevant things for me there is a link to all the things that were added in Python 3.4 compared to the previous version 3.3 we also have link to tutorial and this one might be very interesting for you because it introduces all parts of python for example using python interpreter things we already talked about like numbers text lists different control flows tools including if statements and for Loops you already know then you could read about functions and data structures models errors classes and so on and so on this part will be very useful for you right now but there is also another important link which is language reference this gathers more advanced and more ordered topics for now let's go back to tutorial part and look at the something we already read about for example if statement on the left hand side we have a table of content for this page but what I do most of the time is using search in my browser I just click command and F or control and F if you don't use my and just type whatever you are interested in for example text else and all occurrences are highlighted so I don't need to read everything on the page in green boxes you have code examples this is extremely useful and shows you how to use given thing here we see example usage of if Al if else statement python documentation might be scary because it uses jargon a lot and it's very technical it also assumes that you know a lot already it is like learning any language out there you don't need to know every single word in a sentence and what matters is to understand the general concept if you don't really know what things means try to find code examples run it in your python interpreter try to figure out what's going on there and go back to the documentation and maybe it will make much more sense then okay let's go back to documentation let's leave tutorial and go to the language reference let's say we would like to read more about building types we already know some of them for example string I will be lazy and look at the page using my commment f shortcut and type build minus in now I see that section number four contains informations about building types and there is a sequence text part under 4.7 subsection let's click and see first we see explanation what string is it might seem a bit complicated right now then if we scroll a little bit down we see string Methods section remember when we talked about building methods of the string we used upper method that was changing all the characters in our text into uppercase now we can see and read about all the available methods on the string we can use not only upper or or lower there so many different ones let's look for example on method called capitalize Str strr part here means that this is a part of building type string then the Bold part is the name of the method here we have capitalize that means that we will use it like this our text for example name Ola and then dot so python knows we will access part of the textt type then then we type name of the method so capitalize finally we will use opening and close parentheses methods act similarly like functions but they are attached to the certain thing here a string let's read what the capitalize method does it states return a copy of string with its first character capitalized and the rest lower case let's find another examp example let's look for the method called replace this function is taking our text and replace occurrences of the certain smaller text with the same other thing for example if we have longer text like this my name is Ola Ola is a popular name in Poland I had many friends called Ola and we would like to change all occurrences of name Ola into maray we could do that using replace method okay but how we could use this function because python documentation is showing all these weird things in parentheses what these things mean alt and new are Arguments for this method so when you call replace you always need to provide old value so the text you want to replace and then a new value so text you want to replace it with so in our example we'll need to take our text then do replace and in par pareses will first say hola and then marry but what this Square parentheses and the name count means if we have something in a square parenthesis it means we can provide it as an argument to the method but only when we want to so Square parenthesis means that the argument is optional so anything that is not in square parenthesis is obligatory and everything that is inide is optional so for example we cannot type our text. replace and then open and close parenthesis that will fail however we can write replace method without providing count argument so we could have our text. replace Ola and Murray so the python will change all occurrences of Ola in the text and change it into marry or if we would like to change only first two occurrences of Ola into Mary and the last should be left alone we could add the argument count so our text do replace Ola maray and then two okay so we know what Square parenthesis means in Python documentation let's look for something else to explain we will look for another building method called starts with it basically checks if the given text starts with a given string for example if we have text all likes python we could check if the text starts with Ola We already know that starts with is the name of the method and we should use that after our text then we have one required argument prefix this is the text that we will look if the text is starting with in this scenario it's all then there is something weird we already know that that square parenthesis means that argument is optional but what with this inner Square parenthesis the inner Square parenthesis means that it is obviously optional argument but it also means that we can provide it only if the previous optional argument was provided that means we cannot use this function like this we cannot provide and without providing start argument why is that so far we used only functions and method that knew what the given value represents only by the order in which the arguments were given so in Python order of arguments matter so now we type free as a start argument and it means that we will start checking our text from letter in the position free and we will will stop at the letter in the position of six okay time for the last thing I want to show you today that will make you understand python documentation better this thing is named arguments apart from the arguments you need to provide in the correct order for python to know what is what were also named arguments in this scenario you don't need to remember what was the order of them you just used the name of the argument and then python knows what is square how does it look like well let's look at an example this time we will look at the method split this method is dividing a text into small chunks and breaks it using the separator we provide here inside we have named arguments SE and Max spit every named argument need to have default value that is provided after equal sign here sap has default empty value and Max split argument that tells us how many times we want to split our text has value minus one now when we would like to split a text for example www.jco.org and divide it into parts that are between dots then we would use the function like this our text do spit sa equals Dot if we run it we will get a list containing bits between dots but without dots so ww another one will be Jungle Girls and orc now we could provide a Max M value for example one and run it and when we save and run it in console we will get ww and j.org now let's see what happens when we reverse order of the named arguments will it work work so we split text only on the first dot so we will have our text do split Max spit one and sap which is dot this time it worked if you have optional arguments in function or method and you want to have default value and don't want to remember an exact order of arguments you should use named arguments that was quite a few things we already learned about python documentation first of all where to find it then that we need to always use documentation for the correct version of python the version we are currently using then we learned how to recognize if the argument of the function or method is obligatory or it's optional and also we learned about named arguments obviously there is so much more about Python documation and I'm considering having another video on this topic for now I think it's enough to get you started and I hope that next time you will look at the python documentation you will not feel so lost anymore please comment down below if there is something in Python documentation that is very confusing for you uh it will help me to gather information what should I tackle in my next video about python documentation I hope you enjoy this very long video and you feel much much more comfortable with python documentation now if you want to learn how to program with me make sure to subscribe this Channel and stay tuned have a lovely day and see you
