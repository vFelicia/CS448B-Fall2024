hello everyone I'm Ola and this is coding is for girls in this episode we will learn how to read and write files in Python so let's get started we could implement program that is waiting for us to create a file in desktop that is called secret dot texture and then open that read their content and add the line I know your secrets at the very bottom of the file and to make the things simple for us we'll just stick to the text files so we will not have any images or any formatting let's create a file called great secrets to the file what we would like to have is a while loop that is checking if there is a file called secret dot txt on our desktop and we want to check that all the time so in the moment we are creating the file program we'll do something with that and then stop let's start with defining variable we will call it check file and we first assigned true to that value of this variable will tell us if we want to check for existence of the secret dot take step i'll on desktop and as long as this file is true we'll keep repeating that in a while loop now we will type while check file column and inside we want to check if the file really exists inside desktop folder but we don't know yet how to do that in Python and here comes peyten OS model for the rescue but wait what is the model in all my previous videos we kept creating different Python files and they were containing variables and functions and we even splitted some of them into smaller pieces and using from something in word structure we managed to use code from one file in another and model in Python is exactly like this is a file or directory of multiple files containing different variables and functions that we can import and then use whenever we need that and I hope you remember that we did something like this when we talked about functions and I will place the link in the description below so you know which video I'm talking about and to make programmers life even easier Python comes with some stuff that is already written for you and ready to use so called standard modules and if you are curious what is available for you in standard modules make sure to take Python library reference as always link will be in description below but let's go back to earth model or to be more precise Oh s dot path model this model contains a lot of interesting functions that help you to deal with files so what we want to do in our program step one is to check if the secret dot take step file exists in desktop and the good news is that us did path model contains the function that will help us with that it's called exists if we took Viton documentation you will see that this function require one argument path but what is path you ask path is a string that defines the location of a file or a folder if you remember command line video there was a comment called PWD or on Windows that was a city that let us know where on our computer which folder we are in and this will be handy right now for us so let's open command line and navigate desktop CD desktop and now let's type PWD and click enter and since we are in a slash user slash now there is a name of your user slash desktop ok so let's use this value in our program but first we need to import us module so let Phi 2 know we want to use functions and variables from this module and maybe you remember that to import something to let Phi to know how to use code that is outside of the current file we use construction from something import and the name of the thing we want to import but there's also other way and if you want to import everything from the module or the file you just type import and the name of the module and I will newsletter in this case so we will type import OS that means that we are importing Python standard library or module called OS the convention is to do all the imports at the beginning of the file then inside Wilder body we will type OS don't pop dot exists and in the parentheses we'll place the text we just copied from the command line it is called the path now since we want to check it as secret dot takes to exist in this location will add secret dot text are after the slash the end of the path Python documentation states that exist function returns either true or false so let's store the result in some variable let's call it file exists now if the file is there is prints a message so we'll type if file exists print sucribe dot txt a file exists we would like our program to wait until someone creates the file print information that the file exists and closed so all we need to do here is simply set check file to false ok let's save and run in the console Python free read secret stood fire when we click enter right and start running but nothing really happens it goes over and over again inside while loop checking if the file exists let's create the file on desktop that is called secret dot texture I can do it in Auto and as you can see the moment I saved this file my Python program wrote secret don't text a file exists and it closed yay that's the success now the only remaining bit is to open the file read the content and add the line at the very end of the file and open the file we will use Python open function we will use the same path to the file we use to track if the file exists so it's a good idea to store this value in the variable and reuse it so we'll type path to file and then we'll copy paste the path then we will replace text inside exists function with this variable if the file exists we will use open function to open the file so let's type secret file because we want to have this file in the variable equals open path to file now we would like to print everything inside the text file line by line and we can do that like this for line in secret file colon and in the body bold print line so we go row by row and print everything finally since we open the file we also need to close it we do that by typing secret file dot close ok we are done here time to save and run our program in console but first let's add something inside our secrets takes the file I think I will write hello world this is a supersecret file I will also make sure to save now when we run our script in console so I will type Python freed read secret to the file we see that everything from the file was printed congratulations you just learn how to read files in Python but we are not done yet we still need to add I know your secrets line at the very end of the file in Python there is a method write that us to do that let's try that just before the line we are closing the file so secret file dot right I know your secrets cool let's save and try to run it in console Oh No there is an error the error says that file not open for writing well why is that Python open function opens the file in read only mode by default so we cannot write anything to the file and it will take closer look at item documentation for open function will discover that this function has optional argument that defines what kind of operation you want to do with the file either we want to read right appened or maybe a mix of those what I want to do in our program is pretty much just reading and appending to the file so we will need two modes are for reading and ending and this function expects us to write it as R plus so let's add it as a second argument now we will save and run in the console item 3 read secrets to 5 we have a content of the file printed and it will open secret that takes the file again we will notice that the line with I know your secret is added to the file congratulations now let's try everything again let's delete secret takes the phone now we will run our program Python 3 with secret sauce 5 which is waiting for us to create secret stops texture file so time to create one and we will add text like hi there here is my password my password now we see that our Python script worked and printed content on the file and we can see that extra line with I know your secret is there amazing job you just learn how to read and write files and fightin and you can do so many interesting things with that so I encourage you to look at the Python documentation and read a little bit more about files and how to handle them and if you don't want to miss any of my videos and you want to learn how to program with me make sure to
