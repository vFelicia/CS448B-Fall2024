hello everyone I'm Ola and this is coding is for girls in my last video I talked about comparing values and I promised me that next time I will show you how to use that to gain better control over your script when you write program you often want to do certain steps only when certain criteria is met but before we do that I think it's useful to learn how to write longer Python script instead of writing one line at a time in Python interpreter this is where code editor will prove to be handy typically programs are saved and files that are then executed by compiler or interpreter so far we've been using quite an interpreter and typing one line at a time and see the result immediately so today instead of opening quite an interpreter we'll open code editor if you don't have an installed yet make sure to look at the video when I talked about installing fighting and code editor I'll open Adam since I decided to install this code editor but if you installed anything else follow the stuff encoded or of your choice we will create a new file and put some Python code there so let's start print hello world now we want to save the file and give it some descriptive name so it will be easier to find it when we want to execute our program let's call it fightin intro dot apply and save it on the desktop we can name the file anything you want but the important part here is to make sure their file ends with dot py the dot py extension tones operating system that the file is Python executable file and by the interpreter can run it ok we just run our very first Python program in a file and let's see how it run let's open our command line and go to the desktop where we have saved our python file so we do LS then CD desktop and LS now to run the python program we just wrote full type Python free space and the name of the file so python 3 fightin intro to 5 and click enter ok you just draw on your very first Python program and saved it into the file that's awesome you could leave console open for now we will run our python script again and again so it's good to have it open the most awesome thing about it is that we don't need to write everything over and over again instead we can open our file edit it save and when we're all ready we can run it in console ok time to learn some serious stuff very often you would like to do something only when certain condition is met for example in the real life you would like to know if the person is vegetarian or not before serving the meal that contains meat so we would have different option of meal depending on the person being vegetarian or not programming without checking if given condition is met wouldn't be possible so let's see how it's done in fightin fightin use the special construction to do that and it's called it statement what does it mean it means that Python have special keyword if that tells python that we are about to start to compare things ok so let's open our fight an intro file in our code editor and remove the first line let's type our if statement instead it will be if free is greater than 2 if you will save it now and run it in console who will get an error let's try python free Python intro it's syntax error item expects us to give it further instruction if the condition here are free is great in their tune is true ok let's fix it in Python intro file we will type the following in the second line of the file world type print it works what is important here is to notice that if statement has a certain format first we type if keyword then we type our condition whatever we want to check then there is a colon colon informs Python that we are about to start block of code this block will be executed only if the condition will be met the block is defined by indentation every following line that is indented is in the block we typically use for spaces so in our scenario our block will contain only print it works and this will indent it okay time to save the file and check if it works now we go back to console and run our Python program again 3 fightin intro and hit enter now it was executed without errors and since our condition 3 is greater than 2 is true we have it works printed ok but what if we want to do one thing when the condition is met and another if it's not for that fightin comes with Elif and else statements let's edit our file if R is greater than 2 we will print 5 is indeed greater than 2 then we end the block for each statement and we do not indent anymore and type else and color as we already mentioned means we are defining new block so next line will be indented with 4 spaces and we'll print 5 is not greater than 2 if you look at this code you will notice blocks much more clearly first block is executed only when if statement is true second is executed when if statement is false ok let's create something more sensible but we'll remove everything from the file and define variable name this time we would like to store the name for example Sonia in the variable we'll call it name and depending on the value of the name we'll decide what to do so let's say we want to say hi hola if the name is Ola hi Sonia if the name is Sonia and hey anonymous overwise we could use ifelse statement for that but vitam provides something more handy and it's called a leaf it works a little bit like if but it must be put in between if and else okay let's say the action now that's executed in console Python free Python intro and we have hey Sonia because the name is Sonia what happens here is Parton first check the first line of the east statement so check if the name is Ola it's not Sonia so we skip the body for the first if statement and go to the next condition which is in a wave we check if the name is Sonia and it is indeed and we can execute the code in size so we print hey Sonia and then we can just ignore the rest what is important here is notice that we can only print hey Sonia if previous condition is not true you can add as many LF condition as you want and you don't need necessarily to use else but first if statement is must we could add some extra to conditions like this to the file so after checking it the name Sonia we'll just do a live name equals Magda and we'll print hey Magda and L if name equals Marie and print hey Marie one more important thing is to know that we can check different variables and values in every and Alex statement so we don't need to speak with name so for example we could add eight variable so after name is Sonia will type age is 21 let's change the if name is all our to LA and before that who will type if H is lower than 18 and we will print you are not allowed to see this now we will save the file again and run it in console and we have hey Sonia printed ok let's back and change age to 17 save and run it again we will get only you are not allowed to see this printed ok that's it for now today we learn how to write longer by the scripts and save them in a file to be able to execute them later on we also learn about if a leaf and our statement that allows us to check if there certain condition is met and execute some certain things only in that's true next time we'll talk about functions you already know some for example pythons learn function but in my next video I will show you how to write your own one so if you want to learn how to program with me make
