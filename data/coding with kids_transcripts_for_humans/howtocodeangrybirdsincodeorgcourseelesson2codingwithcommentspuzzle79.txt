00:00 - welcome to coding with kids
00:03 - my name is andrew today we're on course
00:06 - eat
00:06 - lesson two coding with comments so the
00:10 - intro
00:10 - instruction says trusty path and lead me
00:13 - to
00:14 - the silly peak a 14g or fetish will fly
00:19 - first we need to move forward then
00:23 - turn right
00:28 - then move forward there's a turn left
00:33 - turn left you already did a turn
00:36 - left whoopsies it's supposed to be down
00:39 - right
00:41 - then turn this then move
00:44 - forward let's go
00:48 - move forward turn right move forward
00:50 - turn left
00:52 - yay this is coding with comments so
00:54 - let's do a comment
00:58 - let's do let's get that silly pig
01:03 - i think we should say that later the
01:06 - bird will get the pig
01:10 - oopsies
01:13 - bird will
01:17 - get the
01:22 - the pig
01:25 - and we code with a comment then let's
01:30 - reset and run so counter will do
01:33 - nothing yeah
01:36 - [Music]
01:38 - now let's continue
01:44 - now the instruction says follow this
01:46 - path to get me to the pig
01:48 - avoiding tnt let's do the comment first
01:52 - let's do get that silly pig
01:57 - get that
02:01 - silly
02:04 - pig then
02:08 - move forward two times
02:14 - turn left
02:17 - then move forward two times again
02:24 - let's run it move forward move forward
02:28 - turn
02:28 - left move forward move forward yay
02:32 - now let's press continue
02:36 - now my instructor says pay attention to
02:38 - the sequence and see if
02:40 - you can figure out how to get to that
02:43 - pig
02:43 - now we have a loop block so it will
02:46 - run the same code you put it in it for
02:50 - five or more times i mean two or more
02:52 - times
02:53 - okay first we need to move forward four
02:56 - times
02:58 - so let's do this four times
03:02 - then turn right then move forward for
03:05 - four times again so the repeat four
03:07 - times do move forward
03:09 - we'll make red move forward four
03:12 - times so it's like making the block
03:16 - a shorter
03:19 - and let's do that comment first
03:23 - i'll get that silly pig i
03:27 - will get that
03:45 - three four yay
03:48 - and that's all for today remember to
03:52 - smash your like and subscribe
03:55 - bye bye bye
