00:00 - welcome to cutting with kids my name is
00:03 - andrew today i'm scratching an angel's
00:05 - account starter scratch
00:08 - so today i'm going to show you my
00:10 - project called cash to dig
00:12 - so first let's see good morning
00:29 - so there are five black squares which
00:32 - are basically holes so this is based on
00:34 - an
00:34 - arc so first we have a digital image
00:37 - called diglett
00:38 - so when griffin collector go to front
00:41 - layer
00:43 - then now set which diglett which is a
00:46 - variable to zero
00:48 - and set the points variable over here to
00:51 - zero to
00:51 - you know height now go to the position
00:55 - and forever play a song then
00:58 - when we have collective forever set
01:01 - which stickler to zero
01:03 - and set which sticker to pick around one
01:05 - to five because there are five
01:07 - diggers so this variable will help us
01:10 - choose which digger will pop out so so
01:14 - pick
01:14 - a random one to five for which degree
01:17 - variable
01:18 - and of course trigger equals one the
01:20 - board has to get one
01:22 - and it's the same for all the other ones
01:24 - but it's one two three four
01:26 - five and the broadcast message just is
01:28 - like
01:29 - one two three four five you know wait
01:32 - two seconds
01:34 - then when i receive they got one because
01:36 - this is the first diglett
01:38 - no show then i'll repeat five times if
01:41 - the key one is pressed
01:43 - and i change points by one and high if
01:46 - you get
01:46 - if you don't press the key one wait 0.3
01:49 - seconds and then it will repeat
01:51 - after 1.5 seconds because three times
01:54 - 0.3
01:55 - is 1.5 seconds it'll hide then
01:59 - it'll choose another digger maybe it'll
02:02 - be the same deal
02:03 - then when you click reset timing because
02:06 - of the time
02:07 - and forever if timer is 60 seconds
02:11 - which is a minute and it will stop the
02:14 - game
02:14 - so you need to see how many points you
02:16 - can get in a minute
02:17 - so that's the same code for the diglett
02:20 - ii
02:20 - the free and take the floor by except
02:24 - that it's different message
02:25 - different positions and yeah
02:29 - okay so there's an also backdrop and
02:32 - there's a pokeball
02:33 - so this pokemon is a sprite and when
02:36 - greenback collector forever go to bed
02:39 - go to mouse pointer i'll always follow
02:41 - your mouse over your hand
02:43 - and it'll it's basically a decoration
02:45 - and this
02:46 - is the board and there are the holes
02:49 - okay
02:50 - so i drew the halls
03:16 - guess which which number to subtract
03:20 - this one is always
03:26 - [Music]
03:35 - [Music]
03:40 - three two one
03:49 - [Music]
03:58 - 5.
04:02 - [Music]
04:26 - this is based on the game where the our
04:29 - face
04:29 - wears you have a hammer and you
04:32 - smash the holes that come out of here
04:36 - master head and the middle one is four
04:42 - [Music]
04:52 - i'm getting used to the numbers five
04:58 - [Music]
05:02 - well that was fun and that's it for
05:05 - today
05:06 - thank you for watching remember to smash
05:09 - like button and subscribe bye bye
