00:08 - this project i made called minecraft
00:11 - so you move a cat and try to eat
00:13 - something
00:14 - so it's um minecraft based
00:18 - so in the cat sprite when green file
00:20 - clicked forever if key right arrow press
00:23 - so if you press the right arrow on your
00:26 - keyboard it will change x by 10 so it'll
00:28 - move right if t left arrow pressed then
00:31 - change x by negative 10 so move left
00:34 - in the grille summon
00:37 - um when greenville click go to random
00:39 - position and set y to 180 so always
00:42 - appear on the top in any position that's
00:46 - the y is 180
00:50 - my green flag clicked it will say score
00:52 - slash fish
00:55 - cat 8
00:56 - which is a variable to zero so always
00:59 - restart your points
01:01 - forever if touching cat
01:03 - the cat
01:05 - will play sound bite until done so it's
01:08 - a sound that i found in the scratch
01:10 - sound library
01:13 - go to rent it will change score by 1
01:16 - and go to random position set y280 so it
01:20 - goes somewhere on the top when green
01:22 - file clicks it will forever change y by
01:24 - negative 5 so it'll fall down if y
01:27 - position is bigger
01:29 - is less than
01:31 - negative 170 then it will go to random
01:34 - position and set y to us that's when
01:36 - they reach the red line
01:39 - green factory is set timer with another
01:41 - variable for
01:43 - 250 so you have a 50
01:46 - time limit 15 seconds forever change
01:50 - time
01:51 - mirror by
01:53 - one so minus one each second because
01:55 - it's a timer
01:57 - when greenpot click forever if touching
01:59 - bottom which is the red line
02:03 - um it will change score by negative one
02:08 - before it falls
02:10 - or else so minus point it will go to
02:12 - random position and set y to 180 when
02:16 - green frog cook forever if
02:18 - timer is zero and
02:21 - the score is
02:23 - less than 15 so
02:25 - if the timer is zero you ran out time
02:27 - the broadcast messages one and wait
02:31 - in raw sum and it has like the same
02:33 - exact code except like set the timer and
02:37 - this codes my grandma click forever if
02:40 - timer equals zero and score is less than
02:43 - 15 and the set timer variable
02:47 - in the bottom there's no code because
02:49 - it's just the bottom
02:51 - um in the trophy
02:53 - when green found click
02:55 - high forever
02:57 - if score fish the cat eight is
03:01 - is bigger than 10
03:03 - and
