00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:04 - andrew today we're in patch kids xr
00:08 - in the art of code mario's secret
00:10 - adventure so we are on step one simple
00:13 - motion your mission move more along the
00:16 - path and collect the core start coding
00:19 - so it's basic so that um appearance is
00:23 - basically mario it in minecraft
00:25 - minecraft character and when you collect
00:27 - the chord so i'm using block code so
00:30 - make mario to reach the golden coin by
00:32 - walking the path attach to move and turn
00:35 - blocks inside when um the run button
00:37 - clicked click on run to the wrong button
00:40 - to run okay screen click
00:43 - yeah so here there are three blocks and
00:45 - morrows on one of them um one of those
00:48 - blank and the coin is on one of them so
00:50 - in this video we'll do steps one two
00:52 - three anyway so when you walk forward
00:55 - and then turn left 90 degrees just
00:57 - basically turn and left and then walk
00:59 - forward one step and then we
01:02 - um collect a coin you can also play a
01:05 - memorial theme song or a song
01:08 - or background just for fun with your
01:11 - chill out okay so now let's get that
01:14 - coin
01:16 - it's so cool
01:19 - yeah congratulations you have completed
01:22 - step one for your secret adventure so
01:24 - here is the javascript version of it now
01:27 - let's continue to step two
01:30 - loop
01:31 - your mission use repeat block to move
01:34 - mario and collect the dimension question
01:36 - this time they're also little white
01:38 - diamonds
01:41 - yeah like a path but you also have to
01:43 - collect
01:45 - repeat blocks are used to run a set of
01:47 - activities again and again using move
01:49 - and turn blocks inside when
01:51 - run collect to make mario reach the core
01:54 - so in one click you can just play
01:56 - a few style we chose um mario queen four
02:00 - but i'm not going to play it yeah okay
02:02 - then repeat three times do repeat three
02:05 - times
02:09 - yeah walk for three steps so
02:12 - i'll do one two three and then
02:16 - turn left 90 degrees and then one two
02:18 - three again
02:21 - one two three and collect your coins you
02:23 - can't repeat it four times two
02:25 - um well not really four times to make a
02:27 - square but you can walk this forward
02:30 - yeah
02:31 - okay
02:32 - let's get all the diamonds and the coins
02:37 - mario must be yeah
02:39 - yeah congratulations you've completed
02:41 - step two of mario's secret adventure
02:45 - final step
02:47 - step three
02:49 - mission use your keyboard buttons to
02:51 - move mario around the past and now
02:53 - there's
02:55 - cool water
02:56 - it's like very wavy yeah okay make our
02:59 - mario move front back when you press up
03:02 - or down arrow keys on your keyboard
03:04 - attach the movement box with the
03:05 - respective keyboard button block so here
03:08 - we have coded it so when up arrow or w
03:12 - key pressed it'll make mario walk
03:14 - forward and then that's the same for the
03:17 - left arrow and a
03:19 - to turn left down arrow and s is for to
03:23 - make mario move backward and right arrow
03:26 - or d
03:27 - it'll turn right
03:29 - so you can also use these arrow keys
03:31 - over here and now we need to control
03:34 - mario to get the coin really you can get
03:38 - all the diamonds if you want but i'm
03:41 - just going to get them
03:43 - i think
03:45 - if you want some fun and like doing it
03:48 - you should not be like when um
03:51 - when w
03:53 - of arrow is pressed move forward maybe
03:56 - do backwards and make it like really fun
03:58 - yeah so it's a little harder to play
04:01 - here because the angle of mario is
04:05 - just very weird it's a little hard to
04:07 - control but i did congratulations you
04:10 - have completed step three of mario's
04:12 - secret adventure so the other steps are
04:15 - in other videos
