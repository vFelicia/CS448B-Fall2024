00:00 - welcome to recruiting with kids my name
00:02 - is andrew today we're going to teach you
00:05 - python today we're going to learn about
00:07 - dictionaries so first
00:08 - we have three dictionaries one called
00:10 - common moths boss mods and uncommon mods
00:13 - so we have the keys as minecraft
00:16 - mod names and then the value is the
00:19 - number
00:20 - of the attack hearts so then we're going
00:23 - to print
00:24 - creeper in commonwealth so it'll print
00:27 - true or false depending if we have
00:30 - creeper key
00:31 - in common mobs let's check so there's a
00:33 - creeper key
00:34 - so pretty true
00:37 - so the true just as i predicted next
00:41 - we're going to do if creepers
00:42 - not incoming moms they don't print it is
00:45 - not here so creepers
00:47 - is not in common laws which means this
00:49 - is true
00:50 - because we only have creeper without the
00:52 - s four esses
00:54 - so print it is not here
00:57 - so it prints it is not here which means
00:59 - creepers is not in common
01:02 - then we have three empty dictionaries
01:05 - called mobs mobs one and mobs two
01:08 - then we're gonna do so this is version
01:10 - one moms.update common moms moms dot
01:14 - update uncommon mobs and then boss
01:16 - then we print mobs so using the update
01:19 - function we can add these free
01:20 - dictionaries
01:21 - into the dictionary mods
01:26 - okay so it added all three dictionaries
01:29 - into
01:30 - mobs so this
01:33 - this version number one of adding
01:35 - dictionaries into
01:37 - another dictionary is okay if you have a
01:40 - few dictionaries because if you have a
01:41 - lot of dictionaries
01:42 - you keep copying and pasting then
01:46 - there's number two you do for each group
01:49 - which is
01:49 - every key and value and
01:53 - then our free dictionaries then we'll do
01:55 - mobs one dot update
01:57 - groups so get the groups from these
01:59 - three dictionaries which is
02:01 - the three dictionaries into our
02:03 - dictionary mobs
02:04 - one so i'm going to create mobs one
02:09 - so now it did the same thing
02:12 - but yeah so this is the other way then
02:16 - we're gonna do number three mom's two so
02:18 - this is the fairway mobs two equals
02:21 - star star common mob star star and
02:23 - common maps and star storm
02:24 - boss mob so star star is unpacking
02:27 - and merging the
02:31 - dictionaries into a dictionary so we're
02:33 - going to print mobs too
02:36 - so it also did the same so
02:40 - no version number three is the best and
02:43 - because it does the least code
02:45 - to add dictionaries into a dictionary if
02:48 - you have more than two dictionaries
02:50 - well that was fun and that's it for
02:53 - today
02:54 - thank you for watching remember to smash
02:57 - the like button
02:57 - and subscribe bye bye
