00:01 - welcome to quitting with kids
00:04 - my name is kalia and my name is andrew
00:06 - today we're in colorado
00:08 - so the instructions say they're
00:10 - multiplying can you make two or more
00:12 - mouse straws appear every time
00:14 - r2d2 gets one mouse draw get 20 mouse
00:17 - draw
00:18 - so one run add a master play rdt
00:22 - to three sound so we need okay
00:27 - yeah but when we touch one of them it
00:30 - just disappears it doesn't
00:31 - do anything so we so let's start
00:35 - okay then we need to do this when you
00:38 - get mouse drawer that means when
00:40 - we touch it add a hundred
00:43 - add a mouse jord so there's another one
00:47 - and or two we can add two
00:51 - yeah okay then play random sound
00:54 - yes so it will play around yourself so
00:57 - right now there's one most mouse droid
00:59 - and let's get it
01:00 - wait it's so fast now there's two
01:04 - more because we touched it
01:07 - so our mission is to get 20 miles and
01:12 - our score is
01:13 - 100 right now so that one yeah
01:18 - we finally got our second one now
01:20 - there's three
01:25 - that um best thing to
01:28 - the hardest thing about them is they're
01:31 - so fast yeah and they go
01:33 - random directions yeah
01:37 - and when i tried to get them yeah
01:42 - now there's four i'll get
01:45 - you let's stop
01:48 - it
01:52 - it seems there's still too little should
01:55 - we
01:55 - add more mouse draws once you touch
01:58 - one let's add three
02:02 - no four okay so this will make it easier
02:06 - yeah because once you touch one mouse
02:08 - draw
02:09 - four more will appear
02:13 - so it's easier for me to catch because
02:16 - there's more
02:18 - but still hard to catch wine
02:26 - is chasing around and i'm going here hey
02:29 - you're still up there girl ah
02:32 - you're tricking me
02:39 - [Applause]
02:43 - come on one touch me yeah
02:47 - now there's a lot so there it will be
02:50 - easier to do
02:53 - whoa uh
02:57 - okay let's stop maybe there's twenty not
03:00 - don't think so yet they're all like
03:04 - going to the same line
03:08 - there's a lot yeah actually
03:11 - when i touch one it gives me let's stop
03:14 - maybe there's 20 not yet
03:18 - there's definitely 20. yeah well done
03:21 - r2d2 let's press continue that was
03:24 - hard now the instructions say
03:28 - time to visit another planet use the new
03:31 - commands to change
03:32 - your droid and its speed then get the
03:34 - rebel pies
03:35 - so right now we have code add a rebel
03:37 - pile so it adds
03:39 - it has free added rebel pie so it has
03:41 - freebie pipes
03:42 - and we're in another planet because it
03:44 - says set random
03:46 - background so the background is a random
03:49 - uh plan but we're slow so we need
03:52 - our speed set joy to a fast speed
03:58 - fast speed and okay
04:01 - now we have a different background and
04:04 - we're faster
04:05 - so we need to get the rebel pilots we
04:08 - i got we got one we got two where's the
04:12 - third one

04:28 - choose the droid
04:29 - right now our jordi's us is always
04:32 - yeah okay
04:37 - random okay so right now we're r2d2
04:40 - again
04:41 - yeah oh random speed i'm slow
04:46 - now i'm very slow how can i catch them
04:48 - oh i'll just set the speed too fast
04:52 - fast okay let's run it oh yeah we have
04:56 - to reset it to run out
04:58 - now we'll see you through yo now this is
