00:00 - welcome to couldn't win kids my name's
00:03 - clea
00:03 - my name is andrew today we're in scratch
00:06 - and in my account today one two three
00:08 - and this is a project i made called
00:11 - bowling
00:12 - soccer ball it's a soccer ball goes
00:14 - boing
00:20 - [Applause]
00:34 - yeah i'm trying to get 10 points you can
00:37 - also get negative
00:38 - negative 10 equals uh
00:45 - okay so soccer ball sprite so you got
00:48 - all the soccer ball goalie and catcher
00:50 - from the scratch
00:52 - collection of sprites and i wouldn't
00:54 - lose
00:55 - you tight i painted it when
00:59 - so first when reflects
01:02 - forever if touching goalie which is this
01:05 - which is the player change score by one
01:08 - score is available
01:10 - variable yeah so you add one because you
01:13 - touched him
01:14 - then turn 180 degrees and move
01:18 - 10 15 steps so it will
01:22 - then wait 0.5 seconds
01:26 - so because if you don't have this code
01:28 - then it
01:29 - like if you're touching glowy you're
01:31 - like add so much more
01:35 - but why is
01:38 - so you need to try to get their ball to
01:40 - touch you yeah too
01:42 - not just like just leave the ball not
01:45 - touching
01:45 - the catcher which is supposed to be the
01:48 - goalie
01:49 - yeah so when green side clicks
02:00 - zero y negative one hundred and fifty
02:03 - three
02:04 - important direction forty five forever
02:09 - because if you did not have the block if
02:11 - on edge bounce
02:12 - the soccer ball would go out of the
02:14 - screen on his first bounce and you can
02:16 - never get it back unless you
02:17 - like go to an x y coordinate yes
02:21 - when i receive game over which is a
02:23 - message hide
02:25 - because if you don't hide then like
02:28 - you can like like yeah and like pretend
02:31 - to be like still playing
02:33 - yeah when i receive you win hide again
02:36 - and when it brings back click so yeah
02:39 - because you need a high when
02:40 - so you win or lose because like you can
02:43 - still play
02:44 - even if you win or lose you don't need
02:46 - to reset the game yeah
02:47 - next blow
03:02 - enough over everywhere because it will
03:05 - be
03:05 - x x coordinate not y
03:08 - so go like to left and right not up and
03:11 - down
03:12 - or any other direction yeah when green
03:15 - flaps play forever if score equals
03:17 - negative 10 then broadcast game over
03:23 - and we'll see game all game over are so
03:26 - high yeah so all of the sprites have
03:28 - when i receive game over hyde except
03:31 - the game over dash lose
03:34 - i mean dash win win dashboards
03:38 - when greens are click show when i
03:40 - receive over highway receive you win
03:45 - when green flag click forever if
03:47 - touching soccer ball
03:48 - which is this is behind the catcher
03:51 - right now
03:52 - changing score by negative one sorry
03:56 - minus one minus one point from the score
03:59 - yeah then wait zero point one second
04:01 - because if
04:02 - one time when i tried out my game and i
04:04 - didn't have this
04:05 - when i when i touched like the ball is
04:07 - touching it's like
04:08 - negative so it keeps minusing
04:12 - yeah i don't have the weight when green
04:14 - flap click forever move time steps if on
04:17 - edge bounce so it was like this spring
04:19 - yeah because it goes to left and right
04:22 - just it just goes left and right
04:24 - and if you did not have the on edge
04:26 - bounce code like
04:28 - you go like a little girl like one side
04:30 - out of the screen for yeah
04:31 - right just like you saw this is before
04:33 - the ever loop so it'll never stop unless
04:36 - you're loser when i receive game over
04:39 - so this is different the switch costume
04:41 - to gain all over
04:43 - the stop almost like nothing happens
04:45 - yeah it's like
04:46 - it's game over yes when i receive you
04:49 - win is like the same but win
04:52 - and it's not like the game over switch
05:05 - game over and you win game over is much
05:07 - larger than you win maybe like
05:10 - no like it might be player no
05:14 - i click high if you don't have that code
05:17 - then you would like
05:18 - win or lose at the media yeah yeah but
05:21 - you
05:21 - still see the other sprites when green
05:24 - flag could forever if score
05:25 - equals 10 then broncos you win i don't
05:28 - know why i put it over there just for
05:29 - fun
05:30 - like um there's backdrops
05:34 - i don't like the white black jump this
05:36 - is
05:37 - one is like game over or you win yeah
05:40 - so it's turned black but the first thing
05:43 - is talking too
05:45 - so when green flash clicks switch back
05:48 - drop to soccer to
05:49 - end forever place down excellent
05:53 - until done it's a sound let's hear it
05:58 - i i actually like
06:02 - i can't really repeat
06:06 - okay i actually copy the whole thing and
06:09 - keep paste paste
06:10 - paste paper it's not actually like a
06:12 - song yeah
06:13 - it just sounds like soccer music
06:17 - when i receive game over switch back to
06:20 - game mode and when i
06:21 - receive you win you switch back to game
06:23 - mode the game over
06:24 - backdrop is the one is the black
06:27 - backdrop
06:28 - yeah i know why it's called game over
06:31 - the first thing i do it oh just name it
06:34 - game over then
06:35 - i forgot to win so it's just like let's
06:38 - play it clears playing for zero score
06:42 - negative two one
06:46 - keep touching it no you're not four
06:50 - number five
06:51 - seven of an eight number nine oh you
06:54 - almost got
06:55 - but i'm almost lost but i won't let it
07:05 - okay my turn
07:11 - where is it
07:16 - don't let the catcher touch it or like
07:19 - the minus one point
07:20 - don't actually really like do the same
07:22 - pattern forever or it's like
07:24 - you're just nothing oh no negative two
07:29 - the catcher is actually really tricky
07:32 - at first i actually made a like a soccer
07:35 - but it didn't actually work so it
07:37 - literally like
07:38 - changed the whole game i keep touching
07:40 - it
07:42 - oh no okay
07:45 - you sometimes need to like trap the ball
07:47 - so it won't touch the capture and repeat
07:50 - that pattern forever
07:52 - oh no no
07:57 - okay i had to do it
08:02 - no touching me no touching my soccer
08:05 - ball
08:07 - oh i know i know how you can win you can
08:09 - just trap the
08:11 - soccer ball and keep bouncing it against
08:13 - the edge or something
08:14 - yeah and then you can keep having points
08:16 - until you get 10 points
08:18 - but the um the soccer ball moves when
08:21 - you
08:21 - touch it yeah it's a little harder
08:28 - negative zero
08:31 - negative come on
08:37 - i always bounce the soccer ball where
08:39 - the goalie is
08:41 - an improvement you can make is that like
08:43 - the
08:44 - goalie a random
08:47 - amount of speed game over
08:51 - last time i really tried to like make
08:54 - the game over at the middle guys
08:57 - so oh try to drop it
09:00 - oh no i can't you can't trap it oh no
