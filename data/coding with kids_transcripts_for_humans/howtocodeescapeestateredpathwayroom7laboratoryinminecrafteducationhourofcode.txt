00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia and mine is Andrew right now we're
00:05 - in Minecraft education Edition in the
00:07 - hour of code Escape estate so in the
00:10 - last video we completed this room and
00:12 - now we're going to go through the portal
00:14 - let's go say byebye oh we can't even see
00:17 - anything
00:20 - loading where are we there's lots of M
00:23 - um let's like a factory oh searching for
00:26 - particles let's press this button okay
00:29 - let's see huh oh look there are patents
00:33 - press C to code C okay pipes you'll need
00:37 - to add a specific amount of blocks to
00:38 - each of the Hoppers maybe there's
00:40 - something in the room that can tell you
00:42 - how many use a drop block function to
00:44 - drop the correct amount of colored block
00:46 - into pipes you can use the drop block
00:48 - function and you can use the colors
00:50 - yellow blue orange and magenta so here
00:54 - these are probably how many blocks we
00:55 - have to put in each Hopper so two for
00:58 - yellow four for blue three three for
01:00 - magenta and two for orange okay and then
01:02 - these are the
01:03 - Hoppers okay so let's see the code
01:06 - example
01:09 - first so now they're X because the code
01:13 - inserted the wrong
01:14 - amount if you want to do this many times
01:17 - you can also use the repeat Loop to make
01:19 - it easier and faster so first we're just
01:22 - going to have to use drop two yellows so
01:25 - there's already one so let's just do it
01:27 - again drop block yellow
01:40 - yellow okay and then we have to do four
01:43 - blues so we're going to make a repeat
01:51 - Loop four
01:53 - times and then drop block blue blue okay
01:58 - let's see how many times for magenta
02:01 - three and then two for orange okay so
02:03 - let's go back to code and
02:09 - so
02:11 - magenta
02:14 - three there's already two Mages but it's
02:20 - fine
02:22 - [Music]
02:24 - drop magenta now we can change this
02:27 - magenta box of code to Orange
02:36 - okay and let's
02:38 - try oh it turn the block benath turns
02:41 - green when it's right puzzle now we to
02:44 - searching for more part what's this this
02:46 - is like a cream this on the wall there's
02:50 - one chicken three sheep five cow and 23
02:54 - crowns and there's a weight so this is
02:57 - probably measures the weight and those
02:59 - are the weights of of the items and
03:01 - probably that's our goal okay let's see
03:03 - the code first weight you need the scale
03:06 - to reach a weight of exactly 23 lb maybe
03:09 - there's a sign around here to tell me
03:11 - how much each mob weighs use a summon
03:13 - animals function to summon a combination
03:15 - of animals that add up to 23 lb so
03:18 - chicken's one lb sheep is three and cow
03:20 - is five so the quickest way is to get
03:24 - four cows and then one sheep or it could
03:28 - just be three chickens but it's fine so
03:32 - four cows and one sheep so let's just
03:35 - delete the
03:36 - chickens and then four
03:39 - cows do four and then summon animal
03:45 - cow cow and then one sheep and then one
03:49 - sheep so the four cows will equal to 20
03:51 - lbs and the Sheep oh it's already sheep
03:54 - will be the other three lbs okay let's
03:57 - see there's so many I was in the same
04:00 - spot now the weight is 23 so puzzle
04:03 - solve they're all stuck in there cuz
04:05 - they're like border blocks okay okay now
04:08 - here's some plants what's that it's a
04:11 - creepers and zombies and skeletons see
04:14 - they're on a minecart and there's faces
04:17 - there's three zombies two creepers and
04:19 - two skeletons and then there are these
04:22 - huge faces of them and it looks like we
04:25 - had to put them in their correct um
04:27 - tunnels dumb yeah okay so that's let's
04:29 - go to code first Minecraft redirection
04:32 - the mobs need to be stored into the
04:33 - right passageways look at the mobs
04:35 - queued up to be sorted and sort them
04:37 - based on the order they're waiting use a
04:39 - sort mob function to set the order they
04:41 - should be solved you can use zombie
04:43 - skeleton and Creeper let's see the code
04:46 - example zombie zombie so you'll get the
04:49 - first four carts into the zombie which
04:52 - is wrong already they eyes just it shows
04:55 - US border blocks as the nose oh okay
04:59 - okay so first we have one skeleton and
05:01 - then one zombie and then skeleton again
05:04 - also you can also use a repeat okay so
05:07 - SK
05:08 - one wait it was one SK one skeleton and
05:12 - then one zombie okay so we're just going
05:14 - to delete these two zombies you can just
05:16 - change it oh yeah you can just change it
05:18 - skeleton zombie skeleton and then what
05:21 - will zombie and then Creeper Creeper
05:24 - zombie zombie okay so let's go back to
05:27 - code creeper creeper and then we just
05:29 - need to change this one to
05:31 - zombie zombie let's see okay so first
05:35 - skeleton zombie then skeleton Creeper
05:40 - Creeper Creeper and then the last two
05:43 - zombies zombie wow you just go into
05:45 - their mouths puzzle Sol enter the next
05:48 - room okay so looks like we already saw
05:51 - this room so much
05:55 - glass wait wait look to the
05:58 - side huh oh diary
06:03 - page entry number seven the laboratory
06:05 - dear diary I made a Most Fascinating
06:09 - Discovery today a laboratory it's
06:10 - complete with mysterious machinery and
06:12 - strange experiments the likes of which
06:14 - I've never seen or have I there's
06:16 - something very familiar about this place
06:18 - that's creepy that's a little
06:22 - sus wow oh there's an enchanting table
06:25 - over there wfy
06:28 - chump oh
06:31 - man looks purple
06:33 - stuff there's a laboratory but then why
06:36 - is there zombies and skeletons creepers
06:39 - they're doing
06:40 - experiments
06:42 - interesting there's plants
06:45 - here so interesting okay and there those
06:49 - are pipes right yeah yeah they're
06:51 - probably pipes so in the next video
06:53 - we're going to go through this portal
06:55 - and see what's on the other side well
06:58 - that was fun and that's for today thank
07:00 - you for watching Remember to smash like
07:02 - button and subscribe
07:05 - byee

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia and mine is Andrew right now we're in Minecraft education Edition in the hour of code Escape estate so in the last video we completed this room and now we're going to go through the portal let's go say byebye oh we can't even see anything loading where are we there's lots of M um let's like a factory oh searching for particles let's press this button okay let's see huh oh look there are patents press C to code C okay pipes you'll need to add a specific amount of blocks to each of the Hoppers maybe there's something in the room that can tell you how many use a drop block function to drop the correct amount of colored block into pipes you can use the drop block function and you can use the colors yellow blue orange and magenta so here these are probably how many blocks we have to put in each Hopper so two for yellow four for blue three three for magenta and two for orange okay and then these are the Hoppers okay so let's see the code example first so now they're X because the code inserted the wrong amount if you want to do this many times you can also use the repeat Loop to make it easier and faster so first we're just going to have to use drop two yellows so there's already one so let's just do it again drop block yellow yellow okay and then we have to do four blues so we're going to make a repeat Loop four times and then drop block blue blue okay let's see how many times for magenta three and then two for orange okay so let's go back to code and so magenta three there's already two Mages but it's fine drop magenta now we can change this magenta box of code to Orange okay and let's try oh it turn the block benath turns green when it's right puzzle now we to searching for more part what's this this is like a cream this on the wall there's one chicken three sheep five cow and 23 crowns and there's a weight so this is probably measures the weight and those are the weights of of the items and probably that's our goal okay let's see the code first weight you need the scale to reach a weight of exactly 23 lb maybe there's a sign around here to tell me how much each mob weighs use a summon animals function to summon a combination of animals that add up to 23 lb so chicken's one lb sheep is three and cow is five so the quickest way is to get four cows and then one sheep or it could just be three chickens but it's fine so four cows and one sheep so let's just delete the chickens and then four cows do four and then summon animal cow cow and then one sheep and then one sheep so the four cows will equal to 20 lbs and the Sheep oh it's already sheep will be the other three lbs okay let's see there's so many I was in the same spot now the weight is 23 so puzzle solve they're all stuck in there cuz they're like border blocks okay okay now here's some plants what's that it's a creepers and zombies and skeletons see they're on a minecart and there's faces there's three zombies two creepers and two skeletons and then there are these huge faces of them and it looks like we had to put them in their correct um tunnels dumb yeah okay so that's let's go to code first Minecraft redirection the mobs need to be stored into the right passageways look at the mobs queued up to be sorted and sort them based on the order they're waiting use a sort mob function to set the order they should be solved you can use zombie skeleton and Creeper let's see the code example zombie zombie so you'll get the first four carts into the zombie which is wrong already they eyes just it shows US border blocks as the nose oh okay okay so first we have one skeleton and then one zombie and then skeleton again also you can also use a repeat okay so SK one wait it was one SK one skeleton and then one zombie okay so we're just going to delete these two zombies you can just change it oh yeah you can just change it skeleton zombie skeleton and then what will zombie and then Creeper Creeper zombie zombie okay so let's go back to code creeper creeper and then we just need to change this one to zombie zombie let's see okay so first skeleton zombie then skeleton Creeper Creeper Creeper and then the last two zombies zombie wow you just go into their mouths puzzle Sol enter the next room okay so looks like we already saw this room so much glass wait wait look to the side huh oh diary page entry number seven the laboratory dear diary I made a Most Fascinating Discovery today a laboratory it's complete with mysterious machinery and strange experiments the likes of which I've never seen or have I there's something very familiar about this place that's creepy that's a little sus wow oh there's an enchanting table over there wfy chump oh man looks purple stuff there's a laboratory but then why is there zombies and skeletons creepers they're doing experiments interesting there's plants here so interesting okay and there those are pipes right yeah yeah they're probably pipes so in the next video we're going to go through this portal and see what's on the other side well that was fun and that's for today thank you for watching Remember to smash like button and subscribe byee
