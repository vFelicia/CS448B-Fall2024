00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia and my name is Andrew today we're
00:05 - gonna make a guess the card game in
00:08 - Python with chat gbt so chat GPT is a
00:11 - learning AI chat bot that is very
00:13 - popular right now today we're gonna use
00:16 - it to help us make a card guessing game
00:19 - so first I'm gonna ask it to make a
00:21 - simple card game in Python because I had
00:23 - no ideas so it gave me a card guessing
00:27 - game it says sure let's create a simple
00:29 - card game called guess the card in this
00:32 - game the program will pick a random card
00:33 - and the player's task is to guess the
00:35 - value and suit of the card the player
00:37 - will continue guessing until they guess
00:38 - correctly here's the code for the game
00:40 - so first we're going to import the
00:42 - module at random so we can use some
00:44 - functions inside that module like Choice
00:47 - Dot random.choice first we're going to
00:49 - create a function to create a deck of
00:51 - cards we have a function called create
00:53 - Deck with two lists values and Suits
00:56 - which are the numbers and words we can
00:59 - guess so we have to guess both the value
01:02 - and suit to get the card right then
01:04 - we're going to create another list
01:06 - called Deck with value and Suits so for
01:09 - each value in values and four each suit
01:11 - in suits with these are two for Loops so
01:14 - this will make this deck of cards with
01:17 - so for example for value and values it
01:20 - will do it'll start with Ace and then it
01:22 - will do Ace Hearts Ace diamonds eights
01:24 - clubs eight space then two hearts two
01:27 - diamonds two clubs two Spades and we'll
01:29 - continue then we're going to return the
01:31 - deck next function we're going to do is
01:33 - to pick a random card from the deck for
01:35 - the program it's called pick card using
01:38 - the deck with of the and which is the
01:41 - list we just created then we're gonna do
01:43 - return written that choice deck so it's
01:46 - gonna pick a random card and random that
01:48 - choice is the function we're gonna use
01:50 - from the random module
01:53 - next function we're going to do is to
01:55 - check if this if the guest card matches
01:58 - the picked card called check guess with
02:00 - guess and card we're gonna return true
02:02 - or false depending on if the guess is
02:04 - equals equals to the car remember to put
02:07 - two equal marks
02:09 - or else you're just assigning if you
02:11 - assigning something if you just put one
02:13 - finally we're going to do the function
02:16 - to play the game play a game we're going
02:18 - to create the deck using the variable
02:20 - deck equals create Deck with the deck
02:22 - function then we're going to do Picard
02:24 - variable which will make the program
02:27 - pick a random card from the deck then
02:29 - we're going to print welcome to guess
02:31 - the card game I picked a card can you
02:33 - guess the value and suit of the card
02:36 - and then we're gonna do while true Loop
02:39 - guess value equals input enter the value
02:42 - of the card so here it's gonna let us
02:44 - guess the value with the input and we're
02:46 - then we're going to do the same with the
02:48 - suits then we're gonna put our guesses
02:51 - for the value in the suit in a guess
02:53 - variable
02:54 - then we're gonna do if check s guest
02:57 - pick card so here we'll check our guest
03:00 - using the check guess function we made
03:02 - and if it's right we're going to print
03:04 - congratulations you guessed the card
03:06 - correctly then we're gonna break down so
03:08 - thank you for playing in the prints if
03:10 - we don't get it right we're going to do
03:12 - else print oops that's not the right
03:14 - card try again
03:16 - so this is our first version so now
03:18 - we're going to upgrade it using so we're
03:21 - not tell chat GPT to make it so we get
03:24 - Clues so it'll be easier for us to guess
03:27 - it we don't have to guess every one of
03:29 - the values for the suits is easy because
03:31 - there's only four
03:33 - so here there are the changes it's the
03:37 - there are check uh
03:40 - so Clues so there's a whole new function
03:43 - called provide clues with guessing card
03:45 - so we're going to do two variables value
03:47 - clue and suit clue which is we're going
03:49 - to remain blank right now and then if
03:52 - the guess is not the card we're gonna
03:54 - give a clue for the value the value is
03:57 - different from your guess the value if
03:59 - the guess is the value we're going to
04:01 - print the value is correct same for the
04:04 - suit and then we're going to turn the
04:06 - value clue and suit clue then here in
04:09 - the play game we're going to modify a
04:11 - little bit
04:12 - so here
04:14 - um for the if check guess where we check
04:17 - our
04:18 - card guest and the picked card here if
04:21 - we don't get it right we're gonna
04:24 - put our
04:25 - um clues in a variable and then we're
04:27 - gonna print them so the player can know
04:30 - that it's not that it's not correct
04:33 - and then we're gonna modify again make
04:35 - it so that the clues for the values are
04:37 - bigger and small because the values are
04:39 - mostly full of numbers you can cut it
04:42 - down and make it more easier so bigger
04:45 - and smaller so if you guess two and the
04:47 - answer was five it will say like your
04:49 - answer is bigger or larger yeah
04:52 - so here
04:54 - um if guess is not card then when I put
04:57 - another if Loop in the provide clues
04:59 - function if guess is less than the card
05:02 - we're going to print the value is bigger
05:04 - than your guess if not this is going to
05:07 - tell the value is smaller than your
05:09 - guess
05:10 - and then the same for the suits because
05:12 - the suit there are no numbers
05:15 - then here is the same for the clues ex
05:18 - we're going to print the clues but the
05:19 - clues are going to be different
05:21 - so now our last modification we're going
05:24 - to make it so that at the end displays
05:27 - the number of guesses we take so you can
05:29 - compete with your friends or family and
05:31 - try to guess the number with the less
05:33 - with the least number of guesses
05:36 - so here basically little changes weren't
05:38 - in the play game function when I create
05:40 - a variable called guesses we're going to
05:42 - start as zero and every guess which is
05:45 - in the while loop we're gonna do guesses
05:47 - plus equals one which we
05:50 - add one to the guesses a variable
05:54 - because he had one guess but it wasn't
05:56 - right
05:57 - or maybe it is right and then at the end
05:59 - we're gonna also print number of guesses
06:02 - with the guesses variable which is the
06:04 - number of guesses we took now when the
06:07 - player guesses the card correctly the
06:08 - program will display the number of
06:10 - guesses made by the player during the
06:12 - game this provides feedback to the
06:14 - player about their performance so now
06:16 - we're done and now we're gonna run it in
06:18 - Visual Studio code so here you can see
06:21 - all the code and now let's run it I'm
06:23 - gonna go first and I'm gonna try to get
06:25 - the least number of guesses welcome to
06:27 - guess the card game I've picked a card
06:29 - can you guess the value into the car
06:31 - such a value of the car so let's put up
06:33 - the list
06:36 - so value I'm gonna go with six because
06:39 - it's kind of in the middle so I can get
06:40 - a clue on bigger or smaller suit I'm
06:43 - gonna go with diamonds
06:46 - the value is smaller and the suit is
06:48 - different so the value is less than six
06:50 - let's see I'll go with three
06:54 - and then for the
06:56 - suits I'm gonna go with clubs
07:00 - still so value is bigger the suit is
07:03 - different so let's see it's between
07:05 - three and six
07:07 - I'm gonna go with four and then for the
07:10 - suit I'm gonna go with hearts
07:13 - see yes I got it right I got it both
07:15 - right in one turn oh and we'll in a
07:18 - single troll well I both I got both
07:22 - so congratulations you guessed the card
07:24 - correctly thank you for playing then it
07:26 - gives our number of guesses three so now
07:28 - it's kalia's turn
07:32 - but
07:33 - um enter the value 10. 10 10. okay
07:38 - excuse me Jack queen and king bear suit
07:41 - Hut's diamonds clubs or Spades spit
07:44 - capitalize the s
07:47 - B
07:49 - let's see this value is bigger oh so
07:52 - it's Jack queen or king and the suit is
07:54 - different from your guess uh I'm gonna
07:56 - do a queen
07:59 - and then
08:02 - clubs
08:04 - okay the value is smaller than Queen so
08:07 - I think it's probably Jack and the value
08:09 - is some still something else
08:12 - um I'm in the suit hearts
08:16 - oops that's not the right card the value
08:19 - is correct the suit so it's it's the
08:22 - value there's only black and this has to
08:26 - be diamonds it's the only one you didn't
08:28 - guess yet yes she got four guesses I got
08:31 - three should we do it one more time sure
08:33 - okay
08:35 - let's do it again
08:37 - let's see the value I'm gonna go with
08:41 - five
08:42 - actually eat
08:44 - then the suit I'm gonna go with hearts
08:48 - so I got the suit already correct the
08:50 - valley is bigger than eight let's see
08:53 - I'll go with
08:55 - ten Hui no actually Jack
08:59 - and hearts
09:02 - the value is bigger than Jack so it's
09:04 - queen or King Uncle of the king all
09:06 - right king hearts
09:08 - the value is still bigger Ace
09:13 - is
09:19 - hearts
09:21 - the value is still bigger
09:23 - than the king I'm the best Queen and
09:27 - then
09:30 - um hearts
09:32 - congratulations I guess the correctly
09:34 - five okay
09:36 - let's see
09:39 - um
09:40 - value let's do nine and then close
09:45 - pretty high
09:52 - um space
09:55 - we've got it correctly in two tries yes
09:58 - I won so you can try guessing it and get
10:00 - it in one try to be clear well that was
10:04 - fun and that's it for today thank you

welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia and my name is Andrew today we're gonna make a guess the card game in Python with chat gbt so chat GPT is a learning AI chat bot that is very popular right now today we're gonna use it to help us make a card guessing game so first I'm gonna ask it to make a simple card game in Python because I had no ideas so it gave me a card guessing game it says sure let's create a simple card game called guess the card in this game the program will pick a random card and the player's task is to guess the value and suit of the card the player will continue guessing until they guess correctly here's the code for the game so first we're going to import the module at random so we can use some functions inside that module like Choice Dot random.choice first we're going to create a function to create a deck of cards we have a function called create Deck with two lists values and Suits which are the numbers and words we can guess so we have to guess both the value and suit to get the card right then we're going to create another list called Deck with value and Suits so for each value in values and four each suit in suits with these are two for Loops so this will make this deck of cards with so for example for value and values it will do it'll start with Ace and then it will do Ace Hearts Ace diamonds eights clubs eight space then two hearts two diamonds two clubs two Spades and we'll continue then we're going to return the deck next function we're going to do is to pick a random card from the deck for the program it's called pick card using the deck with of the and which is the list we just created then we're gonna do return written that choice deck so it's gonna pick a random card and random that choice is the function we're gonna use from the random module next function we're going to do is to check if this if the guest card matches the picked card called check guess with guess and card we're gonna return true or false depending on if the guess is equals equals to the car remember to put two equal marks or else you're just assigning if you assigning something if you just put one finally we're going to do the function to play the game play a game we're going to create the deck using the variable deck equals create Deck with the deck function then we're going to do Picard variable which will make the program pick a random card from the deck then we're going to print welcome to guess the card game I picked a card can you guess the value and suit of the card and then we're gonna do while true Loop guess value equals input enter the value of the card so here it's gonna let us guess the value with the input and we're then we're going to do the same with the suits then we're gonna put our guesses for the value in the suit in a guess variable then we're gonna do if check s guest pick card so here we'll check our guest using the check guess function we made and if it's right we're going to print congratulations you guessed the card correctly then we're gonna break down so thank you for playing in the prints if we don't get it right we're going to do else print oops that's not the right card try again so this is our first version so now we're going to upgrade it using so we're not tell chat GPT to make it so we get Clues so it'll be easier for us to guess it we don't have to guess every one of the values for the suits is easy because there's only four so here there are the changes it's the there are check uh so Clues so there's a whole new function called provide clues with guessing card so we're going to do two variables value clue and suit clue which is we're going to remain blank right now and then if the guess is not the card we're gonna give a clue for the value the value is different from your guess the value if the guess is the value we're going to print the value is correct same for the suit and then we're going to turn the value clue and suit clue then here in the play game we're going to modify a little bit so here um for the if check guess where we check our card guest and the picked card here if we don't get it right we're gonna put our um clues in a variable and then we're gonna print them so the player can know that it's not that it's not correct and then we're gonna modify again make it so that the clues for the values are bigger and small because the values are mostly full of numbers you can cut it down and make it more easier so bigger and smaller so if you guess two and the answer was five it will say like your answer is bigger or larger yeah so here um if guess is not card then when I put another if Loop in the provide clues function if guess is less than the card we're going to print the value is bigger than your guess if not this is going to tell the value is smaller than your guess and then the same for the suits because the suit there are no numbers then here is the same for the clues ex we're going to print the clues but the clues are going to be different so now our last modification we're going to make it so that at the end displays the number of guesses we take so you can compete with your friends or family and try to guess the number

let's run it I'm gonna go first and I'm gonna try to get the least number of guesses welcome to guess the card game I've picked a card can you guess the value into the car such a value of the car so let's put up the list so value I'm gonna go with six because it's kind of in the middle so I can get a clue on bigger or smaller suit I'm gonna go with diamonds the value is smaller and the suit is different so the value is less than six let's see I'll go with three and then for the suits I'm gonna go with clubs still so value is bigger the suit is different so let's see it's between three and six I'm gonna go with four and then for the suit I'm gonna go with hearts see yes I got it right I got it both right in one turn oh and we'll in a single troll well I both I got both so congratulations you guessed the card correctly thank you for playing then it gives our number of guesses three so now it's kalia's turn but um enter the value 10. 10 10. okay excuse me Jack queen and king bear suit Hut's diamonds clubs or Spades spit capitalize the s B let's see this value is bigger oh so it's Jack queen or king and the suit is different from your guess uh I'm gonna do a queen and then clubs okay the value is smaller than Queen so I think it's probably Jack and the value is some still something else um I'm in the suit hearts oops that's not the right card the value is correct the suit so it's it's the value there's only black and this has to be diamonds it's the only one you didn't guess yet yes she got four guesses I got three should we do it one more time sure okay let's do it again let's see the value I'm gonna go with five actually eat then the suit I'm gonna go with hearts so I got the suit already correct the valley is bigger than eight let's see I'll go with ten Hui no actually Jack and hearts the value is bigger than Jack so it's queen or King Uncle of the king all right king hearts the value is still bigger Ace is hearts the value is still bigger than the king I'm the best Queen and then um hearts congratulations I guess the correctly five okay let's see um value let's do nine and then close pretty high um space we've got it correctly in two tries yes I won so you can try guessing it and get it in one try to be clear well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash like button and subscribe bye bye
