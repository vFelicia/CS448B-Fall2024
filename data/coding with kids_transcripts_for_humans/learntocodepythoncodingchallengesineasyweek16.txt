00:00 - welcome to cutting with kids my name is
00:04 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in
00:06 - edible so edible is a coding platform
00:08 - that where there are lots of coding
00:09 - problems and you can solve them using
00:11 - different coding languages So today
00:13 - we're going to solve three coding
00:15 - problems using python so our first
00:19 - problem is called inches to feet create
00:21 - a function that accepts the measurement
00:23 - value in inches and Returns the
00:24 - equivalent of the measurement value in
00:27 - feet if we're just going to round up to
00:29 - the approximate if it's not divisible by
00:31 - 12. so here there's 12 inches which is
00:34 - equal to one feet
00:36 - and then 36 inches is three feet if
00:39 - inches are under 12 return 0 and 12
00:42 - inches equals one foot okay so first we
00:45 - have a function called inches to feet
00:47 - with a number which is inches so first
00:51 - we need to eliminate the options that
00:53 - are less than 12 inches because less
00:55 - than 12 inches we're gonna round it to
00:57 - zero for zero feet so we're going to do
01:00 - if inches is less than 12. we're going
01:03 - to return 0 because we need to return 0
01:05 - if it is zero feet then after we've
01:10 - eliminated all the other 12 options
01:12 - we're gonna calculate how many feet and
01:14 - rounded to approximate so I hope I think
01:17 - they're all divisible by 12. okay so
01:20 - then we're gonna divide it by 12 because
01:23 - there are 12 inches in one one foot so
01:26 - if repeat equals inches divided by 12.
01:29 - so now we have to feet we need to turn
01:31 - it and we're going to return the number
01:32 - of feet in the in the given amount of
01:35 - inches so now let's check it and see the
01:37 - test cases so there's
01:39 - 3612 inches is 301 feet and there is
01:46 - um 324 inches is 27 feet okay so now we
01:50 - pass all our tests onto our fine um our
01:53 - next coding challenge
01:55 - so then we have count the syllables
01:58 - create a function that Returns the
02:00 - number of syllables in a simple string
02:01 - the string is made up of short repeated
02:04 - words like la la la la which would have
02:07 - seven syllables so here you can see a
02:10 - cheat code is that it tells us that
02:16 - please note each syllable will consist
02:18 - of two letters only so this will make it
02:20 - a lot easier okay so here it's always
02:24 - the same repeating thing
02:26 - so first we have a function called count
02:28 - syllables with the text called text so
02:30 - we return the number of syllables so
02:32 - first we need to calculate how many
02:35 - syllables there are so remember that
02:37 - their each syllable is two letters so to
02:40 - make it easy we're going to divide each
02:43 - the length of each word with each text
02:47 - by 2 to get the syllables so we're going
02:52 - to do length equals Len text so the Len
02:56 - function is a function that takes the
02:57 - length of something for example the
02:59 - amount of letters in a text so now we
03:02 - have the length of the text we're going
03:04 - to divide that by two to get the
03:06 - syllables because each syllable is two
03:09 - all letters so here with a syllable use
03:12 - length divided by two finally we're
03:14 - gonna return that so return syllable so
03:18 - now here you can see there is DD which
03:21 - is two and then go which is only two
03:23 - letters so it's one and then
03:26 - is four so now we passed our tests onto
03:30 - our final coding challenge
03:32 - so our final coding challenge is called
03:35 - evaluate an equation so it's very simple
03:39 - instructions create a function that
03:41 - evaluates an equation basically like
03:43 - solve the equation yeah so here one plus
03:45 - two equals three and then three plus two
03:48 - minus four is one
03:50 - so don't print return a value and you
03:53 - return the uh answer not the equation
03:57 - okay
03:59 - so first we have a function called EQ
04:02 - and with the uh
04:05 - equation we're supposed we're supposed
04:08 - to evaluate so if this is very simple if
04:12 - you know how to do it so we just do a
04:14 - variable answer equals of all evaluate
04:16 - so the Evolve function is a very useful
04:19 - function when you're doing math in
04:20 - Python so basically just evaluates the
04:25 - given equation
04:27 - and we're just going to return the
04:29 - answer that we get so let's see some of
04:31 - the uh equations so what is three so is
04:36 - uh five times eight minus four is times
04:40 - nine is four
04:42 - wow and then three plus two minus four
04:45 - is one okay and then six wait three star
04:49 - star seven is two one eight seven wow
04:53 - okay so now we passed all the tests well
04:56 - that was fun and that's it for today
04:58 - thank you for watching Remember to smash

welcome to cutting with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in edible so edible is a coding platform that where there are lots of coding problems and you can solve them using different coding languages So today we're going to solve three coding problems using python so our first problem is called inches to feet create a function that accepts the measurement value in inches and Returns the equivalent of the measurement value in feet if we're just going to round up to the approximate if it's not divisible by 12. so here there's 12 inches which is equal to one feet and then 36 inches is three feet if inches are under 12 return 0 and 12 inches equals one foot okay so first we have a function called inches to feet with a number which is inches so first we need to eliminate the options that are less than 12 inches because less than 12 inches we're gonna round it to zero for zero feet so we're going to do if inches is less than 12. we're going to return 0 because we need to return 0 if it is zero feet then after we've eliminated all the other 12 options we're gonna calculate how many feet and rounded to approximate so I hope I think they're all divisible by 12. okay so then we're gonna divide it by 12 because there are 12 inches in one one foot so if repeat equals inches divided by 12. so now we have to feet we need to turn it and we're going to return the number of feet in the in the given amount of inches so now let's check it and see the test cases so there's 3612 inches is 301 feet and there is um 324 inches is 27 feet okay so now we pass all our tests onto our fine um our next coding challenge so then we have count the syllables create a function that Returns the number of syllables in a simple string the string is made up of short repeated words like la la la la which would have seven syllables so here you can see a cheat code is that it tells us that please note each syllable will consist of two letters only so this will make it a lot easier okay so here it's always the same repeating thing so first we have a function called count syllables with the text called text so we return the number of syllables so first we need to calculate how many syllables there are so remember that their each syllable is two letters so to make it easy we're going to divide each the length of each word with each text by 2 to get the syllables so we're going to do length equals Len text so the Len function is a function that takes the length of something for example the amount of letters in a text so now we have the length of the text we're going to divide that by two to get the syllables because each syllable is two all letters so here with a syllable use length divided by two finally we're gonna return that so return syllable so now here you can see there is DD which is two and then go which is only two letters so it's one and then is four so now we passed our tests onto our final coding challenge so our final coding challenge is called evaluate an equation so it's very simple instructions create a function that evaluates an equation basically like solve the equation yeah so here one plus two equals three and then three plus two minus four is one so don't print return a value and you return the uh answer not the equation okay so first we have a function called EQ and with the uh equation we're supposed we're supposed to evaluate so if this is very simple if you know how to do it so we just do a variable answer equals of all evaluate so the Evolve function is a very useful function when you're doing math in Python so basically just evaluates the given equation and we're just going to return the answer that we get so let's see some of the uh equations so what is three so is uh five times eight minus four is times nine is four wow and then three plus two minus four is one okay and then six wait three star star seven is two one eight seven wow okay so now we passed all the tests well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash like button and subscribe bye bye
