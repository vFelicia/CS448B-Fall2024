00:18 - use a repeat until block to get across
00:20 - the ocean
00:21 - faster so he the dolphin's here and
00:24 - we're here
00:25 - so we have a repeat block and a repeat
00:28 - block
00:29 - loops that means it keeps doing the
00:32 - things
00:32 - until it goes to the goal so it will
00:35 - keep doing the code inside the repeat
00:37 - but right now there's no code inside the
00:39 - repeat
00:40 - so it's a straight line to the dolphin
00:43 - so
00:44 - let's put a move forward here and run it
00:48 - so now we're going forward and
00:51 - we are right on top of the dolphin yeah
00:55 - okay now let's press continue
00:58 - now it says there's a nautilus shell
01:01 - hidden somewhere explode the shipwreck
01:02 - to reach the chest
01:04 - so we're right here and the chest is
01:06 - right here where the nutella shell is
01:09 - so our code is repeat i'm so cool that
01:12 - means this loop
01:13 - move forward and move forward so we're
01:15 - just gonna
01:16 - crash into the edge
01:20 - hmm let's do
01:23 - let's run it first see we're crashing
01:28 - it will repeat for effect because we
01:31 - didn't reach our goal
01:33 - yeah so we then turn right before the
01:37 - move forward yeah so we can turn and
01:39 - face down
01:40 - so we can go to the chest let's run it
01:46 - okay so now we it repeated and we went
01:49 - to the chest and got the shell
01:52 - whoa let's continue
01:56 - now says looks freezing out there catch
01:59 - a solomon on your way to the underwater
02:01 - room
02:02 - that sounds tasty the salmon is right
02:05 - here jumping
02:07 - so there's a turtle here and you can
02:09 - also get a turtle it's optional
02:11 - so right now we're gonna get the turtle
02:15 - while also going to salmon so first
02:18 - repeat three times
02:22 - we'll go forward here here
02:27 - turn right six times
02:34 - okay turtles
02:37 - again turn left turn left
02:42 - so we can after getting this hurdle we
02:45 - can turn left and get the song
02:47 - so repeat three times move forward so we
02:50 - can release this out
02:51 - okay let's run we'll fall three times
02:54 - turn right
02:55 - move forward six times get the turtle
02:59 - turn
