00:09 - to show you my remix
00:11 - called minecraft taco burp so originally
00:13 - it was a taco burp
00:14 - so now let's show you it it's a cloud
00:17 - server so i'm playing on the ipad
00:20 - so we so there can be up to eight
00:22 - players per game
00:24 - hmm where's kalia
00:28 - hmm oh i know where you are
00:31 - hey try to catch me
00:36 - taco taco taco
00:43 - okay so let's see
00:46 - what i changed so there's the player so
00:49 - i got these like steve
00:51 - so yourself when you play you are steve
00:55 - the other people are alex yeah so i got
00:59 - the
00:59 - head it was supposed to be a scratch
01:02 - cat yeah so i changed it into the steve
01:05 - with the body
01:06 - and the head it was kind of hard to only
01:09 - get the body not the head
01:10 - you have to cut it off and then the
01:12 - player body
01:14 - so i got the original body and then this
01:17 - is with the
01:19 - the glider and i the glider is another
01:23 - image and i had to like paste the glider
01:26 - on top of this body to make it like this
01:29 - and then the opponent is alex head and
01:31 - body
01:32 - it was kind of easier somehow to get the
01:36 - body because
01:37 - people cut the head more often and then
01:40 - there's the ultra it looks pretty
01:43 - which is the collider yeah and then
01:46 - yep i put the ultra on top of alex
01:50 - so like the body and head of steve
01:54 - are from different images and so like it
01:57 - might
01:57 - look weird so i changed the
02:00 - um code and yeah let's play
02:19 - tacos yeah which you can get damaged
02:23 - from yeah
02:24 - you only get damaged by other persons
02:26 - taco but not your
02:28 - taco because see the head looks kind of
02:30 - weird yeah
02:32 - especially when a vloggy body goes away
02:39 - and you can recover health yeah over
02:41 - time without being damaged
02:48 - you're covering your health is pretty
02:51 - good when you don't have any health
02:53 - but you can also damage your opponent
02:55 - when you're about to explode
02:58 - so your score is the damage
03:01 - you've made to the other part
03:15 - [Music]
03:16 - me
03:42 - [Music]
03:44 - no
03:48 - [Music]
03:56 - we got double eliminated
03:59 - [Music]
04:01 - [Applause]
04:07 - but the other people's tacos are kind of
04:10 - like
04:10 - orange i was too close too
04:15 - when you're playing this game when
04:17 - somebody's about to explode
04:20 - don't be too close are you guys yeah
04:22 - even if you don't have the full health
04:26 - it's what i
04:32 - if you see your score increased that
04:34 - means you're hitting someone if you
04:36 - see your score decrease that means
04:38 - you're getting dude
04:39 - yeah this is sometimes hiding in the
04:43 - corners
04:44 - well that was fun and that's it for
04:47 - today
