00:27 - [Music]
00:28 - levels
00:29 - [Music]
00:54 - [Music]
01:00 - [Music]
01:10 - okay i really love the music
01:13 - so let's see what i changed to the city
01:17 - the lego guy
01:18 - it's supposed to be called that it's
01:20 - supposed to be called lego
01:22 - but oopsies yeah it is guy it's supposed
01:25 - to be lego guy
01:28 - so this is the costumes yes
01:32 - i changed it into steve because i got a
01:35 - gif which is a moving picture
01:38 - of a
01:48 - yeah but it's still different see we
01:52 - those are walking yeah this is like more
01:54 - drawy
01:55 - yeah so i changed the lego person to
01:58 - a stage you can still see the lego in
02:02 - them
02:03 - but the minecraft and you're covering it
02:05 - yeah so
02:06 - here this is like when you when you like
02:09 - get hurt or like die like this
02:13 - you need it you need to split up the
02:15 - costumes right
02:16 - yeah so i got i uploaded a steve
02:21 - take a picture and like i copied
02:24 - some the parts of the body and then i
02:28 - like
02:28 - paste them with this tool copy yeah
02:31 - copy and paste tool and paste them in
02:34 - their body parts are going through the
02:36 - costumes
02:37 - you can see if you will touch something
02:40 - that that's bad like this changes yeah
02:43 - you know if that's the thumbnail you
02:45 - like split into pieces and you dance all
02:48 - over the air
02:56 - [Applause]
02:58 - so i did the same costumes for your
03:01 - character with your music
03:02 - moving
03:06 - it might be a trick for people who
03:08 - haven't played they think it's like a
03:10 - good guy that
03:11 - can't help you but it's not just a bad
03:13 - guy yeah he's just walking around
03:15 - the usual bad guy having a
03:20 - but when i played that platformer i
03:22 - didn't actually know what he was
03:23 - supposed to
03:24 - do but then i touched me and i split
03:27 - into pieces
03:29 - he's an enemy no okay so i did the same
03:33 - gif
03:33 - and the same costumes as yours d so you
03:36 - might
03:37 - kind of get confused yeah
03:40 - let's do the thumbnail right no this is
03:43 - not the third
03:44 - oh yeah so this is like the sky the
03:46 - background
03:47 - and change this sun to the minecraft sun
03:51 - it's not actually so minecrafty it's
03:54 - just like
03:54 - a basically white square and then the
03:58 - lively lava
04:01 - is this lava no this is not the lava i
04:04 - changed
04:05 - oh yeah so these costumes are empty
04:08 - because on those levels there is no
04:11 - lava so i changed the lava to
04:14 - like i covered the old lego lava
04:17 - that makes me a lot of it yeah
04:21 - yeah a little yeah so i
04:24 - also uploaded most of these images yeah
04:28 - so these on the costume 15
04:31 - i left a bit of these because they're
04:33 - out of the screen because
04:35 - if you go here out of these yeah if it's
04:39 - out of these they're not in
04:40 - the screen so the core two is like
