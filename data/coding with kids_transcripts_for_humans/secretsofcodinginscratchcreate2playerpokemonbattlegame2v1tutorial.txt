00:00 - coding with kids my name is kalia my
00:02 - name is andrew today we're in scratch in
00:04 - my account kidnap cod123 and this
00:08 - project i made called two player pokemon
00:11 - battle which is
00:13 - version one and this is venosaur via's
00:16 - pikachu
00:17 - so i try to make it fair but then so you
00:21 - see it's stronger so it has a little bit
00:24 - more help and the attacks
00:26 - are
00:27 - random so
00:28 - okay so pikachu go first
00:31 - it's one two four venosaur and nine zero
00:36 - i'm using the stronger attack
00:38 - hey it's one two for venosaur
00:42 - zero
00:53 - pikachu is sad
00:56 - okay
00:57 - so first in venezuela and pikachu they
01:00 - have the same code which is when green
01:02 - fact clicked it will show in forever if
01:05 - pika won
01:08 - well like
01:09 - yeah equals yes so if pikachu won then
01:12 - hi
01:13 - and it's venezuela it used their
01:16 - nicknames not to be sold long
01:18 - ego yes then hide it's the same for
01:20 - pikachu that's their only code
01:23 - then blink
01:25 - is changing all the variables it will
01:28 - show
01:29 - um pica for health pica hp
01:32 - then full health then hp so this is the
01:35 - full health
01:36 - and the this is the hp
01:40 - then it will set
01:41 - venous return
01:43 - to one you'll see what this variable and
01:45 - the pikachu turn variable is for
01:48 - indefinite solar attack in the pikachu
01:51 - attack
01:52 - then in the pika
01:54 - then
01:56 - um hp
01:57 - the there will be like seven hundred
01:59 - something hp so people get unfair
02:02 - because pikachu has so much health
02:05 - but vanessa only has about 30 more
02:07 - health at first i actually experienced a
02:10 - lot of pikachu
02:11 - when they i was like it's so unfair
02:14 - even if like venezuela has the more
02:16 - health it's always like
02:18 - it's
02:19 - getting knocked out i was like so
02:21 - confused
02:22 - and then there's set juan the fen and
02:25 - pika one two
02:27 - no cause of course in the beginning they
02:29 - didn't win yet then forever set pika
02:32 - full health to dash 756 so
02:36 - and then for health is 785
02:41 - then if pika hp
02:43 - is less than zero then it will like set
02:46 - fan one to yes it's just like
02:49 - 40 if then hp is less than zero it's
02:52 - just like different variables high
02:55 - all the four variables which is pika
02:57 - full health pica hp then full health and
03:01 - then hp
03:02 - and it's the same over here just the
03:04 - pika one and the fin health that's
03:06 - different now in the fitness or age i
03:10 - mean attack
03:11 - first when green valve clicks over
03:13 - forever if
03:15 - um pika one then it'll hide if enron
03:18 - then
03:19 - it'll hide then here it says
03:23 - when clinging fact clicked it will show
03:25 - of course let's see if it's
03:27 - the attack will show very attacking yeah
03:31 - switch costume to costume one which is a
03:33 - blank costume because right now it's
03:36 - showing but you can't just see it
03:37 - because it's a playing costume
03:39 - and then over here forever repeat until
03:42 - venosaur turn equals one so pikachu goes
03:45 - first so
03:46 - repeat until venice or turn equals one
03:49 - so if it's not one then it can't attack
03:53 - i mean
03:54 - when it's one
03:56 - if key one press so it it's the first
04:00 - attack show then switch costume to solar
04:02 - pane so it's the stronger attack it'll
04:06 - change pika hp by pick random so it
04:09 - might do
04:11 - 100 yeah 100 so it's 50 damage
04:15 - the lowest and 100 bitcoin
04:18 - but you know flip a lot of coins you see
04:21 - there's like 50 in it
04:23 - then change finance return by one so 31
04:27 - then change pika term by negative one so
04:30 - pikachu will go
04:32 - yeah
04:33 - then wait one second in high it'll just
04:37 - be the same for the second attack but
04:39 - it's just when p
04:46 - yeah but you can do 100
04:48 - 100 it's just just like the same
04:53 - well yeah that's true
04:55 - and you won't see
04:56 - stage two having the scratch attack but
05:00 - that you can still do it who has thunder
05:03 - and
05:04 - duplicate the double kick costume is the
05:08 - seat too orange free because it's
05:11 - supposed to be organized someone
05:14 - i made two orange feet for double kick
05:16 - and then the venice oil so stinky
05:21 - well it's supposed to be yellow because
05:22 - because you have yellow feet but yeah
05:25 - so it's the same but just different key
05:28 - 0 for thunder and 9 for double kick
05:32 - let's say please don't press 9 set
05:35 - infinite sword then change hp by
05:38 - negative 50 to
05:40 - minus 100 so it's minus 50 to 100
05:44 - that means just like the same here but
05:46 - just different tax
05:48 - and different costumes and different
05:51 - keys and over here change pika
05:54 - pikachu's turn by one and change venice
05:57 - or turn by negative one
05:59 - then over here in the backdrop
06:02 - it'll forever play the pokemon theme
06:04 - song and then it will switch backdraw to
06:07 - battlefield forever if pika won he goes
06:10 - yes then it will switch back to our two
06:12 - pikachu one basically black with the
06:15 - pikachu with the words and the venison
