00:01 - welcome to good news kids
00:03 - my name is kalia and my name is andrew
00:06 - today we're in vex code
00:07 - so this project is going to be about
00:10 - dynamic
00:11 - eye sensing description this example
00:14 - shows how we avoid
00:16 - falling with the eye sensor and use eye
00:18 - sensor to find castle to
00:20 - crash into so first we need a forever
00:23 - loop
00:25 - then drive forward
00:37 - [Music]
00:42 - detects so
00:44 - right now it's gonna drive forward for
00:47 - him
00:49 - then if down i detects red
00:52 - then drive is first for
00:56 - 500 millimeters because
00:59 - red is at the edge of the playground and
01:03 - after the red you can fall yeah
01:07 - then turn left
01:11 - for
01:12 - [Music]
01:14 - pick random from
01:17 - pick random from 30 to 90.
01:25 - 30 to
01:29 - 90 then set degree
01:33 - which is a variable turn left for so it
01:36 - will pick a
01:38 - random 30 to 90 degrees to turn left
01:41 - after
01:41 - it dries reverse for 500 millimeters to
01:45 - prevent falling then set degree
01:49 - to zero so
01:53 - degree is a variable and
01:56 - repeat until
02:00 - until we need
02:03 - or or and
02:06 - if distance found an object distance
02:10 - found an object or degree
02:14 - is more than 345
02:20 - 345
02:25 - [Music]
02:26 - 345
02:28 - degree variable degree
02:32 - so if it spins around in a full circle
02:35 - or
02:35 - distant family and object if it found an
02:38 - object
02:39 - it will change the degree by five
02:43 - so change degree by
02:46 - five so it's a variable then
02:50 - turn left for degree degrees
02:54 - so the first degree in turn left for
02:56 - degree degrees
02:57 - is the variable degree so turn
03:02 - left for
03:04 - variable variable i mean degree degree
03:09 - degree degrees so right now the degree
03:12 - is five so it'll
03:14 - turn this for five degrees and i'll keep
03:16 - adding five
03:17 - and it will repeat that until if it
03:20 - turns more than 345 degrees
03:23 - then it will stop and drive forward
03:27 - again
03:29 - now let's test it
03:35 - so let's run it into the mode first
03:39 - yay crash into this one first
03:42 - so it's gonna go so right now it's just
03:45 - driving forward
03:46 - and then since the red end it went
03:48 - backward and
03:49 - it sensed that block and it pulled it
03:53 - kicked it off and now it's
03:57 - knocking over the castles yay
04:02 - okay going forward that little castle
04:07 - i think it's gonna kick it off right oh
04:11 - didn't kick it off at least it moved it
04:14 - oh it's this blue castle okay
04:18 - yes are we gonna knock something down
04:20 - yes
04:24 - that's just a little
04:28 - okay i'm sensing that one yeah
04:31 - is it gonna push one this one too oh
04:33 - that was a lot
04:34 - yeah that's so good this big
04:42 - oh at least this one fell
04:46 - oh um i knew it was gonna slip up
04:50 - but now i detect this one but it hit by
04:53 - the edge again
04:55 - which i don't really like by just
04:57 - sitting by the edge
05:06 - um but i didn't kick it off she's still
05:08 - here
05:11 - let's just click red again that one nope
05:15 - this one nothing is going for this one
05:18 - yeah
05:22 - let's go into 3d mode 3d mode and go
05:29 - okay it's going straight for the red
05:31 - line yeah that's how it begins because
05:34 - the code is
05:34 - first drive forward until you detect red
05:37 - and
05:38 - drive reverse and turn
05:42 - and then it'll sense
05:46 - um okay i can't see anything oh it's
05:48 - going back here
05:49 - and then here bye-bye building
05:54 - i didn't get off
05:59 - it's my building nope and i almost got
06:03 - the small building
06:04 - yeah oh now i guess let's do it in 2d
06:07 - mode this is what's happening
06:10 - in a full screen 2d mode
06:14 - yeah i like 2d mode more because you can
06:16 - see the whole screen
06:18 - and this thing's falling out of the
06:20 - screen
06:23 - this one out oh that one was almost
06:27 - that's fun okay let's go for this one
06:31 - yay yay push it off
06:34 - oh yeah all the pieces off yes
06:39 - it's gonna clear this one now nope
06:42 - this one yes this one i think it's going
06:45 - to
06:45 - no it's this one yeah this one
06:48 - the closer you get you know which block
06:51 - it's sensing
06:53 - this one block yep it's this one it has
06:56 - to be
06:58 - bye bye yes and thanks for watching
07:01 - remember to
07:02 - smash a like and subscribe bye bye bye
