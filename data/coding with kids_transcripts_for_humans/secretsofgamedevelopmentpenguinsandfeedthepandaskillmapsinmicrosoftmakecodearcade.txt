00:00 - welcome to cutting with kids my name is
00:03 - kalia
00:04 - today we're in microsoft may code arcade
00:07 - and we're in the zoo keepers hunt so
00:09 - we're going to do that
00:11 - yeah
00:12 - penguins it's penguin
00:14 - pension
00:20 - [Applause]
00:25 - they're all like running crazy
00:27 - yeah i think we have to put them back in
00:30 - thank goodness you're here penguins are
00:32 - everywhere well this is a good painting
00:34 - actually
00:35 - they're running
00:37 - around outside of their enclosure you'll
00:39 - have to help they're eating all the ice
00:42 - cream
00:43 - is sliding down the street how can you
00:45 - slide down the street
00:47 - look through the code and figure out how
00:49 - to put the penguin back into their icy
00:52 - paradise can you figure out how to move
00:54 - the penguin's spawn point when you've
00:56 - helped the penguins back into the
00:58 - exhibit click finish to continue to
01:01 - other parts of these let's see the code
01:03 - so let's start repeat three thousand oh
01:05 - there's going to be three thousand
01:07 - penguins
01:09 - penguin coupons
01:18 - so right now it's all spawning here
01:20 - because the x is 10 let's change it
01:32 - [Music]
01:43 - so after we fix the code it says you win
01:47 - but i just fixed the code and i went
01:50 - the penguins are now happily inside
01:52 - their enclosure one more time or maybe a
01:54 - little bit too full of ice cream
01:59 - there's a dirt block over there so let's
02:02 - see
02:03 - so the next one we'll have is the panda
02:09 - so let's do feed the panda too
02:15 - everyone's favorite panda is hungry so
02:17 - let's write some code to feed it some
02:19 - tasty bamboo take a look at the code in
02:22 - your workspace it
02:24 - should look familiar can you remember
02:26 - what it does when it starts to and then
02:28 - it just writes to the pan spray and set
02:30 - panda velocity
02:32 - to vx pick random 20 to 50 n okay so it
02:36 - moves then pan events
02:39 - first you'll need to grab some bamboo
02:42 - from controller drag and on a button
02:45 - press container into the workspace snap
02:47 - a new set my sprite to sprite kind of
02:50 - player
02:51 - block inside it make sure to change
02:53 - these
02:54 - kind to food
02:56 - so on a button press when you press the
02:58 - a button we're going to go to
03:01 - sprites
03:18 - so we need to like draw bamboo or choose
03:20 - a bamboo from the gallery okay so here
03:23 - we go
03:28 - gallery and get a bamboo so these are
03:30 - basically
03:58 - but the panda doesn't do anything it's
04:00 - just wandering around yeah
04:02 - it's next time to scatter the boot
04:04 - around the panda enclosure from sprites
04:07 - get i'll set my sprite position to x
04:10 - zero y zero block and place it at the
04:12 - end of the on a button pressed container
04:16 - from math grab to pick random 0 to 10
04:19 - value blocks and use them to replace the
04:21 - x and y value in the new set position
04:24 - block try some different numbers to see
04:26 - how they affect the way the bamboo is
04:29 - randomly uh placed on across this okay
04:32 - so we're going to do some sprites
04:35 - sprites
04:36 - set my spray position
04:39 - set my
04:54 - let's try first one to be 30
04:58 - and the second one
05:00 - to be
05:01 - 50.
05:03 - now let's see let's
05:05 - try
05:07 - you're gonna click the spacebar
05:10 - okay it went to the corner next one
05:13 - okay so now there's multiple buttons
05:15 - they're all over there
05:21 - now the bamboo forward for you to eat
05:23 - but you're not eating
05:25 - so the fourth the wet into the forest
05:28 - the forest is slowly growing okay
05:31 - so next
05:34 - i want the pam the panda isn't very good
05:36 - at finding food let's help it out
05:39 - open sprites and drag a set my enemy
05:42 - follow my sprite block
05:45 - out into the end of the on a button
05:48 - press container change the first
05:50 - variable
05:51 - value to panda then try your code on the
05:55 - greens
05:56 - so the game's green so
05:59 - far my sprite
06:01 - yeah do it
06:03 - panda
06:18 - so the panda will follow and go to the
06:21 - newest bamboo okay
06:23 - okay next
06:29 - lunch time we can help the panda find
06:31 - snacks by running code with the panda
06:34 - when the panda overlaps the bamboo from
06:36 - sprites pull out and on spike of kind
06:39 - player overlaps other spread of kind
06:42 - player container and drop it into the
06:44 - workspace click on the second player
06:46 - drop down menu and select food
06:50 - so first on spread of compare overlaps
06:54 - this one
06:55 - okay second
06:58 - food
06:59 - okay
07:01 - next grab a destroy my sprite block from
07:04 - sprites and put it in the on overlap
07:07 - container
07:09 - destroy so they on spartacon food it's
07:12 - food because the bamboo sprite
07:20 - block in the header of the on overlaps
07:23 - container called other sprite grab it
07:25 - and drag it down to replace my sprite
07:28 - and the destroying block press
07:30 - press the plus icon on the block to add
07:33 - an effect that will play when the panda
07:36 - starts munching both spray and do some
07:39 - great
07:40 - well
07:42 - okay
07:43 - so drag the other sprite over here
07:47 - to
07:48 - nice to replace my sprite and we can
07:51 - trash
07:55 - spray or just
08:06 - get your game and try using the game
08:08 - screen and when you're done click finish
08:09 - to continue the zoo journey
08:20 - [Music]
08:26 - we don't want the pan to disappear
08:28 - because it's not the bamboo eating the
08:31 - pan yeah
08:32 - the pan doesn't keep pressing more
08:35 - okay
08:37 - now they're all cracking
08:42 - yeah okay every time you make a new one
08:45 - but if you your range is very long then
08:49 - if you already press one
08:51 - then you press another one
08:53 - you may have one bamboo will never be
08:56 - eaten and you
08:57 - keep pressing and if the panda if your
09:00 - range is very long then it will go to
09:02 - this one then another one then another
09:04 - one and all of them won't be finished
09:07 - okay let's try one thing i'm gonna set
09:09 - here
09:10 - to 100.
09:12 - so we have this expanse
09:16 - hopefully it won't grab a screen
09:19 - okay
09:22 - so now it's all always great
09:25 - those are aren't eaten
09:27 - yeah because i pressed so fast
09:29 - it only
09:30 - will go to the newest one
09:33 - yeah
09:34 - now there's bamboo
09:36 - but sometimes when it touches one bamboo
09:38 - it also touches other bamboo and it eats
09:40 - both of those bamboo
09:43 - well we should call it tree
09:45 - it doesn't really look like a bamboo
09:48 - bamboo should be a stick more than a dog
09:50 - one more bamboo you press it
09:53 - yay
09:55 - how about we put the spray effect what's
09:57 - the difference okay last time let's do
10:00 - spray
10:01 - and then
10:05 - so now it's like
10:06 - more crunchy
10:08 - you like there's something spraying out

10:24 - smash the like button and subscribe bye
10:27 - bye

zero y zero block and place it at the end of the on a button pressed container from math grab to pick random 0 to 10 value blocks and use them to replace the x and y value in the new set position block try some different numbers to see how they affect the way the bamboo is randomly uh placed on across this okay so we're going to do some sprites sprites set my spray position set my let's try first one to be 30 and the second one to be 50. now let's see let's try you're gonna click the spacebar okay it went to the corner next one okay so now there's multiple buttons they're all over there

let's help it out open sprites and drag a set my enemy follow my sprite block out into the end of the on a button press container change the first variable value to panda then try your code on the greens so the game's green so far my sprite yeah do it panda so the panda will follow and go to the newest bamboo okay okay next lunch time we can help the panda find snacks by running code with the
