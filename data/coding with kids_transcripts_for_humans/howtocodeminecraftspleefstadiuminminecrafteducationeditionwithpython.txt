04:57 - type the number of blocks
04:58 - then it'll do block stop fill lava and
05:01 - then this is the position
05:02 - then we'll replace it with lava so it's
05:05 - where
05:06 - the mobs or players fall and they're
05:08 - going to do block stuff fill snow
05:10 - and now we're going to fill the snow
05:12 - above the lava
05:13 - they're going to teleport the mobs to
05:16 - the snow
05:17 - so they won't like fall into the lock

06:33 - [Music]
06:44 - break this block of snow that
07:00 - [Music]
07:04 - well this is a very fun game
07:08 - it would be funner if there was any
07:10 - layers because they will be
07:12 - and you have shovels so you can mine the
07:15 - type of block
07:16 - faster because well i guess yeah
07:19 - because the other players can like
07:21 - escape fast if you can't mine the block
