00:12 - originally only a cat
00:14 - so let's see
00:16 - so i'm the cat
00:18 - and andrew is the dog
00:21 - so there's a creeper a bone um
00:24 - cooked salmon and a raw salmon
00:28 - they're all minecraft
00:30 - so the cat needs to get the
00:33 - cooked salmon and stay away from the
00:35 - regular salmon
00:36 - and the wolf needs to get the bone and
00:39 - avoid the creeper okay
00:42 - okay so in the cat in the original
00:45 - project i didn't have the
00:48 - switch costume so when you press the
00:51 - right arrow it will the cat will face
00:53 - right if you press the left arrow the
00:55 - cat will face left in the original
00:57 - project it only faced like one way which
01:00 - is like moving backwards and forwards
01:02 - and the wolf is the same code as the cat
01:05 - except um it's d
01:08 - and a so you need to press d and a to
01:11 - control the both
01:13 - um the grilled salmon and the raw salmon
01:15 - is the same the bone is just like the
01:17 - gross amount except it has a new
01:19 - variable which is square slash bone wolf
01:22 - chewed because
01:24 - both two bone don't eat them and it will
01:29 - if touching the wolf not the cat because
01:32 - you see the bone doesn't matter to the
01:34 - cat
01:35 - the creeper
01:37 - since it it's here because the wolf
01:40 - hates creeper
01:42 - so poor wolf scared of creeper so it's
01:45 - like um the wolf is
01:48 - you need to get the raw
01:50 - you don't want to get the raw salmon
01:52 - which is a creeper and once you get the
01:54 - grilled salmon which is the bone
01:57 - but it doesn't matter if you touch the
01:59 - um the fish
02:01 - if you're a new wolf and doesn't matter
02:03 - matter if you touch the creeper or bone
02:05 - if you're the cat
02:07 - so in this bright one which is like the
02:10 - wind and blue screen
02:12 - so costume one is both one
02:15 - then costume two is cat one and costume
02:18 - free sadly
02:20 - redly
02:21 - nobody wants sad face
02:25 - so
02:26 - when green frog clicked if the timer is
02:28 - zero and like the variables the two
02:31 - scores
02:32 - um so if the wolf or captain
02:35 - um get enough
02:36 - fish and bone it will switch to costume
02:40 - free the sad
02:41 - one nobody wants withdrawal
02:45 - yeah
02:46 - then go to front lane show
02:48 - and when green falls clicks to a high
02:50 - because you don't want to see like
02:52 - nobody want or cat one or whatever
02:55 - yeah that can't see anything yeah then
02:58 - if green fox clicked and the bone both
03:01 - two equals 15 so if the dog chewed on 15
03:05 - bones it was
03:08 - which cost him to costume one which is
03:10 - wolf one so it's the points
03:12 - then it will show stop all
03:15 - um the cat one is just like the
03:19 - wolf wand but it's just the different
03:21 - variable so let's play i'm the cat

03:27 - okay first to 15.
03:31 - i don't really care if i touch the
03:33 - creeper

03:36 - by touching the creeper yeah most of the
03:39 - time for the salomon they're like stuck
03:41 - together yeah which is bad
03:46 - so the dog has a
03:49 - sound yeah okay
