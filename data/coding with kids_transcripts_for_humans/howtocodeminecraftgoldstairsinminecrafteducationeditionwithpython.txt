00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:04 - andrew today we're going to do one of
00:05 - those tutorials so we're going to do
00:10 - gold stairs
00:12 - it looks cool yeah climb higher and go
00:14 - for
00:15 - you will build some stairs out of gold
00:17 - blocks in this tutorial the builder tool
00:19 - will do the work by placing gold blocks
00:21 - where you tell it to you will build a
00:23 - golden stair to the sky
00:24 - just like an infinite stick
00:27 - yeah put in and
00:29 - [Music]
00:35 - for me
00:36 - like changing it into a game it won't be
00:38 - cold there will be water the stairs
00:40 - so
00:41 - insert a builder teleport too into the
00:43 - chat command to teleport the player to
00:45 - your position the builder is similar to
00:47 - the agent button visible so that's
00:49 - basically an invisible version of the
00:52 - agent yeah builder teleport to zero zero
00:56 - which will be our exact spot
00:59 - put two builder moves below builder
01:01 - teleport to to move forward enough to
01:04 - build a single stair we tell the builder
01:06 - to move forward then up then forward and
01:09 - up so it keeps getting forward yeah
01:12 - so builder move forward by one so we
01:16 - first move the builder will move forward
01:18 - and then
01:20 - move forward
01:21 - i mean move up
01:24 - so the
01:25 - builder will be moving up on this
01:30 - add a builder choice to tell the builder
01:32 - to fill the path with gold blocks
01:35 - so we're going to do it with water
01:38 - first let's try gold
01:41 - [Music]
01:42 - gold
01:44 - [Music]
01:45 - okay
01:47 - go to minecraft type t to open the chat
01:49 - and enter gold stairs you should see
01:51 - three new gold blocks
01:59 - [Music]
02:05 - he is
02:23 - [Music]
02:27 - now get a repeat loop move 25 times and
02:30 - put around all the builder move to build
02:32 - 25 stairs so now we're using a repeat
02:34 - loop to build more stairs
02:36 - uh how many times should we actually do
02:39 - just
02:40 - let's do it
02:43 - yes maybe it's gonna take too long
02:45 - go to minecraft enter go stairs and
02:47 - check you should see how long a long
02:51 - gold block staircase gets get created
02:54 - at in the teleport position but we don't
02:56 - need to because it's only a one player
02:58 - game over here
03:00 - and we're already in player so let's see
03:03 - in python first
03:05 - okay so there's def on a chat so it's a
03:08 - function builder dot teleport to
03:10 - position zero zero zero that's a
03:13 - function and for indexing range 25 so
03:16 - we'll repeat 25 times better that move
03:19 - forward once you'll go forward
03:21 - up then it'll do the trace path golden
03:24 - block then you'll declare the unchecked
03:27 - when you type gold chatter from the
03:29 - function
03:33 - [Music]
03:42 - oh we're inside the slime
03:46 - [Music]
03:57 - oh
04:01 - well the invisible builder is building
04:05 - sorry but you're taking so long let's
04:07 - walk
04:07 - let's walk up the stairs
04:17 - five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14
04:21 - 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
04:27 - 22.
04:28 - it's like it's just 27
04:31 - 24
04:34 - there's no one
04:36 - it's actually pretty
04:39 - oh
04:41 - [Music]
04:52 - okay
04:53 - [Music]
04:57 - i think we shouldn't change it into
04:59 - water andrew just gave me an idea so
05:02 - we're just gonna
05:04 - do this
05:05 - and we're gonna
05:07 - give
05:10 - give nearest player
05:13 - or
