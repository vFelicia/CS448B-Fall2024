00:01 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - kalia
00:04 - today we're a minecraft education
00:06 - edition and we're going to explain to
00:08 - you the code of tng canons so tnt canon
00:12 - is basically a machine in minecraft
00:14 - which is just redstone
00:16 - to shoot tnt
00:20 - [Music]
00:22 - okay
00:23 - so
00:24 - on
00:25 - on chat command canon so when you type
00:28 - canon into the chat it will build their
00:30 - teleport to negative one zero negative
00:33 - ten so that's the coordinates
00:35 - so
00:35 - [Music]
00:36 - um in this code we'll only need the
00:39 - builder but a lot the builder is
00:42 - basically a visual agent used to build
00:45 - stuff it'll build our face itself upon a
00:48 - positive c so it'll face a certain way
00:51 - then build a place mark
00:53 - builder
00:54 - move forward by eight so it'll move
00:56 - forward
00:58 - [Music]
01:09 - eight steps forward
01:18 - [Music]
01:24 - um
01:25 - [Music]
01:30 - so just like
01:31 - [Music]
01:32 - just do this shuffle then build a
01:35 - placement then place block by name stone
01:38 - slab so place a soap slab the
01:42 - builder move up by one so just like
01:44 - float up yeah then place tnt so you it
01:48 - can be ready to shoot yeah and billow
01:51 - moves right by one again and bill
01:54 - replacement
01:55 - build and move forward by two so it
01:58 - in this code you need a lot of builder
02:00 - place mark and build and move forward
02:02 - and right and left and backwards yeah
02:05 - then it will
02:18 - left by two and move back by seven
02:24 - so like you can activate it and
02:27 - then
02:28 - like deactivate it then builder move
02:31 - forward negative one up so it'll move
02:34 - down
02:35 - on one left and negative two
02:38 - build a replacement then the
02:41 - building will place mark
02:43 - and then build and move forward by two
02:45 - but go
02:47 - forward again and then build trace mark
02:49 - tap mark with repeater facing notes
02:54 - so
02:59 - and then the builder
03:02 - yeah the builder will move forward by
03:04 - one
03:05 - and
03:06 - left one
03:07 - and then place lever on block
03:10 - top pointing south so like point
03:14 - like it's not it's like off then builder
03:17 - move back by one then place stone only
03:20 - one stone block then build and move down
03:22 - by one so it can place the water then
03:25 - build
03:27 - yeah then build and move back by four
03:30 - and build a place mark builder move back
03:32 - by two then build a trace path with
03:34 - marked by
03:35 - tnt so it can place the team
03:37 - now let's see
03:41 - [Music]
03:43 - so definitely
03:53 - south and builder dot mark so biller
03:56 - will move forward eight left two and
03:58 - back eight and then a little builder
04:01 - that traced past stone so
04:04 - that move right one and then builder
04:05 - that mark so it'll start tracing its
04:08 - path with stone the builder that place
04:10 - blocks by block name stone slab so place
04:13 - six flag then move up and place tnt and
04:16 - then build and move right one and that
04:19 - builder that mark
04:20 - so it'll
04:21 - then it'll do builder that move forward
04:23 - two and build that trace past stone so
04:26 - after that mark it'll start tracing with
04:28 - stone again
04:30 - and then
04:32 - um it will move right and build it up
04:35 - mark oh wait yeah okay then builder that
04:37 - place tnt so then move right one go to
04:40 - that
04:43 - [Music]
04:54 - redstone wire and then
04:56 - you'll do negative one one and negative
04:59 - two and then mark it again and move
05:01 - forward one and trace path restore again
05:04 - build that shift four negative one zero
05:07 - and mark again and then i'll do forward
05:10 - two and then build that trace path
05:12 - blocks dot repeater number four
05:14 - so it'll make the repeater facing north
05:16 - with the four
05:18 - um
05:19 - second delay and then dot builder dot
05:22 - shift one zero one and place box lever
05:24 - the block
05:25 - top face south went off
05:28 - so you can know which direction it's
05:30 - off and which direction is on and it'll
05:33 - move back one it'll place stone then
05:35 - it'll go down and place water it'll move
05:38 - back
05:39 - and then it'll do
05:41 - build it on mark and then it'll move
05:43 - back two more blocks and it'll trace
05:45 - pack with tnt builder the on chat when
05:48 - you type canon chat it'll run the whole
06:03 - first
06:06 - [Music]
06:08 - this is uneven ground so you can see the
06:10 - water
06:11 - getting out from underneath
06:15 - okay okay flip the lever
