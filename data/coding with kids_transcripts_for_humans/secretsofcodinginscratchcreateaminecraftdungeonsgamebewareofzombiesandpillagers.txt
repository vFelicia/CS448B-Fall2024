00:00 - welcome to cooking with kids my name is
00:04 - and today we're on scratch so today
00:06 - we're going to show you my project
00:08 - minecraft dungeon so it's a test project
00:10 - so first you you're going to control
00:13 - steve with your mouse or your finger and
00:16 - you
00:16 - avoid the zombie and pillager both of
00:18 - them are monsters and you try to survive
00:21 - for 60 seconds that means one minute
00:23 - let's try it
00:26 - so now steve is following my mouse and
00:29 - they're trying to get me
00:31 - so i just got damaged and got attacked
00:34 - now there's more mobs
00:35 - and my health went down okay so
00:39 - let's see the code for steve so when
00:42 - green flag click that means when you run
00:44 - the project
00:45 - go to x0 and y0 that means the middle
00:48 - then switch costume to steve that means
00:51 - the regular costume
00:52 - and set health to 20. so your maximum
00:55 - health is 20
00:56 - and then forever go to mouse pointer so
00:59 - steve will follow your mask or your
01:01 - finger
01:02 - and then when green flag clicked
01:05 - forever so it'll keep forever checking
01:08 - the if
01:09 - if health equals 0 that means you lose
01:12 - then broadcast game over so game over is
01:15 - a message
01:16 - to other characters so when i receive
01:19 - attack that means when steve
01:21 - receives the message attack switch
01:23 - costume to
01:24 - damage steep so he gets damaged and then
01:27 - play some hit sound
01:29 - until done so
01:32 - so you can know that he's damaged then
01:35 - change health by
01:36 - minus one so minus one one health
01:40 - from the health variable and then switch
01:42 - costume to steve
01:44 - so i'll go back to the regular costume
01:47 - or look then wait 0.1 seconds so it'll
01:50 - avoid
01:50 - very little okay then let's go to
01:54 - zombies code
01:55 - so when green flat clicked forever glide
01:59 - one seconds too steep
02:01 - so it will follow yeah
02:04 - follow steve for one second and then if
02:07 - touching steve that means if it touches
02:09 - steve switch costume to zombie that
02:12 - means the usual costume
02:13 - and then broadcast attack and create
02:16 - clone of myself
02:17 - so a clone is like a copy of this
02:21 - character
02:22 - so and then wait 0.2 seconds to
02:26 - do this again okay so when it touches
02:29 - steve it will broadcast
02:31 - attack and steve will get damaged
02:34 - okay so when i start as close so now i'm
02:36 - coding the clone that means the copy
02:39 - forever glide one second to see if
02:42 - touching steve then switch costume to
02:44 - zombie broadcast attack
02:45 - wait 0.2 seconds so this is just like
02:49 - the code
02:50 - for the usual zombie but it doesn't
02:52 - create another clone
02:54 - yeah so if steve is touching the clone
02:58 - zombies it won't
02:59 - make another zombie yeah the zombie
03:02 - won't
03:02 - make another zombie only the original
03:04 - zombie can make another zombie
03:06 - so next the pillager another monster so
03:09 - the code
03:10 - is just like the zombie except the
03:13 - costumes
03:14 - and yeah that's basically all
03:17 - but the zombie doesn't have a attack
03:19 - costume
03:21 - because the pillager has a weapon
03:24 - it has a attack costume so switch
03:28 - costume to pill attack so pill is a
03:31 - short name for pillager
03:32 - and then it will go into the attack mode
03:36 - and
03:36 - broadcast attack so again steve will get
03:40 - damaged and create clone myself so
03:43 - the clone code is also like the
03:47 - zombie clone code yes
03:50 - so it has pill attack then broadcast
03:53 - attack
03:54 - but yeah but again it doesn't create
03:57 - another clone where there will be
03:59 - more clones than you expected next
04:03 - this is the dungeon so this is the
04:04 - background so when i receive game over
04:07 - high so it will disappear so the game
04:10 - over sprite
04:11 - that means the game over screen will
04:13 - show and then
04:14 - when green flag clicked forever play
04:16 - sound minecraft dungeons
04:18 - yeah so this is a song well a sound
04:22 - and it's gonna forever do it yeah
04:25 - okay then game over screen so when i
04:27 - receive game over the message
04:30 - show for then it will show in the
04:32 - dungeons that means the background will
04:34 - hide so you can see the game over screen
04:37 - and then forever
04:38 - wait 0.1 seconds next costume because it
04:41 - has
04:43 - a lot of costumes and then when
04:46 - green flag clicked hides because you
04:49 - don't want when you
04:50 - run it it's game over already
04:54 - play oh that would be crazy and then
04:57 - when the wind spread is

05:02 - green flag clicked reset
05:04 - timer so you see there's a timer here
05:07 - and it's still running yeah okay so when
05:10 - green flag collects you know reset the
05:12 - time
05:13 - then wait 60 seconds that means yeah and
05:16 - if health more than zero that means
05:19 - you're still surviving
