00:01 - [Music]
00:05 - welcome to
00:06 - cutting with kids my name is andrew
00:09 - keating
00:11 - in this project called dynamic
00:14 - eye sensing in castle crasher so let's
00:17 - see
00:18 - so we have a robot here it crashed into
00:21 - four capsules
00:22 - okay it's turning and knock the roof oh
00:25 - man
00:26 - the roof went out okay
00:30 - go another small castle
00:33 - the roof of the castle also go off but
00:36 - that one like
00:37 - yeah okay okay these two are standing
00:39 - now and knocks it down
00:40 - knock down the whole building yeah
00:44 - [Music]
00:56 - then there's this top one yeah
01:00 - oh this one's not touched ever
01:03 - this one is the winner of not getting
01:06 - touched
01:07 - it's all done push the rubble
01:13 - turning because it sense it no
01:18 - three of them are in that red okay push
01:22 - they're still on the edge
01:38 - yeah trying to get these
01:41 - you must be in the right position but it
01:43 - turns
01:45 - that was a good one oh man it's still
01:49 - there
01:51 - but there's still this one here okay
01:53 - pushing out one of the big blocks
02:01 - please please please okay maybe you
02:04 - can't get that
02:05 - one okay so now let's see the code
02:08 - so when start let's set drive velocity
02:11 - to 100
02:12 - and turn velocity to 100 and forever
02:16 - drive forward so we keep drawing forward
02:19 - if distance found an
02:20 - object so you can see anyone about like
02:23 - founding an object
02:24 - or left or right bumper pressed
02:28 - then if down i detect red because it's
02:31 - the end that's the other
02:33 - you don't want your robot to fall yeah
02:35 - it will stop die
02:36 - driving so it stops and driving first so
02:40 - back
02:40 - and turn right for five degrees
02:43 - if it doesn't turn it'll just like get
02:46 - stuck again
02:48 - forever else it will turn right for 20
02:51 - degrees so
02:52 - repeat it and repeat it until nothing is
02:56 - on the screen anymore
02:57 - yeah so this is an upgraded version
03:01 - because it's
03:02 - much easier to code
03:06 - so well that was fun and that's it for
03:09 - today
03:10 - thank you for watching remember to smash
03:13 - the like button and subscribe
03:16 - bye
