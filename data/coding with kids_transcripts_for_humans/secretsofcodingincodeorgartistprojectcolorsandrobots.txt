00:00 - welcome to recruiting with kids my name
00:02 - is kalia and my name is andrew today
00:04 - we're in kodak and this is the project i
00:06 - made called
00:07 - clothes and robots because there's a lot
00:09 - of colors and robots
00:11 - so let's see
00:15 - the art is so fast so fast
00:18 - yeah he's drawing a lot of lines with
00:21 - colors
00:22 - and robots and now let's see so one run
00:26 - for counter from fifteen to three
00:28 - hundred that means like
00:29 - the circles so counter is a variable
00:34 - right here and then set with
00:38 - to counter divided by zero
00:42 - say alpha counter then move forward by
00:46 - counter pixels right now we're coding so
00:48 - it will draw like
00:50 - these the colors
00:53 - then turn right by 61 degrees
00:57 - which will make the turns and set color
01:00 - to random colors
01:01 - that's how there's a lot of colors yeah
01:03 - after it's one straight line
01:05 - it'll change color so
01:08 - this is the code then jump to the middle
01:10 - center position
01:12 - because if we don't have the jump middle
01:14 - position we ended right here
01:16 - so the artists are like out of the
01:18 - screen yeah so you need to jump to the
01:20 - middle center position before you make
01:22 - the circle of robots
01:24 - yeah which is right here then repeat 10
01:27 - times because
01:28 - i need to make a like a full circle
01:31 - draw robot with size 1000 pixels so it's
01:34 - this
01:35 - big turn right by 104 degrees
01:38 - so they're not gonna go all on the same
01:40 - place you can choose a lot of different
01:42 - like
01:43 - this mouse i think that's a squirrel
01:46 - unicorn wizards alien
01:50 - that's a zombie looks like one
01:53 - oh this one is one alien this i thought
01:56 - that was angry bird
01:59 - like it has a stomach that's white and
02:02 - you know red fur and i chose the robot
02:05 - because angel really like
02:07 - wanted the robot now if you keep
02:10 - clicking it click the four
02:14 - counter like this it like it changes
02:17 - color because it's always random colors
02:20 - so click clicking it's like it's the
02:23 - color is
02:24 - moving like magic but there's no wizard
02:27 - in this world
02:29 - except somebody pretends that so let's
02:32 - see
02:32 - the audience it keeps
02:36 - drawing and drawing
02:40 - different colors well it can be the same
02:44 - color but
02:44 - where because it is random
02:52 - and then i'm gonna say that very slow
02:54 - okay not too slow
02:57 - mr fastest so slow
03:01 - it's very slow
03:08 - yeah it's like overlapping each other
03:10 - look so if i set it to
03:12 - let's see no that's too much that's a
03:16 - 100
03:16 - yeah 100 well look there's like
03:21 - and then there is one two three four
03:24 - five six seven about seven robots
03:28 - here so it's like another drawing
03:31 - yeah so it's like much prettier because
03:33 - there's another
03:34 - layer or something over there something
03:36 - black let's change it to c
03:40 - uh that's llama's a rabbit and there's a
03:43 - lot of
03:44 - ears now yeah let's see
03:48 - one last one pika pika wow there's a lot
03:51 - of wings her wings are big
03:53 - yeah and they look so pretty
03:56 - so pretty okay there's the robot let's
03:59 - do it one more
04:00 - time faster
04:05 - oh looks like it's bright colors over
04:07 - here oh no this token over
04:10 - you break colors and they become darker
04:13 - and darker you see this one
04:15 - this is very light and then peach comes
04:18 - darker and darker
04:20 - and then
04:24 - oh yeah yeah the tendons make these
04:28 - because it's their top yeah well that
