00:00 - welcome to
00:01 - coding with kids my name is andrew today
00:05 - we're in minecraft education
00:06 - so today i'm going to show you my code
00:09 - project called exploding footsteps so
00:12 - it's a very simple um code project and i
00:15 - want to make you they're fun even though
00:17 - it's really cool yeah it's only three
00:19 - blocks but when you
00:21 - so what this code does is basically
00:24 - um
00:25 - go explode
00:28 - um behind you so wherever you walk there
00:30 - will be craters and holes because it
00:33 - explodes so the here is the code on
00:35 - player walk so when you walk you'll
00:38 - place
00:38 - the code will place tnt where you just
00:41 - walked and then immediately it will also
00:44 - place fire at tnt
00:45 - so when you light
00:47 - um tnt with fire or steel whatever
00:51 - um just like it happens to a creeper a
00:53 - creeper or tnt will explode so then
00:57 - will be exploding footsteps
00:59 - so let now let's see in python there's
01:01 - also another way to do this code is to
01:03 - like box that place prime to tnt but
01:07 - we'll do it this way yeah so define
01:10 - untraveled walk so it's a function so
01:13 - when there when you travel you'll do
01:16 - block stop place tnt position zero zero
01:18 - zero so place t and t
01:20 - yeah and then place fire so it'll light
01:22 - the tnt of fire and then the tnt will
01:25 - explode set the function and then player
01:27 - that untraveled walk on traveled walk
01:30 - it'll run it so
01:32 - when you walk it'll run the function
01:34 - okay
01:36 - so now
01:37 - uh i just want to do it in a survival so
01:41 - kind of being a little more fun yeah so
01:43 - first i'm going to get another armor so
01:46 - i don't need to die
01:50 - yeah
01:51 - we're also going to get a few of our
01:53 - diet so even if we do die
01:56 - we'll survive
02:02 - okay
02:06 - yeah okay and then
02:08 - now i'm gonna equip it
02:11 - equip
02:12 - andrews at redstone brother
02:15 - well
02:16 - he looks like a redstone robber he is
02:18 - resting everywhere he looks so sucks
02:20 - okay we're gonna hold on to one token
02:23 - and place these here
02:25 - and now we're gonna take you to survival
02:26 - so you get exploded and it's kind of
02:28 - more fun because you have hearts
02:31 - and health
02:32 - okay
02:34 - let's do
02:44 - [Music]
02:47 - is a little bit better because it's like
02:50 - um it will just suddenly just happen you
02:53 - don't need a way too
02:55 - uh
02:56 - we're trying to get into tnt um into
02:58 - water because of the fire and then you
03:00 - keep exposed so um this only what this
03:04 - only works on land
03:05 - so it doesn't work when you're walking
03:08 - water because you're literally just
03:10 - jumping yeah and oh copper
03:13 - and tnt doesn't really do anything in
03:17 - water so i also don't think this works
03:20 - well maybe it works then um when it's
03:23 - raining but i didn't test it out
03:25 - so
03:26 - i think we should have gotten some food
03:28 - but we don't have any
03:30 - we still fall hungry so i'm just gonna
03:34 - run
03:36 - it
03:37 - it's a drama
03:40 - excuse me footsteps
03:42 - [Music]
03:44 - i really think it's too good if you want
03:47 - to try this
03:48 - and one
03:50 - actually like exploring footsteps trying
03:52 - to use prime team teeth yeah
03:55 - i use one of my toes
03:57 - [Music]
04:11 - and now there's copper so this is also
04:13 - useful for mining it's quick and
04:17 - you could get hurt
04:19 - yeah well just make sure you're
04:22 - you're equipped
04:24 - with armor and total of undying
04:39 - yeah should we try it with prime team
04:41 - tea
04:43 - um
04:44 - to make actually one i'm just gonna go
04:46 - to the water but there's a drown with
04:50 - you know what
05:08 - okay let's try it with prime t and t now
05:10 - okay so let's go back to blocks
05:13 - so prime candy only needs two blocks so
05:16 - it's more easy if you want more fun
05:19 - so you go to mobs and do projectile from
05:23 - tnt
05:24 - so you put it instead of tnt so you can
05:27 - get the place fire block out because the
05:29 - prime tnt isn't ready that's ready to
05:32 - explode
05:33 - so now let's do it again oh first set it
05:36 - today i guess it's still good
05:39 - why is there ladder let's see
05:41 - why is there loud let's see how it goes
05:43 - then
05:45 - it's projectile pronto
05:50 - it just gives us ladders how does it
05:52 - give us ladder
05:54 - is something wrong the place is loud
05:57 - [Music]
05:59 - maybe something's lying okay so now i'm
06:01 - just gonna change it back
06:03 - and do one more
06:11 - [Music]
06:18 - our last two no no oh
06:21 - he's right here
06:22 - yeah
06:23 - my last totem let's see it's still dark
06:27 - changing back today
06:29 - how about you get out of here
06:31 - oh i'm probably gonna
06:34 - hold your tnt's behind me fired rntv
06:38 - run as fast as you can order something
06:46 - this is so cool
06:49 - yes it's not in the video right here
06:51 - no
06:53 - until it comes oh it's raining so it
06:55 - doesn't work so there's a bunch of tnt
06:57 - because the raining is getting the
06:59 - fire out
07:01 - [Music]
07:02 - okay so now let's set it to a day
07:05 - um
07:07 - and
07:09 - set it to clear wetter so
07:12 - we can do one more actually
07:17 - okay okay one more
07:19 - oh
07:20 - get ready
07:21 - for exploding footsteps
07:25 - it's actually really not exploding
07:27 - footsteps but there's at least something
07:30 - but it is enderman
07:32 - i'm just going to hide here

07:36 - yeah yeah well that was fun and that's
07:39 - it for today thank you for watching
