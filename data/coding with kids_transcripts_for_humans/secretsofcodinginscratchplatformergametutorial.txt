00:10 - platformer then
00:11 - my first platformer because it's my
00:13 - first
00:14 - made platformer let's try it
00:18 - welcome to cute platformer
00:23 - watch out for spikes they can hurt you a
00:25 - man
00:26 - touch the spikes and two spikes and
00:30 - spikes spikes okay now let's see the
00:34 - curve
00:35 - so first is the player
00:39 - my right arrow key pressed change x by
00:42 - 10
00:42 - so like move forward and left arrows
00:45 - just change
00:46 - x by negative 10 and your min up
00:50 - arrow key press repeat seven times
00:52 - change y by 15
00:54 - repeat then repeat seven times change y
00:56 - by negative 15
00:58 - because you need a jump then go down but
01:01 - if we don't have this
01:02 - it would just jump it would stay there
01:05 - oh no
01:07 - there is when green flat clicks which
01:10 - costume
01:10 - two costume wonders to costume
01:14 - all of them are flat one of them are
01:17 - like usable like right now
01:22 - so there will be a lot of
01:25 - codes on the line green flat click go to
01:28 - x
01:28 - negative 193 knit y
01:31 - negative five so it's like where the
01:33 - starting point is
01:35 - then forever if touching color green
01:38 - which is the grass
01:39 - change your y by 10 because you don't
01:41 - want it to like sink down
01:43 - we is touching color
01:47 - red then broadcast we start so there's
01:51 - this spikes in the lavas if touching
01:55 - yellow which is the jump the color of
01:58 - the jump
01:58 - repeat seven times change y by 20 and
02:01 - change y
02:02 - by negative 20 so it will jump higher
02:06 - that's why it's called jump and there is
02:10 - if touching color blue change y by 10 it
02:13 - will be in the
02:14 - end and the follow
02:17 - and there is the green flat click
02:19 - forever if upward
02:20 - arrow and key write a repressed
02:24 - repeat three times change y by 15 change
02:27 - x by 15. repeat three times
02:31 - change y by negative 15 and change x by
02:33 - 50.
02:34 - i need this code because if you just
02:36 - press the up
02:37 - arrow and the right arrow it will maybe
02:39 - do first
02:40 - up arrow like jump then
02:44 - go right when it reaches the ground
02:45 - because one thing you need
02:48 - you press the first so it's the same for
02:51 - the if up arrow and left arrow
02:55 - except the change x will be negative 15.
02:58 - when i receive next go to negative 193
03:02 - y negative 5 which is its starting
03:04 - position
03:05 - when i receive we start go to x negative
