00:43 - they're pixel eevee
00:45 - and e evolutions which is leafeon
00:48 - umbreon glacion and
00:52 - espion and evie i'll of course choose
00:55 - evie because you know
00:56 - it is the main thing pokemon pokemon of
00:59 - the evolutions
01:01 - in the background i didn't add any
01:03 - background but i added
01:04 - when green frog takes forever it was zip
01:07 - rack dial which is a variable
01:09 - to pick random one two six so four
01:12 - so when you click switch back yeah so
01:15 - see
01:15 - it always is a different background
01:19 - so if background equals one or
01:24 - um two five for six it will switch out
01:27 - the background
01:29 - and then we'll stop the scribble it'll
01:31 - always keep changing
01:32 - yeah and then in the title
01:38 - it's supposed to be gem you see i exit
01:41 - oops i accident and then change into
01:44 - evolution and then and spread four which
01:48 - is you know
01:48 - the cover from there yeah uh
01:52 - my best my favorite background is this
01:55 - one so
01:56 - the graph and then i choose for the
01:59 - evolutions sorry
02:00 - you're not here but for them and then
02:04 - i put the title because it was supposed
02:06 - to be just for the color
02:08 - gems and then like this gem slash
02:12 - so that's and the background was
02:14 - supposed to be black and the usual
02:15 - project
02:16 - um it was only this background
02:19 - background six but i didn't know why
02:22 - um he had these background the five
02:24 - other background heroes
02:26 - i know but let's play okay i'll go fast
02:30 - first uh yeah yeah at least get two
02:36 - the like bigger connection is
02:39 - then the more points you get so you try
02:42 - to get as much
02:43 - as most points you can get in the minute
02:46 - yeah when it's 30 seconds i'm gonna give
02:50 - it to andrew
02:52 - okay ah three umbreons yeah
02:56 - uh yeah three is
02:59 - i mean two is the most common but the
03:01 - most
03:02 - not point three sometimes you can't
03:06 - actually do four
03:07 - like this three you can only do straight
03:11 - lines
03:12 - yeah or what i guess let's just give you
03:15 - the same point if you do this
03:17 - because okay six more seconds straight
03:19 - down is more faster
03:21 - so you can get more points okay so we
03:23 - have
03:24 - over a hundred points okay it's
03:26 - dangerous
03:27 - because it's 30 seconds so it's half
03:30 - oh i'm just gonna put i'm like getting
03:34 - getting freeze he's only getting two
03:38 - sometimes i get
03:38 - lucky and then like there were there is
03:41 - a bunch of
03:43 - some of those evolutions and then like i
03:46 - connect them and give me a lot of points
03:48 - but they
03:48 - waste a lot of times while you're trying
03:50 - to color connect them
03:52 - yeah oh there's a lot of tools i can see
03:56 - and a lot of babies oh i see that one
04:00 - right here
04:02 - it's a big line
04:04 - [Music]
04:05 - that's so big
04:10 - that's so lucky
04:21 - and you can see the leaderboards but
04:23 - it's about it's the usual game
04:26 - this how can people even get 100 500.
04:33 - they do it or they train like every day
04:37 - and then they were very good well
