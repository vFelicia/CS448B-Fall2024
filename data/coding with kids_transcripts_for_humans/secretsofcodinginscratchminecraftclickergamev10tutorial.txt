00:04 - today we're in scratch and andrew's
00:06 - account techno468 so today i'm going to
00:08 - show you my original project called
00:10 - minecraft clicker game the version 1.0
00:14 - okay tap the sum and get points
00:18 - let's see
00:21 - 20
00:22 - 30 points we can buy the dolphin
00:25 - now we have five automatic points per
00:28 - second okay so first i have the solomon
00:30 - the basic thing you can click so when
00:33 - green fire clicked it will set points
00:35 - the variable to zero so it will restart
00:38 - and then forever wait 0.05 seconds next
00:41 - costume
00:42 - because
00:43 - yeah flip it's tail and it's like moving
00:46 - good
00:47 - it's not actually moving okay then when
00:49 - the sprite clicks so
00:50 - because there's a clicker game you'll
00:53 - change points by one so if you click sum
00:56 - and you get one point then play sound
00:58 - so it's like uh some suffocating
01:01 - minecraft
01:02 - that's the only sound
01:04 - sound i could find and set size to 110
01:07 - so it'll grow big
01:09 - then wait and then
01:13 - [Music]
01:15 - so
01:16 - you can only see it grow big and small
01:18 - if you don't keep spamming something or
01:21 - else i'm gonna just keep them big
01:24 - no
01:25 - look here if you do it it doesn't have
01:28 - time
01:29 - to do it run the code so also when
01:32 - greenfield collector forever wait one
01:34 - second change points by points per
01:36 - second so
01:37 - if you buy the the tropical fish or the
01:40 - dolphin you'll get points per second and
01:42 - then
01:44 - here it will change points per points
01:46 - per second
01:48 - variable so you get the automatic points
01:51 - then the dolphin and the costume there's
01:53 - cost 30 points and then points per
01:56 - second is 5 points per second someone
01:59 - gets 30 points you can buy the dolphin
02:01 - or you can just keep going to 50 points
02:04 - and get the tropical fish which has 10
02:06 - points per second okay so in a dolphin
02:09 - code there's one green flag clicked set
02:11 - points per second to zero
02:13 - so i'll set the points per second
02:14 - variable to zero and then forever if
02:16 - points is less than 30 then set ghost
02:20 - effect to 60 because you can't buy it so
02:23 - now you can barely see it because you
02:24 - don't have 30 points at first i did even
02:28 - else clear graphic effects so if you
02:30 - have more you have 30 or more points
02:33 - it'll become regular so because you can
02:36 - buy it then the fish is the same thing
02:38 - but the points it needs to be more than
02:40 - 50
02:42 - and
02:43 - yeah there's also one to spray collect
02:45 - if points is less than 50 then it'll do
02:48 - nothing else if you have 50 then it'll
02:51 - start sound
02:52 - and then change points by negative 50 if
02:55 - you click it because you buy it then
02:57 - change points per second by 10 so you
02:59 - have 10 points per second then i added a
03:01 - trophy so when growth i clicked will
03:04 - hide then forever if points is a hundred
03:07 - so when you get a hundred points then
03:08 - i'll show wait one second and high so
03:11 - edit it so it says a hundred points says
03:14 - congratulations okay that's it let's one
03:18 - three so let's bounce it bounce
03:21 - that's okay keep clicking here should we
03:23 - buy the dolphin
03:25 - okay
03:27 - like one for a second
03:28 - i think the tropical fish is more better
03:31 - but you should get dolphin to start out
03:33 - so you can get more tropical fish
03:37 - okay a lot now
03:40 - we can wait we get 40 points per second
03:42 - now we have a hundred
