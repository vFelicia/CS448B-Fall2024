00:00 - welcome to recruiting with kids my name
00:03 - is andrew today we're going to teach you
00:05 - python so today we're going to learn
00:07 - about
00:07 - list comprehensions which is a powerful
00:09 - tool so list comprehensions is basically
00:12 - it makes another list based on one list
00:15 - but in one
00:16 - single clean line so first we're gonna
00:18 - make a list called students
00:20 - which has names andrew billy cindy derek
00:23 - and
00:23 - eva then we're gonna have a new list
00:26 - which is empty
00:27 - then we're gonna do a four step so this
00:29 - is the regular way we do
00:31 - for each item which is x and the
00:34 - students list
00:35 - we're gonna if a in the word
00:39 - do new list.append x then we'll print a
00:41 - new list someone save it
00:43 - go to terminal and type p y comp
00:47 - dot p y so then andrew and eva because
00:50 - those were the only names
00:51 - in the students that had a in them so
00:54 - the other names don't have the letter a
00:57 - yeah then we're gonna do this the same
01:00 - thing
01:01 - but shorter which we are using less
01:03 - comprehension so we're gonna
01:05 - just do the new list equals x for x and
01:09 - students
01:10 - then we're gonna print a new list so
01:12 - this will copy the entire students list
01:15 - into the new list and we don't need to
01:17 - do this like
01:18 - we do it in one single clean line
01:21 - so now let me save it and run so did
01:24 - andrew billy cindy derrick and eva so
01:26 - copy the students
01:28 - then we're going to do new list equals
01:32 - for x and students if a and x so this is
01:35 - the shorter version for
01:36 - the fourth statement then we're going to
01:38 - print a new lips so this is the shorter
01:40 - version
01:40 - and we do the fourth for statement
01:42 - inside the new list
01:44 - so now i'm going to save it and write
01:48 - so i also did andrew and eva so it works
01:50 - the same way
01:51 - then we're going to do new list equals x
01:54 - for x and students if x is not billy
01:57 - so print new list so this will add all
02:00 - of the items
02:01 - in the students into the new list
02:04 - except billy so now we're gonna see if
02:07 - billy
02:08 - is there so it printed andrew cindy
02:11 - derek and eagle so there was no billy
02:14 - then we're gonna do new list equals
02:16 - extra title
02:18 - for x and students so this we did the
02:21 - title function
02:22 - we should capitalize our words
02:26 - they'll capitalize the first letter and
02:28 - make the words needed
02:30 - now receive it and run so that andrew
02:32 - billy cindy derrick and
02:34 - eva with the first letters capitalized
02:36 - so it's neater
02:38 - finally we're going to do nearly equals
02:40 - x dot title so we're going to use the
02:42 - title function again
02:44 - if x is not really i'll add the item
02:46 - else i'll change
02:48 - billy into bobby then for x and students
02:51 - then we're going to print
02:52 - new list so i'm going to save it
02:55 - so then andrew bobby cindy derek and eva
02:59 - so in the last list we printed
03:03 - it did andrew billy cinna derek and evil
03:06 - but now the billy's changed into bobby
03:08 - and they're still capitalized
03:10 - that's a very cool tool well that was
03:13 - fun
03:14 - and that's it for today thank you for
03:17 - watching remember to smash your like
03:19 - button and subscribe
03:20 - bye bye
