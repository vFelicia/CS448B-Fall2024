00:04 - today we're in a minecraft education
00:06 - edition and we're going to do
00:08 - the animal tutorials this is a microsoft
00:11 - me code
00:11 - yeah so let's go
00:15 - mobs bouncing is where the pigs will
00:18 - bounce
00:19 - and keep bouncing and bouncing let's see
00:23 - there's a picture of a bunch of slime
00:25 - blocks and the pigs are like
00:27 - dancing and meme that paid me
00:30 - okay so put code in the on
00:33 - chat event to make a pool full of slime
00:37 - the pool should respond from negative 20
00:41 - 0 negative 20 to 20 00
00:44 - 20. okay so we're gonna do
00:47 - fill this fill with and we'll just use
00:50 - the grass block to a slime box
00:52 - blind magenta slurps
00:57 - so it'll bounce from negative 20
01:02 - 0 and negative 20
01:05 - to 20 0 20.
01:10 - so it'll be like a platform of slime
01:12 - blocks then add an
01:13 - event to run code when the player
01:15 - bounces
01:16 - so um players
01:19 - bounce right down right there
01:23 - add go to spawn and pick
01:38 - to make things fun pick a random
01:41 - position
01:42 - where the people will spot okay so
01:45 - the picture spawns somewhere above you
01:48 - so it won't spawn
01:49 - directly on your feet negatives
01:59 - [Music]
02:06 - okay then turn 2010
02:10 - they all have to end with a zero yeah
02:14 - okay
02:14 - go to minecraft press enter enter slime
02:18 - then bounce on the slide okay so now
02:20 - let's do
02:22 - let's add some more fun to repeat time
02:24 - so we'll spawn more picks let's
02:26 - do 50 this how about 30 first
02:29 - 30 30 each time the player bounces okay
02:32 - now let's
02:33 - see it in python let's go
02:36 - python yay okay so
02:39 - define on travel bounce so when you
02:41 - bounce for
02:42 - index and range 30 so i was a repeat mob
02:46 - stop spawn pit
02:47 - then a random position negative ten
02:49 - twenty negative ten
02:50 - and ten twenty ten so clear travel
02:54 - and when the player bounces they'll run
02:56 - the traveled balance
02:57 - okay so block stop fill slime block
03:01 - position negative twenty zero negative
03:03 - twenty two
03:04 - twenty zero twenty then fill operation
03:07 - dot replace or replace the blocks around
03:09 - and then player the on chat run when you
03:11 - type run in chat it'll run the function
03:16 - okay
