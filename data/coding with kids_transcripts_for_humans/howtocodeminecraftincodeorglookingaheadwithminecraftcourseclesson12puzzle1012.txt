00:12 - is a bad idea
00:14 - place cobblestone to create a bridge
00:15 - then mine at least two of the iron
00:17 - blocks
00:18 - so first we're going to move forward and
00:20 - then place
00:21 - cobblestone ahead some beers sink into
00:24 - the bottom yeah because lava is
00:25 - dangerous
00:27 - so then we're gonna move forward two
00:29 - times
00:31 - to reach the first of the arm blocks

01:11 - beneath some of these blocks which
01:12 - you'll need to cover up before moving
01:14 - forward
01:15 - and if command will come in handy here
01:17 - add a move forward command in the
01:18 - correct place to mine these blocks
01:21 - so steve has given us these blocks
01:24 - repeat seven times
01:25 - this drawer blocks and flower head do
01:28 - place cobblestone
01:29 - ahead so we're gonna add the mufart here
01:32 - so we don't just like stay in one place
01:34 - just keep doing it seven times
01:36 - nothing happens yeah so we're gonna run
01:38 - so mine the first block the thought off

02:30 - so go here then they want to check for
02:32 - blocks by destroying the block trying to
02:34 - destroy anything ahead of steep
02:36 - then if lava is ahead we'll place
