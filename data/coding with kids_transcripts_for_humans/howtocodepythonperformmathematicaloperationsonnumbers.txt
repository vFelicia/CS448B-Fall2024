00:00 - welcome to coding with kids
00:03 - my name is kalia and today i'm going to
00:05 - teach you python i'm going to teach you
00:07 - math with numbers so first we already
00:10 - have some code here
00:12 - so first we type first value
00:18 - then second value
00:22 - equals four then we
00:26 - need first value equals five then
00:29 - sum equals first value plus
00:33 - second value then difference
00:36 - is first value minus second value
00:40 - then product will be first value
00:44 - star second value which is
00:47 - multiplication
00:49 - then quotient will need a full
00:52 - slash which is for division
00:57 - then modulus will need a percent
01:01 - then exponent will need
01:04 - a star star so here sum is addition
01:10 - difference is subtraction
01:13 - product is multiplication quotient
01:18 - is division modulus
01:21 - is the remainder then exponent
01:24 - is like five times five
01:28 - because it's five star star four so if
01:31 - it will do five times five times five
01:34 - times five
01:35 - and we already have the code we need
01:36 - over here let's save it
01:38 - with ctrl s then let's run it
01:42 - p y math
01:47 - dot p y let's run it
01:51 - so first we have
01:54 - a sum nine because five
01:57 - plus four equals nine the difference
02:00 - is one because five minus four equals
02:03 - one
02:04 - product is twenty because 5 times
02:08 - 4 equals 20. then
02:11 - quotient is 1
02:14 - dot 25 because 5
02:18 - divided by 4 will be 1.25
02:22 - the modulus will be 1 because
02:26 - 5 divided by 4
02:29 - will be 1.25
02:32 - and then it will do the remainder which
02:35 - is a whole number so it'll be
02:37 - one then exponent will be 625 because
02:42 - 5 times 5 times
02:45 - 5 times 5 equals 625
02:50 - next let's delete these
02:53 - yeah yeah okay this is gonna be hard
02:57 - to believe these are
03:01 - yards
03:03 - then you too yar
03:07 - next we'll need print
03:12 - print free
03:16 - plus four
03:20 - oopsies
03:27 - three plus four then star which is
03:32 - division i mean multiplication
03:36 - then five so
03:39 - here we have three plus four divided by
03:43 - i mean multiplied by five so here
03:49 - three plus four equals seven but we
03:51 - don't have the brackets
03:53 - so it would multiply first because it's
03:55 - the math rule
03:58 - so 4 multiplied by
04:01 - 5 equals 20 and then it will plus
04:04 - 3 because there's addition sign here it
04:07 - will be
04:08 - 23 let's see if it works
04:12 - let's run into the terminal up arrow
04:16 - for what you typed less than the
04:17 - terminal then
04:19 - 23 because 4
04:22 - multiplied by 5 equals 20 and plus 3
04:26 - it will go to 23.
04:30 - then if we want to do audition first
04:33 - we need print
04:37 - then inside the brackets we need another
04:39 - bracket for
04:41 - plus four three
04:45 - plus four
04:48 - then outside will be
04:53 - multiplied by five so first
04:56 - right now where the three plus four will
04:59 - be in
04:59 - the brackets so it will add this first
05:03 - so
05:03 - seven divided multiply by five
05:07 - so let's say and see the difference
05:12 - between jobs so 23 and 35 because
05:16 - 7 times 5 equals
05:22 - 35.
05:24 - you now know the difference
05:27 - then we'll need to do first value
05:31 - equals five then second value
05:34 - equals four then quotient
05:38 - equals first value
05:41 - divided by second value then
05:44 - print quotient print
05:48 - type function it will have the type
05:51 - function here
05:52 - so i will print these what the result
05:55 - will be
05:56 - will actually always be float so it will
06:00 - print
06:00 - a float the type will be a string
06:04 - integer or float
06:05 - let's save it and run it
06:10 - so it's class float because it is
06:14 - a float and because there's a decimal
06:17 - here
06:18 - next we need
06:22 - pi equals
06:27 - 3.14
06:30 - then print
06:35 - type the type function
06:40 - pi then
06:43 - print integer
06:48 - print extra inked
07:01 - the part
07:05 - equals 99.99
07:11 - then print
07:17 - type
07:22 - check up time
07:25 - then print
07:43 - over here will be print type it will
07:46 - see what the class is and the integer so
07:49 - it will make it into a
07:50 - full number a whole number so it won't
07:53 - be a float
07:54 - then we'll print type again with the
07:57 - with a different number
07:59 - so let's do ctrl s and run it
08:04 - it's class float free because of
08:08 - the whole number is actually free then
08:10 - class
08:11 - float because it has a decimal
08:14 - 99 the next one is very
08:17 - like this so we just need a print
08:24 - round
08:32 - [Music]
08:34 - and then print
08:51 - i mean round is actually rounding up the
08:54 - number
08:56 - so let's do ctrl s and say to save it
08:59 - and run it so uh it's
09:03 - class okay let's go back up so we can
09:05 - see
09:06 - the first one class float free
09:09 - and free and there's class
09:12 - float again 99 100.
09:17 - so over here it's 99
09:21 - and it will be 99 and there's 100
09:24 - because over here round up it will be
09:28 - 100
09:29 - but over here is free free because it's
09:32 - round down so it'll be
09:34 - free so next
09:39 - first value
09:48 - is
09:51 - equals round
09:58 - round u uh
10:02 - andy
10:06 - seven point
10:09 - six five four three two
10:12 - one then you print
10:18 - and then i forgot something right here
10:21 - then we need to
10:25 - then print
10:30 - print right here
10:31 - [Music]
10:35 - print
10:38 - first value
10:43 - so here we round down because the rule
10:46 - is
10:48 - five are up in a round up but right now
10:50 - it's
10:51 - two so we need two numbers after the
10:54 - decimal
10:55 - so over here is less
10:58 - than 5 so we
11:02 - round down and we don't need any so
11:05 - it will just print 7.65 let's
11:09 - save it and run it so it's 7.65
11:17 - because we round down so we don't need
11:20 - these
11:20 - numbers anymore so just 27.65
11:25 - next second value
11:32 - equals round
11:38 - nine point
11:47 - comma 3
11:51 - then let's print second value
11:57 - second value so here we need to round
12:01 - up because six is not
12:06 - not less than five so we need to round
12:10 - up so we add
12:11 - one to the six now let's save it
12:14 - and run it
12:17 - so we now we have nine point
12:20 - eight seven seven because we rounded up
12:23 - and add one to the six and then it will
12:27 - be
12:29 - 9.877 it worked and thanks for watching

welcome to coding with kids my name is kalia and today i'm going to teach you python i'm going to teach you math with numbers so first we already have some code here so first we type first value then second value equals four then we need first value equals five then sum equals first value plus second value then difference is first value minus second value then product will be first value star second value which is multiplication then quotient will need a full slash which is for division then modulus will need a percent then exponent will need a star star so here sum is addition difference is subtraction product is multiplication quotient is division modulus is the remainder then exponent is like five times five because it's five star star four so if it will do five times five times five times five and we already have the code we need over here let's save it with ctrl s then let's run it p y math dot p y let's run it so first we have a sum nine because five plus four equals nine the difference is one because five minus four equals one product is twenty because 5 times 4 equals 20. then quotient is 1 dot 25 because 5 divided by 4 will be 1.25 the modulus will be 1 because 5 divided by 4 will be 1.25 and then it will do the remainder which is a whole number so it'll be one then exponent will be 625 because 5 times 5 times 5 times 5 equals 625 next let's delete these yeah yeah okay this is gonna be hard to believe these are yards then you too yar next we'll need print print free plus four oopsies three plus four then star which is division i mean multiplication then five so here we have three plus four divided by i mean multiplied by five so here three plus four equals seven but we don't have the brackets so it would multiply first because it's the math rule so 4 multiplied by 5 equals 20 and then it will plus 3 because there's addition sign here it will be 23 let's see if it works let's run into the terminal up arrow for what you typed less than the terminal then 23 because 4 multiplied by 5 equals 20 and plus 3 it will go to 23. then if we want to do audition first we need print then inside the brackets we need another bracket for plus four three plus four then outside will be multiplied by five so first right now where the three plus four will be in the brackets so it will add this first so seven divided multiply by five so let's say and see the difference between jobs so 23 and 35 because 7 times 5 equals 35. you now know the difference then we'll need to do first value equals five then second value equals four then quotient equals first value divided by second value then print quotient print type function it will have the type function here so i will print these what the result will be will actually always be float so it will print a float the type will be a string integer or float let's save it and run it so it's class float because it is a float and because there's a decimal here next we need pi equals 3.14 then print type the type function pi then print integer print extra inked the part equals 99.99 then print type check up time then print over here will be print type it will see what the class is and the integer so it will make it into a full number a whole number so it won't be a float then we'll print type again with the with a different number so let's do ctrl s and run it it's class float free because of the whole number is actually free then class float because it has a decimal 99 the next one is very like this so we just need a print round and then print i mean round is actually rounding up the number so let's do ctrl s and say to save it and run it so uh it's class okay let's go back up so we can see the first one class float free and free and there's class float again 99 100. so over here it's 99 and it will be 99 and there's 100 because over here round up it will be 100 but over here is free free because it's round down so it'll be free so next first value is equals round round u uh andy seven point six five four three two one then you print and then i forgot something right here then we need to then print print right here print first value so here we round down because the rule is five are up in a round up but right now it's two so we need two numbers after the decimal so over here is less than 5 so we round down and we don't need any so it will just print 7.65 let's save it and run it so it's 7.65 because we round down so we don't need these numbers anymore so just 27.65 next second value equals round nine point comma 3 then let's print second value second value so here we need to round up because six is not not less than five so we need to round up so we add one to the six now let's save it and run it so we now we have nine point eight seven seven because we rounded up and add one to the six and then it will be 9.877 it worked and thanks for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
