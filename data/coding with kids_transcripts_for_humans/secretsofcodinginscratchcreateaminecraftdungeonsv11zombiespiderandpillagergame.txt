00:04 - andrew today we're inspecting an angels
00:06 - account techno468
00:08 - so today i'm going to show you my own
00:09 - project called minecraft dungeon so this
00:11 - is version 1.1 so i updated it
00:14 - so i added the spider head so first
00:17 - let's see
00:17 - okay there are three mods the filter
00:20 - spider
00:21 - you're taking damage yes and zombie it's
00:24 - poison
00:25 - ah friend spider must be yeah
00:29 - are the slowest yeah because i mean that
00:31 - slow
00:32 - okay so in this version i added the
00:34 - spiderman
00:35 - so when green fair clicked of forever
00:39 - glide 1.5 seconds to speed so it's not
00:42 - that fast or
00:43 - that slow then uh if
00:46 - it's touching steve then it'll broadcast
00:48 - spider tag
00:50 - and then it'll create a clone of myself
00:52 - because every time you get attacked
00:54 - by a mob that mob will spawn one more
00:56 - mom
00:57 - yourself then it'll wait 0.2 seconds
01:03 - and there will be like thousands of
01:10 - spiders
01:12 - yeah if touching steve then it will also
01:14 - broadcast spider attack and wait 0.2
01:16 - seconds too
01:17 - so we're going to go to stakes so when i
01:20 - receive
01:21 - spider attack switch costume to damage
01:24 - steve
01:34 - and change health by minus one so the
01:38 - spider also does
01:39 - one damage then it'll repeat five times
01:42 - change health by negative one
01:44 - wait one second so that's the spider's
01:46 - poison so it'll do five damages of
01:48 - poison
01:49 - then it'll switch this costume back to a
01:51 - regular steve
01:52 - and wait 0.1 seconds i also updated
01:56 - updated the pillager so
02:00 - here it changes health by negative two
02:03 - so the pillager does two damage
02:07 - and i reduced the zombie speed because
02:10 - regularly the zombie was the fastest of
02:12 - all but yeah zombies are actually very
02:14 - good
02:14 - minecraft is very slow yeah i also made
02:16 - the pillager
02:17 - like better and faster yeah so now let's
02:20 - play i'm gonna go first
02:22 - okay be careful yeah
02:26 - yes try to survive for 60 seconds
02:29 - which is one minute let's see okay
02:32 - i'm gonna get hit one time oh
02:36 - okay now that spider's poison it's hard
02:39 - as poison
02:41 - is this five damage so the spider is
02:42 - pretty big one spider
02:44 - yeah just like sticking on the zombie
02:47 - yeah
02:47 - zombies very slow it barely hits you
02:50 - yeah it does the less damage in them
02:53 - yeah so the spider and pilger are the
02:55 - real friends okay
02:56 - 30 seconds so about half right now
03:00 - [Music]
03:02 - seriously okay that's the bathroom
03:05 - the bad thing is that the pillager can
03:08 - do
03:09 - two damage and the spider can do
03:12 - six damage yeah
03:22 - that's so close so i lost
03:25 - okay kalia is here okay
03:32 - the thing is that if you get hit by a
03:34 - pillow
03:36 - builder then you will wait i got hit by
03:39 - a zombie
03:41 - you can like bump it to zombie and they
03:43 - will be super click
03:47 - the spider inflicted his poison oh no
03:50 - no no so the harder when you get
03:53 - attacked
03:54 - that's why this is hard you're losing
03:57 - you're only 30 seconds
03:59 - oh if you take one shot from the
04:01 - pillager you're dead
04:04 - zombie oh
04:08 - yeah but yeah
04:11 - 15 more seconds whoa almost the same
