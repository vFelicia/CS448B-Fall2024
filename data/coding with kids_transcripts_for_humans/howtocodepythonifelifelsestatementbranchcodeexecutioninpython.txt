00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - kalia
00:03 - and my name is andrew today we're going
00:05 - to teach you python
00:07 - we're in visual studio code and today
00:09 - we're going to learn
00:10 - branch coding so first we're going to do
00:13 - a new file
00:14 - i'm going to name it branch coding dot
00:17 - p1
00:18 - so first i want to make a value equals
00:22 - seven then if
00:26 - value equals we need two equal signs
00:30 - because one equal sign assigns something
00:33 - while two
00:33 - equals sign check if something equals
00:35 - something so
00:37 - if value equals seven
00:40 - you need a tab and then print
00:44 - value is
00:49 - wait
00:52 - my value is seven
00:55 - okay print
01:07 - okay now you press ctrl s to
01:10 - save what do you think it won't do i
01:13 - think
01:14 - it it will check if the value is seven
01:18 - then print
01:18 - value is seven then print finish i also
01:21 - think it too
01:22 - let's go to terminal and type p y
01:26 - branch coding
01:31 - dot p one let's say it's value of seven
01:35 - finished next we're gonna add else so
01:39 - else
01:42 - current
01:45 - the value is not
01:48 - seven now let's save it and what do you
01:52 - think it will do now
01:54 - well the value is equal seven so it will
01:57 - do the if
01:58 - it will print the value is seven
02:02 - okay let's change the value to
02:05 - six and save it now what do you think it
02:08 - will do
02:08 - i think it will skip the if then do the
02:11 - else print developers not 17 print to
02:13 - finish
02:14 - good now you can use the up arrow to
02:17 - copy what you last typed in
02:20 - since the value is not seven finished
02:23 - now we're going to add an alice
02:30 - oh this
02:38 - equals eight
02:43 - then i'm going to change the value to
02:46 - eight now save it
02:50 - and then
02:54 - do the end tab print
03:02 - the value is eight
03:06 - save it and now what do you think it
03:08 - will do if
03:09 - it will check if the value is seven if
03:11 - it's not
03:12 - um seven it will go to the elf then the
03:16 - value equals eight
03:18 - then it will print the vowel is eight
03:19 - descriptive
03:21 - else then go print finish i think so two
03:25 - let's do let's run it says the value is
03:32 - my goodness if clock
03:35 - blocks this is code block okay so first
03:38 - i want to do
03:39 - first that
03:42 - value equals
03:46 - true and then second
03:51 - second and u equals
03:55 - six goes six
03:58 - and then we're going to do f is first
04:02 - first
04:02 - value equals
04:06 - equals the first value
04:10 - in one minute
04:24 - got here we got here
04:28 - then print that here
04:31 - [Music]
04:40 - okay save it now what do you think it
04:44 - will do
04:45 - so the second number of value equals
04:48 - eight
04:49 - six i mean then it first back along
04:52 - first value equals nothing if
04:56 - second value equals eight six then print
04:59 - got here so i think the first value is
05:03 - true so
05:04 - that means it's basically meaning if
05:06 - true
05:07 - then it will do if second value equals
05:10 - six
05:11 - now print got here so i think it will
05:13 - just print got here
05:15 - this save it
05:19 - and then run it
05:22 - says got here and that's it for today

welcome to coding with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python we're in visual studio code and today we're going to learn branch coding so first we're going to do a new file i'm going to name it branch coding dot p1 so first i want to make a value equals seven then if value equals we need two equal signs because one equal sign assigns something while two equals sign check if something equals something so if value equals seven you need a tab and then print value is wait my value is seven okay print okay now you press ctrl s to save what do you think it won't do i think it it will check if the value is seven then print value is seven then print finish i also think it too let's go to terminal and type p y branch coding dot p one let's say it's value of seven finished next we're gonna add else so else current the value is not seven now let's save it and what do you think it will do now well the value is equal seven so it will do the if it will print the value is seven okay let's change the value to six and save it now what do you think it will do i think it will skip the if then do the else print developers not 17 print to finish good now you can use the up arrow to copy what you last typed in since the value is not seven finished now we're going to add an alice oh this equals eight then i'm going to change the value to eight now save it and then do the end tab print the value is eight save it and now what do you think it will do if it will check if the value is seven if it's not um seven it will go to the elf then the value equals eight then it will print the vowel is eight descriptive else then go print finish i think so two let's do let's run it says the value is my goodness if clock blocks this is code block okay so first i want to do first that value equals true and then second second and u equals six goes six and then we're going to do f is first first value equals equals the first value in one minute got here we got here then print that here okay save it now what do you think it will do so the second number of value equals eight six i mean then it first back along first value equals nothing if second value equals eight six then print got here so i think the first value is true so that means it's basically meaning if true then it will do if second value equals six now print got here so i think it will just print got here this save it and then run it says got here and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe thank you for watching byebye
