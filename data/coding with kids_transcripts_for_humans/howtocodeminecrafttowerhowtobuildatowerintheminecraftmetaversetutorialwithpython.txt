00:00 - welcome to
00:01 - cutting with kids my name is kalia my
00:04 - name is andrew today we're in minecraft
00:06 - education edition and we're going to do
00:08 - to make a tower
00:10 - with the builder so first we're going to
00:13 - make a new project called tower because
00:16 - we're making a tower
00:18 - then we're going to uncheck command when
00:21 - you take tower into the chat we'll make
00:23 - a tower so first we need a repeat loop
00:27 - repeat it for
00:29 - 10 times
00:30 - then inside the repeat loop we need
00:32 - another repeat loop repeat it for four
00:35 - times
00:36 - then
00:37 - in the advance we need the builder so
00:40 - because we're building
00:42 - a tower we
00:43 - we don't want to make it with our hands
00:45 - so the builder will help us
00:48 - so we need to do builder trace path from
00:52 - mark with
00:55 - with
00:56 - the
00:57 - polish and the scent so
00:59 - when the builder moves there will be the
01:03 - polished and set
01:05 - um with like
01:07 - we moving behind it so if i went here
01:09 - then there will be a polish polished
01:11 - innocent if i was to build
01:14 - then need to build and move forward by
01:17 - free
01:18 - and one
01:19 - by three
01:21 - so the builder will move free
01:23 - box but then it'll be like one side of
01:25 - the
01:26 - floor one of the top yeah then builders
01:28 - turn right so
01:30 - you know so this will be like a
01:34 - little square yeah three by three square
01:37 - like one two three one two
01:41 - three then one two three like that
01:45 - then
01:46 - out of the repeat four times we need a
01:48 - builder move up
01:51 - so build the
01:52 - move up
01:54 - by one
01:55 - so it'll make another level
01:58 - so there's ten levels then we need
02:01 - another repeat loop repeat four times
02:05 - and inside the repeat loop repeat three
02:09 - times
02:10 - [Music]
02:13 - call place
02:14 - and
02:16 - move so we're going to make a function
02:18 - called
02:20 - place
02:22 - and
02:23 - move
02:25 - and inside we're going to do
02:29 - place a stone wall
02:32 - place a stone wall so i do
02:38 - a cobblestone wall and then
02:40 - builder move forward by one so this is
02:43 - on the top so like you can kind of like
02:45 - it's like a watch tower and you can
02:47 - shoot opponents below and then
02:50 - you call place the move so you place the
02:53 - builder place and then move forward by
02:55 - one three times and then
02:58 - builder turn
02:59 - turn right
03:01 - so out of the repeat loop
03:03 - the builder will turn right so complete
03:05 - it look just like this
03:07 - so let's see
03:09 - go to a place
03:11 - and then tower
03:14 - to
03:14 - oh it's cut into the grass okay let's
03:18 - i wanna break that
03:22 - okay it's building
03:24 - so it's one side by one side yeah okay
03:27 - drop down one
03:29 - another one you can see a hole
03:32 - okay
03:33 - and then four
03:34 - so it's like
03:36 - like magically appear because it's
03:38 - invisible yeah okay another four how
03:41 - many floors have you been
03:45 - oh it's starting to rain
03:48 - dude
03:49 - let's
03:50 - set it
03:51 - to clear sky
03:53 - clear
03:56 - okay
03:58 - okay so it's clear again okay so while
04:02 - it's finishing the tower let's see it in
04:04 - python
04:04 - [Music]
04:10 - so in python it's define place and move
04:12 - to this place and move function further
04:14 - that plays cobblestone wall so the
04:16 - builder will place the wall and then
04:17 - build it up move forward
04:20 - then def on chat for index remains 10 so
04:23 - repeat 10 times then for index 2 in
04:25 - range 4 so it's the second loop four
04:28 - times build that trace path polish and
04:30 - the site builder that move forward three
04:33 - times and we build it up turn right turn
04:36 - and then add the
04:37 - repeat four times that
04:39 - the builder will move up to the next
04:41 - floor and then four index and range four
04:43 - times and then another loop for three
04:46 - times it would run the punch function
04:48 - place and move and then you will do
04:50 - builder that turn right turn and then
04:53 - play that on chat when you type tower on
04:55 - the chat it'll run the
04:57 - function
04:58 - okay
05:00 - and
05:01 - i think it's stopped when you go into
05:03 - this code yeah let's make another one
05:07 - right there
05:08 - clear space
05:11 - okay
05:12 - 13
05:13 - tower
05:15 - start building okay go into the middle
05:17 - we got stuck going to middle but we're
05:19 - in creative mode so we won't suffocate
05:22 - go into the oh no i always replaced it
05:25 - oh we're inside a block
05:27 - i want to get it out
05:30 - oh dude i can't wear and yeah
05:34 - oh i got out of it it's a quick escape
05:38 - it's still building
05:40 - still building
05:42 - okay let's drop down to count one two
05:46 - three one two
05:48 - three four
05:50 - four
05:51 - five six seven eight nine
05:55 - nine four
05:57 - nine still nine one okay there's a ten
06:00 - ten four okay
06:03 - okay still building it
06:06 - okay
06:08 - now there's a wall so this is like the
06:10 - little hole where you can shoot yeah so
06:12 - it's like a in pvp when you put this
06:16 - wall and you know like places place so
06:19 - you can go up and then you get
06:21 - it's a bunch attack
06:24 - so now i just want to get an error
06:27 - we're just going to get a bow because in
06:28 - creative
06:29 - you already have those
06:32 - you already have here and then like you
06:34 - do this so
06:36 - in survival you need to create a blocks
06:39 - to stand or ladder yeah and then it's
06:42 - just like
06:44 - it's like and then when somebody shoots
06:46 - arrows at you you just need to dodge
06:48 - them yeah
06:50 - yeah
06:51 - so the crossbar is actually faster but
06:53 - it takes super long time to reload yeah
06:57 - oh
06:59 - yeah we're shooting into the river
07:03 - oh
07:05 - you're missed
07:06 - okay
07:09 - yeah
07:10 - there's no splash
07:12 - yeah because you know it's the water
07:14 - there's just a thin little arrow
07:18 - okay look when it's the crossbars are
07:20 - loaded it'll stay reloaded so you can
07:22 - just shoot right away
07:26 - like it's so cool but yeah it needed a
07:28 - long time to really yeah
07:31 - this is your last era we will our shoot
07:34 - will go all the way to the sky
07:36 - so
07:37 - where did it go disappeared because it
07:40 - was so far
07:42 - and then there's lava pool over here and
07:43 - that's our first tower let's shoot which
07:46 - is incomplete because we went to the
07:48 - code
07:49 - the the
07:51 - [Music]
07:53 - you can see i know it's because it's so
07:56 - fast yeah this one's the completed one
07:58 - if you built a lot it will be like so
08:01 - cool
08:03 - if you built a lot of those like
08:04 - connected and you can make a kingdom or
08:07 - like a wall yeah this is a wall and
08:09 - watch towers
08:11 - yeah shoot
08:13 - well it's farther the
08:15 - it doesn't give it so much effect well
08:18 - this one does but you're here
08:22 - it looks so long
08:27 - arrow will you ever come back
08:30 - will you
08:31 - i think it says oh
08:34 - it's right here
08:36 - okay
08:38 - how about this one
08:40 - i don't think that bow will be too long
08:43 - yeah but still in your way
08:49 - right
08:51 - your brothers okay one more zero
08:54 - [Music]
08:55 - i like the crossbow more the moon
09:01 - okay well that was fun and that's it for
09:04 - today thank you for watching remember to

polish and the site builder that move forward three times and we build it up turn right turn and then add the repeat four times that the builder will move up to the next floor and then four index and range four times and then another loop for three times it would run the punch function place and move and then you will do builder that turn right turn and then play that on chat when you type tower on the chat it'll run the function okay and i think it's stopped when you go into this code yeah let's make another one right there clear space okay 13 tower start building okay go into the middle we got stuck going to middle but we're in creative mode so we won't suffocate go into the oh no i always replaced it oh we're inside a block i want to get it out oh dude i can't wear and yeah oh i got out of it it's a quick escape it's still building still building okay let's drop down to count one two three one two three four four five six seven eight nine nine four nine still nine one okay
