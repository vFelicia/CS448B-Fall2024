00:07 - so today we're in hour of code the
00:09 - villager and the elders so the basic
00:11 - story
00:11 - is that there are two villages the
00:14 - villager village
00:15 - and the elder village so
00:18 - they knew how to live together without
00:21 - the
00:22 - the help of the other village so now we
00:24 - are uniting them for six tests
00:27 - so today we're gonna go in to the
00:29 - villager
00:30 - village and we're going to go
00:33 - [Music]
00:34 - fix the farm so we're going to go past
00:37 - the rangers
00:38 - maybe they look so scary and then go
00:41 - past this
00:42 - bridge so we're going to talk to this
00:44 - farmer villager
00:46 - so the farmer says something keeps
00:47 - tearing up our beef oh no
00:50 - i'll just bet it's that scary ravager
00:52 - those illegals keep as a pet
00:54 - they keep denying about who else would
00:56 - do this you think you could build a
00:57 - fence around the farm to keep that rage
00:59 - out from star activity so you can see
01:02 - foxes over there so there are
01:04 - real things that keep on
01:07 - destroying these villagers
01:10 - somewhere impressive
01:16 - and we can give we can the agent can
01:19 - give itself
01:20 - bars on bars which we need to build the
01:22 - fence
01:23 - and the agent can place the bars down
01:27 - okay so
01:30 - first we're gonna do how many steps one
01:33 - two three four five and we need to do
01:36 - five
01:39 - so first for i
01:43 - range then we do
01:48 - five so repeat five times we'll do an
01:50 - agent
01:51 - dot give
01:56 - our bars
02:00 - bars comma one so because it will
02:03 - p then do agent dot
02:06 - move forward so we'll go forward because
02:11 - right now standing on the stone block we
02:13 - don't want it to build the fence on the
02:15 - stone block
02:16 - we're gonna build it on the wood blocks
02:19 - so then we're gonna do
02:20 - forward forward
02:24 - and then we're going to do agent dot
02:27 - place
02:29 - iron bar so now
02:37 - [Music]
02:45 - two two one
02:51 - [Music]
02:52 - so we're gonna do music let's see
02:56 - here's where i'm gonna do a comma
03:10 - and here comma okay
03:14 - that was
03:29 - place one down and place
03:36 - one down
03:40 - so we don't want to place forward this
03:42 - one block
03:47 - [Music]
03:49 - okay so i missed this one but we'll go
03:51 - back okay
03:52 - now we have three arm fences here
03:56 - so now i'm gonna change the direction
03:59 - is it still five i'm usually from five
04:02 - yes
04:03 - so now you go go
04:08 - and go left so we're gonna change the
04:12 - forward
04:14 - the left
04:18 - [Music]
04:20 - so now we have another side completed
04:23 - okay so
04:24 - now yeah
04:29 - [Applause]
04:30 - [Music]
04:35 - move left
04:38 - one more time so it stands on a stone
04:40 - block okay
04:42 - okay so now we're gonna do that code
04:44 - again
04:45 - and we're gonna change the left to
04:49 - backwards okay so it moves back up
04:52 - here well the engine won't crash herself
04:55 - because you code it
04:56 - to do whatever it's supposed to do
05:00 - do this okay so now when you
05:04 - move backward again one more time
05:08 - i'm going to do things like that move
05:16 - okay so now we have one more side
05:20 - so we're going to do that code again
05:23 - this time i'm going to do right
05:26 - [Music]
05:29 - so i'm going to change the left to
05:32 - right
05:34 - [Music]
05:37 - okay so now it's another
05:42 - side completed so again me and move one
05:45 - more time

07:09 - culprits
07:11 - then the caretaker says the villagers

07:15 - assumptions or treasures don't forget to
07:17 - check on your tree so now
07:19 - trees the foxes can't go inside
