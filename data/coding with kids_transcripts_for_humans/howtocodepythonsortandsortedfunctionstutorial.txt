00:00 - welcome to creating with kids my name is
00:03 - andrew and today we're going to
00:05 - teach you peppa so today we're going to
00:06 - learn about the sort and sorted
00:08 - functions
00:09 - so first we are going to do a list
00:12 - which has a bunch of numbers then we
00:15 - print a list before
00:16 - because we're going to change the list
00:18 - then we're going to print a list
00:20 - sort so i'm going to use the sort
00:21 - function we're just going to sort your
00:23 - list items then we're going to print a
00:26 - list afterwards now and save it
00:28 - and so did
00:31 - before this before and then when we did
00:34 - print a list of sort
00:36 - it did none because the sort function
00:38 - doesn't return anything
00:39 - then after the list now is sorted so
00:43 - it's not only five is one three because
00:46 - three is less than five next we'll do
00:50 - a list again and then we're gonna print
00:52 - those
00:53 - before and then we're gonna print a list
00:55 - that reverse
00:56 - now we're gonna use the reverse function
00:58 - which will reverse the order of your
01:00 - items
01:01 - then we're going to print a list after
01:03 - so now i'm going to save it
01:05 - and right so it did the before
01:08 - this and then the reverse function also
01:11 - doesn't return anything so it also
01:13 - prints
01:13 - none then there's the reverse list
01:17 - so free over here before was
01:21 - at the the last item now it's the first
01:23 - item so it reversed
01:25 - the orders of our items
01:28 - next we'll do a list again we're going
01:31 - to print
01:31 - a list before and we'll print sorted a
01:34 - list
01:35 - then we'll print a list after so now
01:37 - we're going to use the
01:38 - function
01:45 - so it did before
01:48 - and then now the sorted function returns
01:51 - something so it's the sorting list
01:53 - so it doesn't affect your regular list
01:55 - it makes a copy
01:57 - so there's one three five seven nine and
01:59 - then it does after
02:00 - so the regular that's the same as before
02:03 - next we're gonna do
02:05 - a list again i'm gonna print this
02:07 - reversed a list and another way to do it
02:10 - is print
02:10 - a list colon colon negative one so now
02:13 - we're going to do the reversed
02:15 - function so i did
02:20 - if it did three
02:23 - nine seven five one so that's reversed
02:26 - and the this one printed list
02:30 - quant negative one is the same as print
02:33 - list reversed
02:35 - list so reversed also returns your
02:37 - reverse list
02:39 - which is just like sorted before with
02:41 - the reverse function
02:42 - next we're going to do tuple equals e d
02:45 - c b a so this is a tuple with letters
02:49 - then we'll print tuple before and then
02:52 - print
02:52 - sorted tuples now i'm going to test the
02:55 - sorted
02:56 - function on a tuple and see if anything
02:58 - special happens
02:59 - you're going to print a tuple before
03:01 - after now
03:10 - when we do sort of function it does it
03:12 - turns the tuple
03:13 - into a list and then source the letters
03:16 - so the tuple turned into loops that's
03:18 - one thing that's special
03:20 - then after it's still the same
03:23 - next i'm going to try on a string so
03:26 - string
03:27 - equals hello there on our print string
03:30 - before
03:31 - then print sorted so to test the story
03:34 - on a string and you're going to print
03:36 - strings so i'm going to print it
03:39 - so did hello before and then when we
03:42 - sorted it
03:43 - it turned into lips and sorted its
03:45 - letters so now it's
03:47 - hello instead of hello after it's still
03:50 - hello
03:51 - the next word test it on a dictionary
03:54 - we have a dictionary with keys and
03:56 - values then we'll print predict
04:09 - this is a regular dictionary then it
04:12 - also turned it into a list
04:14 - so i sorted its keys not its values
04:18 - so did bird cat dog rabbit and then the
04:20 - after still the same
04:23 - so how do we do it if we want to sort
04:25 - the values
04:27 - so first i'm going to print sorted dicta
04:29 - items so the items in the dictionary
04:31 - are the pairs of keys and values
04:34 - then we're going to print a sorted value
04:37 - so this is how you
04:38 - sort these values in the dictionary then
04:41 - reference sorted
04:43 - dot values then we'll do reverse equals
04:45 - true
04:46 - so what this does last night does is
04:49 - that
04:49 - this first sorts the values of the
04:52 - dictionary
04:52 - and then it reverses the order because
04:55 - it reversed
04:56 - equals true
04:59 - so it first did the regular one then did
05:02 - one two three four which is
05:04 - the sorted of the values and then the
05:07 - reverse
05:09 - equals true did four three two one this
05:12 - is like a countdown
05:13 - next one do a list equals then there's
05:16 - negative numbers and regular numbers
05:19 - we're going to print sorted a list your
05:22 - prints sorted the list t equals
05:24 - abs so the key equals abs
05:28 - makes all these numbers regular numbers
05:30 - so the negative
05:31 - doesn't matter
05:35 - so i did this one then we're gonna list
05:39 - and then when did the abs
05:43 - it did negative one two negative forty
05:46 - four and negative five
05:47 - so the negatives now don't matter next
05:50 - we're gonna do a list inside the list
05:53 - then we're going to print sorted a list
05:55 - and we're going to print sorted a list
05:57 - t equals lambda item then item 2.
06:01 - so we in another video we learned about
06:04 - lambda functions so
06:06 - here the lambda function gets in the
06:09 - item
06:09 - index 2 which is which are the two g
06:12 - numbers
06:13 - 65 30 10 and 24
06:16 - and sorts these items by these two digit
06:20 - numbers now let's save it
06:21 - and run so did first the sort of
06:24 - function
06:25 - so which is sorted a list so sorted by
06:29 - his first element which is
06:30 - the word so so bird cat dog and rap
06:34 - then here let's look at the two digit
06:38 - numbers so first
06:39 - is 10 then 24 30 and 65
06:43 - so that worked well that was fun
06:46 - and that's it for today thank you for
06:48 - watching
06:49 - remember to smash the like button and
06:51 - subscribe
06:52 - bye bye
