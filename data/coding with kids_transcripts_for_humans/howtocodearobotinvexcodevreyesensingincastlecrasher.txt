00:00 - welcome to cutting with kids
00:03 - my name is kalia and my name is andrew
00:05 - today we're in vex code
00:08 - so today the project is about eyes
00:10 - dancing
00:11 - this example shows how we avoid falling
00:14 - with the eye
00:15 - sensor and find castles to crash into
00:18 - playground castle
00:22 - so we're gonna crash the castle so first
00:25 - we're gonna do a forever loop
00:27 - and then drive forward
00:29 - [Music]
00:39 - detects red
00:49 - [Music]
00:56 - so if it detects red it will stop
00:59 - because
00:59 - [Music]
01:01 - because no if the down
01:04 - eye detects red then we're going to
01:06 - drive reverse
01:08 - for one 1 000 millimeters
01:11 - 1000. so because on the edge
01:15 - there's red there's no wall yeah so
01:19 - on the edge there's red right before you
01:21 - fall so if we detect red on the floor
01:24 - then we drive reverse to avoid following
01:27 - yes
01:27 - then turn left
01:31 - turn left for pick at random
01:38 - times
01:40 - [Music]
01:52 - so 1 times 10 equals 10
01:56 - and it's going to choose 1 to 10 but
01:59 - there's also a times 10 so
02:00 - 1 times 10 is 10 2 times 10 times 10
02:04 - equals 100
02:05 - so we expect it to turn left for 10
02:09 - to and then it will pick a number from
02:12 - 10 to 100 degrees
02:14 - because um 10 times 10 times 10 equals
02:18 - 100
02:19 - and 1 times 10 equals 10.
02:22 - okay let's run it playground
02:26 - castle crashes yay so we don't
02:29 - know how many degrees it will turn yeah
02:32 - so far when it detects these lines
02:37 - it will drive reverse when it detected
02:40 - it would it drive you first at first
02:43 - oh that was so little yeah um
02:46 - we didn't question this maybe it will
02:49 - crash
02:50 - into it hmm that's a lot okay
02:53 - oh yeah
02:57 - oh you throw that out let's do it in 3d
03:00 - mode
03:00 - okay let's rinse the battery first and
03:02 - do 3d mode
03:04 - so now it's going to go another way
03:07 - because it picks around but first it
03:09 - will always flashing
03:11 - yeah because it's going to drive forward
03:13 - until it detects red
03:15 - on the floor and then it will drive
03:17 - reverse
03:20 - and turn a random amount of degrees yeah
03:57 - and that was fun and thanks for watching
04:01 - remember to smash your like and
04:03 - subscribe
04:05 - bye

welcome to cutting with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're in vex code so today the project is about eyes dancing this example shows how we avoid falling with the eye sensor and find castles to crash into playground castle so we're gonna crash the castle so first we're gonna do a forever loop and then drive forward detects red so if it detects red it will stop because because no if the down eye detects red then we're going to drive reverse for one 1 000 millimeters 1000. so because on the edge there's red there's no wall yeah so on the edge there's red right before you fall so if we detect red on the floor then we drive reverse to avoid following yes then turn left turn left for pick at random times so 1 times 10 equals 10 and it's going to choose 1 to 10 but there's also a times 10 so 1 times 10 is 10 2 times 10 times 10 equals 100 so we expect it to turn left for 10 to and then it will pick a number from 10 to 100 degrees because um 10 times 10 times 10 equals 100 and 1 times 10 equals 10. okay let's run it playground castle crashes yay so we don't know how many degrees it will turn yeah so far when it detects these lines it will drive reverse when it detected it would it drive you first at first oh that was so little yeah um we didn't question this maybe it will crash into it hmm that's a lot okay oh yeah oh you throw that out let's do it in 3d mode okay let's rinse the battery first and do 3d mode so now it's going to go another way because it picks around but first it will always flashing yeah because it's going to drive forward until it detects red on the floor and then it will drive reverse and turn a random amount of degrees yeah and that was fun and thanks for watching remember to smash your like and subscribe bye
