00:00 - welcome to cutting with kids my name is
00:03 - andrew today we're on minecraft
00:05 - education
00:06 - so we're in playful 101 lesson three so
00:08 - first
00:09 - we're going to talk to the ceo so the
00:12 - ceo says hey there it's good to see you
00:14 - again as we need your help at the
00:15 - company
00:16 - you would be surprised to know that
00:18 - software is used in every branch of
00:19 - mortar industry
00:21 - an example would be that we are
00:22 - developing software to help farmers
00:24 - this software makes people's lives
00:26 - easier and their jobs more efficient
00:28 - [Music]
00:34 - so the programmer says hello can you
00:36 - help me i need to make this sorting
00:37 - machine work but every time i run the
00:39 - code it gives me the wrong combination
00:41 - can you look at the sequence on the wall
00:43 - and write some that will give the right
00:44 - combination and
00:45 - chat turn your combination out by
00:47 - pressing the buttons in the same
00:48 - sequence
00:50 - so now we'll look at the variable
00:53 - sequences a
00:54 - c b and d so
00:57 - first we need to go to code builder
01:00 - so it says create two new new variables
01:04 - called
01:04 - b and c the value of b should be mount
01:07 - and the value of c
01:08 - should be apple so after a varies we're
01:12 - going to do
01:13 - c equals
01:16 - apple basically
01:23 - and b
01:38 - equals a so this
01:42 - will assign the fruit variable to a
01:44 - which is berry so
01:45 - then we're going to do play without say
01:47 - fruit so it'll say
01:48 - berry then
01:53 - here broken fruit equals
01:56 - c so now we're re-signing it
02:00 - to c so do when the player does say
02:03 - fruit it'll say
02:05 - apple then
02:08 - and do this one here and do fruit
02:12 - equals b so
02:15 - he'll say melon and then finally there's
02:18 - fruit equals d so do player dots say
02:23 - berries so run it
02:26 - okay so first
02:29 - let's just say berries apple melon soda
02:47 - the developer developer says could i ask
02:50 - for your help
02:50 - i need to plant these crops on a defined
02:52 - location
02:54 - however i always get the coordinates
02:56 - wrong
02:57 - can you write some code i'll place the
02:59 - right crops in the correct positions
03:00 - i'll turn on your world coordinates for
03:02 - you so you can see them on the top left
03:05 - hand corner
03:06 - okay so now we have our coordinates on
03:09 - so first we're gonna go here
03:14 - okay oh it was right above
03:18 - us and we need so the instruction says
03:20 - look at each of the five different
03:22 - location variables
03:23 - over here and see what crops are at
03:26 - these coordinates
03:27 - you can create five place block of
03:28 - positioning commands with either pumpkin
03:30 - or melon block at the correct location
03:33 - variable to master crop at the corner
03:35 - you see the coordinates and coding
03:36 - window at the same time click on the
03:38 - half coating window button and
03:40 - okay here so we can see our position
03:44 - so first
03:47 - we're going to do this so we're going to
03:50 - do
03:50 - blocks dot place
03:55 - black spot please melon
04:00 - [Music]
04:12 - so so the mountain block is at location
04:14 - one
04:16 - so we're gonna do block stop placement
04:18 - block location one
04:22 - so we're gonna add an underscore here
04:24 - and
04:26 - next we're do we can do after
04:29 - this box dot place
04:33 - whisper i'm going to do melon
04:38 - blank again and black
04:42 - and location two
04:46 - okay then we're gonna do
04:49 - for location for every blocks
04:53 - dot place pumpkin
04:59 - location free
05:03 - kitchen free and
05:06 - for location four we're gonna do blocks
05:09 - dot place
05:12 - pumpkin location
05:16 - full and finally
05:19 - we're gonna do blocks
05:23 - top place melon
05:28 - block at location
05:32 - five looks like the other melon blocks
05:35 - you
05:36 - did the l
05:50 - okay
05:52 - so now that all the firm is planted on
05:54 - the right board
05:56 - so i'm going to go to our last activity
05:58 - somewhere let's talk to the data
06:00 - scientist
06:01 - the data scientist says hi can you help
06:03 - me i need to calculate the sums of three
06:05 - different lists on the monitors
06:07 - but for some reason i always get the
06:08 - total cost wrong can you write some code
06:11 - to calculate the free different final
06:12 - cost
06:14 - so first here
06:18 - this says look at to use monitor one and
06:20 - calculate this sum
06:21 - shown by creating a new variable called
06:23 - cost run the code to show the total cost
06:25 - in the chat
06:26 - press the matching button for that total
06:29 - so
06:29 - we're going to create a new variable
06:32 - called cost so we'll add up
06:36 - all this stuff so first we're going to
06:39 - do apple
06:42 - plus melon
06:46 - plus berries
06:49 - star which is times two because there's
06:52 - the order two berries
06:56 - and then plus plus one potato
07:00 - okay so now we're right then we're going
07:03 - to
07:03 - player that's a cop so we know which
07:05 - costumer
07:08 - all right then we're gonna go to screen
07:10 - two
07:11 - so did calculate okay
07:14 - next look at a tv monitor number two you
07:18 - now need to add a new crop pumpkin
07:20 - do this by creating a variable called
07:21 - pumpkin okay
07:26 - and then set this value as a formula
07:28 - that is the difference between the
07:30 - variables
07:31 - berries and apples so berries and apples
07:34 - so 20 minus 10
07:36 - is 10. then add a new variable pumpkin
07:40 - to the variable cost then run the code
07:42 - and press the correct button
07:44 - so after potato and we're gonna add
07:48 - plus pump
07:51 - kit so we added pumpkin so now we're
07:54 - running this new
08:08 - tv monitor the value of the crops apple
08:10 - and melon have now changed
08:12 - apple has increased by price in two
08:16 - so we're going to change apples 10 to
08:18 - 12.
08:19 - melon has decreased in price by free
08:22 - it's been
08:23 - a minute okay somewhere change the melon
08:26 - to also 12.
08:27 - okay okay so now
08:32 - so we can see it okay so that costing
08:36 - was one apple
08:37 - one melon two berries
08:40 - one potato and one pumpkin so that's the
08:43 - same but we
08:44 - we increased the apple press and
08:46 - decreased the
08:48 - yeah so now we're let's see
08:52 - 76 press the button
08:58 - okay so we're going to go on the
08:59 - elevator because we're done
09:01 - you can press this so the
09:05 - door is closed and we're at the
09:06 - beginning again
09:08 - well that was fun and that's it for
09:11 - today
09:12 - thank you for watching remember to smash
09:14 - the like button and subscribe
09:16 - bye bye

block at the correct location variable to master crop at the corner you see the coordinates and coding window at the same time click on the half coating window button and okay here so we can see our

one so we're gonna add an underscore here and next we're do we can do after this box dot place whisper i'm going to do melon blank again and black and location two okay then we're gonna do for location for every blocks dot place pumpkin location free kitchen free and for location four we're gonna do blocks dot place pumpkin location full and finally we're gonna do blocks top place melon block at location five looks like the other melon blocks you did the l okay so now that all the firm is planted on the right board so i'm going to go to our last activity somewhere let's talk to the data scientist the data scientist says hi can you help me i need to calculate the sums of three different lists on the monitors but for some reason i always get the total cost wrong can you write some

star which is times two because there's the order two berries and then plus plus one potato okay so now we're right then we're going to player that's a cop so we know which costumer all right then we're gonna go to screen two so did calculate okay next look at a tv monitor number two you now need to add a new crop pumpkin do this by creating a variable called pumpkin okay and then set this value as a formula that is the difference between the variables berries and apples so berries and apples so 20 minus 10 is 10. then add a new variable pumpkin to the variable cost then run the code and press the correct button so after potato and we're gonna add plus pump kit so we added pumpkin so now we're running this new tv monitor the value of the crops apple and melon have now changed apple has increased by price in two so we're going to change apples 10 to 12. melon has decreased in price by free it's been a minute okay somewhere change the melon to also 12. okay okay so now so we can see it okay so that costing was one apple one melon two berries one potato and one pumpkin so that's the same but we we increased the apple press and decreased the yeah so now we're let's see 76 press the button okay so we're going to go on the elevator because we're done you can press this so the door is closed and we're at the beginning again well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
