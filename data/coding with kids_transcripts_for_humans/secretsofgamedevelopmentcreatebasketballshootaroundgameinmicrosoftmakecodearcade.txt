00:00 - welcome to cutting with kids my name is
00:04 - andrew today we're a microsoft maker
00:06 - a game where you have a character which
00:09 - is going left and right very fast and
00:11 - then you try to shoot it to the
00:14 - basketball bucket
00:16 - and then so i added a timer so here's
00:19 - the code on start so set background
00:21 - image to a bachelor port so i drew it
00:23 - myself
00:24 - there's a one a little pixel
00:29 - so step my sprite to sprite i'm a person
00:31 - of kind player so your player is just a
00:34 - random kid i could once pass the ball
00:38 - and set my spread position to x 78 y 97
00:42 - that's
00:50 - velocity to the x 150 and v y zero so
00:53 - it'll go left left to right keep going
00:57 - and then set my spray bouncing wall on
00:59 - so you don't want your sprite to
01:01 - disappear out of the screen and then
01:05 - set my sprite 2 to sprite um a yellow
01:08 - square of kind hoop
01:10 - so this is basically the basketball hoop
01:12 - and i set my sprite to position to x80
01:16 - 199 which is where the hoop is supposed
01:18 - to be
01:20 - and then on down button pressed set
01:23 - projectile to projectile basketball from
01:25 - my sprite with vx0 and v1 negative 100
01:29 - so when you press the down arrow key on
01:31 - your keyboard you will shoot the mask
01:34 - the basketball
01:36 - and then on sprite projectile overlaps
01:39 - other spread of kind hoops so when your
01:40 - ball it's the hoop they'll play some
01:43 - buzzer there's like a buzzer beater and
01:45 - then game over and then you win the game
01:48 - and then forever change time by one so
01:50 - time is the variable i made so basically
01:52 - the timer then pause every second
01:55 - to add one more onto the variable and
01:58 - then forever if time equals 15 then play
02:01 - sound buzzer and game over lose we have
02:04 - a
02:05 - second limit to get a bucket before you
02:08 - lose
02:10 - okay
02:11 - so now let's play i'm gonna go first
02:17 - you win is it do you think it's too easy
02:20 - um
02:28 - um
02:30 - [Applause]
02:30 - [Music]
02:49 - and so this is pixels per second so
02:51 - let's make it 200.
02:54 - oh
02:55 - it's very hot
02:57 - oh why
02:59 - oh

03:09 - um from spamming yeah
03:15 - you need to keep pressing okay
03:22 - i can't do that many clicks at one time
