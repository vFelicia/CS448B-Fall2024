00:01 - welcome to quitting with kids
00:03 - my name is andrew today we're in cod.org
00:06 - and
00:07 - this is the project i made called scary
00:09 - elsa and anna
00:11 - it's scary elsa let's see
00:15 - run from the scary elsa and
00:18 - oh no ah oh no there's attracting points
00:22 - two points okay now let's see how it
00:25 - goes
00:26 - so when run set actor one to baymax
00:29 - baymax is a character from big hero 6
00:33 - and actor 2 to elsa which is from frozen
00:37 - and set actor free to hero
00:40 - which is from big hero 6 2
00:43 - and set actor 4 to end another image
00:47 - so it's from frozen 2. then it will set
00:50 - a random background
00:52 - so it always have a different men have a
00:55 - different background
00:56 - it can be leafy grassy flower tile icy
00:59 - and snowy
00:59 - i couldn't choose which one so i chose
01:01 - random repeat forever
01:04 - move actor one random random pixels
01:07 - so after one can go up down left right
01:11 - or or random and it can go
01:14 - 25 50 100 200 or
01:18 - 400 pixels and i choose random so go
01:22 - so it'll go like random directions at
01:24 - random
01:25 - yeah pixels repeat forever move
01:28 - active for random and random it's just
01:31 - like
01:32 - actor one but just different actors no
01:35 - actor one actor four and actor two
01:38 - which is baymax anna and elsa
01:42 - you will move hero when up arrow pressed
01:46 - then move actor free up free actor free
01:50 - is hero so you need to move actor free
01:53 - then when down
01:54 - arrow it will move after free which is
01:58 - hero down when left arrow
02:01 - move after free left and right arrow it
02:04 - will move actively
02:06 - right so you can move hero with the
02:08 - arrow keys
02:10 - yeah when actor free touches actor one
02:12 - so when it touches
02:13 - baymax when he was touches baymax play
02:17 - win point two i didn't really like
02:20 - 1.1 so i choose 1.2 so it's like you get
02:23 - a point
02:24 - yeah it's a score point but over here
02:26 - you will lose points that's why it's
02:28 - called scary s and
02:29 - an honor so you shouldn't touch elsa and
02:32 - honor
02:32 - yeah when active3 touches actor 1 it
02:35 - will play win
02:36 - sound and score point but when you touch
02:39 - elsa he will touch elsa then play lose
02:42 - point
02:43 - no remove a point then when
02:46 - it touches on when hero touches on a 2
02:50 - it will play lose 0.2 because there's
02:53 - two of lose point sounds
02:56 - so i use the one for
02:59 - elsa and one for honor and both of them
03:02 - will remove a point
03:04 - no he will he will say
03:07 - no i lost the point and baymax
03:12 - because baymax is a robot with a lot of
03:14 - armor
03:15 - okay i do it first who i need to get 10
03:18 - points
03:24 - [Music]
03:27 - yeah cause they there's two evil people
03:33 - you got two points three points
03:38 - two points three points two points
03:41 - two points one point two point one point
03:49 - yes so like they can like go by you then
03:52 - like turn and
03:53 - like chase you yeah you don't know
03:57 - they're not coded actually to chase you
03:59 - there's just the
04:01 - code is said
04:04 - to go random and big max can also go
04:07 - where anna and elsa is
04:09 - so you can't get the points when baymax
04:11 - is in your aunt
04:13 - yeah you will just subtract points and
04:16 - get points
04:18 - so if you go near both of them
04:21 - you'll basically stay on the score you
04:23 - have right now
04:24 - yeah because you have the same score
04:29 - hmm elsa's kind of chasing you
04:33 - anna's looks like it's chasing baymax
