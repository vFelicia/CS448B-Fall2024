00:00 - welcome to coding with kids
00:03 - my name is kalia and my name is andrew
00:05 - today we're going to show you
00:07 - flex code and it let's call vr
00:10 - that is like scratch so first if you
00:13 - know scratch you
00:14 - might want to try this too yeah so first
00:17 - we're going to drive
00:18 - forward
00:24 - robot down pin down
00:28 - move roll my pen down then
00:31 - we need a while
00:35 - while um the distance
00:39 - is bigger than one thousand
00:42 - one thousand okay distant
00:48 - is in the sensing
00:52 - wow well this is
01:03 - red yes okay then
01:07 - we need another wild block okay
01:11 - then we're good if
01:15 - if the millimeters is
01:19 - bigger than 500.00
01:27 - it's bigger than 500
01:30 - then set robot color to
01:33 - blue to blue okay
01:37 - okay then it will stop
01:40 - driving if it's less than
01:44 - 500. okay okay i think
01:48 - when it starts it will drive forward
01:50 - then move robot
01:51 - hand down then while the distance is
01:54 - bigger than 1000 millimeters
01:58 - it will set the robot pin color to
02:01 - red then if the distance is
02:05 - less than 1000 and bigger than 500 it
02:08 - will set the rubber
02:09 - pen color to blue then it will start
02:12 - driving
02:13 - okay so we're gonna go to playgrounds
02:16 - we're gonna do grid map yeah there are
02:18 - different
02:19 - kinds of maps playgrounds and maps
02:23 - yes we're gonna choose grade maps yeah
02:26 - okay and then there's 2d and 3d
02:30 - okay in 2d first yeah
02:41 - stop because it's less than 500
02:43 - millimeters now
02:45 - let's do it to 3d now stop it first then
02:49 - we press
02:50 - reset okay and run no we do 3d first
02:56 - see it change blue
02:59 - now it stopped because the object in
03:02 - front of it is less than 500
03:04 - millimeters next we're going to show you
03:07 - another fun
03:08 - project so we're good okay we're gonna
03:11 - fill these blocks
03:13 - to trash we're gonna do a different pay
03:17 - down it's very fun
03:21 - we're gonna forever loop and drive
03:25 - forward and we're gonna
03:30 - do another program this time
03:36 - and it's called
03:39 - dynamics castle crasher
03:43 - okay see it's look it's dynamic
03:48 - it's very fun too it's like
03:52 - there will be castle and the robot will
03:55 - crash
03:56 - into it they can fall down too
04:00 - okay let's okay let's do 3d
04:06 - okay let's press run
04:12 - hmm
04:14 - and there is python 2. we're going to
04:17 - show you after
04:18 - it falls down
04:21 - and the robot is going to fall down oh
04:24 - no
04:25 - bye-bye he's going to fall for him
04:53 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to coding with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're going to show you flex code and it let's call vr that is like scratch so first if you know scratch you might want to try this too yeah so first we're going to drive forward robot down pin down move roll my pen down then we need a while while um the distance is bigger than one thousand one thousand okay distant is in the sensing wow well this is red yes okay then we need another wild block okay then we're good if if the millimeters is bigger than 500.00 it's bigger than 500 then set robot color to blue to blue okay okay then it will stop driving if it's less than 500. okay okay i think when it starts it will drive forward then move robot hand down then while the distance is bigger than 1000 millimeters it will set the robot pin color to red then if the distance is less than 1000 and bigger than 500 it will set the rubber pen color to blue then it will start driving okay so we're gonna go to playgrounds we're gonna do grid map yeah there are different kinds of maps playgrounds and maps yes we're gonna choose grade maps yeah okay and then there's 2d and 3d okay in 2d first yeah stop because it's less than 500 millimeters now let's do it to 3d now stop it first then we press reset okay and run no we do 3d first see it change blue now it stopped because the object in front of it is less than 500 millimeters next we're going to show you another fun project so we're good okay we're gonna fill these blocks to trash we're gonna do a different pay down it's very fun we're gonna forever loop and drive forward and we're gonna do another program this time and it's called dynamics castle crasher okay see it's look it's dynamic it's very fun too it's like there will be castle and the robot will crash into it they can fall down too okay let's okay let's do 3d okay let's press run hmm and there is python 2. we're going to show you after it falls down and the robot is going to fall down oh no byebye he's going to fall for him bye
