00:00 - welcome to cody with kids my name is
00:03 - andrew today we're in minecraft
00:05 - education so today i'm going to show you
00:07 - my project that i made called element
00:09 - master so i just got this idea from a
00:11 - comic i read it's just like
00:14 - cool yeah so there's there are three
00:16 - elements first fire and water so
00:19 - you just need to set it through
00:22 - this right here
00:27 - um so on command earth builder teleports
00:30 - zero zero zero so the builder is
00:32 - basically an invisible agent specialized
00:35 - and made for building it's literally
00:37 - called builder yeah so the builder will
00:38 - teleport to where you are and then
00:40 - builder will move forward by one
00:42 - build a race wall from mark was um
00:46 - three so so when it moves forward
00:49 - wherever it was it just was it will have
00:52 - a tower of three grass blocks and then
00:54 - i'll do the same thing so it'll be like
00:56 - a wall so it can protect you from ears
00:58 - and stuff
00:59 - so you can like make it longer over here
01:02 - it's just a basic like
01:04 - yeah this is two by three and then on
01:06 - chat command fire
01:08 - so builder teleport to where you are
01:10 - again so build a place mark and then
01:13 - builder trace path from mark with fire
01:15 - so here you just light a block of fire
01:17 - you will also get on fire so eat a
01:19 - golden apple or if you are a survival
01:22 - yeah or
01:24 - just let it be and let it be
01:28 - and you can set the mobs that are
01:30 - chasing you on fire
01:31 - make sure you don't get um put fire to
01:34 - the grass box around okay then on check
01:36 - them in water it'll build our teleports
01:38 - here zero zero and then be able to place
01:40 - mark and build a trace path for mark of
01:42 - water so it's basically the same thing
01:44 - as fire but here even if you place
01:46 - elements yeah if you place one block of
01:48 - water it will spread out so it can like
01:50 - get you and the mobs different
01:52 - directions so they can be farther from i
01:55 - don't know
01:56 - it's going to be bad
01:59 - yeah though
02:00 - they'll get damaged okay so now here is
02:03 - placehold to define on chat it's a
02:06 - function builder dot teleport to
02:08 - position zero zero zero further that
02:10 - place mark so place the mark and then
02:12 - it'll
02:13 - make one block fire so this is the fire
02:15 - element and then player dot chat will
02:17 - take fire on the chat it'll run the fire
02:19 - element
02:20 - and then for the second function builder
02:23 - teleport to position zero zero zero
02:25 - we're gonna replace the mark and then
02:27 - build a trace path from water so this is
02:29 - the water element and then clear the
02:31 - unchat water on chat too so when you
02:33 - take water in the chat it'll run it and
02:36 - then finally here is the earth so the
02:38 - builder will teleport to you then the
02:40 - builder will move forward and raise a
02:42 - wall of crafts blocks three blocks high
02:45 - and then it'll do it two times and then
02:47 - when you type earth on the chat channel
02:49 - run okay
02:51 - so now let's do
02:53 - okay so which one should we do first
03:02 - we just glitched and got stuck right in
03:05 - the wall this is a
03:07 - already a pretty tall wall i
03:10 - so this is pretty good okay so you can
03:13 - like make it longer and make this color
03:16 - like you can make it longer
03:18 - by like
03:19 - making a repeat block and like make a
03:22 - wall around your face yeah so this
03:24 - code can also be used to make a house
03:27 - easily okay
03:29 - next is
03:41 - i would recommend to move quickly so
03:43 - we're not going to get anything creative
03:45 - make sure you don't set fire to those
03:48 - uh players
03:50 - yeah or like grass blocks and treats
03:54 - finally except that you want to be very
03:56 - fun yeah
03:58 - but
03:59 - also spread it
04:01 - and then the enemies would go that way
04:04 - or this way
04:05 - yeah or that way or that way
04:08 - yeah okay or that way or that way okay a
04:11 - lot of direction okay so earth can't go
04:14 - into water so if we go here and type
04:17 - earth
04:21 - so now the water is gone look it's like
04:24 - a photo frame if you like make a higher
04:26 - bitcoin blocker okay so then fire
04:29 - counters earth
04:32 - jordan type fire it's like a paper
04:34 - scissors and then you can set fire to
04:36 - this whole thing
04:37 - okay i don't know which one is rocker
04:39 - paper or scissors
04:53 - okay so now i
04:58 - you can also do the earth two times on
05:01 - top of each other
05:03 - yeah
05:05 - yeah
05:08 - so you could do earth two times and then
05:10 - you could make a super deal
05:13 - okay
05:14 - it's kind of weird because um i was
05:17 - moving
05:19 - break things freaking
05:26 - okay
05:27 - now look at that that's a great
05:30 - expression oh it looks like this is the
05:32 - chimney and that's the handle of the hat
05:35 - yeah but the chimney's a little bit too
05:39 - thick
05:58 - wow that's the three elements
06:11 - um
06:29 - well that was fun and that's it for
06:31 - today thank you for watching remember to
06:34 - smash like button and subscribe bye bye
