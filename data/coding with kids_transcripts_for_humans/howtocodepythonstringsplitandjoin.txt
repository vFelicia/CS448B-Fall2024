00:00 - welcome to recruiting with kids my name
00:02 - is claire and my name is andrew today
00:04 - we're going to teach you python
00:06 - so today we're going to learn about
00:08 - string split and join so first
00:10 - we have msg which is message variable
00:13 - equals coding with kiss tutorial then
00:14 - there's a lot of spaces
00:16 - string split and joy and we have a
00:18 - second variable called
00:19 - oars equals emerald diamond collapsing
00:22 - iron which is a list of five fours
00:24 - from minecraft and there's the or list
00:27 - which is
00:28 - the list of the five cores so first
00:31 - we're going to do
00:32 - print list msg so it lists
00:36 - and makes our always list
00:39 - no it makes our msg into a bunch of
00:42 - letters
00:43 - so like there's a bunch of letters
00:45 - everywhere
00:47 - so then i'm gonna do
00:50 - print msg split
00:54 - so it splits
00:57 - our msg into words
01:00 - and there's no space that are here
01:04 - then we're gonna do print
01:08 - msg split then a space
01:12 - so now it includes the spaces that were
01:15 - not in the other
01:20 - then we're gonna play print type msg
01:24 - split
01:25 - so the type function is going to tell us
01:27 - the type of msc
01:28 - split so the class is
01:32 - list so msg.split the classes
01:38 - list
01:40 - print ores.split.com
01:44 - so it did the oars emerald diamond coal
01:47 - lapis and iron
01:51 - then print dash dot join or's list
01:56 - so so it did
02:00 - emerald dash diamond dash call dash
02:02 - lapis dash iron so it did
02:04 - dashes in between the orders
02:08 - and then we're going to do print dash
02:11 - dot join
02:12 - or list plus or is list so this time we
02:14 - did a plus always list
02:16 - so so it basically is the same as the
02:19 - last time except it repeated the list of
02:22 - ores
02:23 - so you can repeat it by doing the plus
02:27 - i'm going to do print then empty then
02:30 - dot
02:31 - join or list so
02:34 - it squished all the words together like
02:37 - they have no space
02:46 - then do print then empty again that you
02:49 - want msg
02:50 - split so it
02:53 - also did the same thing i squish the
02:56 - words together
02:58 - then we're going to do print msg replace
03:02 - this two empty this empty space with
03:06 - no no space so now we also squish the
03:10 - words together
03:12 - because it replaces these spaces with no
03:15 - space
03:16 - then we have the oars the oars
03:19 - variable again but with commas
03:22 - colon and the semicolon so
03:26 - then learn print comma join comma dot
03:29 - join or stop split
03:31 - semicolon dot split colon dot split
03:35 - com so that's a lot of splits
03:38 - so squish the words together all right
03:41 - oops
03:42 - me and save and then so did emerald
03:45 - diamond collapse and iron separated by
03:50 - by commas so remove the colon and the
03:53 - semicolon
03:55 - so another way to do this is to print
03:57 - replace
03:58 - or that replace the semicolon with comma
04:02 - and replace
04:02 - the colon with a comma split
04:06 - so let's say so it does the same thing
04:10 - as
04:10 - but it added the word replace that
04:14 - there is also no colon and no semicolon
04:18 - well that was fun and that's it for
04:20 - today
04:21 - thank you for watching remember to smash

04:26 - bye bye

welcome to recruiting with kids my name is claire and my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python so today we're going to learn about string split and join so first we have msg which is message variable equals coding with kiss tutorial then there's a lot of spaces string split and joy and we have a second variable called oars equals emerald diamond collapsing iron which is a list of five fours from minecraft and there's the or list which is the list of the five cores so first we're going to do print list msg so it lists and makes our always list no it makes our msg into a bunch of letters so like there's a bunch of letters everywhere so then i'm gonna do print msg split so it splits our msg into words and there's no space that are here then we're gonna do print msg split then a space so now it includes the spaces that were not in the other then we're gonna play print type msg split so the type function is going to tell us the type of msc split so the class is list so msg.split the classes list print ores.split.com so it did the oars emerald diamond coal lapis and iron then print dash dot join or's list so so it did emerald dash diamond dash call dash lapis dash iron so it did dashes in between the orders and then we're going to do print dash dot join or list plus or is list so this time we did a plus always list so so it basically is the same as the last time except it repeated the list of ores so you can repeat it by doing the plus i'm going to do print then empty then dot join or list so it squished all the words together like they have no space then do print then empty again that you want msg split so it also did the same thing i squish the words together then we're going to do print msg replace this two empty this empty space with no no space so now we also squish the words together because it replaces these spaces with no space then we have the oars the oars variable again but with commas colon and the semicolon so then learn print comma join comma dot join or stop split semicolon dot split colon dot split com so that's a lot of splits so squish the words together all right oops me and save and then so did emerald diamond collapse and iron separated by by commas so remove the colon and the semicolon so another way to do this is to print replace or that replace the semicolon with comma and replace the colon with a comma split so let's say so it does the same thing as but it added the word replace that there is also no colon and no semicolon well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
