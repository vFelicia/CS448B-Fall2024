00:00 - welcome to cing with kids my name is
00:02 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in a
00:04 - Minecraft education Edition So today
00:06 - we're going to do python 101 lesson 10
00:09 - so this is the last lesson so first
00:11 - let's talk to the CEO he says I want to
00:13 - thank you for being of such a great help
00:16 - here at coding mine we just need your
00:18 - help with one last thing we want to ship
00:20 - the agent out to the public however we
00:22 - need to stress test it a bit more first
00:25 - that is why we have developed a testing
00:26 - area where you will be able to complete
00:28 - challenges that will test the usefulness
00:30 - of the
00:31 - agent so now you can also compete
00:34 - against a friend and press two players
00:36 - but right now we're only going to do one
00:39 - player so we're going here and then here
00:42 - then we're going to have to complete a
00:44 - certain amount of challenges within and
00:47 - each challenge has like 300 seconds so
00:51 - our first challenge is blinding lights
00:52 - so you can see a timer at the top for
00:55 - each challenge so first blinding lights
01:00 - make the agent place the Redstone lamps
01:02 - in its inventory on top of the redstone
01:04 - blocks while walking toward forwards on
01:07 - the walkway to the gold block so here we
01:09 - have to place the Redstone lamps on the
01:11 - redstone blocks so first we can see a
01:15 - pattern here there's one on the right
01:18 - then you walk two times there's left and
01:21 - then it repeats until it goes all the
01:23 - way to the gold
01:25 - block so let's do a
01:28 - loop for our Y in range we're going to
01:33 - do one two three three
01:38 - times we're going to
01:41 - do um agent.
01:44 - Place
01:46 - uh we're going to do right
01:49 - first then we're going to do agent.
01:52 - move oh and
01:54 - include the column and the tab
02:00 - then forward
02:03 - two then we're going to do agent.
02:07 - place
02:11 - left then after we go left we're going
02:14 - to do move forward
02:18 - again to the right one to the uh
02:22 - redstone blocks on the right so now
02:23 - let's run
02:27 - it says placing all the blocks
02:30 - and now I reached the gold block so now
02:32 - it'll see correct and it'll go to Nick's
02:34 - challenge so if you do anything wrong
02:36 - you can also go to here and press the
02:38 - button to reset the challenge so now we
02:41 - have to can you well
02:45 - uh can you make the agent move over
02:47 - every block in the area sideways row by
02:49 - row without a turning so the agent has a
02:52 - turn a commands which would take more
02:55 - time but we have a way of we a shorter
02:57 - way of getting here of getting to the
02:59 - gold block without making a turn so we
03:02 - can also make it go sideways by doing
03:04 - agent. move right or left so first we're
03:07 - going to make it go right one 2 3 4 five
03:11 - 6 seven eight eight times so we're going
03:15 - to do agent do
03:18 - move right I'm going do eight times then
03:23 - to go to the next row we have to go to
03:26 - agent. move forward one
03:30 - then we're going to go
03:32 - left eight
03:35 - times and then move forward to the next
03:38 - set of rows and then we're going to
03:40 - repeat all this with a four with a four
03:43 - Loop for I in range we're going to do it
03:47 - let's
03:49 - see one two three four four
03:55 - times and then we're going to add the
03:58 - Colin and
04:07 - tab then we're going to run it and we
04:11 - may have to make it go forward the last
04:14 - time or maybe not so go first pair of
04:18 - rows now second pair of rows third pair
04:22 - and the final fourth then reach the gold
04:26 - blocks next we have pumpkin or Melon
04:29 - okay so our next challenge is to destroy
04:34 - the melon so make the agent move forward
04:36 - to the gold block while breaking the
04:38 - melons but leaving the pumpkins alone so
04:40 - the green blocks are melons and the
04:42 - orange ones are pumpkins so I like to do
04:46 - it manually so you can just code the
04:48 - agents to move forward and break the
04:49 - melon blocks another way to do it is to
04:52 - do a repeat Loop and where the agent
04:54 - inspects each block on his right and if
04:56 - it's a melon it will uh destroy the
04:59 - block I I will use the manual way so
05:03 - first we can see the first first three
05:06 - pump uh melons are in a pattern so we're
05:10 - going to make the agent
05:11 - move first I'm going to make the agent
05:16 - go move
05:17 - forward one
05:22 - time then we can go in a repeat
05:27 - Loop so for
05:31 - I in range and do it three
05:36 - times we're going to do agent. destroy
05:39 - on its right and then I'm going to do
05:43 - agent. move forward two times to the
05:46 - next pumpkin I mean to the next
05:50 - melon
05:55 - then uh I think that works let's see
06:01 - destroy destroy and
06:03 - Destroy so now I'm kind of miss one
06:06 - pumpkin so it's to move backwards and
06:09 - then destroy
06:11 - it so we're going to delete the four
06:14 - Loop and we're going to agent.
06:19 - move uh
06:21 - back one time and then destroy the
06:27 - right so now we only you need to move
06:30 - forward three times destroy and
06:33 - move to the gold
06:39 - block move forward three times dest dra
06:42 - right and then move one more time to the
06:45 - gold
06:49 - block destroy the melon and then onto
06:52 - our next challenge so our next
06:55 - challenge we're going to we delete the
06:59 - quote so already deleted that from the
07:00 - beginning and end of each line finish
07:02 - the code so that the agent moves towards
07:04 - the gold block and counts each diamond
07:06 - block it passes over at the end when the
07:08 - agent reaches the to the gold block the
07:11 - agent should then place the number of
07:13 - diamond blocks passed over in front of
07:14 - it one by one these blocks will be
07:17 - automatically stacked by a
07:20 - piston
07:22 - so now we're going to add an if Loop
07:26 - right
07:27 - here if agent.
07:31 - inspect so here it inspects a block
07:35 - somewhere so we're going to do it
07:39 - down down and then it'll get the type of
07:42 - the block and equals
07:45 - diamond
07:49 - block diamond
07:52 - [Music]
07:55 - block here we're going to
07:59 - add one one to the variable Diamond
08:02 - which helps the agent
08:04 - count um the number of diamonds it
08:07 - passed
08:09 - over now we're going to run
08:13 - it and then it'll just all you can see
08:16 - is just going all the way here so now
08:19 - it's going to stack the number of
08:20 - diamond blocks passed over using data
08:22 - from the variable so now we got it on to
08:26 - your next challenge what's that syntax
08:29 - this one is kind of fun so here we have
08:32 - custom blocks which syntax left
08:35 - parenthesis right parenthesis quotation
08:37 - marks commas columns and
08:40 - periods so here our instructions are the
08:44 - code below is missing all of his syntax
08:46 - add the correct syntax in the coding wi
08:48 - to make the code run then place the
08:50 - matching missing syntax blocks in the
08:52 - world so have to do stuff manually so
08:55 - here's the sample code we have to fix
08:57 - the sample code and add the syntax so
08:59 - first we have a four Loop so for I and
09:02 - range is correct then we have to add
09:04 - parentheses
09:06 - 10 that's the parentheses are the mixing
09:08 - missing uh syntax then we also have to
09:12 - add a colum for the for Loop tab doesn't
09:16 - matter because it's already there so
09:18 - agent so for the function we have to do
09:20 - agent dot move so we have a a a period
09:25 - there and then we also have parentheses
09:27 - and a comma for the the second line then
09:30 - for the third line we have to do player.
09:33 - save because it's another function then
09:36 - we're going to do parenthesis
09:39 - finished so here we're wishing we're U
09:42 - missing the period the parenthesis and
09:44 - the quotation
09:46 - marks
09:48 - so
09:52 - here we're going to
09:54 - go the agent to Gold
09:57 - block then we're going to get the
09:59 - quotation
10:03 - blocks and then we're going to add the
10:05 - missing syntax so here first in the
10:08 - first line we're missing two parentheses
10:10 - and
10:13 - a so we're going to add these blocks
10:16 - right that seems so fun call yeah it is
10:19 - so fun they also extra blocks so in case
10:22 - you make any mistakes you can just keep
10:25 - doing it then second line we have a
10:29 - period
10:31 - first period Then parentheses then
10:35 - parentheses comma and
10:40 - parenthesis uh this is comma okay then
10:44 - for our last line we have a period
10:47 - parenthesis and quotations so period
10:53 - parentheses and then the two
10:56 - quotations so this is probably the most
10:59 - fun next is challenge spring arrival so
11:03 - here we have to in the coding window you
11:07 - have been giving a code that does not
11:09 - work delete the quotes in the beginning
11:10 - and end of each line this code is
11:12 - supposed to plant flowers on each block
11:14 - of grass for making the agent move
11:15 - through the area row by row can you
11:17 - finish The Code by adding conditional
11:19 - UND debuging the main Loop so first
11:21 - we're going to move the
11:24 - quotations so the code will can run
11:33 - okay then we're going to have to look
11:36 - for
11:39 - um debugs well
11:43 - bugs and we have to add a
11:46 - condition I think so here we're trying
11:49 - to put roses I think on each of the
11:54 - grass
11:57 - blocks so now I fixed it and now here we
12:02 - have to change from the four repeat Loop
12:03 - to five so that it will match up and
12:07 - reach the gold
12:09 - block then here instead of the if true
12:12 - because then it will place block it'll
12:15 - try to place a rows on every single
12:17 - block which is uh not good we're going
12:21 - to change the AG to Asian inspect and
12:24 - look down and see if it's grass then it
12:28 - if it it is grass it will Pro place down
12:31 - the rose if not it will move forward
12:33 - then the others are just uh the agent.
12:35 - move and turns to go down the rose so
12:38 - now we're going to run it and you should
12:40 - place the Roses on the uh grass
12:45 - blocks so one
12:47 - rows two
12:52 - rows sometimes it would just walk so
12:54 - slow we got the third rows we got the
12:59 - fourth rows and then the last rows and
13:03 - then now it only needs to reach the gold
13:06 - block okay correct now our next
13:09 - challenge okay so for our next challenge
13:12 - it's very simple first we have to make
13:14 - the agent mine the diamond ore behind it
13:16 - and then drop the M Diamond into
13:17 - collection area at the other end make
13:19 - the agent return mine the emerald ore
13:21 - that will appear and drop it in the
13:22 - collection area so basically the agent
13:24 - is the minor so first we're going to do
13:29 - a repeat Loop since we have to do
13:30 - diamond and emerald so for Iron Range
13:33 - two times we're going to first agent.
13:37 - destroy in the
13:39 - back then we have to do asent do collect
13:41 - all to get the diamond and
13:44 - emeralds um then we're going to agent do
13:47 - move forward eight times to the pit
13:51 - we're going to drop
13:52 - all agent. drop
13:55 - all then we're going to move back to the
13:58 - block
13:59 - Place m. move back eight times and then
14:06 - it should run for both the diamond and
14:08 - the
14:11 - emerald so now there's also extra
14:14 - XP the agent's fast yeah it's so fast
14:17 - correct next challenge is diamond or
14:20 - dirt so here we have three diamond
14:23 - blocks and three dirt blocks so here we
14:26 - have to place the blocks in the gold
14:27 - blocks for us okay so here first it's a
14:32 - math question write some codes to
14:34 - calculate the aners to these four
14:36 - Expressions shown here you need to get
14:38 - the agent to Gold block do this by
14:40 - placing a diamond or dirt block from the
14:42 - chest depending on the answer of
14:43 - expression from left to right if the
14:45 - answer is one place a diamond block if
14:47 - it's zero place a dirt block so here we
14:50 - can easily solve this by using a pretty
14:53 - fun function so here in Python it's
14:57 - pretty easy to solve an expression today
14:59 - we're going to use agent do wait we're
15:01 - going to do player. say this will help
15:04 - us this will make us a run uh say
15:08 - something in chat so we're going to copy
15:10 - the Expressions we're going to put them
15:12 - in say then the function will solve the
15:17 - expression and write and our player will
15:21 - say the answer we're going to do the
15:22 - same for all of these um expressions and
15:28 - the the answer is will only be one or
15:31 - zero okay so we're going
15:34 - to do this and
15:38 - then if it's one I think if it's one you
15:42 - place a diamond block if it's zero you
15:45 - place a dirt
15:47 - block okay then we're going to last
15:53 - one
15:55 - uh now we're going to run it
15:59 - so here we have one0 one0 so we place
16:04 - one diamond block one dirt block diamond
16:07 - block and one dirt
16:09 - block now we're going to do agent. move
16:18 - forward agent. move forward how many
16:24 - times 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 eight six okay eight
16:39 - times so we can walk over the air last
16:43 - challenge is the agent librant it's
16:45 - basically a maze navigate the agent
16:47 - through the maze write some code to use
16:49 - the colored blocks as forward left and
16:51 - right controls for the agent movement
16:53 - then control the agent to the end of the
16:54 - maze by standing on the colored
16:57 - blocks so here you just have to get the
16:59 - agent through the maze so first we going
17:02 - to move forward three times two oh yeah
17:08 - two agent
17:10 - do move for two
17:14 - times we're going to run
17:18 - that then we're going to move it right
17:21 - one two 3 four five times and then move
17:25 - forward two times
17:27 - again yeah
17:35 - for two
17:43 - times then next we have to move
17:52 - left write three times
18:00 - okay so now we have to move left five
18:03 - times six times six
18:07 - times left six times then it to also
18:11 - move forward two times right
18:14 - yeah one two
18:21 - yes next we have to finally move left
18:24 - four
18:27 - times then we can delete the forward
18:30 - we're going to run
18:33 - it and now
18:36 - correct so congratulations lesson
18:38 - complete your score is nine so your
18:40 - score is like based on how many
18:42 - challenges you completed correctly so
18:44 - there are 10 challenges okay so now we
18:48 - basically completed python 101 well that
18:51 - was fun and that's it for today thank
18:53 - you for watching Remember to smash the
18:55 - like button and subscribe
18:57 - byebye one 1 0
19:00 - right
19:03 - so
19:06 - this
19:09 - no okay

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to cing with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in a Minecraft education Edition So today we're going to do python 101 lesson 10 so this is the last lesson so first let's talk to the CEO he says I want to thank you for being of such a great help here at coding mine we just need your help with one last thing we want to ship the agent out to the public however we need to stress test it a bit more first that is why we have developed a testing area where you will be able to complete challenges that will test the usefulness of the agent so now you can also compete against a friend and press two players but right now we're only going to do one player so we're going here and then here then we're going to have to complete a certain amount of challenges within and each challenge has like 300 seconds so our first challenge is blinding lights so you can see a timer at the top for each challenge so first blinding lights make the agent place the Redstone lamps in its inventory on top of the redstone blocks while walking toward forwards on the walkway to the gold block so here we have to place the Redstone lamps on the redstone blocks so first we can see a pattern here there's one on the right then you walk two times there's left and then it repeats until it goes all the way to the gold block so let's do a loop for our Y in range we're going to do one two three three times we're going to do um agent. Place uh we're going to do right first then we're going to do agent. move oh and include the column and the tab then forward two then we're going to do agent. place left then after we go left we're going to do move forward again to the right one to the uh redstone blocks on the right so now let's run it says placing all the blocks and now I reached the gold block so now it'll see correct and it'll go to Nick's challenge so if you do anything wrong you can also go to here and press the button to reset the challenge so now we have to can you well uh can you make the agent move over every block in the area sideways row by row without a turning so the agent has a turn a commands which would take more time but we have a way of we a shorter way of getting here of getting to the gold block without making a turn so we can also make it go sideways by doing agent. move right or left so first we're going to make it go right one 2 3 4 five 6 seven eight eight times so we're going to do agent do move right I'm going do eight times then to go to the next row we have to go to agent. move forward one then we're going to go left eight times and then move forward to the next set of rows and then we're going to repeat all this with a four with a four Loop for I in range we're going to do it let's see one two three four four times and then we're going to add the Colin and tab then we're going to run it and we may have to make it go forward the last time or maybe not so go first pair of rows now second pair of rows third pair and the final fourth then reach the gold blocks next we have pumpkin or Melon okay so our next challenge is to destroy the melon so make the agent move forward to the gold block while breaking the melons but leaving the pumpkins alone so the green blocks are melons and the orange ones are pumpkins so I like to do it manually so you can just code the agents to move forward and break the melon blocks another way to do it is to do a repeat Loop and where the agent inspects each block on his right and if it's a melon it will uh destroy the block I I will use the manual way so first we can see the first first three pump uh melons are in a pattern so we're going to make the agent move first I'm going to make the agent go move forward one time then we can go in a repeat Loop so for I in range and do it three times we're going to do agent. destroy on its right and then I'm going to do agent. move forward two times to the next pumpkin I mean to the next melon then uh I think that works let's see destroy destroy and Destroy so now I'm kind of miss one pumpkin so it's to move backwards and then destroy it so we're going to delete the four Loop and we're going to agent. move uh back one time and then destroy the right so now we only you need to move forward three times destroy and move to the gold block move forward three times dest dra right and then move one more time to the gold block destroy the melon and then onto our next challenge so our next challenge we're going to we delete the quote so already deleted that from the beginning and end of each line finish the code so that the agent moves towards the gold block and counts each diamond block it passes over at the end when the agent reaches the to the gold block the agent should then place the number of diamond blocks passed over in front of it one by one these blocks will be automatically stacked by a piston so now we're going to add an if Loop right here if agent. inspect so here it inspects a block somewhere so we're going to do it down down and then it'll get the type of the block and equals diamond block diamond block here we're going to add one one to the variable Diamond which helps the agent count um the number of diamonds it passed over now we're going to run it and then it'll just all you can see is just going all the way here so now it's going to stack the number of diamond blocks passed over using data from the variable so now we got it on to your next challenge what's that syntax this one is kind of fun so here we have custom blocks which syntax left parenthesis right parenthesis quotation marks commas columns and periods so here our instructions are the code below is missing all of his syntax add the correct syntax in the coding wi to make the code run then place the matching missing syntax blocks in the world so have to do stuff manually so here's the sample code we have to fix the sample code and add the syntax so first we have a four Loop so for I and range is correct then we have to add parentheses 10 that's the parentheses are the mixing missing uh syntax then we also have to add a colum for the for Loop tab doesn't matter because it's already there so agent so for the function we have to do agent dot move so we have a a a period there and then we also have parentheses and a comma for the the second line then for the third line we have to do player. save because it's another function then we're going to do parenthesis finished so here we're wishing we're U missing the period the parenthesis and the quotation marks so here we're going to go the agent to Gold block then we're going to get the quotation blocks and then we're going to add the missing syntax so here first in the first line we're missing two parentheses and a so we're going to add these blocks right that seems so fun call yeah it is so fun they also extra blocks so in case you make any mistakes you can just keep doing it then second line we have a period first period Then parentheses then parentheses comma and parenthesis uh this is comma okay then for our last line we have a period parenthesis and quotations so period parentheses and then the two quotations so this is probably the most fun next is challenge spring arrival so here we have to in the coding window you have been giving a code that does not work delete the quotes in the beginning and end of each line this code is supposed to plant flowers on each block of grass for making the agent move through the area row by row can you finish The Code by adding conditional UND debuging the main Loop so first we're going to move the quotations so the code will can run okay then we're going to have to look for um debugs well bugs and we have to add a condition I think so here we're trying to put roses I think on each of the grass blocks so now I fixed it and now here we have to change from the four repeat Loop to five so that it will match up and reach the gold block then here instead of the if true because then it will place block it'll try to place a rows on every single block which is uh not good we're going to change the AG to Asian inspect and look down and see if it's grass then it if it it is grass it will Pro place down the rose if not it will move forward then the others are just uh the agent. move and turns to go down the rose so now we're going to run it and you should place the Roses on the uh grass blocks so one rows two rows sometimes it would just walk so slow we got the third rows we got the fourth rows and then the last rows and then now it only needs to reach the gold block okay correct now our next challenge okay so for our next challenge it's very simple first we have to make the agent mine the diamond ore behind it and then drop the M Diamond into collection area at the other end make the agent return mine the emerald ore that will appear and drop it in the collection area so basically the agent is the minor so first we're going to do a repeat Loop since we have to do diamond and emerald so for Iron Range two times we're going to first agent. destroy in the back then we have to do asent do collect all to get the diamond and emeralds um then we're going to agent do move forward eight times to the pit we're going to drop all agent. drop all then we're going to move back to the block Place m. move back eight times and then it should run for both the diamond and the emerald so now there's also extra XP the agent's fast yeah it's so fast correct next challenge is diamond or dirt so here we have three diamond blocks and three dirt blocks so here we have to place the blocks in the gold blocks for us okay so here first it's a math question write some codes to calculate the aners to these four Expressions shown here you need to get the agent to Gold block do this by placing a diamond or dirt block from the chest depending on the answer of expression from left to right if the answer is one place a diamond block if it's zero place a dirt block so here we can easily solve this by using a pretty fun function so here in Python it's pretty easy to solve an expression today we're going to use agent do wait we're going to do player. say this will help us this will make us a run uh say something in chat so we're going to copy the Expressions we're going to put them in say then the function will solve the expression and write and our player will say the answer we're going to do the same for all of these um expressions and the the answer is will only be one or zero okay so we're going to do this and then if it's one I think if it's one you place a diamond block if it's zero you place a dirt block okay then we're going to last one uh now we're going to run it so here we have one0 one0 so we place one diamond block one dirt block diamond block and one dirt block now we're going to do agent. move forward agent. move forward how many times 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 eight six okay eight times so we can walk over the air last challenge is the agent librant it's basically a maze navigate the agent through the maze write some code to use the colored blocks as forward left and right controls for the agent movement then control the agent to the end of the maze by standing on the colored blocks so here you just have to get the agent through the maze so first we going to move forward three times two oh yeah two agent do move for two times we're going to run that then we're going to move it right one two 3 four five times and then move forward two times again yeah for two times then next we have to move left write three times okay so now we have to move left five times six times six times left six times then it to also move forward two times right yeah one two yes next we have to finally move left four times then we can delete the forward we're going to run it and now correct so congratulations lesson complete your score is nine so your score is like based on how many challenges you completed correctly so there are 10 challenges okay so now we basically completed python 101 well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash the like button and subscribe byebye one 1 0 right so this no okay
