00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in
00:05 - edible edibit is a platform where there
00:07 - are lots and lots of coding problems and
00:10 - then you have to solve them with
00:12 - um different coding languages So today
00:14 - we're going to do three problems using
00:17 - python so our first problem is called
00:21 - equality of three values create our
00:24 - instructions are to create a function
00:26 - that takes free integer arguments a b
00:29 - and c and Returns the amount of integers
00:31 - which are of equal value
00:33 - here are some examples so it will give
00:36 - us three numbers so in this example it's
00:39 - three four and three so we need to
00:42 - um you get a function to return how many
00:45 - numbers are equal so here there are two
00:47 - threes so we will return two and then
00:50 - here all of them are one so that means
00:53 - they're all equal so we return three and
00:55 - then here there's three four and one
00:57 - none of them are equal so return zero
00:59 - your function must return zero two or
01:01 - three let's see a code
01:04 - so we have a function called equal and
01:06 - we have three variables a b and c so
01:09 - first we're going to make a variable
01:10 - called num and it's going to start with
01:13 - as zero then if a is equal to B and B is
01:19 - equal to C so if they're all equal we're
01:22 - going to get the num and restate it to
01:24 - three because all the free numbers are
01:27 - equal yeah so we use two uh equal marked
01:30 - signs to actually mean equal not to
01:33 - State like number is zero okay then
01:37 - we're going to do else if a is b or a is
01:42 - C or B is C so if they're each other
01:46 - then L num equals two
01:49 - there are two numbers that are equal and
01:51 - then if none of these not if if an L if
01:55 - don't work we're going to go to else and
01:58 - we're just going to do num equals zero
01:59 - because none of them are equal yeah and
02:02 - then we're going to return the num
02:04 - variable so now let's check and see the
02:07 - test the test will go three random
02:09 - numbers here and then oh
02:13 - here there's the number that we need to
02:16 - return using the num variable and then
02:19 - here are what here are what the numbers
02:23 - are so like two three and four all
02:25 - values are different so when you turn
02:27 - zero that's the console so all this past
02:29 - test pass test our pass yay next one our
02:34 - next problem is called temperature
02:35 - conversion write a program that takes a
02:38 - temperature input in Celsius which is
02:40 - variable and converts it to Fahrenheit
02:43 - and Kelvin so verified and Kelvin are
02:45 - both
02:47 - um units of temperature return the
02:50 - converted temperature and values in a
02:52 - list the formulas that calculate the
02:54 - temperature in Fahrenheit from Celsius
02:55 - is this is the formula from Celsius to
02:58 - Fahrenheit and this is the formula for
03:00 - Celsius to Kelvin so here are examples
03:03 - so it'll just give us um the Celsius
03:07 - and then when you return the fahrenheit
03:09 - and the Kelvin so return invalid if K is
03:13 - less than zero so K is Kelvin and our
03:15 - term calculated temperatures up to two
03:17 - decimal pieces we don't want the numbers
03:19 - to get too long so we have a function
03:23 - called temp conversion and we have one
03:25 - variable called Celsius
03:28 - so first we're going to make a variable
03:30 - which is the formula for turning Celsius
03:32 - into Fahrenheit so it's called f equals
03:35 - round so the round function will limit
03:38 - will make your number whatever number
03:40 - into how many digits you want so this is
03:43 - formula and then we added two for the
03:46 - round function to limit it to two
03:49 - decimal places and then we're going to
03:51 - do the same frame of Kelvin the variable
03:54 - is called K and here's the formula and
03:57 - we're also going to eliminate to two
03:59 - decimal places then we're going to do if
04:03 - K is less than zero we're going to
04:05 - return invalid
04:07 - and then else if K is above zero then
04:12 - we're okay and we're going to return the
04:15 - fahrenheit and Kelvin in a list so we're
04:17 - going to do
04:18 - um square brackets and F and K so let's
04:22 - see the tests so here it'll give us the
04:24 - Celsius 0 148.2 and then we're going to
04:28 - return the fahrenheit and Kelvin so here
04:31 - that you can see they're all limited to
04:33 - the two
04:34 - um two decimal places and here it's
04:36 - invalid wow is it really that cold okay
04:40 - so all tests are passed on to the final
04:43 - problem find the perimeter of a
04:46 - rectangle so create a function that
04:48 - takes length and width which are both
04:51 - variables and finds the perimeter of
04:53 - rectangle so here examples it will give
04:57 - us six and seven and then when you
05:00 - calculate and it's going to be 20 the
05:02 - perimeter is 26. okay so when you return
05:05 - the result let's see the code so we have
05:07 - a variable called find parameter and two
05:10 - variables which is length and width so
05:14 - first we're going to do half so half of
05:16 - the rectangle we're going to do length
05:18 - plus width
05:20 - and then we're going to do perimeter
05:22 - which is another variable and use the
05:23 - half variable and Then star two so star
05:26 - in Python is
05:29 - um multiplication so to
05:32 - um calculate perimeter you need to do
05:34 - length times two or width times two I
05:36 - just do length plus which you can do
05:37 - either way and then uh multiply it by
05:41 - two and then we're going to return
05:43 - perimeter it's very simple and we're
05:46 - gonna see the test so here it goes two
05:49 - so twenty and ten so 20 plus 10 is 30 30
05:53 - times 2 is 60. so the answer the
05:56 - parameter will be 60. okay so all tests
05:58 - are passed
05:59 - okay so here is another two and nine two
06:03 - plus nine equals eleven and eleven plus
06:06 - eleven is 22. okay well that was fun and
06:11 - that's it for today thank you for
06:13 - watching Remember to smash the like

welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in edible edibit is a platform where there are lots and lots of coding problems and then you have to solve them with um

three and then here there's three four and one none of them are equal so return zero your function must return zero two or three let's see a code so we have a function called equal and we have three variables a b and c so first we're going to make a variable called num and it's going to start with as zero then if a is equal to B and B is equal to C so if they're all equal we're going to get the num and restate it to three because all the free numbers are equal yeah so we use two uh equal marked signs to actually mean equal not to State like number is zero okay then we're going to do else if a is b or a is C or B is C so if they're each other then L num equals two there are two numbers that are equal and then if none of these not if if an L if don't work we're going to go to else and we're just going to do num equals zero because none of them are equal yeah and then we're going to return the num variable so now let's check and see the test the test will go three random numbers here and then oh here there's the number that we need to return using the num variable and then here are what here are what the numbers are so like two three and four all values are different so when you turn zero that's the console so all this past test pass test our pass yay next one our next problem is called temperature conversion write a program that takes a temperature input in Celsius which is variable and converts it to Fahrenheit and Kelvin so verified and Kelvin are both um units of temperature return the converted temperature and values in a list the formulas that calculate the temperature in Fahrenheit from Celsius is this is the formula from Celsius to Fahrenheit and this is the formula for Celsius to Kelvin so here are examples so it'll just give us um the Celsius and then when you return the fahrenheit and the Kelvin so return invalid if K is less than zero so K is Kelvin and our term calculated temperatures up to two decimal pieces we don't want the numbers to

gonna see the test so here it goes two so twenty and ten so 20 plus 10 is 30 30 times 2 is 60. so the answer the parameter will be 60. okay so all tests are passed okay so here is another two and nine two plus nine equals eleven and eleven plus eleven is 22. okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash the like button subscribe bye bye
