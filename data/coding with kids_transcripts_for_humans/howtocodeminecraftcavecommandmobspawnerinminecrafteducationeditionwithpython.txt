00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - kalia my name is aaron today we're in
00:05 - minecraft education edition and we're
00:07 - going to
00:08 - create our own project
00:11 - so we're in
00:14 - a project well yeah called batcave so
00:17 - we're going to make a animal cave so
00:20 - first
00:21 - we need on chat command
00:24 - when you type cave
00:27 - in the chat
00:28 - because yeah you need a time set day so
00:34 - it will be morning
00:36 - which
00:37 - right now maybe it's morning i don't
00:40 - know
00:41 - then you need a repeat loop
00:46 - repeat 50 times
00:51 - fill with
00:59 - air
01:00 - from
01:01 - negative one
01:02 - zero negative one so we'll like make
01:07 - like a lot ear blocks around us that are
01:09 - invisible
01:11 - one two
01:13 - one
01:14 - so we're gonna like clear it clear the
01:17 - area out yeah dominion variable
01:20 - call back cave and then you sit back
01:23 - cave
01:29 - so this variable will be set to our
01:33 - position which is right here
01:38 - so then you have pause
01:42 - pause for
01:44 - 10 000 milliseconds
01:47 - which is like
01:48 - 10 seconds
01:50 - time set dusk so it'll be like more
01:55 - scary and that matches the theme of bats
01:58 - yeah because they're supposed to be in
02:00 - dark caves and then it repeat 200 times
02:05 - so it's like
02:06 - spotting a lot of
02:09 - um bats
02:11 - let's do 100 because we'll do more than
02:14 - one type of animal
02:16 - and then
02:17 - spa
02:18 - of course bats because it's called uh
02:22 - where's that here yeah but that
02:26 - and uh the variable back case so we'll
02:28 - spawn back to where we are
02:31 - [Music]
02:33 - and then we can like
02:35 - duplicate this and then just
02:37 - spawn another animal
02:43 - let's do
02:45 - uh how about
02:59 - so batcave which is variable position
03:02 - equals none so there's no value
03:04 - then def on a chat so it's a function
03:07 - global batcave so we can use the backing
03:09 - variable anyway in gameplay.time set
03:12 - gameplay.time day so we set it to
03:14 - daytime and for index in range 50 so
03:17 - repeat 50 times and do block spell air
03:20 - position negative one zero negative one
03:22 - and position
03:23 - one two and one you know
03:26 - so clear the area out
03:28 - and then you know the backing variable
03:30 - equals player position
03:32 - so we'll give that the back k variable
03:35 - or value which is our position then
03:37 - we're going to loop stop pause for 10
03:39 - seconds
03:40 - then gameplay dot times that gameplay
03:43 - that time dust and then change it to
03:44 - dusk and then for index 2 and range 100
03:48 - so we repeat 100 times modify that
03:51 - at backing position so it's where we're
03:54 - standing right here on the b of that
03:56 - composition and player that on chat k
03:58 - for the type
04:00 - [Music]
04:09 - and see our agent
04:10 - hi agent now i'm gonna do
04:15 - [Music]

04:36 - same position like now it's a storm
04:39 - it's a storm
04:47 - why don't we spawn other mobs that are
04:49 - ground mobs like
04:51 - okay
