00:00 - welcome to curtin with kids my name is
00:03 - kalia and my name is andrew today we're
00:05 - in mexico
00:06 - so today we want to learn about xy
00:08 - coordinates
00:09 - so first we need to drive forward so
00:12 - it's going to drive forward forever
00:15 - wait until okay
00:18 - don't wait until it's right there so
00:21 - wait until
00:23 - something is bigger
00:26 - that is bigger than zero so
00:30 - position when you first
00:33 - yeah position y
00:36 - is bigger than zero and millimeters
00:39 - is bigger than zero zero so
00:43 - now it's gonna drive forward until
00:46 - the y is more than zero so here
00:49 - the y is up and down so the middle is y
00:53 - we start from here so when we go
00:56 - here and we go straight up we go to
00:59 - more than zero then it's going to stop
01:02 - driving
01:03 - because it's going to turn right for 90
01:05 - degrees
01:06 - okay let's turn
01:10 - turn right for 90 degrees then drive
01:13 - forward
01:14 - so after it goes to
01:17 - y the y coordinate
01:21 - more than zero it'll turn right for 90
01:23 - degrees and drive forward
01:25 - and then it's going to drive forward
01:27 - then wait until
01:28 - wait until so after the y is
01:31 - more than zero it's going to turn right
01:33 - drive for and drive forward
01:35 - until wait until bigger the bigger one
01:39 - bigger than zero so the
01:42 - position in x in millimeters so the
01:45 - x-coordinate is more than zero
01:48 - then stop driving stop driving
01:52 - okay so now it's going to drive forward
01:55 - until
01:55 - the position in y is more than zero and
01:58 - then turn right for 90 degrees
02:00 - drive forward wait until position x
02:03 - more than zero and stop driving so we
02:06 - start here
02:07 - and it's gonna drive forward until
02:10 - it goes more than zero in y coordinate
02:13 - then it will turn right
02:14 - so his face this way in the x and then
02:17 - it will drive until
02:18 - it goes middle and then it'll stop so
02:20 - let's run it
02:23 - anyway
02:27 - okay let's do it in 2d mode first
02:30 - so it's gonna go forward
02:33 - until it goes to more than zero y
02:37 - so now it's moving forward and
02:41 - again now it's more than zero y
02:44 - is turn and down is zero zero so it's
02:48 - stopped
02:50 - let's go to 3d mode okay let's restart
02:54 - it first
02:54 - dance video because when you restart it
02:57 - it goes to t
02:58 - 2d mode let's run so now
03:02 - let's go forward until y is more than
03:05 - zero
03:06 - turn right and drive forward until x
03:09 - is more is more than zero so now
03:14 - yeah and thanks for watching remember to
03:17 - smash or like
03:18 - and subscribe bye

welcome to curtin with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're in mexico so today we want to learn about xy coordinates so first we need to drive forward so it's going to drive forward forever wait until okay don't wait until it's right there so wait until something is bigger that is bigger than zero so position when you first yeah position y is bigger than zero and millimeters is bigger than zero zero so now it's gonna drive forward until the y is more than zero so here the y is up and down so the middle is y we start from here so when we go here and we go straight up we go to more than zero then it's going to stop driving because it's going to turn right for 90 degrees okay let's turn turn right for 90 degrees then drive forward so after it goes to y the y coordinate more than zero it'll turn right for 90 degrees and drive forward and then it's going to drive forward then wait until wait until so after the y is more than zero it's going to turn right drive for and drive forward until wait until bigger the bigger one bigger than zero so the position in x in millimeters so the xcoordinate is more than zero then stop driving stop driving okay so now it's going to drive forward until the position in y is more than zero and then turn right for 90 degrees drive forward wait until position x more than zero and stop driving so we start here and it's gonna drive forward until it goes more than zero in y coordinate then it will turn right so his face this way in the x and then it will drive until it goes middle and then it'll stop so let's run it anyway okay let's do it in 2d mode first so it's gonna go forward until it goes to more than zero y so now it's moving forward and again now it's more than zero y is turn and down is zero zero so it's stopped let's go to 3d mode okay let's restart it first dance video because when you restart it it goes to t 2d mode let's run so now let's go forward until y is more than zero turn right and drive forward until x is more is more than zero so now yeah and thanks for watching remember to smash or like and subscribe bye
