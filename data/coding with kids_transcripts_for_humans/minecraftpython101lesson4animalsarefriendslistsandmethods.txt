00:00 - welcome to curtin with kids my name is
00:02 - kalia and my name's andrew
00:04 - today we're in minecraft education
00:05 - edition so we're in python 101
00:07 - lesson four so first we're going to talk
00:09 - to the ceo
00:11 - so the ceo says hi there it's good to
00:13 - see you again
00:14 - i'm afraid that we will be needing your
00:17 - help once more
00:18 - we're developing software for an animal
00:20 - hospital so that they can take
00:21 - better care of animals with this
00:23 - software the better
00:25 - enerians will also be able to work on a
00:29 - larger number of animals
00:30 - at once using complex sorting code that
00:32 - we are developing
00:33 - okay so we're going to help eco so first
00:36 - i'm going to talk to the developer
00:38 - so the developer says hi would it be
00:41 - possible to get your help
00:42 - i need to write some code that will make
00:44 - a list of these animals and spine them
00:45 - in the correct pans
00:47 - however animals keep ending up in the
00:49 - wrong patterns
00:50 - can you write some code i'll miss each
00:52 - of these animals and spawn them in the
00:53 - correct areas okay
00:55 - so let's see
00:59 - first write some code in a list named
01:02 - my list of the animals going from left
01:05 - to right in the minecraft world
01:07 - place four more spawn mob by position
01:09 - commands after one that's already given
01:11 - use the information from the science and
01:13 - depends to complete these commands
01:15 - so first we are gonna do
01:19 - a list called my list
01:24 - okay then see
01:27 - so first there's cow and pig
01:31 - okay it goes
01:36 - [Music]
01:38 - cow
01:40 - cow pink
01:44 - okay and this there is sheep and horse
01:56 - okay then lastly there is a rabbit
02:00 - rabbit bunny yeah
02:03 - it's going to rad
02:06 - okay so this is our list
02:10 - then we are gonna do
02:13 - let's see so first we're gonna go to pen
02:17 - we're just gonna go to location
02:21 - number two because it already has
02:23 - location
02:24 - one okay so
02:28 - what depending on we have okay so
02:31 - we're gonna copy this one
02:36 - then we're going to paste it so we're
02:40 - going to change the location 1
02:41 - to location 2 then we're going to have
02:45 - minus
02:46 - 2 so we're going to change to 0 to 2
02:49 - because states which
02:51 - place in the list we want so here we
02:53 - have two which is sheep
02:55 - because it's zero index so it starts
02:57 - with zero which is cow
02:59 - one in pig two sheep and so on okay
03:02 - next we are going to do flip for
03:05 - locations free
03:07 - so now i'm going to go to the kitchen
03:08 - tree so i need my list
03:10 - four so i'm gonna change the location
03:12 - one
03:14 - to location three and then change to
03:16 - zero
03:17 - to four now we're going to do it for
03:20 - location
03:21 - four we're gonna change the location one
03:24 - to location four
03:26 - and then goes to location four so we
03:28 - need my list one
03:29 - which is the pink yeah
03:33 - finally we're going to do it for
03:35 - location five
03:36 - we need my list free
03:39 - [Music]
03:42 - change to five and change this
03:45 - to the screen so now we're
03:48 - [Music]
03:52 - show it correct so now i'm going to go
03:54 - to activity two
03:57 - one talk to the veteran
04:00 - so she says could i ask for any help
04:03 - these dogs have specific dietary
04:05 - requirements about what they can and can
04:07 - eat
04:08 - however i'm having some problems with
04:10 - the machine as opposed to make their
04:12 - food
04:12 - you write some code to make the food
04:14 - machine work okay
04:16 - so first we go here
04:21 - so it says give the first of everything
04:22 - that's already in the poor
04:24 - defined list by changing the values of
04:26 - the first four places block our position
04:28 - commands
04:28 - so that they each place in order one of
04:31 - the items in the list
04:32 - then give the food from the chest to dog
04:34 - number one
04:38 - okay don't wanna do dog food zero
04:42 - dog food one dog food
04:45 - two dog food
04:50 - three and finally dog food four
04:54 - now all right okay let's do this machine
04:58 - okay so we don't need vitamins right now
05:01 - okay
05:01 - now we're gonna wait for the chest and
05:04 - now open chest
05:05 - so we're gonna drag these if there's
05:08 - food beef
05:12 - and chicken into our hot bar
05:15 - and then we're gonna go to the first dog
05:18 - and we're gonna drop these down
05:19 - [Music]
05:22 - okay so the dog is hungry so when you
05:25 - run this again to give it more food
05:28 - [Music]
05:29 - okay
05:33 - okay now i'm gonna remove it again
05:36 - biscuits
05:37 - beef and chicken okay
05:41 - so i'm going to repeat some more
05:45 - okay so i'm going to pull it up so dark
05:48 - one is
05:49 - but it's done so now we're gonna go to
05:52 - dog
05:52 - two okay so now we're gonna do nyx
05:56 - give the second dog everything that's
05:58 - already in the list with additional
06:00 - vitamins added
06:01 - do this by doing by using the append
06:03 - method to add the variable vitamins to
06:05 - the end of the list
06:06 - then change the value of the last place
06:08 - of block please block a position command
06:10 - so that it places the vitamins in the
06:12 - machine
06:13 - then give the top food to dog number two
06:16 - so now after this we're going to do
06:22 - dog food dot append
06:26 - so i'm going to append vitamins
06:30 - so here we add the vitamins bowl into
06:33 - dog
06:34 - food then you're going to
06:38 - do or
06:41 - paste it somewhere
06:46 - going to copy this and then
06:50 - do this so we're going to change this to
06:53 - 5
06:53 - which is vitamins so now
06:58 - so really the machine will give every
07:00 - single thing
07:02 - or dog too okay
07:05 - these biscuits so we added vitamins
07:07 - [Music]
07:10 - beef and chicken yeah okay
07:14 - so now let's go deep dog too
07:19 - and drop these

07:24 - it's still
07:25 - [Music]
07:28 - oh
07:31 - [Music]
07:36 - it's always in different like order yeah
07:39 - and chicken is always glass
07:41 - and beef too okay
07:45 - [Music]
07:47 - okay so now we are done feeding dog too
07:50 - and now we need to dump three dogs
07:53 - through
07:54 - okay so now
07:57 - we are going to do give the third dog
07:59 - everything that's already in the list
08:01 - but
08:02 - but with no beat do this by doing the
08:04 - pot method to remove their little beef
08:06 - from the list
08:06 - and give the dog to dog number three so
08:09 - we're gonna
08:11 - do here dog food
08:14 - dog food.com so i'm going to do the
08:17 - pocket
08:18 - pop function and prophecy one
08:21 - because there's no b so zero base is
08:23 - zero then
08:24 - one is beef so now we're running
08:28 - okay so now there's no b so the rest the
08:32 - block doesn't go to redstone because we
08:34 - don't need b so now there are only
08:37 - vitamins
08:40 - biscuits and chicken yeah
08:43 - so there's nobody um
08:47 - i think no they all need chicken bone
08:50 - and biscuits okay
08:52 - [Music]
08:55 - okay so now i'm gonna feed it one more
08:57 - time
08:59 - right here
09:01 - [Music]
09:17 - [Music]
09:21 - okay now we're done feeding the donkeys
09:24 - now we're going to go to
09:25 - last activity to take the test so we're
09:28 - going to talk to the data scientist
09:31 - so the data scientist says sorry to
09:33 - bother you could i get your help
09:35 - i'm trying to make three pieces of code
09:36 - that will sort these cats means
09:38 - this will make it easier for vegetarians
09:41 - to keep track of which cat is which
09:43 - however the names again in the chat
09:44 - doesn't don't seem to be the correct
09:46 - ones
09:46 - can you help me by writing code for
09:48 - these for three different cases
09:51 - so first let me go to number one change
09:54 - the last name
09:55 - last cat name snowy to shadow which cat
09:58 - what cat is now in this position five
10:02 - okay
10:04 - so it says set the last name in the list
10:07 - to cast
10:08 - now to to now equal the string shadow
10:11 - change the value inside the say command
10:13 - so it's so that it displays the last
10:15 - name in the list
10:16 - then press the select a cap on and
10:18 - choose a cat shown in the chat so
10:21 - [Music]
10:27 - cat names patterns
10:34 - this one then we're going to see zero
10:36 - one
10:37 - two three four five i'm gonna do five
10:41 - equals we're gonna do shadow
10:44 - then we'll
10:55 - let's see in the chat so it's just chat
10:56 - so i'm gonna press this button
10:58 - which they select cat and then we can
11:01 - put the button on what which cat we need
11:04 - select which is shaft
11:05 - so this is shadow and last name and
11:08 - press the button
11:09 - so now it's correct and shadow appear
11:11 - golden blocks
11:12 - like
11:16 - now we're gonna go to number two show
11:18 - the list of the cast name automatically
11:21 - which what cat is now put let's position
11:23 - three
11:24 - so first let me change the five to a
11:26 - three and then
11:29 - one two three so it says sort the list
11:31 - of cat names alphabetically
11:33 - using the sort method then change the
11:35 - value into the
11:36 - same command so it displays the fourth
11:38 - name in the list then press
11:40 - the select cap cap button and choose the
11:42 - caption and chat
11:44 - so i'm going to do cat names
11:47 - it's cat noise
11:50 - dot sort and do the sort function
11:54 - to sort of alphabetically now we're
11:56 - going to do
11:57 - three okay now let's see
12:01 - so now we're going to do this again
12:03 - let's see which one
12:04 - is salmon smokey or you know
12:08 - sammy correct
12:11 - so now she's here and shadow's gone okay
12:14 - now i'm gonna go to the last one
12:15 - now reverse the order of cat names what
12:19 - cat is now in this position three
12:22 - okay so i want to keep this the same and
12:25 - okay reverse the list of cat names using
12:28 - the rest method
12:29 - keep the same value inside the c command
12:31 - then press the select a cap button and
12:33 - choose to catch one in the chat
12:34 - so i'm going to go here and do cat names
12:38 - and do another cat names
12:41 - dot raise verbs
12:44 - so this is the reverse function which
12:46 - will reverse the order of
12:49 - the value of the values inside the list
12:52 - so now we're on one see you soon
12:55 - [Music]
12:57 - princess select the traffic games which
13:00 - means princess
13:02 - smokey oreo sammy
13:10 - rockets everywhere because we finished
13:13 - it now we're going to the elevator
13:15 - and we can press this so now we're at
13:18 - the beginning again
13:20 - well that was fun and that's it for
13:23 - today
13:24 - thank you for watching remember to smash
13:26 - the like button and subscribe
13:28 - bye bye

okay next we are going to do flip for locations free so now i'm going to go to the kitchen tree so i need my list four so i'm gonna change the location one to location three and then change to zero to four now we're going to do it for location four we're gonna change the location one to location four and then goes to location four so we need my list one which is the pink yeah finally we're going to do it for location five we need my list free change to five and change this to the screen so now we're show it correct so now i'm going to go to activity two one talk to the veteran so she says could

the list then change the value of the last place of block please block a position command so that it places the vitamins in the machine then give the top food to dog number two so now after this we're going to do dog food dot append so i'm going to append vitamins so here we add the vitamins bowl into dog food then you're going to do or paste it somewhere going to copy this and then do this so we're going to change this to 5 which is vitamins so now so really the machine will give every single thing or dog too okay these biscuits so we added vitamins beef and chicken yeah okay so now let's go deep dog too and drop these now we're going to do it again because it's still oh it's always in different like order yeah and chicken is always glass and beef too okay okay so now we are done

to remove their little beef from the list and give the dog to dog number three so we're gonna do here dog food dog food.com so i'm going to do the pocket pop function and prophecy one because there's no b so zero base is zero then one is beef so now we're running okay so now there's no b so the rest the block doesn't go to redstone because we don't need b so now there are only vitamins biscuits and chicken yeah so there's nobody um i think no they all need chicken bone and biscuits okay okay so now i'm gonna feed it one more time right here okay now we're done feeding the donkeys now we're going to go to last activity to take the test so we're going to talk to the data scientist so the data scientist says sorry to bother you could i get your help i'm trying to make three pieces of code
