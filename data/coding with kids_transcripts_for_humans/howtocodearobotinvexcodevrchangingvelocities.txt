00:00 - welcome to totally live kids my name is
00:04 - today we're in fact so this video is
00:07 - going to be
00:09 - going to be about changing the speed
00:12 - discretion this is a sample change the
00:15 - driving and
00:16 - turning speed of the
00:19 - robot program grid map okay let's first
00:24 - okay set drive speed
00:28 - to 100 its usual speed is
00:32 - 50. then drive forward
00:36 - for 100 millimeters
01:09 - it'll keep driving forward for um 100
01:13 - speed then
01:16 - set turn speed to 25
01:22 - oopsies drive speeds to 25
01:28 - 25 then turn left for 90 degrees
01:31 - then turn left
01:36 - for 90 degrees
01:39 - so drawing velocity to 30 percent
01:42 - dirty press now if you drive forward
01:45 - it'll be slower yeah then drive
01:49 - first so it'll drive backwards
01:52 - 400 millimeters
01:58 - okay now let's start
02:01 - this is the green map
02:06 - great map we choose gradient map because
02:10 - i just swap red map okay
02:13 - yeah okay turn
02:18 - move forward left
02:22 - then it's going down
02:25 - and it's finished let's do it in
02:29 - 3d okay
02:39 - okay it's going going
02:42 - going forward turn left reverse
02:46 - and let's close it and thanks
02:50 - for watching remember to subscribe
02:54 - bye bye bye
