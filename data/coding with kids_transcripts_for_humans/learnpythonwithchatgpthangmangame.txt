00:01 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:04 - Kalia and my name is Andrew today we're
00:05 - going to use chat GPT to create a simple
00:08 - game in Python So today we're going to
00:10 - show you how to create a Hangman game in
00:12 - Python using track gbt so first I asked
00:15 - us to give me some simple games it says
00:18 - certainly here are a few examples of
00:20 - simple games you can play Tic-Tac-Toe we
00:22 - already did did that in Python Hang Man
00:25 - which we're gonna do today 20 Questions
00:27 - Pictionary charades which we can't do in
00:29 - python or maybe we can but we need lots
00:32 - of people to play it and Simon Says and
00:35 - I spot so these are just a few examples
00:38 - of simple games you can enjoy you can
00:40 - modify the rules or add variations to
00:42 - suit your preferences have fun play so
00:44 - Nana said to Chachi make a simple
00:47 - Hangman game with Clues and two players
00:50 - with python and explain it to me like
00:52 - I'm a python beginner it says sure I can
00:55 - help you create a simple hangman gamer
00:57 - python he's a step-by-step explanation
00:59 - of how to do it so step one to set up
01:02 - the game first you need to import the
01:03 - random module to generate a random word
01:06 - for the game here input
01:08 - then you can start by defining a list of
01:10 - words that will be used as the word bank
01:12 - for the game so then there's a list
01:13 - which we can put in the words that we
01:17 - can guess
01:18 - here for example as an example it's
01:21 - apple banana character and eggplant and
01:23 - fig so you can change those words to
01:26 - whatever you want select step two or
01:29 - select a random word next you need to
01:31 - choose a random word from the word Bank
01:33 - you can use the rand.choice function to
01:35 - do this so here we have variable storing
01:38 - the one of these words from the list as
01:41 - the word you you are supposed to guess
01:43 - then step three we're gonna initialize
01:46 - the variables you need some variables to
01:48 - keep track of the game's profits
01:50 - initialize variables like guesses math
01:52 - guess Max guesses Clues and guess
01:55 - letters so there's guesses which is zero
01:58 - it will increase over time the maximum
02:01 - guesses here it's six you can also
02:03 - modify that and then we have a variable
02:05 - called clue equals and there's this
02:08 - times the length of the word to create
02:11 - to tell you um how many letters the word
02:14 - has and then there's a list that will
02:16 - contain your guest letters step four is
02:19 - create a loop for gameplay so first I'm
02:21 - going to do a while loop while guesses
02:23 - is less than Max's maximum guesses and
02:26 - clue is not word we're going to display
02:28 - the current clue in guest letters so I'm
02:31 - going to print clue and we're going to
02:33 - give the amount of letters in the word
02:35 - and then we're going to print guest
02:36 - letters here which is also a list and
02:40 - then we're going to prompt the player
02:41 - for a guess so we're going to create a
02:43 - variable with our answer equals input
02:45 - guess letter and then we'll change the
02:47 - letter to lower
02:49 - and then we're it's going to store our
02:51 - answer here and then we're going to
02:53 - check if the guess is valid if it's in
02:55 - the word so if length of guess is not
02:57 - one or it's not guest dot is Alpha so
03:00 - it's Alpha checks if the input or
03:04 - whatever it's checking is only one
03:05 - letter so if length if the length is not
03:10 - uh one letter it's going to print
03:12 - invalid guess please enter a single
03:15 - letter and we're going to continue then
03:17 - we're going to check if the letter has
03:18 - already been guessed if guess in guest
03:21 - letters then it will print you already
03:23 - guessed that letter and then you can
03:24 - guess again
03:25 - next we're going to add the guess to the
03:28 - list of guest letters if we pass both
03:30 - these if Loops we're going to do guess
03:32 - dot letters guess letters the append
03:35 - guess we're gonna add it to the list and
03:38 - then we're gonna check the guess is in
03:40 - the word so if guess is in the word
03:42 - we're gonna do we're gonna update our
03:45 - clue or our word that is Mystery
03:49 - unknown and then we're going to print
03:51 - correct guess because it's in the word
03:53 - if it's not in the word we're going to
03:55 - add one to the guesses variable I'm
03:58 - going to print incorrect guess then
04:00 - we're going to print
04:01 - then step five in the game so if guesses
04:05 - equals equals Max guesses remember it's
04:07 - about two so you're not a science so if
04:10 - you're you reach the max gases it'll
04:12 - print you lost the word was and then
04:14 - I'll show you the word if you didn't
04:16 - then it'll print congratulations you've
04:18 - guessed the word and it'll also show the
04:20 - word even if you did it against it
04:23 - that's it you now have a basic Hangman
04:25 - game feel free to add more features or
04:27 - customize it further as you become more
04:29 - comfortable with python remember to
04:31 - indent the code properly to maintain the
04:33 - structure and functionality happy code
04:36 - so now we're in Visual Studio codes and
04:38 - we put all the code here and we change
04:41 - the word bank to games YouTube coding
04:43 - Andrew Kalia and Python and we're going
04:46 - to change the max guesses to 10 so we
04:48 - have space for wrong letters
04:50 - okay so now we're gonna do
04:53 - you want to go first sure okay okay I'm
04:56 - gonna put an a because it's very
04:58 - very there is six letters there's no a
05:01 - this six letters
05:04 - um
05:05 - let's see there's no a so let's try the
05:07 - bar there is a y that's the second
05:10 - letter
05:11 - let me think of the huh
05:16 - it's python yeah
05:21 - okay you guessed the word python okay my
05:24 - turn
05:25 - let's see there is also six letters
05:28 - let's choose a there's a it's probably
05:31 - my name this is my name
05:34 - okay
05:35 - one more time for us each okay I'm good
05:39 - it's six again right I think so yeah it
05:43 - sucks there's no kick
05:45 - uh
05:48 - there's a g at the end okay it hasn't
05:50 - what could it be
05:52 - uh
05:56 - let me try
05:58 - it there is no e
06:01 - there is no a either you have four
06:03 - guesses
06:07 - what ends with a G
06:11 - I have no idea I'm just gonna guess
06:13 - random letters now
06:14 - there's an o in the second letter
06:17 - oh
06:20 - it's coding oh I'm running out of
06:23 - guesses
06:27 - you made it okay my turn last one see
06:32 - seven letters
06:33 - there's only one thing that has seven
06:35 - letters there's no way
06:39 - let's see there's no C either
06:45 - there is a it's probably YouTube yeah
06:47 - it's the only one in our bank that had
06:50 - seven letters so
06:53 - okay congratulations you guessed the
06:56 - word YouTube well that was fun and
06:59 - that's it for today thank you for
07:01 - watching Remember to smash that button
07:04 - and subscribe bye bye

and we're going to give the amount of letters in the word and then we're going to print guest letters here which is also a list and then we're going to prompt the player for a guess so we're going to create a variable with our answer equals input guess letter and then we'll change the letter to lower and then we're it's going to store our answer here and then we're going to check if the guess is valid if it's in the word so if length of guess is not one or it's not guest dot is Alpha so it's Alpha checks if the input or whatever it's checking is only one letter so if length if the length is not uh one letter it's going to print invalid guess please enter a single letter and we're going to continue then we're going to check if the letter has already been guessed if guess in guest letters then it will print you already guessed that letter and then you can guess again next we're going to add the guess to the list of guest letters if we pass both these if Loops we're going to do guess

also six letters let's choose a there's a it's probably my name this is my name okay one more time for us each okay I'm good it's six again right I think so yeah it sucks there's no kick uh there's a g at the end okay it hasn't what could it be uh let me try it there is no e there is no a either you have four guesses what ends with a G I have no idea I'm just gonna guess random letters now there's
