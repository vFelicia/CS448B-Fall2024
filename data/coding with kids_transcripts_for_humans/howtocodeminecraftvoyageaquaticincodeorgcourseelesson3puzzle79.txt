01:05 - want to go on the other lane you need a
01:08 - if path to the left turn left two yeah
01:12 - so we have if pass to the right that
01:14 - means if the path goes to the right
01:16 - turn right and then keep moving forward
01:19 - and then we'll go to the chest
01:21 - let's run it now it's running forward

03:19 - standing on
03:20 - blue coral then turn right
