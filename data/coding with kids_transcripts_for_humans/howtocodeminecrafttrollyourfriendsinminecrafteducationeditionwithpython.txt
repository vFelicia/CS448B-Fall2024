00:01 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:04 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in a
00:06 - Minecraft education Edition so today I'm
00:08 - going to be showing you how to code four
00:11 - simple trolls so you can make fun of
00:14 - your friends and troll them and surprise
00:16 - them in survival so if you don't know
00:19 - what troll means troll is like just like
00:21 - tricking down
00:22 - and like uh like spawning balls out of
00:26 - nowhere and like making them scared and
00:28 - surprised so our first troll is on
00:31 - player sneak teleport the nearest player
00:34 - to your coordinates so where you are and
00:36 - then it'll spawn on Cooper at your
00:39 - position
00:40 - so here so the this these trolls aren't
00:43 - 100 efficient but they're still pretty
00:46 - good so like for example when players
00:49 - sneak so when your friend's trying to
00:51 - kill you or um to eliminate you to
00:55 - surprise you or something and they're
00:57 - sneaking so you can't see their name
00:58 - tags you control them by doing by
01:01 - teleporting them to you
01:03 - then you can eliminate them yourself
01:05 - with the surprise or you can spawn a
01:07 - creeper at your coordinate and then
01:10 - after they've teleported you and so and
01:12 - the creep responds you can quickly run
01:14 - away
01:15 - okay so then the next rule is to keep
01:19 - your friend focused on on eliminating
01:23 - zombies hopefully it's still night so on
01:26 - when uh any player
01:29 - or like when you kill a monster they'll
01:32 - teleport the nearest player to your
01:35 - coordinates will spawn a monster
01:39 - sponge and it'll Spawn Two More Zombies
01:41 - also at your record is so you can also
01:44 - need to run quickly away
01:46 - okay and then
01:48 - this will keep the focus because for
01:50 - every zombie you eliminate two more
01:52 - zombies will spawn so it's just like
01:54 - doubling it yeah yeah and then here when
01:57 - your friend finds a diamond and they
01:58 - mine it it will teleport them to your
02:01 - coordinates and they probably would have
02:04 - already collected the diamond
02:06 - hopefully
02:08 - um
02:09 - then after it teleports you
02:12 - uh the code is going to repeat 10 times
02:14 - then Place cobwebs and pick random
02:17 - position from your coordinates to
02:20 - the x is five and then the Y is Tenon
02:23 - lives I mean the Z is ten and the zero
02:26 - is wide so these are quarters so the
02:29 - code was just Spam cobwebs but Tim
02:32 - blocks which will slow you and your
02:35 - friend but maybe you have a sword so
02:37 - you're prepared at all times when you
02:40 - can break the cobbles
02:42 - what are the cobwebs for will they slow
02:45 - you down so we're going to spawn them
02:47 - projectile Prime TNT at your recording
02:50 - so you must run away I'll say very
02:53 - quickly all of these are not that
02:55 - efficient because you will be trapped in
02:57 - it too but maybe if you do it you'll
02:59 - have like something prepared to get out
03:01 - yeah so the prime TNT will be more
03:04 - quicker to explode and will explode your
03:07 - friends up hopefully not you
03:09 - and the next one is earlier in your
03:12 - survival so when uh somebody places
03:15 - obsidian and will set the position which
03:18 - is a variable to pick random position
03:21 - from these coordinates
03:23 - which can go from way above ground 50
03:25 - blocks above ground maybe to 100 blocks
03:30 - underground or maybe more so when
03:32 - they're trying to build an obsidian well
03:34 - another portal and trying to get another
03:36 - secret Blaze Rod it will it will set the
03:40 - position variable to random position
03:42 - somewhere in the world now teleport the
03:45 - nearest player to that position I knew
03:48 - my suffocate and then it'll spot if it
03:51 - doesn't suffocate or they'll both ground
03:53 - it will spot a creeper at their position
03:56 - and these are the four trolls so now
03:58 - let's see it in Python
04:01 - okay so first we have the uh blank
04:04 - position variable to get a Teleport your
04:07 - friend to a random place and then here
04:10 - the first role is when you get the uh
04:13 - try to place the obsidian it will make
04:16 - the position variable Global so you can
04:19 - use it inside the function and outside
04:20 - the function then we'll set the position
04:23 - to a random position in these
04:25 - coordinates teleport on the nearest
04:28 - player to that position and also the
04:30 - creeper to that position and then this
04:32 - happens when somebody places a city
04:35 - then this is when somebody breaks a
04:38 - diamond board
04:39 - so it will teleport the the nearest
04:42 - player to your opposite coordinates and
04:45 - it will uh spam cobwebs 10 cobwebs in
04:48 - random positions around you and then
04:51 - it'll spawn the prime TNT at your
04:53 - position so hopefully you're close to
04:55 - your front and ready to run away
04:57 - so this also happens when you break the
04:59 - diamond ore then this is when your
05:01 - friend sneaks and trying to
05:05 - Shield or just sneak up to you it will
05:09 - teleport them to you
05:11 - and then it will spawn a creeper so
05:13 - it'll blow them up even if their Shield
05:16 - might protect them they'll still take
05:17 - damage and if the creeper doesn't finish
05:19 - them off you can then this all happens
05:21 - when a player sneaks and finally when
05:24 - the zombie kills when a zombie is
05:26 - eliminated it will teleport the nearest
05:29 - player to you spawn two more zombies and
05:32 - then this happens when a zombie dies
05:34 - so now let's try it so first Let's
05:37 - Pretend We're in a mine and then wow
05:40 - there are diamonds
05:43 - so we didn't get diamonds yet so we get
05:46 - a gold we have a gold pickaxe even if
05:48 - gold isn't that good and we try to mine
05:50 - the diamonds bam so now this column this
05:54 - is TNT so
05:56 - and this time we even blew up the
05:59 - diamonds so we got diamonds yeah
06:02 - but sometimes if you look if you're well
06:07 - if you're lucky
06:11 - you're lucky um
06:13 - uh the the cardboard will trap your
06:15 - friend for example your friend is over
06:17 - here
06:22 - you're sneaking
06:26 - well at least I swear
06:32 - that was an example of the sneaking
06:42 - and then you'll get boom everything
06:45 - explodes
06:46 - Okay so
06:48 - that's mine so we also mind the diamonds
06:52 - right yeah okay so let's just get the
06:55 - weather back to normal
07:01 - okay so now we're trying to build the
07:07 - portal okay for this present pretend
07:10 - there's a room portal or the portal you
07:12 - start building portal place the block of
07:14 - Stadium what happens next
07:16 - I've been selling for it to a random
07:18 - place oh now I'm suffocating
07:21 - and now I got eliminated because we
07:24 - suffocated
07:26 - so then you you can't really build
07:29 - another photo
07:30 - it's so sad final one is where there are
07:34 - lots of zombies and you try to eliminate
07:35 - them so
07:37 - tonight
07:39 - or just go to a shade
07:41 - so let's go to trees so I have an iron
07:43 - sword prepared to fight them as well as
07:45 - a shield
07:57 - that's how it's very effective
07:59 - the more you sneak to protect yourself
08:01 - from creepers of The Shield the more
08:04 - creepers will spawn it's very very you
08:06 - can't hold her yeah this your shoes will
08:09 - eventually break okay and Alice
08:12 - I'm just an interesting because zombies
08:14 - will also naturally spawn okay
08:17 - I always did okay
08:23 - so we're gonna do always day
08:25 - to go off
08:27 - so we're gonna go tonight
08:30 - time is not no response
08:44 - out of nowhere
08:48 - Horizons
09:05 - so I'm just spamming the Iron Golems can
09:09 - we get teleported to somewhere else
09:10 - again
09:12 - play subsidian you want to play Super
09:14 - City
09:16 - [Music]
09:18 - bye bye zombie oh suffocate again
09:22 - pickaxe yay
09:26 - just in a random place I think we're in
09:29 - a cave
09:32 - so we're gonna eliminate ourselves so we
09:35 - can respawn
09:37 - okay
09:40 - these all these cheese uh trolls are
09:43 - very effective and you can use them but
09:46 - now here
09:49 - so for the zombie troll when uh
09:54 - it might not be as effective
09:57 - it keeps them forgetting because
09:59 - um the zombie because if the zombies die
10:02 - from like fire from because it's day or
10:05 - like fire from your flame arrows
10:07 - creepers skeletons or iron golems it
10:10 - won't spawn I mean it won't spawn soon
10:13 - more only if you kill it with your iron
10:16 - pickaxe
10:18 - but not like setting on a fire it
10:20 - doesn't work
10:21 - trapped them in the cobbler
10:25 - and then let's see the other hacks
10:28 - um when this traveled sneeze you might
10:30 - also get exploded or they might just use
10:32 - it uh you uh
10:38 - shoes
10:41 - and then um for the broken diamond ore
10:45 - we'll really be sure not to press run
10:47 - when you are a place or doing any of
10:50 - these actions or you will regret it and
10:54 - then um
11:03 - back to the house
11:05 - the house before the video ends
11:09 - okay
11:11 - well that was fun and that's it for
11:14 - today thank you for watching Remember to
