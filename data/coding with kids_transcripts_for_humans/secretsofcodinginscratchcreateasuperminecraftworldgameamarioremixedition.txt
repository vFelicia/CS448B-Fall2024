06:09 - yeah okay your turn
06:14 - go down the pipe i will
06:17 - go down go down yeah

06:30 - i can show them how it's cool in the
06:32 - pike
06:35 - down the pipe i recommend you go to the

07:24 - second life you passed it
07:27 - there's always a pipe to get back up
07:30 - yes i passed see go back

07:40 - it's gonna be hard i jump here i
07:43 - literally just keep
07:44 - jumping and those are platforms
07:47 - it's creepy
07:52 - it's easy you only have one life
07:55 - oh you got off the platform too
07:59 - okay you sure
08:03 - this is hard to go to the level too
08:06 - so the background you also need to
08:08 - change it in the backdrop it's not also
08:11 - a sprite but
08:12 - it's also a backdrop because it is the
08:15 - background
