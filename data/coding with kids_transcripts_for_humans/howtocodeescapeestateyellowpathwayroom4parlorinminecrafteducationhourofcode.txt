00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in
00:06 - Minecraft education Edition and in the
00:08 - hour of code Escape Austin so in the
00:11 - last video we completed this room and
00:12 - now we're gonna enter
00:14 - I'm loading it's coming
00:18 - portal boom so now first we see the
00:21 - lamps it's a library oh it's the chest
00:24 - room are we back to it yeah so every
00:28 - every like every stage will all have the
00:30 - chest room so every stage yeah so like
00:33 - there's three different paths yeah so
00:36 - right click the particle
00:38 - to know we're gonna play chess again
00:43 - I'm just mixing the puzzles press C to
00:45 - go so there's a puzzle switch for
00:48 - containing the uh chess the king chess
00:51 - piece picture slot it looks like these
00:53 - pieces are part of an incomplete picture
00:55 - try reordering them to see what's this
00:58 - supposed to be used to push pieces
01:00 - function to trigger the Pistons to move
01:02 - the pieces that in that direction
01:05 - you can do up down left and right okay
01:07 - so this is a code example
01:12 - to the left right
01:14 - okay so we'll see what we have to do so
01:17 - we have to do right and then up and then
01:20 - left okay so let's go to coding again
01:24 - um Left Right and let's run this
01:28 - left right okay that does not work so we
01:31 - have to do left and up and then right
01:35 - so let's go here and then
01:39 - delete
01:42 - it's left and then up and then right
01:50 - okay so let's see if this works left up
01:53 - right oh that's easy so now we got the
01:56 - king chest no broke and now it's the
01:59 - actual Cube chest okay let's go go
02:01 - where's the king Justice
02:03 - Bishop so now the bishop disappeared on
02:06 - the king up here but it's Rook the
02:09 - rook's checking the king okay so that's
02:11 - kind of an illegal move okay let's go
02:17 - right click the button
02:20 - booms now we have there's a bunch of
02:23 - libraries bookshelves and we have to the
02:26 - cursor I think it needs to reach the
02:28 - queen which is up all the way up there
02:30 - as I get the queen up there using Code
02:33 - um getting gold blocks and towering all
02:36 - the way up to the queen
02:39 - okay so let's go code
02:42 - so it says there seems to be something
02:46 - at the top of the bookcase see if you
02:48 - can create a way to get up there use
02:50 - move cursor to position the cursor and
02:52 - place back to place a block and you
02:53 - select position so you can
02:56 - um using the move cursor function we can
02:59 - um
03:00 - do orange magenta blue and yellow which
03:03 - orange moves up magenta moves down blue
03:06 - moves left and yellow moves right
03:09 - so let's see the code example
03:13 - okay so it's placing gold blocks
03:16 - so we have to walk on a gold box to get
03:19 - the queen up there so let's go code
03:22 - okay
03:23 - so this one works so let's you can also
03:26 - use repeats to make the code shorter
03:29 - okay so
03:31 - um we're gonna first create a loop
03:34 - for
03:36 - I in range
03:41 - um three times
03:44 - and we're gonna make another repeat Loop
03:52 - two times
03:55 - we got to
03:58 - um move I mean Place bar Place block
04:01 - first
04:06 - and then let's see
04:09 - so we're gonna place a block
04:13 - over here and then we have to move
04:15 - yellow and then Place Another block
04:20 - so we're gonna move cursor yellow
04:29 - and then we're just gonna Place Another
04:30 - block and then in the first repeat loop
04:34 - we're gonna put move cursor but not
04:37 - place a block
04:43 - and move up which is orange
04:50 - cursor
04:53 - Orange
04:54 - and then we're just gonna go
04:57 - everyone
05:07 - so we shouldn't have repeated three
05:09 - times but now we reach the queen with a
05:12 - jumping
05:13 - Rock
05:20 - it's another king and queen on the board
05:23 - investigate particles on the carpet so
05:26 - in the next video we're just we're gonna
05:28 - finish this and see where it leads us
05:30 - because that door looks big
05:33 - okay
05:34 - well that was fun and that's it for
05:37 - today thank you for watching Remember to
