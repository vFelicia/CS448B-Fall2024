00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in
00:05 - timecraft So today we're gonna do this
00:08 - last one looking like a sign like a tube
00:14 - signed Tube without anything in it so
00:16 - let's go let's click go to tampon hi
00:19 - time agent
00:21 - press button
00:24 - press and this time split it seems our
00:27 - knowledge of chemistry is disappearing
00:30 - let's head off to the 1890s Paris and
00:34 - visit the lab with this famous chemist
00:36 - known for a great scientific discoveries
00:38 - perhaps the mystery of our missing
00:40 - chemistry can be solved here as well
00:42 - okay let's go press button
00:46 - see two one Boop
00:50 - laboratory Paris France 19 1890s
00:55 - chemist where did those samples go I
00:58 - can't find them anywhere I guess it's
01:00 - back to the drawing board
01:02 - oh she's turning she's going away here
01:04 - she go it appears that copper has hidden
01:07 - all the chairs samples she used to
01:09 - discover important elements start your
01:11 - mission by using Talk device to teleport
01:13 - the time agents to a starting location
01:15 - so let's see
01:19 - I'm gonna eat one slice sorry Thomas
01:22 - okay oh
01:24 - oh
01:25 - no yummy cake yummy cake no yeah yeah

01:35 - okay okay let's go use our top this is
01:38 - weird look there's a there's a there's a
01:42 - green green thing okay this
01:45 - is
01:47 - start activity
01:49 - oh it's on the Shelf
01:52 - look the elements are radiating let's
01:55 - use code to uncover the hidden elements
01:57 - for the chemist so I think the elements
01:59 - are right here yeah it's like sparkling
02:02 - and stuff see
02:04 - code start tutorial and the chemist left
02:09 - the room someone hid her research inside
02:11 - the bookcase could you age to destroy
02:14 - the green glowing book okay so now she
02:16 - can share her Discovery so first we have
02:18 - to move up because
02:21 - um it's like one block higher than my
02:23 - agent first near reached the bookshelf
02:25 - before you can destroy it yeah so let's
02:28 - go back to coding move up by one
02:32 - and then AJ moved forward because he
02:35 - can't move to the trap doors yeah
02:37 - forward by by let's see how many
02:41 - see so we're here one two three four
02:45 - four times
02:47 - four and then destroy to destroy the
02:52 - black Shelf okay let's see go go go go
02:54 - go you can destroy it
02:57 - it turned but I'll turn then oh so agent
03:03 - destroyed forward no no no no no oh we
03:05 - only needed a straw
03:09 - destroy it I mean just disappeared oh oh
03:13 - she came back the chairman suddenly came
03:16 - back what do we have here it's my
03:18 - missing samples now I can complete my
03:20 - research
03:21 - she's holding them right no no
03:25 - amazing work you've prepared this moment
03:27 - in time now the chance will go on to win
03:29 - two Nobel prizes for our work and change
03:32 - the world for the better
03:35 - [Music]
03:44 - this is mostly
03:47 - um
03:48 - oh I don't I think we can't ship wow
03:54 - oh the door's here
03:57 - you found the secret room take note of
03:59 - which time you should see here and
04:00 - headed back to the Institute
04:03 - Banshee I think it's Yeti because last
04:06 - time I'm gonna create some misery I'm
04:09 - gonna do Banshee no action okay
04:14 - look at me
04:17 - she looked at us teleport it's yes daddy
04:21 - okay
04:23 - let's go back to the time split oh look
04:26 - it's full screen and the background is
04:29 - red like let's jump over to here oh it's
04:33 - a pet it's a pet collar for the and this
04:36 - is the one we did today it's weird it's
04:39 - just a green blob there's more things
04:43 - here this is the Apollo 11. okay this is
04:48 - the
04:50 - oh yeah the mom and Lisa okay this is a
04:53 - castle the Wall of China okay this is
04:56 - the this is the Apollo what is that
05:01 - I don't know this is a pyramid pyramid
05:04 - and this is the trumpet it's the first
05:06 - one we ever did yeah let's go back up up
05:09 - up
05:11 - so let's see that one I oh I think that
05:15 - the the one is maybe what was it this
05:19 - one the one that the one that was very
05:21 - weird I don't know it looks so weird
05:24 - because the balloon it looks just so
05:26 - weird
05:27 - okay look it's a little Among Us
05:31 - well that was fun and that's it for
05:34 - today thank you for watching remembering
05:36 - to smash like And subscribe bye bye
