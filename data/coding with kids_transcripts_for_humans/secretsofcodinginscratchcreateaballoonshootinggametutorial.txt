01:32 - is actually from
01:35 - i mean there's what's it called yeah
01:37 - robots this
01:39 - robot i got the code and like
01:43 - with this that's how you like do the

02:42 - maybe just a little something
02:50 - okay this whole thing's softer
02:54 - yeah okay the code
02:57 - i over here added forever
03:02 - switch backdrop to next backdrop wait
03:04 - one second
03:05 - so switch back drop to nick's backdrop
03:07 - is much easier than like this
03:10 - switch back drop to w then wait one
03:12 - second
03:13 - and keep doing it until you do all the
03:15 - backdrops you can just switch it to the
03:17 - book you can use the block

03:41 - old kind of version also 2.0

03:51 - and ball two is the same as ball one
03:56 - because they're both balls yeah and
03:58 - balloon

04:05 - both need to get the balloon on the ball
04:07 - yeah but don't forget
04:12 - so over here it's pick one to ten
04:15 - seconds to create clone of myself
04:18 - over here it's one two three
04:21 - so the robot can take longer to spawn
04:24 - yeah the
04:25 - uploaded robot yeah but
04:28 - this one from the usual thing
04:32 - will not because it's one two three
04:34 - while this is one to
04:35 - ten then pick random
04:39 - negative ten to negative 90. it's
04:42 - important
04:43 - yeah this one too maybe i want to change
04:46 - it
