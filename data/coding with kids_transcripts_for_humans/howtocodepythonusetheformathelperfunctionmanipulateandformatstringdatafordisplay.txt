00:00 - welcome to quitting with kids
00:03 - my name is kalia and my name is andrew
00:05 - today we're going to teach you python
00:07 - so today we're going to learn a string
00:09 - helper function the format helper
00:11 - function
00:12 - so first i'm going to create a new file
00:14 - i'm going to name it format dot py
00:18 - okay then i'm going to do train
00:21 - equals milk and
00:24 - cups equal five
00:27 - then duration equals 4.5
00:31 - so the first the drink the milk is a
00:34 - string
00:34 - and then the five is an integer and the
00:37 - 4.5
00:38 - is a string i mean a float that
00:41 - construction
00:42 - means
00:55 - curly brackets cups every
01:00 - curly brackets
01:03 - hours okay then dot format
01:08 - drink cups
01:13 - so here we have a list and the first is
01:16 - drink so there are also three curly
01:20 - fat targets so the first is drink so the
01:23 - drink will go to the first pair
01:25 - the second is cup so the cups will go to
01:27 - the second pair
01:28 - and the third it will go to the
01:31 - third okay so let's print
01:36 - instructions okay let's save it
01:40 - with um control s and then
01:43 - go to the terminal and type p y format
01:48 - dot p one it says milk
01:51 - take five cups every four 4.5 hours
01:54 - that worked let's delete the
01:56 - instructions and print
01:58 - then we'll do instructions
02:01 - equals curly brackets
02:05 - and the two inside okay
02:08 - take curly brackets
02:12 - without one cups every
02:17 - curly bracket flip for zero hours
02:22 - then format
02:25 - format drink
02:31 - cup and then
02:34 - duration so again we have a list here
02:38 - and
02:38 - in the curly brackets we have numbers
02:42 - so um the zero
02:46 - the numbers represent the position the
02:50 - variables are in the list so first the
02:53 - string
02:54 - so the first
02:57 - first thing of the list is in position
03:00 - zero then the second is what so drink
03:03 - goes to the zero
03:04 - and then cups go to the one and then the
03:08 - duration goes to the two then let's do
03:12 - print instructions
03:16 - instructions and let's save it
03:19 - and you can use your up arrow to copy
03:22 - what you last typed in the
03:23 - term okay so 4.5 take five cups every
03:27 - milk
03:28 - hours okay let's delete this
03:31 - and do instructions
03:34 - vehicles curly brackets with drink in it
03:39 - take dash take
03:44 - curly rockets cups
03:49 - i mean like cups every
03:54 - no there's a cups in in front of
03:57 - every there's a a cups no
04:08 - okay
04:11 - cups every hour
04:14 - i mean curly brackets then duration then
04:17 - hour
04:19 - outwards dot
04:23 - format so drink
04:26 - equals water
04:30 - comma then cups equals
04:35 - 10 10 and duration
04:39 - duration equals six
04:43 - equals six i think
04:47 - yeah okay
04:52 - okay then let's do
04:56 - enter and print
05:00 - instruction so here we now in the curly
05:03 - brackets we now have
05:05 - the variables names so because we
05:08 - changed it
05:08 - yeah so the milk will be
05:12 - water then cups will be 10 and duration
05:15 - will be
05:16 - six yeah so we changed what's inside the
05:19 - variables
05:19 - and we put the variable names in the
05:23 - curly brackets let's save it and
05:27 - run it let's say water
05:30 - 10 cups every 6 hours
05:34 - i won't like okay next we're
05:38 - going to do all of it and do
05:41 - name equals world
05:45 - then message equal f
05:50 - so here we're going to do
05:54 - before the so we're going to do f
05:58 - so the f is a f string and it's just a
06:01 - shorter
06:02 - version of the f of the format function
06:05 - and so this you can do the use
06:08 - the format function without that much
06:11 - typing
06:12 - so we're going to do
06:16 - curly brackets with name inside
06:20 - so the name is equals to whales so when
06:23 - we print it
06:24 - it will say hello world yeah so then
06:27 - we're gonna do
06:28 - print message message
06:32 - okay so we're going to save it
06:35 - and what
06:38 - hello world yeah so the name
06:41 - is a world and there's already a hello
06:45 - so it's going to be hello world yeah so
06:48 - let's delete this
06:49 - then count equals 10 equals
06:54 - value equals three point
06:58 - three point fourteen and
07:02 - message equal f
07:06 - the f string count two
07:10 - two curly bracket count
07:15 - then period okay
07:19 - then multiply by
07:24 - multiply by
07:27 - curly bracket value value okay so again
07:30 - we have the f
07:32 - and the count in here and the value in
07:35 - here
07:36 - okay let's save it no we forgot to print
07:38 - the message
07:39 - oh so i don't have to save it in the
07:42 - search
07:42 - and save it and run it
07:46 - so it says count to 10 multiplied by
07:49 - 3.14
07:50 - so the count became a 10 and the value
07:53 - became a 3.14
07:55 - then we're gonna do with equal
07:59 - five then height equals
08:03 - ten and print
08:07 - the f string um the parameter
08:24 - two stars so the star
08:27 - is multiplication in python
08:33 - so here we're multiplying two
08:36 - two times width so multiply inside a
08:40 - print function is not
08:41 - actually recommended okay then plus
08:45 - no the plus is supposed to be inside
08:47 - that
08:49 - plus two
08:53 - brackets okay
08:57 - height so here we're adding two times
09:00 - width and two times height together okay
09:03 - then
09:05 - a curly bracket then and
09:09 - the area area is
09:12 - curly bracket with
09:17 - do we need brackets yes i mean no
09:23 - star height
09:26 - height okay so here or
09:31 - now we're multiplying width and height
09:35 - okay yeah okay let's save it
09:38 - and and run
09:42 - py format.py
09:47 - says the parameter is 30 and the area is
09:51 - 50.
09:52 - okay so let's delete this and next we're
09:55 - going to do
09:58 - value equals height
10:02 - then print a string then
10:05 - dot dot then curly brackets and
10:09 - value colon
10:12 - less than 25
10:16 - then another dot here so we have a less
10:19 - than 25
10:21 - and so this is gonna add spaces
10:25 - on the on the right right
10:28 - yeah so the high also counts as
10:32 - 2 so it's basically going to add 23
10:35 - and then there are also going to be
10:37 - periods on the left and right
10:40 - okay let's save it and run it
10:44 - so it has a dot and then high
10:47 - and then spaces and then another
10:50 - dot okay let's do
10:55 - print value
10:59 - you forget the s thing okay
11:02 - so then dot then curly brackets the
11:05 - value
11:08 - big garden out
11:12 - because oh yeah colon bigger than
11:15 - 25 and then i'm done
11:18 - so now we have a bigger than psi so it's
11:22 - going to make
11:23 - the spaces to the left so again we
11:26 - only add 20 free spaces and then there
11:30 - are done
11:31 - okay let's save it and run
11:34 - so now there's a period and then there
11:37 - are
11:38 - spaces and then high and then another
11:41 - dot
11:43 - okay so then we're going to do print
11:48 - then f string then dot
11:52 - then curly brackets and value
11:55 - going to do a carrot oh yeah
11:58 - then carrot and then 25.
12:03 - so now we got yeah okay so now we have a
12:06 - carrot and
12:08 - so it's facing up so and
12:11 - like if you minus two from 25 is going
12:14 - to be 23
12:15 - and the carrot is gonna split
12:19 - the spaces so the high is in the middle
12:22 - but 23 is not
12:24 - equal so the on the
12:28 - left there will be
12:31 - um 11 spaces and on the right there will
12:34 - be
12:34 - 12 spaces okay so let's save it
12:38 - and run okay so now
12:41 - there's a dot spaces high
12:44 - then another spaces and done so
12:48 - these are also used for padding and
12:50 - alignment
12:51 - okay let's then do print
12:55 - a string then dot
12:58 - curly brackets value colon
13:03 - then we do a dash and then a carrot
13:06 - and then 25 then another done
13:11 - okay so now we have a dash here so it's
13:14 - gonna replace the
13:16 - this empty spaces with dashes
13:20 - so there will be 11 dashes on the
13:23 - yeah and 12 stashes on the right
13:26 - let's save it and run it
13:30 - so now there's a dot and there are 11
13:33 - dashes then
13:34 - hi then
13:37 - uh 12 dashes over here
13:40 - okay it worked and that's it for today
13:45 - thank you for watching
13:46 - remember to smash it up and subscribe
13:50 - bye bye

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to quitting with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python so today we're going to learn a string helper function the format helper function so first i'm going to create a new file i'm going to name it format dot py okay then i'm going to do train equals milk and cups equal five then duration equals 4.5 so the first the drink the milk is a string and then the five is an integer and the 4.5 is a string i mean a float that construction means curly brackets cups every curly brackets hours okay then dot format drink cups so here we have a list and the first is drink so there are also three curly fat targets so the first is drink so the drink will go to the first pair the second is cup so the cups will go to the second pair and the third it will go to the third okay so let's print instructions okay let's save it with um control s and then go to the terminal and type p y format dot p one it says milk take five cups every four 4.5 hours that worked let's delete the instructions and print then we'll do instructions equals curly brackets and the two inside okay take curly brackets without one cups every curly bracket flip for zero hours then format format drink cup and then duration so again we have a list here and in the curly brackets we have numbers so um the zero the numbers represent the position the variables are in the list so first the string so the first first thing of the list is in position zero then the second is what so drink goes to the zero and then cups go to the one and then the duration goes to the two then let's do print instructions instructions and let's save it and you can use your up arrow to copy what you last typed in the term okay so 4.5 take five cups every milk hours okay let's delete this and do instructions vehicles curly brackets with drink in it take dash take curly rockets cups i mean like cups every no there's a cups in in front of every there's a a cups no okay cups every hour i mean curly brackets then duration then hour outwards dot format so drink equals water comma then cups equals 10 10 and duration duration equals six equals six i think yeah okay okay then let's do enter and print instruction so here we now in the curly brackets we now have the variables names so because we changed it yeah so the milk will be water then cups will be 10 and duration will be six yeah so we changed what's inside the variables and we put the variable names in the curly brackets let's save it and run it let's say water 10 cups every 6 hours i won't like okay next we're going to do all of it and do name equals world then message equal f so here we're going to do before the so we're going to do f so the f is a f string and it's just a shorter version of the f of the format function and so this you can do the use the format function without that much typing so we're going to do curly brackets with name inside so the name is equals to whales so when we print it it will say hello world yeah so then we're gonna do print message message okay so we're going to save it and what hello world yeah so the name is a world and there's already a hello so it's going to be hello world yeah so let's delete this then count equals 10 equals value equals three point three point fourteen and message equal f the f string count two two curly bracket count then period okay then multiply by multiply by curly bracket value value okay so again we have the f and the count in here and the value in here okay let's save it no we forgot to print the message oh so i don't have to save it in the search and save it and run it so it says count to 10 multiplied by 3.14 so the count became a 10 and the value became a 3.14 then we're gonna do with equal five then height equals ten and print the f string um the parameter two stars so the star is multiplication in python so here we're multiplying two two times width so multiply inside a print function is not actually recommended okay then plus no the plus is supposed to be inside that plus two brackets okay height so here we're adding two times width and two times height together okay then a curly bracket then and the area area is curly bracket with do we need brackets yes i mean no star height height okay so here or now we're multiplying width and height okay yeah okay let's save it and and run py format.py says the parameter is 30 and the area is 50. okay so let's delete this and next we're going to do value equals height then print a string then dot dot then curly brackets and value colon less than 25 then another dot here so we have a less than 25 and so this is gonna add spaces on the on the right right yeah so the high also counts as 2 so it's basically going to add 23 and then there are also going to be periods on the left and right okay let's save it and run it so it has a dot and then high and then spaces and then another dot okay let's do print value you forget the s thing okay so then dot then curly brackets the value big garden out because oh yeah colon bigger than 25 and then i'm done so now we have a bigger than psi so it's going to make the spaces to the left so again we only add 20 free spaces and then there are done okay let's save it and run so now there's a period and then there are spaces and then high and then another dot okay so then we're going to do print then f string then dot then curly brackets and value going to do a carrot oh yeah then carrot and then 25. so now we got yeah okay so now we have a carrot and so it's facing up so and like if you minus two from 25 is going to be 23 and the carrot is gonna split the spaces so the high is in the middle but 23 is not equal so the on the left there will be um 11 spaces and on the right there will be 12 spaces okay so let's save it and run okay so now there's a dot spaces high then another spaces and done so these are also used for padding and alignment okay let's then do print a string then dot curly brackets value colon then we do a dash and then a carrot and then 25 then another done okay so now we have a dash here so it's gonna replace the this empty spaces with dashes so there will be 11 dashes on the yeah and 12 stashes on the right let's save it and run it so now there's a dot and there are 11 dashes then hi then uh 12 dashes over here okay it worked and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash it up and subscribe bye bye
