00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:04 - andrew today we're minecraft education
00:06 - edition and we're going to make a
00:08 - project called garden so we're in
00:10 - microsoft make code and we're going to
00:13 - go into a project called card so first
00:16 - we hit on chat command so our chat
00:20 - command is here
00:22 - when you type garden onto the on chat
00:25 - onto the chat
00:27 - so i'm going to use a thing called the
00:29 - builder which is basically an invisible
00:31 - agent that can help you build so first
00:34 - we need to do the builder teleport to
00:37 - zero zero zero which is right now our
00:39 - position yeah but you can't see the
00:41 - builder so it's invisible no
00:44 - it's not the agent
00:46 - then you'll need to have every time
00:49 - repeat loop repeat 10 times so this is
00:53 - just like another project i made
00:55 - like the tower but adding because this
00:58 - is not a tower
01:02 - time four times
01:04 - so this is just part one of the garden
01:07 - then you need to build a trace path
01:10 - so
01:11 - whenever the building moves
01:13 - um the block you select will
01:16 - appear so when you require it is
01:20 - glass for our garden
01:21 - so right now we're building like the
01:23 - dome right yeah with a door okay
01:28 - okay
01:29 - so
01:31 - build a trace path so wherever moves
01:33 - glass blocks will follow
01:36 - then we need builder
01:38 - move forward by one so so finally it
01:41 - will have a glass block
01:43 - like up here behind it so now we're
01:46 - gonna try to run it
01:49 - so first we do garden to like start
01:54 - garden
01:57 - a bunch of them because we did the
01:59 - repeat loops
02:01 - right now the builder
02:03 - the builder is making a line
02:06 - of glass
02:09 - okay so
02:10 - i think it's going to repeat for like 40
02:12 - times
02:14 - yeah
02:15 - holy crash
02:18 - it replaces
02:20 - okay this is better than the agent
02:23 - okay let's go
02:24 - just keep going
02:26 - okay
02:28 - so we need to move forward by five times
02:32 - five times then turn right so it won't
02:35 - just keep on going like
02:38 - um
02:39 - forward forward forever that would be
02:41 - like
02:42 - does not do
02:44 - then
02:45 - well
02:46 - outside the repeat four we needed
02:48 - builder move up
02:50 - so after it's complete with
02:53 - one one floor it will move up to make
02:55 - the other so there will be 10 floors
02:58 - that is big
03:00 - yeah then
03:02 - we make the dome without a top so when
03:06 - it rains it rains
03:08 - because the
03:09 - plants need water yeah
03:11 - so when you move down to build the door
03:14 - for us to go in
03:16 - so move down by 10 because there's 10
03:20 - floors right now the
03:22 - builder must be like 10 blocks high up
03:24 - there
03:25 - then build a turn right so it can go
03:28 - like somewhere not near the edge
03:30 - turn
03:32 - right
03:33 - yeah
03:35 - right
03:36 - then build and move forward
03:40 - one time
03:42 - then place the door
03:44 - twice okay so now we're right here in
03:48 - the blocks we're gonna scroll up
03:51 - and we're gonna search
03:53 - here
03:55 - item
03:56 - because the door is
03:59 - um if you don't add the item you can
04:01 - only get blocks so i'm gonna do the door
04:04 - i'm just gonna choose the regular oak
04:06 - door or any door you want i like the
04:08 - bridge door because you know okay
04:11 - okay yeah
04:12 - that's it's very big so
04:16 - let's let's go
04:18 - over here
04:19 - don't disturb anything
04:21 - okay
04:22 - now i'm gonna do the gardening
04:25 - [Music]
04:36 - so
04:37 - you can like um make how big your garden
04:39 - is by
04:41 - changing the moving forward and repeat
04:44 - loops the move forward is for how long
04:46 - each row is like like this like this
04:50 - and the repeat 10 times is for how many
04:54 - floors it will have like how many blocks
04:57 - the glass will be
04:59 - so right now it's just building small
05:01 - squares so this is a little small it's
05:02 - just tall
05:04 - but it's still good
05:05 - for somebody who wants a
05:08 - they have a little space but they want
05:10 - garden that's tall
05:12 - okay
05:14 - glass
05:16 - okay
05:17 - this is finished
05:19 - so before oh there's a door here it's
05:22 - open because it eliminates the um
05:26 - theater yeah this is like a miniature
05:28 - cage
05:29 - so next we're gonna see it in python
05:33 - [Music]
05:34 - okay so def on a chat doesn't function
05:37 - builder that teleport to position zero
05:39 - zero zero so the builder will teleport
05:41 - to where you are then four index and
05:43 - range ten and four index two and range
05:45 - four so repeat that two will be cool
05:47 - yeah
05:48 - that trace path graph so it trades
05:51 - a glass block
05:53 - where the builder walks and then builder
05:54 - that move forward five times so make the
05:57 - first side and build that turn right
05:59 - turn to do the other side and then out
06:01 - of the
06:03 - repeat loop of four
06:05 - builder for index two another that move
06:07 - up one to make the second floor and
06:10 - builder that move down ten times i'll
06:13 - give you that two people yeah then
06:15 - better that turn right turn bit of that
06:17 - move forward one time so move forward
06:19 - and brother that place the burst drawer
06:21 - so i'll place the door where you can go
06:23 - in the cage and then that's the function
06:26 - yeah and then player that unchecked when
06:28 - you type guardian in the chat it'll run
06:30 - the function
06:32 - okay
06:33 - so shall we plant plants
06:36 - well
06:37 - that will be the next part but if you
06:39 - want to right now okay okay
06:42 - go in
06:43 - how if we're in survival that's how we
06:46 - do it
06:50 - [Music]
06:56 - looks a little like stone but even dark
06:59 - wait there's a little like a little
07:00 - trace over here
07:02 - okay you know we need some seeds
07:06 - um
07:07 - let's see
07:09 - melon
07:10 - pumpkin and regularly how about bone
07:13 - meal
07:17 - [Music]
07:20 - okay we need a water bucket
07:22 - for water
07:24 - okay
07:26 - water bucket
07:27 - so we're just not gonna add the torches
07:30 - just yet okay
07:32 - oh okay
07:36 - let's look we're seeing ho ho
07:38 - here comes santa claus that's silly okay
07:42 - i think actually i would cut this rope
07:44 - and place the water in
07:46 - because we don't have that much space
07:48 - here
07:49 - okay then i want to plant the seeds
07:52 - pumpkin
07:53 - it's so little pumpkin needs space
08:10 - okay this you still have to wait it
08:13 - still has to wait this one you still
08:15 - have to wait so does the melon yeah
08:18 - pumpkin
08:20 - okay let's do this
08:23 - yeah yeah
08:27 - okay
08:33 - okay now we have to wait
08:36 - yeah
08:38 - [Music]

08:44 - time
08:46 - oh
08:47 - [Music]
08:49 - well
08:50 - i can plant oh those are that is so cool

09:38 - okay now let's go into the um
09:41 - garden slash cage and look outside
09:45 - it's like we're stuck in a beautiful
09:48 - cage
09:50 - don't want to stop them okay
09:52 - well that was fun and that's it for
