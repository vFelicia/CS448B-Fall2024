00:00 - welcome to clinton with kids
00:03 - my name is kalia and my name is andrew
00:05 - today we're in kodak and this is one of
00:07 - the projects we made
00:08 - random game so it's actually a sport
00:11 - game
00:12 - and it's have a lot of random
00:16 - except the speed and
00:20 - the player speed and the ball speed now
00:23 - let's see how
00:26 - oh there's a hockey stick
00:30 - hockey stick
00:35 - each kind of background have a different
00:37 - kind of like
00:38 - goal like this one and some of them are
00:44 - small
00:45 - some of them big so like this
00:48 - football field is a very easy one
00:51 - but and the soccer because they're both
00:54 - big
00:56 - now let's see let's see how it works
01:01 - so one run so when you press run that
01:04 - means you start it
01:05 - throw a new ball so it will like have a
01:08 - new ball
01:09 - there will be a ball so you can play
01:12 - then set
01:12 - player to a hockey stick you can choose
01:15 - others
01:17 - then set fast player speed so your
01:20 - your player speed will be fast so you
01:23 - can move it fast
01:25 - and the ball speed is fast too so when
01:28 - you start you're the same speed
01:31 - except random scenes so you don't know
01:33 - what kind of scene but
01:34 - you can choose i did random but you
01:37 - can't do random players so i like the
01:40 - hockey stick so i choose the hockey
01:42 - stick
01:42 - they set random ball so there is other
01:45 - two
01:47 - eventually there is actually a baseball
01:50 - you can make a baseball game a football
01:52 - game a hockey game or a soccer game or
01:54 - you can make a random game
01:56 - then when right arrow pressed then it
01:59 - will move right
02:00 - when left arrow press then it will move
02:04 - left when ball hits players so when it
02:07 - touches your player
02:08 - which is the hand hockey sticker foot
02:11 - it'll place
02:12 - bounce sound first it will bounce the
02:15 - ball so you won't
02:16 - earn any points or miss then set random
02:20 - scenes so when you tuck
02:21 - when the ball touches you it will set
02:24 - random scene
02:26 - then it will set perf speed very
02:30 - too fast which is the same then set ball
02:33 - speed to very fast
02:34 - so it's like a little challenging yeah
02:38 - when left arrow it will move left
02:41 - when ball hits the ball it will bounce
02:45 - ball because it's a wall you can't go
02:47 - through the wall
02:48 - yeah but because if you didn't have that
02:50 - code the ball will go
02:51 - out of the screen on your first like
02:53 - bounce
02:56 - when ball is in the goal which is over
02:59 - here
03:00 - or the other scenes have different kind
03:02 - of goals
03:03 - it will score points so we add one point
03:06 - to you
03:07 - your score you set random scenes so you
03:10 - need to change another city
03:11 - throw a new ball yeah before you
03:14 - set another random scene then
03:21 - it was one the whole hockey thing there
03:24 - was a hockey ball
03:26 - and a hockey scene and a hockey stick
03:28 - it's always a hockey stick
03:30 - so then set players speed be
03:33 - fast and sit balls speed faster it's
03:36 - just like one run
03:37 - but not when you touch you want the ball
03:40 - to touch you
03:41 - the plug you die
03:44 - when ball misses players someone goes
03:48 - score opponent point oh no
03:51 - the opponent got a point because you
03:54 - missed it
03:55 - throw new ball so wouldn't
03:59 - there won't be any
04:02 - no more balls so there will be
04:05 - one more ball so you can't keep playing
04:07 - then set random scenes
04:09 - set random ball and set fast player
04:12 - speed and
04:13 - fast ball speed so it's just like when
