00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:04 - Kalia my name is Andrew did I wear a
00:06 - Minecraft education Edition and in the
00:08 - hour of code Escape estate so we just
00:11 - completed this room the study in the
00:13 - last video and now we're gonna go
00:15 - through this
00:18 - door okay so now we went out we can't go
00:22 - there oh that's that's really nice
00:24 - friend okay oh where are we
00:29 - yeah because there's a zombie chef
00:32 - and there's wheat and stuff here this is
00:36 - cooking machines okay so now let's talk
00:39 - to the zombie chef
00:42 - [Music]
00:44 - he wants bread instead of brains
00:48 - I just said Brad Wow Let's go to Cohen
00:51 - do you see what I saw something on the
00:53 - wall
00:54 - like it says wheat number one and then
00:57 - chop it up two three you add some flour
01:02 - and then cook and bacon maybe that's how
01:05 - we make yeah the zombie Chef needs help
01:08 - making bread you see function below to
01:10 - create a bread recipe with zombie Chef
01:13 - can follow these are four functional
01:15 - Velda available that represent the
01:18 - different steps in Breaking Bread so
01:20 - yeah these are stuff harvest wheat so
01:22 - you first harvest the wheat
01:25 - um break the bread is the last thing
01:27 - make dough so this like um making the
01:30 - dough right here the third and middle
01:32 - wheat is the second so this is a code
01:35 - example let's see what is this
01:37 - fun
01:38 - okay
01:41 - zombie Chef got a wheat item then oh
01:45 - that doesn't work I can't make the the
01:48 - something the bread so he got the wheat
01:52 - he did it in the wrong steps yeah so now
01:56 - let's see
01:57 - okay so now chefs always want always
02:01 - keep a copy of the recipes around I
02:03 - wanna know where the zombie Chef had
02:05 - theirs figure out the correct steps then
02:08 - program a recipe for the zombie Chef to
02:10 - follow okay so this is not my recipe I
02:14 - saw on the wall is the correctness okay
02:16 - so first you need to get the wheat
02:19 - okay harvest wheat and then Mill weed is
02:22 - second so medium Mill wheat
02:27 - over here XX
02:30 - so the middle wheat was the last one now
02:32 - we press space
02:34 - and then after harvest we we did Mill
02:38 - weed okay and then make dough and bake
02:42 - bread that's right okay now we're gonna
02:45 - run it and see if the zombie Chef makes
02:47 - bread okay
02:48 - some Chef gets weak okay milk and milk
02:52 - get sugar sugar oh he's gonna cook it oh
02:57 - bread puzzle song wait what's this now
03:01 - it's something creepy there's a bunch of
03:04 - zombies coming on and there's something
03:06 - they're on platforms okay let's see what
03:09 - this has we have apples okay the whole
03:13 - house is hungry that's his family and
03:18 - what better to feed it than Apples
03:20 - salmon and mushroom stew see if you can
03:24 - figure out how many how many of each
03:26 - ingredient the house needs requires use
03:30 - the free house function to Define what
03:33 - items you want to feed it so
03:36 - um the options are Apple mushroom stew
03:39 - and salmon so let's see
03:42 - um oh top one needs money through the
03:45 - middle the bottom one needs Apple in the
03:47 - middle one needs salmon okay let's see
03:49 - what those like each of them have like
03:52 - different color example let's see the
03:55 - house four apples and one mushrooms too
03:58 - free oh it drops out of the thing oh
04:02 - it spits them no it's not a house oh
04:06 - it's not right eating it that's a whole
04:08 - face yeah it doesn't want it that's okay
04:11 - let's see this one is just with the um
04:14 - yeah it's a repeat Loop but it does just
04:17 - the same exact thing as this one
04:20 - yeah so yeah the repeat Loop will help
04:23 - us so it has it is the same thing crunch
04:27 - ooh crunch
04:29 - no it doesn't want that okay so now
04:33 - zombie chefs are holding food while they
04:35 - ride by on platters there seems to be a
04:38 - pattern here I wonder if they are here
04:40 - to feed the house figure out how many
04:42 - each
04:42 - food item the house wants them write a
04:45 - program to feed the house the correct
04:47 - amount
04:48 - Okay so
04:49 - so oh two mushrooms okay free apples and
04:55 - four salads okay
04:57 - okay free house so was free apples so
05:02 - we're gonna do four Iron Range to like
05:05 - um to Lucy's over here
05:09 - okay so for Iron Range we're gonna do it
05:14 - three times for apples
05:16 - free time
05:19 - for apples so I'm just gonna delete this
05:23 - because we just need apples for Iron
05:25 - Range free house apples do a tab so it's
05:28 - inside the
05:29 - um the loop and then it needs free
05:32 - apples
05:33 - two apples two stews so we can do just
05:37 - like do feed house
05:39 - um two stews and then like repeat it but
05:42 - we're just gonna do the loop it's the
05:44 - same amount of um code so fee house
05:48 - mushrooms do
05:51 - mushrooms no it doesn't look it's only
05:55 - the space mushrooms too it has a space
05:58 - right there
05:59 - okay and then feed the house four what
06:04 - is it four yeah salmon
06:12 - bead house
06:14 - it looks like a horse honestly song
06:18 - make sure you spell everything right or
06:20 - else it won't go correctly okay now
06:22 - let's feed them free okay apples
06:24 - mushroom and then some
06:30 - crunchy
06:34 - it's blushing cool so for the next video
06:38 - we're gonna see what is going on here
06:41 - zombie Wither Skeleton regular skeleton
06:43 - and Creeper all sitting at a table ready
06:46 - for dinner oh there's a diary page let's
06:49 - see this first
06:51 - entry free the kitchen dear diary today
06:54 - I stumble upon a large dining area here
06:56 - I found a frightening creature looming
06:58 - in the kitchen
06:59 - seemingly obvious of my presence when I
07:03 - gained the courage to speak with thee
07:07 - um with the
07:08 - with the chef it only grown bread there
07:14 - I
07:15 - help this goalish cook perhaps if I do
07:19 - it can show me the way out so that is
07:22 - like somebody who wrote it when it first
07:24 - met the zombie show so in the next video
07:27 - we're gonna help these four creatures
07:30 - these four mobs in doing something looks
07:35 - like something with the dishes anyways
07:37 - well that was fun and that's it for
07:40 - today thank you for watching Remember to
