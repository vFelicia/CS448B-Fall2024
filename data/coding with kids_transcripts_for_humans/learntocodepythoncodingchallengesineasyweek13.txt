00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:04 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in
00:06 - edible so edible is a coding platform
00:08 - where there are lots of coding problems
00:10 - you can solve using different coding
00:13 - languages
00:13 - So today we're gonna do three easy
00:15 - coding challenges using python so our
00:19 - first coding challenge is called reform
00:21 - the word a word has been split into a
00:24 - left part and a right part we form the
00:26 - word by adding both Halls together
00:28 - chaining the first character to an
00:31 - uppercase letter
00:32 - so for example here there are two parts
00:35 - of a word C's and oh no so the actual
00:39 - word is seasonal so we had to combine
00:41 - these two parts and capitalize the first
00:44 - letter
00:45 - so first we have a function called get
00:47 - word with two variables the left and the
00:49 - right parts of the word
00:52 - so first we're going to join them
00:53 - together to make one word so we're going
00:56 - to do word a new variable equals left
00:58 - plus right so now we have the actual
01:01 - word but we still have to capitalize it
01:04 - so next we're going to make a word two
01:06 - variable with word.capitalize so the
01:09 - capitalize function will capitalize your
01:12 - the first letter of the word
01:15 - so then finally we're going to return
01:17 - the word to variable
01:19 - so now that some test cases there are
01:21 - lots of words this is far well there is
01:25 - fair and then well and then because
01:28 - capitals capital F and then far well
01:31 - and this person oh no so it's personal
01:35 - with a capitalized P okay so we pass all
01:40 - our tests onto our next coding challenge
01:43 - so our next coding challenge is called
01:45 - count syllables create a function that
01:48 - counts the number of syllables a word
01:49 - has each syllable is separated but with
01:52 - a dash so you can see here it will give
01:55 - us a word separated into syllables and
01:58 - it will be separated by dashes
02:01 - so we can use these dashes to our
02:03 - advantage
02:05 - so first we have a function called
02:06 - number of syllables with with a variable
02:09 - called word
02:11 - so first we're going to count how many
02:12 - syllables there are occurrences equals
02:15 - word account the dash plus one so I
02:19 - figured out that the number of dashes is
02:22 - how many syllables there are but you
02:25 - have to add one so example beautiful
02:28 - that's three syllables but there are
02:30 - only two dashes
02:32 - add one to make it three same here
02:36 - Monumental that's four syllables with
02:40 - three dashes in it so now the cow
02:43 - function will count how much of whatever
02:46 - you put in here in this case we put a
02:48 - dash is in whatever you put here which
02:51 - is the word
02:53 - so then we're gonna add the number of
02:55 - dashes in the word plus one
02:58 - to get the number of syllables finally
03:01 - we're going to return our variable
03:03 - occurrences so now let's see the test
03:05 - cases there is overly again there are
03:09 - two dashes and three syllables so we add
03:11 - one to get three and flew it one dash
03:15 - two syllables so one plus one equals two
03:18 - so we pass all our tests onto our final
03:21 - coding challenge
03:23 - final cutting challenge is called
03:25 - convert number to corresponding month
03:27 - name create a function that takes a
03:30 - number from 1 to 12 and returns its
03:33 - corresponding month name as a string for
03:35 - example if you're given 3 as an input
03:37 - your function should return March
03:39 - because March is the third month so we
03:42 - here we have the list of the numbers and
03:45 - the month names so whatever number out
03:48 - of 12 is whatever number whatever month
03:52 - when you get for example if we get the
03:55 - number eight we have to return the
03:56 - string August because August is the
03:59 - eighth month yeah okay
04:01 - you can expect only integers ranging
04:04 - from 1 to 12 as a test input so you
04:06 - don't have to worry about a number that
04:09 - doesn't have a month with it so first we
04:11 - have a function called month name with a
04:14 - with a variable called number which is
04:16 - the number we are given from 1 to 12. so
04:19 - first we're going to do if number equals
04:22 - equals one we're going to return January
04:24 - so we need two equal signs because if
04:27 - you only have one equal sign it's
04:29 - assigning something two equal signs
04:31 - actually means equal to
04:33 - so if number is one we're going to
04:35 - return the first month with January so
04:38 - then we're going to do the same with all
04:40 - the months and numbers from 1 to 12.
04:43 - here it's going to be very long code
04:45 - remember to use else if not else
04:49 - so else if num equals equals two we're
04:51 - gonna return February and do the same
04:53 - for all the months
04:56 - and the last else if you can also change
04:58 - it to an else else return December
05:00 - because if
05:02 - it doesn't have one to eleven that means
05:05 - it's 12 so you can be sure that is it
05:08 - December because there aren't no numbers
05:10 - over 12 or under one
05:13 - so this is very long
05:16 - 25 but it's just the same like same
05:19 - repeating the same thing except just
05:21 - different numbers and different
05:23 - yeah so now we're gonna check it and see
05:26 - the test cases so there is one to twelve
05:29 - and all the months
05:31 - okay so now all tests are passed well
05:35 - that was fun and that's it for today
05:38 - thank you for watching Remember to smash
05:41 - that button and subscribe bye bye

welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in edible so edible is a coding platform where there are lots of coding problems you can solve using different coding languages So today we're gonna do three easy coding challenges using python so our first coding challenge is called reform the word a word has been split into a left part and a right part we form the word by adding both Halls together chaining the first character to an uppercase letter so for example here there are two parts of a word C's and oh no so the actual word is seasonal so we had to combine these two parts and capitalize the first letter so first we have a function called get word with two variables the left and the right parts of the word so first we're going to join them together to make one word so we're going to do word a new variable equals left plus right so now we have the actual word but we still have to capitalize it so next we're going to make a word two variable with word.capitalize so the capitalize function will capitalize your the first letter of the word so then finally we're going to return the word to variable so now that some test cases there are lots of words this is far well there is fair and then well and then because capitals capital F and then far well and this person oh no so it's personal with a capitalized P okay so we pass all our tests onto our next coding challenge so our next coding challenge is called count syllables create a function that counts the number of syllables a word has each syllable is separated but with a dash so you can see here it will give us a word separated into syllables and it will be separated by dashes so we can use these dashes to our advantage so first we have a function called number of syllables with with a variable called word so first we're going to count how many syllables there are occurrences equals word account the dash plus one so I figured out that the number of dashes is how many syllables there are but you have to add one so example beautiful that's three syllables but there are only two dashes add one to make it three same here Monumental that's four syllables with three dashes in it so now the cow function will count how much of whatever you put in here in this case we put a dash is in whatever you put here which is the word so then we're gonna add the number of dashes in the word plus one to get the number of syllables finally we're going to return our variable occurrences so now let's see the test cases there is overly again there are two dashes and three syllables so we add one to get three and flew it one dash two syllables so one plus one equals two so we pass all our tests onto our final coding challenge final cutting challenge is called convert number to corresponding month name create a function that takes a number from 1 to 12 and returns its corresponding month name as a string for example if you're given 3 as an input your function should return March because March is the third month so we here we have the list of the numbers and the month names so whatever number out of 12 is whatever number whatever month when you get for example if we get the number eight we have to return the string August because August is the eighth month yeah okay you can expect only integers ranging from 1 to 12 as a test input so you don't have to worry about a number that doesn't have a month with it so first we have a function called month name with a with a variable called number which is the number we are given from 1 to 12. so first we're going to do if number equals equals one we're going to return January so we need two equal signs because if you only have one equal sign it's assigning something two equal signs actually means equal to so if number is one we're going to return the first month with January so then we're going to do the same with all the months and numbers from 1 to 12. here it's going to be very long code remember to use else if not else so else if num equals equals two we're gonna return February and do the same for all the months and the last else if you can also change it to an else else return December because if it doesn't have one to eleven that means it's 12 so you can be sure that is it December because there aren't no numbers over 12 or under one so this is very long 25 but it's just the same like same repeating the same thing except just different numbers and different yeah so now we're gonna check it and see the test cases so there is one to twelve and all the months okay so now all tests are passed well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash that button and subscribe bye bye
