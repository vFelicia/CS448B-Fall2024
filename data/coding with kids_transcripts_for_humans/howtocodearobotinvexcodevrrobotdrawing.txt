00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - kalia and my name's andy today we're in
00:05 - flexco and we'll tell you um the project
00:08 - will be about robot drawing the
00:10 - description
00:11 - this example will draw lines on the page
00:14 - and show how to change the colors of
00:15 - lines
00:16 - the program will be grid map and we're
00:19 - going to change a lot of
00:20 - different playgrounds the first thing is
00:22 - we're going to move robot
00:24 - down it's in looks and
00:27 - move robot pen down
00:31 - drive forward for 200 millimeters
00:34 - okay then set robot color to
00:38 - red okay
00:41 - set robot color to red
00:45 - then drive forward for 200 millimeters
00:49 - again
00:52 - robots pen
00:56 - okay then drive forward for 200
01:00 - millimeters
01:03 - okay then move the pen
01:06 - down color to
01:11 - blue no not print
01:14 - set robot color to
01:17 - blue okay then
01:21 - drive forward for 200 millimeters
01:25 - what do you think it will do i think it
01:27 - will move from a pen
01:28 - down then it will drop black because the
01:32 - rubber pen is down but no color so it
01:34 - will be black
01:35 - it will drive forward for 200
01:37 - millimeters
01:38 - it will set robot pin color to red
01:42 - then drive forward for 200 millimeters
01:45 - then it will move robo pen
01:46 - up so it won't draw anything then it
01:49 - will drive for 200 meters again
01:51 - then move lower pen down to dragon it
01:54 - will set robot
01:55 - pen color to blue and
01:58 - drive forward for 200 millimeters
02:02 - okay let's start we're gonna be in grid
02:05 - map
02:06 - and so here it's really going to
02:10 - be first it will be black then red then
02:14 - no color which is white then
02:17 - blue okay let's do it so see it's black
02:22 - then red then it's going to be nothing
02:27 - then blue please now it stops because
02:31 - there's
02:32 - no code yeah commands and
02:35 - who's doing free okay
02:39 - let me restart it okay let's see
02:42 - oh yeah restart
02:46 - okay 3d
02:50 - okay let's see black red
02:54 - then blue
02:57 - now let's play it again oh
03:00 - look at that it's like running the code
03:03 - again
03:04 - it's so cool it crashed
03:07 - because there's no more play okay now
03:10 - let's
03:11 - change to disk mover
03:14 - okay let's see what it does here it can
03:17 - be different because it's different
03:18 - playgrounds and maybe there will be
03:21 - things to smash into
03:23 - i don't really think so so here i will
03:26 - do the same code
03:27 - oh look at this let's do it to 3d
03:32 - let's see what will happen
03:35 - let's see let's see
03:40 - okay black then red
03:44 - dancing and blue
03:47 - hmm now let's stop it again
03:52 - and run it again let's see
03:55 - it went on to that oh look at that so
03:59 - cool that's close and
04:03 - thanks for watching remember to smash
04:06 - like and subscribe bye
