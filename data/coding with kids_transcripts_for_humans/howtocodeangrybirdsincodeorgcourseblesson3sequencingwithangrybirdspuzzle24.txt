01:21 - one more block farther yeah
01:24 - and now it says to attach two east
01:27 - blocks
01:28 - to get to the pig now same as last time
01:31 - we can
01:31 - go west north or south because we're
01:35 - surrounded by tnt
01:37 - yeah so again if we touch tnt we'll lose
01:40 - so let's attach the first east and run
01:44 - it
