00:00 - welcome to quitting with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in
00:05 - Minecraft education Edition hour of code
00:07 - Escape estate so in the last video we
00:09 - went to the side rooms and unlocked the
00:11 - Cannons and now we have this time portal
00:13 - so let's see what we have to do with
00:15 - code
00:16 - the time agents are underneath this High
00:18 - Mark they've used their powers to create
00:20 - protective colored rings around we used
00:22 - to activate Canon function to activate
00:24 - the colored cannons in the same order as
00:27 - the colored rates to disable the
00:29 - timeline
00:30 - to activate K9 function takes one
00:32 - parameter that defines what color Canon
00:34 - you want to activate blue yellow magenta
00:37 - and green okay so the protective frames
00:40 - so the outside is first is blue and the
00:43 - end screen and yellow and then magenta
00:45 - okay and this is just the time okay so
00:48 - let's go to code so this is the code
00:49 - example
00:51 - the first is blue so the code example
00:54 - first part is the blue Canon right there
00:56 - then it's gonna shoot blue and improve
00:58 - the blue ring then next
01:01 - gonna do the yellow the yellow but it's
01:03 - wrong because the Nyx room is the green
01:05 - one okay so you can see that fish since
01:08 - he's blue he has the blue ring then when
01:10 - the blue ring bursts he fell down
01:13 - okay it's weird that Rascal doesn't
01:16 - happen he's the boss
01:18 - yeah so now first is blue which is right
01:20 - and the second one is green
01:23 - so we're gonna change it to three and
01:24 - then we're gonna do the same with other
01:26 - other functions
01:29 - [Music]
01:34 - and
01:36 - then the last one is Magento
01:41 - then we will break all the ribs
01:46 - [Music]
01:47 - okay okay so now let's run the code and
01:50 - we should break all the Rings in
01:52 - protection that they have so first the
01:55 - blue kit boom so now magenta gets full
01:59 - it's knocked out next the green one boom
02:02 - and there's only two more the yellow one
02:07 - and now the last one
02:11 - it's gonna shoot
02:12 - another no more protection rules it's
02:15 - only Rascals oh time oh he also got
02:19 - locked up and the time will disappear
02:22 - Tara so the time ages extend over the
02:25 - time or two now's our chance that we
02:27 - should rotate the magnetic disc beneath
02:29 - the floor you can reverse the Polaris
02:31 - and trapped in there track them here
02:33 - once and forth itself break this glass
02:36 - or something
02:39 - they move it okay and then they will get
02:42 - trapped in there forever okay so now
02:45 - let's see okay activate the trap now
02:47 - it's your chance to capture the Time
02:48 - regions into the center of the Boss
02:50 - Arena and look down you'll need to align
02:52 - all three rings with the center colors
02:54 - of the trap to activate it rotate room
02:57 - continue to rotate each ring either
02:59 - clockwise or counterclockwise to align
03:01 - all the colors the other rings are outer
03:03 - middle inner and valve directions are
03:06 - clockwise it counts are clockwise okay
03:08 - so let's see the cut example
03:13 - oh
03:14 - so there are three rings as you can see
03:16 - and you have to align the colors or the
03:18 - numbers it's
03:20 - us with the middle
03:22 - so each so they all have numbers on the
03:25 - columns
03:26 - Okay so
03:28 - you spell border let's see what we have
03:31 - to do okay so let's go to
03:35 - so first let's see it rotates that outer
03:38 - one the outer ring clockwise so let's
03:41 - see what this is okay so does that okay
03:44 - so that the first the first two lines of
03:47 - code
03:48 - no you have to align like with the
03:51 - center colors so
03:54 - like the outer ring will have to move
03:57 - one side
04:00 - um clockwise wait counterclockwise I
04:03 - clockwise yeah it has to move
04:06 - counterclockwise the old ring has to
04:08 - move counterclockwise once okay so let's
04:11 - see
04:13 - [Music]
04:20 - okay and then let's see the I don't know
04:25 - okay so the outer ring is good and then
04:28 - now we have to do the middle one middle
04:31 - ring so this the middle ring is also
04:33 - good
04:34 - oh yeah it is so now we'll just have the
04:37 - inner ring the inner ring we need to go
04:39 - either counterclockwise or clockwise be
04:42 - wise so it doesn't really matter
04:46 - to
04:48 - rotate ring
04:50 - called The Middle
04:55 - inner ring and we're gonna move that
04:58 - clockwise
04:59 - and we're just gonna repeat that two
05:03 - times
05:04 - [Music]
05:06 - and you're here
05:09 - so now we should have aligned
05:13 - [Music]
05:15 - okay let's see
05:16 - [Music]
05:19 - okay
05:23 - so the outer two rings are aligned and
05:26 - then for the final inner ring
05:29 - okay puzzle solved it's another
05:32 - completed Trophy and locked
05:35 - [Music]
05:37 - in the middle
05:39 - and we're gonna get out of the glass and
05:41 - then we're gonna get sucked in oh boy
05:45 - the thing won't pop out now they're
05:47 - getting inside
05:50 - and now they're traveling Tara you did
05:54 - it you really stuck it to those timings
05:55 - or should I say you really stuck those
05:57 - top ages to this top
05:59 - sorry I'm still working on this thing
06:02 - she's all right ages so we're right here
06:04 - to think about what they have done after
06:06 - you come with me I'll show you the way
06:08 - out let's go
06:10 - Escape From The Mansion
06:13 - congratulations your coding skills saves
06:15 - the day again who knows what trouble the
06:17 - time idiots will have stirred up if they
06:19 - had escaped the estate well done
06:21 - there's still one question I have those
06:23 - diary Pages where do you think they came
06:25 - from you still don't know who they're
06:27 - trying a guy pop out it's the actual Dr
06:29 - brickowski
06:31 - do it from me Dr dots forkowski those
06:35 - temporal troublemakers lured me to this
06:37 - place too I've actually been trying to
