00:00 - welcome to getting with kids my name is
00:03 - clea
00:03 - and my name is andrew today we are going
00:05 - to teach you python so today we want to
00:07 - learn about partial functions
00:09 - so partial functions will turn your a
00:12 - function with x parameters into a
00:13 - function with
00:15 - less parameters so first we're going to
00:17 - do from func tools
00:19 - we're going to import the partial then
00:21 - we'll
00:22 - do example one def which is defined
00:25 - multiply and there are two parameters
00:26 - x and y return x star y so
00:30 - star is basically the multiplication
00:32 - symbol
00:33 - so here you enter two numbers and then
00:36 - the function
00:37 - will multiply the two numbers and then
00:40 - it will give you the answer
00:42 - so now going to make a variable called
00:45 - triple
00:46 - equals partial so we're going to use the
00:48 - partial function
00:50 - multiply 3 so we make x
00:53 - free so then we're going to print a
00:56 - triple
00:56 - two so we fill out one in the variable
01:00 - one parameter in the variable and the
01:02 - other variable
01:03 - i mean the other other parameter
01:05 - parameter
01:06 - in the print so now we'll save it
01:10 - and right so that's six because three
01:14 - times two is six
01:16 - then we're gonna do example two we're
01:18 - gonna define
01:19 - get cakes there are four parameters a b
01:22 - c and d so we're gonna return
01:25 - a plus b plus c plus d so we're going to
01:28 - add four numbers in this function
01:30 - so when we do a variable called get
01:32 - cakes for all
01:34 - equals partial get kicks one one so we
01:37 - here we fill out
01:38 - the a and b parameters into one and one
01:42 - then we're gonna do print get cakes for
01:44 - all two and three so we make
01:46 - c two and d three so
01:49 - here we're gonna add one plus one plus
01:52 - two plus three
01:54 - now i'm gonna say so did seven
01:58 - one plus one plus two plus three equals
02:01 - seven
02:01 - okay then for example three we're going
02:04 - to find
02:04 - get cakes a b c d so this is the same
02:07 - function
02:08 - so we're gonna get case for all variable
02:10 - again and equals partial their case
02:13 - a equals one and b equals one so here we
02:16 - specify
02:17 - which parameter we want to one and one
02:20 - then we're going to print get case for
02:22 - all b
02:23 - equals two so here we override the b in
02:26 - here which is supposed to be one
02:28 - and we override it into two and then we
02:30 - also do the c
02:31 - into three and d into four so here we're
02:34 - adding one plus two plus three plus four
02:37 - so now i'm gonna save it and so i did
02:41 - ten
02:41 - let's see one plus two is three three
02:43 - plus four equals six
02:44 - and six plus four equals ten that's
02:47 - correct
02:48 - well that was fun and that's it for
02:51 - today
02:51 - thank you for watching remember to smash

welcome to getting with kids my name is clea and my name is andrew today we are going to teach you python so today we want to learn about partial functions so partial functions will turn your a function with x parameters into a function with less parameters so first we're going to do from func tools we're going to import the partial then we'll do example one def which is defined multiply and there are two parameters x and y return x star y so star is basically the multiplication symbol so here you enter two numbers and then the function will multiply the two numbers and then it will give you the answer so now going to make a variable called triple equals partial so we're going to use the partial function multiply 3 so we make x free so then we're going to print a triple two so we fill out one in the variable one parameter in the variable and the other variable i mean the other other parameter parameter in the print so now we'll save it and right so that's six because three times two is six then we're gonna do example two we're gonna define get cakes there are four parameters a b c and d so we're gonna return a plus b plus c plus d so we're going to add four numbers in this function so when we do a variable called get cakes for all equals partial get kicks one one so we here we fill out the a and b parameters into one and one then we're gonna do print get cakes for all two and three so we make c two and d three so here we're gonna add one plus one plus two plus three now i'm gonna say so did seven one plus one plus two plus three equals seven okay then for example three we're going to find get cakes a b c d so this is the same function so we're gonna get case for all variable again and equals partial their case a equals one and b equals one so here we specify which parameter we want to one and one then we're going to print get case for all b equals two so here we override the b in here which is supposed to be one and we override it into two and then we also do the c into three and d into four so here we're adding one plus two plus three plus four so now i'm gonna save it and so i did ten let's see one plus two is three three plus four equals six and six plus four equals ten that's correct well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
