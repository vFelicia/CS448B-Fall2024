00:00 - [Music]
00:00 - welcome to coding with kids
00:03 - my name is andrew today we're at
00:05 - minecraft education
00:06 - so we're on python 101 and lesson five
00:09 - so we're going to talk to the ceo
00:11 - so the ceo says hi again since you have
00:14 - been on such helpful
00:15 - company i want to show you our newest
00:17 - creation a robot
00:18 - companion called the agent the agent can
00:21 - be controlled with code and can help
00:22 - people
00:23 - in every part of day-to-day life it can
00:26 - help you around the house network
00:28 - down here we are testing the agent to
00:29 - help out so let's see what this lever
00:32 - does
00:33 - switch oh there are lots of agents
00:36 - and this one's the agent yes
00:40 - hi inject the agent says hot i'm the
00:42 - agent and i'll be your helper and
00:44 - companion throughout this journey
00:46 - can you help code me to become smarter
00:48 - so i'm going to help the agent to become
00:50 - smarter okay good now we're going to
00:53 - talk to
00:54 - the developer so the developer says hi
00:57 - would it be possible to get your help
00:59 - i need to write some code that will move
01:00 - the bars from one side to the other
01:02 - this will greatly help people who can't
01:04 - move heavy objects that easily
01:06 - but i cannot seem to make the agent move
01:08 - correctly could you write some code
01:11 - some code to help me with this so i'm
01:13 - gonna
01:15 - help the help her get the agent to get
01:19 - borrows and put the bar on the piston
01:22 - okay so in part one write some code so
01:26 - that the agent will pick up
01:28 - the box and move six blocks forward and
01:30 - place it four
01:31 - so first we're gonna do agent duh
01:36 - collect all so we'll collect everything
01:39 - everything around it okay next we're
01:42 - gonna do
01:42 - asian dot move forward
01:47 - six times okay so go to the pis
01:50 - uh the block before the piston then
01:53 - agent place
01:55 - forward okay
01:58 - place four to place the barrel i picked
02:01 - up on the piston so now let's run
02:04 - okay hey takes a long ball and puts it
02:07 - on the piston
02:08 - now i'm gonna go to part two okay so now
02:12 - it's a little different okay so
02:15 - part two at the same cost i had the
02:17 - agent goes back to the starting point
02:19 - it needs to do the same thing but four
02:21 - times use a for loop at the beginning
02:23 - the boxes will auto
02:25 - be automatically stacked okay so
02:28 - we're all doing all this tap tap it
02:31 - needs to put it on inside the loop so
02:34 - i'm gonna do four
02:35 - i in oops for i
02:38 - and range repeat four times because
02:42 - there will be four
02:44 - more times um do after the asian.place
02:48 - forward
02:49 - i'm going to do agent dot move
02:53 - and do backward how many times
02:57 - six so go back to the beginning because
02:59 - the agent that collect all
03:01 - will only collect one bar at a time okay
03:04 - okay okay so the piston lifted out
03:09 - left the bars out so the agent will have
03:12 - enough space to put the bottle okay
03:16 - now we're gonna go to activity 2.
03:19 - so now we're going to talk to the tester
03:22 - so the tester
03:23 - says could i ask for your help i've been
03:25 - testing the agent and i
03:26 - found that if it spins left 20 times
03:29 - that's when your clothes get clean
03:30 - however i can't get the program to work
03:33 - could you write some code so that
03:35 - will some code that will make the agent
03:38 - go into the machine
03:39 - spin around left 20 times then go out
03:42 - okay so first let me go here so this is
03:45 - the pretend
03:46 - wash machine and agent nissa get the
03:49 - lever
03:50 - chest plate which is basically the
03:52 - clothes that you clean
03:54 - spin around here to clean and close and
03:56 - then go back
03:58 - okay so part one
04:02 - waste them code so that the agent will
04:03 - pick up the dirty laundry
04:05 - move forward into the machine spin left
04:08 - 20 times and then get out of the machine
04:10 - to place the clean laundry on the other
04:11 - side of where the dirty laundry was
04:13 - so we have a code agent.collector doll
04:16 - you can download for it seven times and
04:19 - agent that drop all four
04:21 - so first i'm gonna do for i1
04:25 - and range from
04:28 - how many times 20
04:32 - 20 times because you need to spend 20
04:34 - times
04:35 - then we're gonna do asian dot
04:38 - turn left
04:42 - left okay
04:46 - then we're going to do a change
04:49 - dot collect
04:54 - [Music]
05:16 - [Music]
05:22 - how about this is this in the loop let's
05:24 - see no okay
05:26 - i'm going to do agent dot move
05:29 - back seven times oops
05:35 - [Music]
05:36 - back seven
05:38 - times so go back to the beginning and
05:41 - then
05:42 - agent dot drop
05:48 - left
05:53 - okay
05:56 - [Music]
05:57 - oh drop underscore all
06:01 - so drop all the clean clothes left okay
06:04 - so now let's right
06:07 - now it's spinning okay now this
06:10 - is enchanted so it's so critically
06:12 - cleaned
06:14 - now let me go here okay
06:18 - part two out of the same coast that the
06:21 - h
06:21 - does the same thing but for free loads
06:23 - of laundry do this by using for loop
06:25 - before all
06:26 - the other code so we are gonna
06:29 - do all this do a tab because we're going
06:33 - to do it in the loop
06:34 - all right you enter so for
06:40 - oh there's no this
06:44 - tab okay you're gonna
06:48 - do four i two two
06:51 - in range repeat three times
06:55 - so we'll do three loads of laundry is
06:57 - that correct okay now that's one
06:59 - okay let's go let's go
07:02 - clean agent okay so now the cleaning
07:05 - chest plate now needs to clean the boots
07:08 - okay he loses cleaning yeah i think now
07:12 - i think it's pants he has pants
07:16 - yay so now there's armor okay
07:19 - this is complete let's go to activity
07:21 - three
07:22 - they're carpets so we're gonna talk to
07:25 - the
07:26 - programmer so the programmer says sorry
07:28 - to bother you could i get your help
07:30 - i'm trying to make the agent vacuum dirt
07:32 - awesome carpets
07:33 - but i can't seem to get the agent to
07:35 - vacuum the whole carpet
07:36 - it just goes over a small part could you
07:38 - write some code that will make the
07:40 - legion vacuum the whole carpet
07:42 - okay so okay so
07:45 - i think the seeds are the dirt because
07:48 - they look pretty
07:49 - like dirt okay the agent needs to clean
07:53 - the carpet
07:55 - so part one write some coats so that the
07:57 - agent will go over
07:58 - every block small carpet and pick up the
08:00 - dirt
08:01 - so first there is agent dot collect all
08:04 - agent dot move forward one and agent
08:07 - move right one okay
08:11 - so first over here we are going to do
08:14 - for
08:14 - i1 and range
08:19 - okay we're going to do it seven times
08:24 - so we're going to put these two
08:28 - lines inside that over here
08:31 - okay then for i to arrange
08:39 - we are going to do it also seven
08:42 - times okay
08:46 - then we're gonna do tab
08:49 - agent dot collect
08:52 - all so collect all the seeds around it
08:56 - then you're going to do agent
09:00 - dot move
09:04 - back yeah
09:07 - that's it okay go back
09:12 - one time
09:16 - then go and do occasion
09:20 - dot okay
09:24 - so now we are gonna run it
09:28 - okay yay
09:31 - that's how it goes through the whole
09:32 - carpet so i clean up all the
09:34 - seeds also called dirt okay now we are
09:38 - going to help clean a
09:39 - bigger carpet so part two
09:42 - is the same kill said the agent does the
09:44 - same thing before the larger carpet
09:47 - do this by repeating the code three
09:48 - times using a full loop
09:50 - at the end try to make the asian drop
09:52 - all the dirt
09:53 - in the trash to its way so first
09:57 - we are gonna do
10:01 - here the four three in range
10:05 - [Music]
10:06 - okay how many times three times
10:10 - three times okay
10:14 - then you're gonna move
10:18 - this tab okay so now we're gonna need
10:22 - part two
10:23 - [Music]
10:26 - make the agent move right so we're gonna
10:27 - do agent
10:30 - dot move
10:34 - right one
10:37 - one okay that's the end
10:40 - third loop
10:43 - then we're going to do asian
10:46 - don't drop all
10:50 - right so drop all to the trash can
10:54 - over there in the agent that move right
10:57 - it is already end of loop two so we
11:00 - don't need the first
11:02 - attack because it's not endo
11:06 - for eye to rearrange okay so now we're
11:09 - not
11:18 - one more seed yay clean it but it's not
11:22 - gonna go over the whole carpet
11:24 - okay so throw all the seeds in the trash
11:27 - rockets i have the fruit all
11:30 - the seeds here right and then the trash
11:32 - can
11:33 - so called trash okay okay okay so now
11:37 - you're gonna join the elevator
11:41 - okay so now we're back at the start well
11:43 - that was fun
11:45 - and that's it for today thank you for
11:47 - watching
11:48 - remember to smash the like button and

11:51 - bye bye

welcome to coding with kids my name is andrew today we're at minecraft education so we're on python 101 and lesson five so we're going to talk to the ceo so the ceo says hi again since you have been on such helpful company i want to show you our newest creation a robot companion called the agent the agent can be controlled with code and can help people in every part of daytoday life it can help

we're all doing all this tap tap it needs to put it on inside the loop so i'm gonna do four i in oops for i and range repeat four times because there will be four more times um do after the asian.place forward i'm going to do agent dot move and do backward how many times six so go back to the beginning because the agent that collect all will only collect one bar at a time okay okay okay so the piston lifted out left the bars out so the agent will have enough space to put the bottle okay now we're gonna go to activity 2. so now we're going to talk to the tester so the tester says could i ask for your help i've been testing the agent and i found that if it spins left 20 times that's when your clothes get clean however i can't get the program to work could you write some code so that will some code that will make the agent go into the machine spin around left 20 times then go out okay so first let me go here so this is the pretend wash machine and agent nissa get the lever chest plate which is basically the clothes that you clean spin around here to clean and close and then go back okay so part one waste them code so that the agent will pick up the dirty laundry move

left left okay then we're going to do a change dot collect how about this is this in the loop let's see no okay i'm going to do agent dot move back seven times oops back seven times so go back to the beginning and then agent dot drop left okay oh drop underscore all so drop all the clean clothes left okay so now let's right now it's spinning okay now this is enchanted so it's so critically cleaned now let me go here okay part two out of the same coast that the h does the same thing but for free loads of laundry do this by using for loop before all the other code so we are gonna do all this do a tab because we're going to do it in the loop all right you enter so for oh there's no this tab okay you're gonna do four i two two in range repeat three times so we'll do three loads of laundry is that correct okay now that's one okay let's go let's go clean agent okay so now the cleaning chest plate now needs to clean the boots okay he loses cleaning yeah i think now i think it's pants he has pants yay so now there's armor okay this is complete let's go to activity three they're carpets so we're gonna talk to the programmer so the programmer says sorry to bother you could i get your help i'm trying to make the agent vacuum dirt awesome carpets but i can't seem to get the agent to vacuum the whole carpet it just goes over a small part could you write some code that will make the legion vacuum the whole carpet okay so okay so i think the seeds are the dirt because they look pretty like dirt okay the agent needs to clean the carpet so part one write some coats so that the agent will go over every block small carpet and pick up the dirt so first there is agent dot collect all agent dot move forward one and agent move right one okay so first over here we are going to do for i1 and range okay we're going to do it seven times so we're going to put these two lines inside that over here okay then for i to arrange we are going to do it also seven times okay then we're gonna do tab agent dot collect all so collect all the seeds around it then you're going to do agent dot move back yeah that's it okay go back one time then go and do occasion dot okay so now we are gonna run it okay yay that's how it goes through the whole carpet so i clean up all the seeds also called dirt okay now we are going to help clean a bigger carpet so part two is the same kill said the agent does the same thing before the larger carpet do this by repeating the code three times using a full loop at the end try to make the asian drop all the dirt in the trash to its way so first we are gonna do here the four three in range okay how many times three times three times okay then you're gonna move this tab okay so now we're gonna need part two make the agent move right so we're gonna do agent dot move right one one okay that's the end third loop then we're going to do asian don't drop all right so drop all to the trash can over there in the agent that move right it is already end of loop two so we don't need the first attack because it's not endo for eye to rearrange okay so now we're not one more seed yay clean it but it's not gonna go over the whole carpet okay so throw all the seeds in the trash rockets i have the fruit all the seeds here right and then the trash can so called trash okay okay okay so now you're gonna join the elevator okay so now we're back at the start well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
