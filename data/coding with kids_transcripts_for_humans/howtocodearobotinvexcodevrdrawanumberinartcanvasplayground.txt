00:00 - welcome to cutting with kids
00:03 - my name is kalia and my name is andy
00:05 - today we're in fix code
00:07 - and today we're gonna draw a number
00:10 - i think we should draw number eight do
00:13 - you agree andrew
00:14 - yes because it's your age okay
00:17 - let's first
00:21 - move robot pen down so we can start
00:23 - drawing
00:24 - then set robot color to
00:28 - blue because it's my favorite color then
00:31 - repeat four times
00:32 - to first mix a square because eight has
00:36 - two squares oopsies
00:41 - repeat four times
00:48 - move forward for 900 millimeters
00:53 - 900 millimeters
00:56 - and turn right for 90 degrees turn
01:00 - right 90 degrees
01:03 - okay then let's see what it does
01:10 - it will draw a square first
01:17 - turn let's press run
01:25 - okay it's going forward for 900
01:27 - millimeters
01:31 - now it turns right 90 degrees
01:34 - then go 404 um 900 millimeters again
01:41 - because it's a repeat four times it
01:44 - repeats
01:45 - four times to make a square
01:49 - now last time
01:55 - now we start this is the starting
01:58 - position
01:59 - now we need to make another square
02:04 - but right here maybe you can turn and go
02:07 - dead
02:09 - i have a more simple idea you can
02:13 - reverse because you can drive reverse
02:16 - let's repeat it three times let's
02:20 - drive four four
02:23 - no reverse for 900 millimeters
02:27 - reverse for 900 millimeters
02:33 - then turn left for 90 degrees
02:37 - turn left 90 degrees
02:40 - let's run it
02:44 - so first it will draw one square
02:48 - then it will reverse so it will go
02:52 - backwards then turn that for 90 degrees
02:55 - then repeat it for three times let's see
02:59 - if it works
03:02 - okay it's going forward to make
03:07 - the first square
03:11 - turn 90 degrees
03:14 - go forward for 900 millimeters
03:20 - turn 90 degrees again
03:26 - repeat that four times to make a square
03:34 - then from the starting position we go
03:36 - reverse
03:39 - turn left 90 degrees go backwards again
03:44 - turn left 90 degrees and go backwards
03:47 - again
03:48 - we don't need um repeat four times
03:52 - because if it repeats it will just draw
03:54 - the same thing so it's like
03:56 - drawing nothing and thanks for watching
03:59 - remember to
04:01 - smash them up and subscribe
04:04 - bye bye bye
