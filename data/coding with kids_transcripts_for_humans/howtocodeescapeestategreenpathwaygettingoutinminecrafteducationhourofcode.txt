00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia mine is Andrew today we're in
00:05 - timecraft in Minecraft education Edition
00:07 - so in the last video we went out the
00:10 - chest room and then now we found that
00:12 - the time Bots are bad guys they have
00:15 - been in this prison and they're gonna
00:17 - use that portal to get away and get out
00:20 - of this prison so we have these cannons
00:23 - that can like destroy or do something to
00:25 - the portal so that the robots can't go
00:28 - through
00:28 - so now only I use code to uh
00:32 - fire the cannon like defeat the robots
00:35 - the time agents are underneath the time
00:38 - War they have used their powers to
00:39 - create protective colored rings around
00:41 - it use the activate Canon function to
00:44 - activate the color cannons in the same
00:46 - order as the colored rings to disable
00:48 - the timer so there's blue yellow megana
00:51 - and green magenta magenta okay so
00:54 - there's an example activ blue and then
00:56 - yellow let's see what it does okay so
00:59 - there are blue Rings right oh look the
01:02 - blue one it's
01:04 - oh another blue ring disappeared
01:07 - and now the blue robot yellow it doesn't
01:11 - work because there's a green ring that's
01:13 - outside so when the ring is disappear
01:16 - they fall and then they they're like
01:19 - knocked out so we did like um blue so
01:22 - the blue Time by Banshee went down okay
01:26 - so first we need to do blue and then
01:29 - green almost blocking the yellow Cannon
01:31 - so then when you do green yellow and
01:33 - then magenta because those are the our
01:36 - order of the biggest and smallest Rings
01:38 - okay so now let's go coding
01:42 - and we're gonna do so it's blue and then
01:45 - we're gonna have to do yellow
01:48 - foreign
01:54 - so we're gonna do yellow and then we're
01:58 - gonna do
02:01 - oh wait we have to do green then yellow
02:04 - right oh yeah you're green and then
02:07 - yellow
02:11 - so
02:14 - so we are gonna do green
02:17 - and then yellow
02:20 - the magenta
02:26 - do you spell Canada over here
02:29 - okay you did two okay then magenta
02:35 - let's run it

03:06 - disappeared oh now we're going
03:10 - past the Box
03:12 - oh now there's a weird spirit
03:17 - teleporting
03:20 - the robots teleported away or they got
03:23 - destroyed you did it you really stuck it
03:26 - to those time agents or should I say you
03:28 - really stuck to his hot tight those
03:31 - agents to this time haha sorry I'm still

03:36 - time agents will remain here to think
03:38 - about what they have done as for you
03:40 - come with me I'll show you the way out
03:42 - let's go
03:44 - no no
03:47 - congratulations your coding skills saved
03:49 - the day again who knows what trouble the
03:51 - time agents would have stirred up if
03:53 - they had escaped the estate well done
03:55 - there's still one question I have those
03:58 - diary Pages where do you think they came
04:00 - from
