00:01 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:04 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we are
00:06 - Minecraft education Edition and we're in
00:08 - an escape estate so in the last video we
00:11 - completed the Green Path of Escape
00:13 - estate so now we're gonna head on to the
00:15 - yellow path Minecraft presents so we're
00:19 - starting from all the way in the start
00:21 - Escape
00:23 - so now we're in this creepy place again
00:25 - forest look it's our
00:28 - kids are it looks different
00:31 - maybe is it a continuation no it's a the
00:35 - same thing
00:39 - so we're gonna just skip the tutorial if
00:41 - you want that tutorial you can go to our
00:43 - first video of Escape SD to do the
00:46 - tutorial so the tutorial is basically
00:48 - just the controls of Minecraft yeah okay
00:51 - so we're gonna skip the tutorial
00:52 - [Music]
00:54 - Dr brickowski hello I am Dr Dodge
00:58 - bragowski I see you've received my
01:00 - engine invitation do you think you have
01:03 - what it takes to Escape the Mansion by
01:06 - Dawn and claim the one million emeralds
01:08 - excellent now head to the front door to
01:10 - begin your challenge let's go the doctor
01:13 - looks weird yeah
01:16 - okay his body is so involved and big
01:19 - that's that's okay he looks it's
01:22 - grumbling
01:24 - oh no we got swallowed so now we have a
01:28 - book such room for particles
01:36 - hello is someone there oh my a human do
01:40 - you think you could help me I can't seem
01:42 - to open this door floor of it I think my
01:44 - code may be broken do you think you
01:46 - could take a look and see what's wrong
01:47 - with it
01:48 - can you try to get the agent out of the
01:50 - trapdoor so blocks is best from
01:53 - Beginnings but we're gonna choose python
01:57 - um to code to help the agent
02:00 - so okay first see that cursor on over
02:03 - there on the floor it needs to move
02:05 - forward free box to reach the trapdoor
02:07 - but it isn't working press C to view the
02:10 - code okay
02:12 - so this is a cursor it needs to go to
02:14 - the trapdoor and openness so the agent
02:16 - can come out okay so let's go to code
02:20 - okay so we just need to move forward
02:23 - three times in an open trapdoor so we
02:26 - already did this in the first video so
02:29 - first there's already two move cursors
02:31 - but we need to move it three time so we
02:34 - need to add one more
02:36 - so we're gonna do this copy so move to
02:39 - our search and then orange so
02:45 - orange so it will re reach the trapdoor
02:49 - and then there's the open chapter
02:50 - function so I'll open the trap door
02:53 - okay great it's open that's strange I
02:56 - still can't seem to get out can check
02:58 - the code again and make sure I'm moving
03:00 - up two blocks so we open the tractor but
03:02 - the agent still can't get out so now
03:03 - when you have a program the agent to
03:05 - come out okay
03:07 - so so there are agent that moves but
03:10 - then there are forward bath left right
03:13 - up and down so we the agent to move up
03:16 - so we just need to move it one more time
03:18 - because everybody has agent move up one
03:20 - time so agent dot move up so now I will
03:24 - move up two blocks and get one to the
03:26 - trap door thank you you fixed my code
03:28 - now I'm in range to open the green door
03:30 - for you but we're already completed the
03:32 - Green Path the path Behind the Green
03:34 - Door is an easier one you can take that
03:36 - path or talk to me again if you want to
03:38 - try opening the yellow door so we're
03:40 - gonna try to open the yellow door so
03:41 - we're gonna talk to the agent
03:44 - so you want to try opening the yellow
03:46 - door for that I'll need more power
03:48 - luckily I can charge off
03:51 - of moonlight all we had to do was open
03:54 - the Scarlet above huh my code isn't
03:56 - working right now but working right try
03:59 - checking my code to make sure that all
04:01 - four chapters in the ceiling are opening
04:03 - oh there are trap doors now we need to
04:06 - use the cursor on the roof to open the
04:09 - trapdoor so the agent can get Moonlight
04:11 - energy okay
04:15 - so these are the we can move orange
04:18 - which is forward move the cursor forward
04:21 - to move it back blue to move it left and
04:24 - yellow to move it right so we're just
04:26 - gonna go do this code example to see
04:28 - what it does so the Open chat or yellow
04:31 - yellow yellow
04:32 - so it first opened the first trapdoor
04:34 - okay so now we need to open all four of
04:37 - those trap doors
04:40 - so we can use a loop for Iron Range to
04:43 - repeat the same code except like in the
04:46 - shorter term repeating the same coat
04:49 - open tracker it does the same thing
04:52 - okay back to coding so now
04:55 - it open traps to remove yellow cursor
04:58 - cursor let's see what this does it's
05:00 - different so open
05:02 - okay so before we do move cursor orange
05:06 - we're gonna open the trapdoor
05:14 - the orange two times again yeah so
05:18 - if you want to do something two times
05:20 - it's basically the loop so you can use
05:24 - either way so then we're gonna open
05:26 - trapdoor again
05:28 - let's see what this does okay
05:31 - okay it opens the first one opens the
05:33 - second one open the third one so now we
05:35 - need to go Blue two times and then open
05:37 - trapdoor function
05:39 - so
05:41 - do move cursor
05:45 - blue blue two times
05:53 - and then we're gonna do a trapdoor
05:58 - trap door
05:59 - if now this should work and open all the
06:01 - tractors
06:05 - two three four puzzle solved so now it's
06:12 - a bunch of electricity
06:13 - energy well way to go I've opened the
06:17 - yellow door for you now head through if
06:20 - you like or if you really want a
06:22 - challenge talk with me again to try
06:24 - opening the red door but next video
06:27 - we're gonna go through the yellow door
06:30 - seems the same mysterious as the Green
06:32 - Door it's just like more yellow goes to
06:35 - a different room than the Green Door
06:37 - yeah because it says the green was the
06:39 - easiest and the yellow I think is the
06:41 - medium and then the red over here is the
06:45 - hardest iron blocks gardening yeah it
06:47 - looks hard so in the next video we're
06:50 - gonna go in but for now we're just gonna
06:52 - stay and look at this mysterious portal
06:55 - well that was fun and that's it for
06:58 - today thank you for watching Remember to
