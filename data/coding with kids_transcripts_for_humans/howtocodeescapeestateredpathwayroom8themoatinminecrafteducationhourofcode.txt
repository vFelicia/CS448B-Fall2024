00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in
00:05 - mft education Edition in the hour of
00:07 - code Escape estate so in the last video
00:09 - we opened the red door and now we're
00:11 - going to go through let's
00:13 - go loading it's the NPC
00:17 - NPC bye bye okay agent wait before you
00:21 - go I need to tell you one last thing
00:23 - this house is filled with Escape rooms
00:25 - you need to find clu solve puzzles and
00:27 - fix code to make your way out press C to
00:29 - reveal puzz the code run the code to see
00:31 - what happens if there are errors fix the
00:33 - code and run it again to test it that is
00:35 - called
00:38 - debugging sometimes Solutions won't be
00:40 - clear and not all puzzles take code to
00:42 - solve when you find a puzzle remember to
00:44 - run the code first to see what's wrong
00:47 - that the bug and fix the faulty code
00:49 - it's much easier than writing code from
00:51 - scratch keep an eye out for Clues such
00:53 - as particles to help you guide you okay
00:57 - let's go let's search room for particles
01:00 - right there right
01:03 - [Music]
01:04 - here a it's a it's a ender he has
01:09 - diamonds
01:11 - at okay let's see to see what we have to
01:14 - do draw a bridge the Enderman B needs
01:16 - your directions to get across the river
01:18 - please direct them to use their magic to
01:20 - teleport to the diamond block then have
01:22 - them move forward then move into
01:25 - position to pull the leather to let down
01:26 - the drop Bridge use a Teleport Enderman
01:29 - to Diamond function to get the Enderman
01:31 - across the river then use move Enderman
01:33 - forward function to position the
01:35 - Enderman in front of the lever and pull
01:37 - lever down function to pull the lever
01:39 - the Enderman Butler will automatically
01:41 - turn to face the lever when it's in the
01:42 - correct position so let's see the code
01:45 - example it moves the butler forward two
01:47 - times and oh it can't go touch the water
01:51 - so there's the diamond block right there
01:53 - and it has diamonds over here that means
01:54 - I can teleport so let's see what we have
01:56 - to do
01:58 - first let's see this this
02:01 - one okay it can't go into water so it
02:04 - can't move forward two times so let's
02:06 - see what happens if we don't move
02:09 - forward two
02:13 - times you still have move
02:18 - forward it's
02:20 - teleport okay move one extra step yeah
02:24 - oh still flip the switch S oh that was
02:29 - debugging the code okay so now we can go
02:32 - across the
02:34 - drawbridge thank you BL oh it can
02:39 - move oh hi Butler inside here we have a
02:43 - maze okay search room for
02:48 - particles it opened the
02:50 - door so iron doors can only be opened
02:53 - with lovers okay so let's see let's try
02:56 - to open all the CCT door okay so there's
02:59 - a the first purple one so let's
03:03 - try that but then we have to open all
03:06 - the doors and use code to move it
03:08 - forward have to open certain doors yeah
03:11 - so yellow and
03:15 - blue and then we have to switch the
03:17 - yellow one and then we have to switch
03:18 - the blue one so let's see code
03:23 - first maze direct the Enderman Butler to
03:26 - the emerald blocks on the other side of
03:28 - the maze the lover on the walls seem to
03:30 - have a color that matches a set of
03:31 - doorways in the midst you should flip
03:34 - these levers to create a safe pth path
03:36 - to direct the end Butler through to the
03:38 - emerald blocks they use the move
03:40 - Enderman direction direction function to
03:43 - help na navigate them through the mze
03:46 - okay so you can move it forward back
03:48 - left and right okay let's
03:50 - [Music]
03:53 - see switch oh you can't switch it it's a
03:57 - a correct path okay so we could go to
04:02 - open the blue yeah but the yellow blue
04:06 - okay let's still the blue
04:08 - one okay so this is a correct path you
04:13 - can go through the pink green pink and
04:15 - then blue okay so let's see we have to
04:18 - move for one two three four five times
04:22 - then move right one two three so move
04:25 - forward five times is first you can also
04:28 - use a repeat
04:33 - so we're going to do four I in
04:38 - range five
04:43 - times move forward
04:47 - forward and then for I in
04:52 - range three
04:55 - times we're going to
04:58 - move
05:03 - Ender spelled it wrong
05:09 - oops
05:13 - Enderman
05:18 - direction we're going to move right so
05:20 - let's
05:26 - see okay in the middle and then it goes
05:29 - across so now going reach the Pink Door
05:31 - so we have to move it one two three 4
05:35 - let's see so it's over here
05:38 - one two three four and then left three
05:42 - times so move
05:45 - forward again for four
05:54 - times
05:56 - move
05:58 - Enderman
06:07 - Direction
06:09 - forward
06:12 - oops and then left three
06:25 - times move
06:28 - under
06:31 - Enderman
06:33 - [Music]
06:36 - Direction left okay so let's test
06:43 - this
06:45 - okay
06:48 - go okay now it has to move for one 2
06:52 - three four four
06:58 - times
07:01 - four
07:03 - times do
07:05 - move
07:08 - direction
07:10 - for now we're going run the
07:14 - [Music]
07:16 - cook okay Butler goes through okay we
07:22 - got it puzzle saw so now it's super big
07:25 - but it still went through now it's com
07:28 - back out
07:30 - okay let's see here ooh
07:35 - light
07:37 - nothing he's putting the lights back on
07:40 - okay let's
07:42 - see there seems to be a pattern with the
07:45 - way the lights are flashing move the
07:46 - Enderman to each position following the
07:49 - pattern the light are making use the
07:50 - move Ender function to choose which
07:53 - color platform to the Enderman moves to
07:56 - so there's green yellow blue and pink so
07:58 - let's see the the code which is green
08:01 - then yellow
08:03 - green then yellow and that is wrong so
08:06 - let's see the
08:07 - pattern okay so it's first yellow then
08:14 - green yellow
08:17 - green okay so let's try that yellow then
08:21 - green so change this
08:25 - to yellow and then green
08:31 - now it should fix the
08:35 - lights okay now we have another part to
08:38 - do you have to do it again so blue green
08:42 - pink blue green and pink okay so let's
08:46 - do that again
08:48 - blue oh Green's right then move end Pink
08:54 - So now let's run it and it should get
08:55 - the second pattern
08:57 - blue green
09:00 - then
09:01 - pink okay now we have the last part so
09:04 - it's
09:05 - green
09:07 - yellow pink blue so green yellow pink
09:14 - blue
09:16 - green yellow pink wait it's pink it's go
09:24 - yellow and then
09:28 - blue
09:30 - blue okay
09:33 - go
09:35 - green
09:37 - yellow pink and then
09:40 - blue okay that's so soft no lights are
09:45 - disappearing and there's an portal to
09:48 - the next room so in the next video we're
09:50 - going to enter say bye to the butler
09:51 - next time hi
09:53 - Butler okay well that was fun and that's
09:56 - it for today thank you for watching
09:58 - Remember smash the like button and

welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in mft education Edition in the hour of code Escape estate so in the last video we opened the red door and now we're going to go through let's go loading it's the NPC NPC bye bye okay agent wait before you go I need to tell you one last thing this house is filled with Escape rooms you need to find clu solve puzzles and fix code to make your way out press C to reveal puzz the code run the code to see what happens if there are errors fix the code and run it again to test it that is called debugging sometimes Solutions won't be clear and not all puzzles take code to solve when you find a puzzle remember to run the code first to see what's wrong that the bug and fix the faulty code it's much easier than writing code from scratch keep an eye out for Clues such as particles to help you guide you okay let's go let's search room for particles right there right here a it's a it's a ender he has diamonds at okay let's see to see what we have to do draw a bridge the Enderman B needs your directions to get across the river please direct them to use their magic to teleport to the diamond block then have them move forward then move into position to pull the leather to let down the drop Bridge use a Teleport Enderman to Diamond function to get the Enderman across the river then use move Enderman forward function to position the Enderman in front of the lever and pull lever down function to pull the lever the Enderman Butler will automatically turn to face the lever when it's in the correct position so let's see the code example it moves the butler forward two times and oh it can't go touch the water so there's the diamond block right there and it has diamonds over here that means I can teleport so let's see what we have to do first let's see this this one okay it can't go into water so it can't move forward two times so let's see what happens if we don't move forward two times you still have move forward it's teleport okay move one extra step yeah oh still flip the switch S oh that was debugging the code okay so now we can go across the drawbridge thank you BL oh it can move oh hi Butler inside here we have a maze okay search room for particles it opened the door so iron doors can only be opened with lovers okay so let's see let's try to open all the CCT door okay so there's a the first purple one so let's try that but then we have to open all the doors and use code to move it forward have to open certain doors yeah so yellow and blue and then we have to switch the yellow one and then we have to switch the blue one so let's see code first maze direct the Enderman Butler to the emerald blocks on the other side of the maze the lover on the walls seem to have a color that matches a set of doorways in the midst you should flip these levers to create a safe pth path to direct the end Butler through to the emerald blocks they use the move Enderman direction direction function to help na navigate them through the mze okay so you can move it forward back left and right okay let's see switch oh you can't switch it it's a a correct path okay so we could go to open the blue yeah but the yellow blue okay let's still the blue one okay so this is a correct path you can go through the pink green pink and then blue okay so let's see we have to move for one two three four five times then move right one two three so move forward five times is first you can also use a repeat so we're going to do four I in range five times move forward forward and then for I in range three times we're going to move Ender spelled it wrong oops Enderman direction we're going to move right so let's see okay in the middle and then it goes across so now going reach the Pink Door so we have to move it one two three 4 let's see so it's over here one two three four and then left three times so move forward again for four times move Enderman Direction forward oops and then left three times move under Enderman Direction left okay so let's test this okay go okay now it has to move for one 2 three four four times four times do move direction for now we're going run the cook okay Butler goes through okay we got it puzzle saw so now it's super big but it still went through now it's com back out okay let's see here ooh light nothing he's putting the lights back on okay let's see there seems to be a pattern with the way the lights are flashing move the Enderman to each position following the pattern the light are making use the move Ender function to choose which color platform to the Enderman moves to so there's green yellow blue and pink so let's see the the code which is green then yellow green then yellow and that is wrong so let's see the pattern okay so it's first yellow then green yellow green okay so let's try that yellow then green so change this to yellow and then green now it should fix the lights okay now we have another part to do you have to do it again so blue green pink blue green and pink okay so let's do that again blue oh Green's right then move end Pink So now let's run it and it should get the second pattern blue green then pink okay now we have the last part so it's green yellow pink blue so green yellow pink blue green yellow pink wait it's pink it's go yellow and then blue blue okay go green yellow pink and then blue okay that's so soft no lights are disappearing and there's an portal to the next room so in the next video we're going to enter say bye to the butler next time hi Butler okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember smash the like button and subscribe byebye
