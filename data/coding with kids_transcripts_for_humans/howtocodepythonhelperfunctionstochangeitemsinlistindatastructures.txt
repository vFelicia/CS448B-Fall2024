00:00 - welcome to
00:01 - cutting with kids my name is kalia and
00:04 - my name is andrew today we're going to
00:06 - show you python today we're going to
00:08 - learn about python list helper functions
00:10 - every item in the list is separated by
00:13 - commas so each color is a item
00:17 - so in another video we learned about
00:19 - python lists
00:20 - so after we do the list we're going to
00:22 - do print colors because we're going to
00:24 - use the helper functions list helper
00:27 - functions to change the list so when you
00:29 - print it to see how it changed so first
00:31 - i'm going to print colors
00:34 - like this push the square
00:36 - brackets
00:37 - yeah with the square brackets and the
00:40 - columns next i'm going to do color which
00:42 - is a variable equals colors which is the
00:45 - list so
00:46 - their names is very
00:48 - similar but this does not have the s
00:52 - equals colors dot pop zero so pop is a
00:56 - python list helper function that will
00:58 - remove an item using its index number so
01:02 - the first item is always zero yeah so
01:05 - it's index number zero so red is zero so
01:07 - we're going to remove red
01:09 - so the last item is whatever number it
01:12 - is so yellow is one orange is two and it
01:15 - keeps going off so purple can be
01:17 - negative one and you can also fro count
01:20 - from the back to the front so here we're
01:22 - gonna pop
01:24 - zero so color is red now
01:28 - now you're going to print popped
01:30 - red because here it removed red and
01:34 - color is red
01:36 - then we're going to print the new list
01:38 - colors let's do
01:40 - control s to save it and go to the
01:42 - terminal and type p y list dot p y so
01:46 - did the original list then popped red
01:49 - and then it did yellow orange green blue
01:51 - and purple so first out red first it
01:54 - print the pass then it say pop thread
01:58 - then it print
02:00 - the new list without read bye-bye
02:04 - so next we're gonna keep using our
02:06 - colors list so we're going to always use
02:08 - the colors let's throughout all our
02:10 - programs today next we're going to print
02:12 - colors again print original then colors
02:15 - dot append black and colors dot append
02:18 - white so append is a list helper
02:20 - function that will add
02:22 - items so here we're adding black and
02:24 - white and these items go to the back of
02:27 - the list
02:28 - we're also going to do colors that
02:29 - remove yellow and colors that remove
02:32 - orange so remove is just like pop but
02:35 - you for remove is slower and you need to
02:39 - type the exact item in
02:42 - here yeah
02:43 - so we're going to add black and white
02:46 - and we're going to remove yellow orange
02:48 - finally we're going to print colors
02:50 - again so let's save it and you can use
02:52 - the up arrow to copy what you last typed
02:54 - internal so it did the original then red
02:57 - green blue purple black and white
03:00 - so it removed yellow and orange and
03:04 - i added black and white oh yeah
03:09 - so next we have the list again and we're
03:11 - gonna do colors that remove whatever
03:14 - it's not in the list yes so we're gonna
03:16 - see what happens if we try to remove an
03:19 - item that is not in the list let's save
03:22 - it and run it
03:25 - so it did a bug it said list.remove then
03:28 - xs whatever you typed in is not in the
03:31 - list so if you try to remove an item
03:34 - that is not in the list then you have a
03:37 - book
03:38 - no
03:40 - next thing i do
03:41 - new colors equals lime and gray so this
03:44 - is another list with two colors lime and
03:47 - grey that's another color
03:50 - two other colors next we're gonna do
03:52 - colors.extend new colors then print
03:55 - colors so the extend helper function
03:58 - will add two lists together so the new
04:00 - colors
04:01 - is going to be added to color yeah and
04:04 - the items are going to be at the back of
04:07 - the list so let's save it and run it
04:10 - oh what happened so it
04:19 - yeah so
04:20 - there was lime and gray at the back
04:23 - [Music]
04:25 - next we're gonna do print colors so you
04:28 - know original list then we're gonna do
04:30 - colors.clear
04:32 - so the clear helper function will clear
04:35 - your list and it will be an empty list
04:37 - there will be
04:38 - it'll clear every single item in the
04:41 - list except the um square brackets yeah
04:44 - that two square brackets is an empty
04:47 - list finally we're gonna print the empty
04:49 - list let's save it
04:53 - and run it
04:54 - so it did the original list then
04:57 - blank
04:58 - it has no items no anything in the list
05:01 - just two square brackets yes yeah
05:04 - that was fun and that's it for today
