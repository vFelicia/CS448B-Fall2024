00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia and today we're in Minecraft's
00:06 - hour of code Escape Este so in the last
00:09 - video of Escape estate
00:12 - um we went into this Mansion found the
00:15 - agent helped it now it opened the green
00:18 - door for us
00:19 - which is like very
00:21 - mysterious now we got enter
00:25 - loading oh that's so creepy videos
00:32 - agent wait before you go I need to tell
00:34 - you one last thing this house is filled
00:37 - with Escape rooms you'll need to find
00:39 - Clues soft puzzles and fix code to make
00:41 - your way out press C to reveal reveal a
00:45 - puzzle's code one two coats the code to
00:48 - see what happens if there are errors fix
00:50 - the code and running again to test it
00:52 - that is called debugging
00:55 - sometimes Solutions won't be clear and
00:57 - that not all puzzles typical to solve
01:00 - when you find a puzzle remember to run
01:02 - the code first to see what's wrong then
01:04 - debug and fix the positively code it's
01:07 - much easier than writing code from
01:09 - scratch keep an eye out for this Clues
01:12 - such as particles to help guide you
01:14 - close so that agent gave us some
01:17 - um hints and help us so we so in the
01:21 - first video we found this diary page now
01:25 - we found another one let's see entry to
01:27 - this study they are diary I finally
01:30 - found a way out of the attic only to
01:32 - become trapped in this strange Library I
01:35 - do believe the large mirror here is more
01:37 - than than it seems it is true is it
01:40 - truly a mirror or a window to another to
01:43 - another dimension regardlessly I have no
01:47 - option other than to Hasbro and see
01:51 - where it takes me clothes
01:53 - search room for particles
01:55 - oh there's a particle right click
01:58 - particles so there's like a button right
02:00 - here okay let's right click
02:03 - close
02:05 - right click wait oh the painting went
02:08 - down
02:09 - and this
02:11 - big brown ball is here okay let's see go
02:16 - go to Cola see what we have to do
02:19 - play ball maze so I guess that ball was
02:23 - a clay ball move the clay ball to the
02:26 - gold block use the clay ball move
02:28 - function to navigate the bot through the
02:31 - maze the clay ball move function takes
02:33 - one perimeter then defines what
02:35 - direction it should move it validate the
02:38 - directions are up down left and right so
02:41 - this is a cool example clay ball moves
02:43 - up three times let's see what it does
02:45 - okay
02:47 - oh the clay ball moves up three times
02:49 - well that works okay but it seems like
02:53 - it didn't complete our code because it
02:56 - nothing happened except the
02:58 - um clay but I'll move back all the way
03:00 - down okay let's go back to code
03:03 - use a for Loop to do one or more actions
03:07 - multiple times so it's like a loop well
03:09 - it is a loop and it's gonna help us like
03:12 - make our code shorter so this is the
03:14 - same command as the first one we tried
03:16 - except like only into like in a shorter
03:21 - version okay navigate to Clay ball
03:23 - through the maze to reach the gold block
03:25 - that the included code book below is
03:29 - broken can you fix it run the code to
03:31 - see what happens then debug it by adding
03:34 - it to the correct solution
03:36 - okay up three times oh I went to the red
03:39 - block instead of the gold block okay so
03:43 - we can't move it to the red block but
03:45 - the gold block okay let's see so I'm
03:49 - gonna turn the clay ball move
03:51 - up into four I in range
03:56 - three times
03:59 - so we make a loop and we're gonna do
04:02 - clay
04:03 - ball
04:04 - move foreign
04:10 - so we can get out the first line and the
04:14 - clay ball move
04:16 - um right two times because when we first
04:19 - found it it went to the left instead of
04:22 - the right we need to move to the right
04:24 - to go to a gold block okay
04:27 - right
04:30 - and right again
04:32 - what and then we need to move down three
04:35 - times to reach a go walk let's run it
04:37 - okay up for you guys yes we got it oh
04:41 - does it oh it's such room for particles
04:44 - oh that's that's the mirror
04:47 - wait
04:49 - wait but in the mirror there's like the
04:51 - switches
04:53 - oh maybe we should switch the switches
04:56 - that one uh that one
04:59 - this one and
05:02 - this one
05:04 - whoa what oh I guess
05:08 - there's no more particles oh it's the
05:11 - same okay now move on to here pumpkins
05:17 - things in the mirror appear differently
05:19 - than in the room you're in find all the
05:21 - differences and modify the room to make
05:23 - them match use move cursor to position
05:26 - the cursor and place block to place the
05:28 - Block in the position you have selected
05:30 - so now so we know the mirror we have to
05:34 - match everything in this room as the
05:36 - mirror is so when we switch the lights
05:39 - the it's like the first light has to be
05:43 - on and this light has to be off and this
05:45 - light on and now in the mirror all of
05:49 - the pumpkins are there but over here
05:50 - only three of the pumpkins are there
05:52 - okay let's go code
05:54 - okay let's see a place back okay but
05:57 - this is a code example it won't work
06:01 - okay
06:04 - that doesn't work
06:05 - so this is the code with the loop it's
06:11 - the same code as this but just with the
06:13 - loop okay let's see it will do the same
06:15 - exact thing
06:18 - okay because it doesn't work okay then
06:21 - now we're gonna go to here which is
06:24 - where we could so this this works but I
06:29 - think it's too long I'm just gonna
06:33 - copy the place block this one and then
06:37 - all these
06:39 - just delete it so we because we don't
06:42 - need it okay
06:47 - until we have nothing left
06:51 - okay
06:52 - please code here
06:55 - okay and then for I in range to make
07:00 - um
07:01 - to make a loop we're gonna do it five
07:04 - times let's see what happens if I do it
07:07 - five times okay and then we're gonna do
07:10 - move cursor blue and
07:13 - no place block and then move cursor so
07:19 - move cursor and then Place block first
07:27 - there Place block let's see what happens
07:29 - come on okay
07:32 - wait
07:34 - oh for Iron Range
07:36 - it's not a string oopsies
07:40 - it's supposed to be just an integer not
07:43 - a string that will work okay one two
07:46 - three four five
07:50 - yes we did it search for particles
07:54 - oh what's this
07:56 - oh it broke it broke
07:59 - it broke so it's true if the particles
08:02 - again
08:03 - oh what's this
08:07 - works
08:08 - oh that doesn't work
08:10 - okay let's see
08:13 - you need to flip all four lovers to open
08:16 - the door but you're not quick enough to
08:17 - do it manually see if you can figure out
08:19 - the order they need to be flipped then
08:22 - program your new friend the Speedy
08:24 - Knight to do it for us you see move
08:27 - Knight function to Define which color
08:29 - the speeding Knight should move to okay
08:31 - so this is our friend Speedy night I
08:34 - guess it's a statue with
08:36 - things to make it like a night okay so
08:39 - as name said it's Speedy since it said
08:43 - that we can't do it manually because
08:45 - we're too slow but speed and light
08:47 - should be fast enough to do that okay
08:51 - okay so let's see move night blue move
08:55 - night orange move Knight remove Knight
08:58 - orange that doesn't work
09:00 - then what are these here or maybe we
09:03 - should follow like this one first like
09:05 - move night blue and then move my Magneto
09:08 - and then so on like yellow to Orange
09:11 - let's see if that works figure out what
09:15 - order lovers should be flipped by paying
09:17 - close attention to the carpets in front
09:18 - of them then moving speeding Knight to
09:20 - each level in the correct order the
09:22 - speeding Knight is clever enough to flip
09:24 - the lever when it's in position okay so
09:26 - I am right these are carpets and we need
09:28 - to flip it so maybe you want the bluest
09:31 - one and then two and then yellow three
09:34 - and then four okay
09:35 - let's cook
09:38 - okay so move night blue and deck uh this
09:43 - is wrong so I mean yeah fix this this is
09:46 - magnata and then it's yellow and then
09:50 - orange so we're coating Speedy Knight to
09:54 - do this for us to help us okay run
09:57 - uh run
10:00 - oh it's fast well it's like teleporting
10:05 - boom cleared cool thank you Speedy night
10:09 - and
10:11 - suit of armor so Speedy Knight and suit
10:14 - of armor but suit of armor is just
10:16 - standing there but look there's a next
10:19 - place this place is finished with stuff
10:21 - cracked
10:22 - mirror and the moving painting with the
10:26 - clay balls the pumpkins and The Night
10:29 - the Lights and Speedy Knight and suit of
10:32 - armor
10:33 - next video we're gonna go in and see
10:37 - where it will take us next but for now
10:39 - let's just
10:40 - stay here so well that was fun and
10:44 - that's it for today thank you for
10:46 - watching Remember to smash the like
10:48 - button and subscribe bye bye

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia and today we're in Minecraft's hour of code Escape Este so in the last video of Escape estate um we went into this Mansion found the agent helped it now it opened the green door for us which is like very mysterious now we got enter loading oh that's so creepy videos agent wait before you go I need to tell you one last thing this house is filled with Escape rooms you'll need to find Clues soft puzzles and fix code to make your way out press C to reveal reveal a puzzle's code one two coats the code to see what happens if there are errors fix the

what's wrong then debug and fix the positively code it's much easier than writing code from scratch keep an eye out for this Clues such as particles to help guide you close so that agent gave us some um hints and help us so we so in the first video we found this diary page now we found another one let's see entry to this study they are diary I finally found a way out of the attic only to become trapped in this strange Library I do believe the large mirror here is more than than it seems it is true is it truly a mirror or a window to another to another dimension regardlessly I have no option other than to Hasbro and see where it takes me clothes search room for particles oh there's a particle right click particles so there's like a button right here okay let's right click close right click wait oh the painting went down and this big brown ball is here okay let's see go go to Cola see what we have to do play ball maze so I guess that ball was a clay ball move the clay ball to the gold block use the clay ball move function to navigate the bot through the maze the clay ball move function takes one perimeter then defines what direction it should move it validate the directions

guys yes we got it oh does it oh it's such room for particles oh that's that's the mirror wait wait but in the mirror there's like the switches oh maybe we should switch the switches that one uh that one this one and this one whoa what oh I guess there's no more particles oh it's the same okay now move on to here pumpkins things in the mirror appear differently than in the room you're in find all the differences and modify the room to make them match use move cursor to position the cursor and place block to place the Block in the position you have selected so now so we know the mirror we have to match everything in this room as the mirror is so when we switch the lights the it's like the first light has to be on and this light has to be off and this light on and now in the mirror all of

please code here okay and then for I in range to make um to make a loop we're gonna do it five times let's see what happens if I do it five times okay and then we're gonna do move cursor blue and no place block and then move cursor so move cursor and then Place block first there Place block let's see what happens come on okay wait oh for Iron Range it's not a string oopsies it's supposed to be just an integer not a string that will work okay one two three four five yes we did it search for particles oh what's this oh it broke it broke it broke so it's true if the particles again oh what's this works oh that doesn't work okay let's see you need to flip all four lovers to open the door but you're not quick enough to do it manually see if you can figure out the order they need to be
