00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia today we're in timecraft So today
00:06 - we're gonna do this one with the
00:08 - dinosaur
00:10 - and yeah so let's press it go to tampon
00:15 - get free interesting in this Thai split
00:19 - it seems that these long neck dinosaurs
00:21 - necks have shrunk it actually now looks
00:25 - weird yeah there must be a clue Left
00:27 - Behind as to what happened I have
00:29 - located a dig site where
00:32 - polenta lodges are discovering dinosaur
00:34 - fossils travel to North America
00:37 - Wilderness in the 18
00:39 - 000s 1800s and discovered whatever and
00:45 - [Music]
00:50 - archaeologists dig site North America
00:52 - Wilderness 1800s
00:54 - paleontologist it appears that the
00:57 - creature we have uncovered here had
00:59 - quite a short neck they must have
01:01 - climbed trees that eat their leaves wow
01:03 - climb that's weird yeah look the
01:06 - dinosaur in the dick site is missing its
01:08 - neck bones the culprit must have stolen
01:11 - them we need to put those bones back in
01:13 - place start a mission by using a talk
01:15 - device to teleport the agent to its
01:16 - start on a location so let's go oh
01:21 - that's the head
01:24 - and these
01:27 - and there's something on there
01:30 - wow these head looks
01:32 - yeah look it's a picture it's a picture
01:36 - a picture
01:38 - okay so let's use the top
01:41 - start activity
01:43 - [Music]
01:44 - yeah excellent now that a Time agent is
01:48 - replaced let's use code to replace those
01:49 - missing Network clothes
01:52 - see
01:54 - so we're I'm going to be make the bone
01:58 - so that we're gonna Place bone could
02:00 - your agent to destroy the four orange
02:02 - blocks
02:03 - and
02:05 - and place the bone block we've given it
02:08 - so the agent already has the bone blocks
02:11 - in its inventory
02:12 - [Music]
02:15 - these blocks locks with bones
02:17 - to make a long neck and our agent has 64
02:22 - bone blocks okay so that's code so we
02:26 - have to our eggs we have to reach the
02:29 - orange block so we have to move one two
02:34 - two two blocks say agent moves forward
02:38 - by two
02:40 - and then we replace it so we're going to
02:42 - destroy the block destroy down
02:46 - and go right above the orange block then
02:49 - when you place the um
02:51 - please place the bone block down
02:54 - okay so we need to do it one two three
02:57 - four times
02:59 - turn use a repeat Loop and repeat it
03:02 - four times to shorten the code
03:04 - or else we'll have to like do this like
03:07 - do this code four times or press this
03:08 - screen button times yeah okay so let's
03:11 - go so fast fast
03:14 - yeah paleontologist wait this crazy
03:18 - actually had a very long neck it must
03:20 - have used it to reach the laser toss
03:23 - trees fascinating that's weird
03:25 - I think the culprit just replace it okay
03:29 - so amazing work you've repaired this
03:31 - moment in time now paleontology has a
03:34 - more accurate record of life on the
03:35 - earth from the last four billion years
03:37 - okay so let's close it scanning scanning
03:42 - where's the secret height secret from
03:45 - Secret detected so that's oh we're like
03:50 - the search and that we just saw it up
03:53 - here like a gold button okay
03:55 - it's right over there really that's nice
04:01 - oh
04:03 - go down the stairs you found the secret
04:05 - room take note of which time agents you
04:07 - see here and head back to the Institute
04:09 - okay is
04:17 - high jumping three two one
04:21 - okay we're back oh yeah go go pass
04:26 - fantastic work here repair the timeline
04:28 - but just barely now that we have this
04:31 - situation under control meet me at the
04:33 - center of the control room to store your
04:34 - time and get back in their paws
04:39 - okay now these are the cages it's so
04:43 - cool now they're all back in front of
04:45 - you will be the time major storage pods
04:47 - use your talk device to return your
04:49 - agent to your pod
04:52 - oh okay
04:55 - great work not to store everyone except
04:57 - you Yeti you stay right here until we
04:59 - can check you out
05:03 - what's up Yeti He's the bad guy clap
05:05 - clap you figured it out I'm the culprit
05:07 - but you're too late you might have
05:09 - stopped me this time but I'll be back I
05:11 - just said clap with those hands it's
05:12 - like I can't reach like the other hand
05:15 - it broke its cage go
05:19 - I'm fast
05:20 - I can't there's a bear yeah it just
05:24 - disappeared the whole time machine
05:25 - disappeared yeah the whole thing I'm not
05:28 - sure where the copper has gone but we'll
05:29 - find them it's just a matter of time you
05:31 - can go back and try again so here we go
05:35 - time time detected so we can jump off
05:39 - and see when you're ready use your talk
05:41 - device to replay this game oh okay so
05:44 - now here's the bone it's like a big dog
05:47 - bone or if this one and this one
05:49 - together it will make a dog yeah this
05:52 - one also looks like a muscle yeah it
05:54 - looks like muscle and the ones that like
05:57 - the strong guys be like this yeah
05:59 - but this but the green thing is the most
06:02 - weirdest yeah
06:04 - okay
06:05 - so now we're looking at
06:08 - here
06:10 - well that was fun and that's it for
06:13 - today thank you for watching Remember to
