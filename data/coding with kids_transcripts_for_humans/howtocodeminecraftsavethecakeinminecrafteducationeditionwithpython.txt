00:00 - welcome to cutting with kids my name is
00:08 - a tutorial so we're going to
00:11 - save the cake cake
00:17 - so place a cake block at your current
00:22 - [Music]
00:28 - positions
00:32 - [Music]
00:35 - make a new variable called kick sitting
00:38 - variable
00:39 - to player's world position so
00:42 - two variables
00:48 - [Music]
00:57 - player world position
01:02 - and now make another variable to
01:04 - remember
01:05 - what the time is when you start to land
01:08 - away from the kick
01:09 - name this variable lander set
01:12 - the window variable to current game time
01:15 - using time
01:17 - so then make lander
01:23 - okay and then set one
01:27 - two times
01:31 - okay next
01:34 - use it forever loop to check how long
01:36 - you've wandered away from your cake
01:39 - inside the loop use an if condition to
01:41 - check
01:42 - to see if the game time is long enough
01:45 - to make
01:46 - your return to the cake so
01:52 - enough forever loop
01:54 - [Music]
01:57 - if
02:00 - [Music]
02:02 - then then go
02:06 - to math
02:09 - logic over here
02:13 - [Music]
02:15 - switch it
02:19 - game time is larger than zero
02:24 - then inside the if condition subtract
02:26 - the time
02:27 - in wander from the current game time
02:31 - make the condition true if the time
02:33 - difference is
02:34 - greater than 300 ticks so 300
02:40 - then minus
02:44 - for math minus then the variable
02:52 - [Music]
02:56 - and get the variable right here
03:00 - and put in the other slot then put it
03:03 - back
03:04 - into the eighth loop
03:07 - then if the 300 tick time
03:10 - expired broadcast to the game that
03:13 - you're going
03:14 - back to that your kick save
03:23 - [Music]
03:29 - teleport your player back to the cake if
03:33 - the 300 ticks have exp also set
03:37 - the winner variable to the current game
03:39 - time so forever
03:41 - tote port to cake
03:50 - [Music]
03:58 - okay
04:04 - [Music]
04:07 - run your program and start walking away
04:09 - from it did you
04:10 - get pulled back to the kick after one
04:12 - okay
04:13 - so let's see first let's see the python
04:18 - so def on chat pass and player.lunch
04:21 - have
04:22 - run on chat so that's on forever so this
04:25 - is forever
04:26 - global wander so it's a global variable
04:29 - container
04:30 - if gameplay that time for a game time
04:33 - minus lander is more than 300 and the
04:36 - player will say
04:37 - back to gift then player dot teleport to
04:40 - the cake
04:54 - position where is off in case variable
04:57 - equals clear dot position
04:59 - reminder equals game played that time
05:01 - [Music]
05:02 - okay so let's see where is the key
05:09 - that's uh
05:10 - [Music]
05:35 - [Music]
05:36 - first before we cleanse it
05:41 - but it's not an eatable cake because the
05:44 - agent has been smashed into
05:46 - it you can't plant it
05:52 - what if we're safe oh
05:55 - my god
06:11 - [Music]
06:18 - um
06:30 - [Music]
06:40 - oh man
06:43 - i'm gonna eat the cake oops
06:56 - well that was fun and that's it for
06:59 - today
06:59 - thank you for watching remember to
07:02 - subscribe and subscribe
07:04 - bye bye

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to cutting with kids my name is a tutorial so we're going to save the cake cake so place a cake block at your current positions make a new variable called kick sitting variable to player's world position so two variables player world position and now make another variable to remember what the time is when you start to land away from the kick name this variable lander set the window variable to current game time using time so then make lander okay and then set one two times okay next use it forever loop to check how long you've wandered away from your cake inside the loop use an if condition to check to see if the game time is long enough to make your return to the cake so enough forever loop if then then go to math logic over here switch it game time is larger than zero then inside the if condition subtract the time in wander from the current game time make the condition true if the time difference is greater than 300 ticks so 300 then minus for math minus then the variable and get the variable right here and put in the other slot then put it back into the eighth loop then if the 300 tick time expired broadcast to the game that you're going back to that your kick save teleport your player back to the cake if the 300 ticks have exp also set the winner variable to the current game time so forever tote port to cake okay run your program and start walking away from it did you get pulled back to the kick after one okay so let's see first let's see the python so def on chat pass and player.lunch have run on chat so that's on forever so this is forever global wander so it's a global variable container if gameplay that time for a game time minus lander is more than 300 and the player will say back to gift then player dot teleport to the cake position where is off in case variable equals clear dot position reminder equals game played that time okay so let's see where is the key that's uh first before we cleanse it but it's not an eatable cake because the agent has been smashed into it you can't plant it what if we're safe oh my god um oh man i'm gonna eat the cake oops well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to subscribe and subscribe bye bye
