00:20 - let's see what if i be among us and
00:22 - touch the red
00:25 - now let's see what i changed so in
00:27 - sprite 3 which is a
00:29 - player i changed it was supposed to be
00:32 - first
00:32 - red and blue but this i just
00:36 - put it on top the steve head so you know
00:38 - it's actually
00:39 - red and the among us
00:44 - player was from andrew's among us fly
00:47 - so it's blue and it's sign color so it's
00:51 - more makes sense and
00:55 - this bright one it's supposed to be
01:00 - um red and blue a change in minecraft
01:02 - and longest and
01:03 - it's supposed to be by
01:07 - the first username i said remixed by
01:12 - kidako123 and
01:15 - at sprite 4 which is a stadium
01:18 - because the background which i actually
01:21 - changed
01:22 - it was like blue and some of these these
01:26 - like the exit is this almost like
01:30 - the same color so i change it into like
01:33 - a
01:34 - blue green color so i had to replace it
01:38 - sometimes you can still see a little bit
01:40 - of it and it's like touching the blue
01:43 - i mean the black and the follow
01:47 - faith and
01:51 - love is i got these sprite from another
01:56 - like the costume from another person's
01:58 - project and the code i did so
02:00 - when green flag clicked it will go to
02:03 - 3628 which is about
02:05 - here hide forever we pick
02:08 - random 5 to 10 seconds it will show
02:12 - grab one second so it's like moving
02:15 - to x 36 y negative 10 so it will just
02:19 - like move down
02:21 - hide and go back to like your original
02:24 - space
02:24 - and it will when we in fact
02:27 - set time to zero forever change time by
02:30 - one
02:30 - wait one second so it's just like a
02:33 - timer that will never show and the
02:36 - backdrop like i said
02:38 - i changed it to like first blue here and
02:42 - all the way to white
02:43 - now let's play i'll go first
02:47 - red don't touch blue
02:50 - the first thing level is easy
02:54 - second level kind of easy to just need
02:56 - to hop over
02:57 - right with the momentous player
03:00 - we never touch green it's the enemy of
03:03 - both red and blue
03:10 - careful harder andrew will do the harder
03:44 - easy
