00:00 - welcome to cutting with kids my name is
00:03 - colleen and my name is andrew general
00:04 - minecraft education so we're on python
00:06 - 101 lesson 8. so first we're going to
00:09 - talk to the ceo so the ceo says hi there
00:12 - we are trying to help an e ecological
00:15 - organization with their project they
00:17 - want to plant a large number of trees in
00:18 - a very short time that is why we want to
00:21 - develop the agent to do it should be
00:22 - easy then however we have been having
00:24 - some problems can you help us
00:26 - someone help the ceo make the agent
00:30 - plant trees
00:31 - and do stuff
00:33 - faster so the
00:35 - developer says i need your help i need
00:37 - to get the agent to till the grass box
00:39 - plant saplings on them and then
00:41 - fertilize those saplings to grow the
00:42 - plant however i can not seem to get the
00:45 - agent to chill each of the grass blocks
00:47 - in a row could you write some code to me
00:49 - with my problem
00:50 - okay
00:51 - so we're going to help the developer you
00:53 - get the agent to tell plant and
00:55 - fertilize the plants so which is
00:58 - basically make the agent plant a tree
01:02 - okay so first
01:03 - here
01:04 - we're going to define a function called
01:06 - plant
01:08 - okay
01:08 - these will be on to plant
01:11 - then we're going to make the aging tail
01:12 - to his left so we're going to do agent
01:15 - dot channel
01:18 - down
01:20 - to its left because the dirt
01:22 - block is to its left
01:25 - okay
01:26 - then
01:27 - we're going to place
01:29 - agent dot place
01:32 - sapling to its left to to plant it
01:36 - then here
01:37 - we're going to make the agent move
01:39 - forward and do agent
01:42 - move
01:43 - forward
01:45 - one time
01:46 - then call your function
01:48 - plant
01:50 - [Music]
01:52 - then
01:53 - we just not moved forward again
01:55 - so we need agent that move to move to
01:58 - the next block agent double
02:02 - move
02:04 - forward
02:06 - six times let's see if it's actually
02:09 - sticking after it goes to here and one
02:12 - two three four five six okay that's
02:15 - correct okay then your call function
02:18 - again
02:19 - because there are three diff blocks
02:22 - walk six
02:24 - times again agent move
02:28 - forward
02:31 - six times
02:33 - and then call your function again
02:36 - okay now you're gonna run it
02:41 - so there you go so that's so fast
02:44 - okay so fast maybe yeah
02:49 - so part two when you add fertilizer so
02:51 - here are planted little plants with a
02:54 - diamond
02:55 - okay
02:56 - so next
03:00 - here
03:01 - we're gonna go to code so part two here
03:04 - let's set the agent's inventory slot to
03:07 - one so we're gonna do agent
03:10 - dot set underscore slot
03:14 - to one because we need to put multiple
03:17 - things in the agent's
03:18 - inventory
03:20 - okay then here we're going to do
03:23 - set
03:24 - we're going to do
03:26 - agent
03:28 - dot
03:29 - set
03:30 - slot to two
03:32 - we don't want to over place the items
03:35 - then we're gonna make the agent place
03:37 - fertilizer two is left so we're gonna do
03:39 - agent dot place
03:42 - left
03:43 - then we're gonna copy this because we
03:44 - have to do it a lot of times
03:46 - i'm going to copy this
03:49 - okay right here
03:52 - you also need to do tab because it's in
03:54 - the
03:55 - well in the function
03:57 - okay
04:04 - [Music]
04:15 - [Music]
04:17 - makes the plants go faster so yeah the
04:20 - bone meal when the agent used a bone
04:22 - marrow made the
04:24 - the plant grow immediately into a full
04:26 - road trip
04:28 - with a lot
04:30 - like i'll say like six bombings i think
04:32 - yeah okay next we're gonna
04:34 - talk to the developer
04:36 - again
04:37 - and then the developer says i need to
04:39 - get the aeg to remove all the rocks
04:41 - after which it should chill the sore
04:43 - implant stop itself however each time we
04:46 - run the code the agent just walks
04:48 - right into the rocks without breaking
04:50 - giving by some coaching
04:51 - problem we're going to try to help the
04:54 - developer to get the at9 to walk right
04:56 - into the rocks and do that
04:59 - yeah and do nothing and blink its head
05:01 - you don't want to engage it together
05:03 - okay so first robot
05:06 - define function called destroy
05:10 - okay
05:11 - then we'll make the agent destroyed
05:13 - block forward we did that
05:15 - destroy
05:16 - [Music]
05:18 - forward
05:20 - because when i destroy the stone block
05:22 - that is forward right here
05:25 - okay
05:26 - then we're going to make the unit move
05:28 - forward how many times
05:31 - one two so i can plant because there's
05:34 - actually dirt under the stove
05:37 - so block
05:37 - gonna do
05:39 - agent dot
05:40 - move
05:42 - forward
05:43 - one time
05:45 - and here
05:46 - we're gonna do
05:48 - four i in
05:49 - range
05:51 - twelve times
05:52 - so it's a replica
05:55 - if
05:56 - agent dot inspect
05:58 - so it's a function
06:01 - agent
06:03 - [Music]
06:04 - inspection inspection
06:07 - dot
06:08 - block
06:09 - so the agent will try to inspect the
06:11 - block
06:12 - all the way forward
06:15 - because the um stone is
06:17 - forward of it yeah forward
06:20 - then we need to search for its specific
06:22 - block equals equals
06:24 - stone
06:27 - then
06:28 - we're going to call function for
06:30 - removing
06:31 - rocks which is destroy
06:33 - someone destroy the rock
06:35 - then here
06:37 - else
06:38 - else
06:40 - if there is no rock though move forward
06:42 - agent don't move
06:44 - forward
06:46 - one time so right now we're not planting
06:49 - yet we're just destroying the rocks
06:51 - and going to the end which is a good one
06:54 - go ahead go go
06:56 - oh the agent uses his hands yeah
06:59 - how powerful it's like it it's like
07:02 - awesome creative mode you can show any
07:04 - block with one hit okay now when you
07:07 - after we do the stone we apply it
07:10 - okay so now
07:12 - part two
07:14 - here i'm gonna declare function to death
07:18 - plant
07:19 - now we have to plant
07:21 - then here an agent move forward agent
07:24 - dot
07:25 - move
07:26 - forward
07:28 - forward
07:31 - [Music]
07:38 - we did the forward so the agent will be
07:40 - ahead of the dirt block well the
07:43 - brass block and then your till to make
07:45 - it a dirt block it's so cool it tilts
07:48 - yeah
07:50 - so we can
07:52 - plant then the agent dot place the seed
07:56 - back
07:57 - okay
07:59 - then
08:01 - here bottom after the destroyer we're
08:03 - doing lf which is elsa
08:06 - lf
08:08 - alif agent dot inspect
08:12 - a agent
08:14 - inspection
08:16 - inspection dot block
08:20 - down now
08:22 - equals equals
08:25 - grass
08:27 - so now we are searching for the grass
08:29 - block underneath the agent
08:32 - then
08:32 - [Music]
08:34 - we're going to do
08:35 - here
08:36 - and a call function for planting trees
08:38 - so we're going to plant
08:40 - right there and then the elves okay
08:44 - now we're in the right go agent go
08:46 - go ages 12.
08:48 - that's cool yeah because it
08:50 - destroys the block
08:52 - the stone block while planting yes and
08:55 - it's also pretty cool when it chills
08:57 - backward because there's like he's like
08:59 - they just so cool he just chills
09:01 - backward
09:02 - without looking yeah well that's how
09:05 - robot is actually
09:07 - okay cool robot mixer goes here and talk
09:11 - to
09:12 - the third developer there's so many
09:14 - developers free developers yeah they're
09:16 - on all the activities the developer says
09:19 - help i'm trying to get the agent to
09:21 - plant saplings on tilled soil on a small
09:23 - pasture however there's nothing wrong
09:25 - with my coat the agent does not cover
09:27 - the whole area
09:29 - okay this is a big area so first
09:32 - this part we need the agent to move all
09:35 - cleanly row by row and then go to the
09:38 - gold block and the second part you'll
09:40 - need a plant and stuff
09:42 - oh that's much harder but first let's
09:45 - clear this one
09:46 - so the agent's going to be planting it
09:48 - walking along let's hope his feet will
09:50 - not grow sore
09:52 - it's a robot
09:54 - okay so first here i'm going to declare
09:56 - function one
09:58 - def let's see move yes it's just moving
10:02 - this part
10:08 - [Music]
10:15 - forward
10:24 - okay so one row is one
10:27 - two three four five six seven eight nine
10:31 - so it's nine blocks
10:33 - okay but the second row is going to be
10:35 - ten because you know you didn't stand in
10:37 - the first block two three four five six
10:40 - seven eight nine yeah you're right okay
10:44 - so here back here it's gonna return that
10:47 - move okay then here
10:50 - i'm gonna do
10:52 - i'm gonna do
10:54 - death
10:56 - here down here
11:00 - underscore
11:02 - right
11:03 - okay so it's another function so
11:06 - make the agent turn right because the
11:08 - function is called turn right so agent
11:12 - forgot
11:24 - direction
11:41 - agent dot move
11:43 - forward
11:44 - [Music]
11:46 - one time
11:49 - okay
11:50 - and
11:51 - you turn right again
11:53 - agent
11:54 - [Music]
12:02 - so this is like the code for when the
12:04 - agent needs to go to the edge
12:07 - of a row then you said turn
12:10 - right
12:11 - [Music]
12:13 - okay
12:15 - now here i make another function
12:19 - def
12:20 - left
12:34 - direction
12:38 - not left
12:41 - okay so we're turning left
12:43 - move forward
12:46 - keep that move forward
12:48 - one time
12:51 - up to the d needs to capitalize and then
12:54 - finally
12:56 - here
12:57 - major dot turn left again it's basically
13:01 - the
13:02 - same as term right right one but it's
13:06 - just the turns
13:07 - are left and the um
13:11 - name is the right one is turn right and
13:13 - the left one is left turn okay here
13:17 - dude four i in range
13:21 - range
13:23 - four times
13:27 - oh yeah
13:28 - sometimes i just typical
13:31 - call function makes the patient move
13:32 - forward
13:34 - [Music]
13:37 - just turn
13:40 - right yeah
13:42 - then here
13:45 - [Music]
14:01 - the four iron range it's actually two
14:03 - rows so
14:04 - one
14:05 - two
14:06 - three four so that's great
14:09 - now
14:10 - [Music]
14:12 - go ahead go
14:14 - go go it's like it's a race it's arms
14:17 - and legs are moving so it's when it's
14:20 - moving so fast it looks like it's wheels
14:22 - yeah it's like flash
14:26 - okay part two
14:28 - part two agent won't run as fast because
14:31 - you need to still implant anyone else
14:36 - okay so now it's gonna do it's cool move
14:38 - till back again oh that's so cool
14:41 - up
14:42 - here right here and add to here
14:47 - if
14:49 - agent dot inspect
14:53 - project dot respect
14:56 - agent pages inspection
15:01 - dot block
15:04 - comma
15:05 - down
15:08 - equals equals graph
15:10 - and do the same as last time because it
15:12 - needs to till again
15:14 - and a function that plants saplings so
15:17 - we're going to do plant for now we
15:19 - didn't do the function yet
15:21 - and here
15:23 - we're going to do place the command
15:26 - so
15:28 - now
15:28 - here we're going to go here
15:30 - which is make the plan
15:33 - death plan
15:36 - then over here we'll do agent dot move
15:39 - for agent
15:41 - moon
15:43 - forward
15:44 - one
15:47 - okay
15:48 - the date isn't capitalized
15:51 - i always
15:52 - but that's the
15:54 - [Music]
16:04 - [Music]
16:07 - like missed the place back
16:09 - if they place back agent dot
16:12 - place
16:14 - back
16:15 - it's gonna place backwards
16:17 - plant okay then
16:20 - here after we finish we're going to
16:23 - try
16:25 - okay so here grass oh colon
16:28 - ah
16:29 - i'm sorry i i didn't see that's it
16:33 - now it's very slow because you check
16:36 - every time you're moving it checks it's
16:37 - not flash now yeah it needs to check
16:39 - it's back because it's grasp off
16:42 - but it still uses cool moves yeah
16:46 - i can see after it chills i can
16:48 - sometimes see the diamond
16:50 - um yeah it's like very flashy when it
16:54 - tails until very big sometimes i see it
16:56 - like it's um a pickaxe yeah
17:00 - but wait look look fruity look through
17:02 - the um
17:05 - uh you know what the planted near the
17:08 - edge i can see kind of blue
17:10 - yeah i think that's blocking this block
17:13 - is it water or no i think it's yeah i
17:16 - think it's water
17:18 - maybe
17:19 - but maybe it's glass
17:21 - water
17:23 - well there's rockets and we complete it
17:25 - okay now bye bye three developers yeah
17:29 - finish our job here we step listen
17:32 - we get our money here in our pay
17:35 - and that that like that room we first go
17:38 - to talk to ceo is like so cool because
17:41 - yeah there's a big tree with lanterns
17:44 - and like some places there's light
17:48 - crawling up the tree oh my god
17:54 - then fall we won't take fall damage
17:57 - [Music]
17:59 - hi ceo
18:00 - did you like how we climbed yes this is
18:03 - what you see oh it says you're not
18:05 - allowed to climb sorry but you already

18:19 - for watching remember to smash the like
18:21 - button and subscribe bye bye

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to cutting with kids my name is colleen and my name is andrew general minecraft education so we're on python 101 lesson 8. so first we're going to talk to the ceo so the ceo says hi there we are trying to help an e ecological organization with their project they want to plant a large number of trees in a very short time that is why we want to develop the agent to do it should be easy then however we have been having some problems can you help us someone help the ceo make the agent plant trees and do stuff faster so the developer says i need your help i need to get the agent to till the grass box plant saplings on them and then fertilize those saplings to grow the plant however i can not seem to get the agent to chill each of the grass blocks in a row could you write some code to me with my problem okay so we're going to help the developer you get the agent to tell plant and fertilize the plants so which is basically make the agent plant a tree okay so first here we're going to define a function called plant okay these will be on to plant then we're going to make the aging tail to his left so we're going to do agent dot channel down to its left because the dirt block is to its left okay then we're going to place agent dot place sapling to its left to to plant it then here we're going to make the agent move forward and do agent move forward one time then call your function plant then we just not moved forward again so we need agent that move to move to the next block agent double move forward six times let's see if it's actually sticking after it goes to here and one two three four five six okay that's correct okay then your call function again because there are three diff blocks walk six times again agent move forward six times and then call your function again okay now you're gonna run it so there you go so that's so fast okay so fast maybe yeah so part two when you add fertilizer so here are planted little plants with a diamond okay so next here we're gonna go to code so part two here let's set the agent's inventory slot to one so we're gonna do agent dot set underscore slot to one because we need to put multiple things in the agent's inventory okay then here we're going to do set we're going to do agent dot set slot to two we don't want to over place the items then we're gonna make the agent place fertilizer two is left so we're gonna do agent dot place left then we're gonna copy this because we have to do it a lot of times i'm going to copy this okay right here you also need to do tab because it's in the well in the function okay makes the plants go faster so yeah the bone meal when the agent used a bone marrow made the the plant grow immediately into a full road trip with a lot like i'll say like six bombings i think yeah okay next we're gonna talk to the developer again and then the developer says i need to get the aeg to remove all the rocks after which it should chill the sore implant stop itself however each time we run the code the agent just walks right into the rocks without breaking giving by some coaching problem we're going to try to help the developer to get the at9 to walk right into the rocks and do that yeah and do nothing and blink its head you don't want to engage it together okay so first robot define function called destroy okay then we'll make the agent destroyed block forward we did that destroy forward because when i destroy the stone block that is forward right here okay then we're going to make the unit move forward how many times one two so i can plant because there's actually dirt under the stove so block gonna do agent dot move forward one time and here we're gonna do four i in range twelve times so it's a replica if agent dot inspect so it's a function agent inspection inspection dot block so the agent will try to inspect the block all the way forward because the um stone is forward of it yeah forward then we need to search for its specific block equals equals stone then we're going to call function for removing rocks which is destroy someone destroy the rock then here else else if there is no rock though move forward agent don't move forward one time so right now we're not planting yet we're just destroying the rocks and going to the end which is a good one go ahead go go oh the agent uses his hands yeah how powerful it's like it it's like awesome creative mode you can show any block with one hit okay now when you after we do the stone we apply it okay so now part two here i'm gonna declare function to death plant now we have to plant then here an agent move forward agent dot move forward forward we did the forward so the agent will be ahead of the dirt block well the brass block and then your till to make it a dirt block it's so cool it tilts yeah so we can plant then the agent dot place the seed back okay then here bottom after the destroyer we're doing lf which is elsa lf alif agent dot inspect a agent inspection inspection dot block down now equals equals grass so now we are searching for the grass block underneath the agent then we're going to do here and a call function for planting trees so we're going to plant right there and then the elves okay now we're in the right go agent go go ages 12. that's cool yeah because it destroys the block the stone block while planting yes and it's also pretty cool when it chills backward because there's like he's like they just so cool he just chills backward without looking yeah well that's how robot is actually okay cool robot mixer goes here and talk to the third developer there's so many developers free developers yeah they're on all the activities the developer says help i'm trying to get the agent to plant saplings on tilled soil on a small pasture however there's nothing wrong with my coat the agent does not cover the whole area okay this is a big area so first this part we need the agent to move all cleanly row by row and then go to the gold block and the second part you'll need a plant and stuff oh that's much harder but first let's clear this one so the agent's going to be planting it walking along let's hope his feet will not grow sore it's a robot okay so first here i'm going to declare function one def let's see move yes it's just moving this part forward okay so one row is one two three four five six seven eight nine so it's nine blocks okay but the second row is going to be ten because you know you didn't stand in the first block two three four five six seven eight nine yeah you're right okay so here back here it's gonna return that move okay then here i'm gonna do i'm gonna do death here down here underscore right okay so it's another function so make the agent turn right because the function is called turn right so agent forgot direction agent dot move forward one time okay and you turn right again agent so this is like the code for when the agent needs to go to the edge of a row then you said turn right okay now here i make another function def left direction not left okay so we're turning left move forward keep that move forward one time up to the d needs to capitalize and then finally here major dot turn left again it's basically the same as term right right one but it's just the turns are left and the um name is the right one is turn right and the left one is left turn okay here dude four i in range range four times oh yeah sometimes i just typical call function makes the patient move forward just turn right yeah then here the four iron range it's actually two rows so one two three four so that's great now go ahead go go go it's like it's a race it's arms and legs are moving so it's when it's moving so fast it looks like it's wheels yeah it's like flash okay part two part two agent won't run as fast because you need to still implant anyone else okay so now it's gonna do it's cool move till back again oh that's so cool up here right here and add to here if agent dot inspect project dot respect
