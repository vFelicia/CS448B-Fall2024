00:00 - welcome to cutting with kids my name is
00:04 - andrew today we're in scratch and
00:05 - andrew's account star scratch cat so
00:07 - today i'm going to show you my project
00:09 - called imposter fishing so this is an
00:11 - original project so let's show you it
00:14 - first hand
00:16 - and attack
00:18 - and tap
00:20 - to get the hook down and try to catch
00:23 - the imposters which are flying through
00:26 - the space the reminders
00:28 - okay so now let's see the code so first
00:31 - this is my material sheet where i've got
00:33 - all the sprites and this is player which
00:36 - is you trying to catch imposters flying
00:38 - for a space and the imposter tail
00:41 - all these are decorations and the hook
00:43 - you're going to use to go
00:46 - for the hook to go down and casting
00:48 - postures so here when greenbelt
00:50 - collector will go to its original
00:52 - position which is here
00:54 - x35 and y35 then when space keeps steady
00:57 - flowing
00:59 - glide one second
01:01 - to x 30 and y negative 69 which will be
01:05 - go down to the hook will go down then it
01:08 - will glide one second to where it
01:10 - started which is x-34 and y-44 so go
01:13 - down and then go up like around the hook
01:15 - and wait one second so you can't just
01:17 - like keep spamming the hook and keep
01:19 - getting close then posture one is at
01:22 - first impossible so when greenfield
01:24 - clicked it'll set the timer variable to
01:26 - zero then it will forever change timer
01:30 - by one so each second the timer goes up
01:32 - by one
01:33 - then four
01:34 - then if timer equals 60 which is a
01:38 - minute it'll stop oh
01:40 - the game will stop then wait one second
01:43 - and keep going to add only one
01:46 - to the timer every second
01:48 - then here when greenfield collector
01:50 - forever show
01:52 - and go to 186
01:55 - y
01:56 - negative 72 which is over here so this
01:59 - this is like the starting line if it
02:00 - were a race
02:02 - then apply 3.5 seconds to negative 210 y
02:07 - negative 85 so go to the other side of
02:10 - screen
02:11 - hide and then you go back to starting
02:13 - show and repeat so keep going from space
02:17 - means the same for all the other
02:19 - imposters
02:20 - except
02:23 - please exhaust for this one bring that
02:24 - clip set and pause this clock which is
02:27 - another variable to zero
02:29 - which is basically your score and
02:31 - forever if touching hook so if the
02:33 - imposter touches the hook no change in
02:36 - plus is caught by one and then go to
02:39 - x 186 y negative 72 which is basically
02:42 - its starting position
02:44 - it's the same for all the other
02:46 - imposters but like different coordinates
02:49 - yeah so there are 10 imposters
02:51 - so i don't want them to all like
02:54 - like just go at the same time it'll be
02:57 - very easy to get score because you just
02:59 - need to press at the right times and
03:00 - you'll get all of them then so i added a
03:03 - weight and then the weight this
03:06 - weight seconds is different for all the
03:08 - imposters
03:11 - so here it's one second this is 0.5 and
03:15 - 2.5 and it'll all be different okay
03:19 - and that there are ten imposters
03:21 - and what there's no white imposter
03:24 - because you don't want to attack
03:25 - yourself you can pass the version
03:27 - yourself
03:28 - okay so now i'm gonna go first for me
03:31 - first 30 seconds
03:32 - and i see that if you're in schools
03:34 - you'll still get it so you don't need to
03:36 - care about why
03:37 - lime and brown
03:38 - all the others need to go down
03:42 - well i can see that um you know blue is
03:44 - like going up
03:46 - because if it doesn't go up it will like
03:48 - be impossible to get it
03:50 - it's the most bottom
03:53 - um
03:56 - five more seconds
03:58 - 700
04:02 - [Music]
04:04 - i hate dark green it's just so hard to
04:06 - get ah mistaken red for dark green i'm
04:10 - trying to get dark green
04:12 - yay
04:14 - we got that green yellow pink 15 seconds
04:19 - let's see if we can get a thousand score
04:22 - yes we can we already got about this
04:25 - goal
04:26 - i wonder if anybody who ever plays this
04:28 - will ever get two thousand it'll be
04:31 - hours
04:32 - impossible except there's six different
04:34 - hacks our score is one two nine eight
04:38 - which is one thousand two hundred and
04:40 - ninety eight yeah one 30 more seconds
04:42 - okay
04:44 - 30 more seconds
04:46 - imposter
04:49 - fishing fishing fish
04:52 - it's like just fishing but in space and
04:54 - you have fish
04:55 - i wonder how the imposters can fly maybe
04:58 - they get ejected and then like they had
05:00 - a boost and then they fly through this
05:03 - this crewmate's um house or whatever
05:07 - it lives in and then it says i hate
05:09 - imposters amazing maybe they're here to
05:12 - eliminate me then
05:14 - um so this white crew mate got a fishing
05:17 - hook and then always when there's
05:20 - impostors there it'll fish the imposters
05:23 - and say
05:26 - well that was fun and that's it for
05:29 - today thank you for watching remember to
