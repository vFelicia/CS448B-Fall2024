00:00 - welcome to cutting with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in
00:05 - timecraft So today we're gonna do this
00:07 - one with the computer and the question
00:10 - mark so let's
00:12 - get brief
00:14 - yeah
00:19 - I I haven't detected a Time split in the
00:22 - 18s that have erased computer programs
00:26 - from history this is around the time the
00:28 - first computer scientist reveals her
00:29 - program to the world we need to go to
00:31 - London England and debug this issue so
00:34 - let's enter pot and press button
00:37 - time jumping in three two one
00:42 - residents one London England
00:45 - 1800s computer scientist no this can't
00:49 - be my program isn't working it worked
00:51 - perfectly before but I must present my
00:53 - program tomorrow but it will take weeks
00:55 - to make new Punch Cards what am I going
00:57 - to do
00:59 - Tara oh no the color must have altered
01:02 - the punch card in her computer there on
01:03 - the desk we must help her fix her Punch
01:06 - Cards let's take a closer look move
01:08 - towards the desk this is a desk
01:11 - that's the computer too the punch card
01:14 - is inside of the computer you can't fix
01:16 - it directly but your time agent can
01:18 - shrink down and repair for you press the
01:20 - button to zoom in on the punch card so
01:22 - you can give your time ancient
01:23 - instructions to fix it so this is the
01:26 - button press oh we're inside enough
01:29 - you're now zoomed in and looking down on
01:31 - the punch card let's color our time each
01:33 - and make the right holes in the punch
01:35 - card oh so this is the punch card start
01:38 - start activity
01:40 - so if agent got super small yeah let's
01:43 - use code to punch holes in the car to
01:45 - create the right program so right now
01:48 - when you punch the brown blocks that are
01:51 - in front of our agent
01:53 - so someone filled in the computer
01:55 - scientists Punch Cards that contained
01:58 - the instructions for the first algorithm
01:59 - code your agent to destroy the brown
02:01 - blocks to make the cards work okay so
02:04 - our agents right there and we need to
02:07 - destroy these brown box
02:09 - of code
02:11 - so agent have to move forward and then
02:13 - destroy down
02:16 - down and repeat it three times
02:23 - three times
02:30 - three times
02:33 - and then let's run it
02:36 - one two
02:39 - oh yeah we have to move one more forward
02:41 - so let's
02:44 - do
02:45 - this
02:46 - move forward
02:52 - so I say move two and then now when you
02:55 - do the other half yes go to the brown
02:58 - block so we move right two times
03:03 - agent move
03:06 - right
03:07 - two times
03:13 - one two so right now when you do it
03:16 - backwards yeah so let's get this away
03:18 - and then the agent destroyed down first
03:21 - and then we need to move backwards two
03:24 - times and then we need to repeat this
03:26 - three times
03:28 - so I can punch all the holes
03:32 - destroy destroy the shore
03:33 - congratulations time split repair now
03:37 - we're out great job your time agent has
03:39 - now returned to its normal size there is
03:42 - a dig streak yeah you're a scientist how
03:44 - on Earth my punch card is fixed I can
03:47 - finally review the first computer
03:48 - program to the world can you see me can
03:51 - you see me amazing work you prepare this
03:53 - moment in time don't you think it's
03:55 - funny how I use coding to save coding oh
03:58 - that actually I didn't what if it didn't
04:00 - work then how did we even go here
04:04 - here it doesn't really make sense yeah
04:05 - detect it oh the saw right here yeah
04:09 - press it it's probably it's the bed
04:13 - yeah fine secret you found the secret
04:17 - room take note of which time ages you
04:19 - see here and head back to the inside so
04:21 - there's Yeti and Gremlin okay Gremlin is
04:24 - always so suss because he's really cool
04:28 - grind me and Yeti too it's a Yeti and
04:31 - Mission time jumping in three two hi
04:37 - okay we're back
04:39 - let's pick ground Gremlin understood
04:42 - we'll keep a close watch on the agent
04:46 - so in this times Craft series we've
04:50 - completed all of them like all of these
04:52 - coding challenges and let's look at all
04:55 - of the
04:58 - things from our Victory so this is the
05:01 - last one the science this is the
05:04 - dinosaur this is the bear pet this is
05:09 - the punch car we did today one zero zero
05:13 - one zero punch punch
05:15 - this is wait which one is this I think
05:19 - it was the car one this one's the Mona
05:22 - Lisa this one's the Wall of China this
05:25 - is Apollo 11. this is the Pyramid of
05:28 - Giza and this is the first trumpet one
05:32 - so we completed all of it
05:34 - all of them
05:36 - well that was fun and that's it for
05:39 - today thank you for watching Remember to
05:42 - smash the like button and subscribe bye
05:45 - bye
