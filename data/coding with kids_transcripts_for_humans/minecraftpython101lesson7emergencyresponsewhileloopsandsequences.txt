00:00 - welcome to curtin with kids my name
00:03 - is education
00:13 - to help in emergency situations are too
00:15 - dangerous for humans right now we're
00:17 - still in a testing phase with simulated
00:19 - disaster requirements however as soon as
00:22 - the code is finished the agent could be
00:23 - deployed in real world
00:25 - okay so
00:26 - in this lesson the agent i'm going to
00:28 - try to make the agent to help in natural
00:31 - disasters so first there's the emergency
00:34 - worker so the emergency worker says
00:36 - would it be possible to get your help i
00:38 - need a code that will
00:40 - make the agent build two block high wall
00:42 - to stop flood water you have a line of
00:44 - restaurant dust on the floor that the
00:46 - aliens should follow can you write such
00:48 - a code for me
00:49 - so first we need to try to code an agent
00:53 - to follow the trail of redstone and part
00:56 - one to the gold block
00:58 - okay
00:59 - [Music]
01:05 - so we have to help the um agent put
01:08 - blocks to block flood from flooding
01:11 - villages yeah so first we'll do wire
01:14 - agent dot attack
01:19 - trying to detect
01:22 - [Music]
01:24 - okay
01:25 - so while the agent detect would detect
01:28 - the function agent detection that
01:30 - redstone forward so while the agent
01:32 - detects redstone in front of it it will
01:37 - agent dot move
01:43 - [Music]
01:44 - so keep moving forward
01:52 - so the agent is following the path and
01:54 - goes to go back okay so now
01:56 - we're gonna make a wall to stop the
01:59 - flood water
02:00 - so it's just like um pretending it's
02:02 - flooding it's just testing so
02:05 - you can stop a place
02:08 - right
02:09 - so replace the block to its right and
02:12 - here
02:15 - move
02:16 - up
02:17 - one time one time
02:20 - and then agent that place right place
02:24 - right again so make a two block high
02:26 - wall then back down agent dot me down
02:31 - then two times
02:32 - [Music]
02:34 - so go back to the ground level move
02:36 - forward and build the next part of the
02:37 - wall
02:38 - okay now let's work
02:42 - here
02:47 - [Music]
02:48 - so it's placing the glocks
02:51 - it's maybe making a stone wall
02:55 - okay
02:57 - okay so
02:58 - now there's no more fluff yeah
03:01 - okay so now i'm gonna go to activity 2.
03:04 - so now i'm going to go talk to the farm
03:07 - so firemount says i need a coat that
03:09 - will give the agent the ability to build
03:11 - firebreaks on uneven terrain to stop the
03:13 - spread of fires the wall must be one
03:16 - block high and built out of conquer you
03:18 - have a line of restaurant dust over a
03:19 - terrain next to where the aegis place to
03:21 - walk to try to build
03:23 - a wall that will stop fires
03:26 - first
03:31 - [Music]
03:57 - agent dot
03:58 - [Music]
04:11 - up
04:13 - [Music]
04:26 - place
04:29 - left again
04:31 - you just not move forward so continue
04:34 - the wall
04:35 - just stop
04:36 - move
04:39 - forward
04:40 - one time
04:42 - and then
04:43 - the end of move tools now we only need
04:46 - one tab
04:47 - here we do agent dot
04:50 - place
04:54 - left and then you drink that move
05:00 - move
05:03 - forward
05:04 - one time
05:06 - so now
05:07 - you're gonna run the code
05:17 - go agent
05:18 - now it's down in the wall
05:21 - okay so now we're finished
05:28 - the emergency worker so the emergency
05:31 - worker says i'm trying to make the agent
05:33 - build foundations for homes damaged by
05:35 - hurricanes however it is not working the
05:38 - agent needs to place the foundations
05:40 - within the restroom dust outlines can
05:42 - you write such a cool for me
05:44 - okay so first there's a door bed and
05:46 - like the outline of the house so we need
05:48 - to build one block wall around the
05:51 - redstone to make a house to appear a
05:54 - house
05:54 - after it's been destroyed by a
05:58 - heart
05:59 - okay
06:01 - so
06:02 - okay
06:05 - [Music]
06:09 - build the house okay so first
06:12 - let me do while
06:14 - agent dot
06:16 - dot detect
06:44 - one time to move on because
06:47 - the foundation only needs to be one
06:49 - block tall
06:50 - then we'll do a second while loop
06:54 - well
06:56 - you just don't detect
06:59 - right redstone again but it's going to
07:02 - be in the left
07:07 - the forward has to be left
07:09 - forward has to be left and the agent's
07:12 - detection
07:14 - the second one
07:17 - [Music]
07:43 - agent dot oops two tabs
07:46 - [Music]
07:47 - dot move
07:49 - forward
07:51 - one time two times
07:52 - [Music]
07:54 - so now
08:00 - [Music]
08:06 - yeah foundation
08:07 - [Music]
08:09 - okay
08:10 - it's been a pretty good house
08:13 - it's kind of a simple house too yeah
08:15 - okay now we finished building a small
08:17 - house
08:18 - here next to part two we're gonna build
08:21 - a bigger house
08:23 - [Music]
08:32 - only one time because end of while loop
08:35 - one i mean while loop two so we're gonna
08:38 - do
08:38 - while loop three so wall
08:41 - agent
08:43 - talk detect
08:45 - [Music]
08:48 - boom
08:53 - [Music]
09:02 - redstone
09:05 - right
09:06 - [Music]
09:09 - so the part one already build these
09:11 - these first speaker
09:13 - so our living room
09:14 - then
09:16 - we'll do two tabs now
09:18 - i'm gonna make the agent place the block
09:20 - to its left so we're going to do agent
09:22 - dot place
09:24 - left
09:26 - then
09:28 - it did not move forward
09:32 - one time
09:33 - because the house only needs to be one
09:36 - block well the foundation only needs to
09:38 - be one block top okay one time then
09:41 - agent
09:42 - dot
09:43 - place
09:46 - will do left again
09:49 - did you move back
09:51 - you just don't move
09:54 - back one time one time
09:57 - and then finally
09:59 - we're gonna do agent dot turn right
10:01 - agent
10:02 - turn
10:06 - [Music]
10:17 - house
10:18 - because that one is more simple so it's
10:20 - made out of
10:23 - [Music]
10:26 - okay so we need to fix the code
10:29 - so here
10:31 - [Music]
10:34 - i turn then you need it return then
10:37 - agent i'll place left
10:39 - right yeah i have to return right
10:43 - um
10:57 - [Music]
10:58 - move forward
11:01 - one time
11:03 - one time
11:05 - so now i'm going to try to run it again
11:09 - first
11:10 - we need to
11:12 - restart
11:13 - [Music]
11:22 - okay
11:28 - [Music]
11:37 - so there's like go and go out so the
11:40 - room is not just square
11:43 - now it's building the bedroom because
11:45 - there's a bed the living room or the big
11:47 - room doesn't have a bed so
11:50 - so this is just for a
11:52 - maybe a one person because it's just
11:54 - oh there's only one that i had yeah but
11:57 - it's a big place for a one person to
11:59 - live maybe like he needs to score a lot
12:01 - of students
12:02 - well after hiking um yeah now there's
12:06 - rockets yeah fireworks okay so we
12:08 - completed it this house is pretty fancy

12:13 - first house is pretty simple
12:15 - [Music]
12:16 - here i even saw that um the first house
12:19 - has not really good floor but the second
12:22 - house has better floor yeah and their
12:24 - bed colors are different
12:26 - well that was fun and that's it for
12:29 - today thank you for watching remember to

agent that place right place right again so make a two block high wall then back down agent dot me down then two times so go back to the ground level move forward and build the next part of the wall okay now let's work here so it's placing the glocks it's maybe making a stone wall okay okay so now there's no more fluff yeah okay so now i'm gonna go to activity 2. so now i'm going to go talk to

you have a line of restaurant dust over a terrain next to where the aegis place to walk to try to build a wall that will stop fires first agent dot up place left again you just not move forward so continue the wall just stop move forward one time and then the end of move tools now we only need one tab here we do agent dot place left and then you drink that move move forward one time so now you're gonna run the code go agent now it's down in the wall okay so now we're finished the emergency worker so the emergency worker says i'm trying to make the agent build foundations for homes damaged by hurricanes however it is not working the agent needs to place the foundations within the restroom dust outlines can you write such a cool for me okay so first there's a door bed and like the outline of the house so we need to build one block wall around the redstone to make a house to appear a house after it's been destroyed by a heart okay so okay build the house okay so first let me do while agent dot dot detect one time to move on because the foundation only needs to be one block tall then we'll do a second while loop well you just don't detect right redstone again but it's going to be in the left the forward has to be left forward has to be left and the agent's detection the second one agent dot oops two tabs dot move forward one time two times so now yeah foundation okay it's been a pretty good house it's kind of a simple house too yeah okay now we finished building a small house here next to part two we're gonna build a bigger house only one time because end of while loop one i mean while loop two so we're gonna do while loop three so wall agent talk detect boom redstone right so the part one already build these these first speaker so our living room then we'll do two tabs now i'm gonna make the agent place the block to its left so we're going to do agent dot place left then it did not move forward one time because the house only needs to be one block well the foundation only needs to be one block top okay one time then agent dot place will do left again did you move back you just don't move back one time one time and then finally we're gonna do agent dot turn right agent turn house because that one is more simple so it's made out of okay so we need to fix the code so here i turn then you need it return then agent i'll place left right yeah i have to return right um move forward one time one time so now i'm going to try to run it again first we need to restart okay so there's like go and go out so the room is not just square now it's building the bedroom because there's a bed the living room or the big room doesn't have a bed so so this is just for a maybe a one person because it's just oh there's only one that i had yeah but it's a big place for a one person to live maybe like he needs to score a lot of students well after hiking um yeah now there's rockets yeah fireworks okay so we completed it this house is pretty fancy better than the first house yeah the first house is pretty simple here i even saw that um the first house has not really good floor but the second house has better floor yeah and their bed colors are
