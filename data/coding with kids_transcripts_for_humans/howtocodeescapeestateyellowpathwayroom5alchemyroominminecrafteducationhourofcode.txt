00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in
00:05 - Minecraft education Edition and in the
00:07 - Isle of code Escape esting so in the
00:10 - last video we made the agent open the
00:12 - yellow door for us and now we are gonna
00:14 - go into the yellow door bye bye so now
00:19 - let's see what room we get teleport
00:22 - loading
00:24 - yellow
00:26 - bricks
00:30 - agent wait before you go I need to tell
00:32 - you one last thing this house is built
00:34 - of Escape rooms you'll need to find clue
00:37 - soft puzzles and fix cool to make your
00:39 - way up pressing to review the puzzles
00:41 - code round the code to see what happens
00:43 - and there are errors fix the code and
00:45 - run like it again to test it this is
00:47 - called
00:48 - sometimes Solutions won't be clear and
00:51 - not all puzzles will take code to solve
00:53 - when you find the positive remembering
00:55 - to run the code first to see what's
00:57 - wrong then deep up and fix the faulty
00:59 - it's much easier than writing code from
01:02 - scratch do you have an IR for closer is
01:04 - particles to help guide you okay so
01:06 - let's go search room for particles first
01:08 - let's explore the University
01:11 - so there's like wool here and then there
01:14 - are like the dispensers above the wool
01:17 - and then there's a school
01:20 - entry five the ultimate
01:22 - dear diary as my journey through the
01:24 - manor continues I'm starting to see that
01:26 - this is no ordinary match for example
01:28 - today I found a room dedicated to make
01:30 - potions
01:32 - not something you see every day and yet
01:34 - I can't shake the feeling that I've been
01:35 - here before
01:36 - so this is a room where you make potions
01:39 - okay so let's put some particles right
01:46 - oh there's glass is there it's a agent
01:50 - thing I think it's a ball clay ball it's
01:54 - a brown okay let's go to cook
01:59 - the ball to the gold blocks so it can
02:01 - open up the door to the next section use
02:03 - the clay ball move function to navigate
02:05 - the ball through the wall
02:07 - you can do it up down left and right
02:09 - okay so this is a cool example it won't
02:11 - solve it for us but just show us what it
02:14 - do it goes left and then right okay so
02:17 - when you make it on top of the gold
02:19 - blocks and there's a door right there so
02:22 - we need to move the clay ball all the
02:25 - way to on top so let's go back to coding
02:28 - and so this is the same thing but it's
02:32 - just like in a repeat Loop you can use
02:34 - sure to code to do the same thing as
02:36 - long
02:37 - okay so let's see what we have to do so
02:40 - first I think we need to do the left to
02:42 - be next to the gold block I think
02:44 - actually we have to like move the whole
02:47 - whole round
02:50 - so like go here and it go up move and
02:54 - then go down oh yeah because the barrels
02:57 - are blocking the first one it goes to
03:00 - right to be next to the wall so when you
03:02 - go right two times
03:03 - so clay about move right two times
03:06 - already did that but then we have to
03:07 - change it to move up and see how many
03:10 - times one to move up two times
03:15 - so clay ball
03:18 - move
03:20 - up two times
03:26 - okay
03:28 - so now let's test it
03:30 - let's see so right okay now all we need
03:33 - to do is reach the door which is left
03:37 - one two three four four times so we can
03:41 - do the
03:42 - um we can do the repeat Loop so we don't
03:45 - need to use that much code
03:47 - so for Iron Range four to repeat it four
03:50 - times we will do a clay ball move left
03:53 - so it can move left four times
03:56 - so now let's see
03:59 - so now when you go one block down so you
04:02 - can reach the handle the
04:08 - now remember to delete the tab yeah
04:13 - move down so now we should we completed
04:17 - it
04:18 - is soft
04:21 - do not open the door and then went
04:22 - through the door so now there's another
04:24 - puzzle very cute what is it clay Gollum
04:27 - it became a gold
04:29 - it has a weird face it has a weird face
04:32 - it's another pressure plates
04:34 - okay let's see what we need to do
04:35 - another right block okay
04:38 - Pitfall whoa legs no one rolling over
04:41 - for the skull we need to help it's we
04:44 - need to help it safely navigate to the
04:46 - gold ball when the Golem moves onto the
04:48 - pressure plate the block it needs
04:51 - retracts for retracts for a moment if we
04:54 - wait it seems to come back you see move
04:56 - column forward function to move the
04:58 - column and the weight function to make
05:00 - it wait for the block to come back so
05:02 - it's like when we press the like go on
05:05 - top of the pressure plate the block will
05:07 - go down so if we keep on moving forward
05:09 - the clay Golem will fall down so we have
05:12 - to wait for the block to come back up
05:16 - okay so let's see what this code does
05:18 - okay
05:19 - okay moves forward
05:23 - until another word block comes back
05:26 - okay
05:27 - now so there are Pistons that move the
05:29 - netheroid boss activated by the pressure
05:32 - plates so you can wait for the Red Zone
05:35 - signal from the pressure plate to stop
05:36 - then the block will come back okay so
05:39 - let's go back
05:40 - okay so go here so
05:43 - um the first one move forward this code
05:46 - works and then we have to move forward
05:48 - again two times so the next pressure
05:50 - plate
05:51 - so we can actually just repeat this two
05:54 - times and then move column forward one
05:56 - more time so we can delete this
05:59 - way
06:01 - okay and then we do the
06:05 - repeat Loop
06:07 - for eye in range
06:10 - two times
06:12 - and then add tabs so we can make it
06:15 - inside the repeat Loop so be repeated
06:20 - um these code for two times
06:25 - okay then we just need a move column
06:28 - forward one more time
06:33 - remove column forward okay so now let's
06:38 - see wait wait the block comes back three
06:42 - seconds three one two three okay
06:46 - I'll still need one more oh wait right
06:49 - oh we need to move one more time oopsies
06:54 - move column
06:56 - forward
06:59 - so now let's run it and then we should
07:01 - we should reach to this one two
07:04 - blue
07:06 - one two three
07:10 - puzzle saw oh it went away
07:15 - go I went through another one it's
07:19 - called it's over here it has a whole
07:20 - body now wow now there's like a recipe
07:24 - okay let's search room for particles
07:30 - Nether wart
07:32 - fermented spider eye and Phantom
07:35 - membrane these are all uh ingredients in
07:37 - certain potions oh wait the recipe
07:41 - over here oh it shows how much we need
07:44 - of each just the steps okay
07:48 - we delete this
07:54 - okay just delete this and then delete
07:58 - this
08:00 - and then attack
08:05 - it smells
08:07 - like one
08:10 - two and then three oh green green so now
08:15 - there's stuff coming out
08:18 - sick and to the next room so we solve
08:21 - the room
08:23 - so is I oh why is there air up there
08:26 - that's cool
08:28 - it's like air conditioning or something
08:30 - okay
08:32 - say goodbye to the club bye oh there's
08:35 - air oh it's for us to levitate to go up
08:39 - here
08:40 - oh so now it's the next room in the next
08:43 - video we're gonna enter this door
08:47 - well that was fun and that's it for
08:50 - today thank you for watching Remember to
08:52 - smash the like button and subscribe bye
08:55 - bye

welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in Minecraft education Edition and in the Isle of code Escape esting so in the last video we made the agent open the yellow door for us and now we are gonna go into the yellow door bye bye so now let's see what room we get teleport loading yellow bricks agent wait before you go I need to tell you one last thing this house is built of Escape rooms you'll need to find clue soft puzzles and fix cool to make your way up pressing to review the puzzles code round the code to see what happens and there are errors fix the code

this is a cool example it won't solve it for us but just show us what it do it goes left and then right okay so when you make it on top of the gold blocks and there's a door right there so we need to move the clay ball all the way to on top so let's go back to coding and so this is the same thing but it's just like in a repeat Loop you can use sure to code to do the same thing as long okay so let's see what we have to do so first I think we need to do the left to be next to the gold block I think actually we have to like move the whole whole round so like go here and it go up move and then go down oh yeah because the barrels are blocking the first one it goes to right to be next to the wall so when you go right two times so clay about move right two times already did that but then we have to change it to move up and see how many times one to move up two times so clay ball move up two times okay so now let's test it let's see so right okay now all we need to do is reach the door

move left so it can move left four times so now let's see so now when you go one block down so you can reach the handle the now remember to delete the tab yeah move down so now we should we completed it is soft do not open the door and then went through the door so now there's another puzzle very cute what is it clay Gollum it became a gold it has a weird face it has a weird face it's another pressure plates okay let's see what we need to do another right block okay Pitfall whoa legs no one rolling over for the skull we need to help it's we need to help it safely navigate to the gold ball when the Golem moves onto the pressure plate the block it needs retracts for retracts for a moment if we wait it seems to come back you see move column forward function to move the column and the weight function to make it wait for the block to come back so it's like when we press the like go on top of the pressure plate the block will go down so if we keep on moving forward the clay Golem will fall down so we have to wait for the block to come back up okay so let's see what this code does okay okay moves forward until another word block comes back okay now so there are Pistons that move the netheroid boss activated by the pressure plates so you can wait for the Red Zone signal from the pressure plate to stop then the block will come back okay so let's go back okay so go here so

more time so we can delete this way okay and then we do the repeat Loop for eye in range two times and then add tabs so we can make it inside the repeat Loop so be repeated um these code for two times okay then we just need a move column forward one more time remove column forward okay so now let's see wait wait the block comes back three seconds three one two three okay I'll still need one more oh wait right oh we need to move one more time oopsies move column forward so now let's run it and then we should we should reach to this one two blue one two three puzzle saw oh it went away go I went through another one it's called it's over here it has a whole body now wow now there's like a recipe okay let's search room for particles Nether wart fermented spider eye and Phantom membrane these are all uh ingredients in certain potions oh wait the recipe over here oh it shows how much we need of each just the steps okay we delete this okay just delete this and then delete this and then attack it smells like one two and then three oh green green so now there's stuff coming out sick and to the next room so we solve the room so is I oh why is there air up there that's cool it's like air conditioning or something okay say goodbye to the club bye oh there's air oh it's for us to levitate to go up here oh so now it's the next room in the next video we're gonna enter this door well
