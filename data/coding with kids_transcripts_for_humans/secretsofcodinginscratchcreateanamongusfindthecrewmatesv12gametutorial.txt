00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:04 - andrew today is watching andrew's
00:06 - techno468 today i'm going to show you my
00:08 - project called find the crewmates
00:10 - version 1.2 so this is the second
00:13 - version
00:14 - so i added some view rules
00:18 - okay so
00:19 - first i had i changed the news on to a
00:22 - new song
00:24 - then i also changed
00:25 - and i added a thumbnail as you can see
00:27 - here so in green flat clicked it'll go
00:30 - to front layer and then it'll show wait
00:32 - three seconds and hides it up here for
00:34 - 30 seconds until you can start the game
00:36 - so adding roles like engineer
00:39 - and scientist so mr cheese and white are
00:42 - engineers
00:43 - so engineers can vent in a manga so here
00:46 - in this project they will disappear so
00:49 - in green five click they'll set event
00:51 - variables to zero forever set vent
00:54 - to pick a random one to two so vent will
00:57 - have
00:58 - one or two in it and then if vent equals
01:01 - two then it'll hide wait 15 seconds this
01:04 - year so basically you vent for 15
01:05 - seconds
01:07 - else if vent is one then it'll just wait
01:10 - 10 seconds because you don't want it to
01:11 - keep
01:12 - um
01:13 - pick a random one to two or it'll just
01:15 - keep appearing disappear
01:17 - for white is the same but it's just
01:19 - changed a variable
01:21 - for yellow yellow is a scientist so
01:24 - scientists can look at vitals and they
01:26 - can see if you if who is the imposter so
01:30 - when this right click so when you
01:32 - eliminate yellow the change is
01:34 - scientists dead by one which is a
01:36 - variable so we're going for a click a
01:39 - switch backdrop to looking such which is
01:41 - a paulus backdrop
01:43 - so i changed it so it is scientists
01:46 - eliminated to zero
01:48 - and then we wait 10 seconds so you have
01:50 - seven seconds to eliminate the
01:52 - scientists because a thumbnail takes
01:54 - three
01:55 - seconds to disappear so if scientist
01:57 - eliminated equals one they'll switch
02:00 - backtrack to win
02:01 - which is a windscreen
02:04 - so there's you win and you lose
02:06 - so
02:09 - then i'll switch back to when it'll stop
02:11 - the game
02:12 - and else if scientist
02:15 - eliminated equals zero then switch
02:17 - backdrop to loose lose
02:19 - and stop all
02:22 - okay so now let's play each of us are
02:26 - gonna go do one turn okay
02:30 - andrea's going first yeah
02:39 - that's fast because they keep moving
02:41 - every half a second your turn
02:46 - [Music]
02:53 - you can't just click everywhere but i'm
02:56 - trying to track it down
02:57 - you can
02:58 - follow it with quick reactions
03:01 - i'm better and way better in touchscreen
03:08 - last time
03:16 - you eliminated yellow
