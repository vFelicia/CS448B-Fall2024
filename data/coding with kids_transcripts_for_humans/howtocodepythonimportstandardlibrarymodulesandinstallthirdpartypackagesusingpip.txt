00:00 - welcome to greeting with kids my name is
00:04 - andrew today we're going to teach you
00:06 - python so we're going to learn about the
00:08 - python standard library so my first
00:10 - question is what is the python standard
00:13 - library the python standard library is a
00:15 - lot of functions that help you code the
00:17 - library is split in up into modules what
00:20 - is a module a module is a code file for
00:23 - a specific thing
00:25 - what can you do
00:27 - with the python student library modules
00:30 - inside the python standard library can
00:32 - be used for lots of things like date
00:34 - time and math
00:36 - inside the python standard library then
00:39 - which one is better built in function or
00:41 - importing modules built-in functions are
00:44 - more commonly used so it's built into
00:46 - python some other features and functions
00:49 - are useful but they're not commonly used
00:52 - to use these features and functions you
00:55 - will need to do import
00:57 - third party packages which is a public
00:59 - library by other platform programmers
01:02 - you first need to download the module
01:04 - and then use the import command to use
01:06 - the functions and the pip command to
01:08 - download it
01:10 - now we're going to use a module from the
01:12 - python standard library use the import
01:15 - to tell
01:16 - python you're going to use a module
01:19 - so let's do
01:22 - let's do
01:24 - import random as dice so random is a
01:27 - module
01:28 - that is in play font so you don't need
01:30 - to use pip to download so
01:34 - you're all there's also a random command
01:36 - to like get random stuff so we're going
01:39 - to name random as dice
01:42 - so then we're going to do
01:44 - roll dice.rand 110 so randit is a
01:49 - function that is in the module random so
01:52 - return a random integer in 1 or 10.
01:56 - like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10. yeah so
02:01 - it's stored in the variable called rule
02:04 - so
02:05 - we're going to do print s string so we
02:07 - can put role in it which will print the
02:10 - number rand it chose you rolled then the
02:12 - number then rand it chose so let's save
02:15 - it with ctrl s
02:16 - and then write p y ran dot p y so now
02:21 - you roll six now let's try again yeah
02:24 - okay so you can up use up arrow to copy
02:27 - what you last typed so it says you
02:29 - rolled one so it worked because first we
02:32 - wrote a sixth and a one yeah so randa
02:35 - chose a random number for between one
02:37 - and ten let's try one last time
02:40 - it says you rolled a four six one four
02:45 - there's no pattern oh there is a pattern
02:48 - it's even odd even
02:51 - okay now we're at
02:53 - pipi.org here at this website you can
02:57 - find all the modules in the third in
03:02 - in this huge library
03:04 - made by python programmers so
03:07 - yeah so now i'm going to search camel
03:09 - case which is the module we're going to
03:11 - be re trying out
03:16 - a lot of people have made camel cases
03:18 - yeah so we're going to go to camera case
03:20 - here this one
03:22 - so
03:23 - what camel case does is that well the
03:26 - function camel case inside the module
03:28 - camera case will
03:30 - capitalize each
03:32 - starting letter of each word
03:35 - so let's go to python again
03:38 - and then do
03:40 - go here to terminal and pip install
03:44 - chairs
03:49 - so now it's downloading it
03:51 - and now we have downloaded it
03:56 - so now we're going to import camelcase
03:58 - because we already downloaded it so we
04:01 - can use it now so import will tell
04:03 - python we're using camo case
04:06 - okay
04:06 - then
04:08 - c equals camelcase camel case so this
04:11 - camera case is the function
04:14 - while this one is the module name
04:17 - so
04:18 - let's do txt use hello world txt that
04:22 - means text yeah and then
04:25 - print c hump hump is another function
04:29 - text
04:30 - so
04:32 - now let's save it
04:33 - and run it
04:37 - let's do p y
04:39 - camo dot p
04:54 - cd
05:00 - [Music]
05:09 - dot py so now it says hello world so it
05:13 - was different from the text one because
05:16 - in the text variable the hello world did
05:19 - not have any capital letters but when we
05:21 - run it
05:22 - it also printed it so there the capital
05:26 - the first letter of each word became
05:29 - capitalized
05:30 - okay so let's change the hello world
05:33 - into
05:36 - la la la
05:46 - so there's no capital and let's see if
05:48 - it will print
05:50 - capital
05:51 - okay
05:52 - let's run it this is hollywood because
05:54 - if i can just save it
05:56 - and then run it
05:59 - because there's a live
06:01 - lib
06:05 - and now save it
06:11 - so this is i love hamburgers
06:16 - so they're all capitalized again okay it
06:19 - worked okay let's finally
06:22 - do
06:24 - pip list
06:27 - so pip list will list all the modules
06:30 - you have on your python
06:34 - now i list a bunch of them
06:36 - okay let's go to c
06:38 - and then
06:41 - there's camel case
06:43 - and then it also says is version came
06:45 - okay
06:46 - okay let's go back and pip install
06:49 - camera vip uninstall
06:53 - and then
06:55 - install
06:56 - camera okay so now we're uninstalling it
07:00 - hit enter then you can
07:02 - y to yes
07:04 - now it's successfully uninstalled
07:08 - okay let's do pip
07:10 - list again
07:12 - so let's see if camelcase is not in this
07:14 - list
07:16 - i think you see
07:18 - nope so this is a start and camera case
07:21 - is supposed to be here but it's
07:24 - not there so because we installed it
07:26 - yeah uninstalled so we successfully
07:29 - uninstalled and thanks for watching
07:31 - that's it for today remember to smash
07:34 - and subscribe bye
