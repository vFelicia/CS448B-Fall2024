00:00 - welcome to quitting with kids my name is
00:03 - my name is andrew today we're in scratch
00:06 - and andrew's
00:07 - account starter scratch so starter
00:10 - scratch cat is an account
00:11 - for like easy scratchers and easy
00:14 - projects
00:15 - so today i'm going to show you my game
00:18 - maze game so it's a easy
00:20 - making yeah so this is for star scratch
00:24 - yeah so it's like starter code people so
00:27 - if you don't know
00:28 - much about code you can see my project
00:32 - and start a scratch cat
00:33 - so first there's this my sprite the
00:36 - orange cat so it's basically the scratch
00:39 - cat
00:39 - so it's the character the movie so when
00:42 - green flag clicked that means when you
00:44 - run it
00:44 - then set level to one so here's a
00:46 - variable level so it tells you what
00:48 - level you're on
00:49 - and then go to front layers that means
00:51 - it's right here that means this is the
00:53 - beginning of every maze
00:54 - and then set size to 15 so it's
00:57 - small enough to fit through the passages
01:00 - yeah
01:01 - and then go to x 10 wide
01:04 - minus 170 so that's also the start and
01:07 - then
01:08 - forever if key up arrow press and then
01:10 - change y by four
01:12 - if so this is programming
01:16 - um to move it with your arrow keys
01:20 - and then if touching maze then change y
01:22 - by negative
01:23 - four so it'll like you'll bounce
01:27 - off the maze so if you did not have that
01:31 - code in each of the
01:32 - arrow pressed then you can like simply
01:36 - go through everywhere and like you can
01:38 - go straight to the apple
01:40 - so yeah your goal is to get
01:43 - get to the apple and then another code
01:46 - is one great you can collect forever
01:48 - if punching apple that means your goal
01:50 - then place on cheer until then so that's
01:52 - the sound
01:53 - and say yay for two seconds and then
01:56 - go to 10 x y
02:00 - minus 170 so that's the beginning
02:03 - speakers so when you
02:04 - after it says yay it goes back to the
02:07 - beginning of the maze and then board has
02:09 - next may so it's a message and then
02:11 - change level by one
02:12 - so you go to level two let's go some
02:15 - mazes code
02:16 - so i uploaded the maze and look there's
02:19 - a little code
02:20 - so when green flag clicked switch
02:22 - costume to maze
02:23 - one so it's right now it's costume and
02:26 - then goes to x
02:27 - zero y zero so this big soul is like
02:31 - this
02:31 - and then when i receive next maze which
02:34 - is the message and nyx costume so
02:37 - costume there is eight costumes so that
02:40 - means eight
02:40 - levels okay then the apple
02:44 - so is this yeah and is one of the
02:48 - scratch sprites so i did not upload
02:50 - so when green flag clicks size to 25
02:54 - and then goes to x minus 10 y 170
02:58 - so that's right here and that's always
03:00 - where the end of the maze will be
03:02 - so now let's play so i'll play first
03:06 - so like you know
03:12 - because you played it already
03:15 - yeah played a lot of time so you know
03:17 - the answer is
03:23 - just like sometimes
03:30 - and then
03:43 - so when you're on level
03:52 - yay i don't know if the cat actually
03:54 - eats apples
03:58 - um
04:03 - [Applause]
04:06 - [Music]
04:12 - okay
04:18 - see i can't go through the bags yeah
04:22 - because i programmed it to change y and
04:25 - change
04:26 - x
04:31 - maybe it may be a little bit tricky
04:33 - because you need to find the right
04:35 - time to press your arrow keys
04:48 - [Music]
04:50 - level 5.
05:06 - yeah okay go go go go nope this is stuck
05:09 - it's gonna go
05:09 - down oh yeah
05:13 - maybe you remember every where you need
05:16 - to go
05:18 - i usually add music to my
05:24 - yay i'm on level six now
05:28 - six pounds
05:36 - over there
05:38 - [Music]
05:45 - [Music]
05:50 - the way to the apple okay i'm level
05:53 - seven
05:54 - so this is the left the second second
05:59 - level in here
06:06 - sometimes it might be hard because like
06:09 - you can't go through the wall
06:12 - [Applause]
06:21 - should you play it yes because this is
06:23 - actually
06:25 - using a lot of time i don't think you
06:28 - should play it yeah you won't play it
06:30 - you can play it sometime after and
06:34 - yeah i should play
06:39 - i'm in level eight okay yeah level nine
06:42 - is my turn
06:43 - because there is only one level you
06:45 - can't do all the mazes just do
06:47 - level nine which is basically level one
06:50 - because there is only eight maze
06:52 - costumes so there's only eight levels
06:55 - am i doing the right way oh yes yes
06:58 - i think so
07:02 - okay there you go
