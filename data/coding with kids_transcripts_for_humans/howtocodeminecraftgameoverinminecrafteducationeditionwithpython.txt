00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - andrew today we're in minecraft
00:05 - education edition and we're going to
00:07 - explain you the codes of game over so
00:11 - it's a tutorial
00:12 - well it's really an example yeah so
00:15 - until command game over so when you type
00:17 - game over and chat it will change game
00:19 - mode to survival which we are already in
00:22 - because you can see the hearts and
00:23 - hunger bars and experience points and if
00:25 - you are with other people and they
00:27 - change their emotes to creative then
00:29 - they'll be insurmountable everybody will
00:32 - live in survival then tell about all
00:34 - players
00:36 - first we're going to do all players
00:37 - they're all entities so we'll get all
00:40 - the moms have little things really near
00:43 - us then to zero
00:47 - zero
00:48 - negative one thousand zero which is the
00:51 - void in the end yeah we're like so deep
00:54 - yeah okay you're gonna be teleported i
00:57 - guess
00:58 - click down there then pause for a
01:01 - thousand milliseconds and then it will
01:03 - change gamo back to creative so you'll
01:04 - be like stuck in the board nothing to do
01:07 - like ah what do i do what do i do until
01:10 - you set um the mode back to survival so
01:13 - you can die that's why it's called game
01:15 - over yeah okay
01:18 - now let's see it in python
01:21 - so def on a chat so this is a function
01:24 - gameplay.set game mode
01:26 - to survival so mobs target all players
01:28 - so it gets survived mode for all players
01:31 - now teleport
01:33 - mods dot teleport to position
01:35 - mobs.target all players but you're
01:37 - sending zero negative of thousands so
01:39 - zero for all the players to um devoid
01:43 - yeah and then loop stop pause a thousand
01:45 - milliseconds so it'll pause
01:47 - for
01:48 - okay and then gameplay.set gamemode
01:50 - creative mods target all players so once
01:52 - we're
01:53 - it'll wait
01:54 - until you're in the void and then it
01:56 - will set your game mode to create it and
01:59 - then player that on channel when you
02:00 - type game over in the chat it'll run the
02:02 - function okay
02:04 - now let's try
02:06 - get ready are you ready yes okay then
02:10 - game over
02:12 - uh
02:14 - oh right when we were about to die this
02:17 - is the void this is not before the end
02:19 - yeah this is like
02:22 - maybe it's the super um sky maybe that's
02:25 - a very deep sky look if i drop it
02:28 - probably takes a very long time you
02:30 - can't see anything like anything
02:33 - you can only see the sun he's my friend
02:37 - except right now we set it to
02:39 - only day like always day so it will
02:42 - never be night
02:43 - yeah it's just greatness let's turn
02:45 - ourselves to survivor or elsewhere
02:47 - because we're actually falling
02:50 - it's gonna take a long time
02:52 - okay so
02:54 - we're gonna do set
02:57 - you can do chat command or um settings
03:01 - or in settings aren't code but and just
03:04 - going to
03:06 - what
03:07 - so you just automatically die
03:09 - [Music]
03:10 - respawn so this is like a former video
03:14 - yeah
03:15 - and we want to
03:30 - with us i have fun time you have free
03:33 - tickets to the void
03:36 - okay
03:38 - okay are you ready yep
03:41 - last time game over
03:46 - where did they uh oh they all they all
03:49 - fell no we forgot to do the
03:53 - we forgot to do oh yeah
03:55 - oh yeah we forget so we're gonna go here
03:58 - blocks and we're switch it to all
04:01 - entities

04:32 - three
04:33 - two one go
04:35 - oh they all just died automatically yeah
04:38 - we saw nothing we all died automatically
04:41 - i couldn't hear their sounds oh yeah i
04:43 - heard a spider i heard a lot of sounds
04:46 - and then it's
04:47 - all dye sounds and then they all just
04:49 - disappeared we couldn't even see the one
04:51 - i only really could hear a spider
04:54 - so i kind of heard like a scream maybe
04:56 - it's a ghast i guess yeah somehow
05:00 - it's like a screaming sound we even
05:03 - cleared all the um
05:04 - dropped like the drops oh these must be
05:08 - funny for us because they weren't close
05:09 - to us
05:10 - no i think they just spawned really yeah
05:14 - it's a baby sheep its head is really big
05:16 - yeah and it's like eating a lot
05:19 - the heads are the same size
05:23 - that's his third block and he's eaten
05:25 - okay so now you can see
05:27 - oh this is there's a lot of sheep the
05:30 - new because all the rabbits are gone
05:35 - but the beds are still there but these
05:37 - things we dropped and exploded i guess
05:40 - um are not here anymore yeah
05:42 - so if you drop an item in the board i
05:44 - wonder what happens to it probably just
05:46 - just disappears after you disappear from
05:49 - the end from the void
05:51 - okay well that was fun and that's it for
