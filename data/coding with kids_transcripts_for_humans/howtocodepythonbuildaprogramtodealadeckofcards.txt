00:00 - welcome to clinton with kids my name is
00:03 - kalia and my name is andrew
00:05 - today we're going to do python today
00:07 - we're going to deal a deck of cards for
00:09 - player 1 and player 2 using lists and
00:12 - nested 4 statements so first i'm going
00:14 - to do import
00:15 - random so import will tell by phone
00:17 - we're using the module and random is the
00:19 - module
00:20 - and in another video we also learned
00:22 - about the python standard library and
00:24 - what modules are this one do suits equal
00:27 - so it's just like a variable
00:29 - and then we have two square brackets
00:31 - which is the list
00:32 - and we have four items hearts spades
00:34 - clubs and diamonds and
00:36 - there's columns
00:39 - then so this is a list so then we'll
00:42 - make another list called
00:44 - ranks with the items two three four five
00:47 - six seven eight
00:47 - nine ten jack queen king and eight
00:51 - so with the list suits and ranks
00:55 - we're gonna make a deck of cards and
00:57 - restore those cards
00:59 - in the list deck so right now it's empty
01:02 - which has two square brackets only
01:06 - yeah next we're gonna do for suit and
01:07 - suit so this is a four step
01:09 - it's for each something in something so
01:13 - for each something that something is
01:16 - suit which is a variable
01:17 - like for the items so for each item in
01:22 - the list of suits we're going to do
01:24 - another for loop and then in the
01:26 - outer for rankin ranks
01:29 - so the first timer runs these two four
01:31 - statements
01:32 - it will be in the suits list it will be
01:35 - checking the item hearts
01:36 - and in the drank lists ranks list it
01:39 - will be checking
01:40 - the two item then it will do decta
01:43 - append astro
01:44 - rank of soup so a pen is a list helper
01:46 - function that will
01:48 - add an item to our list deck
01:52 - and we're going to add so first time it
01:54 - runs these and
01:55 - we'll add two of hearts to the deck and
01:58 - we're going to repeat that until the
02:00 - last card is ace of
02:01 - diamonds next we're going to do print
02:04 - s string there are latin deck cards in
02:07 - the deck
02:08 - so always be there are 52 cards in deck
02:11 - because in these four to four statements
02:14 - we're going to add
02:15 - 52 cards into the deck list
02:18 - so print there are 52 cards in the deck
02:21 - then i'm going to print dealing so it's
02:23 - like it's loading
02:24 - yeah that is just printing something no
02:28 - have two empty lists called play run and
02:30 - play two yeah andrew's the player one
02:32 - and i'm the player too
02:34 - so these two lists will store the deck
02:36 - or cards of player one and player two
02:39 - then while then player one is less than
02:42 - five so each player will have
02:44 - five cards so we only need to do one
02:46 - list so we just did player
02:48 - one so while player one
02:52 - and player two has less than five cards
02:55 - we're gonna make a variable called card
02:57 - equals random.choice deck so choice is a
03:00 - function inside the random module
03:02 - and i'll pick a random item or card from
03:05 - deck and that card will be stored inside
03:08 - the card variable
03:09 - then we're going to get that removed
03:10 - card so player 2
03:12 - or another player won't have the same
03:15 - card
03:16 - and we're gonna add that card to player
03:17 - one's deck so we're gonna do the same
03:19 - thing for player two except the card
03:21 - variable
03:22 - is card two and player one
03:26 - the one yeah we have two
03:29 - yeah player two then after we
03:33 - put the cards in the player's deck we're
03:36 - going to print a string there are land
03:37 - deck cards in the deck
03:39 - so each player has five five plus five
03:41 - is ten fifty two minus ten
03:43 - is forty two so we'll print there are 42
03:46 - cards in the deck
03:47 - and then let's get in print player one
03:48 - has the following cards in their hand
03:50 - and it will print
03:51 - player ones deck which is the list
03:53 - player one and i'll do that
03:54 - same for player two except that player
03:56 - one is player two and a princeton let's
03:58 - player 2.
03:59 - so let's say with ctrl s x let's see who
04:02 - has the
04:03 - better call
04:09 - so it did play everyone
04:13 - the following cards in the head ten of
04:15 - clubs queen of space
04:16 - i got two tens two ten of clubs and
04:20 - ten have done queen of diamonds i got
04:22 - two
04:23 - queens two one
04:26 - let's see what you have you have three
04:28 - of clubs
04:29 - two of clubs jackal spades nine of
04:31 - hearts ten of ones you've got no
04:33 - doubles i got the best cards let's do it
04:36 - again
04:37 - then i have seven parts king of clubs
04:41 - jack of hearts jack of clothes i got two
04:44 - jacks
04:45 - and then i got ten of hearts so i got
04:47 - one double
04:49 - player two has six of diamonds king of
04:51 - spades
04:52 - an excel club you got a double six yeah
04:55 - triple spades and
04:56 - six of hearts you got three six
04:59 - you got so much you got better but i'm
05:02 - not even
05:03 - six one more toy
05:07 - i'm old i got king of diamonds ten of

05:42 - win
05:43 - because that it uses the choice function
05:45 - yeah
05:46 - random don't know what kind of account
05:49 - yeah
05:50 - pretty
06:01 - that's a very cool and fun game right
