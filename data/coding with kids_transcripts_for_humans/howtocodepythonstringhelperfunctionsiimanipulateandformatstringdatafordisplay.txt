00:00 - welcome to coding with kids
00:03 - my name is kalia and my name is amy
00:05 - today we're gonna teach you python
00:07 - so today we're gonna learn about string
00:10 - helper functions so i'm gonna
00:12 - make a new folder file and i'm gonna
00:15 - name it helper2.py
00:20 - then we're going to message equals
00:24 - the quick brown fox
00:28 - jump over
00:31 - the lazy dog
00:34 - then we're gonna do print
00:38 - message dot message dot
00:42 - find two
00:45 - two so it's going to return
00:49 - the number of the position that the
00:51 - letter is in
00:52 - if the the letter is the first letter in
00:56 - the sentence they're gonna return a zero
00:58 - yeah but if it doesn't find that letter
01:00 - it's gonna return a negative one
01:03 - okay then we're gonna do
01:06 - print message
01:10 - dot find
01:13 - t lowercase t yeah then
01:17 - print message dot find
01:21 - a z z
01:24 - so there is no z here well hmm
01:27 - let's do it uppercase see and let's see
01:31 - if it finds the
01:32 - uppercase yeah first let's do ctrl s to
01:35 - save it
01:36 - and then go to the terminal and do
01:38 - helper
01:40 - no py helper
01:43 - 2 dot p1 let's press enter
01:47 - 4 32 and negative 1. it returned a
01:50 - negative 1 because
01:51 - they're fine uh um uppercase c
01:56 - yeah then is 32
01:59 - so the t is right
02:03 - there the t the the lazy dot
02:07 - and then there's four because there's a
02:10 - q and a quick yeah okay now we're going
02:14 - to delete this
02:16 - and then message
02:20 - equal
02:23 - middle i mean a long space near the
02:26 - middle
02:27 - so the spaces in here
02:31 - it is two tabs then
02:34 - i'm gonna do print
02:38 - a dot and then
02:41 - plus message dot
02:44 - else
02:48 - plus a dot again
02:52 - so the l strip function will um take
02:55 - away all the spaces
02:57 - in the left of the word and then
03:01 - and then like make it into periods okay
03:05 - then
03:05 - print
03:14 - dot plus
03:17 - message dot r strip
03:23 - the l equals left and the r equals right
03:27 - yeah then a dot
03:34 - then we're gonna do print
03:39 - dot
03:43 - plus message
03:47 - s strip
03:50 - that strip so the strip
03:54 - it doesn't have a left or right so it's
03:56 - going to strip on both sides of the work
03:59 - okay then
04:06 - okay let's save it so it's gonna strip
04:10 - the spaces and add these
04:12 - okay let's do up arrow to copy what you
04:15 - list
04:16 - what you last typed in the terminal and
04:18 - run it
04:20 - middle middle middle so in the strip
04:23 - all the spaces disappeared and they
04:25 - added
04:27 - periods yeah then here in the r strip
04:31 - the r the right spaces disappear but the
04:34 - left spaces are still here
04:36 - then in the l strip the right spaces are
04:39 - still here
04:40 - but the left spaces are disappeared okay
04:43 - now let's delete this
04:45 - and type it
04:49 - brevity is the essence
04:54 - of what so that's the message and then
04:58 - message equals
05:01 - message dot replace
05:08 - essence
05:13 - so the replace function as it says
05:16 - as it names is going to replace the
05:20 - word if it sees it it will replace it
05:25 - too
05:25 - so yeah so if it's fine essence in
05:28 - the message it's gonna turn the essence
05:32 - to a soul
05:34 - okay then print message
05:39 - okay let's save it and run it
05:43 - now it says brevity is the soul of what
05:46 - so you see
05:47 - it doesn't print brevity is the essence
05:49 - of what because
05:50 - it found the word essence and changed it
05:53 - to a soul
05:54 - less than this so now we're going to do
05:58 - message equals
06:01 - b then print
06:05 - message
06:10 - so the so the r just function is gonna
06:14 - uh put 20 spaces but it also counts
06:19 - the word howdy so the howdy has
06:22 - five letters so it's gonna minus five
06:25 - from the twenty so
06:26 - there's gonna be fifteen spaces then
06:29 - print
06:31 - i left yeah message dot
06:36 - our just
06:40 - 20 comma dash
06:44 - so now we have added the dash so it will
06:48 - add 15 dashes
06:49 - yeah because again the how do you
06:52 - already have
06:53 - five letters so it will take five away
06:55 - from this one
06:57 - then print message
07:00 - dot
07:04 - 20 so just like the r chest
07:07 - the elders is gonna add 20 spaces
07:11 - but it minus five so that would be 15.
07:14 - so because of the howdy so the left the
07:17 - lgs
07:18 - will do will add 20
07:21 - well 15 spaces on the right
07:25 - then print message dot
07:28 - l just 20
07:32 - comma dash so just like here
07:37 - the l just 20 comma dash
07:41 - is gonna add 15 dashes
07:44 - to the right yeah to the right of having
07:47 - let's save it
07:48 - and run it so
07:51 - see it just as 15
07:55 - because here there's already five
07:58 - letters
07:59 - so it all worked and that's it for today

08:08 - bye bye

welcome to coding with kids my name is kalia and my name is amy today we're gonna teach you python so today we're gonna learn about string helper functions so i'm gonna make a new folder file and i'm gonna name it helper2.py then we're going to message equals the quick brown fox jump over the lazy dog then we're gonna do print message dot message dot find two two so it's going to return the number of the position that the letter is in if the the letter is the first letter in the sentence they're gonna return a zero yeah but if it doesn't find that letter it's gonna return a negative one okay then we're gonna do print message dot find t lowercase t yeah then print message dot find a z z so there is no z here well hmm let's do it uppercase see and let's see if it finds the uppercase yeah first let's do ctrl s to save it and then go to the terminal and do helper no py helper 2 dot p1 let's press enter 4 32 and negative 1. it returned a negative 1 because they're fine uh um uppercase c yeah then is 32 so the t is right there the t the the lazy dot and then there's four because there's a q and a quick yeah okay now we're going to delete this and then message equal middle i mean a long space near the middle so the spaces in here it is two tabs then i'm gonna do print a dot and then plus message dot else plus a dot again so the l strip function will um take away all the spaces in the left of the word and then and then like make it into periods okay then print dot plus message dot r strip the l equals left and the r equals right yeah then a dot then we're gonna do print dot plus message s strip that strip so the strip it doesn't have a left or right so it's going to strip on both sides of the work okay then okay let's save it so it's gonna strip the spaces and add these okay let's do up arrow to copy what you list what you last typed in the terminal and run it middle middle middle so in the strip all the spaces disappeared and they added periods yeah then here in the r strip the r the right spaces disappear but the left spaces are still here then in the l strip the right spaces are still here but the left spaces are disappeared okay now let's delete this and type it brevity is the essence of what so that's the message and then message equals message dot replace essence so the replace function as it says as it names is going to replace the word if it sees it it will replace it too so yeah so if it's fine essence in the message it's gonna turn the essence to a soul okay then print message okay let's save it and run it now it says brevity is the soul of what so you see it doesn't print brevity is the essence of what because it found the word essence and changed it to a soul less than this so now we're going to do message equals b then print message so the so the r just function is gonna uh put 20 spaces but it also counts the word howdy so the howdy has five letters so it's gonna minus five from the twenty so there's gonna be fifteen spaces then print i left yeah message dot our just 20 comma dash so now we have added the dash so it will add 15 dashes yeah because again the how do you already have five letters so it will take five away from this one then print message dot 20 so just like the r chest the elders is gonna add 20 spaces but it minus five so that would be 15. so because of the howdy so the left the lgs will do will add 20 well 15 spaces on the right then print message dot l just 20 comma dash so just like here the l just 20 comma dash is gonna add 15 dashes to the right yeah to the right of having let's save it and run it so see it just as 15 because here there's already five letters so it all worked and that's it for today remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
