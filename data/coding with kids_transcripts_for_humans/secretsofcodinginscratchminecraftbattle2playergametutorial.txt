00:12 - originally it was just like
00:14 - a stickman well not stickman but round
00:18 - men
00:19 - um two player battle games so so this is
00:22 - minecraft i changed it into minecraft
00:24 - i'm alex andrews um
00:27 - steve
00:38 - and player one well
00:40 - regularly the characters the two uh
00:43 - players looked identically the same
00:45 - except for the helmet cut so in player
00:48 - one i changed it into steam
00:50 - so you it regularly had like a walking
00:53 - motion but
00:54 - i just made regular steve so it's all
00:57 - like this
00:59 - this is like it's sliding and then for
01:01 - the helmet i just chose another element
01:04 - so they look more like soldiers soldiers
01:07 - for their main um regular
01:10 - weapon weapon it's sword so i also added
01:13 - the swinging emotion that's the sword
01:16 - yeah like this and then you can use this
01:18 - to turn it
01:19 - so andrew used it to turn the motion and
01:22 - then there's also the spear which i
01:24 - didn't change because there's a spear
01:25 - minecraft and there's also another right
01:28 - ax and there's also a swing motion
01:30 - and the crossbow was originally across
01:33 - but i just want to change it into an
01:34 - arrow
01:35 - because it's more simple yeah
01:38 - yeah
01:39 - usual crossbow in this game also didn't
01:42 - need a recharge basically a bow and
01:43 - arrow and there's this special sword
01:45 - which i didn't do and there's the arrow
01:48 - i never saw that special light
01:50 - yeah it i've never seen it in the game
01:54 - the shadow then i also did the same two
01:58 - player two i added alex
02:00 - i am alex and then there's the same
02:03 - helmet
02:04 - and the same
02:06 - everything is same except the player i
02:08 - copied it from the player one sprite to
02:10 - the
02:11 - two so they're identically the same and
02:14 - then background
02:15 - in the background one disney original
02:17 - background i added some sunflowers to
02:20 - make it more minecrafty this one
