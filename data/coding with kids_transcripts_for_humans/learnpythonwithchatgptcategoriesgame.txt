00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia my name is Andrew they want to use
00:05 - chat jbt to create a game in Python So
00:09 - today we're going to be creating the
00:10 - categories game with chat gbt the
00:13 - categories game is a game where you can
00:15 - do on paper we're gonna do it with
00:17 - python
00:18 - so it's where they're a few categories
00:21 - and then regularly you would pick a
00:24 - letter and list
00:26 - um words in the category that start with
00:29 - that letter but today we're just going
00:30 - to try to list words
00:33 - so I asked chat gbd to create a simple
00:36 - categories game in Python and then I
00:39 - made it at a bunch of letters I mean
00:42 - answers and then two players and points
00:45 - okay so here's the PO the code first you
00:48 - import the random module so you can use
00:51 - the filters inside of it then we're
00:53 - gonna have the categories
00:55 - and we're gonna have animals and then
00:57 - here the bunch of animal names fruits
00:59 - countries and colors so these are the
01:01 - words you can guess which are a lot
01:04 - and then here the max tries per turn is
01:07 - five so every turn the player a player
01:10 - has they can guess five words at the
01:13 - maximum
01:14 - this and then here the scores and then
01:17 - we have a function called choose
01:18 - category which we use the random.choice
01:21 - function from the random module and
01:23 - we'll pick a random uh category out of
01:25 - the four
01:27 - then we have a playground function which
01:30 - is the main gaining Loop that we're
01:32 - going to choose a category and store and
01:34 - the category variable then we're going
01:36 - to tell the players the category
01:38 - then we're gonna put the valid answers
01:41 - inside our variable we're going to have
01:44 - items and tries then while tries is less
01:48 - than maximum tries we're going to do
01:51 - player one and player two name an item
01:53 - in a category or end to finish and then
01:56 - remember to put that on lowercase and
01:58 - then if item equals equals n so if you
02:01 - type n
02:02 - and you want to end the game will break
02:04 - else if it's not end the item and item
02:07 - current you already mentioned the I so
02:09 - you can also check if you
02:11 - uh already answered like that so you
02:14 - have to answer another thing else if
02:16 - item invalid answers so if you get a
02:19 - right answer it will add the item
02:22 - it will give you a score and it will
02:24 - also remove it from the valid answer so
02:26 - you can't guess it again and it'll say
02:28 - this is a valid answer else it will
02:31 - print this is not at all answer this
02:32 - category tries plus equals one because
02:36 - you use the turn
02:38 - and then while true for player then it
02:42 - will cycle over the players and then at
02:44 - the end it will do print player scored
02:48 - and then the score points and then here
02:51 - you can play again and then if it's yes
02:55 - it'll repeat and then print final scores
02:57 - and then it will show the scores okay so
03:00 - now let's see it in Visual Studio code
03:02 - so here's the code let's play we're only
03:05 - gonna play one ROM because this can take
03:07 - very long
03:09 - no you do okay our category is fruits so
03:14 - let's see we can do apple
03:16 - and we're gonna do banana
03:18 - we're gonna do watermelon
03:21 - and we're gonna do
03:24 - um
03:25 - pineapple so you can also change the
03:28 - answers and categories or I still have
03:31 - one or two okay let's see
03:34 - um
03:35 - mango okay you're not supposed to be
03:38 - healthy so it says here one score five
03:40 - points in a category changes for Clear
03:43 - two
03:50 - zebra a monkey
03:53 - so you can also change the answers and
03:56 - so that will be harder to guess the
03:58 - right words
03:59 - so Kalia spelled misspelled monkey so it
04:03 - says it's not a valid answer so she
04:05 - loses a point but she doesn't get a
04:07 - point
04:11 - lion tiger
04:16 - tiger
04:19 - two score two points three points
04:26 - let's see
04:30 - zebra is about a monkey is not dolphin
04:33 - is not a valid answer see so you can
04:36 - shorten the list and make it harder to
04:38 - guess the right rules
04:42 - okay let's see
04:44 - so I won
04:46 - this round so we can do
04:49 - yes animals
04:52 - I'm gonna do I'm actually gonna do
04:54 - monkey
04:55 - there's no monkey in it okay
04:59 - organic I don't know I'm not gonna take
05:03 - this let's do seahorse
05:06 - it's not in there any uh either let's do
05:10 - dog
05:11 - yes
05:15 - still not
05:17 - let's see
05:18 - um
05:20 - um let's see
05:23 - let's guess
05:25 - the hamster
05:30 - third one I still have five points from
05:32 - the last round
05:33 - so I didn't get any
05:35 - animals again lying
05:39 - mine is not about answer because you
05:42 - already answered it oh
05:53 - how do you spell koala
05:56 - okay
06:07 - yeah
06:08 - what should I do
06:10 - that
06:13 - that is that so if you try to answer
06:16 - something two times
06:18 - it's Unity you already mentioned that I
06:21 - am that still takes the trip should we
06:23 - end it yeah okay so if you do n we'll do
06:27 - player two scored Four Points number I
06:29 - didn't know and then I will show the
06:31 - final scores so I won I've got five
06:33 - points and four points I clutch the so
06:37 - we hope you have fun well that was fun
06:39 - and that's it for today thank you for
06:42 - watching
06:43 - And subscribe bye bye
06:48 - thank you
