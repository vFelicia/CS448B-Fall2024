00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - khalida my name is Andrew today we're in
00:05 - edible so Arabic is a clothing platform
00:08 - where there are lots and lots of
00:09 - problems you can solve using different
00:11 - coding languages So today we're going to
00:14 - solve through three easy coding problems
00:16 - using python so first our first problem
00:20 - is called reverse a list we're a
00:22 - function to reverse a list so there are
00:24 - instructions are very simple and here
00:27 - are the examples so it will give us a
00:30 - list of um numbers so here is one two
00:33 - three four and you reverse the list so
00:36 - we should return the list essays four
00:39 - three two one
00:40 - if it gives us a empty um list when you
00:44 - give them an empty list don't forget to
00:47 - return the result okay so first we have
00:50 - a function called reversed and a
00:52 - variable called a list called list
00:55 - without an I so first we're going to
00:57 - make a variable called reverse equals
01:00 - list that reverse so the reverse
01:03 - function will basically will simply just
01:06 - reverse a list and reverse its contents
01:10 - this is what we're supposed to do is
01:12 - very easy and then we're just going to
01:15 - return the list so this still works if
01:17 - there's an empty bracket
01:19 - but technically nothing will happen so
01:21 - we're going to check in because it's
01:22 - empty yeah we're gonna see the test
01:25 - cases
01:26 - so here there's three three so we
01:29 - basically return the same thing because
01:31 - there's nothing to reverse because the
01:33 - numbers are the same
01:34 - same for negative one negative one and
01:36 - negative one and then five six seven we
01:39 - reverse it into a seven six five so
01:42 - let's see console all the tests are
01:44 - passed yay now on to our second easy
01:47 - challenge then we're it's called find
01:50 - the largest number in a list create a
01:53 - function that takes a list of numbers
01:54 - return the largest number in the list so
01:57 - here's some examples so it'll give us a
02:00 - list of numbers all of them have
02:04 - well there's a different number of
02:06 - numbers in the list so there's one
02:10 - example is four five one and three we're
02:12 - gonna find the largest number in in this
02:14 - list which is five so we we need to
02:17 - return the number five and here there's
02:21 - 300 200 600 and 150 largest number is
02:25 - 600 so we need to return 600 expect
02:28 - either positive numbers or zero there
02:30 - are no negative numbers
02:32 - so now we're gonna we have a function
02:35 - called
02:36 - um find largest num with
02:38 - um a list called nums so first we're
02:41 - going to make a variable called largest
02:43 - and then we're going to use the function
02:45 - Max on the nums list so the max function
02:50 - well
02:52 - um return the largest number in the list
02:56 - so we're going to store the largest
02:58 - number in the variable called largest
03:00 - and then we're going to return that
03:02 - number in the variable largest so we're
03:04 - going to check and see the test cases so
03:07 - here there is 30 to 40 and 3. the
03:10 - largest number is 40 so we're going to
03:12 - return 40. another test case is zero one
03:16 - zero zero one so here there are two ones
03:19 - we just returned the one that is that
03:21 - comes first in the list but either way
03:23 - you just return one
03:26 - and we have 32 35 37 to 39 so the
03:31 - greatest is 39 so we return 39. so the
03:35 - console all the chests are passed let's
03:37 - move on to our final challenge so our
03:41 - final challenge is called return the
03:43 - first element in a list create a
03:45 - function that takes a list containing
03:47 - only numbers and return the first
03:49 - element
03:50 - so here is one just three we're gonna
03:53 - return one because of the first value
03:55 - that occurs in the list it is negative
03:58 - 500 0 and 50 we're going to turn
04:00 - negative 500 because it's the first
04:03 - element or value the first element is in
04:07 - a list always has an index of zero so
04:09 - that's a clue
04:11 - so first we have a function called get
04:14 - for first value with a list called
04:16 - number list
04:18 - so first we're going to do a variable
04:20 - called value and then equals number list
04:23 - which is the list the pop zero so pop is
04:27 - a way to
04:28 - um
04:29 - get a value will kind of remove a value
04:34 - but you can specify which value by
04:37 - getting the
04:40 - list indexed so here the first item as I
04:44 - says here always has an index of zero so
04:47 - we're going to do zero here to remove
04:49 - the first element and then we're going
04:51 - to store it in a variable so we can
04:52 - return it and then we're just going to
04:54 - return the variable value so let's now
04:57 - see the test cases here there's 75
05:01 - 675 5 and 100 so the the first number is
05:07 - 75 675 so we're going to turn that and
05:11 - then there is five two and three so
05:14 - we're going to return 5 because it's the
05:16 - first value so all the tests are passed
05:20 - hooray so all these challenges are
05:24 - included with lists yeah okay well that
05:28 - was fun and that's it for today thank
05:30 - you for watching Remember to smash the

welcome to coding with kids my name is khalida my name is Andrew today we're in edible so Arabic is a clothing platform where there are lots and lots of problems you can solve using different coding languages So today we're going to solve through three easy coding problems using python so first our first problem is called reverse a list we're a function to reverse a list so there are instructions are very simple and here are the examples so it will give us a list of um numbers so here is one two three four and you reverse the list so we should return the list essays four three two one if it gives us a empty um list when you give them an empty list don't forget to return the result okay so first we have a function called reversed and a variable called a list called list without an I so first we're going to make a variable called reverse equals list that reverse so the reverse function will basically will simply just reverse a list and reverse its contents this is what we're supposed to do is very easy and then we're just going to return the list so this still works if there's an empty bracket but technically nothing will happen so we're going to check in because it's empty yeah we're gonna see the test cases so here there's three three so we basically return the same thing because there's nothing to reverse because the numbers are the same same for negative one negative one and negative one and then five six seven we reverse it into a seven six five so let's see console all the tests are passed yay now on to our second easy challenge then we're it's called find the largest number in a list create a function that takes a list of numbers return the largest number in the list so here's some examples so it'll give us a list of numbers all of them have well there's a different number of numbers in the list so there's one example is four five one and three we're gonna find the largest number in in this list which is five so we we need to return the number five and here there's 300 200 600 and 150 largest number is 600 so we need to return 600 expect either positive numbers or zero there are no negative numbers so now we're gonna we have a function called um find largest num with um a list called nums so first we're going to make a variable called largest and then we're going to use the function Max on the nums list so the max function well um return the largest number in the list so we're going to store the largest number in the variable called largest and then we're going to return that number in the variable largest so we're going to check and see the test cases so here there is 30 to 40 and 3. the largest number is 40 so we're going to return 40. another test case is zero one zero zero one so here there are two ones we just returned the one that is that comes first in the list but either way you just return one and we have 32 35 37 to 39 so the greatest is 39 so we return 39. so the console all the chests are passed let's move on to our final challenge so our final challenge is called return the first element in a list create a function that takes a list containing only numbers and return the first element so here is one just three we're gonna return one because of the first value that occurs in the list it is negative 500 0 and 50 we're going to turn negative 500 because it's the first element or value the first element is in a list always has an index of zero so that's a clue so first we have a function called get for first value with a list called number list so first we're going to do a variable called value and then equals number list which is the list the pop zero so pop is a way to um get a value will kind of remove a value but you can specify which value by getting the list indexed so here the first item as I says here always has an index of zero so we're going to do zero here to remove the first element and then we're going to store it in a variable so we can return it and then we're just going to return the variable value so let's now see the test cases here there's 75 675 5 and 100 so the the first number is 75 675 so we're going to turn that and then there is five two and three so we're going to return 5 because it's the first value so all the tests are passed hooray so all these challenges are included with lists yeah okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
