00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in
00:05 - Minecraft education Edition and the auto
00:07 - code Escape estate so we went through
00:10 - the portal and now let's go see it's
00:12 - like a Garden Room gardening room with
00:14 - lots of plants okay so that's such room
00:17 - for particles right click particles okay
00:19 - button
00:21 - oh now there's a fountain
00:24 - the the fastest thing is kind of broken
00:26 - because there's broken uh blocks and
00:29 - it's leaking water okay
00:32 - oh it's a box missing I think the water
00:35 - isn't like I think the water is supposed
00:37 - to go here okay
00:41 - here maybe this is for planting
00:44 - mushrooms I think it's water supposed to
00:48 - go for I don't know okay
00:54 - so now let's see to code to see what we
00:57 - have to fix okay
01:03 - you need more water and it looks like
01:05 - those cracked blocks are leaking use the
01:08 - move cursor going into position the
01:10 - cursor over cracked block and then break
01:12 - block to break it and let the water flow
01:15 - into the canal okay so the cursor we
01:19 - have is right there with the orange blue
01:22 - magenta and yellow okay
01:24 - okay
01:25 - so we have to go break these blocks the
01:28 - ones that are broken with dripping water
01:30 - should be um
01:31 - yeah they should be broken so the wire
01:35 - would go through
01:37 - so let's go let's run this example so
01:40 - this is an example it won't work okay
01:43 - okay
01:52 - so this is the same you can also do for
01:54 - Iron Range to do uh the command multiple
01:57 - times it's the same command like it's
01:59 - the same thing except it's just in a
02:01 - repeat Loop okay let's see here so let's
02:03 - see what this does first okay go down
02:06 - and then okay
02:08 - so we do not need to break that block so
02:11 - this code actually works so I think we
02:13 - need to go yellow two more times yeah
02:16 - and it will be have to be before they
02:19 - break Brock okay so go we're just gonna
02:21 - make a
02:23 - we're just gonna make a loop
02:26 - here so it's gonna be easier
02:30 - so we're looking for eye in the Range
02:33 - four times
02:35 - four times
02:37 - and then remember to add the tab
02:40 - only tap the move cursor so it can only
02:45 - that command will be
02:47 - okay break the first one
02:50 - break the seconds okay now we need to go
02:52 - to the bottom so we go two times magenta
02:55 - and then one time blue and then break
02:57 - block
02:58 - times matchup
03:04 - from
03:07 - oopsies
03:18 - um magenta
03:20 - two times
03:25 - so we can
03:27 - reach it so then we have to move
03:31 - sir
03:33 - blue
03:37 - and then like break a block
03:42 - please
03:44 - can then break block
03:46 - break
03:49 - block
03:50 - okay now let's run it and then we should
03:52 - break up three out of four blocks
03:57 - so now we have one more last one so I
04:00 - think we should go blue one blue and
04:03 - then two oh two times blue and two times
04:06 - magenta okay so let's go back to code
04:20 - yeah okay
04:25 - and then two times magenta
04:40 - and then last but not least break block
04:49 - one first one
05:04 - but the water is going into there the
05:07 - holes
05:11 - so I think we need to repair the
05:17 - oh no holes in the canal stop the water
05:20 - from flowing into the garden fill those
05:22 - holes to help the water along I used to
05:24 - move cursive funky to position the
05:25 - cursor over a hole and then Place Buffs
05:27 - to fill it in okay so let's see this
05:29 - color basically repair okay so this code
05:33 - example
05:34 - first glow Gold Blocks okay so it did
05:38 - the first two and then one two okay okay
05:41 - let's see
05:45 - okay so let's also do loops
05:49 - and then now over here so let's see what
05:51 - this does first
05:53 - first one second one
05:56 - okay one okay so this is good we need to
05:59 - go orange and then Place block okay
06:06 - beautiful cursor
06:08 - Orange
06:11 - and place block place
06:15 - okay then we should be all done with two
06:19 - okay
06:21 - okay oh no oh wait go back to code
06:25 - oh you forgot to add it okay
06:28 - okay this should work
06:31 - one two
06:32 - three four okay so now we still have two
06:36 - more holes so blue blue
06:39 - and an orange place block and then
06:42 - orange
06:43 - [Music]
06:55 - and then orange
06:58 - Place black and orange place block
07:02 - place
07:04 - and the same thing
07:08 - oh yeah
07:13 - okay
07:15 - I in range two times
07:22 - and add tabs to both move cursor and
07:26 - face block
07:28 - okay now run it and ish brick okay okay
07:31 - one two
07:34 - three four
07:37 - five
07:38 - six it's not fixed it so now the water
07:41 - should flow all the way so now the four
07:44 - blocks is appear and it's going to the
07:46 - mushrooms
07:47 - oh the mushrooms are growing the
07:50 - mushrooms we can use all mushrooms
07:52 - medium Russian and big oh we're supposed
07:55 - to go on to wait oh whoopsies
08:12 - wow there's more flowers and we can
08:14 - water them okay let's see
08:18 - but let's see to see what we have to do
08:21 - then we have the cursor and we have
08:22 - these uh flowers the concrete blocks
08:25 - okay so let's see
08:28 - there's some pattern with these flowers
08:30 - figure out the pattern and plant the
08:32 - flowers in the empty dirt using the move
08:34 - Chrissy to position the cursor in the
08:36 - plant flower supplies to pull out so
08:38 - there's a pattern let's see
08:40 - um oh the flu red and yellow flowers so
08:44 - the I think the first row the wine with
08:47 - the blue flower is also possibly blue
08:49 - and then yellow and then the red yeah
08:52 - over there is a blue one yeah so let's
08:55 - do that
08:58 - are you sure only uh the dark gray the
09:02 - dark brown or the only the brown I think
09:04 - all of them
09:06 - okay okay let's go code example
09:11 - [Music]
09:13 - so code example
09:18 - red one a rose but we should plant the
09:22 - yellow dandelion
09:24 - back to cutting and then this is also
09:26 - blue and it will be way better okay so
09:29 - let's go back here and let's see
09:35 - no it's not it's showing us that the
09:38 - actually that row is blue this Rose
09:41 - yellow and this rose red so it's
09:42 - actually not okay
09:45 - here that should be good and then we
09:48 - have to repeat this how many times
09:50 - let's see
09:53 - uh
09:54 - so that will be wait plant file one two
09:58 - three four five five times
10:12 - no three one two three four five okay
10:18 - okay so now we need to move down magenta
10:22 - okay yellow okay let's go
10:27 - um move cursor
10:31 - magenta
10:35 - I am rage five times
10:46 - flower yellow
10:51 - and then we will have to do move
10:55 - for sure I think it's orange
10:59 - see check no it's blue oopsies
11:08 - you should be done with the first two
11:10 - rows
11:14 - okay
11:18 - so now we need to move magenta and then
11:21 - Red Bull
11:23 - yeah yeah oopsies
11:26 - let's go back here then move cursor
11:30 - magenta
11:34 - sometimes before I range five times
11:40 - plant flower
11:45 - red red and then we'll have to do move
11:49 - cursor yellow
11:52 - okay
11:55 - one should be done gardening
11:59 - wait oh each time we have a concrete
12:03 - blocks are also changing along with our
12:04 - flower okay let's see
12:06 - head overhead it looks so cool
12:10 - okay now we're done
12:12 - enter the next room where is the portal
12:15 - over here so let's see this again like
12:18 - this is really cool in my personal
12:20 - opinion I think there should be more
12:22 - torches near the mushrooms because it's
12:24 - very dark well it's really only lanterns
12:26 - here
12:27 - because like this Garden this is some
12:30 - Secret Life
12:32 - yeah I don't think uh Lanterns have that
12:35 - much delight yeah I know okay
12:39 - no next video well that was fun and
12:44 - that's it for today thank you for
12:45 - watching Remember to smash like button
12:48 - and subscribe bye bye

times and add tabs to both move cursor and face block okay now run it and ish brick okay okay one two three four five six it's not fixed it so now the water should flow all the way so now the four blocks is appear and it's going to the mushrooms oh the mushrooms are growing the mushrooms we can use all mushrooms medium Russian and big oh we're supposed to go on to wait oh whoopsies wow there's more flowers and we can water them okay let's see but let's see to see what we have to do then we have the cursor and we have these uh flowers the concrete blocks okay so let's see there's some

sure I think it's orange see check no it's blue oopsies you should be done with the first two rows okay so now we need to move magenta and then Red Bull yeah yeah oopsies let's go back here then move cursor magenta sometimes before I range five times plant flower red red and then we'll have to do move cursor yellow okay one should be done gardening wait oh each time we have a concrete blocks are also changing along with our flower okay let's see head overhead it looks so cool okay now we're done enter the next room where is the portal over here so let's see this again like this is really cool
