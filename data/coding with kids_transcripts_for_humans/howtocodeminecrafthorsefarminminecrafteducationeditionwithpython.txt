00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - kalia and my name is andrew today we're
00:05 - on minecraft education edition so today
00:07 - i'm going to show you how to make a
00:09 - horse farm so on chacomat farm so when
00:12 - you take farm in the chat
00:13 - the builder is going to teleport to
00:16 - where you are and the coordinates are
00:18 - zero zero zero so the builder is
00:20 - basically an invisible agent that is
00:23 - used more as more suitable for building
00:26 - stuff
00:27 - so something's called
00:29 - yeah so we're gonna do repeat three
00:31 - times we're gonna build a trace path for
00:33 - mark with a spurs fence so just like
00:36 - this kind of fence and
00:39 - it'll build a turn left
00:41 - then builder move forward by seven so
00:43 - we're making one side and then builder
00:46 - turn left
00:47 - so he the builder is ready to make the
00:49 - other side and the builder move forward
00:51 - by six
00:52 - and then it'll repeat three times it'll
00:55 - make the whole square this is gonna be
00:57 - seven by six
00:58 - and out of the repeat loop
01:00 - we're gonna do agent teleport to player
01:03 - so now we need the agent so it's a
01:05 - cooperation between the agent and the
01:07 - builder
01:08 - then we're gonna agent set blocker item
01:11 - so this is the item spawn horse so the
01:14 - horse spawn egg
01:16 - and slot count 64 in slot 1. so the
01:19 - agent also has an inventory so we can
01:22 - use that to get the horsepower instead
01:24 - of us searching it in creative inventory
01:27 - so if you are in um survival that will
01:30 - be very like useful yeah so in python
01:35 - it's defined on chances of python
01:38 - function
01:39 - teleport to position zero zero where you
01:42 - are and then for index and range three
01:46 - builder that trace path spurs fence
01:49 - and then building that turn left turn so
01:51 - it's ready
01:52 - to make a side builder that move forward
01:55 - seven one side whether that turn left
01:57 - turn so it'll be another side and
01:59 - building that move forward six times
02:02 - and then
02:03 - out of the repeat loop we're gonna do
02:05 - agent dot teleport to builder so now
02:07 - we're using the agent the agent dot set
02:10 - item spawn horse egg
02:12 - 64 and slot one then
02:15 - player that on chat when you type farm
02:17 - in the chat it'll run the function
02:20 - now let's
02:21 - try it next to the pumpkin wow that's a
02:24 - wild horse there's a wild horse already
02:26 - spawned to you yeah this one i think
02:28 - it's a bit rare i've never seen that
02:30 - kind or i just saw a gold helmet
02:33 - skeleton
02:40 - [Music]
02:45 - oh dude i think the horse can escape no
02:48 - they're too tall they can't fit in like
02:50 - two
02:51 - two um blocks high well this is one yeah
02:55 - okay um
02:58 - if you try to do this try to do this
03:03 - now get the agent
03:06 - which is stuck in the fence
03:09 - okay
03:10 - the spawn horse or the bone meals from
03:12 - one of our other videos okay spawn force
03:16 - wow this one is black spots okay
03:19 - this white one is like very
03:21 - white ones are very
03:23 - royal yeah kind of way this one is a
03:26 - baby it's the same it escaped because
03:29 - babies are one block
03:31 - baby you can't escape it's okay
03:34 - it's just
03:35 - another baby
03:37 - this one it's just like that one yeah
03:39 - it's just like a natural sponge it's
03:41 - more gray
03:43 - this one looks like brownish one
03:45 - teenager yeah that's like a teenager
03:48 - okay a more dark brown
03:50 - okay
03:52 - oh the same dark brown again yeah
03:56 - um
03:57 - oh
03:58 - this is gray and white spotted one which
04:01 - ones are your favorite counting the wild
04:04 - one too i think the white one it's royal
04:07 - another baby so maybe another one
04:12 - babies okay now we're gonna choose four
04:16 - adult ones and armor and saddle them and
04:19 - try to take them around for a ride okay
04:22 - of course so we're gonna take
04:25 - another
04:27 - iron
04:29 - gold
04:30 - and diamond
04:32 - and now we're gonna need a saddle who's
04:34 - gonna get the lucky diamond one i think
04:36 - it's going to be the warrior one or i
04:38 - think uh
04:40 - the white one so now i'm gonna use a
04:42 - golden carrot or if you want you can use
04:45 - a golden apple to tame them
04:48 - okay okay this one what which one you're
04:51 - gonna saddle with
04:53 - then try to ride it
04:57 - okay needs more more more more
05:01 - all right
05:04 - try not to
05:05 - try not to hold a sandal
05:08 - try not to hold the stand though when
05:10 - trying to go on top of them
05:12 - oh you're feeding the baby
05:14 - yeah one time
05:16 - try to go and go on to the top of it
05:18 - okay yes
05:21 - okay we're gonna go see
05:23 - oh yeah
05:27 - nice satellite now
05:30 - okay now we're in its inventory put
05:33 - saddle and leather leather fits it right
05:36 - or our iron it's more of its color yeah
05:39 - okay now we're going to take it for a
05:41 - ride
05:43 - so called walk
05:45 - full jump go oh that's actually a
05:47 - perfect shot so fast
05:50 - yeah this one is just way faster don't
05:52 - go to the water as if it smacked you for
05:55 - some reason there's a honey high
05:57 - skeleton okay
06:00 - oh no you're almost done underwater
06:04 - okay
06:07 - oh there's another wild um
06:09 - wild one right there oh yeah cool
06:13 - i know where our first one went
06:16 - okay now i'm gonna leave the iron one
06:18 - close by now i'm going to try a
06:21 - different one okay which one
06:23 - you want yeah obviously
06:27 - you're sure i like you
06:28 - okay now it works
06:30 - right so i'm going to try you
06:32 - sure it didn't have any like um hearts
06:36 - coming at it well it doesn't need hearts
06:39 - your heart i think a heart
06:41 - when you ride it
06:43 - no
06:46 - don't go on top of it with um
06:50 - okay
06:51 - yeah
06:52 - okay
06:53 - the heart was on it when you were in
06:55 - your inventory so
06:58 - okay go through my own you're on
07:02 - saddle
07:03 - and diamond of course
07:06 - i guessed it
07:08 - obviously the royal one
07:10 - bull jump on another ball jump
07:14 - almost
07:16 - almost
07:18 - almost
07:19 - full jump oh yes
07:22 - and leave it closer like it okay
07:25 - next oh we have leather this one how is
07:28 - this
07:29 - this is not the dark brown one oh i
07:31 - think lever more
07:33 - like yeah
07:36 - okay now try to ride it
07:38 - but first we need a saddle
07:41 - okay we're gonna get a saddle oh i love
07:44 - you
07:47 - when i say love
07:49 - like you okay
07:52 - saddle
07:53 - okay
07:54 - cut the saddle
07:56 - and the leather gold one is hard to
07:59 - decide i think it's more on the royal
08:02 - one
08:03 - yeah because you know gold's very
08:05 - royal but it's not that good like
08:09 - diamond is way better
08:10 - it's i'm always thinking why can't they
08:13 - take fall damage like they jump so high
08:16 - well they're
08:17 - they're trained i guess
08:20 - trained
08:21 - oh
08:23 - i love jumping this one i think this one
08:25 - is the fastest
08:26 - okay
08:28 - finally
08:29 - yeah our gold one which one
08:32 - should we do spotted
08:34 - uh okay
08:35 - okay which one black or gray gray great
08:38 - i'd
08:43 - [Music]
08:52 - and then get a saddle
08:54 - or armor
08:56 - it looks cool actually yeah cause it's
08:58 - very shiny okay
09:00 - i think the gold one is perfect for
09:02 - anyone
09:04 - we actually can just escape the end
09:06 - where i think i also saw it yeah
09:10 - right there oh let's set it back to
09:11 - sunny
09:13 - okay for a good day for these kind of um
09:17 - horses
09:18 - as their day for their armor
09:21 - to get their armor on
09:24 - oh let's try to jump over it's really
09:26 - can't um um
09:28 - [Music]
09:32 - pull job
09:34 - i'm trying to follow ball drop almost
09:36 - [Music]
09:39 - full job you're like so fast when you
09:42 - keep jumping yeah
09:44 - because it jumps very high i did two
09:46 - ball jumps with it i wonder if it ever
09:48 - gets tired of this really realistic
09:51 - actually
09:52 - minecraft is not really that really
09:55 - thick
09:56 - yeah like
09:58 - but why can't
10:00 - chickens
10:01 - well they can flutter
10:04 - the i don't think they would be that
10:07 - high in life for any reason yeah okay
10:10 - let's take
10:12 - our diamond
10:13 - and our leather okay
10:16 - hi my diamond looks so cool perfect for
10:19 - loyal people yeah okay well that was fun
10:23 - and that's it for today thank you for
10:26 - watching remember to smash like and
10:28 - subscribe bye bye
