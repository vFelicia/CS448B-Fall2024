00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia and my name is Andrew today we're
00:05 - in Minecraft education Edition in the
00:07 - Oracle Escape s day we're going to
00:10 - continue the library room with the king
00:12 - and queen chess pieces now we're gonna
00:14 - investigate the particles over the red
00:17 - carpet
00:18 - okay now that we can move the Kings and
00:21 - they have dates over them the queen has
00:23 - has January 5th and the King has May 5th
00:25 - oh there's particles over there let's
00:27 - see
00:32 - there's another one there's no key for
00:35 - the queen Queen's birthday May 4th
00:38 - it's now we're gonna see
00:40 - to see our instructions you're free the
00:42 - king and queen but the door still isn't
00:44 - opening they must be in the wrong
00:46 - positions move them into the correct
00:48 - positions so you can finally escape this
00:50 - place use the move chest piece monkey to
00:52 - move the king and queen into the correct
00:54 - positions okay so you can move forward
00:57 - back left and right so let's go to the
01:01 - code example
01:04 - so you have to move them to their
01:07 - birthday
01:10 - okay
01:11 - okay so first let's do the let's see the
01:15 - canes okay so it's April 1st right now
01:20 - it's on May 5th needs to move one time
01:24 - and orange one two three four times
01:29 - to go to April 1st okay
01:33 - you can also use repeat
01:35 - so Orange Orange let's try this to see
01:39 - if this works should be missing some
01:41 - code
01:42 - okay
01:43 - okay so we need to move orange one more
01:45 - time for the king
01:48 - um
01:49 - we can just use a repeat Loop for this
01:56 - so we have to repeat it four times fine
01:58 - Range four
02:00 - remember to put the tab
02:04 - and then
02:06 - test it two three four okay
02:10 - April first now we're at the K now we
02:12 - need to make the queen
02:14 - okay let's see the queen
02:16 - it is May 4th
02:19 - so here it needs to move to Yellow I
02:23 - mean um May four yellow four yellows and
02:27 - one orange so it's basically the reverse
02:31 - of the cane
02:33 - okay
02:34 - okay so
02:36 - we're gonna use a repeat loop again
02:40 - um I need to move yellow four times
02:50 - four times yeah
03:01 - okay and then let's see
03:04 - okay so the kitten is in the right
03:06 - position
03:06 - April 1st
03:09 - the queen
03:13 - May 4th it's a room
03:16 - trophy unlocked yellow path complete
03:29 - hello again it looks like you did it you
03:32 - managed to make your way through the
03:33 - membership Bravo we knew you could do it
03:35 - in fact we were counting on it who's
03:37 - really suspicious there's only one
03:39 - person who's weird
03:41 - so now he disappears it's a Time
03:43 - rascal you see this place is more than
03:45 - just a merch it's an interdimensional
03:47 - prison one that we cannot Escape but we
03:49 - knew you'd figure it out
03:51 - aha surprise the time engines are back
03:54 - now you're the one who is going to be
03:55 - stuck in this Mansion forever enjoy a
03:57 - new home ha ha ha ha now they escape
04:00 - through the
04:02 - um Port well this is Terror not so fast
04:04 - time agents you're not going anywhere
04:06 - I'm giving you troublemakers a timeout
04:08 - wow you can get them a timeout
04:10 - and then the Rascal says Tara you may
04:12 - have trapped us here once but we won't
04:14 - fall for your tricks again the portal is
04:16 - open you can't stop us you're out of
04:18 - time and so are we so long Chumps
04:24 - tarot that portal leads to this High
04:26 - Mark they'll be able to use it to escape
04:28 - the only way to stop the time orb is by
04:30 - using the Chrono cannons it won't say
04:33 - long for them to charge up the orb so we
04:34 - must stop we must quickly activate the
04:37 - defenses and stop them once and for all
04:39 - now go so now we see our character going
04:41 - to the portal
04:43 - so now we are in a huge um field Rascal
04:47 - yes the time where we can use it to
04:49 - finally escape this place what you again
04:51 - spit up guys they can't catch us all
04:53 - right
04:57 - it's the different corners of the room
04:59 - the control room doors are open inside
05:01 - each controller there's a lever that
05:03 - will activate a Chrono can you will need
05:05 - to activate all four to destroy the time
05:07 - or quick go turn on those cameras so
05:10 - explore excitement in the next video
05:12 - we'll explore a side move
05:14 - there's lots of grass and then there's
05:17 - also one of the time it time
