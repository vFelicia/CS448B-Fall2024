00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia mine is Andrew Taylor in Minecraft
00:05 - education Edition and an escape estate
00:07 - so in the last video we opened up to
00:11 - this portal room and we saw that Rascal
00:13 - is a bad guy with all the other time
00:15 - ages now we're gonna enter these side
00:17 - rooms to get the timing so let's we're
00:19 - going to activate the corona cantons to
00:21 - prevent them from going into the time
00:23 - part yeah Yeti so we entered yetis aside
00:26 - yet there's no way we'll let you in
00:28 - prepare for an avalanche of anguish
00:32 - explore a sidewoon mechanics keep on
00:34 - going
00:36 - this purple thing oh we get jumped we
00:39 - get teleported to the other side yeah
00:42 - let's keep it going now we get another
00:44 - one
00:45 - it's like slime yeah boom okay then
00:49 - let's not fall down
00:51 - okay
00:53 - oh something's here agent looks like you
00:57 - could use some help don't worry I've got
00:59 - your back I can help you activate the
01:00 - candles just show me the way okay so now
01:03 - here our agent is in here and then
01:05 - there's a gold blocking him lever so I
01:07 - think we're gonna go to the league
01:09 - yet he's a bad guy so let me move the
01:13 - agents okay so let's go to code
01:16 - prepare the Cannons there's a lever move
01:18 - the agent to the lever and then pull it
01:20 - down use agents that move to position
01:22 - the agent in front of the lever and then
01:24 - use pull lever down to flip the lever
01:26 - off the agent move function takes one
01:29 - parameter that defines what direction
01:30 - you should move it forward back left
01:32 - right up and down Okay so let's see the
01:35 - code example so here's this move forward
01:37 - three times and then pull over down so
01:39 - ahead of it is a copper block so it
01:41 - needs to move backwards yeah okay so
01:44 - let's just move it back
01:45 - okay let's go to code you can also use
01:47 - repeat Loop so now we're going to make
01:49 - the forward into backward
01:51 - because
01:52 - um it can't move any other direction
01:54 - okay so after backward it's gonna move
01:57 - left left two times
02:01 - oops
02:03 - so now we're gonna make the left and add
02:05 - two lefts
02:10 - so now let's see where it goes bye
02:13 - okay you need to go forward and then one
02:17 - more left okay
02:21 - so now we're going to do agent dot move
02:23 - and we're gonna do forward
02:27 - and then we're gonna move left again
02:32 - agent dot move and then we're gonna do
02:34 - the left now let's see what where that
02:37 - takes us
02:38 - so now it's here we need to move forward
02:40 - two times to get to the gold block and
02:43 - move right one time
02:45 - forward two times then right one time
02:50 - so now we're gonna do Asian dot move and
02:52 - we're gonna do forward
02:55 - two times
03:02 - okay now let's see where that takes us
03:07 - okay
03:08 - so now we only have to go right when
03:10 - blocking them we can use to flip the
03:12 - lever function because I think that
03:14 - there's a gold block because that's
03:16 - where we can flip the lever okay
03:20 - don't move I'm gonna do right
03:24 - right
03:25 - and then when you have to pull up or
03:27 - down now it should work so pull now
03:30 - puzzle solve and now all those blocks
03:31 - became Emerald Block yeti abominable
03:34 - human this isn't over so now puzzles
03:41 - he went back out
03:47 - let's go so now Yeti's joined to Rascal
03:50 - oh the Chrono can't it just pops I don't
03:53 - know it's so cool Explorer side so now
03:55 - it's starting to spit so now should we
03:57 - go and explore another one sure
04:00 - let's go to that one
04:03 - this one
04:05 - there it is
04:08 - so let's go this way because there's a
04:11 - Teleport Banshee there is no opposing us
04:14 - soon will be gone and you'll be trapped
04:16 - to your shrieking and song so that's
04:18 - kind of hard
04:22 - slime
04:24 - okay
04:25 - no keep on going
04:29 - so all the rooms look different this has
04:31 - more has a blue yeah this man she is
04:34 - blue
04:38 - I'm almost there okay we're here it's
04:41 - another reason
04:42 - so now we have to go to this bar first
04:45 - okay so that's moved right
04:48 - free time so we can use a repeat Loop
04:50 - okay
04:52 - okay so it's the same thing
04:54 - okay so here we can delete this I'm
04:57 - gonna delete this and then we're gonna
04:58 - do for eye in range
05:01 - we're gonna do three times
05:05 - and then we're gonna do
05:07 - H agent dot move right do right okay so
05:11 - let's see where that gets us okay right
05:14 - there so now we have to move forward two
05:16 - times and then left one time
05:26 - okay so we're gonna remember to remove
05:29 - the tab we're gonna do agent dot move
05:31 - and do forward two times
05:38 - and then we're gonna move it left one
05:41 - time so we'll go to the gold block so
05:44 - now we still have the pull level
05:45 - function so that's gonna pull the lever
05:47 - and puzzle saw
05:49 - again yeah this is Banshee ah I didn't
05:52 - think you had a ghost of a chance so he
05:54 - underestimated us okay so now we can
05:57 - explore another side
05:59 - so now Ben she is also returning to the
06:01 - Moon chamber
06:03 - now there's another Crown location no
06:07 - there's two more
06:10 - quickly
06:12 - quickly now this one has a lot of grass
06:15 - okay what is it it's Gremlin
06:17 - your kind never learns your malfunction
06:20 - is inevitable and now let's go here it's
06:23 - now this fake water it's just Glitz
06:25 - glass
06:27 - okay boom Oh we went over here
06:31 - okay so then we keep going
06:34 - there's a lot of plants in here this is
06:36 - probably the god
06:37 - okay what the what's up here oh my gosh
06:40 - so now this is
06:42 - not on the floor it's on the walk so
06:46 - first we need to move forward three
06:48 - times then down so we can use a repeat
06:50 - Loop okay
06:52 - it's the same instructions again
06:57 - no
06:58 - move three times so we can change the
07:00 - right to forward
07:04 - then we have to move down
07:11 - and then we're going to do we can delete
07:13 - this one
07:15 - for now
07:16 - so now we're gonna run it okay okay
07:19 - oh
07:21 - let's do it again three times do it
07:24 - again
07:25 - that wrong
07:27 - okay
07:29 - so now we have to move forward three
07:31 - times again
07:33 - and then move up
07:37 - for I in range
07:43 - three and then Asian dot move and
07:47 - forward and then what agent that move up
07:50 - okay
07:52 - now we're in the right
07:54 - okay so now we have to move up one more
07:57 - time one more time
08:02 - so we're into agent dot move
08:05 - and do up okay so let's run it again
08:09 - so now we have to move forward one two
08:11 - three four five six times so our repeat
08:15 - Loop is gonna help a lot or else you
08:17 - have to write
08:19 - um write agent that moved forward six
08:20 - times and that's a lot
08:22 - okay so we're gonna do six times
08:25 - and then we're gonna do agent dot move
08:28 - forward and then I think we have to wait
08:30 - double
08:34 - you can do it single order
08:37 - okay so now we have to move down to two
08:39 - times
08:41 - and then we can flip the lever
08:46 - so we're gonna make it move down two
08:48 - times
08:50 - so now we're gonna run it and it should
08:52 - flip the lever
08:54 - so now I did puzzle solved
08:56 - Gremlin so you figured out the Gizmo no
08:59 - matter it won't stop us so they're so
09:01 - confident that they'll steal away
09:03 - let's go to the final chamber
09:08 - so
09:09 - we went right through
09:12 - we can walk way through the can that is
09:14 - crazy okay so let's go tell us one more
09:17 - I think it's pixie
09:19 - dude this is the pink one there's a lot
09:21 - of magma huh you really think you can
09:24 - defeat us you're living in a fairy tale
09:26 - they keep tallness yeah okay explore a
09:29 - sidewoon it's actually lava but it's
09:32 - under glass yeah
09:34 - so these these are all themes maybe
09:37 - we've been through all of these rooms
09:40 - before
09:42 - I remember the guard
09:47 - let's keep going okay so now it's here
09:49 - oh yeah so first let's go to the sides
09:53 - because the middle takes a little longer
09:55 - I just go forward right yeah spacing
09:59 - that way so forward two times
10:08 - okay so we're gonna go down here okay
10:12 - most of our code except the pullover
10:14 - down
10:19 - okay so first we're gonna do agent dot
10:22 - move I'm gonna do four one or two two
10:31 - now we're gonna see where that takes us
10:33 - okay so now we have just have to move
10:35 - down one one two three four times and
10:39 - then it will be quicker than the middle
10:40 - a little
10:42 - okay so we gotta use a repeat Loop
10:46 - so for I in range we're gonna do four
10:51 - times
10:52 - we're gonna do agent dot move we're
10:55 - gonna do down right yeah
10:58 - so now let's see and it should be really
11:00 - close now we have to walk backwards two
11:03 - times and then move down two times
11:06 - sitting around do agent dot move
11:08 - backward
11:11 - I'm gonna do that two times
11:14 - and then down two times
11:22 - you just move down and then another time
11:30 - so now we should flip the lever okay and
11:32 - activate the final Chrono Cannon puzzle
11:36 - saw let's go
11:37 - what impossible nobody puts pixie in a
11:40 - corner you were never in a chord okay
11:42 - let's spit spin around and go to the
11:45 - exit fix it that way no it's backwards
11:50 - oh it is though
11:54 - that's not all the chronic units should
11:57 - be activated and we should destroy their
11:59 - time portal in the next video
12:03 - oh we walk right through it again good
12:05 - work now that all four cannons are ready
12:07 - we can take down the defenses on the
12:09 - time warp and stop the time ages they're
12:12 - all staring at us so now we still need
12:14 - to code the time cannons in another
12:16 - video
12:17 - well that was fun and that's it for
12:20 - today thank you for watching Remember to

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia mine is Andrew Taylor in Minecraft education Edition and an escape estate so in the last video we opened up to this portal room and we saw that Rascal is a bad guy with all the other time ages now we're gonna enter these side rooms to get the timing so let's we're going to activate the corona cantons to prevent them from going into the time part yeah Yeti so we entered yetis aside yet there's no way we'll let you in prepare for an avalanche of anguish explore a sidewoon mechanics keep on going this purple thing oh we get jumped we get teleported to the other side yeah let's keep it going now we get another one it's like slime yeah boom okay then let's not fall down okay oh something's here agent looks like you could use some help don't worry I've got your back I can help you activate the candles just show me the way okay so now here our agent is in here and then there's a gold blocking him lever so I think we're gonna go to the league yet he's a bad guy so let me move the agents okay so let's go to code prepare the Cannons there's a lever move the agent to the lever and then pull it down use agents that move to position the agent in

times and then left one time okay so we're gonna remember to remove the tab we're gonna do agent dot move and do forward two times and then we're gonna move it left one time so we'll go to the gold block so now we still have the pull level function so that's gonna pull the lever and puzzle saw again yeah this is Banshee ah I didn't think you had a ghost of a chance so he underestimated us okay so now we can explore another side so now Ben she is also returning to the Moon chamber now there's another Crown location no there's two more quickly quickly now this one has a lot of grass okay what is it it's Gremlin your kind never learns your malfunction is inevitable and now let's go here it's now this fake water it's just Glitz glass okay boom Oh we went over here okay so then we keep going there's a lot of plants in here this is probably the god okay what the what's up here oh my gosh so now this is not on the floor it's on the walk so first we need to move forward three times then down so we can use a repeat Loop okay it's the same instructions again no move three times so we can change the right to forward then we have to move down and then we're going to do we can delete this one
