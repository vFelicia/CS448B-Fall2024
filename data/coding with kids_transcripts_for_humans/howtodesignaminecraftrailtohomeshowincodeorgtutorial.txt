00:00 - welcome to cooking with kids my name is
00:04 - and my name is andrew today we're on
00:05 - coda on and this is a project i made
00:08 - called rail to home so as his name
00:11 - is you know that the agent
00:15 - will make a rail that connects you to
00:18 - your home so it's first here it's a
00:22 - function
00:22 - call function one let's go place the
00:25 - rails and move forward
00:27 - or you can change one
00:31 - so functions over here in the code you
00:34 - need
00:35 - a lot of function ones but you don't
00:37 - even need a function too
00:40 - so these are how you built a rail all
00:44 - the way to
00:45 - home so first repeat ten times
00:49 - do function one so it repeat ten times
00:52 - actually built a rail
00:54 - then repeat five times in function one
01:25 - repeat two times turn back repeat two
01:27 - times turn right
01:30 - times still function one so only suppose
01:35 - back to home so let's see
01:39 - so the agent will start building the
01:41 - rail
01:42 - just explore the world without crossing
01:45 - the bridge
01:46 - while we let the agent build there's
01:49 - trees
01:50 - and grass dirt go on the rail we can't
01:54 - see the agent
01:56 - we're on a minecart well i agent really
02:00 - built so slow racing
02:02 - it turns by itself you don't need to
02:03 - touch the keyboard
02:05 - and it will turn except over here it's
02:07 - stuck because there's a torch there so
02:10 - yeah you need to turn because you can't
02:13 - even break the tool
02:15 - and bump the door and then you need to
02:17 - go here that's to go through your front
02:19 - door and
02:33 - and this is like a whale through like
02:35 - the middle of the
02:37 - island so i'm gonna stop off here
02:42 - and there is some stone
02:45 - yeah and there's a river
02:49 - and you when you go on the rail you can
02:51 - go all the way back to the spawn
02:53 - point and it was hit
02:57 - there's an island yeah but you can't go
03:01 - yeah because you can't walk on water on
03:03 - this one you need a code
03:05 - the agent to build anything to
03:08 - go over well yeah
03:18 - oh yeah oh i can look
03:22 - look i'm looking under the leaves and
03:25 - blinking
03:26 - [Music]
03:28 - go back to the spawn point
03:31 - and then we set and we're going to just
03:33 - like follow the agent
03:35 - okay
03:38 - i want a different really built very
03:41 - slow you can use the arrows here or the
03:45 - arrow keys on your
03:46 - computer it's the sd or on an ipad or
03:49 - iphone
03:50 - you can still use the arrows on the
03:52 - screen yeah
03:54 - see it backed up or else it will
03:57 - turn on the wall
04:01 - you can literally like go on to the
04:03 - agent
04:04 - and squish him see
04:08 - he doesn't care he doesn't even take any
04:12 - damage
04:14 - agent why don't you react
04:20 - you can't walk on water or break
04:22 - anything so you need a
04:23 - like code agent to do everything for you
04:27 - except open the doors and stuff and ride
04:30 - on your
04:31 - car where are you
04:34 - are you going i mean i want to close the
04:36 - door
04:37 - then you need to press space in front of
04:39 - the door
04:50 - the agents just stand there after it's
04:52 - finished with the code like this
04:57 - that was a rail to home yeah
05:01 - now you don't need to oh there's the
