00:01 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - cleia my name is Andrew today we're in
00:05 - Minecraft education Edition and in the
00:07 - hour of cod Escape esate so it says
00:09 - click the logo to begin so let's click
00:11 - it Minecraft
00:15 - presents Escape estate so right now
00:18 - we're in the woods let's see it's a
00:23 - person I think it's us okay so let's
00:27 - see we go into somewhere
00:33 - okay
00:34 - anyways welcome welcome the following
00:37 - tutorial will teach you the basics of
00:38 - navigating Minecraft so we're just going
00:40 - to skip the tutorial because we already
00:42 - know how to use Minecraft but if you
00:44 - don't you can start the tutorial on
00:46 - Minecraft yourself okay so we're going
00:49 - to skip the tutorial okay let's see so
00:52 - now there's a man in a suit called Dr
00:56 - Bowski hello I'm Dr DOD Bowski I see
01:00 - you've received my invitation do you
01:01 - think you have what it takes to Escape
01:03 - the Mansion by Dawn and claim the 1
01:04 - million emeralds excellent now head to
01:07 - the front door to begin your challenge
01:08 - let's go so we have to complete um a CH
01:13 - uh some sort of challenge or a set of
01:15 - challenges to get 1 million
01:17 - emeralds what's happening so the house
01:20 - is turning into a monster and then it's
01:21 - swallowing Us in that's weird okay so
01:24 - now we're in the house and we search
01:26 - room for
01:28 - particles
01:30 - so there seems to be something in
01:33 - underneath it's the agent hello is
01:36 - someone there oh my a human do you think
01:38 - you could help me I can't seem to open
01:40 - this floor I think my code may be broken
01:43 - do you think you could take a look and
01:44 - see what's wrong with
01:45 - it great if you can get me out of here I
01:48 - will return the favor and help you
01:49 - escape the attic which programming
01:51 - language would you like to use so we're
01:53 - going to use
01:54 - pipon okay first see that cursor over
01:57 - there on this floor it needs to move for
01:59 - three blocks to reach your trap door but
02:01 - it isn't working press C to view the
02:02 - code okay so we need to move the cursor
02:05 - to the trap door and open it so add a
02:09 - tutorial Green Path part one the box
02:11 - with the arrow on the floor is your
02:12 - cursor you use the cursor to liulate
02:16 - blocks to solve puzzles throughout the
02:17 - experience in this activity you use it
02:20 - to open the trap door and release the
02:21 - agent use move cursor function to POS
02:24 - the cursor and open trap door function
02:26 - to open the trap door you have selected
02:28 - so only valid move we have right now is
02:31 - orange okay so let's see the code
02:33 - example it's going to move the cursor
02:35 - two times and open the trap door but
02:38 - we're not under the trap door yet so we
02:39 - mean so I think we need to move three
02:41 - times okay let's see code here so let's
02:45 - add one more so you can also use a
02:48 - repeat
02:49 - Loop but we're just going to do
02:54 - it
02:57 - okay Orange so now it should the trap
03:01 - door should get to the trap door and
03:03 - open it okay open great it's open that's
03:06 - strange I still can't seem to get out
03:08 - can you check the code again and make
03:10 - sure I'm moving up two blocks okay so
03:12 - now it's called MPC so now we have to
03:16 - move the agent up two blocks to get out
03:19 - of the uh trapo okay let's see now the
03:23 - TR that the trap door is open you need
03:25 - to move the hent up two blocks to set it
03:27 - free use the H use the agent. move
03:30 - function to move the agent up the agent.
03:33 - move function takes one parameter that
03:34 - defines what direction it should move so
03:37 - we can move forward back left right up
03:39 - or down so let's see the code example
03:42 - it's going to move the agent one time
03:44 - but needs to move up two times okay so
03:46 - let's see we have to add one right here
03:50 - agent. move
03:56 - up
03:58 - okay
04:00 - up okay so the agent moves up two times
04:03 - thank you you fixed my coat now I'm in
04:05 - range to open the green door for you the
04:07 - path Behind the Green Door is an easier
04:09 - one you can take that path or talk to me
04:11 - again if you want to try opening the
04:12 - yellow door so we're going to try
04:14 - opening the yellow door so let's talk
04:16 - MPC so you want to try opening the
04:18 - yellow door for that I'll need more
04:20 - power luckily I can charge off of the
04:22 - Moonlight all we have to do is open the
04:24 - skylet above huh my code isn't working
04:26 - right try check in the my code to make
04:28 - sure that all four traps in ceiling or
04:31 - opening okay so let's look the cursor is
04:35 - on the on the roof now so now we need to
04:38 - open all four trap do okay so now we
04:41 - have more directions we have magenta
04:44 - which moves the cursor back blue which
04:46 - moves the cursor left and yellow right
04:49 - and orange forward okay so let's see the
04:52 - code
04:53 - example so it's yellow yellow yellow so
04:57 - opens one but it goes out of the thing
05:01 - okay so you can also use the repeat Loop
05:04 - for the same thing okay so over here
05:06 - let's see so open trap door move cursor
05:09 - yellow yellow okay so first we have to
05:13 - do a open trap door between the yellow
05:15 - and orange so do open trapdoor function
05:21 - then we're going to do another orange to
05:24 - get to the next
05:27 - trapo so now we're going to run it
05:32 - okay so now we got to the third trapo we
05:35 - have we have to open it and go to to we
05:38 - have to move blue so
05:41 - first open
05:45 - trapo and then we're going to do move
05:50 - cursor we're going to do
05:53 - blue and then we're going to do that two
05:57 - times move cursor
06:00 - blue finally we're going to open the
06:03 - trapo so we open the last trap door run
06:08 - it let's
06:11 - open okay let's see open the first one
06:15 - open the second one open the third one
06:18 - oh
06:24 - see
06:28 - move
06:31 - [Music]
06:36 - tyo okay let us
06:40 - St so now um the agent is drawing power
06:43 - from the Moonlight Wow way to go I've
06:45 - opened the yellow door for you now head
06:47 - through if you like or if you really
06:49 - want a challenge talk with me again to
06:50 - try opening the red door so we really
06:52 - want a challenge so let's open let's
06:54 - talk to it again we need to work
06:55 - together to get into the red door it
06:57 - will only open if I'm standing on the
06:59 - Gold Blocks let's give it a try can't
07:01 - get there how about a little help there
07:04 - th okay his code never works okay so
07:08 - here we have iron blocks blocking the
07:11 - way to the gold blocks gold block and
07:15 - there's a
07:18 - l so now we need to move the
07:21 - agent to move on the gold blocks but
07:25 - first it says to open the red door both
07:27 - you and the agent will have to work
07:28 - together flip the Leever to bring up the
07:31 - Iron Wall then move the agent then we
07:33 - have to left click then the Iron Wall
07:36 - will raise okay now the asent can
07:40 - move okay so let's see the coding
07:43 - sample so it's just going to move
07:46 - forward so this is the shorter way so
07:48 - you have to use a repeat loot let's see
07:50 - how many blocks we need it
07:52 - go
07:54 - one 1 2 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
08:02 - 15 16 17 18 let's try I think it's 18 No
08:06 - 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
08:13 - it's just 14 okay let's try 14 okay so
08:17 - here we can delete all all of them
08:20 - except one so all of them okay you can
08:23 - delete one and then um do the repeat
08:26 - Loop but we can just delete all them and
08:29 - then make the rep Loop so remember to
08:32 - leave a tab inside the repat
08:37 - loop okay so now that should work and he
08:41 - the agent will go go on the gold blocks
08:44 - okay all the doors are open now choose
08:46 - the path you want to take each path has
08:48 - a different difficulty green is easier
08:50 - red is harder and yellow is somewhere in
08:52 - between so long human perhaps our past
08:54 - will cross again
08:55 - someday so in the next video we're going
08:58 - to go into that red door look the gold
09:00 - blocks turn red block yeah well that was
09:04 - fun and that's it for today thank you
09:06 - for watching Remember to smash like

door move cursor yellow yellow okay so first we have to do a open trap door between the yellow and orange so do open trapdoor function then we're going to do another orange to get to the next trapo so now we're going to run it okay so now we got to the third trapo we have we have to open it and go to to we have to move blue so first open trapo and then we're going to do move cursor we're going to do blue and then we're going to do that two times move cursor blue finally we're going to open the trapo so we open the last trap door run it let's open okay let's see open the first one open the second one open the third one oh see move tyo okay let us St so now um the agent is drawing power from the Moonlight Wow way to go I've opened the yellow door for you now head through if you like or if you really want a challenge talk with me again to try opening the red door so we really want a challenge so let's open let's talk to it again we need to work together to get into the red door it will only open if I'm standing on the Gold Blocks let's give it a try can't get there how about a little help there th okay his code never works okay so here we have iron blocks blocking the way to the gold blocks gold block and there's a l so now we need to move the agent to move on the gold blocks but first it says to open the red door both you and the agent will have to work together flip the
