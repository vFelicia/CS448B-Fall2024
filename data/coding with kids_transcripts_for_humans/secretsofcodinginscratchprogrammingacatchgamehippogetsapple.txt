00:03 - my name is colleen and today we're in
00:05 - scratch i'm going to show you one of my
00:08 - games i made all by myself it's called
00:11 - hippo get apple
00:13 - so i'll find people will trying to get
00:15 - apples
00:19 - so inspired you can make a lot of games
00:22 - projects and animations
00:28 - so right now it's floating so it has the
00:30 - white screen
00:31 - [Music]
00:33 - yeah it's called hip forget apple
00:35 - because you have to
00:36 - up arrow hippo go up down arrow hip and
00:39 - go down
00:40 - so try to get the apple
00:46 - when you get an apple you will add a
00:49 - four
00:51 - but sometimes when you don't get the
00:53 - apple it doesn't
00:54 - [Music]
00:56 - have a score i want so here
00:59 - there's the hippo code so
01:03 - when green flag is quick
01:06 - clicked set score to zero so when the
01:09 - match
01:09 - [Music]
01:12 - zero because i
01:15 - clicked the green flag then forever
01:18 - if the hippo was touching the apple then
01:22 - the score would change by one so add one
01:25 - then wait one second
01:31 - okay so when up arrow key
01:34 - pressed change y by ten so the y
01:38 - and change y by 10 means it will go up
01:42 - so see
01:42 - [Music]
01:46 - i'm pressing the up layer right now
01:48 - [Music]
01:51 - it's going up
01:54 - i'll be seeing by when down
01:58 - arrow key pressed change
02:01 - by -10 so it will go down
02:05 - so over here it says
02:08 - when green flap is clicked
02:11 - the hippo will say time to fly for two
02:14 - seconds
02:16 - then over here there's another code
02:19 - there's a lot of hidden codes
02:23 - it says
02:30 - so when the green flap is
02:33 - clicked forever next costume so has
02:36 - costumes here
02:41 - so it has typical a and hippo b
02:45 - so it will keep like flapping its swing
02:59 - x by 2 250 so
03:02 - x is this so it will be that the
03:05 - width and chain then repeat 32 times
03:10 - change x by minus 15.
