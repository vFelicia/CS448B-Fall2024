00:00 - hi it's Jenny from coding workshops for
00:02 - kids
00:03 - I just want to showcase our Python
00:05 - programming games that we've been
00:09 - working on so this is a turtle racing
00:12 - game that clever Python programmers have
00:17 - been working on lately so I'm just gonna
00:19 - run this so you can actually see how the
00:23 - turtle racing game works and there you
00:26 - go it's going ahead and creating 14 race

00:42 - win ah oh it's ivy you want a turtle
00:47 - racing game so you can see all the
00:50 - Python programming on this side the left
00:52 - hand side of the screen and we get to
00:56 - use lots of different functions and
00:59 - we've looked at pin ups pinned down
01:02 - functions loops we've defined Turtles
01:06 - and giving it a shape color and we've
01:11 - done a lot of practice in importing
01:14 - functions from the Python library as
01:17 - well so if you would like to join our
01:20 - Python programming workshops on a Sunday
01:24 - afternoon please do so and let's program
01:28 - together
