00:01 - this video will take you through some of
00:03 - the features and tools that you have to
00:06 - work with when you are creating your
00:08 - first scratch project when you open up
00:12 - your scratch project and click on create
00:14 - you will find that you'll get a default
00:16 - sprite and the default sprite is your
00:20 - cat sprite that you can work with up the
00:25 - top here let's have a look at some of
00:26 - the tools that you have to work with if
00:29 - I want to duplicate a sprite I can
00:36 - always use this duplicate icon up here
00:39 - click onto that click onto the sprite
00:43 - that I want to duplicate and there you
00:45 - have it there you have your two
00:48 - different sprites that I've just
00:51 - duplicated I may decide that I actually
00:55 - don't need a second sprite so I can
00:58 - click onto my little scissors icon this
01:01 - is to delete click onto that and then
01:04 - click on to the actual sprite that you
01:06 - want to delete and there you go sprite
01:09 - gone for a particular project that I'm
01:13 - creating
01:14 - I may need a sprite that's actually a
01:16 - little bit bigger in size so I click
01:19 - onto my grow tool and click onto the
01:23 - sprite and I want to make it grow P and
01:26 - there you have it well that looked a
01:30 - little bit too big for me so it may want
01:32 - to shrink it a little bit so next to the
01:34 - grow I've got my shrink tool click onto
01:38 - that once and then click onto the price
01:42 - and there you go up the top here where
01:47 - I've got untitled eight this is where I
01:49 - want to give my scratch project a name
01:54 - so you could call it whatever you like
01:58 - but for this particular exercise I'll
02:02 - just call it my very first rage project
02:05 - and you can see that it's now saving the
02:11 - file name and I may take a couple of
02:14 - seconds for it to save whilst it's doing
02:17 - that let's look at some of the other
02:19 - tools and features I'm a disciple I
02:23 - scratch project that I need a lot of
02:25 - different characters so let's go and
02:28 - open up what options we have down here I
02:32 - can click on to choose right from
02:34 - library so I'll just go ahead and do
02:37 - that and there you have it opens up a
02:42 - sprite library categorized by all the
02:46 - different categories that you have the
02:49 - scenes and all the different types and
02:52 - if I scroll down you can choose lots of
02:55 - different sprite characters to work with
02:57 - so let me just choose the bat and click
03:00 - OK and there you have it so I've got
03:05 - another sprite character that I've
03:07 - opened up now I'm clicking onto the back
03:10 - here but I may want to add a little bit
03:14 - of my own a drawing or customize it or
03:17 - painted or make it different so I can
03:21 - click onto my paint new sprite and there
03:25 - you have it I can grab a pen tool which
03:30 - is the brush I can change the thickness
03:35 - of my brush I can click on to the type
03:40 - of color that I want and this is where I
03:43 - can start creating my different
03:44 - character or my new sprite
03:48 - they have it I think all this
03:55 - Curly's spaghetti and there is my new
04:03 - sprite that I've just created called
04:06 - curly spaghetti I may want to actually
04:12 - just hide my curl in spaghetti for the
04:14 - moment so I can click onto my little
04:16 - blue icon here won't put the eye and
04:20 - then where it's got the show I can just
04:23 - uncheck this and there you have it
04:26 - it doesn't mean I've deleted it it's
04:28 - just hidden from view so I can just work
04:31 - on the other sprites whilst I can come
04:34 - back to this particular sprite later on
04:39 - you may already have a image that you've
04:43 - saved into your folder or into your
04:47 - computer that you may want to use as a
04:49 - sprite character so that's what you can
04:52 - do when you click onto that if you
04:54 - actually want to take a photo of
04:56 - yourself or a photo of the background or
04:58 - photo of anything that surrounds you you
05:01 - can click onto new sprite from camera
05:03 - take a photo and use that photo as your
05:06 - sprite you can see that my background is
05:11 - just a little bit boring
05:13 - it's a whitespace background and if I
05:16 - want to make it a little bit more
05:17 - interesting I can always come down here
05:20 - where it's got new backdrop click onto
05:23 - the little image icon and what this does
05:26 - it brings up all the different backdrops
05:29 - that I could use for my scratch project
05:33 - just to make it things a little bit more
05:35 - interesting and exciting so again you've
05:39 - got all the different categories you've
05:40 - got all the scene that you can choose
05:42 - from so maybe I can click on to nature
05:46 - and see what I've got
05:48 - and maybe I'll pretend that today for my
05:52 - scratch prototype that they're in a hay
05:54 - field and there you have it now doesn't
05:59 - that make my scratch project a lot more
06:02 - interesting than just having a white
06:04 - background similar to the sprite tools
06:08 - you can draw your backdrop will paint
06:11 - your new backdrop you can upload an
06:14 - image from your computer or you can take
06:17 - a photo of your new fat drop and there
06:22 - you have it
