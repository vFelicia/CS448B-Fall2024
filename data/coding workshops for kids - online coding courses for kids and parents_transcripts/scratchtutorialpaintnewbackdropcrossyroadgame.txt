00:00 - hi welcome to this scratch video
00:02 - tutorial today we're going to look at
00:04 - how we can um draw or paint our our own
00:07 - backdrop in Scratch by clicking onto
00:10 - this tool here which is a um a way of
00:13 - drawing our um new
00:15 - backdrop so I'm in the uh backdrop area
00:18 - here I'm going to click onto my
00:19 - rectangular tool and click onto my
00:22 - shaded area the first thing that I want
00:24 - to do is basically draw a rectangular
00:27 - shape representing my um concrete
00:32 - pavement or the concrete road part so
00:35 - the bitchman if you like to call that
00:38 - and um there you go so that's my gray
00:41 - area done the next thing I want to do is
00:45 - perhaps put a road going across the
00:48 - rectangular screen so I'll go down here
00:51 - and select a different color and let's
00:54 - just get that rectangular shape drawn
00:58 - onto my gray
01:02 - pavement perfect and the next thing that
01:05 - I want to do is um draw a green grass
01:09 - area right at the top of our um backdrop
01:12 - so I've selected the green and we'll go
01:14 - ahead and draw a grass area there just a
01:19 - bar shape to represent the grassy patch
01:23 - and then the final part of drawing our
01:25 - own backdrop is I might actually use the
01:28 - uh the line tool there there change the
01:31 - color to
01:32 - white and um I might just make the width
01:36 - a little bit wider and start going ahead
01:40 - and drawing some markers on the
01:43 - road so there's one
01:47 - there there's two
01:51 - there okay and I'm making good progress
01:55 - here at the
01:56 - moment so um and don't worry if your
02:00 - lines aren't perfectly
02:02 - straight um it is a drawing after all so
02:06 - let's just get the last marker done and
02:09 - there you have it and this is how you
02:11 - can use your own um paint new backdrop
02:14 - tool and and to create and draw your own
02:17 - backdrops have
02:19 - fun
