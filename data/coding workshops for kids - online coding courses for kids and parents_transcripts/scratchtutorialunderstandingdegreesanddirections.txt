00:00 - hi Jenny from coding workshops for kids
00:02 - this video looks at scratchers
00:04 - directions understanding the directions
00:07 - and degrees when you are programming
00:10 - something in scratch so words like up
00:17 - down right or left a perfectly
00:21 - understood by people but when we are
00:26 - programming the computer needs a number
00:29 - to indicate an exact direction and this
00:31 - is something that we want to explore in
00:33 - this video so all characters or sprites
00:37 - in scratch have their own number
00:40 - directions
00:40 - so you can see that I've programmed a
00:43 - very simple scratch arm project here to
00:46 - say point two mouths point two mouse
00:49 - pointer so as my mouse moves around it
00:52 - points towards the direction of my mouse
00:55 - and you can see that I've programmed for
00:59 - scratch to tell me exactly the direction
01:02 - that my mouse is pointing towards and
01:06 - that's how we can use the code blocks
01:11 - like point two direction ninety degrees
01:14 - so this is point two right or if we want
01:18 - to use a a particular direction where we
01:22 - want the characters to point to left we
01:24 - could use the the code block point two
01:27 - Direction negative nine
01:29 - which in computer terminology it means
01:33 - to point left pointing at 0 degrees up
01:39 - here is telling the computer
01:43 - let's go upwards and pointing down
01:49 - here's some telling the computer to the
01:53 - direction of a hundred and eighty
01:55 - degrees so you can see that when we are
02:01 - learning about programming we are
02:04 - entering into the space of numbers and
02:07 - mats and understanding our degrees in a
02:12 - full a circle and this is how computers
02:16 - understand when we give them
02:18 - instructions to point toward a
02:20 - way or a direction and this simple
02:24 - explanation has been presented by
02:27 - inventor of scratch comm which I'm
02:31 - reposting in this video
