00:00 - hi this sketch video will look at how we
00:02 - can create our own sprite by clicking
00:06 - onto our paint new sprite tool here and
00:11 - we're going to create a bone that we are
00:15 - going to use in our find a bone at game
00:19 - so I'm in my costume I'm in my design
00:24 - tab so I'm going to click onto my brush
00:27 - and down here I might just change the
00:30 - width of my brush just to make it a bit
00:32 - thicker I might grab sort of that beiges
00:36 - sort of yellowy color and let's just go
00:39 - ahead and start drawing the sort of
00:41 - outlines of a bone and we'll make it
00:46 - fill up pretty much the whole screen if
00:51 - you like and we can definitely use our
00:55 - shrink tool later on when we're putting
00:59 - some clothes in to shrink the size to
01:02 - what we need now that I've created a bit
01:05 - of a a bone image I'm gonna use my fill
01:10 - with color tool to actually fill in the
01:15 - color of the bones and let me just click
01:17 - inside and there we have it that's how
01:20 - you can create your own bone sprite
01:23 - using the the paint new sprite tool
