00:00 - hi today let's have a look at the
00:02 - forever block if you're not sure of some
00:06 - of the blocks within scratch you can
00:08 - always jump into the tip section and
00:10 - click onto the different blocks er to
00:13 - learn more about all the different
00:14 - blocks that you have now for the forever
00:18 - block is in the control section so let's
00:22 - just open that up and click on to the
00:24 - forever log so the forever block is what
00:29 - it does it in 1 whatever block whatever
00:32 - instructions whatever triggers that you
00:34 - place inside the forever block it
00:36 - repeats that task over and over again so
00:40 - you don't manually have to click on to
00:42 - something for that action to be repeated
00:46 - so the example that they give here is
00:49 - that we've used a move 10 steps wait
00:52 - half a second and then repeat that
00:55 - action over and over again so let's just
00:59 - have a look at how we can apply the
01:01 - forever block for my scratch project
01:03 - that I want to use I've gone into my
01:05 - sprite library and I've grabbed the J
01:08 - little I may actually want to change the
01:11 - color of my earthbrite so I've gone into
01:14 - my looks tab and I might play around
01:17 - with this block today which is a change
01:20 - color effect if I just click on to this
01:23 - lock just to show you how it works you
01:27 - can see that the color changes each time
01:29 - I click onto this block so for the color
01:34 - to change I have to manually click onto
01:36 - this so this is where I could then use
01:39 - the forever block and help to repeat
01:45 - this task of changing the color over and
01:50 - over again without me having to manually
01:52 - click onto this color block so I've
01:55 - placed my change color blocks inside my
01:57 - forever block while some in the control
02:01 - tab I might even grab the weight one
02:03 - second and place it underneath the
02:05 - change color block and then let's have a
02:09 - click onto this to test it and you can
02:12 - see
02:13 - that the color of my J is changing
02:17 - forever
02:18 - over and over again without me having to
02:22 - click onto my change color block all the
02:24 - time and that's how you can apply a
02:27 - forever block in a particular project
02:29 - that you may be working on
