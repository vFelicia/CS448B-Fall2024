00:00 - hi this cracked video tutorial will look
00:03 - at how you can correct the position of
00:05 - your site when you're creating a game or
00:09 - a protein and it balances of the edge of
00:12 - the screen so click on to do script that
00:15 - I've been working on for my car basicly
00:19 - what we're saying here is done
00:20 - you want the car to move five steps and
00:22 - then if on edge bounce repeat this
00:25 - action until it touches right one and
00:28 - for this particular project right plan
00:31 - happens to be that cat you can see are
00:34 - running and executing these scripts
00:37 - quite nicely however when it bounces off
00:39 - the edge of the screen you can see that
00:41 - the car is upside down and we want to be
00:43 - able to correct that come rotation dial
00:46 - let's dot there are two ways that you
00:49 - can correct that position the first one
00:52 - is where you can actually click onto
00:54 - your car icon and there are rotation
00:58 - scale tools that you can have a look at
01:00 - here I click on to this particular tool
01:03 - we've got the double arrows this is how
01:07 - you can actually set the rotation style
01:09 - for your price so it doesn't appear to
01:14 - be upside-down when you click on to your
01:19 - right program so there you go so this
01:22 - actually sets the rotation star left to
01:26 - right so that it doesn't turn upside
01:29 - down let me scope that and if I unclick
01:34 - tonight another way of correcting this
01:36 - upside-down condition is to actually use
01:39 - a set rotation style left to right
01:41 - blocks looking at this right at the end
01:44 - and let me run this and if that works
01:48 - there you go so now that you've got your
01:50 - path right moving along and once it's
01:54 - our keep the edge excelsis off its texas
01:57 - rotation scale less you're right and it
02:00 - repeats this motion until it's meant to
02:03 - be touching the right one
02:06 - there you go have fun creating your own
02:09 - scratch game
