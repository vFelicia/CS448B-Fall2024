00:00 - hi this video looks at the assignment
00:03 - operator and the equal to comparison
00:06 - operation in Python programming the
00:10 - assignment operator is represented by
00:12 - the one equal sign and the equal to
00:15 - comparison operator is represented by
00:18 - two equal signs for a double equal sign
00:20 - so let's not confuse the difference
00:22 - between the two the equal sign which is
00:26 - represented by the one equal sign is
00:28 - used in assignment statements where we
00:31 - want to store a value to a variable so
00:35 - let's have a look at an example so if I
00:38 - bring across my interactive shell we can
00:42 - say up here that we're saying spam is
00:46 - true so we're signing a value to the
00:49 - spam which is true and that's how we
00:52 - would use the assignment operation
00:55 - whereas the double equal sign is used in
00:59 - expressions to see whether two values
01:01 - are equal so let's have a look at some
01:05 - examples so here we could say that the
01:09 - number 10 is equal to number 10 so we
01:13 - get a true return a true boolean value
01:17 - if we have a look at this example we're
01:20 - saying number 11 is equal to number 10
01:23 - and we will get a false return because
01:27 - this is not the case
01:32 - now they're not equal to comparison
01:35 - operator is represented by an
01:36 - exclamation mark and one equal sign so
01:40 - we have a good example here what we're
01:43 - saying is number 10 is not equal to
01:47 - number 10 and we would get a false
01:50 - boolean value returning hope this video
01:56 - has helped you to understand the
01:57 - difference between the assignment
01:59 - operator and the equal to comparison
