00:00 - hi this video looks at the remove child
00:04 - method to actually delete a HTML element
00:08 - from our list so we've got a function
00:11 - here called remove item and we're using
00:14 - the Dom which is a document we're using
00:16 - the method called get element by ID and
00:19 - we're looking at the the list and this
00:23 - is where we've put in the remove child
00:24 - item method so if we have a look at our
00:28 - body idea our body tag inside it we've
00:32 - got a new div a div section where we've
00:36 - got on click equals remove item this so
00:40 - when I run this code you can see that
00:45 - I've got my two items coming off on my
00:47 - list the other cushion for diamond and
00:49 - I've got woolly socks however if we
00:52 - wanted to delete woolly socks because we
00:54 - actually created a remove item or woolly
00:57 - socks here what I can do is I can simply
01:00 - click on two woolly socks and this
01:02 - should actually delete from my list so
01:06 - let's go ahead and do that now well are
01:09 - there you go so that's how you can use
01:11 - the remove child method to actually
01:14 - remove a specific HTML element from your
