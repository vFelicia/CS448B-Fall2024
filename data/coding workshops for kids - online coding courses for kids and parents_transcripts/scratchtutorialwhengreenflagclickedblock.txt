00:00 - hi this video tutorial will look at the
00:02 - when green flag clicked block so if
00:05 - you're not familiar with some of the
00:07 - blocks in scratch you know you've got a
00:09 - tip section that you can open up so
00:11 - let's jump into my events tab and open
00:17 - this up and we've got a little tutorial
00:19 - here on the when green flag clicked let
00:23 - me click onto that so basically what
00:25 - this does is that it runs the script
00:27 - when the green flag is clicked which
00:30 - means when you've created a scratch
00:32 - project or a scratch game and you want
00:34 - to be able to start the game with start
00:37 - the project you may want to use this and
00:39 - the green flag to actually kick start
00:42 - the game off so we need to apply this
00:45 - particular event block onto particular
00:49 - scripts or unclothed that you want to
00:52 - run so for this example it's got go to x
00:56 - and y coordinate zero move ten tips and
01:01 - then turn 15 degrees forever and apply
01:06 - this action when the green flag clicked
01:10 - is clicked on so let's have a look at
01:14 - how we can actually replicate that
01:16 - example so I'll go into my motions tab
01:19 - and let's just grab my go-to x and y
01:25 - coordinates block I'll click onto my
01:28 - move 10 steps block and let me just
01:30 - click onto the move 10 steps just just
01:32 - to show you how it works so you can see
01:35 - that my cats brain is moving 10 steps
01:37 - which is great but maybe I want my cat
01:42 - right to turn so let's just click onto
01:46 - this again and see how it would so what
01:49 - it's doing is it's moving 10 set and
01:51 - then it's actually turning 15 by 15
01:54 - degrees so we want this action to occur
01:59 - forever and ever
02:01 - so let's just go into my control tab
02:03 - click onto my forever blog drag it out
02:07 - and make sure my script
02:09 - that I want to run a place inside my
02:12 - forever block let's place a go-to x and
02:16 - y-coordinates on top of my forever block
02:18 - because that's what I want to do is I
02:21 - want my cats right to be right in the
02:25 - middle which is a go to X 0 and y 0
02:29 - coordinates and then move 10 steps and
02:32 - then turn 5 15 degrees forever and ever
02:37 - so how do I actually start this project
02:42 - well I'll go into my events click onto
02:46 - my green flag is clicked block drag that
02:49 - out and snap it on the top so let me
02:53 - just get rid of that section here and
02:55 - let's click onto this to see how it
02:59 - works and they have it so when the green
03:04 - flag is clicked it goes right in the
03:07 - middle the center of the backdrop and it
03:11 - moves ten steps and then it turns by 15
03:13 - degrees forever and ever
03:16 - nf and that's how you can apply the when
03:19 - green flag is clicked block let me just
03:21 - stop that and if I'm about to start my
03:25 - game I can click on to my green flag and
03:28 - there you go and that's how you can
03:30 - apply the when green flag clicked block
