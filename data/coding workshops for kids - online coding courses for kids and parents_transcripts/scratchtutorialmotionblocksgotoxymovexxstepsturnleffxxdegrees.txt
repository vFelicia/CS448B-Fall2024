00:00 - okay this video tutorial will look at a
00:02 - couple of motion blocks and look at how
00:06 - we can make a sprite characters move
00:09 - around the screen so I'm in my create
00:13 - project mode and I've clicked into my
00:15 - motions tab where it drops down a list
00:19 - of all the different motion blocks that
00:21 - I can play around with the first one
00:24 - that I want to show you is this
00:28 - particular motion block here which is
00:31 - that go to X&Y coordinates and just to
00:35 - make this exercise a little bit easier
00:37 - to understand I'll just change my
00:38 - backdrop to show you the different
00:44 - positioning that you have within scratch
00:48 - so where the cat is at the moment it's
00:54 - the positioning is all based on the X
00:57 - which is the line going across the
01:01 - horizontal line and the Y coordinates
01:03 - and the Y is the line that's going down
01:06 - which is the horizontal so if you can
01:08 - have a look in here the X and the y
01:12 - coordinates right in the middle of the
01:15 - screen is 0 and 0 so with this
01:18 - particular go to X Y block if I just go
01:22 - 0 and 0 there and click onto this a
01:27 - block to test my cat sprite will
01:31 - actually go right in the middle which is
01:35 - x coordinate 0 and y coordinate 0 if I
01:42 - want my sprite to move into this
01:46 - particular position you can see here
01:50 - that this particular X and y coordinate
01:53 - has already changed the cordon umbers
01:55 - for me so it's saying that this
01:58 - particular position here means it's x
02:00 - coordinate negative 103 and Y is
02:04 - negative 101 so when you have look at
02:08 - the x coordinate or the x axis going
02:12 - across
02:13 - you can see that this side it's the
02:17 - negative and with the y-coordinates the
02:21 - top is positive and when it goes below
02:24 - the x-coordinate it's negative and so
02:29 - that's why I've got a X of negative 103
02:33 - and a y of negative 101 so let me click
02:39 - onto this x equals zero and y equals
02:42 - zero and then I'll click on to go to my
02:45 - x coordinates and my Y coordinates and
02:47 - there you go so that's how you can look
02:52 - at the different positioning of your
02:54 - characters when you're creating a a game
02:57 - or a story or a certain proto
03:00 - in scratch all right so I'll move that
03:04 - aside for the moment and I'll move this
03:07 - one up here let's have a look at this
03:09 - particular move ten steps so what this
03:13 - does is basically what it's saying it
03:15 - will do it will actually move ten steps
03:17 - so let me click onto that so that's ten
03:19 - steps down it's every time I click onto
03:21 - this it's moving ten steps I can change
03:24 - risks on ten to five and you can see
03:28 - what happens after that okay so it's
03:32 - taking five steps instead of ten steps
03:34 - now what I want this to do is I can
03:39 - actually look at my repeat block and
03:44 - [Music]
03:45 - click onto that and see what happens
03:49 - so if repeating the moved five steps ten
03:53 - times if I change the ten to the twenty
03:57 - let's have a look at what happens there
04:01 - you go so it's repeating the move five
04:04 - step 20 times now now I want to be able
04:08 - to move my cat sprite around the screen
04:14 - so I may have a look at my turn left
04:18 - block so if I click on to this where
04:21 - it's got turn left 15 degrees let's just
04:25 - see what happens there you go
04:27 - it's turned left ways towards left 15
04:32 - degrees by 15 degrees and if I click
04:35 - onto my little eye icon here I can
04:37 - actually set the rotation or the
04:41 - direction of my cat's bite back to its
04:43 - original which is sitting at 90 degrees
04:46 - so let's say let's change that 15
04:50 - degrees to 90 degrees and we'll snap
04:54 - that one in now and what I want to do is
04:57 - go back into my control grab my repeat
05:00 - block again and snap it around so all my
05:05 - scripts are inside my other repeat block
05:07 - and we'll say let's repeat that four
05:10 - times and then let's click on to this
05:15 - and see what happens
05:17 - well there you go so it looks like it's
05:20 - moving across up across and then back
05:26 - down again
05:27 - so it's repeating the move five steps 20
05:30 - times then it turns left 90 degrees and
05:35 - then it repeats this whole motion again
05:38 - four times so now let me snap this go to
05:42 - block on top of my repeat block and then
05:46 - click onto that to test there you go so
05:51 - now what I'm saying is go to my ex
05:54 - position and my Y position which is x
05:58 - equals negative 103 and y equals
06:00 - negative 101 which is this position here
06:03 - then I want you to move five steps
06:07 - repeat the movement of the size of 20
06:09 - times then turn left by 90 degrees and
06:14 - repeat this whole action four times now
06:19 - I may want to actually add an event
06:20 - block and so I could say to start this
06:25 - game or to start this project I want to
06:29 - be able to click on to the green flag
06:31 - and I want this particular step to occur
06:36 - so let's click onto that
06:40 - now you have it so that's how you can
06:44 - use some of the motion blocks to get
06:47 - your characters to move around your
06:49 - backdrop or your screen now let's
06:52 - actually change this backdrop to
06:56 - something a little bit more interesting
06:58 - and I may want to go into a space
07:02 - backdrop and we'll go okay to that and
07:05 - there you have it so let me just click
07:08 - onto my green flag and there you go
07:12 - hope you have fun playing around with
07:15 - your motion blocks
