00:00 - hi welcome to this scratch video
00:02 - tutorial today we're going to look at
00:04 - how we can create um our own gron pre
00:07 - racing game and actually paint our own
00:11 - Sprite so this is the actual um car that
00:15 - we are going to draw and paint using uh
00:19 - scratch's uh paint new Sprite tool there
00:23 - which is a little brush tool so if you
00:25 - click onto that takes you to this uh
00:27 - screen editing space where you can
00:30 - actually draw and uh create your own
00:31 - Sprites so this is what we're going to
00:33 - try to uh create so I'll just jump into
00:36 - costume two where I've got a blank
00:38 - screen and let's see how we can um start
00:41 - to create our red racing car so we've
00:44 - clicked onto this uh paint new costume
00:47 - tool takes us to this uh editing screen
00:50 - here the first thing that we want to do
00:52 - is Click onto our rectangle tool to get
00:55 - the body of our car happening and um
00:59 - we'll click onto to the shadeed
01:00 - rectangle tool down here at the bottom
01:03 - and then we'll choose our color which is
01:05 - red now we're going to fill up the uh
01:09 - the screen as much as possible with the
01:11 - body of our uh car and um when we start
01:15 - programming our game we're going to make
01:17 - sure that we will shrink this to its
01:20 - appropriate size but for the moment
01:21 - we're going to make sure that we can
01:23 - fill up um the size of the screen as
01:26 - much as possible with the body of our
01:28 - car so that's our First Step we've drawn
01:31 - the body of our red
01:32 - car the next thing we want to do is um
01:35 - we want to do a um the gray roof on top
01:39 - of the car so we're still in our
01:41 - rectangle tool but this time we'll
01:43 - choose a gray color down here at the
01:46 - bottom and we will draw another um gray
01:51 - sort
01:52 - of
01:54 - rectangle on top of the red rectangle to
01:58 - get our um shape of the roof happening
02:01 - so that's the gray roof there then what
02:04 - we're going to do is we're going to make
02:06 - some um spaces line spaces in between
02:11 - the corners of our gray box just to get
02:13 - a bit of the roof line
02:15 - happening and so at this point I'm going
02:17 - to click onto my line tool and down here
02:21 - I can adjust the width of the line that
02:23 - I want to use so I'm just going to try
02:26 - to get a thicker width and I'll click
02:30 - onto my red again so I can have a bit of
02:33 - a
02:35 - um a line roof happening with the red
02:38 - and I'll just draw a line to the
02:41 - corners and I'll do the same
02:47 - [Music]
02:49 - again and then I'll go to the other
02:53 - corners and I'll do
02:56 - [Music]
02:58 - that and there just finish off this
03:01 - corner here as well so now that we've
03:04 - got that I might jump back into my
03:05 - rectangle tool and I'm in my red color
03:09 - there so I might draw another little
03:10 - rectangle shape on the top of my
03:14 - roof just to get the roof line looking a
03:18 - little bit
03:24 - better there you go and then obviously I
03:26 - can just adjust the sizes so in touches
03:30 - the corners of my roof
03:33 - line and um there you go so now the next
03:38 - thing that I want to do is
03:41 - um perhaps I want to put a sort of a a
03:44 - red um a yellow light here on this side
03:47 - of the car just so I know um the
03:51 - direction that the car will be traveling
03:54 - into so um I might choose my little
03:58 - ellipse tool there which is a circle
04:00 - tool um and I might choose a yellow
04:03 - color there and draw a yellow circle
04:06 - sort of towards the top of my car or the
04:08 - front of the
04:10 - car and then obviously I can just expand
04:12 - the sizes out a little bit and this is
04:15 - just to indicate that this is the front
04:17 - of the
04:20 - car and the last thing that you can do
04:22 - is um you can use the ellipse tool again
04:26 - change the color to the uh black and um
04:30 - if you want to get a little bit fancier
04:32 - then you can start drawing some um
04:35 - wheels for your car so I'll do that one
04:38 - there I might do another one
04:40 - [Music]
04:43 - here and you can see that as I'm doing
04:45 - this I can adjust the sizes as um as I
04:49 - want them to be so I'll do another one
04:53 - there and I might do another one here so
04:57 - let me just click onto that
05:03 - okay and there you have it and that is
05:05 - how you can draw your own Sprite using
05:10 - the paint new costume tool have fun
05:13 - creating your scratch games
