00:00 - yes mine's done did you get zero and
00:06 - then a line and then a number five
00:08 - thumbs up mm-hmm okay
00:11 - so let's move on then so we now know how
00:16 - this right function works and then let's
00:19 - look at number five now so now what we
00:21 - want to do is label each track number
00:25 - let's start with five tracks to begin
00:29 - with and we're gonna have a small sorry
00:36 - tree that's gonna be some complicated
00:40 - code how many likes we need ah so let's
00:43 - have a look so we have from total import
00:47 - so we want to write 0 because this our
00:51 - transition itself from 0 so then what
00:54 - westerns
00:55 - so we're saying forward 20 spaces we
00:58 - don't want our hundred that's too white
01:01 - then we want every 20 pixels yes exactly
01:07 - so I want you to do this so I want you
01:19 - to see exactly what happens when I run
01:22 - this and then I want you to program it
01:24 - yourself so let me just run this you can
01:27 - see what happens and it's as easy as
01:30 - telling Python we want you to create
01:35 - five track marks with numbers going
01:38 - across to see that yep okay so yes Nurik
01:46 - I did 14 nines
01:51 - our ditch food already did you get 14
01:56 - track marks going across yes fantastic
02:04 - okay that fast did you use what did you
02:10 - use
02:10 - make it please let me just run this
02:17 - again because see how I've got in my
02:20 - program right up to five now when I run
02:25 - this can you tell me something that
02:30 - doesn't yes so here okay
02:35 - so this is what I'm really worried is
02:40 - yours running wide no one knows but no
02:47 - one's really know okay so what's your
02:50 - forward spaces
02:51 - I've got forward at 20 steps all the
02:54 - time what number have you been to maybe
03:00 - it's just the size of this green okay
03:07 - I'm gonna stop sharing
03:09 - naari can you share your screen so we
03:12 - can have a look at yours and to see
03:16 - distance looks like right so are you
03:24 - able to can I can you go up and share
03:31 - your screen no change this to from 20 to
03:38 - 40 oh okay that's why cool no external
03:46 - in stead of 20 spaces or 20 he is put in
03:50 - 40 that's why he's track marks are much
03:53 - wider than mine so thumbs up when you've
04:04 - programmed 5 tracks going across and
04:08 - then we can move on three thumbs up no
04:12 - it comes up awesome you guys are cool
04:15 - alright so
04:19 - now what did you notice about
04:24 - programming this up here we can't I have
04:28 - to do what all the time we had to repeat
04:34 - the same instructions several times and
04:39 - that meant we had to physically type out
04:42 - these programs instructions a lot okay
04:46 - what is the better way of programming
04:49 - this Oh
04:52 - we put
