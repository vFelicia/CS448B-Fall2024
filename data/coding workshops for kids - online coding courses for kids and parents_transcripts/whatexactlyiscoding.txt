00:00 - hi it's Denny from coding workshops for
00:02 - kids I'm just going to take you through
00:04 - a new workshop that we launched last
00:07 - week touchdevelop
00:09 - it's a programming environment where you
00:12 - can write your own scripts scripts to
00:15 - create your own games and to create your
00:19 - own apps on all devices so whether
00:22 - you're using an Android and iPhone a
00:24 - tablet or a PC within touchdevelop you
00:28 - can create your own games so let me just
00:31 - take you through a couple of the areas
00:32 - that we had a look at so if I click on
00:35 - to edit it shows that it loads all the
00:40 - scripts and this is basically all the
00:42 - different lines of code which instructs
00:46 - the computer to play the the games that
00:51 - you're about to develop and so whilst
00:54 - you're creating and writing your own
00:56 - scripts here you can see the end result
00:59 - of your game being developed
01:02 - so let's actually have a look at
01:07 - a particular tutorial
01:11 - and like to take you through a little
01:14 - video of what coding is all about
01:17 - welcome to hour of code an introduction
01:21 - to the basics of computer programming or
01:23 - as it's commonly called coding code is
01:26 - all around you and the results of coding
01:29 - are everywhere whether you're posting a
01:30 - tweet watching a YouTube video or even
01:33 - swiping a debit card whatever happens
01:35 - happens because of lines of code in fact
01:38 - just about anything with a plug or
01:40 - battery uses code or computer programs
01:42 - to do things lots of everyday items
01:45 - phones watches microwaves cars have
01:49 - computers in them and they all rely on
01:51 - code to make them work so what is code
01:54 - exactly code is a precise set of
01:57 - instructions a computer can understand
01:59 - think of it as a recipe the instructions
02:02 - need to be precise so whatever you're
02:04 - making turns out the way it should and
02:05 - just like people in different parts of
02:07 - the world speak different languages
02:08 - computers understand many different
02:11 - languages too with names like Python C++
02:14 - Perl and Visual Basic they're all
02:16 - different in their own way
02:17 - and similar to spoken languages we share
02:20 - many of the same basic features today
02:23 - we're going to write some code using a
02:24 - language called touchdevelop but the
02:27 - ideas behind the code applied to any
02:28 - programming language select let's get
02:31 - started to begin
02:33 - welcome to hour of code
02:35 - [Music]
02:37 - so if you think that's fun join us and
02:40 - come to our Sunday workshops that we run
02:44 - at Epping North public school and why
02:47 - not develop your own games and apps with
02:50 - your other mates and buddies and have
02:53 - fun doing it at the same time see you
02:56 - soon
