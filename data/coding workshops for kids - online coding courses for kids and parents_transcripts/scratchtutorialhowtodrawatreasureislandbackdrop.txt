00:06 - so I'm down in the stage area and don't
00:10 - forget that we need to be in the stage
00:11 - area and not in the sprites area so we
00:14 - want to create a new backdrop so we
00:16 - click onto the backdrop and there should
00:18 - be a little paintbrush tool that you
00:20 - click on which will open up this
00:23 - backdrop design area so the first thing
00:28 - that we want to do for our backdrop is
00:30 - we want to choose a green color using
00:35 - our paintbrush tool and what we want to
00:39 - do is draw an outline of our island
00:42 - using this a brush tool so let me just
00:46 - go down here and maybe just change the
00:49 - width of our paint brush tools so it
00:52 - doesn't take me too long I'll choose my
00:54 - color green for my island and let's just
00:59 - go ahead and have fun being creative and
01:03 - destroy an outline of what you want your
01:09 - island to be there you go I'm quite
01:14 - happy with that so the next thing that
01:16 - we want to do is we want to fill this
01:18 - area up with the color green so this
01:21 - time I'm going to click on to my fill
01:23 - with color tool and click on to this the
01:30 - center of my island and there you go it
01:33 - fills up my island with the color green
01:37 - next thing I want to do is I want to
01:40 - fill up the background with a blue color
01:46 - to reflect the blue waters so I'm still
01:51 - on my feel with color bucket tool I've
01:54 - changed my color to blue and I
01:56 - just click on to the white section the
01:59 - background section to fill that up with
02:01 - blue there you go hey my island is
02:06 - starting to look amazing
02:07 - the next thing that we want to do is we
02:10 - want to draw some gold coins to
02:13 - represent the treasure so this time I'm
02:17 - going to use my ellipse which is a
02:20 - circle tool and I might just make sure
02:26 - that the shaded circle tool is selected
02:32 - and I might use yellow to reflect the
02:38 - gold or add my treasure so let's go back
02:43 - to our screen here and perhaps I'll do a
02:48 - couple of gold treasures around here
02:52 - there's one and I might do another one
02:55 - just around here and maybe one more just
03:00 - here
03:06 - now the last thing that you might want
03:08 - to do is click on to your text tool and
03:12 - you may want to add a title using the
03:16 - the text tool and maybe write treasure
03:19 - so let me just change the color into
03:24 - white and I might just do caps and I can
03:33 - just write treasure there and as you
03:37 - know or you didn't know you can change
03:39 - their font styles that's better and
03:45 - there you have it so what we can do here
03:48 - is we can stretch this out a little bit
03:52 - to make it bigger so there you go and we
04:00 - can move this to the corner if you like
04:06 - and that's how you can draw your own
04:08 - Treasure Island backdrop using scratch
04:10 - have fun creating your own games
