00:00 - hi it's Jenny from coding workshops for
00:02 - kids just going to take you through a
00:04 - next workshop we explored looking at a
00:07 - game development within touchdevelop
00:11 - so we can see that we are in the
00:12 - touchdevelop environment so we're
00:15 - starting to look at this game and our
00:18 - mission for this game is to change some
00:22 - codes so we really got to understand the
00:24 - power of coding and how simple changes
00:27 - to some lines of code can turn this some
00:31 - non interesting uninteresting game into
00:34 - into a much more interesting game that
00:36 - becomes a lot more interactive and that
00:40 - gives the the user experience a lot of
00:43 - interactivity as well so our mission is
00:46 - to fix some code to make the game a lot
00:50 - more interesting to help but to avoid
00:52 - some obstacles and to save the bot so
00:57 - we're gonna try to keep him alive by
01:00 - clicking our mouse or touching our
01:03 - screen so that he continues to fly up
01:07 - and down and avoid the obstacles at the
01:09 - same time so and the idea behind the
01:13 - coding concept behind this activity is
01:17 - to see what codes or instructions
01:19 - actually look like and and what it
01:22 - actually instructs the game to do and
01:25 - how quickly then change some lines of
01:28 - code so that the game becomes a lot more
01:31 - interesting and interactive so let's
01:35 - just have a quick look back behind the
01:37 - scenes so this is
01:40 - the the codes or the scripts that you
01:43 - see sitting behind the touch development
01:47 - are starting the touch develop calm
01:48 - environment and you can see that I can
01:52 - click onto my tap here to run the game
01:56 - and you can see that we've got
01:58 - Bakhtiar which is the robot is the main
02:00 - character in the game we can see that
02:03 - there's three sort of lives that he has
02:05 - we can see that he's got an obstacle
02:07 - here and with what's the point system
02:10 - set up at the moment the game's not as
02:13 - interesting
02:13 - so bot is not flying up and down he's
02:17 - not able to fly up in turn at this stage
02:19 - and that's what we need to do we need to
02:21 - add and change a few codes few lines of
02:25 - code so that the bot when we click onto
02:27 - our mouse he's flying up and down and he
02:30 - avoids the obstacles and so we try to
02:33 - save him as much as possible see you
02:36 - next time
