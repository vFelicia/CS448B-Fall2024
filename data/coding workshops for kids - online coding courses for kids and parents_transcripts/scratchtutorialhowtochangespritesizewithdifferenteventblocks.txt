00:00 - hi let's have a look at how we can
00:03 - change the the size of our hats price
00:05 - using lots of different armor scripts
00:08 - and different tools for the first thing
00:11 - I'll show you is the shrinkage all at
00:14 - the top if I click onto that string tool
00:15 - once and then click on to the right that
00:19 - we want to shrink and just keep on
00:22 - clicking on to the best right you can
00:24 - see that it's shrink I want to make my
00:27 - side grow I've always got access to the
00:31 - grow tool we want that once again and
00:33 - then click on to this bright and you can
00:37 - see that my cats is growing back inside
00:40 - so that's a couple of the many ways of
00:44 - changing the sizes of your characters or
00:47 - your sprites what's another way if we
00:50 - have a look at the the looks tab and
00:53 - let's have a look at how this particular
00:56 - block works so this change sides by 10
01:00 - let's just click onto that one to see
01:02 - what happens there you go we can see
01:05 - that my cat is actually increasing its
01:08 - size by 10 as I click onto this block
01:11 - how about if I want to decrease the size
01:15 - of my sprite in this instance I can
01:19 - always change the numbers around so
01:21 - instead of having a positive number we
01:24 - need to put in a negative number to
01:25 - reflect a decrease in their side so now
01:28 - if I click onto these blocks you can see
01:31 - that it is decreasing its size every
01:34 - time I click onto it so that's how you
01:36 - can sort of understand how this change
01:38 - size by block works all right so let's
01:42 - just have a look at some events that we
01:44 - can actually apply but when you're
01:48 - creating a scratch project or a game
01:49 - there are certain events that you may
01:51 - want to trigger so for example arm tab
01:55 - look at this particular event block
01:58 - which is when space keeps
02:02 - change sides by negative tender so let's
02:07 - just change this back to positive and
02:09 - say for example I would like to use my B
02:14 - key so awesome to do that again so here
02:22 - what I'm saying is if I click if I press
02:25 - down on my big here on my keyboard then
02:28 - basically what I'm asking is got to do
02:30 - is to change the size by 10 so now
02:33 - you've got I'm just clicking onto my B
02:34 - key and it seems to be doing what I'm
02:37 - asking too much to do if I want to
02:40 - duplicate this a block script without
02:44 - having to drag everything out again and
02:47 - to change some of my events around so I
02:50 - may want to apply a different scenario
02:53 - where if I press the F key
02:55 - I want to shrink its size by negative 10
02:59 - so let me just click onto my F key and
03:02 - see what happens and there you go now
03:05 - that I'm clicking on to my FK it seems
03:07 - to be shrinking so that is working quite
03:10 - well so let me just grab my change sides
03:16 - by 10 o'clock again and maybe this time
03:22 - I want to right-click and to placate
03:26 - that block
03:28 - [Music]
03:30 - and I want to apply a negative ten so
03:35 - the next set of instructions that I want
03:37 - to apply is that I want my cats right to
03:41 - grow and shrink grow and shrink grow and
03:45 - shrink so what is the instruction that I
03:49 - need to apply what is the program I need
03:51 - to give to scratch so basically of
03:53 - course you change size by ten
03:56 - then I've got changed sides by negative
03:58 - ten
03:59 - let's click onto that is it doing
04:01 - anything no it's really not doing
04:04 - anything because basically scratch is
04:06 - trying to apply these two different sets
04:09 - of instructions all at the same time so
04:12 - it's kind of doing it but it's doing it
04:14 - so fast that you can't actually see any
04:16 - changes occurring so what we need to do
04:19 - is maybe we need to jump into our
04:22 - control tab and give a second set of
04:26 - instruction to scratch to say change the
04:29 - size by ten just wait one second and
04:32 - then change the size I negative ten so
04:37 - let's see if that works
04:40 - there you go so if I click on to it
04:43 - again you can see that the cat is
04:45 - growing and then it waits one second and
04:48 - then it shrinks back by negative ten
04:51 - so but I want this action to be
04:55 - performed on an ongoing basis I wanted
04:58 - to occur forever and forever so I can
05:02 - drag my forever block out and wrap it
05:06 - around my little set of instructions so
05:09 - anything that captured within my forever
05:12 - block it will perform or run this action
05:16 - on an ongoing basis so let's click onto
05:19 - that
05:22 - [Music]
05:23 - it is doing it is performing what is
05:26 - running the script but the action
05:29 - however looked a little bit buggy so let
05:33 - me stop this testing and I may have to
05:37 - apply a wait one second block after the
05:41 - last bit of instructions so I want to
05:46 - change the size by 10 wait one second
05:49 - then decrease the size by ten wait one
05:53 - second and then forever apply this
05:56 - instruction so now let's click onto that
05:59 - and let's see what happens there you go
06:01 - that looks kind of nice and it's running
06:03 - smoothly alright so let me stop that
06:07 - script but when you're creating a game
06:10 - or creating a scratch story or a project
06:13 - you may want to apply a trigger and
06:17 - events so for example whenever I press
06:20 - my green flag to start the game
06:23 - do I want this action to occur well
06:27 - let's just jump into my events block and
06:29 - let's just drag is when green flag
06:31 - clicked and snuff it right on the top
06:34 - and then let's just test it so what I'm
06:38 - doing is when the green flag is clicked
06:41 - forever increase the size by 10 wait a
06:46 - second decrease and then wait a second
06:49 - and forever
06:50 - run this script so let me stop that so
06:53 - that seems to be working now there are
06:56 - different events but you can apply when
06:59 - you are creating different games
07:02 - different situations
07:04 - so let me detach that when green flag is
07:08 - clicked and let's have a look at where
07:13 - you have lots of different characters
07:15 - and lots of different sprites in your
07:17 - scratch game or in your story and nearly
07:20 - what this particular set of actions to
07:22 - occur when a particular sprite is
07:24 - clicked so we can always apply this
07:29 - when this right click blocked right at
07:31 - the top and now they've clicked onto it
07:33 - to test the script it seems to be
07:36 - performing its action quite nicely so
07:40 - I'll stop that at the moment so but how
07:44 - you can sort of change the size of your
07:47 - characters apply different events
07:50 - depending on what type of story or game
07:53 - that you want to create have fun
07:56 - creating your scratch project
