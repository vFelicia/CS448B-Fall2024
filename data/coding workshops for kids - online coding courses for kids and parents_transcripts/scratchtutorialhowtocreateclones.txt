00:00 - this scratch video looks at how you can
00:03 - clone sprites without having to use the
00:05 - duplicate tool so let's jump in and
00:10 - clone my cats right now I'll go into my
00:14 - control setting and I'll go and grab my
00:18 - repeat block then I'll scroll down a
00:21 - little bit further and create clone of
00:24 - myself grab that code block and nest it
00:29 - in between my repeat block what's the
00:32 - event trigger I can use when the green
00:35 - flag is clicked or I can use when this
00:39 - bright is clicked
00:40 - so I'll just go and select when green
00:43 - flag is clicked so basically what I'm
00:46 - saying here is when I click onto my
00:48 - green flag I want you to clone myself
00:52 - ten times so let's go ahead and click my
00:57 - green flag to see alright so can you see
01:02 - the clone of the cat sprite well it's
01:07 - cloned itself ten times so quickly that
01:10 - you haven't had a chance to see it all
01:12 - being cloned but if you go over to your
01:14 - cat and start moving them out you should
01:18 - be able to see ten clones of the cats
01:23 - bright appearing and this is how you can
01:28 - clone your sprites in scratch using the
01:33 - create clone of myself code block
