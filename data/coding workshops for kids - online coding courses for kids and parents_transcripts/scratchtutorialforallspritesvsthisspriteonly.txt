00:00 - hi this video will look at the
00:04 - difference between when you create a
00:05 - variable for all sprites and for this
00:09 - sprite only what is the difference
00:11 - between those two options when you
00:14 - create a variable in scratch you click
00:17 - onto that make a variable it allows you
00:19 - to type in a name that you want to
00:21 - create for your variable and it gives
00:23 - you these two options for all sprites or
00:26 - for this sprite owe me now when you
00:31 - click on to for all sprites and this
00:33 - option will create a variable that all
00:36 - sprites can use if I click on to this
00:40 - option for this bright only what this
00:44 - does is it creates a variable that only
00:46 - the cat sprite can use and you can see
00:52 - up here the variable that we have
00:54 - created it actually identifies the name
00:57 - of the sprite cat as I click on to my
01:02 - icon there I've actually given this
01:03 - write a name called cat and because I
01:07 - have created for this bright only when I
01:10 - was creating a variable it tells me on
01:13 - the screen here that this variable will
01:17 - only apply to this cat sprite and only
01:23 - this cat sprite can use this variable
01:26 - I hope this video has helped you to
01:31 - explain the difference between for all
01:33 - sprites and for this sprite only
