00:00 - hi it's Jenny from coding workshops for
00:03 - kids today we're going to run through
00:05 - strings the real characters in Python
00:09 - programming so python is great at
00:12 - working with numbers but what about when
00:15 - we want to communicate with people so if
00:18 - we want to write programs that people
00:20 - can use and understand well you really
00:23 - need to use another variable type known
00:24 - as strings and strings are what we call
00:28 - text or keyboard characters in a
00:32 - programming language that could be
00:34 - groups or strings of letters names and
00:37 - symbols so basically your name is a
00:41 - string as is your favorite color so a
00:46 - common way to use strings is to print
00:48 - them and we can even use an input
00:52 - function to ask the user to interact
00:55 - with your program and input their
00:58 - responses to a question that you may ask
01:00 - for example what is your name so a
01:04 - common way to use strings as I said is
01:07 - in printing so we want to have a look at
01:10 - a simple program that asks the user for
01:13 - their name
01:15 - it stores their name as a variable and
01:19 - we're going to ask the program to print
01:23 - their name a hundred times so let's just
01:29 - have a look at this simple program as
01:31 - you know we are using a hash tag which
01:34 - is our way of just creating a note to
01:38 - ourselves called a comment so for me I'm
01:42 - saying that I'm creating a Python
01:44 - program ports say my name
01:47 - and I'm going to create a print where
01:50 - it's um a princess screen full of the
01:52 - user's name basically the first step in
01:57 - my algorithm is that I'm going to ask
01:59 - the user for their name so I've got my
02:02 - program there which is a name variable
02:05 - some say the name should equal the
02:07 - import function of the question what is
02:10 - your name the second step is I want to
02:13 - print their name a hundred times so I
02:17 - now I need to use a loop so this is my
02:21 - loop program here so I'm basically
02:23 - saying for X in range a hundred so a
02:27 - loop and print the user's name a hundred
02:30 - times and the third step is I want to
02:33 - print their name followed by a space and
02:37 - not a newline so what I might do here is
02:42 - actually get rid of this rules and just
02:48 - leave it as print name and ended in a
02:54 - continuously printed the name a hundred
02:57 - times across going across the line so
03:00 - let me just run this module and let's
03:03 - watch this program take place
03:11 - so here we are it says what is your name
03:14 - so I'll just type in my name and enter
03:17 - and there you go so this simple program
03:21 - is basically printing my name a hundred
03:24 - times going across each line and not
03:27 - printing my name a hundred times going
03:30 - down the list a hundred times so that's
03:34 - how you can use strings and variables
03:38 - and the print function in Python see you
03:41 - next time
