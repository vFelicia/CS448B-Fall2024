00:00 - hi this quick video tutorial will take
00:03 - you through how we can draw our own a
00:06 - backdrop and create a maze backdrop for
00:10 - our gold maze game they were about to
00:13 - create so I'm in my new backdrops area
00:17 - I'm using my painting new backdrop tool
00:19 - I've clicked onto my rectangular tool
00:22 - and I'll make sure that the shaded part
00:24 - of the rectangular is clicked as well
00:26 - I'm going to go ahead and select a
00:29 - backdrop color that I want to apply so
00:32 - let's just draw a very large rectangle
00:35 - that will probably take up the complete
00:38 - screen so that's done I'm happy with
00:40 - that
00:41 - and now let's start drawing our maze so
00:44 - what we'll do is we'll click onto our
00:47 - rectangular tool again this time we'll
00:49 - select a different color and I might
00:53 - select a like oh well a pink color and
00:57 - let's start drawing our maze so using my
01:00 - rectangular tool let's start drawing
01:03 - some maze shape and make it quite
01:09 - interesting and I'll quickly do this and
01:13 - obviously you can take your time when
01:17 - you are drawing your own maze
01:20 - [Music]
01:26 - [Music]
01:29 - okay so much do another triangle paste
01:33 - that comes down this way
01:39 - [Music]
01:41 - make sure that there are no gap and I'd
01:45 - like to draw another big piece that runs
01:48 - across the bottom like so and you can
01:57 - always vary the thickness of your nave
02:01 - tunnel whichever way you like might have
02:05 - another little peep heading out this way
02:09 - [Music]
02:13 - and have another piece might have
02:23 - another piece sort of coming down out of
02:26 - here increase the thickness of that and
02:34 - why don't we get another peep sort of
02:37 - dropping out from this side and let's
02:49 - just continue so that we can make it a
02:51 - little bit more challenging I might have
02:54 - another tool P sort of coming out this
02:56 - way
02:58 - we've got across a little bit and if I
03:05 - could get another little piece sitting
03:07 - on top of that okay we're almost there
03:14 - might have another little angle sticking
03:17 - out here and maybe another long piece
03:27 - sticking out here I have to make sure a
03:31 - little bit wider and then the final page
03:37 - where we need to have a little bit of an
03:40 - opening and this is where we are going
03:44 - to play our goal point so to create a
03:48 - goal point let's click on to my little
03:50 - circle and a select see the cold color
03:55 - that I might want to use and we might
03:59 - just draw two little circles at the end
04:05 - of the maze and these can represent
04:11 - the goal taste it I want to do one more
04:18 - and have another taste of Kenya here
04:25 - and a little bit bigger okay have fun
04:30 - creating your own main backdrop
