it won't go it'll just slowly move across well maybe not slowly but it will move across the level in a more consistent manner a little slower a little better all right so we're in the qubit game again because it's the easiest 3d game to kind of show off some of this cool stuff and what I want to happen is I want this first platform to actually move across the level and go back and forth so it's a moving obstacle to avoid and there are like 700 different ways to do this in unity but the easiest way is just to create an animation but because we're creating an animation you will have to create a new animation for every single obstacle that you want to move because the exwhat and ycoordinates won't be the same for every object if you wanted it to be the same for every object you'd create empty game objects that were the start and end point and you could lurk between them or move between them or add a force back and forth when they collided like I said there's like 700 ways but we're gonna do the animation way today because I have a soft spot for animation lately all I mean you guys know that I've been doing animation like last like two weeks so I have my object selected here I'm going to choose the animation panel I'm going to create a new animation and I'm gonna call this one move across go ahead and save that to my assets and then I'm going to start recording and then I'm gonna just say so the starting point is here let's go ahead and make it take let's do one second so to get that timeline there that you saw that kind of like shrunk out so we could see more and more time I just zoomed out on the scroll scroll wheel so that changes the frame okay so let's go ahead and move it to the onesecond mark and then I can change the position to the other side of the platform and now I have a keyframe that goes from one to the next if I go ahead and stop that recording and hit play we can see it moves across the screen now it moves across the screen but then restarts and goes back to the other side we wanted to move to the other side not teleport to the other side so let's go ahead and stop the playback I'm gonna move my playhead to that keyframe I'm gonna go ahead and hit record again and then I'm going to move it uhuhuhuhuh we can be fancier than that let's go ahead and stop the recording we're gonna take the this set of keyframes and we're gonna copy them I'm gonna do command C and then go to two seconds command V yeah okay so I just highlighted the first set of keyframes come and see your ctrl C to copy them and then paste them here so now when I play back the animation it bounces because it gets to that second set of keyframes and it's at the beginning position and then it starts the animation over all right now well let's play our game and see if that happened so I'm gonna go into my player here and I'm going to not allow it to move just so that we can don't get past it before it starts moving let's hit play let's see what happens and there we go we've got something that goes back and forth and moves across the platforms and you can do way more stuff with the animation here you can make it rotate you can make it pause on one side before it goes back to the next you could also slow down this animation so in order to slow down that animation what I can do is I can actually open up the animator itself that stores the path in which the animation happens click on the move across animation and there's a variable called speed and we can slow it down to like 0.5 and now it's going to go half as fast and now when we play our game it won't go it'll just slowly move across well maybe not slowly but it will move across the level in a more consistent manner a little slower a little better but it's up to you guys play with that play with the number of keyframes you put in there.put with all that stuff it's totally up to you but that's how you do a moving platform if you make a movie platform drop it in the comments I want to see your game I want to play it I want to fail at it and I will record a video be playing your game and failing at it and post it to the channel
