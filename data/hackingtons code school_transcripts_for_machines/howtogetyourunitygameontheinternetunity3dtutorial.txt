hello everyone today we're going to learn about how to build your project so that it can run in a web browser here's my unity project it's all done and ready to go so i'm going to build it this process is the same on mac in windows today i'm going to be using a windows computer so first i'm going to go up to file and then build settings this will bring up a new window called build settings and i can add in the scenes that i want to be in my game right now i have only one scene and if i wanted to add another scene i can click add open scenes that'll add the scene that's open in the editor right now i can also go to the project view and drag in new scenes if i want to add more i'm going to make sure that webgl is selected as the platform if you don't have webgl installed then wait till the end of the video and we'll show you how to install it then next we have to make sure we have a folder for the project to build into what i usually do is i make a new folder on the desktop of my computer this way it's easy to find then in unity i open build settings and i click build it asks me where do i want to build this project so i'm going to click on the desktop and find the turkey challenge folder that i just made there it is turkey challenge select folder and then it starts building the project don't interrupt it while it's building it's a big process taking your unity project and building it into something that can run in a web browser this is going to take a few minutes now that the project's done building i can go down here it says build completed with the result of succeeded in 27 seconds but we're not done yet we have to actually put this on the internet somewhere for us to be able to use so i'm gonna go to netlifly netlifly.com drop this is where we can host our game it's pretty easy to set up but you do need to make sure that you're signed into an account if you're not signed in go ahead and make an account you will need an email address so if you don't have one ask your parents to help you it's free it's just a way of hosting your unity game on the internet so that anyone can play it once you're all signed in go ahead and drag that folder that has your build in it into the spot that says drag and drop it'll upload and create a website where you can actually run your unity game there we go it works excellent now we can take this and we can post this to hackington's you can submit this just like any other project in hackington's now if you make updates to your project you don't have to create a whole new website you can actually update this link in netlify if you go to netlifly.com you can go to sites and you can see all of the different websites that you have these are all my different unity games that i've made i can click on my most recent one it gave it a random name that i can change if i want and if i want to update it i can go to deploys here i would just drag my new build folder and drag it in and it'll update you don't have to make a new website every time you update your game sometimes your build might not work or you might have a problem building let's talk about some of the common issues that come up say for example you don't have webgl installed it won't let you build a web gl game if this happens open up unity hub and go to installs then find the version of unity that you're using in this case my turkey test project is using unity version 2021.1 i go to installs i find that version and i can add modules here i can select what things do i need to have in this installation of unity in this case i just want webgl support in windows build support once i have those i'll notice that it has little icons here and it's ready to go the other issue that can come up you build your game it uploads to the internet but when you go to play it it won't load and then if you inspect the page you might even see some errors in the console so we're going to change some of the build settings open up build settings and then go to player settings this will bring up a new window make sure that you're looking at the player settings here and then go to publishing settings in this menu and go to compression format and set it to be disabled this will make sure that when you build your project you won't run into this problem if you have any other problems building your project just let us know in the messages let's see what you can build in unity
