look at that throw them through did i just flick a booger at everybody i don't know if i'm an appropriate teacher for scratch jr hey kids welcome to the scratch junior show i'm your host mr matt and you'll need scratch junior downloaded on your ipad or android tablet no it doesn't work on computers or phones so if you don't have it downloaded on your tablet just ask your mom like this mom can i download an educational app that will make me smarter okay that's a bit of much but your mom will probably say yeah sure that sounds great what's cool about scratch junior is you can use your finger for other things like building video games probably should wipe that out this show is for kids kids kids all right so if you've never used scratch junior before then you're probably when you open it up you're going to land on this page and you'll be like where do i push the question mark or well the question mark has a whole bunch of information to answer your questions but i'm going to answer those for you right now right now hold on to your seat so first thing let's do let's hit the home button though you can't see what my finger's doing can you i have too much fun on this show i know okay so here are my projects and it'll probably have an example project if you've never made one but i'm going to go ahead and make my own first project by clicking the plus sign there's so many buttons everywhere what do i do okay calm down breathe everybody first on the left side wait a minute i have to make sure my hand goes the correct way let me point at the right place right there up there at the top you see a scratch cat with a plus sign underneath if you click that plus you can actually add more characters we call them sprites but you can call them characters sprites characters they're the same thing oh there's a rainbowhaired octopus i'm gonna click on that one nothing happened you have to hit the check box in the top corner there once you hit the check box then it adds that sprite or character to your game now i have two characters and i can kind of drag them around that's so cool but they're standing on a white backdrop that's so boring how do i change that well right at the top there's a picture a beautiful picture of a mountain with a blue sky it's very small do you see it click on that right in the top of the middle and then you can change the backdrop what do i want to change this to uh well it's hot right now outside it's summertime so maybe i want to change it to winter i'm going to click the winter theme and then i'll click that check mark there poor scratch cat he's freezing we need to give him some clothes and the octopus is that an octopus i i don't know what do you think what do you think that one is anyways let's start coding first we need to decide which character sprite are we going to code first let's code the scratch cat first so we'll click on the cat so it's selected now look at the bottom there's all these coding we call them blocks these are kind of instructions you give to the game like what's it going to do the first instruction you usually give are the yellow ones so on the far left click the yellow start block and then you'll see on the right side you'll see a green flag i'll just kind of click on it and then drag it you just kind of drag it down look i'll drag them all down so you can see them all and we'll talk about each one no we won't let's just talk about one of them let's talk about the wind clicked there we go wait a minute how do i get rid of them okay so to get rid of the ones you don't want just throw them back into the pile look at that throw them through did i just flick a booger at everybody i don't know if i'm an appropriate teacher for scratch junior perhaps we can hire somebody else in the future anyways what about you do you think you could teach it maybe so i have this starting block here that says when the character is touched or we we'd like to say in programming when clicked or on click okay so when it's clicked what is it going to do let's go to the motion blocks the motion blocks are blue so click on the left to the blue motion blocks and let's let's try a couple here is a move to the right here is a move up oops you have to click on it and then drag it down sometimes there's a delay and then i add too many so i just throw them away let's click these together and see what happens ah there we go now to run the game we just click on well we click on the character huh that's how we programmed it so i'll click the character and he went over one and up one but how far is one one one what one mile did he move one mile did he move one inch units in scratch are actually determined by how far on the screen the character has moved there's a great helper at the top if you go to the very top in the center there's some graph paper click on that graph paper and you'll notice that suddenly the screen has these lines going across it well each one of those squares is one unit of distance so if the cat is going to go over 1 and up 1 watch this when i click them it's the exact same distance on the graph paper we can change this distance by clicking on the number underneath the code block and then choosing a different number i'm going to choose 10. so now he'll go 10 over and then instead of going up let's change that so that he goes down and he goes down 5. now let's click him and he goes over and then down pretty cool now the scratch cat has code but the octopus doesn't actually do anything yet so let's fix that first click on the octopus it's name is tac what a strange name okay so this tac the octopus doesn't have any code in the bottom isn't that funny shouldn't it have code no each sprite or character needs to be coded independently or separately so let's have this sprite do something when the cat touches it isn't that cool so click on the yellow starting blocks and then look for the block that looks like two people are holding hands there we go and let's drag that in there it is it looks like they're arm wrestling it actually means when one sprite touches another so when they're colliding is what we say in programming when they're colliding it sounds funny though oh no the cat collided with the octopus and there was an explosion of ink should we do that that would be funny all right so let's just make it real simple what's gonna happen when they run into each other uh let's have him say something and this to say something is in the purple menu and you'll see it says hi there that's pretty simple hi that's so boring can't we just say something else well click on where it says hi and we can say please don't touch me there we go so i'll click go and then now that code block will run if they're touching so let's put the well we have to put the cat in a position we'll actually touch the of the octopus and it worked it said please don't touch me but just saying it isn't as cool as like hearing it so let's see if we can find a recording block and that's in the sounds right here and well it says there's a pop and then there's a record button let's click the record one ah we can record i'll click the record button please don't touch me and stop all right i'll click the check mark and now we have that recording so instead of having the words i'm going to throw that away i'm going to add that recording right there now let's get them far away and let's reset the game by pressing the green flag and touch the cat please don't touch me please don't touch me it's still going don't touch me please don't that that's funny so after after they collide or touch each other let's have the uh let's have the octopus move to a different location so we'll go and go to the move blocks and we'll let's let him go to the left and then we'll go up let's change this number to eight there we go so this should work pretty well let's start the game again i'll push the cat whoop push the cat once please don't touch me and there he goes he moves away now what i'd like it to do is to go to a different scene now remember we have these backdrops on the right hand side and you'll see a plus symbol you can actually add a new scene to the game oh i want to get rid of that graph paper too so let's click on the the not graph paper there it oop i made it full screen i pushed the wrong one so click on the the graph paper again it will remove it and let's choose a different backdrop and this time let's choose the night scene and i'll push check mark there it is ah now it's in the dark but my characters have all disappeared what happened well the characters all have or the sprites all have their own code and they all live on one backdrop so if you switch the backdrop watch this or the scene those characters may or may not exist depending on whether or not you put them in the game so in scene one there is an octopus and there is a cat but in scene two there's nothing but a cat because they always give you a cat in fact if you want to get rid of the cat just put your mouse over hold down and then click the x button and it's gone now there's nothing it's so boring so let's add something to this scene let's add a pig there we go and then there's a pig in the middle and it doesn't have any code so let's say when the game starts on here when the game starts this piggy will jump up and down this is my one of my favorite code blocks it's called the hop block and you determine how far he hops up by changing the number at the bottom so i'm going to have him go up four there he is and now i want him to keep hopping so what do you do if you want it to keep going over and over again you go to the control blocks which are orange there it is and there's a repeat block so we have a repeat right here and you can wrap it around your block so now he's going to jump up and down four times why because the repeat block says four let's see how that works let's start the game there he's just jumping four times what if i want to make him jump forever that's impossible how can you do that well there's a cool block in the end blocks you see these red ones there's actually a forever loop right there so let me show you how you this does i'm gonna undo all these blocks i'm gonna have them jump and then this block will make that repeat isn't that cool so let's just see what that looks like i'll throw this away there it is now we'll start it and now he jumps forever but how do you make the different scenes or backdrops change during a game well we're actually in the right menu do you see this block right here this is the scene changing block so how do we use it well let's go to the first scene in the game so scene 1 which is in the snow after our code blocks run we want to change the scene or more specifically when after the character the octopus moves away that's when we want to change the scene so we'll put the change scene block right there and so the only scene available is the the night one you can add up to four scenes to your game there this should work perfectly so to play this game when we want to show it to our friends we don't want to show them the code we want to show them the final game so up at the top next to the grid paper you see the full screen button you hand the game to them i think for me thank you so much let me play your game so you click the start flag to start everything and then in this game you have to press the cat please don't touch me and now it changes that's what i look like in the morning where's my breakfast anyways i really hope you enjoyed this bouncing pig tutorial go ask your parents to download scratch junior build something awesome i can't wait to see what you make
