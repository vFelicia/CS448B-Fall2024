hey scratchers today I'm gonna show you how to build a scrolling backdrop which you can use for games that go left to right or top to bottom however you want to build the game these are the basic skills you need to build a scrolling backdrop I'm starting with a blank scratch project I know who would have thought now we're gonna make a backdrop that Scrolls across the screen but backdrops can't move and let me prove that to you let's go and select our backdrop and you're gonna look for a backdrop that has a scroll ability factor meaning both sides of it can be connected together to create a really long scrolling effect so the knight City is the perfect backdrop now let me prove to you that you can't move a backdrop click on the stage so that the code is selected right here stage selected no motion blocks so what we'll do is we'll actually move the image from the backdrop costume onto a sprite so go to the backdrop menu take this and drop it right on top of scratch cat then when you click on scratch cat you'll see that that backdrop is actually there now we'll get rid of the scratch cat because all I want to focus on on this video is the backdrop which is now a sprite backdrops right back just right I know it's confusing ok so let's zoom out so I can see this now a little hidden secret is although it looks like this backdrop fills the whole screen it may or may not so I'm gonna convert it to vector then I'm going to select the whole thing and I'm gonna make sure by dragging it to the corner that oh look at that there's a little space down there and let's see if we can up how to make it a little wider ok once you have it maximized then you're ready to scroll because let's explain a couple things first of all how wide is an image a sprite is 480 pixels or you scratch units I don't know if they're pixels or units if it's 480 but wait a minute I thought it was 240 well 240 on one side then there's the zero and then 240 on the other side is 480 so we want that width to be exactly 480 so that when it Scrolls across the screen it will it will finish and then the next the next image will scroll you'll have to make something really clear this lesson is about backdrops but they're not actually backdrops so go in the backdrop stage menu and select blank we don't want to have a backdrop behind the sprites because this is really confusing we're gonna be making two sprites that look like backdrops that travel across the screen and the reason I'm moving my hands are because when the sprite reaches the edge it automatically moves to the beginning so it creates kind of this slideshow and because there's two of them you can actually trick your eyes into thinking that it's an endless scrolling backdrop so make sure that there is no backdrop behind your sprite and that here's your sprite you selected the sprite and we're gonna add some code the first thing you're going to do is make two variables how come we'll check this out make a variable we're gonna call it X position or X pause for a short and this is going to be the first backdrop so we'll call it X position 1 then make another one called Y position 1 there these are going to refer to the the X&Y position of this back I said backdrop it's actually a sprite but it looks like a backdrop yes so in the very beginning we're going to be setting both of these variables first let's set the x position then we'll set the Y position now we name these variables exposition and yposition but they actually don't have a value let's look in the motion block menu at the bottom there there are these reporter blocks that actually hold the xposition yposition of a sprite but they report back the actual position we're going to be creating our own positioning that's why we made our own variables instead of using these we want to actually set them to a position so X position is going to be 0 Y position is going to be 0 that puts it right in the middle so we'll go to motion and we'll use the go to block and instead of going to this X Y position we will use the variable X position and Y position now all we have to do is put a event block on the top to start the game and it will position the sprite right where we want it this sprite will start in the middle and then it will glide to the left like this the way we'll do that is by using a forever loop to make it constantly move so go in control menu grab a forever loop what we'll do is we'll change this value right here this variable X position so go to vet variables and grab change X position by negative 10 and then we want to Reese to put another goto in there so go to motion and we'll say go to and well actually just copy these variables right here there let's let's see if this works okay look do you see how the Y position stays at 0 because we didn't actually want to change it but perhaps you will in the future so I used that variable the X position is changing and look it's going really really negative right now so we want to say when the x position reaches a certain point to reposition the sprite we'll use an if statement to do that go into control grab the if block now we need an operator that's gonna be the less than operator because we're gonna say if the exposition goes less than negative 480 whoops there we go so that means negative 480 is as far as you can they take the whole sprite the whole backdrop sprite move it completely off the screen that would be negative 480 so we'll put that right in here so that it's inside the forever loop and if if it does go to negative 40 80 we're going to reset the exposition so we'll say set X position to not zero to 480 so that will basically shift it all the way back to the beginning what we should see now is a loop there is the loop we are looking for now we're gonna make the second backdrop by duplicating the first one so just right click on the sprite click duplicate now these are going to be exactly the same so if you click the green flag they should be right on top of each other the problem is still there that giant white space so we'll stop it well go into sprite two and we'll create new variables so click make a variable and we'll call it x position two we'll make another variable called Y position two and the number two represents sprite 2 then come into the code for sprite 2 and change these so they so that you have the correct variable so this would be Y position in X position we're not going to use this one anymore we're going to replace it with X position and then Y position 2 down here this one will be X position 2 this will be boy if you do this too quickly you're going to make a mistake so concentrate and this one is X position 2 and then finally it's going to be setting x position 2 if you did everything correctly it still should look exactly the same there should be a big gap because all we did is replace the variables with different named variables but they're doing exactly the same thing you'd actually monitor the numbers right here so how do we make it look like it's an endless screen we add 480 to the start position on one so that one is always 480 behind the other isn't that brilliant all you have to do is come up here where it says set X position you just set it to 480 to start there now it has a perfect lead oh there's a line in there if you find that there's a white line or the sprites just don't connect quite right you can kind of determine which sprite that has the problem by clicking on the sprite and seeing it glow you'll actually see that this white line is included on this sprite but not on this one so this is the one I need to work on I'll go into the costumes I'll make sure I'm in vector mode click on the selector and see if I can't drag this sprite a little bit wider you drag that right there there's a little bit it's a little bit off but pretty good you're gonna have to do some fine adjustment just to because the scratch editor you can't really see the full width on your screen okay we're almost done but there's one final really important code block you need to add to a scrolling backdrop and that's in the looks menu and that has to do with the layers you want to make the backdrop go to the backward layer so go backward 10 layers why 10 cuz you just want to get it way back there why because every time you add a sprite to your game it's like adding another layer and you want the backdrop to well it's not really a backdrop remember it's just a sprite so you want to make sure it's behind everything in your game so go backwards 10 layers works and the final step is to add your character so I'm gonna add the brown bear he has some nice costumes so he has this walking costume collection so I'll put that in a forever loop and there we go we have or scrolling background with a bear walking
