hello everyone today we're going to be adding sounds to our unity game here i have a main menu and i want to add a very simple sound i want to put a clicking sound on my button because right now when i play the game there's no sound you can't hear anything we want to make our game look polished even a sound as simple as a click helps so before we do anything unity we need to find a sound there are a lot of places to find sounds but there's actually one place that you might have used before if you're familiar with websites pixabay is a great place to find royalty free stock photos and also sound effects as it turns out so i'm going to search for a click sound and we got a lot of sounds here we've got mouse clicks we've also got more mouse clicks i only want one click though let's see if i can find here we go this is perfect okay this is exactly the sound i want so now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go over here and i'm gonna click download it downloads it over here it's always important to credit where you get your sounds from even if it's as simple as a click sound so here pixabay is making it really easy not really music but i would say click sound by this person from pixabay i would copy that and then i'd put it into a credits panel page something in my game so people can see where the sounds came from now that i have the sound downloaded let's get it into unity we can get this into our project a bunch of different ways the easiest way is to open up your file explorer go to downloads it's right there i'm going to drag it in to unity and there it is i'm going to go over to the button and add a component i want to add an audio source there it is and then i'm going to drag my click sound into the audio clip section here it's going to play as soon as the game starts so i'm going to uncheck that but now when i run the game we still don't hear the sound we actually have to write a script to tell the game when to use the sound so to do that all i'm going to do is go to the canvas i'm going to add a component i'm going to make a main menu script this is something you'll want to do anyways if you're making a menu this can be where we control what the button does as well but for now we're just going to be telling it to make a sound so in my main menu script i'm going to go ahead and make a variable at the top that is public audio source audio now i have a variable that will hold our audio source i can delete all these for now it is a public function that can be used outside of the script it has a void return type so it doesn't return any information and it's going to be called play button and the only thing this function is going to do is audio dot play there we go let's save this and set it up back in unity we have our main manuscript and it needs an audio source so i'm going to go to the button check to make sure i have our audio source here which we do i'm going to go back to the canvas and drag the button into this slot there now on the button we have to tell it to use the function that we just wrote so i'm going to go to the button section here and there's a box down here that says on click this is what controls what happens when you click the button i'm going to press the plus button here and then i'm going to drag the canvas into this box the canvas has our main menu script on it i'm going to go to the function menu and find main menu and then finder play button and now if i run the game i can click the button as much as i want these small details add so much to your projects all you need to do is import the sound add an audio source to one of your game objects and then trigger the sound effect somehow usually using a script let's see what you can build in unity
