all right today we're gonna take a look at what's called template strings or string template II what it allows us to do is pass in a variable into a string and replace it without doing any sort of crazy concatenation let's look at an example of it you so the first thing that we need to do is import a library so from string which is the string library we're going to import a specific set of functions called template then we're going to go ahead and create our template so I'm going to create a variable I'm just going to call it as and I set it equal to a template now when I pass in these parentheses is the actual string template that we're going to be using so I'm gonna say single quotes dollar sign who likes and then dollar sign what now those words that have the dollar sign right in front of them are the actual variables that we're going to replace in our string so now that we've created a string we can actually do our substitutions so we're gonna go ahead and so that we can see it we're gonna print but you can ignore the print statement if you're going to use this someplace else and we're gonna say grab that template that we made and we're gonna do a safe underscore substitute now a safe substitution allows us to actually print this stream out it actually prints it as a string it actually creates a string out of it instead of something that we would have to use manipulate and use later so safe substitute if you want to see it right away just substitute if you have other plans for it and then in the parenthesis we pass in the assignee so we're gonna grab that whoo variable and we're gonna sign it let's put my name in there sure why not and then a comma and the next one which is what and we're gonna set that one equal to soccer something like that so now when I hit run we can see that it prints out Stephen likes soccer because it substituted the word Stephen in for who with the dollar sign in front of it and the word soccer in front of the what with the dollar sign in front of it so that's substitution but when would you ever use this well if you're making an app that required you to be able to read it in other languages so let's say you write a Python program and you export it to a Windows Exe file well you could actually tie a Google Translate API into so that it would translate all of the text and replace it based on the country of origin in which it was downloaded in that's really cool so all of the the submit buttons and everything that you hard code into the app can actually be dynamically changed based on the language or may be based on some other factors I don't know you can get super creative with this even though it seems like it's a very very narrow use case but it's cool and it's something small and super quick that we could show you so I really want to see what you can do with this if you can actually get it to translate something put it in the comments I want to see that I want to see that so bad I'll be soaked with every mindblowing I don't even know if you could do could could you guys even do that I don't know give it a try go out there try it out and if you like this and you wanted to see more Python lessons head over to hacking INSCOM and sign up for a free trial we have tons of Python curriculum on there and you get help from me personally and the other awesome super highly educated and incredible teachers that we have it hacking is
