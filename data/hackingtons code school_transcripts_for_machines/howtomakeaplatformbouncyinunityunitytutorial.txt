so we still have that ridiculous friction applied but if we jump over we we hit that box and it sends us leading into the distance alright guys today we're gonna be making something sticky and something bouncy so we're gonna be messing with physics materials 2d let's jump into it and take a look see how these work and why you would use them alright so I have a game built here and it's very basic I have a player that gets moved at a constant force to the right I have a ground I have some enemies that I need to jump over also on the player movement script I have the jumping ability and I have this box right here that is an obstacle we can make this box bouncy so we're gonna do that by adding physics material 2d to these colliders so the collider is the intersection between two objects we can change how that intersection works by adding physics material 2d it's not a component it's a separate object so in my assets here I'm gonna go ahead and rightclick and create a physics material 2d it's in this dropdown I know it's off the screen you guys can't see it but we can grab it here and let's go ahead and make this one called sticky now if I take the player here and I add sticky to the material in there now the player itself is sticky so when I play this game we can see that it will probably not slow down hardly at all because I've set the friction to be 0.4 which is the default so we can see that's the the normal rate of speed that you can see now if we go into the physics material we can see we have friction and bounciness friction is the friction that it applies to an object there are the friction that it has bounciness is the bounciness of things that collide with it so we're gonna go ahead and change this friction to something like a hundred so that you can guys can really see what happens now when the player falls down and hits the ground we can see that it's going to slow it way down and even make it turn so that the friction is being applied or the friction is on the player and so it is sticky to the ground now let's make something bounce so I have this bounce object here I'm going to create a new physics material 2d I'm going to call this one bouncy and I'm going to edit the bounciness to be something like 50 belts eNOS is a big thing so just be cautious with your numbers but so now this big white box will have once we drag in the material we'll have a balanced eNOS to it so anything that collides with it will bounce off so if you're gonna make a trampolining platform or a or a ball in a game or something like that this is how you would do it now if you're gonna make the ball that's ballon see the ball wouldn't be bouncy everything that interacts with the ball would be bouncing alright let me show you what I mean so if we play the game here and we jump over those enemies once it loads come on Mac Mini you can do it so we still have that ridiculous friction applied but if we jump over we we hit that box and it sends us leading into the distance but that's how you add bounciness to a platform and friction to it objects physics materials 2d super cool
