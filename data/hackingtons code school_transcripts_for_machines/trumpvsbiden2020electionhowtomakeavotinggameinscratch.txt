tomorrow's the election and it's super exciting you want to make your own voting system in scratch it's super easy and i'll show you how who are you gonna vote for this is gonna be pretty cool okay i've grabbed this picture i know i'm not supposed to but come on this is so exciting then i put it as a backdrop in my game and i've added one sprite which is the check mark because it's gonna be vote for biden or vote for trump pretty cool so now this check mark is where i'm going to throw my code or put my code i'm not going to put any code on the stage the backdrop i'm putting it right on the check mark and i'm going to say if you're voting for trump put the check mark over trump i'm going to use the glide too because i like the animation so i'll say if you're voting for trump glide to this position if you're voting for biden let's watch this i'll drag it over here then you'll glide to that position here it is right here so this is a vote for biden this is a vote for trump how do i decide let's use an if else statement so go in the control and you're going to grab this if else there now we said this one's for biden and then the other one's for trump can't remember just click on them you'll see you click on this one it goes to trump if you click on this one it goes to biden so let's put it in like this and we'll go to sensing this is the secret to using the mouse positioning you have a code block called mouse x which holds the value of mouse x let me just show you a little secret here let's make a variable well we already have a variable called my variable and let's see what the value of mouse x is we'll say forever set my value to mouse x and we'll wrap that in a forever loop put a start flag on there now when we start the game you'll see okay wherever the mouse wherever the pointer goes that changes the mouse x well this is nice because right in the middle you'll see it is zero and then when it goes towards trump it goes positive when it goes away from trump it goes negative so we can say if we we can so we can say if mouse x is greater than zero we're voting for trump let's just check this whoops fire this code yep this works correctly so if mouse x is greater than zero move for trump otherwise go to biden now we'll want this to follow our mouse pointer so let's go ahead and wrap this in a forever loop because we want it to forever be following our mouse pointer and i'll put a starting flag on it and here we go pretty cool there's a little bit of a delay that one second so let's adjust that down to 0.25 we want it to be smooth but not clunky like that there we go oh i like that now when is the voting actually going to happen it's when you either click what if you're on the wrong candidate and you click and you're like oh no you really want to wait until the person stops clicking and then submit the vote let's move this code over and do something very similar now let's say when the game starts let's wait a second before anything happen just in case the person clicks like immediately and it votes for somebody that they don't want to vote for then let's use the wait until here it is we're going to wait until the mouse is down so go to sensing and you'll see mouse is down that way when we click it will vote but what if you're hovering on the wrong candidate you're like oh i meant to vote for trump but it already voted let's wait till the mouse is clicked down and then released this is a pretty cool trick we're going to duplicate this we're going to wait until the mouse gets down and then once it's down we're going to wait till it's not down right here grab the knot i know this is getting so confusing but it works beautifully okay wait till it's not down and then we're going to grab this mouse x block right here we're just going to duplicate it well i didn't need to pull it i just needed that and i'm going to say if watch this control we're going to grab that if else statement one more time we're going to say if mousex is greater than zero which means it's on the trump side that we're going to vote for trump so let's go ahead and make an event that says broadcast and wait and we're going to make a new message called vote trump there we go and obviously if it's not for trump this is the nice part about this code if the mouse isn't greater than zero then it must be less than and therefore it's going to biden vote biden okay boom so jump into variables over here and we're going to make a new variable so we're going to say trump votes and we're going to click on cloud variable if you don't have cloud variables it's because you haven't been using scratch for very long just keep using scratch and pretty soon you'll be a scratcher and have access to cloud variables okay i'm going to click ok and now we're going to make another variable called biden votes whoops caption dividend boats and we'll say okay let's go ahead and put these in the correct spot there we go trump votes and i'm going to move this down here we don't actually need that and biden votes there we go all right they're in the right spot so now broadcast biden vote okay they're in the right spots it's looking pretty good so what's gonna happen when you broadcast a biden vote let's go ahead and go to let's go to events and we'll say when i receive vo biden and when i receive vote trump that these things actions are going to happen so let's have it go to variables and let's have it change biden votes by one and change trump votes by one now now you can add a lot of other things that this function is going to do or this message is going to do but for right now i'm just going to stick to that now once the voting has happened we want to stop everything so they can't immediately vote again so let's go ahead and attach this stop all right here let's put a stop all here all right let's put as many stop alls as we can now there's much better systems for doing this because they could just hit the green flag again but for now it should work okay so um i'm selecting i'm gonna vote for biden okay can i vote for trump no pretty much froze up let's try it again and this time let's vote for trump it worked hey good luck building your own voting system and good luck to the candidates tomorrow don't forget to check out my scratch show on youtube i'll see you next time
