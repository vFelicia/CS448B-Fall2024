all right so my game has movement to the right and to the right only also I have to hit the arrow key and individual time every single time I want it to go to the right let's clean up this movement let's do some advanced movement so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to create four variables that keep track of whether or not a certain key has been pressed now you could do a dictionary you could do a list you could do a lot of different things but for the ease meanness of this and the fewer things that I have to teach you before you actually start typing code let's just do four variables so we'll call move left and we're set that equal to false this is going to be a boolean this is going to be a switch that is either turned on or off I'm going to do the same thing for a move right and you could probably guess what I'm going to do after this go ahead and get them all typed in here now that half my variable is created that are the switches that are going to keep track of whether or not a key has been pressed down now when I press the right key instead of actually doing the movement I'm just gonna turn a variable on I'm gonna say move right is now true okay let's do this for the rest of the keys all right so here is my new while loop so when I press a key down I turn these to true if it happens to be the correct key now I need to turn them back off when I let up on the key so what I'm going to do is going to copy this entire if statement and I'm going to put it down here it's gonna fix my indentation so that the F key downs line up so we can see if and if that all lines up I'm going to change this to an LF so that it registers correctly and then instead of doing key down I'm gonna say key up so when I let go of a certain key I will then set these movements back to false basically all we have done is said if you're pressing the key it's true if you're no longer pressing the key it's false all right so now that we have flipped these boolean x' now we can actually apply the movement based on the condition of the variables okay something all down here now this is gonna be a little hard to see here guys but I am making sure that I am no longer in the for loop I'm no longer getting an event now I'm just reading variable names so I no longer have to listen for events and now I can say if move underscore right now I'm not saying if move right equals equals true because move right itself holds the value of true or false so I can just say if move right then I can do player underscore X plus equals 10 I'm just going to move it to the right now if I run my game here I can now woah woah that was that was really that was really fast okay let's try that again so I hit it once oops let's click on again so if I hit it once I move 10 but ever hold it down I move all of the tens so tens way too much let's just do one let's try that let's run it again click it I move I hold it down I move cool it's not perfectly smooth obviously there's lots more optimization that can happen here but at least we have that working now I'm going to do the exact same thing for all the other movements so I'm going to copy this and I'm gonna go down here I'm going to paste it in and I'm gonna say if move left now I can subtract one because we're going in negatively we're going the other direction the X direction if you increase X and move right then you must decrease X to move left now I'm going to go through and then do this for all of the rest of the keys and make sure it works rerun my game and I can see the movement totally works and because of how we're using the boolean z' i can measure two key presses at the same time which allows me to move diagonally in my canvas here okay this is exciting we have advanced movement we've got an image on our screen now we just got to build an actual game if you've already built an actual game drop it in the comments if you thought this was a terrible way to do things and you have a better way tell me tell me in the comments I want to learn that's why I make these actually I make these to teach but you know learnings product part of teaching too all right build this have fun you guys will see in the next one
