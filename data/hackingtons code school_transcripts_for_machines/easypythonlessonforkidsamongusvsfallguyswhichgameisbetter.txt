fall guys versus among us what is the most popular game in the world right now let's find out right now right this second let's do it so i'm in replit i have my python project opened up here let's go ahead and let's find out from the user which one they like better so i'm going to create a variable called player underscore choice a variable is a container that holds some information that way we don't have to use the information directly we can use the variable in multiple different spots and every single time we use this variable we are referencing the actual data i use underscores in my variables but you can feel free to use what's called camel case where the first word starts with a lowercase letter and then every subsequent word has a capital letter so that you can read it but it is up to you i like underscores personally then we're going to set this equal to a value we're going to assign it a value that value is going to come from a function the function is called input this is a function that is built into python we didn't create this function python just has it for us to use every single time you use a function there are parentheses involved inside of those parentheses are what's called a parameter some functions have parameters some don't input has a parameter it's referencing a prompt a prompt is just the question you're going to ask somebody the input is looking for either a variable name that references a string or a string itself strings are wrapped in quotes you can use double or single now we're going to go ahead and ask the user do you like among us or fall guys more question mark and then personally i'm going to put a space just so that their answer doesn't run right up against that question mark now this player choice is going to store the actual input that the user types it's not storing the function it's storing a reference to what the user typed in so if i hit run here and i type in among us the player choice variable is storing is referencing the string among us so i'm going to do an if statement an if statement is a conditional it evaluates a statement and then does something based on what that evaluation came out to so we're gonna let the computer make a decision we're giving the computer way too much power but it's okay we're gonna get through this together so i've typed in the keyword if and then i'm gonna put some parentheses in python these parentheses are optional but i like using them because it helps me organize my thoughts and then i'm gonna put a colon that's the two dots a semicolon is a dot and a comma a colon is two dots we need those two dots let's go ahead and dive back into those parentheses and in here you can think of this like a parameter this is the conditional that we're testing and if statement only fires only executes if the conditional turns out to be true so player underscore choice we're going to compare the player's choice and if it is exactly two equal signs two equal signs is comparing if it's exactly equal to a specific string like among us and the string has to be identical so what the user typed in has to be this exactly capital a capital u all of that we're comparing what the user typed in to what we want the user to type in and then if that is true then whatever is tabbed in underneath that if statement is going to execute so we're going to go ahead and execute a print statement a print is another function and it takes a parameter we can just type in a string that says red sus all right this is one tab in from the left which means it's part of that if statement it will execute if that condition is true we're going to hit return to go to the next line and we're going to delete the tab we're going to go back to the left hand side and we're going to type in an else this evaluates if all of the other ifs that we put in there or or if else's that we put in there are false so if they didn't type in among us then else with the colon whatever is indented in underneath that else will execute something like print um i have 6 000 crowns we'll just like flex on them because we're assuming if they didn't enter in among us they entered in fall guys so we're going to flex on them and tell them how many crowns we got so we're going to hit run here if i enter in among us it prints out red sus awesome let's try it again let's type in fall guys i have 6 000 crowns now here's the little catch here if they type in something like cod and hit return then it's going to flex on them on crowns because we're only checking if they entered in among us and we're saying if they entered in anything else execute this print statement so maybe you can clean that up maybe you can get creative with it maybe do a little googling but that is the definitive way to test whether or not somebody likes among us or fall guys all right so we've built our program let's get credit for it in our address bar up here we're going to highlight the link that goes directly to our project now right click choose copy this is the link to our project with the code exposed if you want to link to your project without the code exposed we want this link right here let's go ahead and we're good with this we're happy with it let's right click and copy this link let's go back to hackins let's go to the showcase let's hit submit and then we can paste in our link we can give it a title among us verse fall guys mark it as python and then hit submit and it's on the showcase for everybody to check out that was your first python project congratulations you did an amazing job
