the difference between a good scratch game and a fantastic scratch game is the ghost effect huh what's the ghost effect well check this out in my game when I start the game the turtle is there why well because I'm showing them and you still need show and hide even if you're using the ghost effect it just has to do with the visibility of your character hence a ghost is seethrough so let's go and look in the looks menu look in the Luke's menu and find set color effect now ghost effect is a dropdown choice in the color menu right here ghost now if I set it at 100 and I click on this code block the sprite disappears if I set it at 0 it appears okay so ghost effects a little different because you get more ghosty by adding ghost effect now 100 is the most it means completely disappeared so we have to kind of work within that range so typically at the beginning of the game you either want something showing or not showing and in this case I don't want the turtle to be showing so I will set the ghost effect to 100 or basically 100 percent then gradually I want this bright to appear so what I'll do is go in the control menu and I'll use a repeat block that way I can fade him in by using the ghost effect now we're not gonna set the ghost effect again we're gonna change its go look back in the looks menu I like that look back in the looks menu here it is so change color effect will change ghost effect by well if we do negative 100 it will instantly be there so I want to change it gradually gradually so I'll do negative 10 why because 10 times 10 is a hundred pretty smart huh so let's see what this looks like start the game and there he is he kind of shaded in pretty quickly how can you slow down that fade in well instead of 10 times 10 do 10 times 1 don't forget to use that negative symbol because we want it to be Nega of 100 there it is a nice gradual faded now you can have a lot of fun and make your games look really professional using the ghost effect good luck you
