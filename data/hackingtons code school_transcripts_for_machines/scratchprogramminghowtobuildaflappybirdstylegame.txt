hey scratchers let's build flappy bird but don't call a flappy bird we might get sued let's say flappy bat cool we're cool with that so get rid of the scratch cat yes boom gone was there an explosion no now what we want to do is create a sprite and we're gonna be drawing that sprite that's gonna be those tubes that move across the screen which they're probably sued by Mario Brothers for or Nintendo okay and we're drawing the sprite grab the the square I don't know is it a square and we're gonna draw it it's a tube yeah is it dark enough probably like an outline would look good I don't know dark outline something there there's a tube let's draw the bottom of the tube now it doesn't look real fancy that's because you haven't shadowed it with a gradient or gradient with the I can't speak today go ahead and grab that bucket click on fill click on gradient then come over here and then you can adjust the gradient so it looks really cool oh but there's only one top tube why okay watch this copy copy and paste yes paste it and now you have two of them two of them that are exactly the same just flip it upside down I knew I'm doing a lot of stuff really quickly but I'm sure it's not that hard there's no room for that bird to get between there or bat or whatever it is so just go ahead and control how tall it is by changing that now it's pretty cool when you make multiple costumes so it's kind of one is hard one is easy whatever just rightclick on it duplicate it duplicate it and each one of these go ahead and just adjust it a little bit more like this one's gonna be all the way at the top there you go and then this one's gonna be weight this one's here this one's here and this one is there looks pretty good to me let's go ahead and add the code and the first piece of code is going to be an event like you'll always do with a green flag there goes when the game starts we want this sprite to go to well right here right in the far right corner so let's put that sprite there that will save us some time when we go to the motions menu because then it will all be set up for us look at the go to position is already there exactly where we want it to be and now all we need to do is have it glide to the other side but let's manually move it to the other side put it where we want it to finish we want it to finish right there so now this glide is already set up with the correct numbers push the green flag oh it's impossibly fast so let's slow it down to what three seconds that looks good ah looks like flappy bird now each time it goes past we want it to switch costumes so go ahead and go looks and then do next costume and then wrap it all up with a bow and a forever loop because we want this pattern to repeat here it goes oh you got harder that was a little awkward looking hey works pretty well okay so now let's add our little fluffy bat it's going to be a sprite right so let's click on sprite Mitch you want to draw your own I'm not very good at drawing bats there's a bat woof let's just search for bats and let's see what our options are there's a that's that's a batter okay so here's the flappy bat and he's probably the wrong size so come on down into size and let's go for let's go for six hundred percent that's not gonna work still a little bit big let's go with fifty percent now we need to add the flapping motion of the bat and first of all we need to talk about what exactly will the bat be doing he will be falling and then you'll press the spacebar and he will flap flapping and falling just like a real bat does so let's go ahead and we'll start with a start flag and say okay where does he start let's have him start right here that way he'll have a chance to fall okay so we use the goto and then we will go in the control menu and give will add some gravity to the game we'll say forever fall now the the Y position controls the up and down axis so if we say the Y is decreasing he'll go down and the Y increases he'll go up and I'll show you that right now inside the motion look for change here it is so if we change wife forever up he goes up if we change it forever negative ten he goes down let's see how fast that fall is that's a pretty fast fall I think for flappy bat my game it's gonna be a negative five fall that's pretty good point those tubes are really moving now to kind of counteract that gravity that's pulling him down I'm needing him to flap and flap hi he will so let's go ahead and add an event and let's say when the spacebar is pressed that he won't move up now I'll show you kind of the bad way and the good way to do this why am i showing you the bad way because it's easy watch this change Y by 10 this should just kind of counteract what I have right here not very well though because this is this forever loop is just fighting me it's too much to fight so let's go ahead and go inside of here and let's use a repeat block I love repeat blocks for jumping because it's gonna repeat ten times change by ten repeat blocks create a really smooth movement because instead of just doing the whole movement at once it's kind of repeat ten repeat ten repeat ten okay here we go let's see what it looks like now oh that looks a lot better we just it doesn't have the flappy motion we need the flappy motion so let's go look in the looks menu for the costumes and let's talk about what costume well what costumes do you have that you have you have a couple different ones oh I like that so I want it I want him when I press the spacebar to him to do bat a and then bat B that's pretty cool I like that okay so press the space bar switch costume to bat a and then after he let's see if this works to bat B let's check dot o it's reverse of what I wanted oh my goodness so let's say I want bat a and then there goes bat be there that's pretty nice I don't know why he's flying sideways but I love it now if he touches the the pipes which why are they there I don't know if he touches those pipes we want it to be kind of a game over situation so let's use a wait until block go into control and there is a wait until block so we're gonna say wait until touching those green blocks where pipes I keep saying blocks but they're pipes so let's go into sensing and touching now do I have to worry about what color let's just shrink the screen real quick what color these pipes are yes but actually they're a sprite they're called sprite one so I can actually sense those sprites here he goes so wait until touching sprite one and then and the game let's let's end the game the really super cheesy fast way because I'm trying to make this video fast let's just go into control and at the bottom just do stop all that's so cheesy I know so when are we going to actually use this code I don't like this type of code just sitting somewhere waiting to be discovered I want it to be at the top where I can see it easy and I'm gonna connect it to a starting flag there it is this game should work now let's play it alright everybody I'm oh is he we have a problem this tube is touching the bat and therefore it is not starting the game so let's go back to these tubes and make sure that they move to the starts to the starting position so let's move them all the way over here once again and go to motion and say go to this position when we start there no we can play this game ah it's so hard who made this get I'm gonna like rage quit right now yes yes
