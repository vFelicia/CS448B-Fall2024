let's add in the player and its movement script this usually if you're working in scratch or even if you're working in something like Unity would take you multiple days you're going to add in the Sprite you're going to add in all the animations you're going to add in all of the code you're going to check you're going to find out that you've typed capital A instead of lowercase a it's going to take you a long time but we can do it really quickly because construct has some behaviors built in automatically inside of the system here so we're going to in our layout I'm going to right click and choose insert new object this is going to insert a new game object now we choose what type of game objects we're going to insert well we're going to insert a Sprite so I can just start typing because I'm looking for a Sprite and it automatically searches for it then I'm just going to double click on the Sprite this is now on the cursor we've seen that the cursor has changed to this this plus sign the Sprite has not been added to the game now the game is asking us where would you like to add this Sprite I am going to add mine to kind of the middle section of my screen but you can put yours wherever you want once we click in the Sprite gets added to the scene and now we can get to add in the artwork so what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and rename this animation from animation one to say idle i d l e this is going to be the idle animation this is the animation of the player just kind of standing there and not doing anything now we're going to go ahead and add in our art so in the folder of RPG assets there's a lot going on in here we're going to walk through this stuff as we use it instead of just like dumping everything in here but there's a lot going on let's go ahead and go into actor actor are all of the things in your game like players like nonplayable characters NPCs all of the characters then we're going to go into the actual character section and we're going to choose our character I want to play as hmm who do I want to play as what about this red ninja no I don't like the look of that one how about red ninja 2 oh okay I like this one a lot more I'm gonna then go into the separate anim folder and this has all of the individual animations broken out and I'm going to grab this idle animation and just drag it into my scene here that that didn't work that that grabbed the entire thing that's not what I wanted okay so let's go ahead and delete that frame actually we'll just drag in a new set and instead of dragging it into the drawing box I'm going to drag it into the animation Cycles then I can import from Sprite Strip This has four horizontal cells and one vertical cell then if I look at the actual artwork I can see that the cells go horizontally four distinct shapes and vertically there's just a single row so that is good to go set up just the way we want it and we want to replace the entire animation because I want to delete that first animation frame okay then I'm going to go ahead and crop this down so that the hitbox is just where the artwork is now I have this animation here that has it facing forward then backward then left then right I actually just want that first cell the first frame here so I'm going to delete the other three by just clicking on them and hitting the delete key now I just have the idle animation facing forward and this for me is totally fine when I'm not moving the character is just gonna face back towards the camera back towards the player I'm totally fine with that and then I'm going to go ahead and close the Sprite editor there I'm going to go ahead and make sure I am logged in to make sure everything is saved that will pop up every once in a while if you haven't connected to the internet in a second and now I have my player right here on the screen it's hard to see we're going to fix that in some scripting but first let's go ahead and add a behavior to it we're going to add movement so add new behavior and I am looking for eight Direction movement this allows me to move up and down left and right and in all of the diagonals so I'm going to go ahead and double click on that to add that in and that is the only behavior that I'm going to add right now because I want to customize this Behavior I want these things to be slightly different than the defaults so this set angle I'm going to go ahead and change that to no I don't want it to rotate I want it to stay flat and just move if it rotates that might work for some games but for this game that we're building this top down game I don't want that we're going to set the max speed to 100 we're going to make it move a little bit slower than it was before the acceleration we're going to set it to 10 000 we're going to set it to as large of a number as it will take so that the acceleration is instantaneous and we're going to say the same thing for the deceleration we want the movement to feel Snappy it stops moving when we stop moving it starts moving when we start moving and there's no like slowing down or speeding up or anything like that default controls we're going to also uncheck this we're going to put in our own custom arrows we're not going to use the arrow keys because we're going to be using the mouse so our right hand is not going to be on the arrow keys our right hand is going to be on the mouse which means our left hand has to do the movement and our left hand naturally rests on was and d and that's where we want it we want it on wazda so that's what we're going to change our movement to in a second now I'm going to go ahead and double click on my Sprite here or so sorry just single click on my Sprite I'm going to rename it to player awesome now I'm going to double click on it to open up my game here or open up my Sprite Which looks great it's zoomed in now which is fine in my animations I'm going to right click and add animation I'm going to call this walking down this is the animation for the character walking down the screen now what I need to do is add in the actual Sprite sheet that we have for this animation so the individual animations I'm going to grab this walk animation and drag it in import from Sprite strip and this is a four by four animation because it is four by four individual images and then import we're going to replace the entire animation and we can kind of go through here and we can see that it's walking well this is the walking down animation so I only need the first four frames of this animation frame 0 1 2 and 3. so I'm going to delete all of the other frames so delete delete delete delete delete delete delete delete delete delete delete delete delete delete and delete okay so now we have this walking down animation I'm going to do the same thing for all of the other directions of movement walking up walking left and walking right and make sure you select the same the the four frames that match the direction of the name of the animation this walking down animation would make no sense if my player is facing to the right so go ahead and get all those animations added in and then we'll come back all right I have all of my animations in here of my idle animation my walking down my walking right my walking left and my walking up animation looking good now we can hit play and we see absolutely nothing first off we see a tiny dot of a character and we don't have any sort of um movement or anything in here I hit the arrows oh okay so I have the arrow keys does some movement which is awesome but it doesn't switch the animations we're too far away and the camera doesn't actually move with my player so let's change a few of those things first let's add a behavior that is the scroll to behavior this Scrolls the camera to the player awesome now we're going to start writing some events so I'm going to go to my event sheet here and we're going to add in some of the events that we need so let's go ahead and add an event now the first thing that we want to fix is that that camera is is pretty far away from the player now if your camera is fine and you like the look of it then you can skip this first event my screen is just huge if we actually go back and look at my my layout here it is 4K it is massive so I'm going to zoom in a little bit to get that fixed but if you have this 720p you might not need to add this first event so I'm going to add a system event and I'm specifically looking for the start of the layout so as soon as the game loads as soon as the game starts I want to set something so on start of layout now I'm going to go ahead and add an action it is a system action here and it is going to set the layout scale so layout oops layout and then we can scroll down to set layout angle no ah set layout scale I'm going to set it from one I'm going to change that to three and hit done if your screen is a different size than mine you can change this number if you like the way your game looks like if I hit play here now I can see my player I can see that I can move and the camera oh no I can't I can't move anymore oh that's right the default controls are turned off okay let's add in that movement so first things first we need to if we're not pressing anything we snap back to the idle animation so add event keyboard on any key released this says as soon as we're not holding a key as soon as we're not touching a key do something well we're going to go into the player and set its animation and then end these double quotes is the exact language that we use in the name of the animation so it's called idle all are spelled exactly the same way that you have it spelled in your player when you add it in the animations and then hit done so now if we release a key we stop moving the player steps back to that idle animation now let's go ahead and add in when we hit the W key when we're moving up the screen W is in that up Arrow position so we're going to add event keyboard when a key is down when a certain key is down we're going to go ahead and do the W key that's the key that we're looking for done and then what are we going to do well we're going to simulate some movement because we don't have to actually add a force or anything like that because we already have that eight Direction Behavior we already have all of that code written for us we just need to kind of replace the up arrow with the w key so we can go into the player and we can in this eight direction we can simulate control and what control are we simulating we're simulating the up Arrow pressed done and this will do the same thing the up Arrow would have done if we were still using the default controls which were not because we're pro Gamers here we use real controls we're also going to add another action to change the animation so I can just search for animation I'm going to go ahead and set the animation and I'm going to in between these double quotes spell it the exact same way I spelled it when I was setting up the animation and it is set said to be walking up for me I capitalize the W and the U but make sure your capitalization is the same that you had when you set up that animation and hit done awesome so we have this now so now if I play my game and I hold down W I go up you can't see that I'm moving because this is all just one gigantic gray box but I am see we are going up the screen awesome this is looking great now I just have to get all of the other movement working so I'm going to take the same command I'm going to copy it I'm going to paste it and I am just going to change some things about it one of those things is this W key is not the key that I'm looking for I am now going to go with the S key because I'm going down and then I'm no longer simulating pressing up I'm simulating pressing down and I am no longer walking up in my animation I am walking down done okay so now the S key makes me go down you're going to do the same thing for all of your your movement directions go ahead and get all that in and you should have working movement if you have any questions let us know we would be happy to help you out
