all right i have a very basic clicker here but i want it so that they can only buy this 2x upgrade if they have a certain amount of points i don't want them to buy it and then go negative so i'm actually going to make so make it so that this button can't be clicked until you hit a certain score so most of that's going to happen in the code so let's dive on in there so i have the script here it's very similar to what the cookie clicker script is so if you haven't already done that make sure you build that out but the very first thing that i need to do is if i'm going to turn the button on and off i need to have a reference to that button i need to go grab that button so i'm going to grab i'm going to create a public variable you can make this private and then grab it in your start function but let's go ahead and just make it public for ease of use and it's going to be of type button because we're grabbing a ui button and let's call this buy to buy to x button okay cool so now that we have a reference to it in our code we need to go ahead and slot in the actual button that we want to hold there so in our editor my script is sitting on my canvas here so back in the editor my script is actually sitting on my canvas so i have my canvas selected and then down here i can see that by 2x button empty slot let's go ahead and slide our by 2x button right in there so now we actually have the button in our code save that head back to our script so now what i want to do is i need to keep track of what the score is at and then disable or enable the button based on the score so our update function runs continuously so this can track values really really easily so i'm going to go ahead and put in an if statement and then i'm going to in my conditional in the parameter that says whether or not this is true i'm going to say score is greater than or equal to 10. this says if the score is 10 or is higher than 10 do this stuff so between those curly brackets i'm going to do the stuff well what i'm going to do is i'm going to actually take that by 2x button dot enabled i'm going to set it to true and this says if the score is greater than 10 make it so that i can click on that button and then we'll go through and we'll just fire an else in here so that if the score happens to fall down below let's say you took away some score when they bought the upgrade huh there's an idea then we're going to go ahead and that buy 2x button dot enabled will then get switched back to false which means you can no longer click it if your score is below 10. now once you've bought this upgrade it's kind of permanent you're you're never going to get it lower than 2x upgrade now but this is good practice for coding now the other thing that we need to do is if you've paid attention here you will see that we never turned the button off when the game started so it's enabled until we say it's disabled so when the game starts we need to disable that button so we're going to do that by 2x button dot enabled i'm going to set that equal to false as soon as the game starts then enable it so if you want a button to be off by default make sure you put this enabled false in your start or your awake method let's go ahead and save that let's come back to the editor let's hit play here i can't click this button so you can see there's no impressions happening i clicked it a bunch of times and i still just go up by one still can't i'm at two still just goes up by one but if i get above 10 i can then click that it upgrades it and now i count by twos so that's how to disable and enable a button based on a value of a variable hopefully that was helpful if not i don't know what to tell you i don't watch march watch mark rover on youtube i don't i don't know
