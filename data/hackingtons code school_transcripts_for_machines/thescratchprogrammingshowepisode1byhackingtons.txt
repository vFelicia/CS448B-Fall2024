what's up scratchers I'm Matt from hacking tents I'm gonna be showing off some of our student projects so check this out first up it's Mikhail's game where you're like a cat would have guessed it a cat a scratch cat and you're being chased by this oddly go get get the key get the key go go go go to the door yes okay this is one of the coolest adventure games I've seen okay we've got Ryan m3 with the scratch cat arcade let's go ahead and make it fullscreen and let's check it out now I don't get into gambling at all so I'm gonna go for the 1 to 9 odds totally cool with whether I win or lose come on Christian be one from Vacaville submitted this game guitar destroyer and I'll tell you this I am cool with destroying guitars I'm a guitar player so I know on the stage you got to smash them so let's get to Smashing okay my hands going up this isn't smashing this is beautiful I want to smash them Zack are made this next game and it says this is really hard okay well let's play it and let's see if it really is that hard it looks like the best score is 3.2 I have no idea what it is using the arrow keys oh yeah oh wow I'm pretty good at it but yeah it's too hard and for our final game where I'm gonna help you make it a little bit better it's Daniella D who made this flying dragon flappy bird I'm pressing the spacebar I'm flapping it was game over why let me show you a common little error is in the costume tab for the pipes you can see how they're changing what happened was is the changed before it had moved to the other side of the screen so simple fix go in the code for the pipes click right here it says next costume put that above it so it changes the costume on the far right rather than on the far left pretty easy simple fix right there next the dragon isn't really flapping is he the dragon is just kind of staying still so let's make them flap actually in the real flappy bird flappybird doesn't flap either but let me show you you get three costumes for the dragon but none of them are really animations so let's just choose one I'm gonna choose this one I'm going to delete the other two then I'm going to right click and duplicate this dragon 20 with two of them are three of them I'm just gonna do two of them now dragon B it's in vector mode right now so when I click on it it will actually like show all these points on it and I can move or move it around as a whole there we go but what I want to do is actually just rotate it a little bit so I can create that flapping motion I'll click the other wing I'll rotate it kind of back like that like here actually let's keep rotating it and I'm gonna send it to back send it backwards so let's click on this go backwards did it work there now I have kind of a flappy animation I don't like the best I don't know so let's go and into the code and when we press the spacebar it's repeating doing this and let's have it change the the flap the flap it's in the looks I know it's in the looks it's in the costume so switch costume when you press the space bar switch costume to be and then when it's done flapping switch costume to a well there's no a and B it's just B and B to let's see how this looks did I improve it I don't know thanks so far on the left side let's go ahead and fix the the starting position right here let's make it start at negative 100 see how that looks I don't know the flapping motion it looks kind of circular let's get let's try to fix that I hate to not improve something it's this swing right there that just doesn't look right now it's flat flat flapping ah let's see I wonder I want to rotate it down there we go how about rotate it like this there flap flap flap your wing anyways I really like the project I will see you next time on the scratch showcase
