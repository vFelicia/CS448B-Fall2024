and we'll give it a go and we'll watch the glory happen in all of the resolution that we can render on a Mac Mini let's do this all right so we're going to preview the level and it switches now you just have to do all of the physics to get it to move all right so let's build a super simple like level preview cutscene camera animation thing before our game starts so I have a game here it's just cube slide or qubit or and then whatever you want to call your game but it's basically just a cube that slides across a platform that you have to avoid obstacles in so what I want to do is I want to have a camera kind of take a topdown view and slide across the level before the game starts so you can preview where their obstacles are at and kind of preview what chaos you're going to go through before you actually start the game so the first thing that I'm going to do is go ahead and create a new camera so I'm going to create a camera here and I'm going to call this preview camp and this is going to be the camera that previews the scene now right now we can see the camera preview down here in the right hand corner that's not exactly the angle that we want it to take so let's move it I'm just gonna rotate around here I'm going to raise this up and I'm going to rotate it to face down kind of like that kind of like a bird's eye view that's gonna slide through so how we're going to actually move the camera it's not by physically adding a force to it what we're going to do is we're going to actually create an animation that animates the camera across the scene so I have my animation panel open here if you don't see this you can go to window animation and see this panel I'm gonna go ahead and create a new animation I'm gonna call this level preview I'm just gonna save it directly in my assets alright so I've created my new animation here I'm just gonna hit record and now it's going to record everything that I do for this camera so it's going to have a position here I'm gonna drag this playhead all the way through to let's do one second we can only slow this animation down but for after one second what we're gonna do is then take and move this camera all the way to the end of the level so I'm just going to move it in the zdirection all the way down to the end of the level I can see my camera preview down there in the right hand corner and I'm just going to continue to move this all the way until I get to the end of the level which looks like it ends about there all right now I can take the playhead bring it back to the beginning and stop recording now if I play my animation through we can see that it cycles through the level it takes I mean it's way too fast I mean that's there's no preview there you're just like zipping across the level there's no useful information in that so let's go ahead and slow it down so what I can do all right so I'm just going to go ahead and scroll out on my animation until I see that fivesecond mark and we're gonna take those keyframes and move them to five seconds we want this animation to take about five seconds and now if I play through it we slowly see the level and it's actually useful information all right so now that we have this animation created we can select it in our assets panel here and we're gonna do a few things here so what we want to do is open debug mode all right so I'm going to click way up in the top right hand corner it's very hard to see and I'm gonna go into debug mode which allows me to make it a legacy clip and change the wrap mode to once that way this animation just plays through once alright so now that I have that I'm gonna go ahead and save my scene and I am going to create a new game objects create an empty game object and I'm just gonna call this camera switcher and what this is gonna do is do nothing but have a script on it that switches between the cameras and then activates our motion so I'm gonna create a new C sharp script down here create C start script and I call this cam preview and open it up in monodevelop or you can it open it up in Visual Studio or whichever IDE you prefer to do your coding in alright so now in our camera preview we need to actually grab that camera so we're gonna do a public variable you can do this in the awake function if you're feeling feisty but for me I'm just gonna slide it into a box just for the tutorial so a game object and we're go ahead and call this cam one that's going to be our main camera and then public game object cam to this that's going to be the preview camera actually let's give these better names let's call this main cam and let's call this one preview cam that way we know exactly what they do so let's go ahead and in our start function we're gonna do what's called a KO routine a ko routine is a set sequence of functions or something like that that runs outside of the game clock so it doesn't stop your game from running for five seconds but we can put a weight on a different function for let's say five seconds so we're going to start a KO routine and let's just go with call this function preview not cam preview you want just preview it's going to not be an actual function yet because we need to create it we don't need this update function any longer and now we're going to do it I in numerator called preview now that should change from red to black or blue all right so now what we're going to do is we're going to wait a certain time and then switch camera so let's do a yield return new wait four seconds and how long are we going to wait let's go ahead and wait that five seconds that we know that animation takes to play after we wait those five seconds we're going to go ahead and set the preview cam or sorry set the main cam to be active and then set the preview cam to not be active we always want to set one camera active we before we turn off the other camera that way we don't get a frame of black in between the switch so this should you know once once we start the game it starts this preview we wait five seconds and then we activate the main camera and then turn off that other camera and if we had other cameras that we wanted to switch to we could do that there what we could do right down here is also turn on the physics for our game so reactivate the main camera or the players movement script all of that but let's just see if this works it's going to go ahead and hit compile no errors that looks great let's go ahead and switch back to unity here and now on my camera switcher game object here I'm going to go ahead and throw on that oops that cam previews script I'm going to go into my preview cam and remove the animator we don't want an animator we want an animation and then we need the animation clip which is that level preview the animations that we are that we have cool it already clicked it in there that looks great let's see if this works so I'm going to go ahead and hit play here we preview the scene wait for it wait for it it's going to wait five seconds it's probably too long we probably could have made a three or two or something like that it didn't switch why didn't it switch tell me in the comments why did it switch well because in our script we never clicked in the actual things that it's switching between let's put our cameras in there ISO preview cam goes in preview cam and main camera goes in main cam we'll save that and we'll give it a go and we'll watch the glory happen in all of the resolution that we can render on a Mac Mini let's do this alright so we're going to preview the level and it switches now you just have to do all of the physics to get it to move but that is a super simple camera preview cutscene thing in unity
