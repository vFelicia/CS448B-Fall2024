all right so today we're gonna be taking a look at a distance joint 2d which is something that you would use to make a pendulum so think of a clock the pendulum that swings to keep track of the seconds think of a Chain Chomp from Mario think of a bicycle with the two wheels that's actually a pendulum that's between those two but it's set to be fixed anything like that you're going to use a distance joint to D to make so in my game here I have a couple of things set up already so we can hit play and I just have a player that follows my mouse and then an enemy that if I collide with it it sends me back to start basically just refreshes the scene this stuff you guys can build on your own you don't have to watch me do it it's part of the color bump tutorial if you're enrolled in hacking Tain's alright so we're going to take our enemy here and we're gonna add a distance joint 2d component to it so I just add component I type in distance joint and I choose 2d now this will default to connecting it to the closest game object but what we can do is that circle we can actually move it and this is the top part of the pendulum so you think of this is the thing this is the pole that the chain is tied to and this is the top of the clock that's gonna pendulum the whatever the thing at the bottom is called maybe it's just called a pendulum and now if I hit play we can see that because gravity acts on it and the pendulum is offset it will swing back and forth once we see that it works we'll take a look at the settings and play with it a little bit oh I need gravity reactivated for that so go back into my enemy and we will turn back on dynamic so that gravity will act on my enemy which will pull it down and a distance 2d how its configured right now it will keep the distance from the point to the object the same it will always be equal so it's like a like a rod instead of a string where it can only go in one direction now if we go back and we take a look at a distance joint 2d we have this enabled collision checkbox we can check that and then it will actually collide with whatever game object that it's glued to we have the connected rigidbody so if I wanted this to be let's say connect it to the player at all times I could take the player drag it into this box and now that pendulum is connected to the player and just for good measure we move that over and we can see we can see that when I move the enemy moves with me so it's kind of like you could do you could use that to create some sort of force field you could do that to create a spinning like if you were creating a car game and you had this weapon that swung around to injure other other cars you could do that if we set it to none then it's just wherever this anchor point is we also have an actual numbering like X and y coordinate for that anchor if you wanted to hardcode it or pass in variables that allowed it to move we also have the auto configure distance if we do that then we can ignore this distance here where wherever this is that distance number will adjust we can do max distance only so that it can go closer to the anchor point but not further away and then brake force we have it set to infinity so that no matter how much force is applied to this object that distance joint will never break but if you want it to be like a tether ball where if you hard enough and broke and flew into the distance you could do change this break force to a smaller number and then eventually that thing would break and it would fly off so that's distance joint 2d build something really cool with this add it to your color bump add it to I don't know you guys are way more creative than I am add it to something cool and I want to shout out Maurice W from the Roseville location for showing me this really cool all right any questions guys
