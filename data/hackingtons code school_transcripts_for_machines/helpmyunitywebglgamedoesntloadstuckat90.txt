all right let's check out this cool new game what what what's going on what is happening everybody have you ever been stuck at 90 and you just think that if you give it a little bit longer it might actually load well it's never going to load i hate to burst your bubble if you're a developer and your game is doing this to somebody then there's a way to fix it so let me go ahead and take a moment to show you how once you're inside your unity project go ahead up to your build settings make certain you've selected webgl and hit player settings inside the player settings it'll actually give you some options that you can change right here but what we're interested in is the webgl output and publishing settings the compression format right now it's set to compression format broadly let's change that to disabled and that seems to fix everything so if you exit out of this go ahead and build your project and once it's finished it should work this time sweet we're in
