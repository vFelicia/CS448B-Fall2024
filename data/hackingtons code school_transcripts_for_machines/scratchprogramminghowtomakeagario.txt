one of my classes showed me this game agar.io I think it's agario I like to click on the options and say no names uh there we go so I'm this little dot in the middle and I gather these other little blobs I guess there maybe amibas and as I get them I grow and depending on where my mouse pointer is that is the direction I go and if I'm further away I go faster if I'm closer I go slower let's build in scratch first I need to get some graph paper to use as the background so I'm just going to Google for graph paper look for images uh any of these will really do let's just use this one nice and big let's right click on it save image as and I'll save it in my desktop I'll call it graph paper now I've opened up a new scratch project and I'm going to delete the cat and I'm going to make a new Sprite by uploading that graph paper here it is and I'll open that it's not the best looking Sprite but it will do now the way you make the background really large is a special little trick I learned first go to the costumes for that Sprite and make a new one that's blank and put that one before yours so you're going to switch to costume one make the screen really big and then switch to costume 2 I know that sounds a little bit crazy but let me show you how I do it and I will zoom in real quick so when the game starts switch to that backdrop or it's not a backdrop it's just a costume switch costume to costume one then do a motion go to 0 0 that will put it right in the middle then here's the crazy part you want to change the size of it the looks go here and do set size to let's say 800% then go and switch the costume to the costume you really want which is graph paper for some reason this combination makes the backdrop really big watch there we go it is very large now now in this game there's going to be a ball I'll go ahead and draw that ball and it's going to be in the center let's make mine green it's going to be in the Center so I need to make sure that the Sprite center is right there perfect and then I will drag it to the center but it's never actually going to move we're going to make the graph paper move pointer so go to the graph paper then we're going to do another when the game starts or when the flag is clicked and I'm going to do a forever Loop and what the forever Loop's going to do is say change the X position by wherever the mouse pointer is the way we're going to do that is go to motion and we're going to say change X by 10 well that's not going to work Watch What Happens it's going to go real fast we don't want that we want to go change X by the position of the mouse pointer so let's go grab the X position of the mouse pointer that's located in the sensing menu under Mouse X but what this is going to do is going to make it go too quickly cuz right now the mouse X is like 170 so this thing is going to be lightning fast so to slow something down you multiply it by a really small number so go to to operators grab the multiplication and let's times this by 0.1 that's about the smallest number I could think of there so Mouse x times 01 let's move to this to the side now it's going really slow I can only go side to side so I need to copy this with change y as well let's do change y by the same thing duplicate it but instead of mouse X we want to use Mouse Y which is right here there now it's going to follow my mouse actually it's going in the wrong direction so we have to think opposite the mouse is going this way we want the backdrop to go the opposite direction so we change this to .01 and this to be01 now we have a game that somewhat looks like aario there we go and the further away the mouse is the further the faster it moves next we're going to make those little amibas that the big agario is going to eat to grow larger and we're going to actually need to steal this piece of code because otherwise the little amibas are not going to move at the same speed as the background so I'm going to make a new Sprite I'm going to paint it it's not going to be real interesting I'm just going to make a purple a little blob that I'm going to eat and I'm going to fill it in make sure the center of that Sprite is right on the center there we go now I'm going to give it some code and I'm going to say when the game starts forever make a clone of itself that's going to make too many clones so I'll have to slow it down a little bit let's put a weight in there the top of the control menu let's say wait 3 seconds before we make a clone then when it starts as a clone because remember clones only listen to the when they start as a clone directions we're going to say go to a random position and I'm going to have to go to the motion go to XY and we'll use the random number generator to to put a random position the furthest left is 240 the furthest possible Right is 240 and for the Y AIS is actually 180 is the furthest down and 180 is as high as you can go there we go let's see if this works every 3 seconds we should see one pop up there it is you notice how it not moving we need it to move exact ly the way the background is so I'm going to go steal the the forever change X and I'm going to drag it to Sprite two and let go there that copied that code over so that I can put it right here now it's going to do the same thing as the background so it's going to appear not to be moving I know you're thinking well what about this one that one's a little bit different right there we go see the Clones the Clones are moving with the background okay so what do we do with this one right here this is the one that's actually making the Clones it's only listening to this code right here so what I like to do is go to looks and hide it and then make sure that I show when I start as a clone that will make the little mommy or daddy right there go away perfect now they'll pop up every 3 seconds there it is now I just have to give it some code so I can eat it so I'm going to be eating these purple clones right here so let me shrink it up and when I eat them I'm actually just going to be deleting those clones so I want to go to the control and grab delete this clone I'll also want to grab an if statement and the if statement is going to say if I touch the big agario Sprite Which I can probably just click on right here and rename AAR agario there and I'm GNA rename this one food there we go and make sure when it says create clone of myself it's creating clone of food and stop and here we go go to sensing and I'm going to say when I when these clones touch the main one the agario that I'm going to delete this clone we go ahead and put this inside a forever Loop there we go now they will disappear when I eat them let's see there's one and it's gone last thing I'm going to do to these little food clones is I'm going to change their color so they're not all the same so I'll grab this change color effect I'll put it in the main code right here and I'll get rid of this wait 3 seconds so we can see if the code is actually working here we go see they're all different colors now I'll put the wait 3 seconds back into this forever Loop so that it's not overwhelming me and let's get to eating the food so let's go back to the big agario ball that doesn't actually have any code because the background's moving and we're just going to give him some very simple code we're going to say that when the game starts we're going to set his size to 100% that way he won't get big and then the next time you start he's still the same size actually I can just set it at 50% so when the game starts he's quite a bit smaller perfect then I'll set up an if statement that says whenever he touches one of the food Sprites he gets bigger that's really simple just use an if sensing touching food that I'm going to grow it's in the looks menu let's change size by well let's change size by one for the real game but for my example here so I can see it let's say change size by 10 there we go now let's wait the 3 seconds and we'll see a piece of food pop up let's eat it and he will get bigger I don't see him actually changing size do you so we have a pretty big problem with this code I'm sensing to see if my agario is touching the food and I'll change the size by 10 the problem is as soon as I touch him he's deleted right here if touching agario then delete this clone so I need to make sure there's enough time that the scratch software notices that I've touched them so I'm going to have to go in here and put a real really small wait here we go before I delete him I'm going to wait 01 seconds you won't even notice it but it's enough time that this code will fire so let's wait 3 seconds and there is the food let's eat the food and he grows let's eat that one and he grows and he grows and when I stopped the game and start it over he's small again all right well that's the basic game I'm going ahead and eat some food right now I can't wait to see what everybody makes with their own version of agario on scratch whoa
