I have a variable called score when the game starts it sets the score 20 when I press the spacebar it changes by one watch the score I want to make a high score so we'll make a new variable called high score I don't want to set high score to anything at the beginning I want it to be set to the score but only if the score gets higher than the high score so how do I do that the first thing I'm going to do is get an if statement because I'm going to be checking to see if the high score is less than the score and I'm going to wrap that in a forever loop because I want to always be checking there I'll need an operator to check we'll use the greater than operator will say this data if score is greater than high score set high score to score watch this you'll see them both be at zero because high score has never been used before but when I start clicking you'll notice that high score is going up with the score that's because it's the first time but now when I restart the game score is zero but high score remains at 13 and it will stay there until I get a score that is greater than the high score there now it is
