don't combine movement with animation you want to make two scripts for that so here's my one script that's for the movement the spinning script and if I put animation like next costume and of course the weight point three seconds to animate it it ruins the movement you want to separate those so I'll take the animation right here I'll grab a forever Loop and I'll grab its own starting event right there and now you'll see it's animating and moving and there's no jerkiness
