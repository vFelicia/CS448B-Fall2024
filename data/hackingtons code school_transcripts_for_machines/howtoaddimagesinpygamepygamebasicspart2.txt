and we've got an image on her screen all right so in our PI game here we have a blue square that moves to the right when I press the key in my PI game window now we don't have the rest of the movement working quite yet but I'm really excited to add an image into my game so let's do that right now so I want to put an image in place of this square because as much as I love games about squares it's not exactly what I want so I'm gonna go to Google Images here and I'm just going to search for ball and then I'm going to choose images and then what I'm gonna do is I'm on DuckDuckGo but on google you would choose color and transparent I'm gonna change that type to transparent and then I will also add in PNG at the end of it so that I know it's a PNG file format so I can click on this gold ball here it looks pretty good I want to double check it and make sure the background on the image is a checkerboard pattern this means that the background is transparent if it's not transparent then when we add it into our game you'll still have a square it'll just be a ball inside of the square we wanted to actually be round so we're going to choose this image right here I'm going to right click and save the image as not open a new tab or save link as I want save image as and then I can just call it a gold ball and I'm just gonna save it in downloads you can save it anywhere you want as long as you can find it because when I come back to my game here I can then drag it into repla now I have this gold ball PNG image that's part of my project so now that it's part of my project I want to actually use it I want to load it into my game so I'm going to go down here underneath screen but you can kind of do this wherever you'd like and I'm gonna do a ball IMG new variable and it's gonna store that loaded image so I'm gonna say PI game dot image dot load I'm gonna load in an image it takes one parameter what image I need to type in the exact name of the file so I'm gonna say gold underscore ball dot PNG don't forget the file type that dot PNG is important and now if I run my game and nothing nothing happens there's a gold ball over here why why why didn't it show up well I've loaded it but I never actually drew it so I'm gonna go down here in my while loop and I'm just going to comment out the drawing of the rectangle I'm not going to delete it because I might need it in a second or two here I might also need to reference some of the variables that are in there some of the values that are in there and then I'm gonna say screen dot B lit that's right be lit screen and then I'm going to use the name of the variable that has the image loaded in it and then I'm going to pass in the position that we want it to render it well because I have a variable that's already keeping track of the exposition I'm going to enter that in as the exposition and then for the Y position well let's just create a variable for the Y position so I'm going to do player Y and then I'm going to create that variable up here just so that if we change it like maybe I kind of what we're doing here uh now it will draw on the screen it's gonna go and stop I'm going to hit run and we've got an image on our screen alright so if you chose an image that's actually small enough to fit on the canvas you would be done right here you would have the image on the screen and it would be working great and we can see that it does move to the right when I hit the right arrow key because we're still using that variable and all of that but that's how you add an image on to your screen
