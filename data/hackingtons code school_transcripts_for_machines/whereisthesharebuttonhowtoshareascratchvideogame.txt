if you're building a scratch game and you don't see the share button at the top then you're in trouble because you can't share your project why not because your email address has not been approved maybe you didn't check your email maybe you didn't get an email well there's an easy fix just go into your account information by clicking on your username in the top right and click account settings then select email now you can either change the email or request a new confirmation code once you get that you check your email and approve the account then you'll be able to share your project and so what does it mean when you share a project well it means that your project is now available for viewing in the public that doesn't mean everybody suddenly gets an email saying hey play their game no you need to copy the link see at the bottom here kind of look down it says copy link there you go this is the link that you're going to share with your grandma with your best friend with your enemies enemies anyways anybody who has that link can open up your project and play it you
