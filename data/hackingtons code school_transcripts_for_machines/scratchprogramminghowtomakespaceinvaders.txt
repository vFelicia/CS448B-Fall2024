we're gonna be building space invaders well our kind of simple version of it because even though this video game was built in 1978 can you believe that it was phenomenal and watch watch this game it's so addicting you're the character it I died instantly come on I'm a master the shoe keys guys ah and those invaders are attacking you really have to protect your planet so are we gonna build this exactly No can you build it exactly perhaps let's see so what is our space invaders gonna look like it's gonna look like this well I use space tacos awesome check this out space invaders was one of my favourite games as a child and building it is a lot of fun because we can practice cloning what are we gonna clone everything we're gonna clone the missiles that shoot and the space invaders that are attacking lots and lots of cloning because there's lots and lots of sprites in this game so let's go ahead and start off by building our blaster cannon I don't know what the official name for it it is but I'm gonna draw it by using the paint and then you can't see right here I'm gonna choose this square selector and I'll point this out you see that little dot right in the middle that's not a smudge on the screen that's not a booger that is actually the center of the sprite so that's where the missiles are gonna come out of the blaster cannon so we need to be very careful to make that the top of our cannon so I'm gonna draw that and then under the next layer what am i drawing I don't know I'm just trying to recreate what I remember what space invaders the blaster cannon looks like and what's really fun is you can take this and you can select the whole thing and then you can change the gradient on it oh let's see is there anything cool that looks cool I like that I'm gonna go with that then I'm going to drag it down to the bottom where it's going to be and then I'm gonna change the backdrop because it's looks so boring and I know that this is gonna be space invaders so it needs to be in space space City these all look kind of distracting I'm just gonna go with straight up stars that looks pretty cool now let's go be careful we're in the backdrop right now so if we try to add code we'd actually be coding the backdrop and I know that because when I click on this code it says motion the stage is selected there's no motion backdrop mode no motion blocks so to fix that I'll go click on sprite 1 and now I have those motion blocks and the first motion block I want is this one that makes it kind of go to where I want it to start of course I need an event like a win the green flag is clicked so that it will go to that position at the beginning of the game isn't that nice now we need to give it that leftright movement can we do that yes we can okay do we want to do with the clunky way where it's like when the right arrow is clicked then move 10 steps to the right now I do not want that kind of movement in fact I want this game to be mobile friendly I want it to follow the mouse pointer Zechs so let's go in the motion and let's see if we can grab the oh we can only grab the exposition of this sprite I want to grab the x position of the mouse pointer that's actually in the sensing menu there it is mouse X beautiful this holds the value of wherever your mouse is so this value can change as the game is played well how do we use it we use it by going to motion and we find set X there we go so we're going to set the this sprites X to the same thing as the mouse X now this will actually not work and let not work correctly unless you constantly are changing it constantly changing constantly checking how do you constantly do anything well you wrap it in a forever loop watch this it's beautiful now it will follow my mouse pointer and it will also follow my finger on a tablet which is really nice for mobile friendly games so we have the game ready to play we just need to be able to so I want it so when I click the mouse pointer they goes beep you and it shoots a little missile thing okay so let's stop this game real quick and let's do let's start the next video on adding the missile so we have our cool blaster cannon when I click the green flag it follows the mouse well actually forever sets the exposition of this sprite to the mouse exposition so it will actually follow your finger which is really nice fun of me follow me ok so we are going to be adding the blaster cannon and we will paint a new sprite for this and just like when I drew the the the blaster the missiles let's see here we can do a round circle that seems a good idea we want to make it right in the center see this little dot right here will want the missiles to be right on that dot this is actually quite difficult oh my goodness if you make a mistake just click this back in time and I'm going to change the color of my missile to something more deadly something more vicious bright red that sounds good and there it is there it's right in the center this is the best I could and I'm going to go ahead and coat it now we're not gonna be coating the blaster cannon to shoot we're going to be coating well putting our code on the actual missile or the bullet or whatever you want to call it isn't that it kind of looks like a button nose we're shooting Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer balls that is weird so make sure we've clicked on the sprite that we're gonna be coding click on code and we'll say when the game starts the event we will make it hide why cuz I don't want to see it just right there I want it hidden so here we go hide it now anytime you use hide you're gonna want to use a show and vice versa so when are we going to show it when we press the spacebar we're not gonna use a spacebar in this game we're using the mouse clicker all right good so we don't have the event so here's the deal I'm going to teach you how to use the spacebar and then I'll teach you how to use the mouse clicker for the shooting the bullet the missile event so we'll want to go to events and we'll say when the spacebar is pressed to show and then we'll want it to go to sprite one all these sprite ones this and that let's call this sprite let's call it missile and this called sprite one let's call it blaster cannon there you can name it anything you want it's just much easier to deal with okay and then we need to Ford to go to here it is go to not random position we want it to go to the blaster cannon let's see if that works press the spacebar it goes there oh it's the button nose into eyes meet that's a Christmas song and then after it goes there then we wanted to shoot all the way to the top so this is the fun part go to blaster cannon and then move where is the move it's gonna be going up so we're gonna be changing the y value change Y and we wanted to change the Y value until it hits the top so let's go to control right repeat until because we want to repeat until touching the top whoops I have to take this apart this is getting difficult I want the change Y to be inside the repeat until and now we need to put a condition in here that's going to be true or false okay so let's go to sensing they have this touching edge I think that will be our best idea so let's put this touching mouse pointer in here that has a drop down and it says touching edge I know they hide a lot of stuff in here right there till touching edge so this should work let's see I know it wasn't that simple boom boom pretty cool and you can adjust the speed by changing this number right here now when it hits hits the edge or touches the edge we want it to disappear so let's just go make it hide looks we'll need that hide right here so we'll put it at the bottom there boom works pretty well doesn't it I like this but you can't rapid fire that's a big problem welcome to cloning cloning allows you to duplicate sprites and the code associated with them rapidly like a rapid fire so this is kind of clunky instead of just shooting one let's have it clone go into control at the very bottom it says when I start as a clown and create clone of myself and delete this clone now I need a little more space for my coding so I'm gonna shrink the screen here and I'm gonna show you how all of these clone code blocks work you need all three of them if you use one you have to use all three so first of all when are you going to create a clone of yourself whenever the space bar is pressed so we just put that right here now the other big rule about clones is clones or clones only listen to clone code that sounded confusing basically this right here the clones don't listen to the start flag they only listen to when I start as a clone okay so if you don't have this when I start as a clone the clones will just stand there be like we're not listening to you so we'll attach this piece of code to that umm and then instead of hiding the clone at the end we'll need to delete them otherwise they will all pile up even though you don't see them they'll be at the top of the screen eventually you'll have so many clones that the computer will start to run out of memory and break down so we we make sure we delete the clones at some point now I think we have the proper code I'm gonna scroll this down so we can see how it looks and I'll make it fullscreen so you can see what it looks like now when look at that oh it froze why because we kinda I kind of spammed it when you spam click it tends to use up all the memory and freeze the computer so one little trick I've learned is to add oh wow it just unfroze if that happens to you let me show you how to fix that go ahead and add this wait one second right there and then that should allow you to shoot without having the computer freeze just a little hack I learned it's a lot of fun isn't it good luck adding your cloning blaster Kennan now I promised that I would show you how to make it work with the mouse down click that mouse click that Mouse ok so right now we're clicking the spacebar let's leave that one there just in case they want to use the spacebar but we need to let's shrink this up right here we need to have that mouse down event there isn't a mouse down event go ahead look in the events you'll never find one see this spacebar you can get all the keys on the keyboard that you want but you can't get the mouse down mouse down is actually in the sensing menu right here and mouse down is exactly the same as touching the screen on a tablet so it's really useful I wish scratch would have just put it as an event you have to create your own event so go into control and say if if Mouse down something will happen well we want it to do this we want to create clone of myself right there and we'll need to wrap this in a forever loop there we go and we'll need to say when the games actually look at this this code right here we can actually attach it it's not doing anything other than just hiding so we can say if mouse down create clone of myself oh there's one second between them ok so obviously we didn't need this little hack right here let's see if it works don't throw at all the big moment of truth it works it works really well oh it's freezing up a little bit I wonder if we put the weight zero seconds right here if that would work you'll have to kind of fiddle with that wow this is so cool I'm having a lot of fun with this let me just show you the code right here in the final screenshot so you can get an idea for what I built there it is beautiful Space Invaders falling from the sky where let's blast them but we haven't actually added any invaders yet to our game so let's do that right now go ahead and add a new sprite and you can choose anything you want yes even tacos that's my thing not yours do your own thing so taht actually is just under taco so I'm gonna add my taco I'm gonna immediately do something that's terrible make a tacos smaller never make a taco smaller okay so that taco is gonna start at the top and it's gonna fall to the bottom attacking me okay so let's let's go ahead and add that code let's say in the events we want to go to the top so we'll grab the motion and we'll say go to here we go that let's see in the middle so the exposition will be 0 right in the middle and the y position will be 180 which is the very very top and of course you remember that the very bottom is negative 180 don't you you remember that so I'll try that watch this he'll put it right at the bottom cool so basically we wanted to go from 180 down to negative 180 did you follow that that was pretty confusing so what we'll use is the repeat until because the repeat until is like a forever loop it goes forever but until a condition is met once this condition is met whatever it is it will stop the loop so let's have that condition be whenever the taco reaches a point that is lower than negative 180 so less than so that's a lot of words how did you get so smart mister Matt well I went to school let's use the less than so we're gonna go less than negative 180 and that's in the operators menu and what is gonna be less than 180 the Y position this is a little tricky go in the motion blocks make sure you have the taco selected or whatever your bad guy is scroll to the bottom and you'll see something that says the Y position this actually if you check the box you can see that it holds the value of the Y position of your sprite and it will change depending on where the sprite is so it's a perfect it's kind of like a variable to use for this conditional this conditional will fit right in here and now it's going to check it's going to repeat this loop until the Y position is less than 180 which means the taco is below the bottom of the screen now what is it going to do its we want the taco to be falling so we're going to be changing the Y let's see that's gonna be in motion we're going to change Y where is change Y change Y by law as fast as you want it to fall if we do negative five it will fall fairly quickly there now it's gonna fall till it hits the bottom and then it will stop so we need to wrap this entire piece of code in a forever loop there we go now it will do that sequence over and over again easypeasy we can beat this game just by staying right here so we need the the taco to actually start in a random position on the x axis the X being the left and right okay so we'll go and grab that random number maker in the operators and we'll replace this go to X position with negative 240 which is the farthest to the left you can go to positive 240 which is the farthest you can go to the right and that should let's just hit the start flag that should start it at a random location now I don't need this to be showing anymore so how do we get rid of it go back into oh that's in the motion section scroll to the bottom and then check that it's just kind of you can you can use these to verify where your sprites are it's a pretty handy really advanced technique okay it looks like it is falling in a random position that's great but it's just one at a time I thought you said we were gonna clone these yes we are let's get to cloning now our games pretty simple right now there's just one bad guy that falls in a random location and I promised you that I would show you how to clone the bad guy so there's a whole bunch of bad guys you can shoot at so let's do that first of all go in the control menu that's where your cloning code is at the very bottom there are three important elements three you when I start as a clone create clone and delete this clone you have to use all three of them every time you're dealing with clones okay so here is the code that makes the taco fall what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna disconnect this forever loop and I'm gonna use this starting flag to create a clone of myself then I'm gonna use the when I start as a clone to give directions to these clones that I'm making and I won't need the forever loop because each time a clone falls from the sky and hits the bottom it's going to delete itself and you'll see a new one up here up here so I'm gonna go ahead and put this delete this clone at the very bottom here there I think I've used everything when the game starts create a clone of myself when I start as a clone then I will do this code and once I've completed the code I delete myself so let's see if it does at one time perfect now if you want this whole sequence to repeat put the forever loop around create a clone of myself but be careful hold on to your computer watch this it's raining tacos yes the reason why it's doing that is it's creating clones as fast as it possibly can and computers are actually running forever loops very very quickly as you've noticed right here so I'll need to slow this down with my favorite piece of code in actually it's in the control menu the wait block right here depending on how many clones you want you'll need to slow down this create clones there you go now they're falling from the sky but there is a big problem this one what why is this one this taco just sitting right there well when you create clones they'll always be one sprite that isn't a clone it's kind of like the mommy or daddy clone it's like okay children go ahead and listen to the clone code but I'm not a clone so what I typically do with this one is I hide it just go in the looks menu and grab that hide and show those are kind of partners as well you always use a hide and a show together so I'll say when the game starts hide that one and then when the clones are created go ahead and show them I'm gonna I'm gonna zoom in a little bit so you can see that but now it will work perfectly in the next video I'll show you how to shoot these because right now they're not going to react to the bullets and there's also not a game over screen there's all sorts of stuff we need to add I'll see you the next one our video game is starting to look really cool but you can't shoot the bad guys and those tacos are really attacking your planet or whatever they're invading from space so let's add some code that says that when the missile touches the tacos that taco deletes itself and you get a point so where do we want to put this code on the missile probably not we'll want to put it on the actual invader that's invading because we want it to delete itself when the missile touches it so this is going to be another when I start as a clone event so we'll need to go into the control menu down at the bottom and say when I start as a clone you can have more than one events when I start as a clone that's okay when I start as a clone I'm going to pretty much wait until the missile touches me now the missile can only touch you one time so we'll use a wait until rather than an ifstatement because remember if you use an if block you'll have to wrap it in a forever loop that's kind of a mess for something that's only going to happen one time the wait until is a beautiful thing so we're gonna wait until it's touching the missile so we'll go to sensing wait until touching missile and when that happens we'll want the score to go up and we'll want the the taco to delete itself so two things let's go make a variable that's going to be the score the points I'm gonna say score there we go and now we have access to what we want to increase the score so we'll change the score by one I'm gonna zoom the sin so you can see when I start as a clone wait until touching missile change the score by one and then delete this clone so that's in the control menu you'll see at the bottom delete this clone there let's see if that works can I shoot it boom yes I can now how do you how does the game end well anytime a taco touches the the blaster cannon that's the signal for game over let's go ahead and add that code to the blaster cannon why well I feel that there's a lot of code in the taco and I really want the blaster cannon to have the ability to say hey game over game started game whatever so let's add it to the blaster cannon let's say this if it touches well if it touches any of the tacos then it dies well then we can use a wait until there we go wait until touching taco and then game over this is kind of an interesting idea I'm waiting till a taco touches the blaster Kanon does it matter which taco because there's like a million clones it doesn't actually matter this touching taco will work for any of the clones because right now I'm using I'm coding for the blaster cannon wait until touching taco and then it's going to be game over let's actually let's send it since this is a blue belt pretty advanced lesson let's use messaging so right here will broadcast the message game over new message game over there and then after I brought broadcast the message game over let's go and have him blow up what blow up that's awesome how do you do that it's a little trick I'll show you go into the costumes and go ahead and duplicate it a couple times there we go now these are going to be the explosions all you have to do is grab these circles and then you're gonna like paint them the color red or gray or whatever and just draw circles on top like this and now draw a couple more that are grey this isn't very great that's very gray there you go bum bum okay then I'm gonna paint this one too even be worse bum bum bum I love creating explosions okay then this one is gonna be like that so now it just looks like that doesn't that look like an explosion okay here you are normal and then boom you're gone so let's go back to the code say wait until touching taco we're gonna broadcast game over and then we're gonna do this cool switch of costumes so go into the looks and we'll say Oh where's this switch costume right here switch costume to cost um not costume one we'll go costume to duplicate it costume three there and then put a little bit of time in between them using the control whoops they're using that control wait so we'll use like a point three seconds in between them the only thing you have to remember is you'll need to to costume one when the game starts so we're kind of there we go when the game starts costume one if it touches that then it goes into this explosion mode and after it switches to that final one you'll want it to actually hide boy I'm getting really complex but it's gonna look really cool in the end here we go so we'll we'll switch it to that costume we'll have it wait point three more seconds before it actually hides point three there it is and we'll need it to show at the very beginning of the game so since we use the hide now we need to use the show boy that's a lot of code right there just to create that cool ending here it is touch boom and it's over that's pretty cool now the final thing is we need a game over like the words game over so let's paint a new sprite well I'm not going to use a backdrop because I still want the stars in the backdrop ooh I'm not gonna choose a sprite I'm going to paint a sprite here it is and I'll just say the words game over and I'll want them to be in the life something that's really visible on here so I'll probably want like white there it is oops I didn't make it quite big enough so I'll use the selector there there we go there put it right in the middle that looks really nice now the code is very simple for this it's just when the game starts hit hide itself hide there we go hide and then of course I need the show as well and when are we gonna show it when we receive that special event that we made called game over when I receive game over show here we go there it is let's just shoot one just to make sure it works and then let's let one hit us and it's game over and we blew up when we restart the game it works it's really cool I like it a lot
