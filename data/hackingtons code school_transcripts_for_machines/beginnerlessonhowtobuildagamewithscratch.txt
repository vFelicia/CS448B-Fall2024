hey I'm Matt and I'm going to be teaching you how to build a butterfly clicker game yes just like the famous cookie clicker game you click on butterflies to earn points let's get started we are building a brand new game so you need to find the create button at the top of the scratch home page this is the page you'll see when you start building a new game first you'll notice they give you a cat Sprite what's a Sprite it's the same thing as a character or an image in your video game now I don't need a cat Sprite in this game so I'm gonna delete that Sprite you can't delete the Sprite on the stage you have to come down to the Sprite menu and click the trash can button there now to add a new Sprite I'll hover over the cat head and I'll click it to choose a sprite from the library feel free to choose whichever Sprite you'd like but I'm going to choose a butterfly now to start your game in scratch you'll click the green flag at the top but you'll notice nothing happens you'll need to provide detailed instructions to all of the Sprites in your game we don't call them instructions we call that programming and we program it by adding code blocks to the code area let's practice adding some coding blocks to our game so we can just drag and drop and click them together and if we don't want them we can just disconnect them and throw them back in the pile let's throw them all back let's Dive Right In and code our butterfly clicker game the first block we need is an event block called when the green flag is clicked so here we go we'll drag that in now we want the butterfly to go to the center of the page that way when they finish playing wherever the butterfly is it will snap to the center so that's a motion block now there isn't a goto center block talk but there is a go to X Y block and we can replace the x value with zero and the Y value with zero and that will be exactly in the center now let's test it yep it worked now that we have a starting script well you notice I use that word script anytime you have an event encoding blocks grouped together we call that a script let's add another event this one will say when the Sprite is clicked we'll have it go to a random position in the motion blocks there is a go to random position block so when I start the game now when I click the Sprite it goes to a random position now this is where you can get a little bit creative because you can go into the looks menu and you can actually have it change costumes what do I mean well if you go in the costumes tab you'll notice that this butterfly has different costumes I'll go back to the code Tab and you'll also notice that I can change size I can change color there are all sorts of different coding blocks that I can add to make my game more interesting and of course I can add a sound so I can say play Sound Pop what if I don't want it to pop can I choose different sounds yes I can record my own sound or I can go into the sounds Tab and add additional sounds available for this Sprite now you might have noticed I've added a bug to my code what's a bug well it's an unexpected Behavior see when my butterfly gets bigger every time I click on it that's great but when I restart the game The Butterfly is still huge I'll need to reset the butterfly's size in this starting script right here so I'll go to looks and I'll say set size to 100 percent now this code will always run when the game starts so when I click the green flag now the butterfly is small again now so far this game is absolutely pointless did you get that one pointless so let's add some points now points are a value that can change in the game anything that can change is called a variable so click on the variables selector and click make a variable now you can actually name it anything you'd like but I'm going to call my variable points once you've clicked OK you'll notice that the value points or the variable points is now available when you click on it you'll see its value which it starts at zero you'll also see the value over here where it says points now I can make the points increase by changing them right here where it says change my variable I'll say when the Sprite is clicked change and there's a drop down points by one now when I click on my butterfly the points will increase in value by one our game is no longer pointless but it still doesn't have a goal games need to have a goal or a reason for playing them in our game we want the player to click the butterflies as many times as possible we can do this by adding an alert that offers encouragement like congratulations you've clicked the butterfly five times let's do that by adding another Sprite but this time we will paint the Sprite because we want to write text see the text tool right here we can write the words like congratulations or great job let's say Five Points I can select it and make it larger I can change the color there then I can position it on the game where I want it to show up now that I'm done drawing that Sprite I can switch out of the costumes tab into the code blocks Tab and you'll notice there's no code what happened to the code I wrote well that code is still there it's just in the butterflies coding area this Sprite the great job Sprite doesn't have any coding blocks so just like before I'll add an event that says when the game starts and the first thing I'll do is I'll say hide why because I don't want to see great job Five Points at the beginning so when I start the game it's gone now in order to show it I'll need the show block no duh okay so when do I want to show this Sprite well I want to wait until the points equal five okay so let's look for those coding blocks I said wait until that's in the control menu I'll scroll down until I see okay wait until that's kind of like a stop sign it's going to wait until something happens before it shows so wait until points so I'll go in variables and I'll grab the value for points now I can't put the value points in there I actually need to go and grab the operators because I said points equal something so points equal 5 then I'll put that inside of the wait until block there now once the wait a minute the points are already above five so this code won't work okay so hold on that's a bug I'll need to fix it so I'll need to go into variables and at the top of this code block I'll say set points to zero what that will do is reset the points at the beginning of the game now when I reach 5 Points that message will show up now do I want the message to stay there because now I'm already at 10. no I want it to disappear when well maybe after two seconds that sounds good we can do that in the control blocks as well we have a weight block let's say wait two seconds and then go back to looks and then hide all right that's a long script isn't it go ahead and try that and see if it works in your game now we have this message that alerts the player after five points but we want to add another alert that triggers at 10 points or 20 points and that's easy to do all we have to do is duplicate this Sprite but before we do that let's name the Sprite because right now it's known as Sprite one and that might get confusing so I'm going to call this one alert 5 because it's going to alert after five points now that it's named I can right click on the Sprite and click duplicate this time I'm going to name it alert 10 and I'm going to go into the costumes for that Sprite and I'm going to change everything I need to change in order for it to be a 10 point message instead of the Five Point message and I'm going to change the color as well so it's a little bit different there now we have two different messages but they have the same exact code because when you duplicate a Sprite it also duplicates the code so I'll just go into the code and I'll change it so I'll wait until points equal 10 and then it will show itself so let's see if the game works now when it gets to five it should show great job Five Points and then when it gets to 10 great job 10 points and we can continue duplicating and changing the code to encourage the player now that we have our basic game working we need to look for ways to improve the game well immediately I'm looking at this game and it's just a boring white backdrop so let's go to the stage menu and let's click this drop down to choose a backdrop I'm going to say this game takes place in the Arctic that's kind of funny I don't know about you but when I play a game and I don't hear sound effects and background music I think boring so let's add some sounds the butterfly does it plays The Sound Pop the alert 5 doesn't have a sound effect so let's go in the sound menu and let's say start sound now where do we want it to play right after they received Five Points then we play the sound pop that's the same thing the butterfly makes so let's either record something or let's go to the sound Tab and let's choose a sound in this case we want an effect sound I'm going to scroll down to where the win is alright that sounds cool so I select win now I'll go back into the code and I'll use the drop down to select when now just because I chose the wind sound for this Sprite doesn't mean it's available on the next Sprite see it's missing from this one so I'll need to do the exact same thing right here and now you should have a working game with sound effects congratulations you've finished the basic butterfly clicker now it's up to you to make improvements to make it more original more unique to your personality maybe you'll be sillier maybe be funnier scarier I don't know try it on your friends your family your teacher get ideas and make this game spectacular I can't wait to play your clicker game
