what is happening everybody i am christian with the game division here at hackington's code school for kids and i am super excited to talk to you about something that i wish existed when i was a kid it's called unity and let me tell you why i love it for me as a game designer i love coming up with new ideas for games and mechanics and systems and testing them out i have books full of these ideas and with unity i can open this up flip to a page and start trying some of them putting them into the game engine and seeing what happens so i'm stoked that we offer this at hackington's because when we learn unity together we get to see what we can come up with and create ourselves unity is a fully featured game engine what that means is if someone were to say hey pop the hood of your game let me see what's underneath they would get a good look at the unity engine see game engines have changed a lot since when i first remember them in fact the very first game engine i ever played around with was on a single floppy disk and it was called zzzt and i remember explicitly because i didn't ever have a pc up to that point so this idea of like typing commands was completely foreign long story short what was great about it for me as a designer was that it allowed for me for once to actually play around with the game mechanics inside a game rather than have to create my own game from the ground up oh fun fact this same company that made zzt went on to make fortnite you may be wondering how is unity any different than say scratch or roblox unity lets you make your games your way in your style and to release on hardware of your choosing think of unity as a way for you to take your game idea and to actually realize it and put it somewhere where you want it to it is the software that professionals are using today to make their games if you want to be a game designer there is nothing preventing you from creating whatever play style you imagine from fastpaced action games to turnbased strategies or storybased roleplaying games now if you're an artist whose visual style has never been seen in games before you can showcase it with unity it supports everything you want to do in 2d or 3d art styles it has advanced features for creating amazing lighting and shader details so if you're up for the challenge and you think that making games is as fun as i do then i invite you to come try unity with us and see what we can do together
