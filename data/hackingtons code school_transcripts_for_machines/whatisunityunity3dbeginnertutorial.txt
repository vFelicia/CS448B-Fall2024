welcome to unity unity is a professional level video game engine it's used to make games like rust which is a massively multiplayer game with thousands of people on the servers at any given time and in such an expansive world that you might not see the same player twice other games like Assassin's Creed unity were built using the Unity engine the same engine you're going to be learning today now Assassin's Creed unity took hundreds of developers thousands of hours with hundreds of thousands of assets but it also made millions of dollars using the Unity engine games like super hot run on the oculus rift and other VR systems that's right unity can be used to build VR games it can also be used to build iPhone games android games ps4 games Xbox one games you name the platform and unity probably supports it now the Nintendo switch that's a different ballgame Nintendo has always been weird but what is a video game engine and why did we pick unity as the one we're going to use well a video game engine is a platform to build your game on say you want to build a game like Call of Duty there are a ton of things going on in that game now you can code all of those from scratch and it might take you 10 to 15 years to make a single map with a single player that shoots a single object we don't have to do that we can use unity and its builtin functionality to build a game on top of it we just have to tell unity what to do we don't have to build the things it does but why did we choose unity there are other video game engines out there engines like Unreal Engine and game maker studio and technically even scratch well unity is a good middleoftheroad it's not so difficult that it's hard to understand and hard to learn to use like Unreal Engine but of course Unreal Engine because it's so sophisticated it can do a ton of stuff I don't think we're really going to get into hundreds of thousands of particles moving on the screen might be a little bit too complex but once you know unity making the transition to something like unreal or frostbite isn't very difficult we also don't want to use something as simple as scratch or game maker studio or roblox studio because it's going to hamstring us it's gonna hold us back it's not going to let us do everything we want to do unity allows a perfect balance between sophistication and ease of use let's stop talking abstractly about unity it's time to actually take a look at it now the very first time you open up unity it's okay to be intimidating there is a lot going on on the screen but we'll walk you through each piece will tell you what each piece does and once you start building a couple of games with it you quickly settle into a rhythm and unity isn't so bad so let's actually open up and take a look at what this amazing video game engine actually looks like
