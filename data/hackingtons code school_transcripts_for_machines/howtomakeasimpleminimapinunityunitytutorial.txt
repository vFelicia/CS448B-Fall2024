so we can go to our game and we can see right here in the corner we can see our game all right let's make a minimap now we're gonna make it in the simplest way possible and then we're gonna fancy it up towards the end so I have a game here created it's called azam tie with what we call it hacking ins but it's basically just the Unity thirdperson isometric shooter or orthographic sure there's kind of like a topdown thirdperson shooter the little kid a little toy doll that runs around and shoots other toy dolls on the ground but basically we're gonna make a mini map so the first thing that I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and create my mini map camera basically all a mini map is is just a camera that looks straight down on your level and then displays that out in the UI so I'm gonna go to my main camera here and I'm going to right click and create a new camera I'm also going to rename this camera too let's go mini cam now I'm going to change the perspective of this camera so it's more of a topdown now these numbers are going to work for me but they might not work exactly for your game your game might have a different starting point for the camera but you want to make sure your camera is looking straight down on your level so for me I'm going to change the rotation by 60 and then I'm going to change the Y to 36.7 and I'm going to change the Z to 7.4 that's just personally for this exact game those are the numbers I'm using yours are going to be different just position your camera so it looks straight down on your level even me I could configure this but I want to make it so that it's at least similar to the perspective that the player has now what we need to do is display this camera out to the UI the first thing that we're gonna do to do that is create what's called a render texture so in my assets panel here I'm going to right click create and choose render texture I'm going to call this mini texture but you can call it whatever you would like now this render texture has a bunch of settings over here we're not going to mess with any of them except for maybe this size if you wanted your texture to be a little bit more zoomed in or whatnot you can change this size up here but for us we're gonna leave it just like that now this mini cam a target texture right here and this takes in a render texture well we just created one of those so we're gonna drag that in and that what that does is it takes the display of the camera and renders it out to a texture well what takes a texture a raw image so in my UI here I have this HUD canvas thing I'm gonna go rightclick UI and choose raw image this takes a image file of any type and then I'm gonna go ahead and zoom out here so I can see where I'm positioning that I'm gonna position mine in the lower right hand corner of my UI so if I switch to 2d mode I can see that it's down here on the right and I'm also just going to anchor that to the lower right hand side so as my window changes it always stays there alright so this raw image takes the texture what texture do you think we're gonna put in there that's right this mini render texture now our camera is actually displayed right there in the corner so we can go to our game and we can see right here in the corner we can see our game so if I hit play here we can see a tiny little dot over there that is our player running around the scene
