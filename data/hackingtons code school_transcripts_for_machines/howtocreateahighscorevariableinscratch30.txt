if you build games on scratch then most likely you have points or a score system and if you want players to keep coming back to your game then you need to have a high score variable well how do you do that well you need to have access to cloud variables scratch only lets you create cloud variables if you are a scratcher how do you become a scratcher well you need to have at least two projects and you need to love and comment and favorite a couple other projects and have been using scratch for at least two weeks now let's look at this super basic game that i've created that has a score variable and the score increases when i press the space bar there so i'm at 10 clicks right now so my score is 10. well let's go ahead and create a cloud variable for the high score so click make a variable and this will be a cloud variable and we'll call it high score click ok now remember scratch only remembers numbers in cloud variables you can't do letters or any type of symbols at the beginning of the game we don't want to set the high score to zero because that will erase the old high score so what you want to do is say when the game starts set the high score to whatever value is sitting on the server and that's held right here and you can see the cloud symbol on it so we'll set high score to high score right now the high score doesn't have a value it's just zero because that's what all scratch values are when you start and we'll check now from now on we'll check to see if our score is higher than the high score so we'll need to go in operators and we'll get the greater than operator then we'll go back into variables and we'll say if my score is higher than the high score then we will set the high score to guess what my score was that confusing or what but it kind of makes sense right my score is greater than high score so set high score to my score i could say that a million times it'd be so fun okay so we need to put this inside of an if statement we'll say if if my score is greater than high score set high score to my score and then we need to put this anywhere well it will run and check and in this case we want it to check every time i press the spacebar okay so let's try it now oh wait a minute why is the high score going up because nobody's ever set the high score and in this case i'm setting the high score so now watch this i'm going to refresh the game my score is zero but the high score is still there and it won't actually change until i reach that amount again so that's how high scores work add high scores to your game or if you're not a scratcher hurry up and make some games i can't wait to see what you build
