why does my game lag what is my frame rate how fast does scratch run why is my game so laggy first off we need to figure out how fast scratch actually runs what do you mean well depending on your computer and how powerful and new and fancy it is it might run faster than another person's computer so i'm going to test that by setting up a tick rate meter first you need to understand that scratch has a block called timer and it's kind of like a premade variable it just keeps track of the time since the game started from when you clicked the green flag and you don't actually have to use the reset timer because the timer will always reset when you click the green flag this is a great way to use to see how many processes or ticks the computer is actually doing in one second so i'll set it up so that there's a variable called tick rate and i'll set it to zero then forever as long as the timer is less than one and that's one second we'll increase the tick rate by one so we'll see how fast the computer will will increase that tick rate in less than a second here we go i've clicked the green flag and even though the timer keeps going the tick rate stops and this time it stopped at 101 296 that's how many times it increased this variable wow that's pretty fast can you believe that now i'm running it again and it's a little bit different why because the computer cpu is always doing something and who knows what it's doing in the background right now maybe it's playing a youtube video and i didn't realize i left it on so it's going to be interesting for all of you out there in the world so you could try out my tick rate meter and see how fast your computer is does this mean my computer is running a hundred thousand frames per second no typically your browser is running either 30 frames per second or 60 frames now i know when you're running gaming computers sometimes you have 120 frames per second but that's not on a web browser like we are right now on chrome so i went ahead and followed a tutorial on youtube on how to check your frame rates on scratch and it came up with this and it when i run it it says that i'm getting around 125 frames per second well how is that possible it's probably not very accurate because nothing else is happening in this game watch what happens when i actually add some code to the cat something simple like a forever loop that makes him spin there when i add this and i press the start flag suddenly the frame rates drop to 30 and my tick rate is 30 as well what just happened i lost 900 000 ticks per second no okay this is what's happening the scratch team actually made the decision to slow down coding blocks like the turn or the move blocks in order to allow your eyes to actually see the action what do you mean well if this cat was spinning a hundred thousand times per second that would be a big problem you wouldn't be able to see it your game would feel awful so why did they choose 30 frames per second i'm guessing that that's the standard by which most computers can handle it now i don't know all the answers about why your game lags and some of you who build these incredible games with hundreds of forever loops are experiencing lag lag lag perhaps you can refactor your code and use things like custom blocks where you can make a block and allow it to run without a screen refresh so tell me in the comments have you ever experienced lag in your games go ahead and post those games and don't forget to hit subscribe and like the video
