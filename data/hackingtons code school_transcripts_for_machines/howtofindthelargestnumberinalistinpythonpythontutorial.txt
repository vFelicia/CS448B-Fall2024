okay so see if you guys can figure this out so I'm going to lay the challenge in front of you as well the the challenges don't use Google but I have a list of numbers here how would I find the largest value that is in this list how would you do that you all right so this was a challenge that I placed in front of my Python Club students and they almost got that they almost figured it out without using Google or anything there's two different ways actually there's a lots of different ways to do it but there's two main ways if you can figure it out include a link to your code down in the comments don't cheat and watch the rest of the video but let's see if you guys can figure it out alright you give up alright so there's two ways we can create a for loop that loops through the entire list and compares the number it's on to the highest number it has encountered so far so we create a variable called largest and we're just going to set that equal to zero zero is right now the largest number that we have then what we can do is we can create a for loop that for I in numbers so for a variable inside of our list of numbers we will compare if I is larger than largest so basically is the number we're on bigger than the number we've already encountered if so set this new number that we're currently on to be the largest number so largest equals I and then we can go ahead and then just print out largest cool so if we run this we can see in our console it started at six thousand nine hundred seven went through these numbers until it hit eight thousand six hundred thirty nine switch that to be the largest number until it hit this number here switched that to be largest and then went through the rest of the list until it hit the last number this last number is actually the largest number but pythons clever there's actually a builtin method that you can use so what we can do is we can let's just print out the max value that's in this numbers list run it and we print out the largest value it's that easy Python thought ahead Python is used to dealing with large sets of data so it created a builtin function that allows us to find the largest number in this list now why would we use this function instead of the for loop why do they even create this well the for loop take some time to run a for loop has a time cost to it so you can imagine a hundred numbers not a big deal a thousand numbers probably not a big deal two hundred and fifty billion numbers that's a big deal creating a four loop that will loop through every single number and check every single number against a value that you have stored that's gonna take a lot longer than a builtin function so Python is used to be using we're dealing with large values so they created a function to handle large values at least when it comes to finding the largest value in a list all right hopefully you guys accomplished that challenge if not it's okay that's why we have these tutorials and if you want to check out the Python club head over to hacking is calm and sign up for a free trial so you can come join us and compete in these crazy challenges learn cool stuff that's not part of YouTube or part of hacking Tain's it's just part of the club the super fun I take a look at your code and answer questions it's a blast come check it out alright go build some Python stuff
