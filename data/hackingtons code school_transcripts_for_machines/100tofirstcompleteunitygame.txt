what is happening everybody christian here with the update on the game jam in the unity version and ah excuse me one second oh what's up admin oh yeah we can we can do that too for unity it's not just for scratch sweet when now well i got just the project okay cool yeah all right i just got word from admin that we get to authorize 100 for the first completed unity game jam project so this is going out to yash a congratulations josh a let me show you what he did this is galatia a lunar landing game it's got eight levels eight planets but no pluto starting off on mercury pretty straightforward gets the player a chance to actually learn the controls and try a little bit and then on venus you start seeing some cool effects new fire awesome land dodge and here's where it starts to get a little bit interesting now you can't touch the trees but there are certain parts where you can pass through so you gotta squeak through to get to the next level and on mars it's hard to tell where the bad guys are and where the landing pad is this is where it starts to get really challenging here on jupiter because you're coming down with such a high velocity you've got to really tap it i spent a lot of time on saturn ultimately this is probably the 30 40 50th attempt but the long and short of it finally made it uranus also took me a long long time to complete so just be careful when you're coming down there's a little thing you can touch on the end so just avoid that neptune awesome love the crystal design it's really unique you win great work yash and for everybody else following along this is a perfect example of what we mean by a completed game the idea is it has a title screen an end screen levels in between and design that makes it different alright guys good luck we'll see in hackington's
