have you ever built an adventure game where you're a scratch cat looking for the key to unlock the door to go to the next level well I'm gonna show you how to build one of those games now you'll notice there's no sound there's no bad guys there's no good guys there's no points you're gonna need to add all of those elements I'll show you the basics and then you make it incredible let's get coding adventure games need lots of different backdrops or scenes so that the character can travel from one backdrop to the next one so let's start with backdrops and it's called the stage menu if you just click on stage and then you'll have access to the backdrop menu that works pretty well that way you can start modifying that first backdrop now one thing I've learned is that in vector mode which is where this art editor starts you can't really just paint the backdrop you'd actually have to drag a box around the whole backdrop but hold on let me just undo this what you can do to save some time convert it to bitmap paint it and then convert it back to vector and then you're good to go isn't that crazy it's like a little tip do we want a purple starting screen not really but now that I'm back in vector mode I don't think I can actually just paint it I have to convert it back to bitmap paint it convert it back to bit I'm being converted so many different times good this will be our starting screen and then we'll make another scene so we'll best way is probably just to well come right here and say paint a new scene and then this one will be called seen one land one I'm gonna call it level one there make sure you label these these scenes or these backdrops because it's very important let's add another one and it will be called level 2 and if you have like ones in the dude forest or ones in the jungle you can name it that as well there we go level 2 and for my game I'm just gonna have two levels your game is going to be much more complex because wow we're in the advanced scratch game building we want it to be advanced so let me show you what the basic levels for this kind of adventure gaming it look like first you are going to have like being the forest or in under the water or wherever you're gonna be I'm going to choose forest for mine I'm gonna make both of mine the same kind of a green background then I'm going to convert it back to back vector if I'm going back and forth so much I'm going to actually draw kind of like the maze we've done that before and my maze is going to be the color brown kind of like a hedge or brown hedge well a hedge that you've never watered before there's is that the color brown I don't know this is getting more difficult okay so we need to make this number quite large let's use 40 let's see if that works so I'm gonna have my yeah that looks pretty good I'll have my kind of the starting block where the scratch cat is gonna start and then here is kind of the maze this look good okay well let's put in another little block right there does it have to be complex no not really and level two will also have that similar gotta convert this back to vector and I will draw up my may so I'm going to pause the video right now because I'm gonna draw these elaborate levels and it's up to you to use your own imagination to make yours look amazing alright so I have added a whole bunch of backdrops let me just show you what you'll need for your game a starting screen which I haven't put the directions on there I will level 1 level 2 level 3 level 4 a game over screen and a you win screen all right well they're not screens they're costumes for the backdrop that sounds strange your backdrop has a costume ok so we're ready to start building this adventure game you've already built the backdrops now we're gonna add the characters the sprites that we're gonna use in this game and we need to add them all at the beginning because our code is gonna be so like woven together that this character this sprite really depends on the actions of this one to complete the game mind blown I know but let me show you how to do this go ahead and well we want the scratch cat but we want to name him something like cat well you don't have to use the scratch cat I am it's your choice then I'm gonna paint my next sprite as a door why because in our game we're gonna have these doors that you have to unlock to gets to the next level so let's paint a door using our door skills what color is mine gonna be I know no oh that blue is really cool looking blue door I'll make sure I put it in the center of the sprite right there and then I'll put a little doorknob on it which is gonna be black and you can be real creative with your door that's just what my door looks like and do I like the size of it well you can change the size maybe 75% there that's a good size for a door so we'll be using that sprite a lot in every level next I'm going to add well I'm not gonna paint my next one I'm gonna actually go into the library and I'm going to grab a monster I love monsters ooh this one's good Frank Frank don't hurt his feelings he's not really a monster he's a nice guy he just he just has a bad reputation anyways he's gonna be a monster in our game I'm wanting a little bit smaller there we go you can kind of size them up later we're gonna leave all the sprites showing cuz we're gonna hide them later in the next part okay so the cat the monster the door now we need a key key sprite now they have this cool key right here looks great but it's upside down I don't like that I want to go adjust it so go into the costumes for that sprite you can use the grabber to kind of grab the whole key and then you have this horizontal flipper you can flip it upside down whoops tonight yeah I got the whole key I'm gonna make it longer look at that all right so there's the key it's too big I want to make it like 50% of that size and now we're ready to work with the key it's not quite golden enough you notice that I want this key to be golden so I'll select the whole key and I'll go up to the fill section you know make it gold there it is oh pretty cool okay and anything else so we need oh yeah like apples or cherries or something to collect to give us points so let's see what kind of fruit we have apples there we go I don't know if they have apples in the Legend of Zelda but in my game we do and I'm gonna shrink the size using this size menu there we go so those are all the sprites that are gonna be in our game and we're ready to start coding now it's time to code our sprites what's gonna happen in the game this is the fun part let's start with the cat we're already on the you win screen you won no let's go ahead and click on the cat change his size to 50% because we want them kind of small in this zelda adventure game then click on the code and the first thing we usually do in the code is to deal with what happens exactly when the green flag is clicked and we're going to let have this position where the cats gonna be I'm gonna say go to 0 0 that will put him in the middle oh my goodness I got to get 0 0 how many zeros can I put there now he's in the middle now we're gonna do something super advanced we're going to make him hide and show hi didn't show that's not super advanced what if I did make it super advanced go on the looks menu and check this out set ghost effect to 100% goodbye cat this you win is in my in my way let's change the backdrop as well while we're here switch backdrop at the very beginning to start game there where's the cat he's a ghost how do you undo ghosts a fact I'll show you go to change and you want to hold I don't want to click together yet stop clicking together change ghost effect bye watch this negative one if I click on that like a hundred times there he is do you want the user to click on it a hundred times no you just use a repeat block go into control and use repeat block 100 times put that on here now start the game he'll be hidden and then he'll fade in isn't that cool yes but it can get better there's more folks let's also go into the looks and let's grab the set color and let's say set pixel eight this will be really fun pixel a to 100 now he's gonna be totally pixelated and then in our repeat we will unpick celatum set change pixelate by negative one oh this gonna be so fun here he is that is a thing of beauty and we haven't even started coding the cat we just kind of like made him up here but what a great way to start your game a professional touch now that we have that let's let's just leave it and let's go into all these other areas and of these other sprites and make them appear or not appear at the beginning so let's say the looks he will SH the door will be right here when the game starts so go to motion and here's the go to which has already set up with the right position and then this Apple we don't even want it to be showing at the beginning of the game do we we want it to be hidden so let's go looks hide where is the hide button there it is it is hidden and it's only gonna show itself when the next when you get to the next scene and good old Frank he's going to be hidden as well can't we just steal the Apple code there we go we'll just drag it when I drag it over it and he's shimmies that means it has been shared and I'm gonna oh no I need the key actually I do need the key because I want to in the very beginning I want to demonstrate how the key works so we'll say when the game starts you will see the key looks show the key show the key there we go so when I start the game you should see the door and the key and then scratch cat fade in all right we're off to a great start in the last video you added the hide in show and kind of the pixel a ghost effect on the scratch cat when he like appears isn't that magical I wish I could pixelate and no I don't that would probably it's like Star Trek or something beam me up Scotty so let's make it so the cat can move grab the key and unlock the door because that's the basic functionality so we'll go into the cat we don't really need to look at this code this is all the pixelate intro code so I'm gonna hide it for a second and I'm gonna add the basic movement to scratch cat which is gonna start with a wind start flag clicked I'm gonna make it so he follows the mouse pointer but I'm gonna show you a little bit of an advanced technique that I've been perfecting over the years and here it is I'm gonna use an if statement inside the forever loop and what I'm going to say is follow the mouse pointer so let's go to motion and we'll say where is that point towards mouse pointer and we'll use the move you've done this before look let's say move like three steps or five steps or something now this won't work because the if statement needs that condition that true or false condition and here's where I'm really proud of myself but I figured out that if you put a not touching mouse pointer in here it makes the movement a lot better not and then go to it's sensing touching mouse pointer now let me show you how this works starts the game look at that he fades in he follows the mouse pointer but if he touches the mouse pointer he doesn't move isn't that cool well what's the difference between that and the old way well if you don't have that if touching when he touches the mouse pointer he like shakes back and forth yeah not very professional and in this game we're trying to make everything really professional so this piece of code works really well but when he starts we want that fade in you don't really want him moving yet so let's put a delay before this code starts or even easier just attach this code to the bottom of the intro wow that's one large piece of code it's actually called a script yeah it's called a script when you add when you connect all the code blocks together we called those scripts so this is the complete code it should fade him in in the beginning and then follow he wasn't really pointing the right direction when he started we probably should add that point all these little nitpicky bugs you have to fix to get the code working correctly there there are you happy now when he starts he's facing to the right fades in and then after he fades in he follows the mouse pointer up next I want him to grab that key let's do that in the next video this is my favorite part of this game the key the scratch cats gonna get the key he's gonna put it in the door and unlock the next scene it's so cool but you got to make sure that the cat grabs the key only when the door is locked wait a minute did I just confuse you well let's slow down first of all the cat has to get the key and I want him to hold it in his hand like this if you just have the key as it is right now when you say go to cat it's going to go like that like it's in his mouth so I need to go into the costumes for the key and you'll see I've already done it I need to move the key to the right of the center and you could do that just by selecting the whole key and moving it to where you want so I want to put it right about there that will be perfect then go in the code and we want the key to start off well not him we want the key to start off right there so I'm gonna go to the code and say when the game starts go to that position perfect now if the cat touches the key then we want them to grab the key so let's go to control let's grab the if and then if touching so sensing if touching the cat go to that cat go to cat boom so this one should work perfectly but we need to wrap this in a forever loop yes and no I don't like to add a lot of forever loops because I feel that they lag the the game too many forever loops constantly running if they're hard to turn on and off in fact you can't turn off forever lips very easy at all without pushing the stop flag or doing the stop script I want to be able to put an off switch on this and that's why I'm gonna wrap this in a repeat until so go to control and look for repeat until now all we have to do is say well when do we repeat until well in tour till the door is uh unlocked locked unlocked how do we determine if the doors locked or unlocked we make a variable so go into variables and say make a variable and we say door is locked now in every other coding language you can't put a whole sentence as a variable but in scratch you can so let's just do that here it is door is locked is zero we're not gonna say zero we're gonna say true or false that's how we're gonna determine it so let's say at the beginning of the game we're going to set door is locked to true because it is locked there we go and as long as the door is locked you should be able to pick up the key so right in here I'm gonna go grab an operator and I'm gonna say if doors locked equals true then you can pick it up as soon as the door is not locked then you should be able to get rid of the key throw it away throw it away okay I need to get the variable right here doors locked I need to put that variable right there so go to variables grab doors locked and let's see if this thing works here it is he fades him he's going for the key and he's off like a race and it doesn't stick to him well why not let's go look at what's going on and repeat until door is locked equals true oh my goodness why didn't I think of that I'm repeating until this is true no I want to repeat until it is false oh my gosh so we need to cut the video or something no let's let's just say I made a mistake now it works perfectly I go and I touch the door so in the next video we need to make it so when he touches the door it goes to the next level awesome in the last video we showed you how to take the scratch cat pick up the key and go to the door we also made this variable called doors locked so we can kind of put in like an on and off switch on this forever loop it's called a repeat until which I love that type of loop okay so it works perfectly except for the door doesn't do anything well let's go code the door and what is the door gonna do well it's just gonna sit there till we open it so let's actually position it where we want to position it using the good old fashioned goto good and then that door which is locked will be listening for when the key comes okay so let's go into control and let's say if it touches that key so we'll go to sensing touching key if it's touching key and then it will open the next level but we're gonna use messaging it's not really opening anything it's gonna fire an event that event is a broadcast message which we will name next level that's a perfect one all right but when is it gonna touch well it's gonna always be sensing for the key well always sensing well actually only if it's locked it's sensing so does that mean we need to take this if statement and nest it in another if statement yeah I think so okay so let's go and go to control and let's wrap it and then say if and we'll grab the operators if invariables door is locked equals now spell this correctly true if the door is locked then if the key is touching then broadcast next level and we need this to be a forever loop so since we're gonna wrap all of this in a forever loop let me just show you let me show you my my situation I should wrap this whole thing in a forever loop but I think I can actually simplify my code by using a repeat until repeat until door is locked false I'll get rid of this just use this piece of code put that in there this should work repeat until doors lock is false we're going to check for the key and then broadcast next level after we broadcast next level we probably want to relock the door so we'll grab my variables and say set door is locked to true basically I'm locking the door after myself now what is this broadcast next level going to do a couple things first it's going to make the cat go back to the beginning so let's do that go back to the cat here is his starter code and we'll want to go grab an event that says when I receive next level we want to do like basically all of these things so let's just duplicate that and we want all of that code except for this bottom part we don't want that movement code because we already have the movement code and it's still running over here also I want to probably speed up the ghost effect we can speed up the ghost effect by chasing this instead of repeating 100 we'll just have it repeat 10 and then we'll change it by negative 10 oops negative 10 and this button negative 10 that's just a preference for mine to speed up the how fast it pixel lights or unpick slates and instead of switching backdrop to start game we will go to next backdrop also the key will need to go back to the beginning so we'll say when I receive next level the key will need to go to the starting position or wherever you want it to go so let's just grab this motion and set it back there I think this door code is should work pretty well now let's try it out okay don't let me down cat grab the key go up to the door when it touches the door next level doors goes back to being locked and I have this game starting to look good there it is next level there we go now so far the game works really well but there's one major problem every time we get the next level message it switches to the next backdrop and let me show you it will switch to here switch to here switch to here and then it will go straight to the game over backdrop we don't want that we wanted to actually check what backdrop number it's on and then say hey you win you made it to the last one so let's go look in our stage menu at the backdrops and let's see how many backdrops we have we can count or you can just look on the left side 5 we have 5 levels and then the back the game over and the you win screen so just remember that number 5 so backdrop number 5 is our last level let's go in the code for the cat there so here's that when I receive next level I want to add an if statement right before it switches the backdrop so I'm going to separate it right here go into control grab that if statement now that if statement doesn't need a forever loop because it's only gonna run one time when this I receive next level it's gonna check what which backdrop you are looking at because that determines which level you're on let's go and grab the operator and it's going to be the equals operator because we're to check to see if the backdrop number is equal to five and you'll find the backdrop number in the looks menu at the very bottom it has this one backdrop number it's a reporter a block reporter blocks report the value so it's gonna report the backdrop number in this case you have a couple options of what it could report I prefer number because it's easy to remember the number then the name so now if it the backdrop number is five when when this next level script runs then it's going to send a message we'll go to events and we'll say broadcast not game over we're gonna make a new message and that's gonna say you win that's a message the message is you win after it broadcasts that message we don't want the rest of the script to run we want to exit this script so we'll go into control we'll scroll down till you see stop all we don't want to stop all we just want to stop this script there now it will work let's go ahead and start the game and let's click on this function to make it work we're going to the next backdrop next backdrop and it well actually it won't go past this backdrop right here because it keeps just broadcasting this you win so what's gonna happen when you win happens let's set up a like actually started coding something right here let me just throw it away let's say this when I receive where are they they're in the messages when I receive you win I want to hide I want to hide the cat show and hide there it is hide the cat there when I click on that or when I win it broadcast that message it will hide now I'll want to put this code on everything else as well because I want everything to hide when I win just like I want it to hide when I lose now don't forget you have to switch the backdrop to the you win screen so we'll go on the looks man you will grab the switch backdrop to start game we'll switch it to you win and then because we're hiding it I always want to make sure that I show this sprite at the beginning so go to looks grab the show and put it at the top of the code for the cat because even though we're setting the ghost effect to 100% it needs to be showing so that the ghost effect will work I know crazy all right that should work for you
