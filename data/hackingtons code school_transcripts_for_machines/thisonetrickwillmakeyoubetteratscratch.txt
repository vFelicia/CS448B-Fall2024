this is going to be possibly the most useful scratch tip you have ever seen this will change your life what's up everybody thank you so much for checking out this video i am stephen croft i'm a cofounder at hackington's code school for kids and we're looking at scratch today so in scratch there's a lot of tools that people typically don't take advantage of the custom blocks the lists the cloud variables but we're talking about one that everybody can use and everyone should be using there is a thing at the very bottom of your screen called a backpack it's think of it as an actual backpack you can put stuff in there and then take it out at on different games so let's say you're going through here and you create um i don't know a a forever uh rotate 15 degrees when the spread is clicked so let's say you create this block and this is your favorite block of all time you want this in every game when i click on the sprite it spins forever well i could remember this i could write it down i could take a picture of it i could take a screenshot but there's a better way we can open up our backpack and just drag it into our backpack and now this script is available to us no matter what game we're building so let's say i create a new project here scratch cat i click it it doesn't spin but i need it to spin i go into my backpack slide that in and now the scratch cat spins it's that simple you guys need to be using your backpack the backpack is going to be your home for all of your more complex snippets of code that you want to use in other games you want to add an enemy to level two build a script for it add it in your backpack every game that you have a level 2 that you want to add enemies in you just slap it in there you have movement created drop it in your backpack then when you're to a game and you need to have input for the arrow keys or for wazda just drag it in and boom you are good to go you are going to build games so much faster if you have a robust backpack to pull from hopefully you like that if not i don't know just like the video don't do that that button just doesn't exist comment down below other really cool scratch tips and maybe i'll shoot a video on them and share them with everybody
