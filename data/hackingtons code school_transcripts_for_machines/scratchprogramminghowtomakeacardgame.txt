winner winner chicken dinner who doesn't like a good card game you versus the dealer oneonone and in our game you deal and whoever has the higher card wins like me winner I'm starting with a blank scratch project now I'm gonna add 52 card images but I'm not gonna add them one by one I'm just gonna take one sprite go to the costumes and I'm going to upload 52 images of cards right here the upload costumes here I've downloaded 52 images of cards and I'll give you a link to upload these or I'll give you a scratch starter template okay I'll click open Wow it's downloading all of these costumes and check to make sure that we have all 52 cards oh wait a minute I forgot the scratch cat was the first two costumes so I'll need to delete him and then I'll just scroll down make sure that we have 52 cards yes so the 52nd card is the King of Spades this joker we're not going to use we're only gonna use up to 52 so you can delete these other cards but I'm gonna actually use them as images in the game so I'm not going to delete them but it's up to you now I'll need two sets of cards in my game one for player 1 and 1/4 player2 so I'll go ahead and duplicate it right here now these are gonna be player ones cards so player 1 and these are going to be the dealer's cards and I'll need to separate these on either side they're a little bit big so I'm going to change the size to 50% and on this one 50% there that looks better that is a good time to add the other sprites I'll need as well I'm going to add a button that's going to be called deal so here is a blank button there we go I'm gonna put that where I want it to be and I'll just write the word deal on it right now deal there does that look great yes it does and then I'll want to add a backdrop because it's just white so waring let's just use a stock backdrop here we go this one looks good there and then we'll need to have a winner like it says you won that's gonna be a sprite that we're going to paint and we'll write the words winner and we'll make them big by selecting it dragging it so that it's a little larger change the color what do we want the color to be I think green is like a winner's color there we go and now we're gonna either want to position it over the player one wins or the dealer wins so let's get that positioning correct first let's go in the backdrop and add those words convert it to vector cuz it's much nicer to write so we're gonna say this is player 1 player or just player and we want this to be bigger we'll have that right there and over here we'll need to have select it and then unselected that'll allow me to write dealer and then I need to make that bigger there okay and they'll just line up these cards so they they fit where I want them to be now we want the words winner to go above either the player or the dealer and you notice I did the wrong color in my opinion so I'm gonna change this to is in vector mode nice you can just click on things and change their colors player what color don't want player player will be purple that's good now the positioning for the winner is going to either be right here or right here and we'll use the goto code so let's go ahead and say that when the game starts that we're going to hide it where would we find that in the looks menu here are the looks here it is game starts we hide you goodbye you are hidden okay but before we hide him I'm going to position it where I want it to be so if player one wins it's gonna go right there so grab the motion block and say go to that position we'll use an event and the events called when I when player one wins right so we'll make it player wins or just keep seeing playing one but there's only one player here player wins it goes right there and it will need to show itself so come in here and click show let's see if this works we start the game it's hidden the player one wins it shows up right there now if player 2 wins it's going to show or the dealer I keep saying that it's gonna go right there now when I moved it it automatically updated the motion position so the goto has been updated so I just need to duplicate this whoops whoops whoops and then replace this with this positioning and make a new message that says dealer wins dealer dealer wins now anytime dealer wins it will go there player wins there we go and then you can make it hide when you reset the game ok at this point in the game we haven't coded the cards to flip and change and to keep score we haven't done any of that it just looks like the game is done I'll show you something also a big mistake that I've made when I click on player one you'll see that it's in the wrong position I need to flip these so click on your sprites and make sure they are where they should be now we're gonna be coding player 1 first so select the player 1 card click on costumes and figure out what the starting costume is going to be for player 1 let's make player 1 red yes so 56 we're gonna be referencing the costume number like 56 rather than the card name it's much easier to use the costume number so we'll jump in here and we'll say when the game starts we'll switch to costume number switch to costume boy is down here it's actually doesn't have costume numbers on this so I'll have to just try it let's see is that the that's the black one and then the other one is the red one there we go and I'll come over and now what just share the code if you drag over another sprite it will share that code and will make this one the the zero one okay there we are we had a good starting position I'll switch back to player one and I'll say when I received the message deal like when you press the deal button then I'll kind of randomize which costume I'm showing so I will need an event when I receive not dealer wins but deal or deal cards new message we're just gonna call it deal when I receive deal change costume so how are we gonna change it probably kind of in a repeat loop let's go look in control let's grab that repeat 10 which we're gonna change the 10 but for right now we'll just leave it and then we'll go to looks and we'll say switch costume to and we're not gonna we're gonna use like a randomized number so we'll need to go into operators and grab pick random okay let's see if there's enough room on here now which number okay we have 52 decks in the cards so between 1 and 52 that will switch the costume now it's only gonna repeat 10 times so when you kind of like when you shuffle and deal and all that stuff it needs to be real random feeling if you repeat 10 times every time it's not gonna feel very random so let's actually repeat this a random amount of time okay let's where is that it's in the operators pick random will pick lets go between 20 and 50 times that's a lot let's let's test it click on the code oh those click there so it's gonna flip the cards between 20 and 50 times ending on a random card that seems to work let's go ahead and drag this piece of code on to the dealer card as well so both of them work now when we click the deal button we want this to deal so we'll jump over to the deal buttons code and we'll say when the game starts to show itself looks and we'll say show and we'll use a little event called when this button is clicked or when this sprite is clicked so in the events will say win sprite is clicked to fire that code so what is that code that is an event and will go in the advance will say broadcast deal and wait why are we using the wait because we want the cards to finish changing their costumes before the next part of this code happens let's try it it works now our game looks like it's done but it isn't because we haven't actually coded any functionality the computer doesn't know that this costume has a value of Jack what is the value of Jack I would say 11 right and this costume is number 7 so Jack versus 7 the Jack should win how are we going to tell the computer what the value of the jack is first let's create a variable well a couple variables so I'll be in the variable menu for player 1 I'll click make a variable and I will say player 1 value now on making sure that I'm coding player 1 right here after it's done flipping through all those costumes we're going to have it set the value of that variable set player 1 value to which ever costume number it's on remember these costumes they all have a number and we'll call those the value you can see that the number 7 well the card 7 actually is the value 7 so that works well it works for a little while let me just show you how we're gonna fix that problem first set player 1 value to the costume number that's in looks down here at the bottom cost you member this should work pretty well let's just test it player 1 there wait a minute does this card the two spades have a you of 41 no but it's the costume is 41 the problem here is is the two of spades more valuable than the two of clubs no it should be the same so we're gonna have to use some pretty complex mathematics but don't worry it's super easy let's take a quick jump back to think about what a deck of cards is let's actually look in the costumes for player 1 are there 52 values no there's actually only 13 values see the king is the most powerful card well in our game we're gonna make a slow so ace is valued at 0 right here or we could just say 1 ace is one and then King has the value of 13 now does this card number you know the costume number 14 is it have a greater value than card 13 no in fact it just repeats itself after 13 so of the 52 cards in a deck it's really just 13 cards and then 13 and then 13 and then 13 so that number 13 is really important let me show you how to use the computers incredible brain to do complex mathematics go ahead and jump into the code area for player 1 go to the operators and look for something called mod mod is kind of like division it takes a number like say 52 and we divide it by another number let's say the number 13 mod says is there a remainder left over 52 divided by 13 nope no remainder now why is that special because the cards are repeating every 13 times you can actually figure out the value of a card just by using this mod 13 well what's what we're not using card number 52 always well yeah replace that with the costume number this is a thing of beauty watch this put that in here so we're setting the player ones value to the mod of whatever costume number is of 13 mod 13 so that what the remainder gonna be that's gonna be the value let's see if it works there's the jack it has a value of 11 yes let's try it again 5 is fine yes it works now we can compare cards without having to worry about if it's what suit it is if it's spades or diamonds the only problem is is you'll notice that card number 13 is a king and 13 month 13 is actually 0 so there is a problem with our code but let's deal with that later now that we are capturing player ones value let's jump into the dealer card and set up a variable for the dealer we're gonna say the dealer card value and then we're going to do the exact same thing we're gonna say variable set dealers Valley card value to the mod where's mod I lost it I can't find mod it's way down here there it is to mod 13 of the cards I mean them the cards costume number where is the costume here it is it's in the looks menu right here costume number there so now they both should be working let's go ahead and put them right there so you can see it and make sure they are working correctly there now that we have both of these values working we can compare them to determine who won or who lost now we're on the final stretch because we know the value player ones card in comparison to the dealer's card so let's jump back into the deal button remember that button we actually used an event called when the sprite is clicked to broadcast the message deal but I use the deal and wait and what that will do is it will wait until all the code that's running this broadcast deal until it runs before it comes back and does anything right here so we we said deal so player one is like okay I'm dealing and then the dealer's like I'm dealing so everybody's dealing they're setting their the card value to this this costume mod 13 then we come back to the deal button and we could just set up a comparison let's compare player one to the dealer so let's do that let's go in the operators and let's say let's use the lessthan and greaterthan and well which one we're probably gonna want all three of these aren't we we're going to go into variables and say if the dealer card is less than the player card something's going to happen well let's just start with that cuz I don't need to show you all of these scenarios let's grab an if statement if dealer card is less than looks it's hard with scratch three to kind of organize where all the code is if the dealer card is less than the player card then who wins let's come over here and say player 1 wins or dealer wins good so player 1 will win let's go to events and let's broadcast player 1 wins you can actually use an ifelse statement we don't have to code so much so let's say I go into control and use ifelse and then we'll just say this if the dealer has less player 1 wins otherwise the dealer wins let's get rid of this attach it right here that's a nice little ifelse statement let's see if it works yes now fastforward a bit I want to show you a situation where there's a bug in the game look at this I got a Ching I should be the winner but the value is 0 and this for beat me okay that's just incorrect using the mod function creates a little bit of a problem right here so how are we going to fix this let's go back to the source of the problem and fix it there jump back to player 1 and right here it says set player value 1 to costume number mod 13 okay so this is where it's setting that value to zero we don't want that so let's say if in the control if the player 1 value this is actually pretty cool go into variables say if player ones value is equal to zero then we're going to set player 1 value to 13 it's like manual override there we go so now if if it just happens that you get a king then it will convert it to a 13 instead of a 0 let's go ahead and see if it works there we go on the first try now I know this lesson was a beast it was huge we've learned so much but basically you can create any card game by using this mod 13 trick blackjack poker the world is your oyster people still say that anyways I can't wait to see what you build with these new skills
