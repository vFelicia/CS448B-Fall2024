if you're building a scratch game you have to have sound no question games must have sound now in the scratch you can choose either play sound until done or start sound and if you click on them they do the same thing well they do the same thing but they take different amounts of time for those things to occur why does that matter we'll check this out let's say in a game you have a cat and you're gonna click on the cat okay that sounds pretty easy let's say this when the sprite is clicked we're gonna start the C out sound meow and then we're gonna change a variable which I've already made called sound finished we're gonna change it by 1 now this is the variable right here watch what happens when I click on the cat well it said meow but the counter went up immediately right when I clicked so what happens when you have start meow is it doesn't stop to run the code it just plays the meow sound and keeps going as fast as it can which is different from the play sound until done let me show you how that one works I'll take this one off and I'll say play sound until done now you'll hear a pause before the counter goes up I'll put the counter right next to it now it might not be a big deal in this game but in your code it might not work correctly because it might be waiting until the sound is done before something else happens perhaps you might have like a go to random position here now you'll really see the delay when I click the cat I have to wait until the sound is done now if I had the just start sound instead of the play sound till done there now you'll see it happen almost which one is better it just depends what you need for your game
