let's give the player the ability to shoot it's going to be pretty simple if you've done projectiles before this would be no problem all right so the first thing that we need to do is we need to actually create the Sprite that's going to be like a throwing star or some sort of projectile that the user the player will actually instantiate in and then fire so I'm going to come up here right click insert new object it is going to be a Sprite and I'm going to choose sprite from the menu and then I'm going to click somewhere up here it doesn't really matter where we click because we're going to move this off the screen and I'll explain why now we need to grab in the artwork for this throwing star so I'm inside the RPG assets I'm going to go to items and then go to weapons and my sure can or my throwing star is down here at the bottom and this is the Sprite that I'm going to add in this is the artwork uh import from files all right I'm going to go ahead and delete that first frame of the animation and it's just a single throwing star I'm going to crop around it so that all of the colliders and everything are right up against it and we are are good we don't need to name this animation or anything like that because it's just a single object that flies through space so now we have it here now construct is a little bit funny you can't instantiate objects that are just part of your project they actually have to be in the scene to be used so what I'm going to do is I'm going to zoom out a little bit here and I'm going to take this throwing star the shuriken and I'm going to move it off of the screen someplace where the player can't get to it and the camera will never see it it's going to be up off the left hand corner or bottom right or somewhere off of the regular screen but it's still there because I'm going to need to actually instantiate a copy of it I'm going to need some of these traits to stay all of the time one of those traits is the size I'm going to change the size from 18 by 18 to 8 by 8. that is about half the size of one of these squares which is a perfect size to be a throwable object that looks awesome then I'm going to go ahead and select it from my project pane here this grabs the parent the actual like cut prefab of this object and I'm going to go ahead and add a behavior to it and it's going to be a bullet Behavior because this is going to act like a bullet double click to add that in that looks awesome now a couple of things that you might want to change about this bullet Behavior now these are up to you whether or not you want to change this here's the speed that is how fast this gets thrown so play your game see how it works and then you might want to just change the speed right off the bat this right here is bounce off solids so anytime it hits an edge or it hits a wall or hits something like that it'll actually bounce off this can actually be turned on and off in your event sheet to give your bullets kind of power ups same with the speed you could actually make them fire faster and move faster depending on certain things they collect in the scene so for me I'm going to leave this off because I don't want it to bounce off yet but later down the road I might give the player the ability to unlock the ability for this to to bounce off all right so we have everything in our scene let's go ahead and go to the event sheet and add in all of the events I'm going to add a new event and when the mouse left button is clicked so I want to find the left button clicked so on click and then which Mouse button we're going to choose the left Mouse button which click type it's clicked we could also do double click so they actually have to double click to shoot but clicked feels better in a game if you're playing any professional game you click to shoot and that's what we're going to do here we're going to go ahead and hit done so now when the mouse is left button is clicked we're going to fire something so just in case you guys don't know there are two or more buttons on your map on your mouse there's the left click which is where your index finger rests and the right click which is where your middle finger rests we want left click that's where your pointer finger rests and so that's what we're going to use now we're going to go ahead and add in some actions the first thing that we're going to add in is the player is going to spawn an object and that object is going to be that sure kit I named mine Sprite let's go ahead and rename that once we add in this event it's going to be on layer 0 which is the same layer as the player is on and all of that looks good let's go ahead and click done now I'm just going to rename this sprite from Sprite to be um uh star for for like a throwing star awesome I love how you change it here and it changes it everywhere in your code you don't have to go back through and refactor or anything so now that we've spawned one in we need to set its position to be the same position as the player so it spawns in and then like goes to the player so that when we set the bullet angle and we actually fire the bullet we do that from the player not from some random spot on the screen so let's add an action and we're going to change something about the star we're going to set its position so let's go ahead and find set position so I can type set and we want set position we're going to set the position now the X position is going to be the same as the player so we can grab the player and their X component of their position and we're gonna do the same thing for the Y we're going to grab the player and grab the Y component of its transform of its position and then hit done so this line of code will actually set the position of the star to be the position of the player zoom in a little bit so you can see that a bit better now when we hit left button we also want to set the angle that the bullet is facing set the angle the bullet is facing to face the mouse because the mouse is how we Aim so we're going to go ahead and add an action it's going to be on the throwing star the throwing star is doing something and we are setting the bullet angle we're not setting the angle of the throwing star we're setting the bullet angle this is very different so we want to set the angle of motion on the bullet now this takes in um a little bit of code so the angle is going to be an a certain angle the angle takes in some parameters it takes a first X and Y and then a second X and Y so the first X and Y is going to be the throwing stars or the Stars X and Y star dot X comma star dot y now the second one is the mouse's position so Mouse dot X and mouse dot y now this creates two points in space and then measures the angle between those two points and sets the throwing stars angle to be that same angle which just basically says find these two points make a right triangle find that angle rotate the bullet to that angle awesome this is super hard to do in unity Unity we'd have to use our quaternion and Euler angles in construct we just right angle and then pass in the two things that we're measuring the angle between so so cool all right done we have this in degrees this is perfect now what I want to do is I want to wait a few seconds before it gets to straight so we've created the bullet we've fired it now we need to eventually destroy it so that we don't overload the ram in the game so system I'm going to go ahead and grab a weight and that weight is going to be two seconds if you want your bullets to disappear faster you can make this a smaller number I encourage you to change this number based on the game that you have in the size of your map maybe two seconds allows it to go across the entire map and kill every enemy maybe you need it to be 0.2 seconds because your map is really small and you don't want somebody like Superman to throw the star you want it to be like a regular ninja so I'm going to go ahead and do two seconds and then I'm going to destroy the star let's see if this works so I'm going to play my game I click and I shoot throwing stars in the angle that I collect now I can spam and shoot a ton of them before I kind of run out of ram but we can add a cooldown if you wanted maybe that's a pro video if you'd like to see how to add a cooldown so you can't just Spam and shoot a million times we can absolutely do that but for now shooting is working and it's looking awesome I'm super excited this game is really taking shape it's starting to become a real game
