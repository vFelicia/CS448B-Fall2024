someone asked me what is your favorite code block in scratch and it's a little surprising check this out in the sensing menu there is a code block that says backdrop number of stage and most beginners will see that and be like well i don't care what the backdrop number of the stage is and then you have these drop downs there's nothing else in there or is there now this code block doesn't work correctly unless there's another sprite in the game so let's go ahead and add another sprite let's add a beetle yeah the beatles i love the beatles oh this is just the bug okay so there's two sprites in the game now let's say this cat wants to interact with the beetle now this is the code block that will allow it to do that why because instead of the stage we'll select beetle there we go now we know the x position the y position the direction that the beetle is facing this is pretty cool i actually as the cat know what the beetle is basically doing so let's look at the direction so what is the value of the direction of the beetle in order to see this we're going to have to create a variable here we go so my variable already exists so let's set my variable to this block right here just so we can see the value right now and let's put a start flag on that so whenever the game starts there so the beetle is in direction 90. pretty cool huh now what happens if we just ah for fun let's just turn the beetle i'm going to use the direction right here oh you can actually drag it there you go i'm going to turn it there okay the cat will never know what direction we're facing in oh yeah the cat knows it's negative 145.044932 wow anyways now your sprites can know what the other sprites are doing and that's pretty cool
