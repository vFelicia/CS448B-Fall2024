00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - foreign
00:15 - welcome back in this class we are going
00:18 - to see list in Python
00:21 - list is a type of sequence in Python
00:27 - many values can be
00:30 - put into a single list
00:32 - bifurcated each with comma and all the
00:35 - values together
00:38 - mentioned inside this square brackets
00:41 - lists in Python are mutable that means
00:44 - we will be able to change the value of
00:47 - an
00:49 - first example there are four integers
00:52 - bifurcated with comma
00:55 - mentioned inside the square bracket this
00:57 - is a list having four values in it
01:01 - similar way we can have different types
01:04 - of data into it
01:06 - example 6 5.5 34.748
01:12 - see some of the integers float numbers
01:15 - and also a string which is book here and
01:19 - then again there is integer type so
01:22 - mixed data types can be
01:25 - put in a single list
01:28 - we can also mention a list inside the
01:31 - other list
01:33 - see the second element if you see it is
01:36 - a list having 30 60 90 as its values
01:41 - again playground is the string one two
01:44 - three is a integer again float number is
01:47 - there
01:51 - let us understand more by creating list
01:54 - using ideally
01:59 - let me first create one empty list
02:02 - I have Li underscore 1 as the variable
02:06 - to store the list and then I open the
02:09 - square bracket close the square bracket
02:11 - there is no element available inside
02:14 - this square bracket that means it is
02:15 - empty so I just press enter
02:18 - so if I want to know
02:21 - what is Li underscore 1 I can write l i
02:25 - underscore 1 I will get the values of
02:28 - this so as it is empty it will be
02:31 - showing again empty to us
02:32 - if I want to mention the values inside
02:36 - the list let me create one more list
02:38 - here line underscore 2 is equal to let
02:44 - me give some values 5 comma 9 comma 1
02:48 - and then also here
02:52 - laptop
02:57 - Mouse
03:00 - 3.45
03:06 - it is a complex number
03:09 - one more string with double quote
03:14 - so now I press enter so it will be
03:17 - stored in
03:18 - list called Li underscore 2.
03:21 - so l i underscore 2.
03:25 - so here is the list having multiple
03:28 - values in it having different data types
03:31 - now let us see how do we refer each
03:35 - element of a list
03:37 - for example I have Lis is equal to and
03:41 - ball and the list
03:44 - BF string 24 7 365 are its elements
03:50 - as we have seen string has index numbers
03:54 - for each of its character
03:57 - here the list also will be mentioned
03:59 - with its index number
04:01 - the index number always starts from 0
04:04 - when it is from left to right
04:08 - for example here and will be having 0 as
04:11 - its index number bar is 1 and the
04:16 - complete list that is 10 20 30 is a
04:19 - single list that is one single element
04:21 - having two assets value and then DF as a
04:26 - string having three acids index number
04:29 - 24 as 4 7 as 5 and then 365 as 6.
04:37 - now if you see from right to left even
04:41 - we can go from right to left the index
04:45 - number here it will start from -1
04:48 - so here 365 is minus 1 7 is minus 2 so
04:53 - on it will be ending at
04:55 - minus 7. so if you want to mention the
04:59 - position then we can say length of list
05:02 - minus 1 what is length means the total
05:06 - number of elements in the list is only
05:08 - the length so the last index number will
05:12 - be 1 lesser than the length
05:15 - the index number starts from 0 but when
05:17 - we count we count as one two three four
05:19 - right
05:21 - or we can also have minus 1 as its index
05:25 - number which will be the last element
05:32 - if we want to say the position and then
05:35 - index number plus 1 when we count from
05:37 - left to right
05:42 - so let us understand clearly using
05:44 - ideally
05:47 - so here in list 2 5 will be having the
05:51 - index number as 0 9 will be having 1 1
05:55 - will be having two laptop will be having
05:58 - three and so on
06:00 - so if I want to read the fourth element
06:04 - that it is a laptop here
06:07 - the index number is 3 so how do I read
06:11 - that particular element or extract that
06:13 - value here is I will be mentioning the
06:16 - name of the list l i underscore 2 and
06:20 - then I will open the square bracket and
06:22 - then I will write its index number which
06:25 - is 3 here so that laptop is being
06:28 - extracted here
06:31 - so similar way if I want any other value
06:35 - at particular index number you want to
06:37 - know I will be able to give l i
06:40 - underscore 2
06:42 - in this square bracket I will mention
06:45 - five
06:47 - so
06:48 - the value 3.45 has appeared here
06:55 - similar way if the index numbers if you
06:59 - want to run from right to left
07:02 - so you can have
07:04 - minus 1 minus 2 like that so nice will
07:08 - be having minus 1 as its index number
07:10 - from right to left the which is the last
07:13 - element here in the list so let us check
07:16 - here Li
07:17 - underscore 2 of minus 1 so it will be
07:23 - giving nice assets answer so here there
07:26 - are eight elements so the length of this
07:29 - list will be 8.
07:32 - so the first element in reverse order is
07:36 - feature minus 8 will be that so l i
07:39 - underscore 2
07:41 - of minus 85 U it will be the first
07:45 - element
07:47 - otherwise I can also give l i underscore
07:51 - 2 of
07:52 - 0 there so that is also indicating the
07:55 - first element
07:57 - as I said lists are mutable type that
08:01 - means we can change the value of an
08:03 - element
08:05 - so for example if I want to change
08:08 - laptop into a PC
08:11 - PC here 3 is the index number
08:15 - so what I will do it is so simple as we
08:18 - extract we will give
08:19 - Li underscore 2 of
08:22 - 3 in this place we need a new value so
08:26 - that value just we will type here that
08:28 - as PC there so that value is replaced
08:32 - here
08:32 - so if I see now l i underscore 2 will be
08:37 - with new value of the list
08:39 - if we are having a very big list
08:42 - we can also type it in the next line
08:47 - so for example I have l i
08:51 - is equal to I have a very big list
08:54 - for example wheat
09:01 - fruit
09:07 - vegetable
09:12 - rice
09:15 - some numbers I give here
09:27 - so if I want to give the next value I
09:30 - can just put comma and then we can write
09:33 - it in the next link so automatically it
09:36 - will take even the elements which are in
09:39 - the next line unless we close the
09:41 - bracket
09:47 - so now I close so the big list which is
09:51 - in the next line also being accepted
09:54 - here
09:56 - so l i is the list as it is
10:00 - so if we are having n number of values
10:04 - for the list we can put it into next
10:07 - next lines
10:08 - it doesn't matter
10:12 - hope this is very clear for you
10:15 - let us continue in the next class
10:18 - until then thank you and bye
