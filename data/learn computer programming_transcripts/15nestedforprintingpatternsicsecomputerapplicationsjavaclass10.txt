00:00 - welcome students in this video we are
00:04 - going to learn how to use nested for
00:07 - loop let us copy some codes from here
00:36 - so in next step follow we are going to
00:39 - learn how to print pattern so let us
00:48 - convert this as a simple for loop which
00:50 - is starting from 1 2 and then which is
00:53 - going to end when it is lesser than or
00:57 - equal to 5 so it is from small to big so
01:03 - it is increasing so it should be plus
01:05 - plus so now this is going to run 5 times
01:12 - and then when it becomes 6 it is false
01:16 - value so ultimately it comes out of the
01:18 - loop I am just removing this so now what
01:24 - it is going to do it is going to just
01:26 - leave a line it is not going to print
01:28 - anything file ends it is going to let us
01:32 - have another for loop here far in see
01:39 - already we have to use I so let us use
01:42 - another variable called j is equal to 1
01:46 - and then when j is lesser than or equal
01:50 - to for example 3 and then J plus miss so
01:59 - here we are having a printing statement
02:05 - strung out dot print line now let us
02:13 - print this star symbol which is commonly
02:18 - used to form a pattern so how it is
02:22 - going to run even let us consider this
02:25 - as only 2 for B so when it is 1 it is
02:31 - true it is lesser than or equal to 2 it
02:32 - is going to the next farlow which is
02:37 - inside this so J is equal to
02:41 - one it is true it is going to print so
02:46 - then it is to this is again true it is
02:51 - going to print when it is three this is
02:55 - again true it is going to print then
02:59 - when it becomes four it is false so this
03:03 - will not get printed instruct that it is
03:06 - coming out of the loop where it can find
03:08 - on printing line statement nothing else
03:11 - so it is going to give a new line and
03:14 - then goes back to this far to make this
03:18 - as two so here it is two and then this
03:23 - is true now again it comes here as I
03:27 - said before it is going to print three
03:29 - times so how many times it is going to
03:32 - execute three times of this one time of
03:36 - outer for loop again the next time three
03:40 - time of this having this when it becomes
03:43 - three this becomes false so it will not
03:46 - run so it comes out of this loop totally
03:50 - it comes out so let us have here instead
03:53 - of print line only print
03:56 - so three stars continuously it is going
03:59 - to print side by side and then when it
04:04 - comes out it comes to a new line and
04:06 - then again it prints three times star so
04:11 - it is three x star below one more three
04:16 - x star so it is like a rectangle let us
04:21 - change this name instead
04:28 - compile
04:32 - I think this you can see three times
04:40 - start again the next line three times
04:42 - stop
04:43 - so in case of this is 5 and this is
04:49 - three so one time it runs three times
04:53 - like that it is going to complete 5 into
04:59 - 3 15 times so every 3 stars it is going
05:04 - to come out of this and then prints a
05:06 - new line so like that three stars
05:11 - horizontally and then five times
05:13 - vertically it is going to print so where
05:17 - this looks like column three times and
05:21 - then the five times it is going to be
05:23 - like rows so let us compare this let us
05:32 - run so you can see three times
05:38 - horizontally and then Phi times
05:40 - vertically so Phi look like five rows
05:43 - and then three is columns so here this
05:52 - outer loop is responsible for making
05:56 - number of rows this inner loop is to
06:01 - make columns in case if we have here
06:07 - three times then let us have here six
06:13 - times what it is going to have six stars
06:18 - horizontal it is going to print as it is
06:21 - in the print statement which is inside
06:24 - the inner loop and then after printing
06:30 - six times it gives a new line again it
06:33 - was two outer loop like that it is going
06:37 - to print totally three times which will
06:40 - look like three rows and then six
06:43 - columns
06:50 - see three rows and six columns in case
07:01 - this is five and then this is also five
07:07 - this is going to execute five times
07:14 - columns like that Phi times Phi rows so
07:19 - it becomes like a square this doesn't
07:27 - need to be from only one to five it can
07:31 - also be from five to one
07:34 - c5 and then when this greater than or
07:38 - equal to 1 so this is also going to run
07:43 - five times but it is opposite side so
07:48 - let us have - - as it is from bigger to
07:52 - smaller so this also will print five
07:56 - times again the same output is going to
07:59 - come that is five stars in rows and five
08:03 - stars in columns let us run this you can
08:11 - see five columns five rows
08:21 - here you learnt how to print that enough
08:26 - left angle R square let us see right
08:31 - angle triangle pattern let us consider
08:34 - this pattern which prints one star in
08:38 - Castro to star in second row three star
08:42 - in third row four star in fourth row and
08:46 - Phi star in fifth row so here the number
08:50 - of rows equal to number of columns let
08:57 - us consider this is one then lesser than
09:04 - or equal to 5
09:05 - then as it is from small to big it is
09:08 - going to be plus plus every time I am
09:11 - repeating so that you will again
09:14 - event.listen and will become thorough in
09:16 - this so where j is 1 and then J is equal
09:21 - to 5 so which is 5 times again so 5 into
09:27 - 5 25 times the star is going to be
09:29 - printer and how it is you know that I
09:32 - times horizontal it prints and I go to
09:35 - next line items horizontally Prince Ferg
09:37 - like that it is going to repeat as we
09:42 - have seen this star pattern there as a
09:45 - rectangle triangle first row it prints
09:49 - only one column second row it prints 2
09:53 - column third row three columns so that
09:56 - is number of rows equal to number of
09:58 - columns how to arrange that it is very
10:01 - simple just we are going to link this i
10:04 - to j is equal to j isn't it so we are
10:09 - going to make this as i it is very
10:11 - simple to see now when is 1 it comes
10:15 - here and then 1 and then this one isn't
10:18 - it so J is equal to 1 one time it prints
10:22 - this star then comes out of this goes to
10:26 - next line here this would have become 2
10:30 - now so 2 means this is also 2 so 1
10:34 - and then - 2 times Stargate printer and
10:37 - then come to next Lane same like that
10:39 - when becomes 3 this becomes 3 so now 3
10:43 - columns it prints comes to next line it
10:45 - becomes for it this also becomes 4 that
10:49 - is 4 columns it is going to print and
10:50 - comes to next slide like that last time
10:54 - 5 and then this also 5 it prints by 5th
10:59 - row 5 columns and comes out when it
11:02 - becomes 6 the condition is false so
11:07 - ultimately it comes out of this loop so
11:09 - that is it is coming out of the loop let
11:14 - us compile this turn this so you can see
11:21 - the triangle pattern now let us consider
11:30 - number pattern which is like this C 1
11:35 - then here 2 2 times 3 3 times 4 4 times
11:41 - 5 items again it is same like this but
11:44 - instead of star it is a number so just
11:49 - little bit think about this what it is
11:52 - go back to the program see here you're
11:56 - printing star just instead of this we
12:03 - are going to have is printing statement
12:08 - C now what happens here is 1 and then it
12:14 - is true it comes here this is also 1 1
12:17 - time
12:18 - it prints either is 1 it comes to next
12:21 - line this is 2 so 1 2 this is 2 it is
12:26 - going to print i value is values 2 in
12:29 - this loop right
12:30 - so 2 times it prints to then comes to
12:34 - next line again it becomes 3 here so it
12:37 - is 3 I 3 leaves 3 for this look so 3 3 3
12:41 - it prints 3 times like that it is going
12:44 - to execute five times
12:46 - let us compare this
12:57 - so you can see that one two three four
13:01 - five like that in case you need a
13:08 - pattern like this for example 1 1 2 1 2
13:16 - 3 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 so just think about
13:21 - this what is this every time it changes
13:26 - is J here in the thing we are going to
13:29 - just modify this s J see now for first
13:40 - time of this J is equal to 1 it prints 1
13:43 - then comes out this becomes 2 this is 2
13:47 - then it prints 1 2 again next line it
13:53 - becomes 3 this is 3 so for first time it
13:57 - prints 1 second time of this two third
14:01 - time of this is 3 so like that five
14:03 - times it is going to say 1 1 2 1 2 3 1 2
14:14 - 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 Rogen's this doesn't need
14:25 - to be from only 1 to 5 this also can
14:28 - change as we need and then linking of
14:32 - this also can be changed as per the
14:35 - pattern we are going to print on the
14:38 - screen let us consider other one let us
14:45 - consider this type of pattern so here we
14:49 - have 5 times 5 and the next 4 times 4 3
14:55 - times 3 and then so on so in case we are
15:03 - starting from the higher to lower level
15:06 - so then I will become Phi
15:10 - then I is greater than or equal to 1
15:18 - then it is from bigger to smaller we
15:22 - must use here - - and then just we see
15:27 - here this is 5 this becomes 5 so 1 2 5
15:33 - it will get executed as we are having
15:37 - here and then this becomes 4 this also
15:44 - becomes 4 so 1 2 4 it is going to ask
15:48 - you but here it we have to check what it
15:52 - is going to print so if J is going to be
15:55 - printed and then every time it changes
15:56 - or if it is going to print I means in a
16:01 - row it is going to be same thing here we
16:05 - have seen the same thing so let us have
16:08 - here only I see now that same pattern
16:15 - given so 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 1 in case we need
16:28 - another type of pattern 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3
16:34 - 4 1 2 3 1 2 and 1 so let us consider
16:41 - this pattern so for that we need to
16:47 - print J here because every time it
16:51 - changes see it is very simple now 5 this
16:55 - is 5 so it is going to execute 1 2 5 so
17:00 - 1 2 5 it will print again then which
17:02 - becomes 4 this becomes 4 so it is going
17:04 - to print 1 2 4 like that
17:06 - compile
17:14 - so you can see 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 1
17:18 - 2 1 as we have seen here students I hope
17:25 - you learnt how to create patterns using
17:29 - this nested for loop in next session
17:33 - also we will see some more patterns keep
17:39 - watching my videos subscribe and like
17:43 - thank you
