00:00 - my dear students in this video we are
00:02 - going to learn
00:03 - components or structure of python
00:06 - program
00:08 - while writing a program we can use
00:11 - letters digits
00:14 - special symbols which are all displayed
00:16 - here
00:18 - and all the white spaces like blank
00:20 - space
00:21 - tabs carries written and etc
00:24 - and also python can process all ascii
00:27 - and unicode characters
00:29 - as its data are constants so let us see
00:33 - the components of a
00:34 - python program comments
00:38 - statements keywords
00:42 - identifiers expressions
00:46 - functions blocks and indentation
00:51 - symbols i will explain all these using a
00:54 - simple program which is made for you
01:00 - i try to put all the components of the
01:02 - program
01:04 - in this small program this is a program
01:08 - which takes two numbers and then prints
01:10 - the greater number and also shows the
01:12 - difference
01:13 - okay you don't need to understand this
01:15 - program at all
01:16 - you just concentrate whatever i explain
01:19 - you try to understand it
01:21 - in the beginning of the learning of any
01:24 - language
01:25 - you may not understand all the things
01:27 - which has been explained but
01:29 - later part when you are learning
01:31 - programming
01:32 - one by one you will understand it
01:34 - clearly so never worry if you don't
01:36 - understand
01:37 - few of the things in this simply i
01:39 - wanted to show you the output
01:41 - so i run this i enter a number
01:46 - 10 another number maybe 12
01:50 - so it shows 12 is greater and then 2 is
01:54 - the difference between 10 and 12
01:56 - okay now if you see
01:59 - many instructions are made
02:02 - together to make one simple program
02:06 - the instruction that computer language
02:08 - can execute
02:10 - are called statements for example
02:13 - this line prints this line evaluates
02:17 - and stores in d similarly
02:20 - any action is taken place then it is
02:23 - called
02:24 - a statement but it is not necessary that
02:27 - every statement results in a value
02:29 - now if you see the first line it starts
02:33 - with
02:33 - hashtag and then one line is given
02:38 - this is a reference line given by the
02:41 - programmer
02:42 - to understand that particular program
02:45 - are some other reference
02:47 - this is called comment a single line
02:49 - comment
02:51 - always starts with hashtag comment can
02:54 - also be given in the middle of the
02:57 - program
02:58 - after the code this is called
03:02 - inline comment these are not executable
03:05 - as a programming code so these both are
03:09 - comments in case a programmer needs to
03:13 - give
03:14 - reference using many lines he or she can
03:18 - use hashtag for every line in the
03:20 - beginning
03:22 - otherwise another option is there a
03:25 - triple quote
03:26 - can be given in the beginning and then
03:29 - where it ends
03:30 - again it end with triple quote this also
03:34 - can be a
03:35 - single quotes here it is
03:38 - double quote given it also can be
03:41 - a single quote but three times
03:43 - repeatedly given
03:45 - this is also called doc strings now in
03:48 - the second line if you see
03:50 - here a great is given and then here
03:53 - a and b is given here it is
03:56 - d and then here n1 n2
04:00 - all these are names
04:04 - given by the programmer to a part of
04:07 - program
04:08 - r to indicate a variable these
04:11 - are called identifiers next if you see
04:14 - this
04:14 - brown colored text these are the words
04:19 - here def if
04:22 - else which gives a special meaning for
04:25 - that
04:26 - language these are called
04:30 - keywords there are around 35 keywords
04:35 - in python programming language next you
04:37 - can see here
04:38 - a is greater than b it evaluates
04:40 - something
04:42 - similarly a minus b evaluates something
04:44 - and then b minus
04:46 - a so the statement which evaluates
04:50 - something
04:50 - is called expression
04:54 - now again if you see about the second
04:56 - line
04:58 - here at last there is a colon
05:02 - after that the next line starts with
05:04 - some
05:05 - gap here so totally
05:09 - all these are
05:12 - sub part of this line
05:15 - so this is a block the whole thing
05:18 - here it is written as block of
05:21 - statements
05:22 - under the second line this is a function
05:26 - header
05:28 - similarly you can also see there is a
05:33 - subpart again for third line
05:37 - the fourth and fifth line together with
05:39 - some gap
05:41 - similarly 7 and 8 line is a part of this
05:44 - so all these three are blocks
05:51 - next if you see the gap this
05:54 - gap is a collection of four white spaces
06:00 - this is called indentation so each block
06:03 - of
06:04 - code is given with indentation
06:08 - if one more subpart is there
06:12 - and then it will have two indents
06:15 - as given here so in the fifth line also
06:18 - it is having two indents so these
06:21 - two are a block of this line
06:25 - so now i think you understood what is
06:28 - block and what is indentation
06:30 - if you see the second line this is a
06:33 - function
06:34 - header function is a block of code
06:37 - which runs when it is called
06:41 - even if this here print is also a
06:44 - function
06:45 - it runs when it has been called this is
06:47 - predefined
06:48 - already in the python program here this
06:51 - is
06:52 - created by user similarly you can see
06:59 - int and input see input is also
07:03 - a function inside the other function
07:06 - called
07:06 - in we will see elaborately about
07:10 - functions
07:10 - in future classes this is just to know
07:13 - what are all the components
07:14 - so if you don't understand even you
07:17 - don't need to worry about this
07:18 - we have also used open bracket
07:22 - comma then close bracket
07:26 - colon all these
07:29 - these are all symbols these are the
07:33 - main components of a program now let us
07:37 - revisit statements instructions
07:40 - that a computer language can execute are
07:42 - called statements
07:45 - it is not necessary that a statement
07:48 - results
07:48 - in a value comments commands
07:52 - are text added to provide the reference
07:55 - about the program
07:56 - there are three types one is full line
07:59 - comment which starts with the
08:01 - hashtag and then inline comment which
08:05 - starts in the middle of the
08:07 - physical line the triple quoted comments
08:10 - are
08:10 - multi comments or blog comments we call
08:13 - it as
08:14 - we also call it as doc string
08:18 - keywords the words which convey a
08:21 - special meaning to the language
08:25 - identifiers name given by the programmer
08:28 - to identify any part of the program
08:32 - see i always used to say how you are
08:35 - identified
08:36 - anybody calls with your name you are
08:38 - identified right
08:40 - so simply you can remember this
08:42 - identifiers are
08:43 - name given by a programmer to identify
08:47 - any part of the program expressions
08:51 - combinations of constants variables
08:55 - and operators that represent a value so
08:57 - these are always
08:58 - executed now functions
09:02 - named collection of statements which
09:04 - completes a task
09:06 - blocks and indentation a statement
09:09 - or group of statement which is part of
09:12 - another statement or function
09:15 - also called code block or suit
09:18 - blocks of codes are denoted by line
09:22 - indentation one indent level is
09:25 - equal to four white spaces
09:28 - hope students you understood most of the
09:31 - things which i explained
09:33 - thank you
