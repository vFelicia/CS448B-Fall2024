00:08 - foreign
00:16 - in this class we are going to see string
00:19 - functions in Python
00:21 - those who are new to this Channel and
00:23 - watching as first time if you need to
00:26 - know more about strings please watch my
00:28 - previous video and come back to this so
00:31 - that you can understand clearly
00:34 - plane of Str
00:37 - this will be returning the length of the
00:40 - string that means number of characters
00:43 - present in the string it will return
00:46 - for example line of programming as a
00:50 - string so the length of this that is
00:52 - total number of characters available
00:54 - there in this is 11 so it will be
00:57 - returning that 11 as the output
00:59 - we are having index of function
01:03 - this will be written as string dot index
01:07 - of the character whose index number is
01:10 - needed
01:12 - for example if I have a word called
01:14 - James Bond and then I need the index of
01:17 - yes then I will write like this James
01:21 - Bond as a string in the code dot index
01:24 - of s in the code as a character there
01:29 - so it will be returning 4 as the result
01:31 - next one in case we need to convert the
01:35 - string totally into the lower case that
01:38 - is a small alphabets
01:41 - then we are having the function which is
01:44 - dot lawyer of for example James Bond dot
01:48 - lower of all the letters in that string
01:51 - will be converted to lower case and then
01:54 - it get returned
01:56 - similar way we are also having upper
01:59 - half
01:59 - so that all the characters in The String
02:02 - will be converted to uppercase and then
02:06 - it will return again the example James
02:08 - Bond dot Opera now you can see all the
02:12 - characters are converted to uppercase in
02:16 - case we need the first character only in
02:20 - the capital letter then we are having a
02:22 - function called
02:24 - capitalize of
02:26 - this will be returning a string but only
02:30 - the first character as uppercase
02:32 - character
02:33 - this is the example here J becomes
02:37 - capital in it
02:38 - in case we need every first letter of a
02:42 - word
02:43 - to be capitalized
02:45 - then we are having the function called
02:48 - title of
02:50 - we can use string DOT type love which
02:54 - will convert each and every
02:57 - words first letter as the capital letter
03:00 - if you want to find whether a substring
03:02 - is available in the given string we have
03:05 - the function called find of this will be
03:08 - returning the index number of occurrence
03:11 - of the substring it will take only the
03:14 - first lattice index and then it will
03:16 - return for example james1 dot find of
03:20 - mes
03:22 - see here mes is available in James Bond
03:25 - the first character M of the substring
03:28 - is having the index number two so this
03:31 - is being returned if we want to find a
03:35 - substring only from the particular part
03:38 - of a string we can also give
03:41 - find of the substring and then where you
03:45 - need to start that index number and then
03:47 - where you need to end so it will check
03:50 - only in that part whether the substring
03:53 - is available or not all these functions
03:55 - now I will demonstrate so that you can
03:58 - have the better understanding first
04:00 - function we learned is length function
04:03 - for that we need to give a length lenov
04:07 - a string inside the parenthesis
04:12 - I say here programming
04:22 - so it has 10 characters
04:24 - so that is the length it returned the
04:27 - same
04:29 - it is not that we can give this string
04:31 - directly in the argument we can also
04:33 - give the variable there I initialize a
04:36 - string called St
04:49 - I want to know the length of this
04:51 - so I will be giving now l e enough
04:54 - s t
04:58 - if I want to get the index of a
05:00 - character for example N I say
05:02 - I will be giving
05:04 - this string that is s t Dot index of
05:09 - the character which you need so I can
05:12 - give here n and then close this
05:16 - so it will be returning only the first
05:19 - occurrence
05:20 - index number
05:22 - so that will be 4 here
05:28 - in case I want to search in the other
05:30 - part
05:31 - for example I take only from the
05:34 - index number 15 up to the end if any n
05:38 - is available so there it will take the
05:40 - first occurrence for example s t Dot
05:44 - index of
05:46 - I want to give the character there and
05:49 - then I give comma and then from where I
05:52 - wanted to start I start from 15 okay so
05:56 - I close this the ending automatically
05:59 - up to the
06:01 - last character of the string
06:04 - so it gives 24 so what is 15 here let us
06:09 - check n is 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
06:16 - 15 is p okay
06:21 - so from here 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
06:26 - so n is at 24 it returned in case I give
06:31 - after 24 it will be returning this one
06:35 - so let us check let me modify the
06:38 - previous one I just copy paste here
06:40 - insta 15 I give 25 and then between 30.
06:45 - so at 28 this n is that let me also
06:50 - explain the find function that also
06:53 - works similar like this
06:55 - for example if I give St Dot
06:58 - find out com
07:01 - so I will be giving us a string here com
07:04 - and then I close this it will be giving
07:07 - the index number of C there if the
07:10 - substring is available in the
07:13 - string
07:14 - so it is 6 similar way we can also check
07:17 - from the range
07:18 - I give here s t Dot
07:21 - find off
07:23 - I find out something else
07:25 - for example in iPhone in see there are
07:29 - two wins available one is in programming
07:32 - and Furnishing online
07:34 - so it will be returning the first
07:36 - occurrence index number that is ice
07:39 - index number you can see that is 23.
07:43 - in case I give 25 up to the end
07:47 - let me check
07:49 - St Dot
07:51 - find out in I need after 25 so let me
07:56 - just close this I could get 30 here
07:59 - so that is in online whichever in is
08:02 - there we can also give staff similarly
08:06 - in case
08:07 - if it is not finding the occurrence then
08:10 - what will happen it will be returning -1
08:12 - let me show you
08:14 - SD Dot
08:16 - find out
08:18 - we have here some I give book
08:21 - okay which is not there in the string
08:24 - so it will be returning
08:25 - -1 so that means find returns the
08:29 - integer number
08:33 - but in the index if I give the character
08:36 - which is not available let me check what
08:39 - happens book
08:42 - dot index of the letter which is not
08:45 - available here I so it gives the error
08:48 - message
08:49 - see that is the difference between find
08:51 - and the index find always returns the
08:54 - integer
08:55 - even the substring is not available but
08:58 - index
08:59 - if the character is not available it
09:02 - gives the error message
09:04 - St Dot
09:07 - lower C in s t l the starting letters
09:11 - Capital all of this are small so that
09:14 - starting letter also will become
09:16 - lowercase
09:17 - now let me change everything to
09:19 - uppercase
09:21 - before that let us check what happens to
09:24 - the SD it Remains the
09:26 - original or the changed one St
09:31 - it remains as
09:33 - the original
09:34 - so now let me change now St Dot Upper
09:37 - half
09:42 - all these are
09:43 - in capital letter
09:46 - let us also check the title case
09:49 - St Dot
09:51 - title
09:54 - so you could see each and every letter
09:56 - of a word the starting character of a
10:00 - word
10:00 - is in capital letter
10:03 - now capitalize I will write the new
10:06 - string here
10:07 - we are learning
10:11 - python Dot capitalize of
10:17 - so only the first character of the
10:20 - string will become Capital that means w
10:23 - become Capital now
10:25 - let me just check whether I have done
10:27 - all the demonstration of the function
10:29 - which I explained
10:35 - yes I have done all the functions
10:38 - demonstration hope this video was useful
10:41 - to learn the string functions still
10:43 - there are many string functions which we
10:46 - will be learning in the next class
10:50 - thank you
