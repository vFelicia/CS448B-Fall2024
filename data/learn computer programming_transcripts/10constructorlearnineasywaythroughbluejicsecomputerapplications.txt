00:01 - welcome back students today we are going
00:05 - to discuss about constructors and that
00:08 - program to demonstrate constructor
00:11 - constructors are very important part of
00:15 - Java the main purpose of a constructor
00:18 - is to create an object of a class in
00:22 - previous tutorial we have seen how to
00:27 - create the object of a class but there
00:30 - we didn't construct any constructor then
00:34 - you may have a question how it was
00:36 - possible to create a object without
00:39 - creating a constructor if your
00:43 - constructor is not defined then the
00:46 - compiler provides a default constructor
00:49 - for the class so it is possible to
00:52 - create a object without creating a
00:55 - constructor in a class there are two
00:59 - types of constructors one is default
01:03 - constructor and also called
01:05 - non parameterised constructor as the
01:09 - name it doesn't have any parameter for
01:13 - it
01:13 - the next one is parametrized constructor
01:17 - which will have some arguments as
01:20 - parameters let us create a program which
01:24 - demonstrate constructor fitness let us
01:37 - queue the comment
01:45 - example of a constructor class fitness
01:55 - when creating constructor you must know
01:59 - that it should not have any return type
02:03 - even we should not mention wide so let
02:07 - us have a constructor fitness of C there
02:15 - it doesn't have any return type but it
02:21 - can have the access specified we can
02:24 - give us public it is always better to
02:29 - give us public because we may need this
02:33 - to be called in another program let us
02:37 - create some variables double height is
02:43 - equal to 176 point gate come on
02:54 - wait a sequel 95.7 five-string name let
03:09 - us simply print the details name of the
03:23 - candidate plus name let us copy this and
03:33 - paste it down let us modify to print the
03:42 - height so what is height plus centimeter
03:57 - here wait wait wait
04:09 - plus kilo gram so let us have another
04:21 - method to create an object let us
04:25 - consider the main method public static
04:30 - void main string of arguments we already
04:40 - learned how to create an object so we
04:42 - have to view the class name fitness and
04:46 - then object name may be or is equal to
04:49 - new keyword we are using new again the
04:53 - class name of constructor doesn't need
05:00 - to be called but we have seen when we
05:03 - create a method we have to call using
05:06 - the object name but
05:08 - the constructor ultimately get invoked
05:11 - when the object is created we are not
05:18 - initialize the name let us initialize
05:20 - the name equal to a a let us compile
05:28 - this no syntax error right click so you
05:37 - could see name of the candidate height
05:39 - and weight is now let me explain the
05:49 - constructor with parameter so let us not
05:52 - have all these variables let me just
05:55 - delete this and then we are having
05:58 - parameter here double hit come on double
06:07 - w and string yeah here we are having
06:18 - three arguments so we should initialize
06:21 - the values for it this can be done using
06:25 - creating object so let us give the value
06:28 - for H one sixty eight point five comma
06:36 - seventy three point four five comma name
06:42 - which is a string should be inside the
06:44 - double quotation maybe BVB
06:48 - so in the parameter we are given as H W
06:52 - onion so let us change that in the
06:54 - clinic statement also so this here will
06:56 - be n then here it is H and then here it
07:04 - is W
07:08 - compel this no syntax error run this so
07:15 - we could say name of the candidate
07:17 - height weight let me repeat the main
07:25 - points once again the constructor must
07:29 - have the same name s class name that is
07:33 - the first point constructor must not
07:36 - have any written type like wide or int
07:42 - so these return types will not be there
07:48 - then the constructor is automatically
07:51 - invoked when the object is created we
07:54 - don't need to call as we used to call in
07:57 - the method for example we used to call
08:00 - if it is a method see now it is not a
08:05 - constructor as I change the name of the
08:08 - method here constructor here so it will
08:12 - have Godot fitness off so like this we
08:19 - used to call this calling will not be
08:23 - there for a constructor and also we can
08:31 - have n number of constructor in a class
08:38 - we may have constructor with parameter R
08:42 - without parameter when we don't create a
08:46 - constructor the compiler provides a
08:49 - default constructor students I hope you
08:55 - learnt constructor very well thank you
09:00 - and keep watching my videos
