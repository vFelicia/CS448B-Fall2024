00:14 - hello everyone welcome
00:17 - back in this class we will compare
00:19 - strings and
00:22 - lists when we initialize the string we
00:25 - mention it inside the quotation
00:27 - marks and the list we put it inside the
00:31 - square bracket and each element is
00:34 - separated with comma
00:37 - here when we access the element we
00:40 - mention the index number inside the
00:44 - square bracket with the name of list or
00:47 - string this is similarity slicing is
00:50 - applicable on both strings and list
00:54 - operators con catting plus replicating
00:58 - multiplication membership operator in
01:01 - and not in and all the relational
01:04 - operator works on both strings and
01:07 - lists
01:10 - functions Len index count Max and Min
01:14 - works on
01:17 - both insert remove pop upend clear
01:21 - extend reverse and sort Works only on
01:24 - the lists there are few functions which
01:27 - is especially for the strings
01:30 - that is changing the cases and checking
01:33 - the cases stripping the string and find
01:38 - all these Works only on the strings at
01:41 - last but which is most important to
01:45 - understand that strings are always
01:47 - immutable that means members of string
01:50 - cannot be changed but at the same time
01:53 - lists are mutable where we can change
01:57 - the member of the list or we can
02:01 - decrease increase we can do anything
02:04 - with the lists let us meet in the next
02:07 - class with a new topic starting with
02:10 - tle thank
02:13 - you
