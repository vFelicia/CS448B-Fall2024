00:00 - dear students today we are going to see
00:03 - calling parameterised function new class
00:15 - calling class calling
00:36 - let us like that
00:37 - method this user-defined method so
00:40 - static our public static status wide let
00:47 - us find one you so wanting power so
00:50 - volume to find the P we need three
00:53 - variables right into length into breadth
00:58 - and intake so let us have a variable
01:09 - integer variable to store the result as
01:13 - B is equal to length into breadth into
01:17 - height let us print this system dot out
01:22 - dot print line up so what we are going
01:26 - to print is here volume is equal to plus
01:32 - e so now this program will run if you
01:37 - want to call this method let us have all
01:40 - mode method which is a main method
01:42 - public static void main string of
01:47 - arguments let us create a object for the
01:55 - class so to create object for the class
01:57 - we have to write the class name calling
02:00 - and then object name that is identified
02:03 - that can be anything
02:04 - so let us I will be there will be object
02:06 - itself object is equal to MU this is a
02:09 - keyword and then
02:11 - you're calling so after writing this we
02:16 - have to call using the object name so
02:19 - object dot whatever the name of the
02:23 - method so that is we were right we were
02:26 - Elif
02:26 - so you can see here three parameters
02:29 - which is given in the method prototype
02:31 - this parameter is called formal
02:35 - parameter and then when we use the
02:38 - parameter here in the method call this
02:41 - is called actual parameter we can give
02:45 - the values here so let us have value 15
02:51 - 20 and stay so these values is just
02:59 - given here is called actual parameter
03:02 - that's a we can run this program now
03:05 - compile no syntax error so let us run
03:09 - this program so you got the internal
03:16 - scrolling is equal to 3000 so here we
03:22 - wrote a method user-defined method which
03:25 - is volume and then we call this volume
03:29 - here in the next method which is a main
03:33 - method here I hope you understand how to
03:37 - call a method in another method please
03:41 - watch my next video for future reference
03:45 - Thank You students
