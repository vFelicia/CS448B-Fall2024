00:05 - hello everyone welcome back in this
00:07 - class as i said we are going to learn
00:09 - simple queries in mysql we know that
00:13 - database is a collection of data and the
00:15 - data are collected in the form of tables
00:18 - if we are having a database then we may
00:20 - collect the data into different table
00:23 - for example i have a database called
00:25 - school in that there are three tables
00:28 - one is students where all the details of
00:30 - students are entered and then other one
00:33 - is teachers where all the teachers
00:35 - details are entered and then stuff where
00:37 - all the soft details are entered similar
00:39 - way there may be many databases some
00:42 - industry having different tables called
00:44 - workers expenses products and sales a
00:47 - sales is a database again where
00:49 - customers represent it even the product
00:52 - is there another example here
00:54 - india
00:55 - where details of states details of
00:58 - districts ministers and citizens are
01:00 - showed in the form of tables or
01:02 - relations how do we access these details
01:05 - let us see before moving into that i
01:07 - wanted to tell you one thing the queries
01:09 - made in the mysql is not case sensitive
01:12 - that means the queries typed in the
01:14 - small letters are in the capital letters
01:17 - both are considered as same after
01:19 - getting into mysql to know what are all
01:22 - the databases available in the
01:24 - database
01:26 - that is list out the database we can
01:28 - have a query show databases remember
01:31 - here any query we are giving it will be
01:34 - ending with the semicolon and then after
01:36 - writing that we need to press enter key
01:38 - so that it get executed now show
01:41 - databases will list out all the database
01:44 - names that is just it will say school
01:46 - abc industry sales india all this
01:49 - if these are available next if we want
01:53 - to get inside the database i already
01:55 - told you to access the data from a table
01:58 - first we need to get inside the database
02:00 - to access the database we will be using
02:03 - use the database name here i have put
02:06 - the database name inside the angle
02:07 - bracket to indicate whatever is given
02:10 - inside the angle bracket to be changed
02:13 - as needed for example if i want to get
02:16 - inside the database called school i will
02:18 - be giving use school and then semicolon
02:21 - in case i need india database to get in
02:24 - i will be giving use india semicolon if
02:28 - i want to use sales database i will be
02:31 - using use sales and semicolon similar
02:34 - way abc industry also can be used
02:37 - remember here we cannot have the
02:40 - database name with any space that means
02:43 - it should be a single word
02:45 - so now how do we check the tables in the
02:48 - database once we get inside the database
02:50 - that is when we are accessing the
02:52 - particular database to list out the
02:54 - tables available in the database
02:56 - we will be giving
02:58 - show tables and then semicolon so for
03:01 - example if we are inside the database
03:04 - called india then we are giving show
03:06 - tables it will be listing out
03:09 - state district ministers citizens only
03:13 - the name of the tables
03:15 - to display
03:16 - entire table for example a state table
03:20 - is there these are the details if we
03:22 - want to get all the details of this
03:24 - table we can give select star from and
03:28 - the table name
03:30 - for example here we will give select
03:32 - star from state and then semicolon then
03:36 - we will be giving enter
03:38 - so it will show
03:40 - or display
03:42 - all the records all the
03:44 - details of that particular
03:46 - table the star says all the from the
03:49 - table name whichever is mentioned where
03:52 - in case we don't want to get all the
03:55 - columns from the table but only selected
03:58 - columns
03:59 - we can give
04:00 - select
04:02 - first column name comma second column
04:04 - name comma third column name and so on
04:07 - how much are the columns that much
04:09 - column we can mention the name of the
04:11 - column to be mentioned and then we will
04:13 - give from and the table name whichever
04:15 - the table is then semicolon enter this
04:18 - will display only specified columns and
04:21 - all the records with these columns if we
04:23 - want to understand the structure of the
04:26 - table that means the properties of each
04:28 - column for example data type whether it
04:31 - can be null a primary key mentioned or
04:34 - not all these for that purpose
04:36 - we can give
04:38 - describe and then table name we can also
04:41 - use first four letters of describe
04:43 - that's d e s e and the table name to
04:46 - view the structure of the table let us
04:48 - learn all these queries by executing
04:50 - these now
04:52 - let me open mysql command line client
04:58 - i will maximize this
05:00 - zoom little bit
05:04 - i give my password
05:07 - this get opened this is the prompt which
05:09 - we are having for mysql so just i wanted
05:12 - to check what are the databases
05:14 - available on my computer so i will be
05:16 - giving show
05:18 - data bases and then semicolon enter
05:21 - so these are the
05:23 - databases available on my computer it
05:25 - showed india is a database so if i want
05:28 - to use the india database
05:31 - what i will be doing
05:33 - use space
05:34 - india and then semicolon enter
05:37 - so database changed that means we are
05:40 - now inside the database called india
05:44 - now i don't know what are all the tables
05:46 - available there means if i want to check
05:48 - the tables
05:50 - i know i created only one table here for
05:53 - teaching you all
05:55 - let me check
05:57 - show tables so all the tables inside
06:00 - india database only will be shown
06:03 - so as i said state is the table here
06:06 - even this will be
06:08 - viewed as a table
06:10 - even one attribute is here
06:13 - further the column name tables in india
06:16 - it has shown here these are all only
06:18 - views these are all not permanent now if
06:21 - i want to see all the records in state
06:23 - table select
06:25 - remember select to display anything any
06:28 - query you will be giving select before
06:30 - it all the details
06:32 - so star then from
06:35 - the table name the table name is state
06:39 - i can see all the details of state state
06:43 - underscore ut
06:45 - district zone language capital area
06:48 - these are the
06:50 - columns which i have let me recall here
06:52 - the degree and the cardinality
06:55 - degree of the table is
06:57 - 6 here as there are 1 2 3 4
07:01 - six columns
07:03 - the cardinality here is
07:05 - five rows so that is the cardinality
07:08 - okay
07:09 - now
07:10 - if we want to get only selected columns
07:13 - for example i need state district and
07:16 - area or capital of it what i shall do
07:18 - select the column names that is state
07:21 - underscore ut comma district d i s d r i
07:26 - c p s see i already told it is not case
07:29 - sensitive so i have given small letter
07:31 - still it will be accepting it and then
07:33 - i need a capital c a p i l all these
07:36 - columns from which table so
07:38 - you should remember it from
07:40 - state then semicolon
07:43 - i can see only the three columns which i
07:45 - mentioned with all the rows you can see
07:48 - here how long it took to execute it took
07:51 - just no moment so if i want to know the
07:54 - structure of the table
07:56 - i will be giving describe table name
07:58 - right state
08:02 - i can see
08:03 - the field names here these are the field
08:05 - names available
08:07 - the type of this field so state ut
08:10 - worker type it is 25 characters it can
08:14 - accept whether it can be null or not yes
08:17 - all the columns can be null
08:19 - no key is defined here in this table and
08:22 - then default is null so that means
08:25 - anything if you want to put as a default
08:28 - value that also can be given any other
08:30 - mention is not there if i want to go to
08:33 - any other database there is a database
08:35 - called world that will be defaultly
08:38 - installed when you are installing mysql
08:41 - let us change it to world use keyword
08:44 - space
08:45 - and then
08:46 - world
08:47 - you can see database change let me see
08:50 - what are all the tables available there
08:51 - show
08:52 - tables there are three tables available
08:55 - city country and country language if i
08:57 - want to get structure of the
08:59 - city table describe rdesc
09:03 - city
09:05 - so it will show the structure of the
09:06 - table you can see id
09:09 - name country code district
09:11 - population all these are the fields the
09:14 - type of this ids integer name is
09:17 - character 35
09:19 - country code is character 3 district is
09:21 - character 20 and population is integer
09:24 - null
09:25 - nothing can be null then id is a primary
09:28 - key any default value population is
09:30 - given as 0 there extra is given ideas
09:33 - auto increment if i want to check what
09:36 - are all the records available
09:38 - select all the details
09:40 - i can give
09:41 - select star from city
09:47 - so there are plenty of records in this
09:50 - table
09:51 - this we can use for learning purpose
09:53 - there are 4079
09:56 - records available to come out of this
09:58 - mysql we can type
10:00 - exit and enter
10:02 - hope the concept was clear
