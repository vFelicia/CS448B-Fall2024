00:00 - hello everyone
00:02 - welcome back
00:05 - in this class we are going to see how to
00:07 - find the sum of series
00:10 - the first series is nothing but the
00:12 - natural numbers up to n number or n
00:14 - terms we can say let us understand how
00:17 - it works
00:18 - 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus up to n
00:22 - we need a variable which will be
00:23 - initiated as 0 before totaling anything
00:27 - by default it should be starting as 0 so
00:29 - i initialize a variable called sum
00:32 - as 0 the series here starts from 1 and
00:35 - then ends at n
00:37 - n should be taken as a user input
00:40 - we need a for loop to start from 1 and
00:43 - then which ends at n
00:45 - if the user input is n
00:48 - it will be ending at n minus 1 so to
00:50 - make it to stop at n we need to give n
00:54 - plus 1 in the for loop so the for loop
00:56 - may be like this for i in range one
00:59 - comma n plus one
01:00 - now the range here is
01:02 - one two three four so that means ice
01:05 - value every time changes as one two
01:07 - three four
01:08 - we don't need to do anything just take
01:11 - this number and then add with the sum so
01:15 - we shall write sum is equal to sum plus
01:17 - i
01:18 - sum is a variable where the
01:21 - old sums value
01:23 - will be added with i
01:25 - every time the i changes the new number
01:28 - is added to the sum
01:30 - and then variable get updated as a new
01:33 - sub
01:34 - for your understanding here i have given
01:36 - the step by step process
01:39 - at the first round sum is 0 that is
01:42 - initiated before the for loop and then i
01:44 - is value now when it is entering it will
01:46 - be 1
01:48 - sum is equal to sum plus i that is 0
01:51 - plus 1 is equal to 1
01:53 - this answer 1 is been taken as
01:56 - sum for the next round here
01:58 - by the time i's value will be 2
02:02 - now new sum will be
02:04 - 1 plus 2 equal to 3 again the value of
02:08 - sum will become 3
02:11 - so ice value is 3 and then sum is equal
02:13 - to 3 plus 3 6
02:16 - so if you keep working like this the
02:18 - pattern clearly says sum plus i i have
02:22 - shown you for better understanding in
02:24 - red color i is 1 2 3 4 like that and
02:26 - then sum is every time
02:28 - it gets the new sum
02:30 - if you are clear with this concept and
02:32 - then future any type of sum you are
02:34 - doing it will be very easy so take a
02:37 - time bit and understand clearly
02:40 - let us go to python and create the
02:41 - program
02:42 - let us take the user input for n
03:07 - sum is equal to zero
03:09 - for i in range
03:13 - one comma n plus one
03:19 - sum is equal to
03:21 - sum plus i
03:24 - once it is done
03:25 - we will be printing the output
03:28 - outside the for loop
03:36 - let us execute this
03:39 - so let us consider 5 1 plus 2 is 3 plus
03:43 - 3 is 6 plus 4 is 10 plus 5 is 15 so the
03:46 - answer is supposed to be 15
03:49 - it is right
03:52 - let me consider the
03:54 - next series here
03:56 - 2 plus 5 plus 8 up to n terms
03:59 - so the initial number is 2
04:01 - and the next number is 5 the difference
04:03 - is 3 here again the next number
04:07 - 8 has the difference 3
04:10 - as the initial number is 2 i will create
04:12 - one more variable called ini
04:15 - as 2
04:17 - and then sum as usual it is
04:20 - 0
04:21 - every time i take this
04:23 - sum it will be ini instead of i
04:27 - i will be
04:29 - counting the terms nothing else
04:31 - every time the new term gets formed by
04:35 - adding 3 to the old ini
04:38 - i will be giving here ini
04:42 - plus equal to
04:43 - 3 that means ini
04:46 - equal to ini plus 3
04:48 - let us check this
04:52 - if i give 3 as the input
04:55 - that is 3 terms 2 plus 5 is 7 plus 8 is
04:59 - 15
05:01 - answer is right
05:02 - hope you understood this
05:05 - if i need to print the series instead of
05:08 - the sum
05:09 - i will take this away
05:12 - i will get the user input
05:16 - that means the initial value also from
05:18 - the user
05:29 - some i don't need to have it
05:32 - instead of the constant value 3 let me
05:35 - take even that from the user
05:37 - let the variable for the
05:39 - differences d
05:42 - we copy this
05:43 - and paste below
05:47 - enter the difference
05:51 - so i shall
05:53 - print value now as
05:56 - ini
05:57 - and then if i need to print in the same
05:59 - line i take the help of end equal to
06:02 - with one command space
06:08 - this i won't be required
06:11 - and every time we need to add
06:13 - d instead of this
06:15 - 3 so i add this here
06:17 - let us execute this
06:20 - i need 5 terms
06:22 - to ls initial value
06:24 - and then 8 as the difference
06:27 - so 12 20 28 36 44 is write series with 5
06:31 - terms
06:33 - now i have a new series
06:35 - to find the sum
06:38 - initial value is 1
06:40 - then 4
06:41 - then 9
06:43 - then 16.
06:44 - if you see the common difference
06:47 - it is not there
06:49 - so what else it can be
06:54 - try this 1 squared
06:56 - 2 square
06:58 - 3 square
07:00 - 4 square
07:01 - then it shall be
07:02 - similar like the first program
07:05 - number of terms let it be
07:07 - initial value is not required
07:09 - and then sum supposed to be zero
07:16 - in range
07:17 - n plus 1 is right
07:19 - we shall take the
07:21 - sum
07:25 - plus equal to
07:29 - i into
07:30 - i so that is 1 into 1 2 into 2 3 into 3
07:34 - every time it will be
07:36 - adding it to the sum
07:38 - when we need to print we shall print it
07:40 - outside the for loop
07:42 - print
07:46 - sum of series
07:51 - sum
07:55 - let me execute this i need
07:59 - 3 terms
08:00 - it is 14
08:03 - so 1 plus 4 is 5 plus 9 is 14.
08:09 - now let us consider this term
08:12 - 1 by x plus 2 by x plus 3 by x plus
08:16 - until
08:17 - n
08:17 - so for n already there is a input
08:20 - statement
08:22 - we need x
08:23 - so let us
08:25 - take x is equal to
08:33 - value for
08:34 - x
08:38 - see 1 by x 2 by x 3 by x
08:42 - so in the numerator it is nothing but i
08:45 - in the denominator that is x
08:48 - so just divided by
08:50 - x we give
08:52 - it is so simple to understand
08:55 - let us run this
08:57 - let us give the easy number
08:59 - to calculate manually and check it i
09:02 - give 4 terms
09:04 - x let it be just 2
09:07 - the sum is 5.0
09:10 - 1 by x that is 1 by 2 that is 0.5
09:15 - plus 2 by 2 will become 1
09:18 - plus
09:19 - 3 by 2 become 1.5
09:23 - plus
09:24 - 4 by 2 will become
09:26 - 2
09:28 - so the answer is 5.0 here also when we
09:30 - are calculating manually then it is
09:32 - right
09:36 - if this is x by 1 x by 2 x by 3 x by 4
09:41 - and so on
09:42 - it is very simple
09:44 - we need to just
09:46 - change the denominator and numerator
09:48 - numerator is x
09:50 - and the denominator is i
09:57 - here again let me take
09:59 - 4
10:02 - and then here as
10:03 - 8
10:05 - this says
10:07 - 16.666
10:08 - let us manually do this 8 by 1 is 8
10:12 - 8 by 2 is 4
10:15 - 8 by 3 is
10:16 - 2.66
10:19 - or let us give like
10:21 - 8 by
10:23 - 3
10:25 - plus
10:27 - 8 by 4 is 2
10:29 - so this answer should be equal to the
10:32 - answer we got from the program
10:35 - it is same
10:39 - let us consider now
10:41 - 2 by x plus 4 by 2 x plus 6 by 3 x and
10:46 - then so on
10:48 - the denominator is 1 2 3
10:50 - multiplied by x
10:52 - the numerator is 2 times of it
10:55 - so if you are understanding the pattern
10:58 - of the series then it is very simple to
11:01 - solve this so in the numerator we can
11:03 - put i into 2 i is going to be 1 2 3 4.
11:07 - see now you check
11:10 - 1 into 2
11:11 - 2 into 2
11:13 - 3 into 2 and then so on
11:16 - divided by x 2 x 3 x
11:19 - so that is again i into
11:22 - x
11:25 - so this is 1 x
11:27 - 2 x of x 3 x of x and so on
11:31 - you need to remember one thing here
11:35 - this multiplication and division
11:38 - both are having the same operator
11:40 - precedence
11:43 - this will be done from left to right so
11:46 - that is i will be multiplying
11:49 - into 2 divided by i
11:51 - then it will be multiplied by
11:53 - x we will write it in the bracket
11:56 - similarly the denominator also in the
11:58 - bracket
12:00 - let us run this
12:04 - i give 3 terms
12:06 - easy to calculate and then 5 as the
12:08 - value it is 1.200
12:12 - let us calculate
12:15 - 2 divided by 5
12:18 - plus
12:18 - 4 divided by 10 will be
12:21 - 0.4
12:23 - plus
12:24 - 6 divided by 15
12:27 - 6 divided by
12:28 - 15
12:30 - so here also we are getting the
12:33 - right answer
12:36 - so far we have done this series which
12:38 - were not having any powers
12:40 - now we are having a series which is
12:43 - having a power that is x squared by 1
12:45 - plus x squared by 2 plus x square by 3
12:48 - and then so on now we can understand
12:51 - that denominator is i
12:54 - so we can change this as i
12:57 - and the numerator if you see x square
13:02 - so we can give here
13:05 - x
13:07 - to the power 2
13:09 - we can use the power operator that is
13:11 - star and star
13:13 - x square by 1
13:15 - then x square by 2
13:17 - x square by 3 it is so simple to
13:20 - understand
13:21 - let us
13:23 - run this
13:25 - i'll give just 4 and the x value let me
13:28 - take as only 2
13:31 - 8.333 it comes
13:34 - let us manually calculate and verify it
13:39 - 2 square is 4
13:40 - so 4 divided by 1 is 4
13:44 - plus
13:45 - again 4 by 2 is 2
13:49 - plus
13:50 - 4 by 3 that is 1.333 let us give like as
13:54 - it is
13:56 - 4 by 3 iq
13:58 - plus 4 by 4 that is 1
14:01 - so it is verified
14:03 - next
14:06 - here you can see x by 1 minus
14:09 - x square by 2 plus
14:12 - x cube by 3
14:14 - and then up to x to the power n divided
14:16 - by n
14:20 - the pattern here every time
14:22 - the even numbers term
14:25 - has minus in front of it
14:27 - the odd number has plus
14:29 - so we need to check
14:31 - whether it is even or odd
14:33 - if it is r then we will have plus
14:36 - otherwise we can give minus
14:39 - let us check this here
14:42 - if
14:43 - imod 2
14:45 - is equal to
14:48 - 0 then it is even element we should be
14:51 - subtracting it so sum minus equal to the
14:54 - term is x by 1 x square by 2 x cube by 3
14:58 - that means x to the power
15:01 - i
15:04 - then divided by
15:05 - i
15:08 - otherwise
15:11 - else
15:13 - let me have the semicolon
15:15 - and the indent do not forget this
15:20 - now
15:21 - the same thing but we will
15:23 - have plus
15:28 - change this as plus let us run
15:33 - i will give four terms
15:36 - and the value of x again i will use only
15:38 - two i get minus 1.3333
15:44 - let us check manually
15:46 - x is 2
15:48 - 2 divided by 1 is
15:50 - 2
15:51 - and then minus
15:54 - x square by 2
15:56 - that is
15:58 - 4 by
16:00 - 2 will be 2
16:02 - next plus
16:05 - x cube that is 8 divided by 3 let us put
16:09 - this in the bracket
16:11 - then now minus
16:13 - x to the power 4 that is 16 16 divided
16:16 - by 4
16:18 - this is nothing but
16:19 - 4
16:21 - we are getting the right answer
16:25 - let me have the new series here
16:27 - x by 2 plus x square by 4
16:30 - plus x cube by 6 so on
16:33 - here always it is plus so we don't need
16:36 - to check whether it is
16:38 - odd or even terms
16:40 - i will remove all this
16:42 - now if you see
16:44 - the numerator is x
16:47 - x to the power 2 x to the power 3 so
16:49 - that means x to the power i
16:51 - so it is same as it is here and then if
16:54 - you see the denominator it is
16:56 - 2 4 6 that is i into
17:01 - 2
17:03 - we need to put this in the bracket
17:06 - so this is that here the pluses missing
17:11 - let me check now
17:14 - i give three terms and then five is my
17:16 - value
17:18 - i get 29.58333
17:23 - let me just check
17:24 - giving the values
17:28 - 5 by 2 is 2.5
17:30 - plus 5 to the power 2 is 25 divided by
17:35 - 4 i put that in the
17:38 - bracket
17:41 - plus
17:43 - x cube that is 5 cube is 125
17:46 - divided by
17:48 - 6
17:51 - yeah this is right
17:53 - let us consider a new type of series
17:57 - one exclamatory mark to exclamation mark
18:00 - and then keeps going up to n
18:03 - exclamatory mark is nothing but
18:05 - factorial
18:07 - symbol for factorial is
18:09 - exclamation mark product of all positive
18:12 - integers which are lesser than or equal
18:15 - to n is
18:16 - n factorial
18:18 - then generally it is written n factorial
18:21 - is equal to
18:22 - n into n minus 1 into n minus 2 into up
18:26 - to 1
18:28 - for example
18:29 - 4 factorial is equal to 4 into 3 into 2
18:33 - into 1
18:35 - 5 factorial
18:37 - we can calculate also in reverse that is
18:39 - 1 into 2 into 3 into 4 into 5 the
18:42 - calculation can be
18:43 - in any way but the result is important
18:47 - let us understand first how do we find
18:50 - the factorial of a number
18:53 - if we see the
18:54 - sum of series the first
18:57 - series
18:59 - it was 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus up to n
19:03 - the factorial is nothing but replacing
19:05 - this plus into multiplication
19:09 - if we see the series which is needed to
19:11 - be find the sum now it is 1 factorial
19:14 - plus 2 factorial plus 3 factorial so
19:17 - every time you are finding the product
19:19 - of 1 1 into 2 here 1 into 2 into 3
19:23 - the next will be 1 into 2 into 3 into 4
19:26 - so up to n you will be finding so every
19:28 - time you are taking the product of that
19:30 - number and then you are adding also
19:33 - so the code may be like this
19:36 - f
19:36 - always we use as 1 as default and then
19:40 - sum is 0
19:42 - for i in range
19:44 - it is same
19:45 - 1 to n plus 1
19:48 - f is equal to f into i otherwise we can
19:51 - say f into equal to i
19:53 - see every time this will be finding the
19:55 - product of up to this number
19:57 - just we will take every time the sum of
20:00 - that
20:01 - it becomes sum of each term
20:04 - let me elaborate little more
20:08 - so first f is 1 i is
20:11 - 1
20:12 - f is equal to 1 into 1 becomes 1 and
20:14 - then sum becomes 0 plus 1 is equal to 1.
20:17 - so here this one is here
20:20 - now
20:21 - when i is 2
20:23 - the factorial will be already 1
20:26 - so 1 into 2 is equal to 2
20:28 - the sum is 1 here that is added with 2
20:31 - now it is 3
20:34 - the next round when i is 3
20:37 - the factorial is 2 already now this
20:41 - 2 into 3 is equal to 6
20:44 - and then 3 plus 6 is equal to 9 so the
20:47 - previous sum is added with this current
20:50 - factorial
20:52 - similar way it keeps going
20:55 - now 6 into 4 24
20:58 - old sum and the new factorial has been
21:00 - added
21:02 - let us modify the program to get the sum
21:05 - of the series
21:07 - i do not need this x i remove this
21:11 - with this i need f
21:13 - and then some f is by default 1
21:17 - here i am adding f into equal to
21:20 - i then every time i take the
21:23 - sum of f here
21:25 - let us execute this
21:27 - i give 5 here
21:29 - the answer is 153
21:31 - 1 factorial is 1
21:34 - 2 factorial is 2 3 factorial is 6 4
21:37 - factorial is 24
21:40 - 5 factorial is 120
21:42 - so this is verified
21:44 - now let us consider a new series with
21:47 - the factorial
21:48 - so that is x by 1 factorial
21:50 - plus
21:52 - x to the power 2 by 2 factorial plus x
21:55 - to the power 3 by 3 factorial and so on
21:58 - here we need the value for x let us
22:01 - write the statement again x is equal to
22:04 - into input of
22:06 - enter the value for
22:08 - x
22:13 - in the numerator
22:16 - x to the power i is given
22:18 - correct
22:19 - so we will write
22:21 - inside the bracket
22:22 - x
22:24 - to the power
22:25 - i
22:27 - let us execute this
22:30 - i just give three terms
22:32 - the value of x let it be just two
22:36 - the sum is 5.333
22:39 - let us calculate manually
22:41 - x is 2
22:43 - and then divide by 1 factorial is 1
22:46 - so it is 2
22:48 - plus x to the power 2 is 4 divided by
22:51 - 2 is 2
22:52 - x to the power 3 is
22:55 - 8 divided by 3 factorial is 6
22:58 - so we will give here 8 by
23:00 - 6 the output of the program is verified
23:05 - let us see the last one
23:10 - 1 by 1 plus 1 plus 2 by
23:12 - 1 into 2
23:15 - then the third term is 1 plus 2 plus 3
23:17 - divided by 1 into 2 into 3 so up to n
23:20 - terms
23:21 - if you see now in the numerator it is
23:24 - sums of all the numbers up to current
23:27 - number of term similarly in the
23:29 - denominator it is product that is
23:31 - nothing but factorial
23:32 - so we need to take the sum also the
23:35 - factorial both and then again we need to
23:38 - divide both
23:42 - we don't need this x let us take it away
23:45 - to take the sum of numerator again i
23:47 - need one more
23:49 - variable let me initialize that as
23:52 - s as 0
23:55 - now i need to take
23:57 - s
23:59 - plus equal to i
24:00 - so every time it takes the numerator as
24:04 - that particular top
24:06 - now the grand sum will be
24:11 - s by f
24:16 - let us run and verify
24:18 - i give just three terms
24:21 - three point five is the answer
24:26 - one by one
24:27 - the first term is one plus
24:30 - 1 plus 2 is 3
24:33 - and then 1 into 2 is 2 so 3 by 2
24:37 - let me put this in the bracket plus
24:41 - 1 plus 2 plus 3 is 6
24:44 - and then 1 into 2 into 3 6 so 6 by 6
24:46 - will be 1
24:48 - 3.5 it is verified
24:52 - hope
24:53 - the concept is clear and all these
24:55 - programs we have
24:57 - seen
25:00 - keep watching this channel keep learning
25:03 - and also keep sharing so that others
25:05 - also benefit from these videos
