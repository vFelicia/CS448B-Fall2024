00:01 - welcome back students in this video
00:04 - lesson we will learn scope and
00:06 - visibility of variables the scope of
00:10 - variable refers in which part of program
00:13 - the variable can be used visibility of
00:18 - variables in a program depends on the
00:21 - type of variables we use so there are
00:25 - three types of variables available class
00:30 - variables instance variables and local
00:35 - variables there is including parameters
00:37 - let us see what is class variables
00:42 - variables the declared inside the class
00:44 - and outside all the blocks and also
00:48 - mentioned as static are called class
00:50 - variables these are visible in any part
00:55 - of the class I will explain through a
00:57 - simple program so I am creating a class
01:02 - called basic calc
01:13 - I will import Java dot util dot scanner
01:22 - class basic calc class variables are
01:29 - declared inside the class but outside
01:32 - the methods are any block it is also
01:36 - mentioned as static so I will give
01:38 - static int X comma Y two numbers I take
01:43 - and then some I calculate and then also
01:47 - product I calculate so now we can
01:50 - declare the method public static wide
02:01 - input off I you so I will take input for
02:08 - x and y scanner SC is equal to new
02:12 - scanner off system rotten system dot out
02:20 - dot print line of I say enter first
02:27 - number for that I take X is equal to the
02:36 - C dot next int are then again I need to
02:41 - take the second number a copy and paste
02:45 - it here I make it this as Y and then
02:49 - this a second number so now we have
02:54 - taken the input let me create one more
02:57 - method called Cal cough are some we will
03:00 - do wide sum of so here simply I create
03:07 - sum of two numbers
03:10 - yes is equal to X plus y so now I wanted
03:15 - to print this
03:27 - now I will create one more method white
03:33 - cloth so now I give P is equal to X into
03:43 - y then I also print this so I am giving
03:51 - here product then here it s P now I will
04:01 - create a main method I want her to call
04:14 - all the methods for that I need to
04:16 - create a object the class name is basic
04:23 - calc obj give as an object M is equal to
04:28 - new basic Kalka then now the object name
04:38 - this obj dot input off then obj dot some
04:48 - more for VJ dot crew off so let me
04:55 - compile this
05:02 - enter first number 87 23 so you can see
05:10 - the result is there so now it is clear
05:17 - that when we give as a class variable it
05:20 - can be in any part of the program so X
05:24 - is there in this method and the way also
05:27 - there this yes is in some method P is in
05:32 - some other method so here you can see
05:35 - this is a static method these two are
05:38 - not static method again here main method
05:40 - is static method so let us read once
05:46 - again variables that declared inside the
05:50 - class and outside all the blocks and
05:53 - also mentioned as static so all this we
05:57 - have done then it is visible any part of
06:00 - the program next instance variable
06:06 - variables that declare inside a class
06:09 - and outside all the methods and blocks
06:11 - is called as an instance variable so
06:15 - here the difference is we are not giving
06:18 - as static scope of an instance variable
06:23 - is throughout the class excepting static
06:26 - methods so let us see this so now I have
06:33 - static here I just remove this study
06:35 - here let me compile so you can see
06:43 - errors found in class let us see what
06:47 - and all the error so non-static variable
06:50 - X cannot be referenced from a static
06:53 - context in the next one again way also
06:59 - the same way here yes is there this is
07:04 - in the non static method so it can allow
07:09 - same like that the P also can be allowed
07:12 - in this method which is non static
07:15 - method so here we are not using any
07:20 - variables directly we have printed here
07:23 - itself so if we remove this static from
07:31 - this method then we can compile this no
07:36 - syntax error for so now this will run
07:39 - without a problem so let us run this one
07:46 - first number and then second number so
07:54 - we get the result here so the variable
08:03 - which is inside the class but outside
08:06 - the blocks without static then it is
08:10 - called instance variable next one local
08:15 - variables all other variables which are
08:18 - not instance and the class variables are
08:21 - treated as local variables including the
08:24 - parameters scope of a local variable is
08:29 - until the control leaves the block in
08:32 - which it is declared if we declare a
08:34 - variable inside the method it will not
08:36 - be available other methods if there are
08:39 - some blocks inside the block if we
08:42 - declare then interior blocks are not
08:45 - visible outside if we have variable
08:50 - outside the blocks the interior blocks
08:53 - can have the variable so let us go back
08:56 - to the program now what I do I remove
08:59 - this x and y from here then I make it
09:08 - inside this method int X comma Y see
09:15 - here it is inside this input off so you
09:20 - can see here there is no error in this
09:23 - block so here already it is showing us
09:26 - an error here
09:28 - because X&Y is outside this method so
09:33 - that is in another method cannot find
09:35 - symbol variable Y even cannot find
09:37 - symbol variable X even here in the next
09:43 - method also we won't be able to get the
09:46 - variable so whenever we use many methods
09:50 - where we are using common variables then
09:53 - it should be static variable that is a
09:56 - class variable inside the class but
09:59 - before all the methods itself we will
10:01 - declare so that will be the best one in
10:05 - case if we have these two in input
10:09 - itself so I will cancel this method
10:13 - itself I delete the method and then put
10:16 - it inside this here yes is equal to X
10:18 - plus y also been calculated here itself
10:21 - it is printer so there won't be any
10:23 - problem because yes NPR instance
10:27 - variable here it can be allowed inside
10:30 - this input off and then x and y are
10:33 - local variables so let us have this as a
10:40 - comment line I just hide this so now
10:48 - compile there won't be any problem it
10:51 - will print it will print the sum of that
10:53 - number so first number is 5 second
11:01 - number is 10 so 15 is the answer here
11:10 - now I will show how it works inside the
11:13 - blocks and outside the blocks for that
11:16 - in this method itself I create a far
11:19 - loop far I say X is equal to 5 then X is
11:29 - lesser than or equal to 10 X plus plus
11:37 - now simply I print X X so that is in
11:52 - print line next next line it'll print we
11:56 - have already declared X inside the
11:58 - method so it is taking for this Farlow
12:02 - now compare this there won't be any
12:04 - syntax error in case I declare here one
12:09 - more int M then M is equal to M plus 1
12:22 - so I will have MS 25 just for example
12:26 - say I come out of this far loop and I
12:29 - say system dot out dot print line enough
12:35 - I give you C inner loop I have declare M
12:42 - it is outside the loop so here it will
12:46 - not work so interior variables will not
12:49 - work outside the block of the code
12:52 - compile so cannot find symbol variable M
12:56 - but at the same time axis in the method
13:00 - it is used inside that far loop so that
13:04 - is inner block so it is available here
13:07 - so now let us see as a parameter so here
13:12 - I will not have this import statement
13:17 - then I will not have all these int X
13:24 - comma improvised so I have given yes is
13:30 - equal to X plus y so let us not have
13:32 - this far loop and all so this is a very
13:36 - simple one yes is equal to X plus y will
13:39 - be done without any error no error here
13:44 - so let us have this know if I delete
13:47 - this
13:49 - then I remove the salsa so x and y are
13:53 - parameter here it is the next method
13:58 - which is call this x and y see here you
14:02 - can see cannot find simple variable Y so
14:05 - the parameter also the local variable
14:09 - only all other variables which are not
14:12 - instance and class variables are treated
14:15 - as local variables including parameters
14:19 - scope of a variable is until the control
14:23 - leaves the block in which it is declared
14:26 - variables declared in interior blocks
14:30 - are not visible outside of that block
14:33 - variables declared in exterior blocks
14:36 - are visible to the interior blocks
14:41 - students keep watching my videos learn
14:46 - more share others Thank You students
