00:03 - welcome back students in this video
00:06 - lesson we are going to see string
00:07 - handling let us now see string class
00:12 - creating string a string is a reference
00:15 - data type so the variable yes I have
00:17 - taken string s is equal to keyboard
00:20 - inside the double quotation and I
00:22 - terminated so this is the way of
00:24 - initializing the string variable string
00:28 - object string STR here STR is the object
00:34 - name that is a valid identifier can be
00:37 - anything equal to new keyword we use and
00:39 - then string of mouse I have given inside
00:41 - the double quotation where the most
00:43 - store in the string object called y-str
00:47 - next string buffer class creating string
00:52 - buffer object string buffer yes b1 is
00:55 - equal to new string buffer off here yes
00:58 - b1 string buffer object has been created
01:00 - nothing will be stored in this next
01:03 - string buffer
01:04 - yes b2 is equal to new string buffer off
01:07 - Joystiq I have given in the double
01:08 - quotation we're in the SB to object
01:12 - Joystiq has been stored the third way
01:15 - yes b3 is equal to new string buffer of
01:18 - 20 here 20 is the integer number
01:22 - it creates an object where it can store
01:25 - 20 characters in Java there are many
01:28 - functions for the string let us see one
01:31 - by one the function here length of so
01:35 - what will be the output data type always
01:38 - it will be integer the length says how
01:41 - many characters are available in the
01:42 - string including the special character
01:45 - our space so here output data type is
01:49 - int for example I have given here
01:53 - keychain there is a space between key
01:55 - and chain which is in the double
01:57 - quotation Bo dot length of so here it
02:00 - will count all the characters available
02:03 - in it 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 so 9 will be the
02:08 - output next to upper case of here there
02:13 - put data type will be string only the
02:17 - function example here dr dot to
02:21 - uppercase of see here d is already there
02:23 - capital r IV is in small letter so which
02:26 - are all in small going to be converted
02:29 - into uppercase so then the output will
02:31 - be dr i ve in all in capital letters
02:34 - next to lowercase off the output of this
02:38 - also be string type for example I have
02:42 - taken monitor here to lowercase off it
02:46 - will be giving this monitor in the lower
02:49 - case the next one re place of world
02:54 - character dot new character that means
02:55 - we are going to give a character which
02:58 - is available in the string and then we
03:00 - are going to change into the new
03:01 - character which we want to replace so
03:05 - again the output data type will be
03:07 - string itself here for example I have
03:10 - given store dot replace whoa comma a Co
03:15 - is a letter here that is a character so
03:17 - it is been in single quotation same like
03:21 - that ei is also given in this single
03:23 - quotation so the output will be boy is
03:26 - being replaced with a so it will be
03:29 - stare next trim off here the output data
03:35 - type again is string type for example I
03:39 - have given some space
03:40 - I love Java then again some more space
03:45 - what it does it will cut all the extra
03:49 - spaces before and after the string so
03:52 - that means it starts from I and then it
03:55 - ends with ei the extra space before and
03:59 - after the string going to be trimmed up
04:01 - next can't cut off concat is going to be
04:06 - string type output here for example key
04:10 - which is given inside the double
04:11 - quotation that is first string and then
04:14 - concat off board I have given again in
04:18 - the double quotation here these two are
04:22 - going to be added together which is
04:25 - going to display nearby
04:27 - so keyboard will be the output then
04:32 - value of so this is also going to be
04:35 - string type the function here example
04:38 - string dot value of 32 so 32 is a
04:42 - integer number here please note that o
04:46 - is capital value all in small and then
04:49 - whoa is capital e effacing small letter
04:51 - so the integer value going to be
04:54 - converted into string value that is just
04:57 - 3/2 as they object here there are many
05:01 - string functions in this class we will
05:03 - see only this much we will continue that
05:05 - in the next class now I will demonstrate
05:08 - all these string functions through a
05:11 - Java program string STR is equal to I
05:17 - just give here mirror let me take a
05:24 - length of this so I need a variable
05:28 - integer variable so that is into L is
05:30 - equal to STR dot length of so let me
05:37 - print this
05:51 - Plus Yelp now let me also convert into
06:00 - uppercase so I can store this in the new
06:06 - variable after converting into uppercase
06:08 - otherwise directly I can print so let me
06:11 - assign to a new variable string str2 IU
06:17 - is equal to STR dot to you is in capital
06:23 - upper and then KC is in capital
06:27 - so now STR - becomes uppercase of mirror
06:32 - let me print this also in uppercase this
06:46 - just for reference I am giving so that
06:49 - is STR - after converting into uppercase
06:52 - it is going to print let me convert one
06:55 - more string into lowercase system dot
06:59 - out dot print line enough I am just
07:04 - giving here this is my book dot to
07:14 - lowercase of yelling should be capital
07:18 - then C should be capital lowercase F so
07:22 - now this is going to convert this is my
07:24 - book into lowercase C at this is in
07:29 - small all other things are in capital so
07:32 - let us compile then run this so you can
07:39 - see here length of the string is 6 in
07:41 - uppercase so a mirror we came in
07:43 - uppercase this is my book so this asks
07:46 - already in the small letters all others
07:49 - were in big letters so it has been
07:50 - converted into small at us the next we
07:53 - are going to see here is replacer
07:58 - so let us say we place any of the string
08:01 - with the other letter what I will do
08:05 - here system dot out dot print line off I
08:12 - will give here snow snow dot replace
08:20 - half a world character to be given here
08:23 - yes I change this here in single quote
08:27 - yes and then comma instead of that I
08:31 - change it to K so capital K so now the
08:35 - yes letter is being changed into K so it
08:39 - is going to be printed we don't need all
08:41 - these things let me remove this so
08:47 - compile this so you can see there yes n
08:54 - what W become K n roll doubly so let us
08:59 - learn about trim function now I will you
09:02 - here string STR is equal to with some
09:08 - space I give snow now system dot out dot
09:19 - print line off I am going to print STR
09:26 - next let me take this without space that
09:34 - is trimming it I pasted that same here
09:39 - and then hey here I go dot trim off so
09:45 - what it will do first it is going to
09:47 - print the original string here with the
09:50 - space and the next it is going to print
09:53 - after trimming it if I give space after
09:55 - this we can't understand but we can
09:58 - understand whether there is space
09:59 - previous to the string or not let us
10:03 - compile this
10:08 - so you can see that the extra space here
10:11 - is been cut let us give a lengthy string
10:22 - Snow is cool so it is going to cut to
10:30 - only the space after and before not
10:34 - which is in between so in between
10:36 - whatever is there it is going to stay
10:38 - like that next let us see the concat
10:43 - function I will add one more string with
10:47 - the STR so let me do like this system
10:52 - dot out dot print line of st r dot
11:01 - concat with if we take it in the handle
11:10 - let me cut this I will take this also
11:13 - so with this STR one it is going to add
11:16 - if we take it in the hand compile this
11:27 - so snow is cool if we take it in the
11:30 - hand it is displayed together now let us
11:37 - learn value of function let me take in n
11:42 - is equal to 45 so let me print this
11:47 - system dot out dot print line off after
11:53 - converting into string so that is string
11:58 - dot value of ricean now this is going to
12:05 - be converted into string value it is not
12:07 - going to be integer value how we can
12:09 - know this after converting this we won't
12:12 - be able to add any number with this for
12:15 - example I add just 10 with this if it is
12:19 - a number then it is going to be 50
12:21 - fight if it has been converted into
12:23 - strength ten is going to appear nearby
12:26 - let us compile and check see here it has
12:34 - been converted into string so it is been
12:37 - displayed and the near weight n is been
12:39 - displayed students I hope this was very
12:42 - helpful for you to learn the string
12:45 - functions let us continue the second
12:47 - part in the next video until then thank
12:50 - you students
