00:01 - welcome back students in this session we
00:06 - are going to learn do-while loop we will
00:10 - see how it is working and syntax of
00:13 - do-while loop and then we will do a
00:16 - small program that is finding multiples
00:18 - of given number this do-while loop also
00:23 - used when we doesn't know the number of
00:27 - times to be executed in free hand there
00:32 - is one main difference between far loop
00:35 - while loop and this do-while loop far
00:38 - loop and while loop checks the condition
00:41 - before going to the body of the loop and
00:43 - then it runs
00:45 - if only it is true in do-while loop it
00:50 - is not like that whether the condition
00:53 - is true or not the body of the loop get
00:56 - executed and then at last the condition
00:59 - is being checked so even the condition
01:03 - is false it will run once so here far
01:07 - loop and a while loop
01:08 - both checks the condition in the
01:10 - beginning so it is called entry control
01:13 - loop and dowhile checks the condition at
01:17 - last so it is called exit control loop
01:21 - let us see the syntax of dough in wig
01:29 - you do and then we open the bracket
01:33 - statements are written here and then we
01:36 - close here the condition is given after
01:40 - while keyword and then it is terminated
01:44 - using semicolon where we are not doing
01:48 - in far loop and while loop this is the
01:51 - syntax of while loop let us create a
01:54 - program throw that I will explain it
02:09 - class do well so I have public static
02:21 - void line off I initialize a variable
02:31 - Cali int I as one then do we have here
02:39 - body of the loop I just print one line
02:45 - system dot out dot print line now we are
02:56 - learning though while loop so later we
03:05 - give the condition here while the
03:09 - condition here is when I is greater than
03:12 - or equal to five so here you can see is
03:19 - initialized as one and the condition
03:21 - here is greater than or equal to five
03:23 - which is false though it is false
03:26 - without considering any condition it
03:30 - jumps into the body of the loop as it is
03:33 - do while loop and then later at last it
03:36 - is going to check whether it is true or
03:38 - not later when it finds as false it is
03:41 - going to stop see we have to terminate
03:44 - this in case if it is true again it is
03:49 - going to execute from the beginning that
03:52 - whole body of the loop let us compile
03:56 - this no syntax error so you can see we
04:03 - are learning do-while loop in case if we
04:09 - do here
04:10 - condition is lesser than or equal to
04:13 - five and then we give here I plus plus
04:19 - so it is going to increment after
04:22 - printing this then you will checks it
04:26 - becomes two that is true and then it is
04:28 - going to execute so it will execute five
04:33 - times like this compile so you can see
04:39 - this is one is previous output and then
04:41 - five are outputs you can see here let us
04:49 - modify this to get the multiples of
04:53 - number so I am giving here in M multiple
04:59 - and then how many times we have to run
05:02 - int n so we are going to have a
05:07 - multiples we can say I into gam and then
05:19 - I is going to be incremented every time
05:21 - then up to how many times n times
05:27 - compile this no syntax error let us run
05:31 - this so multiples of maybe five how many
05:40 - times maybe twelve times so you can see
05:44 - 12 times multiples of five
05:53 - dear students I hope you might have
05:56 - learned do I look very well keep on
05:59 - watching my videos to learn more Thank
06:03 - You Florence
