00:00 - other students we are going to see how
00:03 - to get input from the user in this
00:06 - session
00:07 - this helps to calculate the values
00:10 - according to the users choice draw or
00:14 - provide scanner class to take the input
00:16 - from user scanner class provides
00:21 - convenient methods for reading input
00:23 - values of various types we will create a
00:27 - class say creating simple interest
00:31 - calculating simple interest we are
00:42 - giving comment in Pinterest user
00:50 - important to use scanner class we have
00:58 - to write import statement at the top of
01:01 - the program import Java dot util dot
01:07 - scanner know we open the class complex
01:14 - simple interest static void no argument
01:28 - removing this let us give all the
01:34 - variables which we require in T time T
01:43 - both re integer type will double the
01:47 - rate of interest you may have decimal
01:49 - places so double R and then simply press
01:52 - which we are going to calculate simple
01:55 - int we can use next we need to create a
02:00 - object for the scanner class so scanner
02:06 - scanner the object name to be given here
02:09 - object name can be an identified so
02:12 - identifier me any name between offending
02:15 - the program so for example will you will
02:20 - be J OB is equal to new keyword vu and
02:24 - then scanner
02:25 - ah system dot we then we technique this
02:33 - you program should get input from user
02:36 - user should get a prompt for entering
02:40 - this system dot out dot print line off
02:49 - until be a mob now we have a method for
02:59 - each data type so we are going to assign
03:02 - that to a variable called T so P is
03:07 - equal to then object name which we have
03:10 - given we have to write here obj and then
03:13 - dot next we use and immediately after
03:17 - that without giving any space we have to
03:19 - write the data type first care letter in
03:22 - the capital empty and then open the
03:25 - bracket next and close the bracket next
03:27 - in bar saying like that we have to take
03:31 - input for other two variables we will
03:35 - copy and paste the statement it is about
03:37 - that then we will change this one as
03:42 - enter the time so here it is to the next
03:51 - on this going to be the rate of in test
04:02 - so as it is a greater interested
04:05 - w we say w that is these capital here
04:12 - and then this is going to be our so we
04:15 - have taken the input needle now we will
04:18 - calculate now so yes I xx is equal to P
04:28 - into R into P divided by 100 point zero
04:35 - I have given point 0 here because we are
04:38 - going to calculate that into interest at
04:40 - a double so it is better to give point 0
04:44 - here next we are going to print the
04:49 - result so come back dot print line of
05:03 - equal interest is equal to and then plus
05:07 - the interest what we have classes to the
05:09 - variables yes I am T so we are going to
05:13 - you
05:13 - yes int I will let us compile this or
05:19 - syntax error we will run this so you can
05:25 - enter the amount only 10,000 enter the
05:29 - time to years
05:30 - enter the rate of interest may be 7.5
05:35 - the simple interest calculator is
05:37 - thousand five hundred Thank You students
