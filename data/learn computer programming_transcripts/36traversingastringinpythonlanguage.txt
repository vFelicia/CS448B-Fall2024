00:08 - foreign
00:14 - in this class we will see traversing a
00:17 - stream
00:18 - traversing a string can be done using
00:20 - two different ways one is directly the
00:23 - sequence given in the for Loop otherwise
00:25 - we can also have the index numbers of a
00:27 - string let us see how this for Loop
00:30 - works
00:31 - for I in s t here I is the loop variable
00:35 - and St is the string sequence here for
00:38 - example I have taken STS Blackboard
00:42 - when the for Loop starts I becomes each
00:46 - character of the string
00:48 - here when the for Loop runs for first
00:51 - time I will take b as its value when for
00:55 - Loop runs for the second time it will
00:57 - take L similar way it will be traversing
01:00 - from the beginning to the end that is
01:03 - from left to right side when all the
01:06 - characters in The String get over
01:08 - automatically the for Loop stops so in
01:11 - the loop block we will be writing the
01:13 - code to manipulate the string or
01:16 - whatever is required we can also use the
01:19 - while loop for this but we will have to
01:22 - use index numbers of the string here is
01:25 - the example code for you
01:27 - index is equal to zero so this we
01:30 - initiate as every string start with its
01:34 - index number as 0 then we need a input
01:37 - for a string we will take the input from
01:39 - the user otherwise we can also directly
01:42 - initiate the variable with the string
01:45 - while index is lesser than line of
01:49 - string we know index is one lesser than
01:52 - the length of the string so when we are
01:54 - giving lesser than line of string
01:56 - automatically it stops at the end of the
02:00 - string character now we can write the
02:02 - needed code here for example I have
02:04 - written print statement to print the
02:07 - characters again it will be writing the
02:11 - first character here after that we need
02:13 - to increase the index numbers otherwise
02:15 - it will be staying like that for that
02:17 - purpose I write index plus equal to 1 it
02:20 - will be adding 1 to index number so that
02:22 - it keeps increasing it will work until
02:24 - the last character of the string now I
02:27 - will demonstrate sample programs using
02:30 - both of these I will take the user input
02:33 - for the string s t is equal to input of
02:38 - giving the prompt
02:40 - enter a string
02:44 - now for
02:46 - I in
02:48 - St let me simply print I
02:52 - print of I
02:54 - let us save this and run
02:58 - so I am giving laptop here
03:02 - so you could see that it has printed in
03:04 - next next lines as print statement
03:06 - creates a new line after every output
03:11 - now let me modify this program to print
03:16 - the string but after each character a
03:19 - symbol and in the same line so I am
03:22 - adding here
03:23 - Plus
03:25 - I want one symbol I just give here
03:27 - symbol AS dollar symbol and then I need
03:30 - that in the same line so I will be
03:33 - giving n equal to Mt string
03:37 - now let me check computer
03:42 - you could see that after every character
03:44 - there is a dollar symbol added to that
03:48 - now let me use the while loop
03:51 - we need an index for this
03:53 - I will give I and D is equal to 0
03:56 - and then while
03:59 - I and D is lesser than
04:02 - of St
04:04 - now to access the character of a string
04:07 - we need to refer index number
04:10 - with the string if I want to print each
04:13 - and every character I will give
04:15 - print off
04:17 - s t of IND
04:20 - after this we will have to give the
04:23 - index number to increase
04:26 - so I will give in plus equal to 1. now
04:30 - let me run this
04:34 - I give book here
04:38 - so you got the output we can also use
04:40 - range of function in for Loop
04:43 - I give for I in range this always starts
04:49 - from 0 until the last index of the
04:53 - string so we can initiate at 0 and then
04:56 - we can say Lin of St
05:00 - otherwise we can also give just line of
05:04 - St so it runs from 0 to the last index
05:07 - so now we in this case if I want to
05:09 - print I will be using S T of I so here I
05:15 - is the range from 0 to the last index
05:23 - here is the output
05:27 - so either you can use the Len function
05:30 - with the range otherwise we can directly
05:33 - give the sequence
05:34 - hope now it is very clear to you
05:37 - keep watching this channel keep learning
05:39 - keep sharing
05:41 - thank you
