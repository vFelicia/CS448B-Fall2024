00:00 - this is my first tutorial class I am
00:02 - going to tell you about opening bluej
00:05 - creating project as well as creating a
00:09 - program so after installing bluej click
00:14 - on browser icon browser gets opened so
00:21 - any class to be created must be inside
00:25 - the project so we have to create a
00:27 - project click on project new project so
00:32 - we get a dialog box where we can give
00:35 - the name of the project for example I am
00:38 - giving learner and then click on create
00:41 - so we get a prove the project here so
00:45 - you can see that learner heading here so
00:50 - to create a class click on new class or
00:53 - right click on the window anywhere and
00:56 - then click on new class you get a dialog
00:59 - box again make sure that class is
01:03 - selected by default class will be
01:05 - selected and then click OK
01:14 - so here you can see the icon this is the
01:18 - class program so to open it and edit the
01:22 - course double-click on it or right-click
01:25 - and open editor you can see already
01:29 - written course there which is the cell
01:32 - skeleton alpha code according to the
01:35 - name given to the class as a beginner we
01:39 - are not going to take all these codes so
01:42 - we just drill it all the codes and then
01:46 - we are going to start a program it is
01:49 - good practice to start a program with a
01:51 - comment line there are two types of
01:54 - comment lines given in Java program one
01:57 - is with double slash and other one is
02:02 - starting with slash and star many lines
02:06 - and then I mean it is going to end with
02:08 - star and slash so if only one line is
02:13 - been given then just we start us with a
02:16 - double slash after the double slash
02:19 - whatever is written is going to be a
02:23 - comment line which is not going to be
02:26 - executed or compiled when Java is going
02:32 - to compile the program so we start a
02:35 - command line say this is my first
02:41 - program bringing like always the program
02:49 - starts with class name class name is
02:52 - going to be a program name or any
02:54 - program name you wanted to do you must
02:57 - do that as a class name class we have
03:00 - already given the class name as my first
03:05 - program we can use the same name my
03:09 - first program RS if we give some other
03:15 - name YUM FP when it is going to compile
03:22 - it will take the new name and then world
03:25 - name is changed to the new name which is
03:27 - given it say the program and then we
03:30 - open a curly bracket class must have at
03:34 - least one method here we are going to
03:37 - learn a standard method called main
03:39 - method in the beginning of the learning
03:41 - just we can follow the course as given
03:45 - and then later we will come to know what
03:47 - are the words what are the keywords
03:49 - which is used for which purpose so now
03:53 - we are having a method for main method
03:56 - with public static void main of string
04:02 - of arguments so here we have keywords
04:07 - called public static void main
04:11 - so here mean is the name of the method
04:14 - and all these are keywords Java is
04:17 - case-sensitive so the keywords to be
04:21 - returned very carefully with that same
04:23 - spelling whether it is a perky
04:26 - our lawyer case so here the public
04:29 - static void all these three are with
04:32 - only lower cases in the string only yes
04:36 - is capital and then ours that is
04:39 - arguments all are with small arrests so
04:42 - you need with that we right we must have
04:45 - a block of quartz which is open with the
04:49 - curly bracket and then we are going to
04:51 - write the codes their actions there so
04:55 - we are going to just print one line so
04:58 - we are going to write a printing
05:00 - statement system dot out dot print line
05:07 - off then we terminate the action or a
05:12 - single statement which is to be
05:15 - terminated with the semicolon so this is
05:19 - going to create a new line so print
05:23 - lines are print we can give print line
05:25 - means after the output it is going to
05:27 - create a new line this is a empty
05:32 - statement when nothing is written to
05:35 - print so whatever to printer to be given
05:38 - inside the quotation we give here inside
05:41 - the quotation video hello welcome to
05:48 - Java and then we close the method here
05:56 - and then we close the class
05:59 - so this is going to be a first program
06:01 - let us compare this there is no syntax
06:09 - error so we close this window and then
06:11 - right click on this we run the method
06:14 - can't avoid me so there is no argument
06:18 - just click on ok so we get hello welcome
06:22 - to Java in the same program I would also
06:26 - like to tell you about print and print
06:29 - line the difference between print and
06:30 - print line so if we create one more line
06:35 - are print one more line here
06:50 - this was how I printed your line so when
06:58 - we don't give print line here in the
07:01 - first statement the output is going to
07:04 - be in the same line it is not going to
07:07 - be in a fresh line for the next
07:09 - statement this is the difference
07:12 - compiled no syntax error and close this
07:17 - right-click wide me so you can see hello
07:23 - welcome to Java this was how printer
07:25 - deadlines I hope you learnt the first
07:34 - program how it is created an executor
07:37 - Thank You students keep watching my
