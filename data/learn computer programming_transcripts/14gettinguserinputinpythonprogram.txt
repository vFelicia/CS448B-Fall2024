00:00 - hello everyone in this session we are
00:02 - going to see
00:03 - how to take input from the user if we
00:06 - talk about
00:07 - taking input there are various ways to
00:09 - take input
00:10 - the standard way is giving input through
00:13 - the
00:13 - keyboard if you see the graphical user
00:16 - interface then we will be having
00:17 - mouse pointer to click on the icons here
00:20 - we are going to see
00:22 - only the standard input method
00:25 - input is a value provided to the system
00:28 - by the user
00:29 - python has input of function to get the
00:33 - input from the user
00:34 - here is the syntax for that input
00:37 - and then you can give the argument
00:39 - inside as a string
00:41 - that is to prompt the user what to be
00:44 - given
00:44 - for example we can have like this a
00:47 - variable is equal to
00:49 - input of then enter your name so that
00:52 - means
00:52 - whatever you enter the name it will be
00:55 - referenced
00:55 - through n let me demonstrate using the
00:59 - ideally let me create the new file
01:02 - so new file is here example program
01:06 - to
01:09 - take the input from the user so if i
01:12 - want to take the input from the user
01:14 - i will have one reference to put it in
01:16 - that is a variable so for example i give
01:18 - name
01:19 - is equal to input so this will take the
01:23 - input
01:25 - but we won't have anything to mention to
01:28 - the user so they will have a blank
01:30 - screen
01:31 - just let me show here print
01:35 - name i say okay so that means it is
01:37 - going to take the input and then print
01:40 - i just save this on the desktop saying
01:43 - test 2 or maybe i overwrite this
01:49 - let me run this but user does not know
01:52 - what to do that blank screen has come
01:55 - but i will be knowing that i am a
01:57 - programmer here so i give here my name
01:59 - is jiva
02:00 - so it printed again to prompt the user
02:04 - we can use
02:05 - argument that is a string argument so
02:07 - that means i am here
02:08 - writing
02:12 - enter your name and then i
02:15 - give one colon and one space to
02:16 - bifurcate that
02:18 - so it looks good so here also i will use
02:21 - a reference
02:22 - line your name
02:25 - is and then one comma here
02:29 - right so now i run this
02:32 - you can see enter your name i say jiva
02:35 - so it says
02:36 - your name is jiva when you are using
02:38 - input off
02:40 - anything given there as a input will be
02:42 - taken as a string
02:44 - in case if you need as a value what
02:46 - shall we do
02:47 - we already know how to change the data
02:49 - type right one data type to another data
02:52 - type
02:52 - if you are not aware of that you can
02:53 - please go to my previous video and learn
02:56 - the conversion of data type i am using
02:58 - here integer of
02:59 - okay int off the string whatever is
03:02 - given so the value
03:04 - given by the user will be converted into
03:06 - integer so you will give here as a
03:08 - reference
03:09 - you your age for example
03:14 - is in numeric
03:21 - so ages i also will change the variable
03:25 - which gives a right meaning for it so
03:27 - just i say
03:28 - a so now i run this
03:34 - so enter your age in numeric i say 15
03:38 - so your age is 50 okay so how do we know
03:41 - whether it has been converted into
03:42 - integer
03:45 - just for an example i can just add with
03:47 - this one
03:48 - here your age after
03:52 - your birthday is
03:55 - the next age right
03:58 - so now i say 16 it says 17
04:01 - so that means it is added so it is no
04:04 - longer a string it has been converted to
04:06 - integer using this
04:07 - function so in case i need as a float
04:10 - number
04:11 - and then i can change it here as float
04:15 - and then instead of age i say enter your
04:18 - percentage
04:23 - of marks so here your percentage
04:32 - so whatever it is maybe a again
04:36 - so if i give 95.6
04:40 - so it takes right now i will tell you
04:43 - one more thing
04:45 - see if i need multiple inputs say for
04:48 - example
04:48 - a comma b comma c
04:53 - is equal to you can also give 3 comma 4
04:56 - comma
04:57 - 6 like this so that means it will accept
05:01 - a as 3 b as 4 and c as 6.
05:04 - so let me just print and show you c
05:08 - so i take away this reference from here
05:12 - then it will be printing here so i am
05:14 - not taking any input for now
05:16 - i make this as comment line so it will
05:19 - not take it
05:20 - as a programming code so now just i give
05:23 - here
05:25 - so you can see that 3 4 6 is taken as
05:28 - input okay similarly what we can do here
05:31 - if you want many inputs like this we can
05:34 - also give many inputs
05:36 - here say for example
05:40 - a comma b only let me give
05:43 - enter two numbers
05:49 - separated by space two numbers
05:52 - separated by space
05:56 - okay so if i take like this
05:59 - i need to split that into two different
06:02 - words so i will be using dot split off
06:06 - okay you will be learning this when you
06:08 - are learning the string
06:09 - but however we are using for input so
06:12 - you can remember this dot split
06:14 - will split the input whatever is given
06:18 - there
06:18 - that means string dot split off so there
06:21 - are only two
06:25 - i may add this and print
06:29 - i give a reference here sum is equal to
06:34 - okay so a plus b
06:37 - see this float will not be
06:41 - working with this now so i take away
06:44 - this
06:46 - i will take as a input so as a string
06:50 - later i can convert this
06:54 - after splitting it i can have int off
06:56 - here
06:58 - into a
07:01 - similarly in top b
07:06 - so i run this now
07:10 - 25 space 100
07:13 - so you can see that has been converted
07:16 - into integer and then
07:17 - it is added so similarly way we can take
07:21 - many inputs like this on single
07:23 - statement
07:25 - in case the string and values are mixed
07:29 - doesn't matter you can also take like
07:31 - this you can take
07:32 - name here age
07:36 - okay and then i split this
07:42 - name as here name okay so
07:45 - i just print here name and then next if
07:48 - i want to print
07:50 - so i can put it in the next line
07:59 - your age after your birthday
08:04 - is i say here comma
08:08 - age plus 1 here only i will
08:12 - make this as integer so i take
08:15 - sorry
08:18 - i take as a string but
08:22 - i convert this as integer
08:25 - the name i don't need to convert as
08:27 - right so that is a string itself so let
08:29 - me keep like that
08:30 - so you can use multiple input in single
08:33 - statement like this
08:37 - so i say here my name is jiva
08:41 - and then one space my age is
08:45 - 15.
08:49 - okay there was n comma so that come also
08:51 - has appeared there
08:53 - it was extra we will do a
08:56 - small program where we take two inputs
09:00 - from the user and perform all the
09:01 - arithmetic operators so i will be
09:04 - changing this
09:06 - program to perform
09:10 - all the artifactic
09:14 - operations by using
09:18 - user input okay so i will be taking two
09:22 - input here
09:23 - say a comma b so
09:26 - i will be asking to split it
09:31 - i say a is equal to integer of
09:35 - a and then b b is equal to
09:39 - integer of b if you don't like
09:43 - this way like this i will have here
09:47 - integer of directly i take
09:50 - convert to integer now so now i will
09:53 - have only
09:55 - yes value and then for these values
09:57 - similarly i will have the same statement
10:00 - but
10:00 - saying b
10:06 - so b is equal to integer input okay so
10:09 - we can say
10:10 - enter a number
10:14 - and then here enter the second number
10:21 - okay so now i say print
10:26 - sum is equal to
10:30 - comma a plus b
10:33 - okay so i will make many statement of
10:36 - this
10:45 - so i make this this is a difference
10:54 - difference i say here product
10:58 - and then i give here as multiplication
11:00 - symbol
11:02 - here i make this as quotient
11:07 - so i will be giving here division symbol
11:11 - and then here i make reminder
11:18 - i will be saying here percentage symbol
11:22 - and then even i need one more there is
11:25 - power right
11:27 - so using power i can say 2 star
11:33 - so what i can say a raise to the power b
11:42 - right so all we can just perform like
11:46 - this if you want you can also take this
11:49 - as a float number
11:51 - so let me make both as float number
11:57 - so there are two equal to mark
12:01 - so that was an error so
12:04 - now you can see enter a number 10.5
12:09 - second number maybe 2 iq
12:13 - you can see some difference product
12:17 - quotient remainder and then a raise to
12:20 - the power b
12:21 - i hope this is very clear to you
12:24 - keep watching my channel and learn thank
12:28 - you
