00:02 - welcome back students today we are going
00:05 - to see math functions in Java we know
00:09 - how to solve a simple mathematical
00:11 - expression using variables constant and
00:15 - operators but to solve mathematical
00:19 - expressions with powers square roots etc
00:23 - we need some special functions Java
00:27 - provides math class with many
00:30 - mathematical functions this math
00:32 - function is available in java dot Lang
00:35 - package you know land packages default
00:39 - package which we don't need to import
00:42 - let us see the math functions available
00:45 - in java syntax of math function is like
00:50 - this math dot that is a machine capital
00:54 - dot function name the name of the
00:56 - function available in Java then in the
01:00 - bracket we give the argument list
01:02 - otherwise a single argument to find the
01:04 - power of any number we have P whoa W of
01:09 - X comma Y so X and Y is arguments here Y
01:14 - is raised to the power X so for example
01:17 - we may have math dot P whoa W of 5 comma
01:22 - 2 25.0 most of the math functions return
01:27 - double pipe output next we have SQ RT of
01:32 - any argument this will give the square
01:35 - root of a number
01:37 - example here math dot s qrp of 36 this
01:43 - will return six point zero next we have
01:47 - seal of a number this method helps to
01:53 - round up the decimal number to a integer
01:57 - value but gives the output as double
02:01 - value for example we have three hundred
02:05 - twelve point three four
02:06 - this will round to the next higher value
02:10 - of integer maybe here
02:13 - our 3r8 whatever it is that is lesser
02:16 - than five or more than five that doesn't
02:19 - matter
02:19 - this will round up so we will have 313
02:25 - as the output next we have floor of a
02:28 - number this will round down a decimal
02:32 - number though the decimal point has five
02:37 - or more than that it will not consider
02:40 - it will only round out so that means the
02:43 - decimal number completely left and then
02:45 - it becomes only 45 here another one we
02:50 - have here rent of the number this will
02:54 - round as per mathematical rule so here
03:01 - we have ninety one point five six if it
03:03 - is five or more than 5 it will round up
03:06 - otherwise we will round down so here as
03:11 - per mathematical rule we have 92 as
03:14 - output next we have ABS of X so this is
03:19 - the absolute value absolute value is the
03:23 - position of a number either left side or
03:27 - right side of the zero in the number
03:30 - line for example if we have a number
03:33 - line like this zero is in middle right
03:37 - side we will have all positive numbers
03:39 - in left side or negative numbers if we
03:43 - take minus three as a number absolute
03:46 - value of this is three that is counter
03:49 - only the position of the number it
03:53 - doesn't matter whether in negative side
03:55 - or positive side so absolute value of
03:58 - minus three becomes three in mathematics
04:01 - we have two vertical lines like this to
04:05 - mention the absolute value if we take
04:07 - one then we will have absolute value of
04:10 - 1 is 1 itself this function will help us
04:15 - to convert negative value into positive
04:19 - value for example if we have minus 72
04:25 - point three this will
04:26 - become seventy two point three next we
04:30 - have Mei X of two arguments here this
04:33 - will return the greater value of the
04:37 - given two number for example we have
04:40 - five point six and seven point two the
04:43 - greater values seven point two this get
04:46 - returned next we have my enough two
04:50 - arguments this will return the smaller
04:54 - value here this will return eight point
04:58 - two six
05:00 - next we have exp of X this will give the
05:04 - result of X raised to the power e for
05:10 - example we have math dot exp of five
05:15 - next we have log of X this will give
05:19 - large epidemic value of X next we have
05:27 - sine of X this will return sine value of
05:31 - x and then cos cos value of x and then
05:37 - tan tan value of x next we have random
05:43 - off this will not take any argument but
05:47 - it will return any random number with
05:50 - double type now let us test these
05:53 - mathematical functions through a program
05:59 - program to test map functions import
06:08 - Java dot IO dot star plus math class
06:31 - let us declare the variables we should
06:58 - have throws ioexception prompting the
07:08 - user a is equal to 2 double dot parse
07:30 - double of BR dot readline off let me
07:38 - copy these two lines power here it is B
07:49 - so let me have one more variable called
07:54 - just C so we are going to do C is equal
07:58 - to math dot P whoa W of a commodity let
08:07 - us print this
08:15 - simply give power plus that is C let me
08:22 - also have the square root without
08:25 - variable directly let me print so that
08:41 - is directly I am going to write the
08:43 - function here math dot s QR t off let me
08:49 - have a itself compile this enter the
09:00 - base say 25 to the power 2 so 25 to the
09:08 - power 2 is 625 square root of 25 is 5
09:17 - now let us write the code to round off
09:20 - the numbers enter decimal number so here
09:31 - a is going to be a decimal number let me
09:36 - remove this let me remove this also now
09:41 - b is equal to math dot seal of a then C
09:54 - is equal to math dot floor half a then
10:04 - let me have one more value this B D is
10:11 - equal to math dot print off here so I
10:21 - will have here 3 printing statements
10:26 - first we'll print this is SIL so up this
10:35 - roundup so what it will print it is B
10:42 - then here rounded down this C as per
10:57 - mathematical rules just D so let me
11:13 - compile this
11:19 - I am giving him five point six now when
11:26 - it rounds using seal function it will
11:29 - round up so six point zero if it is
11:33 - floor function though it is more than
11:36 - 0.5 it will round to the down value that
11:40 - is 5 will remain this is neglected as
11:44 - per mathematics as this is more than 0.5
11:49 - it will round up that will become 6 let
11:53 - us have one more example with lesser
11:55 - decimal place I give here no 8.03 see
12:06 - round up though it is 0.03 it is going
12:09 - to the next higher value round down is 8
12:12 - as per mathematical role it is 8 now let
12:19 - us test for maximum and minimum function
12:22 - we need to input so let us take from the
12:25 - user this will be B math dot Mac cinema
12:37 - ma X of a comma B then here minimum or a
12:45 - Mayan of a comma D so here let us have
12:51 - maximum that is C minimum of given 2 is
13:04 - B here let us also have the absolute
13:08 - value here so absolute value of let us
13:18 - have B math dot a BS of B so we will do
13:31 - negative value for B to point 3 to
13:44 - another number 4 sorry minus 4 point 1
13:50 - so maximum is 2 point 3 2 so this is
13:54 - positive number this is negative number
13:56 - so this is lesser than this minimum is
14:00 - minus 4 point 1 the absolute value of B
14:03 - is 4 point 1 so this negative value
14:06 - converted into positive value with this
14:13 - let us also create a random number
14:16 - Double R is equal to math dot random off
14:27 - system dot out dot print line off I'll
14:35 - just compile this see it written the
14:50 - greater number the smaller number
14:52 - absolute value of 60 3.0 and 63 itself
14:56 - so this is the second number we have
14:58 - taken for absolute value and then random
15:01 - number is created dear students I hope
15:06 - this is very clear to you how to use
15:09 - math functions in Java program next
15:12 - video tutorial I will teach you how to
15:15 - write Java statements to given
15:18 - mathematical expressions until then
15:21 - thank you students
