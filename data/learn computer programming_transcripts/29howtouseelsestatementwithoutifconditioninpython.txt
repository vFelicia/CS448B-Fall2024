00:00 - [Music]
00:14 - hello everyone welcome back in this
00:16 - class we are going to discuss about loop
00:19 - else statement in python
00:23 - python allows the else block associated
00:26 - with the loop
00:30 - the else block gets executed only when
00:33 - the loop completes all the iterations
00:36 - that is when exits normally and not when
00:39 - gets terminated by the break statement
00:42 - the general format is here
00:45 - for loop
00:46 - for variable in sequence
00:48 - statement 1
00:50 - statement 2 and then else block for
00:54 - for loop
00:55 - if you see here the indentation is same
00:58 - as
00:59 - where the far starts
01:01 - here again the statements 3 and 4
01:04 - outside the for loop if any statements
01:06 - to be given it can also be given
01:10 - similar way even in the while loop
01:12 - while condition
01:14 - statement 1 statement 2
01:16 - and then else block the indentation is
01:18 - again same as while and then
01:20 - statement 3 and 4 are there statement 5
01:23 - is outside the while loop let us
01:26 - understand
01:27 - these by some example programs
01:32 - for
01:33 - i in range
01:35 - simply i give 1 comma 10
01:41 - print i
01:43 - now else statement for this for loop
01:46 - the indentation is same as
01:48 - for so i go back and then else
01:51 - i just print a statement again print
01:55 - i comma
01:58 - is the last value of
02:01 - i
02:05 - let me execute this
02:08 - so you could see after printing 1 to 9
02:11 - the else statement is executed it
02:14 - printed 9 is the value of i
02:19 - now let me show you if the break
02:22 - statement is given
02:24 - and then this else part will not be
02:26 - executed
02:27 - so i introduce the else statement with
02:30 - some condition here
02:34 - if imod
02:37 - 5
02:38 - is equal to 0
02:42 - then i say break
02:44 - when it comes 5 the condition is true
02:46 - and then it breaks
02:48 - so the else statement will not get
02:50 - executed at that time
02:53 - you could see here
02:56 - now let me change this value instead of
02:58 - 5 i give 11
03:01 - the number which is greater than the
03:04 - range value
03:05 - so this condition is not met true for
03:08 - even a single time
03:11 - then the loop will be getting terminated
03:13 - normally
03:14 - then the else part will be executed let
03:17 - us check this
03:19 - so you could see again
03:21 - when the break statement is present but
03:23 - still it is not meeting the condition
03:26 - required
03:27 - the else part is executed
03:32 - us also execute the while loop program
03:40 - i initialize
03:41 - x is equal to 1
03:44 - while
03:45 - now i give x is lesser than six
03:48 - print x
03:49 - then i need to increment this x
03:52 - plus equal to one
03:55 - now else part for
03:57 - while
03:59 - else
04:01 - print
04:03 - x comma
04:06 - is the last value of x
04:16 - so it printed as it is and then
04:19 - the else part is executed
04:22 - now again when i give the break
04:24 - statement here
04:27 - if
04:28 - x
04:29 - mod 3 equal to 0 i q
04:33 - then i break this now let us check
04:38 - so 1 2 3 and then the else part is not
04:41 - executed
04:43 - similar way if i increase the number
04:45 - which is greater than
04:47 - 6 or even equal to 6
04:51 - the loop get terminated normally not
04:54 - with the break statement so the else
04:56 - part will get executed
04:58 - you could see it
05:00 - hope the concept is clear
05:03 - keep watching my channel keep learning
05:07 - thank you
