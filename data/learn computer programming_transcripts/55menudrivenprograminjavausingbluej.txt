00:00 - welcome back students in this video
00:03 - lesson we will learn menu-driven program
00:05 - before going to a program we will learn
00:08 - the algorithm of menu-driven program the
00:12 - list of tasks are displayed as menu for
00:15 - the user using printing statements so we
00:18 - will simply print the tasks then user
00:22 - will to whichever tasks to be performed
00:28 - then programming codes are written to
00:30 - perform all the tasks using selection
00:33 - statement to match the options given
00:36 - here we can use switch case statement
00:38 - our if else statement that depends on
00:41 - the question given when given choices
00:44 - matched with the option for the task
00:47 - that particular task will be performed
00:49 - in case user gives a wrong choice then
00:52 - appropriate messages displayed using
00:55 - printing statement so if it is switch
00:58 - case we are using then it will be in
01:00 - default otherwise in else part we will
01:04 - create a menu driven program for two
01:07 - tasks that is to find the factorial of
01:11 - given number the other one is to accept
01:14 - a number and print its factors so it
01:18 - should print appropriate message for
01:19 - rung input given by the user let us go
01:22 - to the program and create a class called
01:27 - me know
01:34 - to take the input from the user
01:37 - I will import scanner class so import
01:41 - Java dot util dot scanner class you know
02:03 - we will declare the variables for choice
02:06 - we need integer variable so int C hits I
02:10 - you for choice and then we are going to
02:14 - find the factorial and factors of given
02:17 - number so we need a number to take so
02:20 - for that I will give n as the variable
02:24 - to use in a loop I will you I now let us
02:29 - create object for scanner class now we
02:42 - are going to print all the Minho's
02:44 - available here so let us print so I am
02:52 - just giving menu and in the new line it
02:59 - will print option oneness to find
03:06 - factorial and then again in new line 2
03:14 - will be to find factors and also we will
03:23 - say enter your choice
03:42 - now we will take the input from the user
03:45 - that is we have given as charge HC h is
03:49 - equal to SC dot next int R after taking
03:56 - the choice from the user we have to take
03:59 - a decision to which tries to be executed
04:03 - for that we will use switch case here so
04:07 - switch then that will be choice here
04:14 - if user enters 1 and then we will give
04:18 - case 1 for that the program code for
04:22 - finding the factorial of that number
04:25 - here we need one more variable count
04:27 - there for factorial we will take so in F
04:32 - is equal to 1 we will initialize now we
04:36 - should take the input from the user for
04:38 - the number which factorial is required
04:41 - for that we will give system dot out dot
04:45 - print line off you can say enter the
04:55 - number to find factorial so we can you
05:04 - just print here we have already declared
05:09 - Sen so n is equal to the C dot next int
05:16 - off we already learnt how to find
05:19 - factorial in previous program we have to
05:24 - use far loop so far I is equal to 2 I is
05:31 - lesser than or equal to n so up to n
05:35 - equal to 2 then I plus plus
05:42 - so here you have two is equal to your
05:45 - intro I so this will find the factorial
05:50 - now we will print the factorial n is the
06:02 - given number plus we will write the
06:05 - factorial symbol here and then also
06:07 - equal to then plus F let us have one
06:13 - more space here then after this we will
06:17 - write break statement
06:20 - if you forget break and then case two
06:23 - also will get executed so we should not
06:25 - forget break now I will write case two
06:30 - for the second choice case we need a
06:36 - user input for find the factors of a
06:39 - number so I will just copy this and
06:40 - paste here then later this I will write
06:47 - a code to get the factors of the number
06:50 - if given number is divisible by your
06:53 - number and then the divisor is called a
06:57 - factor including one and the number
07:01 - itself are factors to print all the
07:04 - factors we will give the farlow and find
07:07 - whether the number is divisible are not
07:10 - so I starts from one is lesser than or
07:15 - equal to n then I plus plus if n more I
07:26 - is equal to zero it is a factor so we
07:31 - will print the factor so we will give
07:34 - system dot out dot print line of so I
07:42 - plus one comma V will you can also add
07:46 - one sentence here
07:54 - factors are factors of plus R Union so
08:02 - that is the N number given R so it will
08:09 - print factor sir and then the same line
08:11 - it will print so in same things I take
08:14 - this Yellin now we will break this now
08:23 - we should not forget to you the default
08:24 - statement
08:36 - we William from invalid input so here we
08:46 - copied both our factorial let us change
08:48 - this enter the number to find factors
08:55 - let us compile this so enter your eyes I
09:05 - enter s1 enter then number to find
09:10 - factorial we know 120 is 4 5 so I give 5
09:14 - the answer is right now let me check for
09:19 - the second case I am giving 2 as the
09:24 - input so factors now I say 21 so factors
09:30 - of 20 or not it is given now let us also
09:33 - check by giving invalid choice thank you
09:39 - 5 for example so invalid input it says
09:43 - always we can expect one menu-driven
09:46 - program for the board examination the
09:51 - task given may be different but most
09:53 - probably there will be one menu-driven
09:56 - program students I hope this would have
10:00 - been very useful for you to learn
10:01 - menu-driven program keep watching my
10:04 - channel
10:05 - learn well thank you students
