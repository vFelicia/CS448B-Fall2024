00:01 - hello everyone
00:03 - welcome back
00:05 - in this video class we are going to see
00:08 - how to
00:10 - install
00:11 - connectivity program
00:13 - when we are using python to work with
00:16 - mysql
00:18 - we need to import a module called
00:20 - mysql.connector
00:22 - if we need to use that mysql.connector
00:26 - we need to install a small file even we
00:29 - can also use pi mysql module even for
00:33 - that we need a installation we will see
00:36 - how to do that
00:38 - click on start
00:40 - type command
00:49 - now
00:50 - before running this command make sure
00:53 - that
00:54 - computer is connected to the network
00:57 - type
00:58 - python minus m pip install
01:03 - minus minus upgrade
01:06 - then pip
01:10 - then press enter
01:17 - this is to upgrade the pip installation
01:21 - before installing the connectivity we
01:23 - need to upgrade this otherwise it may
01:26 - show error after installing the
01:28 - connectivity program
01:31 - so now we will install the connectivity
01:33 - program
01:35 - pip install
01:38 - mysql minus connector
01:43 - minus python
01:46 - after typing this
01:49 - press enter button
01:56 - so now
01:57 - mysql python connectivity program is
02:00 - ready if you want to install pi mysql
02:04 - even that needs the pip installation for
02:07 - that
02:09 - pip install
02:11 - pi mysql
02:14 - then press enter
02:16 - so even
02:18 - this is done successfully either you can
02:20 - use
02:21 - pi mysql or
02:24 - mysql connector
02:25 - to connect the python program with the
02:28 - mysql
02:30 - and then execute the program let us just
02:32 - check
02:33 - giving mysql dot connector in the python
02:35 - ideally whether it shows any error or
02:37 - not
02:41 - i type here
02:42 - import mysql dot connector
02:46 - and then i run this
02:48 - there is no error so that means the
02:49 - installation is complete and then it
02:51 - works well
02:52 - similar way i can also give here
02:55 - pi mysql and check
03:00 - so this also works without any error so
03:03 - the installation is successful
03:06 - we can do the program connecting both
03:08 - mysql and python once we learnt some
03:11 - amount of mysql queries and then we will
03:14 - come back to do the program and then
03:17 - connect the mysql through the python
03:19 - let us meet in the next class
03:22 - until then bye
03:24 - thank you
