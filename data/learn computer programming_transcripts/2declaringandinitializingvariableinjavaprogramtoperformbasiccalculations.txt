00:00 - hello students today we are going to see
00:04 - how to use variable in a program we
00:08 - create a
00:10 - Class C as a name of the program double
00:14 - click on this control a delete write a
00:18 - comment about this program
00:21 - using variables so we create a class
00:25 - class
00:27 - space c
00:31 - then we must write
00:32 - a method which is main
00:35 - method
00:37 - public static y name of string of
00:43 - arguments then we open it so before
00:47 - using variables I would like to say
00:51 - about the variables and data types a
00:55 - variable is a location in the memory
00:58 - which will have the name for it data
01:02 - types are storage format the size of the
01:06 - variable are determined by the data
01:09 - types there are two types of data types
01:14 - that is primitive data type and
01:16 - reference data type primitive data types
01:20 - are classified into four groups first
01:23 - one is integer data types that is bite
01:27 - short int and long the next one is real
01:31 - data types or decimal data types which
01:35 - are float and double third one is
01:39 - character data type which can store a
01:42 - character in it and Boolean is one more
01:47 - data type which can store true or false
01:50 - in it generally we use int data type for
01:55 - integer and double data type for decimal
01:59 - point points before we use a variable in
02:02 - Java we need to declare it to declare a
02:05 - variable we need to type the data type
02:09 - as I said for example int so this is the
02:12 - data type and then name of the variable
02:14 - so we give one space and the variable we
02:17 - say for example a and then we terminate
02:21 - it so here we have declared a variable
02:24 - called a so if we wanted to do some
02:28 - operations we may need
02:30 - one more variable or few more variables
02:33 - as we do a calculation we'll see a
02:37 - program to add two numbers and print the
02:40 - sum so we need one more variable called
02:44 - in
02:45 - B and then to store the value one more
02:51 - variable called C in
02:55 - C in case of same data types we don't
02:59 - need to declare in different statements
03:02 - we can do like this a comma B comma C
03:05 - and then we terminate so I cancel these
03:08 - two so we have declared now three
03:11 - variables called A B and C where we are
03:14 - going to assign a value for a so there
03:17 - we use the operator called assignment
03:20 - operator so a is equal
03:23 - to
03:26 - 10 and then B is equal to 12 so these
03:31 - two values are stored C is going to be
03:35 - means the sum of two A + B so here A and
03:41 - B are called operant and then the plus
03:45 - symbol is operator there are five
03:48 - mathematical operators one is plus that
03:52 - is addition minus it is subtraction the
03:55 - star symbol which is multiplication and
03:57 - the slash symbol which is Division and
04:00 - then one more symbol which is having the
04:03 - percentage symbol so this is used to get
04:06 - the remainder after dividing a number
04:11 - now we have calculate the value for C
04:14 - and then stored in variable called C if
04:18 - we wanted to see the result we have to
04:20 - print it otherwise it will be in memory
04:22 - it will it won't display anything so we
04:25 - write a output
04:27 - statement system do out do print line
04:32 - off and then what to be printed inside
04:35 - the brackets so we print C let us
04:39 - compile
04:41 - this there is no synx close this and
04:45 - then
04:48 - run so it shows 22 as the answer see it
04:52 - shows just 22 if we want a reference
04:56 - line with it we can also print before
04:59 - this we we can do it system do out
05:07 - do print line
05:10 - off so which is a reference line will be
05:14 - inside the double quotation sum is equal
05:18 - to so it is going to give sum is equal
05:21 - to and then the total if there is a
05:25 - print line the next value will be in the
05:28 - fresh line so we
05:30 - take off this print compile
05:38 - this so now we can see sum is equal to
05:41 - 22 instead of writing in two different
05:44 - lines we can
05:45 - also uh save the space and time by
05:49 - giving plus symbol here and then C so
05:52 - that means in single printing statement
05:55 - we have given two things to print which
05:58 - is uh constant which is a string uh
06:02 - which has no value whatever is in the
06:04 - quotation going to be print that and
06:06 - then the value which is calculator C so
06:10 - these two are concat by using plus
06:14 - symbol so that is adding both the
06:16 - outputs in a single printing statement
06:19 - so we don't need to give the second like
06:24 - here no syntax again it is going to be
06:27 - the same type of
06:33 - outut now I will uh show you how to use
06:39 - the variable which is having decimal
06:41 - places which is having decimal places
06:43 - nothing but we give us
06:46 - double double and then all these a B and
06:49 - C are going to be double though we give
06:52 - us integer value it will automatically
06:54 - convert into double saying 10.0
06:57 - otherwise we can also give 10
07:00 - .2 2 1 B is equal
07:04 - to
07:08 - 13.89 so now C is going to be the answer
07:12 - and then it is going to print
07:19 - C you could see the result now we will
07:23 - see how to store the value of character
07:26 - so nothing here we are going to give
07:29 - character data type care and then
07:33 - character CH generally we use CH or C
07:37 - whatever is so that is CH is the name of
07:40 - the variable so what we are going to
07:43 - store there in CHS CH is equal to inside
07:48 - the single quotation value any value as
07:51 - a character so that you should know so
07:56 - for number value we are not going to
07:58 - give in ins the quotation character
08:01 - value we are giving inside the single
08:04 - quotation so for example f f is a
08:08 - character so it is going to store so we
08:11 - are going to just modify this program to
08:13 - print
08:15 - the result of
08:17 - this CH so we are going to the character
08:21 - event
08:23 - is character
08:27 - is so that is ch
08:31 - ch
08:37 - compile so character is
08:44 - f Boolean data type stores only two or
08:48 - false so we can give the data type here
08:55 - Boolean Boolean maybe any number X so
09:00 - what it is going to store it can store
09:03 - uh value true or false so X is equal to
09:07 - how do we assign X is equal to true so
09:10 - if we say to
09:12 - print X it will say true so we terminate
09:17 - this and
09:22 - then it is just I have given for an
09:25 - example it is
09:28 - compile
09:32 - it is
09:36 - true thank you students for watching my
09:39 - second session we will meet you in third
09:42 - session thank
09:45 - you
