00:09 - hey
00:25 - hello everyone welcome back
00:28 - in this class we are going to learn
00:30 - date functions of mysql to get the date
00:34 - from the
00:35 - system we are having
00:37 - three functions
00:39 - current date of
00:42 - current underscore date of
00:45 - current underscore date
00:47 - all these three will give the
00:50 - date in the form
00:52 - yyyy mm and dd
00:56 - if only time is required to be displayed
00:59 - we are having two functions
01:02 - current underscore time of
01:05 - our
01:06 - current time off
01:08 - in case
01:10 - the combination of date and time both if
01:13 - we need
01:15 - and then we are having the function for
01:17 - it
01:18 - sys date of
01:21 - we can also use now off
01:23 - otherwise the third one current
01:26 - underscore time stamp of
01:29 - all these three will give the date and
01:32 - time both together
01:34 - sometimes we may need to get only the
01:37 - name of the day or
01:39 - name of the month that is in the words
01:43 - in that case we can give day name of
01:47 - the particular date
01:48 - this will extract the
01:51 - name of the
01:52 - day that is
01:54 - sunday wednesday like that
01:57 - similar way if we need month to be
01:59 - extracted from the date we can give
02:01 - month name of
02:03 - date let us execute all these and
02:05 - understand the output
02:15 - first let us take the
02:16 - date function
02:19 - we are having the function called
02:21 - cur data
02:23 - see anything we want to display
02:26 - we need to combine with select statement
02:29 - in mysql so we give select card data
02:32 - then this will display the current date
02:35 - from the system
02:37 - similar way
02:38 - select
02:42 - current underscore data
02:45 - also will give the same result
02:48 - the next one we are having
02:50 - select
02:53 - current underscore date
02:55 - it is same as the previous one but
02:57 - without parenthesis this also will give
03:00 - the same result
03:02 - if we need to display the time we can
03:04 - have
03:06 - select
03:07 - current underscore
03:10 - time off
03:11 - so this will give the time
03:15 - similar way
03:17 - select
03:19 - current time off
03:21 - also will give the
03:23 - same output
03:25 - now let us get date and time together
03:28 - for that we are having
03:30 - system date so that is select
03:33 - sys
03:34 - d8e off
03:37 - you can see here
03:38 - today's date and time both together has
03:41 - come
03:43 - similar way we can also give select now
03:46 - off
03:47 - it is very easy to understand which is
03:50 - now
03:51 - this also gives the same output
03:55 - we can also give
03:57 - current underscore
03:59 - time stamp of
04:02 - this also will result the same
04:05 - to get the name of the day
04:08 - we can use day name
04:10 - that is
04:11 - select
04:13 - day name of
04:14 - we need to give the argument here as
04:17 - date
04:18 - we can also take the current date so cur
04:23 - data
04:28 - so you can see
04:29 - saturday
04:32 - similar way
04:34 - if we need to take the month name
04:36 - we can give
04:37 - month name of
04:46 - we can also give any date here
04:49 - for example
04:51 - i am giving here
04:53 - 2002
04:57 - 0 3
05:00 - 0 6
05:01 - see third month i give it is march
05:03 - similar way if we need to know the
05:06 - day of this date
05:08 - we can give
05:11 - day
05:14 - sorry there is an error
05:17 - so we are getting witnessed let us see
05:19 - few more functions
05:22 - to display only the
05:24 - date
05:25 - month or year
05:27 - any one of this you want to extract from
05:29 - the given date
05:31 - accordingly we can use the methods
05:34 - year of the date it will extract only
05:38 - the year from the given date similarly
05:41 - month of date and then day of
05:44 - date
05:46 - if you want to count the
05:48 - day of year or month or week
05:52 - we are having
05:53 - functions for that also
05:56 - day of year that means
05:58 - in a year in which day it is it will
06:01 - count that day and display it
06:04 - similar way
06:06 - day of month also will be
06:08 - displaying the count of the
06:11 - day in a month but it is nothing but
06:14 - date
06:15 - if we give day of week of date
06:18 - it will display in which day we are off
06:21 - in that particular week
06:23 - if you want to count in which week we
06:26 - are in the
06:27 - particular year we can use
06:30 - week of date
06:32 - come let us execute and check
06:35 - to get the year of the date
06:38 - select
06:40 - year of
06:41 - let us take the current dates here so
06:44 - that means 2022 will be
06:47 - the answer
06:49 - card data so it extracts the current
06:51 - date and then from that only the year it
06:53 - takes
06:55 - you can see the result
06:57 - similar way
06:59 - we can also have month
07:05 - let us change instead of current date
07:07 - let us give a date
07:09 - 20 21 0 6 0 1 6 month so 6 will be the
07:13 - answer
07:14 - let me have the day here
07:20 - day of current date
07:23 - so it is 27th
07:27 - get the count
07:29 - select day of year
07:32 - let me give current date itself
07:36 - current date of
07:38 - underscore data right
07:42 - so today is 86th day of the year
07:46 - similar way
07:49 - day of month it will give the date
07:51 - itself
07:54 - 27
08:00 - if you want to get
08:02 - a day of that week
08:05 - today is sunday so it will be showing
08:07 - one
08:10 - now let me count the week
08:14 - select
08:16 - week of
08:17 - current date
08:19 - or we can also use
08:21 - timestamp
08:23 - so current underscore timestamp
08:29 - today lies in 13th week of the year
08:36 - i hope the concept is clear now
08:38 - here is the summary for you
08:56 - keep watching this channel
08:58 - keep learning
09:08 - thank you
