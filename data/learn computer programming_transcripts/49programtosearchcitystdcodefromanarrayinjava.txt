00:00 - welcome back students in this video
00:03 - tutorial we will see how to search yes
00:06 - to decode of a given city from the array
00:09 - for example if we have array called
00:12 - city and then all the cities are entered
00:16 - in that as a string type and then STD
00:19 - code which is having integer type so
00:22 - according to the city's yesterday codes
00:24 - are available if we search for the
00:27 - particular city's aesthetic or for
00:31 - example bangle it should say 0 8 0 is
00:34 - the code of that bangle let us create a
00:36 - program
00:59 - drilling for java dot let us have
01:03 - scanner class this time util dot scanner
01:10 - then class city yes Katie will create an
01:28 - object for scanner class you stand a
01:39 - rough start out you let us intimate to
01:46 - do the length of the array so system let
02:04 - LBD length so guilty a list fault oh yes
02:09 - see dot next int off now let us declare
02:14 - to our s1 is for city names other is for
02:18 - city code
02:19 - so string city is equal to new string
02:31 - off the length will be L so next int STD
02:40 - code is equalto new int of length will
02:47 - grab in here so now let us take the
02:51 - input for both the s we will give far
02:54 - too far into is equal to 0
02:58 - yes lesser than yellow I plus plus
03:08 - so let us intimate are going to enter
03:11 - the city name enter the city so here
03:28 - city half I is equal to SC dot next half
03:39 - now to take the STD code
03:52 - [Applause]
04:09 - now both the arrays are ready let us
04:12 - search for that city
04:14 - so let us near the intimation to get the
04:16 - city name system dot out dot print off
04:27 - enter the city NATO serves the STD code
04:36 - so this will be string type string so
04:41 - certain level so it is also the Sidra
04:47 - next off we already know when search
04:52 - becomes successful then we should have a
04:55 - boolean type of variable for that I will
04:58 - you boolean flag initially false so now
05:07 - we will start searching so for that we
05:11 - will give farlow in is equal to zero is
05:16 - lesser than L I plus plus now condition
05:24 - to check you search dot equals ignore
05:31 - casa
05:35 - okay so that is CP now CI k y of i equal
05:44 - to equal to true then we will print
05:58 - STD call half-press the city name which
06:06 - is given for search will be printed
06:08 - class CT plus index number of both the
06:21 - arrays will be the same so if it is
06:23 - finding the city in the particular index
06:27 - number we will print the same index
06:30 - numbers value of STD core array so STD
06:36 - code of I so you flag is equal to files
06:51 - then we will say system gun how about
06:56 - print clean off there is no such city so
07:07 - let us check once so we can do here
07:14 - print so it will be in the same line so
07:21 - L is the length so this is right and
07:24 - then we have created both RS far loop is
07:27 - right then we have taken input for both
07:31 - the things here we are taking the
07:37 - searching element then flag as false so
07:41 - this is searching so this far loop is
07:43 - right so this is the condition so it is
07:47 - everything is right so let us compile
07:52 - right click so enter the length of the
07:57 - array so I give 7 so I give
08:05 - code for that is five six - next to City
08:09 - ten 944 next disappear Lucknow the code
08:18 - will be 5:22 then jumbo 191 is the code
08:25 - then Shimla 177 mother 179 Bangalore Oh
08:43 - Katie so now we have to set so let us
08:48 - search for Shimla so even we can do
08:52 - small case or upper case because we have
08:55 - already ignored the case Shimla so we
09:00 - got the code which is right similarly we
09:07 - can also search for the students roll
09:09 - number and name of the student and also
09:13 - CT pin code and the CP Thank You
09:18 - students keep watching my videos
