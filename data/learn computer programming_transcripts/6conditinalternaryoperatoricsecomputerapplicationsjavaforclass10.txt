00:00 - hello students today we are going to see
00:04 - ternary operator ternary operator is
00:09 - also called conditional operators here
00:12 - conditional operator is a question mark
00:15 - this operator requires three operands I
00:20 - will explain this with small example
00:23 - program let us create a class this is
00:46 - like a if is condition but in a single
00:51 - statement so before going to learn
00:54 - ternary operator let us do a small
00:58 - program using if-else let us consider a
01:01 - program to divide bigger number by a
01:05 - smaller number let us import 0 duck
01:28 - within dots connect
01:33 - cash
01:51 - this chromium stringer elements let us
02:06 - assign to variables to take input for
02:10 - dividing and then 1/5 touring the result
02:13 - so let us stick to variables in type int
02:16 - X comma Y and then let's do double Q is
02:24 - Q getting object for scanner class then
02:39 - printing segment prompting enter in my
02:56 - [Applause]
03:02 - missing leg so let X Asian photo obj dot
03:14 - next int R + 1 let us take another input
03:20 - also
03:28 - let this one be play then now we need to
03:36 - divide bigger number by a smaller number
03:38 - so let us have a condition here if X is
03:43 - greater than Y then Q is equal to X
03:57 - divided by Y X Q is equal to Y divided
04:11 - by X see now you can see all these codes
04:17 - if condition and the else condition
04:20 - these all statements can be written in a
04:24 - single statement using ternary operator
04:28 - how see the variable Q is going to get
04:34 - the result right so we say Q is equal to
04:40 - the condition given yes checking whether
04:44 - X is greater than Y so we say X is
04:49 - greater than Y the condition is given
04:51 - after that we give a question mark that
04:55 - is conditional operator and then we say
04:58 - if this is true and the first statement
05:01 - now the x / y is going to be executed
05:05 - yes the next one Y divided by X is going
05:11 - to be executed that means the value of x
05:15 - divided by Y is storing Q if it is false
05:20 - then Y divided by X value stored in Q so
05:25 - all this code is replaced by a single
05:29 - statement here it is easy isn't it let
05:34 - us simply keep this for a while
05:37 - let's print no system back out back
05:43 - plenty enough tell you Pentecost is
05:52 - employable
05:53 - plus Q let us execute this compare this
05:59 - no syntax errors process
06:02 - let us run this program so let us do 24
06:11 - and small number to suggest well so in
06:17 - case of test we give Mullingar
06:21 - and then we give big number as for
06:25 - people it will scan t1 so however the
06:29 - bigger number they will be smaller
06:30 - number is then so let us modify this
06:33 - program with turn aerial photography let
06:37 - it not be there click this and then let
06:45 - it be the code company so let us compile
06:51 - no syntax errors so it will do as before
06:58 - we did fortify them a so this Phi you
07:04 - asked the quotient then if you do in the
07:07 - other way 65 and then hundred and thirty
07:18 - said yes to so now we came to know that
07:27 - a conditional operator is a single line
07:31 - statement for if else condition then
07:36 - this is easy method to do any program in
07:39 - short way so this question mark is the
07:42 - conditional operator I hope you enjoyed
07:46 - this session
07:48 - and learn trade away Thank You Lawrence
