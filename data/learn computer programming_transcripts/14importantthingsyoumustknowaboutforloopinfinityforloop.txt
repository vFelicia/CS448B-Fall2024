00:00 - welcome back students today I am going
00:04 - to teach you more about
00:06 - farlap so that we will be very good in
00:08 - using far loop or even some theory
00:12 - questions are there in part a that is
00:15 - section here you will be able to answer
00:17 - perfectly
00:18 - I will teach that throw the previous
00:22 - program itself we already know that
00:26 - there are three expressions in the for
00:29 - loop that is one first is initialization
00:32 - next is the test condition and then
00:35 - whether it is incrementing or
00:37 - decrementing are you can say step value
00:39 - so now if you see this is equal to 10
00:42 - which we have initialized the value so
00:45 - this can be there are else without this
00:49 - also we can do but it can be done before
00:52 - the for loop itself for example is equal
00:56 - to 10 as I am given previously so you
01:00 - can have the initialization in the
01:04 - farlow other ways before itself you can
01:06 - have and then this also will run let's
01:09 - just run this and check semicolon
01:12 - compile so we could see that it is
01:21 - running perfectly the second one I am
01:27 - going to tell you is about the step that
01:30 - is increment or decrement so even this
01:34 - we can skip in the far loop so instead
01:38 - of here we can give that inside the loop
01:42 - itself so we can say that is I - -
01:46 - whether it is going to be here or here
01:50 - it doesn't make any difference
01:53 - so even now this is acceptable so every
01:58 - time it decreases after printing the
02:02 - statement and this also runs
02:09 - so you can see that again goodra okay
02:19 - now let us consider so when there is a
02:26 - step condition that is increment or
02:28 - decrement and then even this is here
02:32 - itself but we are not giving any test
02:37 - condition here so what it is so if there
02:42 - is no step condition then what it is
02:45 - going to happen it is not going to test
02:47 - any condition so this low loop is going
02:49 - to be infinite loop so it is not going
02:53 - to come outside of the loop and then it
02:55 - will keep on printing the same thing
02:58 - again and again without any limiter so
03:01 - this is called infinity loop so when
03:05 - there is infinite loop then the
03:07 - statement cannot be outside of the loop
03:10 - so because that becomes unreachable
03:12 - statement so let us delete this
03:16 - otherwise I will show compile so it
03:19 - shows unreachable statement so let us
03:22 - delete this and then let us run so it is
03:27 - going to be infinity without ending now
03:33 - syntax error rightly so you can see that
03:38 - it is not at all ending so how to stop
03:42 - this we can click on this and then here
03:45 - you can go and stop this otherwise
03:47 - control shift and re if we press it is
03:50 - going to stop the java virtual machine
03:52 - you can right click and then reset java
03:55 - virtual machine so it stops now so then
03:59 - you can close otherwise you won't be
04:00 - able to close this so next now we are
04:04 - going to see here we do not give
04:06 - anything in this look so this also can
04:09 - be without initialization and even
04:13 - without increment decrement then when
04:16 - there is no condition it is going to be
04:18 - infinity loop so we do not have any more
04:22 - in the farlow just all these are empty
04:27 - in the sense there is no expression
04:29 - given so we are going to print ie so let
04:33 - us initially sense just five so this is
04:38 - also going to be a infinity loop compare
04:44 - this see there the five is keep on going
04:56 - but we can't see the difference as it is
04:59 - the same number repeating again and
05:00 - again so let us stop this
05:16 - now I'm going to tell one more example
05:18 - for infinity look so for example I if I
05:22 - give is equal to 10 then is going to be
05:29 - say than or equal to 10 okay and then
05:33 - I'm going to you I - - only see here
05:38 - this is is going to be lesser than or
05:41 - equal to 10 so I use initialize it as 10
05:44 - so it is true and then it becomes one
05:48 - less after printing this it becomes one
05:51 - less so it becomes nine and then that is
05:53 - also a lesser than 10 then prints then
05:57 - eight seven six
05:58 - all these are lesser than ten even it
06:01 - goes - eight also lesser than ten so
06:04 - there is no limit for going the minus
06:07 - side so this also becomes infinity loop
06:11 - when the test expression always true
06:16 - compile this so you can see as before it
06:26 - is keep on and I mean let us stop this
06:39 - so let us have here greater than or
06:44 - equal to one so from ten to one it is
06:47 - going to run now so the last one thing I
06:49 - am going to list you look without any
06:53 - body statement this is called empty loop
06:58 - where we don't have any action to
07:01 - perform what it is going to do just it
07:04 - is going to delay the time if we give in
07:07 - a big numbers it will surely delay some
07:10 - time so for example we can you let us
07:13 - have thousand as it is empty body it is
07:21 - not going to execute anything but it is
07:24 - just going to delay for some kind okay
07:28 - one more thing I will tell about Fargo
07:30 - so let us have this s10 and then
07:37 - printing statement here so we have
07:39 - declared until now we have declared this
07:42 - before the Fargo pizza this declaration
07:45 - also can be done inside the for loop so
07:49 - let us have here in is equal to temp so
07:54 - here we have declared in PI and that
07:57 - also initialized this also can be done
08:00 - using Fargo students I hope you learnt
08:11 - more about follow so which will be very
08:13 - useful for you to do any type of program
08:18 - Thank You students subscribe and like if
08:22 - it is helpful for you so please watch my
08:25 - next video where I am going to explain
08:28 - about nested for loop for creating
08:30 - pattern
