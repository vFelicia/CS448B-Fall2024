00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - foreign
00:15 - in this class we are going to see
00:18 - slicing a list
00:23 - this is the way to access a part of a
00:26 - list so we will be using the index
00:28 - numbers in range the syntax is as
00:31 - follows a list and then in the square
00:33 - bracket we will mention start the stop
00:37 - colon and step
00:39 - start and stop both are the index
00:41 - numbers
00:42 - step is an integer that how many step it
00:46 - needs to go so when we are mentioning
00:49 - start
00:50 - the index number that is included which
00:53 - is mentioned for example if I say file 5
00:56 - is included
00:58 - but the stop
01:00 - mentioned number is not included it will
01:03 - be stopping before it for example again
01:06 - if I say 5 it will stop at 4
01:09 - it will not consider 5.
01:12 - the step value is always integer
01:16 - as we are having left to right and right
01:20 - to left both index numbers it can also
01:22 - be negative 1. by default remember it is
01:26 - plus 1.
01:28 - not minus 1.
01:30 - let us have some examples
01:33 - here is a list called num ch
01:37 - num c h of 2 is to 5. here one more
01:41 - thing I wanted to tell you step is
01:44 - optional for you when we are not giving
01:47 - steps
01:48 - that is only plus 1 as default
01:53 - so when we are having plus 1
01:56 - doesn't need to mention it
01:58 - so here it means Plus 1.
02:01 - so 2 to 5. so let us have the index
02:04 - numbers first for this
02:06 - now
02:08 - 2 is 10 there
02:11 - 5 is not included so it will stop at
02:14 - four so here 2 3 4 are the range which
02:19 - is been sliced from the list here it is
02:22 - from left to right so this will be the
02:24 - output
02:26 - next
02:27 - num CH of minus 3 is to minus 8 is to
02:31 - minus 1. see there step value it is
02:34 - given minus 1 let us also know the index
02:37 - value from right to left
02:41 - so minus 3 is
02:43 - OC there
02:44 - then minus 8 is the first one which is e
02:48 - b e b is not included as minus it is not
02:51 - included so it will stop at IB itself
02:54 - step is minus 1 it is clear so that it
02:56 - will be traversing from right to left
03:01 - so the output for this will be OC
03:05 - 25 a b 10 IB next we are having num CH
03:10 - of minus 6 is to 6.
03:13 - so minus 6 is 10 there
03:16 - and then 6 is given see there sometimes
03:18 - it can also be mixed with minus and plus
03:21 - both
03:23 - so minus 6 is 10 6 is 55 so it should be
03:28 - from left to right step value is plus 1
03:31 - here
03:32 - so IB 10 a b 25 OC will be taken 6 is
03:38 - not included need to remember this
03:41 - output will be this one
03:44 - so this is just to understand
03:47 - we will have a number of examples so
03:49 - that it will be more clear for you
03:51 - executing in the python
03:56 - let me have language
03:58 - I give Lang
04:04 - pi
04:08 - Java
04:13 - C
04:18 - plus plus
04:24 - basic
04:29 - VB
04:36 - Pearl so these are the values which I
04:39 - have
04:40 - let me slice now lying off that is open
04:44 - the square bracket and give 2 is to 5.
04:48 - so here 2 is C right
04:51 - 0
04:53 - this is 1 this is 2.
04:56 - so 3 4 it will take
05:00 - 5 is not included
05:02 - so C C plus plus basic should be the
05:05 - result
05:07 - if this step is plus one so here as it
05:10 - is not mentioned step is plus one you
05:12 - should be very careful about this
05:15 - so this is the right answer
05:18 - now
05:21 - Lang of
05:22 - minus 2 is to
05:25 - minus 6 in the reverse order minus 1 it
05:29 - is so this is minus 1 this is minus 2.
05:33 - so from minus 2 it will take minus 3
05:37 - minus 4
05:39 - minus 5
05:41 - minus 6. so minus 6 is Java there
05:45 - is not included so it will stop at C
05:49 - itself
05:50 - the order is from right to left so we
05:54 - will be getting VB basic C plus plus and
05:56 - C
05:59 - now
06:01 - Lang of
06:05 - is to
06:07 - three
06:09 - see there
06:10 - I have not mentioned the start
06:13 - but I gave the stop
06:16 - in this case it is always taken as 0.
06:20 - so that means it starts from that first
06:22 - element itself
06:24 - so up to 3 3 is not included
06:27 - so it will stop at 2 so Pi Java and c
06:32 - will be taken
06:33 - let me give Lang of
06:37 - 3 is to
06:39 - nothing I give
06:41 - so the staff is not even
06:43 - it means it will take until the end
06:47 - C plus plus is having the index number 3
06:50 - so from here it will go to the end
06:57 - we could see that
06:59 - now I have an example here
07:02 - where the step value is not there
07:05 - but it goes in opposite way
07:09 - so that is
07:10 - 6 is to 2.
07:13 - now
07:15 - 6 is per
07:18 - and then 2 is
07:22 - C here
07:24 - so it should come
07:26 - from right to left
07:29 - so bigger number
07:31 - is the starting
07:33 - smaller number is the stop
07:37 - it cannot Traverse from left to right so
07:41 - it is going to be empty
07:43 - similar value length of minus 4 is to
07:47 - minus 1. raised to minus 1.
07:52 - see the step value is -1
07:56 - the starting is smaller number
08:00 - stop is bigger number so minus 1 is per
08:03 - where it should stop
08:06 - that is not included so it should stop
08:08 - here
08:09 - minus 4 is
08:11 - C plus plus so minus 1 minus 2 minus 3
08:14 - minus 4 from C plus plus
08:18 - it should take until VV
08:22 - but the Step is given as minus 1. it
08:26 - cannot Traverse from right to left in
08:28 - this case
08:29 - this is also going to be empty
08:31 - this is the reason I am repeating that
08:34 - you have to be very careful about the
08:36 - step value now let me give
08:39 - Lang of 0 is to
08:43 - 5 and then step past 2.
08:46 - see there Step past 2 I have given
08:49 - 0 is py
08:52 - so that means the next
08:54 - step is not counted so it will directly
08:56 - jump to the Second Step so that is pi
08:59 - and then it will come to C now C is 2
09:02 - here then 3 is Left 4 is basic so that
09:06 - is included so 5 is left and then 6 so
09:09 - however 5 itself is not included so it
09:12 - will be stopping at basic itself so now
09:15 - Pi C and basic will be the result
09:19 - so I think now you are clear with this
09:21 - step value also let us have one example
09:23 - reverse with more Super Loop Lang of
09:26 - minus 2 is 2 minus 6 is to minus 2 minus
09:32 - 2 is VB
09:35 - it is going in reverse order as it is
09:37 - minus 2 that step
09:40 - so minus 6 it should stop Java is -6
09:43 - right
09:45 - so now VB is taken basic is not taken
09:50 - so C plus plus is taken
09:52 - again
09:54 - C is not taken it's supposed to take
09:57 - Java
09:58 - Java is -6
10:00 - but minus 6 is not included
10:02 - so it will stop at C plus plus itself
10:06 - so only it can take VB and C plus s
10:10 - let us execute
10:13 - so V B and C plus plus
10:16 - hope now these examples make you clear
10:20 - how to slice a string
10:22 - or in case you are asked to give the
10:24 - output of python code given you will be
10:27 - able to get the output
10:30 - I am giving now Lang of
10:33 - Ester is to minus 1.
10:36 - so it gets the output here
10:39 - when nothing is mentioned it is from
10:41 - start again when nothing is mentioned in
10:43 - the stop it is going to be end but the
10:46 - Step value here is -1 so in this case it
10:50 - will start at
10:51 - -1 that is the last element
10:54 - being the step is -1
10:57 - and then
10:58 - the
11:00 - end value will be the first one that is
11:03 - minus 7.
11:05 - in this case all the elements are
11:08 - reversed so it reads from right to left
11:11 - all the elements
11:13 - per VB basic C plus plus C Java and py
11:17 - will be that the
11:18 - output let us check
11:22 - so in case you need to reverse with the
11:25 - slice
11:26 - you can do this instead of using reverse
11:29 - of function hope now everything is clear
11:32 - for you
11:34 - we will meet in the next class
11:38 - keep practicing and learning
11:42 - thank you
