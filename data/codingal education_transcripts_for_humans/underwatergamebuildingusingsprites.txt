01:11 - you do not have to copy mine
01:13 - you have to make your own project and
01:15 - after that you have to submit your
01:17 - project okay so i'll tell you step by
01:19 - step how you can do everything
01:21 - so this is the code sprint whose due
01:23 - date is august 16 so you need to
01:25 - complete your project and submit it
01:27 - before that
01:28 - so what will you be doing in the code
01:30 - sprint so you are all in the junior
01:33 - group right you're in this process one
01:35 - to four
01:36 - okay so we have two themes for you the

02:04 - people can use
02:05 - any block based application okay so
02:08 - whatever you have learned
02:09 - you can use that platform okay be it
02:12 - strange eatport.org be
02:14 - some cable applause any platform that
02:16 - you have learned you can use that to
02:18 - make this game
02:19 - okay the next theme is storytelling so
02:21 - you have to select
02:22 - any one thing either this one or this
02:25 - one so you have to select one theme

02:46 - want to work on let's just say i
02:48 - like game building okay so after
02:51 - finalizing my theme i'll just click on
02:53 - start now

03:02 - grade then my email my phone
03:04 - number then my parents name then my
03:07 - school and my city
03:08 - after i fill in all these details i can
03:11 - take help from my parents to fill these

03:40 - august
03:41 - though it seems very far but it is not
03:43 - okay
03:44 - so i know code.org so i'll make a
03:47 - project on four.org
03:49 - so as we read that we can make an
03:51 - underwater game so i'll just go to
03:54 - code.org
03:55 - and then after that i'll go to create
03:58 - and ilo sprite lab if you know play lab
04:01 - or anything else you can do that as well
04:02 - i know sprite lab
04:04 - so i'll make a project on sprite lab
04:06 - okay
04:08 - and i will quickly
04:11 - let it and after that
04:14 - still let it close after one more thing
04:18 - you will not be given points for copying
04:21 - the project that i am making
04:23 - your task is to make a project of your
04:26 - own
04:26 - your project should be your imagination
04:28 - your creativity
04:30 - you should be doing the block of codes
04:31 - yourself okay
04:33 - so you will be given points if the like
04:36 - depending on how imaginative your
04:37 - project
04:38 - is how creative how new and how correct
04:41 - the code is
04:42 - okay try not to copy the project from
04:45 - anywhere because otherwise you will not
04:46 - be getting points
04:48 - okay so i will make my project
04:51 - so i'll just delete this and i'll set
04:55 - so as i'm going to make an underwater
04:57 - game so i'll select an underwater theme
05:00 - and after that i'll go to stripes to add
05:02 - my characters
05:03 - so let me think i want a star
05:07 - i want a chef who is going to eat fishes
05:10 - and
05:13 - yeah so i have this octopus
05:17 - and i'll make another character
05:21 - and that will be let's just say
05:24 - oh where's my shark so i'll search bird
05:27 - or shark yeah here my shark is
05:29 - so i'll make a shark as well now i'll
05:31 - change the position of this shark with
05:33 - this yellow spoon
05:35 - and yeah here's my shark and i'll add
05:37 - most fishes okay i'll just add one more
05:39 - fish
05:40 - so here goes my fish so i'll go to more
05:43 - again
05:44 - and insert i will say fish which face do
05:47 - i like oh i like this blue fish
05:49 - so i'll say select the fish and i change
05:53 - its position
05:54 - and done so now i have everything that i
05:57 - want to be there in my game
05:59 - okay after that what i'll do i'll go to
06:01 - event so that my shaft can move with my
06:04 - arrow keys
06:05 - so i'll do events and
06:08 - when i press okay so when up is pressed
06:12 - i want my shaft to move up so i'll go to
06:14 - sprites
06:16 - and i'll do move 10 pixels not
06:19 - but does the bunny have to move no so
06:22 - i'll select
06:23 - here the sharp and if i click on run to
06:26 - check
06:26 - oh yeah my shaft is moving up similarly
06:29 - i need to do it for the other arrow keys
06:31 - as well so again i'll go to events
06:34 - and i will do then
06:37 - down stretch so now for the down arrow
06:40 - key also
06:41 - i will make my shark hole
06:44 - so but this time it has to move and this
06:48 - character would be the shaft
06:50 - and similarly i'll do for the left and
06:52 - the right arrow key as well
06:54 - so when
06:58 - left is pressed i will again
07:02 - move character 10 pixels now i'll take
07:04 - this block and i'll change the character
07:05 - to shark
07:06 - and i'll change north to west and
07:09 - similarly i'll do for the right arrow
07:11 - key as well so event
07:14 - pen right press
07:17 - i'll again go to sprite
07:21 - and move my character
07:24 - sharp 10 pixels each and now if i just
07:27 - click on run and try to check see it's
07:30 - moving right
07:31 - it's moving left moving up and it's
07:34 - moving down as well you cool
07:36 - my sharks moving oh but what about my
07:38 - octopus and my fish
07:40 - oh i have to move them as well for that
07:42 - i'll go to behaviors
07:44 - and i will take the sprite begins block
07:47 - okay so i'll just take sprite begins
07:50 - and i'll place this one here so that i
07:51 - have some space so sprite begins
07:54 - so but which price is funny no my
07:56 - octopus
07:57 - so my octopus begins and the next one
08:00 - i'll do and that is wandering the last
08:03 - one
08:04 - and if i just click on run yay my
08:07 - octopus is moving now on its own i'm not
08:09 - doing anything
08:11 - similarly i even want that my fish
08:14 - should be doing
08:15 - both the same thing so again i'll go to
08:17 - behaters
08:18 - and i'll say sprite begins but which
08:21 - price
08:21 - the bunny no the fish so the fish

08:32 - and i'll take
08:36 - wondering again i like wandering the
08:38 - best okay
08:40 - if i click on run now everyone is moving
08:43 - i can move with the arrow keys
08:45 - and i can eat the characters oh but oh
08:49 - i am unable to read them because i have
08:52 - not done the code for that yet so
08:54 - again i'll go to events
08:57 - i'll again go to events and i will say
09:00 - that
09:01 - when this touches this okay so when i on
09:04 - the shark and when i touch the octopus
09:06 - i want that i eat the octopus and he

09:51 - in scratch also you can use any platform
09:53 - okay you can use fast food.org again
09:57 - also you can use sprite lab play lab app
09:59 - lab game lab
10:00 - any platform that you know you can use
10:02 - that okay even if you know any platform

know when my poor little screen is visible yes so is my screen visible yes yes so when you log into your dashboard the competition is here at the top okay so today we are going to talk about the code string okay so if you just click on this name it shows you the entire details of this competition one very important thing and that is that we have to complete this before 16th of august okay so we'll be doing like you all what you will be doing i'll tell you how to register after that i will be making one sample project and you have to make your own project you do not have to copy mine you have to make your own project and after that you have to submit your project okay so i'll tell you step by step how you can do everything so this is the code sprint whose due date is august 16 so you need to complete your project and submit it before that so what will you be doing in the code sprint so you are all in the junior group right you're in this process one to four okay so we have two themes for you the first one is building and the second one is storytelling okay so depending on which theme you like you can do a project according to that so let's just say i want to do game building so i have
