00:03 - [Applause]
00:05 - hey there
00:06 - have you ever came across gigabyte and
00:09 - megabyte or even kilobyte and got
00:11 - confused
00:12 - well my name is lynn and in today's
00:14 - video we will be learning about
00:16 - units of measuring digital information
00:19 - like
00:19 - bit byte and megabyte and if you want to
00:22 - learn about
00:23 - data rates like megabytes per second
00:26 - then stay tuned for our next video
00:28 - anyways what are we waiting for let's
00:30 - get right into today's lesson
00:35 - digital information which is stored in
00:38 - storages like hard drives and usb
00:40 - memories
00:40 - are measured with units starting from
00:42 - bits bytes kilobyte and so on
00:45 - you might observe these measurement
00:47 - units on your computer while saving your
00:49 - homework as a word document
00:52 - a bit is a binary digit the smallest
00:56 - increment
00:56 - of data on a computer it is usually zero
01:02 - or one one byte consists of eight bits
01:06 - a character like letter or numeric such
01:09 - as
01:10 - a b or eight is stored as
01:13 - one byte for example letter a
01:16 - is stored on your pc as one byte
01:20 - that contains the bits zero one one four
01:23 - zero
01:23 - one so everything stored in our computer
01:27 - storages like pictures
01:30 - videos or music are encoded as bits
01:34 - remember one bit a01 and one byte is
01:37 - eight bits
01:39 - now let me give you an interesting
01:40 - example len my name
01:42 - starting it in a text file will occupy 3
01:45 - bytes like so
01:47 - each letter contains 8 bits l
01:50 - i n really interesting right
01:59 - data can be measured using different
02:01 - measuring units examples are
02:03 - one kilo bit which is 1024 bit
02:07 - one megabit which is 1024 kilobits
02:11 - one gigabit which is 1024 megabits
02:15 - one terabit which is 1024 gigabit
02:19 - one zetabit which is 1024
02:23 - terabit and yeah
02:26 - remember one byte is eight bits now you
02:29 - can convert
02:30 - from bet to byte in a really simple step
02:32 - which is by dividing one over eight
02:35 - so let me give you a few examples
02:38 - one kilobit divided by one over eight
02:41 - kilobyte will give you
02:43 - will give you 0.125 kilobytes
02:46 - all you have to do is divide by one over
02:48 - eight now
02:50 - one megabit can also be converted
02:54 - by dividing one over eight which will
02:56 - give us
02:58 - 0.125 megabytes
03:04 - really simple it's actually really fun
03:06 - to solve too
03:11 - but why do we have all of these
03:13 - measuring units
03:16 - suppose we have a folder which is 0.5
03:18 - gigabytes
03:21 - this number might seem simple but if it
03:23 - was in bits or bytes the number would
03:25 - have been way more complex
03:27 - and more confusing so let me explain
03:30 - some more 0.5 gigabytes can be
03:35 - made bigger as in a bigger digit number
03:38 - by dividing by multiplying by 1024
03:42 - megabytes which will give us 512
03:45 - and again this number might can also be
03:47 - converted
03:48 - into an even bigger digit by multiplying
03:51 - by 1024
03:58 - kilobyte
04:00 - which will give us 524 000 kilobytes
04:04 - which can also again be converted into
04:06 - an even bigger
04:07 - digit by multiplying by 1024
04:11 - which will give us the answer in bytes
04:21 - so 536 million bytes
04:24 - also be converted again to bits
04:27 - lastly two bits so you get the answer
04:30 - 536
04:31 - million bytes multiplied by eight
04:35 - will give us four trillion bits
04:39 - oh my god that's really big i'm really
04:42 - thankful that we have all of these other
04:43 - measurements which keep things simple
04:46 - anyways now we have a folder which is 10
04:48 - trillion bits
04:49 - big this number is really complex and
04:53 - confusing
04:54 - let's see how can we make it smaller
04:56 - using the other measurements
04:58 - 10 trillion bits should be divided by 8
05:01 - first so that you can get it the answer
05:04 - in bytes
05:06 - which is 1 trillion now
05:10 - we have to convert this to kilowatt in
05:13 - order to do that you have to divide
05:15 - 1 trillion bytes by
05:19 - 1024
05:23 - which will give us 1 billion kilobyte
05:26 - let's convert this into
05:29 - megabyte and then gigabyte so 1 million
05:33 - kilobyte divided again by 1024
05:37 - will give us
05:44 - 119 000 megabytes and lastly
05:48 - let's divide that one more time by 1024
05:53 - which will finally give us
06:01 - 1.16 gigabyte really cool
06:06 - now abbreviations
06:10 - capital mb is abbreviation for
06:14 - megabyte small mb is abbreviation for
06:19 - megabit capital kb
06:22 - is abbreviation for kilobyte
06:25 - small kb is abbreviation 4 kilobit
06:30 - and so on so whenever you see
06:35 - capital b that means it's white
06:38 - and whenever you see small b that means
06:41 - it's bit
06:43 - all right guys i hope you enjoyed this
06:46 - video and was able to understand the
06:47 - lesson
06:48 - make sure to stay tuned for our part two
06:51 - of this video where we'll be talking
06:52 - about
06:53 - data rates which are used to measure
06:55 - speed of traffic like networks
06:57 - using megabytes per second and more
