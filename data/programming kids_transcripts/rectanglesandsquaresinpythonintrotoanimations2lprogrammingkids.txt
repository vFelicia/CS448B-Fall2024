00:00 - [Music]
00:04 - hello everyone and welcome to
00:05 - programming kids
00:07 - my name is lynn and in today's video
00:09 - i'll be teaching you guys
00:11 - um squares and rectangles in python this
00:14 - is more like an introduction to
00:15 - animation which is just
00:16 - the best part but python being able to
00:19 - draw a girl for your app
00:21 - or draw a girl for something or a
00:24 - company
00:25 - or a logo this probably has to be the
00:28 - best part of a python
00:29 - you have the flexibility to create
00:31 - amazing things
00:32 - but in order to do that you have to
00:34 - learn the basic shapes like
00:36 - a circle squares triangle rectangles
00:39 - and um in our last video we did
00:42 - we did a whole video about circles so
00:44 - make sure to check it out i'll be
00:45 - linking it in the description box
00:48 - okay now let's
00:51 - um tell you the three main things that
00:53 - we'll be talking about
00:55 - first we will create a square and we
00:57 - will fill it with your favorite color
00:59 - then we will create a rectangle and we
01:01 - will also fill that with your favorite
01:02 - color
01:03 - and last but not least the most the best
01:06 - part
01:07 - we're going to be creating a matrix so
01:09 - if you don't know
01:10 - what's a matrix and keep on watching
01:13 - all right make sure to grab a notebook
01:15 - or a cup of tea and
01:16 - let's get into it first i'll be opening
01:19 - idle which is the main thing for coding
01:21 - on python
01:24 - then i i'll have to create a new file so
01:27 - file
01:28 - new file and then i'll have to name my
01:30 - file
01:32 - so i'll name it as hashtag square
01:36 - dot py then i have to import turtle
01:39 - turtle
01:40 - is just the main thing for making your
01:43 - graphics
01:44 - real so whatever code you do
01:48 - python actually opens the python
01:50 - launcher and there are the
01:52 - view the the graphic
01:55 - okay now we will have to name our
01:57 - material i'll just name it with
01:59 - ask t you can name it as bob
02:02 - and press equal but for me i'll just
02:04 - name it as
02:05 - t so t is equal to
02:09 - turtle dots
02:14 - just like that and i'll have to put
02:16 - brackets and press enter
02:18 - then we will have to choose a color
02:22 - so that our turtle will use so
02:25 - i'll type the dot full color
02:31 - and open the bracket and type
02:34 - orange i want my turtle to use arm
02:39 - okay so let's just type that properly
02:42 - and press enter
02:50 - okay next we want to
02:53 - oops what happened okay next
02:57 - i want to start i want my
03:01 - turtle to start feeling like whatever
03:04 - shape i draw from now on i want
03:05 - materials to fill it with that color
03:08 - okay so we have to type d dot
03:12 - begin underscore fill
03:16 - okay and press enter
03:19 - then we will have to start a loop so
03:22 - i'll just type four
03:24 - i in range
03:27 - four okay and
03:32 - because this is a loop you'll have to
03:34 - put on
03:36 - you will have to put columns and press
03:39 - enter
03:40 - okay because we put column it starts
03:42 - underneath the eye
03:43 - and what does this what does this loop
03:45 - actually mean it means that
03:48 - we want turtle to draw this
03:51 - four times you can type whatever you
03:53 - have to four times but this is quicker
03:56 - and the code looks smaller okay
03:59 - and okay now let's type
04:03 - how many steps we want our children to
04:05 - move
04:06 - so i think i'll go
04:11 - okay uh i think i'll go ahead and make
04:15 - it 200.
04:17 - you can experiment with it maybe you can
04:19 - try making it 500
04:21 - or maybe one or whatever you want
04:25 - okay and then i have to choose an angle
04:27 - because this is a
04:28 - square the angle is always 90 degrees
04:35 - right press enter and
04:38 - now we have to end the fold this is not
04:40 - part of the loop so i just started from
04:43 - the
04:43 - beginning
04:48 - [Music]
04:52 - and yeah
04:58 - okay and here it is i type d dot and
05:03 - underscore fill okay guys now let's
05:07 - save this and then run it i'll just save
05:10 - it on my desktop
05:11 - ask where
05:16 - and now let's run it
05:23 - whoa isn't that cool as
05:26 - perfect square with my favorite color
05:29 - how about we change it up a little bit
05:31 - how about i
05:32 - tie i make this
05:37 - thousand 6000 six thousand how about
05:38 - that
05:40 - let's see what happens
05:43 - whoa it's gigantic it doesn't even feel
05:46 - there
05:48 - oh look it doesn't work probably because
05:51 - our
05:52 - screen is too small and we're gonna have
05:54 - to maximize it
06:01 - oh my gosh it looks really long let's
06:04 - try making it smaller
06:06 - maybe type maybe type i should i think i
06:10 - should type
06:11 - one this time
06:15 - let me do 50 let's try 50 first then we
06:17 - can go smaller
06:19 - all right
06:24 - oh isn't that really small okay let's
06:28 - see what happens if i want to make my
06:30 - angle 60 degrees do you think this will
06:33 - look a square
06:36 - let's see whoops
06:39 - it is not a square and this is why you
06:41 - should always keep
06:43 - your um angle as 90 degrees if you're
06:45 - drawing a square
06:46 - rectangle all right let's try
06:50 - 10 and let's run this
06:54 - press enter and here it is
06:57 - oh my god that is so tiny
07:00 - okay guys that's it for this square
07:04 - program now let's move on to the next
07:06 - one i'm just gonna exit this and open it
07:08 - again
07:09 - and plus i always have my folder on my
07:11 - desktop in case i want to run this again
07:13 - and show it to my friends
07:15 - okay so we'll open idle again
07:19 - and start a new file oh
07:23 - okay then we'll have to name it
07:26 - and hashtag rectangle
07:31 - dot py and then oh i typed rectangle
07:35 - wrong
07:38 - all right then i have to import turtle
07:43 - okay let me just make this big
07:47 - okay then we will have to name
07:50 - our churches so i'll just name it as
07:54 - t
07:57 - turtle dot
08:01 - okay then i'll press enter
08:04 - and i'll pick the color i want my turtle
08:07 - to use
08:08 - so i think i'll put pink
08:21 - okay then i want her to begin fill
08:24 - right after i choose the color so begin
08:27 - underscore fill because it's a variable
08:32 - okay then i have to start my loop so
08:36 - for eyes
08:42 - i want her to repeat this whenever i'm
08:44 - writing right now
08:45 - two times and because this is a loop
08:48 - i will always put in columns and
08:52 - press enter okay and now
08:55 - i have to choose how many steps i wanted
08:58 - to move forward
09:01 - okay
09:05 - forward i want her to move
09:08 - 150
09:11 - let's make it 300 250 so make it more
09:15 - interesting
09:16 - okay then left 90 degrees because it has
09:19 - a right angle
09:23 - okay and forward
09:26 - again this time 200 this time 300.
09:34 - forward
09:38 - all right and last but not least left
09:40 - one more time
09:41 - 90 degrees okay and we're going to be
09:45 - ending the fill
09:46 - so t dot end underscore
09:52 - and here we go
09:56 - now let's run it but before we do that
09:58 - let's
09:59 - make sure to save it i'll save it as
10:02 - rectangle
10:07 - okay and on my desktop just beside the
10:11 - first one
10:15 - okay and
10:18 - here it is rectangle.py
10:23 - all right let's run this
10:30 - whoa isn't that nice
10:34 - this is really cool i really love the
10:36 - pink color
10:39 - it might look like a square but um
10:42 - this side is different from this side so
10:45 - they don't have equal side so
10:47 - this is just proof that it's not a
10:50 - square
10:51 - okay let's try changing it up a little
10:55 - bit
10:56 - so how about we make it
10:59 - we make this 150
11:03 - let's run this
11:10 - that looks more like a rectangle to me
11:13 - but how about i make this
11:14 - big how about i make this 400
11:20 - let's see what happens oh
11:24 - okay yeah that's a perfect rectangle to
11:26 - me
11:28 - well i really love the color of this
11:30 - rectangle
11:31 - and python has a really good job of
11:34 - choosing the colors
11:35 - like the orange one too from the square
11:38 - was really cool
11:39 - now let's exit and we can always go back
11:42 - to it from my desktop
11:43 - and show it to my friends and let's move
11:45 - on to the to the last
11:47 - program the matrix matrix
11:51 - so let's go ahead and open idle and
11:55 - get ready for this so we're going to be
11:57 - opening a new file and naming it
12:00 - so i'll just name it as hashtag
12:04 - um matrix and press enter
12:08 - okay now i'll have to um
12:11 - import turtle
12:15 - import
12:19 - and press enter then i'll have to
12:22 - name my character so i'll name it i'll
12:25 - name her as
12:25 - tv so turtle
12:29 - dots
12:33 - okay and this might be a little bit
12:36 - confusing
12:37 - but it's we're all just
12:41 - defining in the first part in the whole
12:44 - first part we're just defining every
12:45 - single thing
12:46 - because python won't understand if you
12:48 - don't define okay
12:50 - so we will start defining so dia
12:54 - means define so i'll enter my variable
12:57 - over here so it's
12:58 - joe underscore bill
13:02 - underscore rectangle so
13:05 - basically the matrix is small rectangles
13:09 - and they will be filled okay but i'm
13:12 - going to be defining
13:13 - what is going to be inside this over
13:16 - here
13:16 - okay one there will be my turtle
13:20 - there will be the x axis and the y-axis
13:24 - then i'll have my width i'll have a
13:28 - height
13:30 - i'll have a size
13:35 - a color and fill
13:39 - okay and then here put my columns and
13:42 - press enter
13:43 - okay so make sure that you included
13:47 - each of these okay
13:50 - [Music]
13:52 - so i had a t i have an x i have a y
13:55 - with height size color
13:58 - info so in total you're supposed to have
14:01 - one
14:02 - two three four five six seven and eight
14:09 - okay let's move on now i'll be
14:12 - typing in the full command
14:17 - and um i'll have to
14:21 - put the main thing from that command
14:23 - like
14:25 - i'll i'll type it in and hopefully you
14:26 - guys will understand so tdot
14:28 - fill color and
14:32 - t dot pen
14:35 - color and then um t dot
14:39 - pen size
14:42 - okay and then
14:46 - t dot set heading
14:52 - okay okay so
14:55 - now from the fill color the most
14:58 - important thing that i have
15:00 - that python should get me from here is
15:02 - the fill
15:05 - here it's the color
15:12 - okay color
15:15 - then here is the size
15:22 - and for the set heading just type zero
15:24 - you don't really have to worry about
15:25 - this decide 0
15:27 - okay and then we will continue um
15:33 - so t dot
15:36 - g dot again underscore film so i'm
15:40 - telling my churchill
15:41 - to begin their fell right now
15:44 - okay and then i want you to go up okay
15:46 - so t
15:48 - up then i want you to go
15:52 - on to x axis and the y axis so t
15:55 - does go to
15:59 - x comma y
16:03 - okay then i want you to go down so t dot
16:07 - down
16:10 - now we will be just um learning the
16:14 - first part about our
16:17 - rectangle so so t dot forward
16:23 - we're just going to specify what does
16:24 - that mean okay
16:26 - see the forward
16:32 - oh okay um the width
16:36 - this is the width i'm just telling
16:37 - python
16:39 - okay then um the right you'll be drawing
16:43 - the right now so
16:44 - t dot rise that should be at 90 degrees
16:46 - because this is a
16:48 - um rectangle okay and
16:53 - now over here we're drawing the right
16:54 - side okay
16:56 - so the right side of the rectangle so
16:58 - the angle is 90 degrees and the forward
17:02 - that so forward this is the height
17:05 - specifying that for python
17:09 - and for you guys also okay next
17:12 - we will be drawing the bottom part so
17:16 - t dot right
17:19 - and that is a 90 degrees then um
17:24 - that t dot t.4 rate is
17:28 - that's the width for the bottom part
17:34 - okay then i have the left side
17:38 - okay so t dot right
17:42 - 90 degrees okay then
17:46 - the um the forwards when it moves
17:48 - forward this
17:49 - will be the height
17:58 - height
18:00 - okay and then um i'm going to be ending
18:03 - my field right over here
18:06 - that's it turtle you don't have to color
18:08 - anything anymore
18:09 - okay and here we go
18:14 - yeah okay now i'm gonna be checking that
18:17 - my
18:18 - program over here is correct
18:21 - okay so
18:28 - okay let's move on now we will be
18:32 - just um creating another loop this is
18:35 - the end of the first loop this all was a
18:37 - loop
18:38 - probably why it was really um confusing
18:42 - now we're going to start a new one and
18:43 - this is for just the range for x and y
18:46 - and just defining the full the full
18:49 - rectangle
18:51 - just how many steps i wanted to move and
18:54 - then we're done
18:54 - okay so first let's type the range for
18:57 - axle for x
18:58 - for x and y i'll make the move range
19:00 - should be both the same
19:02 - so um for x
19:05 - in range
19:09 - one and eight
19:14 - okay i'm gonna put a column
19:18 - then four y
19:22 - in range that should be the same so
19:26 - one and eight
19:30 - okay and we'll put my column again
19:32 - because this is a loop
19:33 - then last but not least i'm just gonna
19:36 - um type in with a throw underscore fold
19:39 - underscore
19:41 - rectangle how many times i want that to
19:43 - be how wide the x and the y how much
19:46 - i want them to be so don't underscore
19:53 - underscore rectangle
19:57 - and i'll open up my brackets and type t
20:03 - minus 200 plus
20:09 - x times
20:12 - so this here is here this is for x times
20:15 - 20. this is how many
20:17 - steps i want my um
20:22 - accent b okay then for my y i wanted to
20:26 - move y
20:27 - times 20. that's it i'll just type some
20:30 - extra information so 20
20:33 - another 20 in a two
20:37 - and now i'll choose my colors so
20:40 - my colors i want them to be black and
20:42 - white because i believe that that would
20:44 - be the coolest you can go ahead and try
20:46 - red
20:46 - in like green or red and black or
20:49 - whatever you want
20:50 - okay so i'll type white
20:55 - white comma
21:00 - black
21:04 - all right and
21:07 - i'll have to close the brackets
21:13 - all right guys so we're probably done
21:18 - so i'll go ahead and type
21:22 - turtle dot done
21:25 - her job is finished she is done
21:28 - okay here it is
21:32 - so again let's check this but probably
21:35 - because it's complicated you'll always
21:37 - have feeling that there's something
21:38 - wrong with this
21:39 - so i'm just gonna check
21:47 - all right seems like everything is good
21:51 - let's try saving it and i'll just save
21:54 - it next to my three
21:56 - um to my other two so i'll save it as
21:59 - matrix
22:01 - on my desktop
22:04 - and we'll save it and here it is i have
22:07 - all my three
22:08 - things that i created today storage over
22:10 - here so i can show my
22:12 - friends all right guys now we're going
22:14 - to have to run this so here we go
22:16 - moment through
22:22 - okay this is starting up on flow but
22:24 - wait for the result
22:26 - let's wait
22:29 - whoa guys isn't this really cool i don't
22:32 - know why but i find it real really cool
22:34 - let's try to change up the colors how
22:36 - about red
22:40 - and black let's run this let's see how
22:43 - it looks
22:48 - whoa that's also really cool but i feel
22:50 - like white
22:52 - is probably my favorite at white and
22:53 - black because
22:55 - the screen the background is white so i
22:58 - just feel like it looks really cool but
22:59 - you can also make the background red if
23:01 - you want
23:04 - well guys that's it for today's video i
23:06 - hope you guys learned a lot about
23:08 - rectangles and triangle i mean
23:10 - rectangles and squares
23:12 - and i hope this wasn't as hard for you i
23:15 - just thought it would be a fun thing to
23:17 - include in today's video
23:19 - because it has something to do with
23:21 - rectangles
23:23 - so yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this
23:25 - keep programming and i'll see you guys
23:27 - next time on programming kids bye for
23:34 - now
23:36 - [Music]
23:38 - you
