00:04 - hello everyone and welcome to
00:05 - programming kids
00:07 - my name is lin and in today's video i'll
00:09 - be teaching you how to write your first
00:11 - program
00:11 - on python so today's objectives will be
00:16 - how to oh
00:16 - how to print like any sentence that you
00:19 - want
00:20 - i'll teach you how to print it how to
00:22 - open a new file and how to enter your
00:25 - first real program
00:26 - into python before we start make sure to
00:29 - grab
00:30 - a snack or a cup of tea and here we go
00:33 - so i'll be searching idle on my
00:35 - spotlight search
00:36 - all right i don't and here it is this is
00:40 - idle
00:40 - if you guys don't have python on your on
00:42 - your laptop then
00:44 - make sure to check the video in the
00:45 - description box where we
00:47 - showed you how to install python on
00:50 - macbook and windows in that video we
00:53 - also discussed what is idle what does it
00:55 - stand for what does it do and what is
00:57 - its function
00:58 - all right let's open idle now
01:03 - okay um so we have three
01:07 - dash signs over here and this is where
01:10 - you
01:10 - you're supposed to start writing your
01:15 - print function so let's just type print
01:19 - and then we have to put some
01:23 - brackets notice that you should only use
01:25 - the
01:26 - round brackets you cannot use like these
01:30 - or these you cannot use them and you
01:33 - should always start with a
01:35 - double quotation mark or a single
01:36 - quotation mark and end with the exact
01:38 - same one that you started with
01:40 - if you start with another one like if
01:42 - you start with double and you end up
01:44 - single
01:45 - it won't work it'll give you an error
01:47 - but now let's just put
01:48 - a single one and i'm going to write
01:51 - something and let's see your python
01:52 - princess
02:10 - and here we go so i'm gonna press enter
02:13 - and let's see if it's gonna
02:15 - get printed yay python said
02:19 - subscribe to programming kids did you
02:22 - hear that
02:23 - go do that right now okay let's try now
02:26 - with double quotation marks
02:40 - all right and enter
02:44 - like this video right now
02:47 - look over here we have i wrote now
02:50 - with capital letters and that's exactly
02:52 - what python made
02:53 - did it just obey you i don't want it to
02:56 - be
02:56 - python is like a game if you obey
03:00 - the rules they'll obey you okay but what
03:03 - if i try
03:04 - double and single at the same time do
03:06 - you guys think this will work
03:08 - well let's try right now i'm going to
03:10 - print
03:12 - and here we go i'll be starting with
03:16 - double quotation
03:17 - and here we go
03:18 - [Music]
03:26 - and end with single and close and enter
03:30 - oh it gave us an error so that means
03:33 - that you can never
03:34 - ever use double at the beginning and
03:36 - single at the end
03:38 - or the other way out okay now let's try
03:40 - printing
03:41 - the same um sentence but with double
03:45 - double quotations here we go
03:52 - here we go and
03:56 - boom coding is fun now that you guys
04:00 - might
04:01 - have understood the um
04:04 - rules for printing and you guys did a
04:07 - pretty good job
04:08 - with identifying them
04:12 - let's just move on to the next objective
04:15 - now we're going to be opening a new file
04:17 - on python so
04:18 - let's start all you have to do is look
04:20 - at the top bar of your laptop
04:22 - over here and press file
04:26 - new file and here it is this is our
04:29 - folder
04:30 - now we're going to be entering our first
04:33 - program into python so first
04:36 - we have to name it so we're gonna name
04:38 - it by using the hashtag sign
04:40 - and write name py
04:43 - oh yeah i forgot to tell you our program
04:46 - is going to be about python asking us
04:48 - what's our name
04:50 - and how if we answer it but
04:53 - they'll reply to us so here we go
04:57 - i named it name.py and
05:00 - python ignores this completely it's just
05:03 - for us
05:04 - to know what the folder is about okay
05:07 - now let's um put a variable so i'm gonna
05:11 - input a variable and i'll press an equal
05:14 - sign
05:15 - and input this is what i want um
05:18 - python to say i'm gonna put a bracket
05:21 - and publication works what
05:25 - your name so you can write what's your
05:29 - name honey
05:30 - what's your name um uncle what's your
05:33 - name
05:35 - grandfather what's your name
05:38 - um sir or what's your name mom or
05:41 - whatever you want
05:43 - but i'll write what's your name kid how
05:46 - about that
05:47 - and let's close it with exactly the same
05:50 - quotation mark
05:51 - and enter notice that nothing comes at
05:55 - the back
05:55 - that's because we didn't run it and in a
05:57 - second i'll teach you how to run
05:59 - now let's um print what we want
06:03 - python to answer so we'll print
06:06 - and brackets quotation marks hi
06:11 - comma quotation marks so
06:14 - here we have double quotation mark
06:16 - because we want python to replace this
06:18 - quotation mark with your name
06:20 - and we'll write name you might be
06:23 - thinking right now
06:24 - did she forget to put name at the end of
06:27 - the
06:28 - before the closing the bracket i mean to
06:31 - um did she forget to put quotation marks
06:34 - because
06:35 - before closing the bracket no i didn't
06:38 - but
06:38 - because name is a variable there is no
06:40 - need for putting
06:41 - um double quotation or a single
06:43 - quotation at the end
06:44 - okay now let's save it because you
06:47 - cannot
06:48 - run a module before saving it so let's
06:50 - file
06:51 - save and here we go i'll save it as name
06:56 - and i'll want to save it on my
07:00 - desktop and save
07:03 - as you guys can see python automatically
07:05 - saves it on my desktop over here
07:08 - and before we run this have you noticed
07:12 - that python color codes everything
07:14 - that's because python wants to make
07:16 - everything really easy for us
07:18 - if you guys can see print is like a
07:21 - function
07:22 - so it's in purple green this thing is
07:25 - green because i entered it
07:27 - blue is python printing what i wanted
07:31 - and red is forever same thing for here
07:35 - so now let's run this and i'm really
07:38 - excited
07:39 - do you think python will respond let's
07:42 - see
07:44 - what's your name kid my name is lynn
07:49 - hi lynn that is so cool
07:52 - python is really smart but what if i
07:56 - want python to say my name
07:58 - five times like what if i want python to
08:00 - say hi lim lin linlin lin
08:02 - wouldn't that be funny let's try it out
08:06 - so i'm just gonna press enter and
08:09 - type print
08:12 - um open some bracket and quotation marks
08:15 - i'll use double
08:16 - you can use single if you want and i'll
08:18 - write hi
08:20 - um comma
08:23 - quotation mark this is where as we said
08:26 - this is where python will replace the
08:28 - question mark with our name
08:30 - and comma again and i'll write name
08:33 - name name which we set in the variable
08:37 - and i'll type that five times name
08:41 - name and last
08:45 - one is name now let's close it with
08:49 - a bracket and as we said we don't put a
08:51 - quotation mark because it's a
08:53 - variable right let's print uh enter and
08:57 - save this because if you don't save it
08:59 - it won't work
09:01 - all right and press run run mode
09:06 - what's your name kid my name is lynn
09:09 - hi lynn hi lin lin linden lin isn't that
09:13 - funny
09:15 - i hope you guys learned something new
