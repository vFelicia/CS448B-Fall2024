00:04 - hello everyone and welcome to
00:05 - programming kids
00:07 - my name is lin and in today's video i'll
00:09 - be teaching you how to draw a simple
00:11 - um square spiral on python this is for
00:14 - beginners so
00:15 - i'll be doing for you a little tutorial
00:17 - and i'll give you
00:19 - easy steps so what are you waiting for
00:22 - go grab a notebook or a cup of c and
00:24 - let's get into it
00:25 - so first i have to search my idol which
00:28 - is the main thing for coding on my
00:30 - spotlight search
00:32 - and we're just going to search your idol
00:34 - and enter
00:36 - it automatically opens idol and it's
00:39 - right over here
00:42 - let me make it a little bit bigger and
00:45 - now i have to open a new file because in
00:46 - order to create my graphic i should be
00:49 - on a new file
00:50 - so i'll press file new file and
00:54 - here we are okay so
00:57 - you should always name your file not for
01:00 - python
01:01 - but just for you to identify python
01:04 - actually skips this completely
01:05 - just for you so we're just gonna
01:09 - hashtag and i'll just name it
01:11 - squarespiral because that's what i'm
01:12 - going to be drawing
01:17 - and obviously dot py oh there should be
01:20 - no space too
01:21 - so dot p y and enter
01:25 - now we're going to use the turtle
01:28 - program which is just a little
01:30 - mini program in python for drawing
01:33 - graphics and being creative and i have
01:35 - to import that
01:37 - so let's just type import turtle
01:41 - and enter again and then now i want my
01:45 - churchill to immediately hold her pen
01:47 - and get ready for draw
01:48 - in order to do that you should first
01:50 - name your turtle and for me i'll just
01:52 - name her t
01:53 - so i'll write t is equal to
01:56 - turtle the
01:59 - pen make sure to write the p in capital
02:02 - letters or else
02:03 - on python will give you an error and
02:06 - enter
02:07 - now i want um my
02:11 - turtle to i'm going to write the
02:15 - size of my turtle so i'm just going to
02:18 - type
02:18 - 4x in range
02:22 - 98 okay 298
02:26 - and um this is how big i want my turtle
02:31 - to be you can also write 100 and usually
02:34 - um you should go from zero to 100 and
02:36 - you can't go beyond that
02:38 - okay and we have to put a column
02:42 - and press enter and as you guys can see
02:45 - this is a um loop it doesn't go at the
02:49 - back
02:50 - it goes directly underneath the axe
02:53 - okay and um now i'm going to just
02:56 - write how much i want my turtle to
03:00 - be as in width so
03:04 - brackets and two all right let's do four
03:08 - four times
03:11 - x axis just
03:14 - um unknown so
03:17 - yeah enter again and
03:20 - this is my um angle i want it to be
03:24 - obviously a 90 degrees as we're drawing
03:27 - a
03:27 - square but if you want to go ahead and
03:29 - make it
03:30 - like a curved thing then you can change
03:34 - the number
03:35 - and we're going to open my brackets the
03:38 - right 90
03:39 - in there and here we go
03:42 - that's probably it this graphic is
03:45 - really
03:46 - easy but we can add some stuff but for
03:49 - now
03:49 - let's just run it so first you have to
03:52 - save it
03:53 - or else python will give us an error
03:57 - and i'll save it on my desktop
04:01 - and save it as how about square
04:05 - just paragraph
04:11 - and python automatically saves it
04:15 - oh i i also spelled the graphic wrong
04:17 - but that's not a problem
04:18 - anyways let's run run module
04:22 - and here we go let's see
04:25 - whoa isn't that cool
04:34 - it's like a maze
04:38 - but don't you think my turtle is too
04:41 - slow how about i make it fast
04:45 - okay let's go to my um file and
04:48 - i'm going to be entering a
04:52 - command right underneath the turtle.pen
04:57 - and i just want it to be zero speed zero
05:00 - basically as fast as possible so i'm
05:02 - right
05:03 - t speed
05:06 - and here we go zero
05:10 - let's save it
05:13 - and run
05:18 - whoa our youtube can draw really fast
05:24 - and pretty much that's it for this um
05:28 - program and i hope you guys enjoyed
05:32 - making this as much as i did
05:35 - make sure to make your own maybe contain
05:38 - the colors
05:39 - um try the with different and just
05:42 - play with it this is the only way you
05:44 - can learn python
05:46 - and other than that
05:50 - see you guys in my next video make sure
05:52 - to subscribe to join our family and to
05:53 - be a mini programmer
05:55 - and just like this video if you enjoyed
05:58 - it
05:58 - and keep programming kids and i'll see
06:00 - you guys next time on programming kids
06:03 - bye for now
06:06 - [Applause]
06:09 - you
