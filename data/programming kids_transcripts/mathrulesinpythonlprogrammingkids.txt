00:04 - hey
00:04 - guys i'm sarah and welcome to
00:06 - programming kids
00:08 - and today's video i'll be teaching you
00:11 - matthews in python so what are you
00:13 - waiting for
00:14 - grab your notebook or a cup of tea and
00:17 - let's get into it
00:19 - so first you will be talking about the
00:21 - simple operator
00:22 - so in math is important in python
00:24 - operator we use the same addition sign
00:26 - or plus sign
00:28 - and also in subtraction we use the same
00:31 - minus sign or subtraction sign
00:33 - but in multiplication and math simple we
00:36 - use the multiplication samples and bison
00:38 - operator we use the star sign which is
00:40 - called the asterix
00:42 - and division and math simple we use the
00:45 - addition sign button bison operator to
00:47 - use the pack slash sign
00:49 - and for exponent and base symbol we use
00:53 - since the power of two and then by
00:55 - celebrate we use star star for
00:58 - parentheses we use the same
00:59 - parentheses
01:03 - an example for addition four plus two is
01:06 - equal to six
01:07 - an example for subtract subtraction
01:10 - four minus 2 is equal to 2 and example 4
01:13 - multiplication
01:15 - 4 multiply by 2 is equal to 8 and
01:18 - an example for division 4 divided by 2
01:21 - is equal to 2.0
01:23 - example for 4 to the power of 2 is equal
01:27 - to 16
01:28 - and an example for parentheses
01:30 - parenthesis four plus two parentheses
01:32 - multiplied by three
01:34 - is equal to eighteen order of operation
01:38 - multiplication and division comes before
01:40 - addition and subtraction
01:42 - so i'm going to give you an example what
01:44 - if we said
01:45 - to multiply by five plus five we said
01:48 - that multiplication and
01:50 - division comes before addition and
01:52 - subtraction
01:53 - so first we have to multiply and then we
01:55 - add
01:56 - so what does 2 multiply by 5 is equal to
02:00 - 10 and then 10 plus 5 is equal to 15 so
02:04 - the answer is 15.
02:09 - order of operation continued so
02:12 - multiplication
02:13 - and division have the same precedence
02:16 - subtraction and addition have the same
02:18 - precedence
02:19 - so it means that multiplication and
02:22 - division comes before
02:23 - subtraction and addition python
02:27 - calculates from the left one by one to
02:29 - the right so it means that
02:30 - python calculates from the left one way
02:34 - one to the right
02:36 - parentheses we can use parenthesis to
02:39 - control the order of operation
02:42 - we can put parentheses around the part
02:44 - of the calculation we would like
02:45 - performed first
02:47 - a syntax error so here
02:50 - if you if you write five multiply by two
02:54 - equal you will get a syntax error
02:57 - and if you write 52 divided by 43
03:00 - will give you the answer so and by then
03:03 - if you
03:04 - if you write like an example if you
03:07 - write like
03:08 - um 43 divided by let's say
03:12 - 43 divided by 55 and biting and
03:17 - you didn't add the equal signs will give
03:19 - you the answer
03:20 - but if you wrote in python five multiple
03:23 - i by
03:24 - tu equal will give you a syntax error
03:27 - so i hope you learned some i hope you
03:30 - learned something in new
