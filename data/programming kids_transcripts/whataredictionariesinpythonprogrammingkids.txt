00:05 - hello programmers my name is sarah and
00:07 - today we're going to learn about
00:08 - dictionaries so
00:10 - let's get started by the end of this
00:12 - video you will understand the meaning of
00:14 - mapping understand what are dictionaries
00:17 - and their rules
00:18 - understand the differences between lists
00:20 - and dictionaries
00:22 - apply this concept into the jupiter
00:24 - notebook you will test your knowledge by
00:26 - taking a mini quiz
00:28 - what are mappings mappings are a
00:31 - collection of objects that are stored by
00:33 - a key
00:34 - what are dictionaries dictionaries are
00:37 - an order mapping for storing
00:39 - objects dictionaries is a key value
00:42 - and also in dictionaries use curly
00:45 - braces and columns to signify the key
00:47 - and their associated values
00:50 - what are the differences between the
00:52 - list and the dictionaries
00:54 - dictionaries objects utilized by key
00:57 - name
00:58 - and they are unordered while list object
01:00 - retrieved
01:01 - by location and order sequence can be
01:04 - indexed or sized
01:07 - let's hop into our entrepreneur notebook
01:09 - and explore more about dictionaries
01:12 - as jupiter notebook is very recalled on
01:14 - if you want to know more about them
01:16 - click click the link in the i the corner
01:18 - or click the link in the description box
01:23 - so that's the jupiter notebook so first
01:26 - we're going to start by creating a
01:28 - dictionary so i'm going to name it as
01:30 - animal dictionary
01:35 - animal dictionary which is equal to we
01:39 - can add curly braces
01:41 - and i'm gonna say a rat
01:46 - so there is one rat
01:50 - then i'm going to say a dog so irat is
01:52 - the string here as you can see
01:55 - let us say that there is three dogs i'm
01:58 - gonna run that
02:01 - so now if i want to see
02:04 - how many rats are there say animal
02:10 - animal dishonesty how many rats are
02:12 - there so use brackets and say rats
02:16 - run that and that will get one now i'm
02:19 - going to give you another example
02:21 - let us see that i went to an animal shop
02:23 - and there was a cat a bird and a dog
02:25 - a cat cost 70 and a bread cost 90
02:28 - and the dog cost 120 so say
02:31 - prices which is equal to curly braces
02:37 - say a cat
02:42 - 70
02:47 - a braid
02:53 - bridge is 90 and uh
02:56 - dog that is 120.
03:03 - so now i'm going to run that and if i
03:05 - want to know how
03:07 - what's the price of a cat as we did
03:09 - we're just going to say
03:10 - prices brackets
03:14 - cut will be 70. if i want to know what's
03:18 - the price of a dog i'm just going to say
03:19 - prices brackets dog
03:24 - i'm going to run that i will get 120.
03:28 - so now also in a dictionary we can add
03:30 - list strings and integers
03:32 - so let me show you an example i'm going
03:34 - to create a dictionary
03:36 - i'll name it as my dictionary which is
03:39 - equal to curly braces
03:42 - let us say a good
03:46 - a girl there's one good we're gonna say
03:52 - come on and we're gonna say boy now let
03:54 - us say that there is three boys so
03:56 - these three numbers we're gonna put them
03:59 - in a list
04:01 - so
04:07 - and let's say mom mom got a drink
04:19 - colin drink
04:25 - so now we're gonna run that so now
04:29 - now if i want to know how many boys are
04:31 - there i'm just gonna say
04:32 - my dick boy
04:39 - we're gonna run that we'll get one two
04:42 - three
04:43 - now if i want to know what did the
04:45 - mother got
04:47 - so i'm just gonna say my
04:50 - my dick
04:53 - mom i'll get garter chain but what if i
04:56 - want the input to be mom
04:58 - got and the output i want it to be drink
05:00 - so i'm just gonna here put the brackets
05:02 - and write your guts
05:08 - so the answer will be drink
05:12 - so and then if i want to make a letter
05:15 - and uppercase
05:17 - so let me just create a dictionary so
05:20 - i'm going to name it as
05:22 - d is equal to
05:26 - abc i'm going to add
05:30 - quotation marks
05:35 - and add quotation marks and say colin
05:43 - a
05:46 - a b and c
05:49 - as you can see guys so what if i want to
05:52 - make
05:53 - the c an uppercase so
05:56 - we're going to run that and now to make
05:59 - a be an uppercase we're going to create
06:00 - a list and we'll name it as my list
06:03 - which is equal to
06:07 - d
06:10 - the abc i'm gonna run that
06:16 - now we're gonna say letter
06:19 - that which is equal to my list
06:27 - my list and i want an indexing
06:31 - indexing of two
06:36 - so
06:39 - indexing of two i will run that
06:44 - and now we'll say letter.upper
06:51 - letter dot upper
06:59 - so now let me run that we'll get c
07:02 - now to make it more easy than doing all
07:05 - these steps
07:06 - we're just gonna say d
07:11 - stand for dictionary and then say
07:16 - abc and i wanted an indexing of two
07:21 - and then dot upper
07:27 - you're gonna put parentheses and run
07:30 - that
07:31 - we'll get c so now i want also to
07:35 - discuss with you guys how to add a
07:37 - value to a dictionary so i'm just going
07:39 - to create a dictionary i will say
07:41 - d is equal to let's see a pen
07:47 - a pin that's caused for like two dollars
07:50 - you can say
07:56 - chroma and also a box
08:01 - that cost five
08:05 - as you guys can see i'm gonna run that
08:08 - and
08:09 - now if we said
08:13 - we'll get it
08:16 - now if i want to change we said a pen
08:20 - is two but it's in numbers what if i
08:22 - want to change it to
08:24 - values to letters so we're going to say
08:27 - d d box
08:33 - we'll say which is equal to 2.
08:38 - so now i'm going to run it meet pen
08:44 - we're going to run that now if we said
08:49 - d we'll get pen as
08:52 - 2. lectures not numbers
08:56 - now guys the last thing i want to
08:59 - discuss with you guys
09:02 - is how to grab all the numbers how to
09:04 - grab all the
09:06 - let keys and values
09:09 - so i'm just gonna copy this again
09:13 - so just write it again b
09:16 - d is equal to
09:21 - pen
09:27 - this which is equal to two point zero
09:30 - zero
09:34 - to one zero and then we set up
09:37 - a box that cost for
09:40 - five so let's say five now we will
09:44 - run that now to get all the
09:47 - keys we're just going to say t dot keys
09:55 - and to get all the values we're just
09:57 - going to say d dot values
10:04 - to the value value we're gonna run that
10:16 - and then we're gonna do the item so
10:20 - t dot items
10:24 - run that and we get t dot items
10:30 - so
10:32 - okay guys stick to your knowledge on
10:34 - dictionaries
10:37 - question one dictionaries retain order
10:40 - and are a sequence is that true or false
10:44 - pause this video think about the answer
10:46 - and then when you are ready and post it
10:48 - again
10:49 - correct the answer is false because
10:52 - dictionaries are an ordered sequence
10:55 - question two what do i type to get the
10:58 - number of values
10:59 - either values these are items or
11:01 - detailed keys
11:03 - post this video think about the answers
11:05 - and then when you are ready and post it
11:06 - again
11:08 - correct the answer is jesus values
11:13 - question three in a dictionary can we
11:15 - add lists
11:16 - strings and integers is that true
11:19 - or false pause this view think about the
11:21 - answer and then when you are ready and
11:23 - pause it again
11:25 - correct the answer is true
11:28 - okay guys thank you guys for watching i
