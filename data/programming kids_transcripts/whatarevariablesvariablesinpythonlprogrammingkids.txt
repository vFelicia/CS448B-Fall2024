00:02 - hello programmers
00:03 - welcome or welcome back to programming
00:05 - kids my name is lynn
00:07 - and today we are going to learn about
00:09 - variables
00:11 - variables are used to store information
00:13 - in
00:15 - but in order to name something
00:19 - you have to follow some rules one it's
00:22 - gonna start with number
00:24 - two it should have no spaces you can use
00:26 - an under
00:27 - score instead three it should not
00:29 - include any symbols such as these
00:35 - four it should contain lowercase letters
00:39 - five it cannot be a data type example
00:41 - string tuple or whatever
00:44 - because for example if you use tuple is
00:46 - equal to subscribe
00:48 - it will give you an error because data
00:51 - types cannot be used as variables
00:55 - python uses dynamic typing meaning you
00:58 - can reassign variables to this
01:00 - to different data types this makes
01:03 - python very flexible in assigning data
01:05 - types
01:05 - and it differs from other languages that
01:08 - are statically typed
01:10 - now there are pros and cons of dynamic
01:12 - typing
01:13 - the pros is that it's very easy to work
01:16 - with and it's
01:17 - it's a faster development time it will
01:19 - be less time consuming for you
01:22 - the cons of dynamic typing is that it
01:25 - may result in unexpected bugs and you
01:27 - need to be aware of the type
01:30 - now in order to assign variables you
01:32 - need to use a single equal sign which is
01:35 - an assignment operator
01:39 - further on the video we're going to use
01:41 - the type function which will
01:43 - give you the ability to see what data
01:46 - type
01:47 - this variable is
01:50 - so what are we waiting for let's explore
01:53 - these concepts
01:54 - on our jupiter notebook
01:59 - so here i am on my jupiter notebook
02:04 - and we are going to start
02:07 - using our variable concepts that we
02:10 - learned
02:11 - so for example let me assign a
02:14 - as a number what do you guys think
02:17 - a should be how about 10 so
02:21 - 10 so
02:24 - yeah i have a this is my variable and
02:27 - it's storing
02:28 - inside a 10. so let's run this
02:31 - and let's check what is a
02:34 - 10 how about wait i changed my mind
02:39 - i want to do a as
02:43 - 15 now let's try running
02:47 - 8 15. so
02:50 - basically i am reassigning
02:53 - and this is dynamic typing
02:56 - it's really flexible and it's really
03:04 - okay next we are going to try to do
03:07 - a plus
03:11 - oh sorry a
03:15 - plus a 30
03:18 - you might be wondering what just
03:20 - happened well
03:22 - i said last time that a is 15 so what
03:25 - python did what
03:27 - added 15 plus 15 which is 30.
03:30 - let's try a
03:35 - times a
03:40 - 225 that was really quick and it's
03:43 - really smart
03:45 - how about a division sign what what will
03:48 - happen if i divide
03:49 - a by a let's see a divided by eight
03:54 - 1.0 that's correct
03:58 - hmm how about we try our
04:02 - oh
04:05 - let's try our percentage time
04:08 - which is our month we're gonna try that
04:13 - so let's see if there's any remainder
04:15 - than this zero remainders that is
04:17 - absolutely correct
04:19 - python is very smart
04:22 - now let's try to type a
04:26 - is equal to 0.5
04:31 - and the strength is now let's check
04:33 - again
04:35 - perfect now i want to know what type is
04:38 - a
04:38 - like what's what's the type so let's
04:42 - do this and inside it i'll put the a
04:45 - and run it's a float in our last video
04:49 - we learned about all data types so this
04:51 - is right because it includes a
04:54 - decimal point now let's say i want to
04:57 - reassign it again
04:59 - and this time this is my value
05:02 - let's run it one two three
05:06 - okay but what's the type again check
05:12 - a it's integer correct let's try
05:15 - a is equal to subscribe
05:20 - [Music]
05:22 - with and brackets
05:30 - all right let's run
05:34 - a subscribe let's try
05:38 - check the type string
05:41 - that's right now that we have practiced
05:45 - naming our variables let me give you an
05:48 - exercise so
05:51 - i want to calculate my taxes
05:54 - like my total taxes per month so
05:58 - let's say my income
06:02 - is a hundred
06:06 - and my tax
06:11 - my tax
06:14 - is 0.1
06:18 - basically ten percent so yeah
06:22 - and i want to find my total
06:31 - so how can i find my total if i have
06:33 - these two
06:34 - you're going to have to multiply
06:39 - my income
06:44 - by my tax
06:52 - so now let's see what's my total
06:59 - and it's 10.0 because what python did
07:02 - is multiply 100 by 0.1
07:06 - you can also do this
07:13 - 100 multiplied by 0.1
07:18 - is 10. meaning that python is correct
07:21 - so guys that's it for this video i hope
07:23 - you guys understood
07:25 - variables and their usage if you have
07:28 - any questions make sure to comment that
07:29 - down below
07:30 - and i'll be happy to answer you
