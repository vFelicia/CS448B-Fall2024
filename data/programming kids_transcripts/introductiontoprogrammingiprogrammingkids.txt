00:00 - [Music]
00:02 - my name is lean
00:03 - and in today's video i'll be giving you
00:06 - an introduction to a programming
00:08 - language
00:09 - so i'm going to be differentiating
00:12 - between programming language and
00:14 - computer program
00:15 - as well as giving you applications of
00:17 - programming language
00:19 - so before we start make sure to grab
00:21 - your notebook
00:22 - or some tea or snack and let's get
00:25 - started
00:27 - so let's just describe
00:31 - programming in few simple words
00:34 - so remember programming is a formal
00:37 - language which is used to communicate
00:38 - with
00:39 - computers based on instructions and
00:41 - commands
00:42 - while computer program is set of
00:45 - instructions that we give to a computer
00:47 - to tell them what to do let me repeat
00:50 - that
00:51 - programming is a formal language while
00:54 - computer program is set of instructions
00:59 - here are some examples of programming
01:01 - applications
01:02 - first we have fortran and fortran is
01:05 - used for
01:06 - mainly projects like designing bridges
01:09 - or airplane structures even analyzes
01:13 - scientific data fortune isn't really
01:15 - used by kids like you
01:17 - mainly for professional usage so
01:20 - you don't have to worry about that but
01:23 - next we have
01:24 - cobol kobul is also known as c plus and
01:26 - is it you can use this for developing
01:28 - games desk
01:29 - fabs and even operating systems c plus
01:32 - plus can allow you to divide
01:34 - complex problems into smallers using
01:36 - objects
01:38 - and then next we have python python is
01:40 - one of the programming languages with
01:42 - the highest levels
01:43 - it allows you to create applications and
01:45 - websites and few steps
01:47 - python can allow you to create
01:50 - literally anything you want you can make
01:53 - an app an application
01:55 - or a website even you can use python to
01:58 - um get to like develop your
02:02 - hacking skills python is really
02:04 - interesting and it's really
02:06 - easy for usage so
02:09 - let's talk a little bit more about
02:11 - python
02:12 - so why should you learn python python is
02:15 - not only one of the highest levels of
02:16 - programming
02:17 - but also gives the user flexibility to
02:19 - create complex tasks in a few
02:22 - simple steps if you look to python work
02:24 - for creating an
02:25 - app it might look like a disaster it
02:28 - might look really hard for you
02:30 - but if you actually understand what each
02:33 - of these um
02:35 - simple keyword that you put into the
02:38 - ideal shell what
02:39 - what do they mean it's going to be
02:41 - really easy
02:44 - so here are some advantages of python
02:46 - python is quick and efficient user
02:48 - friendly and
02:49 - even gives you that flexibility to
02:51 - create graphics and animations in very
02:53 - few simple steps
02:56 - python can also give import at torture
02:59 - modules for kids learning and beginners
03:02 - if you guys are excited to create your
03:05 - own python
03:06 - um animation then make sure to stay
03:09 - tuned for the future videos
03:11 - where i'm going to be teaching you guys
03:14 - how to
03:14 - install python and importing one of your
03:17 - first commands
03:18 - into the python shell so um
03:22 - i hope you guys enjoyed this video and
03:24 - learned a lot
03:25 - please make sure to like this and and
03:27 - subscribe to the channel

03:45 - you can also find our powerpoint in the
03:48 - um
03:49 - in the description box and some more
03:51 - information
03:52 - so yeah keep programming and i'll see
03:55 - you guys next time on programming kids
03:57 - bye for now
04:00 - [Music]
04:02 - you
