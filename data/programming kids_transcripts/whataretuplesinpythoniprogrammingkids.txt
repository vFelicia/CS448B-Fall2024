00:00 - [Music]
00:04 - hello programmers my name is lin
00:06 - and in today's video i will be teaching
00:08 - you about tuples and python
00:10 - by the end of this video you will
00:12 - understand the meaning of immutability
00:14 - you will understand the rules of tuples
00:16 - you will understand the difference
00:18 - between tuples and lists and the common
00:20 - things between them
00:22 - you will understand the whole point of
00:23 - tuples compared to lists
00:25 - and you will apply all of these concepts
00:28 - into the jupiter notebook
00:29 - as well as taking a mini quiz at the end
00:31 - to test your knowledge
00:33 - so what are tuples tuples are said to be
00:37 - immutable meaning they cannot be changed
00:39 - and they are always constant
00:41 - and you can use tuples to represent
00:44 - constant information for example the
00:46 - number of days in a week
00:47 - or the number of months in a year or etc
00:51 - the difference between tuples and lists
00:54 - now tuples and lisps are extremely
00:56 - similar
00:58 - however tuples are constant immutable
01:00 - and they cannot be changed
01:02 - and they use parentheses while lisps are
01:07 - there they can be changed in many ways
01:09 - such as by reassigning
01:10 - and they use square brackets if you
01:13 - don't know
01:14 - much about lisps make sure to check the
01:16 - video in the eye in the corner
01:18 - and i will be linking it in the
01:19 - description box in case
01:22 - next is the common things between lisps
01:24 - and tuples
01:25 - i'm just going to refresh your mind
01:27 - about them now they both use commas
01:29 - in order to separate objects and you can
01:32 - use
01:32 - variety of data types on both of them
01:35 - they both use the liane function
01:37 - which is used to count the number of
01:39 - items in the list or tuple
01:41 - and they both support indexing and
01:44 - slicing
01:45 - again if you don't know about indexing
01:47 - and slicing i will be linking
01:48 - a video in the i in the corner and in
01:51 - the description box
01:54 - now what's the whole point of tuples
01:56 - when you have lists
01:57 - and lists actually have even more
02:00 - methods way more methods compared
02:02 - to tuples well tuples aren't often used
02:06 - in programming
02:07 - but it's extremely important to use them
02:10 - when you need something to be immutable
02:12 - and it's constant that will never
02:14 - change so guys let's hop into our
02:19 - jupiter notebook and explore these
02:21 - concepts
02:22 - see you there all right guys here we are
02:26 - in our jupiter notebook
02:28 - now i'm going to be creating a tuple
02:31 - i'm going to call it t and i'm going to
02:33 - use parentheses and i'm going to make a
02:35 - tuple of integers
02:36 - but of course you can use any type of
02:38 - data type and you can even mix them
02:40 - together
02:42 - okay perfect now let's try it out
02:48 - all right perfect now um as i said
02:50 - before
02:51 - lists have way more special fun creative
02:55 - methods that you can use
02:57 - but here is one example that is used in
03:00 - tuples
03:01 - the first one or the one that we have is
03:04 - index and it's used to find
03:07 - the index of a number so what you have
03:10 - to do is
03:11 - the d dot index and parenthesis inside
03:14 - the parentheses
03:16 - you should put the value that you need
03:19 - so for example one the index of that is
03:22 - zero
03:23 - if you put two the index oh
03:27 - index of that is one and
03:30 - three two and so on
03:33 - okay now i'm going to be explaining
03:36 - about
03:36 - immutability furthermore so let's say
03:40 - the same list i have t if i want to add
03:46 - zero let's run it let's see what it
03:49 - gives
03:49 - us
03:53 - oh yeah this is the index again but if
03:55 - we say
03:56 - t.0 and we say equal to change
04:00 - because i'm adding change round it gives
04:03 - me
04:03 - error what about using the append
04:06 - function
04:07 - so in our last videos we learned
04:10 - that append is a function that is used
04:13 - to add an item to a list or
04:15 - to tuple or a dictionary or whatever
04:18 - so let's try it t dot append
04:22 - let's see if it works with tuples and i
04:25 - want to add
04:28 - one it gives me
04:31 - er and this is proof that
04:35 - two pools are immutable
04:38 - okay guys so that's all for the basics
04:41 - of tuples
04:42 - let's go back to our slides and we're
04:44 - going to test your knowledge by taking a
04:46 - mini quiz
04:47 - see you there
04:51 - okay programmers let's test your
04:53 - knowledge
04:54 - i will be giving you three questions and
04:56 - you should answer them
04:58 - the first question is compared to lisps
05:02 - tuples have way more methods associated
05:04 - with them
05:05 - is that true or false
05:08 - pause this video think about it and
05:10 - unpause it when you're ready
05:15 - and the correct answer is false as we
05:18 - said before
05:19 - tuples have less methods associated with
05:22 - them
05:23 - compared to lists okay
05:26 - question number two lists can change and
05:29 - you can reassign them
05:31 - while two poles are immutable and
05:33 - therefore can't be
05:34 - changed is that true or is that
05:38 - false pause this video
05:41 - think about it and unpause it when
05:43 - you're ready
05:45 - and the correct answer is true
05:49 - because as i said before two pulls are
05:51 - immutable
05:52 - and they are constant and last question
05:56 - which of the following is the tube you
05:59 - have
05:59 - some options so pause this video
06:03 - think about it and unpause it when you
06:05 - have the answer
06:08 - and the correct answer is this because
06:12 - we you should have parentheses
06:15 - from the beginning to the end so
06:18 - the first one is wrong the second one is
06:20 - wrong and the
06:21 - third and the third one is wrong because
06:23 - both square and parentheses are used
06:26 - so we're gonna go with the fourth one
06:30 - all right guys that's it for this video
06:32 - i hope you enjoyed it
06:33 - make sure to like subscribe and turn the
06:36 - notification ball on to get notified
06:38 - when we upload a new video
06:40 - keep programming and i'll see you guys
06:42 - next time on programming kids
06:43 - bye for now
06:49 - you
