00:02 - [Music]
00:04 - hello programmers
00:05 - welcome or welcome back to programming
00:07 - kids
00:08 - my name is lynn today i'll give you guys
00:11 - a brief introduction about data types
00:14 - whether it's an app a software or
00:16 - website you need to know about data
00:18 - types in order to create that
00:21 - by the end of this video you will have a
00:23 - brief idea about data types
00:25 - you'll be able to define each you will
00:28 - know there's
00:28 - the short format for each you'll be able
00:31 - to give examples
00:32 - and understand the meaning of
00:34 - immutability
00:36 - so in python we have two types of
00:38 - numbers one is integers
00:40 - and the other is floating point
00:44 - these will make up our data type along
00:46 - with many others such as strings
00:48 - lists dictionaries tuples sets and
00:51 - booleans
00:53 - integers are whole numbers with no
00:55 - decimal point
00:57 - the short format is int examples are
01:01 - 1 billion 1034 670
01:06 - literally any number that does not
01:08 - include a decimal point
01:11 - the other hand floating point are
01:13 - completely the opposite
01:15 - these are numbers with decimal points
01:18 - short format is floats and examples are
01:20 - 1 billion point 0
01:22 - 100.0 3.4 5678.9
01:29 - strings are ordered sequence of
01:31 - characters
01:32 - the short format is str examples are
01:37 - hello lynn sarah
01:40 - 200.34 10 etc
01:44 - lists are pretty similar except that
01:47 - maybe
01:48 - this can include
01:51 - diff uh they include curly braces while
01:55 - strings include parentheses but we're
01:58 - going to talk
01:59 - more about the differentiating in
02:00 - another separate video
02:03 - the short format for lists is lists
02:06 - examples are 10 hello and 200.3
02:11 - dictionaries on are unordered unordered
02:14 - key
02:15 - with a value pair and they include
02:17 - columns
02:18 - the short format is dict
02:22 - so this is an example we have curly
02:25 - braces
02:26 - and then we have my key the my key is
02:28 - name and the value is length
02:31 - geofools are ordered immutable sequence
02:34 - objects
02:35 - the short format is cube and examples
02:38 - are
02:39 - 10 hello 200.4 now
02:42 - if you didn't get what i mean by
02:44 - immutable i mean that
02:46 - once you create this tuple you cannot
02:49 - replace any element
02:50 - or you cannot reassign any element
02:53 - because
02:53 - it's immutable for example if you have
02:57 - the word hello
02:58 - and you'd like to change the o to e
03:03 - by reassigning or replacing
03:05 - unfortunately that doesn't happen in
03:08 - tuples
03:09 - along with many other data types
03:12 - sets are unordered collection of unique
03:15 - objects the short format is set
03:19 - and examples include a b c d e
03:22 - f g h i j k etc
03:25 - any alphabet booleans
03:29 - are logical value indicating true or
03:32 - false
03:33 - so for example you can ask python
03:38 - is 5 greater than 3 and they'll answer
03:41 - you
03:42 - true or false the short format is bool
03:47 - this is a summary for today's lesson
03:50 - there are some extra examples
03:52 - with the description with the with the
03:56 - short format and the definition and
03:58 - everything you need to know
04:00 - i hope you guys enjoyed this video we're
04:02 - going to go through
04:04 - each one of these data types in detail
04:06 - in our next video
04:07 - so make sure to subscribe and turn that
04:09 - notification bell on so that you can get
04:11 - notified when we upload that video
04:14 - give this video a big thumbs up and if
04:16 - you have any questions
04:18 - ask them in the comments section so that
04:21 - we can reply and we can clear it out
04:24 - thanks for watching keep programming and
04:26 - i'll see you guys next time on
04:27 - programming kids
04:28 - bye for now
