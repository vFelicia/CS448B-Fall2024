00:03 - welcome to programming tips
00:05 - my name is lynn and in today's video we
00:08 - will be creating a really cool
00:10 - turtle instead of that um arrow
00:14 - that you guys when you import it
00:17 - having this kind of turtle is really
00:20 - really cool
00:21 - and more interesting than the
00:24 - sign that you guys really import turtle
00:26 - and
00:27 - i know that you guys might be like this
00:30 - is hard
00:31 - but trust me all you have to do is
00:34 - learn one or two codes
00:38 - anyways make sure to grab a notebook or
00:40 - cup of tea and
00:41 - let's get started okay let's start by
00:44 - opening either
00:46 - and um opening a new file so press
00:49 - file new file and name your program
00:53 - so i'll name it as third as my turn
00:58 - dot py okay so this is just for me
01:02 - python skips this completely all right
01:05 - now we'll have to import created
01:07 - which is the mini program in python to
01:09 - show your graphics
01:11 - and what actually happens that python
01:13 - opens python launcher
01:15 - to view all of our graphic and then
01:18 - we'll have to name it so i'll name it as
01:21 - t is equal to thirty
01:25 - dot journal and
01:28 - put in your brackets and press enter
01:30 - then
01:31 - we will start choosing a color for our
01:35 - program or our character so t dot color
01:41 - and i'll use blue
01:44 - make sure to put in your quotations
01:50 - and we'll try saving it right now and
01:53 - running and i'll show you
01:55 - if i don't put the last code what
01:56 - happens all right i'll save it on my
01:59 - desktop just so i can view it
02:00 - later and i'll save it as dirt
02:04 - as my turtle
02:09 - as you guys can see python automatically
02:12 - saves it
02:12 - over here all right let's try running it
02:17 - here it is so nothing really happens at
02:19 - this really boring
02:21 - um arrow comes in let's try putting in
02:24 - the last thing which is the shape so
02:26 - i'll type
02:27 - see dot shape and open up my brackets
02:30 - and
02:30 - put in my question what shape do you
02:32 - think this turtle is
02:34 - well let me answer you the shape is
02:45 - that's it guys you'll have to run this
02:47 - right now
02:50 - and so you can always change the color
02:54 - and put it yours
02:55 - and you can even create different shapes
02:57 - with it so for example let's try
03:01 - drawing a square so i'll type in my code
03:04 - for i in range
03:08 - and i'll put in the range
03:16 - all right put in my column because this
03:18 - is a loop and then
03:20 - i want her to move um forward
03:29 - 150 steps and the angle is 90 degrees
03:33 - because it's
03:34 - a square a right angle
03:41 - all right now let's try running
03:48 - whoa my turtle is amazing at drawing
03:53 - that's it for today's video i hope you
03:55 - guys enjoyed
03:56 - that little turtle and i'll

04:06 - first to view my videos
04:07 - as well as liking this video if you like
04:11 - this program
04:13 - programming and i'll see you guys next
04:15 - time on programming kids
04:20 - bye
