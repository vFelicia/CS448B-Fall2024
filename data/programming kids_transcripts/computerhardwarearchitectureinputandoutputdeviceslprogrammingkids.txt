00:07 - hello programmers
00:09 - welcome back to programming kids
00:12 - in today's video you'll be learning
00:14 - about
00:15 - hardware architecture the aim of this
00:18 - video is to give you a brief idea about
00:22 - parts for computer and their functions
00:25 - so what are we waiting for let's get
00:28 - started
00:33 - here's a fun fact mobile phones tablets
00:36 - laptops smart watches and televisions
00:39 - are all computers
00:44 - all right let's start with input and
00:47 - output devices
00:49 - an input simply is data that a computer
00:53 - receives
00:55 - an output is data that a computer sends
00:59 - examples for input devices
01:03 - camera keyboard controller
01:08 - mouse microphone and remote control
01:13 - examples for output devices
01:17 - speaker monitor
01:21 - headphones and
01:25 - here's printer interesting one alexa
01:28 - it's similar to zero on iphone devices
01:31 - we call their name and they respond
01:34 - alexa is both an input and output device
01:38 - because it has microphone and speaker
01:41 - a microphone is used to record what are
01:43 - we saying
01:45 - and a speaker to answer us
01:48 - now i will be showing you the computer's
01:51 - main components as a diagram
01:54 - this is how the arrangement of our
01:56 - computer is
02:01 - input devices
02:04 - processor and internal memory devices
02:08 - output devices and secondary storage
02:11 - devices
02:15 - alright so you might be wondering
02:18 - what is main memory and how does it
02:22 - differ
02:23 - from a secondary memory so let me
02:26 - explain
02:27 - main memory a main memory is a small
02:30 - temporary
02:31 - storage lost on reboot also known as ram
02:36 - secondary memory
02:40 - it is slow large permanent storage
02:43 - latched until deleted example disk drive
02:47 - or memory stick
02:53 - here's a fun fact the computer has a
02:56 - hardware
02:57 - called cpu central processing unit
03:02 - which runs programs they are always
03:05 - waiting
03:06 - for instructions and asking
03:10 - what's next
03:13 - anyways y'all that's it for today's
03:16 - video
03:17 - i really hope to learn something new
03:20 - make sure to like
03:21 - subscribe and turn the notification bell
03:24 - on to get notified
03:25 - every time we upload a new video keep
03:28 - programming and we'll see you
03:30 - all next time on programming kids bye
03:33 - for now
