00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to show code
00:02 - in this video I'll be teaching you how
00:04 - to write to a file in Python last video
00:07 - we covered how to read from a file if
00:09 - you haven't seen that make sure you go
00:10 - and watch it for playlist link is in the
00:12 - description okay so I've got a text file
00:15 - here it's just got some sample text in
00:18 - it but we're going to write too and now
00:20 - let's open a file it'll just create a
00:23 - new file let's create a string variable
00:25 - so just sample sample text equals new
00:30 - text and then don't forget your
00:33 - backslash n for a new line and then
00:35 - after that we can have some more dummy
00:36 - text here now let's open the file using
00:39 - the open function so file equals open
00:44 - text dot txt which is the name of your
00:47 - text file and then we're going to want
00:49 - to open it in write mode now what this
00:53 - does is it opens a file in write mode
00:54 - but with write mode it completely wipes
00:58 - the file clean before you add anything
01:00 - new to it if you want to learn how to
01:02 - just add some more text on to the end of
01:04 - the file that's appending to a file
01:06 - we're going to be learning about that in
01:08 - the next video so make sure you
01:09 - subscribe and stay tuned to that now
01:12 - let's write to the file with the write
01:13 - function so we'll do file dot write
01:16 - sample text a venerable file dot close
01:21 - and this is important as we learnt in
01:23 - the last video if you're enjoying the
01:25 - video so far please do drop a like it
01:27 - really does help me out let's run it and
01:29 - we don't get any output but if we open
01:32 - up our text file again we can see we got
01:34 - new text and then on a new line these
01:37 - muddled up letters because our dummy
01:39 - text up here was new test and been on a
01:42 - new line this text here ok that's
01:45 - writing to a file I'm going to end the
01:47 - video here if you have any questions or
01:49 - comments leave them down below I'll be
01:50 - sure to help you out if you want to
01:52 - support me well you have to do it's like
