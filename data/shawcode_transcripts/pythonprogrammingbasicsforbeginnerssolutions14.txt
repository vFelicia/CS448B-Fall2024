00:00 - hello everyone and welcome to Shah code
00:02 - today we will be going through all the
00:05 - solutions from the previous four
00:08 - episodes that we've done so in the first
00:12 - episode I set you free challenges and as
00:16 - you can see here these are all the
00:18 - solutions to our first video so the
00:21 - first challenge of the first video was
00:23 - to print outs I love programming in
00:25 - Python and as you can see here we just
00:27 - do print I love programming in Python
00:31 - now for the second challenge it won't
00:35 - you needed to make a program for outputs
00:38 - I will be the best programmer ever but
00:40 - each new word is under new line see you
00:43 - want to print out I will be the best
00:44 - program ever like this but make sure you
00:47 - use three lots of speech marks on the
00:50 - beginning and the end and then each word
00:52 - is on a new line which allows us to do
00:55 - the multi-line print finally make a
00:59 - program for output so poem but each line
01:01 - in the poem is on a new line in the
01:04 - output window so it's literally just the
01:07 - same thing as a here it's just like this
01:10 - three parts of speech monks at the start
01:13 - and a bottom and each line in the poem
01:15 - has a new line in Python if we run it
01:19 - yeah we can see we get our programming
01:22 - in Python which is the first challenge
01:24 - I'll be the best program ever is the
01:27 - second and then finally the poem which
01:32 - is a wonder I wrote myself in its top
01:35 - quality so in the second video I set you
01:38 - free challenges to do the first
01:40 - challenge was to make a program that
01:42 - prints out a variable whether it be a
01:44 - string and integer or a float so here we
01:47 - have a variable called BA it's a string
01:50 - variable it just has a string right here
01:52 - which is high and prints who've R which
01:55 - prints up high secondly you needed to
01:58 - make a program that prints out two
02:00 - variables as strings so we have a
02:02 - variable called var to inside it's got
02:06 - high and var furry which is there I know
02:10 - you have to do is do print bar to bar
02:13 - furry
02:14 - a comma in between and the final
02:17 - challenge was to make a program but adds
02:19 - together an integer and the variable
02:21 - that it's an integer so we can just have
02:24 - var 4 equals 21
02:27 - the name is boffo and the contents is
02:30 - the number 21
02:32 - you just wanted to do print any number I
02:35 - chose 2 plus 4 so if we were in it we
02:40 - get high it relates to this then we also
02:44 - get high there which is the second
02:47 - challenge
02:47 - I've been finally 23 because 21 plus 2
02:50 - is 23
02:52 - now for the third a lot of challenges is
02:54 - at you so for the first one you needed
02:56 - to make a program for adds together to
02:59 - float variables so what you should have
03:02 - done is just created two variables my
03:05 - first one is just called V Bar and the
03:07 - second one is called far to and the
03:09 - contents of those are 2.5 and 5.3 then
03:14 - you just do print var plus Phi 2 or the
03:17 - names of your variable secondly make a
03:21 - program for us together to float
03:22 - variables and then ver and member
03:24 - results is to the 4th power
03:27 - I'm still using these two variables s up
03:30 - here so we just do ba + var - which adds
03:34 - them together then we just use this
03:38 - operator which is for indices to the
03:43 - power of 4 and finally make a program
03:46 - but gets a remainder of 2 float
03:48 - variables then results is flawed divided
03:51 - by a number of your choice so we do ba
03:56 - modulus bar - which gets remainder of 2
04:02 - point 5 divided by 5 point 3 and then we
04:07 - divide that and round it down by 2 so if
04:11 - we run it we get 2.5 plus five point
04:14 - three is seven point eight and then five
04:18 - five point two plus five point three to
04:22 - the fourth power is this large number
04:24 - here
04:26 - then 2 point 5 divided by 5 point 3 4
04:30 - remainder then divided by 2 and round it
04:33 - down is 1 as we can see here and then
04:37 - finally for the fourth video though are
04:40 - also free challenges the first one
04:42 - needed to have two variables that both
04:44 - contain inputs and then H get one number
04:47 - and print out the variables added
04:50 - together now this one is actually quite
04:53 - hard bearing in mind that this is a
04:56 - basic tutorial but I'll explain as best
05:00 - I can so we have two variables later on
05:04 - in the series I'll explain what I'll
05:07 - explain what I'm doing in more detail
05:09 - and we'll cover it and you can
05:12 - understand it more so we've just got two
05:14 - variables here bar and bar - we both
05:16 - have inputs number 1 and number 2 and we
05:20 - want to print ba + VAR - what I've got
05:24 - here is this int this in statement and
05:28 - it surrounds Vivar and Vivar to know
05:32 - what what would happen if we didn't use
05:34 - this int ba if we just did friend print
05:39 - BA plus ba - what would happen is if we
05:44 - run it we're getting them born I don't
05:46 - know five number - seven and here we get
05:50 - 57 because what it's doing here is it's
05:54 - got five and seven as strings and it's
05:57 - just shoved those two together to get 57
06:00 - because in the input five is a string
06:04 - and seven is a string and we've just
06:07 - shoved it right together to get 57 if
06:09 - you don't understand this at the moment
06:11 - it doesn't matter we'll cover it in a
06:13 - later video
06:13 - so we've just come what we've done here
06:17 - is we've converted it into an integer
06:19 - and if we look back here converting it
06:23 - into an integer
06:23 - five plus seven as integers is 12
06:27 - all right for the second challenge you
06:29 - need to have two input variables ask for
06:31 - two words and then prints them out
06:32 - together in one print statement so what
06:36 - we have here is I don't know var 3
06:38 - equals input world 1
06:40 - weÂ´d one that involve all equals input
06:43 - would - and then we just print buffering
06:46 - bar for so if we go like this make sure
06:49 - Tavia commerce but in bar as well to
06:52 - separate them out word one hello there
06:57 - hello there
06:59 - and then finally the third challenge
07:02 - have three input variables asking
07:04 - different questions and then print your
07:07 - answers were and then all the answers um
07:09 - puts it in one print statement so we
07:13 - just have three lots of variables asking
07:15 - three different questions variable name
07:17 - q1 q2 and q3 we all hold input
07:21 - statements all asking different
07:24 - questions and then finally it does print
07:28 - your answers were and then separated by
07:31 - commas to give a little space q1 q2 q3
07:35 - so if we were in it what is your name
07:39 - okay loud voice five time 315 what's
07:43 - your favorite programming language -
07:45 - Python your answers were Caleb 15 and
07:49 - Python so that's all for today guys it
07:51 - was just the solutions for episodes one
07:54 - to four make sure to stay tuned by
07:56 - subscribing and hitting the bell so you
07:58 - won't miss any of the next ones also
08:00 - drop a like if this helped you out it
08:02 - helps me out a lot
08:03 - if you have any questions about Python
08:05 - or the solutions to any of these or need
08:08 - any help with any areas or anything be
