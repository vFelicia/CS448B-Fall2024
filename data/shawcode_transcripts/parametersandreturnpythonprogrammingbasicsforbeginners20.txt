00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to short
00:02 - code
00:03 - today I'm going to be teaching you what
00:05 - function parameters are how to use them
00:07 - and I will also be showing you how to at
00:09 - use return statements by the end of this
00:12 - video you will be able to make your
00:13 - functions a lot more useful so last
00:16 - video we learnt about functions in this
00:19 - video we will be learning about
00:20 - parameters so premises allow us to give
00:24 - information to the function from other
00:26 - parts of our program ok so let's get
00:28 - into some programming okay so let's just
00:31 - create a new function let's do define
00:34 - multiplication then two brackets but
00:40 - then we want to put in here num number
00:43 - one and number two okay so now we've got
00:47 - that let's do print print number one is
00:54 - number one print number two is number
01:02 - two and then if we just call the
01:05 - function let's do five more then we were
01:15 - in it and we get number one is five and
01:17 - number two is four so let's add a little
01:20 - bit more to this and I will explain it
01:21 - once we've finished
01:22 - so we'll do product equals number one
01:28 - times number two print the product is
01:36 - product
01:40 - okay and then we were in that number one
01:43 - is five number two is four for product
01:46 - is 20 because 5 times 4 is 20 basically
01:50 - this is our placeholder and then when we
01:52 - call it these placeholders get replaced
01:54 - by the numbers five and four five four
01:57 - and then print number one is five print
02:00 - number two is four products equals five
02:03 - times four print four products is 20 so
02:06 - we could change these to let's say eight
02:09 - and two number one is eight number two
02:13 - is two the product is 16 now let's talk
02:16 - about getting data back from a function
02:19 - we have given our function some data and
02:21 - now let's get the function to give us
02:23 - some so to do this we use our turn
02:25 - statement and this allows the function
02:27 - to return data back to us so instead of
02:30 - printing this how about we return
02:32 - product and then we do x equals
02:38 - multiplication and then we'll do print X
02:43 - and then we get 16 so what it's doing is
02:47 - it's calculating the products and then
02:50 - it's returning products so the value of
02:53 - this function is now products so we're
02:56 - assigning that value of multiplication
02:58 - to X which is 16 and then we're printing
03:01 - X which is 16 okay so that's return
03:04 - statement I'm going to end the video
03:06 - here guys if you have any questions
03:08 - about what we have covered in this video
03:09 - or if you have any errors in your code
03:11 - be sure to leave a comment down below if
03:13 - you'd like to support me all you have to
03:15 - do is give this video I like it really
03:17 - does help me out also consider
03:19 - subscribing I perspire and come to an
03:20 - almost every day that's it from me
03:23 - Cheers and goodbye
