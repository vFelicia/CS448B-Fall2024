00:00 - hello everyone and welcome back to short
00:02 - code this is a night video in my Python
00:04 - basics series today we will be learning
00:06 - about assignment operators we have
00:09 - already covered one assignment operator
00:11 - and you may have not even realized but
00:13 - we learn it in the second video when we
00:15 - learn about variables
00:25 - you
00:28 - okay so as you know we need to
00:30 - idle file new file okay so we'll just
00:40 - create a variable this so variable
00:44 - equals five now this right here that's
00:48 - an assignment operator so the next
00:51 - assignment operator we can also do is
00:55 - variable plus equals five which is the
00:59 - same as variable equals variable plus
01:04 - five it's just a short way of saying it
01:08 - it's sort of to mix an arithmetic
01:10 - operator with an equal sign in fact we
01:14 - need to print something first print very
01:17 - variable save it and run it we get 10
01:22 - because what it's doing is variable
01:24 - equals 5 variable plus equals 5 so
01:29 - that's adding on 5 to 5 and assigning
01:33 - that new variable which is 5 plus 5 to
01:36 - variable which is 10 so if we got rid of
01:40 - this and run it we'd still that 5
01:43 - because this isn't assigning it it's
01:46 - just doing an arithmetic operator so we
01:49 - need to make variable 10 we need to use
01:52 - the assignment operator now we've also
01:54 - got plenty of other ones oh by the way
01:59 - this is what's called a comment it's
02:00 - like - just signal is so you can make
02:04 - some notes on what your code is actually
02:07 - doing so we can also do some of our
02:11 - assignment operators so very variable -
02:18 - equals 5 for in variable variable we get
02:25 - 0 because 5 minus 5 is 0 and then
02:29 - variable equals 0 print variable it's 0
02:33 - 3 times it by 5 you get 25 again if you
02:39 - removed it it's not it's not signing it
02:42 - so it'll just stay 5
02:45 - we've also got division it's basically
02:49 - just all the arithmetic operators with
02:52 - an equal sign to make an assignment
02:54 - operator so you get 1 because 5 divided
02:57 - by 5 is 1 again indices 5 times 5 times
03:06 - 5 times 5 times 5 is 3125 if we do for
03:12 - division which is rounding down to the
03:15 - nearest whole number we get one maybe if
03:18 - we change it to 6 actually that will be
03:20 - better yeah we still got one we can also
03:23 - use modulus which gets the remainder so
03:27 - yeah but those are obvious I mean
03:30 - operators so it will just make a little
03:34 - comment here which is just a piece of
03:38 - text that - ignores when it's run so we
03:42 - have plus equals minus equals x equals
03:51 - God equals indices equals and blah
04:00 - division sorry for division equals so
04:05 - there we go so now for some challenges
04:08 - for you to do by yourself have a
04:10 - variable equals four then use some
04:12 - modulus assignment operator with the
04:14 - second operand which is like this which
04:18 - is a number on the right-hand side of
04:21 - the arithmetic of the assignment
04:24 - operator there's a number of your choice
04:26 - then print out the variable have a
04:29 - variable of your choice and venues
04:31 - Enders indices and floor division on it
04:33 - with the second operand being a number
04:36 - of your choice or numbers of your choice
04:38 - and finally have a variable and go
04:41 - through each assignment operator with
04:43 - the first up around being the variable
04:45 - and the second operand being free and
04:47 - see what happens that's all for today
04:49 - guys if you have any questions or errors
04:51 - leave them in the comment section below
