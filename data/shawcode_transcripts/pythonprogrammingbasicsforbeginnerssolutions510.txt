00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to show code
00:02 - today we'll be going through all the
00:04 - solutions for videos 5 to 10 I will be
00:07 - giving away the solution to a big
00:09 - challenge set last video in the next
00:11 - video if you haven't seen my video I
00:13 - will link a playlist in the description
00:14 - okay let's get programming okay so
00:22 - hey we can see all the solutions so
00:25 - first let's go through the episode five
00:27 - solutions so the first challenge was
00:30 - create free if statements that proved
00:32 - true depending on a variable being equal
00:34 - to a number variable one equals three
00:37 - we're just setting up some variables
00:38 - here if var one equals free print var
00:43 - one equals three
00:44 - if bar two equals five print var two
00:48 - equals five
00:49 - if bar 4 equals seven print part 4
00:52 - equals seven as you can see var 1 is
00:55 - equal to free so whenever you run it it
00:59 - will print out just ignore all this
01:01 - stuff visa for challenges later it does
01:04 - print var one oh it does print var 1
01:08 - equals free bar 2 equals 5 because bar 2
01:12 - equals 5 appear and then var 4 equals 7
01:15 - a prince var 4 equals 7 because var free
01:19 - is set to 7 up here okay on to a second
01:22 - challenge create an if and else
01:25 - statement that proves true or false so
01:27 - as you can see let's just close this so
01:30 - if V 1 plus V 2 equals a print true else
01:34 - print false so 3 plus 5 equals 8 so it
01:39 - should print true yeah as you can see
01:43 - true
01:44 - and then finally 5 - 3 create an if Elif
01:51 - and else statement but proves true or
01:53 - false if bar 2 plus 4 equals 15 print 15
01:58 - bar 2 so 5 plus 7 that's not 15 so it
02:04 - will just skip over this LF bar 2 plus
02:07 - bar 3 equals 12 print 12 else print nan
02:11 - so bar 2 5 plus 7 equals 12 so it will
02:17 - print 12 1 or you run it as you can see
02:21 - 12 so it is skipped this first if
02:25 - statement because it's not true and it
02:29 - moves on to this LF statement it sees
02:31 - that this statement is true so it prints
02:33 - 12 and it never even touches yourself
02:36 - statement because it's already detected
02:38 - that our statement above it is true so
02:41 - it just ignores the else statement
02:43 - okay so episode six challenges the first
02:47 - one was create an if statement comparing
02:50 - two variables to see a fair not equal so
02:52 - if bar 1 does not equal var to print and
02:55 - file 1 does not equal bar - so if bar 1
02:59 - does not equal var - if free does not
03:01 - equal 5 print 3 does not equal 5 right
03:06 - that's a new pup yeah
03:08 - sick free does not equal 5 number to
03:12 - create an if and else statement
03:14 - comparing two variables to see if one is
03:16 - greater than the other so if bar 2 is
03:19 - greater than bar free print var 2 is
03:22 - greater than bar free else print var 2
03:25 - is isn't greater than the bar free so if
03:29 - 5 is greater than 7 print 5 is greater
03:32 - than 7 if it isn't print 5 isn't greater
03:37 - than 7
03:38 - so let's run it as you can see here 5 is
03:40 - in greater than 7 so challenge free on
03:44 - episode 6 was create an F Elif and else
03:48 - statement comparing two variables to see
03:50 - if 1 is greater than another the Elif
03:52 - statement should check if one is less
03:54 - than the other as you can see have made
03:55 - a typo let's just turn that back so it's
03:58 - actually less than so if var 1 is
04:03 - greater than bar - so if a is greater
04:06 - than 5 print 3 is greater than 5
04:09 - if var 3 is less than by 1 so if 7 is
04:13 - less than 3 print ba 3 is less than bar
04:17 - 1 print 7 is less than free if the if
04:22 - statement is false in VLF statement is
04:24 - false let's just move on to this else
04:26 - statement and print nan so anyway run it
04:29 - it prints out non-video 7 challenges so
04:35 - the first one was create an if statement
04:37 - to check if a boolean value is truffles
04:39 - so boolean 1 equals true if bull one
04:44 - print true what this if ball 1 is doing
04:48 - if just to show
04:49 - way of saying if bull one is true but
04:52 - what we can do is just change it
04:54 - shorten it to just a full one you can
04:59 - see it's true so challenge to create an
05:04 - if an else statement to check if a
05:06 - boolean value is true or false if not
05:08 - run VL statement so bull 2 equals false
05:12 - if bull to print true else print false
05:15 - you can see it prints false because bull
05:18 - 2 is not true so a leg novice top one
05:21 - and just move around to the else
05:23 - statement and then the third one create
05:26 - an integer and use the bull function to
05:28 - check if it's true or not
05:29 - so in one equals four it's just an
05:32 - integer variable and then print bull in
05:35 - one it prints true because as long as a
05:39 - value isn't zero it'll always prove true
05:42 - as long as an integer isn't zero it'll
05:45 - always prove true so in one equals four
05:52 - 7-3 you can see it's true but if we
05:55 - change it to zero its false
06:00 - episode eight create a string variable
06:02 - and cast it to an integer and print out
06:05 - a little hint the string must be numbers
06:08 - only string one equals five and then
06:12 - print string one but as an integer so if
06:15 - you run it you get five you would get an
06:20 - error if you just had some text and
06:22 - tried to convert it to an integer as you
06:25 - can see invalid literal for int with
06:28 - base 10 which basically saying you can't
06:32 - convert text to an integer
06:34 - you can only convert a string when it's
06:36 - a number inside the string so let's just
06:39 - change our back to by the challenge to
06:42 - create an integer variable cast it to a
06:45 - string and concatenate it with another
06:47 - string and print it in one equal seven
06:49 - print string the string version event 1
06:53 - plus hello so what this does is it just
06:58 - says 7 hello because it's converted it
07:01 - into a string so
07:03 - or string in one is to CMOS seven and
07:08 - hello so if we put it back to what it
07:11 - was it's just the same as up so it's
07:16 - just concatenating the strings together
07:18 - so yeah seven hello
07:20 - and then challenge Shree create a float
07:24 - variable and cast it to an integer and
07:26 - print it out so float one is equal six
07:29 - point three print out the integer
07:31 - version of that and as you can see it's
07:35 - just six because it just rounds it down
07:38 - from six point three to six because it
07:40 - can't deal with decimals okay episode
07:45 - nine have a variable equals four venues
07:47 - a modulus assignment operator with a
07:49 - number of your choice and then print out
07:51 - so my vehicles for my VAR modulus equals
07:56 - to bring my god so let's write it equals
08:00 - zero because 4 divided by 2 leaves no
08:03 - remainder which is 0 and then we're
08:05 - assigning a row number to my bar and
08:07 - then printing my bar which is 0 okay
08:11 - challenge to have a variable of your
08:14 - choice and use the in the season for
08:16 - division I up with numbers of your
08:17 - choice so my VAR equals 7 my bar star
08:22 - star equals to 7 times 7 equals 49
08:25 - and then my var equals 49 and then 49
08:30 - divided by 6 rounded down is 8 and then
08:34 - we're assigning 8 to my bar then on 9.2
08:39 - we're printing 8 ok challenge free so
08:44 - have a variable go through each
08:46 - assignment operator with the first
08:48 - operand being the variable and the
08:50 - second operand being free see what
08:52 - happens so we're just going through all
08:54 - of the assignment operators starting off
08:58 - with 5 adding 3 minus thing free
09:01 - timesing it by 3 divided it dividing it
09:04 - by 3 getting the remainder performing
09:07 - indices on it while dividing it and then
09:11 - you can see the answer is 2.0 finally
09:14 - episode 10
09:16 - create an if statement checking if a
09:18 - Weber is cold and wet
09:19 - if so print out for weather isn't very
09:22 - nice so I've just got a variable called
09:25 - temperature or temp equals cold humidity
09:29 - I don't even know if that's the right
09:30 - word or not but it's wet
09:32 - if temple's cold and humidity equals
09:37 - what print the weather isn't very nice
09:40 - challenge to create an if statement
09:42 - checking it for the time is midday or
09:44 - midnight if it is print hour is twelve
09:47 - o'clock time equals midday if it is if
09:51 - time equals midday all time equals
09:53 - midnight pronounced twelve o'clock so it
09:56 - could be either midday or midnight if we
10:00 - just run it you can see we get it's
10:03 - twelve o'clock if we change this to
10:06 - midnight it will still print out it's
10:11 - twelve o'clock because it can be either
10:13 - midday or midnight it doesn't matter
10:17 - which whereas from this one it needs to
10:19 - be both cold and wet it can't be cold or
10:22 - wet so if you change this to dry we're
10:27 - just not going to get anything so it
10:29 - needs to be wet it needs to be cold and
10:32 - wet for it to print out this
10:34 - so finally challenge free create an if
10:37 - statement checking if it is not day if
10:39 - so print out is nighttime so day equals
10:44 - false if not day print it's night so
10:48 - what it's doing is it's just reversing
10:50 - the day boolean value which is false so
10:54 - it reverses it equals true if true print
10:58 - it is night run it
11:00 - I know let me just bring this down a bit
11:04 - it's it's night so if we change this to
11:07 - true we don't get anything because if
11:12 - not day it's actually day so it won't
11:15 - print out anything so this is just this
11:20 - if not day it's basically just saying if
11:23 - day equals false
11:27 - change it's false it's his night okay
11:32 - but solver challenges from videos five
