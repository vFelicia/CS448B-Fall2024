00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to show code
00:02 - today I'm going to be teaching you how
00:03 - to create import and use modules in
00:06 - Python I have lots of experience in
00:08 - Python and by the end of this video
00:10 - you'll have a great knowledge of modules
00:12 - so what are modules they're like codes
00:15 - libraries you can import these into your
00:18 - Python projects for you to use it's
00:20 - basically a premade Python file
00:22 - containing a set of variables and
00:23 - functions that you want to use in your
00:25 - program so let's start by creating a
00:27 - module so as you can see here I have two
00:30 - Python files open this is going to be
00:32 - our main file and this is going to be
00:34 - our module and they can be called
00:36 - whatever you want and you need them to
00:37 - be in the same directory as each other
00:39 - okay so let's go into our module file
00:41 - and create a new variable and a function
00:43 - x equals 3 define module func print a
00:52 - nice module and by the way you could
00:57 - call this way via one it doesn't have to
00:59 - be module funk it could be like
01:01 - cheeseburger or something but I'm just
01:03 - gonna keep it as module func now let's
01:05 - go into our main Python file and type
01:07 - import and then the name of your module
01:11 - file so mine is 26.2 then we'll create a
01:14 - new variable called Y and say it to 26.2
01:20 - dot X and then we'll print Y I'm gonna
01:27 - run it oh yeah and by the way you can't
01:30 - have your module names having numbers in
01:34 - them so I'll have to change mine I'll
01:36 - just call it module import module and
01:41 - then module so X then we'll get free
01:46 - because what we're doing is for
01:48 - importing this file here and then we're
01:51 - referring to module this file this
01:54 - variable here is module 2 X so we have
01:57 - to refer to the module name and then the
01:59 - variable to access it
02:01 - and then we're just printing it oh then
02:03 - we can also call the function so module
02:06 - top module
02:10 - and then we'll get free and nice module
02:13 - if you're enjoying the video so far be
02:15 - sure to drop a like it really does help
02:17 - me out anyway
02:19 - notice that we have put our module name
02:21 - before each function or variable you
02:23 - know main file well instead of frying
02:24 - import module week what we can do is you
02:28 - can do from module imports asterisk and
02:31 - what this means is all so from the from
02:35 - this file import everything so now we
02:38 - don't have to use this module dot we can
02:42 - just refer to it directly and there we
02:47 - go we can also import individual
02:50 - variables and functions from the module
02:52 - from module import X and then get rid of
02:57 - this when we get free what we're doing
03:01 - here is we're only imparting this x
03:04 - value and then we won't be importing
03:06 - anything else so if we do module phone
03:08 - we're going to get an error because
03:10 - module func it's not defined because we
03:13 - have an imported it we've only imported
03:15 - to X and we can also rename modules and
03:18 - it's basically a short way of saying it
03:20 - so we can do much import module as MD so
03:25 - now instead of having to write module
03:28 - doc module func we can just write MD
03:35 - don't match your funk and then we'll get
03:38 - nice module so this won't renamed the
03:41 - actual module file
03:42 - I'll just rename it in your Python code
03:44 - right here very also various built in
03:47 - modules are part of Python and we will
03:49 - be covering some common ones in the next
03:51 - few videos you're also able to download
03:53 - someone else's modules for aren't built
03:55 - in and I'll show you how to do this in
03:57 - an upcoming video okay about software
04:00 - today guys if you have any questions or
04:01 - comments be sure to leave them down
04:02 - below I'll be sure to reply if you would
04:05 - like to support me all you have to do is
04:07 - give this video like it really does help
04:09 - me out I also consider subscribing I
04:11 - post python content almost every day
04:14 - that's it from me Cheers and goodbye
