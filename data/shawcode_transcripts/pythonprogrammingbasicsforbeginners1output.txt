00:00 - hello everyone and welcome to my Python
00:03 - basics tutorial series this series will
00:06 - teach you all the things you need to
00:08 - know to get started on working with
00:09 - Python this series is mainly for people
00:12 - who don't know anything about Python all
00:14 - of programming in general but if you do
00:17 - know how to program it's still good for
00:19 - you as a refresher or a better
00:21 - understanding so today we will be
00:23 - learning about output and Python so
00:26 - let's go onto programming I'm gonna go
00:27 - an open Idol it will have been installed
00:31 - when you installed Python and file new
00:35 - file this will open up a new file for
00:37 - you to write your code in okay so then
00:40 - we want to do print hello world save it
00:46 - and just save it somewhere and you go to
00:58 - run run module and that will run it and
01:01 - we can see we've got hello world so as
01:04 - you can see this print function it it
01:07 - basically puts site output if we run
01:09 - again to the output window which is this
01:13 - shell right here so if we you have to
01:16 - type in print Open bracket speech marks
01:21 - or you can use quote marks anything you
01:24 - want as your text and close it off with
01:27 - speech marks and brackets so we can try
01:31 - again this time I'll type something
01:34 - different so hello then save it run it
01:41 - hello world hello there that's all well
01:47 - and good what happens if we want to
01:48 - write on different lines so what we can
01:50 - do is you can type print and then priest
01:54 - free lots of speech marks oh well this
01:58 - is on line and then bring more speech
02:06 - marks and close it with brackets save it
02:08 - run it
02:10 - so we get we got via hello world hello
02:12 - there and then we get hello this is on
02:15 - the new line so we use free lots of
02:17 - speech marks and brackets obviously and
02:20 - though yeah now for some challenges for
02:23 - you to do by yourself so you want to
02:26 - make a program for outputs I love
02:28 - programming in Python make a program for
02:31 - outputs I will be the best programmer
02:33 - ever but each word is on a new line make
02:36 - a program for outputs a poem but on each
02:38 - new line in the poem has a new line in
02:42 - the output window I will be giving four
02:44 - solutions to these challenges in a later
02:46 - video so stay tuned for that so that's
02:49 - all for today guys make sure to stay
02:50 - tuned for the next tutorial by
02:52 - subscribing and hey well also drop a
02:55 - like if this helped you out it helped me
02:56 - out a lot if you have any questions
02:59 - about Python or need some help with any
03:00 - errors be sure to leave it in the
03:02 - comment section below
03:03 - I'll be sure to help you out any
03:05 - suggestions or feedback would be greatly
