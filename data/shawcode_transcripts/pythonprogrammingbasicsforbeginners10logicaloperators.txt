00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to short
00:02 - code this is the tenth video in my
00:03 - Python basics tutorial series today we
00:06 - will be learning about logical operators
00:08 - there are three different logical
00:11 - operators in Python and or and not very
00:14 - used with if statements so let's get
00:16 - into some examples of how to use them
00:18 - okay so open a file or whatever you used
00:22 - to and it your Python code you file how
00:27 - about we implement some input as well
00:29 - which we learn in the fourth episode
00:32 - sunny equals input is it certainly warm
00:42 - equals input is it warm
00:48 - if sunny equals y and warm Z we're using
00:55 - this and logical operator and 1 equals y
01:01 - print print I am happy because it is
01:08 - sunny and warm else print I am NOT happy
01:20 - because it is not sunny and and warm
01:30 - okay so as you can see we use anis and
01:34 - operator and it returns true if both
01:38 - operands are true so let's run it but
01:43 - first we need to say but is it sunny yes
01:47 - or no yes is it warm yes I am happy
01:52 - because it's sunny and warm so if you're
01:56 - running again why and I am NOT happy
02:00 - because it's not sunny and warm if we
02:02 - replace this with all I am I'm going
02:06 - change this I am happy because it is
02:07 - sunny and warm to sunny or warm when it
02:13 - is it sunny
02:15 - no but it is warm somehow I am happy
02:18 - because it is sunny or warm so with this
02:23 - or it returns true if either operand is
02:27 - true so this one could be true and this
02:30 - one could be false it still return true
02:32 - it's only returns false if both of them
02:35 - are not true
02:35 - so let's just see that no and no I'm not
02:39 - happy yes unless I am happy okay so
02:45 - that's the end and all logical operators
02:49 - now let's move on to a slightly
02:50 - different one which is not so I'll just
02:54 - comment this out with in idle you can
02:58 - hear alt and free and that'll comment
03:01 - out a section of code raining equals
03:05 - false if not raining print it is not
03:15 - raining save it and on it it is not
03:19 - raining so what this not does it returns
03:22 - true if the upper end is false so it's
03:26 - it's basically a short way of doing it
03:29 - raining there's not equal true it's just
03:33 - easier to write not raining like that
03:39 - and then if we changes to true we don't
03:43 - get anything in summary and returns true
03:47 - if both operands are true all our
03:49 - returns true if one operand is true and
03:51 - not returns true if the upper end is
03:54 - false
03:55 - now for some challenges for you to do by
03:57 - itself firstly create an if statement
04:00 - checking it for weather is cold and wet
04:02 - if so print out for weather isn't very
04:04 - nice create an if statement checking you
04:07 - if the time is midday or midnight if it
04:10 - is print out it is 12 o'clock create an
04:13 - if statement checking if it is not day
04:14 - if so print out it's nighttime so that's
04:18 - all for today guys if you have many
04:20 - questions or errors leave them in the
04:22 - comment section below if you enjoyed be
