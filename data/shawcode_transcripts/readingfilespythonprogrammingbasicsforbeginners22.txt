00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to short
00:02 - code today I'm going to be showing you
00:04 - how to read from a file in Python okay
00:06 - so first off I've just got this sample
00:08 - text file with some text in it now let's
00:11 - open a file create a new file and then
00:17 - we'll do file equals open text txt which
00:23 - is the file name make sure you're in the
00:26 - same directory as your text file with
00:29 - this Python file and then we're going to
00:31 - type our and then read file equals file
00:37 - dot read print read read file then file
00:45 - dot close and then if we run it we get
00:49 - hello there and AAA and if we look in
00:51 - our text file hello there AAA so I'll
00:55 - explain what we're doing here so first
00:57 - off we're creating a variable and this
01:00 - is set to open text exe in read mode
01:03 - this is what this R stands for we're
01:06 - reading it so this means we can't modify
01:08 - it we're just opening air in read mode
01:10 - this open statement is just bell into
01:13 - python and it allows us to open files
01:15 - and then we're creating another variable
01:18 - which is read file and we're doing it
01:20 - file dot read which is just a method
01:24 - which allows us to read for contents of
01:26 - the file and then we're printing read
01:28 - file and then we're doing file dot close
01:30 - followed up close is important if you
01:33 - don't close the file you'll run into
01:34 - some trouble a bit later on so make sure
01:36 - you close the file so that's basic file
01:38 - reading if you're enjoying for video so
01:41 - far please do drop a like it really does
01:43 - help me out now let's go on to reading
01:44 - each individual line so we could do this
01:48 - by using a read lines instead of read so
01:51 - read lines and then if we run it we can
01:54 - see we get this list so read lines
01:56 - returns a list and each item in the list
01:59 - is a new line first line is hello there
02:02 - and the first item is cell over and this
02:05 - /n is just the Enter key or a new line
02:07 - and then on the second line there's a a
02:12 - so that's all for 2
02:13 - the guys in the next video we will be
02:16 - covering how to write text to a file if
02:18 - you have any questions or comments leave
02:20 - them down below I'll be shelter apply if
02:22 - you would like to support me give this
02:24 - video a like it really does help me out
02:25 - also consider subscribing I post Python
02:28 - content almost every day that's it from
02:30 - me Jess and good bye
