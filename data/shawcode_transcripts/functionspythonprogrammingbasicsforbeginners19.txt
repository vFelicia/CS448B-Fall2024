00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to show code
00:02 - today I'm going to be teaching you what
00:04 - functions of the uses and how to create
00:07 - them by the end of this video you will
00:09 - be able to incorporate functions into
00:10 - your Python projects and become much
00:12 - more efficient so a function is a block
00:14 - of code for only runs when it is called
00:16 - this means we can write code once and
00:18 - use it over and over again functions
00:21 - also take parameters which basically
00:23 - means you give the function some data to
00:25 - work with it can then return some data
00:27 - to you okay I've just got a python file
00:29 - open now let's make a function so what
00:32 - we want to do is type death and then
00:36 - your function name so I'm just gonna
00:37 - collect my func then two round brackets
00:41 - colon then print this is a function okay
00:51 - so this is a function so we start it off
00:55 - with this defined keyword which
00:57 - basically tells Python but hey we're
00:59 - gonna make a function now then we write
01:02 - our function name this can be whatever
01:03 - we want then we use a pair of round
01:05 - brackets in here you would put your
01:07 - parameters but we're not gonna deal with
01:09 - parameters this episode next episode we
01:12 - will be covering parameters then you
01:14 - have your go on and then underneath that
01:18 - you'll have your code block which will
01:20 - run when your function runs and make
01:23 - sure this is indented to show but it is
01:25 - part of the function anyway we have just
01:27 - made our function if we run it it
01:31 - doesn't actually do anything that's
01:33 - because we haven't actually called it
01:34 - we've created it and we haven't done
01:36 - anything with it it's sort of like
01:37 - creating a variable and then just
01:39 - leaving it so we have to call it so what
01:42 - we do is we type of function name so
01:44 - myfunc and then a pair of round brackets
01:48 - like that save it run it I'm going to
01:53 - get this is a function because it's gone
01:55 - alright okay my function so let's look
01:57 - up here my function what does my
02:00 - function want me to do print this is a
02:02 - function okay so let's print that so we
02:05 - could do more stuff we could have like a
02:07 - variable in here so x equals 5 print
02:10 - this is a function print
02:13 - Eck's the idea of functions is they can
02:16 - be called multiple times so you don't
02:18 - have to write the same block of code
02:19 - over and over again so if we just get
02:21 - rid of this and print we just print
02:25 - hello we can call my function as many
02:31 - times as we want as you can see it
02:34 - printed hello four times so it basically
02:37 - means we don't have to write the same
02:39 - code walk out over and over again it
02:41 - becomes a lot more efficient I would
02:44 - like to briefly talk about the path
02:45 - statement so functions can't be empty
02:48 - clear this then my phone we just can't
02:56 - get it get an error because it's
02:57 - expecting something to be expecting
03:01 - something to be here but if we just
03:02 - wanted to create the function but it not
03:05 - do anything we would use the path
03:06 - statement so that's basically just
03:08 - telling Python hey just ignore this
03:11 - could work just leave it for now I'm
03:12 - gonna come back to it later this can be
03:14 - used with other things as well that use
03:16 - code blocks so it's not just use of
03:18 - functions it could be used with if
03:20 - statements while loops okay I'm going to
03:22 - end of a video here next Junio we'll be
03:24 - learning more about functions especially
03:26 - parameters and returning data if you
03:29 - have any questions about Python or have
03:31 - any errors in your code leave it in the
03:32 - comment section I'll be sure to reply if
03:34 - you would like to support me all you
03:36 - have to do is give this video like it
03:38 - really has helped me out also consider
03:40 - subscribing I post Python content almost
03:43 - every day that's it from me Cheers and
03:46 - goodbye
