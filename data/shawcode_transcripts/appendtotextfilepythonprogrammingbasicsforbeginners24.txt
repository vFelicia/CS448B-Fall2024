00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to show code
00:02 - in this video I'll be showing you how to
00:04 - append to a file in Python
00:06 - in the last video I showed you how to
00:08 - write to a file if you haven't seen that
00:10 - make sure you go and watch it the
00:12 - playlist link is in the description now
00:14 - the difference between writing and
00:15 - appending to a file is that writing
00:17 - completely wipes the file and then adds
00:19 - things to it whereas appending just adds
00:22 - content onto the texture is already
00:24 - there so if you don't want to completely
00:25 - get rid of everything in the file and
00:27 - you just want to add onto the file then
00:29 - you should use the append okay I've just
00:31 - got some dummy text here now let's go to
00:34 - idle okay from here let's create a
00:36 - sample string sample string equals
00:40 - newline hello new line there then we
00:47 - want to open it so file equals open text
00:52 - txt which is your file name then we'll
00:55 - open it in a pend mode which is a o
01:01 - then drop a line then we use the write
01:04 - functions so file dot write sample
01:08 - string and yeah we still do use the
01:11 - write function instead of an append
01:13 - function so it will just add on to the
01:15 - button instead of wiping the file and
01:17 - now we need to close the file then if we
01:21 - run it we won't get any output but if we
01:23 - head over to the text file we can see we
01:29 - get hello there on two new lines and it
01:32 - hasn't wiped the file at all it's just
01:33 - added on to the bottom of it okay that's
01:36 - all for today guys if you have any
01:38 - questions or comments leave them down
01:39 - below I'll be sure to reply if you'd
01:41 - like to pop me drop a like on this video
01:43 - it really does help me out also consider
01:45 - subscribing I post python content almost
01:48 - every day that's it from me Cheers
01:50 - and goodbye
