this is going to be a sixstep guide to maximize your chance of getting a job in Tech this year so let's get started step one ask yourself why you want to get into Tech in the first place is it because of the money is it because you're passionate about tech or is it because you want to be able to build a certain type of tech whatever your motivation is I'm not going to judge you for it but the important thing is that you think about it carefully and you ask yourself is getting a job in Tech actually going to get you the thing that you really want and then you need to decide what type of job you want because there are many many different types of jobs available in Tech there's front end backend full stack data engineering devops Cloud product management project management UI ux so many options so find what's available in your local market what you're good at and try to find you know an intersection of those things plus what you're interested in doing step three learn fundamental skills this step might take about 100 days or a little bit more depending on your focus area and 100 days are not going to be enough to learn everything you need to know to get a job in Tech but it is going to be enough to have a really solid foundation so for example if you want to be a software engineer you might want to learn things like for Loops if statements functions and other basic programming Concepts so after learning those things you know within those 100 days start solving simple problems and work on exercise problems to solidify your understanding and make sure to build some uh simple project whether it's a calculator app or a calendar app to further practice your skills step four do everything you can to gain experience a lot of people say how do I even get experience before I have the experience my answer is always go get some experience and for that I recommend a couple things one open source contributions two freelancing for local businesses or using platforms like Fiverr or upwork three your own project or building your own business any options work here but be mindful you know if you try using stuff like Fiverr or upwork that can be really hard because you know you'll be competing with a global pool of talent so instead I would generally recommend contributing to open source or doing freelancing work for local businesses and keep in mind that even if you're not getting paid for some of these things in my opinion experience is experience you know if you do open source contributions and if you send in a few significant PRS then you're putting in a lot of work for it you might not be getting paid for it but at least you should be getting paid by experience H you want to be able to put that on your LinkedIn experience section I want to emphasize that part and the way you can do that is by creating a LinkedIn business page and by putting what you've done as part of your experience section by calling yourself software developer at the business page you know create a nice professional logo for it have a nice name for that business page and that way you're going to start to have more experience that you can show again in your LinkedIn experience section and you want to spend about six months at least 6 months I would say on this portion so that you'll have 6 months of solid experience once you have you know 6 months of experience 100 days of solid uh basic learning then you want to start a network so that you can get in front of people the thing with you know C apply it's totally fine if you want to go for it but each application will get hundreds of applicants and it's going to be really hard for you to stand out so what you want to do instead is actually go talk to people at meetups conferences online events offline events wherever you can talk to actual human beings recruiters or other people in Tech so that you can get noticed one thing you want to keep in mind is that you don't want to appear too desperate you know you don't want to go up to someone you just met and say can you give me a job I've seen this happen don't do it instead focus on creating longterm meaningful relationships you know this kind of thing will take at least three months let's say from the point you meet someone to the point where they might be comfortable referring you to a job now in the previous step as you gain more experience it's important to share your progress online so use platforms like LinkedIn Twitter you don't have to share every single thing but share highlights share something you learned share what you're proud of so that more people will know that you exist in the first place and so that more people will know what you're working on then what's really powerful about this concept of building in public is that as you start to network like this penguin is doing uh you start to meet more people and connect with more people on platforms like LinkedIn and as you building public as you share your progress online they will start to notice is they will start to have you on top of their mind as you share what you're passionate about what you're good at where your skill sets are and finally you want to start working on your interview skills I would say though uh in the current market and the market I expect later this year the main challenge will still be to land interviews not get through them but still when you start to land interviews uh you want to make sure that you don't waste those opportunities you might not be able to get through you know 10 out of 10 interviews but at least you want to be able to get through you know maybe five out of 10 uh seven out of 10 I ideally eight or nine out of 10 when you get uh really good at interviews it's possible and for that I recommend a few things first you need to realize that interviews are really just a form of conversations there's nothing really special about it you know you might think okay you're supposed to answer these questions that people ask in this weird formality thing but I wouldn't necessarily see it that way if you become a really good communicator in general a really good conversationalist in general then that will show in interviews because at the end of the day again they are just conversations so what you want to do is basically go talk to as many people as possible in these networking events like I mentioned earlier and then practice your communication skills in general become a really good listener be good at empathy and all of those things and then the second thing I recommend is is working on your problem solving skills again this is a general skill that you can also apply to interviews you know this is not particular to just interviews uh if you've worked on freelancing things or open source contributions then you will have naturally buil up some of these skills but you know if you feel like uh you need to practice a little bit more then do a little bit of lead code if you need to hacker rank uh cold Wars whatever you find the most enjoyable the or the least painful and and then uh you you might need to grind a little bit but whatever you need to do do that and then finally I would say practicing in a simulated environment is going to be really helpful so what this means is that you want to ask your friends or people in your community to give you some mock interviews this is going to be a really good practice for you and I would also say you should also offer to give people Mark interviews because that way you're going to start to understand what it feels like into in the interviewer shoes and that's going to give you some more empathy and that's going to make you a much better interviewer in my opinion so just to recap quickly first ask yourself why you want to get a job in Tech in the first place and then uh decide what type of job you want exactly and then learn fundamental skills that's step three gain more experience do some networking and work on your interview skills in my opinion this whole process should take about one year and you might say that's too optimistic maybe maybe true you know depending on your location but I don't think it's overly optimistic and here's why one of the reasons is because I'm pretty optimistic about the upcoming Market in the economy especially if and when the FED decides to cut interest rate it's going to be good for the stock market and it's going to be good for the job market as well but more importantly I think one year is a realistic timeline because most people are not that consistent you know a bunch of people are going to listen to this advice and let's say out of a thousand people who listen to this advice maybe um you know 100 people will get started or maybe 500 you know if I'm being optimistic and out of those after 10 days you know we're going to have maybe 50 people left after 100 days maybe we'll have 10 people left after 365 days how many people do you think are consistent enough to show up every day to you know do the work every day to actually finish this world map I would say probably two or three you know if I'm being realistic if I'm being you know optimistic I might say five or six what that means is that if you're one of those people it's going to make a huge difference it's going to give you a huge advantage in this you know even tough economy and it's going to give you a much better chance of you know being able to get a job compared to those people who didn't show up for one year straight and as I said you know that's a realistic estimate you know two to three people five five to six people being able to finish this out of a thousand but I really want more of you to be able to finish this road map you know if you watch this far I really want you to be able to you know become uh more really more exceptional you know have a a lot more energy uh on this journey and be able to actually finish it and get a job in 365 days
