so I worked at Google in Montreux as a fulltime software developer for about a year I like to work in there but then I decided to leave the company to focus on my YouTube channel instead when I told my friends about it some of them were like wow you're following your passion that's awesome but really that's not what I was doing I liked making YouTube videos for sure but I didn't quit my job just so that I could follow my passion if passion was what I was falling I would probably be pursuing standup comedy right now what I love comedy but when I left Google that's not what I started doing instead I was following this gap in the market I found so a little bit before I started working at Google I started my youtube channel called CS dojo which was mainly about software engineer job interviews it started growing fast and I got more than 100 thousand views and five thousand subscribers when I had only like 10 videos on the channel around the same time I also started coaching people on how to get through software engineering job interviews and they actually started paying me for it what I realized through this experience is that I was starting to feel the difference between what people wanted and what they were getting it was sort of like this gap in the market people wanted to see highquality videos about software engineer interviews but they couldn't find them anywhere else that's why I was able to get that many views and subscribers some people also wanted someone to teach them how to get through software engineer interviews 101 but they couldn't find anyone else to do that easily and that's why they found me to help them because I was starting to feel this gap between what people wanted and what they were getting I was able to grow my YouTube channel really quickly and through my channel I was able to help thousands of people being able to help so many people actually just felt awesome and then I thought maybe if I focus on this fulltime maybe I'll be able to help a lot more people a lot faster and that's why I left Google actually I'm making a lot less money now but it's just a amazing to be able to directly see the impact that I'm making on people's lives this was actually something that was sort of lacking in my engineering job even though working at Google was amazing so I'm not really sure how my channel is gonna go from here but I think there is still a lot more potential here and there's still a lot more people I can help out there somewhere you know I actually just feel really lucky to be able to directly touch so many people's lives and so I promise you I'm gonna keep doing this as long as possible so that I can help even more people okay I hope you enjoyed this video and hopefully I'll see you in the next one Cheers and highfive
