so a few weeks ago I was visiting in California when I was there I had a chance to interview Joma tech and just in case you don't know much about him he went to the University of Waterloo in Canada for a computer science degree while he was there he did a bunch of internships in software engineering data science and p.m. companies like LinkedIn Facebook and Microsoft and after graduating he worked as a data scientist at BuzzFeed and Facebook and now he's a youtuber too now in this part of the interview that I'm gonna show you now we basically talked about first of all what it's like to be a data scientist and also how to become one so let's just jump into it and the first question I asked him was what was he like to work as a data scientist at BuzzFeed and Facebook so I could talk more about BuzzFeed maybe a bit less well Facebook sure but yeah so at BuzzFeed I was basically hired to understand like how to do how to distribute videos on Facebook so how it works is like wise you know BuzzFeed is like a media company they make a lot of videos they make a lot of videos everywhere and one of the platforms that they care a lot about is Facebook so if you've ever seen like a tasty video with the hands and stuff that's that's BuzzFeed so basically my job was to try to understand our Facebook strategy you know they have a lot of questions like you know should we share or should we cross posts which is very like specific to like Facebook and stuff like that and then also like what kind of videos do better than others and stuff like that so basically my job is is to basically like a product analyst for Facebook videos and then a lot of times what we would do is we would just look at a lot of these videos and try to understand like or why certain things happen why did we get more shares than usual and then yeah that's pretty much it and then at Facebook at Facebook I like the video team and basically what we're trying to do is we're just trying to make videos more successful on Facebook yeah so it sounds like your career like your entire career humming all about videos yeah pretty much so that's that's like pretty much my choosing it's because even before starting at BuzzFeed I was always into like videos and it's not like very good but I was pretty like I really want to be a YouTube celebrity for some reason you know as it's a very vein of myself but yeah I even chose like my career based on that and yeah like I chose BuzzFeed because I thought that I might be able to be in their videos in LA and then maybe I get some recognition and then using that recognition I could grow my youtube channel that didn't happen by the way so yeah I actually went to BuzzFeed for that yeah and then when I went to Facebook my initial thought was not to be on the video team because I was like okay I'm done with videos because when I switch to Facebook I didn't want to do anything with videos anymore but it was just so tempting because the team was like oh the creator team I was like oh my god I was like it sounds it was almost like not destiny but it was like my calling so I was like okay fine I'll go on that team because on Facebook you you're in bootcamp first and then you get to choose what team you want to pick later so I didn't initially want to be in videos but India and I still ended up being there yeah so you said that you wouldn't be able to share that much stuff about the work you did at the moment yeah cuz yeah some of this stuff is still like like not public or also like they don't want to tell that's like the strategy to especially YouTube and stuff like that but um yeah I could talk about it vaguely though okay let's a focus on BuzzFeed okay so are there any interesting examples of data science work you did Buzzbee yeah um I'm gonna be quite honest here sometimes I think like not every company needs a data science team and BuzzFeed was kind of on defensive it especially from what I was working on because like it's kind of like like running a youtube channel or like running a Facebook channel essentially I'm an analyst for their Facebook channel and a lot of the times they're you can't really explain stuff with data with stat sig you know like one of the questions was like oh you know should we share should we cross post which one's better which will get more views but the issue is you have to you know work with the people who actually manage the page make sure they post at the same time as same everything so basically we did a lot of like crack the a/b test like it wasn't a claim a/b test to try to discover if one thing is better than the other and we were cared about like is sharing better than cross posting and stuff like that and then another kind of work we did at BuzzFeed was just understand the health of our Facebook pages and one of the things like it's it doesn't even require that much data science skills or anything but we just looked at you know how many views are we getting like we saw that our page like tasty they were getting AG less and less views per video so meaning like we were making a lot more videos just to get the same amount of view as we did before so then we have to tell that the content team saying like oh by the way this might not be working we need to think of different strategies to get more views so it was very similar to like what I do for my own YouTube channel we're just like looking at various videos and various like trends and then try to capitalize on that so that doesn't sound too technical yeah it's not that technical I mean to be honest like at BuzzFeed I mean there were some other things that are more technicals like liking and I automated there like dashboards I automated like emails and stuff like that because they were pretty behind in terms of like automation and infrastructure so sometimes I what I would have to do is like I would have to like write slack bot slack bots for whenever something happens I have to tell like this like bow has to tell like the content team and stuff like that so I would guess that's technical because you know you have to code a little bit right but ya know like in terms of technical is it's not that technical but even at Facebook it wasn't that technical okay oh I did it was like sequel sequel queries right and then he was like tableau yeah to like do visualization and then if I needed like to do like a simple linear regression or like a logistic regression then I would use like our Python but that's it right yeah is there anything more you might be able to share from Facebook I think well I guess for Facebook like I could say that we have a lot of data and we have a lot of data and it makes things a lot easier cuz like we have a lot of data engineer so like things are really really easy to do now all I need to do is like write sequel query and I could query like billions of like data points just in one query and then yeah that's pretty much it and like the job that I did at Facebook we basically wanted to make creator successful so you know you could you could kind of like assume you could kind of like and for what I did but basically we look at our platform Facebook as a whole and then try to understand how to change the platform such that we can make craters kinda like YouTube creators successful in our platform yeah so I guess one like hypothetical example might be like oh yeah live video versus regular video mmhmm yeah that could work too it's like we could try to like compare two different types of videos and understand which is better and then if we're sure that one is better we could tell like our partners to say oh by the way you should do this more it will increase your distribution so yeah we would get a lot of understanding of our own distribution ecosystem and then tell our partners like what to do we're gonna say the partners my video creators yeah like video creators like for example you know like um like BuzzFeed it's a partner basically anyone who's big on Facebook you could kind of guess that they're partners meaning that we have at least like a few people talking to them all the time yeah okay mmmhmm all right another question I have for you was how does your getting to data science yeah so I think so so I did do computer science as my major and then I want to be a software engineer I didn't think about data science and then at one point I remember I was that LinkedIn we were like nine interns all from Waterloo we all live together and then at one point I remember one guy want one friend he said like software engineering isn't that great I was like wait what it means like I think I would rather like if I got paid the same I think I would rather wash dishes than be a sovereign Jim I was like oh my god really is it that bad you know but then that kind of like they're kind of stuck in me you know and and and the more we talk about it the more understood what he was talking about so he was talking more like as a software engineer he feels like he doesn't has it he doesn't have as much say in the product direction as he wants so coincidentally a lot of people who interned at LinkedIn with me they all want it to be like product managers or entrepreneurs or stuff like that and then I guess I also want to be a like a startup guy back then and what's closest to like leadership you know because I thought it was cool or it's like all leaders and stuff like that usually PM's are like leaders and they usually end up getting into more senior like executive roles so then I wanted to do p.m. and then when I applied for jobs I realized that data science might be a little bit closer to p.m. and then that's how I started in data science because and also I just asked my friend on my okay and refer me to data science position and my friend referred me and then that's how I got my first internship and then that's how I discovered like oh you know data science is not about like a machine like it's not always about like machine learning or like deep learning stuff like that a lot of it is like a business intelligence job so yeah that's how I got into it so you were a software engineer at LinkedIn and then you got interested in p.m. and their science and you sort of apply for those jobs basically did you do anything to prepare for their science interviews yeah I learned sequel because I never did sequel and I also learned probability questions you know Bayes theorem and yeah and I kind of brushed up on stats like I did learn some stats in school but you know I I don't remember everything so I have to like just read up on it and then obviously I went on the glass door I checked like what kind of questions they asked and then yeah so that's how I prepared for the interview like I knew that it would be easier in terms of like coding or like a technical whiteboarding interview I knew that would be easier and I was right so I didn't need like that much preparation cuz I already prepared a lot for like software coding jobs yeah so going through those topics was actually helpful for those Antibes oh yeah for sure good cuz I literally did not know sequel okay yeah so if someone you know wanting to get into data science today mmhmm how would you recommend that they prepare yeah so kind of like it really depends on what they mean by data science but if you mean like my data science like data analytics then I think we should do or you in Sulphur are we pretending that this person is in software and who wants to switch to uh I think this person could be either in software okay something else god I got it okay so I guess yeah using my exam previous examples of like you know buzz for in Facebook I guess for buzz actually not both them is quite similar to interview process so I think what you need to do is first yeah learn sequel if you don't know that already it should be pretty simple you should just like look it up on the internet do a few sequel questions and you're good and then you should learn to code a little bit like Python for example because they will ask you like maybe one or two easy Python question they're not as hard as like software engineering ones and then make sure you understand the basics of probability and stats stats mean like do you know what a confidence interval is like very basic do you know what a normal distribution is do you know how to do like yeah just if knowing how to do confidence intervals and then knowing your like distributions like binomial distribution plus all and stuff like that because sometimes they might ask that and then that's it yeah like okay that would be pretty good enough for an entry level right oh yeah one more thing yeah but I didn't study for that but you have to have like product sense mmhmm so learn about the product or the company that you work that you will work for and try to think about like oh how would that look how would I look at the data to find something that's insightful that would help the company you know so if you practice these mental exercises then you'll be good for the interview okay mmhmm so you said see called Python probability statistics and product test exactly are there any particular resources that you would recommend for learning those yeah the great thing about bigger companies is that they would send you like a lot of links to where you can study for each things I don't remember sequel where but basically sequel they gave me a website where I could practice like sequel questions but there's tons and then for probabilities I did a lot of brilliant dotorg questions oh yeah we're not sponsored this time but oh maybe you can be but yes I use brilliant org for all your probabilities questions okay stats Wikipedia I just want to capilla and like refresh my mind and maybe my old notes in school and then for product sense I usually just look at I actually ask friends you know or people who work in consultant companies they're usually pretty good I like product sense or like doing these kind of things so yeah brilliant or some sequel site and also you know Wikipedia okay mmmhmm okay so I feel like that that's good for after getting the interview oh right oh right okay so for getting an interview yeah so I guess my next question is what should people do to encourage their chance of getting the job getting dinner sizing TVs right so I think I think it's better to have like if you do have like a technical internship that's pretty good then you will already pass the technical part so having one technical internship that'll be great if you don't have that you have to do side projects I'm not sure if data like data boot camps are like worth it or not because I've never done it with like I've never seen people without it that don't have like a technical background but doing projects that are stats related or like technically related then that's pretty helpful too like an example would be like grab a random data set on the internet there's one popular one it's like the New York train station data set and then make a presentation out of it make a project find out like oh what's the busiest station where should you take is like where should you take the bus blah blah blah there was also like also another example that I could say like you could go to SF some SF website accept government website you could look at how many how many like crimes happened around SF like one fun thing you can do is like you could look at how many bikes were stolen where and then you know and then you could give a recommendation of where to park your bike to not get it sold in all right so that's like a very simple data science data science project I can do so yeah so once you have that in your resume make sure also that your keywords have the words like you know ipython notebook are yes equal basically all the buzz words that they use and then you should get the interview like that nice do you have any advice on how to write a resume for those positions yeah for me I think it's kind of hard for me to get that vice because I got it easy because I just got an internship at like a big company and then I'm set right but if not then yeah definitely highlight those like sequel like all those text acts that you need on like in the beginning and then yeah make sure your list your projects make sure you actually tell them like exactly what did you do in that project and why is it useful because I think like for data science they always want to see that the things you do have an impact that you know that you don't you can't just do exploratory analysis but it's useless so yeah make your resume onepage usually because then some recruiters don't like to pages I heard and yeah it should be pretty good okay so that last question I have about data science is are there any common misconception about data science or did a scientist or something that people tend to misunderstand yeah I think I think the biggest misconception is just the job itself like data science just because we shared the word data science a lot for a lot of different roles like for example machine learning engineers sometimes we call them data scientists sometimes we call core data science which is more like PhD level data science they usually do not only product focus data science but like something that's more inject like they build more complex models and then there's also like product analytics which is what I do but they also call it data science so I think the biggest misconception is like mixing those three up and then kind of assuming that you need a PhD to get into data science that you need to learn machine learning or you need deep learning experience so I think that's the biggest misconception and I think one advice for me is to it's just stuff like I want people to know that you should really try to understand what exactly your role is before you say you want to do that job because you know it's very possible that you always thought that you want to do data science but then once you get into the industry imagine you if you get a data analytics position and you realize like what the [ __ ] I mean what the hell is like I don't want to do this you know this is kind of lame so I just want you to make sure that for people who do want to go in data science I want you guys to know exactly what your into and to make sure that you actually like data science because of that not just because it's so hot right now and everyone said it's great yeah all right so those are sort of all the questions I had about Nina science but is there anything you want to add to this conversation that we okay that's fine yeah yeah I think data science like in general just like my two cents is that data science is great I think it does take some creativity especially like my data science which is product analytics data science and it really helps you like in your soft skills and the deafening makes you grow as a person because you constantly you work of like pans and like engineering managers so you start to learn like how people work in real life and you realize that it's not always the case that if you're more technical or more intelligent that you'll succeed sometimes things are a lot more nuanced you know so you need a lot of soft skills you need to be you need to be in general just a good worker and my intern manager used to say that it's hard to hire for like good data scientists because you could screen for intelligence you know by giving like probability questions and stuff but it's hard to screen for like laziness and and that's usually the biggest like false positives of hiring someone is that you realize like oh they're actually kind of lazy they just don't want to do things and that's yeah that's usually like the hardest thing to screen for but yeah like India and like if you're a data scientist p.m. or like software engineer even if you're not the most technical one or even you if you're not the smartest in class right now at school don't worry about it because that might not determine how good you are you will be at your job you know if you have like the grid and the ambition I think you might do well at any position yeah alright so that wraps up this conversation and as I mentioned earlier on the screen this video was sponsored by brilliant org it's a website that helps you master mathematical and computer science concepts through problem solving so what Joe mentioned earlier is this probability course and one example of the problems covered in this course is this one this says which of these events is most likely to happen when flipping a fair coin flip two or more heads when flipping three coins flip twenty or more heads when flipping thirty coins or flip 200 or more heads when I'm flipping 300 coins so I think this is actually pretty cool because it's pretty similar to the types of data science interview questions that you might actually get and there are other courses that cover different topics through problem solving too for example computer science fundamentals algorithms Python and even machine learning so if you want to get started with any of that use my referral link and the description below and the first 200 people will get 20% of their premium subscription anyway thank you as always
