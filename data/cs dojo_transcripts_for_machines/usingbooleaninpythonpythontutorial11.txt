hey everyone I talked about using boolean in Python in a few of my previous videos but I decided to make a whole new video about it because it's an important topic now boolean is just a type of data just like strings and integers that we've seen now examples of a string might be something like Microsoft Apple and banana and usually strings in Python are enclosed in either double quotes or single quotes examples of an integer might be something like 3 4 2 and 100 and what about boolean well for boolean there are only two possible values and there are true and false and a boolean is basically used to express if a certain logical condition is true or false now in Python there's a useful function called the type which we can use to find type of any value so for example if you write type of double quotes Microsoft then this gives us STR which stands for string and if we write type of let's say for this will let us know that this is an integer because it says int and if you write type of true note that true here is capitalized this gives us bull which stands for boolean and let's now see how we can use boolean berries actually you've already seen one use case of a boolean value in my ifelse videos so if you write for example a goes 3 and B equals 1 and then if a is greater than B colon 4 spaces prints a is greater than B then this Clause right here a greater than B is evaluated to be either true or false and in this particular case a which is 3 is greater than B which is 1 so this is evaluated to be true so it's sort of like saying if true then print a squared of B in this particular case a squared of B is true so that's printed right here so actually we get the same result by writing if true and again note that sure here is capitalized print a is greater than B once you run this cell you see that a squared of B is printed and actually you could also store the result of this condition a greater than B in a variable so let's call that variable boolean value or boolean and the score value and then we're gonna write this equals a greater than B and when I run this cell a greater than B is evaluated and that returns true and then this variable boolean value will have that value true so if you print boolean value we should see true and then after that you can write if boolean value four spaces print a is greater than B and when we run the cell we get the same result because boolean value is true so when should you use boolean values well they're basically useful when you want to do some complex logical operations so let's say you want to write a function called are you sad which is gonna take two boolean arguments is rainy and has umbrella and let's say from this function you want to return true and indicate that you're sad if it's raining and if you don't have an umbrella so you want to return true only when is raining it's true and how umbrella is false so you could write this function this way if is rainy equals true and has umbrella echoes that's double cosine false column then return true and else return false so this says you're only sad or you're going to only return true when is rainy is true and house umbrella is false and if that's not the case then return false so this function works just fine but you can simplify this a little bit more by writing if is rainy not has umbrella then returned true so this is exactly the same as saying if is rainy is true and house umbrella is not true or has umbrella is false then return true and basically this whole expression is rainy and not has umbrella will be evaluated to be either true or false and if this whole expression will be evaluated to be true then we're going to return true and if the whole expression becomes false then we go to the else clause and then we return false from our function and that actually suggests that we can further simplify this by writing return is rainy and not has umbrella and that's actually all we need so this Clause says we're going to return the result of this whole expression is rainy and not has umbrella and this whole expression will become true only when is rainy is true and has umbrella is not true or has umbrella is false so let's now run this cell and let's test this function if you right are you sad of true and false so if it's rainy and if you don't have an umbrella you should be sad so this should return true and it does and if you right are you sad of true and true so if it's rainy and if you do have an umbrella you shouldn't be sad so this function should return false and it does and if you want you can test it for all the other cases too and that will be false true and false false and either way this function should return false okay and here's a little exercise problem for you can you write a function called C greater than D plus E which is going to take three integer arguments C D and E and this function should return true only when C is greater than D plus E and otherwise it should return false so maybe pause the video right here if you want to try solving this problem yourself okay here's my solution here you could write if C greater than D plus e column then return true and else return false and this is just fine but you could also write it as return C greater than D plus E and this way if C is greater than D plus C this whole expression becomes true so we'll return true in that case and if that's not the case then this whole expression becomes false so we'll return that so let's just run this cell and test it I'm gonna write C greater than D plus e 3 1 1 C which is 3 is greater than 1 plus 1 so this should return true and it does and I'm gonna write C greater than and by the way you can just here press tab to automatically complete the rest of the function and then 3 1 2 3 is not greater than 1 plus 2 which is 3 so this should return false and it does ok and that's it for this video but if there is any topic I should cover in future videos or if anything was unclear in this video just let me know in a comment and as usual thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
