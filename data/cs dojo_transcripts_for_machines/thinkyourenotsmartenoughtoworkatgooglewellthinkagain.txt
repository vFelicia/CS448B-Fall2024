I worked at Google in Montreux as a software developer for about a year and when I was there some people said to me wow you're working at Google you must be so smart and I would say yeah I must be jokes aside I don't think it's your smartness or your intelligence that matters the most when it comes to getting a job at a company like Google I believe being persistent and being willing to try and fail in the first place are much much more important the first time I applied for a job there was when I was in my third year in university it was for the software developer intern position in Tokyo I didn't think I was good enough for the job but I applied anyway I mean I wasn't even studying computer science I was studying statistics so I thought how could I possibly compete with other candidates who were studying computer science two months later though I got an interview with them I was really happy and excited when I got that interview but eventually I got rejected since then over the course of two years or so I applied for four more positions at Google and I got rejected three more times the last time I tried though the fifth time I tried they finally accepted me and I started working as a software developer in Montreal Canada now think about that one company you really want to work for do you think you're good enough for them if you don't think you're good enough for them who cares really I would say why don't you just try anyway if you're lucky you might just get an interview with them even if you don't get an offer in the end it's still a good practice for going through job interviews and of course in the future you can try again again and again all right go back guys you
