hey guys so the other day I had an interview with Peter Scopus who is a data scientist with experience at companies like TuneIn which is an audio streaming company in San Francisco and in this interview he shared some tips that he used to get his sixfigure data science job and I thought it was really helpful so I want to share it with you guys today and hopefully you'll find it helpful too so you're a data science job at tune in was your really first data science job right right yeah could you tell us a little bit about like what you actually did there yeah so I feel like the the work I did there can kinda be separated into sort of a couple of different categories one sort of part of my job was kind of helping product managers design and implement and analyze a beat s so I'd sit down with a product manager and discuss you know a product or feature change and sort of the best way to test that change and then help design the experiment and then I sort of put together an analysis of that experiment to sort of help the product team think about how to move forward another aspect of my work there was sort of designing various metrics and putting together different types of dashboards to help you know the marketing team or the product team as we would be able to understand how things are working but a lot of my work in it I feel like sort of the bulk of my work was centered a little bit more around modeling and prediction so answering things like you know if our customers did X Y or Z can we predict what sort of they want to do on the platform or can we put you know a monetary value on a certain feature you know meaning if we we got rid of that feature how many of our you know paying customers would would churn know so prior to this call you were telling me that you struggled a little bit when you were trying to get your first data science job could you tell us a little bit about that um yeah yeah so like I said like a couple of the issues was you know learning like the different type of skills that I needed and and sort of stuff like that but I kind of felt like there's five sort of like really like major things that I learned that are like super important for getting your first data science job and the first one is sort of just making sure that you want sequel it's kind of the sort of like foundational skill at data science and it's definitely not the most like exciting skill but it's just like incredibly necessary another thing that's sort of really important is you know just being able to sort of like explain your experience in a way that makes sense to product managers and to executives so when you're in school and when you're doing research you're you know mostly surrounded by other technical people but when you're working for a company you know you're gonna be interacting you know with nontechnical people all the time and then all right um let's go through those sort of one by one okay so for sequel what do you think would be a good way to learn sequel so what I think is probably the the easiest way is to kind of just like learn by doing and there's definitely a lot of a lot of tutorials out there that I feel like kind of differ and how helpful they are I found this tutorial from mode analytics that was kind of like an introduction to sequel that I thought was super helpful and you know it was able to sort of help me prepare for like even the what I thought were the hardest sort of sequel questions I was given during the interview process right okay so for your second point of being able to explain your experience in a way that makes sense to PM's and executives because you may be you know X because you may be give us an example or maybe tell us a little bit more about that yeah so I felt like when I was first starting to apply like I don't know why I didn't think about this but just that there's going to be you know product managers and executives that are going to be part of the interview process and so you know a lot of times you'll be asked you know by them to talk about you know like a time that you use data to you know like analyze a problem or like analyze like a business problem and sort of when I first started interviewing I feel like I prepared for that question but I prepared to answer that question to like other technical people so like I felt like I had a good answer to that but I only had a good answer to that when I was explaining it to someone who like had a background in programming or had a background in statistics and so I basically had to sort of like go back and figure out a good way to explain it you know but to someone who doesn't have that background so how did you change that in your particular case I mean yeah so at UC Berkeley I researched carbon taxes and sort of the impact of them unlike manufacturing prices and so sort of in my whole like technical discussion of that I talked about the different models I used and the different assumptions I made and when I tried to do when I shifted that to sort of talk to you know a product manager about that I tried to walk them through more like a more I don't want say like a simple version but just like talking about like how old prices are impacted by taxes and sort of like how like we went about the the process of like trying to determine by how much so I guess you focused on the end result more then at the price itself like yeah yeah yeah less on I feel like that sort of like technical part of like how we got there and yeah more about like sort of like the impact of that project like what it means stuff like that okay let's go through the rest of the tip see you had it earlier okay yeah yeah so another another tip I have is just sort of putting together and and showcasing personal projects I think that this is sort of especially important for your first data job and when you're sort of like inexperienced in and maybe don't have much experience outside of school and this can be something as simple as just kind of going online and finding like a free public data set and putting together visualizations and sort of doing your own analysis or in my case what I what I also did was I just kind of used some connections and I was able to convince a company to to basically let me do sort of like basic data science work for them for for free I was just sort of like this is like a little bit of experience I could put on my resume and I'm sort of like talk to talk about two companies during interviews nice walk I know if they don't know is this did you do for them so it was mostly just like visualization stuff it was a I was like a commercial real estate company that had like various like sale and purchased data on like different like real estate transactions I could cross United States and so I just put like a couple of visualizations together about like where different like types of real estate transactions were happening and sort of like what different trends they could see stuff like that all right do you have any tips on how to like showcase your personal projects yeah I think like a really good way to do it is to just sort of like put together like a basic website where you can you know if you're putting together like different types of visualizations you can you know like post a couple of them they're sort of like talk about them and then I'll also have a link to to code like where your code is so that when you you know are interviewing and you've sent out your resume and it has that website you know on your resume recruiters and whoever else is looking would have a chance to sort of like browse your website and just like a general idea of sort of your skills related to that right okay so earlier you mentioned that you have five tips I think we've discussed three so far sequel being able to explain your experience in a certain way and showcasing projects well or the other two yeah so the other one are one of the other ones is just being able to sort of like showcase your like business or your product sense so you can kind of thing this is like you know being able to discuss with an interviewer how you would use data to define like the success of a product or whether like certain aspects of the business are doing well and you know being able to like understand and ask questions about like the product roadmap sort of like stuff like that I think that like your technical skills are super important but you know at the end of the day your job is you know to help the company you know grow or scale or you know improve their revenue stream or something like that so you need to take sort of like your background and always think of it in terms of like more of like a business mindset so how did you cultivate your business and product sense I feel like a couple of ways one was I I had found this tutorial that was on there's also on mode analytics actually and it was sort of like a like a business analytics type thing where it was more like focused on like case study questions like in terms of like oh this metric for some like hypothetical companies down how would you go about like thinking through sort of like the process of like trying to figure it figure out like why that's the case and I felt like that was helpful to prepare for like some of those case questions during the interview process but I also feel like what was also kind of helpful was like really just as I was going through the interview process like learning more about like various startups and like thinking through like what their goals were and just like thinking about you know like I can use data to you know help answer this question like oh I know what I could do for for this and it's kind of like stop thinking about you know like data and statistics in a vacuum and instead think of it more as like I can do this or use this methodology to like answer this question sort of like stuff like that so was he like using some apps and thinking about how you might use data for them yeah like that yeah that's like a like a really good strategy is you know like say you do have an interview at I don't know let's just let's just say like like Twitter or something you know you could you know use the app and think about like oh like I think like this would be like a good like product improvement or a good feature improvement or you know I wonder if like this is like a pain point for users and so you think about those questions and then think about to answer that I wish I had like this data or I think like you know this type of data would be super helpful and just kind of yeah like having an example of like a product and and and sort of thinking about ways to improvement and and sort of how you would like define improvement or how you would define like success of a feature okay and what was the last step you you had the last one was like being really good at the basics I think that a lot of aspiring like data science and analytics applicants kind of just immediately jump into you know fancy machine learning and deep learning models and they kind of forget about the basics of of like how to run a good a B tests how to clean data sort of the basics of statistics stuff like that and you know there's definitely a place for you know machine learning and deep learning type stuff but for your first data science job you're most likely not going to be working on you know that type of stuff you know unless you are coming out with a PhD and like even then you just don't have you know any experience and so like there's just a good chance you're not going to be on you know a team that sort of has the capability to to let you do a lot of that work and so just like knowing the basics and starting there is what I think is sort of like a really good strategy for fruit landing your first data job and how do you actually become good at those basics I mean in terms of like programming I mean we talked a little bit about like just being really good at sequel to get better at stuff like Python and R I think you know what's really important is you know like finding your own data or something like that and just kind of focusing on you know getting better at cleaning data getting better at you know putting together you know clean nicelooking visualizations and then in terms of statistics I don't really have like a great recommendation for like a statistics course but I would definitely you know spend time I'm like reading about how to run a good a B test just sort of the more like stats 101 stuff that I feel like people just like tend to forget about sometimes okay so those are Peters five tips but one thing he didn't mention is that in a lot of data science interviews they ask you probably the related questions and to practice those I actually recommend this videos sponsors website brilliant org brilliant courses have interactive problems and coding challenges the help you master math and computer science concepts through actively solving problems not just passively reading if you go to their probability course you may have defined the kinds of questions that 10 to be asked in their science interviews so if you want to get started with it and start learning by doing just go to my referrin like Briand or o /cs dojo and the first 200 people who sign up through the link will get 20%
