so ever since I started this channel I've gotten a lot of questions about working at Google like what's he like to work there but I realized that if I were to talk about it from my own experience it would be a little bit outdated because I was only there upon till about two years ago so instead I decided to interview a friend of mine Jane Lew who is currently a software engineer at Google in this interview we talked about things like what's he like to work there her advice on getting a job at companies like Google and her experience of being a female software engineer in this maledominated industry so here's the interview and I hope you enjoy all right so thanks so much for coming here thank you for having me yeah I appreciate it let's just get started with you know a basic question yeah so just could you introduce yourself for us yeah hi everyone I'm Jane and I'm a software engineer at Google in the Waterloo Kitchener office I've been at Google for a year now and I'm on the cloud healthcare team great so let's get started with your education okay so I understand that you were in the engineering science program at the University of Toronto okay no computer science yeah but eventually you got into coding you got your first coding internship yeah so how was what was that process like yeah so um so I guess I'll talk a little bit about what engineering science is about so this program is kind of like they want to give you two years of foundational studies and all sorts of engineering all different disciplines and after two years you can pick which option you want to go into so essentially you can pick electrical Computer Engineering and rural space civil engineering and stuff like that and for me after first year I wasn't completely sure which option I want to pick after two years but I was kind of narrowing down towards Electrical and Computer Engineering and I wanted to see if I couldn't get an internship just to see how it's actually like working as a software engineer and see if actually like it I want to pursue it for the rest of my studies so that's when I started to look around I was also thinking about moving to California for a little bit so that's when I started to look at software internship openings in California it just so happened that somewhat older in my program told me about engineering practicum program at Google it's basically a software internship geared towards first and second year students at universities and I was told that it's not really expected that you have a lot of coding experience or know so many data structures to get into engineering practicum so that's when I just applied and I want to take my chance at it and I mean obviously after I got the interview and I spent a lot of time studying for the interviews but in the end I got it and that was my first engineering internship the Google one yeah right like how did you study for me it was a combination of cracking the coding interview and also just talking to a pupper years a lot of people in my program already had a lot of interviewing experience with big companies so they kind of told me what are the common type of questions and what what are usually the data structures and algorithms they will ask you and interviews especially I introduced with like first and second year students and that's mostly how I got my practice cool and so eventually you went from just interning there to working there fulltime mmhm what was your transition like there um that's actually a pretty easy process usually I would say not just for Google for a lot of big companies once you've interned there especially if you've entered there multiple times as long as you've done well in your projects they are most likely to give you a return offer at the end of the internship so for my case actually I actually didn't even need to do additional interviews I got an offer for fulltime position when I was in fourth year I did some comparisons between other companies but in the end I decided Google my fit so that's how I signed a full time offer at Google nice and what do you work on as a software developer at Google so I'm currently on the cloud healthcare team it's a pretty new tune so probably not a lot of you have heard of it basically we are building healthcare solutions on Google cloud platform usually we say googles mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and use useful for us but in particular it's more that we are organizing the world's healthcare information and make it accessible useful and most importantly secure I can't talk about a lot of the products that we're working on right now but some of the stuff that we've already made public include a fire API so that's for medical health records DICOM api so that's for medical imaging records and we also have like machine learning solutions for healthcare data and just a lot of stuff around that right so the idea is using Google cloud to store medical data or maybe do something with it yeah yeah so a lot of our mission is about data interoperability and also how to help patients and providers with their experience overall okay and could you tell us about what your dayinthelife is like working there yeah I'm just a software engineer right now so my day in the left face pretty simple I would say so we have a free meals at Google as probably a lot of you know so I usually go in the morning and have breakfast and then I also get my morning coffee after that because we also have a barista bar at Google and then Wow I jerk my coffee I usually check my emails from last night because sometimes it's like you run things the day before you want to just check some updates coming from yesterday and then after that in the morning my team also has a daily stand up so during the standby usually everybody gives updates about what they've been working on and what they're planning to do next and then we should go to lunch together as a team and then in the afternoon that's where the bulk of working time is so it's mostly coding and then some team meetings or just project updates in general we also have a lot of like activities iGoogle so those are usually towards the end of the afternoon so we have a lot of Tech Talks hosted at Google Waterloo and we also have a weekly TGIF thank god it's almost Friday hosted towards the end of the afternoon on Thursdays where the whole office kind of get together and mingle and have some snacks and drinks and then afterwards I get dinner at Google that's that's my day iGoogle cool yeah so it sounds like you have like a lot of events happening but when do you actually get stuff done you know I think like as I said I usually a lot of the time in the afternoon is for you to get your work done and I would say like everyone at Google is really mindful about how they spend their time at those events so like for myself particularly if I'm really really busy with something then I just I would skip those events just so I can get my work done but then if the progress at work is a little bit slower then I would look up like is there any workshops that I want to do or is there anything I want to learn and that's when I would participate a little more on those things nice so you're being working there for one year two years now one year one year yeah so like after working there for one year do you have like any longterm goals there that you want to achieve like either at Google or maybe somewhere else I have to say I haven't really thought about that a lot I think for me as a pretty junior software developer I'd obviously want to spend more time learning different technologies and getting to know our codebase better and then later on I hope that in a few years I will be able to I guess take projects of bigger scope and design things at a bigger scale so I guess that will be my short term goal nice and what's your favorite part of working at Google I would say my favorite part is the culture I go I think it probably sounds really cliche to a lot of people but that's actually one of the big reasons why I picked to go back to Google for full time I just think in general everyone on Google is like super respectful and just the whole environment just feels very inclusive to me I feel like even if you do feel like there's any aggression Network or anything like that there's like so many channels where you can like voice your concerns and get your help that's my purse that's been my personal experience and that's just something that I really like how does it compare working at Google versus working at other companies like I don't really have that much experience working at other companies but as you said I interned at Intel before but it was actually altaira when I was there and then it was acquired by Intel while I was there for the internship so those two are actually kind of hard to compare because altaira was a pretty hardware focused company it's an FPGA company whereas Google is like pretty software centric so that's one of the differences um I feel like at Google because everything is focused around software people like move faster and projects move a little faster because you know it's just coding right but then at companies and Intel sorry I'll Terra when I was working there it was more like because a lot of things are centered around their fpga rollout and stuff like that things move a little slower and then all the software's have to kind of move around or hardware progress another small thing that I also noticed is that I feel like people in the software industry and also particularly at Google move around a lot so then you see a lot of I guess young faces and then a lot of people have them being a Google for that long whereas at Altera and I would say probably a lot of other hardware companies people stay there for a lot longer so you see like really senior people who have been there for a really long time so they really know what they're doing know they know like the software system inside out and stuff like that so that's another difference and I'm just kind of curious is there anything you don't like about working at Google I have to say there is nothing that would come to my mind right now I think overall I'm pretty happy with the working environment and projects and everything I mean that's why I'm still there I guess all right the next question is do you have any advice on getting a software developer job at companies like Google yeah so I would say my advice were probably more get be more geared towards people I guess seen universities still because I have anything out of university for that long but I feel like in general if you want to work at companies like Google after you graduate you would want to start looking at doing projects and kind of just demonstrate your skills and also learn more things while you're in university there's obviously a lot of ways that you can do this you can apply for internships like I did you can do side projects if you have any ideas you can also contribute to open source projects I think that's like a really big thing right now a lot of people are talking about it yeah and then also just if you if you have the option to take more software courses definitely do that and then try to do well in your course projects I think all of them will help you manage all that Google after you graduate okay and one thing that is sort of like hear about a lot you know about people working at companies like Google prestigious companies is they sometimes have a pollster syndrome have you had anything like that yeah of course I was there probably there's not that many people who haven't experienced it for me I guess in particular one thing that I always feel is that I feel like I haven't done enough or I just haven't produced enough results and stuff like that and I got like super anxious about it I guess earlier on when I first joined Google and then I started to talk to my manager and other people about it and then they sort of were giving me advice to view my work from technical perspective so for example I can ask other people what they think of my work I can ask my managers or peers for feedback and I can also just look at the progress of my project and compare to say our team team objectives or quarterly objectives and and then if you do it that way then you will have a more objective view of how you're doing turns your at work and then for me that's when I realized oh like I'm doing fine like I'm meeting all the objectives I'm meeting the dollar deadline so I'm doing fine so right now I'm feeling like less anxious now I'm pretty happy about the progress that I'm making so yeah all right and is there anything you can tell us about your experience of being a female software engineer in this maledominated industry yeah so um I have to say my experience has been mostly positive I think I've been really fortunate to I guess even for my classing engineering science everyone was really supportive and then after I started to do internships and after I started working fulltime at Google I feel like the environment is overall very inclusive and very supportive overall but I have to say there's definitely small aggressions that I experienced as a female software engineer so for example one of the things that I heard I really stuck with me was that when I got my first engineering practicum internship at Google some of my classmates told me I only got it because I was a girl at that time I didn't really think too much of them but the later I felt a little I heard about it but then again I started to look look at my I guess progress and skills from more technical perspective I know that I've been doing well at Google even when I was an intern so that was when I kind of shook it off and and know that I really deserves this okay so do you have any advice for other female software developers or maybe other minority groups yeah um so something that really helped me along the way is mentorship I think it really helps a lot when you know that there's someone there who might have more experience than you in the software industry to give you advice or just tell you that they've been through the same thing when you when you're going through something difficult so I would say if you feel like you're I guess a more junior member in the industry and you need any sort of advice you should never hesitate to reach out who are the people you look up to or you think might know more than you and ask them what they think and ask them for advice just ask them if they can get coffee or something like that and I would say if you feel like you are a little more senior in the industry or in your class and you might know something that might help other people I would encourage you to kind of take the time and see if anyone else might need help or just need someone to talk to I think if everyone could do that then we would really be able to foster kind of like a really positive a feeling of community withing the minorities within the software industry all right so this is my last question for you do you have any general advice for people who want to get into this field of software engineering um I would say my advice is pretty similar to what I said about how you can land a job at Google after you graduate it will be that if you're interested in the software industry then you should definitely take the time to improve your skills maybe through going through cracking the coding interview or just learning about data structures and algorithms in general and then if you want to get some practice you should definitely take every chance you can get to do some side projects and to opensource projects and if you get internships definitely do those internships and yeah that will be married by think alike alright that's it for this interview and if you're looking for a software engineer job right now you should check out the sponsor of this video triple bite Superboy is I would say one of the most prominent and useful websites for getting a software engineer job in either San Francisco New York Seattle or Los Angeles the way it works is you take their skill assessment quiz once and once you pass it you'll be able to start having you know onsite interviews with a bunch of companies so basically it's a way to skip the phone screening phase altogether and the reason I decided to have them as a sponsor of this video is because first of all I already knew about them before they contacted me for this and secondly because it's actually something I would personally use if I was looking for a software engineer job right now and if you want to check them out please use my referral link CS dojo that IO slash triple just to let them know that you guys came from here and by the way it's completely free for you guys for the candidates because it's only paid
