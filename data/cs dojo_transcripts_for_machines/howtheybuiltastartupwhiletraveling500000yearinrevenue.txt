they're paying us on average about a hundred bucks a month a little bit over that and so we're making half a million in annual revenue hey everyone today I have an interview for you guys with a couple who built their startup while traveling we talked about how they started their company the strategies they use to stay productive while traveling and the tech stack that they use to build their system among other things I personally learned a lot from this interview so hopefully you'll look to startups come cannae and that's the website scanning dot io and it's a user feedback tool and so we help other software companies keep track of feature requests and bug reports from their users that they can build a better product Yeah right so actually I had seen Kenny before oh really yeah yeah so what I saw was it's like a list of feature requests where people can like upload and maybe down boy right no down vote no their cell phone which iq+ and how long have we been running the company I think I left my fulltime job about three and a half years ago but I guess we launched Kenny almost two and a half years ago now yeah okay so that was your job at Facebook yep cause we're gonna react team at Facebook nice stop engineer yep and you were designer at Facebook I was a designer I worked on a messenger messenger yeah so you left three and a half years ago did you leave about the same time no funny enough I started and entered left pretty much right exactly when I started as your left oh yeah so I kind of stayed there for my year and a half while Andrew kind of worked on an earlier version of candy I guess and then eventually I left to join him yeah I like to say I recruited sir did you did you leave Facebook to work on this startup yep this is different flavor of this startup and so back then was called product pains and it was a community where people can post and vote on feature requests for any product publicly and so we had a couple companies using it eventually the companies wanted more and more features and we kind of turn it into a sass Landry pretended as candy and so yeah I was similar definitely yeah I mean eventually we found that we needed to make money a heart business and the earlier product pains the earlier version was very consumer focused and so there was not really a business model behind it and so we basically flipped it into a SAS tool and so we charged businesses to pay to use the platform yeah and how were you like how could you be so confident that you know you left good job it's not too comfortable it felt like um you know I wanted to get into startups and it felt like the things that I was learning at a big company weren't really relevant to startups like sales and marketing and recruiting and all that and so yeah I felt like I had to had to you know take a risk and go do it you know I had an idea that I was excited about and yeah that's turned out great I mean I think when you're going to startups there's there's no guarantee and this is our first venture together and so there was definitely like this feeling of you don't know what's gonna happen you don't know if you're gonna be successful and it definitely felt that way for a long time with product pains we just didn't really know where it was going for a long time I know we made our first dollar or first $20 and then we were like okay there's something going on here which brings us down here today right how long did it take you to you know make those firsts ready no yeah it was like a year and a half since I quit my job yeah but we weren't really focused on you know we were building a community like there wasn't even way for people to pay us and so we were just focused on growing this community with users giving feedback to companies and then companies started asking for the features and we said hey would you pay for those and then they said yeah and kind of happened naturally that we turn it into a moneymaking business which is great because we're bootstrapped and so we wouldn't be able to really contain doing this the way we want it to without being able to charge customers to make money off our work yeah yeah that's really cool so it's been two and a half years since since the launch since the launch yeah and like after that like after all that could you tell us about how the company is doing you know in terms of maybe the number of employees revenue numbers you can do my cherish sure yeah so we have 450 customers and those are paying customers and they're paying us on average about a hundred bucks a month a little bit over that and so we're making half a million in annual revenue which feels great for bootstrap company no no outside funding half a million is enough where we can support it like our business and a team we've hired three other people and they're all remote and so our team is in UK Estonia and Seattle and then we're here in Toronto and yeah we're really excited about where we are oh yeah so I went to the University of Waterloo and I studied a software engineering and I studied in a design program it was a joint program between York University and Sheridan College yeah I was like a regular 4 year program but very very much graphic design focused and less like digital tech focus yeah I eventually found my way to doing kind of more product design and UI design and stuff right so how did you get into tech yeah tons of my friends went to Waterloo honestly for for engineering and eventually participated in a bunch of hackathons which really opened my eyes to tech and San Francisco in general and I just really gravitated towards that and less of what I was studying at school which was a lot of like editorial design packaging stuff like that that's more traditional so I really really enjoyed that the the web aspect and so I just pretty much focused on that and did a bunch of internships and then eventually yeah I found my self at Facebook did you learn to do web stuff like digital stuff on your own then yeah school the school curriculum was behind in those aspects so we did have to take that onto ourselves just having a website it's kind of a must so in third year I think I just kind of said screw it like I'm not really learning how to build a website I'm just gonna go do this on my own during some summer and so I just got my own website and that's kind of how I picked my frontend skills yeah nice so after graduating from like those programs you bullets decided to work at Facebook I did this I tried to do a startup for six months and it didn't go super well my cofounder felt some pressure to go get a job and so it's kind of just me working fulltime and I had like the Facebook offer there's a backup option and I ended up taking at one point yeah I think it was a good move for both of us just to get some like foundation and like early job skills but there's nothing really that like sets you up for entrepreneurship other than doing it so yeah I'm glad we both got that taste but now we're like here doing our thing I think was super worthwhile like there's the the experience you get of you know being able to put together a project on your own which you might not get until you have some professional experience and then also financially like we probably couldn't have worked on it without you know funding if we didn't have a little bit of a financial cushion from working in a big company yeah that's really true right so working at Facebook was like very different from what you did not right 100% different I mean I wouldn't say I didn't like it like I really do like I really thought I did go to work there and I really enjoyed the people that I worked with but it wasn't like I knew from the beginning that I wanted to do my own company someday and so I made the jump eventually and yeah it's it's really different same thing for you yeah I mean I think at a big company like you're focused on this tiny tiny thing that's part of a huge huge picture and like for me I didn't really even know how my job correlated to growing Facebook's business I just was tasked to like make react native which was a part of react a great project used by a lot of companies and yeah whereas it can II it's hard to do anything without thinking about the ROI and like how is this gonna grow our business and if it's not worthwhile then we don't do it yeah that's really your impact a lot more directly yeah and the breath like you know here we're doing sales were doing marketing we're doing recruiting we're doing all this stuff that you know was totally abstracted away from your job as an engineer at Facebook which is cool it's fun to learn about a lot of new things to learn them yeah definitely so let's let's talk about you know how you've been traveling yeah building the company when did you decide to move out of San Francisco and why did you decide to move out of it yeah well since this was a great place to live if you're working at a big company or if you're trying to raise money but after we were after we left our big company and weren't trying to raise money it didn't feel like a great fit for us anymore it was it's really expensive really really expensive City and we had always kind of wanted to travel and you know we didn't have an office we didn't have employees we're gonna have investors there's no reason really keeping us there and so we thought why not go beat digital nomads for a little bit and we booked a ticket to London was our first destination just to kind of warm up with traveling and yeah we we ended up traveling for about two years after that yeah we're actually just now kind of slowing down a little bit and we decided to stay in Toronto so that's pretty exciting so were you like tired of traveling I think the biggest thing is loneliness is because we would stay in the city for about a month and then move around and you don't make a lot of friends that way just because you know even if you do meet people then you like leave immediately after and it's hard to find people who are gonna like travel tips from city to city with you and yeah I just missed like being around friends and so that was the big motivator for me was just being coming back and being around friends and having that camaraderie that you have you know hanging out with people that you know and like and yeah it's not for everyone that's for sure I would continue doing it but honestly and you Andrews made a big compromise for the last two years so thanks so when you're traveling would you like book on Airbnb for a month something like that yeah I booked flights yeah I mean we wouldn't like it's a tradeoff if you if you booked it farther in advance you get cheaper and better places but you get less flexibility if you booked it like last minute you get worse places for more money but you get a lot of flexibility so we would some end up somewhere in the middle where maybe we'd book it like a month in advance or we'd book like a couple of our next stops we'd never try to be like crazy planners but we wouldn't save it for the very last second so that we could slip in a nice place and yeah we would try to stay in Airbnb for a month and you know usually if you stay for a month there's a discount it can be as much as like 30 40 percent off and so you can get some great deals it makes it like very livable it was definitely way cheaper than living in like San Francisco like I think our average rent split between the two of us so it's maybe like $700 a month for the two years Wow which is pretty affordable compared to most cities yeah yeah especially like Southeast Asia right can you make it over there is just like meals or a dollar like it's crazy it's so cheap yeah yeah yeah we actually travel the world and save money yeah a lot of you asked how do you how do you afford to travel so much like we're saving yeah yeah yeah I think if you have the flexibility like I would recommend anybody should like try it and honestly if you don't like it just come back it's not a big deal yeah yeah and what was he like to you know try to build a company well chocolatine it was challenging I mean we weren't just like traveling right like we were working fulltime and so every day it's like okay where's the cafe we gotta find a cafe with WiFi and bathrooms and food and outlets and all that and that can be a struggle you know you get to a new place you get to like you know we're in like Ho Chi Minh City and we're like okay where's the cafe today and it's just like they did have them they've got like great tea shops and whatnot and like that was the ongoing struggle was like finding a good place to work but we did and a lot of times we work from home and um yeah I don't know I think I think well well and what's it being like well like what was he like to you know work with people remotely yeah yeah we kind of figured it out as we go as we went and yeah I don't know like we we had to think about like especially for something like customer success or marketing and something that we haven't actually worked in a job like this before and so we just think about like what do we do on a daily basis you know we're like this is how we talk to customers this is how we do support and then yeah we help them get on boarded to what we're doing and I would say it's been a learning process as still as a learning process like the next time we hire somebody we have to sit down and think about it really hard about like okay what is this person gonna be doing and how are we gonna get and make them successful but yeah overall you know lots of communication early on and then and so people are on boarded and then yeah we have to weekly meetings we have a meeting on Monday and Friday where everybody attends and Monday is like how's your weekend what are you working on this week and then Friday's like what did you work on this week what are you doing this weekend um so it's pretty casual you know we don't like a lot of meetings but I think face time is important just keeping in touch with people while your remote is really important and so yeah and as a remote team like we don't see each other that often so what we're planning on doing is team offsite or retreat or however you like to call it where we bring everyone together in some city around the world just for around a week so we've done two at least so we did our first one Lisbon and our second one in split in Croatia and then our third one is in Denver in September so just I think it's a great way for your team to get some like real personal like hangout time cuz you just it's not the same when you work with someone and you only see them via video chat it's a totally different vibe and we think it's really important for our team to just connect like on a personal level yeah they have been really fun yeah yeah yeah do you think it would have been easier if it wasn't a Remo team like there's definitely something nice to like be in the same offices your coworkers work with your coworkers see them every day but I just think it's like I don't know it feels like remote it's kind of the future it feels like that's where things are headed and especially for us when we were general digital nomads it seemed like that was the only company that we could build like we're not gonna build like a digital nomad troupe of people like traveling together and so yeah I just felt like the company that we had the build the company that we wanted to build and so that's what we did yeah anything a lot of people today are looking for a remote work and we just have like way more access I think to talent across the world which is letting a big deal for us when you know my competition for talent is so high but yeah I think just the flexibility of it personally like I enjoy work from home when I feel like it I enjoy going to a cafe when I feel like it I don't I enjoy not having to go into an office so yeah I think it's like I think it's great yeah it sounds like you you really enjoy this yeah yeah I think everyone on the team does to like people have families and they like to spend time with their families people like we wouldn't be able to work together because we're in totally different places so this team is because we're alone I think now before we go to the next section about their productivity and their tech stack I want to quickly mention this video sponsor skew share skew share is an online learning community for creators with more than 25,000 classes in coding design business and more for example you might want to check out one of their web development courses the JavaScript toolkit write cleaner faster and better code just looking through this course quickly I can see that the production quality is really good and this is definitely something I would personally check out if I was trying to improve my JavaScript skills right now now you can check out Skillshare for free for two months with my referral link in the description below and after that it only cost around $10 a month if you decide to using them alright now back to the video how did you stay productive when you didn't have an office yeah I mean we never had we never had an office so we always had to figure out what productivity means to us and I think that's really different for everyone like even between me and Angie like we have different work styles like for me I really like to go to cafes I just feel really really productive when I go to a cafe I don't know you might feel a little different I feel similarly yet yeah or like some days you're gonna work at home it just depends on your day to day and that in like again remote work just allows us to decide when we wake up in the morning what we feel like so yeah it's just like what do you feel like today what do you need to be productive do you need like coffee do you need to like a list and just make sure you have those and I think you're in productive you're in a productive zone yeah one thing that that we learned from Facebook was like you don't measure someone's productivity based on hours worked it's not like you know they need to show up at a certain time and leave it a certain time and so for us we don't really measure our own productivity based on how many hours we're working or based on you know like ninetofive kind of thing like what's important to us is our output and that our company is growing and doing well and I think especially as founders we feel like pressure like you were asking like how do you stay productive right like we feel pressure like you know at first it was like if we don't you know work then our company fails and now it's like if we don't work not only does our company fail but then our team disappointed us and so there's just like so much pressure just like keep going moving forward that I couldn't imagine like you know not being productive but also yeah I think I think it's important to separate like home mode versus work mode especially you work from home you know like you you can't just like roll out of bed in your pajamas at work because then you're feeling like super lazy you know you have to like shower and get dressed and like be in work mode when you go to work if you're gonna even if you work from home so yeah I really think just having that mindset of like going to work even if you're working from home is important alright and are there any like particular tools that you recommend for staying productive interesting what I mean I literally my task list is like code editor you know it's an atom and I just have like a bunch of boxes and I change them to check marks and I'm done but um I mean there's one tool that I use called cube serve and it it kind of just tracks what you do in your computer and so can help you know like this is how much time you're spending on productive things like you know your code editor and this is how much time you're spending on unproductive things like Netflix and hacker news and whatever and so for me I feel motivated because there's a little percentage counter like in the dock of my Mac that says like you're like 81 percent productive today you've worked like four hours and 30 minutes of productive time and I want to like drive that up like every day I want to be like as productive as possible yeah I like that one it's kind of like a little bit of a mental hack and yeah I don't know the other side of things like I also feel like it's important to not get kind of too sucked into your screen and stare at all the time so I have this app called healthier that I've set to make me leave the computer every hour for one to two minutes it just helps me kind of make sure I'm just not kind of deteriorating in my seat so yeah that's I don't know if it helps with productivity but I think it's it's good for just health in general okay going to a different topic what's the tech slack that you use for it Kenny yeah it's all JavaScript and so we've got a you know react on the frontend of course cuz I used to work on that and then note on the backend for our database we use MongoDB and it's all hosted on AWS how it is you decide to use those um I mean really it's kind of like how many start up I think should be formed is my opinions like um it's what you know what and what I knew you know I was we're gonna react to my new JavaScript really well and it kind of makes sense for use JavaScript on the front end you know JavaScript very well like why not use it on the back end for a database like MongoDB is pretty controversial these days but it's like what I knew and what was really easy to get started and sort great for us so far it'll be the same thing it's like it's what I knew all this stuff is just like what I knew and so that's what we started with right it's worked out I think it's a pretty common dr. Hoffler yeah it's not too crazy yeah yeah did you have any like difficulties any any point like building you know this product on your own like I was opposed to working on Facebook yeah I mean I had never built a product like I had built side projects but nothing like to this scale and so it's definitely been a learning process you know and now that we have like customers there's like security and stuff involved and you know we've been learning a lot about you know scaling our app up but I remember like there are some significant difficulties when we went from like clientside rendering to serverside rendering or like when we went from one server to having multiple servers and just like these kind of like 0 to 1 steps we're difficult but you know we're so much more well put together now that we've got all that stuff but there's a lot ahead of us right so that was that was like a lot of learning involved to you yeah yeah especially like we did service I've been doing before next jest existed and so we kind of had to just like plug a bunch of stuff together cuz that's how people used to do it and now that we've got a bunch of stuff plugged together it doesn't really make sense to like tear all apart to move to next chance and so that's an interesting place where that we're in right yeah and are there any like particular resources for learning JavaScript react no and like those tools yeah that's kind of a tough one because I learned it kind of a long time ago but uh yeah I mean so like I learned react from joining the react team and learning it from literally the people that like invented it and popularized it and so you know that's one way go join the reaction of Facebook but yeah I think like one cool website that I'm really excited about these days is repli'd where you can just spin up like a coding environment for any programming language JavaScript node no PHP anything and just start coding and then you get like the output right there and they support react and you can build like websites there and so I think that's really cool and you're just like hacking around you don't have to worry about like setting up here environment I don't know if you can really like learn JavaScript but you can definitely play around there but otherwise it's just like try to build something see what walls you run into and yeah Google it you know try to solve your own problems because I think a lot of how I learned I totally agree like that's the best way is just like dive in and you know pick a project and try to do it and when you get stuck just like Stack Overflow like that's the best resource for me honestly when I was learning in front and stuff it was it was great and yeah whenever somebody asked like about for a book or something I have no idea sorry that's okay Oh how does your learn front end stuff yeah I mean literally like I was like I'm gonna build my portfolio website the first one was like just vanilla HTML CSS but the second one I for some reason did decide to use WordPress which a lot of people were using at that point but I just thought I would extra challenge myself and so I don't know yeah I was literally just when I got stuck I literally googled a problem that I had and it was usually like the first like overflow link and I just click it and I implement it and it works and then from then on I remember how to do it right so where I can school it again yeah yeah it's it's really as simple as that I think I guess that works yeah I mean I'm special for frontend where's like you don't yeah you don't need to have all that like mathematical background and all this logic stuff like yeah I think it's pretty straightforward all right so it's just one last question yeah is there anything you want to add to this conversation ooh I would say build side projects I would say like even if you know you're you're at a fulltime job now start hacking on things like like especially if you can find someone that you work really well with I think that's like one of the big things for us was having someone else to bounce ideas off of or like just go check on certain things just go and build stuff honestly like there's you have free time like do it you get a good taste of what it's like to yeah just get started in the startup world yeah I think a big one for us was we made our first dollar before we launched and so then by the time we launched we knew that we could make money and so I would encourage people who want to start a software business to try to make their first dollar as fast as possible and then like they can do that by solving a problem you can only make money when you're solving a problem for somebody and so yeah solve a problem for somebody charge them for it and then launch and it'll be a pretty good start not saying that's the formula for like a billion dollar company but you kind of get like a small software business off the ground I think that's absolutely do it yeah oh great thank you so much thank you
