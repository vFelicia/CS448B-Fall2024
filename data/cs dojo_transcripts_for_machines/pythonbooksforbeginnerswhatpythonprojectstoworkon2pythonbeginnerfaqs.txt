hi everyone in this video I'm gonna serve two of the most frequently asked questions by Python beginners first of all do you have any book recommendations for Python beginners and the second question is what type of Python projects should I work on after learning the basics so first of all python books for beginners actually personally I haven't read a lot of books for Python so I decided to ask my Twitter and LinkedIn followers about this and they recommended three books automate the boring stuff with Python Python crash course and learn Python the hard way so the only one I've personally read out of these is learn Python the hard way I remember it's pretty good but it seems like with my followers actually automate the boring stuff with Python is more popular I'm actually not too sure about the other book Python crash course but it seems like it's pretty popular too and it has good ratings on Amazon I waste anyway if I were you I would try you know automate the boring stuff with Python first and then if you don't like it I would try the other two books okay the second question was what type of projects should I work on after learning the Python basics well there are a few options here first one is to work on a web app like a website with either Django or flask you need to actually learn HTML CSS and JavaScript to be able to do that and I actually don't have a lot of experience with you know either flask or Django but I've heard that for beginner it's much easier to use a flask than jungle because it has you know fewer components built in and it's easier to see how everything fits together with flask than with Django so if I were you I would start with flask when you're ready to you know start building something more serious then I would start learning Django after that and to learn all of those things I recommend video websites like plura site udemy YouTube and I've heard that for JavaScript in particular this website called free code camp is pretty good and it's free too okay the second option for a project is if you're interested in stuff like data science machine and their analysis you can start working on problems on this website called cargo so I've talked about you know how to learn these things in my video about what you can do with Python but basically the idea is if you want to learn machine learning you should start with a machine learning course by either Stanford or Celtic and afla you can start working on problems on this website called cargo for data analysis and data visualization I have an introduction video right here on YouTube and I also have a full course on the same topic on this website called pleura site now either of these options is pretty good you know making a web app or working on a machine learning project but the only thing is to do either of these projects you'll need to learn something extra either JavaScript or machine learning so you might say that's kind of too much well if that's the case there's another option you can either build a game with PI game or a simple desktop application with QT or TK intern now like I said in one of my previous videos Python is actually not the best language for either building games or desktop applications but I think it's good enough to build one of these if you just want to practice using you know Python so I've talked about a bunch of different things in my Python tutorial series like variables loops functions and objects and classes and if you just want a way to practice using these you know building games or desktop up okay so see it's just good enough and then later on you can just move on to something more practical like a web application or a machine learning project all right that's it for this video and on my previous video some people ask me about my vacation and I'm not on my vacation yet I'm going to be soon my flight is at the end of August so I'm planning to you know hopefully make a few more videos before them so that you know you guys have something to learn from while I'm away anyway think you guys always for watching my videos and I'll see you guys in the next one
