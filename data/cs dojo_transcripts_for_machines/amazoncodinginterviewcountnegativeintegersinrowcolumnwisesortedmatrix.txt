here's a coding interview question from Amazon it is find the number of negative integers in a rowwise and columnwise sorting Matrix so here's an example as you can see the numbers in the Matrix are sorted rowwise and column wise and here we have four negative numbers so our function let's say funk should return four in this case here's a naive solution for this problem we'll just start from the first row and we'll count the number of negative numbers one by one so we find three negative numbers here and in the second row we find just one negative number and in the third row in the last row we find zero negative numbers so we add them up and we get four in this case the worst case scenario for this solution is when we have all negative numbers in The Matrix and in that that case we'll need to Traverse all the elements in the array or Matrix so the time complexity for this solution would be big of n * m where n is the number of rows we have and M is the number of columns we have in the Matrix here's the optimal solution for this problem we'll start from the top right corner and we'll find the position of the last negative number in the first row and using that information we'll find the position of the last negative number in the second row this one and so on until we get to the last row or we don't have any more negative numbers to count for the first row the position of the last negative numb is negative 1 is two so we'll know that the number of negative numbers in this row is just three and same thing with the second row the position of the last negative number is zero so the number of negative numbers is just one here and we have zero negative numbers in the last row we'll add them up and we get the answer four the time complexity for this solution is an order of n plus M where again n is the number of rows and M is a number of columns we have so here's the optimal solution in code we're defining our function here with the Matrix and the number of rows and the number of columns as input we're initializing count to zero which we're going to use to keep track of the number of negative numbers we've seen so far and I to zero which is our row index and J to M minus one which is our column index so we'll use I and J to keep track of which element we looking at so while J is larger than or equal to zero so we still have more negative numbers to count and I is less than n so we haven't got to the last row yet if the element we're looking at m i j is a negative number then we found the last negative number in the row so we increment the count with J + one and then we go to the next row if the number we're looking at is not a negative number then we'll move our pointer to the left or we'll try the same thing with the number on the left and we'll repeat this process over and over again until we get the total number of negative numbers in this Matrix and then we're going to return that all right thanks for watching this video if you're watching this on YouTube make sure to check out the original article on geeksport Geeks in the description below
