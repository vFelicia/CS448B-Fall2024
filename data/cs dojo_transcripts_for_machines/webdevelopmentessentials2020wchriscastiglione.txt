everyone sorry it's been a while since my last video but I'm back with a new video today this is sort of my first crowdsource video I guess where it was originally submitted by someone in our community with some my own comments and edits on top of it this one was originally created by Chris from bon mots calm which is a website for learning Python JavaScript and a few other languages he's also an adjunct professor at Columbia University looking through this video I thought it's really highquality and you'll be useful for a lot of you guys especially for those of you who are just getting started with what they want and that's why I decided to share it with you guys today in this video he covered topics like what's a text tag backend databases and frontend frameworks and a lot more so let's just get right into it so a tech stack is basically this analogy of layers of how we think about a website so really the top three are the most important here the frontend is what you see so if you go to a website right everything you see is the front end the back end or the serverside language is this blue one here this is kind of the brain behind everything that's happening and the database is where all the data is stored so for example if you come to the Zappos website if you see the home page when you go there what you see is the frontend let's say you click on a shoe you're like I'm gonna buy a shoe the next page you see what you see is also the front end but what you might not have known is that in between your clicking there's lots of data being processed from the server to your computer and back and forth and that processing is generally done by what we call the backend language or the serverside language either for those are the same and there's also this database which tends to be represented by this little shape here this little icon like a cylinder and this is where the data is served it's more or less like an excel sheet think of an excel sheet with rows and tables the rows and columns and tables and it's where you put the data so if you were to buy something right and login your data will get stored in this database well now that we have just a highlevel you know understanding of these these main terms because I'm going to use them a lot the thing is that each of these layers has different languages that falls into them so these are like become categories right for how we think about choosing our tools at the frontend language we have HTML CSS and JavaScript on the server side we have Java we have Python we have Ruby a PHP in the database excetera etc right so as we go through this it'll be helpful to think of think of these layers when we are you know putting together this idea especially if you're asking yourself which language should I start with because maybe you're completely new to programming so let's jump into that and and I will say kind of one rule of thumb which makes this a little bit easier is if you are just getting started you're going to want to learn the front end HTML CSS and JavaScript all three of those and you're gonna want to pick one serverside language right one backend language so for example that could be Python and then one database so this here this here at the top this is a really good place to start I would say if you just want to just stop watching right now because you're like that's enough this would be like the main takeaways like just learn the basics of HTML CSS and JavaScript Python in sequel and that's a really good foundation but like I said there's lots of options out there and you might want to know a little bit more about how those options compare and when and why to choose certain options so that's what we're gonna get into ok so for the back end there's three options that are very popular specifically for becoming a web developer and a web developer in in my mind is someone who's building web sites building interfaces building you know maybe mobile apps as well right and just to distinguish that from somebody who's perhaps learning to code or program in order to do graphing or just some kind of AI analytics right we're talking specifically about websites and apps in this video and so for that these are three of the most popular options that are out there so where do they come from Python and Ruby they've been around for quite a bit since 1991 and PHP as well it's it's from a 90s grunge era 1994 you know so these have all been around since the 90s so one good thing about that is that you know they've all been tried and true over the years they have been around there are big communities for each of them and the each of their pros and cons so one pro of Python is that well it is one of the most popular languages and popularity is important in that if something's popular it means it's probably gonna be around for a while it also means there's lots more books and job opportunities for it so Python definitely has that going for it but it wasn't always that way Ruby around 20072008 was becoming one of the most popular of all these languages and that's because there was a lot of breakout websites that started using Ruby and specifically the Ruby on Rails framework sites like Twitter Airbnb Shopify Hulu a bunch of these sites in PHP it's kind of one of the older ones of these like I know I said they all started in the 90s but it has this kind of like legacy feelings you a lot of people because it's been around and got really popular first so you'll see a lot of sites from like the early 2000s so sites like Facebook Wikipedia lots of ecommerce sites oh and WordPress all builds on PHP so PHP still used today and it's had a lot of updating and evolution since then some people give it a bad rap because back in the day it was so easy to get started coding in PHP and really anyone can do it and because of that there was lots of security vulnerabilities back in the early code a lot of that's been updated and fixed and really evolved since then although the reputation hasn't as maybe quite made it hasn't quite made it along in some in some arenas you know I think the people that use it you know and that know it are feeling really really strong about but it's just something that you may encounter and at the same time be you know because there's so many sites that had been built on it there's a lot of jobs in PHP as well Stack Overflow publishes every year this survey that they do of many of the different people that read Stack Overflow and professional developers and they put together this list of kind of kind of the best of the year and just to give you a sense you know you can see here the frontend languages that I mentioned HTML CSS and JavaScript up at the top quite popular right that's why I was saying need to know it sequel which we'll talk about in a second which is the database language next and Python that backend language there so as I was saying you know developers agree 9 out of 10 developers agree not quite but you know a lot of developers agree here that these are the main ones to choose and then there are you know quite a bit of other ones why would you choose one over the other you know a lot of my students will ask me and I'll say hey Chris you know is one better than the other is Ruby better than Python the real truth of it is it's not about better or worse it has more to do with maybe you know what project you're working on for example if the site is already built in Python it makes sense to just keep building in Python for most cases you know or Ruby or vice versa in some cases let's just say you wanted to make a blog you're like I know I just want to make a blog or like a simple web site with web pages well for that WordPress is a really good option WordPress is going to save you a lot of time you know with all the upload functionality that that a blog would need and text editors and all this stuff and so in that case you're gonna want to go with WordPress and in that case you're going to want to use PHP so what you'll find is as you dig into you know the different things that are out there you're going to see that different frameworks and different jobs and different web sites in 2020 you know are still going to be using PHP are still going to be using you know some legacy Python libraries and all this kind of stuff and then you know that might be the reason why you choose it based on the job okay so I wanted to add a few comments here first of all Chris didn't mention it but no js' is also another good option for back into bonds like Chris said I want to emphasize that you know the language you learn really depends on the kind of job you want to get or the kind of project you want to work on so if you're looking to get a job eventually I would say just look at the job descriptions of the kinds of jobs you want to get and then look at you know what languages are required for those and if you have say an open source project that you want to contribute to in mind then look at what language they use and just learn that language so that you know you can contribute and practice anyway let's go back to the video when we talk about databases my sequel is still king is one of the most popular relational databases out there followed very closely by Postgres and microsoft sequel ms sequel here no sequel which is a way of really having unstructured data if you if you're new to databases you can imagine that a database is like an excel sheet as I said there's rows and columns right and that's quite structured if you've used a database or an excel sheet you have to name the rows and columns and thinks they're kind of like you know like stuck right there like in one place no sequel on the other hand is a way of organizing your data where you don't actually have to you know label it beforehand you could have lots of data and this gives you you know different opportunities of what you can do for accessing that data for storing that data for speeding up collection of that data let's metadata you know data about data of what people are doing on your sites can all kind of be stored in something like MongoDB and and I'd say MongoDB is the most popular still and Couchbase is another another one that's gaining some popularity light a lightweight database if you're just kind of looking maybe to do some local development you may run into sequel light you know sequel light is it's just light lightweight meaning it's not a lot of complexity it's not a lot to download or upload you know it's just it's just kind of simple it's kind of the barebones and while you could launch a website on the web using sequel Lite for sure it's definitely possible I think it tends to be tends to be for like small projects you know or just kind of you know practice development that kind of thing and here's a look at the state of the databases and you can see from this 2019 poll we have my sequel leading with Postgres after that and down and down the list from here so here I asked Chris about how people should choose no sequel versus sequel and he said the phone sometimes you don't have a choice between them for example if you're working with a wordpress you might want to use my sequel because that's the technology that works the best with WordPress otherwise no Seco can be a good choice in a few different cases one example he gave me is when you have a lot of columns in your data so let's say a hospital has some data on its patients and each patient could have up to a thousand attributes then with sequel you might represent that with the table with at least a thousand columns with each column representing each attribute and each row representing each patients when you have data like this instead of using sequel like that you might want to use a key value storage system in Nasik Oh kind of like that anyway I'll let me know if you want me to do a deep dive on this for now let's go back to the video when we talk about the front end we have frontend frameworks that can help us you know design and make user interfaces a lot quicker so why would you want that you know what problem does that solve we'll just imagine that every time you're making a new website if you're prototyping or doing the doing the early versions of it you know you don't want to have to choose the button color and you know the font size and you know all of the layout margins and everything every single time it just takes a lot of time so with a framework like this in 2020 we have bootstrap is still leading as being one of the most popular frontend frameworks that are out there that will allow you to instantly just just kind of download this and get running with really just a nicely formatted and structured you know wellbalanced looking website you could just kind of put some any text to any image and it's it's gonna look pretty good and that's what something like bootstrap brings materialise you know I haven't used them to realize but I've heard for it's pretty good and I know it's gaining some popularity but bootstrap I've been using it for about 10 years now I want to say came out about ten years ago out of that of Twitter I have some developers from Twitter and and it's still it's still strong and I would HIGHLY highly recommend this be learned in 2020 javascript libraries so in 2020 learning a JavaScript library is essential for professional web developer now there's a few different options out there and I'm gonna look we're gonna look at each of those briefly just a reminder javascript is one of the most popular languages or the most popular language at the moment you know according to the Stack Overflow poll and I think one of the reasons is because of all the things that you can do now with these different JavaScript libraries so if you're not familiar with JavaScript libraries which is one reason why we have them and one reason why they're so exciting is because now the way our user interfaces or you eyes look on a site like Facebook let's say is that we have different components of a website that are updating asynchronously right so you know birthdays or chat can update differently from stories right and you can see one part of the website update or you can send data without the other components all changing or having to refresh a lot of these ideas have been around for a while but plain vanilla JavaScript isn't necessarily so great you know keeping this organized and some of these complexities scalable and quick and in check and so that's where learning you know JavaScript first and then taking one of these frameworks to really build out user inner Isis comes into play now I'm using Facebook here as an example because it's it's popular use case that everybody knows but also because it's Facebook that has built react which is you know still the most popular JavaScript framework that's out there now you can see view is you know technically has more stars here this is star history from github you know we're people developers and people that have good about accounts can just star and say they like something that doesn't really I think fully speak to the influence and power that react has in the space because if you were to looked you know just hues using react it's based you know it's um it comes out of Facebook and Facebook uses it as well as just you know dozens of other really highprofile companies so so if you might be catching on in the next few years it was developed by an exgoogler but it's not you know from Google like officially as reactive looking at web frameworks just to kind of you know put some of this in in perspective you can see we have react here as being the number two web framework followed by angular and view is down the list quite a bit here as well but yeah you never know you know where things will go in Twenty twenty one twenty twenty two if you could definitely you know continue to catch up also keep in mind these list this is serious not just JavaScript frameworks these are a variety of different web frameworks but it does just give you a sense of how popular react is you may be wondering why I didn't mention jQuery in the mix jQuery you know it seems to be around it has a legacy following it's still used but it's just not gaining in popularity and it's really not it's really not the same for building UI and web functionality like react has it's jQuery is more for animation and loading asynchronous data calls and and a lot more that I would have to go into but but yeah definitely worth knowing and if you were to work at a bigger company even in twenty twenty people are still using jQuery for sure so it's there it's worth knowing about but um but I would say you know if you had to choose between one of the two react is the way to go tools there's quite a bit of tools that you're going to want to know git git is a way to commit which is more or less like uploading and sharing your code so that you can make revisions over time and share that code with other people at your company or on the web so git I would say start at github comm there's some really great resources there FTP probably just a basic skill to have we don't use it that much anymore I'm big like a big company project wouldn't use FTP to upload their website but especially if you're getting started it's just kind of like a handy way to upload and download files and share things and sometimes if you're doing some simple websites or something with WordPress it sometimes just easy to know and it you could learn it in like 10 minutes it's not super hard to learn the basics something like cyberduck is a free FTP client that you can download and try that out of course you'll need hosting to make that happen and we'll talk about that in just a second commandline you're gonna want on the command line is that black box that allows you to write commands to do upload and download things with your code or execute commands on your computer you're gonna want to know that domain registration these are three places that I go to buy domains and these are all quite popular they've been around for a while GoDaddy has been around for decades now Namecheap is a lot like GoDaddy but it's a little cheaper so it says and DNS simple is a great option if you especially for organizations especially if you're doing something with rails or Heroku I think he just makes the inner creation of of launching and messing with the name wreck the the records the name records and everything a lot easier we use it at one month and I think it's a really good enterprise solution for that reason an IDE is basically or a text her sublime has been a favorite for a long time and I still use it because it's honestly just easy and simple but a lot of people in the past year past few years have been moving to visual studio code or vs code and that's really especially if you're working on bigger projects or using lots of dependencies you know bringing in lots of these different frameworks and tools it definitely makes coding a lot quicker in that regard so I'd say these your two best options for 2020 hosting there's a lot of options out there if you want allinone hosting you can use something like square space or Wix or WordPress com this is more or less where you just go to this website and you get the front end the back end the server everything immediately you can just start just start making a website now the downside of that is you're not gonna have too much access to actually touching the code or you know messing with the dials of how the server works or all that kind of stuff but it is the probably like the most affordable and easiest way to just get started static hosting static hosting is a way that you can upload your code so it ends up becoming just HTML CSS and JavaScript that's the static part about it something like github pages is a free and really easy way to just kind of launch a home page and get a URL immediately and edify is also another option you're gonna want to look out there shared hosting the shared hosting is a portable way to launch a website something like Bluehost or media temple are great options for that and cloud hosting which is really I would say essential for enterprise if you're launching you know a startup or something a bigger kind of site for a company you're looking at Heroku AWS Linode or digitalocean mobile dev for for mobile dev we're looking here not at the native iOS or you know Android Java frameworks but we're talking about using you know HTML CSS and JavaScript these as our tools for making mobile we're making mobile apps in this arena react native is is the clear dominant player here so react native it's very similar if you learn react to learn react native right it's in that ballpark there followed by iconic flutter and native script the thing that the react native has again is just so many people using it which really speaks to the community and you know the amount of attention that the the framework is getting so that's definitely one thing to really consider when you're picking a mobile dev framework flutter on the other hand also has you know quite a big quite a quite a lot of big names behind it as well New York Times Square $0.10 a few of these there so I would say these are the two that you'd really want to pay attention to if you're just getting into this if you want to go deeper there's lots of resources on the web where you can go you know deeper into the pros and cons and approaches of each of these okay now that's it for this video this presentation was again by Chris from one man's calm you can check out his website by going to one man's calm as I said at the beginning I'm sorry it took me a while to get back on this channel but I am back and I'm planning to make more videos in the future so let me know if you have any video requests or anything like that in the comment section below alright I thank you always for watching our videos and I will see you guys in the next one
