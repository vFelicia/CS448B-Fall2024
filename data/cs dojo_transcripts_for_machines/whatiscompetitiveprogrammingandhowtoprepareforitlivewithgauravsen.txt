okay I think we are live now hey everyone welcome to CS dojo and we have a guest today with us his name is Gaurav Shen and he's also known as JK CS hey everyone say say hi everyone okay so today you know we're gonna do a 20 about 23 minutes of interview and then seven minutes of audience Q&A with you guys and you know a little bit about Gaurav he has a YouTube channel about computer programming I'm gonna put a link you know to his YouTube channel in the description below and just in case you're curious he is from Mumbai so today you know we're gonna talk about what is competitive programming why should people care about it and then how did you prepare for it so let me add this get started could you first introduce yourself to everyone since the past four years I've been making vlogs and small videos on compare programming and it's been some time now but I think problemsolving is one of the key things if you are looking for not just interviews but in general getting better at computer science so I'm really passionate about problemsolving and algorithms and data structures is what you need for that so that's what I like to pursue I mean understanding okay and just curious how did you get started with like problem solving in general so problem solving it was there since I think the first year of my college education and although the problems then the much much simpler but I had friends who used to pick up stuff like Traveling Salesman or something like that and you try to solve that although it had been sought by many other people already but the excitement is when you are trying to tell a computer what you what you wanted to do and also after thinking a lot so that's that's how problemsolving came in for me I think in in first year or second year okay so you get started by solving problems that had already been solved and then you should be on to like newer problems I guess yeah so the popular versions of problems were how I started off with and later on we went into a little more specialized things like computer programming and stuff okay and could you explain what is programming I mean what is competitive programming there's a computer programming it's a little like let's say chess well it's a mind sport where you have problem solving which is put at the core of the computer programming thing is problem solving and for that you need algorithms and data structure knowledge it's it's done in usually internet sites because you need a lot of people who want to you know participate in that contest so company programming is a mind sport which requires you to know about algorithms and data structures it's focused on problem solving and people seem to love it bye and could you give like a maybe a really simplified example of what a problem might look like for example I could have something like mr. mr. X wants to go from A to B and there are some seven cities between a and B so he may or may not choose to visit all the cities but finally the shortest path between them now the algorithm that you might think about here is breadthfirst search or Dijkstra's or maybe you might go for a bruteforce at the end of it when you find the shortest path and you print that out that would be a solution the compared programming is about getting a solution and getting it in a short amount of time time so I guess you submit a solution in code and then whoever has the most efficient code wins is that the idea I'm sorry I missed the last bit sorry okay just asking whoever has the most efficient code wins right correct actually it's it's more about if you have the right solution and if it's fast enough so there will be some threshold set for time limits and correct nice and if both of them are there then you would score equal points but yes you're right there are some questions which have partial mocking so that's more interesting because if you have the fastest solution that is the best solution let's consider okay so I guess some problems are like as long as you solve the problem with a certain amount of efficiency you don't have to be the fastest one correct so when you look it has some sort of auto complexity so if a person has an algorithm which has let's say order n complexity or order n log n as long as it's not hitting something like n square the the comparator programing sight will allow your question to pass through it one time out okay otherwise it's gonna take too long yeah so what GK is CS was talking about just now is called something called Big O notation and it's just a way of expressing how you know how complex your algorithm is so what kind of experience do you have with competitive programming programming it actually started after I got placed in this company called Morgan Stanley and at that time I was completely free so I had nothing to do except solve problems or just enjoy myself so that's when I started off with computer programming it it took me a while to actually understand what the problems mean or how do I break it down to some math take a problem statement and then break it down to a mathematical statement and then just solve it through code right but yeah that's how I started okay so I guess you were you already working right when you get when I got started with competitive programming I had about three months before I joined my first company I was I was in college then but yeah you can say I was almost working because I wasn't studying at least okay would you say most people who work on competitive programming or students or not students most who work on computer programming in India are students who are looking for placements which the trend is right now very strong for students who are looking for placements to get into computer programming the reason for that is I think it makes your interviews a little easier the Iook interviews but yeah I think companies will be shifting from asking to me algorithm in to be as soon enough they focus more on projects and your internships so yeah computer programming is actually a sport but people use it for some good purposes yeah right yes I guess that that ways to my next question which is why should people care about competitive programming well in the current climate it's such that computer programming is helping people get get better at in problemsolving and from solving is a key part of interviews problem solving can also be a key part of your job assuming that you have something which is a little research oriented so if you know a lot about algorithms and data structures you can just look at a problem and you can say that fine I'm not so concerned about the computer science or the problemsolving about it I'm more concerned about how do I fix these modules and get the solution directly mmhmm so I've seen really smart people they they are really great at compare program what they can do is they can take a complex problem break into small parts and then just solve the problem immediately right so I understand that you're currently working as a software developer in Mumbai yeah I like the knowledge and the skills you gain through competitive programming there's the help in any way with your job so it's it's a doubleedged sword the first thing is yes it does it does help me solve problems and it's also something that gives you a lot of confidence when you are speaking with your team about a problem and you can just think about video annotations and immediately you know make sure that you're not making a big mistake if you're too deep into programming what have noticed is that students think too much I got McCleary rather than in the real world so now real what if you need to read a file you don't need all those algorithms you just need just a file reader yeah and for that you need reliability you need you need multithreading concepts which are more focus on computer science than in this very specific thing of algorithms right so computer programming is mostly about algorithms and data structures right okay and if people want to get into competitive programming how should they get started with it so there are sites like code chef top coder hacker wrote there are quite a few sites I can just mention them here and what they do is they ask you questions yeah could you maybe do a screen share and you know show everyone what those sites look like yeah so I think you mentioned it helped chef top coder how could the quite a few sites the new sites more and more interesting they keep getting better okay I'll just do the screen share now all right yeah yeah sure so this is what I was talking about top coder TopCoder is one of the sites you can also have look at food chef this is really popular in India and it's also doing free well internationally and this recommend that those websites instead of like other kinds of competitions I would say code forces is probably the best if you are looking for a website to start off with because it's highly reliable and it also has a lot of people the community is not so friendly so to speak so if you're looking for just starting off then you can do it yourself I mean at home you can you can read up a little algorithms in stock which has a very friendly community top coders community yeah that's also fine but code forces here might be the best site at this point I'm okay what's the difference between those websites so cold forces has has a community which is really old it's also very very strong the kind of editorials you see here are pretty useful some of the concepts are really advanced so what happens is because people have been programming here for a long time they they don't want simple stuff to be posted in their editorials that's the reason why I would say for a beginner this site is not very you know friendly code chef on the other hand is very focused on getting students to do well in programming so going to meet new people in their 10th grade or ninth grade and explaining to them what programming is and how it can be so much fun while top coder seems to be a site which almost every interviewer refers to at some point of time this will promise you are good but you may not find a very strong community here so it's up to us to choose which one I personally started off with Coach F okay and I something like ACM programming competitions do you know about them ECM is yeah yeah I dunno ECM ICPC is probably what people are talking about it's a contest which is held in colleges almost all the colleges in India get together and they have the best representatives go out there and fight for them so easy my CPC is is fun if you're if you if you can make a team then please do so and there's the World Finals and if you win that then you have lots of prizes right I guess those websites the advantage of that is you don't need a team to work on them absolutely you can start off right now and you can also practice and this this is also advantages why you would want to go that that's like the gym and this is he my CPC is literally the Olympics of computer programming my and how should people prepare for like solving those problems on those websites and SEM n I CPC so if you have a data structure and algorithm teacher in your college I would say that you know you can start off there just by asking them some some advice but if you are completely alone like most of us are usually you can you can just read blog posts on code forces good chef all these sites have something like tutorials on how to start up with computer programming okay and if you in fact you don't even need that you can just read up a little on algorithms and try to solve some problems interview questions are fine then once you're once you're slightly good you can get in computer running full force right so I think you mentioned like interview questions several times right so I guess you know in case people don't know about them a lot of like software companies ask these algorithms and data structures related questions I think these interview questions are sort of similar in nature as then completed programming questions absolutely and that's that's one of the interesting things these days computer programming is so computer programming is a bit more advanced in some ways but it can be much simpler in some ways so interview questions are somewhere on medium difficulty when it comes to programming contests and so interview questions also have this sort of you need some insights to actually solve the problem well compared to programming you need insight sometimes you need just a brute understanding of algorithms sometimes and they are highly related though I can see questions from interviews going into computer programming and the same thing okay nice and are there any like common mistakes people make when they get started with computer programming I think they take it too seriously they think it's really really big and they won't be able to solve it it happened to me too it happens to everyone just don't stop just keep going it's similar to how programming is done you know it's scary in the start and then once you have stuff working for you it seems very easy and there all these plateaus or all these barriers but you can break them by so when you say like people get serious about it I guess they got to stress about it yes they start thinking about oh my god my rank last time was thirty and this time it's 45 and I'm not improving and what I do don't think about it that way think about it that were you able to solve a new problem this time or were you able to learn something new this time right so what's going to end up happening is you're always learning something and that's I think that's one of the most beautiful things about computer programming is there's a contest so you're you have this inherent incentive to learn more and that's how people end up getting good at others yeah sounds good so I mean I love what you say about like not being stress and focusing on like learning because I feel like it's it's a pretty you know easy thing to do and and like an easy mistake to make like in other areas of life too absolutely so when I I joined my college I didn't know a thing about computer science I didn't know how a computer even works well even now I don't I mean all the way but what I'm talking about is I have never written a single line of code and it was scary in the start but if you have good teachers and if you have an attitude that I want to learn it really helps plus if you have a calm mind yeah like you said like this right so someone's asking about Python for competitive programming and yeah I was actually like I wanted to ask you like more in general like what programming languages should people use for computer programming well I would love to say that any programming language is fine but most of the sites are pretty old so what they they tend to focus on is speed so I wanted either a C++ program or has an advantage compared to a Python programmer in a programming side but interestingly that that gap is shrinking so you can start off with Python definitely and you can then move on to some other language which you feel is fast enough while being simple enough right so I guess if you if you write Korean citizen and you might have some advantage that way yes so what what the program platforms are trying to do are give different time limits for different source languages so if you have if you're writing code in C++ they'll give you just one second but if you're writing coding python they'll give you three seconds so that's the way they're trying to level the playing field but even now there is some advantage that C++ has because so tremendously fast right Python is a really good language to start off with in fact I'm finding it really interesting okay how about Java Java is what I use and it's it's quite fast so you get about 2 seconds if C++ gets one set in the end I mean I use Java in my job and I draw and compare programming so it's something that I really like right so if someone's like you know maybe that person knows like a few languages and they're like okay I want to get into competitive programming what would you like which language would you recommend that you know they get started with if they know a few languages C++ okay but I just want them beforehand that your C++ is going to be complicated so company might them all so yeah so I think someone was asking earlier how long it takes to prepare for these very programming sites you can start immediately most so the first question the easiest question on code chef is printing the number 42 instead of printing hello world this is the first program right right so it's it's actually easy so the answer to everything is 42 and that's what the questions based on the joke from somewhere right yeah that's I think that spaceship thing so yeah it's it's easy and then you can go on levelling up the moment you hit someplace where you feel like no I don't understand this at all you can always read some tutorials or editorials and get back from solving so it's a continuous process where you are climbing up a ladder okay so um I think we talked about it all that way earlier but would you say people get started with culture or a different side like people should get story with culture if you're yes if you're just talking off I would suggest good chef for chef is a very friendly community and it has some really good problems right it also gives you the luxury of taking your time to solve the problem because it has these long contests ten days long well code forces seems to be a little advanced because you have to solve from so fast and yeah they're short that's what contests okay so when you say fast they mean like one day three hours three hours that's pretty chance yeah so that must make a net stress for them absolutely it becomes a real problem when people are just reading the question quickly and trying to think of the algorithm by letting the questions so it's fine to see that but yeah if you want a little more relaxed environment and if you're looking for a really nice learning environment I would suggest go check yeah so when you were like working on more the competitive programming problems what did you enjoy about them I think my favorite point was when I actually solved it by and thought that you know green take that yes your answers correct hmm but the second most favorite thing would be to learn something new things that I didn't know about averages go read and then convert that to code and actually have a machine verifying my answers that was a beautiful thing and I thought that I was getting smarter every day that's that's actually my favorite thing okay and one would be sort of an example of you know why you learn that way so I didn't know about dynamic programming and I was always afraid about you know coding in dynamic programming for some reason I found it to be really complicated and impossible to do and there was this one question on code chef I remember I took about food is they solve it where I somehow recursively solve the question instead of using dynamic programming like I somehow got away from it but it was a really nice alternative solution to the problem and later on of course when I learn programming I thought that what the hell am i doing but this was this was something that really taught me that you can solve problems if you are really focused and if you if you want to nice okay so I think we're gonna start oh yes Q&A soon bye if you haven't yet guys you know make sure to follow Facebook on sisters or for for more live streams because that's you know really where I announced them and you can find you can CSS YouTube channel in the description below so you know make sure to check that out send in your questions guys so I don't see any good questions right now so could you tell us about like what you do with your YouTube channel so my youtube channel is focused on algorithms and data structures that helps you solve problems and I try to get out one video every week on some new concept but when there's a contest I I get a little more active so I try to post many solutions to the problems that that contest has just had okay and yeah do you see any good questions I think Howard Sharma has asked a good question he says that can CP be done in part time and the answer is yes you can I mean I still do it while working so it takes about I mean it's up to you it's entirely up to you okay I gotta give a shout out to this person because this person sent something in Japanese he's just you know he's saying conscious which means like what's out yeah thanks for that okay so YK what do you think is the best website for learning a programming language so I always give the same you know same advice I would get started with something like code Carmi or free code camp okay let me type it in so people can see free code camp and code Academy and that's for basics so after that I would say like something like a window comm or clear sight or udemy like one of those video sites you have any thoughts on yeah I think those are really nice this this capacity also is stylish yeah but I'm not sure breathe yeah thank you that's it pretty good tear and otherwise this again pinky speaks but it doesn't really eat you about programming as such by teach you about about problem solving so yeah that's that's not programming yeah gigs for gigs is good too like when you go for something like a lot of times kick for gigs shows up someone's asking for a new programmer Ruby on Rails is good I would say Ruby is good but Ruby on Rails is like it's it's not the most friendly thing to learn I had this experience where I started running Ruby on Rails and it does a lot of things automatically absolutely oh yeah so I'm yeah please go ahead um so the times the name usually we have writing build processes we are thinking about compiling the code and then deploying it so that's when we use Ruby on Rails but yeah you're right what programming no yeah I think so prodigy prodigy ACM training style I guess what he or she means it's like how should you prepare for it well yes if you are preparing for ECM it's probably in your second or your third you so what you can do before that is make sure that the coursework in algorithms and data structures is completed in a really good way so if you do that in a strong way that will give you a strong basis to learn more specialized algorithms so that'll be fun and then you can you know perform much much better also one final thing about a semi CPC is that it's a contest for colleges so some colleges are really good in terms of the math culture that they have and some don't really have any culture of ECM so if you want some advice you can ask seniors in the other colleges also they'll help you okay how would you find like the seniors in other colleges there's the science here which is called chef code forces they are always roaming around and you know commenting on editorials if their code if they're if they need improvements and then you can you can just message them directly and those guys tend to be the seniors either from India sometimes they're also from outside India and are really nice so someone's asking me about creating an Android app but this person doesn't know how to code I mean I would get started with Java because you know you can build Android apps with Java so that's you know that's pretty much it like go to code Academy lynda.com and learn Java Java yes my favorite language right worried why is Java your favorite language I started off with it and some of the things like garbage collection and multithreading where where concepts that I really really liked and then it kind of stuck I'm not sure of the better languages per se but yeah Java is something that I'm really comfortable with my thing is basic exhibit okay so what do you like about garbage question in Java and what is garbage collection so you know just in case people don't know yeah sure so garbage collection is wendy create an object we want that object to be removed from memory maybe no no we no longer need it and java does that for you automatically by c++ you actually need to go to that memory location and free that up so that's a little complicated so occurring to me the lesser you put in you put in the on the programmer the fast a can code the fast it can go to the fast results you get so mmhmm that's reason why I like Java and how come you like Java more than Python yeah the honest answer to that will be that I'm accustomed to Java but Python seems like a scripting language so you can't really design very big systems with Python right when you are going for software engineering it becomes a real pain to actually have Python code running that slow and there's also the concept of multithreading which is which is not so good in Python okay so Java is better handling multithreading what is reading so multithreading is for for all the viewers multithreading is you having 10 or 15 computers and you can run one function one process on all of them together so that it's done faster mmhmm so it's at the idea is you have a you have a problem to solve and you can divide it into multiple computers right good good okay okay I think that's time do you have anything to say to everyone oh yeah best of luck and I find this channel like it very interesting the tutorials you made on Python and yeah people can learn a lot about programming so my main message would be you can learn programming easily so don't take it too seriously and have fun okay awesome so thanks everyone for coming here we have like 326 viewers now so we did it guys next time we can do more if I do more live streams like I'm not sure if I'm gonna do it you know any more live streams but thanks everyone for your you know messages and everything so yeah I'll see you guys soon bye everyone
