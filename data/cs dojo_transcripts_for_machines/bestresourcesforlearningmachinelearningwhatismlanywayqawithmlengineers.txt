okay so the other day I hosted a meetup right here in Toronto and in this meetup we had a Q&A session with machine learning engineers from this company called DISA it's a company that implements machine learning solutions for other companies including a bank and I thought this Q&A session was really informative but it was pretty long it was about 40 minutes long in total and the audio we got from the event wasn't the best I would say so I decided to give you a summarized version of the Q&A session in this video but just in case you want to watch the entire raw footage of this Q&A I'm gonna put a link to that in the description and if you want to sign up for future meetups in Toronto and maybe elsewhere I'm gonna put a link to sign up for that in the description below okay so this Q&A session was with machine learning engineers Joe mark Helen Pippin Danny and Sachin and the first question I asked was what is machine learning exactly this is actually something I already talked about on this channel in my video about what can you do with Python but let me summarize their explanation here so machine learning is used when you can't explicitly write on the algorithm to solve a given problem an example of a problem like this is when you want to make a computer categorize images so let's say that you want your computer to understand that this picture contains a dog and this other picture contains a car you can solve this problem with machine learning by giving a machine learning algorithm a bunch of labeled examples and then a your machine learning algorithm which might be for example a neural network will learn to label new images into either dogs or course so that's basically what machine learning does it's a way for a computer to learn patterns from a bunch of examples anyway after that I asked them if they could share some interesting applications of machine learning one application Helen right there talked about is how some people have been trying to use machine learning to generate things like art poetry and music so I asked them how you would actually go about doing that and then Joe right there explained that for the example of poetry you can just take a bunch of poems you like and what's called a language model on those poems and then that language model will basically learn these statistical regularities in those poems and it will learn to generate similar new poems similar to the given ones so I asked them after that Pippin right there talked about how he applied machine learning to astronomy because that's what he's really interested in so he was basically trying to help astronomers find more supernovae in the space and right now it's mostly a manual process you know astronomers need to look at a lot of images to find supernovae and he saw that this is basically just a classification problem so in this problem you just need to classify each image into either containing a supernova or not containing a supernova and he told us that he was able to apply this relatively new technology called convolutional neural networks to solve this problem and this approach was actually better than the state of art method astronomers used to have them now another example mark right there shared with us was how they helped a bank with their credit card customers they basically built a model that would predict whose payments would be delayed based on the past customer information and they also built a model to predict if each customer would respond to a phone call to remind them to pay yeah that was an early client success for us mark said that model and Bank in particular was our flagship project and so that was very successful some of you okay and after that I asked them what are the best resources for learning machine learning and they recommended a few one is FASTA AI it's supposed to be a more of a handson practical course in particular I I recommend it to this audience because it targets people who are already coders and it's very well done it was developed by a guy named Jeremy Howard and also Rachel Thomas are both very interesting and very good teachers so please and then mark here recommended the machine learning course on Coursera by joining from staff board it's also a really popular course and apparently it's more theoretical and more mathematical than FAFSA AI another bookmark recommended is this online freely available book called neural networks and deep learning by physicists michael nielsen yeah I just really find his writing especially clear ok so those are some of the machine learning learning resources they recommend it but such an you right here took a slightly different approach for him he got started by learning statistics because machine learning is partially based on statistics and he didn't recommend any particular resources for that before stats I would personally recommend getting started with Khan Academy and Coursera and just go from there you know I would say the same thing for linear algebra too anyway after that Joe added this this is kind of two paths that people art argue for there's like a topdown approach to learning in the bottomup approach to learning the topdown approach is start with practical things first start with how to do it and then get into the nittygritty of like what is the underlying mathematics and the bottomup approaches start with them underlying mathematics and then work your way to the practical stuff if I had to guess I would say the topdown approach will work better on average for this audience but you have to try for yourself and see see what works and topdown approach being like fast thought is faster i bottomup approach being like learning statistics and reading the deep learning book but you can good fellow or something like that ok so one thing they all recommended is working on a machine learning project so you can learn from the experience so I asked them how should people find a good much project to work on so that's Helens advice and I asked them how should people go about finding good datasets for that and they recommended a few resources for that like google's AI datasets and after the event they also sent me an article that lists good datasets for machine learning so i'm gonna put a link to that in the description below too but after that mark also said this for many projects you'll find there isn't a nicely curated data set if there's like something you want to do or build and you'll have to come up with creative ways of building yourself whether it's scraping scraping the web and then actually a few of them also recommended this website called cargo which is a machine learning competition websites personally I found that coming to be helpful for me to get started an initiative that also offered it's been a few hackathons data science related hackathons around Toronto place in the US and these places are good for talking to other people find in the field talking to leaders who are the field employees in the field other machine learning engineers and good scientist in the field and I say eventually okay goal is excellent but it only goes so far I think on a huge skill that machine learning years if you wanted to go into machine learning in industry you have this working with real life thing Cagle is not quite really right if you're interested and actually working I feel like a lot of nonprofits actually because they don't have inhouse do science teams and so a good way to go about getting your hands on real data actually and it's just the other big French slow motion engineers anyway after those questions I let the audience ask questions one of the questions we got was why these are choose machine learning out of everything and here was Danny's answer and so I thought myself you know what something does I'm good at and that could be good at and then use my skill as well and that's something that I enjoyed and previewed like machine learning because and data science and when I got into it I found that it was using a lot of what I really really knew from physics you know it's about explaining the world in novel ways it's playing physical phenomena through mathematical algorithms and the power of your power machine learning that blew away predict traditional predictive classical analytics really drew me and so that's what I really found fascinating about and there's a lot of promise in the future also them loved another question we got was what language should you get started with if you're new to coding people recommend a Python he said that it's because there's a really strong opensource community with Python and that you know there are a lot of open source machine learning tools written in Python and recently there's also this really strong culture of sharing what you've been working on with machine learning and he said that that's really helpful and the last question we got was what do you look for when you hire machine learning engineers one thing they mentioned is real world experience they look for someone who's actually put a machine learning model in production ideally and Mark said that they look for someone with realworld experience as opposed to just personal projects because there are a lot of challenges that come up when you try to apply machine learning to a real problem in the industry and then Joe also added this but personal projects still have a lot of value I think I think people actually underestimate the value of it it's worth way more than a certificate from a Coursera course or anything like that worth more even than the courses I would say if you do a hard project something that really pushes you and you write good clean code that you would be happy to share and you put it on github and you write a nice summary of that that will make you stand out more than the average engine alright so that wraps up this Q&A session again in the description you can find a link to the entire raw footage as well as a signup link for future meetups in Toronto and possibly in other cities I'm thinking maybe la San Francisco Vancouver maybe New York maybe I'm just dreaming here but we'll see by the way this is not a paid promotion but if you're looking for a job in machine learning I would totally recommend checking out this as career page because it seems like a pretty cool place to work out anyway thank you guys always for watching my videos and I'll see you guys in the next one I've never even taken a single cs4 SAS course University you don't need a soldier
