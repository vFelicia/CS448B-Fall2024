hi everyone today I decided to take a break from my regular coding videos to make more of a blog type video instead and you know I want to really show you the process of how I go about solving problems usually and then I'm also going to this event later today where people will be pitching their startup ideas and I'll be pitching my startup idea to so hopefully I'll be able to talk about it later today anyway let's get started okay so first of all let me just quickly talk about what I've done so far this week to give you some context on what I'm working on basically I'm trying to set up Twitter integration for the web app I'm working on called edit dojo and I was working on the sign up with Twitter button yesterday and for that I found this tutorial it turns out to be pretty good so I basically you know followed everything and pretty much copy and paste it everything and then here's the result I have you have the sign up sign e button when you click it you go to Twitter and then you go back to my website and then it says welcome username and once a user signs up to my website using Twitter I want to be able to start interacting with that users Twitter account from my Twitter account edit dojo and I think the first step for doing that would be to make this account edit dojo follow them so that's what I'm gonna work on today and by the way whenever I start coding what I like doing is I like going into the accessibility settings and I just invert colors and then recently I started using greyscale on top of that too and the reason I do it is because this way my browser has a dark background and everything else like my terminal and my editor has a dark background too so throughout this video you might see a weird call our skiing from time to time but that's basically just the way I like it anyway I'm looking at the admin panel right now of my website and you know I'm looking at the user record and I see three users one of them YK dojo this is the one I created with my personal Twitter accounts and actually my personal Twitter account has the same handle so it looks like my twitter handle is automatically recorded as my username when I sign in so I guess what I'm gonna do here is I'm just gonna say whenever someone signs up for the first time I log into the edit dojo Twitter account you know just like I did in my Twitter bot tutorial and then I'll follow that user's account using the username obviously this is not gonna be the perfect solution because you know what if this user changes their user handle I mean their Twitter handle after signing up but I think this solution is good enough for now so I'll see if I can implement that okay so I did a little bit of thinking and right now what I'm trying to understand is what happens exactly when I click this sign up sign in button because all I did is you know I copy and paste it code from a tutorial and it looks like this is just applying link so let me show you some of the code the relevant part is just this one a provider login URL Twitter and if you look at the HTML snippet right here it's just a link and when you copy if you copy you know this link address and then put it in a new tab it just redirects to Twitter and then back to my website so I think I'm gonna look into you know exactly what happens when you go to this URL and then I'll say whatever happens there you know I'll add the part about following this user maybe before redirecting back to my website okay so I started reading the documentation of the library I'm using for this but I'm actually starting to think maybe I was thinking about it in the wrong way you know whatever happens when the user clicks signs in doesn't matter Octus it goes back to the URL that I specified in Twitter so maybe I can just create a special URL like slash you know say sign in and half Twitter you know redirect the browser back to this URL and then maybe I can make a view for this like a jungle view that handles the following and everything so let me look into that approach instead okay so I wanted to do some more coding today to solve that problem but unfortunately I actually need to get ready for the startup pitch contest thing I told you about earlier so I think I'm gonna do that now and I'll do more coding either later tonight or maybe tomorrow okay so before I go to this event let me tell you guys just a little bit about it apparently it's an event for Canadian newcomers to pitch their startup ideas and you know I'm a Canadian newcomer I'm a recent permanent resident in Canada and I have a startup idea so I was like you know why not give it a try and I wrote this little application explaining what my idea is and apparently I was selected as one of the 10 people to pitch their ideas today you know I just got that email earlier so yeah I was pretty excited okay the event is happening in 12 minutes and I have 15 minutes to get there I mean it's a 15minute walk from here I think I'm gonna be fine also it's knowing it's pretty nice okay I just got here I think I'm a few minutes late but it's probably okay we'll see so I just noticed how Canadian this place is I mean there's the stage right there and there's hockey right here I mean how how much more Canadian could it get okay so the event started with a panel of entrepreneurs talking about how to start successful businesses in Canada and it turned out I was gonna be the first one to pitch so let me show you just a small part of my okay so the rest of the pitch was basically the same stuff as what I already explained on this channel basically you read stuff in Japanese if you're learning Japanese and Japanese native speakers are gonna fix it for you and then you're gonna have to fix other people's posts in English assuming that you're fluent in English anyway after my pitch nine other people pitched for example this guy was pitching a company that produces 360 degree videos and after all that the judges went away to decide which five of us are going to win okay and it turned out the first winner was the 360 view guy and then he was the second winner and the third winner turned out to be this guy so at this point I'm thinking oh my god I'm actually not gonna win what am I gonna say to myself Carver's then this happened alright I'm done for the day I'm super tired but I'm happy that I won apparently there's gonna be like a free week of boot camp programs startup bootcamp programs but I don't know what's gonna happen exactly I'll probably talk more about it later on this channel okay so that was pretty fun but actually after that the last few days have been kind of slow partly because I needed to do some work for our first meetup in Toronto and this code server I recently set up for this channel but I'm back at coding today okay so I'm on Twitter's developer website now and I was looking at this section callback URL and it looks like it goes to this URL what I'm guessing what happens is when someone signs in with Twitter Twitter sends us back to that URL and then the library that I'm using for this purpose just handles that request so I guess I'll need to either you know do something with the library or maybe when the library sends us to this route URL maybe we can do something special with Django instead let me think about that for a second okay so I think that's what I'm gonna do you know whatever happens with the Twitter longing workflow what happens is eventually you know we go back to this root path and then it goes to the login view and in the login view we're just rendering this template logging that HTML so I guess what we can do is before we render that we'll say follow the user if the user is signed in and you know we haven't followed them yet and yeah that's pretty much all we need to do I think okay so I just searched for Django get user in a view because we need to be able to get the users info in our view and then I found Stack Overflow page and I found code snippets it looks like this is a view that takes a request and then to get the user it looks like all we need to do say is request that user and then to get the username we can do request that user that username so let me see if that works so I just got an error here let me just read the error here it says full object is not callable and then it looks like it's a line eight of you stop I end users so let me take a look at that okay so it's right there this is one of the lines I copied from Stack Overflow and I think what's happening is this is just a boolean or bull but we're trying to call it as if it's a function so if we just delete these parentheses hopefully it's gonna work let's see if that's the case all right so it's working what I did is I got you know our username with the code we saw earlier request that user that username and then I just put it in this variable called username and then I'm returning a response that says here's the name and then my username it looks like it's working so I've tested the part about retrieving the username now we just need to follow this account okay and I think the way I'm gonna do that part is I'm gonna you know show you the strategy I'm gonna use to go about it and then when I'm done with the code I'm gonna show you later so basically the idea is gonna be you know once the user is authenticated and once we retrieve the username we'll say log in to our special Twitter accounts at edit dojo and then follow this user at username from that account and I think at the end what we want to do is we want to be able to store some information about if we follow them already or not because if we follow them already you know we don't have to follow them again but maybe we'll implement that later we might not need to do that right now so I will say later store some info about if we already follow them corner and actually logging in to edit dojo and following someone that should be easy because I already made a tutorial on that so I'm just gonna use my opensource code right here for my Twitter bots here what I did is I log it into edit dojo and then I tweet it at someone so I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna test you know this part of the code by tweeting at username and then later I'm gonna change that part of the code and you know just a little bit to follow them instead ok so let's get to coding okay so it looks like sending a tweet works here I just said at you know my personal account testing this tweet one so that part is this line of the code API that updated status I'm just gonna look for you know the equivalent function for following instead so it looks like it's this function API dot create friendship let me see if that works so I'm gonna replace update status here with create friendship and then maybe it's just gonna be username here let's try that I'm gonna refresh our home page here it looks like I got nowhere so let's go to Twitter and then refresh Twitter Oh actually I was already following myself so let me unfollow myself make sure I'm not following my personal account anymore and let me do the same thing again no errors and when I go to Firefox yeah I see it it looks like this script is working now so there are a few things I still need to clean up here I still need to take care of the case when the user is not logged in I think what I'm gonna do is return early if the user is not logged in you know like right here and then if the user is logged in then you know grab the username and do this thing you know right now all it does is just follow someone it doesn't do that much but you know hopefully I'll have more functions later so actually you know I think this is pretty much it for this video I'll put all this code and more at siesta io / edit as usual and actually you know vlogging and coding at the same time was kind of hard probably just partly because I'm not that used to it so hopefully I'll focus more on coding this weekend and maybe a little bit early next week and that for the next video I'll think of something else or you know I'll do another vlog I will think about that anyway thank you as always for watching my videos and oh by the way if you haven't our discord server you should join us and I'll see you guys in the next video
