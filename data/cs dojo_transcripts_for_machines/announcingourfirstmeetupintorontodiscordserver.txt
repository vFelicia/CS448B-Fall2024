hi everyone in this video I just wanted to make two quick announcements the first one is that I'm gonna be hosting my first meetup for this channel next week it's gonna be on December 6th evening and it's gonna be at this company called DISA in downtown Toronto you can find more details about it and sign up at CH dojo io / meet one if you don't live in the city or if you can't make it this time don't worry because you know you can still sign up for future meetups in your city at CH dojo da yo / Meetup okay the second thing I wanted to tell you guys about today is the discord server I recently set up for this channel and just in case you're not familiar with discord it's sort of like slack and you have basically a list of topics that you can chat about for example Python JavaScript and a lot of other topics here and I think it's a cool way to chat about any programming related topics and you know sort of ask each other questions I also find it interesting how it seems pretty easy to make BOTS for discord for example one of our members made this bot called red where you can do stuff like rez Jeff dog to get a dog Jeff liked that and apparently he made the spot with Python anyway feel free to join us to chat about programming or maybe just to try creating your own bot okay and there's actually another thing I wanted to tell you guys about today so the company that's hosting our meetup next week Desa told me that they are actually hiring Python engineers you know I'm not getting paid to say this but honestly it seems like a pretty cool company to work for so if you want to get a job with Python and if you want to you know potentially work in Toronto which is a nice city I would say you should definitely check out their career page anyway thank you as always for watching my videos and I'll see you guys in the next one
