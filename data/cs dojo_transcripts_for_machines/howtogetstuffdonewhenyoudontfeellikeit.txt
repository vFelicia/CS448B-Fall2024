so as a selfemployed person I often find it difficult to motivate myself enough to do things that I'm supposed to do and over the past two years or so since I quit my fulltime job I think I actually struggled a lot with that but over that time I tried a bunch of different things to try to make myself more productive and I found several things that worked for me so I want to share them with you today so here are my seven steps for getting things done even when you don't feel like it okay so if you don't feel motivated to do something the first thing you should try is you should try changing your environment so if you don't feel like doing some work at home maybe try going into a cafe a library or maybe your school and for me personally I found that you know whenever I feel not so motivated at home as soon as I go to my favorite cafe my motivation picks up and it just becomes so much easier to get stuff done there so I would say try to find a place that works the best for you we're about that might be and once you're in the right environment you know in the right place the next thing you should do if you haven't done this yet is you should write down all the tasks that you need to do or you want to do that day and whenever you do this I don't think the media matters too much so it doesn't matter too much if you use something like Evernote or another todo app or just a piece of paper oh that personally I like using Google keep just because I think it's pretty simple to set up and pretty easy to use and whatever the medium I find that just writing down your tasks helps because you know it helps you focus more by basically having to keep fewer things in your head after that if you still don't feel motivated to do something I would just start with a really small task this could be something really simple like replying to your emails or something more fun maybe like planning your next vacation whatever it might be I find that just by completing this small task you're gonna be in the right mindset to start getting you know bigger tasks done you know of course just be careful not to spend too much time on these small insignificant and after that let's say that you have a bigger more important task that you want to work on I could be anything but let's say it's just an example that you want to work on writing a blog article then if you still don't feel motivated to do that I would ask yourself why did you want to do that in the first place and then I would sort of dig into your motivation by asking yourself why a bunch of times so in this particular case you might say well I wanted to write a blog article so that I can make you know some side income in the future through my blog you might say I want to be able to make some side income so that I can travel more in the future and you might say traveling is important for me because I want to be able to experience more things in the future so that's your base motivation right there in this particular case and of course you know it might be something different for you but whatever it is if it's something that's strong enough and important enough I believe that you should be able to just get started on your task and you know get your motivation up again anyway after that if you do decide that this particular task is important enough for you then the easiest way to get started with it is by breaking it down to a really small first step so in this particular case instead of thinking about writing the whole blog article think about you know maybe writing the first paragraph or writing the outline instead if that seems like too much work for you just think about writing down a few key words that are going to be important in this particular article so whatever your task is you should be able to break it down to a small enough first step so that it's really easy to get started with okay and after breaking your task down to a really small first step if it's still too hard to get started with it here's what I would do I would tell yourself that you're gonna only work on this task for five minutes and actually you know use your phone's timer or something to time yourself for five minutes if five minutes seems too long just to two minutes if that seems too long just to one minute or you know thirty seconds I think no matter how boring or you know paying for your task is you should be able to just work on it for one minute and when that one minute is done just ask yourself can you do two minutes now and then four minutes ten minutes and 20 minutes and soon and that way you'll be able to actually increase the amount of time you focus on the task sort of gradually by the way I recommend using this app called forest for this because I think it's a lot more fun way of timing yourself than just using a simple timer all right the final thing I recommend for motivating yourself when you don't feel like it so much is using some kind of reward this could be something really simple like eating a piece of snack that you wanted to eat earlier or watching your favorite show that just came out whatever it is just tell yourself that you can only do the thing after completing your task okay so these are my seven steps for getting stuff done but actually there is one more thing I wanted to talk about and that's music so personally I don't usually listen to music whenever I work on something because I can focus more that way but I found that good music is really helpful whenever I work on something that's really boring for me it's usually like legal stuff or maybe tax related stuff and you know by listening to music it just becomes a little bit less boring anyway that's all I wanted to talk about in this video there's any type of videos I should make in the future or any topics I should cover in the future let me know in the comments section and thank you as always for watching my videos I will see you guys in the next one
