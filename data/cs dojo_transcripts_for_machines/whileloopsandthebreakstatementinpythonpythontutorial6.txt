so in the last video we saw how to use for loops but for loops are not the only way to use loops in Python the other common way of using them is called while loops so let's see what it looks like first of all let's recap one of the things we did in the last video we had total being equal to 0 and then we had for I in range 1 comma 5 4 spaces total plus equals I and then print total what this block did was he added up all the numbers through all the integers through 1 through 5 not including 5 to total and then we printed that number and that number is 10 because 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 is 10 so can we do the same thing with a while loop the answer is yes let's see what that looks like let's first initialize a new variable called total 2 to be 0 and then we're gonna write wow J is less than 5 do the following and actually the while loop doesn't initialize the index for us day for us so we'll need to initialize it explicitly ourselves so we're gonna write J equals 1 before we go into the while loop and then while J is less than 5 do the following which is 4 spaces of course total 2 plus equals J and J to the total 2 variable and then J plus equals 1 so add 1 to J and then after the while loop we're going to print total 2 so what this block says is when we get to the while loop check if J is less than 5 and since it's true I mean 1 is of course less than 5 do the following total 2 plus equals J ad J to total and they add 1 to J so J will become 2 and at that point we'll go back to the beginning of the loop again and we're gonna check if J is less than 5 still and of course 2 is less than 5 so we'll go through that again and once J is for we'll say add 1 today and day will become 5 and when we go back here we'll stop the loop right here and it will break out of it because J is no longer less than 5 and then we'll print total 2 so this block pretty much does exactly the same thing as what the previous block does so let's see if it works and it does we print it 10 which is the sum of 1 2 3 & 4 so why would we want to use while loops instead of 4 loops well it depends on the situation but one situation where it's useful is when you don't know how many loops you need beforehand so I'm gonna give you an example of that let's say you're given this lists given on the score list which is 5 4 4 3 1 minus 2 minus 3 and minus 5 and let's say you don't necessarily know the contents of this list beforehand but you know that this list is sorted in a descending order so that means the largest number comes first in this list and when you go right you know that the numbers always go down or stay the same so 4 is less than 5 and 4 is less than or equal to 4 and so on and let's say you want to find the sum of only the positive numbers in this list how can we do that well what we want to do is we want to run some kind of loops so that we can iterate over elements but only the positive months so that way we don't know how many loops we need to find the sum of only the positive numbers in a situation like this for loops can be really useful so let's see what that looks like by first defining total 3 to 0 and then the index I to 0 as well and then we're gonna write a while loop here with while given underscore list square brackets I is greater than 0 total 3 plus equals given lists square brackets I and then I plus equals 1 so what we are saying here is first check the current element in given lists so since I will start at zero the first current element of given lists will be the first element which is five while this element is greater than zero do the following first add the current element giving list square brackets I to total I mean total of three and then increment I by one so that means just go to the next item if we're examining this current item here I would be zero so we are saying let's go to the next item which is index one so when I is equal to one given less square brackets one would be the second item right here for and that's greater than zero so we're gonna add that to total three and then we're going to go to the next item and we're gonna keep doing that until we are right here whose index is zero one two three four five and at that point given list square brackets five would be negative two which is not greater than zero so we'll break out of the while loop after that we can print total three and see if we get the correct answer and the correct answer is the sum of all of these numbers five plus four plus four plus three plus one which is nine thirteen sixteen seventeen so let's see if we can get that we did so this little method works but only if the given list contains at least one non positive number so what would happen if this given list only had positive numbers for example 5 4 4 3 & 1 let's see what happens by running the cell oops it actually gave us an error called index error and it says index or list index out of range and it actually makes sense because when I is equal to 0 1 2 3 4 we go through this list because given less square brackets 4 which is 1 is greater than 0 and then we go to this point I plus equals 1 and I will be 5 and they will check here is given list scrub scrub a gets five great er than zero but when we ask Python what's at index five of given lists it's gonna give us an error because nothing exists at index five so we'll need to fix it by adding an additional condition to the while loop by saying while I is less than five and given less square brackets is greater than zero and actually instead of saying five explicitly we could also say Len of given lists which means the length of given list and note here that length is another predefined function in Python and then once we run this cell this should work now oops I didn't spell it correctly given lists so I'm gonna write given list again and then let's run this cell and it works now okay now let's create a new list given list two which has both positive numbers and negative numbers and you might ask given this list can we add up all the positive numbers using a full loop instead of a while loop the answer is yes we can let's see how that works so we're going to define total four to be zero and then we're gonna write for element and given lists to colon total four plus equals element and then print element so currently of course what this block does is this is going to add up all the elements in given lists to to total four so that will include both positive numbers and negative numbers what if we wanted to break out of the loop as soon as we see a negative number we can do that with the break statement so we're gonna write here if the current element is less than or equal to zero column then break out of this Loup so how this works is this is gonna add up the elements up to right here one and one is not less than or equal to zero so we're not gonna break and we're gonna add it one to total four and after that element will become minus two and at that point element is of course less than or equal to zero so we'll break out of the for loop so that way we won't check any elements after that and we're not gonna add any of the negative numbers to total 4 so with this method element should we should print total 4 instead and once we print total 4 we should see 17 which is the sum of all the positive numbers of course and we see exactly that and actually this break statement works in while loops exactly the same way so let's see how that works by solving the same problem with the same list given list we're gonna first define total 5 to 0 and then we're going to write a while loop saying well something and this something will be a statement that's always true so it could be something like while 1 is less than 2 it's kind of silly but this statement is always true right because 1 is always less than 2 and then once we meet a certain condition we'll break out of the while loop with the break statement and actually instead of writing this silly statement 1 less than 2 you can just write true because true is always true and note that true here has the T capitalized so we're gonna write while true and then before this while loop we're going to define I to be 0 this is going to be the index that we're going to use and in this while loop we're gonna write total 5 plus equals given list square brackets I so that says add the current element and this should be given list to add the current element in given list to to total 5 and then increment I by i + equals 1 and if the next item if given less square brackets i is less than or equal to 0 then break out of this loop and here I'm just assuming that this given list has at least one non positive number so what's gonna happen with this block is I will be 0 1 2 3 4 and as soon as is 4 we're gonna add given less square brackets 4 which is 1 2 total 5 and then I will be 5 after this line and because given less square brackets 5 is minus 2 that's of course less than or equal to 0 we're gonna break out of this while loop and after that we're gonna print total 5 and that should give us 17 if we didn't make any mistake actually I made a mistake here giving list this should be given list 2 because we're just looking at giving lists 2 and this should fix everything and it did we get 17 and here's a little problem to practice what you learn in this video let's say you're given this lists given list 3 and you don't necessarily know the contents of this list beforehand but you know that the elements in this list are sorted in the descending order so of course that means when you go write the numbers always go down or stay the same can you find the sum of all the negative numbers instead of all the positive numbers I would use a while loop here but there is a way to do it with a for loop as well okay and as usual if you want to download the file I created through this video just go to CH dojo dot io / Python 6 and make sure to follow CH dojo on Facebook if you haven't yet because this is where I announce my live streams and stuff ok I will see you guys in the next video
