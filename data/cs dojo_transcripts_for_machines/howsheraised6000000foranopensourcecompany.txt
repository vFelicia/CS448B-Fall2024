so the other day I came across this news about an open source company called charm raising $6 million that surprised me for a few reasons as we'll get into them in a minute but luckily I had a chance to interview someone who was a key part of the whole process uh her name is JayZ to sort of demystify the whole process when I went through the recording of it I found that there's a lot of value information you know and practical tips that a lot of you should be able to learn from you know whether or not you're an Entre rur so that's why I decided to share the recording with you today I hope you will enjoy so jzz do you mind introducing yourself for everyone sure hello everyone I am JayZ I am the COO at charm and very excited to be here today cool right so let's step back a bit and let me ask you sure what is charm charm is an open Source company we make tools that are modernizing the command line and making the command line a platform it's the easiest way that I can say it for those are interested in checking out we're all over GitHub uh some most popular libraries include bubble te which is an Elm architecture inspired tuy framework to gum which is an easy way to customize shell scripts your your bash scripts and V just which allows you to demo your Tooling in the command line cool my understanding is that you raised $6 million recently for a seed around for charm yes and that seems unusually large for a seat round how did you do that H so which part if we were to D more in details is it the number part you want to know about the journey the process what is most intriguing uh just a quick summary of the whole journey you know from I think where the journey where a charm started where you joined and then how you got here would be great okay all right the full story well let's see charm started at the end of 2019 by my wonderful cofounders Toby and Christian now at the time the three of us were at a long table that is not unlike this one in New York City side by side filling out paperwork I myself have a background of Serial entrepreneur and that's where I met Toby and Christian we were all at a series a company I was heading finance and operations Toby was the senior engineer and Christian was the creative director now after that company went through series a I was invited by the partners to be a VC so I ended up leading a bunch of deals and Toby and Christian and were at that table filling out incorporation docks for charm and where I come into play is I was there that day filling out the paperwork with him including you know kind of what compliance boxes to check I've done this for better for worse you know a lot of times and uh and I remember walking away that day just thinking wow anyone would be so lucky to work with such talented individuals I ended up having taking part in investing in the company in their earliest rounds at on my VC firm and fast forward year and a half later which was almost now 2 years ago uh Toby had reached out and said hey uh we just crossed an open Source Milestone I think at the time they just crossed 12,000 GitHub Stars which as you know YK is and those listening might know is is kind of a marquee Milestone and they said we've raised some funding the team right now is super technical we would love for you to join in and run the business and so I kind of thought about the pros and cons and you know I always I started my first company when I was 17 I'd always kind of had that entrepreneur bug I'd saw the other side of VCS how to lead deals what the fundraising Market looks like sitting on the other side looks like being a board member looks like how to negotiate terms and I took that leap of faith and I was like you know what if we're going to do this I want to do this with the right team build some interesting and certainly it's my first Dev tooling company you know I've always been in the consumer software business whether it's my own or those I've helped run and that was when I joined we had just crossed I think we shortly had celebrated 25k three months after I joined and very recently as YK you know we just crossed 90,000 GitHub Stars across our libraries which is something just to be very very grateful for for the community support um so fast forward that's kind of a little bit of background story fast forward um they had raised a seed round I joined a smaller seed round about 3 million and this past year and a half I will be completely transparent to those listing for those who are not in kind of the Silicon Valley or the startup Tech scene it's been a tough funding market and I think that kind of alludes to why K's question about like wow 6 milon is a lot yeah it's a lot you know it's a lot for where we are right now because of how tough the fundraising Market is um you know public equities have tanked and that kind of you know IPO markets haven't opened some people might have heard of but in the private Market especially early stage unfortunately startups are falling left and right and we were were startup funding company we at the beginning of the year end of last year we started to talk to to BCS and quite frankly you know W you you and I have talked about this there were a lot of NOS I want to be completely transparent it wasn't you know everyone sees a tech crunch article and you're like wow big figure big name and spoiler we uh it was Google's early stage AI fund that funded us called gradient Ventures and so people see the head headliner and they see the title and they're like oh my gosh like so easy for them like how they could they do it and we got a lot of Nos and so my my first tip for those who are trying to look for Venture funding um for those who want to be entrepreneurs and go through this route which is a chosen path it's not easy very Market conditional is you have to find the right investor and sometimes for some people that's two going through two investors and maybe the second one you you found the right one it's I mean it's cliche but it's like dating right sometimes you get 49 NOS sometimes you get 120 NOS right but also who cares how many NOS until you get to the yes and hopefully you get to the yes before you run out of money because that is a taking time um so the next question is how did it come to be so I wrote a little thread when we announced it but um essentially we had gone to Market Toby especially one of of our cofounders he led the charge in a lot of these conversations and with both existing investors as well as new investors and the time the market wasn't looking so friendly and uh I in the summertime I want to say um last summer I brought on when I joined the company uh a host of open source entrepreneurs so a network of my personal friends and and open source enthusiasts I thought that was really important to add to our Network including some that were announced so including you know super basis CEO their their head of devell to EXA that planet scale to um various kind of Dev full heavy we had uh truffle security to Fleet Smith Founders all very entrepreneurs who get it and I wanted their advice honeycomb CEO Dev tooling space and uh we ended up having one of those angels Walter lead me a warm introduction to the general partner at gradient and that's what happens when we talked him and I had that first call he got it he got he wasn't like a lot of the VC's who were pressing us to have 2 million AR yesterday you know he understood oh wow you guys have crazy distribution and adoption which is rare and and people who know no I mean YK you know but not everyone knows and we we see that love we know the value but a lot of VCS you know you're just another company that's not a 2 million AR so fortunately um they got it and shortly after I introduced Daran to my cofounders Toby and Christian and you know we started going through the round really fast within two weeks um you know we had met the three of us with the entire gradient partnership team and then uh the week after that I negotiated the terms with Daren um him and I and we make sure everything was fair to the team the larger team as well as to gradient and we signed the term sheet by I think it was like maybe two and a half weeks and then within six weeks everything was wired sealed and done and that was I want to say a month ago so the second kind of huge learning for those listening and in this space is if they someone wants to do it they can do it fast so if they're dragging you on for 6 months you know like with dating as we said um it's it's usually not a friendly sign I just went on a whole SPI i k so feel free to tell me if if there are things I'm missing or are things that should be cleared up right uh so one immediate question I have yeah please is you did a seed round of 2 million and then you did another seed round of six million how does that work yeah so um in terms of equity financing so three million was the original round that happened I want to say 20 yeah end of 2019 when it was formed and this round technically is called a C+ so depending on it it's very Venture Capital but it's it's usually between a seed and an A and some people would call it a bridge it's called Bridge round or you can call it a plus round but essentially it's a seed round it's not a series a cuz six is for us still too small for a series a um but still in today's market uh a really fair and squared seed round and fortunately for us you know I know a lot of people are doing safes and notes as debt um this one is kind of fair and square Equity round nice yeah yeah I mean again that's amazing to hear and I'm trying to think of something you know that would be useful to hopefully the maximum number of people listening yeah and one thing that stands out to me is the personal connection aspect of it yeah you know you mentioned these open source Executives that that you sort of are new in your network and they introduce you to even more people yeah uh so it sounds like building this personal Network it has been a huge part of your success so far absolutely and it's it's really important especially for those listening some I know maybe are not as extroverted or don't really you know they think of networking I I've heard this a lot everyone thinks of networking as this like use car salesman old model you know and but reality is it's kind of like making friends online too on on Twitter or on Discord you're just making a friend like you asked me why do you come to GitHub because I have friends I have met on met on Twitter met met on Discord met on whatever that I've never like touched hugged highfived all the things and whenever for example whenever I go to a Dev Meetup in SF and there's you know say people at Dev meet up I say oh I'm from charm and I'm usually you know I I don't go to Dev meetups every day I don't know who knows us who doesn't know us I just assume no one knows us you know or at least me and then when people are like oh my gosh charm I love charm I use VHS I use bubble tea you're from charm the CLI company and I'm I'm so touched I'm like we're friends we're already friends you know and so that kind of I think that is something very special to open source that not not every type of company gets to enjoy this network of very creative passionate opinionated developers that are all striving to create something for the better ecosystem with maybe some with an agenda but largely just trying to share wealth of knowledge which is something I really enjoy working with YK and and your platform your friends is just sharing oh how do you grow better how do you start coding like trying to remove those barriers and that's also what kind of draws me into open source even though I'm not you know your traditionally trained Dev right uh so it sounds like the people you talk to online you know like the online Network you have you value that yeah value a tons and and it's funny because um I've also gotten the the frequent question they're like oh you're not you know you're not a Dev you're like how do you how do you kind of connect with these folk and you know when I first joined I'll admit that that was like that was a question I had I was like you know I'm not going to be telling them about the best sources to find you know the hottest tooling and and now I know a little bit about you know dabbling with my configuration zshell files but like you're thinking about um what do they need so I think W you've been so good about you know helping people introduce them to easy ways to connect or build tooling or getting into Ai and for me I'm kind of the honorary parentheses bis person for devs so when when my team who is very technical everyone is Technical and I'm the only one who runs business stuff when they need questions on marketing or maybe some of them are doing um have Partnerships with a Hashi corporate Enterprise and they're working on their SLA they're like what are Market terms or for example some of them are curious about freelancing or investor stuff how does that work like you had asked and I'm sure common question what is a preed or a safe round or these things that to be honest devs have no need to know really but maybe they're just naturally inclined or they think about starting their company one day they just want to be in and I'm like hey I'm that person that can like that's like all I do bread and butter like let me share some knowledge in a way that is applicable to you and let me help you like your support contract this is what I've seen as Market I want to get you the best great and I want to offer you to you cuz you're you're part of the community and you know at no charge whatsoever we're just all here to help each other right so it sounds like you you help Debs with business stuff and Debs help you with technical stuff kind of yeah and I'm definitely not shy as my team knows ask all the stupid questions I'm very much about it and I very much ask hey what are top you know tools and tips you you wish you knew when you launch your first open source project or um what is um I someone asked me if we the hottest tools that you're seeing in the market right or the newest editor or the newest kind of AI function that they want to try around with I'm not in these things day and day out and so and but but not only do they help me with stuff it's also like there're are users right so I want feedback I want them to try our stuff and just tell me what they like what they don't like and I think through kind of building that Rapport and Trust they can be more Trust full of of me of the team of the charm brand that you know JayZ's not going to snake you right because like you know we we've talked to her like she can take tough feedback and and I want them to be passionate if there's some stuff that we can improve they want features on that's something that is geeez that's something that uh that I want to hear and improve on cool uh so you talked about about negotiation I think that's a huge topic uh and you know it's good to hear that this is a bridge round you know it does uh give a little bit more context on this you know it's not a pure seed round so that's good to know but still six million for bridge round you know between seed and series a that's well it's double it's double the size it's the double of the size of our Original Seed yeah right so and you mentioned negotiation so how did you negotiate oo I mean we might need another hour for this session um let me think so I actually negotiation is something of an art just like coding is an art and I love it it is so fun uh I know how many people just hate it because often times it can feel confrontational but I think one of the top things to consider is to think of it as a mindset so when you think about negotiation it's like I like to think of it as a conversation and it's a little bit of a game where I think where people get stuck is they think of it as Zero Sum and that's fair because that's been their maybe their life experience right so maybe from and I'm just drawing this out of air but when you were little it's like if you had a sibling and resources were slim then hey you got to give that toy to the younger brother and or like okay I only have um only one of you the winner gets the ice scream so only it's a zero sum only the winner gets it and and as you get older more of those circumstances come up like only the the only the gold winner gets their credit in the Limelight and the silver and the bronze no one hears about ever again and it feels like you're pinpoint against each other but in kind of in business or in negotiation in anything right it should be kind of a friendly exchange it is transactional don't get me what we're very much in capitalism here um but it should be like um if you do it right uh in in hopefully an environment that's suitable and again the right investor it should be fair and so there are many items say there are 10 items on a term sheet or on a contract or on an SLA I'm trying to make this applicable to everyone that or like a job offer right um there if there's 10 items you can negotiate then you kind of try to prioritize what matters most so maybe you know we care about the amount of dollar invested in so for us that was six um and we maybe we care about valuation the most right we maybe we don't care about whether they take a board seat or not um maybe we don't care about if they take two board seats um or maybe they care about that the founders are 20% vested or 50% vested or Founders have you know 50% of the company or I'm just throwing blank numbers or they have 25% of the the company like there there are certain things that investors care about from their point of view um and there are certain things we care about from the company's point of view so how do you align things that make sense for each of you in terms of that priority matching and then how can you work around a compromise around things that are somewhat important to each of you and so for those listening if you think about daytoday you think about I think most common people think about negotiating in their job offers right and I've kind of advised various friends in the network or or or those have you even devs right for negotia advice and and I think sometimes the Golden Nugget is like how much can I charge but really like there are other polls that you can do hey can I be remote I mean remote that flexibility is a big pull that's a nonfinancial benefit another might be title right that's a big fin like principal versus staff versus junior engineer those main different things to different people can you pull that now vacation days you know you have 10 set vacation days or you have unlimited I mean unlimited vacation that I mean everyone in the room just like sparked up um another might be going to GitHub Universe one or two uh annual conferences where you get to network where you get to meet YK in person and uh those are all those are all meaningful like what are skills that matter to you in the longer term if a company say it's a startup they're Limited in resources they're like hey we can't do this but we want to help you succeed we will introduce you to the CEOs of super base or whoever to help you grow and and that's meaningful that's always something to think about hopefully it does actionable yeah I think it definitely is I'm now curious because you mentioned uh the CEO of super B twice yes couple yes he's a friend he's a friend what's your relation like how you know can you tell us more about that yes so I mentioned couple partly because um when we were at least when I was joining charm they were kind of the most recent very successful open source venturebacked company you know there are more uh you know more advanced quotequote so there's you know geell um you know from nextjs now a huge preo and then there is also uh obviously Hashi Corp right Hashi being the IPO example of Open Source now subab base being like where we are right ahead of us they just rais I think a big series b um they we kind of look at them as the big brother that we want to Aspire to and couple I was introduced through the open source community and we've since hung out you know a few times and got to know each other he he knows of charm and you know I get to ask him for advice on a little bit in the hey big brother like what did you guys do when you guys were trying to go to market initially you guys had huge open source TR R traction and um whenever he sees my investor updates uh he will send me like um I I was I remember one investor update I was like oh our we just had our third project go viral and we've now kind of honed this playbook for open source projects and I remember he like texted me he was like can you share the Playbook but but similarly too when we announced our six million round um he was one of the first to text me and say hey you guys just he sent me a screenshot you guys made the front page of Hacker News and I I didn't even know this cuz he got the news earlier and uh and so it's a it's a great relationship I think it's very important to have friends who are we've also done kind of highlights together streaming events together and you know when they do a sub base event or when we do a charm event we all always like try to invite each other um because we share Community um and I think that's very special as you cultivate these relationships a lot of them you know in person I find them very efficient so come to GitHub H's relationship with the GitHub Giants but also Microsoft also AWS also um various individual Champions enthusiasts maintainers that's huge for anyone I've also had this conversation with individual devs who's told me like IRL has changed your life once they kind of got out of that I'm only comfortable in my home coding mode it it does step out of it it changes your life and I encourage it for everyone did you just say get out of your house to change your life well for those who are who are used to kind of just being in their own environment in their home which I get comfy cozy I mean we all love being in PJs but like I have heard from specific de friends of mine who've now done very well as individuals there they said the top tip that changed my life was going out there meeting people IRL that's that's a quote from someone who's you know quite prolific so I think that's a hacker tip that I can share with many so if there's one takeaway from this get out of your house hey sweats are all the rage right now you can even go out in your in your sweats so come for the stickers and uh and stay for the friends nice so you know it's amazing uh to hear your journey and it's interesting to think about super Bas example because M you know to me it's a clearer example of a business that's based on open source project or a couple of Open Source projects because they're able to host uh their own you know open source services and charge for that and that's a very clear monetization strategy but for you yeah you're prerevenue correct but you still were able to convince investors that this is a valuable business how did you do that yeah yeah so it's a good question it's about finding the right investor who believes in your longterm Vision right so we do have a go to market commercialization strategy and we do have you know a product that we're working on you know stay tuned um and so it's about showing the right investor that this is something that will work in the long term and right now we're investing our time and resources on growing the proper Foundation community and network that will lead to conversion for the Right audience right because I mean why K you know this so well with open source a lot of companies choose not to do that and I know this because they've told me because it's a very passionate creative also opinionated user base and you know sometimes they are they you know don't like certain way that the ways things are handled and and we don't want because of we value our users so much we don't want to flip on certain things too soon soon we want to make sure the product is right to our users who are willing to see the value and eventually pay for it and we will always have open Source Products that's going to be always a core component of the company um but for some users a subset of that probably organizations more they will have additional features that make sense for them to pay for like I'm thinking Enterprise features correct so Enterprise features um to deal with maybe compliance security team related stuff ACL nothing that you haven't seen before nothing that superbase is not doing GitHub is not doing like you're seeing the Enterprise bottle they are you know they are the giant right they're free everything open source everything you know more Donuts more chips all the things and then Enterprise is like you know six figure contracts at a time right and so yeah yeah I think I I want to sort of you know play The Devil's Advocate and you know push it back on that a little bit yeah because you know again with with superbase it's a hosty service you pay for it but it's very clear GitHub same thing it's a hosty service you pay for it but charm is not a hosting service it's a local you know app so I'm wondering you know how do you even approach that so I can't revealed too much yet um when we have the product hopefully we can talk again and and I can share a lot more but we are certainly exploring certain models um including kind of the right user set and um starting with a lot of our early adopters what that looks like we'll be trying out them probably with a either free or very very low price to start out with and hope to include some of those listening in that early alpha beta testing phase um and and we'll be exploring that's kind of all I can share for now um and uh but yeah we do look at you know your GitHub and super base for a reference and stay tuned it's all I can say right I guess this does come back to you know building your relationship with uh your user base maybe Enterprise customers potential customers it's a conversation that needs to happen to figure out H how to monetize this you know whole thing right yeah absolutely and in today's market kind of what are people willing to pay for what is the pricing Point what's the customer Journey it's a whole I mean once you get into an organization that's funded by VC it's a whole spectrum of things that we will have a part two conversation on but uh but for now we uh we're we're going one step at a time awesome uh I think this is a perfect note to end this conversation on uh thank you so much for being here if you have any you know quick last word feel free to go ahead yeah I guess I just want to say you know thank you for those who have supported us during this time uh we're very appreciative of the open source community and you know check us out on Discord on Twitter we're at charm CLI I'm at JayZ musings if you want to DM us tweet at us we're very friendly people we're quite responsive i' like to think and um yeah let us know your feedback thank you YK thanks for being here again
