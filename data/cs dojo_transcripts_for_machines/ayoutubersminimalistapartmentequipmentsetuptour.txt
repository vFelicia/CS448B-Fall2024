hey everyone so on my last video someone asked me to make a video showing my apartment but I realized if I were to just do that it would be pretty short because my apartment is fairly small so instead I'm also going to show you guys some of my equipment and setup that are used for making YouTube videos just in case you guys are curious about that kind of stuff anyway let's get started you can just edit this time for sure make sure first wow your place is so nice no big thing so thank you guys for down here these are my friends Kevin sorry carry camera and this is it sorry that I guess yeah so this is a onebedroom apartment in downtown Toronto as some of you know and yeah this is my kitchen I guess there's like nothing special here maybe except for my Google home I didn't like I only got it just because it was kind of cheap but it's surprisingly useful like for yet time Ryerson music and stuff rich here and then this is where I work usually this place and you know this too like this table this is my living room do you guys want to see my play buttons yeah for sure yeah unfortunately it's not on display the unboxing this one is like for a hundred thousand subs you want say it's not that heavy the other one is the other ones like much bigger all looks so sweet oh yeah this one's for 1 million subs you know your car's a big club now yeah finally it's so pretty you look old yeah everything your old oh yeah let me see let me show you guys some of those things here so these are the whiteboard is I sometimes use like actually what I do is these white boys is like I put one of them like right here sort up on the wall and then tape it and then I just like do this and they film it I'm like what I feel me like only like this part of my body it looks like you know I'm just like standing instead of like this is the pen table I use for like you know writing on the screen like yeah so this is just USB that connects to my laptop and I just write oh mama it's me no way oh yeah so let me show you guys like my other rooms first and then you know we're gonna come back to my equipment so this is my bedroom actually I'm leaving here you know with my girlfriend so this is our bedroom the bathroom also pretty stun guard I feel like this place is like pretty old but for an old apartment you know it's not thought to that let's go back to my equipments so I guess I'm gonna show you guys a little bit about like how I make my videos just in case you guys are curious we are so this is my main camera it's like panasonic lumix it's a mirrorless camera if you guys so usually what I do is I felt like like running balls here and then I use this very little thing it's like a tripod that bends like that and then just the angle and then I see here so I basically like move this chair here and then sit here to shoot oh do you guys want to guess what the rent is yeah yeah 1 mm 2.8 oh wow 22 yeah it's actually 23 1500 by like it's 23 15 you furnished oh really yeah so like like this chair is mine like I got a crown that was what everything else is like what you know it was here yeah so I was popping camera the microphone I use so I think when you make like youtube videos the audio is like more important than video what I use is it's a transceiver thing so basically I have this thing and then I have like something else that goes in your into my pocket basically and then the audio goes from my microphone like right here to my transceiver to the other transceiver and then into the camera so some people like take video and audio separately but I like to like take them at the same time so I don't need to like sync them later you know it's it's easier to like have everything in one file so that that's like the like standard setup I use when I do like tutorials on my laptop I use my you know my pro and I use like this webcam it's at a Logitech webcam it's like 80 bucks but the quality is like really good I think up to like a hundred thousand subscribers you know I was only using this camera because you know I don't want to spend that much money but anyway like I miss this oh wow that's too much yeah this one like goes onto the table and they're just like talking so their microphone like this I see yes mr oh yeah one thing estimation is for editing the videos I use Final Cut Pro I'm not like super happy with it but you know that's what I know so that's what I use I use my macbook pro it's like a couple years old it's good for like post editing videos and Cody it's great usually like I just sit here for like so recently I got this like really cool sort of thing that goes with my laptop so usually it's like this way but I realize it's too low but then they gave me this thing that I kind of problems up the my book so it's basically like good it's a cool thing it's attached onto the laptop and then I can just like do this to use it as a laptop stack and like if I want to like crazy further I want I give this boosts man thing this one's like really small and then I'll be like I'm selling stuff yeah it's videos it's not supposed to buy lists but maybe I lost them haha yeah it is I've had it like for a couple of years and they just do this so like the setup usually looks like this you found when I like yeah when I edit or when I code and then like my back's 30 hurting recently like sometimes you like I said so much so I made this like really crappy a standing desk up so I just like yeah I feel like all of my setup is like pretty crappy and yeah just like my roots down put it up and then just like put it here it's like it's super crappy but it works and then just do this this is way more stable than I thought it'd be yeah yeah yeah I thought I was gonna followed that it's actually pretty stable yeah so you were saying yeah it is actually interesting though you look candid right like I'm actually righthanded but for the mouse I really yeah like it's just like chopsticks NFL's top or you officer I can yeah that's a real new I am righthanded yeah no I like I do everything except for like they're bouncing really no I would show you but I don't have chopsticks I thought it was house yeah my friends think it's funny that I don't have Java C yeah I like forks and knives or five yeah so like you know certain has a soft conclusion you know I don't like to buy a lot of stuff and that's why I like I have a lot of crappy stuff like this it's definitely not a stir grumble but it works and it's cheap alright I guess I guess that's it oh I think I'm gonna put a link to like my FAQ page where I list all my equipment you know in case you guys want to buy any of those if you guys have any like topic requests for any videos you want me to make it the future maybe know in the comment section yes sir Gaming is gaming you would say later
