hi everyone this is a new video series I'm just starting where I'm going to try and build a real startup using Python and JavaScript and this startup is going to be based on this idea I have four new app for learning languages I'm gonna explain more about it later but initially it's gonna be a website and then later an app for improving your writing skills in any language you want to learn whether it's Japanese English or French anyway in this series my goal is to show you sort of that whole process of trying to build a startup so that includes stuff like designing the app coding marketing the app monetizing the app eventually and maybe even asking for investments at some point I'm also planning to make this whole thing an opensource project so that you'll be able to see every single line of code I'm gonna write ok and in this first video in the series I'm gonna explain what I'm going to build exactly and what the initial version of this app is going to look like what I've done so far for this business and then I'm gonna show you how I set up juggle on my computer right here so Django is of course something called a web form work that's based on Python ok so let's get started first of all let me just quickly explain what I'm gonna be hold exactly by the way the reason I wanted to build this particular product and not anything else is because I noticed that there aren't a lot of good resources for improving your writing skills in the foreign language you're trying to learn you know there are a lot of other good resources for improving your reading listening and speaking skills but not so much for reading and that's why I wanted to you know build this particular product so let's say you're learning Japanese then the way this app is gonna work is you're gonna first write some stuff in Japanese on this app and a random native Japanese speaker on this app let's say like me it's gonna take a look at what you wrote and then fix it for you and if he's learning let's say French then you know random French native speakers are gonna take a look at what he wrote and then they will fix it for him so that way everyone will be able to improve their writing in the languages they are trying to learn actually there's already a similar website for this called long gate but the main problem with this website is that first of all it's kind of hard to use and secondly they recently closed down new registrations so it's pretty much unusable at this point so basically you know I want to make a better version of what they were trying to do in the first place okay so let me explain how the initial version of this new app is going to work initially this app is gonna be based on Twitter just to make the initial version really simple to build but eventually you'll be able to use this app without using Twitter at all anyway let me show you what this app is gonna look like with this wireframe I created I'm thinking of calling this application edit dojo by the way because we're gonna be editing each other's posts so when you open this app or website you know you'll see some expression about how it's gonna work and then you see this button that says sign up with Twitter so you'll be able to sign up with your Twitter account so like I said earlier this is just the initial version or the MVP of this product so eventually you'll have buttons like sign up with your email address and sign up with your Facebook accounts sorry about my voice by the way I think my throat is not in the best condition anyway after you sign up with Twitter you'll see this simple registration form to finish your registration so you just need to say I want to improve my writing skills and you know Japanese let's say and I'm fluent in English say and then you click Submit to finish your registration process and after you finish your registration process you will start seeing other people's tweets in your native language let's say English right here so let's take a look at this person's tweet right here it's by @yk dojo and he says the breakfast I had today today was awesome so there are some spelling errors here when you you know find mistakes like that you can just click this edit button and then edit this tweet for this person just like that and then if you want to improve your writing skills let's in Japanese you just need to go into your Twitter account and start tweeting in Japanese and once you tweet you know other people are gonna see your tweet and once they fix it you're gonna get a tweet from this account I created at edit dojo so that you know you know when someone else fixes your tweets okay so that's the idea of this app now let me just show you what I've done so far for this business first of all as you can see right here I created you know this Twitter account at edit dojo I think I'm gonna change the profile picture later and then I set up this waiting list for this app where if you're interested in using this app at some point in the future you can type in the languages you want to learn and that languages you're fluent in as well as your email address so that I can let you know when the app is ready for your particular language combination and then after that I went to this website called Namecheap to get a domain for this project I got editors yota IO for this project and there's actually no particular reason why I use this particular website Namecheap you know I could've used anything else but it's just that I'm used to using Namecheap and then after all of that I set up jungle on my computer so let me show you how I did that and like I said earlier jungle is of course a web form work that's based on Python and that's what I'm gonna use in this project now if you try following this part of the video on your computer and if you have any trouble with it feel free to ask questions on the slack Channel I set up for this it's called edit dojo depth you can find a link to the slack group at CH dojo dot IO / edit right here you'll also be able to find the source code of this project right here on the same page and I'm gonna put a link to the github page later right here okay so the first thing I did when I got started on this project is I just searched for Django hello world because you know I wanted to get started with just with a hello world and then with this search krei I ended up finding this book called Django for beginners and it turns out to be actually pretty good so that's what I'm gonna follow in this video if you want to find the book for yourself you can do that at CH dojo io / DJ or they also have a few free chapters of this book at Django for beginners calm okay so following this book the first thing I did was I installed Python 3 and something called Pippin and I'm gonna explain what pip m is later and here I'm gonna show you how I did that on the Mac because I'm using a Mac but if you use you know Linux or Windows I recommend just taking a look at this book to see how you can install them actually the part about installing all of that is available for free at jungle for beginners calm anyway once you install Python 3 and Pippin on your computer you can just skip to this time in this video ok so the first thing I did on my Mac is installed homebrew which is what's called a package manager for Mac a package manager is basically something that allows you to install different applications easily on your computer I went to homebrews homepage Buddha SH and then I found this command I copied it and then I pasted it in terminal so Oh Mac you can just press command space to open spotlight and then type in terminal and then open the terminal app so once you open this app you can just paste that command and then it's gonna start installing homebrew for you so again if you're using Windows or Linux this step is gonna be different so follow the book I mentioned earlier instead anyway if you're on the Mac once you install homebrew you can just type in brew install Python 3 to install Python 3 on your computer so you know basically type that command and then press enter to install python 3 after that in terminal try typing in python 3 space that version and then press ENTER to see what version of Python 3 you have on your computer if you see python 3.7 that's great because that's what I have here but if you see python 3.6 or python 3.8 or you know something similar that should be fine so don't worry if what you see is not exactly the same as what I see here okay so once you have python 3 on your environment the next step is to install something called Pippin Pippin helps you create something called a virtual environment for Python I'm not going to go into the details of what it is exactly so if you're curious I recommend just you know taking a look at the book I mentioned earlier at CS dojo da io / DJ any way to install pip m we're gonna use pip 3 which homebrew should have installed for you when you install Python 3 and pip 3 is a package manager for Python so just to quickly recap homebrew is a package manager for Mac and it's for different kinds of applications and homebrew allows you to install pip 3 which is also a package manager but it's only for Python packages including pip em any way to install pip em which allows you to create a virtual environment for Python just run tip 3 space install space pip m and then press Enter and that's it for the setup for now in summary you know after this process is complete you should have installed Python 3 and pip m and you know like I said earlier the process is going to be different for Windows and Linux so if you have any trouble going through this process you should join our slack group so that you can get help from others anyway after this process you're actually ready to create your first project with Django the first thing you need to do for that is you need to create a folder somewhere let's say on desktop for now so open terminal you might have already have it opened and then type in CD space tilde slash this stop if you're using a Mac and this is a UNIX command so something like this should work on a Mac and Linux but windows you might need to use a slightly different command or you might need to install an application that allows you to use the Unix commands on Windows again there is more information about that on the book I mentioned earlier okay so you can read CD tilde slash desktop as change directory or go to this directory desktop within tilde which stands for the home directory and once you run this command you should see desktop right here and that means that we're in this directory right now the stop and once you're on desktop run this command LS this command shows all the files and folders within that directory right now on my desktop I have three or two folders and one file see a social desktop here I get desktop and Django for beginners export PDF so that's exactly why you should see right here see a social desktop hey like a desktop and another file right here okay the next step after that is you need to create a folder on desktop called edit dojo there are two ways of doing it one is a simpler way just go to desktop and then create a folder like you usually do you know click right click and then click new folder but actually you can do the same thing in terminal you can do that by typing in MK dir space edit dojo this says make directory or make folder that's gonna be called a dojo once you press enter here it should have been created you can check that just by going to desktop right here or typing in LS and it should show this new folder that you just created edit dojo and once you create the folder you need to go into this folder by typing in CD or change directory space edit dojo if it works you should see edit dojo right here to show that you're in this directory right now and this folder edah 20 is gonna be where we're gonna put all our code that we're gonna create later the next step is to install jungle with Pippin you can do that by typing in pip em install Django Iko Iko 2.1 this says use people to install jungle whose version is gonna be 2.1 and before you run this command make sure that you're in the folder that you just created edited o so once you type it in press Enter and this should create a virtual environment for you with Django installed and here's the reason why you need to create a virtual environment here using ppm it's because the virtual environment for this particular project specifies which particular version of jungle you want to use for this particular project so if you have two projects you'll be able to create two separate virtual environments one for each and that way you can say something like I want to use Django 2.1 for project a and jungle 2.2 for project B and that's basically what virtual environments are for anyway to make sure this command worked you can just type in LS here and you see these two files pip file and pip file that lock if this step didn't work I suggest that you close down this terminal window and then you know open the terminal window again go to desktop by typing in tilde slash desktop and then go to the same folder edit dojo and just repeat the same thing okay once you see those two files in the current folder tip file a tip file dot lock you're ready to go to the next step which is creating a new jungle project you can do that by first going into your virtual environment by typing in p.m. show you should see something like this it might be slightly different but if you see something like parentheses edit dojo and maybe something after that that means that you're in the virtual environment you need to be in this virtual environment to be able to use the particular version of Django that you installed earlier so once you're in the virtual environment type in Django admin start project edit dojo and a score project and then dot this means I use this command Django admin to start a new project which is gonna be called eight dojo underscore project and then don't forget the dot after that and this just says create this project in the current directory dot once you press enter this is going to create a new jungle project for us after that if you run LS you should see something like this you will notice that there are two folders two files that have been created manage that PI and edit dojo project which i think is a folder after that let's start up our django server you can do that by typing in python space manage top pi and then run server once you press Enter you should see something like this and this says starting development server at this URL so copied this zero go to your browser and just paste that URL here if everything works you should see a window like this it says the install worked successfully congratulations okay so that's the process I went through to set up jungle you know typically setting up the right environment is the hardest part of starting any project so I think it's really important to be able to get help from others as you go through the process so again if you need help join our slack channel by going to see us dojo da yo / edit you know if you have some experience with this I'd really appreciate it if you could help others there too I mean I'm gonna do my best to help everyone there too but you know my time is limited and I don't have that much experience with Windows and Linux so I'd really appreciate that you'll also be able to see the source code on github on this page too and like I said earlier if you're interested in using this app at some point in the future you can just go to ACS dojo da io / wait to sign up for my waiting list also if you want to check out the book I mentioned earlier check it out by going to CH dojo io / DJ or just check out the free chapters by going to jungle for beginners calm okay anyway in the next video I'm gonna show you how I built a hello world project with Django thank you as always for watching my videos and let me know if you have any questions you know either on our slack channel or in the comment section below okay I will see you guys in the next video
