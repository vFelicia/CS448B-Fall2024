all right we are live um francesco it's good to have you here and everyone thank you for being here and you know i think we're gonna just assume that we're audible if there's some issues we'll probably get something in the comments um so francesco first of all do you mind introducing yourselves yourself for us yes can you hear me first of all yes okay perfect okay so hi i'm francesco from rome i'm 38 i'm a developer advocate for daily dev as you can see from the tshirt i don't know if you can see it and i'm also docker captain very active on social media especially twitter and youtube but with spaces so this is how i i get i got in touch with the uk which is of course amazing that's it cool and you're here to talk about introverted developers on social media right yes that's the title of the this presentation this is a presentation that i made the two weeks ago uh the we are developers conference in berlin it was an inperson event so it sounds a bit strange because usually you do a webinar and then you do the the the impersonal one so instead we are doing the the other way so he's already in person and now here but thank you so much for inviting me i hope that we can help someone and yes let's get started cool and you have like a presentation file and everything so i think we can just get right into it yeah sure perfect okay should i start okay yes i think that'd be great okay hi everyone how are you today i'm standing up i think it's the first live stream or not the second live stream that i'm standing up the first one it was with james quick so but really wanted to reproduce something that is similar to an inperson event at least now i'm in my house i'm getting very hot with all those lamps but anyway let's get started with the with this presentation so introvert the developers on social media this is a topic that uh it's very important for me to talk about i think this will be one of my very few nontechnical talks or we will see in the future but let's get started because i think that this can help someone and of course feel free to drop all the questions so we will get them uh after at the end of the presentation so sorry this is the slide for the for the live presentation so you have to have to introduce again when francesco developed yes yes i'm active on twitter let's go fast here so introverted developers on social media let's try to break down this title in chunks and let's try to analyze them word by word more or less so the first word is introverted so what does it mean what is the definition of being an introvert and i tried to make a definition myself like i don't know recharge but there is you like so you said at some point i said no maybe it's better to to take a person who is more expert than me and let's try to get his definition and so we will talk and we'll try to define who is an introvert and who is an extrovert by the way i am an introvert and i'm i have nothing against the extroverts of course so the definition is from this uh this guide is this professor carl gustav jung and he is the founder of the modernistic analysis and even if i someone said that his definition definitions are a bit old maybe because optic analysis also made some some progression in the last 50 50 years for sure this definition is not bad it's like having the basic html css and javascript you never you never go wrong so let's start with the extrovert so who is an extrovert an extrovert is a person who always seeks for external input and action it they really need to interact with something constantly okay instead an introvert is a person who focuses all their energy internally and they focus on uh reflection uh understanding things and dreaming so this is what the introvert are more focused on and of course being an introverted is a defined trait it's not it's something that is very hard to change maybe it's not impossible but uh there are some variables so it can depend for example if you're an introvert and you are with your friends you tend maybe to to joke more being like more interactive you like that and this is some also something that can change of the on the context and also with age and so an introvert person is oriented in their own way of processing stuff so they like to watch something and process process that instead of just putting out and being an introvert it means that you have different traits and some of these traits are sovereignty reservedness interest and last but not least creativity keep in mind this world because we will talk about this soon it's getting hot here so this is very important introversion is very important introversion is not shyness it's not being shy the shyness is the tendency of fearing the judgment of others and we can work on these uh i definitely worked on these in the past two years especially on social media being shy can lead to isolate yourself avoid the social media situations and usually in adolescence it's more pronounced instead with the with the age it tends to decrease also also known as my grandpa doesn't give a dumb okay okay so um we're not gonna into uh deep into this topic but i want to also say that if the shyness is too much pronounced we can also talk about uh disturbance of social anxiety social phobia and this is something different this is not shyness this is not shyness this has nothing to do with introversion and again so the introvert is not shy they also they have this tendency of keeping things for themselves and not to show sharing this with someone else so this can be bad for example if you are on social media because social media it's all about shooting stuff right so then still now for me sharing something it's always a bit strange like why should i share something like i like an article i like a video why should i share it it still seems a bit strange to me now i'm more used of course okay so we will go faster on this we will go faster than this one can you hear me perfect okay we will answer later um so let's go fast on this part which is a developers otherwise this will take really hard and let's just talk about uh these um as you can see here at the bottom right this is how italian news program represented a hacker i don't know if you can see it but check black hoodie and check the screen it's this is not a joke uh it's just a picture of the matrix okay and so the question is is becoming a is being a developer that makes it you introvert like you while working in this black hood you become an introvert or maybe it's the maybe it's the opposite is that many introverts like being developers so maybe many people who are introverts by nature for them being a developer is not something strange i mean they know that they don't have to interact this is not totally true but let's say to start with development you're not scared of what will happen when you will be a developer so so yes so we will talk about this later and again um being a development is a creative process i think that developers are the the artist we will be remembered in thousands of years like people who were like creating stuff with the keyboard and mouse and monitors so since being a developer is for me a creative process and since introvert i have creativity as one of their traits this can also be the reason why many introverts like being a developer by creating stuff for developing stuff okay and now we are on the last part so last part is of course the social media so i'll try to show what has been my process because uh i have a secret i don't know if this is a secret for many of you now but probably for someone is i've i'm not been a developer for all my life i i'm an imposter i've been a developer just for the last seven years before that i was a volleyball coach so i was working in sport so when i approached the social media i tried to use a model that worked for me so if you like exercising if you like and work out maybe if you have been a coach to we can be friends of course you can use this approach so training literally training yourself on social media doing something step by step trying to uh we'll see this uh soon and yes i really love this list mr pictures of myself and of course by training you can achieve really unexpected results you don't when we start working out in a gym we don't even know which achievements we can we can have so um by the way this is uh just my story so i'll try to share with you what worked for me okay and easy i called this the seven steps ladder so there are the seven steps that for me worked to to go at the top of this ladder to increase your social media presence okay because sometimes it's hard you can really feel as i say the fear of judgment maybe you're just getting started and maybe you need some help just at the beginning and then of course you can do whatever you want okay so the first step is to share some text on some social media i know that what i say can sound uh dumb and stupid for someone but it's not because for example i asked in person how many of you have ever done uh text content on social media not everyone like 80 so maybe some people there they didn't even start if you asked me these like three years ago i would be on level zero but we started from one maybe i should have started from zero okay and this is uh so uh the step two is what i applied is to share some visual content and i mean like some picture pictures of yourself this is something for example is a picture that uh julia made of me when we were at the seaside and these uh here you start basically to show your face to getting ready to feel judgment you are you are ugly you are short your fat all your imperfections you know but uh this is something we need to get used if we want to communicate with someone someone and help them we need to expose ourselves uh yes then another step the third step is uh sharing a video and this is one of my favorite videos because this is the first video that i shared on social media it was the 25th of july 2020 so it was about less than two years ago and now i am on the aka youtube channel i don't know what happened but thank you and taking this video took me a lot of time and a lot of tries and but i made it let's say just a 23 seconds video and maybe sharing and i think this is a very important moment because we are showing ourselves showing our face showing our accent orbit accent there can be many problems the audio cannot be good the camera cannot be good so there can be many things that can go wrong in this case and but until this point point three there is something which is uh important that this type of content is not synchronous it's asynchronous i can create this video and i just have to find the coverage to post it you just have to be brave enough to post it instead let's go on the point four i think many of you know this point i can i can't believe that i'm doing this twitter spaces on a live stream on the yk youtube channel amazing i made it so twitter spaces are really amazing by the way i skipped this part because when i wanted to make videos on youtube or live streams we can say they were not utter spaces so i had to basically script skip this part if you have problems problem in exposing yourself getting used and making practice making twitter spaces can be really a game changer because basically you are exposing yourself in real time but you are not showing your face so this is really i mean i think the missing link between showing everything and doing something asynchronous okay we can make it with a space of course later and then another step is to make live streams so basically you can make a podcast with one of your friends we can like you can live code and it seems easy but it's not because you are showing all your skills you are doing something in real time with someone okay by the way this i would not define whatever we are doing now exactly like stream but more like this which is a live webinar so a live webinar is a bit different because you have to talk for 10 minutes 15 minutes without interruption and you have to explain some stuff maybe you also have some slides so i'll put these on a higher level and yes if you have a topic it can be great because of course you establish your expertise in doing something and it can really help and last one second and last is public speaking to be honest i'm really loving this this uh because you can travel and someone can argue that maybe this is not exactly social media but it's not true because for example your talk your presentation will be recorded will be posted on social media you can make a picture or many pictures with your friends after the presentation what i'm doing now i'm basically turning this public presentation into a webinar so you can also reuse it and let's see this as they may be the hardest part and so going many people are trying to skip some of those and they can't understand why it's so hard for them so uh so let's make a very fast fast recap and maybe this is not by the way this is not for everyone probably but uh this is what worked for me so maybe if you're stuck at some of those points this can help you just to visualize things better so sharing some text content then you go on some visual content so showing your face and then making some short video just synchronously then you start with the synchronous stuff so twitter spaces live streams live webinars like what are doing now and public speaking i i i think there are many people that would like to let's say achieve this result and i'm not talking about the numbers of people it can also be four people for 10 people but still it's all about getting used to talking in public okay okay so before we go before we go with the the q a i'd like to spend maybe five more minutes uh talking about some myths okay so the like the wrongest thing that say the things that you can say if you do something in public then you're an extrovert so if you you basically you turn you turn yourself into an extrovert once you do something in public this is false okay those people those are just some of the people that are selfproc selfproclaimed introverts but i'm sure there are way more maybe also johnny depp and they are just exposing themselves no matter their uh personality okay so this is you know i'm also an introvert by the way so i'm mentally i'm one of the living proof i'm not as big as them of course i can recognize some of them but yes but we think we can also share these slides if you want at the end and put them somewhere on the internet because many people asked me so i forgot but i'll share it now before uh yeah before we go in the questions well i i sent you something that you can do and but let's try to also spend a couple of minutes on something that you should not do i have the microphone you can't move much but say that i don't know if this is a way of saying in english but take the step longer than the leg it means that you want to do something without doing all the necessary steps and something also that you should not do is to stop your journey and so of course i'm talking about social media now so now for example stopping using social media doll instead if you try to stay consistent on social media i think that i without checking i've been tweeting consistently since december 2019 and me made an impact because now i'm here talking with all of you and um the last thing is that you should never force yourself forcing yourself especially for mental stuff it never works like now i have to study now i have to study it's impossible so he stayed i would have the different approach which is put yourself in the best condition to do something once you have the good condition and you are relaxed you can be creative this is also related to the creativity okay it's hard to create something if you are not in the right mental state maybe you can move rocks move boxes but it's very hard to create a song okay or create a video because you are stressed so this really does doesn't work i see some numbers here i don't know on a scale okay i really please don't say this if you don't want to really disappoint disappoint me introversion is not a disease that you can hit that you have to heal it's not that you it's not something bad i will never get tired to uh keep saying this uh forever so you it's something that you should accept and then you do something no matter how you are no matter your nature okay and i like also this one which is uh do it for other introverts so i'm here making a bit of fool of myself because maybe we can help someone else because i know how you feel if you're an introvert i know that it's hard to get started but i also know that it's it's great being an introvert you have you we have many good skills they are just inside we've adjusted to put them outside so yes this is something that can give us the right motivation and about the benefits i think we can talk for hours but i want to just stick to some of them the one of them is that you basically have a place to express yourself so having social media for example like a has also a youtube channel your twitter account you can express yourself you can say whatever you want maybe you we are focused on technical content but let's say that something important happens happens in my life i find a new job i quit a job that i don't like i don't know i get married or something else i have a place where i can share something about my life and i think this is very very powerful okay so this is a benefit that for example i really like that if i want if i visit some to some places and i want to share something on social media i can do it it's not a must but i can do it so this can be can be very important and that increases your opportunities we can talk about the opportunities for hours and it's my life really changed when i started using social media i thought they were just a scam or just a place just to waste your time after you have been stressed for a day but they are not they are not i can say that twitter changed my life multiple times not just one once in a couple of two years two years and half and yes and the last benefits is that you can find some friends and here we see i see many friends on the chat there were also some friends in person in berlin and yes so this is not a benefit that we should ignore so it's always great to find some people who have the same interest and then not just to just look at just to talk about coding models about our lives what happens in our life and i think this is great it's great and again it always gets easier i this is not a predator by the way and these are some of i don't know if you can find the okay here but but i started my youtube channel almost two years ago because yes and i have about 320 videos and they're gonna count that but i've noticed that the the more videos i do and the more i get used to that now i'm here on on this channel and i am doing basically this presentation and to be honest i'm super relaxed i can't wait to answer some questions it would have been super super hard to do these from from scratch like from zero doing this so i had to train myself okay and i think this is the last one on when i made my first presentation in poland someone someone asked me uh francesco why are you doing this because i was just there it was a web 3 presentation and uh i tried to i i thought for some seconds and then i say that i'm here and i want to be a public speaker because it's challenging i like challenges i have also have this approach like in sports so it's great to challenge yourself and see let's see if i can do this even if someone else say that i can do that that is too hard i also think that it's too hard and in 2018 for me it was even harder to attend a conference just because there were too many people and so this can be uh can be an interesting motivation i can say and so yes this was the last one so as a as a recap we are almost at the end so an introverted is is focused on themselves instead of the outside it's not that it's selfish or something else it's just that they prefer to keep things instead of having an interaction and sharing everything okay but even if if you are an introvert working on your social media presence can really help you to have opportunities that you really don't have an idea so i really highly recommend to at least try and of course there are so many formats so many things that you can try videos articles like streams someone is very expert in making super polished videos someone is more used to make a very good interaction with the audience so we all have our skills and perks and another thing is that the social media presence is not built in a day one of my favorite proverb is roma wasn't building a day because i'm from rome so we should always improve our social media day by day step by step tweet by tweet video by video and so good luck everyone if you want to improve your social media presence and now we are at the end of the presentation and that's all so introverts don't make questions or they do i'm done okay let's see all right uh thank you for that francisco um i guess we can go into uh some questions but you know if anyone in the chat has any thoughts about this presentation or has any questions just let us know in the chat nice thank you thank you yeah so i was asking you know the chat uh giving them a poll like are you an introvert or extrovert 64 said introvert 29 said somewhere between five percent said extrovert and two percent said i'm a bots so it seems like yeah most people are introverts here i know let's just let me put this on the other side so it seems that i'm looking more okay nice perfect can you hear me okay perfect yes um see yes i also i was shocked when i asked this in person like i think it's more or less the same percentage so uh this is also one of the reasons because when i to be honest when i joined the social media and for me i felt like i were one of the few people introvert you should have seen that there is the majority so this is also one of the reasons why i decided to make something so focused just to make people feel people who are introverted less alone this is important for me no i i really appreciate that and i feel like um that's something i i've noticed too like you know a lot of developers are introverts and yeah maybe it's it doesn't like necessarily come natural for them to like express themselves on social media and maybe in person i of course of course and i were one of them i mean so i totally understand i i've been a developer way before joining twitter like uh three years before so it's uh we can say that uh it has been a very long journey yeah by the way how much time do you have i have time i have time cool um so my my actions might be kind of unstable but um i'll do my best here uh so someone was asking me earlier like as an introvert you know i think the fundamental question of that why is basically like how do you improve your social skills to basically get through job interviews to get a job um yes and uh in the question sir and this is already a good point that uh first of all we should have like a reason because otherwise introverts they really don't want to do stuff the brain is super lazy so why should i stay in sweaters so it's so time consuming and i think that dedicate some time on social media consistently can make a huge impact on your career and to do that there is not a real secret for example in my presentation i don't talk about secrets how you can do that because there is literally no secret it's always a normal progression so it's just a daily work this is my approach that works for me and this can also work for you if you're stuck i also know people who they just jump from texting to just making presentations because for them it's not a problem maybe you've done them in the past maybe they were actors so for them is not a problem making a performance in public for example for me i've been a volleyball coach so for me talking to someone it's not in person it's not strange it's strange to talk to talk to someone who don't know me like in person this is this was strange the only the only time when i done this in the past it was for my thesis and then in some in four conferences and so on uh soon i'll be lost in india and in croatia but it's um there is no secret it's a small small steps to reach and then it will all everything will become easier for you another thing there is not in the presentation is that if you want some tips is to surround yourself with people with the same interest because when for example if you talk even about you if you have some people who already know you it's easier you know to talk about the topic to also talk about your life what happened in your life so this can be a secret you can create a group you can talk with someone on any social media usually i talk more about twitter because it's let's say social media that i started with but of course this applies can not be applied to also many others right thank you for that um yeah actually what i personally recommend for i guess introverts is you know like you say like start really small uh i think twitter is good because like it's mostly text based at least at the beginning so you can just like you know start commenting on other people's tweets um you know this is more about like social media but like if you basically have you know someone has no followers they can comment on other people's tweets you know interact with them that's that's a really good way to like get started because that way you know someone at least one person will see your tweet like if you tweet with no followers maybe no one will see your tweet and then you you can basically like make friends uh and then you know just like follow them interact with them in comments and then you can eventually like bring that into like uh dms and like do maybe like a coffee chat on google meet or something so like if you if someone who's an introvert like takes everything step by step like that you know they should be able to like you know like say bring bring it all away eventually to public speaking if they want to yeah sure sure of course but i think there's also there is an advantage if you don't have followers you can really focus on like two or three people that you can connect with you can dm them you have your inbox is not screaming every five minutes so it's good i think there is some advantage you can also make i think more mistakes if you share something which is not to correct 100 percent there will not be people judging you 24 7 at least i hope so and so there are also advantages in having a small account on and on social media it's not everything bad i mean you can focus on the creating some small connections when i when i started the very few connections this was the reason why i kept getting on twitter now i'm on twitter because i have many people i'm also a developer advocate so now it's basically a job for me but when you when you start and you have like zero people following you by the way we we didn't start we and yk didn't start with with 10k followers it started with zero i hope so so it's always hard at the beginning unless maybe you come from another social media for me i started really from zero but i mean uh even if you have zero followers you can you can go in some twitter spaces you can request to speak i highly recommend to maybe put your profile picture because otherwise i think it will be hard to get invited on stage usually i don't invite people with zero followers and without a proper picture just because they can be scammers people who say racist stuff so usually i avoid this but but i mean you can start and see what what really fits you because you don't know if you don't try you really don't know good luck yeah thank you for the francesco um so i just wanted to quickly mention for you know people who are not familiar with twitter spaces they're basically like these audio rooms uh where you know basically like you know up to say like 10 people can chat and then anyone can request to speak or you know people can like can be invited to speak there it's kind of like clubhouse if people are familiar with it uh it's it's a really cool like way to kind of you know interact with other people on twitter yeah exactly i've never used the clubhouse but i think that it's something something similar i've asked in person how many people know twitter species and it was like 10 percent of the people so i think in the future this will uh percentage will increase but we need to work on this but i think twitter should promote this this live stream yeah and i was kind of you know joking like uh to people in the chat you know welcome to our visual twitter space um i guess we yeah we we could have like a way for people to jump in but for now you know it's just the two of us it will be two spaces with videos basically yeah pretty much okay let's let's get to a question uh so i guess i can just put it here so this one you know you can see it the most difficult part as an introvert is to start the conversation how do you deal with that okay this is uh this is a great questions the pro the problem is that if you are an introvert we think that someone else they really don't want to have a conversation but as you can see here you say to start a conversation so let's try to turn it what if we have a same interest and i dm you or i comment on your tweet then in this case it's not a problem for you so i will try to find a common interest on twitter and just we don't have like to write a very long uh answer also because on twitter you can't but just trying something i i always i'm a huge fan of genuine connections so like thank you for this uh for this tip or you can add something on someone on someone and i think that if you if you dm someone if they i mean okay they have many followers maybe they have the many dm's per day so it's harder for them to reply but i think that if you don't start if you don't try you you never know and i mean and of course social media they are not real life maybe that person is not even checking the dms or maybe that person is not focused on twitter or maybe they are using a tool to share a post on twitter but they don't even open the app it can be so i think it's very important to don't get it personally if someone doesn't reply to you it's not that they are bad but i think that if you have a common interest for example if you want to talk about docker on web3 i'm always open so this is uh this is the secret thing having something in common in common to talk about without having uh so much pressure or feeling and i mean if the other person doesn't reply maybe they didn't check the the message or i don't know maybe they don't like our face but i mean it's okay all right uh thank you francesco yeah so i i think what i would add as an introvert to like start the conversation is to observe because i think um you know this might be a stereotype but typically as an introvert you know introverts tend to have like more um more of an observation skill i think um than an extrovert obviously not everyone um so it's it's important you know to be able to um just like you know observe like if it's online you can like look through their tweets don't think like you're stalker like it's it's all public anyway so look through their tweets see what they're interesting and then see like how you can start a conversation that way and if it's in person just like observe like listen to what they're saying or like listen to what uh or look at what they're wearing or you know what they have and then kind of go from there yeah and usually introverts have great skills i think they have the one of the most precious skill which is listening they listen to someone before uh before replying but i mean also introverts have friends maybe they have a bit less also introverts get married so i think that you have to to to start a conversation at some point yeah i think they i think that introverts have are very allergic to like uh very superficial or very like useless conversations they really run away in that case but i mean if the conversation has a meaning if there is something interesting to talk about i think that of course they can i mean you can you don't have to always start the conversation you can also help make someone else start it and just replying at the beginning not a problem and i mean yes so good luck uh hit gala all right thanks um i feel like i went through sort of most of the questions that were asked in the chat so i guess i can ask questions myself uh you know and you know we might have talked about it like on twitter and other places um but i think i'm curious about like your thought process behind you know basically quitting your development job to pursue your dreams yeah i can't believe that this happened like about one year ago it seems like 10 years ago so usually i don't put goals in my life because usually when you put a goal it you get disappointed so i prefer to talk about directions so what i want to do in what the direction do i want to go it's like a vector if you like physics so if for example i really enjoy the social media i want to improve on my social media presence i want to start making videos because uh before i wasn't even start i started making videos does working for a company who does everything secret with all github private repositories makes sense does it helps does it help this to go in that direction sadly the answer is no and i mean that job was very good because it was uh i was also working in an international environment but it was like it has nothing to do with what what i want to do in my life so this is why with this job i think it was a march april 2021 so almost uh not more than so much more than one one year and i think and i think that this is very important so when we have because you know we're always overwhelmed with the requests people asking to do stuff people that want to work with us so and it's important to understand if what we're doing it goes in the same direction okay so for example i want to work on my social media presence i also worked on my my twitter account does accepting a live stream on the yk youtube channel makes sense for me it makes sense so i'm here and i'm super happy thank you so much for inviting me probably something that has nothing to do with what i want to do in my life for example something i don't know against being a developer advocate probably i will not accept that even if it's a good job so i this is how i my brain works and for now i'm super super happy of the of the results yeah and to follow up on that like how did you discover what you want to do with your life did you like ask yourself write down some stuff or is it something you knew this is a this is a great great question so usually i find what i want to do with my life while i walk so this and i work a lot so i tend to think a lot i remember when i it was 2000 i think i never said this or maybe just once in 2015 i was still a volleyball coach and but i wanted to start a bit of the development of stepping in tech so i started working on uh on the on the beach like 20 kilometers 30 kilometers per day and he said okay but does it make sense for me trying to step into tech i am 32 almost a 33 does it make sense or not but i've always loved the computers i always love the math science even my job has always been something which has to do with sports so it's hard but usually i do the right choice because once i make a choice i always go in that direction so it required many kilometers we can say even starting with the youtube channel for example the idea of my podcast talking with by the way i've also interviewed the vacationless plug on my youtube channel there is uh the peeping the the video with him and i've decided to make this becoming a thing because at the beginning it was just a random video posted it is it's a it was a video call so working helps me a lot not just for a workout but also for the brain cool um yeah i think uh one thing i wanted to ask you personally just was kind of curious is like you know you put out i feel like you put yourself kind of out there on twitter like in a good way like you know you put a lot of pictures and like short videos like sometimes i see you you know commenting on somebody else's tweet like with a short video just kind of you know making a video of yourself like yes you want to ask me about this though yeah like yeah i mean it's yeah i guess it's about probably about why and part about like how did you become like you know more open like that um okay the truth is that when i am at home i type a lot so usually when i go for a walk i want to relax my fingers so sometimes i reply with the video so usually now people will find out about francesco you were at home when we posted video okay but in 90 percent of the cases that i want to relax my fingers when i walk so i tend to just make videos and i also think that it's uh it's an interesting way like to to surprise someone for example if someone makes like a genuine comment maybe i've done already seen a couple of the comments i think it's funny like you you reply to someone like i don't know i like i like these maybe they go with the following up questions and they just say yes already no so it's uh it's a bit it's a way to surprise and also yeah i think it's a it's a great way to find some genuine connections i think i found now i don't i can't remember names but i think i found some genuine connections that started like that like with me doing like this kind of short short video video replies you can say so it's uh but i don't do this off always it's not like a strategy sometimes i just start making this usually when i start i start replying to to everyone in this way i'm sorry but uh that's it cool yeah i feel like it's that's something i i should learn more you know to do like kind of you know using pictures videos you know people relate to that i understand um i think we can take one more question and then we can close this visual twitter space um so i can't see the original comment but the question was from suho and uh he was asking like how to continue a conversation like you know he was saying like i would say like three or four sentences and then like maybe he would experience like some silence so like any thoughts on that a conversation doesn't last just once you can start a conversation after also the day after i don't know there is not like a fixed amount first of all on social media maybe that person has something to do in their life they have to work so i would always be super relaxed on social media if you send a dm they don't reply don't get it personally i mean don't get personally even hating comments but if you don't get a reply it's not that person is bad but maybe they didn't check twitter or maybe they they do something else maybe they have the activated notifications can also be a good idea so a conversation goes for months years not just one day i mean it's totally totally okay so it's totally fine probably if i can say this if the other person doesn't want to to to keep going with the conversation maybe it's like you so maybe you have something in common that you don't want to have as i said before like long and meaningless conversation so maybe this can also be a good sign that you are finding a friend so maybe you can send a very honest like how are you the day after and if they want to start to keep going talking with you it's okay otherwise it's not an issue so i'll be i think that uh if you're an introvert you have you feel like that everybody is watching at you everybody is uh like doing something because you did something but the truth is that the substitute is that most of the people are just busy doing doing their stuff that's the sad truth what do you think okay yeah i feel like that's that's good advice it's not about you it's it's about the other person probably um and to you know to add to this question and answer i you know i agree with your approach um but also like kind of tactically i think it's it takes practice to be able to like continue a conversation like if you want to uh so one thing that helps is like you know keeping a good balance of basically questions and you know statements or nonquestions like if if someone just like asks you like too many questions it feels like an interview you might not be pleasant so you need to like ask the right amount of questions and then you know ex like kind of tell them about your experiences and like your your thoughts too and then kind of going to go from there to like asking questions you know related to those two yeah uh i think you are really on point and i think that also to start a journey connection i would not start a conversation just asking stuff i think this is the worst way to start uh a friendship like uh like i don't know nice to meet you okay can you retweet my stuff so this is the worst way maybe you can lose a friendship because if it's okay so this person just so always try to help with the first one or else especially if you reach out and that's it and then you will see and i mean we don't have to be all compatible 100 we have different different cultures we have different countries different languages i mean so but this is the the good of being like so different cultures that we can stay together and communicate in uh in some some ways find some points of interest uh which are in common please retweet my tweet okay and franchise okay why bother you you understand nothing you got nothing or maybe you are very you're very funny yeah i think i think this person's being pretty funny i mean yeah it's funny please retweet my tweet five five sorry i i'm not gonna try to um pronounce your name but yeah so thank you everyone for being here uh do you have any final thoughts francesco yeah the final thoughts is that uh if you're an introvert but also an extrovert don't force yourself but i i'm sure that there are people who want to use social media but it's not just about social media but finding connections genuine connections so finding a job and you can do all of these by using social media in a meaningful way and i always say that it's better to focus on the very long run i'm super surpr to be honest okay i'm super surprised of the like the people following me i would expect way way less attraction because i'm really here for the long run staying here for decades until i so it's it's very important to focus on the long run and maybe people are are feeling this like that i'm here just talk with my friends general connections and and that's it good luck everyone if you want to establish tuning connections start by giving instead of asking please and yes go always go on quality okay on content we can have a discussion if it's better quality or quantity for connections always go on quality it's better to have four friends it's better to have 10 friends that having many many people just saying uh thank you randomly so it's very very important to even if you are on social media social media are not the real world don't get take a follow or unfollow like people want to kill you or get or marry you it's just about finding some connections and we should be very relaxed and if you want to get started always think in baby steps and for me what has been really a game changer it has been accepted accepting my nature so if you accept who you are nobody can hurt you so it's you can really be yourself talk in front of a camera talk in front of a person it's all about practice it will be been very hard for me two years ago doing what i'm doing now talking just in front of a camera i don't know many people are here but this can really uh something can you can achieve i don't know okay what happened but uh it's something that you can get used to for sure good luck everyone and thank you okay for inviting me yeah thank you francesco and uh in who official graham says great stream it's graham now people are forgetting his logo because this was his logo yeah uh he says thanks for this moving pictures face i don't know what he means this is a youtube stream no it's a moving picture twitter space it means yeah i know i'm just kidding yeah uh yeah thank you thank you for being here um i was gonna say if if anyone's interested in like social media getting started with social media twitter spaces maybe youtube streams you know coming onto this channel too uh feel free to tweet at me at spacey's dojo it's it's my third account people think it's ridiculous how i have a lot of accounts cut but you know that's that's how i can manage my notifications i don't know how you do it francesco no to be honest i don't understand how you can manage three accounts so i am one of those people who thinks that this is crazy but i'm sorry yeah yeah it's it's funny like it works for me you know it's like you say like i accept my nature my nature is to run through your accounts your next choice is right yeah one of four i mean it's uh it's okay no yes and yes i'm joking and uh i think that it will be to be great to have a serious of course uh i think also that the best way to collaborate with me or okay instead of sending like you know at the end when you ask for stuff ask to do stuff ask to retweet stuff it's way better than
