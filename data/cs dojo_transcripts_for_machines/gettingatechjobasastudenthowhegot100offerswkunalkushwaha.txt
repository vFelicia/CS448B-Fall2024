all right uh we're live i'm just gonna assume that you know people can hear us and we'll just get right into it so now welcome and do you mind introducing yourself yeah yeah i'm kunal kushwa and i um oh what do i do i recently graduated from india um new delhi um normal bachelor's computer science around first week of july i am an open source enthusiast i am a content creator i'm active in a lot of communities i love teaching i love going to conferences organizing events things like that i work as a developer advocate at cbo which is a cloud resource provider and um yeah i mean i just graduated last week so around like around somewhere last last week so i'm still adjusting to the graduate graduate like uh like life and have some have some exciting things planned for my future so yeah hopefully uh i'll answer some of your questions yeah looking forward to it thanks for having me like appreciate it yeah i appreciate you uh being here um and you know our time is uh limited so let's you know let's let's see how many questions we can get through but i think i want to start with the job that you just mentioned as a developer advocate at sibo you got that job as a student right yeah if i remember correctly it was it was last year may yeah last year me so then one year i started as an intern i worked throughout my like junior and scene area at ceo and i'll be joining full time yeah nice um yeah i think we there's a lot we can talk about there you know the first natural question is how did you get that job um so i actually actually got a google internship in north america and uh then what happened was all the offers were revoked because they were not hiring people because of code so i made a post about it it got 40 000 likes on linkedin and around 3 million views so a lot of people started reaching out like oh you have a great profile and whatever uh would you like to interview with us and all the all these other things and then during that time i got in the mlh fellowship which is a good experience contributed to facebook open source um that was nice and then um i was sort of like looking for a like a company sort of experience and not like a like a open source program for students sort of thing i just wanted to see how how that goes so i i i just i was just i just made some tweets and stuff and people reached out and um then you know we got on a call and it and it happened yeah nice so yeah social media and like reference and open source yeah cool um okay stepping back for a minute how did you get the google internship or how did you get the initial offer i i just applied online uh on the portal with a referral i actually did a podcast with my google recruiter also there she mentioned everything about how the code situation messed things up and stuff but it was a good experience i learned from the interview process and got good feedback so that was good um but nothing nothing really special i did i just applied on the portal with a with a referral gave my interviews i think there was an online coding round and then phone screen and then two three coding rounds if i remember correctly um and then in the end there's a project tool section and that's the end stage um so i just applied normally with a reference that's it nice um i think i actually want to step back even more how did you get your first you know paid job or how did you make your first dollar as a student oh um at the end of my freshman year i um i i started volunteering at local programming boot camps as like teaching assistant india has a big tech culture of like tech startups so i just uh i i started doing internships there i don't know how much i got paid it was around uh 350 bucks for two months um so yeah that's how i started i sort of like gained a lot of experience in indiana startups that's why i'm really good at teaching so i know the ins and outs and about how these guys work and what makes them special what why people buy their courses so i worked at these startups for like a few months and then i got into like open source mostly like google summer of code and then um linux foundation programs and mlh fellowship then i worked at mlh for one year something i was in the core team actually reviewed the most mls fellowship applications and interviews coding interviews that i did around 3000 plus so great great program not a plug but genuinely if you are looking for something all these programs are nice but yeah that's basically about it right yeah and like no no again even back no yeah nah nah i think i think i think we're all good i'm just kidding yeah um yeah i was gonna say you know i think sometimes people miss that you need to start where you can um i remember you know you know sort of my first paid job as as a student was like a minimum basically like a minimum a paid job as a you know math tutor and yeah that's all i could get and that's it you know that's that's exp but the experience counts you get to teach a class i remember there was a class of like 60 people and sometimes they sometimes they let me like teach entire lectures also which was nice and i definitely got a lot of teaching skills out of it if not a lot of money yeah i think the experience counts it's something you can put on your resume and that's how everyone starts and yeah i think i can you know i can start going backwards now how did you get that you know google summary of code internship and like do you have any advice for people who want that yeah gsoc is not that difficult to get into so it's an internship alternative by google you contribute to open source projects some of the largest ones in the world around i think 200 plus organizations take part so in my freshman year when i was starting out i thought gsoc was a really big thing firstly because the price price was like the stipend was a lot for an indian student i think around 3000 bucks and then um and then uh my college seniors and everyone on youtube they were saying oh google summer code do it you'll get a job at google oh it's the best thing you can do for your career very difficult to get into and then i sort of like did not know about it that much i just i was actually looking for open source projects to contribute to because i attended an event in new delhi and there i learned about open source and i just started contributing to the kubernetes java client by red hat middleware and i just started with some documentation and then some so simple code changes and things like that and then the people the maintainers are like hey we are participating with some of code check it out and then i applied and i got selected in my freshman year itself with red hat middleware working on kubernetes java client so really big project not at all like simple pretty complex code base but i learned on the go ask good questions and worked a lot hard you know waka time uh no so waka time is like it manages your keystrokes and it tells you how much hours you have quoted so during my gsoc period i was world rank 8 on that i did a lot i did a lot of coding i start i finished my gsoft project in like um in like a more than one and a half months and it's like a two three month long period so it's a good experience i i i remember still now how hard i work for that um but it was a rewarding experience because then i got into into this field and um gsoc was i think like even if you do open source contributions without gshock in these programs it's still beneficial you can still put it in your resume if you have a good pr merged or whatever i think that's fine um you don't have to be like um it's not like i only need to do gsoc in order to contribute to open source that's not the case yeah but i got in it was a fun and then i didn't do it again i i mentored in the same organization red hat for two years for google summer code and one year for google coding cool um yeah i'm not surprised you know based on what you said that you got a google summer code because you were already doing open source work and then you basically just needed to say i'm already doing this and i can continue doing this right yeah that's what that's what that's like a best practice you want to get selected in gsoc um try to start early maintainers would prioritize students who are active contributors yeah makes sense um yeah and how did you go from that to the next step you know juice out to the next thing yeah after that um i think after that a few months after that after that i got to attend kubecon on a scholarship right after gsoc because my projects for projects were related to k8 so i got a scholarship by the linux foundation i went to san diego um that was fun met folks at kubecon attended the contributor summit at kubecon um and then sort of like mls fellowship happened and then i got involved in the cncf i'm a cncm ambassador um and i feel really blessed to be a part of this community and be recognized in this community when i was at kubecon last like in may in in spain um all the big big minds in tech and the big big faces of cloud native they were like you know they're coming up to me and they're like oh canal appreciate the work you do a great youtube channel great vlogs and things like that um so it has been amazing and uh it's just that you could you do good work in public you get recognized um it's very very amazing journey yeah then covet came oh yeah it's cool yeah it was like just at home yeah nothing yeah yeah yeah yeah it's a whole different thing right all different things yeah and just quickly cncf that's cloud native right cloud native computing foundation yeah is that like a it's a foundation yeah it's an organization has uh has various members associated with it it has a lot of projects in it so companies choose to donate their projects to the cncf um like cuban it is was donated by by google in 2014 so it's a relatively new new tech so companies choose to do that there's an entire cncf landscape um that you can look at which has a lot of projects categorized um i spoke at kubecon as a student speaking at kubecon 23 times i i just could not ask have asked for a better better career yeah yeah yeah that's that's that's a lot that you've done um i think i want to ask you more about like time management but first of all you know going back again um you can talk about it yeah yeah yeah good but yeah before that i think um some people have asked me like how do you deal with a big code base when you start you know contributing to open source because you know it might be pretty like overwhelming for beginners yeah that's a good point um you don't have to know the entire code base um the the the most the biggest mistake that students make is they look they find a project to contribute to they look at the code base they feel overwhelmed and then they leave they're like oh this won't i can't work with this if you just google um fabricate i o q as java client that is a project i contributed to in freshman year if you check that right now check the code base overwhelming for someone who is a student and who does not like who's just starting out with coding i think instead of running from it it's a good thing that you find a founder project like this this is a little bit of a controversial opinion but i believe that in the student community there is no such thing as imposter syndrome what is impossible syndrome impossible means i don't know i don't know something and they know something people i work with correct is that what imposter syndrome is like i don't know something and people know something right you feel like you lack knowledge or whatever i think impossible basically instead of that you should look at it i'm a very optimistic person i try to find silver lining in everything so i think with the with this scenario it's like i know something else and they are working on something else so i'm not denying that the existence of impostor syndrome but i'm saying that it's a good thing in the student community because if you're just a student you're just starting out no one expects you to know stuff that much if you're a student you're just starting out you don't know what cuban it is no one would be surprised so if you find yourself in a place where you see a project or a contribution or whatever and you don't know much about the tech stack that's a great thing for you as a student because you'll get to learn and contribute now right what if someone gave you a job all you have to do is implement binary search just implement binary search that's it for it for six hours a day would that be really beneficial to you no learn something new go out of your comfort zone your college years are all about exploring and um one thing folks have to realize when they see big code bases it's not going to happen overnight it will take a few months clone this clone the repository run it on your local system look at the test cases look at the architecture of the project how the things are working what are the various components if it's a huge code base it's like divided into modules and packages um check out good first issues the maintainers can help you guide you towards like a particular package or whatever so you don't have to know the entire code base in order to contribute yeah thank you for that i feel like that's you know that's that's a that's like a big question and you know it could easily be like a separate video too yeah yeah and you know if if you could like share your screen kind of walk through some of your like workflow you know you're welcome to do that too but yeah what workflow of github oh like you know like an example of like say a beginner is looking at a new open source project they're overwhelmed oh yeah okay yeah i can do that um let me just hide a few things yeah sounds good no just it's a slack company slack oh yeah no worries and some some announcements i haven't made yet all right um and okay can you see my github yes so um actually summer of code with google.com is a great website to find open source projects you don't have to do gsoc but you can check out the um organizations you want to contribute to so like you can search let's say okay i want to contribute to java as i just search for java and you will find projects that you can that use java how cool is that this is like a really big list you can see 110 projects just 110 organizations for java and every single organization would have their own like projects number of projects so like big big ones chromium is there so many my jboss would also be here rocket chat would is here somewhere you'll find your sef is here for storage open ways post grade so you get the idea and you can also filter from here so this is a great resource to find open source projects apart from that um you can check out cncf slash mentoring we also have some projects if you want to contribute to open source and cncf cncf there has their own landscape uh here you can see cncf landscape but these are all individual projects i can get a little bit overwhelming to like navigate these but i suppose i spoke at cubecon at a panel on navigating the cncf landscape but putting us on track if i just give an example of the project i contributed to only um where is it so this one right um what what you can do is first of all like clone it or whatever fork it and read the documentation run it on your local system check out the test cases things like that and check out the beginner friendly issues go to issues and check out good first issue labels should be having it somewhere here good first issue right now there's one but this is a good example because if you don't find good first issues on github you can join the mailing list or slack community or whatever they're using they are using um what are they using gator so you can join gita uh i'm not saying this to join this project i'm just giving an example and then you can put hey i'm beginner do you have any beginner friendly issues i can contribute to or whatever and just follow the community guidelines don't spam anyone um as you can see this is the project i contributed to and it's really overwhelming like as a student this does not make any sense to many people but um if you want to check my pr's you can go to closed pr's author naal kushwaha so as you can see this particular example that i it's very how i started so just some refractoring that's it and some documentation and refracting stuff see nothing major and from that i started with like um adding tests and uh adding support for new resources so this is like the big contribution type thing obviously took me some while around 10 000 lines of changes lot of java code here so it takes time but i showed you um you know how basic stuff i started with um so yeah it takes time take your time um is what i'd recommend yeah nice um yeah i think you know coming back to this question again the thing beginners see when they see a big code base is this like this big chunk of code and they're like oh you know there there's so much stuff going on like do do i read this file yeah and ask questions break it down yeah they might feel like they need to kind of read the whole thing or uh whatever i think that's that's what you know that's that's where this question is coming from yeah no it is a it's a valid question thanks for asking that whoever asked yeah um all right let's let me ask you about time management then because it seems like you've done a lot like a lot of internships open source school work supposedly um so like how do you manage all of those um i think i think time management is it's it's like a lot of discipline comes with it but um you have to see what your priorities are um i am not the best person for time management because i have burnt out pretty badly in the past um the the the thing students specifically if you're talking about them what they struggle with is managing college and all these other things right um i think college plays a big role in it some call some colleges take a lot of your time um mandatory lectures um like you have to attend 75 of all the lectures and then you have to um you know do some assignments and all these other things um and why k i'm not saying like good assignments in india they are like they will give you a sheet right and they will say copy this sheet it's 10 pages in a book just copy it that's what the kind of assignments we get not like here's an interesting question solve it no just copy pasting so you have to like work accordingly to save your time um i think koh it sort of like helped a little bit with this giving students a little bit more time that they were you know things were remote classes were remote so they could do whatever they wanted um but you have a time management it's important to prioritize your tasks isn't this a thing i i recommend you checking out eisenhoer metrics um have you heard of it yk no what is it i i think it's called eisenhore metrics you can google it and share your screen so basically the idea is that there are four quadrants um urgent not urgent important not not important so something that lies in not important and not urgent i will just not do it something that is important but not urgent i will schedule it for the future something that is important and urgent i'll do it asap and also it's important to say no like learn how to say no i would love to help out i would love to answer all your questions on all your dms but i would love to make all the courses that i taught in tech companies but it's just that because almost time takes it takes so much time and um it's not like i'm asking you from for like money that i owe you stuff so you have to learn how to say no and make sure you don't burn out take care of your health and um prioritize your tasks the one thing with time management as a student was that i i follow a pie shape or tshaped learning whatever you want to call it know everything about something something about everything um i did not focus that much as a student on being an expert i don't call myself an expert like right now even um i'll try to get some more certifications or whatever um now that i've graduated but i focused a lot more on applying the things that i've learned that i'm learning um it be that with devops or like web dev or um machine learning whatever um contribute to your projects created a course on it or whatever um gave a webinar contacted a conference event wrote a blog so i think as a student that was very rewarding for me because as a student no one expects you to be an expert they expect you to have an open mind and have the willingness to learn um but yeah so i think yeah that's basically about it um don't be stuck in tutorial hell and manage your time well um apply whatever you're learning yeah yeah uh thank you for that i think saying no is pretty big for a lot of people you know even yeah a lot yeah i remember even you know among students on twitter in particular i see people saying oh yeah sorry yeah i'm not gonna post stuff for a while but you know i always say like never apologize for not posting free stuff it's free in the beginning anyway it's it's it's free and that's that's the whole point plus i don't think there is a lack of resources i just think there's a lack of how to find resources good resources yeah you can learn anything you want online everything yeah yeah true um okay and i'm i'm curious like you know you mentioned burnout what was he like how did it happen how did you get out of it it happened when i started creating my boot camps uh that dac boot camp stuff a single video so i can say this even confidently right now the the course is ongoing but the topics i have covered till now like the complete recursion playlist objectoriented programming and all the java stuff that i have covered according to me and apparently a thousand students um that content content wise and quality wise it is not available on youtube period but uh the thing is that the reason for that is i've done a lot of research and i always say to people don't trust me when i say this you watch it yourself and then you're the one to decide um the thing is that with burnout a single video is like too indepth it's more than it should be and it takes me an entire day to create one data structures video and that's when i went out pretty pretty pretty badly because i work at co as well so that's obviously my priority and um and and yeah i started just focusing on my my mental health and my personal wellbeing and my career as compared to other people because i did not have a canal when i was in college so why do you need one uh if that makes sense right um i see all these amazing people who are getting jobs and students contributing to open source going to events around the world they're not watching my content why can't you do it then right and this is what bugs me with most content creators they're like oh follow me and i'm i will help you or whatever i am saying don't be dependent on me leave me alone i'm very busy if you have a question go join a community or join a community based on whatever tech stack you like ask questions in public or whatever so in the end i'm helping you only by making you realize that you don't need to be dependent on one person i know my course is amazing i know it's the best but i i also need to prioritize my health having said that i'll complete it don't worry because i need subscribers as well and i know once i create complete the dsa bootcamp and machine learning i'll cross a million very soon so i obviously want a million subscribers on youtube so i'll complete it don't worry yeah you know i totally relate to that especially with like data structures and algorithms you know i made a bunch of videos on those it takes a lot of time to make each one of time yeah and sometimes i think people don't realize how much work it takes you know just like preparing editing the video recording all of that it's like now that i've graduated there are two communities i can focus on one is the student community and one is the more professional community so my experience with the student community outside india like in the mls fellowship i had i was a pod leader in the mls fellowship for the facebook's production engineering track so i mentored students who are in the u.s time zone some of the best students i've met in my life i love them great people but whenever i interacted with someone who was here in india i don't i don't want to say i don't want to generalize it but it it's just not the quality is not there both in terms of the questions and the way people perceive it it's like so many toxicities here in the community you can't share about your salary people will look down on you you can't share about the good work you do in public people will think you're boasting on the other hand the same cultural difference outside india is like learn in public be open about it discuss your salary with your employer so that sort of like made me realize that okay why should i care if the community is so weird like i'm gonna focus more on things that reward me which is professionals so that's why i started cube world where i'm doing more and more devops content on my channel more and more devops related podcasts going to events like i'm speaking at devops world this year in florida container days i'm going to devops days in israel um kubecon um i was speaking at kct berlin so yeah that's sort of like my priority because i my priority for me is my career um and uh i'm helping the student community with um with the way i can like i'm giving you all funds for kubecon travel so we're having scholarship fun like we will be covering your flights and hotels so i'm doing that good community work um i'm coming up with a open source initiative like google summer of course sort of a thing that will help you i'm doing nice podcast nice devops related content so if i as a student can teach you these things and about these communities then can you as a student not consume this content um but again you are not missing out on anything because i am not the end of the world please stop thinking like that get involved in communities and you will get all your answers don't be dependent on me you can consume the content that i'm posting but you are in no place to request no to totally get there and i think it's good that you're prioritizing yourself but at the same time you know you're you're doing your best to help students and hopefully this you know this live stream is part of that yeah okay uh so another common question i got for you you know from twitter is how do you motivate yourself because you know there's there's a lot of stuff going on yeah um motivate doesn't like uh how do you motivate yourself to do like all this open source work and kind of you know your job at the same time college work all of that yeah college is over thankfully um motivation with me comes with um i'm not a huge believer in motivation um and it does not mean you should not be okay it's a very individual person thing so don't take my word for that um i'm i mostly focus on action items starting from my freshman year i had i had a notes list in that i divided i created eight columns first time second sims hurts them till eight sim and then in every column i listed down some goals um and then i sort of like uh wanted to make sure i'm on the right track so i took guidance from people who are active in the global community also in india there's a lot of discrimination so i sort of like identified those discriminations and was away from it like okay i don't want to do that um and then with the motivation part it's just like you know um as a student i needed a job you know needed to pay my bills uh have a good life travel around the world to do things i like and and stuff like that so that's what sort of like the motivation for me like okay i need a career i need to support my family or whatever it has been amazing journey and i owe it to open source and the people in the community who have like shared about the their experiences or whatever so you can call it motivation if you want but for me it was more like a plan um yeah yeah thank you for that um you know i think like making money is a big motivation for a lot of people because people need money right what yeah what's wrong with that yeah nothing wrong with that yeah it's it's so weird when people say when you say that i'm in for the money and then some people call you out oh you are in tech for money not good shut up it's totally fine if someone is doing that i to be quite frank money is not the priority for me i've turned down offers worth two hundred thousand us dollars and more um because i know that in case things don't work out with what i'm doing right now i'm i am capable all i need to do is send one message and i'll have a job um so i know that i'm capable so money is not always the driving factor if it is for you great for me it's second priority i mean the first priority right now is doing extraordinary things which is why startups nice uh by the way i think we have 14 minutes left um no worries yeah thank you you know really appreciate you being here again uh i see everyone in the chat thank you everyone for being here and hello everyone um yeah i think another common question i get is how do you go from doing open source work to getting a job from it or like how do you or is it even the right way to look at it or should you you know should people just like contribute to open source because it's something they can learn from and then not expect a job from it um i think if you're doing open source to get a job that's 100 fine and i recommend doing that um it's totally cool um there are many companies who offer fulltime roles that you need like a fulltime role is actually contributing to open source um even at sibo we do a lot of open source work uh collaborating with open source projects with the marketplace app um community collaborations business collaborations so open source is supporting businesses as well and if you're doing it to get a job or your aim is to get a job via open source as a student yeah you're on the right track go for it because there you have proof of work you know you have your code base online available you make connections so most of the people who are contributing to open source obviously work at companies so they can refer you or they can hire you in your own company that's sort of like how i got an offer from red hat also i contributed to fabricate io and i got an offer um um from from red hat at the end of my sophomore year so they did not hire second year students but they made an exception for me i did not take that because i did the mls fellowship then but um but yeah um definitely you can get roles by open source especially remote rules as well because your proof of work matters quite a lot so to answer your question why okay yeah if you're doing it for jobs or internships yeah no worries keep up it keep it up cool um all right i think we're getting some questions about yeah let's do rapid fire yeah um we're getting some questions about like content creation tips for beginners um yeah like how how do you how do you grow on twitter and youtube so twitter is um i think there's there's already a lot of content uh shout out to eddie francisco i have i've lost count on how many how many spaces and videos they have done on this particular topic so you can you can yk does twitter spaces yk has some threads uh on how to grow on twitter so we won't like bore you with that but um with youtube though um i gained zero to 100 in three months um i think for me it was word of mouth and it was because of my gestures course people were starting getting jobs after watching the videos and purely it was word of mouth to be more specific i utilized my my network linkedin twitter youtube like just posting really good content um i think if you post great content you would not have difficulty in growing on youtube definitely also if there's content out on something already you can still make content on that topic people don't watch what you do they watch how you do it there are i don't know 100 plus dsa courses on youtube and every day i get requests from please complete yours please complete yours um because people are addicted to the way that you teach at a particular point of time so be extremely good at what you do and second route is you don't have to be really good at what you do you can just do like share your experiences do podcasts or whatever um get some interesting people on your channel um noncode like if you don't code so like you know i don't code i can't teach does it mean i can't have a youtube channel no that's not true you can get other people on your channel uh they can share their experiences you can create value um yeah but just if you provide value you will grow that's a very simple statement yep um thanks for that and yeah i'll try to you know go through some some more questions and this one is how do you stay motivated while coding habit now like i like doing it so um i think if you enjoy something yeah i enjoy learning new things so i i was able to grasp a lot of fields um because i like like to learn yeah yeah i think uh it's it's important to find something you like to you know because when when this person says coding it's it could be anything could be anything yeah you know they might not like one aspect of coding but if they try something else they might like it so it's probably important to try different things yeah yeah um yeah so you know we've been going for like 40 minutes how are you feeling yeah i'm feeling good we have eight more minutes so i'm happy to answer questions in the chat sure uh let me take this one what's uh developer advocate role like in general yeah i won't tell you like the definition part but um if you like if you like communities if you like like content creation if you like engaging with people uh you can get into a devel role it's it's it's not marketing that's the wrong term it's more like building connections and trust so there are two rules to develop advocacy one is the internal developer advocacy within your team and one is the outward developer advocacy you have to work with both um day to day load look something like you know maintaining open source projects uh documentation um going to events staffing the event booth um creating content um community feedback surveys um maintaining open source projects i mentioned mentioned that already um i think most developer advocates like at least in startups the the role is a little bit more like um it's not like just just dedicated at least at you know like cbo we have advocates who also do like other work like coding related like more more of the development related stuff they help but i'll help out in these things i haven't worked in a big tech company i don't know how that functions uh internally but uh startups give you much more flexibility so if you like you know um advocating about technology um demoing products um creating content documentation meant open source um yeah you can you can try a developer advocacy yeah all right uh let's just go to the next one how to get a remote job this is like a big question but yeah let's let's try it that's a good question um the first thing is you have to be skilled and because when you reach out to someone they will look at your profile they will ask you some questions or whatever so be skilled um have have something to showcase projects github personal portfolio whatever you want and then just reach out to people that's first step um in my case people will reach out to you if you do great things but don't take me into consideration because i i am like now popular like on social so you you get it you know you reach up if someone so many people know you and you've been active in the community you get roles and i'm i'm not denying that i've gotten quite a lot because of it um but for an app like a person who's not that active on socials um have a good portfolio at least a developer portfolio uh reach out to people um go to events and conferences their network with people check out the project boards many companies have their own project boards you can check that out apply directly from there if you find someone who works at that company you can take a referral and uh that's it yeah cool um that's pretty simple and yeah just wanted to quickly mention you know building a social media presence it's not that hard to be honest honestly anyone can do it so it's not that hard but yeah it's not that hard but over my course of college i found two people right two types of people one who are really good at social media and get jobs one who are really good at development and get jobs um both are good whatever works for you go ahead because as a student people would expect you to be openminded and learn new things so you have that time to you know explore and build yourself but yeah always be up for trying new things yeah yeah personally i've done both so i i can definitely speak to that okay let's actually and do the last question okay i'm just looking for you know for the comment here but the question was uh how do you get better at reading other people's code faster it also depends on the the the other person to be quite frank um i remember there was a guy in the fellowship his variable names were like so big you read the variable name you would know what it does so i think i think just just practice you can review code um that would help you ask questions and just you know we can go we can do another session on code qualities and code reviews shout out to sema by the way matt he has some great content on code reviews um i did a session with him also on code reviews on my youtube channel actually so um you can check that out yeah yeah i i sort of have a quick comment about this you know it takes practice you know open source is a really good way to practice that it takes a lot of patience to you know sometimes you can just try different things like you know obviously clone your clone the repo try you know change different things to see what happens you can do those things but ultimately it's about like being patient reading sometimes you need to read line by line uh and you need to break things down you know you need to ask yourself like do you understand this line what about this line what about this line uh if you take it slowly you know people should be able to get it yeah couldn't agree more all right uh any last words um no just there are millions of developers in the world so everyone has a different roadmap so please stop asking questions like you know what's a road map just follow all the good all the good practices work hard you are very privileged that you work in tech or you are studying tech or you want to get a job in tech because there are so many opportunities you can you can get remote jobs you can join inperson jobs if you don't get a job you can have your own business you can freelance if you don't want a job there's so many things you can do if you just have the right skills so take advantage of it and good luck and ask questions in public leave me alone yeah i totally agree with that i think asking questions in public is kind of underrated you know especially on twitter you can just tweet a question tag a bunch of people and like even before you ask you can search on twitter too you know yeah obviously on twitter google youtube use all the search you can use and then you should be able to find something like before you you know like ask yourself yeah really yeah all right uh thank you so much for being here canal i think you need to go and uh thank you everyone for being here too and i see all the chats obviously we can't respond to everything but really appreciate everything here but but now you know where to ask your questions so you can get those answers yeah all right all right thanks everyone
