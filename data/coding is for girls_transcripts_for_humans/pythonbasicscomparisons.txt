00:00 - hello everyone I'm Ola and this is
00:02 - coding is for girls we already know how
00:18 - to represent data in Python using
00:20 - example in types but what if we want to
00:23 - do different things depending on the
00:26 - value stored in the variable for example
00:29 - if you want to display a different
00:30 - message depending on the person's name
00:33 - or using the language the person is
00:36 - speaking so what I want to show you
00:38 - today is how to compare things okay so
00:41 - let's open console and try some basic
00:44 - comparisons the first thing that comes
00:48 - to mind is obviously comparing numbers
00:50 - let's type five is greater than 2 and
00:54 - press Enter
00:55 - it's true now let's try free lower than
00:59 - 1 this is false what about something
01:02 - more complicated then like 5 is greater
01:05 - than 2 multiple to this is true the
01:10 - values we are getting here when we
01:12 - compare things in python are called
01:15 - billions and they could be either true
01:17 - or false
01:18 - if you studied anything connected to
01:20 - logic I think it should ring the bell
01:22 - and please note that in Python when we
01:25 - write true or false we always start with
01:28 - a capital letter and the rest is
01:31 - lowercase so only these forms are true
01:34 - or false or correct and anything else
01:37 - like true lowercase or having capital
01:41 - case somewhere in between or all capital
01:44 - cases is incorrect
01:46 - ok let's experiment a little bit more
01:48 - what if we want to check if things are
01:51 - equal to each other
01:52 - like one equals one okay that's true if
01:59 - you wonder why we use here a double
02:01 - equal sign instead of single one this is
02:05 - because we already use the single equal
02:07 - sign to something else assigning
02:10 - variables if you watch my previous video
02:13 - about Python basics you know that we use
02:16 - the single equal sign to assign things
02:19 - to variables and because it has so
02:22 - important meaning in Python already we
02:25 - cannot use that for comparing things too
02:27 - that's why when we want to compare if
02:29 - two things are equal to each other we
02:31 - cannot used a single equal sign and
02:34 - Python use double equal sign instead and
02:38 - please note that you cannot put space in
02:42 - between two equal signs let's try what
02:45 - would happen if we try that we're
02:48 - getting syntax error so it is not
02:51 - something fighten understands okay so
02:53 - what is still missing is checking that
02:56 - two values are not equal to each other
02:58 - and we do that with exclamation mark and
03:02 - equal sign so we do that like this v
03:06 - naught equals two okay what if we want
03:10 - to check if one side is greater and
03:12 - equal or lower and equal than other side
03:16 - to do that we simply use lower or
03:19 - greater sign followed with equal sign
03:22 - like this three is lower or equal to or
03:26 - six is greater or equal six so to sum up
03:30 - when we compare numbers we can use one
03:33 - of the following signs in a use crater
03:35 - sign lower sign greater or equal sign
03:39 - lower or equal sign equal sign which is
03:43 - a double equal sign in Python or not
03:47 - equal which is exclamation mark and
03:49 - equal sign if you know a little bit
03:51 - about boolean algebra or logic you are
03:55 - probably familiar with boolean
03:57 - operations what's that if you think
03:59 - about numbers you can do number of
04:02 - operations like adding two numbers
04:04 - obstructing multiplying and so far well
04:08 - we have something similar for boolean
04:10 - values we have operation we can use and
04:13 - these operations are and or and not for
04:19 - the first operation and above left hand
04:22 - side and right hand side of the
04:24 - operation
04:25 - needs to be true to the whole sentence
04:28 - to be true okay let's have an example
04:31 - let's think about it us about sets let's
04:35 - say we have a group of people some of
04:37 - them speak English
04:38 - some Polish and there is also a group of
04:41 - people speaking English and polish if
04:44 - you would like to know who is speaking
04:46 - both English and polish would you use
04:48 - and operator so if we take Alice and we
04:51 - will check does the person speak English
04:54 - yes and if the person speaks polish that
04:58 - is also true so the result of this
05:01 - operation is true Alice speaks both
05:04 - English and polish but if we choose Bob
05:07 - and check if Bob speaks English yes and
05:12 - if Bob speaks polish no the end result
05:17 - is false Bob is not speaking of English
05:20 - and polish okay what we our operator
05:23 - then you probably suspect the answer we
05:26 - use or to check if one of the values is
05:29 - true for example we would like to know
05:32 - if the person either speaks English or
05:34 - polish in this scenario for both Alice
05:38 - and Bob this is true it is also true to
05:42 - Moorea who speaks only Polish finally we
05:46 - have not operator for example we can use
05:49 - that to check if Alice does not speak
05:53 - Polish this is not true for Alice but it
05:56 - is true for Bob okay time to see that in
06:00 - action in Python let's type true and
06:03 - false this is obviously false true or
06:08 - false it's true and not true is false
06:14 - in Python boolean operations are typed
06:17 - lowercase any other variation of lower
06:20 - and uppercase will basically result in
06:23 - name error like this so far we compared
06:27 - only numbers with each other and
06:29 - billions true and false values what if
06:32 - you want to compare for example text
06:35 - with number let's try it let's compare
06:37 - one with text Ranga we get a type error
06:42 - telling us that fightin cannot compare
06:45 - text with numbers in general the rule of
06:48 - the tongue is that Python cannot compare
06:50 - things with a different type however
06:53 - there are some exceptions for example if
06:57 - we compare one integer with one float
07:00 - this is true
07:02 - basically Python is pretty logical here
07:05 - if that makes sense to compare two
07:07 - values for example two numbers but one
07:10 - integer and float it does that but if
07:13 - there is absolutely no sense like
07:15 - comparing number with some random text
07:18 - then it rises error okay let's practice
07:22 - a little bit more we could use variables
07:25 - when comparing things let's assign true
07:27 - to variable a like this a is true or
07:32 - let's assign a result of comparison to
07:36 - the variable like this a assign two is
07:39 - greater than five and now a is false
07:43 - comparing things and billions are one of
07:47 - the most important things in programming
07:49 - so congratulations you just learn about
07:52 - them if it's still not super clear make
07:55 - sure to practice a little bit on your
07:57 - own for example you could try one of
07:59 - these lines here true and true false and
08:04 - true false or 1 2 or 1 equals 1 or 1 is
08:12 - not equal to and true and true and false
08:15 - this is quite a bit of knowledge today
08:18 - we learned that there is something like
08:20 - true and false in Python follows boolean
08:23 - algebra and we use that to compare
08:26 - things
08:27 - my next video I will show you how to use
08:30 - comparisons to do certain things only
08:33 - when the condition is met we will also
08:36 - learn how to create Python script and we
08:39 - run it without need to type every single
08:42 - time the very same thing in Python
08:44 - interpreter so if you want to learn more
08:47 - about programming and don't miss any of
08:50 - my further videos make sure to subscribe
08:53 - my channel and stay tuned have a nice
08:56 - day and see you
