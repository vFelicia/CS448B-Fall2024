00:00 - hello everyone I'm Ola and this is
00:03 - coding is for girls in my last video I
00:19 - talked about comparing values and I
00:21 - promised me that next time I will show
00:24 - you how to use that to gain better
00:26 - control over your script when you write
00:28 - program you often want to do certain
00:31 - steps only when certain criteria is met
00:33 - but before we do that I think it's
00:36 - useful to learn how to write longer
00:38 - Python script instead of writing one
00:41 - line at a time in Python interpreter
00:44 - this is where code editor will prove to
00:47 - be handy typically programs are saved
00:50 - and files that are then executed by
00:53 - compiler or interpreter so far we've
00:57 - been using quite an interpreter and
00:59 - typing one line at a time and see the
01:02 - result immediately so today instead of
01:05 - opening quite an interpreter
01:07 - we'll open code editor if you don't have
01:11 - an installed yet make sure to look at
01:13 - the video when I talked about installing
01:16 - fighting and code editor I'll open Adam
01:19 - since I decided to install this code
01:21 - editor but if you installed anything
01:24 - else follow the stuff encoded or of your
01:26 - choice we will create a new file and put
01:30 - some Python code there so let's start
01:33 - print hello world now we want to save
01:37 - the file and give it some descriptive
01:39 - name so it will be easier to find it
01:42 - when we want to execute our program
01:44 - let's call it fightin intro dot apply
01:48 - and save it on the desktop we can name
01:52 - the file anything you want but the
01:54 - important part here is to make sure
01:56 - their file ends with dot py the dot py
02:01 - extension tones operating system that
02:04 - the file is Python executable file and
02:07 - by the interpreter can run it ok we just
02:10 - run our very first Python program
02:13 - in a file and let's see how it run let's
02:16 - open our command line and go to the
02:19 - desktop where we have saved our python
02:21 - file so we do LS then CD desktop and LS
02:27 - now to run the python program we just
02:29 - wrote full type Python free space and
02:33 - the name of the file so python 3 fightin
02:36 - intro to 5 and click enter ok you just
02:39 - draw on your very first Python program
02:41 - and saved it into the file that's
02:43 - awesome
02:44 - you could leave console open for now we
02:47 - will run our python script again and
02:49 - again so it's good to have it open the
02:51 - most awesome thing about it is that we
02:53 - don't need to write everything over and
02:55 - over again instead we can open our file
02:58 - edit it save and when we're all ready we
03:02 - can run it in console ok time to learn
03:05 - some serious stuff very often you would
03:07 - like to do something only when certain
03:10 - condition is met for example in the real
03:13 - life you would like to know if the
03:15 - person is vegetarian or not before
03:17 - serving the meal that contains meat so
03:21 - we would have different option of meal
03:23 - depending on the person being vegetarian
03:25 - or not programming without checking if
03:28 - given condition is met wouldn't be
03:30 - possible so let's see how it's done in
03:32 - fightin fightin use the special
03:34 - construction to do that and it's called
03:37 - it statement what does it mean it means
03:40 - that Python have special keyword if that
03:43 - tells python that we are about to start
03:46 - to compare things
03:48 - ok so let's open our fight an intro file
03:51 - in our code editor and remove the first
03:53 - line let's type our if statement instead
03:56 - it will be if free is greater than 2 if
04:01 - you will save it now and run it in
04:03 - console who will get an error
04:05 - let's try python free Python intro it's
04:08 - syntax error item expects us to give it
04:11 - further instruction if the condition
04:14 - here are free is great in their tune is
04:16 - true ok let's fix it
04:18 - in Python intro file we will type the
04:21 - following in the second line of the file
04:24 - world type print
04:26 - it works what is important here is to
04:29 - notice that if statement has a certain
04:32 - format first we type if keyword then we
04:37 - type our condition whatever we want to
04:40 - check then there is a colon colon
04:43 - informs Python that we are about to
04:45 - start block of code this block will be
04:48 - executed only if the condition will be
04:51 - met the block is defined by indentation
04:54 - every following line that is indented is
04:57 - in the block we typically use for spaces
05:01 - so in our scenario our block will
05:04 - contain only print it works and this
05:07 - will indent it okay time to save the
05:09 - file and check if it works now we go
05:12 - back to console and run our Python
05:14 - program again - 3 fightin intro and hit
05:18 - enter
05:20 - now it was executed without errors
05:24 - and since our condition 3 is greater
05:26 - than 2 is true we have it works printed
05:30 - ok but what if we want to do one thing
05:33 - when the condition is met and another if
05:36 - it's not for that fightin comes with
05:39 - Elif and else statements let's edit our
05:42 - file if R is greater than 2 we will
05:45 - print 5 is indeed greater than 2 then we
05:49 - end the block for each statement and we
05:52 - do not indent anymore and type else and
05:55 - color as we already mentioned : means we
05:59 - are defining new block so next line will
06:02 - be indented with 4 spaces and we'll
06:05 - print 5 is not greater than 2 if you
06:08 - look at this code you will notice blocks
06:10 - much more clearly first block is
06:13 - executed only when if statement is true
06:17 - second is executed when if statement is
06:20 - false
06:20 - ok let's create something more sensible
06:23 - but we'll remove everything from the
06:26 - file and define variable name this time
06:29 - we would like to store the name for
06:31 - example Sonia in the variable we'll call
06:34 - it name and depending on the value of
06:37 - the name we'll decide what to do so
06:40 - let's say we want to say hi hola if the
06:44 - name is Ola hi Sonia if the name is
06:48 - Sonia and hey anonymous overwise
06:54 - we could use if-else statement for that
06:57 - but vitam provides something more handy
07:00 - and it's called a leaf it works a little
07:04 - bit like if but it must be put in
07:07 - between if and else okay let's say the
07:11 - action now that's executed in console
07:14 - Python free Python intro and we have hey
07:18 - Sonia because the name is Sonia what
07:21 - happens here is Parton first check the
07:24 - first line of the east statement so
07:27 - check if the name is Ola it's not Sonia
07:30 - so we skip the body for the first if
07:34 - statement and go to the next condition
07:36 - which is in a wave we check if the name
07:40 - is Sonia and it is indeed and we can
07:43 - execute the code in size so we print hey
07:47 - Sonia and then we can just ignore the
07:50 - rest what is important here is notice
07:52 - that we can only print hey Sonia if
07:55 - previous condition is not true you can
07:58 - add as many LF condition as you want and
08:02 - you don't need necessarily to use else
08:04 - but first if statement is must we could
08:09 - add some extra to conditions like this
08:11 - to the file so after checking it the
08:14 - name Sonia we'll just do a live name
08:17 - equals Magda and we'll print hey Magda
08:20 - and L if name equals Marie and print hey
08:24 - Marie one more important thing is to
08:29 - know that we can check different
08:31 - variables and values in every and Alex
08:35 - statement so we don't need to speak with
08:37 - name so for example we could add eight
08:40 - variable so after name is Sonia will
08:43 - type age is 21 let's change the if name
08:47 - is all our to LA and before that who
08:50 - will type if H is lower than 18 and we
08:53 - will print you are not allowed to see
08:55 - this
08:57 - now we will save the file again and run
09:00 - it in console and we have hey Sonia
09:03 - printed ok let's back and change age to
09:07 - 17 save and run it again we will get
09:11 - only you are not allowed to see this
09:14 - printed ok that's it for now today we
09:18 - learn how to write longer by the scripts
09:20 - and save them in a file to be able to
09:23 - execute them later on we also learn
09:26 - about if a leaf and our statement that
09:30 - allows us to check if there certain
09:32 - condition is met and execute some
09:35 - certain things only in that's true
09:37 - next time we'll talk about functions you
09:40 - already know some for example pythons
09:42 - learn function but in my next video I
09:45 - will show you how to write your own one
09:47 - so if you want to learn how to program
09:50 - with me make sure to subscribe this
09:52 - channel and stay tuned have a nice day
09:56 - and see you
