00:00 - hello everyone I'm Ola and this is
00:03 - coding is for
00:04 - [Music]
00:16 - girls as promised in my last video today
00:19 - I will show you some fun things today we
00:23 - will learn how to make it possible to
00:25 - allow user who is running your program
00:27 - to provide the value and then use it in
00:30 - our
00:31 - program while we'll talk about it we
00:34 - will also learn something very very
00:36 - useful in programming which is try
00:39 - accept
00:41 - Clause okay so without any further Ado
00:44 - let's open our code editor and start
00:47 - coding we already have function High we
00:50 - wrote in one of the previous
00:53 - episodes so far when we run it we had to
00:56 - call it in the end of the file like here
00:59 - we we have high Ola what we would like
01:02 - to do instead is to wait for user to
01:05 - give us a value and then run it with the
01:08 - text she
01:10 - provides the first thing we need here is
01:13 - to be able to read the value that the
01:15 - user is typing in programming jargon we
01:19 - say that we are reading from standard
01:21 - input python has the buildin function
01:25 - that does that and it's called
01:27 - input it basically waits for user to
01:30 - type something until the user clicks
01:33 - enter and then it just reads the whole
01:36 - line okay let's try it in our file we
01:40 - will replace hiola with input function
01:44 - the function takes one argument it will
01:47 - act as prompt for the user so she will
01:50 - know what to do let's say we would like
01:53 - to print what's your name and then maybe
01:56 - some greater signs so we know where to
01:59 - type
02:00 - we also want to store The Returned value
02:03 - from input in a variable named line
02:07 - finally we will call High function with
02:10 - the value from the input so from the
02:14 - line time to save the file and run it in
02:17 - the
02:19 - console what's your name text is
02:21 - displayed now and the program waits for
02:24 - you to provide a value so it haven't
02:27 - finished yet we can now type the name I
02:31 - will just type Ola and click
02:33 - enter hello Ola is printed now and the
02:36 - program is
02:38 - finished well done isn't that awesome
02:41 - you just created the program that
02:44 - expects user to provide the values and
02:47 - you are operating over these values and
02:50 - producing some output not knowing what
02:52 - the value will be this is a real
02:56 - programming you just get stuff from the
02:58 - user and and then do something with that
03:02 - okay let's try something similar but
03:05 - with the function that calculates the
03:07 - area of the square we wrote it when
03:10 - talking about functions I have a code
03:13 - stored in the square. pi file so I will
03:17 - open it and we will change it to use
03:20 - input now we would like to do the same
03:23 - as with our high function we will type
03:26 - input and then text let's say we want to
03:30 - print provide length of the square side
03:33 - we will store the value from the input
03:35 - in a variable called side finally we
03:38 - will call the area function with the
03:41 - value stored inside variable let's save
03:44 - and run it in the console so we type
03:47 - Python 3 squar Pi there is an error it
03:53 - says that it's impossible to multiply to
03:55 - text the thing is that input function in
03:59 - in Python is reading everything that
04:02 - user types as a text so as a string but
04:07 - our function expects to get a number so
04:10 - we can multiply it side by side so to
04:14 - fix it we would need to make sure that
04:17 - the text from the user is somehow
04:20 - transformed into the number and
04:23 - obviously python knows how to do that
04:25 - there is nice function called float that
04:28 - will take our text
04:30 - and change it into
04:31 - number let's try it in area function we
04:35 - will type float from side and assign it
04:39 - back to the side
04:41 - variable now this variable have value
04:45 - returned from the function float with
04:47 - argument with old value of the side so
04:50 - we sent number as a text to the float
04:53 - method and it is returned as number and
04:57 - assigned to variable side
05:01 - let's save and run the script again when
05:05 - we are asked to provide number we will
05:07 - type for and click
05:09 - enter it worked we got an area of the
05:13 - square with side of length for
05:16 - calculated for us but wait a minute what
05:19 - happens if the user makes the mistake
05:22 - and instead of typing the correct number
05:25 - she will type something different for
05:27 - example her name let's run our program
05:30 - again but this time we will try writing
05:34 - name I will write Ola instead of
05:37 - providing the number there is an error
05:40 - what happened well float function in
05:42 - Python expects to get text that you
05:45 - could somehow change into number
05:48 - transforming Ola into number is not
05:51 - possible and python
05:53 - complaints and in the programming jargon
05:56 - we call this complaining Rising an error
05:59 - ER or exception in this scenario value
06:03 - error was rised saying that transforming
06:05 - Alla text into number is not possible
06:09 - but what to do now then we don't want
06:12 - our program to crash anytime user type
06:15 - something that we don't expect to get it
06:18 - would be so much nicer to print some
06:20 - nice message so the user know what to do
06:24 - for example display the page saying this
06:26 - is not a number please rerun the program
06:29 - here comes the fun part python has
06:32 - something called try accept
06:34 - statement and if you wrap the code that
06:38 - you suspect might cause the error or
06:40 - exception in this try accept part you
06:44 - would be able to do some things when
06:46 - this error actually
06:48 - occurs to do that we start with typing
06:51 - try keyword and then colon we will start
06:55 - now a block of code the code we had so
06:58 - far that was converting text into number
07:01 - so float from side will be now inside
07:04 - this block so we need to indent it like
07:08 - this we will also indent the next line
07:11 - with print then we will type accept
07:14 - keyword this time not indented here we
07:18 - tell python if there is an error jump
07:21 - here after that you need to specify what
07:24 - kind of error or exception you are
07:26 - suspecting to get here we will type Val
07:29 - error as that was exactly the problem we
07:32 - encountered previously trying to convert
07:34 - text Ola into number then we will add
07:38 - column so we are starting the block of
07:41 - code again and this code will be
07:43 - executed only when the error
07:46 - happens and in the block of code we will
07:49 - type print this is not the correct
07:51 - number try to run the program
07:55 - again this time it's a success we have
07:58 - this is not the correct number try to
08:00 - run the program again print it congrats
08:04 - you just wrote your first program that
08:07 - deals with the user errors this is
08:10 - awesome and if you wonder what happens
08:12 - if you forget to add accept part and you
08:16 - just go with your program without having
08:19 - accept value error and then the block
08:21 - defined then please try now and see what
08:24 - happens what kind of error will you get
08:26 - will it be syntax error or maybe
08:28 - something else
08:29 - and if you have the code that might be
08:31 - very problematic on many levels you
08:34 - could catch different kinds of Errors
08:37 - you already SE quite a few of them and
08:39 - if you want to do something different
08:41 - depending on the error you can totally
08:43 - do that if you are interested in errors
08:47 - and exceptions in Python you should go
08:49 - and visit the python documentation page
08:52 - and read a little bit more about them I
08:55 - will put this link in the description
08:57 - below so we can check that later
09:00 - that's it for now you just learn how to
09:03 - read and use the value provided by user
09:07 - when the program is executed you also
09:09 - learn how to deal with possible errors I
09:13 - hope you enjoyed this video and if you
09:15 - want to learn how to program with me
09:18 - make sure to subscribe this Channel and
09:20 - stay tuned have a lovely day see
09:24 - [Music]
09:28 - you
