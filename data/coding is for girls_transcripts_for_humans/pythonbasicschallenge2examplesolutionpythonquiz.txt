00:00 - hello everyone I'm Ola this is coding is
00:04 - for girls in my previous video I gave
00:19 - you two challenges to solve using
00:21 - everything we learned so far about
00:23 - Python I will place the link to this
00:26 - video description below I already showed
00:29 - you how to solve the challenge number
00:31 - one in the video I will also place a
00:34 - link somewhere in description below and
00:37 - it's time to challenge number two so
00:39 - let's start with reminding what
00:42 - challenge number two was all about we
00:45 - wanted a program that asks a first
00:48 - question and gives you four possible
00:50 - answers then it waits for user to type
00:53 - one two three or four then second
00:57 - question is displayed and it waits for
00:59 - your answer then third fourth fifth and
01:03 - so on when user answers the last
01:06 - question we should check how many
01:08 - answers user answered correct and
01:11 - calculate the score we add one if user
01:14 - answer the question correctly and zero
01:17 - otherwise
01:18 - finally we want to display your score is
01:22 - result out of number of questions okay
01:26 - so we want to open our code editor and
01:28 - start coding but before we do that we
01:32 - need to have ten questions for our quiz
01:34 - and I wouldn't be myself if the question
01:38 - won't be related to Python here is a
01:41 - little quiz for you I will show you all
01:43 - the questions I preferred and if you
01:45 - want to check your 5 in knowledge grab a
01:48 - piece of paper or open the file and mark
01:51 - down all the answers you think are
01:54 - correct - rule number one is what
01:59 - command to use on mark to create a new
02:02 - folder in console 1 and Qadir to make
02:07 - dr3 dr4 LS
02:12 - question number two how do you define
02:15 - text or string in Python 1 only wrapping
02:20 - a text with single quotes 2 only
02:24 - wrapping text with double quotes 3
02:27 - wrapping a text with single or double
02:30 - quotes or even with triple double quotes
02:33 - for none of the above is true next
02:38 - question is how you could transfer
02:40 - number to string in Python one using
02:44 - float function to using STR function 3
02:48 - using string function for using dot text
02:53 - method fourth question is when you
02:57 - compare two values and want to check if
02:59 - value a is equal to value P how do you
03:03 - compare it in Python 1 using equal sign
03:07 - to using equal equal sign 3 using
03:11 - exclamation mark equal sign for using
03:15 - lower than and then greater than sign
03:19 - question number 5 what is a correct way
03:23 - in python to represent boolean true
03:26 - value 1 trip to capital true 3 1 for
03:32 - true with capitalized first letter
03:35 - question number 6 if you want to create
03:38 - a dictionary in Python you use 1 square
03:42 - brackets 2 normal brackets 3 curly
03:47 - brackets 4 lower than greater than signs
03:51 - question number 7 if we have dictionary
03:54 - like this participant equals name Ola
03:57 - languages polish English and German
04:00 - country Poland how we would check how
04:03 - many languages all aspects one learn
04:06 - from participant with key languages to
04:09 - participant from languages count free
04:13 - land from participant for participant
04:17 - from languages dot items question number
04:21 - 8 when we want to define a function in
04:23 - pi
04:24 - what keyword we use one funk to function
04:29 - free VAR for death question number nine
04:34 - which from below is not correct boolean
04:37 - operator in Python one and two x or
04:41 - three or four not and the last question
04:45 - is which of the below is correct syntax
04:49 - in Python when defining for loop one for
04:53 - the you in users - for VAR new in users
04:58 - free for you in users four for each user
05:03 - in users I hope you wrote down all your
05:06 - answers somewhere and you will be able
05:09 - to compare with correct answers very
05:12 - very soon the first thing we need to do
05:15 - is copy all our questions and answers
05:18 - into our Python file let's start with
05:22 - creating a file named quiz to try and
05:25 - copy the text of the questions as I just
05:28 - presented it to you let's fix the file
05:31 - so all the lines containing questions
05:34 - are proper strings in Python we will use
05:37 - backslash and for the newline in string
05:40 - so I will use it for each questions
05:43 - right now I will make sure to end every
05:46 - question with it and place it between
05:49 - every answer for each question I will
05:52 - store the first question in variable
05:54 - named question one and I will do the
05:57 - same with all other questions it's very
06:00 - very repetitive so let's go first
06:03 - forward and yes we're done now
06:06 - so what we want now is to display the
06:09 - first question and wait for users answer
06:12 - we will use input function for that and
06:15 - check my Python basics user input and
06:18 - dealing with errors video if you don't
06:20 - remember this function we will type now
06:22 - in the file answer equals input from
06:26 - question 1 then we want to also have all
06:29 - the answers for all the remaining 9
06:32 - questions let's repeat the line and
06:35 - store answer
06:36 - invariables answer to answer free and so
06:39 - on and so on
06:40 - last step in the challenge was to check
06:42 - what is the score of the person will
06:45 - need a variable result which is 0 at the
06:48 - beginning so result equals zero and then
06:51 - we'll check every single answer if it's
06:54 - correct for this we will use if
06:56 - statement now it's a moment of truth
06:58 - take your answers of your question and
07:00 - compare with correct answers why I will
07:04 - type we remember that we get a string
07:06 - from the input method so we'll make sure
07:09 - to compare with a string representation
07:11 - of the answer so let's look at the first
07:14 - question the correct answer was answer
07:17 - number one so we will type if answer 1
07:20 - equals string 1 : and in that indented
07:26 - block you want to add one point to the
07:28 - result so we'll type result equals
07:31 - result plus 1 now let's look at question
07:34 - number 2 this time the correct answer
07:36 - was answer number 3 so we'll type if
07:39 - answer 2 equals 3 result equals result
07:44 - plus 1 now in case of question 3 the
07:47 - correct answer was to question number 4
07:51 - had answer to question 5 answer number 4
07:55 - question 6 answer number 3 question 7
08:00 - answer number one question 8 ah sir
08:03 - number 4
08:04 - question 9 answer number 2 and question
08:08 - 10 answer number 3 okay we calculated
08:11 - the result so that only missing bit is
08:14 - to display the result of the quiz let's
08:17 - type print your score is curly brackets
08:21 - out of 10 questions don't format result
08:25 - we are using format method here that I
08:28 - showed you in my previous video when I
08:30 - talked about how you could implement
08:32 - challenge number one so make sure to
08:35 - check this solution too even if you
08:37 - haven't implemented tarnish number 1 and
08:39 - you skip that previously okay time to
08:42 - check our program let's go to the
08:44 - console and type Python 3 wasted 5 and
08:48 - answer questions
08:50 - I'm very lazy so I will answer to all of
08:53 - them with answer 1 and in the end my
08:56 - result is two correct answers out of 10
08:59 - out if we look into the code now we see
09:03 - it ugly there is so much repetition so
09:06 - many each statement that looks pretty
09:08 - much the same and I hope you remember
09:10 - that if you do similar code multiple
09:12 - times for many different elements you
09:15 - can use for loop and this is what we
09:18 - will do now we will replace all this tan
09:22 - if statements with only one that is
09:25 - wrapped in the Florida let's go back to
09:28 - our file what we want to do is look over
09:31 - every question from one to ten so to do
09:34 - that we will store all the questions in
09:36 - a question variable and we'll store it
09:40 - in the list like this questions equals
09:43 - list and now we'll put all the variables
09:46 - so question 1 question 2 question 3 4 5
09:50 - 6 7 8 9 and 10 now when we have a list
09:55 - we can iterate in there for loop over it
09:58 - so we will have for question in a
10:01 - questions : okay but now there is a
10:04 - problem because we have number of
10:06 - different variables answer one answer
10:09 - two and so on and each of them have
10:11 - different correct answer but what we can
10:15 - do is store in our questions variables
10:18 - in the list not only question itself but
10:21 - also a correct answer and answer that
10:24 - user gave let's change each row here to
10:28 - contain inner list first will be the
10:31 - question then answer from the user and
10:34 - last one will be expected correct answer
10:37 - so for question one will have list
10:40 - question one answer one and one then for
10:45 - question to answer two and three and so
10:48 - on for each of the question now inside
10:52 - our for loop we will change the code to
10:55 - catch all three values for each row at
10:58 - once I hope you remember how to do that
11:00 - we simply specify names for
11:03 - each value separating them with common
11:06 - so we will have it like this now for a
11:09 - question , answer comma correct answer
11:12 - in questions then in the block we want
11:16 - to check if users answer is equal to the
11:19 - correct answer or not
11:20 - so if answer equals correct answer and
11:24 - inside we will have the old code result
11:27 - equals result this one okay now we can
11:31 - delete all previous gifs just make sure
11:34 - to leave result equals zero because we
11:36 - still need it now we can run the code in
11:39 - console and see that our reactor in was
11:42 - successful and we still have fully
11:44 - working quiz let me prove the code even
11:47 - more now we have 10 different variables
11:50 - with all the questions and then we pack
11:53 - them inside the questions list maybe we
11:56 - could merge this tool instead and we
11:59 - will know which correct answer
12:00 - correspond to each question let's copy
12:03 - each question inside the questions list
12:06 - and delete all question 1 question 2
12:09 - question 3 and so on so when we finish
12:11 - we have something like this and let's
12:14 - run it in a console then I can free
12:16 - waste of 5 Oh No we have an error this
12:21 - is because we just lit it all the
12:23 - variables question 1 question 2 and so
12:25 - forth and we need them to store all
12:28 - answer one answer to answer three
12:30 - variables but the thing is we don't
12:33 - really need to do that before our for
12:36 - loop instead let's move catching the
12:38 - user answers inside our loop this way we
12:42 - will have a question so we can display
12:44 - input from question start the value and
12:47 - then compare it with the correct answer
12:49 - it will be super nice right let's do it
12:52 - now we will remove all answer one answer
12:55 - two and so forth then we don't have them
12:58 - anymore so we need to remove all of them
13:00 - from questions list we have now each row
13:03 - with question and correct answer only so
13:07 - in our for loop we need to remove answer
13:10 - bit and instead inside will ask user for
13:14 - the answer for each question
13:16 - like this answer equals input from
13:20 - question and then we can easily compare
13:22 - newly stored user answer with the
13:25 - correct answer and update users result
13:29 - let's save and track if our program
13:31 - still works Python 3 quiz 5 in the yes
13:35 - it works like charm
13:37 - thanks to this change we can easily add
13:40 - any number of questions to the list it's
13:43 - all about adding our question and
13:46 - correct answer to questions variable and
13:49 - then our quiz will have more questions
13:52 - in 10 but there are other ways to make
13:55 - the wasted 5 program even nicer
13:58 - for example now question and answers are
14:01 - not very readable in the code we can
14:04 - refactor the code to make it more
14:06 - readable for us what we could do for
14:08 - example is changing our inner list
14:10 - containing question with answer and
14:13 - correct answer into dictionary that
14:16 - contain every single bit under separate
14:19 - key for example question will be under
14:21 - question list of answers will be under
14:25 - key answer and we will have correct
14:27 - answer separately to its right to
14:30 - electorate then we will start with the
14:32 - first question we will create a
14:34 - dictionary so we use curly brackets now
14:37 - under key question we will place whole
14:40 - question but we will cut all the
14:43 - possible answers we can now remove
14:45 - backslash n so the enter from the string
14:49 - and now under possible answers key we
14:52 - will split remaining bit into a list of
14:56 - answers like this possible answers 1 and
15:00 - Khedira to make dr3 dr4 LS and each time
15:06 - we remove backslash n since it is no
15:08 - longer needed and finally we will store
15:11 - 1 under correct answer key and we can
15:14 - close that dict now let's refactor all
15:17 - remaining questions
15:19 - it is so tedious so let's have a little
15:23 - fast-forward
15:25 - okay we're done now when we save the
15:28 - file and who tried to run our code we'll
15:31 - end up with an error we get value error
15:33 - too many values to unpack yeah we just
15:37 - completely changed elements in questions
15:40 - for Yahoo from a list to a dictionary we
15:43 - need to fix it instead of question and
15:46 - correct answer will simply catch
15:48 - question definition and we will have a
15:51 - full dictionary inside with all answers
15:54 - and question text and correct answer
15:57 - then we want to show question and all
16:00 - the possible answers let's print it like
16:02 - this print question definition from
16:05 - question and then for possible answer in
16:08 - question definition possible answers
16:11 - print possible answer finally change
16:14 - input function to display three greater
16:17 - than signs instead of the questions like
16:20 - this now correct answer should be
16:23 - changed into question definition correct
16:25 - answer okay we're done here time to
16:28 - track if the code still works let's go
16:30 - back to console and run it again item
16:32 - three we stood by it still works perfect
16:36 - this video is already quite long and I
16:39 - have so many ideas how to improve the
16:41 - code but instead of creating 30-minute
16:45 - long video that nobody will watch I want
16:47 - to show you one small improvement for
16:50 - the code now and suggest next step that
16:53 - you can implement on your own
16:55 - so currently our program treats us a
16:57 - correct answer only those that are
17:00 - exactly 1 2 3 or 4 but if we add space
17:05 - before or after our answer our program
17:08 - will treat it as incorrect thing so if
17:11 - we for example answer phase one where
17:15 - the one is a correct answer our programs
17:17 - tell things that we answered incorrectly
17:20 - it is not nice to prevent it we can use
17:24 - one of the Python building methods
17:27 - called string this cuts all the white
17:30 - space before and after text let's first
17:34 - see what happens when we always type
17:37 - space and then one instead of just one
17:40 - in every question previously when we
17:43 - always gave one as an answer our end
17:46 - result was two out of ten questions
17:48 - let's run the program in console and
17:51 - type space one every single time this
17:54 - time we had exactly zero good answers
17:57 - this is because space 1 is different
18:00 - from just one let's open our code editor
18:03 - and try to fix it in if statement we
18:07 - compare answer with correct answer here
18:09 - we would like to use Python straight
18:12 - method so we will do answer dot string
18:15 - and open and close parentheses this will
18:19 - cut all spaces before and after the
18:22 - answer ok let's save and time to test it
18:25 - in console we type Python 3 quiz at 5
18:28 - this time even though we typed Space 1
18:31 - we still got two answers correct out of
18:34 - 10 congratulations the possible next
18:38 - step here would be to make sure that if
18:41 - user type 1 dot or 2 dot our program
18:45 - still treat it as a correct answer it's
18:47 - very possible right another thing we
18:49 - could do is not letting user to go to
18:53 - the next question
18:54 - until they provide one of the possible
18:57 - values so 1 2 3 or 4 so if the user type
19:01 - olá our program still would say this is
19:05 - not one possible answer can you provide
19:08 - one for this question we can do that
19:11 - using while loop but the thing is I
19:13 - haven't introduced while loop to you yet
19:15 - this is my plan for the next video I
19:18 - hope you had an amazing time trying to
19:20 - implement all the challenges I've
19:22 - prepared for you I must admit I had
19:24 - great great fun filming these videos
19:27 - next time as I already suggested I will
19:30 - talk about while loops so if you are
19:33 - interested what the while loop is what
19:36 - is the syntax and why I really really
19:39 - try to avoid using them unless it's
19:42 - absolutely necessary make sure to check
19:45 - out my next videos so if you want to
19:48 - learn how to program with me
19:50 - make sure does
19:51 - like this channel and stay tuned have a
19:54 - lovely day and see you

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone I'm Ola this is coding is for girls in my previous video I gave you two challenges to solve using everything we learned so far about Python I will place the link to this video description below I already showed you how to solve the challenge number one in the video I will also place a link somewhere in description below and it's time to challenge number two so let's start with reminding what challenge number two was all about we wanted a program that asks a first question and gives you four possible answers then it waits for user to type one two three or four then second question is displayed and it waits for your answer then third fourth fifth and so on when user answers the last question we should check how many answers user answered correct and calculate the score we add one if user answer the question correctly and zero otherwise finally we want to display your score is result out of number of questions okay so we want to open our code editor and start coding but before we do that we need to have ten questions for our quiz and I wouldn't be myself if the question won't be related to Python here is a little quiz for you I will show you all the questions I preferred and if you want to check your 5 in knowledge grab a piece of paper or open the file and mark down all the answers you think are correct rule number one is what command to use on mark to create a new folder in console 1 and Qadir to make dr3 dr4 LS question number two how do you define text or string in Python 1 only wrapping a text with single quotes 2 only wrapping text with double quotes 3 wrapping a text with single or double quotes or even with triple double quotes for none of the above is true next question is how you could transfer number to string in Python one using float function to using STR function 3 using string function for using dot text method fourth question is when you compare two values and want to check if value a is equal to value P how do you compare it in Python 1 using equal sign to using equal equal sign 3 using exclamation mark equal sign for using lower than and then greater than sign question number 5 what is a correct way in python to represent boolean true value 1 trip to capital true 3 1 for true with capitalized first letter question number 6 if you want to create a dictionary in Python you use 1 square brackets 2 normal brackets 3 curly brackets 4 lower than greater than signs question number 7 if we have dictionary like this participant equals name Ola languages polish English and German country Poland how we would check how many languages all aspects one learn from participant with key languages to participant from languages count free land from participant for participant from languages dot items question number 8 when we want to define a function in pi what keyword we use one funk to function free VAR for death question number nine which from below is not correct boolean operator in Python one and two x or three or four not and the last question is which of the below is correct syntax in Python when defining for loop one for the you in users for VAR new in users free for you in users four for each user in users I hope you wrote down all your answers somewhere and you will be able to compare with correct answers very very soon the first thing we need to do is copy all our questions and answers into our Python file let's start with creating a file named quiz to try and copy the text of the questions as I just presented it to you let's fix the file so all the lines containing questions are proper strings in Python we will use backslash and for the newline in string so I will use it for each questions right now I will make sure to end every question with it and place it between every answer for each question I will store the first question in variable named question one and I will do the same with all other questions it's very very repetitive so let's go first forward and yes we're done now so what we want now is to display the first question and wait for users answer we will use input function for that and check my Python basics user input and dealing with errors video if you don't remember this function we will type now in the file answer equals input from question 1 then we want to also have all the answers for all the remaining 9 questions let's repeat the line and store answer invariables answer to answer free and so on and so on last step in the challenge was to check what is the score of the person will need a variable result which is 0 at the beginning so result equals zero and then we'll check every single answer if it's correct for this we will use if statement now it's a moment of truth take your answers of your question and compare with correct answers why I will type we remember that we get a string from the input method so we'll make sure to compare with a string representation of the answer so let's look at the first question the correct answer was answer number one so we will type if answer 1 equals string 1 and in that indented block you want to add one point to the result so we'll type result equals result plus 1 now let's look at question number 2 this time the correct answer was answer number 3 so we'll type if answer 2 equals 3 result equals result plus 1 now in case of question 3 the correct answer was to question number 4 had answer to question 5 answer number 4 question 6 answer number 3 question 7 answer number one question 8 ah sir number 4 question 9 answer number 2 and question 10 answer number 3 okay we calculated the result so that only missing bit is to display the result of the quiz let's type print your score is curly brackets out of 10 questions don't format result we are using format method here that I showed you in my previous video when I talked about how you could implement challenge number one so make sure to check this solution too even if you haven't implemented tarnish number 1 and you skip that previously okay time to check our program let's go to the console and type Python 3 wasted 5 and answer questions I'm very lazy so I will answer to all of them with answer 1 and in the end my result is two correct answers out of 10 out if we look into the code now we see it ugly there is so much repetition so many each statement that looks pretty much the same and I hope you remember that if you do similar code multiple times for many different elements you can use for loop and this is what we will do now we will replace all this tan if statements with only one that is wrapped in the Florida let's go back to our file what we want to do is look over every question from one to ten so to do that we will store all the questions in a question variable and we'll store it in the list like this questions equals list and now we'll put all the variables so question 1 question 2 question 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 now when we have a list we can iterate in there for loop over it so we will have for question in a questions okay but now there is a problem because we have number of different variables answer one answer two and so on and each of them have different correct answer but what we can do is store in our questions variables in the list not only question itself but also a correct answer and answer that user gave let's change each row here to contain inner list first will be the question then answer from the user and last one will be expected correct answer so for question one will have list question one answer one and one then for question to answer two and three and so on for each of the question now inside our for loop we will change the code to catch all three values for each row at once I hope you remember how to do that we simply specify names for each value separating them with common so we will have it like this now for a question , answer comma correct answer in questions then in the block we want to check if users answer is equal to the correct answer or not so if answer equals correct answer and inside we will have the old code result equals result this one okay now we can delete all previous gifs just make sure to leave result equals zero because we still need it now we can run the code in console and see that our reactor in was successful and we still have fully working quiz let me prove the code even more now we have 10 different variables with all the questions and then we pack them inside the questions list maybe we could merge this tool instead and we will know which correct answer correspond to each question let's copy each question inside the questions list and delete all question 1 question 2 question 3 and so on so when we finish we have something like this and let's run it in a console then I can free waste of 5 Oh No we have an error this is because we just lit it all the variables question 1 question 2 and so forth and we need them to store all answer one answer to answer three variables but the thing is we don't really need to do that before our for loop instead let's move catching the user answers inside our loop this way we will have a question so we can display input from question start the value and then compare it with the correct answer it will be super nice right let's do it now we will remove all answer one answer two and so forth then we don't have them anymore so we need to remove all of them from questions list we have now each row with question and correct answer only so in our for loop we need to remove answer bit and instead inside will ask user for the answer for each question like this answer equals input from question and then we can easily compare newly stored user answer with the correct answer and update users result let's save and track if our program still works Python 3 quiz 5 in the yes it works like charm thanks to this change we can easily add any number of questions to the list it's all about adding our question and correct answer to questions variable and then our quiz will have more questions in 10 but there are other ways to make the wasted 5 program even nicer for example now question and answers are not very readable in the code we can refactor the code to make it more readable for us what we could do for example is changing our inner list containing question with answer and correct answer into dictionary that contain every single bit under separate key for example question will be under question list of answers will be under key answer and we will have correct answer separately to its right to electorate then we will start with the first question we will create a dictionary so we use curly brackets now under key question we will place whole question but we will cut all the possible answers we can now remove backslash n so the enter from the string and now under possible answers key we will split remaining bit into a list of answers like this possible answers 1 and Khedira to make dr3 dr4 LS and each time we remove backslash n since it is no longer needed and finally we will store 1 under correct answer key and we can close that dict now let's refactor all remaining questions it is so tedious so let's have a little fastforward okay we're done now when we save the file and who tried to run our code we'll end up with an error we get value error too many values to unpack yeah we just completely changed elements in questions for Yahoo from a list to a dictionary we need to fix it instead of question and correct answer will simply catch question definition and we will have a full dictionary inside with all answers and question text and correct answer then we want to show question and all the possible answers let's print it like this print question definition from question and then for possible answer in question definition possible answers print possible answer finally change input function to display three greater than signs instead of the questions like this now correct answer should be changed into question definition correct answer okay we're done here time to track if the code still works let's go back to console and run it again item three we stood by it still works perfect this video is already quite long and I have so many ideas how to improve the code but instead of creating 30minute long video that nobody will watch I want to show you one small improvement for the code now and suggest next step that you can implement on your own so currently our program treats us a correct answer only those that are exactly 1 2 3 or 4 but if we add space before or after our answer our program will treat it as incorrect thing so if we for example answer phase one where the one is a correct answer our programs tell things that we answered incorrectly it is not nice to prevent it we can use one of the Python building methods called string this cuts all the white space before and after text let's first see what happens when we always type space and then one instead of just one in every question previously when we always gave one as an answer our end result was two out of ten questions let's run the program in console and type space one every single time this time we had exactly zero good answers this is because space 1 is different from just one let's open our code editor and try to fix it in if statement we compare answer with correct answer here we would like to use Python straight method so we will do answer dot string and open and close parentheses this will cut all spaces before and after the answer ok let's save and time to test it in console we type Python 3 quiz at 5 this time even though we typed Space 1 we still got two answers correct out of 10 congratulations the possible next step here would be to make sure that if user type 1 dot or 2 dot our program still treat it as a correct answer it's very possible right another thing we could do is not letting user to go to the next question until they provide one of the possible values so 1 2 3 or 4 so if the user type olá our program still would say this is not one possible answer can you provide one for this question we can do that using while loop but the thing is I haven't introduced while loop to you yet this is my plan for the next video I hope you had an amazing time trying to implement all the challenges I've prepared for you I must admit I had great great fun filming these videos next time as I already suggested I will talk about while loops so if you are interested what the while loop is what is the syntax and why I really really try to avoid using them unless it's absolutely necessary make sure to check out my next videos so if you want to learn how to program with me make sure does like this channel and stay tuned have a lovely day and see you
