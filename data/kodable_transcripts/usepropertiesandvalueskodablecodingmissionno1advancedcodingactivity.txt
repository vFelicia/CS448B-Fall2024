00:01 - this is the fuzz family you might notice
00:04 - that no two fuzzes look exactly the same
00:07 - some have blue eyes some are rainbow
00:09 - some are different accessories
00:12 - just from looking you can tell that blue
00:15 - is different from Prism but how
00:18 - they look different because they have
00:20 - different properties
00:23 - a property is a feature or
00:25 - characteristic of an object
00:28 - you have properties that make you human
00:30 - like hands ears and a nose
00:33 - fuzzes have properties too
00:36 - they have a body eyes
00:39 - and a mouth
00:41 - fuzzes have many properties in common
00:43 - for example all fuzzes have color body
00:46 - color is a property but as a programmer
00:49 - you can change this property's value to
00:52 - make body color vary from fuzz to fuzz
00:55 - for example the value of the color
00:57 - property for blue fuzz is blue but you
01:01 - would change that value to Green for
01:03 - Simon
01:04 - you try what's the value of the color
01:07 - property for Shaggy
01:10 - what about princess
01:13 - properties are important because they
01:15 - help us tell all the fuzzes apart
01:19 - the cool thing is that as a programmer
01:22 - you can assign or change a property's
01:24 - value in your code and it will change
01:27 - what a user sees let's check that out in
01:29 - fuzz Builder
01:32 - [Music]
01:35 - here is a body property we definitely
01:38 - want that for our fuzz
01:42 - but there are different colors of bodies
01:44 - here I can assign the value green to
01:47 - this body
01:53 - I can also change it to gold
01:59 - the property itself doesn't change this
02:01 - fuzz still has a body but the color is
02:04 - variable which means it can change
02:06 - depending on what you assign
02:09 - here's your mission build two fuzzes
02:12 - that look different from each other the
02:14 - fuzzes can only share one property value
02:17 - in common
02:21 - for example your first fuzz might have
02:24 - green fur
02:25 - green eyes
02:27 - and green accessories
02:38 - but for your second fuzz try to switch
02:41 - it up
02:42 - change the body color value to be
02:44 - something new
02:48 - get creative and try to make your fuzzes
02:50 - as different as possible
02:53 - here I am choosing properties and other
02:55 - items that I know I did not assign to my
02:57 - first fuzz
02:59 - double check your work
03:02 - every line of code between your two
03:05 - fuzzes should be different except for
03:07 - one
03:09 - when you are done compare your two
03:11 - fuzzes to somebody else's do your fuzzes
03:14 - share the same properties how are they
03:16 - similar what values did you choose to
03:19 - make your fuzz's properties look
03:21 - different
03:23 - now it's your turn
03:25 - open fuzz Builder build two fuzzes and
03:28 - complete your mission
03:30 - remember you're looking to build two
03:32 - fuzzes that look different from each
03:34 - other the fuzzes can only share one
03:36 - property value in common
03:39 - good luck
