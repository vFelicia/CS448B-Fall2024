00:15 - student engagement and enjoyment of
00:17 - coding curriculum is critical
00:20 - and
00:21 - there is an exciting fun way to combine
00:24 - computer science education
00:26 - with that assessment method we mentioned
00:28 - design scenarios and that is
00:30 - project-based learning this is also a
00:32 - big buzzword i'm sure you've heard about
00:34 - it before but i'd like to touch on it
00:36 - with computer science in mind and kind
00:38 - of give you an outline for
00:40 - how to do project-based learning in your
00:42 - classroom if you're interested but also
00:44 - why it's a really effective tool for
00:47 - measuring and tracking progress for your
00:49 - students
00:52 - all right so i will move on to the next
00:56 - slide
00:59 - all right so what is project-based
01:02 - learning
01:03 - project-based learning i might say pbl
01:06 - is a teaching approach in which
01:08 - students are engaging in and learning
01:11 - through authentic meaningful projects so
01:14 - rather than doing like a summative
01:17 - project at the end you've done your your
01:19 - core curriculum you've reached the end
01:21 - of the unit you're going to do a big
01:23 - project to wrap it up
01:25 - project-based learning means actually
01:27 - embedding the project
01:29 - and the instruction together like the
01:31 - project is the curriculum it's the whole
01:34 - unit so i really loved this quote that
01:37 - describes project-based learning as
01:40 - integrating knowing and doing so
01:42 - students learn knowledge and elements of
01:44 - the core curriculum but then they apply
01:46 - it to solve authentic problems and
01:48 - produce results that matter and your
01:51 - kindergarten first grade and second
01:52 - grade students absolutely can do this
01:55 - i've seen some early elementary teachers
01:57 - kind of shy away from the project-based
02:00 - learning approach because thinking about
02:02 - real-world
02:03 - authentic problems
02:05 - kind of seems big sometimes for our
02:07 - youngest learners but they can handle it
02:09 - and i'll give you an example of a
02:10 - teacher who is doing work like that now
02:15 - so how to implement project-based
02:18 - learning in the classroom as a computer
02:20 - science teacher
02:21 - you may choose to present a problem or a
02:24 - question that relates to technology
02:26 - since that's the subject that you're
02:28 - teaching or you're trying to incorporate
02:30 - into your classroom and you can try to
02:32 - bed embed authenticity into the project
02:36 - by
02:37 - guiding students to examine computer
02:40 - science technology already in the world
02:42 - around them
02:44 - again early elementary students they
02:46 - know what's going on in the world of
02:47 - technology way more than we know and
02:49 - they can tackle
02:50 - a real world problem through coding and
02:53 - programming
02:54 - i do know it can be tricky to come up
02:57 - with a challenging problem or a question
02:59 - for students to solve which is why i
03:02 - definitely recommend following what your
03:04 - students are interested in aim for
03:07 - engagement what we talked about earlier
03:09 - so
03:10 - if your students are interested in
03:12 - topics like protecting the environment
03:14 - or helping animals then you might start
03:17 - with a core essential question related
03:20 - to that subject and then go off of that
03:23 - and the un sustainable development goals
03:26 - that i mentioned
03:27 - back when we were talking about iste
03:30 - um standards that is a great place to
03:33 - start you might recognize that
03:36 - these un goals like i mentioned are
03:38 - they're already iste aligned and you can
03:41 - use them as a resource to guide student
03:44 - learning so
03:45 - this
03:46 - example that you see on the screen this
03:48 - is from a teacher who goes at by at
03:52 - edtech classroom she's on instagram and
03:54 - um and twitter and she
03:58 - honed in on a un sustainable development
04:01 - goal and then asked her students how can
04:03 - we help reduce pollution in our oceans
04:06 - the ideas that they came up with she
04:08 - kind of captured in this web and then
04:10 - from there they developed a project and
04:13 - actually created solutions for this real
04:16 - world challenge and she brought in the
04:19 - codable coding tool to investigate this
04:22 - further what it would mean for keeping
04:24 - beaches clean and how it all connects
04:26 - together so that's a great example of
04:29 - using a resource like the un sustainable
04:32 - development goals like the iste computer
04:34 - science standards and coming up with
04:37 - project ideas from there and then
04:39 - incorporating technology and different
04:41 - coding resources to help out towards the
04:43 - end
04:47 - so why are projects effective evaluation
04:50 - tools we sort of mentioned it when we
04:52 - went over the design scenario as an
04:54 - evaluation method
04:56 - i will just highlight that
04:58 - authentic assessment and evaluation
05:01 - through project-based learning will
05:04 - allow us to
05:06 - like systematically document a child's
05:08 - progress and development because the
05:10 - project happens over time it's not a
05:12 - single day where anyone could be having
05:14 - a bad day they take a test and it
05:17 - demonstrates that
05:18 - they are in x group and not meeting x
05:21 - standards with a project
05:24 - it's it's a longer
05:25 - you know it's a longer time
05:28 - uh it's longer and time consuming and
05:31 - children have to put more effort towards
05:32 - it for a more sustained amount of time
05:35 - so as the teacher will be able to
05:37 - systematically document their progress
05:40 - from the start of the project to the end
05:42 - and depending on the project pbl can
05:45 - develop a child's ability to
05:48 - work both independently and with their
05:50 - peers building teamwork and group skills
05:53 - and there's so many components as i
05:55 - mentioned that it lets the teacher have
05:57 - multiple assessment opportunities like
05:59 - you could assess the planning stage
06:02 - if you're doing research online you
06:04 - could assess how the research
06:06 - works and their typing skills you can
06:08 - move into the actual
06:11 - solution design stage think about how
06:14 - they are thinking outside the box and
06:16 - being innovative
06:17 - basically it allows you the teacher to
06:19 - learn a lot more about
06:22 - the student as a person
06:24 - and as someone who is working on a
06:27 - project that they care about
06:28 - from start to finish
06:31 - i really love pbl because it refocuses
06:34 - education on the student it's not just
06:36 - the curriculum it's it's like student
06:38 - human based and you're able to capture
06:41 - things that can't be taught or measured
06:44 - with an exam they must be
06:46 - like activated through experience like
06:49 - drive passion creativity empathy
06:52 - um resiliency so i love projects they
06:55 - give you a little glimpse at these
06:57 - intangibles that students have to offer
06:59 - they just might not have the right
07:02 - medium to do it
07:03 - and one last thing computer science is a
07:06 - field that is all about the creation and
07:09 - execution of projects producing websites
07:11 - building software creating video games
07:15 - coders are coding for a purpose there's
07:17 - an outcome there's something that
07:18 - they're working towards it's project
07:20 - based in the real world so i love to
07:23 - mirror that at school
07:26 - and have the
07:27 - things that we're using to evaluate
07:29 - learning be
07:30 - what you would use to evaluate a coder
07:33 - in the real world
