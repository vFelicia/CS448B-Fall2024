00:00 - gracie fuzz is working on a puzzle but
00:02 - she needs your help
00:04 - she's looking for a piece that will fit
00:06 - right here
00:08 - can you help her
00:09 - which of these puzzle pieces do you
00:11 - think will fit
00:12 - when solving a problem like this
00:14 - try breaking it down into a series of
00:16 - steps
00:17 - first think about the problem
00:19 - a puzzle piece is missing and we need to
00:21 - figure out which one it is
00:23 - then make a hypothesis
00:25 - based on the information in front of you
00:27 - and what you already know about puzzles
00:30 - choose the one you think will work best
00:32 - you likely know that for a puzzle piece
00:34 - to fit both the shape and color need to
00:37 - match the pieces around it
00:40 - this one appears to have the correct
00:42 - color but it's the wrong shape
00:45 - this one looks to have the right shape
00:47 - but it's the wrong color
00:49 - how about this one it seems to be the
00:51 - right shape and the right color
00:54 - then test it out
00:56 - place the puzzle piece and observe the
00:57 - results it's a perfect fit
01:00 - in programming when two things have the
01:02 - same value it's called equality
01:06 - this double equal sign is known as the
01:08 - equality operator
01:10 - it's kind of like your own personal
01:12 - detective who works double time to check
01:15 - whether the value of the thing on the
01:17 - left side of the double equal sign
01:19 - is the same as the value on the right
01:23 - once the operator does its check it will
01:25 - return a value of true or false
01:29 - if the values are equal
01:31 - then the result is true
01:33 - if the values are not equal
01:36 - then the result is false
01:38 - true and false are boolean values and a
01:42 - computer uses booleans to help make
01:44 - decisions about what to do next here's
01:46 - an example you might have seen in real
01:48 - life
01:49 - think about a computer program that
01:51 - controls whether or not you can unlock a
01:53 - smartphone
01:55 - the program would say something like
01:57 - if you enter the correct password
01:59 - then you can log in
02:02 - this is a conditional statement
02:04 - you can only log in
02:06 - if this condition is true
02:09 - so how does your device know if a
02:11 - password attempt is correct
02:14 - when you type in your password the
02:15 - program will compare it with your stored
02:18 - password using the trusted equality
02:21 - operator
02:23 - the operator will check to see if the
02:25 - two values are equal if the entered
02:27 - password and the stored password are not
02:30 - equal
02:31 - then the result is false and you can't
02:34 - log in but if the operator finds that
02:37 - the two values are equal then the result
02:40 - is true and then you go
02:43 - now you can see how equality booleans
02:46 - and conditions all work together to
02:48 - control how a program behaves and when
02:51 - certain things can happen
02:52 - let's look at how equality works in
02:54 - codable
02:56 - in order for our fuzz to reach the end
02:58 - of the maze it needs to be able to roll
03:00 - through this tunnel but the tunnel door
03:03 - is closed
03:04 - we are looking for the right key that
03:06 - will open the door
03:08 - let's try coding our fuzz to roll
03:10 - through the maze and pick up a key along
03:13 - the way
03:15 - uh-oh the key our fuzz collects must
03:18 - have a shape value and color value that
03:22 - are equal to the shape and color on the
03:25 - tunnel
03:26 - pink circle and orange diamond are not
03:29 - equal so the tunnel door stays closed
03:33 - let's try again
03:34 - this time we'll code our fuzz to collect
03:37 - the orange diamond key
03:40 - orange diamond is equal to orange
03:42 - diamond the tunnel door opens and our
03:45 - fuzz can roll through
03:47 - happy coding
