00:00 - [Music]
00:00 - woohoo let's
00:03 - [Music]
00:05 - go computers think in a very specific
00:08 - way and if you understand how they think
00:09 - you're going to understand how the world
00:10 - works and that's going to make you more
00:12 - successful in everything you do as a
00:14 - district we didn't anticipate was going
00:16 - to happen I think when we started
00:17 - rolling out the Kinder code program
00:20 - using codable that it was okay well
00:22 - we're just going to do this one thing
00:24 - and that what we found was it opened up
00:28 - the doors to a lot of conversation we
00:30 - wouldn't have had when we introduce
00:32 - codable to the students I really like to
00:34 - kind of have a conversation with them
00:36 - connected to what they're doing as
00:38 - student so in kindergarten they're
00:39 - coming to school to learn their letters
00:41 - and their sounds to be able to read and
00:44 - we like to connect that to how computers
00:46 - know how to read to and computers read
00:48 - code and we kind of connect that then to
00:51 - what they're going to see in the game if
00:52 - you want to teach computer science I
00:54 - think you should approach it the same
00:55 - way as if you want to learn computer
00:56 - science a lot of people like they want
01:00 - to figure out what language I want to
01:01 - use or what framework should I use or
01:03 - what program should I buy what kind of
01:04 - computer should I get really you're
01:06 - you're not going to know that a front
01:08 - you just want to get started I think the
01:10 - most important thing is to Dive Right In
01:11 - kid can go on an app and play but it
01:14 - looks just the same to them they don't
01:16 - recognize what they're doing they don't
01:18 - always make that conclusion oh I'm using
01:21 - conditionals or oh I'm learning how to
01:23 - do things step by step that's where the
01:26 - teaching comes into play and so having
01:28 - somebody do that via instruction and
01:31 - help them make that connection is also
01:33 - where you then take that connection
01:35 - outside of the app and into other areas
01:37 - so we make a big effort to understand
01:40 - what teachers do in the classroom and
01:41 - how we can make them most successful
01:43 - teaching it even if they don't know
01:45 - computer science themselves and
01:47 - everything we do that can make it easier
01:48 - is just going to help them and
01:49 - ultimately it's going to help the kids
01:51 - which is what's most important puzzles
01:52 - are all online for the students so they
01:54 - can progress and they're practicing the
01:56 - skills on their device but as a teacher
01:59 - you get to go in and you can model the
02:01 - lessons you can introduce the language
02:03 - to them you can scaffold it so that way
02:06 - when they go in they playing by
02:07 - themselves they're building their
02:09 - understanding based on what you provided
02:10 - them before they get to play not just
02:13 - trying for the kids in terms of like I'm
02:15 - willing to try something new and
02:16 - different it became something different
02:18 - for the teachers too and was made it so
02:21 - that oh I can explore other areas of
02:24 - Technology because I'm starting to feel
02:26 - comfortable from going around to
02:28 - different classrooms and supporting our
02:29 - kindgarten teachers use codable I've had
02:31 - a lot of positive feedback from teachers
02:34 - you're teaching students one of the most
02:36 - transformative subjects you could
02:37 - possibly teach them at an age where some
02:39 - of them can't even read yet there's a
02:41 - magic to that to them it's fun um and
02:44 - it's engaging and codable has great
02:46 - resources online that you can follow
02:48 - their lesson plans you can read through
02:49 - it and you can do it word by word or you
02:52 - can skim through and make it work for
02:54 - you and your students just try go with
02:56 - the Getters don't give up okay we're
02:59 - going to coach
