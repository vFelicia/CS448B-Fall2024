00:01 - whoo-hoo let's go hi I'm Doreen I'm the
00:05 - director of curriculum at codable the
00:07 - short video is going to introduce you to
00:09 - the concept you'll be teaching in this
00:10 - unit thanks for watching
00:18 - variables are used to store information
00:21 - in a program you can think of them like
00:23 - a box or a container with a label on it
00:25 - that's related to the items inside these
00:28 - items inside are called values and they
00:30 - can be stored as either numbers or text
00:32 - when you use a variable in a program you
00:35 - control the output of a program or what
00:37 - the user sees there are different types
00:40 - of variables that can be used in
00:41 - different situations strings integers
00:44 - and arrays we're going to talk about
00:47 - integers which are whole numbers that
00:49 - can be positive negative or zero in
00:52 - programming integers are values that are
00:55 - written and stored as numbers and
00:56 - they're often called int it's are used
00:59 - for two different reasons in programming
01:01 - to store values and to run leaps in our
01:04 - programs let's think about a person as a
01:07 - variable here in a real life example age
01:10 - is a value that's associated with a
01:13 - person just like a name is as we talked
01:15 - about in our string example since age is
01:18 - a value that's written as a number we
01:20 - store it that way in our code variables
01:23 - can change just like a person's age
01:25 - increases by one each year we talk to us
01:28 - students will practice strings during
01:30 - their independent practice lessons with
01:31 - variables students will apply integers
01:34 - the same way students will put a number
01:37 - in the command bin that matches the
01:39 - value to a variable assigning matching
01:42 - values will clear the asteroid field
01:44 - when the integer is launched toward the
01:46 - asteroids in this lesson my ship
01:50 - variable contains an integer and is
01:52 - going to apply that value to the
01:54 - asteroid if the value matches the
01:56 - asteroid will disappear students need to
01:59 - think critically about how to clear the
02:01 - asteroid field and as few moves as
02:03 - possible in this level I match my
02:06 - integer value with the value in the
02:08 - center of the asteroid field and the
02:10 - remaining light values touched and clear
02:12 - themselves let's talk about how ants are
02:16 - used to store values in a program by
02:18 - revisiting our video game example that
02:20 - we used for Strings
02:21 - we talked about how a character's name
02:23 - hair color and eye color are all stored
02:26 - as string
02:27 - in a videogame but what about how big a
02:29 - character is or how long her hair is
02:32 - these are all numbered values so we use
02:34 - intz to tell the computer what the
02:36 - character should look like in the
02:38 - videogame
02:38 - when the player sees it on the screen
02:41 - integers make it easy for programmers to
02:43 - reuse values in their programs ants also
02:46 - allow us to run loops by telling the
02:49 - computer how many times to complete a
02:51 - certain task this makes it easy for us
02:53 - to carry out complex processes and do so
02:56 - much more with our programs
