00:00 - hello hey guys hey expression here and
00:03 - three and we are so excited so you talk
00:07 - about the hour of code yeah it's finally
00:10 - here our favorite time of year so every
00:14 - ever like to get together with you guys
00:16 - and go over some of the things about
00:20 - what to expect
00:22 - what to expect uh for the our code what
00:27 - it is why it's important how you can
00:29 - celebrate with your students and the
00:30 - activities we put together and this year
00:33 - we have more activities than we've ever
00:35 - had before thanks to Bree she worked
00:38 - really hard I'm putting together a lot a
00:40 - lot of chiller lesson plans for you guys
00:42 - so um
00:43 - we're just going to quickly go over what
00:45 - the outer coat is and why it's exciting
00:47 - and what to expect and then we'll dive
00:50 - into some of the activities that we've
00:52 - put together and how you can get set up
00:53 - with those and we'll go from there so if
00:57 - you do have any questions as we're going
00:59 - through things I feel free to put them
01:01 - in the chat on the YouTube page you can
01:04 - see it kind of a look on the right-hand
01:06 - side I think some of the territories and
01:08 - hello some
01:11 - will be monitoring that you can also
01:14 - tweet us if you would prefer to use
01:17 - Twitter just use the hashtag kids can
01:19 - code or tweet at codable and we'll be
01:23 - sure to respond so without further ado I
01:28 - guess we'll go ahead and get started we
01:30 - will go over who we are for people who
01:32 - aren't familiar we have these pretty
01:34 - regularly so we never forget that there
01:37 - might be new people tuning in so my name
01:39 - is Gretchen Heavener I'm one of the
01:41 - founders of coda bowl I've been doing
01:44 - this and teaching kids to go for almost
01:46 - four years now so I feel like a veteran
01:53 - my third hour of code
01:55 - and it's my favorite event of the whole
01:58 - year it's just such a blast we spend the
02:02 - whole week talking with students and
02:04 - going to schools and and you know it's
02:07 - nice to get out of the office because we
02:09 - work really hard you know all day every
02:11 - day you know their heads down it's
02:13 - really fun to get out there and and you
02:16 - know
02:16 - talk to people oh
02:19 - it's my favorite time here and yeah I'm
02:22 - three I used to be a teacher I taught
02:25 - kindergarten first grade or fourth grade
02:27 - and now I your curriculum here so I work
02:31 - on resources for teachers writing lesson
02:33 - plans talking to teachers working with
02:35 - kids pretty much everything seem to make
02:38 - it easy for teachers and schools to use
02:42 - codable to teach computer science so
02:43 - yeah this is my second hour of code with
02:47 - codable and I'm excited so what you guys
02:49 - like though we have for you six I think
02:51 - I like it
02:54 - okay awesome so um I'll just quickly
02:58 - kind of go over what the art code is and
03:00 - why it's so important for getting to the
03:03 - lesson plans and I think it's important
03:06 - to note that you know we're not the only
03:09 - people participating in the hour of code
03:11 - it's a it's an I guess global movement
03:15 - started by yes a week and our code that
03:20 - org to promote computer science that you
03:23 - can chain to millions of kids I think
03:25 - it's over 200 million 250 million kids
03:28 - have already participated in the hour of
03:30 - code since they started it to cut to
03:33 - three years ago um and you know there's
03:37 - at this point I think
03:41 - probably over a hundred puts you know
03:44 - different tutorial partners and things
03:46 - that do it we've been partners with
03:48 - code.org since the very first hour of
03:50 - code and every year we grow what we
03:53 - offer and I'm sure that other people do
03:55 - too we always make it as easy as
03:58 - possible to get started because you know
04:01 - in the in the spirit of you know
04:05 - celebrating computer science education
04:07 - really good computer science is you know
04:10 - we want to make it accessible for people
04:12 - and that's really our mission at codable
04:14 - is to make computer science is
04:15 - accessible and easy as possible to get
04:17 - started teaching and so that's why we
04:20 - love the hour of code so much is because
04:21 - it's a celebration really of of all of
04:25 - that you know worldwide
04:27 - and it's a really great opportunity to
04:30 - introduce your students to you know what
04:34 - computer science is what it means to be
04:36 - a programmer what it means to be a
04:37 - computer scientist and to work with
04:40 - technology and now but it's also a
04:42 - really good opportunity to get others in
04:45 - your community involved I know a lot of
04:47 - educators use it as an opportunity to
04:50 - bring parents into the classroom to have
04:53 - a parent day where kids are coding with
04:55 - their parents and start showing off some
04:57 - of the things that they know how to do
04:59 - that really impresses their parents you
05:01 - know that they can code and figure
05:03 - things out and then it's also a really
05:05 - good opportunity to bring other people
05:08 - in the school who might be a little bit
05:11 - apprehensive about coding or I'm sure
05:13 - about it or you know they see the
05:15 - engagement or they're interested but
05:17 - they're really not sure where to start
05:19 - to just bring them in you know get them
05:21 - involved and show them you know how
05:23 - exciting it can be um the more than that
05:26 - it's a great opportunity for you to kind
05:27 - of explore what's out there in and see
05:30 - what your students enjoy and see what
05:32 - you enjoy and see how you can take this
05:36 - idea you know using computer science to
05:40 - broaden our students horizons and to
05:42 - teach things in a different way and kind
05:45 - of run the fad idea and so it's just a
05:48 - really exciting week and hopefully it
05:51 - goes beyond just just this week and
05:53 - follows through the end of the school
05:55 - year and into the spring then you know
05:57 - to next school year so that's our hope
05:59 - and that's sort of what we want to help
06:01 - you get prepared for now so I guess we
06:05 - will dive into the lessons yeah so just
06:11 - kind of walk with interesting you know
06:13 - for the hour of code our goal is to make
06:15 - this successful for everybody so this
06:17 - year we kind of decided to go with a few
06:19 - different categories of lessons um just
06:22 - to target different audiences so for
06:24 - some people this is in their first hour
06:25 - of code and you know they've already
06:27 - gone over the basics with their students
06:29 - so we thought about that as well on
06:31 - giving some more advanced concepts to
06:33 - kind of build off what you and your kids
06:35 - are you know if you're comfortable would
06:37 - you still have completely scripted
06:39 - lesson play for everything you do so um
06:42 - you know if that's something that you
06:45 - feel more comfortable with and
06:46 - everything you need is already written
06:48 - for you which is great if you feel more
06:51 - comfortable and want to branch out and
06:52 - kind of use that as a template to do
06:54 - your own thing that also works too so
06:57 - our categories this year we have
06:58 - beginner advanced concepts we partnered
07:02 - with whatever truck to do a featured
07:04 - lesson on robotics and we have
07:07 - my favorite is ela integration so for K
07:12 - through 5 we have some reading and
07:14 - writing Common Core standards that were
07:17 - having activities that teach basic
07:19 - computer science
07:21 - concepts and include ela in that so it's
07:25 - a great starter - for teachers to see
07:27 - kind of beyond the art of code how can I
07:29 - kind of integrate computer science into
07:31 - what we're already doing because we
07:33 - definitely know what a challenges is for
07:35 - teachers to find time to teach
07:36 - programming as an isolated subject so
07:40 - we're trying to make it a little easier
07:42 - for teachers to see how to integrate it
07:44 - where you're already working yeah so
07:47 - let's go ahead and take a look at ya at
07:50 - some of those yeah
07:52 - and I posted the link in the chat window
07:55 - for you guys
07:58 - to the right of the YouTube video that I
08:03 - can post that on the
08:05 - event page as well after the rocket
08:08 - webinar so let me see this
08:21 - yes that's like so what you see here is
08:25 - our hour of code page
08:27 - so at the top of this point guy really
08:30 - fast that if you are just having your
08:33 - students kind of hop on and do the game
08:36 - and just get on-screen content without
08:38 - using lesson plans this is where you're
08:40 - going to click for the area of code you
08:42 - don't need to create an account and
08:44 - register
08:45 - you don't need to create an account and
08:47 - register you'll just click play now and
08:50 - your students will be able to play um
08:52 - that's pretty basic so I want sometimes
08:54 - I'm aware that but I will show our
08:57 - categories of lesson plans that we have
09:00 - here so like I was talking about we have
09:02 - beginner programming lessons on K
09:04 - through 5 and so depending on your grade
09:07 - level they'll select one of these
09:09 - lessons um we'll look at the catering
09:12 - example here
09:14 - so these beginner lesson plans all cover
09:18 - the foundation concept of sequence so
09:22 - that won't change depending on the grade
09:24 - level but the lesson plan does differ
09:27 - across grade levels and it includes
09:29 - different kind of math
09:31 - tions and as well as different
09:34 - vocabulary materials are a little
09:36 - different so in terms of level I would
09:40 - definitely go by grade level here and
09:42 - teach the appropriate grade level but
09:45 - know that that the programming concept
09:47 - across the board here it is sequence
09:49 - that is the focus here advanced program
09:52 - and why I do it should they start since
09:55 - it's a beginner why do we start with the
09:57 - stand current questions so yeah we we
10:00 - call this our beginner category on
10:01 - because depending on experience level so
10:06 - grade level here is a very important and
10:09 - ages in either I guess because when I
10:11 - started Larry about computer programming
10:12 - I ignored that sequence first two so
10:15 - beginner is referring to the foundation
10:18 - that anyone needs to begin to learn
10:20 - about computer science so if you were to
10:22 - discuss over this beginner concept the
10:26 - rest of the material wouldn't make sense
10:27 - so it is definitely important for all
10:29 - grade levels to start here with this
10:31 - foundation before being able at their
10:34 - elements and kind of build on their
10:36 - knowledge of programming tradition so
10:39 - given that you know some some people in
10:42 - our audience I'm sure did the error code
10:44 - before I would definitely suggest
10:46 - looking over this but he may find
10:49 - yourself looking for more advanced
10:51 - concepts if you're familiar already with
10:54 - programming if you've already done a
10:56 - little for memory for students and I had
10:58 - jar advanced programming lessons a jerk
11:01 - here
11:02 - and so our advanced lessons are also
11:05 - designed for specific grade levels but
11:08 - each grade level has a different focus
11:10 - so hair garden is doing sequence first
11:13 - grade is focusing on leaps
11:14 - second-greatest focusing on functions
11:16 - then you need to third grade students
11:18 - are learning about variables and fourth
11:20 - and fifth grade then has much more
11:23 - advanced content that's actually
11:25 - includes JavaScript syntax so
11:29 - if you have not already
11:33 - I
11:35 - saved a beginner concepts like we were
11:38 - just saying because this later stuff
11:40 - will be a little too
11:43 - probable make much sense so
11:47 - you say every day with you your students
11:51 - do that later
11:59 - these lessons
12:03 - people who have a Google account have so
12:07 - if you have a code will account then it
12:10 - is material you may have already seen
12:12 - before in terms of the concepts so these
12:16 - concepts are all taught in our
12:18 - curriculum
12:20 - as normal so yeah if you have an account
12:24 - you may be a little familiar with them
12:25 - okay it could they bring me lessons
12:28 - they've already had
12:29 - yeah absolutely
12:31 - yeah the great thing during our could be
12:35 - these are free so it's definitely a
12:37 - great opportunity to take advantage of
12:40 - some higher level on free resources that
12:43 - are out there I know you know a lot of
12:45 - teachers that's always looking for that
12:47 - so yeah this is definitely a great week
12:50 - and these will be available and
12:52 - definitely awesome and then I'll jump
12:57 - down to our robotics lesson so this is
12:59 - just one lesson and you could use it K
13:02 - through fifth grade this is where we
13:05 - actually partnered with Wonder Workshop
13:07 - to incorporate one of their robots so a
13:10 - lot of our teachers who use code will
13:12 - ask us all the time time they can kind
13:15 - of work with robots or different things
13:17 - up they're using in their class we
13:18 - thought this would be a great example of
13:20 - kind of how to do that so if you do have
13:22 - robots or be BOTS or zero or any other
13:26 - kind of robotics tool that you use in
13:28 - your classroom this is a great starting
13:31 - point to see how you can kind of include
13:33 - programming concepts with your robots
13:35 - and obviously do this lesson during the
13:38 - week and then it I'm sure you'll get
13:40 - ideas for other ways you can incorporate
13:42 - programming concepts into robotics in
13:44 - your classroom beyond this week and
13:48 - then we have our ela category so each
13:52 - grade level focuses on a specific Common
13:56 - Core standard so all of our ela lessons
14:00 - are focusing on introductory programming
14:02 - concepts so that's sequence so kt5 ela
14:06 - we are learning about sequence through
14:09 - the lens of a specific
14:12 - common core standards so that's
14:13 - obviously different for each grade level
14:15 - but they you do need to include an
14:17 - reading and writing element and T really
14:20 - have any students examine ways that they
14:22 - already use sequence and then kind of
14:25 - how that relates to programming so I
14:27 - really like this category of lessons I
14:29 - think it's a great starting point to see
14:32 - kind of how do you can teach programming
14:35 - everyday in your classroom whether
14:38 - that's dedicated type of programming or
14:39 - not and go beyond my hour of code and
14:42 - really in computer science what you
14:45 - already do day to day awesome do you
14:49 - think you can quickly walk through one
14:50 - of the lesson plans just sitting again
14:52 - maybe another structure yeah absolutely
14:54 - let's take a look at our kindergarten la
14:58 - lesson so all of our lesson plans are
15:01 - structured this way our code and not
15:04 - artful curriculum structured this way on
15:07 - the left-hand side you'll always see
15:09 - kind of a little overview of the
15:11 - information week for the lessons so how
15:14 - about it we'll take what concept is
15:16 - being covered materials materials that
15:19 - you need will always be included here so
15:21 - if it's a graphic organizer if it's a an
15:25 - exit ticket if it's um I'm going to
15:28 - worksheets here in this case sentence
15:30 - puzzles that you'll cut up and have
15:32 - students put together when you click
15:35 - this blue download teaching materials
15:36 - everything will be there free and all
15:38 - you'll have to do is print it so across
15:41 - the board all of our lessons call for
15:43 - you know materials but you will never
15:45 - not have what you need and you can print
15:48 - what your the lesson plan here as well
15:50 - so the objectives for the lesson I are
15:54 - always listed at the top in this case
15:56 - there's Common Core alignment so we've
15:58 - highlighted that for you to what
15:59 - standards are being worked on and then
16:03 - the lesson has an opening direct
16:06 - instruction where you'll teach the
16:08 - concept
16:09 - guided practice in this case they'll be
16:12 - practicing with the sentence puzzles
16:13 - letter included and then independent
16:15 - practice so for the hour of code ela
16:19 - lessons structures a little different in
16:21 - that it that practice is not on screen
16:24 - you may find in other lessons that the
16:27 - practice is kind of allowed who use the
16:30 - on-screen lessons for students to
16:31 - practice but during the hour of code for
16:34 - ela we actually have been doing that as
16:36 - a closing activity so every lesson will
16:39 - have practice on screen it just may look
16:42 - a little different in the lessees cycle
16:43 - depending on the category for our core
16:46 - lessons and for the on-screen portion
16:49 - yak is on screen portion can we go over
16:53 - where to send them yes great question
16:56 - okay cool so for this this section here
17:00 - which is a closing exit ticket this is
17:03 - really start PLA lessons but every other
17:06 - lesson as well it's going to have levels
17:09 - in critical that relate to the lesson
17:13 - that you just taught so I'll just show
17:16 - you guys really quickly where to send
17:18 - your kids once you finish the lesson and
17:20 - they're ready to you know get started
17:23 - coding and get the devices out you're
17:26 - going to send them to
17:28 - this link here where it says play now
17:31 - that's gonna open game that global
17:34 - column / hour of code and they can
17:39 - either play without saving if you don't
17:42 - have a quota Bowl account you haven't
17:44 - set up a teacher account and you want
17:46 - them this is just kind of a one-time
17:48 - thing just for fun or if you're just
17:51 - getting your feet wet you can have your
17:52 - kids play without saving that will take
17:54 - them directly into the game and they
17:56 - just get going and for anything that's
17:59 - covering sequence sequence it's going to
18:01 - automatically take them to the relevant
18:02 - levels if you do have a class code and
18:05 - you do have a teacher account already
18:07 - set up you can also have them log in
18:09 - here with that they're just gonna click
18:11 - and play with class put your student
18:13 - code and into their class code as normal
18:15 - like they normally would and that's you
18:19 - know how you eat them started if you're
18:20 - going to be using
18:22 - the iPad or an Android device or your
18:27 - desktops the downloaded version on a
18:30 - Windows PC or a Mac it's going to look
18:34 - slightly different you're going to have
18:36 - to use a class code or a student code or
18:39 - create a new new profile for them on
18:43 - that device but I think that you all are
18:45 - probably familiar with how to do that
18:47 - because you've probably already
18:49 - downloaded codable ahead of time so I
18:51 - would suggest as walking you through
18:53 - that process
18:54 - on your own ahead ahead of the class so
18:58 - that you know
18:59 - you know how to get them signed on but
19:01 - it's all pretty simple just like this
19:04 - although I'm going to show you what it
19:06 - looks like to log in with a class code
19:08 - so that if this is something you're
19:09 - interested in doing you can see how easy
19:11 - it is for them to get signed in so my
19:14 - class code is famous class I
19:17 - just type that in
19:20 - and then I can select my name from the
19:23 - list of students Here I am
19:31 - and
19:33 - then I can automatically resume my
19:35 - progress from where I left off before so
19:38 - the great benefit of having a class code
19:40 - is that your students progress always
19:42 - saves and they can log in from any
19:44 - device just by using that class code and
19:47 - selecting their name so if I wanted to
19:49 - continue all I have to do is press play
19:51 - and it's gonna resume where I left off
19:52 - before so yeah that time could get your
19:56 - students logged in you can see it's
19:58 - really simple if you do have a class
20:01 - code you just kind of get them off and
20:02 - rolling
20:03 - haha
20:05 - anyway oh cool so I have one other thing
20:09 - I should mention is that this URL with
20:13 - your roster can also be saved on your
20:15 - class website if you want to so it's
20:19 - just game fat clinical column slash
20:21 - slash and then your class code and
20:24 - that's your unique URL so you don't want
20:26 - them to have to type in the class code
20:28 - every time you can just save this URL as
20:31 - students can just click on their name to
20:32 - get started so it's pretty simple to
20:34 - remember just game back google.com slash
20:38 - class and then your class code and it's
20:41 - also on your teacher dashboard you can
20:42 - find that as well so um
20:45 - that's really all you need to know as
20:47 - far as it getting set up and what we're
20:49 - offering as far as lesson plans feel
20:52 - free to look through all of these lesson
20:55 - plans that we had available so that you
20:57 - can kind of see you know what would fit
21:01 - best for your students
21:05 - so you can see what would fit best for
21:07 - your students you know your kids the
21:09 - best you know what level they're at and
21:12 - so you can decide you know what would
21:14 - fit their needs
21:16 - we have a question coming in and sure so
21:19 - if someone has an excess of classes like
21:22 - 30 classes for example is there an easy
21:24 - way to add all their students or you
21:26 - need to have separate classes that's a
21:28 - great question so if you want to import
21:31 - all of your students for the hour of
21:33 - code and you want to have the progress
21:35 - saved whatever they were doing for the
21:38 - hour of code I would suggest importing
21:41 - your classes using Google classroom if
21:44 - you don't have that set up you can log
21:47 - in with your Google account and then
21:49 - there's an option when you create a
21:51 - class to import your classes in bulk and
21:56 - that will actually give you the option
21:57 - to import all of your Google classroom
21:58 - classes if you don't have Google
22:01 - classroom setup you can still bulk
22:03 - import you just have to copy and paste
22:05 - your rosters from a spreadsheet so
22:09 - whenever you go to create a class in
22:12 - your teacher dashboard you'll actually
22:13 - see both the bulk import option and
22:17 - being able to set up all your classes in
22:19 - one swoop instead of having to do 30
22:22 - separate classes that would take all day
22:24 - so you want to make it really simple for
22:26 - you so yes there is a way to do it
22:28 - pretty quickly and painlessly
22:31 - and that would be my suggestion you know
22:33 - you can set up class codes and
22:35 - everything there too so you can come up
22:38 - with you know a unique structure or how
22:39 - you want your class codes to work
22:41 - usually if something simple and easy to
22:43 - remember like the name of your school
22:45 - and the remember is really easy and that
22:49 - way they all have you know a memorable
22:51 - class code
22:53 - we can you can do a custom one by us no
22:56 - but it's just going to be a random set
22:58 - of numbers and letters so we don't
23:00 - usually write them in line
23:03 - any other questions
23:20 - okay cool so
23:22 - what so I think that the next thing that
23:26 - we should make me go over is kind of
23:29 - what to expect on the day of when we
23:31 - hell to be prepared for the inevitable
23:34 - Oh
23:36 - technical issues that may come up and I
23:40 - think you know you can expect a lot of
23:42 - excitement the kids are gonna be really
23:44 - pumped teachers that skim them you can
23:47 - because energy in the air everybody you
23:49 - know I mean you know how this when you
23:50 - do something different in the school day
23:52 - people are a little bit off then they're
23:54 - just like really thrilled to be doing
23:56 - something out of the norm so there's
23:59 - gonna be a ton of excitement just kind
24:02 - of go with the flow if you have
24:03 - something coming up a technical issue
24:05 - there's going to be a lot of people on
24:07 - every website so you know people are
24:10 - doing out globally I know I know we've
24:14 - done a lot to prepare for the amount of
24:17 - traffic that we're going to expect so
24:18 - you know we don't expect to have any
24:20 - issues but if you're using something
24:21 - else they may go down
24:23 - have an unplugged activity as a backup
24:26 - all of our lessons include an uncooked
24:30 - portion that group practice so you
24:35 - should be fine there if you're using any
24:37 - of our lesson plans but if you do have
24:39 - you know an on screen lesson plan for
24:41 - your students be sure to have an
24:43 - unfucked activity prepared as a backup
24:46 - if you're using iOS codable on iOS a
24:52 - downloaded version on your desktop or if
24:56 - you're using the Android version you
24:58 - won't have any problems accessing
24:59 - potable it can all be played offline so
25:03 - you should be fine there if you're using
25:05 - the web version
25:07 - I would test it out in in your classroom
25:09 - just to make sure that you don't have
25:11 - any firewalls or anything they're going
25:13 - to come up the day of you know just test
25:15 - it out the week before just to make sure
25:18 - that you hear commands can all access it
25:20 - um and yeah just be pumped and excited
25:24 - and ready to to share um you know some
25:28 - exciting experiences with your kids I
25:30 - think one other thing that is always fun
25:33 - to mention is
25:35 - the story of Grace Hopper who is
25:38 - actually the inspiration for
25:41 - CSM weakening our code she is an admiral
25:44 - in the US Navy and she was the person
25:48 - who invented the first compiler which is
25:50 - the part of the computer that converts
25:53 - by a coding language into binary so that
25:56 - the computer can read it and understand
25:58 - it and she was just an awesome really
26:02 - cool inspiring lady and her birthday is
26:05 - December 9th and so the error code is
26:08 - actually
26:09 - CSI week is actually inspired by her and
26:13 - meant to sort of celebrate her life and
26:16 - you know everything that she brought to
26:18 - the wrong with computer science and to
26:22 - help more kids learn about computer
26:24 - science by celebrating her life so it's
26:28 - kind of a fun story to share with your
26:30 - students we have a
26:34 - follows in codable named after her
26:37 - soccer and Gracie buzz and then you have
26:40 - an account America lesson but a journey
26:43 - equitable user there is a lesson on
26:45 - Grace Hopper Islam yeah that's exciting
26:48 - um which section is it the newest loops
26:52 - okay cool um yeah so if you're a Google
26:55 - user look for the lesson on loops about
26:57 - Grace Hopper if that's something that
26:59 - interests you um yeah and then the only
27:01 - other thing is if you are interested in
27:04 - having one of us talk to your students
27:06 - the week of the our code we are taking
27:09 - applications it's a crazy week for us
27:12 - and you know we have tight schedule but
27:14 - we are letting people apply through
27:18 - Wednesday to have us talk with your
27:21 - class so if that's something that you're
27:22 - interested in doing
27:24 - we'll post the link on the YouTube page
27:26 - so that you can you know just send us
27:29 - your information I'll get back to you
27:30 - after Wednesday about our availability
27:33 - so I think that's everything you think
27:36 - of something else know if any issues
27:39 - come up during you know this week or
27:41 - next is your preparing you can reach out
27:45 - to us at support we have a help desk
27:48 - we'll put the link that helped us it's
27:50 - probably going to be useful if you're
27:53 - setting up an account if you're just
27:54 - using this for the arrow put it on the
27:56 - couch many questions sort of GRE just
27:58 - giving an account and getting started
28:00 - well whoever our help desk link there
28:03 - that might answer some onboarding
28:04 - questions and yeah we're very available
28:06 - so yep you're all back we're so excited
28:10 - so we're all hands on deck that day and
28:14 - like Bri was saying if you are setting
28:17 - up a quotable account it is something we
28:19 - recommend if you're at all interested in
28:22 - going beyond just this week you know
28:25 - coding if they if you're thinking of
28:26 - taking it beyond you know this week and
28:30 - going in January and into this rain we
28:32 - definitely recommend having your account
28:34 - set up and answering your students you
28:36 - make that process really really simple
28:38 - so you know it takes probably less than
28:41 - five minutes to give it all set up I
28:44 - definitely recommend taking a look at
28:46 - that at least if it's something you're
28:47 - interested in so and again if you can
28:50 - always ask this week that question so if
28:52 - nobody else has any questions then I
28:55 - guess we'll go let you guys have your
28:57 - Monday evening we'll wait a minute or so
29:01 - and see if there's anything else but
29:02 - we're so excited so we do have one
29:05 - question coming in right um let's see
29:09 - does the online portion of the hour of
29:11 - code starting the same level for every
29:13 - crate what percentage of the Eriko
29:15 - should be online so the online portion
29:19 - differs depending on the grade level
29:23 - however for the beginner concepts is
29:27 - the singing levels for sequence so
29:30 - actually K through 3 I think it is just
29:33 - as the first part of sequence fourth and
29:36 - fifth does more so because they're older
29:39 - the moves you're less this more quickly
29:41 - so they in the last place it says to
29:44 - have them do ten levels versus five so
29:48 - you'll see that difference and then
29:50 - obviously for the advanced concepts they
29:52 - are different for grade level and
29:54 - they're different concepts so they'll be
29:56 - working on different on-screen lessons
29:57 - in terms of percentage most of the
30:00 - lesson is meant to be unplugged so
30:03 - probably about 10 minutes of on-screen
30:05 - practice I would say 10 minutes of
30:07 - screen time for lesson but you can kind
30:10 - of change that as it fits your class
30:12 - range so that's really a you know you
30:15 - know your students you know how long
30:16 - they'll need for an unemployed less
30:18 - aggressive screen time and yeah that's
30:21 - totally your call but we recommend about
30:23 - 10 minutes of on-street practice per
30:25 - lesson yeah so it's about out of an hour
30:27 - so yeah ten twenty ten to fifteen book a
30:31 - lesson the direct instruction then like
30:34 - 20-ish run close and then about ten
30:38 - online so you have a nice little rounded
30:42 - listen yeah
30:45 - and the other questions out there you
30:58 - don't have anything else where anything
31:01 - else on YouTube
31:03 - all right awesome well thank you all so
31:07 - much we really enjoyed it and we are so
31:10 - playing yeah we'll see you next week see
31:13 - you next week bye these guys
