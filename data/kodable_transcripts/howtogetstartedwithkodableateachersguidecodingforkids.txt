00:05 - i'm hannah your instructional coach in
00:07 - this short video we'll talk about how to
00:09 - get started with codable
00:11 - there's only two steps before we start
00:15 - make sure that you have your teacher
00:16 - account set up with your classes and
00:18 - students
00:19 - now let's get into it step 1
00:23 - set up devices if your students are
00:26 - using ios devices like an ipad
00:28 - you can download the free app from the
00:30 - app store
00:32 - for all other devices students will log
00:34 - in using a web browser
00:36 - so just make sure there's internet step
00:39 - 2
00:39 - get students logged in
00:43 - students need a class code to play this
00:46 - code is like a class password that
00:48 - unlocks the codeable game
00:50 - after they enter the class code they
00:52 - simply need to find their name on the
00:53 - list
00:54 - and click it that's it they'll be logged
00:56 - into codable and ready to go
00:58 - we know getting started with a new
01:00 - program can be a lot to process
01:02 - so here's a few tips to make it easier
01:05 - [Music]
01:06 - we automatically unlock the available
01:09 - codeable game levels when you sign up
01:11 - this means that once students are logged
01:13 - in they can start coding right away
01:15 - scaffolded levels gradually increase in
01:18 - difficulty
01:19 - and creative projects allow students to
01:21 - apply their newfound knowledge in a
01:23 - personal way
01:24 - you will see students quickly catch on
01:26 - get engaged and make progress
01:28 - right from the start there's no prep
01:30 - required from you
