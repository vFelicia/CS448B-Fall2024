00:00 - your coding mission is to design a
00:03 - Halloween costume for a fuzz family
00:05 - member all you need is codable and some
00:08 - determination ready to go keep watching
00:12 - three two one
00:17 - [Music]
00:22 - it's fall in photopia the leaves are
00:25 - changing the weather is chillier and
00:27 - while you've been at school the fuzz
00:29 - family has also been hard at work
00:30 - exploring the universe well here's the
00:33 - problem the fuzzes have been so busy on
00:36 - their Adventures they completely forgot
00:38 - that their most favorite part about fall
00:40 - is right around the corner Halloween
00:44 - the fuzzes love Halloween especially
00:46 - dressing up and trick-or-treating around
00:48 - fistopia
00:49 - but with all the excitement of their
00:51 - Adventures they each completely forgot
00:53 - to pick out a costume this year
00:55 - the fuzz family needs your help
00:58 - Halloween is fast approaching they don't
01:00 - have a lot of time to throw together
01:02 - their costumes and they know you've been
01:04 - practicing your coding skills
01:06 - will you help design a Halloween costume
01:09 - for a fuzz
01:11 - before you get started think about this
01:14 - when you go trick-or-treating are all
01:16 - the other kids wearing the exact same
01:18 - costume as you no way everyone is
01:22 - dressed up in something different based
01:24 - on their own interests
01:25 - think about a costume you've worn in the
01:27 - past or one you plan to wear this year
01:29 - why did you pick it it's probably based
01:33 - on something you like and makes you
01:35 - happy
01:36 - just like humans fuzzes also have things
01:39 - they like
01:40 - fuzz wants to dress up in a Halloween
01:43 - costume that brings them happiness and
01:45 - lets them Express themselves
01:47 - for example Simon is obsessed with all
01:51 - things spooky think pumpkins and bats
01:55 - and ghosts
01:57 - Violet's favorite thing is being outside
01:59 - she loves flowers and trees and she
02:02 - wants a costume that is inspired by
02:04 - Nature
02:06 - blue loves animals big small striped and
02:10 - spotted he likes them all so much he
02:13 - just can't decide which one to be
02:15 - and checkers wants to make others laugh
02:18 - with a costume that is super silly it
02:21 - can be random wacky or ridiculous the
02:23 - sillier the better
02:25 - here's your mission design a Halloween
02:28 - costume for one of these fuzzes the
02:31 - costume should be inspired by the things
02:33 - they like
02:34 - you can pause the video here to think
02:37 - about which fuzz you want to design for
02:40 - ready to go here's how to start
02:43 - log into codable and select fuzz Builder
02:46 - this building unlocks at code rank 4.
02:51 - give your Fez a name
02:54 - now here's the fun part you can choose a
02:57 - body eyes mouth items and hats to build
03:01 - out the fuzz costume
03:03 - for example I will create a costume for
03:06 - Violet
03:07 - remember Violet wants something nature
03:09 - inspired
03:10 - so I might choose green eyes because
03:12 - they're the color of the trees
03:16 - and rose-colored lips
03:22 - as for items I think she'd love this
03:24 - flower costume
03:27 - and for hats a flower crown is perfect
03:33 - let's add two
03:35 - I wonder if you will find any other
03:38 - nature items that Violet would love
03:43 - now it's your turn
03:45 - the coatable and head to the fuzz
03:46 - Builder
03:48 - then design a dream Halloween costume
03:50 - for one of the fuzzes and complete your
03:53 - mission
03:55 - there are so many costume combos to
03:57 - choose from and we want to see what you
03:59 - come up with
04:00 - [Music]
04:02 - have a grown-up help you post a picture
04:04 - on social media be sure to tag us at
04:07 - codable and we'll repost some of our
04:09 - favorites
04:11 - from all of us here at codable have a
04:13 - fuzz-tastic Halloween
