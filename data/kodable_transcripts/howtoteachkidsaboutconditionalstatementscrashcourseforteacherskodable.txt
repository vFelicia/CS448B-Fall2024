00:01 - whoo-hoo let's go hi I'm Doreen I'm the
00:05 - director of curriculum at codable the
00:07 - short video is going to introduce you to
00:09 - the concept you'll be teaching in this
00:10 - unit thanks for watching
00:17 - as programmers we're in control of every
00:21 - action a computer carries out once
00:23 - commands are given to a computer in the
00:25 - correct sequence we can add another
00:27 - element to our code that will alter the
00:28 - computer programs path condition
00:30 - conditions are basic if the logic
00:33 - statements that modify how code is
00:34 - executed conditions are a key part of
00:37 - the decision making process for
00:38 - computers conditional statements are
00:41 - part of our everyday lives as people we
00:44 - can think about situations and make
00:45 - decisions based on what we observe or
00:47 - know to be true for example if it's
00:49 - raining out then we will have recess
00:51 - inside or if it's my birthday then I can
00:54 - have birthday cake
00:55 - conditions are cause-and-effect if this
00:57 - then that since computers are machines
01:01 - that can't do anything without us
01:02 - directing them we direct the computer
01:04 - using conditional statements this tells
01:06 - the computer what to do and when to do
01:08 - it in the conditions on screen
01:11 - independent practice lessons students
01:13 - will use colored tiles as conditions to
01:15 - alter the path of their fuzz for example
01:18 - if the tile is pink then go down in
01:22 - programming a great example of a
01:24 - condition is a password
01:25 - passwords are if-then logic statements
01:28 - if a user enters the correct password
01:31 - then they can access the program
01:34 - conditions allow us to control what a
01:36 - program does and perform different
01:38 - actions based on these ifs and logic
01:40 - statements what makes computer programs
01:42 - great is their ability to interact with
01:44 - the user this is only possible with
01:46 - conditions that direct this type of
01:48 - interaction
