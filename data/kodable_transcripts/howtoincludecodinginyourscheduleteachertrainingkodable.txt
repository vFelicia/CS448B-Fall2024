00:16 - taking stock of your setting
00:18 - like when and where you will see your
00:19 - students for coding
00:21 - is one of the crucial first steps uh
00:24 - when starting coding curriculum with
00:25 - your students
00:26 - and this is because how and where you
00:28 - choose to go about teaching will really
00:31 - help inform
00:32 - again what platform you choose the tools
00:34 - you incorporate and how you structure
00:35 - your lessons
00:37 - so i'm going to walk through six
00:38 - different settings or
00:40 - use cases that you might choose to
00:42 - explore you might choose to use coding
00:45 - in
00:46 - and this is to show you that no matter
00:48 - where you're teaching or how much time
00:50 - you have for coding with students
00:51 - each week or month or year you can be
00:55 - successful
00:55 - you can make it work and if you want
00:57 - more stories from
00:59 - real coding teachers who were either
01:02 - trying it for the first time or were
01:03 - somewhat new to the field
01:05 - we have some really great case studies
01:06 - on our website and i'll ask brie to drop
01:08 - a link
01:09 - as well so you can reference some some
01:12 - stories from real teachers so they can
01:14 - tell you how it's going as opposed to
01:15 - just
01:16 - hearing the use cases from me so the
01:19 - first setting
01:20 - is direct instruction the setting here
01:23 - is likely a classroom
01:25 - and the educator who is utilizing direct
01:27 - instruction
01:28 - i would say is likely a either a tech
01:30 - specific teacher
01:31 - perhaps a librarian who oversees
01:34 - tech instruction for a large group of
01:37 - students or
01:39 - a classroom teacher that teaches
01:41 - multiple subjects and has
01:43 - you know designated computer science
01:45 - time where they're hoping to
01:47 - teach coding in a structured lesson with
01:49 - some sort of
01:50 - you know targeted outcome similar to how
01:52 - they teach their other
01:53 - subjects so how does kids coding
01:57 - look in this setting i'll just walk
01:59 - through like a
02:00 - an example session it could start with
02:04 - a five to ten minute introduction about
02:06 - the topic for the day
02:07 - this could be in the form of a short
02:09 - video perhaps
02:10 - it's a slide deck where you're
02:12 - introducing
02:14 - what today's topic is perhaps sequence
02:17 - for example
02:18 - then there could be some sort of
02:20 - collaborative activity
02:22 - maybe it's a group brainstorm a think
02:24 - pair share
02:25 - a kwl chart a mind map something that
02:29 - is incorporating some group think
02:32 - related to the topic of the day then
02:34 - teachers can
02:36 - transition to tech devices if you have
02:38 - them or
02:39 - unplugged resources if you have those
02:41 - where students will be
02:42 - making something with code related to
02:45 - the topic in the introduction
02:47 - and then there's typically some sort of
02:49 - wrap up at the end maybe it's a debrief
02:51 - discussion
02:52 - an exit ticket etc so that's just a
02:55 - quick example of what direct instruction
02:57 - with coding
02:58 - might look like pretty similar to how we
03:00 - would teach any other
03:01 - subject and if this is desirable for you
03:04 - you have the time and the space to make
03:06 - this happen then you'll want to look for
03:08 - resources that provide
03:10 - a similar level of detailed support
03:13 - because again
03:13 - introducing something new can take some
03:15 - time and there are resources out there
03:17 - that have already done
03:18 - the heavy lifting for you so i know
03:20 - code.org has some good
03:22 - scripted lessons at codable we also have
03:25 - some scripted lesson plans that include
03:28 - you know a section for a direct
03:29 - instruction and a group activity
03:31 - and the debrief all scripted out so
03:35 - those are resources that you can find
03:37 - and follow so you don't have to
03:39 - spend a ton of time planning
03:42 - the next setting that we'll talk about
03:44 - is coding in centers and
03:46 - in stations again the setting here is
03:49 - likely a classroom but this could work
03:51 - well
03:51 - with even a large number of students
03:54 - maybe an after school club
03:56 - or a camp and i'd say that the type of
03:59 - educator that is employing centers or
04:02 - stations in their classroom
04:04 - is likely a teacher that might want to
04:06 - cover multiple subjects or activities
04:08 - at once because in a station-based
04:11 - classroom there's multiple stations
04:13 - multiple centers
04:14 - where kids are working on different
04:16 - activities or projects
04:18 - so it's a great option for teachers who
04:20 - want to
04:21 - have multiple activities or cover
04:23 - multiple topics at one time
04:25 - or it's also really great for educators
04:28 - who
04:29 - might need or want to give specialized
04:31 - support to a specific group of students
04:34 - or around a certain activity or
04:37 - assignment
04:37 - and that way the teacher can sit with
04:39 - one group while other groups in the
04:41 - classroom are
04:42 - busy working on other projects
04:45 - so centers are implemented again by
04:48 - any any type of teacher can do them in
04:50 - mostly any setting but i'll walk through
04:53 - what like a potential format could look
04:56 - like for you if you wanted to
04:57 - introduce coding to this setting as well
05:00 - so it would start with some sort of an
05:02 - introduction about what centers are
05:04 - available today
05:05 - perhaps you have four math centers
05:08 - and one coding center and the teacher
05:10 - will be sitting at a certain table to
05:12 - help with a specific math content
05:14 - math activity and coding is is out there
05:17 - at one of the other stations
05:19 - perhaps as the teacher you would do a
05:21 - short demo of each center so kids are
05:23 - prepared they know what to expect
05:25 - and you'd split the class into small
05:26 - groups and then you would have some sort
05:29 - of time
05:29 - interval where you're keeping track of
05:31 - structured time
05:33 - and students have a task that they're
05:34 - working to complete or
05:36 - some sort of project perhaps they don't
05:38 - need to complete it but they're working
05:40 - on something at each station and when
05:41 - the time is up
05:42 - they'll move on to the next and as
05:45 - students rotate
05:46 - a new group will head over to coding
05:50 - and you could be teaching other content
05:52 - as well so this is an awesome option if
05:54 - you
05:54 - can't carve out specific coding time you
05:57 - know you want to incorporate it but you
05:59 - don't know how you're going to make it
06:00 - happen on its own
06:01 - with centers you can invite students to
06:03 - code as one option
06:05 - while other students in the class are
06:06 - doing another activity like math or
06:08 - writing
06:09 - et cetera and i would say coding
06:11 - activities that work really well
06:13 - in this type of setting are ones that
06:15 - keep kids engaged and motivated
06:18 - so gamified learning is is really
06:20 - awesome in this setting
06:22 - something that is going to keep the kids
06:25 - engaged
06:25 - so that as the teacher you can support
06:27 - other students in the class
06:29 - this means that the program that you're
06:31 - using with coding should also be
06:33 - more child-directed and codable would be
06:36 - one example since it is a game-based
06:38 - platform
06:39 - we've seen it be really successful in
06:41 - centers where kids can
06:42 - be working on the quotable game and
06:44 - teachers can be doing another center
06:46 - with students and both can exist at the
06:48 - same time
06:49 - next up uh one that we are likely
06:53 - all familiar with at this stage in 2021
06:55 - and that is
06:56 - virtual learning virtual learning was
06:59 - obviously vital during the 2020 school
07:02 - year
07:02 - and if you taught students virtually
07:04 - during this time
07:06 - so online not in a in a building or a
07:08 - classroom
07:10 - i'm sure you've already heard this but
07:13 - let me just say really quickly i'm so
07:14 - impressed with the innovation that you
07:15 - all
07:16 - showed and i saw a positive come out of
07:19 - the chaos of virtual learning which was
07:21 - that teachers and students had to get a
07:23 - lot more comfortable with
07:24 - online learning tools i talked to a ton
07:27 - of teachers who were using platforms
07:28 - like
07:29 - nearpod or seesaw which is in this
07:31 - picture or
07:32 - google classroom to connect with
07:34 - students throughout the year and provide
07:37 - online learning opportunities so even
07:40 - though
07:41 - we hopefully will not go back to a full
07:43 - shutdown situation anytime soon
07:45 - my guess is that a lot of you will still
07:47 - be utilizing
07:49 - virtual learning environments like
07:50 - google classroom or seesaw in the future
07:52 - even when you're face to face in the
07:54 - classroom
07:56 - in this scenario for virtual learning
07:58 - your setting could be
08:00 - a virtual classroom it could be a
08:02 - face-to-face classroom
08:03 - it could be you know a summer camp or a
08:05 - tutoring center
08:07 - and virtual learning is awesome because
08:09 - you can offer it to
08:11 - tons of students or a small group or
08:13 - even one-to-one
08:15 - what does kids coding look like in this
08:17 - setting you'll want to
08:19 - pick a coding platform let's say you
08:21 - pick codable and you
08:22 - want to try it you sign up most
08:25 - platforms like codable will have some
08:26 - sort of login
08:27 - instructions or like a code students
08:30 - will need to enter somewhere a password
08:32 - so you'll want to make sure you gather
08:34 - those instructions
08:36 - and then you send it along to students
08:38 - via
08:39 - whatever method you choose so google
08:41 - classroom seesaw
08:43 - etc and students will open that
08:45 - assignment and complete it
08:47 - the nature of coding platforms being
08:49 - primarily online would make this
08:51 - a really smooth choice
08:54 - so if you have younger students or even
08:57 - older students too
08:58 - there may be a time in your classroom
09:00 - for free play i know that when i was a
09:02 - teacher
09:03 - there was time for free play sometimes
09:04 - following a quiz or during a rainy day
09:06 - recess
09:07 - or when we all needed a little bit of a
09:09 - break and
09:10 - during this free time teachers
09:14 - myself included would want the
09:16 - activities to still be educational
09:18 - in some manner but also really fun and
09:21 - exploratory
09:22 - and coding is a wonderful option for
09:24 - free play as i mentioned earlier
09:26 - you'll likely want to find coding
09:27 - activities that are like extra fun
09:29 - so ones that are game-based or
09:31 - open-ended so that children can choose
09:33 - what they're working on it is free play
09:35 - which means free choice so you'll want
09:37 - something that
09:39 - children can choose and also something
09:40 - that doesn't require a ton
09:42 - of teacher supports again free play is
09:44 - an example of an open-ended learning
09:46 - environment where
09:47 - you don't want to be getting asked a ton
09:49 - of questions all the time
09:51 - what might coding look like in this
09:52 - setting children working at their own
09:54 - pace
09:55 - working on challenges or puzzles like on
09:57 - an ipad or a chromebook
09:59 - and project-based learning is great here
10:01 - i saw that brie posted a link to one of
10:02 - our blogs about project-based learning
10:05 - if you have questions about that please
10:07 - reach out to me directly i'm happy to
10:09 - to give any tips but codable for example
10:12 - has a maze maker
10:14 - creative project where kids can make
10:16 - mazes and then give them to their
10:17 - classmates to
10:18 - play so that's like encouraging
10:20 - collaboration and
10:21 - is a lot of choice based learning so
10:23 - that's one example of
10:25 - of how you can have free play but also
10:27 - incorporate educational
10:29 - content two more settings to go over the
10:32 - first is hour of code
10:34 - if you don't know what it is the hour of
10:36 - code is a super exciting
10:38 - worldwide event that takes place during
10:40 - computer science week which is typically
10:42 - the second week of december each year
10:45 - and the goal of the hour of code is to
10:47 - introduce computer science to as many
10:49 - children as possible
10:52 - if you want to start coding with
10:53 - students but you really don't think you
10:55 - have the time
10:56 - or the resources to make it happen
10:59 - earlier in the school year
11:01 - then setting up a plan to start with an
11:03 - hour of code
11:04 - would be a perfect solution what does
11:07 - coding look like for the hour of code
11:08 - well it would start with you
11:10 - picking an activity that looks
11:12 - interesting for you and your students
11:14 - i know that we have a codable page with
11:17 - all of our hour of code activities
11:19 - there's also some excellent hour of code
11:21 - activities that you can find on the
11:23 - code.org
11:24 - website they're the ones who host the
11:26 - hour of code
11:28 - so after you find something that looks
11:29 - interesting again it's one hour
11:32 - of time you gather the necessary
11:34 - materials typically this might just be
11:36 - the tech devices you're going to use but
11:38 - for some there might be a worksheet or
11:40 - something else that you want to gather
11:42 - your next step would be to like hype it
11:44 - up get kids excited it's a really
11:46 - cool event that so many kids participate
11:49 - in at the same time
11:50 - and then you'll do your hour of code one
11:52 - hour coding activity
11:54 - and then you'll see how it went and if
11:56 - your kids loved it you can start to
11:57 - think about doing more of them
11:59 - throughout the year
12:00 - the hour of code can happen any day
12:03 - it does not have to be just during
12:04 - december but that is when
12:07 - a lot of different companies and
12:09 - teachers will be providing webinars and
12:11 - trainings and teacher guides and
12:13 - activities because it's computer science
12:15 - education week
12:16 - so that's a great time to start so again
12:18 - make that plan
12:19 - if you don't want to incorporate coding
12:20 - throughout the beginning of the school
12:22 - year the hour of code is something
12:23 - really fun to look forward to
12:25 - and i highly recommend exploring hour of
12:27 - code resources
12:29 - if that's a good place for you to start
12:32 - and last but not least is unplugged
12:34 - coding this could be
12:36 - the setting could be your classroom it
12:37 - might be an after-school club
12:40 - maybe you do unplugged coding for
12:42 - homework or
12:43 - an outdoor education project basically
12:46 - unplugged coding includes
12:48 - worksheets like shown above but it might
12:50 - also include physical
12:51 - hands-on activities that do not require
12:54 - a device or pen or paper so an example
12:58 - at codable we have an unplugged activity
13:01 - in one of our lesson plans where
13:03 - students will pair up and one student
13:06 - will be
13:06 - the programmer the coder and one student
13:08 - will act as the robot or the computer
13:11 - and the programmer will give the robot
13:15 - as specific instructions as they can to
13:18 - have them do different movements
13:20 - and it's a good way to test out if your
13:22 - instructions are
13:23 - clear enough and in the proper order
13:25 - which again is a huge
13:27 - important factor in coding so that's one
13:29 - example of an unplugged activity that
13:31 - might not be a work a worksheet
13:32 - but is still reinforcing the coding
13:34 - concepts coding in this setting might
13:36 - look like
13:38 - some sort of an introduction a direct
13:40 - instruction where you're introducing a
13:41 - concept like
13:42 - sequence and giving some sort of short
13:45 - video
13:46 - or introductory slide deck
13:49 - then you would launch into your
13:50 - unplugged activity it might be a group
13:52 - activity a partner activity
13:55 - whatever you wish and then again some
13:57 - sort of wrap up at the end so this will
13:59 - look kind of similar to direct
14:00 - instruction but coding
14:02 - unplugged can be during brain breaks it
14:04 - might be like a five
14:06 - minute exit ticket where you do a short
14:08 - unplugged coding
14:09 - worksheet so those are just some
14:11 - examples
14:13 - and there are a lot of resources online
14:15 - if you google unplugged coding
14:16 - activities
14:18 - some companies do have structured units
14:20 - that are made up entirely of unplugged
14:22 - lessons
14:23 - so i know we have this at codable for
14:25 - schools
14:26 - and code.org has some unplugged lessons
14:28 - as well
14:29 - there are resources out there if you
14:31 - don't have tech devices and that is
14:32 - something that you're interested in
