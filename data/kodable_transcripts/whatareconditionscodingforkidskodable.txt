00:01 - let's go think about a day at school or
00:07 - at home you probably have some rules to
00:10 - follow right when you're at school you
00:13 - likely have a set of classroom rules
00:15 - like where you can put your belongings
00:17 - how to line up to go to lunch or when
00:20 - you can leave the classroom at home
00:23 - maybe it's a rule that you have to take
00:25 - your shoes off when you come inside or
00:27 - you're only allowed to use electronics
00:29 - at a certain time computers follow rules
00:32 - too
00:33 - a computer program runs based on rules
00:35 - written in code by a programmer it will
00:39 - follow the rules or instructions in the
00:42 - program exactly as they are written a
00:46 - conditional statement is an if-then
00:49 - statement that allows the computer
00:51 - program to change its path and do
00:54 - something different if something is true
00:57 - then something else will happen
00:59 - using a condition in your code tells the
01:02 - computer to make an exception to a rule
01:05 - so a good example of this is a password
01:07 - as a rule a computer will not let you
01:10 - log in without the correct password it's
01:12 - designed this way for security but an
01:15 - exception to this rule can be made if
01:18 - you enter the correct password then you
01:22 - can enter conditions like this are all
01:27 - around you let's say a rule in your
01:29 - house is that on a school day you can
01:32 - only use electronics for a certain
01:34 - amount of time but what if your school
01:36 - building is closed and you have to do
01:38 - class online then an exception to this
01:42 - rule must be made if school is online
01:44 - then you can spend more time on
01:47 - electronics encode Abul who use colors
01:51 - to represent conditions they can be all
01:53 - different colors
01:55 - we know our fuzz is going to roll in the
01:58 - direction we tell it to so if we say go
02:00 - right then it will move right until it
02:02 - hits a wall if we want our fuzz to turn
02:05 - we can say if purple then turn down the
02:11 - arrow command goes on top of
02:13 - the condition tile so if purple then
02:20 - turn down after that we can complete the
02:25 - maze
02:27 - notice how the fuzz changes directions
02:31 - now it's your turn
02:33 - practice using conditional statements to
02:36 - change your fuzzies path in your program
02:38 - watch how the fuzz changes direction
02:41 - when you tell it to with your colored
02:43 - conditioned tiles
