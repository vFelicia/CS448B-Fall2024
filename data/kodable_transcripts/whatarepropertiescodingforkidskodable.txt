00:03 - which of these objects is a bird
00:08 - if you guessed all of them you are
00:10 - correct
00:11 - how did you know that just by looking at
00:13 - them I bet the wings fill and tail on
00:18 - each one gave it away right these are
00:21 - some properties or characteristics that
00:24 - all birds have in common you likely have
00:27 - never seen a bird without these traits
00:28 - because these are the things that define
00:30 - the bird class they help you tell a bird
00:34 - apart from something like a dog
00:36 - so all birds share certain
00:38 - characteristics like Bill wings tail and
00:42 - feathers but do all feathers of a
00:45 - hummingbird look the same as a flamingo
00:47 - or a duck
00:48 - they don't actually all of these traits
00:51 - including feather color are also
00:53 - variables which means they can vary or
00:56 - change between classes of bird it can
00:59 - even vary between individual birds of
01:02 - the same class how we can think about
01:05 - this flamingo as an individual object it
01:08 - is definitely a bird and the bird class
01:11 - blueprint says it needs to have feathers
01:13 - but the blueprint does not say what
01:15 - color those feathers must be a feather
01:18 - from this single flamingo is completely
01:21 - independent from all the other bird
01:23 - feathers out there if it decides to die
01:26 - its feathers green it's not like every
01:29 - flamingo will suddenly turn green all of
01:32 - its variables belong to only itself same
01:36 - with any other bird encoding when there
01:39 - is a variable like feather color that is
01:41 - attached to an object like a flamingo it
01:45 - is called a property I mentioned the
01:49 - word variable do you remember what it
01:51 - means encode a variable is like a
01:55 - container that stores information called
01:58 - a value here the feather variable stores
02:01 - of value green so we call the feather
02:05 - property value green as well what do you
02:08 - think the feather property for the other
02:10 - flamingo is
02:11 - you got it pink properties are super
02:16 - helpful when making and playing games
02:18 - for a couple reasons first property
02:22 - values can be changed let's look at blue
02:25 - blaster for an example in bug world
02:27 - increasing the value of the strength
02:30 - property for a blue blaster like this
02:34 - does not automatically increase the
02:37 - strength of any other blue blaster two
02:41 - properties allow you to change a single
02:44 - object without it causing a change in
02:46 - any other object second property values
02:50 - affect how an object behaves pinwheel
02:53 - has this example for us pinwheel has a
02:56 - range property changing the value of
02:59 - pinwheels range property from four to
03:02 - five like this will change the object's
03:06 - behavior it's wind will now reach slimes
03:09 - that are further away in bug world you
03:12 - can change the property values to
03:15 - powerup individual tower objects to
03:18 - defend against more dangerous slimes so
03:21 - let's review a property is a variable
03:24 - when it's attached to an object
03:26 - properties define the characteristics of
03:29 - an object and can be changed without
03:31 - affecting any other objects in the
03:33 - program
03:33 - have you tried changing the tower
03:35 - properties in bug world to stop the
03:37 - slimes here's how gather the fur babies
03:41 - to collect points click directly on a
03:44 - tower object this is the property button
03:47 - and means you have enough points to
03:49 - change the towers property value choose
03:52 - the property you want to modify here I
03:55 - choose blue blasters strength property
03:57 - decide by how much you want to increase
04:00 - the property value I will increase it
04:03 - from 1 to 2 this blue blaster now
04:06 - defends with two blasts instead of one
04:09 - goodbye slimes now it's your turn to try
04:13 - it out yourself
04:15 - let's go
