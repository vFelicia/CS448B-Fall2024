00:00 - on a computer you can do all sorts of
00:02 - things play games do your homework watch
00:08 - videos all of these things are done
00:11 - using computer programs a computer
00:15 - program is a set of instructions that a
00:17 - computer follows to complete a task we
00:20 - are surrounded by computer programs and
00:23 - it's not just computers that look like
00:24 - this one that depend on them cell phones
00:27 - coffee makers cars microwaves washing
00:30 - machines gaming consoles all of these
00:33 - devices are controlled by computer
00:35 - programs if we didn't have computer
00:38 - programs our world would look very
00:40 - different so computer programs are
00:52 - important and help control a lot of the
00:54 - devices and machines that we use every
00:56 - day but what are these programs made
00:59 - from computer programs are made out of
01:02 - their own special computer language
01:04 - called code a computer can't think for
01:10 - itself and you can't talk to it like a
01:15 - person if someone tried to talk to you
01:20 - in a language you don't understand you
01:22 - wouldn't know what to do right
01:24 - computers are the same they don't
01:26 - understand the languages that humans
01:28 - speak so if we want our computer to do
01:31 - something like make a game we can't just
01:34 - tell it to we need to give the computer
01:36 - step-by-step instructions for how to
01:39 - make the game in a language it does
01:41 - understand code computer code is usually
01:44 - made out of words and numbers like this
01:47 - it might look confusing but it's
01:49 - basically just an ordered list of all
01:52 - the commands you want your computer to
01:53 - follow you can learn how to put these
01:56 - words and numbers together in order so
01:58 - your computer can follow your commands
02:00 - and complete tasks when you are doing
02:03 - this you are programming or coding
02:06 - encoder Bowl you can code in many
02:09 - different ways sometimes you will write
02:11 - code with words and numbers to create a
02:13 - fuzz or program a game but your code
02:19 - might not always look like this other
02:21 - times you may use arrow commands or even
02:25 - asteroids to write your computer program
02:28 - no matter the method you get to decide
02:31 - what commands you want to put in your
02:33 - computer programs and the possibilities
02:35 - are endless
02:37 - let's get coding
