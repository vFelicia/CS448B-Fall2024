00:04 - have you ever followed instructions to
00:06 - build a Lego set or helped your parents
00:09 - bake cupcakes if you have then you know
00:12 - that you have to follow steps exactly as
00:14 - they are written from start to finish if
00:17 - you don't follow instructions exactly
00:19 - things might not turn out the way you
00:21 - planned
00:22 - in other words order matters a computer
00:26 - reads code the same way that you would
00:28 - read a recipe from the first line to the
00:31 - last one in programming this order of
00:35 - instructions that are to be followed
00:37 - exactly as they are written is called
00:39 - sequence whether you are new to coding
00:43 - or you are an expert with a career in
00:45 - programming sequence is key a computer
00:49 - can only do exactly what a programmer
00:52 - tells it to if the order of instructions
00:55 - or sequence given to a computer is wrong
00:58 - the program will not run correctly in
01:02 - code Abul your Fuzz acts just like a
01:05 - computer whatever commands you choose to
01:09 - put in your program your Fuzz will
01:11 - follow them exactly from the first
01:14 - command to the last one here is an
01:17 - example in codable to get through this
01:20 - maze
01:20 - we want our Fuzz to move right up right
01:27 - down and right drag these commands into
01:32 - your program in the same sequence
01:36 - remember your fuss will only change
01:38 - directions if you tell it to let's try
01:43 - it out
01:47 - [Music]
01:52 - once a computer has given commands in
01:55 - the correct sequence you can add
01:57 - something else to your code that will
01:59 - change the way your fuzz moves
02:01 - conditional statements a conditional
02:04 - statement is an if-then statement that
02:08 - tells your program to run a part of your
02:10 - code only if a certain condition is met
02:13 - if a condition is true then something
02:18 - will happen this may sound a bit
02:20 - complicated but you actually use
02:22 - conditional statements every day think
02:26 - about a typical school day things happen
02:29 - in an ordered sequence first you wake up
02:32 - in the morning then you get ready for
02:34 - school you arrive at school you go to
02:37 - class you go to recess and so forth
02:39 - let's say as a general rule your school
02:43 - always has recess outside but what if
02:47 - it's raining then an exception to this
02:49 - rule must be made if it is raining then
02:54 - you will stay inside but if it is not
02:57 - raining then the condition is false and
03:00 - we will go outside
03:01 - based on the rainy condition your day
03:05 - will look different another common
03:08 - example of conditional statements and
03:10 - action are passwords think about how a
03:13 - password works say you want to log into
03:16 - your account and you need to choose a
03:18 - picture password if you select the
03:22 - correct password then you can log into
03:25 - your account the condition here is that
03:28 - your password is correct if this
03:32 - condition is not met and your password
03:34 - is incorrect then you will not be able
03:37 - to log in in this activity you can code
03:41 - your Fuzz to change directions if a
03:44 - certain condition is true this is
03:46 - important because it means you can make
03:48 - your program smarter and collect more
03:51 - pieces of trash some animals will only
03:54 - be able to be rescued with the help of
03:56 - conditional statements let's see what
03:59 - additional statement looks like in
04:00 - codable and work through a level
04:01 - together start by drawing the path that
04:05 - will allow the fuzz to collect all the
04:07 - trash here we want our fuzz to move
04:10 - right up right down up right down right
04:20 - but we're missing something we need to
04:24 - place a condition tile here to tell our
04:27 - fuzz
04:28 - if pink then move down without this
04:32 - condition tile our fuzz would keep
04:34 - moving straight and not know to turn
04:37 - down let's see it in action
04:40 - [Music]
04:43 - drag the commands into your program to
04:46 - tell your fuzz to move right up right
04:53 - now when our fuzz reaches our pink tile
04:56 - we want it to move down not continue
04:59 - moving right if pink then down
05:03 - so let's code it if pink then down after
05:13 - putting the rest of our commands in the
05:14 - correct sequence we can test our program
05:17 - [Music]
05:33 - remember you may need to place a
05:35 - conditional tile if you want your fuzz
05:37 - to change directions happy coding now
05:41 - it's your turn
05:42 - create your maze code your program test
05:46 - it out
05:49 - [Music]
