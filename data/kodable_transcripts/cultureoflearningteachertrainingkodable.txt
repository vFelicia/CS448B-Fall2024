00:00 - when we started rolling out the kinder
00:03 - code program using codable that it was
00:05 - okay well we're just gonna do this one
00:07 - thing and that what we found was it
00:11 - opened up the doors to a lot of
00:13 - conversations we wouldn't have had the
00:16 - way I look at coding and programming is
00:18 - that's where our future is and that's
00:21 - where a lot of careers are headed and I
00:23 - think that it's our job as a teacher to
00:26 - expose them to lots of venues and to
00:28 - show them where their strengths are
00:29 - teachers kind of thought oh I can't code
00:33 - I don't know how to do that I'm not a
00:34 - programmer how am I going to teach my
00:36 - kids how to do that and when we were
00:38 - able to show them how accessible it was
00:40 - it would it became this moment of like
00:43 - oh that's all like I can do that you
00:47 - just go for it and then if you notice a
00:50 - way that you can improve your
00:51 - instruction then you improve it and I
00:54 - think students will surprise you with
00:57 - how easily they can retain the
00:59 - instruction and grasp the concept of the
01:02 - program I look at Cody and uncodable as
01:05 - learning the letters before you learn to
01:08 - read they're learning the basic steps
01:10 - and basic skills in coding then maybe if
01:12 - they take off with this then they have a
01:15 - future in coding themselves or
01:17 - programming there's the spirit of kind
01:21 - of wanting to explore and try that I
01:24 - think that as a district we didn't
01:27 - anticipate what's gonna happen and we've
01:29 - showed them strategies will trace it
01:30 - read the code and they're reading left
01:32 - to right just like they're learning to
01:34 - read in school and they're making the
01:37 - fuzzy you know trace the steps and they
01:40 - get to this part and like well what do
01:41 - you need to do from here and so they
01:43 - start to problem-solve them all in there
01:44 - we turned the term bug into one of our
01:47 - vocabulary words and they didn't just
01:50 - use it for coding they used it all
01:52 - throughout their day so they make a
01:55 - mistake on the math problem and they say
01:58 - oh I've made a bug and they'd erase it
02:00 - and fix it and so they're learning that
02:02 - that is part of the language that's used
02:04 - with coding they're putting it into
02:06 - their everyday language as well if you
02:10 - go into a class where Cody codable is is
02:12 - being used
02:14 - you really are seeing a group of kids
02:16 - who are like willing to try more
02:19 - frequently in other areas even when
02:22 - they're not using the technology because
02:24 - they have that classroom culture of well
02:27 - just try it again and it's okay and it's
02:29 - not a culture of failure it's a cultural
02:31 - of trying to be able to earn success
02:37 - you
