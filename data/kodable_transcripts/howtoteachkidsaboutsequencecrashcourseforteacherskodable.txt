00:01 - whoo-hoo let's go hi I'm Doreen I'm the
00:05 - director of curriculum at codable the
00:07 - short video is going to introduce you to
00:09 - the concept you'll be teaching in this
00:10 - unit thanks for watching
00:18 - people are smarter than computers we
00:21 - decide what actions we want the computer
00:23 - to carry out and then we communicate
00:25 - with the computer in a language that it
00:26 - understands in order to complete a
00:28 - desired task we call this language code
00:30 - and we instruct the computer using
00:32 - specific commands sequence the order
00:36 - that commands are executed by the
00:37 - computer allows us to carry out tasks
00:39 - that have multiple steps we can relate
00:42 - sequence to our everyday lives if we
00:44 - wanted to make a peanut butter and jelly
00:46 - sandwich for example we would need to
00:48 - follow multiple steps in a logical order
00:50 - we'd begin by gathering our ingredients
00:52 - getting a knife spreading the peanut
00:54 - butter spreading the jelly and so forth
00:56 - if we want to get robot to make a peanut
00:59 - butter and jelly sandwich for us we
01:01 - would need to make sure we gave the
01:03 - robot instructions in the correct order
01:04 - if we didn't do this we could
01:06 - potentially miss a step have a missing
01:09 - ingredient or end up with an inside-out
01:11 - peanut butter and jelly sandwich in
01:12 - programming computers can only carry out
01:15 - tasks that are in the correct order
01:17 - computers are machines and they have to
01:19 - do things the way they were built to do
01:21 - them in the on screen independent
01:24 - practice lessons for sequence the fuzz
01:26 - needs to be given instructions in the
01:28 - correct sequence to get through the maze
01:30 - using arrows as commands we need to give
01:33 - the fuzz instructions in the correct
01:35 - sequence or the fuzz will hit the wall
01:36 - of the maze computers read in a certain
01:40 - order similar to a typewriter which can
01:42 - only go left to right and top to bottom
01:44 - a computer has to read code in order if
01:47 - the sequence of the commands is
01:48 - incorrect the computer won't be able to
01:50 - follow the instructions in both
01:52 - programming and day-to-day tasks if we
01:55 - don't put every step in the right order
01:56 - the end result isn't what we tried for
01:58 - sequence is the most foundational
02:00 - concept in programming and everything we
02:02 - learn moving forward will build on this
02:04 - concept
