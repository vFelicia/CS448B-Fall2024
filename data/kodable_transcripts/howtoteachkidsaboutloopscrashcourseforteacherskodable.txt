00:01 - whoo-hoo let's go hi I'm Doreen I'm the
00:05 - director of curriculum at codable the
00:07 - short video is going to introduce you to
00:09 - the concept you'll be teaching in this
00:10 - unit thanks for watching
00:18 - in programming loops are important to
00:21 - learn and understand how to use to be
00:23 - able to create programs that can do a
00:24 - lot of different things loops are a
00:27 - programming element that repeat a
00:28 - portion of code a set number of times
00:30 - until a desired process is complete
00:32 - repetitive tasks are very common in
00:35 - programming and learning leaps is
00:36 - essential to save time and minimize
00:38 - errors let's think about a peanut butter
00:42 - and jelly sandwich example again we
00:44 - talked about how important it is to
00:45 - order the steps correctly to make one
00:47 - peanut butter and jelly sandwich but
00:49 - what if we needed to make 500 peanut
00:51 - butter and jelly sandwiches for a school
00:52 - field trip or something we would likely
00:54 - prefer to just do it once and have the
00:56 - steps automatically repeated 500 times
00:59 - to make 500 sandwiches in Kota bowls on
01:02 - screen independent practice lessons
01:04 - students will identify where the code
01:06 - repeats and practice applying a set
01:08 - number of loops in this example level
01:11 - the same set of commands are used three
01:13 - times in a row down right down right
01:17 - down right instead of writing these
01:21 - commands three times we use a leap and
01:23 - only have to write at once if we were
01:26 - writing our peanut butter and jelly
01:27 - sandwich instructions in code it would
01:29 - likely be hundreds of lines long loops
01:31 - allow programmers to shorten what could
01:33 - be hundreds of lines of code to just a
01:35 - few this allows programmers to write
01:38 - their code once and use it as many times
01:39 - as needed making it more likely for the
01:42 - program to run as expected loops make
01:45 - code more manageable and organized as we
01:48 - learn more about programming and writing
01:49 - complex programs loops will be an
01:51 - important element to understand and use
