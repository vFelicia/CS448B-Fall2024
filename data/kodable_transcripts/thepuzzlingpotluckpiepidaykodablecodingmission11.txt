00:00 - [Music]
00:00 - welcome to the fuzz family's pi day
00:02 - potluck
00:03 - all the fuzzies were supposed to bring a
00:05 - different kind of pie to share
00:07 - ruby has cherry spike brought pumpkin
00:10 - simon has apple violet brought pecan
00:14 - and wait a minute one of these pies
00:17 - is not like the others blue fuzz brought
00:20 - this mysterious symbol to the party
00:23 - does this look like pie to you
00:27 - well it might look different but the
00:28 - symbol is actually also called
00:31 - pi it's spelled differently there's no e
00:34 - at the end but it does sound the same
00:37 - the thing is you can't eat this pie it's
00:40 - a symbol
00:41 - that represents a very special number
00:44 - that is helpful for solving
00:45 - math mysteries about circles
00:49 - so let's talk circles for a sec because
00:51 - there are two important distances that
00:53 - will help us
00:54 - understand what this weird pie that you
00:56 - can't eat
00:57 - is all about the first is the distance
01:00 - from one point
01:02 - all the way around the circle the fancy
01:05 - math word for this
01:06 - is called circumference the second
01:09 - is the distance from one point across
01:11 - the circle
01:13 - the word for this is diameter
01:16 - pi is just the relationship or ratio
01:19 - between the two distances
01:21 - no matter what circle you look at the
01:24 - circumference
01:24 - is always a little more than 3 times the
01:27 - diameter
01:29 - but instead of saying a little more than
01:31 - 3 or
01:32 - 3.14 it's easier for us to use this
01:35 - greek
01:36 - symbol hi so why does pie matter
01:40 - well like i said before pi is helpful
01:43 - for solving math mysteries
01:45 - this is because if you know just one of
01:47 - these two distances
01:49 - you can use pi to figure out the other
01:51 - one
01:52 - here's an example last week the fuzz
01:55 - family decided they wanted to know the
01:57 - width of the planet smiborg
02:00 - the width or diameter is the distance
02:03 - from one point on the planet
02:05 - straight across to the other side but
02:08 - here's the thing
02:09 - planet smeaborg is not a flat circle
02:12 - it's a sphere like a ball and there's no
02:16 - way the fuzzes could measure
02:17 - a straight line through it they would
02:20 - have had to bury through the center of
02:21 - the planet
02:22 - and not even cole fuzz could dig that
02:24 - far
02:25 - then violet remembered something and
02:27 - told the rest of the fuzzies
02:29 - we can use pie to solve this mystery we
02:32 - just need to know the distance around
02:34 - the planet
02:36 - she flew all the way around the planet
02:38 - smiborg in her spaceship
02:39 - and measured the circumference then she
02:42 - used her knowledge of pie
02:44 - and solved the mystery of the smeborg
02:46 - diameter
02:49 - pie is very important to the fuzz family
02:51 - not only because it helps them solve
02:53 - mysteries like this around the universe
02:55 - but also because their bodies are
02:57 - spheres
02:58 - it's a cool thing that every single fuzz
03:00 - has in common
03:02 - fuzzes love to roll and bounce and spin
03:04 - to celebrate their circular shape
03:08 - and it's not just the fuzzes math lovers
03:10 - all over the universe have a holiday on
03:13 - march 14th
03:14 - to appreciate pie shapes and math in
03:17 - general
03:18 - your coding mission is to create a
03:21 - codable maze that includes a shape you
03:23 - see
03:23 - at the pi day potluck step one is to
03:27 - choose a shape
03:28 - take a look at the picture of the pi day
03:30 - party what shapes do you notice
03:34 - here are some examples i like the
03:36 - triangle shape of simon's party hat
03:39 - so i'll pick that step 2 log in to
03:42 - codable
03:43 - if you've already unlocked the maze
03:44 - maker you can go straight there
03:46 - but if you're brand new to codable make
03:48 - sure you start on planet smeeborg
03:51 - players need to complete at least four
03:53 - levels to learn about sequence and
03:54 - unlock the maze maker
03:57 - step three is to click the build button
03:59 - and open a new maze
04:00 - draw the shape you chose we need to
04:03 - connect the shape to each side of the
04:05 - maze maker
04:06 - then get creative this is a celebration
04:09 - so don't be afraid to add lots of
04:10 - decorations
04:12 - finally it's time to place the stars in
04:13 - the maze and test to make sure it's
04:15 - solvable
04:16 - in this example i actually just need my
04:19 - fuzz to roll straight
04:20 - so my code is only one command
04:23 - don't forget in programming and in math
04:26 - we test we make fixes we test and try
04:29 - again
04:30 - so don't give up if your maze doesn't
04:32 - work on the first try
04:34 - you're up next
04:38 - happy pi day
