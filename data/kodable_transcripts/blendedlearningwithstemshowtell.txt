00:06 - hello everyone welcome to codable
00:09 - show-and-tell this is a first of a
00:12 - series that we will be running where we
00:14 - will be speaking with some awesome
00:15 - educators who are using codable in their
00:18 - classrooms these educators might be
00:20 - using codable in different or
00:22 - interesting ways maybe they are
00:24 - grappling with a problem that many other
00:27 - teachers are dealing with or they are
00:29 - just looking for an opportunity to share
00:32 - their students success so we are really
00:35 - excited to welcome Samantha Selleck off
00:37 - is our first spotlight teacher
00:41 - samantha is a technology and stem
00:44 - teacher at the Rockaway borough School
00:46 - District in New Jersey she teaches
00:48 - fourth through eighth grade students a
00:51 - wide range of students they're Amish
00:53 - boots and teaches stem lesson about the
00:56 - engineering design process perfect
00:58 - lecture and coding it also leads some
01:01 - aiding with other teachers about how to
01:04 - use technology in their classroom so
01:06 - we're so excited for some yet that to
01:07 - join us so my name is Hannah I am the
01:09 - instructional coach at codable my role
01:12 - is to support teachers who are living in
01:14 - this world of elementary computer
01:17 - science education I'm sort you jump into
01:19 - it so it's manfully and welcome thank
01:21 - you so much for joining us
01:24 - yeah we first met you on Twitter when
01:28 - you shared a project and more students
01:30 - have participated in over spring break
01:32 - like love and your age most sharing one
01:36 - those project guidelines were and kind
01:39 - of what was the outcome of that spring
01:41 - break project with code of law okay so I
01:44 - wanted to hear about all my students
01:47 - adventures over spring break and I kind
01:50 - of lied to me in a meaningful way so a
01:53 - lot of times they're excited to tell you
01:54 - about their adventures as they should be
01:57 - so sometimes it'll turn into some long
02:00 - story so I wanted to begin meaningful
02:03 - conversation they were able to take a
02:06 - picture with clothes that they decorated
02:08 - um and then share it with me and I could
02:13 - also share it with the class so I got to
02:15 - learn about what they did I said that it
02:17 - could be
02:18 - thing small that they did or something
02:22 - or a trip that they went on so I shared
02:25 - with me the first minimal is the student
02:29 - and their siblings going to a park the
02:31 - Prez was there participating with them
02:34 - and going to the park with them another
02:36 - one a student was going to her she
02:38 - another one the students were touring
02:41 - New York City so I got a series of
02:43 - jurors which was awesome so they got to
02:46 - create stories that the fuzz went on the
02:49 - adventure with they named their fuzz and
02:51 - being a part of them
02:56 - okay so that's good announcements I
03:02 - think awesome well did so did any of the
03:07 - projects that the students submitted for
03:09 - that Spring Break project surprise me
03:11 - did any of the students do something
03:13 - that you didn't really expect them to
03:14 - buzz um I think I was excited to see how
03:22 - our students got creative with it and
03:24 - see all the different adventures there
03:27 - was excited to see them all so one that
03:38 - I was really interested in was the tour
03:40 - of New York City because it was a series
03:42 - of pictures so it kind of like outlined
03:44 - the day we're getting into filmmaking
03:47 - next year with storyboarding so we did a
03:49 - little bit of storyboarding with comics
03:52 - this Oh would you start so creepy story
03:57 - for your photos next year or something
03:58 - like that series of pictures outline
04:01 - your day with the fuzz and the fuzz
04:04 - would be going through that day with you
04:05 - awesome I mean what do you think the
04:08 - students learned from this project the
04:11 - big game it was great to see the family
04:16 - time that they went through or that they
04:19 - got to participate in it was probably
04:21 - happening anyway but to share out in a
04:23 - meaningful way so they worked on their
04:26 - 4c so that one in particular was
04:28 - communication so just communicating um a
04:31 - memory from Spring Break was one of the
04:35 - things that they got to participate in
04:36 - well one of things that they learned was
04:38 - creating a concise message or I'm a
04:41 - clear way to express themself yeah
04:44 - absolutely
04:46 - you had mentioned those before C's so
04:51 - you mentioned one of them I love if you
04:54 - could speak a little bit more to the
04:55 - four C's like how do you incorporate the
04:58 - four C's first of all what are they and
05:00 - how do you incorporate them when you are
05:02 - designing curriculum and teaching coding
05:05 - well a lot of my curriculum is based off
05:08 - the four C's as well as an engineering
05:10 - process engineering design Asus is asked
05:13 - the management plan create improve and
05:15 - communicate and then the four C's are
05:18 - critical thinking communication
05:19 - collaboration and creativity when we
05:22 - were designing our thoughts we talked a
05:24 - lot about creativity they collaborated
05:28 - with each other to kind of come up with
05:30 - an idea for their buzz critical thinking
05:33 - they use all the time with codable
05:35 - because of the different strategies that
05:37 - they need to that they need to solve the
05:41 - puzzles mm-hmm and communication just
05:46 - communicating out their message so that
05:48 - was one of the things that focused on
05:50 - with creating a buzz and creating memory
05:52 - with your buzz yeah absolutely so
05:56 - picking up really cool to be I think
05:58 - that alone the feedback we hear from
06:01 - teachers is they kind of grapple with
06:04 - that balance between creative meeting
06:07 - and teaching specific concept and like
06:11 - what can happen for when you want to
06:14 - identify when creativity hit in a
06:16 - computer science classroom so in other
06:18 - words how do you know if your students
06:21 - are um so creativity is a really
06:25 - interesting concept because it means a
06:27 - lot of different things to a lot of
06:30 - different people and how to express
06:32 - themselves creatively so one of the
06:35 - things I do is journaling which a lot of
06:39 - teachers do so as an exit slip sometimes
06:44 - they will journal out their ideas so
06:48 - just how did it how are they creative
06:51 - with in computer science you're asking
06:53 - mm-hmm I'm so in codable when they're
06:55 - creating their crust on the computer I
06:58 - displayed some of them for what we do
07:00 - here of night of the Arts
07:02 - so I displayed some of their mazes and
07:05 - there were their buzz creations so not
07:08 - only did they get to create classes on
07:10 - paper through their fuzz Adventures but
07:12 - then they also got to create them on the
07:14 - computer so that's one way that they're
07:18 - expressing myself creatively but he also
07:20 - has to do with problem solving so just
07:22 - going through the different puzzle
07:24 - they're also creative in that sense
07:26 - absolutely as people with problem
07:29 - solving you mentioned that engineering
07:31 - design process where problem-solving is
07:33 - such a huge part of it how you creates
07:37 - opportunities for like authentic problem
07:41 - solving in a computer science classroom
07:43 - so you mentioned it with the codable
07:45 - puzzles I'm curious if you could share
07:47 - with the other teachers who might be
07:49 - listening what what problem-solving
07:52 - opportunities are you giving your
07:53 - students I really things back to the
07:57 - real world a lot of times so a lot of
07:59 - times I blend different current events I
08:01 - highlight people who have solve problems
08:03 - in the world outside of my classroom I
08:07 - have a stem in the news poster so there
08:11 - have different problems that they have
08:12 - solved other problem solving techniques
08:16 - just different games and strategies so
08:19 - sometimes logic puzzles or there's that
08:24 - aspect of it I do a lot of unplugged
08:27 - activities as well so it's part of
08:30 - pulling from codable and then also just
08:34 - that I have created in terms of problem
08:37 - solving techniques yeah I'm wondering if
08:40 - you're an example of an unplugged
08:43 - activity that you have used in your
08:45 - classroom in in tandem with codable so
08:50 - what kind of unplugged activities do you
08:52 - like to to do a lot of the unplugged
08:58 - activities I do have two sports or one
09:02 - of the infamous ones is I found on a
09:06 - clue orgs website where a lot of other
09:11 - people have also done variations of it
09:13 - where you're creating an aluminum foil
09:15 - bow and then you're seeing how many
09:17 - marbles it can hold someone to Cooper
09:19 - house
09:19 - how many books can the paper household
09:22 - so a lot of those different design
09:25 - challenges yeah that's great so you've
09:30 - spoken you the force use and a lot about
09:33 - creativity and it sounds like
09:35 - there's also a lot of opportunities for
09:38 - students to personalize their own
09:40 - project because they decorate their Fuzz
09:43 - I'm wondering you could speak more to
09:46 - than that role of personalization and
09:49 - like driven learning and in computer
09:52 - science where else use near students
09:55 - expressing for their personal selves in
09:59 - your computer science classroom well
10:02 - being able to create their own fuzz and
10:06 - also being able to manage their
10:09 - difficulty level on football as well so
10:12 - if they get frustrated too many times I
10:16 - have an I help poster in my classroom so
10:18 - just reminders of where they can go
10:20 - they're confused so I'm doing techniques
10:23 - or welcome to come to me but then also
10:26 - the buzz buzz rate that come with the
10:32 - hint is really helpful for them so it
10:35 - keeps them in their zone of proximal
10:36 - development and doesn't allow them to
10:39 - get too frustrated and it's nice to see
10:43 - when they do finally saw a level of
10:46 - excitement that they get so yeah
10:49 - speaking of that I hope posters so what
10:53 - are the steps that you recommend to your
10:55 - students when they encounter a problem
10:57 - how do they go about solving it I
11:01 - usually have them I usually have them
11:05 - show me which steps that they had so I
11:08 - go through it with them
11:10 - I see if a student has gone through it
11:12 - with them so to use their student
11:15 - parents as well and then will help all
11:20 - them together kind of like how
11:23 - elementary schools have the reading
11:25 - groups or the math groups this is just
11:27 - computer science groups yeah I think a
11:30 - lot of talkers including myself would be
11:33 - pretty taken aback that you teach 4th
11:35 - 5th 6th 7th and 8th grade Emily can you
11:40 - talk a little bit about the challenges
11:42 - of developing coding curriculum for that
11:45 - wide of an
11:47 - strange you find it challenging and if
11:49 - so what are what do you do about that
11:52 - well I use a lot of different resources
11:54 - and they can reach out to different
11:55 - community members and other educators in
11:58 - my community and I do get a lot of great
12:01 - ideas from different platforms such as
12:04 - Twitter and codable and Korg so it's and
12:09 - I do attend a lot of different
12:10 - professional developments as well in
12:13 - order to keep atop of different
12:16 - strategies to help my students and new
12:19 - technology that's coming on the rise -
12:21 - yeah
12:22 - Jean what ever experience multiple
12:26 - students in one class who are at
12:28 - different levels and their learning and
12:31 - how so I have an expert board that once
12:41 - a student masters either a concept
12:44 - including so what are creating their
12:47 - apps if the one student has mastered
12:50 - coding a button or coding or coding a
12:55 - screen their name goes up on the expert
12:58 - board so then students can ask them
13:00 - questions about that and look to them as
13:03 - helpers - so just having other students
13:08 - and those experts on the subject helps
13:11 - me manage that mm-hmm do you see
13:16 - students moving at different paces when
13:18 - they're in Kota bowl or how do you
13:21 - regulate like how quickly the students
13:23 - are moving through the levels based on
13:25 - what they are ready for it
13:27 - um I allow students to go the levels on
13:33 - their own pace if they like so a lot of
13:36 - students do enjoy doing portable at home
13:38 - oh they do come in at all different
13:41 - paces which I'm okay with because then
13:46 - it creates more experts within the
13:48 - classroom yeah I like that when you when
13:52 - we first spoke you mentioned your
13:55 - students were really engaged with the
13:57 - maze maker
13:59 - can you share a little bit more about
14:00 - the types of means is that you've
14:02 - created or how do you present maker to
14:05 - your students a lot of the students
14:08 - they've created mazes within codable and
14:10 - they try to have other students solve
14:15 - their maze as well paint so that way I
14:18 - can solve it sometimes they create some
14:21 - challenging ones so they get really
14:24 - excited about that they also have their
14:26 - parents try to solve them so it becomes
14:29 - a family thing which is fun some of them
14:32 - have created different words in it so
14:35 - like their name or friends name so they
14:39 - do enjoy that part of codable yeah
14:43 - that's great
14:45 - and then a couple questions are just
14:49 - about your students experience with
14:51 - potable and if they enjoy it so my
14:55 - question is students take away one thing
14:56 - from their experience with codable what
14:59 - team hopes but that would be I hope that
15:03 - they would take away persistence because
15:05 - a lot of times it takes them more than
15:08 - one try especially as they go through
15:10 - the platform to to solve the puzzle so
15:16 - oh just / so I would say persistence is
15:19 - definitely one of them
15:21 - yeah and the problem-solving skills
15:24 - building off of that persistence piece
15:27 - because I think that is something that a
15:28 - lot of teachers are really interested in
15:30 - fostering or know for their students
15:33 - especially with all that about 21st
15:35 - century skills what are the rules you
15:38 - must her persistence in your classroom
15:41 - you mentioned with codable and parent
15:43 - you have other tips for teachers who are
15:45 - trying to encourage that cell with their
15:48 - students definitely through design
15:51 - challenges in code and just working
15:56 - through different problems logic
15:59 - problems sometimes do now is that kind
16:03 - of stimulate that sense of logics or
16:08 - problem-solving skills so
16:12 - there's different techniques within the
16:13 - classroom yeah you mentioned the boat
16:16 - building with the aluminum foil could
16:19 - you mention a couple other design
16:21 - challenges that might be fun or
16:23 - interesting for teachers to try so
16:25 - there's also something similar to that
16:27 - with the paper house you got to build a
16:28 - paper house then you got to have the
16:30 - books you see how many books it can hold
16:35 - I've done those have also done marble
16:40 - maze I've done so a lot of traditional
16:42 - ones but then I've done some other
16:44 - out-of-the-box ones having to do with
16:47 - sports lounge a curriculum also has a
16:51 - good one with creating a wallet or the
16:53 - ones that have to do with entrepreneur
16:55 - such as creating their own sport so
16:59 - there's a ton of different design
17:02 - challenges out there mm-hmm
17:04 - as well sure absolutely that's important
17:08 - um how would you explain or describe a
17:12 - connection between these design
17:14 - challenges it really hands-on and then
17:17 - on certain coding and computer science
17:21 - where do you see the connection there so
17:24 - quotable brings a gamification aspect to
17:28 - computer science which is great so they
17:31 - are progressing to the next level or the
17:35 - students are progressing to the next
17:36 - level but then they also need movement
17:39 - so the unplugged activities bring that
17:42 - sense of movement and interactive
17:44 - components to computer science so it's
17:48 - the intention there yeah definitely what
17:52 - would be a recommendation that you would
17:54 - give to a teacher who might be hesitant
17:57 - about using Google for the first time or
18:00 - even diving into the world of computer
18:03 - science education at all what's a
18:05 - recommendation that you might give a
18:06 - hesitant teacher I think that one
18:12 - recommendation that I would give to
18:13 - teachers would be to not necessarily
18:17 - hold back you'll learn a lot of things
18:21 - only from the webinars and exploring the
18:24 - curriculum
18:25 - but through other teachers Twitter and
18:28 - then also your students as well mm-hmm
18:31 - yeah so really just kind of diving into
18:33 - it giving right what can you do with it
18:37 - if a student asks you in that you don't
18:40 - know the answer to or does that happen
18:42 - and if so so a lot of times either
18:46 - another student might have solved those
18:49 - puzzles or there's also teacher mode so
18:54 - you can kind of figure out how to solve
18:58 - them through your account and then I
19:01 - reached out to codable on you guys as
19:03 - well either glitch in the system or for
19:08 - a table and solving a puzzle mm-hmm
19:10 - buzz-buzz helps too okay yes absolutely
19:15 - what are your plans so we're in summer
19:18 - vacation congratulations what are your
19:21 - plans moving forward with next year
19:23 - encoder Bowl or coding education in
19:26 - general do you have any plans that you
19:28 - are looking forward to so we're all set
19:32 - up for what about for next year so we
19:34 - will be using quotable I would love to
19:37 - do some more interactive things with the
19:43 - cool fuzz so or unplugged wise like the
19:49 - fuzz Adventures for spring break so I do
19:52 - a component
19:53 - kind of like a clock cut but a book
19:55 - forms oh definitely with fourth grade
19:57 - where they take the fuzz book home they
20:01 - write something about what they did with
20:02 - the family and then they bring it back
20:04 - and then switching it to another student
20:06 - so that's certainly something that I
20:08 - want to do for next year so more
20:11 - bringing the family come on at a home
20:13 - life component into the classroom yeah I
20:16 - mean you had we mentioned that a lot of
20:19 - students are enjoying codable outside of
20:23 - school now did you introduce codable to
20:26 - the parents outside of school or did the
20:29 - students bring portable hello a letter
20:31 - went home with portable fuzz when they
20:35 - were decorating it originally about
20:37 - their spring break
20:39 - and then I also allowed the students or
20:43 - and told the students about the quotable
20:46 - summer challenge as well so they have
20:48 - the opportunity to do that so those are
20:51 - two different sides that families have
20:55 - seen codable and then they've also seen
20:57 - quotable we had like a display at night
21:01 - of the arts of what they've been doing
21:02 - with coding oh well can you say what
21:06 - what did I just play look Mike tell us a
21:08 - little bit more so some of the meze
21:10 - design that students committed had some
21:12 - of the puzzles that students mean had
21:15 - some of the virtual poses that students
21:18 - made some of the we had a whole bulletin
21:21 - board of the different quizzes that
21:24 - students create and parents and students
21:30 - said guests about how many lines of
21:32 - coding all the students combined so it
21:36 - had a lot of different components of
21:38 - coding in computer science
21:39 - yeah that's great I'd love to know if we
21:44 - have teens who reach out to us who are
21:47 - interested in learning more about the
21:48 - work that you are doing or if they have
21:50 - questions about incorporating you
21:52 - mentioned sports that are make sure the
21:54 - engineering design process we can be
21:56 - open to connecting with some other
21:58 - teachers they do have further questions
22:00 - sure they could always reach out to me
22:03 - on Twitter and also check out the things
22:07 - that I'm doing on there as well if
22:08 - they're interested yeah well that's how
22:11 - that's how we got in touch with you so
22:13 - yeah what other teachers would love to
22:15 - see that the pictures that you post from
22:17 - your classroom
22:19 - northen so much for joining us it was
22:22 - really great to talk to you and I look
22:24 - forward to speaking with you soon
22:26 - great thanks Anna thanks everyone bye
22:31 - thank you so much for watching if you
22:34 - are interested in learning more about
22:35 - blended learning with codable or you are
22:37 - interested in sharing ways that you have
22:40 - used potable in your classroom please
22:42 - reach out to me my email is hana at
22:45 - codable comm I am also running free
22:48 - training and onboarding sessions this
22:50 - summer so if you are interested in
22:52 - getting a walkthrough of the teacher
22:53 - dashboard or getting any of your codable
22:55 - questions answered I'm happy to help
22:57 - please reach out thank you so much for
22:59 - watching
