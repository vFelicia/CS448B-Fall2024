00:00 - good morning I'm Gretchen we're the
00:02 - founders of codable this is Hannah and I
00:06 - recently joined our team early this
00:09 - summer that she recently she's our
00:12 - instructional coach at global so a lot
00:14 - of you may have talked to her this
00:16 - summer we've been doing some training
00:17 - calls with her she's doing a great job
00:19 - she was making some amazing resources
00:23 - you will find we'll cover some of them
00:25 - in this webinar but you'll find the
00:27 - money on your dashboard um she was a
00:31 - computer science teacher in an
00:33 - elementary school and then went back to
00:35 - school at Harvard where she was studying
00:38 - technology innovation in education and
00:41 - she was also working in their creative
00:44 - computing lab there for a little bit
00:45 - she's just super knowledgeable we're so
00:48 - lucky having um and so she's going to be
00:52 - joining us she's gonna be leaving most
00:54 - of this so you guys can get familiar
00:55 - with Hannah um if you have any questions
00:58 - as we're going through things we have a
01:00 - live chat on the side you can push your
01:02 - question there we're going to be
01:03 - checking in with that as we go and
01:05 - breathe I'm sure many of you know BRE
01:07 - she is going to be monitoring questions
01:09 - and answering any of them as they come
01:13 - up if she can so we're so excited to
01:17 - have you all if you have questions feel
01:20 - free to post them we're going to cover
01:22 - so I'm just going to give you a rundown
01:24 - of all the things you're going to talk
01:25 - about we're gonna cover getting started
01:28 - with codable so many of you all are new
01:30 - yeah thank you to everybody who RSVP'd
01:31 - and told us a little bit about if you
01:34 - can use Google before I was so blown
01:36 - away it's so exciting to have so many
01:37 - newbies and then some of you guys are
01:40 - coming back for the second time or third
01:42 - time I think gosh this points like seven
01:45 - years I think so um we're gonna cover
01:48 - all of the exciting things we added this
01:50 - summer we've been making a lot of
01:52 - changes on the parent side of coda well
01:56 - they're going to affect some of the
01:57 - things you're doing at school
01:59 - we're also we've also been adding a lot
02:01 - of resources on your teacher dashboard
02:03 - so we're going to get to some of that
02:05 - today so yeah let's get started I'm so
02:08 - excited to have you back to school
02:09 - everybody yeah
02:10 - have you back to school so my kitchen
02:12 - said the goal of this webinar is really
02:14 - for all of you to feel comfortable
02:16 - teaching your first class with codable
02:18 - this year whether that's your first
02:19 - class ever or your just your first class
02:22 - this year because your students are new
02:24 - and so we're gonna jump in I'm going to
02:26 - broadcast my teacher dashboard to you
02:29 - guys and walk through some things that
02:31 - are new and then the basics for setting
02:34 - up a class and getting started so I'm
02:36 - gonna jump into that as always if you
02:38 - guys have any questions please feel free
02:39 - to write them in and we'll try to answer
02:41 - them as we go and then have a big
02:42 - question and answer at the end and so
02:45 - I'm going to jump in and share my screen
02:48 - I wish you guys can see the setup that
02:55 - we have so Hannah doesn't actually have
02:58 - a standing desk we have her monitor like
03:02 - up on her trash can right now so I'm
03:05 - really gonna go great crazy setup that
03:10 - we whipped up the last minute so that we
03:12 - can be standing but yeah it's working
03:14 - out really nice so far then modernism
03:18 - toppling over okay all right um so we
03:24 - are in this is your teacher dashboard
03:26 - I'm guessing most of you have seen this
03:29 - before if you have it you can register
03:31 - for a free teacher - a free teacher
03:33 - account on our website so once you're in
03:37 - I'm going to talk through really quickly
03:39 - how to add a class that is the first
03:41 - step to teaching with codable so though
03:44 - you can click this add class button and
03:47 - yes one second can you switch so that
03:50 - it's the full screen who's right name
03:53 - yes but we're not even there so okay
03:56 - here we go see hopefully that helped out
03:58 - yeah awesome I'm just gonna wait to make
04:03 - sure that we're all set up thank you
04:07 - perfect um so we are in our class class
04:11 - creation page so what I'm going to title
04:14 - this class webinar but you can name it
04:17 - whatever you need for your students
04:19 - there's also advanced options to import
04:22 - your
04:23 - in bulk through Google classroom and
04:25 - there's a clever link as well so we can
04:28 - continue on I'm going to add some
04:31 - students so I will add Hannah Gretchen
04:34 - and Bree as students for my class save
04:38 - and continue now the class code is the
04:41 - way that your students will be able to
04:43 - log in and use quotable so there are
04:46 - there is a video giving you a tip on how
04:48 - to create a class code basically we just
04:50 - want this to be easy to remember and
04:52 - something that your students will be
04:56 - able to remember so I'm going to give it
04:59 - webinar 2 as my class code save and
05:02 - continue' you can also choose to use
05:05 - some of these suggested class codes if
05:09 - you want to just to make things easier
05:11 - for yourself if you decide to make to
05:13 - use one of those but then you decide to
05:15 - change it you can always change it from
05:16 - your class page absolutely so once you
05:20 - have your class set up that's kind of
05:22 - the first big thing you need to get onto
05:24 - your teacher dashboard after this you
05:28 - can pretty easily jump right into
05:30 - teaching with codable you just need to
05:33 - get your students logged in to play so
05:37 - doing that is very simple you'll just
05:39 - click on the button that says student
05:41 - instructions student instructions are
05:44 - going to generate a page here that you
05:50 - can see that will give your students all
05:53 - the instructions they need to use the
05:55 - classic code you just created to play
05:58 - with codable so they will just need to
06:01 - open codable either through the iPad app
06:04 - or through the web at a notable com they
06:08 - are going to enter their class code that
06:10 - you just created and that's super easy
06:13 - because each student is going to be
06:15 - given a unique code card so it has their
06:20 - name on it you can see these are the
06:21 - students I just entered for my class as
06:23 - well as the class code it's right there
06:25 - super easy to see there's also a parent
06:28 - code on these code cards if students
06:30 - want to continue playing at home and
06:31 - we're going to get into a little bit
06:33 - about
06:33 - sharing with parents a bit later one
06:36 - thing to note is that if you are using
06:40 - iPads when you download this class you
06:43 - only have to enter the class code once
06:46 - it'll just download that class roster
06:49 - and then whenever kids come back to the
06:52 - app all you need to do is like tap on
06:54 - the class and the tap on their name so
06:57 - entering the class code is only
06:58 - something you have to do once on the
06:59 - iPad um so once you have once your
07:03 - students have class code it's very easy
07:06 - for them to start playing with codable
07:09 - and I'm just going to show you how easy
07:10 - that would be so you've set up your
07:12 - class and you've created a class code
07:14 - your students are going to access game
07:17 - decodable comm or the iPad app they'll
07:21 - click on the button that says enter
07:22 - class code and this is where you will
07:25 - enter the code again that was on their
07:29 - code cards this is webinar 2 so when
07:33 - they enter their class code they are
07:35 - then prompted to choose their name from
07:37 - the class roster so I'm going to choose
07:40 - to play as Hana and it will take them
07:46 - right into the codable game so again we
07:50 - did that in about five minutes
07:52 - setting up the class generating the
07:54 - class code and then having your students
07:57 - log in once they have the link to play
07:59 - and so right now I'm just gonna go
08:01 - through one lesson in codable so for
08:05 - those of you that haven't seen it before
08:07 - or experienced it too much and you can
08:10 - see what it's all about and so when your
08:14 - students log in for the first time this
08:16 - is exactly what they will see so they
08:22 - will be prompted to meet blue fuzz you
08:27 - can see the code syntax showing up as
08:31 - they are dragging the different parts
08:34 - and then they are into fuzz topia so
08:37 - again this is exactly what your students
08:39 - will see when they're playing the game
08:41 - for
08:41 - those of you that are new and they would
08:46 - be brought to this hope the dashboard
08:48 - where they will click go and these are
08:51 - our three worlds in codable Smee Borg
08:54 - asteroid and bug world and we're gonna
08:56 - get into the lessons and a little bit
09:00 - more about great pacing when we dive
09:03 - into the dashboard a little bit later
09:05 - but I'm just going to show you if you're
09:07 - starting for the first time what your
09:09 - students would see if they click on Sea
09:12 - Org so they will start at level one and
09:16 - you can see if that level one is
09:17 - unlocked the first thing that happens in
09:22 - Smee Borg is they are going to meet us
09:25 - but as I'm just going to fast-forward
09:27 - through on the introductory video so you
09:29 - guys can see the lesson here but they're
09:32 - given a little tutorial of how Smee
09:35 - board works so sweet work is really
09:37 - trying to teach it's trying to teach
09:42 - sequence conditions loops and functions
09:45 - but it starts with a very basic tutorial
09:49 - of how to input code commands to get
09:56 - your Fuzz through the techno Me's to the
09:59 - end and so I you can see that I dragged
10:02 - in different arrow commands I would move
10:04 - my foot through the maze and I'm going
10:06 - to click go on oh yeah yeah umm so above
10:09 - thingy the play button you guys see this
10:11 - adorable little I character I mean is
10:14 - buzz-buzz and this is our our new hint
10:17 - system that we just added this school
10:19 - year we added it early at this summer
10:21 - but it's really nice there's a face of
10:24 - three hints that students can get if
10:26 - they're struggling they're gonna be
10:28 - prompted to get a hint after 30 seconds
10:31 - if they need it
10:32 - so we've tested it with a bunch of kids
10:34 - and it's surprise I was I was a little
10:36 - worried oh they're just gonna hit hints
10:38 - every time but I've seen a lot of them
10:40 - actually like really like to try before
10:43 - they hit get the hint and it's only
10:45 - going to give them a portion of the
10:47 - correct answer so they're still
10:51 - constructive struggle that's happening
10:53 - but you can read more about it on our
10:56 - help center support quotable calm if you
10:59 - have any questions feel free to let us
11:00 - know or feedback honestly because it's
11:03 - new yeah so after your students have
11:06 - input the code commands that they need
11:09 - to get their folks to the means they'll
11:10 - click go you can see the different
11:14 - commands are lighting up as they move to
11:16 - the level and then they'll move on to
11:18 - the next lesson so that is just a really
11:21 - quick snapshot of what's new board looks
11:24 - like and what your students would be
11:27 - doing for the first time that they log
11:30 - into the game I am back on my teacher
11:32 - dashboard now and I want to show you
11:34 - something that we've newly moved to the
11:37 - left side of your dashboard which is
11:39 - called teacher demo mode I'm holding my
11:42 - mouse over it right now it's with this
11:43 - green game controller so we just went
11:47 - through what your students would
11:48 - experience the first time that they are
11:50 - playing if you are on your teacher
11:52 - dashboard and you want to play a level
11:56 - to see what your students would be doing
11:58 - that day or remind yourself what is
12:00 - happening in Seaborg you can actually
12:03 - play every single codable level by
12:06 - clicking on teacher demo mode this is
12:08 - codable unlocked and it's something that
12:10 - when I'm talking to teachers not
12:13 - everyone has heard of or used before I
12:15 - think it's incredibly helpful when
12:17 - you're planning but I'm just gonna
12:19 - quickly click on it it is codable
12:22 - unlocked so all levels are open for you
12:25 - to play in Snee Borg asteroid eeeh and
12:28 - bug world
12:29 - so if you want to learn a little bit
12:31 - about what your students would be doing
12:33 - this is the place to go and you'll see
12:35 - that everything is unlocked on the sides
12:38 - including the game levels when you click
12:41 - on the treehouse in the middle I'm just
12:43 - going to take a moment right now we have
12:45 - this open to tilt I guess some of you
12:48 - this is all very new but to a lot of you
12:50 - you're like what in the world is this so
12:52 - we spend so much time the summer at
12:55 - creating fuzzy copia which is the new
12:57 - like home planet of the fuzzes we've
13:00 - been we've been following their
13:01 - adventures
13:02 - years and years but and now we get to
13:04 - see their home planet and this is going
13:06 - to be the hub for all your students work
13:09 - so they can go to the tree house to
13:12 - select their mission which is right over
13:14 - to the for the game levels they can go
13:16 - to make mazes over here in this little
13:19 - maze maker Hut they can go to build
13:23 - their own fuzz in the fuzz build or a
13:25 - tree house and then they can go make
13:28 - their own games in the game maker game
13:31 - designer garden there's so much
13:33 - happening here you're gonna be adding a
13:35 - lot to this over the coming school year
13:37 - it's a great way to like keep students
13:39 - engaged so they can see their worth
13:41 - building soon they're going to be able
13:42 - to kind of customize the way that this
13:44 - looks and we have some really exciting
13:46 - plans for fuzz topia for the our code
13:49 - this year but one thing that's really
13:51 - cool is that this will sync between what
13:53 - students are doing at home and at school
13:55 - so if those if your students go home and
13:59 - their parents are thrilled that they're
14:01 - learning to code and they decide to go
14:02 - ahead and get a codable for parents
14:05 - account those are different levels it's
14:08 - not going to interfere with what you're
14:09 - doing at school but this will sync up
14:12 - between the two accounts so kids have
14:14 - some sort of continuity between what
14:16 - they're doing at school what they're
14:17 - doing at home and they can really like
14:19 - invest in collecting all of their fuzzes
14:21 - and managing all their creations and I'm
14:24 - really go hog-wild with all the cool
14:26 - things that they can do the last thing
14:29 - to point out is that the little Hart
14:32 - house over here and that actually is
14:34 - where they're going to collect all their
14:36 - badges and achievements and everything
14:40 - that they've been working so hard for
14:41 - and codable will be collected in that
14:43 - little house so yeah there was a lot of
14:46 - exciting things that we've updated in
14:48 - the game I hope you guys like this I
14:49 - just wanted to point this out because I
14:51 - know some of you are gonna come in on
14:52 - the first day of school open up your
14:54 - eyes oh my god so here you go
14:58 - a quick little tour of Suns topia yeah I
15:01 - just also wanted to point out I'm seeing
15:03 - a lot of comments that are saying that
15:04 - you used to create a student like a fake
15:07 - teacher account as a student to go
15:09 - through the game hi here
15:10 - you this is a lot easier and it's always
15:12 - right here on your teacher dashboard if
15:15 - you need to use it it's also I think
15:17 - somebody pointed out it's a great way to
15:19 - demo a lesson to students if you want to
15:21 - play alongside them so that's another
15:23 - use for it so at this point I'm just
15:26 - gonna pause really quick we've gone
15:28 - through setting up a class getting
15:31 - students logged in and then seeing what
15:33 - students might be learning through the
15:35 - teacher demo mode are there any
15:36 - questions and that we can address right
15:39 - now before we move forward to the rest
15:41 - of the dashboard
15:42 - um no questions and I can see so far I
15:45 - look I'll give people a minute to write
15:48 - those in it they have them but I did
15:49 - want to address
15:50 - Deborah Kirby actually made a really
15:52 - good point show saying it'd be helpful
15:54 - if we could know everything like a text
15:56 - pop-up or something to know what it is
15:59 - on post ouvea and I totally agree I
16:04 - think we're going to be adding some
16:07 - support documents for Fuzz topia so that
16:11 - you know everything that's going on
16:13 - there you can always check support dr.
16:15 - kovac on we have help articles for just
16:17 - about everything but yeah that's a good
16:19 - point maybe we should add something in
16:21 - teacher materials
16:22 - to cover that your students however are
16:25 - going to be guided through Fuzz topia so
16:27 - nothing is going to be unlocked when
16:29 - they start and then as they progress
16:31 - through the game because they're
16:33 - learning new concepts those buildings
16:36 - those tree houses and all the different
16:37 - areas will unlock for them and kind of
16:39 - give them a tutorial on how to use it
16:41 - what they're going to be doing and so
16:43 - like we actually changed a little bit of
16:45 - how things are unlocked first for kids
16:47 - so once they unlock the fuzz builder for
16:51 - example it'll pop up here they'll unlock
16:53 - the building and then they'll start
16:55 - collecting costumes and decorations for
16:58 - their fuzzes as they're continuing
17:01 - through codable so it's going to be like
17:03 - a gradual process where we introduce
17:05 - students to it but I totally agree w I
17:07 - need something for teachers to know like
17:09 - what more old are all these building
17:11 - that's a great
17:12 - yeah yeah definitely okay so there's no
17:17 - one question can I make a cart back-end
17:20 - or my asks can I make a hard copy of the
17:22 - fuzz Tokyo page I would it would be
17:25 - great if I had a list of what each place
17:27 - oh so I we've got an idea I think we'll
17:32 - make some sort of a map I mean we'll put
17:34 - it in our help center but then we can
17:36 - also send it out to you guys as a
17:38 - resource but some sort of a map with
17:39 - everything labeled and a short
17:41 - description would just be a really good
17:43 - thing to have since it is new for a lot
17:45 - of teachers yeah
17:46 - all right feedback in the Marigny yeah
17:48 - so we've gone through teacher demo mode
17:50 - the next part of the webinar that I'm
17:53 - gonna walk through is how you can use
17:55 - your teacher - or to manage your classes
17:58 - we've got a lot of really great
17:59 - questions thank you to those of you who
18:01 - RSVP'd and wrote in questions about
18:03 - managing classes and I'm gonna try to
18:06 - address them all now and then we'll
18:07 - cover what we don't address in the Q&A
18:10 - so when you get into your teacher
18:12 - dashboard you'll always select the class
18:14 - that you're looking to teach for that
18:16 - day if you can remember back at the
18:18 - beginning I created my webinar class so
18:20 - that's what I'm going to click on to use
18:23 - as I walk through these features at the
18:25 - top of your dashboard these ones at the
18:27 - top here where I'm driving my mouse
18:29 - these are linked to your specific class
18:33 - that you just chose so I am on webinar
18:35 - class and the first thing I'm going to
18:37 - talk about is assignments so assignments
18:41 - is basically the way that we describe
18:44 - how which levels of the game your
18:47 - students are able to plan you will see
18:50 - that if you selected k5 as your grade
18:54 - then everyone whether or not you
18:58 - selected k5 or not potable automatically
19:01 - assigns levels if you don't want your
19:04 - students to be able to play a specific
19:06 - level all you need to do is click on
19:10 - assign that means that when your
19:12 - students log in to the game they will
19:15 - not be able to play the level that you
19:17 - have unassigned if all levels are
19:20 - assigned
19:21 - you give them the class code and they
19:23 - log in they will be able to move through
19:26 - the levels at their own pace without
19:29 - ever being stopped at any point so I
19:33 - point out the assignments tab has a
19:35 - really useful way for teachers to
19:38 - control how quickly their students are
19:40 - moving through the game and kind of use
19:43 - that as a tool to shape your lesson
19:46 - plans so if you are interested in just
19:50 - having students do one set of levels a
19:53 - day because you are also teaching other
19:55 - content in your class you can unassign
19:58 - the other levels students will only be
20:01 - able to play the ones that are lit up in
20:03 - green and then the next day you can
20:05 - assign the next level I do actually
20:09 - if you can you just show that you'll
20:11 - need to click but over here on this side
20:13 - tab you actually have like a global
20:15 - assignments page that you can use if you
20:18 - want to assign things to multiple
20:20 - classes you don't have to go to each
20:21 - class page you can actually just go to
20:23 - this assignments page and assign to all
20:26 - classes or to just like say you want to
20:29 - have all your third grade classes on the
20:31 - same pacing you can just assign it to
20:33 - all your third grade classes that's a
20:34 - great place to go to do that so there's
20:37 - there's two different ways that you can
20:38 - do this awesome
20:40 - Elmo so this is the assignments tab like
20:42 - I said I'm going to move forward into
20:45 - the lessons tab again these are lessons
20:48 - that codable recommends based on the
20:52 - grades that you selected when you
20:54 - created your class so when I set up my
20:57 - webinar class I selected k5 as my grade
21:00 - band quotable is then going to recommend
21:04 - curriculum recommend lessons that are
21:07 - appropriate for that grade level so if I
21:10 - have selected only kindergarten classes
21:12 - these lessons would look different there
21:15 - would be fewer lessons in some of these
21:17 - trickier units as you get into a some
21:22 - more advanced content it would it paces
21:25 - it for you but you can always edit the
21:28 - grade levels that you've selected and
21:31 - then that
21:31 - will impact the pacing that codable
21:34 - recommends you show them that oh yeah
21:37 - absolutely so right now I'm k5 I'm just
21:40 - going to edit my class setting which is
21:43 - over here I'm going to select
21:44 - kindergarten just as an example going to
21:48 - save my changes and then when I head
21:52 - back to lessons you'll see that a lot of
21:55 - those units that were covering some more
21:58 - advanced content are gone so
22:00 - kindergarten has these units sequence
22:03 - and conditions with the accompanying
22:05 - lessons that are appropriate for
22:07 - kindergarten now if you notice that your
22:10 - kindergarteners are moving through these
22:13 - lessons and they're doing a really great
22:15 - job and they are capable of taking on
22:17 - some trickier content always remember
22:20 - that you can edit the grade in your
22:22 - class settings k5 will give you access
22:25 - to everything since it covers all the
22:28 - grades and that will open up the rest of
22:32 - the units and the lessons um so I'm just
22:35 - going to dive into an example lesson if
22:39 - you guys have any questions again please
22:41 - feel free to write them in after this
22:43 - we'll take a pause and to answer some
22:44 - questions about assignments and lessons
22:46 - so I'm going to start at unit 1 sequence
22:50 - and the first lesson is introduction
22:53 - there were some questions that were
22:56 - written in about the difference between
23:00 - what is accessible on a free teacher
23:02 - account and then what is accessible on a
23:04 - paid account sequence one introduction
23:07 - is a lesson that's available to everyone
23:10 - who's watching here so what this is
23:13 - definitely a great place to look to see
23:15 - if our lessons that we provide would
23:17 - work for you and your students I'm just
23:19 - gonna walk through what the lesson holds
23:22 - so each lesson starts with a short
23:25 - description of the lesson it covers the
23:27 - objectives so for this first lesson
23:29 - students are going to be able to move a
23:32 - robot which is actually another
23:34 - classmate or a teacher to move across a
23:38 - room to perform different actions like
23:40 - spinning and jumping I'm using
23:42 - programming like
23:43 - so it then covers vocabulary and all of
23:48 - our vocabulary has been updated this
23:49 - year so definitions are a bit simpler
23:53 - um easier for younger students to
23:55 - understand which is great
23:56 - each lesson then moves into direct
23:59 - instruction so kind of the philosophy of
24:04 - these lessons is a gradual release model
24:07 - so we want it's kind of like an I do we
24:10 - do you do format so the I do is when you
24:14 - as the teacher are introducing a new
24:17 - concept and this is maybe you're going
24:20 - over new vocabulary you're asking
24:23 - students but they already know about the
24:25 - content that you're covering so for
24:28 - example in this first lesson we're
24:30 - talking about what is something a
24:32 - programmer might make on what do
24:34 - programmers do what how do they use code
24:37 - so it's really discussion based I'm
24:40 - going over an introduction of the
24:42 - content for the day the second section
24:45 - of each lesson is the guided practice
24:47 - activity that is the we do and these are
24:51 - unplugged activities that you can do
24:54 - with your students where they are
24:56 - getting a really hands-on tangible
24:59 - experience with the coding concept that
25:01 - you're introducing that day so in this
25:04 - example students are acting as
25:06 - programmers and they're applying
25:08 - knowledge of programming language and
25:10 - sequence to command a robot and I'm you
25:12 - can't see if I'm saying that in quotes
25:14 - because it's a it's another person to
25:16 - move forward and jump so again this is
25:19 - unplugged and every single lesson that
25:22 - you'll see on our teacher dashboard that
25:24 - we've created are hung flowed Plaisance
25:26 - for students to really get that hands-on
25:28 - experience first so they're learning
25:30 - about it in an unplugged hands-on way on
25:33 - the final section is actually the
25:38 - independent practice that's the you do
25:40 - section of the lesson where students are
25:43 - logging into codable and we recommend
25:45 - certain less levels themed levels to go
25:49 - with each lesson so in this example
25:52 - students are going to be logging into
25:54 - Smee Borg and they'll be clicking on the
25:56 - first set of levels in sequence these
25:59 - are directly tied to the sequence
26:02 - concepts that we just went over in the
26:05 - direct instruction and the guided
26:07 - practice activity each lesson then wraps
26:10 - up with a check for understanding these
26:12 - are usually group discussions maybe
26:14 - they're a short reflection for the
26:16 - student to participate in where they
26:18 - kind of sum up what it was learned that
26:20 - day
26:21 - are there any questions before we move
26:24 - on about these lessons because I know I
26:27 - just went over a lot of information
26:29 - there um we are getting lots of love
26:34 - people are so excited like oh my gosh
26:36 - this is made for me um so thank you guys
26:39 - I'm so happy that you all like this I
26:43 - did want to address so Scott was asking
26:45 - he's a parent um and they are curious
26:49 - about whether or not to use the parent
26:51 - or school version I would say for the
26:54 - vast majority like 99.9% of parents the
26:59 - parent version is what you want unless
27:01 - you are a home schooler or you are in
27:04 - some sort of like a cottage school
27:05 - situation I definitely recommend the
27:08 - parent version using colorful at home
27:10 - because our like program and pricing and
27:15 - everything is set up for like school
27:17 - users on the school version and the
27:20 - parent version likewise I set up for
27:22 - home use for use by a parent we are
27:26 - actually working on a lot of materials
27:28 - for parents this school year we just
27:31 - added progress tracking and for parents
27:33 - teachers actually you can share with
27:36 - that that parent code they don't even
27:38 - need a parents account to arlenian
27:40 - account that they don't need to like
27:42 - upgrade to the paid version to view what
27:44 - their kids are doing at school but if
27:46 - you choose to get the parent version
27:48 - you're gonna have access to progress
27:50 - tracking for both school and home and
27:52 - then we're working on a lot of these
27:54 - same materials for parents but in a
27:57 - better context like for what you're
28:01 - actually doing at home so like a lot of
28:03 - this stuff is set up for a class
28:05 - situation with multiple students like
28:08 - lots and lots of students in other cases
28:10 - and so for parents it's just best to
28:12 - stick with the parent version but if you
28:15 - are interested like say you are on one
28:16 - schooler or you do have an interest in
28:21 - using our school product at home please
28:24 - feel free to email me at Gretchen at
28:27 - Kohler Bolcom or support code will calm
28:30 - and we can chat with you about getting
28:33 - something set up for you so definitely
28:35 - do that but again I just want to
28:37 - reiterate the parent version is probably
28:39 - what you want to go with this absolutely
28:41 - okay so again this was the lesson and
28:45 - we'll go over what lesson library is in
28:47 - just a little bit and we're going to
28:49 - move on to student creations and
28:51 - actually Gretchen is going to talk about
28:53 - how you kind of just touched on it but
28:56 - if you want to say it again what we're
28:58 - doing to share student creations that
29:00 - students are creating in class with
29:02 - families yeah I'm gonna go put it and
29:05 - show you guys what you can see so when
29:08 - your students go we don't have any
29:10 - creation here we have a class that does
29:11 - yeah totally class of what I'm chick
29:14 - cave the k5 so when your students are
29:20 - unlocking those areas infos topia like a
29:23 - buzz builder and the maze maker and all
29:25 - these other sections of culpable they're
29:29 - gonna start creating their own closets
29:30 - and they're so cute I just love all the
29:33 - things that students make we actually do
29:35 - a feed of them like on the back side and
29:37 - go to and it's just adorable
29:39 - but um you can actually view them all
29:43 - from here and you can view the code that
29:44 - they wrote and then you can send this it
29:47 - prints a little PDF that you can send
29:50 - home to parents and actually if they go
29:54 - ahead and set up a global account at
29:55 - home they can view all of their child's
29:59 - creations from their parent dashboard
30:01 - and they can log in using the class code
30:05 - at home and play with their fusses or if
30:08 - they decide to get a parent account they
30:10 - and actually play with those buzzes at
30:13 - home as well so it's just really neat to
30:16 - be able to share everything that they're
30:18 - learning with their family the other
30:22 - thing that they can see are their mazes
30:25 - so in codable there's a way for students
30:28 - 1/3 yeah um so we actually have the
30:32 - option for kids to wonder when they're
30:34 - learning new concepts like saying
30:35 - they've they've gotten to conditions and
30:39 - they've sort of mastered conditions
30:40 - maze maker will unlock and they'll have
30:42 - the option to start making their own
30:44 - levels using conditions and then as they
30:47 - unlock loops they'll have the option to
30:49 - add a maze and create a maze that uses
30:51 - loops and it's really just so incredible
30:55 - through the things that kids come up
30:57 - with I used to make all of the levels I
30:59 - still make all of the levels in codable
31:01 - and I was like I know basically every
31:05 - like way that you can make a level
31:07 - uncodable so we did a maze native
31:09 - competition I guess like a year ago and
31:11 - I was blown away there were so many
31:13 - creative and just inspiring pieces that
31:16 - kids came up with so it's a great way to
31:18 - like assess how well they're
31:20 - understanding the concept but also just
31:22 - to get them thinking creatively using
31:24 - the design thinking process and learning
31:27 - about you know basically working
31:30 - backwards through a problem
31:31 - yeah absolutely so like Gretchen said
31:33 - these the creative applications can be
31:35 - used kind of as an informal assessment
31:38 - and when you're teaching to see how
31:40 - students are asking the concepts and
31:41 - actually applying them in a creative way
31:44 - um another tool that we have here for
31:47 - tracking student progress is the
31:49 - progress tab so we did get a couple
31:52 - questions written in on the RSVP that
31:54 - was asking about grades does codable
31:56 - give grades how do i grade this work um
32:00 - so that's going to be really dependent
32:02 - on you as a teacher but besides the
32:05 - informal assessments with these student
32:07 - creations you can use this progress tab
32:09 - to see their level of progress how far
32:13 - they are moving through the game so
32:15 - which concepts they're covering it you
32:18 - can see Alex my student here has
32:20 - finished si
32:22 - Wynn's alice is just starting and my
32:24 - other students are further behind so
32:26 - that's just a way for you to gauge how
32:28 - students are moving through the levels
32:30 - and which which concepts are mastering
32:32 - you also have this option to click on
32:34 - view standards progress and this is
32:37 - going to show you which computer science
32:40 - standards for each unit so for sequence
32:43 - conditions etc your students have
32:46 - started are working on or have mastered
32:50 - and these computer science standards if
32:53 - you go to codable Java Khan / outcomes
32:56 - you'll see how we put these computer
32:59 - science standards together for sequence
33:02 - they cover State Standards and other
33:07 - other computer science standards that
33:09 - we've put together to cover everything
33:12 - that you might need to be tracking for
33:14 - your school so again this progress tab
33:18 - it's covering in progress as well as
33:20 - standards progress and you can kind of
33:22 - use that information how you need to in
33:25 - order to provide grades about something
33:28 - you're interested in doing but we just
33:29 - wanted to give you the information here
33:31 - in case you may need it so before we
33:34 - move on I'll just point out that there
33:36 - are also tabs at the top here for
33:39 - students and for class settings both of
33:41 - these are useful for managing your class
33:44 - students you'll be able to see your
33:47 - class roster print their login
33:49 - instructions again and add students to
33:51 - your class and then class settings like
33:54 - I showed before is a good way to edit
33:56 - what grade your class is maybe you want
33:59 - to change the class code or assign the
34:01 - class to another teacher so that they
34:04 - can have the information for your class
34:07 - this is the place to do it there's also
34:09 - you can see this danger zone there are
34:12 - some things over here that you might
34:13 - need for resetting all student progress
34:15 - and other things like that if you have
34:18 - questions about this please let us know
34:20 - some of the stuff that I saw in the RSVP
34:24 - questions about transferring students
34:26 - we're going to go over when we talk
34:28 - about these tabs here on the left but we
34:31 - just went over all of the different
34:33 - features that codable teacher
34:35 - - word offers for managing a specific
34:38 - class are there any questions Richard
34:40 - that are that have been written in about
34:42 - the times that we covered so far really
34:47 - only just one question about what grades
34:50 - clinical is appropriate for so cloacal
34:52 - is focused on groups k25 we do have
34:55 - people who use it with younger students
34:57 - may be like pre-k or teaching students
35:00 - we also have people that use it in
35:02 - middle school it's their just introduced
35:04 - including to their kids for the first
35:05 - time obviously if you're using it with
35:08 - older students or younger students
35:09 - they're going to move at a different
35:10 - pace then what codable might like assume
35:15 - so if they're younger they may move a
35:17 - little bit slower or if they're older
35:19 - than even move a little bit faster and
35:22 - you can adjust everything from your
35:24 - assignments page based on what you see
35:26 - happening in your classroom so like I
35:29 - said you can totally manage using it
35:31 - with kids outside of those age ranges if
35:34 - you want to but yes it is primarily
35:36 - focused on K through 5 totally great so
35:42 - as we move on I'll direct your attention
35:45 - to this left menu on the side of your
35:48 - dashboard if you remember this is where
35:50 - we found teacher demo mode before the
35:52 - resources here on the left side of your
35:55 - dashboard are not linked to one specific
35:57 - class so this is where you want to go
35:59 - like arch and said if you're assigning
36:01 - to multiple classes at one time or you
36:05 - want to manage student transferring
36:07 - across multiple classes you'll go to
36:10 - this left side menu so I'm going to
36:13 - start with the lesson library we take in
36:17 - one quick question oh yeah so it knows
36:25 - asking if we have the option to add
36:28 - multiple like share a class by the
36:30 - teacher say you have a co teacher or
36:32 - something
36:32 - right now there's only one teacher per
36:34 - class but you can say you're on the
36:37 - codable school plan and you're an admin
36:41 - or like say you're the tech teacher for
36:43 - at school and there's a first-grade
36:44 - teacher who wants to add their class
36:47 - you can add teachers and assign them to
36:51 - a specific class if you are on a
36:53 - quotable school plan but for the basic
36:56 - free version there is no way to have
36:59 - multiple teachers and there's no way to
37:00 - have multiple teachers on a class in the
37:03 - school version either you would just
37:04 - view it as an admin and you would see
37:06 - all the classes and then that teacher
37:07 - would be assigned to it if you have
37:09 - questions about our admin tools please
37:12 - feel free to email me Gretchen at
37:15 - koat.com or Bree at coldwell comm we're
37:17 - happy to go over that with you children
37:20 - great so like I said we're moving into
37:24 - the lesson library the lesson library is
37:27 - the place where you can find lessons
37:30 - that are not linked to are not well
37:33 - they're not all linked to our core
37:35 - content there are a lot of them are
37:37 - supplementary that you can use to cover
37:39 - different content besides just the
37:43 - coding concepts that are covered in our
37:45 - core curriculum so for exists ill Terr
37:49 - feature on the left side it's kind of
37:51 - like what you would use if you were
37:53 - shopping where you know you're looking
37:55 - for and you can filter based on what
37:58 - you're looking for specifically so if I
38:00 - am interested in finding kindergarten
38:03 - lessons and let's say I want to cover
38:07 - the coding concept of sequence and then
38:11 - I can choose a content area let's say I
38:13 - really want to do an introduction to
38:15 - robotics unit the lesson library filters
38:19 - and offers you lessons that are directly
38:22 - linked to those features that you just
38:24 - filtered for um so this does bring up
38:26 - our robotics unit where we've partnered
38:29 - with Wonder workshop and the - and dot
38:32 - robots and you can click on these
38:35 - lessons again they're structured the
38:38 - same way that the lessons were when we
38:40 - went over them in the lessons tab where
38:42 - there are scripted and they cover
38:44 - everything you'll need to use to run the
38:47 - lesson if you find something in the
38:49 - lesson library that you want to teach
38:51 - you can click Save the lesson you'll
38:53 - choose the class that you want to save
38:56 - it for I'm and that will save right to
38:59 - your
38:59 - says dashboard so you won't need to go
39:01 - back into the Lawson library to find it
39:02 - again it'll be saved which is really
39:05 - nice so again visit these are a lot of
39:08 - these are supplementary lessons that you
39:12 - might want to use in other content areas
39:15 - not just coding but it shows you how
39:18 - coding concepts can be linked to all of
39:21 - these other content areas so for example
39:23 - if I'm interested in integrating a
39:26 - coding lesson into en la I can click
39:30 - English language arts the tab over here
39:32 - I'm and it'll filter into these lessons
39:34 - that I can click on to teach different
39:37 - things so definitely I recommend
39:39 - exploring this lesson library to see
39:42 - what is available to you you'll notice
39:45 - that there's a little quotable school
39:46 - icon on some of these that means that
39:48 - those lessons are just accessible to
39:51 - schools with the quotable school account
39:53 - but if it doesn't have the icon then
39:56 - it's open for you to click on and you
39:59 - can go through these lessons to see if
40:01 - it's something you'd want to integrate
40:03 - in your class and if it is a paid lesson
40:06 - you can actually view a preview FL so
40:09 - for those of you who are considering
40:11 - incredible school for your for your
40:13 - students you can get a view of what our
40:17 - paid lessons look like cool so the next
40:22 - look we kind of touched on assignments
40:25 - already so I'm not going to click on it
40:27 - but that's where you would want to go if
40:28 - you were assigning levels to multiple
40:31 - classes at once the students tab is what
40:35 - I want to go to now because we did get a
40:37 - lot of questions since there's a lot of
40:39 - teachers who are starting their school
40:41 - year and want to transfer students from
40:43 - one class to another maybe classes are
40:46 - moving up a grade and you want to
40:48 - transfer some students from the
40:50 - kindergarten class to the first grade
40:51 - class this is where you can do all of
40:54 - that really easily and transfer in bulk
40:56 - so I'll show you quickly if I wanted to
41:00 - transfer let's say I have some students
41:02 - in my first grade class who I want to
41:05 - transfer into my second grade class I
41:07 - would click on the students tab I would
41:10 - select the students
41:12 - that are in my first-grade class that I
41:15 - want to transfer you can select as many
41:19 - as you need and then there's this purple
41:21 - transfer selected students button I
41:24 - click on that there's a drop-down menu
41:27 - it's going to ask me which class I want
41:29 - to put them in so I want to transfer
41:31 - them to second grade I'm going to click
41:33 - on the second class and transfer
41:35 - students so it's that easy now you'll
41:38 - see that my two students here that were
41:41 - originally in first grade
41:42 - I've now transferred into second grade
41:45 - so this is the place you can go to do
41:47 - all of that transferring from one class
41:51 - to another which I know a lot of people
41:53 - were interested in so if there are any
41:56 - questions about transferring students in
41:59 - bulk let us know I'll pause right now to
42:02 - see if there's anything that we need I'm
42:08 - just like reading through the chat
42:09 - there's a lot of discussion and on the
42:11 - lesson library holiday it looks like
42:13 - we've answered all the questions people
42:18 - were asking like if they're on the game
42:20 - access plan of codable school would they
42:23 - have access to these lessons no you do
42:26 - not have access to all of the lessons in
42:29 - the lesson library if you're on the game
42:30 - access plan but you will have access to
42:32 - the free one so if if you're on if you
42:36 - have purchased the curriculum add-on and
42:38 - don't have access to these but if you
42:39 - don't then you'll just look at the
42:41 - quotable school icon but you'd have the
42:43 - ones that don't have that on it and then
42:45 - we have let's see oh people are asking
42:55 - if there will be a recorded version of
42:57 - the webinar and oh yes yeah definitely
43:00 - so if this is being recorded right now
43:02 - we'll be sure to have the final version
43:04 - posted after we're done so you can head
43:07 - on back to review anything we've talked
43:10 - about also I'm offering trainings for
43:13 - teachers during the start of this school
43:15 - year so if you want to walk through the
43:18 - dashboard again one-on-one and kind of
43:20 - go over just what you're interested
43:23 - or what you need more clarification on
43:24 - please reach out to me my email is Hana
43:27 - at potable comm and I'm happy to help
43:30 - you walk through that so someone was
43:32 - asking if there was an easy way to move
43:33 - students from first grade to second
43:35 - grade classes instead of putting all the
43:37 - names in again and I know you just went
43:39 - over that so I hope that that answered
43:41 - their question but I did want to be sure
43:44 - to address for people who are using
43:47 - either Google classroom or clever and
43:51 - soon class link actually really excited
43:54 - about um theirs
43:57 - so if you're using clever or class link
43:59 - I would assume I'm not as familiar with
44:00 - classic yet but codable will
44:03 - automatically update based on what you
44:05 - put into Kluber um if you are using if
44:11 - you're using Google classroom you will
44:13 - need to import your students again
44:15 - so you'd wipe out what you have is is
44:17 - seeing includable and then import them
44:19 - again it is not a two-way integration so
44:21 - it's not going to update live and if you
44:24 - aren't using either of those options
44:26 - then yes the class transfer the transfer
44:30 - selected students option that Hannah
44:32 - just showed you would be the way to go
44:35 - we do have bulk import built into the
44:39 - global dashboard when you're creating a
44:40 - class if you decide you wanted to start
44:42 - fresh and add all your students at once
44:44 - and say you have like 25 classes like so
44:47 - many of you do we have a bulk import
44:49 - option where you can just copy/paste
44:51 - your rosters from a spreadsheet and then
44:53 - I can eat the classes and stuff so
44:55 - that's really quick and easy to do if
44:57 - you don't have clever or some of the
45:00 - other options available to you so I am
45:04 - going to jump in a lot of you wrote in
45:07 - asking what is new what is new so I am
45:09 - going to show you what is new for
45:12 - teachers and Gretchen's gonna go over
45:14 - share to touch on a bunch of them but
45:16 - what is new for students so a big thing
45:19 - that is new that you guys I hope will
45:22 - love is the resource center it's at the
45:25 - top of this left menu and when you click
45:28 - on it this is where we are going to put
45:31 - all of our public resources everything
45:34 - you might need to teach with Co
45:36 - to show potable to your students to get
45:40 - started again so I'll just kind of walk
45:42 - through what is in the Resource Center
45:44 - there's the getting started kit that we
45:46 - had that was on the homepage when we
45:49 - logged in this getting started kit is
45:51 - going to be really helpful for those of
45:53 - you that want to know what codable is
45:56 - about what students are going to learn
45:58 - what content is going to be covered
46:01 - before actually using it with your
46:04 - students so there's three parts to the
46:06 - getting started kit there's a guy that
46:07 - is going to help you get set up with
46:10 - devices which we talked about with the
46:12 - code cards and then there's also an
46:15 - updated potable field guide and our
46:18 - updated scope and sequence so the
46:20 - codable field guide I think I actually
46:22 - have it up here this is a brand new
46:26 - guide that we've created that covers
46:28 - everything in codable that you might
46:32 - need to teach with it so it walks you
46:34 - through each of the three worlds what
46:36 - students are learning and what it will
46:38 - actually look like for them in the game
46:40 - it talks about our creative applications
46:43 - like we mentioned with building fuzzies
46:45 - and making mazes and then gives you a
46:48 - breakdown of our curriculum if that's
46:50 - something you're interested in using and
46:53 - some tips and tricks for how to
46:54 - implement the lessons
46:56 - so again if you're interested in
46:59 - learning more about codable what it's
47:00 - all about
47:01 - definitely check out this getting
47:03 - started kit it's in the resource center
47:05 - of your teacher dashboard and that
47:07 - includes our scope and sequence gesso so
47:10 - a lot of you have asked for scope and
47:12 - sequence over the years and we had one
47:14 - we didn't have a place to put it so I'm
47:16 - so happy we have this resource center
47:18 - because now all of those things that
47:20 - we've been creating over the years I'm
47:21 - just like sending the people over the
47:23 - automail are available here we're going
47:26 - to be adding a ton to this page over the
47:28 - next couple of months but yeah if you're
47:32 - looking for a scope and sequence check
47:34 - out the getting started kit it is in
47:35 - there so yeah yeah the other big thing
47:39 - that you probably see and are super
47:41 - excited about is we are starting to be
47:44 - staying answer keys so as a teacher we
47:47 - know that you know working through
47:50 - problems with your students is really
47:52 - important but sometimes you just get
47:54 - stuff and you need you feel like you
47:56 - need to know the answer to help this is
47:58 - the place to go so these are all the
48:01 - solutions for the smiie board lessons
48:03 - and we're working on asteroid iya and
48:05 - bug world as well and one think those
48:07 - are done they'll show up here in the
48:09 - answer keys of the Resource Center so
48:12 - these are all of this meatboy answer
48:14 - keys again right here Resource Center
48:17 - next to the getting started kit you can
48:19 - view the solutions there the other
48:23 - resources that are available in the
48:25 - Resource Center are the teacher guides
48:29 - teacher guides will walk you through all
48:32 - of this all of the content again that
48:34 - you are there students are learning in
48:37 - codable there are videos that are meant
48:40 - for you where you can watch them and
48:42 - learn more about the coding content if
48:45 - you are confused about any of the
48:46 - conditions or loops or any of the
48:48 - content that we're covering this is a
48:50 - place great place to go for you and then
48:52 - there are also classroom materials
48:54 - resources for your classroom posters you
48:57 - can pull it up and we're going to be
48:59 - adding to these all of the time so that
49:01 - is a quick overview of the Resource
49:03 - Center definitely poke around it's a
49:05 - great place well like Gretchen said
49:07 - we'll add to it a bunch can you show
49:09 - them one of the oh yeah so the end is
49:13 - actually working on updating all these
49:14 - but I do want to go ahead and show you
49:16 - so many people don't know that this
49:18 - exists and so I wanted to be sure to
49:20 - show everyone this is where you can go
49:24 - to learn about a concept before you
49:25 - teach it it sort of like codable for
49:28 - teachers so we talked about what see in
49:31 - this example this is our sequence guide
49:34 - what sequence is how it's used in
49:36 - programming some of the core like
49:38 - vocabulary vocabulary that you want to
49:41 - cover just explaining it to you in
49:44 - simple terms because I know so many of
49:47 - you don't have a background in computer
49:48 - science like oh these concepts are so
49:50 - new to me so we just wrote everything
49:52 - down in an easy-to-understand way so
49:56 - that you can
49:57 - speak with a little bit more confidence
49:58 - when you're talking to your students and
49:59 - answering their questions and then we'll
50:02 - address what codable is teaching
50:04 - on-screen and how it works and how it
50:07 - relates to what this concept actually is
50:10 - in programming okay it's not everything
50:15 - really wanting to hello I think I think
50:17 - that is everything that was a lot so if
50:20 - you guys have questions please ask them
50:22 - reach out to us this video again will be
50:25 - recorded so no need to memorize it all
50:27 - right now um so I'm gonna give a couple
50:30 - minutes for people to ask questions if
50:34 - they have them you can go over our Q&A
50:37 - document but yeah so but I did want to
50:44 - be sure to let you guys know we are
50:49 - going to be adding a lot less spoiler so
50:51 - if you have questions you can always
50:53 - reach out to us at support at codable
50:55 - comm we also are doing a lot of work on
50:59 - our YouTube channel looking to add a lot
51:01 - more content there for you and for
51:04 - students and for parents so if you want
51:07 - to subscribe to our youtube channel just
51:09 - click the subscribe button somewhere on
51:12 - the screen up right below and you'll get
51:15 - updates about men we post new content
51:18 - we're also going to be doing a lot for
51:21 - parents this year so if you want to
51:23 - share that code card or any of your
51:27 - students creations with them that way
51:29 - you can be sure that they're staying
51:31 - updated on what's happening in your
51:33 - classroom and they're gonna be getting a
51:35 - lot of really cool new features this
51:37 - year as well um so let me see if we have
51:39 - any question great okay so they all had
51:46 - a question about Australia and
51:48 - connecting the concept of strings and
51:50 - colored a color glass sure as you shoot
51:52 - at this level seems hard put together
51:54 - can you explain a little bit of like
51:58 - what the connection is or do you want me
52:00 - to about what's happening on screen and
52:03 - then also where you can find more
52:05 - materials on like what's actually going
52:08 - on on screen yeah well so to find
52:10 - materials that will be in the resource
52:12 - center and that we were just on and if
52:15 - you go to those teacher guides there is
52:18 - a teacher guide for string variables
52:20 - array and Ruby variables and what am I
52:24 - forgetting
52:24 - strings arrays integers integers so
52:28 - there's guys for all of those and
52:29 - epidemic it shows you the screen
52:31 - captures of the actual game and talks
52:33 - through those how those concepts are
52:36 - being applied do you want to give a
52:38 - little bit of background about it um I'm
52:42 - sorry I was reading I'm like how how the
52:46 - how the link between the game and the
52:49 - variables oh yeah yeah so basically
52:51 - what's happening when you are assigning
52:53 - a variable of property or sorry
52:56 - assigning a variable of value in
52:59 - programming you need to use you need to
53:04 - make sure that there that you're either
53:06 - using a string which is a string of
53:08 - characters so we use colors represent
53:11 - that so it appears on the screen as
53:13 - purple written out so kids are learning
53:16 - like what the value types are in in
53:20 - coding when you're using variables
53:23 - there's those three different types
53:24 - there's also integers which is just a
53:27 - number and then there's arrays which can
53:29 - be a list of items it can be either a
53:32 - string or an integer and so for our idea
53:36 - we're really just trying to get them
53:37 - familiar with variable types and also
53:40 - like assigning value to things and then
53:42 - the game is the great way to hook them a
53:44 - awesome way to make sure that those
53:47 - concepts are hitting home and if
53:50 - students are really grasping like what a
53:52 - variable is is to progress them into the
53:55 - game designer as they're moving through
53:57 - our idea they're going to unlock
53:58 - properties which are just another name
54:01 - for variables within the game designer
54:04 - and they can actually start creating and
54:06 - designing their filling game and
54:07 - modifying properties within the code to
54:10 - make adjustments either to make it
54:12 - easier or harder or like a different
54:15 - flair to it
54:16 - so we have a really cool project where
54:18 - you can team students up to talk about
54:22 - like what kind of game they want and
54:24 - can make a game suitable for their
54:25 - partner and then they get feedback and
54:27 - to iterate on their design so there's a
54:29 - lot of stuff happening with variables
54:31 - within asteroid yeah but I would
54:34 - definitely be sure to check out the
54:35 - resources that cover all of that so that
54:37 - you can um talk about it with your
54:40 - students yeah and you can also reach out
54:42 - to us anytime you have questions always
54:48 - yes so they will practice they'll ask
54:50 - people if they practice these concepts
54:52 - when they build yes okay I don't see any
54:58 - other questions coming in so yeah if you
55:05 - guys need anything or we're going to
55:07 - share actually last thing on my cover
55:09 - we're gonna share all the resources of
55:11 - resources that we talked about in the
55:15 - description below this video after the
55:17 - fact I'm going to add a timestamp to
55:19 - some of the sections that we covered so
55:21 - that we can be sure to make this useful
55:24 - for people after the fact so you want to
55:26 - come back and you're like what was that
55:27 - thing they said you can come back and
55:29 - look through and see the resources and
55:32 - jump to a section of the video so thank
55:35 - you all so much I wanna you we're so
55:37 - psyched for this school year we have big
55:39 - plans and we love hearing all of your
55:41 - feedback so please please please keep us
55:44 - updated on that yeah and we love seeing
55:46 - all of your happy smiling faces and your
55:48 - students faces um this school year it's
55:51 - one of the things that keeps us
55:52 - motivated so we actually have a channel
55:54 - like in our team slack where we can see
55:57 - like what's happening on Twitter and who
55:58 - knows so if you want to share with us
56:00 - what's going on in your classroom if you
56:02 - have permission to do that please do
56:04 - that we love love love seeing what's
56:06 - going on so um thank you all so much for
56:09 - watching thank say Hanna but you know
56:11 - someone I come yeah thank you to those
56:13 - of you that have been commenting and
56:14 - giving tips and tricks tricks to other
56:16 - teachers that's so great and really
56:19 - brings together equitable community so
56:21 - thank you that you guys's we'll talk to
56:23 - you soon yep please reach out to us
56:25 - we're happy to talk alright everybody
56:27 - thanks again talk to you soon have a
