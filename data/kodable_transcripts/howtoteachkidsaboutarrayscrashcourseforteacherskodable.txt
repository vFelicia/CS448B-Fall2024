00:01 - whoo-hoo let's go hi I'm Doreen I'm the
00:05 - director of curriculum at codable the
00:07 - short video is going to introduce you to
00:09 - the concept you'll be teaching in this
00:10 - unit thanks for watching
00:13 - [Music]
00:19 - variable story information or values in
00:22 - a program there are different types of
00:24 - variables that are used in different
00:26 - situations there's strings integers and
00:29 - arrays we've learned now that strings
00:31 - are variables that hold values that are
00:33 - groups of characters like a word or a
00:35 - phrase while integers store values that
00:38 - are numbers like 550 or 500 an array is
00:43 - an ordered list of related variables
00:45 - that includes both strings and integers
00:48 - arrays group related variables together
00:50 - and keep code organized which makes
00:52 - storing values more efficient in real
00:56 - life you can think of your closet as an
00:58 - array you use your closet to organize
01:01 - your clothes and keep them in a specific
01:02 - order
01:03 - the order you hang your clothes in
01:05 - organizes them in a defined way your
01:08 - shirts are going to stay where are you
01:10 - hitting them let's say on Sunday night
01:12 - you're planning your outfits for Monday
01:14 - Tuesday and Wednesday when you hang your
01:17 - green dress shirt on the far left spot
01:19 - in your closet from Monday your blue
01:21 - shirt in the middle of the closet for
01:22 - Tuesday and your favorite red shirt on
01:25 - the right in your closet for Wednesday
01:27 - they will be where you hung them and
01:29 - organized in this way when you need them
01:31 - throughout the week in programming we
01:34 - can store a related data in an array
01:36 - grouping the related values together in
01:39 - a list in the final part of each arrays
01:42 - lesson students will independently
01:45 - practice using an array to clear the
01:47 - asteroid field in this Troy dia arrays
01:50 - work just like they do in real
01:51 - programming they're used to keep code
01:53 - clean and more efficient so students
01:56 - will be able to use an array to get
01:58 - three moves with just one command this
02:01 - will allow students to solve some of the
02:03 - lessons using just one move in this
02:06 - lesson the colors represent string
02:09 - variables there are six different values
02:12 - used here red pink yellow green blue and
02:16 - purple I need to correctly order my list
02:19 - of variables to be able to clear the
02:21 - asteroid field when I match the values I
02:24 - see that I need to first clear red pink
02:27 - than yellow and so on
02:29 - I ordered the values in myarray this way
02:32 - so that I can successfully clear the
02:34 - asteroid field by matching the values
02:36 - from my commandment with the values in
02:38 - the field let's think a little bit more
02:40 - about how arrays are actually used in
02:42 - programming think about codable for
02:44 - example we have hundreds of thousands of
02:47 - students that use codable to learn
02:48 - programming when you have your students
02:51 - use a class code to login their names
02:54 - are actually stored in our program as an
02:57 - array so anytime your students entered
02:59 - their class code it brings up a list of
03:02 - names and allows them to select their
03:04 - name from their class list and login to
03:06 - their profile all of these names are
03:09 - strings like we've talked about and
03:11 - they're stored in our database as an
03:13 - array which keeps code organized and
03:15 - more efficient and allows your students
03:18 - to log in and find their names to get to
03:21 - their profiles faster programmers can
03:24 - use just one command to search all of
03:26 - the values stored in an array without
03:28 - needing to know what each variable may
03:30 - be so now we know arrays makes storing
03:33 - and finding values more efficient
