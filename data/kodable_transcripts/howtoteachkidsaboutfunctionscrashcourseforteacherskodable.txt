00:01 - whoo-hoo let's go hi I'm green on the
00:05 - director of curriculum at codable the
00:07 - short video is going to introduce you to
00:09 - the concept you'll be teaching in this
00:10 - unit thanks for watching
00:17 - in programming we often use the same
00:20 - code more than once we can repeat
00:23 - actions or we can add on two pieces of
00:26 - code to complete more complex tasks
00:28 - functions allow us to teach the computer
00:31 - had to do something one time and easily
00:33 - reuse the code to do it again later
00:35 - a function is a sequence of commands
00:37 - that can be reused together later in a
00:39 - program functions name a sequence of
00:42 - commands and dictate what code is
00:44 - executed functions allow for separation
00:47 - of codes making it easy for us to reuse
00:49 - it again later programmers often say
00:53 - don't repeat yourself you can think of
00:56 - this as an acronym to help you remember
00:57 - the purpose of functions keep your code
01:00 - dry as people we're always learning and
01:05 - building on what we already know and can
01:07 - do we add to a foundation in order to be
01:09 - able to complete more complex processes
01:11 - in life this is a lot like a function we
01:14 - piece together basic actions in order to
01:17 - carry out more complex tasks a great
01:21 - example of this in the classroom is
01:23 - crisscross applesauce we pieced together
01:26 - separate actions and named it as one
01:28 - something that students will remember
01:30 - students learn at once and likely we use
01:33 - it throughout the year once students
01:36 - learn crisscross applesauce we don't
01:38 - have to instruct them step by step every
01:40 - time we say it students know what to do
01:43 - when they hear this is the power and
01:45 - beauty of a function functions allow us
01:48 - to repeat a sequence of code without
01:50 - actually having to write the code over
01:51 - again this allows us to simplify a
01:54 - complex action into only one command
01:56 - just like our crisscross applesauce
01:58 - example during the final part of each
02:02 - functions lesson students will
02:04 - independently practice identifying
02:06 - patterns of commands that are used more
02:09 - than once in each of the mazes in this
02:11 - example students will see that more than
02:14 - one time the same pattern is used up
02:17 - right up knowing this sequence of
02:21 - commands will be used together more than
02:24 - once we can create a function for it by
02:26 - using the orange function button and
02:28 - putting the three commands into one our
02:32 - code to complete the maze is shortened
02:34 - and we avoid repeating ourselves by
02:36 - using the function twice to complete the
02:38 - maze
02:38 - we command our fuzz to go right we use
02:42 - our function which is up right up we go
02:45 - right use our function again and right
02:49 - instead of having to use nine commands
02:52 - we only use five and we earn three stars
02:56 - just like this we can teach a computer
02:59 - to carry out a sequence of steps for one
03:01 - action we name it so we can use it later
03:04 - when we want the computer to do it again
03:06 - for example if we want to write a
03:08 - program that brings up a window that
03:10 - tells a user hello we could write a
03:12 - function for it since there are two
03:15 - commands that the computer will need to
03:16 - follow in order to be able to carry out
03:18 - this task a function will prevent us
03:21 - from having to write the instructions
03:22 - step by step each time we want the
03:24 - computer to perform this action first we
03:28 - name our function print and alert
03:30 - because that is what we want the
03:31 - computer to do and will need to use the
03:33 - name of our function when we want the
03:35 - computer to do it again leader then
03:37 - within two curly braces we write in
03:39 - JavaScript what the computer does a
03:42 - computer writes the word hello to the
03:45 - website instead of having to write the
03:47 - code each time we want the computer to
03:49 - perform this task we simply call the
03:51 - function print and alert and the
03:53 - computer automatically brings up a
03:55 - window that says hello with a function
03:57 - our code is shortened from this to this
04:03 - functions allow us to teach the computer
04:06 - how to do something one time and then
04:08 - easily reuse the code later
04:10 - remember don't repeat yourself
