00:07 - the fuzzes are round furry aliens who
00:10 - love adventure and learning new things
00:13 - when they are not
00:14 - exploring the universe where do you
00:16 - think the fuzzes live
00:18 - just like you live on a planet called
00:20 - earth
00:21 - the fuzzes also have a home planet
00:24 - called
00:24 - fuzztopia let's go there together
00:28 - the very first time you visit fuzztopia
00:31 - will look like this
00:33 - empty you have some exploring to do
00:36 - this treehouse is called mission control
00:40 - and is where your mission to learn
00:41 - coding begins
00:43 - to start your adventure drag the
00:45 - triangle key
00:46 - into place you unlocked mission control
00:51 - from this treehouse you and the fuzz
00:54 - family can blast off to
00:56 - any other world in the codable universe
00:58 - they're all
00:59 - shown here on your mission control
01:01 - screen
01:02 - each world has its own game in smeeborg
01:06 - you write programs that tell a fuzz how
01:08 - to roll through the techno mazes and
01:10 - collect stars
01:13 - in asteroidia you match fuzzball
01:15 - variables with same value asteroids to
01:18 - clear the asteroid field
01:21 - in bug world you create and modify
01:23 - heroes that will defend your spaceship
01:25 - from the slimes
01:28 - at beach cleanup you can use code for
01:30 - good and collect
01:31 - trash to rescue the sea creatures but
01:34 - most of the time when you get to mission
01:36 - control you can just click the quick
01:38 - play button this will send you to
01:41 - whatever level you were on when you
01:43 - stopped playing before
01:45 - remember your teacher gets to pick which
01:47 - game levels and worlds you can explore
01:50 - and might tell you what world to go to
01:52 - at certain times
01:55 - as you play levels your code rank goes
01:58 - up
01:58 - this means you're learning how to code
02:00 - and can earn rewards in the game
02:03 - like new activities more fuzzes
02:06 - and cool badges when your code rank is
02:09 - high enough
02:10 - other buildings on fuzztopia will unlock
02:14 - these have fun projects inside
02:17 - first fuzz builder where you can code
02:19 - your own member of the fuzz family
02:21 - costumes and all then
02:24 - game designer where you design an
02:26 - asteroid blaster game with
02:28 - properties based on what you want
02:30 - there's also maze maker
02:32 - where you can create and decorate your
02:34 - own techno maze level
02:38 - if you get confused at some point in the
02:40 - game that's okay
02:42 - computer scientists are always learning
02:44 - and solving problems
02:46 - your teacher may also assign you videos
02:49 - to help just click this videos button
02:51 - to see the videos your teacher assigned
02:53 - to help you get
02:54 - unstuck one last thing
02:58 - this is the fustopia store when you earn
03:00 - coins playing codeable
03:02 - you can spend them on new costumes for
03:04 - fuzzes and decorations for fustopia
03:07 - to shop in the store ask your parents to
03:09 - play codable at home
03:12 - that's it for this tour of fuzztopia the
03:14 - fuzz family
03:15 - can't wait to see you here again soon
03:18 - happy coding
