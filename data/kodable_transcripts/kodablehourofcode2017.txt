00:04 - all right hello everybody um my name is
00:09 - Gretchen Heavener and I am one of the
00:13 - founders of codable I am so excited for
00:16 - the hour of code this year we love CSN
00:19 - week here at codable obviously we gear
00:21 - up for it all year and I'm so excited to
00:25 - talk to you all about some of the things
00:28 - that we have new for this year I know
00:29 - some of you this is your first time
00:31 - using codable for some of you this is
00:33 - just another year you've been doing it
00:36 - you're seasoned pros at this point but
00:38 - there are some new things that are just
00:41 - for this brand new 2017 so we'll go over
00:44 - all of that but for everybody who's new
00:47 - we're gonna cover creating classes go
00:51 - over some of our hour of codes lesson
00:52 - plans that we have we've spent some time
00:55 - making some really awesome integrated
00:57 - lessons um covering you know science
01:00 - math ela and then some more self-guided
01:03 - options for people who are just kind of
01:06 - diving into it you want to have their
01:07 - kids on a game we have that option as
01:10 - well so we're gonna go over all of that
01:11 - we're gonna go over assigning game
01:16 - practice for kids so if you're getting
01:18 - them set up on devices and how to make
01:20 - sure that they have access to all the
01:21 - right levels we'll go over that real
01:23 - quickly
01:24 - um and then we're gonna cover some of
01:26 - the things that are brand new for this
01:27 - year so we have some awesome new
01:29 - creative content kids can make their own
01:32 - fuzzies they came to create their own
01:34 - mazes you can share that within your
01:37 - class if that's something you want to UM
01:39 - the option to do so we're gonna go over
01:42 - some of those things then open it up for
01:46 - questions so if you do have questions
01:48 - along the way feel free to put them in
01:51 - the chat that's up on the right
01:55 - John Mattingly my co-founder is gonna be
01:57 - answering questions as we go through
01:58 - here so he should be on it um but if you
02:03 - if you want to ask questions as we go
02:05 - that's great we're gonna leave time for
02:07 - questions at the end I know a lot of you
02:09 - submitted questions in the forum you are
02:12 - sweetpea so we have I have a list of
02:15 - those that I'm going to be sure to
02:16 - answer at the end so anyway let's get to
02:20 - it I am so excited um and we're just
02:23 - gonna start by going over what is
02:25 - quotable so a lot of you are brand new
02:27 - to the world of codable and I'm just
02:31 - gonna quickly describe what it is for
02:35 - you so codable is a k5 computer science
02:39 - curriculum for for students and teachers
02:42 - we create lessons for teachers who don't
02:47 - have any experience with computer
02:48 - science to help their students learn the
02:52 - fundamentals starting in kindergarten
02:53 - and then working all the way up to
02:55 - learning JavaScript in fifth grade as
02:59 - far as what students have access you
03:01 - there experiencing computer science you
03:04 - know starting like we learn to read you
03:07 - know you start learning your ABCs you
03:09 - start writing sentences we take that
03:11 - approaches with computer science we
03:13 - start by learning the very earliest
03:15 - building blocks and then build on that
03:17 - and scaffold it to more complicated
03:19 - things when they get a little bit older
03:21 - so they have they're learning all of
03:25 - this through lessons but then also in a
03:28 - fun and engaging game so in our game
03:30 - there are these cute adorable fuzzies
03:34 - and they're aliens who are exploring
03:37 - outer space and they need your students
03:40 - help to navigate all of the exciting
03:43 - challenges that are presented to them
03:45 - starting with mazes however they have to
03:47 - find their way through these mazes using
03:50 - coding concepts and coding commands and
03:54 - then going into learning about variables
03:56 - where they have to navigate and and
03:59 - destroy asteroids that are in there in
04:01 - their way and then going into you know
04:04 - some more tower defense games where they
04:07 - get to program towers using classes and
04:10 - properties in JavaScript so we'll just
04:15 - jump right into it first I'm gonna start
04:17 - out as if I had a new account and I was
04:21 - creating my first class then we'll get
04:23 - into how
04:23 - get your students signed on and kind of
04:26 - go into lesson plans from there so here
04:29 - we go
04:30 - I'm just going to share my screen look
04:33 - like okay so um if you are starting with
04:51 - codable brand-new and you don't have a
04:55 - class yet or if you are just creating an
04:58 - account for the first time this is the
05:00 - best way to have students logged in so
05:04 - that you can save their progress if
05:06 - you're planning on going you know and
05:08 - using codable beyond just the hour of
05:10 - code we do have options for you to use
05:13 - codable for just this week so that you
05:16 - don't have to actually create an account
05:19 - or if you want to use codable without
05:22 - having to like you know set up class or
05:24 - anything like that I'm gonna go over
05:25 - that stuff a little bit later but for
05:27 - now we're gonna go through like creating
05:29 - the class it's super simple to do um and
05:33 - I'm going to show you how to do that
05:34 - real quick so from your dashboard you
05:37 - would you know sign up at koat.com like
05:40 - add a class and just create a class name
05:42 - and it can be anything um I'm gonna call
05:45 - mine 2017 and for this I'm gonna assign
05:57 - it a k2 five pacing so this is gonna
06:02 - make everything accessible to me as if I
06:04 - was working with all grade levels you
06:07 - can choose your grade and this is gonna
06:08 - make lessons available to them based on
06:10 - their grade level so for kindergarteners
06:13 - we focus on you know sequencing and
06:16 - conditions and then you know fifth grade
06:18 - would be reviewing a lot of those basic
06:21 - concepts and then moving into JavaScript
06:23 - so it's going to change what's available
06:24 - to them based on like where they should
06:26 - be for that grade level pacing for this
06:30 - example I'm just going to choose K to
06:31 - five and continue and then you
06:36 - and your students one by one typing them
06:39 - in here or you can copy and paste from
06:41 - your spreadsheet it's super simple if
06:44 - you would just have a look like a list
06:45 - in a Word document however whatever
06:47 - format you want to put it it's gonna be
06:49 - per line so I'm gonna make my team and
07:10 - this is the class code so this is what
07:13 - your students are going to enter on
07:15 - their devices to get logged in later
07:18 - it's sort of like a password for your
07:19 - class you want it to be unique but you
07:22 - also want to be memorable so if you're
07:25 - working with like kindergarten students
07:26 - for example you can make it one of their
07:29 - vocab words plus your room name or your
07:32 - room number or your last name something
07:35 - that's gonna be unique to your students
07:37 - and it's going to be easy for them to
07:38 - enter later we give a couple of
07:40 - suggestions here for me I'm going to
07:43 - choose Gretchen for 2017 actually I'm
07:48 - going to make it something different
07:49 - we're gonna say webinar 2017 it says
07:56 - that this is available great
08:08 - all right it's that simple my class is
08:10 - created um I can go to my class and see
08:14 - what lessons are available to them so
08:17 - since I chose the k5 pacing you can see
08:20 - I have all of these lessons available
08:22 - for my students we're just focusing on
08:25 - the hour of code as if this is our first
08:27 - check off with with coding so we're not
08:30 - gonna worry about too much of that right
08:32 - now if you do have questions about
08:34 - pacing and how to roll out coding beyond
08:38 - the hour of code I encourage you to
08:40 - check out our back-to-school webinar
08:41 - that we had um in August
08:44 - that's archived on our YouTube channel
08:46 - you can also reach out to us anytime at
08:48 - support at codable comm we are always
08:51 - you know happy to answer questions
08:53 - without implementing CS you know how to
08:56 - choose the correct pacing for your
08:57 - students and whatnot um so for this I'm
09:02 - going to choose to assign game content
09:06 - based on what I'm going to be teaching
09:08 - the week of the hour of code so first to
09:13 - make sure that we're all on the same
09:14 - page I'm going to make sure that we go
09:16 - over some of our lessons you can see
09:19 - like what are some of the game options
09:21 - that we have so the IRF code so I'm
09:25 - going to go to lesson library and this
09:29 - this is where you can find all of the
09:32 - lessons that we have available in
09:34 - codable not just what's available to
09:36 - your class based on their grade so say
09:39 - you were working with kindergarteners
09:40 - but you wanted to have some
09:41 - supplementary lessons in there you could
09:43 - come to our lesson library and pick out
09:45 - some lessons and then save those to your
09:47 - class and they'll be available on your
09:49 - class page so I'm going to view our hour
09:51 - of code lessons and to start I'm going
09:55 - to take a look at our our pre reader
09:58 - pizza party
09:59 - um so this is like my first algorithm
10:02 - this is a this is a lesson kind of going
10:04 - over some math concepts
10:06 - it is common core math aligned a CSTA
10:10 - aligned and it is aligned to our
10:12 - computer science standards it's a three
10:15 - day project
10:17 - it's inquiry-based it's gonna be
10:19 - focusing on some math vocab some very
10:22 - basic computer science vocab and getting
10:26 - kids really thinking about algorithms
10:27 - and putting things into a correct
10:29 - sequence and it has some some fun videos
10:33 - and things for you to check out with
10:35 - your kids and this was created in
10:39 - collaboration with with front row and
10:43 - you'd find all of the materials here you
10:45 - can see download resources you can see
10:48 - all of the vocabulary you can see the
10:50 - agenda for each day so you know what
10:52 - what you should be saying to them to
10:54 - kind of introduce the project um but
10:57 - let's go to a more basic um lesson let's
11:01 - take a look at our hour of code beginner
11:06 - for kindergarten so this is what we
11:10 - would be introducing this is actually
11:12 - one of the very first hour of code
11:13 - lessons that we ever created and it's a
11:16 - great place to get started if you're
11:18 - just a beginner if your students are a
11:20 - beginner or beginners it kind of
11:22 - outlines like you know what is a
11:25 - programmer what is programming language
11:27 - and how can we write some code to make a
11:30 - robot and robot being a volunteer from
11:34 - your class to make a robot move and you
11:38 - come up with a language together you
11:40 - write the language on the board you you
11:43 - put the correct the commands in the
11:46 - correct sequence and you kind of go from
11:48 - there and it's really fun and
11:50 - collaborative and kinesthetic
11:51 - everybody's engaged and excited and
11:54 - laughing inevitably the robot is gonna
11:57 - make a mistake or you as programmers
12:00 - they're going to make a mistake and it's
12:02 - just really fun to kind of see exactly
12:04 - how specific you need to be when you're
12:06 - coding and you can see just like all of
12:09 - our other lessons this is all scripted
12:11 - you can go off the script or you can
12:14 - kind of in you know come up with what
12:19 - you want to say on your own improvise
12:21 - and that's our that's the activity that
12:24 - you do together um and then you would go
12:27 - into independent practice
12:29 - now any lesson where there are game
12:32 - levels available for that lesson it's
12:36 - going to say in the independent practice
12:37 - section students will complete Smee
12:40 - board sequence sector levels one point
12:42 - one to one point five and one two three
12:44 - roll so these are the game levels that
12:47 - go along with this lesson so after
12:48 - you've done that fun activity together
12:52 - you can actually have them go onto their
12:54 - devices and and practice sequencing in
12:59 - codable I'm so really reinforcing
13:02 - everything that you just learned
13:03 - together as part of the lesson you know
13:05 - you went over the vocabulary you learned
13:07 - about programming you learned about what
13:09 - is sequence why do we put code in the
13:11 - correct order and then they can practice
13:14 - it in the game with the first family
13:17 - like we talked about so I'm gonna go
13:19 - ahead and show you um I'm gonna save
13:22 - this lesson to my class that we just
13:24 - created so there we go okay to five
13:41 - codable our code 2017 there it is okay
13:45 - and now I need to assign this game
13:50 - content to my students so it was me pork
13:55 - and it's this one two three roll just
13:58 - like it said on the on the lesson so I'm
14:01 - gonna go ahead and assign one two three
14:03 - roll and I'm gonna choose my class
14:10 - couple our cook 2017 assign and there we
14:17 - have it
14:17 - it is assigned to my class now you say
14:21 - okay I've got everything set up I've got
14:23 - my lesson plan um you go to my class and
14:26 - do my lesson plan real quick you can see
14:34 - I have a lot of classes here's my lesson
14:37 - plan I'm gonna do the hour of code
14:39 - beginner lesson for kindergarten
14:41 - I'm gonna go ahead and download this
14:42 - lesson plan print it out for myself so
14:45 - I'm all prepared for the day of and then
14:48 - when I'm ready when I'm ready to have
14:50 - kids sign in I'm gonna use this class
14:52 - code so the class code that I created
14:54 - that was webinar it was supposed to be
14:56 - 2017 but it says looks like it's 2:17
14:59 - that's ok um I'm gonna have students log
15:03 - in with that class code if I wanted to
15:06 - edit this I could I'm not gonna get into
15:08 - the details of how to do that right now
15:10 - but you can edit your class code later
15:12 - if you need to so you have a typo just
15:14 - like me um so I'm gonna go ahead and
15:17 - show you how you get students logged in
15:20 - so you can click this link actually and
15:23 - that's a direct link to your class so I
15:25 - can see my roster right here you can
15:28 - copy and paste this URL if you want to
15:32 - have kids logging in directly to their
15:34 - roster if you're coming from our hour of
15:37 - code page which a lot of you will be
15:39 - doing um it's game codable comm / our
15:43 - code
15:43 - you're gonna see this website and you
15:48 - want to have your kids click play with
15:49 - class or student code and we're gonna
15:53 - enter your class code and it is webinar
15:57 - 217 and there you have it it's that
16:03 - simple my rosters right here I'm gonna
16:06 - go ahead and sign in MOU I have some new
16:17 - fuzz's um and all your students are
16:21 - going to need to do is click play and
16:23 - that will automatically take them to the
16:25 - first level that has been assigned to
16:28 - your students so we assigned a lesson
16:32 - one two three role and this is the first
16:35 - lesson in that assignment and for those
16:38 - of you who aren't familiar with codable
16:40 - this is the very beginning of the world
16:44 - where they are introduced to the fuzz is
16:46 - that these guys they're gonna collect
16:48 - lots of these characters and what
16:51 - they're gonna start by doing is just
16:53 - putting see the
16:55 - man's in the correct sequence and it
17:02 - starts off really simply like this one
17:04 - now we have forward down forward um and
17:10 - it's really good to go over you know the
17:12 - sequence with your students but it's
17:14 - going to scaffold up from this and
17:16 - become much more complicated they're
17:18 - gonna start having to think critically
17:19 - kind of work together collaborate talk
17:22 - about what their what their solution is
17:24 - how you can have multiple solutions to
17:26 - many mazes and it gets really fun and
17:28 - engaging and then codable will
17:39 - automatically take them to the next
17:41 - lesson
17:41 - um so I'm gonna go ahead and pause go
17:46 - back to our menu here um and while I'm
17:50 - in potable I can go ahead and show you
17:53 - all some of the things that are new in
17:55 - codable for this year so that's just one
17:58 - lesson that I showed you all the the
18:00 - robot where we're introducing
18:02 - programming to them but we do have a lot
18:05 - of other options available on our hour
18:07 - of code page I'll go ahead and show you
18:09 - some of those real quick and just so you
18:11 - know what I'm talking about
18:13 - this is codable comm rush hour of code
18:17 - you can see here we've got a women in
18:19 - tech past present and future this is a
18:21 - three day project asking students to
18:24 - kind of examine generate and equal
18:27 - dinner gender sorry gender inequality
18:30 - and technology in you know thinking
18:33 - about the problem this problem from a
18:36 - variety of perspectives and is ela comic
18:41 - or ela CSTA and elementary computer
18:46 - science standards aligned so you're
18:48 - gonna be checking a lot of boxes with
18:49 - these types of of lessons we have some
18:53 - beginner coding lessons we have some
18:56 - advanced coding lessons all available by
18:59 - grade we have some ela so choose your
19:03 - own adventure you know kids are going to
19:05 - end up
19:05 - choose-your-own-adventure lesson while
19:09 - exploring the idea of sequence and why
19:11 - it's important to put things in order as
19:13 - well as condition so if I do this then
19:16 - this will happen if I make this choice
19:18 - and something else will happen
19:20 - it's super fun very fun project we have
19:23 - some introduction to coding with reading
19:27 - activities so some of them are reading
19:29 - some of them are some short writing
19:31 - assignments we have my first algorithm
19:35 - math pizza party that I showed you
19:37 - earlier
19:38 - we have a fourth and fifth grade and
19:40 - half the pizza party project that you
19:45 - can do it was made in collaboration with
19:46 - front row and then what I'm most excited
19:51 - about this year is actually our I don't
19:54 - know if you all may not know this but
19:55 - I'm actually the designer of codable I
19:58 - design all of the fuzzies I design all
20:00 - of the levels basically anything you
20:02 - have seen and codable I most likely
20:05 - designed it so naturally I'm most
20:08 - excited about our introduction to game
20:10 - design and maze maker challenge this
20:13 - year
20:14 - we have put together a self-guided
20:19 - lesson for your students that is common
20:21 - core math aligned kids are gonna be
20:23 - doing they're going to be practicing
20:27 - some geometry grade level geometry
20:30 - concepts while trying to design mazes
20:34 - for the four other kids in the class so
20:36 - we'll view this lesson okay and all you
20:46 - need to do is set kids up in codable
20:49 - just like we did you know I created a
20:51 - class and I logged them in and if you
20:57 - take them to the maze maker which I'll
20:58 - show you exactly how to get there you
21:00 - can find the instructions on how to
21:02 - access Mia's maker in this lesson
21:04 - they're going to be practicing each of
21:06 - these Common Core math concepts and it
21:09 - basically is set up to take them as far
21:11 - as they can go so you can challenge them
21:13 - say complete as many of these challenges
21:16 - as you can
21:16 - and you know it's kind of fun and
21:18 - competitive and you can see you know you
21:21 - can actually see them learning you know
21:24 - how to divide a square into four equal
21:27 - parts or to show the line of symmetry in
21:31 - a maze that they design so it's pretty
21:34 - fun and this is all accessible in
21:36 - quotable so I'll go ahead and show you
21:38 - that real quick and so we're back in the
21:40 - game
21:41 - logged in as a student we're gonna go
21:44 - ahead and go to my maze oh sorry my my
21:47 - ship um and you can see there's a
21:49 - mission alert and it says hour of code
21:51 - so I'm gonna go to that and this is our
21:55 - very first an hour of code maze maker
21:58 - challenge so I'm gonna draw a square now
22:02 - students may want to you want to may
22:04 - wanna have them familiarized with how
22:06 - codable works before this so they might
22:10 - need to know about the mazes a little
22:12 - bit to know um how to create their first
22:15 - names but um they can basically design
22:18 - their own maze now so I'm gonna choose a
22:21 - background and I'm gonna start drawing a
22:26 - square there it is
22:40 - and I would encourage your students to
22:43 - get creative with this like if they want
22:46 - to make a square and turn it into smiley
22:50 - face that's totally acceptable if they
22:54 - want to you know make a square in a
22:58 - different way I don't know encourage
23:00 - them to be creative it's all about
23:02 - creativity when it comes to design so
23:04 - you have you know your overall objective
23:07 - but you also have the freedom to kind of
23:09 - have creative expression so I'm going to
23:13 - place my stars and then I need to test
23:16 - my level and make sure that it's
23:17 - solvable so now I'm going to enter the
23:20 - solution
23:28 - [Music]
23:33 - yay awesome
23:35 - I created mace and I have my first
23:40 - trophy for my hour of code names maker
23:42 - design challenge um and then I have
23:45 - opened up the second challenge we have
23:48 - six maze maker challenges they get
23:50 - pretty complicated you'll see in the and
23:52 - the lesson but I would encourage your
23:55 - students to just go for it give it a try
23:56 - um
23:58 - once a maze is created you can actually
24:02 - share it within the class so um you can
24:06 - go to your muses and you can see your
24:08 - class and now i can see mo has shared
24:13 - it's automatically shared i have shared
24:16 - my level or my my maze with the rest of
24:19 - my class if other kids in my class were
24:22 - to create mazes they would all show up
24:23 - here too
24:24 - um and you can play them like so if I
24:27 - was not know and I was you know playing
24:30 - as John I could play most level um and
24:33 - then I can favorite it and I can give it
24:36 - show it some love you can even you know
24:39 - use it as inspiration and modify it and
24:42 - then save it again for other kids to
24:44 - play so it gets pretty exciting and
24:46 - collaborative um one other thing that I
24:55 - want to show you guys that's new for the
24:56 - hour of code this year um is our main
25:00 - art builder and fuzz so you may you know
25:04 - you are familiar with our sizes we have
25:07 - all these different characters we have
25:10 - some special edition fuzzes that you may
25:13 - have earned um last year if you were
25:16 - using codable Ada Lovelace and Alan
25:19 - Turing are some famous historic computer
25:24 - scientists that we were inspired by them
25:27 - and made them a part of our close family
25:29 - so um as students go through they're
25:31 - gonna unlock more characters but they're
25:33 - also oh if there
25:36 - further along and codable are going to
25:38 - be able to build their own buzzes so
25:41 - I'll go ahead and log into one of my
25:43 - other accounts so you can see what that
25:45 - looks like okay so I'm going to log in
26:05 - it's my famous class and cut and show
26:16 - you so if you're in your ship
26:18 - I can build buzzes I'm gonna name my
26:22 - buzz and I can get for a body I'm gonna
26:36 - get some eyes and a mouth modify these
26:41 - properties want her to be read I want
26:44 - her to have brown eyes and I want her to
26:50 - have a inquisitive look um and then I
26:57 - wouldn't give her a bow actually I'm
27:00 - gonna change this up how about a flower
27:03 - crown that's sweet and some glasses
27:11 - she's gonna have pink glasses and this
27:15 - is my buzz and you can encourage
27:17 - students to so this is all JavaScript
27:19 - right here and we've got some methods
27:21 - some some functions we've got a class of
27:25 - fuzz class we've got some different
27:27 - properties that were modifying so these
27:29 - are all things that we cover in our more
27:31 - advanced lessons um that's why we eight
27:35 - require students to complete more
27:37 - codable to unlock this feature but if
27:39 - you do want to get into some more
27:41 - advanced coding with your kids this is
27:43 - something that's really fun allows them
27:45 - to be creative kind of engage with
27:47 - codable create their own character
27:49 - and then they can play with this
27:51 - character that they've created and
27:52 - continue to modify it I'm gonna save my
27:55 - files
27:57 - and there she is
28:00 - and now I can play with Gretchen sighs
28:06 - so those are some of the things that are
28:09 - brand-new for the hour of code this year
28:11 - one other thing that I want to remind
28:14 - everyone of is that there is not going
28:17 - to be a save progress option if you are
28:22 - playing without a class code so we do
28:25 - have the option from our hour of code
28:27 - page go back to this all of our hour of
28:39 - code content can be used and played with
28:42 - without creating an account so if you
28:45 - are having your students log in they
28:49 - actually don't need they can play
28:52 - without saving and they do not need to
28:54 - have an account you don't have to create
28:55 - a class to get them started if you're
28:57 - just doing it for this week go for it um
28:59 - you know that's awesome that's great we
29:03 - want you to have the option to do that
29:05 - oh but if you do want to save their
29:08 - progress come back to this not have to
29:11 - have them do the same thing over again
29:12 - if it's something that you're
29:14 - considering going beyond our code with I
29:16 - do encourage you to log in create an
29:20 - account and set up a class because
29:22 - that's going to be the way for you to
29:23 - save their progress beyond just this
29:26 - week um and you'll also be able to
29:30 - access all of these lessons from your
29:32 - class - or from your dashboard like I
29:35 - showed you in the lesson library you can
29:37 - save any of these lessons to your class
29:39 - all of this will be accessible from from
29:43 - an account yeah so really that's the
29:46 - only difference this year we we did have
29:48 - a save and exit option last year but
29:51 - with so many kids we are so thankful
29:53 - there are so so many kids using codable
29:56 - said unfortunately we're not able to
29:58 - save programs for everyone
30:00 - it would just break everything so oh
30:03 - we've just decided to make it the option
30:06 - to play quotable if you want to start
30:09 - again after you come back in January
30:11 - you're more than welcome to do that I'm
30:13 - decorating a class and going from there
30:15 - so one other thing I want to be sure to
30:18 - bring everyone's attention to its
30:20 - certificates for your students so it's
30:22 - really exciting the hour of code is
30:24 - really a magical week kids get so
30:27 - engaged parents get engaged um you know
30:31 - people in you know in the school
30:33 - community can engage the you know might
30:35 - not normally hear from and so it's
30:37 - really nice to have an option to send
30:40 - something home with kids you know
30:42 - showing that they've accomplished
30:43 - something really cool they completed the
30:46 - hour of code we have a certificate of
30:48 - certificate of completion you can enter
30:50 - your email address here and we'll send
30:52 - it to you
30:52 - you can add students names to it and
30:56 - present it to them at the end of the
30:57 - week so yeah and then the last thing is
31:01 - please be sure to share your experience
31:04 - with us we love honestly this is our
31:07 - most favorite week of the year we
31:10 - basically put everything else down and
31:12 - just focus on taking care of support
31:16 - questions talking to people going to
31:18 - schools doing hangouts with classes
31:21 - talking about what's happening this week
31:23 - we're gonna be going to the big you know
31:26 - kickoff event with code.org this year so
31:28 - we're really excited and a big part of
31:31 - that experience for us is here and you
31:33 - know what you guys are doing what you're
31:35 - experiencing what your students are
31:36 - experiencing so please be sure to share
31:39 - with us what's happening use hashtag
31:42 - kids can code or at codable and we'll
31:45 - see it and we'll be sure to respond to
31:48 - as many of you as we can um and and
31:50 - share your experience with others too so
31:53 - thank you so much oh and if you do have
31:55 - questions as you're kind of setting up
31:57 - your account we have a Help Center and
31:59 - you can find that here it's just support
32:02 - quotable calm um
32:06 - then one last thing I want to be sure to
32:09 - get to before we get into questions
32:12 - is at pricing some of you could ask
32:15 - questions about pricing it's not really
32:17 - what we had intended for this webinar to
32:20 - be about but I didn't want to be sure to
32:22 - address some of the questions that you
32:24 - guys had so um there is actually a
32:28 - brand-new option we just created it kind
32:31 - of with the key hour of code in mind we
32:33 - have a game only access plan for just
32:36 - 600 dollars this gives you access to all
32:38 - of codable um all of the game content it
32:41 - does not give you access to the lesson
32:43 - plans and you are paid lesson plans but
32:46 - it is going to give you access for your
32:48 - entire school for unlimited students for
32:50 - the year so this is our most affordable
32:53 - option it's for many people less than a
32:56 - dollar a student so um we do get a lot
33:00 - of great support from principals and
33:03 - from other administrators so if this is
33:05 - something that you're interested in and
33:07 - you have questions about feel free to
33:08 - reach out to us at support at code
33:11 - Volcom or you can check it out on your
33:14 - teacher dashboard on your account page
33:17 - we have some other options available if
33:20 - you're looking to purchase the
33:21 - curriculum but again that's not really
33:23 - the point of this webinar and if you do
33:25 - have questions you can feel free to
33:26 - email us and we will set up a
33:28 - conversation um all right let's get to
33:34 - questions I kind of zoomed through
33:36 - everything um
33:37 - so I'm sure that there are questions
33:40 - let's see first up here I have is there
33:44 - an app my kids can start can just scan
33:47 - to get in a look like a QR code I guess
33:50 - it's hard for first graders to enter a
33:52 - series of letters and to even get to the
33:57 - site yeah you can use our QR code
34:01 - scanner on iPads so if you're gonna be
34:04 - using the web version like I showed you
34:06 - you have that unique URL that's gonna
34:08 - take you directly to the class roster
34:10 - but if you're using iPads we have the
34:13 - option to use a QR code so I'm back on
34:16 - class dashboard and you can actually see
34:19 - show class QR code if you put put put
34:22 - this up on your smart board or if you
34:27 - want to print it off you can do that
34:28 - I'm share it with the class they can
34:30 - scan this on their iPad and it will open
34:34 - it will save the class to your iPad also
34:42 - once a class is saved on an iPad you
34:45 - don't ever have to enter it again it
34:47 - saves it forever until you delete it um
34:51 - what is the most important thing we need
34:53 - to be teaching our younger students
34:54 - thinking pre-k kinder
34:56 - I would say stick with the basics I mean
34:59 - they're learning about their letters the
35:02 - similar idea in computer science you
35:05 - don't want to get too complicated so
35:07 - just learning about sequence why is it
35:09 - important that we do things in order and
35:11 - you'll find in a lot of our lessons we
35:14 - tie this to some real-world examples
35:16 - like washing our hands what is the order
35:19 - of you know the sequence that we follow
35:21 - and we wash my hands what are some other
35:24 - things that we have to do in order and
35:26 - really understanding like it's important
35:28 - to put commands in a correct in the
35:30 - correct order in order to complete a
35:32 - task also can conditions and these are
35:35 - things that are good for kinder and
35:37 - first grade if you're working with pre-k
35:40 - stick with just sequence you're gonna
35:42 - find that um those arrows learning right
35:46 - left up down just putting things in
35:49 - order as can you take you a significant
35:51 - amount of time so I think that'll be
35:53 - plenty what is the benefit of signing in
35:56 - so we already kind of went over this
35:58 - your progress is going to be saved
36:00 - you're going to be able to access
36:01 - quotable later I'm gonna stop sharing my
36:04 - screen so you can see me Here I am um
36:11 - this code will work on Android not
36:14 - currently it's only iOS and web and put
36:17 - any web browser will work so game code
36:21 - Volcom or game code Volcom slash hour of
36:27 - code
36:30 - how do I connect coding to realize many
36:35 - of our lessons like I talked about with
36:36 - washing your hands and things like that
36:38 - have real-world connections and actually
36:40 - every lesson that we offer has an
36:44 - off-screen portion so we're really big
36:46 - on off-screen learning for elementary
36:47 - especially with the lower elementary
36:50 - it's just a great way to kind of tie
36:51 - coding into like a tangible example it's
36:55 - easy for them to relate to and so like I
36:58 - said you'll find good old world
36:59 - connections in just about every lesson
37:09 - why am I getting a server error issue
37:12 - and my students tried to log in a lot of
37:15 - times this is a firewall issue we have a
37:17 - support center article about how to fix
37:19 - it and that is that support code Volcom
37:22 - and you can check out the
37:24 - troubleshooting section how do I
37:28 - introduce quotable to a group of
37:30 - students my first graders are having
37:32 - difficulty understanding how to work
37:34 - beyond the basic levels um I would say
37:38 - that it sounds like perhaps your kids
37:41 - are moving ahead in codable beyond just
37:45 - what they know like is suitable for a
37:48 - first grader like we showed you that
37:49 - pacing at the beginning um
37:51 - I think perhaps it might be helpful to
37:54 - unassign some of that game content to
37:57 - come back a little bit and just kind of
37:59 - go over some of the lessons covering the
38:02 - concepts that they're struggling with
38:03 - making sure that they are seeing you
38:08 - know understanding vocabulary
38:10 - understanding why we're doing this on
38:12 - screen what does it mean to use these
38:14 - colored blocks you know if I do this
38:16 - then that will happen a lot of times the
38:19 - first graders you hear about them
38:20 - getting tripped up on conditions and
38:22 - loops if they haven't really been
38:24 - exposed to the why behind the what we're
38:27 - doing so what is appropriate coding
38:34 - instruction for each grade level K to
38:37 - five that is a pretty long-winded
38:41 - question
38:42 - or sorry long-winded answer um I would
38:46 - say the best way to find what's
38:49 - appropriate for students at each grade
38:51 - level is to take a look at our suggested
38:55 - pacing you can find this in our Help
38:57 - Center at support codable comm and then
39:01 - what will students learn and this is
39:03 - going to give you a year one pacing
39:05 - suggestion so if your kids have not done
39:07 - any coding before you're starting from
39:09 - scratch that's where you want to check
39:11 - it out if your kids have been using
39:14 - codable for a year or if this is your
39:16 - second or third year we have a your your
39:19 - two and beyond
39:20 - pacing that's also on that on that page
39:22 - that you can take a look at can students
39:29 - log into codable with their Google
39:30 - accounts no they need to use the class
39:34 - code or their student code or they use
39:37 - the code Volcom slash hour of code login
39:42 - to play without saving option well i be
39:47 - able to watch this webinar after
39:48 - thursday night yes you can come back to
39:50 - this link any time and it will be
39:52 - archived here thanks to our lovely
39:54 - friend youtube how do I add a co-teacher
40:00 - to a free code ball account I've created
40:02 - accounts for a kid one teachers to get
40:04 - ready for the hour of code the kids love
40:06 - it yeah I'm so glad and I think the
40:09 - teachers and they want to continue
40:10 - coding throughout the school year
40:12 - so for a free account it's not possible
40:16 - to link with other teachers within your
40:18 - school um you have this option if you
40:21 - have a paid account so if you're on a
40:23 - game access plan or our school
40:25 - curriculum plan you have the option to
40:28 - be the admin and invite teachers to link
40:30 - and then they can have access to their
40:32 - class but it is not an option or free
40:35 - accounts
40:35 - unfortunately mmm Kim student saved
40:44 - their progress throughout the week if so
40:46 - how oh I see if they don't have
40:52 - if they're playing from the our code
40:53 - page progress won't save if you are
40:56 - logging them in with a class code that
40:59 - progress saves automatically so anytime
41:01 - they're playing with with a class code
41:03 - no matter what device if that device hat
41:05 - is connected to the internet that
41:07 - progress has uploaded to us and the next
41:09 - time they log in it's going to be saved
41:11 - again if they're not if it's not
41:13 - connected to the Internet when the
41:15 - device does connect to the internet it's
41:17 - going to upload that progress so as long
41:19 - as it eventually connects to the
41:21 - Internet we're gonna have that progress
41:23 - saved for you are all online features
41:32 - available on iPads yes the web and iPad
41:36 - version of codable are identical is it
41:40 - possible to have students share an iPad
41:42 - and record progress pair programming is
41:45 - something we definitely encourage so
41:47 - much fun it's a great it's a whole
41:49 - nother lesson learning how to
41:52 - collaborate for the peer how to
41:53 - communicate about what you're doing on
41:55 - screen and something we definitely
41:57 - encourage and progress will only be
41:59 - saved for the account that they are
42:01 - playing on so if they're playing if
42:02 - Susie and Bobby are playing together and
42:04 - they're playing on Susie's account
42:06 - Susie's progress will be saved
42:07 - obviously Bobby wasn't logged in so it's
42:10 - not going to save us nothing has
42:11 - happened on Bobby's account um sorry I
42:19 - keep losing my place um is there a way
42:22 - to automatically provide students in
42:24 - each class with a link to their codable
42:26 - web page through Google classroom or
42:28 - other yes you can bookmark that URL that
42:33 - is there on your roster for any class so
42:38 - if you want to save that URL and attach
42:41 - it to your classroom website we
42:43 - definitely encourage that it's a super
42:45 - way to get kids signed on quickly once
42:51 - all of the amazing codable skills have
42:54 - been mastered by our students that's a
42:56 - great way of raising question I love it
42:58 - what would you recommend as the next
43:00 - steps for them to pursue on the road to
43:02 - develop in computer programming skills
43:04 - excellent
43:06 - I would suggest if you are looking into
43:09 - middle school code HS is an excellent
43:12 - option for middle and high school to
43:15 - start learning some JavaScript API Java
43:18 - we've got a number of different courses
43:23 - available there's also a lot of options
43:28 - out there for learning written code we
43:32 - start introducing syntax to students at
43:34 - the end of codable starting at 4th and
43:36 - 5th grade 3rd 4th and 5th grade so they
43:39 - should be familiar with what syntax
43:40 - looks like I would encourage you to move
43:42 - away from things that are all block
43:45 - based or don't have any syntax if they
43:48 - have been exposed to some syntax and
43:50 - they're ready to start programming start
43:52 - looking at some options that are out
43:54 - there to help them get familiar with
43:56 - that there's a lot of great tools
43:58 - introducing JavaScript JavaScript that's
44:01 - why we chose it it's one of the most
44:02 - widely used languages in the world so I
44:06 - would encourage you to throwing some
44:08 - great drop free JavaScript tools and
44:10 - start getting them into that you can do
44:13 - you can create games you can create
44:15 - action create website there's so many
44:17 - different things you can do with
44:18 - JavaScript so basically it's a cheese
44:20 - you're an adventure type thing find out
44:22 - what they're interested in and give them
44:24 - some resources to explore what is the
44:29 - best resource for funding codable I'm
44:30 - using the free lessons but I want more
44:33 - smiley base yes I'm teaching a coding
44:36 - Club just one hour a week in pool so the
44:38 - school district / school is not funding
44:41 - my program at this time um I would
44:45 - suggest you taking a look at our our
44:49 - funding resources document on our
44:51 - support page support koco.com again um I
44:55 - would also encourage you to talk to your
44:57 - PTA parents are super into coding they
45:00 - are very supportive I think it's like 9
45:03 - out of 10 parents want their school to
45:05 - be teaching it and we need to tell me
45:07 - like 40 percent of schools are so um I
45:10 - would really encourage you to talk to
45:12 - your PTA the other thing is to encourage
45:16 - more teachers at your school to
45:18 - start coding if you want quotable the
45:20 - best way to get an administrator to take
45:23 - notice into things and it's worthwhile
45:25 - to purchase is to get more people on
45:27 - board so teachers are some of the best
45:29 - salespeople I've ever met they are great
45:31 - advocates for things they love talk to
45:33 - other people model for them show them
45:35 - what happy engagement that's happening
45:38 - and why you love it and I'm sure you'll
45:40 - see some some teachers take take Holden
45:43 - and start using it for classes if
45:49 - they're an online store where I can buy
45:51 - quotable merchandise t-shirts hats plush
45:53 - buzzes oh I wish but no not yet how to
45:58 - modify for students with special needs
46:00 - or ESL students so this is not our area
46:04 - of expertise I'll start by saying that
46:06 - I'm just my desk so you can see my whole
46:09 - face um but we do have a lot of people
46:12 - that use codable for these students um
46:18 - since there are so many different
46:19 - possibilities I would say it's hard for
46:22 - us to say exactly how but we have seen
46:24 - it works really well with Yale students
46:26 - with students with autism especially we
46:29 - hear a lot for encouraging communication
46:32 - among peers because they get so excited
46:34 - when they win we make beat a level when
46:37 - it works really hard um you can touch
46:39 - encourage them to talk about it I'm
46:41 - asking did you do how did you do that
46:43 - tell me tell me what you came up with
46:45 - what was your solution um and just
46:48 - listen to them um and I've seen that
46:50 - firsthand in a classroom and it was
46:53 - beautiful so an encourage that what is
46:58 - the lowest grade level this is
47:00 - appropriate for we recommend
47:02 - kindergarten but we do have a lot of
47:04 - people use football in pre-k we started
47:07 - with kindergarten um that's really our
47:10 - area of expertise and we moved up from
47:13 - there
47:14 - but pre-k students the motor skills
47:17 - sometimes aren't quite ready for it
47:19 - the logic is all there but I'm learning
47:22 - to drag and drop on an iPad
47:24 - a little bit difficult for them as well
47:26 - as if you're using a browser doing a
47:30 - trackpad or using your mouse is going to
47:32 - be challenging so something that you can
47:35 - do is some pair programming with older -
47:37 - older students that is so fun having the
47:41 - younger ones explain what to do to the
47:44 - older ones is a blast so I would
47:46 - encourage that how do we print
47:49 - certificates we went over the
47:51 - certificates enter your email address
47:53 - and you will receive a link and that's
47:54 - how you print them best way to set up
48:00 - multi-age classrooms I have the gifted
48:03 - and talented kids here range and grades
48:05 - from cage five my class that I set up
48:08 - was a k2 five spacing I would encourage
48:10 - you to setup the same and then kind of
48:12 - go from there take a look at our pacing
48:14 - guide decide what's going to be
48:15 - appropriate for your students usually
48:18 - gifted talented classes it's more of a
48:21 - individual basis so if you want to kind
48:25 - of open things up for them and let them
48:27 - move at their own pace that's definitely
48:29 - something that is available to you
48:31 - is there a Help button who kids don't
48:34 - know how to move forward I know but I'm
48:37 - a huge fan of s3 than me my favorite
48:41 - teaching tool so encourage kids to talk
48:44 - to other students then I can't find the
48:46 - solution talk to you and if a lot of
48:50 - kids are having trouble on a certain
48:51 - level it's a great opportunity to take a
48:54 - look at why we're having this problem
48:57 - what can we do together to solve it I'm
48:59 - having a conversation of our problem
49:01 - solving and then if it is you know like
49:03 - our question earlier multiple kids
49:07 - we're having trouble perhaps it's time
49:10 - to stop and then take a look at some of
49:12 - the lessons and see where we were wrong
49:13 - and how we can really encourage them to
49:17 - understand more about the concept how do
49:23 - I set up K in first grade classes
49:25 - they're not allowed to use student names
49:27 - or any identical and I didn't
49:30 - identifiable data
49:37 - you are free to use any identifier that
49:40 - you want so if you want to have them
49:43 - come up with user names we don't
49:46 - technically we don't store any of that
49:48 - information it's only what you give us
49:50 - so if you want to come up with user
49:53 - names for your students if they have a
49:56 - student code or they have like something
49:58 - that they use with other programs we
50:00 - definitely encourage you to use that you
50:02 - something that you have permission to
50:05 - share but we do not share any data we
50:08 - don't even look at any data honestly as
50:10 - though we use our our student codes so
50:17 - what would be considered a successful
50:19 - error of code I think it looks up to you
50:24 - I I think that if you feel like you kind
50:31 - of challenged yourself came out of your
50:34 - comfort zone tried something new you had
50:37 - students engaged and talking and you
50:41 - know that buzz that's in a classroom
50:42 - when learning is happening I think that
50:45 - that is success but honestly if it goes
50:48 - for more than just the hour of code if
50:50 - you go beyond CS ed week that is what I
50:53 - think we're all trying to accomplish
50:56 - here is to get more schools engaging
50:58 - with computer science education taking
51:01 - it beyond an hour of code because an
51:02 - hour is not enough really it needs to be
51:05 - something that's happening throughout
51:06 - the year because this is gonna be a part
51:09 - of our kids future forever you know
51:12 - there's going to be more and more jobs
51:13 - created more and more jobs lost to
51:16 - automation because of you know
51:18 - technology so I really encourage you to
51:21 - bring computer science into as many
51:23 - lessons as you can and I think that
51:25 - you'll find our lesson library really
51:26 - helpful for that there's a lot in there
51:29 - for integrative lessons so yeah I hope
51:33 - that you see this as a jumping-off point
51:35 - and not just a one-time thing okay I'm
51:41 - going to take a look and see you have
51:43 - any questions in our live chat I believe
51:45 - John has been handling that like a pro
51:58 - and don't see any questions I see
52:01 - something awesome conversations um but
52:05 - yeah so I think that's everything um but
