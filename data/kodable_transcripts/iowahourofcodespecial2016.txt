00:00 - all right here we are um hi everybody my
00:05 - name is Gretchen humor and I am with the
00:07 - founders of Kota bowl I am so excited to
00:11 - talk with Iowa educators today about the
00:14 - hour of code why it's important how you
00:17 - can get started I just all of the great
00:19 - things that that entails um I've got
00:22 - with me here angel mendez she is from
00:26 - the governor's office she works in the
00:29 - organization called Iowa stem and she's
00:32 - in charge of all the communications and
00:34 - marketing for them and making sure that
00:36 - you guys know about all the wonderful
00:37 - things that they're doing we've been
00:39 - working together for a little while um
00:41 - you know kind of figuring out how to
00:44 - improve um you know the things that are
00:48 - offered to Iowa educators for computer
00:51 - science we've been learning a lot about
00:53 - all the great things that they've been
00:54 - doing and how we can help um and so I'm
00:57 - really excited to have her speak with
00:59 - you guys but first I want to and just
01:01 - quickly go over some of the things we're
01:03 - going to be talking about we're going to
01:05 - go over now the hour of code what it is
01:07 - why it's relevant I think that if you're
01:09 - here you probably already know all that
01:11 - so we'll go over it quickly um and then
01:13 - we'll talk a little bit about what to
01:15 - expect and how you can prepare and then
01:17 - what I'm really excited about is how to
01:19 - prepare so that you can go beyond an
01:22 - hour of code that's a big thing that
01:25 - we've been hearing a lot about from
01:26 - people this year is you know I this is a
01:28 - kickoff for me for the rest of my school
01:30 - year um and some people they've done it
01:32 - before other people this is their first
01:34 - attempt at doing the hour of code and so
01:36 - there you know look excited but a little
01:38 - bit apprehensive about what to expect
01:40 - and so we're just going to go through
01:41 - some of the things you can do to prepare
01:43 - so that you're off and rolling um
01:45 - successfully for the rest of the school
01:47 - year and so without further ado I would
01:50 - like to present angel mendez she's gonna
01:52 - tell you guys what all resources are
01:56 - available specifically for Iowa
01:58 - educators and then we'll get into the
02:00 - details of what to expect right Thank
02:04 - You breslin hi everybody this is angel
02:06 - mendez and the communications manager
02:08 - for the iphone the stem advisors if
02:11 - you've you never the organization before
02:13 - will let me tell you knew Geist it is a
02:15 - resource for STEM education for Iowa
02:18 - educators both in school and out of
02:21 - school there are myriad of things I
02:23 - could tell you about but just know if
02:25 - you go to Iowa stem gov there are a list
02:28 - of everything you can do to get involved
02:30 - with them there's a regional stem
02:32 - manager who is charged with making sure
02:34 - that you're aware of those opportunities
02:36 - and linking you up with those that are
02:39 - most appropriate to you one of those is
02:41 - why we're here today called code Iowa
02:43 - and that's our attempt to localize the
02:47 - hour of code to Iowa and getting more
02:49 - Iowans whether it's parents grandparents
02:52 - kids
02:53 - educators businesspeople lawmakers you
02:57 - name it everyone across Iowa to try one
03:00 - hour of computer coding during computer
03:02 - science education week which is December
03:04 - sent through the 11th I believe just two
03:08 - weeks away and so with code Iowa what we
03:11 - do it's a really a two-part thing the
03:13 - first part is we give away what we call
03:16 - code Iowa technology awards we're giving
03:19 - away six this year however that
03:21 - application closed just last Friday so
03:25 - that opportunity has since closed but
03:27 - it's an annual thing under thirty five
03:29 - hundred dollars to buy instructional
03:31 - technology for your classroom both are
03:33 - sponsored by google and verizon they've
03:37 - been gracious partners in that capacity
03:39 - and
03:42 - so we'll be announcing who those
03:44 - awardees are during computer science
03:46 - education week however there's still a
03:48 - thing for you to get involved in and
03:49 - that is you need to register your event
03:52 - on the hour of code website if you go to
03:55 - our code calm and just scroll towards
03:57 - the bottom of the page there's a join us
04:00 - um place where you put you know what
04:03 - your organization is what your first and
04:05 - last name is I think an email very
04:07 - simple just to say that yes I'm hosting
04:09 - an event in Iowa and this is what it's
04:11 - going to look like and your name will be
04:13 - put on a list on the arm code website
04:15 - where we'll pull from and say these are
04:17 - all of the all of the organizations in
04:20 - Iowa that participate in the hour of
04:22 - code they are now being certified code
04:25 - iowa partners is what we call them and
04:28 - every one of those people on that list
04:29 - will be eligible for computer science
04:32 - trainings that we are planning some in
04:35 - partnership with kota bowl some with
04:37 - oracle academy and some with code org as
04:41 - well coming in the spring and summer of
04:43 - 2017 so if you haven't already
04:46 - registered your event on that website
04:48 - and we'll make sure you get added to
04:50 - that list otherwise I guess I think
04:53 - Gretchen said we wanted to open it for a
04:55 - couple of questions Gretchen I'm seeing
04:57 - any yet that that we can address and
05:00 - regards this the stem Council and what
05:02 - we do I'm not seeing any yet I can we
05:08 - can wait a couple seconds and see if we
05:09 - have any group any role in um I should
05:11 - have said ahead of time you guys can
05:13 - send us questions through Twitter at
05:17 - Kota bowl if you're following a new one
05:20 - use social media if you want to use the
05:23 - chat we've got to check out up here on
05:25 - the left hand side if you're in google
05:27 - hangouts um otherwise if you want to
05:29 - post to the YouTube page where you're
05:31 - watching live you can also do that um so
05:34 - I've got all of those things up if you
05:36 - want to post your question we'll wait a
05:37 - couple minutes our minute or so and see
05:40 - if we have anything roll in um I have a
05:44 - couple of questions for you angel um
05:46 - just while we're waiting uh so what do
05:50 - you think uh you know is one of the
05:53 - challenges that Iowa educators are
05:55 - facing you know getting started with an
05:58 - hour of code is there anything that you
06:00 - guys do to kind of help them overcome
06:01 - that
06:02 - well I think the biggest thing is it's
06:05 - um it's not a new topic at all computer
06:08 - science has been around for a while but
06:10 - it's another hour ago
06:12 - there's not a lot of people who are
06:15 - actually doing it in the schools and
06:17 - that's because right now Iowa doesn't
06:19 - really have a system of getting more
06:21 - computer science into the schools in all
06:23 - of the schools as well you know you
06:24 - think of libraries museums Girl Scouts
06:27 - Boy Scouts there's all sorts of organic
06:30 - organizations taking this on to and I
06:33 - think co.org is a really great job of
06:35 - getting those people who are first
06:37 - hearing about computer science and
06:39 - connecting so how to get that going so
06:42 - instead of us trying to create that what
06:44 - we've done is really latching on to the
06:46 - latching onto code.org and really
06:49 - promoting that as strongly as we can
06:52 - across the state as a means to get that
06:56 - going and from there they can take it
06:57 - and run with it and make it what what
06:59 - they want because I can set at this
07:01 - point there's not really a system in
07:03 - place that says kind of what that's
07:05 - going to look like there is however why
07:09 - sure there was some state legislation
07:11 - that was turned down Oliver I believe
07:14 - there is more calm than pipe we could
07:17 - say that is focused on computer science
07:21 - that we can hope to see past this year's
07:24 - well I don't know too many details on
07:26 - that but I think in the coming month I
07:27 - might have more information so apparent
07:30 - just say that all i'm following that you
07:31 - can always reach out to me as well and i
07:34 - can share it with
07:35 - ok and then um it's good to hear what
07:39 - you guys are doing you know at a state
07:40 - level but what are some of the things
07:41 - that people can find locally if they you
07:44 - know are reaching out to try and find
07:46 - some support within their town or city
07:49 - you know where they can look to that i
07:51 - would say i would point you to we have
07:54 - six regional send managers across the
07:56 - state and those you know we broke iowa
07:58 - up into six pieces of the pie and in
08:02 - each of those regions there's what we
08:03 - call regional sim manager that's house
08:05 - that either one of the regent
08:07 - universities or at a community college
08:09 - and that person is the one that's really
08:12 - charged with making sure that that
08:15 - educator whether they're in for out of
08:18 - school is connected with you know those
08:20 - those opportunities that they're
08:21 - interested in so at the state level me
08:23 - being just the voice of stem and i can
08:27 - tell you off the top of my head you know
08:28 - oh there is you know this organization
08:31 - and mists you know southern part of iowa
08:33 - that's really good that would be
08:35 - something that our managers would know
08:36 - and they're really good about connecting
08:38 - those pieces for us so if you have an
08:42 - interest in learning more about who your
08:44 - regional manager is you go to iowa stem
08:47 - gov / regions i'll put this in the
08:49 - now perfect and they can find their
08:52 - regional manager based on what city they
08:55 - are located in awesome okay great and
08:58 - then my last question I'm not seeing
09:01 - anything coming in let me check Twitter
09:03 - one more time but um
09:05 - do you
09:07 - know I know that a big concern for a lot
09:10 - of people when they're talking about
09:11 - getting started with coding and
09:12 - especially dating it beyond you know the
09:15 - hour of code is cost and there's a lot
09:18 - of free things that are available but
09:19 - you know for people who know they want
09:23 - to do a full k25 roll out or that you
09:26 - know k to 12 even and cost can be a
09:29 - major concern for them what are some
09:31 - ways that they can go about finding
09:33 - financial resources and what are some
09:36 - that exists just to give people an idea
09:38 - of what's available for them well I can
09:41 - think of two things off the top of my
09:42 - head the first one up is pretty easy and
09:45 - that's better what I mentioned earlier
09:47 - if you're wanting to continue pursuing
09:50 - computer science down the road beyond
09:52 - you know just the neck in the next two
09:55 - weeks we have those computer science
09:57 - training so again you want to make sure
09:59 - you get your a bit register and what
10:01 - happens is we put you on a list will
10:03 - send you information about all these
10:04 - trainings that were planning on having
10:06 - in the spring and summer and those
10:08 - trainings are naturally pretty already
10:10 - which is great however you know to get
10:13 - out of the classroom is actually go to
10:15 - these trainings there's travel that you
10:18 - have to live take on and there's also
10:20 - the faculty of the paper substitute
10:22 - teacher to take over the classroom while
10:24 - you're gone and what's nice to us again
10:25 - through google and verizon were able to
10:27 - help supplement those additional costs
10:30 - beyond the actual training to actually
10:32 - get you there on to participate the
10:35 - second thing too is what what the same
10:38 - counsel really wants to do is help bring
10:41 - communities together we want businesses
10:44 - and educators to connect because that's
10:46 - what's ultimately going to help
10:49 - feed the future pipeline talent pipeline
10:51 - of iowa and that community is going to
10:55 - look different across the state there
10:57 - are different sort of industries in each
10:59 - of these little communities so maybe you
11:01 - have a business in your city that is
11:05 - really reliant on technology or really
11:07 - reliant on computer science take this
11:10 - idea to them say we want to get you know
11:12 - co double in our classroom where we want
11:14 - to get um
11:15 - you know some other known a computer
11:19 - science software to teach our students
11:21 - these ins and outs of it um you know
11:24 - reach out to them bring them the cost
11:26 - pitch it to them there's businesses are
11:29 - more eager to get involved with the
11:31 - schools and I think most of us really
11:33 - imagine and that's one of the things
11:34 - that we've seen through the stem council
11:36 - because we are so involved not only with
11:39 - education but also with economic
11:40 - development I think if you just reach
11:42 - out to the local
11:44 - community aspect and tap into that
11:47 - you're really going to see some things
11:48 - at them awesome okay well thank you so
11:52 - much for joining us um I I'm not saying
11:54 - anything but I can I share people with
11:58 - people who have questions I maybe at the
12:00 - end or throughout can I share your
12:02 - contact information with them oh yeah of
12:04 - course please go ahead perfect i will
12:06 - post that on the YouTube page and on the
12:10 - event page in facebook as well so that
12:12 - they have that
12:13 - all right thank you so much have a great
12:15 - evening and a happy thanksgiving for
12:17 - Prince Gretchen all right bye bye
12:21 - okay everybody um so that was angel and
12:25 - it sounds like um there's a lot of great
12:28 - things out there for everybody um you
12:32 - know who's interested in going beyond an
12:33 - hour of code but also getting started
12:34 - you know we've got a lot of really cool
12:36 - opportunities in Iowa and to be honest
12:39 - with you all that you know there's
12:40 - things that are offered in Iowa that I
12:44 - haven't seen in many other states and so
12:47 - you guys are very fortunate i'm really
12:48 - excited to be partnering with the
12:50 - governor's office and with iowa stem and
12:53 - with code iowa it's really exciting to
12:55 - see you know then making a change in
12:57 - their state so um that's really great
13:00 - we're going to go ahead and jump into
13:02 - what the hour of code is why it's
13:04 - important um and and go from there so
13:07 - the hour of code is an event that
13:11 - started about three years ago through a
13:14 - partnership between cobourg and
13:17 - computer science education week and
13:19 - these two groups got together they
13:21 - wanted to take an opportunity to provoke
13:23 - computer science to every person
13:27 - especially students so that they can see
13:31 - what it can do to just try one hour one
13:35 - hour of coding um and so that naturally
13:39 - with the name came about the hour of
13:41 - code um the week changes every year but
13:45 - it's usually the first week of December
13:47 - and that's computer science education
13:49 - week and so it's a really big movement
13:52 - to get kids just excited about computer
13:56 - science to get your communities excited
13:58 - about computer science to get your
14:00 - colleagues and your administrators
14:02 - excited about what can come of showing
14:05 - kids you know maybe not expecting every
14:07 - child to become a programmer but just
14:08 - showing them the opportunities that are
14:10 - available for learning how to code and
14:13 - what kind of things can open up to them
14:15 - if they do decide to pursue learning to
14:18 - code and so you know it's a really fun
14:20 - week it's my favorite week of the year
14:22 - it's the biggest holiday for me so um
14:24 - it's just very exciting there's such a
14:27 - great sense of community that comes out
14:29 - of it just everybody sharing about it
14:31 - and everyone's talking and there's a
14:33 - real buzz in the school that you don't
14:35 - wrote that you don't always feel you
14:37 - know it's easy to get caught up in the
14:39 - procedures and and the day-to-day grind
14:41 - but you know it's just a really fun way
14:44 - to learn new things learn problem
14:46 - solving in an interesting way that we
14:49 - don't do every year so every day um
14:52 - so that's that's a little bit about you
14:55 - know the hour of code and why it's
14:56 - important um you know obviously learning
15:01 - to code is a very important thing for
15:03 - our future information and for our kids
15:06 - there's going to be two hundred
15:09 - or there's going to be two million open
15:12 - computer science jobs in by 2020 and so
15:17 - having
15:19 - kids be prepared to you know go into the
15:22 - workforce with a little bit of an
15:23 - understanding of computer science if not
15:25 - you know fluent in a programming
15:27 - language gives them a huge opportunity
15:29 - when they give into a workforce and when
15:32 - they go and beyond and so doing
15:35 - everything that we can to prepare them
15:37 - for that is crucial so we'll go ahead
15:40 - and jump into what to expect with the
15:42 - hour of code and and how you can get
15:44 - started we're going to focus
15:47 - mostly on co double and how to get
15:49 - started with code but do cool shirt
15:51 - mention of it
15:54 - is just a phenomenal partner we've been
15:57 - partnering with them for three years
15:58 - along with a lot of other companies and
16:01 - they provide tons and tons of tutorials
16:03 - for free french caters to get started
16:07 - this year we have 19 that we have
16:11 - promoted through code org and I know
16:14 - that there's no
16:16 - hundreds of others that are available
16:18 - and so if you go to code org slash learn
16:21 - um you can find a lot of great resources
16:24 - available to our code website as well
16:27 - there's a lot of great stuff to view
16:29 - into you know sort of figure out what
16:31 - you think is best for your students and
16:33 - what you want to work on
16:35 - or take a look at what's available i may
16:38 - keep going um
16:40 - perspective but i know we do a lot of
16:42 - work we've been start we started know
16:45 - about in august getting our tutorials
16:48 - prepared so that it would be as easy as
16:49 - possible for people who just find us on
16:51 - you know that site and can it go through
16:53 - you know every step of the way we hold
16:56 - their hand and then make sure that
16:57 - they're ready for the big event during
17:00 - the hour of code and so you'll find that
17:02 - a lot of the tutorial partners are very
17:04 - eager to help very willing to it you
17:06 - know guide you if you do have questions
17:08 - but the tutorials are really helpful and
17:11 - knowing exactly what you can do with
17:13 - your students I know this year code.org
17:15 - is excited to be promoting more lesson
17:17 - plans we've provided lesson plans just
17:20 - about every year that we've participated
17:21 - but I know a lot of others are providing
17:24 - lesson plans as well um so let's go
17:27 - ahead and dive in and i'll be sure to
17:31 - you no answer any questions that come up
17:33 - so if you do have questions there's a
17:35 - chat window on the side of the
17:39 - the youtube chick page where this is
17:42 - streaming and
17:43 - you can also comment or you can tweet at
17:47 - me and again our twitter handle is at go
17:50 - to bowl
17:51 - and so you can always tweet at co dab'll
17:54 - and i'll be sure to answer your
17:56 - questions so if no one has questions
17:59 - right now then I'll keep going alright
18:02 - so um
18:06 - you can find all of the quotable hour of
18:10 - code
18:11 - resources at
18:13 - co double com / our dash of dash code
18:18 - and i'll go ahead and show you what
18:20 - we've got available there
18:21 - [Music]
18:24 - see here
18:26 - from working really hard at getting this
18:28 - up and ready for you guys so um
18:32 - excited for you to see it
18:40 - [Music]
18:51 - okay so you can see here um this is our
18:56 - hour of code site we've got a lot of
19:00 - great resources here if you want to go
19:03 - to our lesson plans we've got over 19
19:05 - lesson plans our curriculum director
19:08 - working tirelessly assembling all of
19:11 - these for you guys she was an elementary
19:13 - school teacher for many years and he's
19:17 - been working with us for the past year
19:19 - and just completely revamped our
19:21 - curriculum but if she's thrilled to be
19:23 - able to offer you guys some hour of code
19:26 - specific tutorials um so if you click on
19:29 - any of these you can see we've got four
19:30 - categories we've got beginner
19:32 - programming advanced programming
19:35 - robotics and then what I'm most excited
19:38 - about this year is ela and programming
19:40 - we know that you know for a big big
19:42 - challenge is finding time in the day for
19:44 - computer science and how can you fit it
19:47 - into your schedule and there's already
19:48 - so many things we need to teach how in
19:50 - the world am I going to teach something
19:51 - new um
19:53 - well the way to you know sort of fitted
19:57 - in is integrating it with what you're
19:59 - already teaching and so we put together
20:01 - an ela
20:03 - lesson plan and then you can see the
20:06 - standards that are taught with each of
20:08 - these lessons on you know on these icons
20:11 - a lesson plan that covers a standard for
20:15 - each grade level in writing and also
20:18 - helps teach some programming so let's go
20:20 - ahead and take a look at the
20:21 - kindergarten one
20:23 - the way that our lessons are structured
20:26 - is um it follows a typical lesson lesson
20:29 - structure or a lesson cycle we do a few
20:32 - minutes of direct instruction where we
20:33 - you know open up and talk start a
20:35 - discussion with students about what is
20:38 - computer science and why is this
20:39 - important and put it in terms that they
20:41 - can understand and relate it to their
20:43 - world and it's this is all completely
20:45 - scripted you can see here and then we
20:49 - introduce the new material we talk about
20:51 - you know what we're going to be doing
20:53 - here why why it's important and how we
20:56 - can work together
20:57 - and in this example they're going to be
20:59 - doing sentence puzzles so putting
21:02 - together a sentence and learning the
21:04 - structure of a sentence and how that
21:06 - relates to sequence which is an
21:08 - important concept in programming it's
21:11 - really the first and most fundamental
21:12 - concept that we teach to students
21:14 - especially for kindergarteners you know
21:16 - we start putting things in order a
21:18 - computer is a machine that reads things
21:21 - in a very specific order it will only
21:22 - read things in the order that we tell it
21:24 - to and so that is why putting things in
21:26 - the correct order is the most important
21:28 - thing to learn in the most foundational
21:30 - concepts for students or when we're
21:32 - getting started with computer science um
21:34 - and with programming and so that's what
21:37 - we go over in this lesson in obviously
21:39 - there's some clear tie into ela and so
21:43 - three or four kilo directors and a
21:45 - fantastic job in putting together these
21:48 - lesson plans so that you can do know
21:51 - some writing with your kids while you're
21:54 - doing some programming and then after
21:58 - doing the independent or the the direct
22:02 - instruction you can move into some
22:04 - guided practice where everybody works
22:05 - together
22:06 - so using a sentence puzzle follow their
22:10 - own graphic organizers and hens they'll
22:11 - be able to copy a sentence puzzle and
22:14 - fill it out and
22:16 - they do that together and then
22:18 - independent practice you can do a little
22:21 - bit of programming together um and so
22:23 - each lesson you know finishes with a
22:27 - closing exit ticket eh and everybody
22:29 - really understands you know what we
22:32 - learned here today what is sequence what
22:34 - are sentences and how are they
22:35 - structured and going on from there and
22:38 - each of these ela lesson plans is
22:40 - actually set up to be appropriate for
22:44 - I'm sorry to be appropriate for each
22:48 - grade level so in fifth grade you know
22:50 - rather than doing sentence puzzles um
22:52 - you know they're writing a short story
22:54 - doing a little bit of creative writing
22:56 - and
22:58 - working together on that so um and
23:01 - that's just our ela lesson plans we have
23:03 - robotics
23:05 - which features Dash and dot of wonder
23:08 - workshop um some advanced so you can
23:11 - start learning some JavaScript and
23:13 - object-oriented programming with your
23:15 - upper elementary students doing
23:17 - conditions and advanced sequencing with
23:20 - your kindergartners so these are some of
23:22 - our advanced lesson plans and they all
23:24 - follow that same structure of you know
23:26 - direct instruction independent practice
23:28 - and some direct instruction guided
23:31 - practice and an independent practice
23:33 - with the the final section of
23:35 - independent practice being done in Kota
23:38 - belong screen everything else has done
23:40 - off-screen together as a class so that
23:43 - really helps give kids a tangible
23:45 - example of what you're going to be
23:46 - learning why it's important and relating
23:49 - it to their real world into their
23:51 - day-to-day which is crucial when you're
23:54 - talking about such abstract technology
23:58 - technological concepts and so once you
24:02 - complete you know the first two sections
24:04 - of
24:05 - these lessons where you know you make
24:08 - sure you introduce it vocabulary to do
24:10 - the direct instruction you do a guided
24:12 - practice activity together I'm in this
24:14 - one you know it's a dance party where
24:16 - you put together a loop to music you
24:20 - know say the chicken dance you know
24:22 - you're in a repeat portions which would
24:23 - be programming concept called a loop and
24:26 - then you can um once you've done those
24:29 - four sections you can jump into
24:31 - independent practice oh you know for
24:33 - five to ten fifteen minutes where the
24:36 - kids are coding together or
24:38 - independently on their devices so it's
24:41 - really a holistic approach to teaching
24:43 - CS making sure that we're taking things
24:46 - you know slowly and off-screen in
24:48 - learning in in a lot of different ways
24:50 - for every type of learner and then
24:52 - coming together at the end and bringing
24:54 - out the technology and really putting
24:55 - our new concept into practice um so you
25:00 - can find all of these lesson plans
25:02 - like I said on our hour of code landing
25:08 - page
25:09 - down here at the bottom I'll go ahead
25:11 - and put the link in the chat window for
25:13 - you
25:19 - and that's where you can go to find all
25:21 - of those um
25:23 - does anybody have any questions on
25:26 - anything that I've covered so far
25:32 - [Music]
25:36 - just check
25:38 - my locations for questions doesn't look
25:41 - like yet um
25:46 - ok so let us go ahead and continue um
25:52 - so once you have your lesson plan and
25:54 - and you've decided what you want to do
25:57 - there's a couple of things you're going
25:59 - to need to set up for your kids to get
26:02 - started you know you do the lesson and
26:04 - then you want them to be able to you
26:05 - know as quickly as possible or as
26:07 - seamlessly as possible with a class full
26:10 - of you know 2011 tree school students to
26:13 - jump into other independent practice
26:15 - portion and so where you're going to
26:17 - have them go is this this section right
26:19 - here students get started play now
26:22 - that's going to take them to
26:25 - game notable calm / hour of code if you
26:30 - have a coda Bowl class setup and you
26:33 - want to use that you can click play with
26:36 - a class source student code if you don't
26:38 - have a code will account a quotable
26:39 - teacher account or class setup just
26:42 - click play without saving and that will
26:44 - let them create a session right here
26:46 - just for the hour of code without having
26:48 - to set it up ahead of time and then
26:50 - they're often running straight into
26:53 - horrible and they can get going and
26:56 - learning you know right just by hitting
26:59 - play I'll take them to the first lesson
27:01 - humble in size get to meet me so you can
27:05 - see it's really fresh
27:08 - once they've been taught about hospice
27:10 - concept of sequence which is boiler in
27:12 - here I can jump in and start doing some
27:15 - coding on their own and use my little
27:18 - mill around the room if your parent is
27:20 - they are in volunteering no that's
27:22 - always helpful to listen to start
27:24 - solving puzzles
27:26 - and there are some awesome sobbing and
27:28 - learning about sequence
27:31 - I'm dragging and dropping arrows and
27:33 - putting them into the correct sequence
27:35 - if you're going to be doing a word fast
27:37 - concept then you're probably an
27:40 - experienced co double user and so I
27:43 - would suggest
27:44 - signing in with your class code we I'll
27:47 - show you how to do that real quickly but
27:49 - first if you want them to be able to
27:51 - come back later just copy this student
27:54 - code and they can login with this
27:56 - another day
27:59 - if you want to use your class code do an
28:02 - advanced lesson do your class code
28:09 - [Music]
28:11 - came back co double common
28:14 - [Music]
28:15 - and play with class code
28:18 - i'm going to enter my class code
28:27 - then the students will be able to select
28:29 - their name from this list from the
28:32 - roster that i've imported ahead of time
28:35 - you choose my name and
28:40 - then depending on what lesson they're
28:42 - doing
28:43 - you will have them go to the to the
28:46 - corresponding levels incredible so let's
28:49 - say we wanted to do
28:58 - let's say we wanted to do
29:00 - [Music]
29:02 - conditions with our students which is
29:05 - the first grade advanced concept I would
29:08 - have them log in and go to
29:13 - the section on condition that
29:15 - corresponds with what's on the list
29:16 - early and you can see the corresponding
29:19 - levels
29:21 - you can see the corresponding levels
29:24 - here
29:26 - so we're going to do L loops sorry not
29:30 - conditions it's loops so you're going to
29:31 - do loopy lessons 3.12 3.5 and you'll be
29:35 - able to find that in the game
29:38 - and they'll be able to login I know so
29:42 - with your lessons there you go one
29:44 - through five that's the ones that
29:46 - they're going to be doing and this will
29:48 - take them between 10 to 15 minutes to do
29:51 - all of our lessons are about about 50
29:54 - minutes long which seems to be in a
29:56 - standard for what you know the time that
29:59 - most people have set aside for this
30:03 - so that's how to get started with
30:06 - countable and use co double for the hour
30:09 - of code um but I want to go ahead and
30:14 - jump into you know what to expect the
30:16 - day of um and
30:20 - and you know how you can kind of build
30:23 - excitement around around the hour of
30:26 - code
30:27 - stop
30:34 - so there's some things that you can do
30:36 - to really build excitement on the day of
30:39 - and to know what to expect if this is
30:41 - your first hour of code a lot of people
30:42 - you know have been doing it for a few
30:45 - years but if it's your first time um
30:47 - there's plenty of people around you
30:49 - whether it's on social media or you know
30:52 - angel or you know the local stem a
30:56 - representative who can help you I kind
30:59 - of get started there's a lot of people
31:00 - you can reach out to for advice but I'll
31:03 - just quickly run through some of the
31:04 - things that I see and you know talk
31:07 - about what to expect on the day of um
31:10 - so there's uh there's always the
31:15 - expectation that things need to go
31:17 - perfectly and as an elementary school
31:19 - teacher you know that that things are
31:21 - always going to come up with there's
31:22 - always going to be some transitions and
31:24 - some learning opportunities for every
31:27 - lesson and so the hour of code is no
31:29 - different just because it's different
31:31 - material doesn't mean that you know your
31:33 - lesson needs to be any different um so
31:36 - what you do what to expect is you know
31:40 - to just know that developers do their
31:42 - best to make their sites run effectively
31:45 - and efficiently
31:46 - but you know there's going to be times
31:49 - where it doesn't work or the servers are
31:52 - overloaded and just have a screen free
31:55 - option as a backup I know that that may
31:59 - seem counterintuitive to learning to
32:01 - cook but with elementary school kids
32:03 - it's actually the best way to get
32:04 - started and so that's why all of our
32:06 - lessons can be completed offline the
32:09 - group practice is a big part of learning
32:12 - and is all done offline and unplugged so
32:15 - using any of our lesson plans you'll
32:17 - have a screen free option available if
32:19 - for some reason um you know a sites not
32:21 - working um the other thing to expect is
32:24 - used lots of excitement and joy and
32:26 - learning we have a lot of great student
32:30 - resources um you know to show your kids
32:33 - some videos of
32:34 - other kids talking about why it's fun to
32:37 - learn to code and why it's important and
32:39 - what's some things that they've learned
32:40 - and I'll share that with you in the
32:42 - resources section at the end of the at
32:45 - the end of the webinar but there's also
32:46 - some great resources
32:49 - available through code org they've got
32:53 - some great videos so celebrities talking
32:55 - about why it's important to learn to
32:56 - code to kind of build back type before
32:59 - you get into the lesson and so um I
33:01 - would say to do some of that and then
33:04 - also expect a lot of interest from
33:05 - parents and other teachers don't be
33:07 - afraid to invite others to come into
33:09 - your classroom and just sit and watch
33:11 - inevitably they're going to jump in and
33:13 - they're going to want to be involved and
33:15 - you're going to get their hands dirty
33:16 - with you so you always have a network of
33:18 - people who fall back on if things aren't
33:20 - going exactly that you planned um and
33:23 - then the other thing is to expect to
33:25 - have a lot of questions from kids about
33:28 - things and you know don't use use your
33:31 - normal teaching
33:32 - strategies for answering those questions
33:34 - asked 3 than need you know ask your
33:37 - partner think pair share doing some
33:39 - things to help take the pressure off of
33:41 - you to have all of the answers and work
33:43 - together to problem-solve that's one of
33:44 - the beautiful things about learning to
33:46 - code is it's such a great way to reach
33:48 - out to others and use a community to
33:50 - learn things um and really foster that
33:53 - culture within your classroom so so
33:56 - those are some things to expect
33:59 - I'll go ahead and quickly walk you
34:00 - through how you can get started
34:04 - and get rolling for after the hour of
34:07 - code and the best way to do that is to
34:10 - create a quotable teacher account so
34:13 - that you can log in with a class code
34:15 - and you can have your students saving
34:16 - their progress easily and seamlessly and
34:18 - locking in but you know with the full
34:20 - roster ahead of time so we'll i'll
34:23 - quickly walk you through that and um
34:26 - yeah so but if anybody has any questions
34:29 - feel free to send them my way I'm
34:32 - listening
34:33 - okay so
34:39 - go ahead and share my screen
34:50 - okay now from the hour of code site
34:55 - for more hour of code page you can
35:00 - um get started
35:04 - select teacher
35:09 - you're going to put in your contact
35:11 - information
35:32 - I'm going to be a teaching
35:40 - and it's just going to walk you through
35:42 - you know what we were talking about
35:43 - about how our lessons are structured and
35:46 - you know how you can teach with koda
35:49 - bowl and how r curriculum is set up this
35:52 - is a quick you know tutorial about and
35:55 - direct instruction group practice
35:57 - independent practice walking you through
36:00 - using sequence as the example
36:02 - i'll go ahead and log into my account so
36:05 - you can see what it looks like once
36:07 - you're through all of this
36:36 - um so once you're in here you can see
36:40 - there's videos explaining each concept
36:44 - and then there's
36:46 - you've got a classes and students page
36:49 - and you can actually track your students
36:50 - progress
36:51 - so
36:54 - I'm going to go ahead and show you how
36:56 - to add a class um
36:58 - you just need to set up your class names
37:02 - i'm going to need my room
37:06 - 5g
37:07 - across code you can frisk me anything i
37:10 - suggest it being something that is
37:12 - easier for students to remember like
37:14 - your school mascot or your school street
37:16 - name or their classroom or your last
37:19 - name and something that they're going to
37:21 - be able to easily remember i'm going to
37:24 - just generate one you can also have two
37:25 - one generated for you you can change
37:27 - this at any time if you'd like for time
37:30 - i'm going to go ahead and generate it
37:31 - and
37:32 - then you just add your students so fat
37:47 - you can also copy and paste these up
37:49 - from a spreadsheet if he's like
38:02 - all right so it's already um I'm going
38:06 - to go to my class and I can see all my
38:08 - students um so that's how you go ahead
38:11 - and get your students imported but the
38:13 - real place to go is our courage one page
38:16 - and this is where you're going to find
38:17 - all the lesson plans for getting started
38:19 - with koda bowl
38:21 - and going beyond just the hour of code
38:23 - you know if you're just getting started
38:25 - teaching computer science the hour of
38:26 - code is a great way to do that and our
38:29 - lesson plans make it super simple to get
38:30 - started but I welcome you to explore
38:33 - this over the holiday break and kind of
38:36 - get a feel for some of the things that
38:37 - we offer to go beyond an hour of code we
38:40 - really really make it easy to offer a
38:42 - k25 scaffolded curriculum um to your
38:45 - students into your to your entire school
38:48 - if the hour of code is a success and if
38:51 - you really enjoy it and say how can I
38:53 - get more of this we offer a lot of these
38:56 - lesson plans for free you can try each
39:00 - and every one of our concepts with your
39:03 - students so you can see you know
39:05 - object-oriented programming with your
39:07 - upper elementary and you can get into
39:09 - some sequencing and conditions with your
39:12 - kindergarteners and first graders I'll
39:15 - show you one of those just say in an
39:17 - idea of what it looks like you can see
39:18 - it looks really similar to our hour of
39:20 - code lesson plans completely scripted
39:22 - guided practice independent practice um
39:25 - you know really getting the kids
39:27 - thinking offline and online and then
39:31 - each of these units offers an overview
39:34 - and explanation of the concepts so if
39:36 - you're thinking how am I going to teach
39:37 - about computer science if I don't know
39:38 - what it is um three has done a fantastic
39:41 - job of breaking it down each concept so
39:45 - that you can jump in feeling prepared
39:47 - I'm explaining what this concept is how
39:50 - it relates programming in a short quick
39:51 - video and then also with examples down
39:54 - below
39:56 - them so you can never you know you never
39:58 - have to feel like you don't know what
40:00 - you're teaching each each of these is is
40:03 - really easy to get through and so that
40:07 - is what I would suggest doing if you
40:09 - decide you want to go beyond an hour of
40:11 - code go ahead and get started set up
40:13 - your class you don't have to use it for
40:15 - the hour of code but you know it will be
40:17 - helpful for getting students signed in
40:19 - if you decide to UM
40:21 - and let me just check and see if we've
40:24 - got any questions
40:30 - let's see here
40:40 - doesn't
40:42 - look like we've got any questions
40:45 - so that is
40:48 - it um if anybody has any questions you
40:52 - can always reach out to me Gretchen at
40:56 - quotable com write my name and chat
41:02 - where you can reach out to Angel she's
41:04 - super helpful she's you know a great
41:08 - resource and she'll be able to point you
41:10 - in the right direction for how to get
41:12 - help locally in Iowa and I really am
41:16 - excited for you guys to get started with
41:17 - the our code if you have you know um
41:20 - some exciting stories during that week
41:23 - feel free to tweet them at us or share
41:25 - them with us we love hearing from
41:27 - teachers especially that week um so yeah
41:30 - alright everybody thank you so much and
41:33 - have a happy Thanksgiving
