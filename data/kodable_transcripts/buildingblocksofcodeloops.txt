00:01 - hey i'm gretchen and in this video we're
00:03 - going to go over loops
00:05 - another building block in learning to
00:06 - code first we're going to go to smeeborg
00:10 - and then loopy lessons
00:14 - loops allow you to repeat commands a set
00:16 - number of times
00:18 - so if you were programming something to
00:19 - deal cards first you would define what
00:22 - it meant to deal a card
00:23 - then you would tell it to repeat that
00:25 - command as many times as you wanted to
00:27 - deal
00:28 - cards so if you wanted to deal five
00:30 - cards you would say deal card
00:32 - and then have it repeat five times
00:37 - that's how loops work in codable so we
00:40 - tell it what commands we want to repeat
00:43 - and then
00:44 - we tell it how many times we want to
00:46 - repeat them so i'm going to show you how
00:47 - that works
00:49 - in this maze first we're going to go
00:51 - forward
00:52 - and then we're going to use the looper
00:55 - we want to go up
00:57 - and then to the right and we need to
00:59 - repeat that
01:01 - two times so we're just gonna tap two
01:05 - and then hit play and you can see
01:09 - we were able to solve this maze using
01:12 - only two command bins
01:15 - loops allow your code to be more
01:16 - efficient
01:19 - and that's loops if you have any
01:21 - questions you can check the codeable
01:22 - learning guide
01:25 - thanks
