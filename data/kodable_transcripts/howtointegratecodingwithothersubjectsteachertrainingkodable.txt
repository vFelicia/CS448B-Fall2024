00:15 - all right so we're on to our last
00:16 - section this is how to integrate coding
00:18 - with other subjects
00:20 - and if you're a teacher who has been
00:22 - tasked with starting a coding program at
00:25 - your school but you also
00:26 - teach other subjects i understand
00:30 - why this might feel like a huge task
00:33 - you're already teaching a ton of
00:35 - subjects and now you have to teach code
00:37 - which
00:37 - might be something you're not as
00:39 - familiar with and
00:41 - i want to go over this section of the
00:44 - presentation because it's a lot easier
00:45 - than you might think
00:48 - the field of computer science is already
00:49 - totally integrated with math science
00:52 - english a lot of these core concepts
00:54 - from
00:55 - math science and english also our core
00:58 - content
00:58 - in computer science so the connection
01:01 - exists already
01:02 - you are not responsible for finding the
01:04 - connection and forcing them yourself
01:06 - you just need to find the right
01:08 - resources that can do it
01:09 - for you or that can help you and that's
01:11 - what i'm hoping to share with you now
01:13 - so like i said coding integration works
01:16 - and is really intuitive because
01:17 - the field of computer science is
01:19 - naturally integrated without any work
01:21 - from you
01:22 - that said there are ways to provide
01:25 - students with a little bit more
01:27 - i guess i would call it structured
01:28 - integration to help them
01:31 - see those connections that already exist
01:33 - or in other words make those connections
01:35 - more visible
01:36 - my recommendation if you are just
01:38 - starting out with coding is to
01:40 - use coding as a project-based way to
01:44 - apply
01:45 - other subject knowledge so
01:48 - teaching math for example and also
01:50 - teaching code
01:51 - both subjects might feel overwhelming my
01:54 - recommendation is to not get caught up
01:56 - thinking that you need to teach both
01:58 - concepts separately
02:00 - but rather reframe it for students and
02:03 - show them how
02:04 - you can use code to explore math
02:08 - so i'll give an example let's say you
02:10 - teach a math lesson and you're talking
02:11 - about
02:13 - different shapes and you've like talked
02:15 - about the shapes and you do your little
02:16 - lesson on the shapes
02:18 - you can use coding as a project-based
02:20 - application of
02:23 - the math concepts of shapes so in that
02:27 - the green coding mission number three
02:29 - thumbnail that you see on the screen
02:30 - here that's a thumbnail from a video
02:32 - that we created
02:33 - where students create shapes
02:37 - using a coding program encodable
02:40 - and so that's a good example of how you
02:42 - could teach a math lesson and then do a
02:44 - coding
02:44 - project you're not necessarily teaching
02:48 - the coding you know what sequence and
02:50 - conditions are
02:51 - but kids are getting familiar with code
02:54 - they're seeing how
02:55 - coding can be used as a tool to explore
02:57 - other subjects
02:59 - further so that's one way that
03:01 - integration
03:02 - can be really effective especially when
03:04 - you're starting out
03:05 - do not feel like you need to teach
03:07 - completely different lessons for coding
03:09 - and completely different lessons for
03:10 - your other subjects they can be
03:13 - taught and they can emphasize each other
03:15 - you can teach them at the same time
03:17 - so other thumbnails that you see here
03:19 - these are all examples of coding
03:20 - missions that's a
03:22 - a creative project-based challenges that
03:25 - we pose at codable
03:26 - and we're really big on integration you
03:29 - can find a lot of these videos on our
03:31 - videos page
03:32 - perhaps brie could drop that in the chat
03:34 - for you guys so you can take a look
03:36 - but examples might be in that upper left
03:38 - hand corner is an integration between
03:40 - coding and art
03:42 - next the storytelling with conditions
03:43 - that integrates coding and ela
03:46 - in the lower left we have coding and
03:48 - physical education
03:50 - so that's an option and then the two
03:54 - smaller frames that you see here those
03:56 - are snapshots of worksheets
03:58 - that have to do with halloween and
04:01 - thanksgiving
04:02 - which is a good segue to the second type
04:04 - of integration that i recommend
04:06 - which is holiday celebrations so
04:10 - this is another easy way to bring coding
04:12 - into your classroom that is lower lift
04:14 - and holidays in school there's sometimes
04:17 - a really fun
04:18 - opportunity to do something special for
04:20 - a day a special project
04:22 - and i would say that if you're
04:24 - interested in starting coding but you're
04:26 - not really sure where to fit it into
04:27 - your schedule
04:29 - doing a coding project that is related
04:31 - to a holiday is a really
04:33 - great way to do a first step you know at
04:36 - that time your students are in the
04:37 - holiday spirit
04:38 - you are too you're ready to try
04:39 - something new so it's it's a good option
04:42 - at codable we have a ton of video
04:43 - lessons and activities for most of the
04:45 - major holidays and
04:46 - examples on this screen include
04:48 - halloween pie day
04:49 - valentine's day and earth day
04:52 - and you can see too that pi day and
04:55 - earth day videos those are both also
04:56 - going to be really good subject
04:58 - integrations for math and science
05:00 - so again holidays might be a good chance
05:03 - for you to feel out
05:04 - integration see how it goes and based on
05:07 - how it goes you can make a plan to to do
05:10 - some more in-depth
05:14 - integration
