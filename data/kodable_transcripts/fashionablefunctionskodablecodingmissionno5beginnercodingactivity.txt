00:01 - let's go your coding mission today is
00:03 - all about functions
00:05 - a function is a block of code made up of
00:07 - a set of steps that result in a single
00:10 - specific action a programmer that's you
00:13 - will give this action a simple name so
00:16 - the set of steps can be easily repeated
00:18 - and reused again and again in your
00:20 - program
00:21 - you use functions when you get ready in
00:23 - the morning think about the tasks in
00:25 - your morning routine
00:27 - maybe you take a shower get dressed eat
00:30 - breakfast brush your teeth
00:33 - all of these actions are made up of a
00:35 - sequence of smaller tasks
00:37 - for example there are multiple things
00:40 - you do when you get dressed like choose
00:42 - your outfit underwear clothes outerwear
00:46 - accessories shoes
00:48 - since you probably go through these
00:50 - steps in the same order every day it's
00:53 - easier just to think of them all
00:55 - together as one action with one name
00:57 - like get dressed the same is true for
01:00 - the rest of your morning tasks
01:02 - when you take a set of steps that you
01:04 - use a lot and give it a simple name you
01:08 - are creating and using a function
01:12 - here's your mission write out the get
01:14 - dressed function that describes your
01:16 - morning routine
01:18 - then build a fuzz encodable and create a
01:21 - get dressed function with the same
01:22 - number of steps as yours
01:25 - let's take a deeper look at how a
01:27 - programmer creates and uses a function
01:31 - step one define the function this means
01:34 - deciding what sequence of steps you want
01:37 - to happen each time the function is used
01:40 - take a moment to think about the steps
01:42 - you follow when you get dressed in the
01:43 - morning
01:44 - what clothes do you put on first how
01:47 - many items do you wear do you put on any
01:50 - accessories like hats necklaces or
01:52 - glasses
01:53 - write out at least five steps
01:56 - you can pause the video here to finish
01:58 - writing
02:01 - step two use the function
02:04 - in code this means calling the function
02:06 - by simply typing out its name get
02:09 - dressed
02:10 - in your everyday life
02:12 - calling the function just happens inside
02:14 - your head when you decide okay it's time
02:17 - to get dressed
02:19 - did you know the codable fuzzes use this
02:21 - function too
02:23 - only the sequence of steps in the get
02:25 - dressed function for a fuzz won't be the
02:27 - same as yours
02:29 - your mission today is to build a fuzz
02:31 - and define the steps for its get dressed
02:34 - function just like you did for your own
02:36 - get creative there are tons of different
02:39 - items and accessories to choose from
02:43 - let's walk through this together in
02:45 - codable's fuzz builder
02:48 - click the build button and give your new
02:50 - fuzz a name
02:52 - now notice how there are two functions
02:54 - already in our code
02:56 - remember a function is a block of code
02:58 - that results in a specific action
03:01 - i can see the first action is to set up
03:04 - fuzz
03:05 - and the second action is to get dressed
03:08 - first i will code the steps in the setup
03:11 - fuzz function by choosing a body
03:15 - eyes
03:17 - [Music]
03:19 - and a mouth
03:22 - now it's time to write the get dressed
03:24 - function
03:25 - take a look back at the number of steps
03:27 - in the function you just wrote for
03:29 - yourself
03:30 - then select the same number of items and
03:33 - hats as you build your fuzz
03:36 - so if i added five steps to my function
03:39 - i will add five items or hats to my
03:42 - fuzzes as well
03:44 - remember the steps inside a function
03:46 - will always run in sequence so the item
03:49 - in your first line of code will be added
03:51 - to the fuzz first
03:53 - if you don't like the way some of the
03:55 - costume items look like this beard
03:57 - covering the wand try changing up the
04:00 - sequence
04:05 - much better
04:06 - once you've completed the get dressed
04:08 - function and coded the rest of your fuzz
04:10 - you can use this new fuzz as your
04:12 - character in the game
04:14 - switch between all the fuzzes you build
04:16 - to give them each a spin around the
04:18 - universe
04:20 - now it's your turn
04:22 - write out the get dressed function that
04:24 - describes your morning routine
04:26 - build a fuzz encodable and create a get
04:28 - dressed function with the same number of
04:30 - steps as yours
04:32 - good luck
