00:18 - how to ask questions and get ideas from
00:20 - other teachers
00:22 - before i begin i realized i don't have a
00:24 - slide for this but i did want to mention
00:25 - it
00:27 - if there's a coding or a stem program
00:28 - that you're curious about
00:30 - like codable or scratch
00:33 - and before you start you you would love
00:36 - to talk to a teacher who's already using
00:38 - it just to see how they're doing it
00:39 - and to learn a little bit more about the
00:41 - practical application
00:44 - i would recommend reaching out to
00:47 - somebody on that team somebody who works
00:49 - on the product like a customer service
00:51 - rep or somebody at the company
00:53 - i can speak from codables experience we
00:55 - have teachers all over the world using
00:57 - codable in
00:58 - a wide variety of educational
01:00 - environments and we would love
01:02 - to connect you with a teacher who is
01:04 - also
01:05 - using that also using codable or
01:07 - whatever program
01:09 - in a similar way to offer insights or to
01:11 - answer questions since
01:14 - they would be able to know some of the
01:15 - ins and outs better than we would since
01:17 - they have a similar teaching experience
01:19 - so that's just one thing i wanted to
01:20 - mention
01:21 - if you have specific questions about a
01:23 - program see if
01:24 - they can't connect you with a teacher
01:26 - who is also using that program i think
01:28 - it's a really nice way to learn
01:31 - okay so two ways to get involved and to
01:34 - get some of your questions answered are
01:36 - webinars and conferences
01:37 - these are two webinars that we love but
01:39 - there are a ton out there
01:41 - that one on the bottom that's computer
01:42 - science for rhode island those are not
01:44 - just rhode island
01:45 - themed webinars they just have a nice
01:47 - section on their website that
01:50 - maps out some free webinars that are
01:51 - coming up that you might be interested
01:54 - in signing up for and then as i
01:56 - mentioned at the beginning
01:57 - we have a couple webinars through
01:59 - codable
02:00 - happening next week on tuesday and then
02:02 - again in october and hopefully we can
02:04 - offer
02:04 - um a lot more in the future as well and
02:07 - then
02:08 - conferences are an option they're a
02:09 - little bit more intensive because you
02:11 - are
02:12 - putting time aside to attend sometimes
02:14 - there is cost involved
02:15 - but it is a great place to meet with
02:18 - like-minded teachers and admin and
02:19 - learn about programs that you didn't
02:22 - even know existed
02:23 - so those are two options to start and
02:26 - then
02:28 - social media is really alive with stem
02:30 - and coding communities they're super
02:32 - active
02:33 - and these are two on facebook that we
02:35 - that we love and then a couple of our
02:37 - favorite instagram influencers stem
02:40 - influencers
02:41 - i mean they're a great place to get
02:42 - ideas like project ideas or classroom
02:45 - ideas and i know that many are really
02:47 - willing
02:48 - to connect and chat i mean they are
02:49 - teachers and parents
02:51 - just like you so that's one other place
02:53 - to go for
02:55 - for quick inspiration if you are
02:56 - interested in learning more about
02:58 - what coding might look like in different
03:01 - classrooms and actually see real
03:02 - pictures and videos from
03:04 - their work
