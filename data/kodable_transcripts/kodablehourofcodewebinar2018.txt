00:01 - okay hi everyone welcome my name is
00:06 - Gretchen Heber I'm one of the founders
00:08 - of codable I'm brie gray our head of
00:11 - curriculum and we are so excited to talk
00:15 - with you guys today about the hour of
00:17 - code I don't know how many of you I'm
00:21 - sure for some of you this is your
00:22 - veterans at this point this is probably
00:24 - your fourth or fifth year doing the hour
00:27 - of code and um you probably could leave
00:30 - one of these yourselves but for some of
00:33 - you this might be your first hour of
00:35 - code so we'll just start from the
00:36 - beginning what is it why is it important
00:38 - why is it so cool why is it worth doing
00:40 - so the Arth code is a big international
00:46 - event put on by code org and Computer
00:51 - Science Education Week to just promote
00:53 - computer science education to get with
00:56 - the goal of getting every kid to try one
00:59 - hour of coding and one of the side
01:03 - effects of this is that so many schools
01:05 - have started to realize just how
01:07 - exciting it can be for them how much
01:10 - engagement they can get how important it
01:12 - is for their students to start thinking
01:14 - critically and start using their brains
01:17 - to solve real-world problems so it's
01:20 - pretty cool it's really exciting and if
01:22 - this is your first time get ready it's
01:25 - so much fun I'm really excited for you
01:28 - so we are gonna just run through a few
01:33 - things we're gonna go over a couple
01:37 - different ways that you can play codable
01:40 - this our code if you're using google for
01:43 - the hour of code we'll talk a little bit
01:44 - about how you should prepare what you
01:47 - should prepare for with codable like
01:49 - setting up your account things like that
01:51 - but also how you can prepare your
01:53 - classroom talking to students talking to
01:55 - other staff members what you can do to
01:58 - kind of get the whole community ready
02:00 - and then we'll go into the specific
02:04 - activities that we've added for this
02:06 - year we're really excited this year's
02:09 - theme is creativity
02:11 - so we have some really cool exciting new
02:15 - activities they're promoting creativity
02:18 - and design thinking and therefore all
02:21 - ages well K to five and we'll show you
02:27 - some of those then we will go over some
02:32 - of the lesson plans that we have from
02:34 - previous years if you decide you want to
02:36 - do a little bit more structured on a
02:37 - program you can do that and then we'll
02:41 - get into questions I know a lot of you
02:45 - submitted questions when you RSVP'd
02:47 - thank you I compiled all of them into a
02:50 - shortlist and I put it in the Google
02:53 - Google Doc that I posted in the chaps on
02:57 - the side of the window the video feel
03:00 - free to submit to like something pops up
03:02 - and you have another question feel free
03:04 - to write it in there where we have it
03:06 - right here so we can see
03:08 - so we'll be pausing every now and then
03:10 - to answer questions and then we have
03:12 - time at the end for more questions as
03:15 - well so we will be sure to answer all
03:18 - your questions and we're so excited so
03:21 - let's get started um so the first thing
03:24 - to note about doing yard code is all the
03:29 - different ways that you can participate
03:31 - so there are what's called unplucked
03:35 - activities that take place offline
03:38 - usually with a worksheet or some sort of
03:40 - game that you do with your students and
03:42 - then there's online activities but
03:44 - codable specifically has three different
03:46 - ways um we have our free to play online
03:52 - hour of code site that game codable
03:56 - calms a shower of code and it's really
03:59 - great if you want to just kind of set
04:01 - your kids up and you you know don't
04:04 - really plan on doing any sort of
04:06 - introduction or instruction and you just
04:08 - want them to do free play you can do
04:10 - that I'll get into how you do that in a
04:13 - second another option is our structured
04:16 - hour of code activities and you can
04:20 - choose to do we have lessons that go
04:22 - along with them if you choose to do that
04:23 - briefs and talk about that in a minute
04:25 - but again you can just set the students
04:28 - up it has a video it has a prompt for
04:30 - both they're guided challenges and then
04:33 - they're creative challenge and then if
04:36 - you decide you want to do sort of
04:38 - combination of all these things we have
04:40 - structured lessons which have an
04:42 - unplugged component all of them do where
04:45 - the kids are practicing coding concept
04:48 - offline together as a class that's a lot
04:50 - of fun or and and then you can go online
04:54 - in to codable it so any of the
04:57 - activities that we have available and
04:58 - play there you can also download
05:01 - quotable from the app store we just
05:04 - released a brand new hour of code update
05:07 - so if you haven't updated your iPads
05:09 - when you're playing on using iPads need
05:10 - to get that update it's gonna have all
05:12 - of these activities in it so yeah um I
05:16 - guess from there I'll go ahead and show
05:19 - go ahead and show that yeah okay yeah
05:22 - okay just one Christmas doing I just I
05:28 - see a few people say there may be some
05:29 - audio issues it seems as though somebody
05:32 - can hear us so if you can't maybe check
05:35 - the settings on the device you're
05:36 - watching it seems like it's fine for
05:39 - some people so just check your settings
05:40 - yeah sometimes if you're watching in
05:43 - Chrome it needs to be shut down and
05:45 - restarted okay so um if you are going to
05:58 - have your kids just start up with color
06:01 - Bowl and play and you don't want to set
06:04 - up an account a codable account that's
06:06 - totally fine I think probably most of
06:08 - you have codable accounts but if you
06:10 - don't that's totally fine too
06:13 - you're just gonna go to game codable
06:15 - calm this is probably the link that you
06:17 - want to share with your students or
06:19 - you're gonna open up coda bolt in the
06:21 - app on your iPad and just click Play
06:25 - without saving um you're gonna select
06:28 - playing at school and this will create
06:33 - an anonymous profile for your students
06:35 - to play
06:36 - they will not be able to save their
06:38 - progress unless you create an account so
06:42 - this login and save is gonna prompt you
06:45 - to set up an account but from here these
06:49 - are all of our hour of code activities
06:51 - that the students can complete if you
06:54 - want them to just go free play and
06:56 - explore you can hit explore and this
07:00 - will take them off into global and from
07:03 - here there's different activities that
07:04 - they can that they can play there's me
07:06 - Borg Australia book world you can get
07:09 - more into that later but that's how you
07:11 - set up free play um and if you decide
07:17 - you want to do the structured activities
07:19 - we'll get into that in a second but
07:22 - first let's go through this as if you
07:24 - have an account because I think a lot of
07:27 - you are going to have accounts that
07:29 - you're using with classes set up for
07:32 - your students so we'll go as if we're
07:35 - playing that yeah and I think one point
07:37 - to mention here is if you plan on
07:38 - continuing with codable beyond here
07:40 - could this is a great a great option to
07:43 - set up an account I think a lot of
07:44 - students will be bummed if their
07:46 - progress is not saved so if you know
07:48 - it's something you're going to be doing
07:50 - continuing with our free trial after
07:52 - this week or after you did the art of
07:54 - code I'd definitely set up that account
07:56 - so your kids will have their progress
07:58 - saved from the hour of code definitely
08:00 - and there's some other cool things like
08:02 - you can check their progress
08:03 - you can send home their create their
08:06 - creations so you can actually print it
08:09 - out and send it home with them it's got
08:10 - the code that they've written their
08:12 - characters that they created and
08:14 - different things so you'll also get
08:16 - certificates with their names already
08:18 - printed on them um will show you where
08:22 - you can download just a generic
08:23 - certificate break and write in their
08:26 - names if you don't have an account but
08:27 - if you do have one it's nice because you
08:29 - don't have to go and write all their
08:31 - names out so um okay let's go ahead and
08:35 - see as if we have an account setup
08:39 - um so actually we'll talk a little bit
08:43 - about how do you get set
08:45 - so if you decide to set up an account
08:47 - the things that you're gonna want to
08:49 - have prepared for the hour of code are
08:52 - to create an account and set up your
08:55 - classes it takes minutes it's very quick
09:00 - this is what your dashboard looks like
09:04 - you can go through this quick wizard you
09:07 - just create a class name I'm going to
09:18 - say this is a first grade class and you
09:27 - just add your name your students names
09:29 - um you can actually copy and paste from
09:33 - a roster if you have a digital roster
09:35 - there's also other ways that you can
09:37 - import students using Google classroom
09:38 - and clever you have that and then this
09:45 - is the most important part you're gonna
09:47 - want to set up a class code so this is
09:50 - something that your students will use to
09:53 - log in and actually pick their name from
09:56 - the roster so you want to make it
09:58 - something kind of memorable or you can
10:00 - choose from one of the options that we
10:03 - have here but from for myself I'm just
10:05 - gonna say quotables
10:08 - power of code that's probably long
10:16 - enough okay save and continue
10:34 - so what you're gonna do is use this link
10:37 - to get your students logged in to
10:41 - codable so this actually is a unique URL
10:43 - click it okay can you tell my students
10:58 - okay yeah so you can copy this link and
11:04 - save it to either your class dashboard
11:09 - or your class website or if you just
11:11 - want to post this somewhere for your
11:13 - students to get to if you are using
11:16 - includable on the iPad you're just gonna
11:18 - use that the class code that we created
11:22 - so your students will be prompted to
11:24 - enter that class code it'll download
11:26 - this roster they'll never actually have
11:29 - to enter it again it's just that one
11:30 - time and then they select their name and
11:38 - we're in and here your you can see the
11:42 - hour of code activities you can
11:45 - encourage them to do any of these that
11:46 - are great appropriate if you decide
11:50 - you're going to be using any of the
11:52 - lesson plans another thing to do to
11:54 - prepare is to maybe print that lesson
11:57 - plan that you're gonna be using and
11:59 - we'll get into it the lesson plans here
12:01 - in a second so once you have a codable
12:06 - set up like you just saw it's really
12:09 - simple there's a few things that you
12:12 - might want to do to prepare your class
12:17 - so your students and your your school
12:20 - community for the hour of code if you
12:24 - are the only teacher in your school
12:26 - doing it cool awesome way to go good for
12:29 - you a lot of you asked about how to
12:31 - invite others to get involved and
12:35 - participate and that's amazing way to go
12:36 - I think that one of the best ways to do
12:39 - that is to just invite them to your
12:41 - or one of your lessons one of your hour
12:44 - of code lessons let them just observe
12:46 - let them be maybe your assistant if
12:49 - there's questions or just kind of mill
12:51 - around the room and by administrators
12:54 - invite other teachers invite parents
12:58 - even parents to really get a kick out of
12:59 - this
13:01 - don't be afraid to invite and kind of
13:03 - invite people and kind of make it a
13:04 - party because it should be a lot of fun
13:07 - the other thing to do is to set up
13:10 - classroom expectations for your students
13:13 - if you feel like this is needed it's you
13:15 - know you've done you've already done
13:16 - this in this lawyer you might not need
13:18 - to but I like to always encourage
13:20 - students to ask three and then me so
13:23 - that you're not inundated with questions
13:24 - because it is a time for exploration
13:28 - problem solving you know really thinking
13:31 - through difficult puzzles basically and
13:35 - I'm using all of our logic skills and
13:36 - our and our problem solving skills so
13:38 - encourage kids to work with a partner to
13:42 - solve problems before they come running
13:45 - to you for answers because you might not
13:46 - know that's the thing and one thing to
13:49 - that I sad that Gretchen I have
13:51 - experienced and our time going into
13:53 - classrooms is definitely introducing the
13:56 - tutorials for each of the activities as
13:58 - a full group first
13:59 - so each activity is meant for students
14:02 - relative to on their own there will be a
14:04 - tutorial that walks them through
14:05 - sometimes there's a video but especially
14:08 - with younger kids sometimes there can be
14:09 - you know an issue with someone's
14:10 - headphones they can't hear the video or
14:12 - they clicked off the tutorial they
14:14 - didn't actually see it so I think even
14:17 - before they get onto their devices maybe
14:19 - just going through that introduction as
14:20 - a whole group and then if they you know
14:23 - see it for a second time on their own
14:24 - that's fine too but just setting it up
14:26 - so everyone knows what the activity is
14:28 - and kind of how to get started and kind
14:31 - of make that transition a little easier
14:32 - once they get on to their own device
14:34 - definitely definitely
14:36 - um the last thing to do to sort prepare
14:39 - yourself for this is have a back-up plan
14:42 - most of the sites the activity partners
14:46 - are going to have their highest traffic
14:49 - of the year on their web sites so there
14:52 - might be some
14:53 - connectivity issues you're gonna have a
14:55 - lot of students accessing your Wi-Fi
14:59 - network in your school at the same time
15:03 - and that might cause some some traffic
15:05 - issues so just have a back-up plan
15:07 - making an unplugged option like I said
15:10 - we're going to get into some of those in
15:12 - a minute but just have that in case you
15:14 - have you know a few minutes where
15:16 - there's loading issues or you know
15:19 - everybody needs to refresh or whatever
15:21 - um have that as a backup just in case I
15:25 - just like to to let people know that
15:26 - that's available if they need it but if
15:30 - you're using codable or in the ipad you
15:32 - shouldn't have any problems because it
15:33 - can work offline so if for any reason
15:36 - that leaves this connection whenever it
15:39 - regains that connection that will send
15:41 - all their progress to us anyway so that
15:44 - it'll be there the next time they log in
15:46 - um yeah the other thing is if you do
15:50 - have issues feel free to email us
15:53 - anytime our whole team is getting we're
15:55 - on high alert this whole week so support
15:59 - equitable net home goes to all of us and
16:01 - we'll be quick to respond throughout the
16:05 - week so okay I think now we can get into
16:10 - the activities excellent today awesome
16:13 - I'm so excited um we worked really hard
16:16 - on these and I hope that you guys enjoy
16:19 - them so I'll go through these by age I'm
16:28 - starting with k22 which actually brings
16:32 - me to a lot of a lot of the questions
16:35 - were concerning how to teach preschool
16:39 - or kindergarten or first grade students
16:42 - and codable we started our company with
16:48 - five year olds in mind we actually
16:51 - worked our way up from that so it's very
16:56 - well-suited for a kindergarten student I
16:59 - think that once you take a look at some
17:02 - of these activities and also take a look
17:05 - some of the lesson plans you'll find
17:07 - that it's very simple for them to get
17:10 - started especially if you're using iPads
17:15 - I definitely recommend tablets for free
17:19 - young students just because some motor
17:21 - skills of using a mouse over like a
17:24 - trackpad is really difficult but um if
17:27 - you have iPads in and use a class code
17:29 - and you have that class set up for them
17:31 - whenever they get to your room then it's
17:35 - really simple they just sign their name
17:37 - and then they can start so it's a really
17:40 - quick process to get them logged in and
17:42 - then after that it's basically go and
17:44 - then they're there often and going so um
17:47 - we'll start with them I just want to add
17:50 - something really quickly um you can
17:52 - control the sound on each of your
17:54 - devices but typically you know I would
17:57 - say teachers and Pharaon students at the
17:58 - same time I usually tell teachers to
18:00 - turn the music off but in these tutorial
18:03 - cases it's actually different because we
18:04 - do have videos in construction so if you
18:07 - have headphones or you know that you
18:09 - know you have some way of managing
18:10 - students watching things and listening
18:12 - to things at the same time that's
18:14 - definitely something to be prepared for
18:15 - when you get into this that's a very
18:18 - good point definitely okay so um for the
18:25 - meze maker challenge some of you may
18:27 - have seen this last year we've actually
18:29 - updated it a little bit but some of the
18:33 - challenges are similar but I think that
18:36 - yeah and it's a similar concept in terms
18:39 - of what students are doing the unplugged
18:42 - version is the same so it's just giving
18:44 - them a structured way to get introduced
18:46 - to this um but yeah scratching the
18:49 - saying it's a little different on the
18:50 - screen this year yes and so what you're
18:52 - gonna want to do is have them select
18:54 - their grade if it's their first exposure
18:57 - to codable you might want to have them
19:00 - like if they're in second grade you
19:02 - might want to have them try the first
19:03 - grade option before jumping to second
19:06 - grade just if it's their first time
19:08 - using codable because it does get into
19:10 - conditions in the second grade tutorial
19:13 - which is a more advanced concept some
19:16 - students might struggle with it a little
19:18 - bit so you might want to start them with
19:20 - first grade and then as a reward they
19:22 - can move on to the second grade option
19:23 - or they can move on to the build your
19:24 - own flaws if they if they finished
19:26 - shortly but I don't we didn't have that
19:28 - in any other classes really that we went
19:31 - to um
19:33 - so I'm gonna go through so they're gonna
19:37 - see um five levels to complete and they
19:44 - can go through these five levels it's
19:46 - gonna be a variety of codable mazes that
19:51 - they have to solve each one is slightly
19:56 - different or some of them are hard or
19:58 - some of them are easier so we tried to
20:00 - make it a nice balance then once they've
20:02 - completed these four levels this button
20:06 - will turn green start my creative
20:08 - challenge they can click that and
20:09 - they'll see the prompt to make some kind
20:13 - of a geometric shape in the maze maker
20:16 - challenge um so that's that one I'm
20:22 - actually gonna go to these makers you
20:24 - can guys you can see what it actually
20:28 - looks like for those of you now the
20:32 - great thing about the maze maker is it
20:34 - leaves room for so much creativity but
20:37 - especially with K through two students
20:38 - obviously they need some kind of
20:40 - structure so as Gretchen's going to show
20:42 - you with our newsmaker it's kind of a
20:44 - blank canvas um so giving them some kind
20:46 - of challenge is really what we're aiming
20:49 - for to get their creative you know ideas
20:51 - flowing and then beyond this they'll be
20:53 - able to create nearly anything that they
20:55 - want this we have words yeah numbers
20:58 - letters things like that um but it is
21:01 - definitely an abstract kind of blank
21:04 - canvas of their starting with so it'll
21:07 - give them a prompt this has create you
21:09 - know a shape I think for the first grade
21:12 - one it's make a square and they just
21:17 - start by drawing and they can do any
21:21 - kind of square they want it does not
21:23 - need to be a perfect square what I mean
21:26 - square is perfect square but it doesn't
21:29 - need to look just like this like they
21:30 - can do those
21:31 - big squares however they feel we added
21:34 - new maze decorations this year for the
21:39 - maze maker challenge it's pretty neat so
21:42 - they can play around the 'those we've
21:44 - got some little gnomes that are adorable
21:46 - got some worms got some rocks we've got
21:52 - some pools and then they just place them
21:57 - their stars wherever they want them to
21:59 - go and we should point out here that the
22:01 - maze must be solvable for them to be
22:04 - able to save it so placing the stars
22:06 - they need to put them in areas where
22:07 - they're going to get them when they test
22:09 - and solve their means right so then they
22:12 - have to actually try their maze and
22:16 - solve it and then once they're amazed is
22:25 - solved it will save and if you are using
22:32 - the codable class if you've set up a
22:35 - class ahead of time it'll actually share
22:37 - it with the entire class so the whole
22:40 - class will be able to view mazes that
22:43 - you can see here some mazes that were
22:44 - created by my class I've got a lot of
22:47 - them this is great because students can
22:49 - create music for each other you can
22:52 - create mazes for your students to do you
22:54 - can pick a student and say you know
22:56 - everyone's going to do Katniss every
22:58 - beans maze today it's really a good way
23:00 - to collaborate you can have kids
23:02 - sharing their work with each other yeah
23:06 - so that's main maker um and I will go
23:12 - back to UM bilder fest did you want to
23:14 - go over the lesson for this one um yeah
23:17 - so the newsmaker challenge lesson is the
23:21 - same as it was last year so as Gretchen
23:23 - was mentioning it will prompt students
23:25 - to make a shape and so we did this last
23:27 - year with K through 5 so in our lesson
23:30 - plan we actually have Common Core math
23:33 - standards aligned so each grade level
23:35 - and you know if you want to do this with
23:37 - 3rd 4th and 5th bits in a lesson plan
23:39 - it's prompted to do some kind of math
23:41 - activity based on there
23:43 - or standards yep so to view that lesson
23:46 - plan you're just gonna go to Kalitta
23:48 - Bolcom slash hour of code you can see
23:51 - all of these activities here if you use
23:54 - this button the play on one button it's
23:56 - gonna take you directly to the mate to
23:58 - the maze maker activity same for builder
24:00 - and fuzz and the game maker if you click
24:05 - view lesson plan this is where you can
24:08 - see the lesson so you can see the
24:15 - objectives how to access maze maker and
24:18 - that's outside of the hour of code
24:20 - activity how you would access it if you
24:23 - weren't in the area of code and then yet
24:26 - all of the maze major prompts yeah so
24:30 - and then you have the list of materials
24:32 - that you can download okay then we'll go
24:37 - ahead and get into build round fuzz and
24:41 - just demonstrate this I'll go ahead and
24:43 - click on this button I'm gonna play
24:46 - while saving all right so now you see
24:55 - like it's pointing at the one that I
24:57 - want to click on which is really nice if
24:59 - you're if you're why don't you make it
25:01 - easy for yourself okay
25:04 - so I'm gonna click build buzzes this one
25:07 - works a little bit different from the
25:08 - maze maker we start with a creative
25:11 - challenge so this is where students will
25:13 - actually fill the character and I can
25:18 - show you how that works so every student
25:24 - will get this video it's a little prompt
25:26 - about building a character and thinking
25:30 - about the fuzz is thinking about a
25:32 - character from the story that they like
25:34 - what characteristics make make them who
25:39 - they are and then using that as
25:41 - inspiration to create their own
25:43 - character so once they watch that um
25:47 - they can enter their buzzes name
25:57 - [Music]
25:59 - you're going to drive over all of the
26:04 - characteristics for their character and
26:07 - then they can actually edit all of these
26:12 - these properties of their character so
26:15 - if I want to change the smile I'm gonna
26:20 - have my fuzz stick their tongue out can
26:23 - do that if I want to change their eye
26:24 - color
26:25 - I can make their ends red and then say I
26:32 - want to change the color the body that
26:36 - so this is all JavaScript here so this
26:40 - is a little bit more of an advanced
26:43 - advanced tutorial it's first second
26:45 - grade and up we definitely recommend
26:50 - using it with students that age and
26:52 - maybe not younger just because they need
26:55 - to be able to read that you know they're
26:58 - gonna be editing at the body the eyes
27:00 - the mouth they're gonna be changing the
27:02 - properties of that it can't be done with
27:06 - younger students but I would stick with
27:08 - me as maker if it were me and then you
27:11 - can add accessories to your fuzz so I'm
27:13 - gonna give my fuzz crown and I'm going
27:20 - to some sparkles because who doesn't
27:26 - like sparkles and I think just for good
27:28 - measure I'll add a mustache okay and I'm
27:31 - gonna say so if you were using codable
27:35 - with a class this fuzz will actually
27:38 - show up on your teacher dashboard and
27:40 - you can print out the code that was that
27:42 - they just wrote and also a picture of
27:45 - their fuzz that they created yeah and
27:47 - then this unplugged activity that goes
27:50 - with this the code for a fuzz is used so
27:53 - basically to kind of go with this
27:56 - building character's activity we give an
27:58 - example of that code that corrections
27:59 - talking about so anytime your students
28:02 - build the fuzz
28:03 - with our fuzz builder look at you'll get
28:05 - to see the code that they write on their
28:07 - dashboard so this worksheet that goes
28:09 - with this activity is actually giving an
28:11 - example of that JavaScript for a fuzz
28:13 - and then students are kind of planning
28:16 - their fuzz before they get on and do
28:17 - that activity so they're just filling in
28:19 - those values that Gretchen was showing
28:21 - you can modify to write what their fuzz
28:24 - is going to look like before they do it
28:26 - yeah so you can send this home with them
28:29 - along with the printout if you decide to
28:32 - print out your students characters so
28:37 - here's that lesson then yeah so then the
28:42 - students can start solving mazes with
28:46 - their character and it's gonna go
28:51 - through a quick tutorial but the levels
28:53 - get pretty difficult pretty fast we
28:56 - introduce conditions there's some pretty
28:59 - tricky levels in here that you
29:01 - definitely need to use your
29:02 - problem-solving skills
29:04 - to figure out I'd encourage you to have
29:08 - students working in pairs if they're a
29:11 - second grade class because it can get
29:14 - kind of tricky but it's definitely fun
29:15 - and honestly it's a great opportunity
29:17 - it's the whole group is struggling on
29:20 - one - put it up on the board and kind of
29:23 - solve it together as a class okay that
29:29 - is children sighs all right now get into
29:33 - creating games so this is our most
29:38 - advanced tutorial or activity for the
29:43 - hour of code we're getting into creating
29:46 - a game with JavaScript and so what the
29:49 - students are gonna do and this is
29:53 - probably the one that I would most
29:55 - recommend using the unplugged materials
29:59 - that go with it it can be an awesome
30:01 - chance for especially your older
30:03 - students to really engage with each
30:05 - other and start learning about each
30:07 - other's preferences or the
30:08 - two cans and design just the design
30:11 - process in general which we'll get into
30:14 - after you know Gretchen shows you this
30:15 - but I highly recommend including the
30:19 - unplugged portion for this activity yep
30:21 - definitely
30:22 - so what students are gonna do they're
30:24 - gonna play through some levels just this
30:27 - is mainly to introduce the game concept
30:30 - that they're going to be building off of
30:33 - so this is asteroid eeeh this is where
30:36 - we introduce variables to students so
30:39 - this code that's written here is
30:41 - actually a code that you would write in
30:44 - JavaScript if you are going to add a
30:46 - string called purple so purple is this
30:49 - variable this furball that we just put
30:52 - into this container which is a metaphor
30:56 - for actually using variables in
30:58 - programming so once you have that you
31:02 - can match it to the asteroids over here
31:07 - so the object of the game is to clear
31:09 - the asteroid field so you can move on to
31:12 - the next lesson
31:13 - and when you combine the correct colors
31:19 - they will actually cascade and fall so
31:28 - this was just cleared with one shot
31:30 - because I matched those two blue
31:34 - sections together the same is gonna
31:37 - happen here so I'm going to use a red
31:39 - and it's gonna cause a cascade effect
31:43 - this is kind of like candy crush if any
31:45 - of you guys are familiar with that I
31:47 - promise you your students will have no
31:49 - problem with this but I'm gonna go
31:50 - through it with you guys because we get
31:53 - a lot of questions about this game so
31:56 - then the yellow then the green and the
31:57 - blue and the purple then these rocks
31:59 - will disappear we're off so this is
32:07 - a simple way of getting students
32:09 - familiar with what variables look like
32:11 - and the idea of putting a value into a
32:16 - container and then matching it with
32:19 - something well this one is a little bit
32:21 - harder so I need to say okay so we're
32:25 - going to use blue and I'm gonna put a
32:30 - green although I think those are gonna
32:33 - collapse that'll collapse it should work
32:37 - I'm gonna try it with just blue I'm
32:40 - gonna need red okay I'm gonna try
32:44 - another red too okay I'm gonna start
32:48 - with blue see what happens
32:50 - yay okay good job so then we clear the
32:56 - red and we're off all right I think you
33:08 - guys probably have it figured out by now
33:10 - but just in case of show you this one so
33:14 - I'm gonna hit this pink in the middle
33:16 - it's gonna cause everything else to fall
33:18 - and match and we should be able to do it
33:22 - in one hit yes whoo yay okay I think
33:32 - that's the last one yeah so then the
33:37 - students can start their creative
33:39 - challenge and it's the same scenario
33:41 - it's gonna give them video prompts
33:45 - you're probably gonna want to have
33:46 - headphones available for this just
33:48 - talking about game designers and how
33:51 - they come up with games what they're
33:54 - thinking when they're making games
33:56 - they're not just you know going through
33:59 - it without anyone in mind they usually
34:01 - have a specific person in mind um that
34:05 - they think of as their end user who's
34:07 - gonna be playing their game and so we're
34:09 - going to encourage students to think of
34:11 - someone in particular what kind of games
34:13 - they like and try to make a game for
34:14 - them yeah and the unplugged X would be
34:17 - actually has
34:18 - partnering with someone in class it's
34:21 - kind of an interview she just asking
34:23 - them about some of their preferences if
34:24 - they like games easier hard engaging
34:27 - their level of experience with games all
34:29 - of these things that the game designer
34:31 - would keep in mind before they build
34:33 - their game and then the idea is the
34:35 - whole design this game for that person
34:36 - and then get feedback from that person
34:39 - as a user and then they can make
34:40 - iterations and change the game great so
34:45 - once that video is finished playing
34:47 - it'll walk them through editing their
34:51 - first part of the game so this again is
34:54 - all in JavaScript these here are the
34:57 - properties of the game so we're gonna
35:00 - give our program a name or name our game
35:05 - so tonight the same thing to kind of add
35:13 - in here to I know we talked a little bit
35:15 - about classroom expectations but this is
35:17 - a great chance to include some digital
35:21 - citizenship perhaps especially for older
35:23 - kids with naming games and you know you
35:25 - know kind of going over what's
35:27 - appropriate for games and fuzz names
35:29 - this is just a good opportunity to keep
35:32 - that in mind uh students do you have the
35:34 - freedom to kind of type in their own
35:35 - creative ideas so I just edited the
35:40 - property for the number of Bin's that
35:42 - are gonna be available for my player the
35:46 - more bins you have the easier your game
35:48 - will be because you'll have more colors
35:50 - to match with your asteroids okay we're
35:57 - gonna test our game there are far like
36:00 - there are so many properties your
36:02 - students can get into to edit their game
36:05 - this just walks them through a couple
36:07 - and then they can go back in make
36:09 - changes if they need to so we're playing
36:13 - an Endless mode now the objective is to
36:16 - just last as long as you can and then
36:24 - they'll keep coming in so if I want to
36:26 - edit my code if I want to edit my game
36:29 - back to my code file here yes and I can
36:36 - say I want to add instructions to my
36:40 - game so I'm going to go to game
36:44 - instructions okay perfect and I'm going
37:15 - to save that so now my player will have
37:17 - instructions and I want to add a little
37:20 - bit of pizzazz to my game so I'm gonna
37:24 - add a smoke trail to my fur balls
37:29 - whenever they go add a rainbow great and
37:36 - one more thing I'm going to edit the
37:39 - properties of my asteroids over here if
37:43 - I want to make it difficult for my
37:45 - player I can do some things over here I
37:49 - can change the asteroid drop direction I
37:51 - can add rocks which don't match any of
37:53 - the fur balls you actually have to make
37:55 - them collide to disappear I'm gonna add
37:58 - making a taco time which is pretty fun
38:04 - taco time is true and let's give it a
38:11 - try so you can see how great this is for
38:18 - design thinking getting students working
38:20 - collaboratively thinking of their end
38:23 - user as somebody who has emotions and
38:28 - has not only is wanting to play a fun
38:31 - game but striving to make a game that is
38:34 - well balanced for them a balance I
38:37 - believe is
38:37 - vocab words that's in the in the lesson
38:40 - I'm talking about making a well-balanced
38:42 - game and why that's important and it's
38:48 - fun to to talk with students about why
38:52 - I'm sorry what properties you can change
38:56 - to make your game easier or harder
38:58 - there's specific ones you can you can
39:01 - use to make your game easier or or more
39:04 - difficult and they'll start to figure
39:07 - that out as they as they play around
39:09 - with it um okay so I think now is a
39:15 - great time for questions do we have any
39:21 - questions on anything we covered so far
39:28 - [Music]
39:34 - just wait we're on a little bit of a
39:36 - delay so that if we have any issues we
39:40 - can soften okay
39:57 - I don't know okay looks like there's no
40:07 - question so go ahead and move on if you
40:10 - have questions going to post them in
40:12 - just a minute all right
40:18 - the last thing that we want to go over
40:20 - is our structured lesson plans so we
40:24 - went over kind of the unplugged portion
40:26 - of all of these creative challenges that
40:28 - we've added this year but we have so
40:31 - many lesson plans that you can choose
40:33 - from for the hour of code a number of
40:35 - you asked about how to manage we're sort
40:38 - of juggle teaching kindergarten through
40:41 - fifth grade for the hour of code if you
40:43 - have lots of grades that you are
40:45 - teaching and you don't want to have to
40:47 - do a different lesson for every day or
40:50 - every class we do have lessons that
40:53 - build off of each other so it's a
40:54 - similar lesson but it's adapted for each
40:57 - grade level um so I'll go ahead and show
41:00 - you that and that'll bring us to all of
41:01 - the others okay so you're gonna go back
41:11 - to that codable comm slash at work code
41:14 - page and just scroll down to the bottom
41:17 - and you'll see lesson plans for teachers
41:18 - this is very top one introduction to
41:21 - programming is a perfect introduction to
41:25 - coding it is very similar to the very
41:29 - first lesson that we include in codable
41:32 - as part of our curriculum it's been
41:35 - adapted for each grade level so you just
41:38 - select the grade that you're looking for
41:40 - and it'll bring that grade up so if I'm
41:42 - going to teach my first grade class it's
41:44 - gonna bring up the adapted version of
41:46 - this lesson for first grade class and
41:49 - each lesson builds off of the idea of
41:52 - teaching sorry of programming a robot
41:55 - the robot being maybe a co-teacher
41:58 - another student
42:00 - a parent another you know a person
42:03 - basically who's pretending to be a robot
42:05 - programming them to move across the room
42:09 - and then we give you code that you're
42:12 - going to write up on the board together
42:14 - to solve this problem and then you can
42:18 - go into codable and play levels that are
42:23 - picked out specifically for this lesson
42:26 - um I'll go ahead and show you this so
42:33 - we've got vocab cards for this which is
42:36 - great we have yeah so that's where you
42:45 - can find all of them the vocab for that
42:48 - and you're going to use symbols like
42:50 - this to actually program your robot you
42:55 - know anything you know we do have a
42:59 - couple questions coming in though okay
43:01 - for middle school and high school kids
43:04 - so we obviously adapted this you know
43:06 - across khazars five take a look at that
43:09 - lesson I think you'll find ways you can
43:11 - adapt to things are already doing with
43:14 - middle or high school students and then
43:16 - we're gonna get into in a second but my
43:18 - favorite lesson for older students and I
43:21 - think it'd be really interesting I'd
43:22 - love to hear you know how this goes and
43:24 - see the work done with middle schoolers
43:26 - and high schoolers on our women in tech
43:28 - lesson this is our social studies lesson
43:30 - and it spans over a few days so you
43:32 - could do this for the entire week it
43:35 - really digs into opinion writing it's
43:39 - heavy on the ela front but also social
43:41 - studies it's just exploring the roles of
43:43 - women and technology with the examples
43:46 - and in portions of writing and
43:48 - definitely reading too so I would love
43:51 - to hear that because if you try that
43:52 - with a middle school or high school
43:54 - class we'd love to see the work that
43:56 - comes out of that yeah so this has three
44:00 - days of content again can be spanned out
44:03 - across the entire week each day has a
44:05 - video prompts and has some really great
44:08 - questions to have students kind of
44:10 - research
44:11 - and thinking and talking and sharing
44:14 - opinions so and I think it is a great
44:16 - example to you know all of our lessons
44:19 - can really be adapted to other grade
44:21 - levels just based on what you're
44:23 - currently teaching so that one you know
44:25 - it can span across 3rd 4th or 5th grade
44:27 - comments and are others too like the one
44:30 - Gretchen showed you minor adaptations
44:31 - can make it really applicable to
44:33 - different grade levels yeah this
44:36 - introduction to programming lesson I've
44:38 - actually done with a middle school class
44:39 - and everybody had a great time so don't
44:43 - be afraid of adapting it can definitely
44:46 - work again and then if like if you're if
44:49 - your students have been doing codable
44:51 - say you've been doing codable and you
44:53 - want to try something a little bit more
44:54 - advanced I encourage you to check out
44:57 - some of our advanced introduction
44:59 - lessons and that will get into a grade
45:03 - appropriate concept that's not just
45:06 - sequencing and algorithms we get into
45:09 - conditions and looping lots of cool
45:12 - stuff in in those lessons and then I
45:16 - guess the last thing to go to cover in
45:19 - this area is our cross content area
45:23 - lesson plans so if you're looking again
45:26 - from middle school
45:28 - the my first app pizza party lesson is a
45:32 - great option for older students we do
45:36 - have a k22 option for this a pre Reader
45:38 - option as well but I think that this
45:43 - brings yeah I'm just gonna say this one
45:46 - you know is going to be very easy to do
45:48 - for other grade levels
45:49 - it is super open-ended this is an
45:53 - inquiry based learning lesson the style
45:55 - of this lesson it's almost like giving
45:57 - kids a blank slate to work together to
46:00 - come up with our own ideas so these
46:01 - video prompts are kind of kind of going
46:03 - to guide them through the problem and
46:06 - then they're really spending less their
46:08 - time solving it and that can look and so
46:10 - many different ways for so many
46:11 - different ages so that will be a great
46:14 - one to try with your older kids too yeah
46:17 - so you can see students work in pairs or
46:20 - groups to complete the daily inquiry
46:21 - sheet accompanying the video
46:23 - so your download resources it's gonna
46:26 - include all of those video enquiries and
46:32 - lastly I guess we'll show robotics so
46:35 - there are there is a science lesson here
46:38 - that Bree developed it's one of my
46:39 - favorites actually it's really fun
46:44 - materials yeah you do need materials but
46:47 - I think it's worth it um and then we've
46:50 - got some writing lessons that are K
46:52 - through five adapted already for you so
46:56 - if you have if you want to do that you
46:58 - can do that um we have an ela lesson
47:02 - which is prequel create your own
47:04 - adventure coding challenge which is also
47:08 - very easy to adapt and we gave an
47:10 - example of a book but you guys could use
47:12 - any any kind of you know other story
47:15 - that you have in mind or that's relevant
47:17 - to your classroom - um and then we've
47:21 - obviously this is a fan favorite but we
47:29 - do have a robotics lesson available
47:32 - using - and Doc's either you have - um
47:34 - dot in your classroom and you want to do
47:37 - a robotics lesson it is k - appropriate
47:41 - and it's an introduction to robotics
47:43 - um so check that out the last but not
47:47 - least well I guess we can pause well you
47:49 - haven't done a couple question of it
47:51 - coming in we have so I saw somebody it's
47:54 - it's a little higher up in the chat but
47:56 - somebody was asking about collaboration
47:58 - with younger students specifically
48:00 - kindergarten I think that's totally up
48:02 - to you collaboration of programming is
48:05 - huge right program is an awesome thing I
48:08 - think if you are looking for social
48:11 - emotional benefits I think that's a
48:12 - great way to do it
48:13 - kindergarteners that at this point in a
48:16 - year I know it's December may not be in
48:18 - a place where they can work productively
48:20 - in pairs that's going to be dependent
48:22 - upon individual classrooms so I mean if
48:24 - you have kids at the point in the year
48:26 - where they're ready to do partner work
48:28 - and engage in conversation and work
48:30 - together I think it's a great idea
48:32 - if you find that may detract
48:35 - our names and maybe they're not ready
48:36 - for it so I think that's definitely your
48:38 - call I recommend doing it if you if you
48:41 - feel your classroom is there though cool
48:46 - yes so Steve s was asking about it
48:50 - building towers which is coming soon
48:52 - it's not available in the app right now
48:54 - that activity but we do have an
48:56 - unplugged lesson that is available for
48:58 - that so if you want to do the towers X
49:01 - and be unplugged and it is available as
49:03 - one of our lesson plans in our lesson
49:05 - library and that is just a quick game
49:08 - kind of teaching kids about properties
49:10 - and some of our classes and objects and
49:13 - Peguero
49:14 - it's a really fun card game yeah it's
49:16 - just teaching kids you know and there
49:18 - are vocab cards too so I would
49:20 - definitely recommend going with
49:21 - vocabulary and getting into the game
49:23 - kids are experimenting with different
49:26 - properties and values and adding values
49:29 - together it's pretty math Pepe it's
49:31 - definitely a partner activity it's fun
49:33 - cool pictures cool art I would
49:37 - definitely check that out
49:38 - yeah one thing to note is that all of
49:40 - these activities are going to be
49:41 - available beyond just the hour of code
49:43 - so if you have a successful week say you
49:46 - invited a fellow teacher to your room to
49:48 - see this stuff happening and they love
49:51 - it they can go and do this another week
49:53 - it does not each be doing an hour of
49:55 - code you can do this throughout the year
49:57 - all of these activities are available to
49:59 - you throughout the year when we add the
50:01 - built the tower building activity it'll
50:04 - be available on our our code website
50:06 - where we've been going this entire time
50:08 - instead of being grayed out it'll be
50:10 - clickable so you can feel free to use
50:14 - that lesson later on if you decide to
50:16 - it's really rad it's a cool lesson so
50:21 - yeah okay the last thing that I wanted
50:25 - to go over is how to get certificates
50:28 - for your students if you have a like we
50:32 - said if you have a clinical account that
50:33 - you're using and you have students
50:35 - imported when you you'll be able to
50:37 - print certificates with all their names
50:40 - on them from your teacher dashboard
50:42 - that's what I recommend that's
50:44 - I would do I'm always up for saving time
50:46 - but if you would like to if you still
50:49 - don't want to create an account and you
50:50 - want to just get a certificate for your
50:53 - kids let me show you where you can do
50:55 - that so you're just gonna go back to
51:00 - this quotable calm such our code site
51:04 - scroll down here below the lesson plans
51:07 - and into your email address and we will
51:11 - send you a certificate and that can be
51:14 - printed on your school printers um and
51:18 - you can add students names it's really
51:20 - cool it's a great certificate I think
51:24 - and there will also be at the end of
51:28 - every at the end of every challenge so
51:40 - at the end of every hour of code
51:43 - challenge you can actually click get
51:46 - your certificate this button will turn
51:47 - green and your students will see a
51:49 - certificate pop-up that can be printed
51:51 - from that device so if they have access
51:54 - to a printer they can just print their
51:56 - own if they're playing without saving it
51:59 - will not have their name on it if you're
52:01 - playing without an accountable not have
52:03 - your name on if they are playing with
52:04 - their class code it will have their team
52:07 - on it so something to keep in mind
52:10 - alright that is everything I know we
52:13 - have a lot of questions and we want to
52:15 - run through um so yeah I'm gonna go
52:22 - ahead and start doing that um does
52:26 - anybody if you do have questions that
52:28 - you want us to answer go ahead and post
52:30 - them in the chat send them to us on
52:31 - Twitter
52:32 - Pat codable we are monitoring that as
52:35 - well cuz we're great at multitasking
52:36 - mm-hmm okay so does quotable share
52:45 - student data with third parties no we do
52:47 - not feel free to check our privacy
52:49 - policy we will never share student data
52:52 - we got into how to teach young students
52:55 - pre-k to first grade
52:56 - we talked a little bit about managing
52:58 - multiple classes multiple grades we
53:02 - talked about how I can get other
53:03 - teachers to join do they need to finish
53:08 - all the activities no your sims do not
53:10 - need to finish if they don't finish
53:11 - that's okay they can finish at home
53:13 - especially if you're they're playing on
53:15 - a school account if you want to log in
53:18 - and create an account then they can save
53:20 - their progress and come back to it later
53:21 - otherwise they will lose their progress
53:24 - if they log out on but you don't feel
53:27 - like they have to finish if they don't
53:29 - finish they can always come back and try
53:31 - it again another time we never never had
53:33 - a problem with kids complaining about
53:34 - having to do things action it's funny
53:37 - the teachers tend to get worried about
53:39 - it but the kids are like okay um okay
53:43 - do you offer free PD for teachers we
53:46 - offer these webinars from time to time
53:48 - we do not offer structured PD courses
53:51 - for free but we do have a variety P
53:54 - options available also um a training
53:57 - call is included in all of our school
53:59 - plans so if you are a global school
54:01 - subscriber and you haven't been imported
54:03 - by priests you should get in touch with
54:05 - us because we have PD for you can I step

54:11 - class we would love to so email me
54:14 - Gretchen at pootle comm if the time is
54:17 - available I would love to talk with your
54:20 - class and I can speak for brave it I
54:22 - think that she would probably enjoy it
54:23 - as much yes so we talked about middle
54:28 - school activities we talked about
54:30 - JavaScript this code will require a
54:33 - flash no we do not require flash can
54:38 - code will be used with pupils with
54:39 - additional learning needs
54:40 - yes codable is not designed for students
54:44 - with special needs however it is
54:46 - commonly used in that context we are not
54:51 - the experts there that is your domain if
54:54 - you teach students with special needs
54:57 - than feel free to give it a try and
54:59 - evaluate it and see if it's something
55:01 - that works for your kids we would love
55:02 - to hear about it yeah we we recently did
55:06 - a feature update for
55:08 - hi students so we have that on our blog
55:11 - we will send out the link in the chat as
55:13 - well so you guys can learn a little bit
55:16 - more about it fun factor a designer is
55:18 - actually comfortable and so he did some
55:21 - awesome work to make that happen
55:23 - yeah so they were proud of that yeah the
55:26 - ability to turn that on for any students
55:28 - who are color blind and need that
55:30 - assistance mm how long does a unit of
55:34 - coding take for other schools it really
55:36 - depends on your school and what you
55:38 - define as a unit um some schools only
55:42 - participate in the hour of code once a
55:44 - year they just do the artwork Odin and
55:46 - their own they're done and that's fine
55:48 - others are teaching code school teaching
55:53 - coding throughout the school year
55:54 - usually once a week for about an hour
55:57 - and there are ten coding units in
56:01 - codable each unit is about five weeks
56:04 - long so they range from a beginner all
56:08 - the way to advanced and if you are doing
56:12 - a really depends oh and what you feel up
56:16 - to and what you can fit in your schedule
56:17 - if you have questions about this and you
56:20 - want to talk a little bit more code
56:22 - beyond an hour of code I would be happy
56:25 - to have that conversation with you I do
56:27 - that a lot with different schools that
56:29 - work with so many schools on how to do
56:30 - that how to implement we also have a
56:32 - series on our blog about implementing
56:34 - computer science at your school and the
56:37 - four stages of doing that how this
56:39 - wouldn't roll out over four stages we
56:42 - can share that with you it's a great
56:43 - resource it's basically the culmination
56:46 - of all the knowledge that I've had years
56:48 - of talking with schools um okay my
56:53 - students are experienced with codable is
56:55 - there anything new or more advanced they
56:57 - could do this year they're gifted
56:59 - students in grades 1 through 7 yes
57:01 - whenever some of the advanced tutorials
57:04 - the advanced activities I think any of
57:06 - those of the agreat sit for gifted
57:08 - students or students who are experienced
57:10 - with decodable can you create a class
57:13 - for free yes you can just go to quotable
57:16 - column and click get start
57:17 - and that's where you can create your
57:19 - account deokman iPads or Chromebooks for
57:24 - kindergarten I recommend iPads
57:27 - definitely can I get PD credit for this
57:32 - PDE credit for this webinar I'm not sure
57:36 - we're not working with any districts
57:37 - directly to provide credit for this
57:40 - webinar I would ask them I'm more than
57:43 - happy to share this link and I'm not
57:48 - sure if I can get the chat archive but
57:49 - um any I'm willing to vouch for anybody
57:52 - who says they were here so um if you
57:56 - watch this farm I think you've earned an
57:58 - hour of PT credit okay Helen can you
58:02 - list ways that koto illness can be
58:04 - integrated with reading writing on maths
58:06 - 384 uh any lessons that are common core
58:10 - aligned well it will be listed in the
58:14 - sand by the grade level in the standard
58:17 - so some of them just showed you tonight
58:18 - the math actually wasn't the math the
58:20 - social studies has ela standards we have
58:23 - a whole ela unit which is aligned and it
58:27 - goes by grade level and yes they are
58:29 - great for extenders they don't know them
58:31 - off the top of my head what grade levels
58:35 - can this be used for
58:37 - Oh kotas I don't know why I've kept that
58:39 - question we covered that but anyway what
58:42 - total is k-25 and doing but it can be
58:46 - adapted for many other great now the
58:50 - last question can I transfer students
58:52 - from a class I set up last year to a new
58:54 - class so that they don't lose their
58:56 - progress yes and if you are in this
58:59 - Google Doc that I posted at the
59:01 - beginning of the video it'll be in the
59:04 - comments section once this video is
59:06 - complete but there's a link to how to do
59:11 - that
59:12 - you can also go to support doc codable
59:16 - calm and we have tons of articles on how
59:20 - to manage classes how to manage students
59:23 - how to view progress how to basically
59:26 - any question that we get a lot it's the
59:28 - answer is there
