00:00 - welcome to codable today we're going to
00:02 - walk through how you can try to solve
00:04 - The Mazes created by other students
00:06 - to start let's go to maze maker
00:09 - [Music]
00:11 - this is where you can create your own
00:12 - maze
00:14 - more mazes is where you can play the top
00:17 - Mazes of the week
00:20 - and this is rapid sort where you can
00:22 - pick play and react to three different
00:25 - mazes let's try this game out
00:28 - [Music]
00:34 - first we'll pick three different mazes
00:36 - to solve
00:37 - [Music]
00:55 - next we'll code our way through each
00:57 - individual maze to collect all the stars
01:01 - from Loops to conditions and functions
01:04 - you might need to use all your coding
01:06 - tools to get your fuzz to the end of the
01:08 - maze
01:10 - [Music]
01:17 - thank you
01:21 - [Music]
01:47 - enough
01:48 - after each maze you'll get a chance to
01:50 - react to the maze these reactions will
01:53 - help determine what the top Mazes of the
01:54 - week are
01:57 - [Music]
02:20 - thank you
02:25 - [Music]
02:38 - great job solving all the mazes
02:53 - now it's your turn head to create and
02:56 - design a maze that you think can make it
02:58 - into the top mazes this week
03:00 - happy coding
