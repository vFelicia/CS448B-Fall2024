00:15 - we are almost done before i wrap up i'll
00:18 - just share some quick tips for what to
00:20 - do after you've evaluated student
00:22 - progress so
00:24 - you've
00:25 - if we kind of summarize what we've
00:26 - talked about so far you've thought about
00:28 - the standards you've used it to guide
00:30 - what you're teaching and what you're
00:32 - hoping students will learn then you
00:34 - might have employed some of the methods
00:36 - for evaluation you've conducted
00:38 - interviews you've
00:40 - looked at their designs and
00:43 - emphasize projects and now
00:46 - you want to share it and uh thinking
00:48 - about how to share student learning
00:51 - progress with admin and parents
00:54 - depending on how many students you have
00:55 - it can be a lot and i'm hoping that
00:57 - these
00:58 - these just quick possibilities are
01:00 - something that you might choose to do to
01:02 - showcase
01:04 - the growth and the skills that the kids
01:05 - have gained
01:06 - which again i mentioned are a bit harder
01:08 - to quantify so sharing it can be tricky
01:13 - so the first is show don't tell
01:15 - basically make learning and progress
01:18 - visible and this doesn't need to be a
01:19 - competition or like a star chart on your
01:22 - wall just having some sort of visual
01:25 - depiction of progress can be really
01:28 - motivating and inspiring
01:31 - and i would say
01:32 - as a
01:33 - teacher interested in bringing
01:35 - computer science education into your
01:37 - classroom you're likely also open to
01:41 - using technology in new ways so i would
01:43 - say take advantage of the digital medium
01:45 - you can think about posting
01:48 - project examples that your kids have
01:50 - done on a class page online or as a
01:53 - newsletter
01:55 - or like featured in a slide deck or
01:56 - something where you're utilizing the
01:58 - digital medium to share
02:01 - work and
02:03 - really who the students are to admin and
02:06 - parents and other teachers
02:10 - second would be to invite peers to join
02:13 - your class um when i was a computer
02:15 - science teacher i was the only teacher
02:17 - at my school who was teaching coding and
02:19 - there were so many other teachers that i
02:21 - worked with that simply had no idea what
02:24 - my kids were doing in my classroom
02:26 - because it was so different from what
02:29 - other classes might look like so when i
02:31 - started inviting them in just to have
02:33 - them view the work that my kids were
02:36 - doing
02:37 - they
02:37 - they were so excited to see the content
02:39 - crossover and they were
02:41 - more apt to ask their students what they
02:43 - were learning computer science and i
02:46 - just think it's a really nice way to
02:48 - illuminate this again this subject
02:50 - computer science for k2 students is a
02:53 - really new idea and the best way to
02:56 - share progress a lot of the time is just
02:58 - to invite others to witness it
03:03 - the third is to host an event as i've
03:05 - mentioned time and time again today i
03:07 - love projects as a way to demonstrate
03:10 - and assess
03:12 - learning and
03:14 - uh
03:15 - if you would like to showcase student
03:18 - progress
03:19 - if you've been doing project-based
03:21 - learning in your classroom hosting some
03:22 - sort of an event that
03:24 - puts the projects on display is a really
03:27 - awesome way to do that so
03:30 - again using my own experience as a
03:32 - computer science teacher we did a
03:34 - project-based unit learning unit on
03:37 - game design and at the end we had a mini
03:40 - maker faire where students got to
03:43 - showcase
03:44 - a lot of them had physical games that
03:46 - they had created like with recycled
03:48 - materials and also had games that they
03:51 - had coded um on scratch that they had on
03:54 - the chromebooks and we invited friends
03:56 - and family to come and interact with
03:59 - them and i just think this is a really
04:02 - lovely way for
04:04 - your young students to be able to share
04:07 - the progress the effort that they've put
04:09 - forth throughout the unit and just get
04:12 - the community involved a little bit
04:14 - it can be a really nice way to share the
04:16 - progress there
