00:04 - let's go
00:07 - in this coding activity you will create
00:09 - a fuzzy fall harvest maze for blue fuzz
00:13 - [Music]
00:15 - this activity is unplugged which means
00:17 - you don't need a computer
00:20 - here's what you will need
00:22 - scissors
00:23 - blue
00:24 - drawing supplies and the fuzzy fall
00:26 - harvest worksheet
00:28 - you can find this linked in the
00:29 - description box below to download and
00:32 - print
00:33 - ready to go
00:34 - let's jump in
00:36 - have you ever been to a corn maze
00:39 - no not a candy corn maze a real maze
00:42 - made out of corn
00:44 - the goal is to get from the start of the
00:46 - maze through to the finish
00:48 - sometimes there are fun things to
00:50 - collect on your way like apples pumpkins
00:54 - or you guessed it corn
00:56 - the corn stalks that make up the walls
00:58 - of the maze might be double or triple
01:00 - your size so you can't see out
01:03 - they might have twists and turns and
01:07 - even dead ends so it can be tricky to
01:09 - find your way through
01:11 - here's what a giant one looks like from
01:13 - a bird's eye view
01:14 - can you imagine if you were right here
01:17 - it would be fun but also challenging to
01:20 - get out without getting lost
01:22 - this year the fuzz family has decided to
01:24 - head to the fuzztopia corn maze to give
01:26 - it a roll
01:28 - in case you haven't met them yet the
01:30 - fuzzies are round furry aliens who love
01:33 - adventure and trying new things
01:36 - but blue fuzz is feeling a little
01:38 - nervous
01:39 - on one hand he's so excited to have fun
01:42 - with his family and harvest some fall
01:44 - treats
01:45 - but on the other he doesn't want to get
01:47 - lost in the maze
01:49 - to make sure that he has a good time and
01:51 - stays safe there's something you can do
01:54 - to help
01:56 - first you get to design the corn maze
01:59 - you can make sure it's fun and
02:00 - challenging but also solvable
02:03 - and second you will give blue fuzz the
02:06 - exact sequence of instructions needed to
02:08 - get through the maze
02:10 - in other words you'll tell him where to
02:12 - go so there's no way to get lost
02:16 - here's how it works
02:17 - as a reminder you'll need your worksheet
02:20 - scissors glue
02:22 - and something to draw with
02:24 - step one draw a maze that connects start
02:28 - to finish
02:30 - [Music]
02:32 - step two
02:34 - cut out the corn pumpkin and apple from
02:37 - page two of your worksheet and glue them
02:39 - somewhere in your maze
02:41 - these are the treats that blue fuzz will
02:43 - harvest on his way to the finish line
02:46 - step three add decorations
02:48 - cut out the other items and glue them
02:50 - around your maze
02:52 - you can use your drawing supplies to
02:54 - spruce it up even more
02:56 - now it's time to solve the maze if
02:58 - you're working alone you can do this
03:00 - yourself or challenge a friend or family
03:02 - member solving the maze means figuring
03:05 - out the correct sequence of arrow
03:07 - commands that blue should follow to
03:09 - reach the end
03:11 - let's use this example maze that i
03:12 - created for blue
03:14 - to harvest the fall treats and reach the
03:16 - finish which way does blue need to roll
03:20 - right
03:21 - down
03:22 - left
03:23 - down
03:24 - right
03:26 - draw these direction arrows in the
03:28 - spaces below the maze right down left
03:32 - down right
03:34 - notice that if blue follows this
03:36 - sequence exactly he will roll right
03:39 - through the maze and join his family
03:42 - this is a sequence of instructions that
03:44 - results in a specific outcome
03:47 - in coding this is called an algorithm
03:50 - you can create an algorithm too
03:53 - now it's your turn
03:54 - help blue fuzz harvest the fall treats
03:57 - and get to the end of the corn maze
03:59 - all the instructions mentioned in this
04:01 - video are also on your fuzzy fall
04:03 - harvest worksheet so just print it out
04:06 - and get rolling
