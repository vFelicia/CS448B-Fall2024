00:01 - let's go
00:04 - let's plan a party there's a lot of
00:07 - stuff that goes into it
00:08 - you need to decide what food to serve
00:11 - songs to play and who to invite
00:13 - when you're planning something like this
00:15 - how do you keep track of everything you
00:17 - need
00:18 - you might group all these items into
00:20 - lists
00:21 - grocery list playlist
00:24 - guest list
00:25 - all of these lists help you keep related
00:28 - information together and organized
00:30 - of course we use lists every day not
00:33 - just when we're planning a party
00:35 - they can help us decide what's most
00:36 - important and think about the big
00:38 - picture
00:40 - lists are helpful for keeping code
00:43 - organized too
00:44 - in javascript a list is called an array
00:47 - [Music]
00:49 - you can store related pieces of data
00:51 - together in one place within a program
00:53 - so why is this important
00:56 - remember encoding a variable is useful
00:58 - for storing a single value that can
01:01 - change
01:02 - but as we collect more information
01:04 - keeping variables organized can be
01:06 - tricky
01:07 - for example let's say you want to create
01:09 - a program to keep track of the names of
01:11 - all your party guests
01:13 - for the first friend you could create a
01:15 - variable and store their name as a
01:17 - string like this
01:19 - and for a few names this is no big deal
01:23 - but what if you wanted to invite
01:25 - everyone in your class or school
01:28 - do you even know how many people go to
01:30 - your school
01:32 - it would be really hard to keep track of
01:33 - so many variables especially if you
01:36 - don't know the number of names ahead of
01:37 - time
01:38 - instead use an array
01:41 - an array is like a container that keeps
01:43 - similar things together in a single
01:45 - ordered list
01:47 - the container can grow or shrink to fit
01:50 - the number of items inside
01:52 - you might think of an array like a
01:54 - connected row of numbered boxes
01:56 - each box can have one thing in it
01:58 - just like you can assign a single value
02:01 - to a variable
02:02 - you can store an entire array of values
02:05 - in a variable too
02:07 - this list is only four items long but in
02:09 - code it could be hundreds or thousands
02:12 - of values
02:13 - in javascript an array looks like this
02:16 - values separated by commas and stored in
02:19 - brackets
02:20 - these are all strings but an array can
02:22 - also store integers
02:25 - or both
02:27 - once you create the array you can add
02:29 - items to your list or remove them the
02:32 - order that you store the values will
02:33 - stay the same making it easy for you to
02:35 - know where each item is located on the
02:37 - list
02:39 - let's look at how arrays show up in
02:41 - codable in order for our fuzz to reach
02:44 - the end of the maze it needs to be able
02:46 - to roll through this tunnel but the
02:48 - tunnel door is closed we need to find a
02:51 - key that will open it
02:53 - let's try coating our fuzz to roll
02:55 - through the maze and pick up a key along
02:57 - the way
02:59 - our fuzz collected a triangle key
03:02 - but the tunnel needs a short list of
03:05 - keys to open
03:06 - first diamond then triangle in order to
03:10 - unlock this tunnel we need to create an
03:13 - array
03:14 - remember in the array the order of the
03:16 - list item matters
03:18 - the tunnel shows diamond first triangle
03:21 - second
03:22 - so we need to code our fuzz to collect
03:24 - the keys in the same order
03:27 - any keys we collect will be stored here
03:29 - inside the array brackets let's go
03:33 - first diamond
03:35 - then triangle
03:37 - and we did it
03:38 - the array values are equal and our fuzz
03:41 - can roll through
