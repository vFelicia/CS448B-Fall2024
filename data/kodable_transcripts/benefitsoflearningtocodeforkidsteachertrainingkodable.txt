00:18 - my guess is if you're watching
00:20 - this webinar chances are you do have
00:23 - some idea of how coding education can
00:27 - benefit
00:28 - your students but you might not know all
00:30 - the details and that's why we're here
00:32 - so i've broken this section down into
00:34 - three parts the benefits for students
00:36 - the benefits for teachers because there
00:38 - are some benefits for you
00:39 - and some benefits for admin and and
00:42 - school-wide benefits as well
00:45 - so first benefits for students this is
00:48 - likely why we're bringing coding into
00:49 - the classroom we want
00:51 - uh to help our students be the best that
00:53 - they can be
00:54 - and that's what we're going to talk
00:56 - about now so the first
00:58 - big benefit is the soft skills that
01:01 - students learn while coding that can be
01:04 - helpful in all areas of school and
01:07 - beyond
01:09 - unlike hard skills that can be learned
01:12 - and evaluated these soft skills are
01:17 - they're a little bit more subtle they're
01:19 - they're harder to
01:21 - identify and they might be a little bit
01:22 - more difficult to measure
01:24 - but they are developed and fostered and
01:27 - nurtured
01:28 - through practice so we're talking about
01:31 - skills like
01:32 - teamwork and collaboration creative
01:34 - thinking and problem solving
01:36 - mental flexibility resilience and work
01:39 - ethic
01:40 - traditional schooling requires teachers
01:43 - to cover so much specific
01:45 - content knowledge that kids will be
01:47 - tested on so finding
01:48 - time to nurture and practice these soft
01:52 - skills can be really difficult
01:54 - and coding is one way to actively
01:57 - practice
01:58 - these soft skills that are you know
02:01 - they're equally as important these are
02:03 - skills that are going to serve them
02:04 - for their entire life so coding can
02:07 - really help with those soft skills for
02:09 - sure
02:11 - the next is developing executive
02:14 - functioning skills
02:16 - similar to soft skills that are a little
02:19 - bit harder
02:19 - to target in traditional school but are
02:22 - still vital
02:23 - for future success coding can help
02:26 - target
02:27 - executive function skills like planning
02:30 - planning ahead
02:32 - self-pacing figuring out what pace would
02:35 - work best for you of working on a task
02:37 - by yourself
02:38 - working memory so remembering things in
02:41 - a short
02:42 - period of time and adaptability when
02:46 - faced with challenges so when presented
02:49 - with a challenge
02:50 - how do you respond and get through that
02:53 - challenge
02:54 - coding since there are so many
02:57 - opportunities to
02:58 - make mistakes but then also identify
03:01 - them and solve them
03:02 - it's really great for staying adaptable
03:05 - when faced with challenge and
03:06 - in general developing those executive
03:08 - function skills
03:11 - the third benefit for students is
03:12 - language development
03:14 - i think we all know that children are
03:16 - are better able to learn new languages
03:18 - when they're younger
03:19 - and code is just that it's a language
03:22 - and sometimes it's easy to forget that
03:25 - but it is a language that children can
03:27 - learn when they're younger they'll have
03:29 - a faster time to catch on
03:31 - as opposed to us adults who are
03:32 - interested in learning to code when
03:34 - we're older
03:34 - and we have a little bit more difficulty
03:37 - as well as being able to learn a
03:39 - language
03:40 - faster when they're younger language
03:42 - learning has been shown to improve
03:44 - a lot of things with student cognitive
03:46 - function so that includes
03:48 - you know enhanced problem-solving skills
03:51 - improved verbal abilities
03:53 - again better memory and creative
03:56 - thinking
03:56 - so because code is a language and
03:59 - language development
04:00 - has a lot of these benefits i just like
04:02 - to point that out it's one more benefit
04:04 - for your students
04:06 - and then the fourth one is increased
04:09 - self-efficacy so when we're talking
04:10 - about
04:11 - self-efficacy we're referring to a
04:14 - couple things
04:15 - one includes mental flexibility so how
04:18 - children
04:18 - are judging their own abilities their
04:21 - confidence levels
04:23 - their confidence in the ability to like
04:26 - exert control over
04:28 - one's own motivation and behavior and
04:31 - social environment uh coding and
04:33 - computer science lessons have been
04:35 - linked to
04:36 - increased self-efficacy especially for
04:38 - early elementary students
04:40 - these students have been shown to be
04:42 - more likely to stay on task
04:44 - to stay motivated to control their
04:47 - responses to stimuli in the classroom
04:49 - so that's another huge benefit for
04:51 - coding education
04:53 - so in summary for your benefits for
04:55 - students coding skills translate
04:58 - to many different areas and benefits
05:00 - students far beyond
05:02 - just learning to code which is why i
05:04 - love it so much
05:07 - okay up next is benefits for teachers so
05:11 - while i'm guessing most of you
05:13 - might be implementing a coding program
05:16 - for the benefit
05:16 - of your students there are some
05:19 - additional benefits for teachers that
05:21 - are a huge added bonus so the first
05:24 - is a classroom culture crafting a
05:26 - classroom culture
05:28 - that is meaningful for you and your
05:30 - students so what i mean by this
05:31 - is that coding can be difficult
05:35 - and by incorporating it you're telling
05:37 - your students that your classroom
05:40 - is a safe place to try something new to
05:43 - take a risk
05:44 - to come up and generate with multiple
05:46 - possible solutions
05:47 - um when i was teaching i know my
05:50 - students would
05:51 - come to my classroom at their recess or
05:54 - their lunch breaks
05:54 - to just to ask crazy questions or to
05:57 - pitch
05:58 - a project idea just to let their
06:00 - creativity kind of run wild
06:02 - because they knew that the coding
06:04 - classroom that they entered was a place
06:07 - where
06:07 - they could do that they didn't have to
06:09 - do everything perfect they just had to
06:11 - put forward effort and
06:14 - express themselves how they wanted so
06:17 - even if you
06:18 - don't have your own classroom dedicated
06:20 - to coding if you are trying to
06:21 - incorporate coding
06:23 - or computer science into a math
06:25 - classroom or an english classroom
06:27 - just know that by doing so you are
06:30 - bringing in opportunities for
06:32 - problem solving and for risk taking and
06:35 - that's something really special for
06:36 - classroom culture
06:38 - and as well coding is oftentimes
06:41 - you know project based which means
06:44 - students have the opportunity to bring
06:45 - in
06:46 - their own personal expression to your
06:47 - classroom so you have that opportunity
06:50 - for
06:50 - responsive teaching the second benefit
06:54 - for teachers
06:55 - is we talked about it a little bit on
06:56 - the last slide but student engagement
06:58 - and motivation
07:00 - as i mentioned on that student benefits
07:02 - slide coding and computer science has
07:03 - been linked to
07:05 - increased student engagement and
07:08 - motivation to learn really so this is
07:11 - obviously great news for your kiddos but
07:13 - it's a huge plus for you as the teacher
07:15 - it's so much more fun
07:17 - and easy to teach when students are
07:19 - excited to be at school and excited to
07:21 - be learning
07:23 - which really is the key coding is fun
07:26 - and my students were motivated in class
07:28 - because it was something different
07:29 - it was something that was drawing on
07:31 - parts of their their brain that
07:33 - the other classes weren't the other
07:35 - subjects weren't you get to make things
07:37 - and share projects so
07:39 - seeing my students happy was a real
07:41 - benefit to me and i'm
07:43 - happy and engaged and motivated and i'm
07:45 - sure it would be for you too
07:50 - and then the third benefit for teachers
07:52 - is going to be
07:53 - student self-sufficiency again they all
07:56 - kind of weave together but the nature of
07:58 - coding is filled with
08:00 - trial and error forming hypotheses
08:03 - testing iterating debugging
08:06 - you know there will be an uncountable
08:08 - number of times where
08:10 - students need to get unstuck and the joy
08:13 - of coding is that there are possible
08:15 - ways to make that happen so
08:17 - you'll see students helping themselves
08:19 - helping their classmates
08:21 - to solve their problems in a way that
08:23 - works for them
08:24 - and practice is key right so if you
08:28 - bring coding into your classroom and
08:29 - there are so many chances for them to
08:30 - solve their own problems
08:32 - they are going to reach self-sufficiency
08:35 - faster
08:36 - um this example on the right this
08:38 - picture you're seeing was sent to us
08:39 - from
08:40 - a teacher who uses codable in their
08:41 - classroom and
08:43 - it's filled with recommendation
08:45 - questions that
08:46 - students can ask each other when they
08:48 - get stuck so it's a way for
08:51 - kids to help each other and to not have
08:53 - to raise their hand
08:54 - and ask the teacher when they're stuck
08:56 - every single time
08:57 - they can solve the problem on their own
08:59 - with the help from their classmates and
09:01 - that's really great
09:05 - finally there are benefits for school
09:08 - admin
09:08 - or for school-wide benefits as well
09:12 - and these are somewhat similar to
09:13 - benefits for teachers but i do think
09:15 - it's worth mentioning them on a
09:16 - school-wide
09:17 - a school-wide scale a bigger scale so
09:20 - the first
09:21 - bringing coding into your school can
09:23 - increase that culture of hard work
09:26 - we've talked about it a bunch but it's
09:27 - asking questions creative problem
09:29 - solving
09:30 - this doesn't need to be siloed to a
09:32 - single computer science room and frankly
09:34 - it shouldn't be it should be
09:36 - school-wide and i've seen a lot of
09:38 - schools have success
09:39 - when teachers buy in and are infusing
09:42 - coding or
09:43 - stem into every subject and not treating
09:47 - it just as an extra
09:49 - i think this is important because when
09:50 - we treat computer science or stem as an
09:53 - add-on
09:53 - then our students are smart and they're
09:56 - learning
09:57 - that that stem and coding is separate
10:00 - from english and math and science and
10:02 - social studies
10:03 - when in the real world they're all
10:05 - really linked together stem and coding
10:07 - and computer science
10:08 - touch all of these subjects once they
10:10 - leave
10:11 - the school yard so i do like to
10:15 - encourage
10:16 - schools to be incorporating this and not
10:19 - treat it as separate
10:20 - that said fully integrating stem into a
10:24 - curriculum takes a ton of time and it's
10:26 - not going to happen overnight
10:27 - but i do think that coding especially is
10:29 - a a good smaller place to start
10:34 - and then a third benefit for admin is
10:36 - exposing children to new career paths
10:39 - you've likely seen some sort of a chart
10:42 - or
10:43 - like a bar graph that shows how exposure
10:46 - to computer science at a young age
10:48 - increases the likelihood that that child
10:51 - will pursue it again in the future
10:52 - either in graduate study or as a career
10:55 - and that is still
10:56 - totally true we never know what sort of
10:59 - interest
11:00 - we can spark with a new subject or a new
11:03 - experience so
11:04 - bringing coding into the classroom or
11:06 - into the school
11:07 - is a good way to expose students to
11:10 - something that they might not have
11:11 - realized was a possibility for them
