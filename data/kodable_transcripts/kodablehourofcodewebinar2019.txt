00:00 - and this is Hannah hello and we are so
00:03 - excited to share with you all about the
00:06 - our code um many of you RSVP'd and told
00:12 - us this is your very first time he's
00:15 - incredible for the our code so we are so
00:17 - excited for you we have been doing this
00:19 - since 2013 so this is our sixth year
00:22 - doing the our code with codable and we
00:26 - have some exciting new activities for
00:29 - your students we're gonna go over all of
00:33 - that with you today we're gonna go over
00:34 - how to get your class set up how to get
00:38 - your devices set up we're gonna go over
00:40 - the new activity with you we're gonna
00:42 - cover some of the activities from
00:44 - previous years and then we're going to
00:47 - talk a little bit about what to expect
00:49 - after the RF code so immediately
00:51 - following kind of like some ideas to
00:52 - celebrate what your kids have achieved
00:55 - share with their families and then also
00:59 - what you can expect after the hour of
01:00 - code if you decide hey this coding thing
01:03 - is pretty cool I'm gonna keep doing it
01:05 - we've got some tips for you we've got
01:07 - some panas gonna share some cool things
01:09 - that you can do with codable beyond just
01:12 - your hour of code activity so to get
01:17 - things going I'm going to tell you a
01:19 - little bit about hannah hannah joined
01:20 - our team this year she's fantastic she
01:24 - was working at a charter school here in
01:27 - California as the computer science
01:30 - teacher then decided to go to Harvard
01:32 - and get her it was a Masters of
01:36 - Education and technology education so
01:38 - she is perfectly suited to be telling
01:40 - you all about how to use codable in your
01:43 - classrooms we're so lucky to have her on
01:45 - our team so without much further ado
01:49 - we're gonna go ahead and get going um
01:52 - so to begin you all submitted some great
01:56 - questions and your RSVP and I just want
02:00 - to make sure that we cover all of them
02:02 - one of my favorite questions was I am
02:05 - very new to coding specifically our
02:07 - earth code what kind of computer
02:09 - background do I need to learn it to
02:11 - teach my first graders
02:12 - and you don't really need to have any
02:16 - computer science knowledge to use
02:19 - codable first of all or to do the hour
02:22 - of code that's the beauty of it like
02:24 - that's why it's so exciting because the
02:25 - hour of code was started by code org as
02:28 - an initiative to get kids exposed to
02:31 - computer science adults exposed to
02:33 - computer science
02:33 - everyone just trying it for one hour for
02:36 - the very first time so it's very
02:38 - beginner friendly all of our activities
02:41 - give you everything that you need right
02:43 - there in the lesson plan so it's
02:45 - completely scripted you can follow along
02:47 - if you have no CS background we're gonna
02:50 - do all of the vocabulary we're gonna
02:52 - give you all of the materials that
02:54 - you'll need and we even had some if you
02:58 - really want to learn about the concepts
03:00 - on your own we have videos and modules
03:03 - where you can learn all about every
03:05 - concept that we teach in codable so but
03:09 - but that's not necessary just give it a
03:12 - try honestly the only thing that's
03:13 - required is a growth mindset and we're
03:16 - all big fans of that here incredible so
03:18 - just get your thinking cap on don't be
03:21 - afraid to make mistakes your kids are
03:23 - gonna be making mistakes right along
03:24 - with you they love it when they're like
03:27 - they like know things so you know that
03:29 - so I'm just going to it with an open
03:32 - mind be prepared by you know maybe
03:35 - testing your devices making sure that
03:38 - whatever activity you've decided to do
03:39 - works on all your devices but other than
03:41 - that there's nothing you know that you
03:44 - need to know specifically about computer
03:45 - science to do the hour of code totally
03:48 - um
03:49 - so without with that I'm gonna let
03:51 - Hannah take over she's gonna show you
03:52 - how to get stupid with bubble not
03:56 - required that you stop a class in
03:59 - codable but we do recommend it because
04:02 - it's gonna make it easier for you going
04:03 - beyond the hour of code and also to
04:05 - track student progress and share
04:07 - certificates so I'm gonna let Hannah
04:09 - take over great I'm just gonna share our
04:11 - screen and real quick
04:20 - and kind of go ahead in Lagos and
04:26 - decodable awesome do you want to be
04:31 - logged in as yourself or do you want is
04:32 - it okay if you use mine yeah that's
04:34 - totally fine okay you guys are seeing
04:37 - how many accounts I okay awesome so yeah
04:42 - like Gretchen had just mentioned you do
04:45 - not need to have a codable account setup
04:48 - in order to do the hour of code but we
04:49 - recommend it for all the reasons that
04:52 - she had just mentioned and I'll just
04:53 - show you really quick how easy it is to
04:55 - add a class if that is something you're
04:57 - interested in doing before starting the
04:58 - hour of code it'll just take a couple
05:00 - minutes so you can see here we're on the
05:04 - class creation page I'm just going to
05:06 - click this big blue button that says add
05:08 - class and the first step is to name your
05:11 - class so I'm just going to name it our
05:14 - code webinar for now you can continue or
05:18 - if you need to add multiple classes
05:20 - there's also this option here this blue
05:23 - button so if that's if you have multiple
05:25 - classes you want to add at once it's
05:26 - super easy to do that you can just click
05:28 - the need to add multiple classes button
05:30 - for this demo I'm just gonna add one
05:33 - class so I've pressed to continue now
05:36 - it's time to add my students so I'm just
05:38 - going to add one name per line you do
05:43 - not need to manually enter all of these
05:45 - names if you have your students name
05:47 - saved in some sort of a list or a
05:50 - spreadsheet you can copy and paste them
05:52 - right here into this area so if these
05:54 - are my students I'm going to save them
05:57 - and move on and we've made this step
06:00 - super easy your students need a class
06:02 - code to play to log into codable the
06:05 - class code is sort of like a class
06:07 - password and we've generated a class
06:10 - password for your class here you can
06:12 - always change this later but just to
06:15 - keep it simple we've given you one to
06:17 - start so you can just click continue
06:19 - that's the code that your students will
06:21 - use to log in and they're customizing
06:24 - our class so we will just wait a second
06:31 - customizing awesome so then we have this
06:34 - option to invite parents to follow
06:36 - progress this is one of the huge perks
06:38 - of setting up a class before you do the
06:41 - hour of code this way if you invite
06:44 - parents to follow progress as you move
06:46 - forward with codable parents of your
06:48 - students will be able to see what
06:50 - they're learning and how they're
06:52 - learning it so you can really easily
06:54 - print these invitations for the parents
06:58 - of your students and this will be a
07:00 - letter that you can print off I wonder
07:02 - if I can show maybe I can't but this
07:06 - will be a letter that you can print off
07:07 - and give out to your students to take
07:10 - home and it's just a little description
07:12 - of what students will be doing with
07:14 - codable so a great way to keep parents
07:16 - informed but we're all done setting up
07:18 - the class that was super easy we're
07:19 - gonna go to our class come and now
07:21 - you're logged into your codable
07:24 - dashboard so those were all the steps
07:26 - you need to take to set up a class with
07:28 - codable again it's a great way to be
07:31 - able to track student progress and keep
07:32 - parents informed your class code that
07:34 - you created that your students will need
07:36 - to log in is just there at the top so
07:38 - you'll never lose it it's right there
07:40 - front and center and I do just want to
07:43 - mention quickly that classes have a cap
07:45 - of 50 students but you can have
07:49 - unlimited classes even with the free
07:51 - teacher account so there's really an
07:54 - unlimited number of students that you
07:55 - can set up with a codable accounts we
07:58 - just did a little demo of five but you
08:01 - can have unlimited since there is
08:03 - unlimited classes with color ball
08:05 - um so now that you've gotten all set up
08:07 - with your teacher account I'm gonna pass
08:08 - it back off to Gretchen and she'll go
08:11 - over how to get your students set up
08:14 - with codable in the hour of code yeah
08:17 - yay okay so I just I just want to let
08:22 - you guys know just reiterate what the
08:24 - Hana said we you do not have to set up a
08:27 - class I'm gonna show you how you can do
08:30 - it with and without a class that's
08:32 - already set up but it is beneficial to
08:37 - have your class set up ahead of time now
08:39 - I just want to quickly pause for
08:42 - questions in case any
08:43 - one has anything we've got on the side
08:48 - over here there's a little chat window
08:50 - you guys feel free to share questions
08:55 - share tips anything that occurs to you
08:59 - while we're going through all of this
09:00 - we've got Bri I'm sure many of you have
09:02 - met for your heard from Bri at some
09:04 - point in your lives with go to bed she's
09:07 - here responding to all of your questions
09:09 - so if you have anything please feel free
09:13 - to post them there it looks like we're
09:16 - okay for right now no questions but I'm
09:19 - going to so I'm going to go ahead and go
09:20 - through how to get set up so um I'm
09:24 - going to go to codable comm slash our -
09:30 - of - code and this is our our code home
09:34 - page so everything basically everything
09:37 - that we're going to talk about today is
09:38 - accessible from this page so to start
09:42 - off this is how your students are going
09:45 - to get set up so we're gonna go to kids
09:47 - start here and if they're use if you're
09:51 - using a class code you can enter it here
09:55 - or if you want your kids to be able to
09:58 - log in without needing a class code they
10:01 - can do that here so play without saving
10:04 - and that's going to create an anonymous
10:06 - profile for them they can play and then
10:09 - they can leave later they keep well they
10:13 - will have the option to write down their
10:17 - code to enter at home if they want to
10:20 - play continue playing at home but for
10:22 - the most part it's basically unsaved
10:25 - information so that's useful if you
10:28 - don't have the time or don't want to set
10:30 - up a class code with or an account with
10:31 - codable if you do have a class code I'm
10:34 - just gonna go ahead and use the class
10:36 - code that Hannah set up it's alright
10:47 - next okay I'm gonna play with myself
10:57 - all righty so it's super simple your
11:01 - students will see the roster pop up in
11:03 - front of them you've got two new buzzes
11:07 - and we're gonna start by building our
11:09 - first buzz so this is blue buzz adding
11:24 - all the properties of our new fuzz okay
11:27 - and now we've landed on fuzz topia and
11:30 - this is the home of the fuzz family your
11:33 - kids are going to unlock their mission
11:35 - control but we're actually going to go
11:41 - back to the Sofia's and click the home
11:44 - and we want to go to the hour of code
11:47 - Hut so it's right here this is where we
11:50 - can find art codable our code activities
11:56 - so we've got three here to choose from
11:58 - we're gonna talk about the maze maker
12:01 - challenge and the character the fuzz
12:04 - builder challenge later but we're gonna
12:06 - start out with the beach cleanup
12:08 - activity I know
12:10 - so before I get into this activity I
12:12 - want to make sure to address some of the
12:15 - questions you guys had about setting up
12:16 - devices so we're in the activity right
12:19 - now but I'm logged in on the web and you
12:23 - guys saw how to do that it's super
12:25 - simple but you should try this on your
12:28 - computers that you're gonna be using at
12:30 - school before it's a classroom full of
12:33 - kids there are sometimes URLs that need
12:38 - to be white listed perhaps your what's
12:43 - the word I'm looking for your privacy
12:45 - setting I'm alone allow you access if
12:48 - your firewall won't thank you won't
12:49 - allow access in decodable so be sure to
12:52 - double check that everything is working
12:54 - if you have any issues when you're
12:56 - trying it out for the first time you can
12:59 - email us at support at codable calm and
13:02 - someone from our team can help you
13:04 - through all of that and make sure it's
13:06 - all up and running for you and just
13:08 - double-check that it's all ready to go
13:10 - before you get your kids in the
13:12 - classroom the day of the other thing is
13:15 - if you're going to be using codable on
13:16 - ipads the setup process is the same like
13:19 - the student login process is the same
13:22 - the only difference is you're going to
13:23 - want to make sure you have the latest
13:25 - version of codable installed on your
13:27 - iPad's ahead of time previous versions
13:30 - did not have this activity they did not
13:33 - have the hour of code hut so you need to
13:35 - make sure you're updated to the latest
13:36 - version before the day of other than
13:40 - that it's super simple you can enter
13:42 - your student your class code or you can
13:45 - use the play without saving option on
13:47 - any device okay
13:50 - so then I'm going to go ahead and go
13:52 - into the activity oh wait we do have a
13:58 - question here so someone in our RSVP
14:04 - link asked how can I use codable for two
14:08 - grade levels without needing a login or
14:10 - password for each individual student
14:12 - I'll be doing the our code presentation
14:14 - style where I have one grade level which
14:16 - each with their own iPad at the same
14:19 - time so it sounds like you're gonna be
14:22 - sharing devices a little bit maybe two
14:25 - students per device so what I would
14:28 - suggest is using you know if you want to
14:32 - set up a class you can we went through
14:34 - how easy that is but if you decide you
14:36 - don't want to use that play without
14:38 - saving option that is available on the
14:40 - iPad and what I would suggest is having
14:45 - kids take turns being the driver doing a
14:47 - little pair programming which is just
14:50 - two kids on a device working together to
14:52 - solve problems and one will be the
14:55 - driver and one will be you know the
14:57 - assistant and then after they've
14:58 - completed a level then they can switch
15:00 - that works really well with groups of
15:03 - kids or if you have it doesn't say what
15:08 - grade you're gonna be working with but
15:09 - if you have kids say you have you know
15:11 - kindergarteners and fifth graders or if
15:14 - you have a large you know age gap but
15:16 - you're the two grades you're working
15:17 - with it's really fun to have one be the
15:19 - teacher and one be you know the the
15:22 - learner we get a lot of during the our
15:26 - code we get a lot of schools who send us
15:27 - you know exciting photos and videos of
15:30 - their fifth graders teaching their
15:31 - kindergartners which is so much fun um
15:34 - under a couple and quickly add gudgeon
15:37 - we'll go over the activity in just a
15:39 - second but there is an unlimited number
15:41 - of levels that you can play with this
15:43 - beach cleanup hour of code activity so
15:45 - you don't need to worry about one
15:47 - student running out of levels the other
15:48 - student is the driver if they're sharing
15:50 - a device um there's unlimited levels so
15:53 - that won't be yeah all right so we're
15:56 - gonna hop into the beach cleanup
15:58 - activity real quick um so this is going
16:03 - to this is a quick video I've linked to
16:05 - these videos in the agenda that sent out
16:09 - to you all we're gonna add the links to
16:11 - the video description or so anytime oh
16:14 - it's already there it's in the video
16:15 - description on YouTube um if you want to
16:18 - play these ahead of time for your kids
16:20 - to make sure that they know what they're
16:22 - getting into or if you want to instruct
16:25 - them on how to play the beach cleanup
16:27 - you can do that also but these are a
16:29 - quick video from Hannah just walking
16:31 - them through how to play and what
16:34 - concepts they're gonna be learning I'm
16:37 - gonna skip it for now because you just
16:39 - can watch it um so we're gonna hit play
16:41 - now these little guys here are our sea
16:45 - creatures that we're trying to rescue
16:47 - from all the garbage on the on the beach
16:49 - in fuzzy Opia and when your students
16:53 - earn enough points so when they recycle
16:56 - enough items so they recycle 12 items 30
16:58 - items or 50 items then their little sea
17:02 - creature friend can come in live on post
17:04 - topia on their beach super cute we love
17:07 - them her designers Greg did an amazing
17:10 - job
17:10 - uh so I'm gonna go ahead and play it so
17:14 - there's three difficulty levels to
17:16 - choose from there's easy which gives
17:20 - them you know one one reward per piece
17:23 - of item or per seat per piece of trash
17:25 - and that's gonna include sequencing and
17:29 - conditions
17:30 - there's medium which doubles the rewards
17:33 - per item and that includes sequencing
17:37 - conditions and loops and then there's
17:39 - hard and that includes sequencing
17:42 - conditions loops and functions there is
17:45 - a video for each of these difficulty
17:47 - levels that explains the concepts that
17:49 - the kids are going to be doing I would
17:51 - suggest starting everyone and easy and
17:52 - then if they feel they're ready for
17:55 - something more difficult and more
17:57 - challenging encourage them to bump up to
17:59 - medium or hard we're gonna start uneasy
18:05 - so you're suppose buzz great so we need
18:09 - to draw the path for blue buzz to follow
18:12 - to collect all of the garbage here's our
18:15 - tutorial video explaining what
18:17 - sequencing and conditions are this is
18:19 - from Hannah again this is linked in the
18:21 - video description on YouTube we're gonna
18:25 - skip it for right now
18:26 - so I need to draw a path that lets me
18:32 - get to all of these route little
18:34 - recycling symbols okay so and I cannot
18:38 - draw through these items I can't draw
18:41 - through the surfboard I can't draw
18:42 - through the Sandcastle and it can't draw
18:45 - through my creatures so what I'm gonna
18:47 - do I think my best option is just start
18:54 - down here what do you think Hannah start
18:57 - up here or start down here
18:58 - I love it cuz there is a little tricky
19:00 - um even for us too so it's a good I'm
19:03 - starting down here yep okay yeah so
19:15 - Gretchen is just drawing the path that
19:16 - will connect all of the recycling
19:20 - symbols and then get to the end it'll
19:23 - show up with the little start button and
19:26 - finish button those tiles will
19:28 - automatically appear when you've clicked
19:29 - on any of the squares on either side of
19:32 - the columns okay so I'm gonna hit play
19:37 - great so now I need to program my buzz
19:40 - to get through this maze to the end and
19:43 - recycle all that see the trash around
19:45 - are a little secret you're under a
19:47 - little seal friend here so I'm going to
19:50 - look forward and up into the right but
19:54 - oh it looks like I need to edit my maze
19:58 - because I missed one of my recycling
20:02 - symbols so I'm gonna try again and this
20:06 - time I'm going to use a condition and
20:09 - the condition is if-then logic so it's
20:13 - saying if this tile is pink then I want
20:16 - to go right so I can use conditions to
20:20 - make turns I can use conditions as
20:22 - exceptions to a rule like in programming
20:26 - so I'm gonna say forward up if pink
20:30 - bingo right I'm going to go back I'm
20:34 - gonna go up right I hope I have enough
20:40 - space no I don't know I don't think I do
20:42 - okay let's try again let's see what
20:46 - happens
20:52 - well yep so you guys can see I ran out
20:58 - of space here so this is again a great
21:01 - way for our kids to be practicing design
21:04 - thinking critical thinking skills and
21:06 - problem solving and to complete their
21:09 - activity so why don't we try this I'm
21:13 - gonna edit my maze and draw this way I'm
21:19 - going to erase hmm
21:37 - all right what do you think Hannah we've
21:40 - got one two three four five six seven
21:45 - eight movin too many all right let's see
21:48 - here hmm think we can make it I don't
22:08 - know it's pretty tough let's see here
22:22 - I'm gonna try this mm-hmm
22:24 - we could also show you how if there is a
22:27 - level that seems so hard how to refresh
22:31 - it oh yeah I won I'll try this one
22:34 - and then we'll see about doing that okay
22:36 - so nope I think that's too many all
22:47 - right we're gonna try getting a new one
22:49 - and see okay so we're just gonna hit
22:56 - play again she was easy I think this one
23:00 - is doable yep okay so we're going to go
23:06 - forward up down right up yeah okay I
23:22 - think this is for sure gonna work we
23:26 - just need our condition here so if green
23:28 - then we're gonna go to the right okay
23:34 - let's go forward up nope nope go back
23:44 - yes green go right nope baby down up
23:51 - right right okay I think the visit what
23:55 - do you think Hannah I think it looks
23:56 - good okay let's give it a shot
24:00 - so then each time the fuzz rolls over
24:03 - the recycling symbol it will pick up the
24:05 - trash and free the sea creature so we
24:12 - got three items we're gonna go ahead I'm
24:15 - gonna try it one more so you guys can
24:17 - see this so this one is gonna go down so
24:34 - you can see when Gretchen is drawing the
24:36 - path there's a lot of different possible
24:39 - solutions so you can encourage your
24:42 - students to get creative try multiple
24:44 - options just because one student would
24:46 - solve it one way no student solve it a
24:48 - different way doesn't mean there's one
24:50 - right or wrong answer which is which is
24:53 - great they can test out multiple
24:54 - possible solutions yeah if I wanted to I
24:56 - could have gone straight here down to
24:58 - this and then down over here in the back
25:00 - there's so many different options okay
25:03 - so I went right okay I think that's
25:14 - anything that's it yeah I need to get a
25:31 - couple more and I can unlock the little
25:34 - shields can live on for sopia with my
25:37 - buzzes um so I'm gonna pause and see if
25:42 - anybody has questions here about the
25:45 - activity it looks like yeah so we have
25:52 - one question that says from Lauren it
25:55 - says to
25:55 - they'll have to use a browser so just to
25:59 - reiterate that if you are using an iOS
26:01 - device you can use the codable app
26:04 - downloaded from the App Store but if you
26:06 - are using any other type of device like
26:09 - a computer you would want to use a web
26:11 - browser and again you can go to the
26:14 - students play button on our hour of code
26:16 - page to find the easy link to the
26:18 - activity so yes if you're playing online
26:21 - on a browser that's the you'll go to the
26:23 - hour of code site and play straight from
26:25 - there not from the app and one thing to
26:28 - clarify is that in so the beach cleanup
26:31 - activity and the hour of code activities
26:33 - are available on the web
26:35 - year-round they are always there you can
26:37 - always go to code Volcom slash our - of
26:40 - - code and get to these activities they
26:43 - are not available year-round on the iPad
26:46 - so after December 20th the beach cleanup
26:50 - activity is going away on the iPad and
26:54 - you won't have access to but if you log
26:57 - in on the web then it will be available
27:00 - year-round so if you guys are doing your
27:02 - hour of code in January then that is the
27:06 - method that I would use to log in if you
27:09 - want to use codable for your hour of
27:11 - code on the iPad you can definitely do
27:15 - that we do have hour of code activities
27:17 - that are not the beach cleanup but the
27:21 - beach cleanup will not be available
27:22 - after December 20th on the iPad it will
27:27 - be available on the way ok great so um
27:32 - do I think that that shows do we what do
27:37 - you want to do one that was a loop and a
27:39 - function do you think we're okay I think
27:40 - it's okay I just to say again when your
27:45 - students choose the different level of
27:47 - difficulty they have an option to watch
27:49 - a tutorial video they don't have to but
27:52 - those videos will pop up whenever they
27:54 - switch their difficulty level and it
27:57 - demonstrates with examples from the game
27:59 - exactly how to do the different types of
28:03 - levels how to use condition tiles like
28:04 - Gretchen used how do you
28:06 - loop and how to use a function so if
28:07 - you're looking at this and you're
28:09 - thinking I don't know how to explain how
28:12 - to use a condition tile to my students
28:15 - they have an option to watch that video
28:17 - and I'm about to go over our lesson plan
28:20 - with you so you can see exactly how easy
28:23 - it is to explain these different coding
28:25 - concepts from our code but if you want
28:28 - to see how those different how loops and
28:30 - functions will be used in the game you
28:32 - can play yourself of course or you can
28:34 - watch those tutorial videos it explains
28:36 - everything yep
28:38 - I'm gonna quickly address one of the
28:40 - questions that we've gotten about this
28:42 - so um one question that we had was you
28:46 - know someone is asking why isn't it
28:47 - working my maze don't let me hit play
28:50 - it's muted it's it's grayed out and you
28:54 - want to make sure that you're going
28:55 - directly to your recycle symbols so if I
28:58 - were to do this and try and draw through
29:01 - my turtle here that does not work that's
29:04 - gonna see the the program is gonna see
29:07 - that as an incomplete maze so what you
29:10 - want to do is draw around them so that
29:14 - you can connect all the parts of your
29:15 - maze and another way you could go um
29:19 - that's how the the program is gonna see
29:23 - that it's a completed maze these guys
29:24 - are working as obstacles to make it a
29:28 - little bit more challenging now the
29:32 - other question that I've gotten is okay
29:36 - my my recycling symbols are all
29:38 - connected but I don't have a starting
29:40 - into my maze so if you if I were to
29:43 - erase this right and I just started
29:46 - drawing here
29:47 - um codable simpsons when you draw a path
29:51 - on either the right hand side or the
29:55 - left hand side of the main of the maze
29:57 - so it's gonna automatically create your
29:59 - start tile and when I connect this to
30:02 - the end to the to the right hand side
30:05 - here it's gonna automatically make my in
30:07 - tile so if I wanted to move that I can
30:08 - move my end all around anything that
30:11 - appears in this right hand column or
30:14 - this left hand column is going to be
30:16 - either a start or an end okay
30:19 - yeah so that's covering the activity I'm
30:23 - gonna let I'm note let Hannah take over
30:25 - and go over the lesson plan with you
30:28 - awesome mm-hmm
30:30 - great Thank You fetchin um so I'm gonna
30:34 - dive into showing you the lesson plan
30:37 - that we've created to go along with the
30:39 - beach cleanup activity please continue
30:41 - to write in questions if you have any
30:43 - throughout the description of the lesson
30:45 - plan we're happy to answer them so I am
30:48 - finding the lesson plan on the same
30:51 - website our hour of code website that we
30:55 - just access the game from so everything
30:57 - is in one place we're gonna go to the
30:59 - codable beach cleanup activity and I'm
31:01 - going to click on the orange view lesson
31:04 - plan this is linking to our lesson plan
31:07 - from our codable dashboard but again you
31:10 - do not but again you do not need to have
31:15 - a codable account in order to access
31:16 - this lesson plan it's available for
31:18 - everyone so this is the lesson plan okay
31:24 - fortunately help me find my mouse up
31:26 - here yeah you got a real thank you so
31:29 - this is the beach cleanup of codable
31:32 - lesson plan it's organized the same way
31:35 - that our other lesson plans are but if
31:37 - you haven't seen those plans before
31:39 - that's okay and here's just an overview
31:41 - of what you can find in the lesson so we
31:44 - always start out with our objectives
31:46 - what students will be able to do and the
31:48 - standards that they accompany the
31:51 - objectives then we go over a list of the
31:54 - lesson materials now I've tried to
31:57 - include absolutely everything you could
31:58 - need in this lesson materials list but
32:01 - there will also be a few links
32:03 - throughout the lesson plan if you don't
32:05 - want to download all the resources at
32:07 - the start but I will just point out that
32:09 - all of these different worksheets are
32:12 - linked directly here from the lesson
32:14 - plan so this lesson comes with different
32:18 - unplugged worksheets for students to
32:21 - work on the hour of code certificates
32:23 - that you can print off when students are
32:24 - done as well as all of those beach
32:27 - cleanup tutorial videos that we have
32:30 - been talking about
32:32 - we go over the vocabulary and then we
32:34 - dive into the direct instruction now for
32:38 - our lesson plan we've scripted out what
32:41 - you could say in order to introduce the
32:43 - hour of code and this activity of course
32:46 - if you don't want to follow this script
32:48 - that is completely okay we just want to
32:50 - have this here in case you are looking
32:51 - for some extra support so it starts with
32:54 - an introduction to the hour of code and
32:56 - then an introduction to the beach
32:59 - cleanup activity specifically why ocean
33:02 - life and ocean health is important
33:04 - a little think-pair-share we've included
33:07 - some different videos and articles here
33:10 - if you want to set up more of a context
33:14 - for your students about why protecting
33:16 - marine life from pollution is an
33:17 - important problem to tackle so these are
33:20 - here for you and the different grade
33:22 - levels that we recommend for those
33:24 - resources
33:25 - now we dive into the beach cleanup
33:28 - activity itself we script out different
33:30 - ways to introduce the activity as well
33:33 - as link all those videos that you would
33:35 - find in the actual activity they're
33:38 - linked here in the lesson plan as well
33:40 - so again you can introduce the different
33:44 - difficulty levels you might say for if
33:47 - you're just teaching like a fourth grade
33:48 - class you might recommend your students
33:50 - all start with medium or hard levels or
33:53 - if you're teaching multiple grades we
33:55 - have all of these the different videos
33:58 - here so you can kind of judge what level
34:01 - your students should start at and
34:03 - there's a couple lesson tips throughout
34:06 - one recommendation I have is if you do
34:09 - have a projector maybe walking through
34:11 - one level together kind of like you just
34:14 - saw a Gretchen do on the webinar just
34:16 - kind of going through the activity
34:18 - projecting it up on a screen if you have
34:20 - that might help kind of set the stage
34:23 - for your students then there's an
34:25 - optional group brainstorm this is an
34:28 - option we've had some people write in
34:30 - asking if we have an unplugged option
34:33 - for this lesson so the activity itself
34:36 - is plugged in but an unplugged option is
34:39 - to do this group brainstorm so these are
34:41 - I'll just click on one example and these
34:44 - are different work
34:45 - that we've put together that helps
34:47 - students brainstorm why ocean and ocean
34:50 - life is important different things that
34:52 - might cause harm to ocean life and then
34:55 - some sort of brainstorm around how
34:57 - technology can be used to solve this
35:00 - problem of ocean pollution and then some
35:04 - different creative options for them to
35:07 - draw or describe what they could invent
35:10 - in order to solve the problem of ocean
35:13 - pollution so let me find my listen again
35:16 - oops there we go
35:21 - so again that was linked just directly
35:23 - in the lesson plan as you made your way
35:26 - down into the optional group brainstorm
35:29 - and then finally the lesson wraps up
35:31 - with a little debrief as well as having
35:34 - students fill out their code at the
35:37 - bottom of the worksheet so that they can
35:39 - if you have set up a class with codable
35:42 - they can take that parent code home and
35:44 - their parent can look at the mazes that
35:46 - they've created and and see their
35:48 - progress as you move forward with
35:49 - codable and so there's little tips down
35:51 - here for how to send that home so that
35:55 - is an overview of the lesson plan I just
35:58 - want to emphasize that this plan can be
36:01 - used for any grade level we've broken
36:04 - down all the different options for like
36:06 - K through first second and third fourth
36:08 - and fifth when it comes time to
36:10 - differentiate for the grade level so
36:12 - there's one lesson plan but
36:14 - modifications for how to use it with
36:16 - different grades cool awesome so I am
36:21 - going to step aside and then Gretchen is
36:24 - going to dive into some of our other
36:26 - hour of code activities that are
36:28 - available from our hour of code page in
36:32 - case you want something different from
36:34 - be beach cleanup activity yeah so if if
36:38 - any of you guys follow our blog I did a
36:40 - post a couple weeks ago about four ways
36:42 - you can do the hour of code one
36:44 - including our beach cleanup but also one
36:46 - of our most popular activities which is
36:48 - our maze maker it's similar to the beach
36:51 - cleanup and that students are going to
36:53 - be creating mazes but we give them
36:55 - prompts so I'll go ahead and open
36:58 - the lesson for you to view that online
37:02 - this is a k25 activity and depending on
37:06 - the age or the grade level that you're
37:09 - working with
37:10 - there are prompts within the maze maker
37:13 - activity to create different shapes that
37:16 - are common core aligned so with a math
37:18 - standard so there's a kindergarten shape
37:23 - there's a first-grade shape second-grade
37:25 - shape and if a student completes all of
37:28 - them than they like beat the entire
37:30 - activity so you can let kids you know
37:34 - even at a kindergarten level start out
37:36 - with this and see how far they go same
37:38 - with a 5th grader if you want to let
37:40 - them start out you know they're gonna
37:41 - get an easy shape and then this getting
37:43 - it more and more difficult challenging
37:45 - for them this is one of our most popular
37:47 - activities it's great for design
37:49 - thinking and every single maze that they
37:52 - draw just like in the maze maker when
37:54 - they draw this maze here or sorry just
37:56 - like in the the beach cleanup activity
37:58 - what they draw a maze then they have to
38:00 - test it and they have to program it so
38:03 - it's not just draw shape its draw shape
38:05 - and then program your Fuzz to go through
38:07 - that shape it's really fun kids can
38:10 - decorate however they want to make their
38:14 - you know customize their maze and add
38:17 - character to it but it's you know I find
38:20 - them self-guided activity for your kids
38:23 - to do and then another option is our
38:28 - build your own size activity again this
38:30 - is another drew student driven activity
38:33 - and what they do they're given a video
38:37 - prompt that says you know has them think
38:40 - about a character or think about
38:43 - themselves or think about you know an
38:45 - imaginary character that they know of
38:47 - that they want to create and what
38:51 - character traits are what physical
38:53 - traits make that character who they are
38:55 - and then they can create that character
38:59 - as a fuzz so this comes with a graphic
39:03 - organizer to design their fuzz on paper
39:08 - then you can go in and see the quotable
39:10 - game and start creating your buzz all of
39:13 - the instructions that you need are
39:16 - included in this lesson here again it's
39:18 - a pretty self-guided activity but if you
39:21 - want to UM take some of it offline and
39:24 - have kids use the the graphic organizer
39:26 - if you can another option that people
39:30 - love is our introduction to programming
39:33 - this is our very like one of our I guess
39:37 - you can call it classic decodable
39:40 - lessons our code lessons this there has
39:45 - a k25 option so there's a there's an
39:48 - option for every single grade level k-25
39:50 - you would just select the grade that you
39:52 - want um so I'm going to select second
39:55 - grade and it's gonna pop up the lesson
39:58 - plan here design for a second grade
40:00 - class and this activity does have a
40:04 - really great unplugged fit so if you
40:06 - don't have devices for the hour of code
40:08 - no worries this would be the lesson plan
40:11 - I would suggest for you because what
40:14 - you're gonna do is work together as a
40:16 - group to program a robot and I say robot
40:19 - encode and quotes because you're gonna
40:22 - choose either a volunteer student or
40:24 - maybe the room parent or another teacher
40:28 - or you can you can be the robot to
40:31 - you're in a program that robot to walk
40:34 - forward turn around and jump and this
40:37 - activity is scaled depending on the
40:39 - grade level that you're working with and
40:41 - in our direct instruction piece we walk
40:44 - you through how to do this unplugged
40:46 - activity together off-screen and there's
40:52 - also sorry it's in the in the guided
40:54 - practice activity and there is there are
40:58 - um quotable levels that go along with
41:02 - these lesson plans they're prescribed
41:05 - levels that go along you can assign
41:07 - those to your class or if you are not
41:11 - working with a quotable class code like
41:14 - you haven't set up a class for your
41:15 - students then you can still play use
41:18 - that
41:18 - say without saving option just put your
41:20 - kids onto codable use the play without
41:22 - saving option and then they can go in
41:24 - and play they're going to be introduced
41:26 - to sequencing that's the first section
41:29 - of levels in codable and that's what
41:31 - we're going over in this activity and
41:34 - then there's a quick check for
41:35 - understanding so this is a really great
41:38 - introduction to programming and
41:40 - introduction to the hour of code and an
41:42 - introduction to codable and what it
41:44 - means to program this would be my
41:47 - recommendation if anyone's looking for a
41:49 - more guided activity where they're doing
41:51 - some more instruction or if they're
41:53 - looking for an unplugged activity this
41:55 - would be my go-to um yeah I think that's
42:00 - oh so one last one that is my favorite
42:03 - that I'm just gonna share with you guys
42:04 - um is our we have several to choose from
42:08 - here if you've been using codable for a
42:10 - while and you've got students who are
42:12 - pretty advanced they're working for like
42:15 - you're working through a progression
42:16 - this unit and there's certain concepts
42:19 - you want to cover we have a an hour of
42:21 - code activity for each of our grade
42:23 - level concepts but another one that I
42:26 - love is our women in tech activity as a
42:29 - third to fifth grade project and it's
42:32 - done over three class periods and it's
42:36 - more like a research activity where kids
42:40 - are tucked you know learning about women
42:42 - and Technology famous women in
42:43 - technology and then writing about them
42:46 - and talking about some gender dynamics
42:51 - within the tech sector so that's a
42:54 - pretty cool lesson also there's several
42:57 - others here I mean you guys can see
42:59 - we've got dozens to choose from but
43:01 - those are some that I wanted to be sure
43:04 - to highlight um do we have I've been
43:08 - waiting in question I don't think I see
43:11 - any that have popped up that BRE has not
43:17 - taken care of oh cool thanks Bri um okay
43:22 - so then I guess we'll just go on to what
43:28 - to expect after the RF code so
43:30 - um if this is your first time I'm doing
43:34 - the art code it's your student's first
43:35 - time programming it's a very exciting
43:37 - day it's an exciting day if they've done
43:39 - it before but it's very exciting if it's
43:41 - their first time everybody's gonna be
43:43 - it's gonna be high energy there's gonna
43:45 - be a lot of exciting things happening so
43:47 - I want to UM you know just tell you to
43:51 - like lean into that enjoy it soak it up
43:54 - because I know you guys are always
43:55 - looking for ways to engage your students
43:57 - this is one of the best ways to do it um
43:59 - its speaking their language or using
44:02 - technology but it's also introducing
44:04 - them to a way of thinking that sometimes
44:07 - we miss in our you know Twitter century
44:09 - lives where we're just consuming all of
44:12 - this information using technology every
44:14 - minute of every day but not really
44:15 - thinking about what goes into creating
44:17 - that technology um so this is a great
44:21 - opportunity to do that with your
44:22 - students have those conversations with
44:24 - them and then afterward celebrate
44:27 - everything that they've achieved
44:28 - recognize you know if there was a
44:30 - student who was really struggling you
44:32 - know maybe to overcome this a tough
44:34 - level and then they did it you know
44:36 - recognize them if there were kids who
44:39 - are really working together pair
44:41 - programming and doing a great job
44:42 - recognize them
44:44 - we have certificates for you to give out
44:47 - to your students they're here on our
44:50 - hour of code page you enter your email
44:52 - address we're gonna send you this empty
44:56 - certificate for you to print out and you
44:58 - can you know write a student names in or
45:00 - if you have a class set up in codable on
45:04 - your codable dashboard we're updating
45:07 - the dashboard this week with the option
45:11 - have prefilled lessons so whenever
45:12 - student profile names you put in it's
45:15 - gonna pre fill their names here for
45:17 - their certificate then you can just
45:19 - print off all of them and give them to
45:21 - them so they're gonna already have their
45:22 - information on them um it'll save you a
45:25 - ton of time writing student names in and
45:29 - then be sure to share you know if
45:33 - students create mazes or if they create
45:35 - characters during the hours code you can
45:38 - share that with their family so that's
45:40 - another great reason to have it
45:43 - can't set up and have a class set up
45:45 - because I can invite parents to connect
45:48 - with my class right here so I know my my
45:55 - parents email address I'm going to
45:56 - invite them and I'm gonna send them an
45:59 - invitation to join the class it's gonna
46:00 - send them an email just saying hey you
46:04 - know hannah has invited you to follow
46:07 - Gretchen's progress in codable here's
46:11 - the link to do that
46:12 - they can follow progress for free if
46:14 - they decide that they want to like say
46:16 - you guys do the hour of code in December
46:19 - but you guys aren't planning on
46:20 - continuing with coding beyond that and
46:23 - parents you know say that their kids are
46:25 - really into it um they have the option
46:29 - to continue with a parent account and at
46:31 - home and they get that information when
46:35 - you send this invitation to them it is
46:37 - optional and it's not something that's
46:38 - required to follow progress and it's a
46:41 - pretty cool way to help their kids get
46:44 - more exposure to computer science to
46:45 - coding through codable without
46:47 - interfering with what you're doing at
46:49 - school because it is totally different
46:50 - levels it's a totally different
46:52 - experience in the at-home version
46:54 - um the other way that you can send
46:57 - creations home is say I encourage them
47:04 - to show up here no muses I'm gonna go to
47:07 - one of my classes that does have Mazen
47:09 - um so let's see here ain't got a student
47:16 - in here yeah so here we can see a maze
47:24 - that one of my students created and I
47:27 - want to print that and send it home to
47:32 - their family so this is gonna create a
47:34 - quick little handout let me see if I can
47:38 - assure you it's a handout that you can
47:42 - send home with your students um that's
47:44 - gonna let them see the maze that they're
47:47 - a student that their child created so I
47:50 - share this with you here it is
47:56 - um so here you can see this is the
47:57 - little handout that you can send
47:59 - homeless kids and again it's got
48:01 - information if they do want to continue
48:03 - at home there's information about how to
48:05 - do that
48:09 - great yeah um so the last question that
48:13 - I wanted to be sure to address that we
48:15 - got in our we got in our RSVP form was
48:22 - somebody asks and I love this question
48:24 - how do I invest and promote to the
48:27 - outside community ie parents getting
48:30 - them involved so a great opportunity
48:34 - with the hour of code since it's such an
48:37 - exciting day and in such an exciting
48:39 - time is to do a family code night a lot
48:43 - of the schools who use codable through
48:44 - this I love seeing the photos because
48:47 - they're just so precious but it's a
48:49 - great opportunity to get parents
48:50 - involved let them know about what's
48:52 - happening um at your school community
48:55 - that you that you are doing because
48:57 - parents I don't know if you guys know
48:59 - this but ninety percent of parents want
49:01 - their kids learning about computer
49:02 - science they know it's important for
49:04 - their future but they really are not
49:05 - sure like how they as parents can
49:08 - support their kids so this is a great
49:11 - opportunity for you to say hey we're
49:12 - doing this at school come and see all of
49:15 - the learning that's happening and a
49:17 - family KO tonight's a great way to do
49:19 - that we have a post on our on our blog
49:22 - from a couple of years ago a teacher a
49:25 - fantastic teacher who's been doing the
49:27 - hour of code as long as we have wrote a
49:30 - nice blog post about how he did his
49:33 - family coat night I've seen others
49:36 - communities do it a great way to boost
49:40 - attendance is to offer free pizza I have
49:44 - learned that for everyone loves free
49:45 - right everyone likes pizza so 100%
49:47 - attendance is one of the claims from a
49:51 - group that did 100 that did free pizza
49:53 - so that's really exciting so that's a
49:56 - great way to if your if your school is
49:58 - willing to invest in getting your parent
50:01 - community involved in coding that's a
50:04 - great way to do it
50:06 - but then in addition to that there's
50:08 - also
50:09 - sending home the materials like we like
50:12 - we just went over so I'm gonna let
50:15 - Hannah quickly go over some things you
50:17 - can do beyond the hour of code yes um I
50:20 - want to make sure we don't run yeah I
50:22 - want to run out of time thank you yeah
50:24 - so what I'll say is on your codable the
50:28 - teacher dashboard should I should I open
50:31 - back up to things let's do this I'm I'm
50:34 - going to reshare my screen just so you
50:40 - can see great so great
50:49 - um so on your teacher dashboard that
50:52 - we've been showing before I just want to
50:56 - point out that there is so much rich
50:57 - information on this dashboard if after
51:00 - the hour of code you're interested in
51:02 - learning more about codable but you want
51:04 - to use it in your classroom you're not
51:06 - quite sure where to start your teacher
51:09 - dashboard is full of awesome information
51:10 - for you so I'm just gonna point out a
51:12 - couple things really quick if you have
51:14 - questions about your dashboard or
51:16 - anything codable related there's always
51:18 - this little yellow speech bubble in the
51:20 - bottom right hand corner that is a
51:22 - direct chat to me so if you have
51:24 - questions about codable please feel free
51:26 - to reach out since i know this is gonna
51:29 - be pretty fast so I just want to draw
51:32 - your attention to the teacher guide if
51:34 - you are interested in learning more
51:36 - about what codable teaches the actual
51:39 - concepts it covers as well as all the
51:42 - different worlds there's three worlds
51:44 - and codable a lot of people aren't aware
51:46 - of some of these later worlds for the
51:48 - higher grades so this guide goes over
51:51 - everything with the game as well as how
51:54 - to use codable in your classroom how to
51:57 - teach with it in different
51:57 - recommendations for structuring lessons
52:00 - if that's something that you are looking
52:02 - for so again that that codable field
52:05 - guide on the dashboard is a great place
52:07 - to start also on the dashboard in the
52:10 - upper left hand corner we have our
52:12 - Resource Center and if you haven't
52:14 - checked out the Resource Center I highly
52:15 - recommend you do so we have
52:17 - Serkis for the first couple of first
52:20 - levels in Snee borg the first world that
52:22 - students will play in codable as well as
52:24 - different guides like overall the coding
52:27 - concepts videos for you and classroom
52:29 - materials so those are just two two
52:34 - resources that i recommend starting with
52:37 - there are a lot of other tabs here at
52:40 - the top that i'm not going to dive into
52:41 - right now i want to make sure we have
52:43 - time for questions but i recommend
52:46 - giving those a look it's different ways
52:48 - that you can kind of construct your
52:50 - class control the pacing of the levels
52:53 - if you choose to move forward with
52:55 - codable so you know if there are code
52:58 - goes really well say in next week they
52:59 - want to do a follow on lesson yeah where
53:03 - should they start what should be would
53:05 - be their first step yeah so if the if
53:07 - the hour of code goes really well and
53:09 - you'd like to move forward with codable
53:12 - if you have this class code your
53:15 - students will be all set up to start
53:18 - coding with codable right off the bat
53:20 - and they would just need to enter their
53:22 - class code either in the app or on the
53:25 - web at game doc audible.com the first
53:28 - level that they will see is I'm in the
53:31 - assignments tab right here the first
53:33 - level they will see is one two three
53:35 - role in sequence sector and I just want
53:39 - to say for these level assignments all
53:42 - students will be recommended to start
53:44 - with this first level regardless of
53:47 - their grade or their age they're all
53:50 - going to start in the same place to make
53:52 - sure they build that foundational
53:54 - knowledge so if you just want them to
53:57 - jump into it you can have them log into
53:59 - codable and it will automatically start
54:01 - them on this first level now if you want
54:05 - to see what that level is all about you
54:09 - can go to what it's called teacher demo
54:13 - mode here on the Left teacher demo mode
54:16 - is codable unlocked so you can see
54:19 - everything your students see in the game
54:21 - without ever leaving your dashboard so
54:24 - you can log into teacher demo mode and
54:27 - play that first level that your students
54:30 - would play as well
54:31 - and that's where we recommend starting
54:34 - and if they want to support this dislike
54:37 - student activity you know these levels
54:39 - with a lesson what lesson goes with
54:42 - these yeah so in the oak do you want to
54:46 - point something son maybe go from there
54:48 - class really easier - yeah so if you're
54:52 - already you've chosen your class you can
54:55 - go to your lessons tab the lessons tab
54:58 - is going to map out all the different
55:00 - lessons that accompany the game levels
55:03 - I'm in codable so for this introduction
55:07 - if you're like I want to do my first
55:09 - lesson after the hour of code you can go
55:12 - to unit one and go to the very first
55:14 - lesson introduction and this lesson is
55:17 - available for everyone whether you have
55:19 - a free teacher account or a paid account
55:21 - and this would be a great follow up
55:24 - lesson to the hour of code I mean kind
55:27 - of introduces computer science what
55:29 - programming and a programmer is kind of
55:32 - gives some basic vocabulary like
55:34 - sequence and then at the bottom it shows
55:37 - you the first level of codable that
55:41 - accompanies the introductory lesson so
55:45 - that would be a great place to start
55:47 - again I found it from going to my
55:48 - lessons tab and just clicking on the
55:51 - very first introductory lesson awesome
55:53 - thank you so much yeah of course okay so
55:55 - we're about at a time and I just want to
55:58 - take this time to let anyone ask
56:00 - questions if they have them here in the
56:03 - chat window um let's see we run through
56:09 - some of the questions that we got see if
56:10 - we answered all of them so um be covered
56:15 - Oh someone asked well kids get
56:24 - certificates we covered that you can
56:26 - access the certificates on the our code
56:28 - page how many levels it's a limited
56:33 - levels if you have a quotable
56:39 - subscription already through your school
56:41 - you can access all of this just like
56:43 - weeds later
56:45 - here if you're on a free plan again you
56:47 - can access all of it just like we've
56:49 - laid it out here it does not matter
56:50 - whether you're on a free plan or a paid
56:52 - plan this is this is accessible from the
56:56 - hour of code page so the code org slash
56:58 - learn page codable is listed there but
57:01 - again if you're planning on using code
57:03 - well I would suggest is going to
57:05 - quotable calm slash our - oddish code
57:09 - one question that we got that we were
57:12 - honestly we needed a little bit more
57:15 - context to answer was how to motivate a
57:18 - child who doesn't want to think during
57:19 - the coding and I think that this this
57:23 - could be we can and I went back and
57:24 - forth actually quite a bit on what this
57:27 - could possibly mean and we had several
57:29 - ideas maybe that you know kids a little
57:32 - bit afraid to make a mistake that's
57:34 - something that I often see and was
57:36 - thinking maybe they're you know over
57:39 - achieved and they're a little bit you
57:40 - know being bored and need to be
57:41 - challenged a little bit more this is
57:44 - something that I don't think is specific
57:46 - to the hour of code so we've put
57:49 - together a quick poll if this is
57:51 - something that you think you'd be
57:52 - interested in learning more about I'm
57:55 - gonna put the link to the poll we are
57:59 - considering doing a webinar on this
58:07 - specific activity so I'm just going to
58:11 - pull up that link and post it in the
58:15 - video description below if it's
58:17 - something that you want to do go ahead
58:18 - and click on that poll and let us know
58:21 - yes or no if it's something you want to
58:23 - learn more about hmm are there any other
58:28 - questions you know myself
58:31 - yeah um not too many others there was
58:34 - just one question will this be suitable
58:36 - for ela learners um I do just want to
58:40 - emphasize that code of actual levels for
58:42 - the beach cleanup activity as well as
58:44 - the Mays sneaker and the buzz builder
58:46 - they're not it's not necessary to be
58:49 - able to read at all a lot of those
58:51 - activities or all of them are designed
58:52 - to be accessible for a pre reader or
58:55 - really students but the tutorial videos
58:58 - that we
58:59 - have are in English so that's just
59:01 - something to be aware of but if you have
59:04 - ela students I definitely recommend
59:06 - giving the the beach clean up the maze
59:08 - maker and the other hour of code
59:10 - activities a try they're designed to be
59:12 - able to use you can draw the mazes and
59:15 - do the coding without needing to know
59:19 - English or be a reader at all um so
59:22 - that's just one thing to point out there
59:27 - weren't any others I'm Gretchen is just
59:31 - posting a survey about the webinar for
59:34 - how to motivate students with coding so
59:36 - again if you're interested in exploring
59:39 - that some more definitely click on that
59:45 - okay I think those I think we touched on
59:48 - all the other questions if any other
59:50 - questions come up please write in to us
59:53 - support by protocol again there was a
59:56 - little bubble on your teacher dashboard
59:58 - that that goes to me so happy is there
60:01 - any other questions you might have
60:01 - leading up to the our code yay thank you
60:04 - so much for watching
60:05 - we've really enjoyed all of this again
60:07 - we're so excited for their good please
60:09 - send us with us send us all of the
60:12 - videos and pictures and everything you
60:15 - capture during the week up if you're
60:17 - able to we love seeing that stuff
60:19 - honestly we live for this week it's so
60:23 - exciting for us um okay thank you so
60:25 - much thank you bye bye
