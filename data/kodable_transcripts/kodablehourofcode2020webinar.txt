00:02 - hi everyone
00:04 - happy hour of code my name is gretchen
00:06 - hebner
00:07 - and this is hannah boston uh we're two
00:10 - members of the codable team uh and we
00:13 - are so excited
00:15 - to bring you the hour of code webinar
00:18 - we're going to go over all the things
00:20 - that you i'm sorry
00:23 - we're going to go over all the things
00:25 - that you need to do
00:27 - to prepare for the hour of code this
00:29 - year um
00:30 - so i am one of the founders of codable
00:34 - uh this is my i guess
00:38 - seventh hour of code hooray yay uh
00:41 - hannah is uh newer to the codable team
00:45 - than seven years ago but she's not she
00:47 - is a veteran
00:48 - hour of coder um hannah do you want to
00:51 - introduce yourself a little bit tell us
00:52 - a little bit about what you do at
00:53 - codable
00:54 - sure so i am the instructional designer
00:56 - and coach at codable so my
00:58 - main role is supporting you guys the
01:00 - teachers
01:01 - creating teacher guides videos anything
01:03 - that you need to
01:04 - do to feel confident teaching coding
01:06 - with your elementary students
01:08 - and lately i've been making a lot of our
01:10 - student facing videos
01:12 - so the videos you might watch to prep
01:14 - for the hour of code
01:15 - i helped to create those so if you guys
01:17 - have any questions
01:19 - recommendations for future videos lesson
01:21 - plans worksheets anything like that
01:23 - that's what i'm working on so yeah i'm
01:25 - really excited for the hour of code this
01:26 - year it's going to be a good one
01:28 - yeah yeah it's going to be great even
01:30 - though it might be a little bit
01:31 - different
01:32 - a lot of you submitted questions asking
01:34 - about
01:36 - how to participate in the hour of code
01:38 - virtually or in a hybrid model
01:40 - because things are wild right now
01:43 - everybody is in a different situation so
01:45 - we're going to talk a lot about ways
01:48 - that you can do
01:49 - the hour of code virtually with your
01:50 - students or practicing social distancing
01:53 - uh and what have you uh so with that i'm
01:56 - gonna hop
01:56 - into the agenda just tell you guys a
01:58 - little bit about what we're gonna cover
01:59 - today so
02:00 - first and foremost we're gonna start off
02:02 - strong talking about how to do the hour
02:04 - of code during a pandemic
02:06 - um and we'll get into how to prepare
02:10 - uh and this is the same whether you are
02:12 - in person
02:13 - or uh teaching virtually what you need
02:16 - to do to prepare
02:17 - uh to teach with your students um what
02:20 - will students be doing so we'll go over
02:21 - some of the
02:22 - tutorials we'll go over how to log them
02:24 - in uh or how to tell them to log in if
02:27 - they're
02:27 - doing that from home uh then we'll talk
02:30 - a little bit about how to recognize
02:32 - their achievements some of the different
02:33 - things that you can see on your teacher
02:35 - dashboard
02:36 - after the hour of code is completed and
02:39 - how you can recognize them uh we'll go
02:42 - over some
02:43 - more of our virtual learning tools and
02:45 - these aren't specific to the hour of
02:47 - code these are
02:48 - just tools that you can use uh you know
02:51 - to use codeable but they are
02:52 - very helpful for the hour of code so we
02:55 - went over them a little bit in our back
02:56 - to school webinar if any of you
02:58 - were at that um but we wanted to be sure
03:02 - to mention all of them here again today
03:05 - and then we have
03:06 - a set of we have set aside some time at
03:09 - the end of the
03:10 - webinar for uh questions and answers
03:13 - some of you guys posted questions
03:15 - but we will also be taking questions
03:17 - from the audience so there's a little
03:18 - chat window
03:19 - over on the right hand side of the video
03:22 - and you can post your questions there
03:24 - brie gray is our um
03:28 - director of customer success she is
03:29 - hanging out in the
03:31 - chat answering all of your questions she
03:33 - is the best person to answer questions
03:36 - uh so she will get to them as quickly as
03:39 - she can if she doesn't get to it we'll
03:40 - talk about it on air
03:42 - um and there there's also an agenda
03:45 - floating around we sent it in the email
03:49 - and there's just helpful
03:52 - resources in there everything that we
03:54 - post and talk about today is covered in
03:56 - that agenda so
03:58 - um if you are like oh no i need that
04:00 - link you can go to the agenda and find
04:02 - the link so
04:03 - uh but we'll also post some links in the
04:05 - chat all right
04:06 - with that i'm going to hop into
04:10 - um what to do
04:13 - during the hour of code during pandemic
04:17 - okay so um the hour of code is a magical
04:22 - moment in every year uh where we talk
04:25 - about
04:26 - the importance of learning to code we
04:28 - introduce what coding is to our students
04:30 - and it's a worldwide event organized by
04:32 - code.org to
04:34 - um just get kids to try one hour of
04:36 - coding
04:37 - and there's no reason that we can't do
04:39 - this
04:41 - we fully believe in you guys and we've
04:43 - done everything we can to to prepare
04:45 - resources for you to do this virtually
04:46 - if that's what's happening in your
04:48 - school so
04:49 - um you do not need to know how to code
04:52 - to teach an hour of code your students
04:55 - do not need to have any previous coding
04:57 - experience
04:58 - it is designed to be a beginner
05:01 - experience so if this is your first hour
05:03 - of code we've got you
05:05 - you're going to come out of this
05:06 - prepared and if it's your fifth or
05:08 - seventh like me uh welcome back we're so
05:11 - glad to have you so
05:12 - um i will
05:16 - i think that's everything oh i did want
05:18 - to make sure to mention that
05:20 - um the hour of code is an event to
05:24 - honor grace hopper who is a
05:28 - awesome woman and she was an early
05:30 - pioneer in computer science she created
05:32 - the first compiler
05:33 - and every year the hour code is a week
05:36 - long celebration to
05:38 - celebrate her birthday she was born on
05:40 - december 7th and
05:42 - she was an admiral in the u.s navy and
05:44 - she created the first compiler she's
05:46 - also
05:46 - famous for coining the phrase bug
05:49 - because she found a moth
05:50 - in the room sized computer that she was
05:55 - working on
05:55 - uh and it was causing the computer not
05:58 - to work so
05:58 - that's where the phrase bug came from
06:00 - it's from an actual
06:02 - bug it was a moth stuck in a computer um
06:07 - so with that i think we are ready to
06:10 - move on
06:10 - to how to prepare um so hannah
06:13 - is going to take you through all of the
06:16 - resources that you
06:17 - can look through to prepare to teach the
06:19 - hour code with your students
06:21 - um and she's going to go over some of
06:22 - the activities and then i'm going to
06:24 - talk about setup so hannah thank you
06:27 - gretchen
06:28 - so yes i'm going to talk about how to
06:30 - prepare
06:31 - the first thing you can do to prepare is
06:34 - log into your teacher dashboard
06:36 - and we have created a brand new tab on
06:40 - the teacher dashboard
06:41 - titled hour of code that has all the
06:44 - resources you could possibly need
06:46 - to prep for the hour of code and teach
06:49 - it to your students
06:50 - so this is the hour of code tab it's
06:53 - right at the top of your teacher
06:54 - dashboard
06:55 - and it's bolded so you can't miss it and
06:58 - you'll see the first thing at the top is
07:00 - the how to
07:02 - hour of code with codable video
07:04 - everything that i'm about to mention
07:06 - is summarized in a short four minute
07:08 - video right here at the top of your hour
07:10 - of code page so if
07:11 - you feel like i'm moving too fast or you
07:13 - just want to review
07:14 - the steps that i'm talking about here to
07:16 - prepare i definitely recommend you
07:18 - log into your dashboard view this hour
07:21 - of code page and check out the video
07:22 - it'll be super helpful for you
07:24 - so the first step to prepare for the
07:26 - hour of code is going to be to decide
07:29 - where and how you will run the hour of
07:31 - code this means what devices your
07:34 - students will be using
07:35 - to do the hour of code activities the
07:38 - tutorials
07:39 - so this is going to look really
07:40 - different for all of us some of you
07:42 - might be face to face
07:43 - and have ipads or some sort of in-school
07:46 - device to use with your students
07:48 - other teachers might have students that
07:50 - are remote
07:52 - and maybe you don't know exactly what
07:53 - devices they're using
07:55 - we do have an ios app so any
07:58 - student with an ios device like an ipad
08:00 - or an iphone
08:01 - can participate in the hour of code and
08:03 - we also have all the hour of code
08:05 - activities available via the web
08:07 - so it doesn't totally matter what
08:10 - devices your students are using
08:12 - it'll just be helpful for you to plan
08:13 - ahead so you know
08:15 - how to help them for login and things
08:17 - like that but this year we're also
08:18 - really excited to
08:20 - share that we have a totally unplugged
08:23 - lesson for the hour of code
08:25 - that's just worksheets that students can
08:27 - complete
08:28 - so if your students do not have access
08:30 - to tech devices that is okay we got you
08:33 - covered
08:34 - and we have an unplugged activity for
08:35 - you this year
08:37 - so step one decide where and how the
08:40 - second
08:40 - step to prepare for the hour of code
08:42 - will be to
08:43 - choose a tutorial so on this hour of
08:46 - code page if you scroll down we have all
08:49 - of our tutorials or
08:51 - that's the hour of code speak for
08:52 - activity or project
08:54 - we have them all featured here at the
08:56 - bottom and we have
08:58 - five featured activities this year
09:01 - we have a bunch more i think there's 15
09:03 - plus
09:04 - activities you can choose from but these
09:05 - are the five that we
09:07 - that we recommend for beginner coders
09:09 - and beginner teachers
09:11 - they have the most supports with them so
09:13 - i'm going to
09:14 - walk through the different activities we
09:16 - have available to you
09:17 - but again i definitely recommend you
09:19 - explore the hour of code page yourself
09:21 - you might find another activity that
09:23 - you'd like to use with your students
09:25 - so the first activity that we have
09:27 - available is the
09:28 - intro to programming pre-readers welcome
09:31 - if you are new to codable or your
09:33 - students are younger
09:34 - we had a couple questions write in about
09:37 - what's the best activity for my
09:38 - kindergartners or my first graders
09:41 - we definitely recommend this intro to
09:43 - programming it'll introduce
09:44 - students to the coding basics like
09:47 - sequence conditions
09:48 - loops and functions and it's just an
09:51 - introduction to the codeable
09:53 - game so it'll give students four
09:55 - different games to choose from
09:57 - and they can work through the game
09:59 - levels they are self-guided self-paced
10:02 - so students can kind of control their
10:05 - learning experience with very minimal
10:08 - prep or instruction from you the teacher
10:11 - the second it's a great option for free
10:13 - play too if you're just wanting to have
10:15 - them
10:16 - do free play that's a great great job
10:18 - absolutely yeah because it's self
10:20 - exactly thanksgiving it's self-paced and
10:22 - so free play
10:23 - um would be an awesome option for that
10:25 - activity
10:26 - uh the second one that we have featured
10:28 - here is make your own codable mazes oh
10:30 - and i just wanted to point out
10:32 - we have all the grade recommendations
10:33 - listed below the activity as well
10:35 - um the second one is make your own
10:37 - codeable mazes so here students are
10:40 - guided through five different levels of
10:42 - codable and then they complete a maze
10:44 - building challenge
10:46 - that's aligned with common core math
10:48 - standards
10:49 - so in the game the students will choose
10:51 - their grade level and then the challenge
10:53 - that they are presented
10:54 - will be aligned with common core math
10:57 - for that grade level
10:58 - so that's a really great one if you're
11:00 - looking for a way to integrate coding
11:02 - into
11:02 - some of your other subjects like math
11:05 - this would be a great one for you
11:06 - plus as kids get to make their own mazes
11:09 - they can express their creativity
11:11 - and get artistic so that is a great
11:14 - option for you guys
11:15 - the third one here is beach cleanup if
11:18 - you
11:19 - did the hour of code with codable last
11:21 - year you'll know that beach cleanup was
11:22 - brand new
11:23 - last year this year we have it again and
11:25 - we've revamped it
11:26 - given it a little bit of a facelift and
11:29 - so this is an awesome option if you want
11:31 - to
11:31 - integrate with environmental science in
11:35 - this activity
11:36 - students learn to program using basic
11:39 - commands
11:40 - and clean up the fuzztopia beach to
11:42 - protect the
11:43 - ocean life the sea creatures so in this
11:46 - activity students will also be
11:48 - designing a maze that connects different
11:50 - pieces of
11:51 - trash and then they code their fuzz
11:54 - through the maze to collect
11:55 - the recycling and this one has three
11:58 - or four different tutorial videos
12:01 - available
12:02 - in the game itself so if you are looking
12:04 - for an activity that
12:05 - has more video support so you don't need
12:08 - to do the direct instruction
12:10 - the kids can click the video and watch
12:12 - it at their own
12:14 - pace at their own time the beach cleanup
12:16 - has those videos embedded in the game so
12:19 - super easy for them to review the
12:21 - concepts and learn as they go
12:23 - and the final one featured here on this
12:24 - page is the build your own
12:26 - fuzz this is an awesome activity if you
12:29 - want students to get creative and design
12:32 - and code their own fuzz character the
12:34 - fuzzes are the
12:35 - characters of codable so students will
12:38 - code
12:39 - and modify properties to bring their
12:41 - character to life
12:43 - and we do recommend here grades two
12:45 - through five
12:46 - because the activity features real
12:49 - javascript
12:49 - syntax so upper elementary students can
12:53 - often do a little bit of a better job
12:55 - making the connections between the
12:56 - javascript syntax and the properties
12:58 - that are shown
12:59 - on their fuzz but again all of these
13:01 - activities are great for
13:03 - all ages students will just modify them
13:05 - to
13:06 - to be appropriate if your kindergartners
13:08 - want to design a fuzz that is a-okay
13:11 - they might just not understand the
13:12 - javascript syntax but
13:14 - they'll still get to modify properties
13:17 - and get exposed to code in that way
13:19 - and finally i'll just click this view
13:21 - all button and scroll down a bit and
13:23 - you'll see the first activity
13:25 - underneath the four that are featured is
13:27 - our coding basics
13:28 - unplugged this activity is completely
13:31 - unplugged you'll have to print out
13:34 - worksheets for your students but after
13:36 - that they can use pen and paper
13:38 - and it's a lot of our coding puzzles
13:41 - just in
13:42 - an unplugged format so it's great if
13:44 - students again do not have access to
13:46 - tech devices or if you're just looking
13:48 - for another
13:49 - option if you want to combine unplugged
13:52 - and plugged in
13:53 - this is an option for you and then as
13:56 - you can see there's a bunch more to
13:58 - choose from
13:59 - that integrate into a lot of other
14:00 - subjects like robotics and english
14:02 - so you can take your pick all of these
14:04 - activities can be completed
14:06 - in an hour for the hour of code so
14:09 - they're all here available to you again
14:10 - on your dashboard
14:12 - at the hour of code tab and after you've
14:15 - picked your tutorial
14:16 - the third and final step to prepare is
14:19 - to
14:20 - spread the word so the hour of code as
14:22 - gretchen mentioned is a magical time
14:24 - it's really exciting and i know
14:26 - a lot of us could use a little bit of a
14:28 - boost this year right now
14:30 - so hype up the hour of code your
14:32 - students get to
14:34 - be really creative and it's very fun so
14:37 - get them excited
14:38 - and the other piece to spreading the
14:41 - word
14:41 - is to give them virtual participation
14:44 - instructions so we have that tab right
14:47 - here at the top
14:48 - you can download this participation
14:50 - guide it walks through
14:52 - all the steps students and or their
14:54 - families will need to follow
14:56 - to get logged in and coding so we wanted
14:59 - to make it as easy for you as possible
15:01 - if you send this home and students
15:02 - follow all the steps they should be able
15:04 - to log in to the hour of code
15:06 - and complete their activity so you can
15:08 - email those post it to a class page
15:10 - hand them out in person whatever works
15:13 - best for you but
15:14 - those participation instructions are
15:17 - right there so you can
15:18 - use them how you need and i think that
15:21 - covers
15:22 - all of the activities that we have
15:24 - available this year
15:25 - if you guys have any questions about
15:27 - this page please let us know and again i
15:29 - definitely recommend
15:30 - watching that how to hour of code with
15:32 - codable video
15:34 - it summarizes everything i just
15:35 - mentioned in a bit of a shorter package
15:39 - so with that said i'm going to pass it
15:41 - back off to gretchen to go over
15:44 - how to get students set up since now
15:46 - you've chosen your tutorial
15:48 - you can get the students set up and
15:49 - coding
15:53 - thank you hannah okay so uh i just want
15:56 - to
15:57 - quickly tell you all make sure that uh
15:59 - if you're playing in person
16:01 - if you're using school devices please
16:03 - make sure that you are updated to the
16:05 - latest version of codable so that you
16:06 - have access to
16:08 - the hour of code activities uh some of
16:10 - them have
16:11 - been updated uh and others you know
16:15 - if it's on an older version then it
16:17 - might not have the
16:18 - we have like a timed release for the
16:20 - activities so that they'll show up at a
16:22 - certain date so if it's an old version
16:23 - it might not
16:24 - have the newest activity so please be
16:26 - sure to update
16:27 - your devices if you're playing on the
16:29 - web um
16:30 - you can save the link to whatever
16:33 - activity you choose for your students
16:36 - and post that to your class page or send
16:39 - it home in an email just like hannah
16:41 - said
16:41 - and that will take students directly to
16:43 - the activity that they
16:46 - need to play so i'm just going to
16:48 - quickly walk you through
16:49 - what students are going to see and what
16:52 - they're going to do
16:53 - um so
16:58 - i actually have a question that i think
17:00 - i should probably address first so
17:02 - i have multiple classes with hundreds of
17:04 - students total
17:06 - how can i get the class code to all of
17:08 - my students in the easiest way
17:10 - so like hannah mentioned i think that
17:13 - there
17:14 - are great ways to send home the class
17:17 - code
17:17 - to students we have we're going to go
17:20 - over
17:20 - our all of our virtual learning tools at
17:23 - the end of this
17:25 - and there are three different ways that
17:26 - you can actually send home your class
17:28 - code
17:29 - one of them is with like a pdf that has
17:33 - um the class code on it and instructions
17:36 - on how to log into codable
17:37 - uh so that would be the probably my
17:40 - choice but then there's also like a
17:42 - spreadsheet you can use there's lots of
17:43 - different options so we'll go over oh
17:45 - go over that at the end um we also have
17:48 - ways to
17:49 - add students in bulk so if you're
17:51 - planning to
17:53 - use codeable with a lot of students and
17:54 - you haven't added them decodable yet
17:57 - you can learn more about how to add
17:59 - students in bulk by going to our support
18:01 - center
18:01 - at support codable.com and
18:04 - there you'll find instructions on how to
18:07 - add students
18:08 - in bulk many classes all at once we have
18:11 - google classroom integration clever
18:12 - integration
18:13 - and uh we have our own bulk importer if
18:16 - you're planning to do it that way
18:17 - so lots of options um
18:21 - okay so uh
18:25 - the last thing that i'll say before i
18:27 - show things is that we
18:28 - do encourage so quotable is accessible
18:31 - without a codeable
18:32 - account so if you are a teacher using
18:34 - codable for the very first time and you
18:36 - have you
18:37 - have not set up an account you do not
18:39 - have to have an account to use it
18:40 - um you can go to game.google.com
18:44 - hour code you can direct your students
18:46 - here and there's an option to
18:48 - play without saving um so i'm just going
18:50 - to show
18:52 - you how to do that um and that's here
18:57 - game.codable.com hour of code if you do
19:00 - have a codeable account you can also
19:02 - come here
19:03 - this thing's blocking it there you go
19:05 - you can see it's got a play without
19:06 - saving button
19:07 - and that's where students can go to play
19:10 - um but it will not save their progress
19:12 - it's a one-time use they can come back
19:16 - many times but every time it's going to
19:18 - start them from the beginning
19:19 - so if you're using codable and you don't
19:21 - want to set up classes that's a good way
19:23 - to do it
19:24 - however we do recommend setting up
19:26 - classes just because
19:27 - number one it's free you can use with as
19:29 - many students as you want
19:30 - um but number two you're going to have
19:33 - all of their progress saved you're going
19:34 - to be able to send home
19:35 - instructions you have access to all of
19:37 - these great resources that hannah has
19:39 - covered
19:40 - so i do recommend setting up a class or
19:43 - setting up an account and creating
19:44 - classes like i mentioned there's lots of
19:47 - ways you can add students in bulk
19:50 - okay with that i'm going to show you how
19:53 - students are going to log in
19:54 - so if you're playing on the web and you
19:57 - chose
19:58 - an activity um when you click on that
20:01 - activity you're going to get this little
20:02 - landing page
20:03 - this is the link that i would share with
20:04 - your students because they can just
20:06 - click this play online button
20:09 - and enter their class code
20:21 - and it's going to take them directly to
20:24 - the activity
20:25 - uh without needing to kind of search for
20:28 - it
20:28 - in the in the game
20:42 - all right here we are beach cleanup so
20:46 - i can just click on beach cleanup and
20:48 - start playing
20:49 - um we do have options
20:53 - for instructional videos along with this
20:56 - and they are accessible from that
20:58 - landing page
21:00 - and they're also available on our
21:01 - youtube channel which you are all on
21:03 - presently so you can find them there
21:06 - they're also available on your
21:07 - teacher dashboard on the videos page so
21:10 - um
21:11 - they're they're available in a lot of
21:12 - different places uh
21:14 - and they are also on the lesson plan so
21:17 - you
21:17 - you should have them um so what you
21:19 - would do in this activity
21:21 - click play choose your difficulty level
21:24 - and i'm just going to show you guys how
21:26 - to play
21:26 - uh beach cleanup just so that you
21:30 - are familiar with it because sometimes
21:33 - it can be a little tricky so
21:36 - what you do you want to connect all of
21:38 - these recycling
21:41 - bins or the recycling symbols
21:44 - and program your fuzz through the maze
21:46 - um so
21:47 - this is a really simple sequence level
21:50 - i'm gonna go
21:51 - forward down forward up
21:55 - forward back down
21:59 - and right to go out however it looks
22:01 - like we're going to need a condition
22:04 - i'm just going to add a condition here
22:06 - and we'll talk a little bit about what a
22:07 - condition is
22:08 - um but one thing to point out is that
22:12 - this path can be anything your students
22:14 - want it to be so it's a lot of
22:16 - creativity involved in this activity
22:19 - um you know students thinking about the
22:21 - best way to get through the maze
22:23 - if you want to encourage them not to use
22:25 - a condition
22:26 - um if they haven't learned what
22:27 - conditions are they can re
22:29 - re rearrange this maze uh to remove the
22:33 - condition
22:33 - so and then we have oh i forgot the
22:36 - videos are accessible
22:37 - here as well so here's how to play
22:41 - uh the easy version of codable um just
22:44 - click that little question mark and it's
22:46 - gonna
22:46 - have hannah walk them through how to
22:48 - play
22:50 - um so i'm gonna click play
23:14 - oh i did it just enough moves yes
23:18 - okay i'm gonna click test it and see
23:20 - what happens
23:22 - looks like i'm gonna make it to the end
23:31 - those little penguins are so cute
23:35 - okay so your students can choose to save
23:37 - the maze and that's going to save it to
23:38 - their projects
23:40 - uh on your teacher dashboard or and they
23:42 - can also
23:43 - go on to the next level so um that's
23:45 - just a quick demo of how to get students
23:47 - logged in
23:48 - what they will experience if they're
23:49 - playing beach cleanup um i'm gonna go
23:51 - back
23:52 - out and just show you this is where
23:55 - students go to the
23:56 - uh make your own quotable mazes this is
23:58 - where students will go
23:59 - to build their own characters uh if they
24:02 - if you chose the free play option it
24:05 - would actually take them
24:06 - to uh flustopia and mission control
24:10 - where they can play through codable at
24:12 - their own pace
24:13 - choose from any of the four codeable
24:15 - worlds
24:16 - to play on um and
24:20 - you know kind of experience codable in
24:22 - its entirety
24:23 - at their own pace
24:27 - um i believe
24:30 - that covers it let me just double check
24:33 - my
24:33 - notes real quick yeah i think the only
24:36 - other thing that might be helpful to
24:37 - mention here on the fostopia screen
24:39 - is if your kids do somehow navigate
24:42 - themselves to this
24:43 - screen and you're wondering how to get
24:45 - back to all of those hour of code
24:46 - activities
24:47 - there is a beach hut underneath the home
24:50 - building that has the hour of code sign
24:52 - on it
24:53 - and that's what your kids your students
24:54 - can click in order to get back to the
24:56 - hour of code activities sometimes it can
24:58 - be tricky if they get kicked out
24:59 - for whatever reason so that's how they
25:01 - find their way back yes thank you hannah
25:03 - and that brings up a good point which is
25:04 - that
25:05 - um this method of sending out the
25:08 - tutorial link to your students with the
25:10 - landing page
25:12 - to bring them directly here works on the
25:14 - web
25:15 - however if they're playing at home um
25:18 - and they're on an ios device or if
25:20 - you're in school on an ios device
25:21 - there's no way for us to like directly
25:23 - to the specific activity so what you're
25:26 - going to do is have them click on this
25:28 - hour code hut
25:29 - when they first come in to the game and
25:31 - tell them which activity you want them
25:33 - to do
25:33 - um so they will land here on fuzztopia
25:37 - and you're going to want to direct them
25:38 - to the hour of code hud
25:40 - if you're playing on ios thank you i
25:43 - meant to mention that yes um yeah okay
25:47 - um and next up on our agenda
25:52 - is recognizing uh what
25:56 - students are recognizing student
25:57 - achievement
25:59 - um so
26:03 - i'm gonna quickly share my screen so
26:05 - that you guys can see
26:06 - my student progress um
26:11 - great
26:15 - okay so um after the hour of code
26:18 - kids are gonna be super excited about
26:20 - coding uh they
26:21 - you know are jazzed up because they've
26:24 - been playing in a really fun game
26:26 - for an hour uh and it's a great
26:28 - opportunity to
26:29 - um recognize what they've just done
26:32 - and also to share with their family
26:35 - about what you are doing
26:36 - in the classroom whether that's a
26:38 - virtual classroom or an in-person
26:39 - classroom
26:40 - um and here is where you can find
26:44 - what students have been doing so i'm
26:46 - gonna click
26:47 - on one of my classes
26:51 - and i'm going to click on my famous
26:54 - class
27:00 - okay so here i can see my students
27:03 - progress and everything that they've
27:05 - achieved
27:06 - uh while they were playing codable this
27:08 - is where you'll find
27:09 - progress from the free play option so if
27:12 - students are just playing encodable
27:14 - they're playing that introduction to
27:16 - programming beginner
27:18 - pre-readers welcome activity this is
27:20 - where you're gonna see their progress
27:22 - you can
27:22 - view individual students um you can see
27:26 - different levels that they completed you
27:27 - can see what concepts they were working
27:29 - on
27:30 - um and all of this is being reworked by
27:33 - fabulous hannah um so keep an eye on
27:36 - this page for
27:38 - cool updates um you can also
27:42 - view creation so if you
27:45 - assigned the fuzz builder tutorial or
27:49 - the maze maker tutorial
27:50 - this is where you can actually see what
27:52 - your students created
27:54 - so i can see all of the fuzzes that my
27:56 - students made
27:58 - i can actually get a pdf version
28:03 - of that fuzz and send it home to
28:06 - their family and let them see it it's
28:09 - going to show me the code
28:11 - that the student wrote so i can actually
28:15 - see what my student wrote and the code
28:18 - that they
28:18 - wrote to create their fuzz um so that's
28:21 - a really fun
28:22 - way to recognize student achievement if
28:24 - they
28:25 - created any sort of you know fun
28:27 - creation
28:28 - same with maze maker you're going to be
28:30 - able to see
28:32 - yeah here we go you're going to be able
28:34 - to see sorry these are really old mazes
28:36 - they're not showing up um you're going
28:38 - to be able to see the maze
28:40 - and print to share with the family
28:45 - and lastly i will show you where you can
28:48 - find certificates this is a big hit
28:50 - every year
28:51 - everyone wants certificates for their
28:52 - students so um and it's a great way to
28:55 - recognize what they've been working on
28:57 - so if you want to download certificates
28:59 - for your students
29:00 - you just select the classes that you
29:01 - want to include
29:03 - um and then this is going to generate a
29:06 - pdf
29:07 - with their with their names on it so
29:10 - find my
29:17 - and that'll have each individual
29:22 - student a certificate with their name on
29:24 - it
29:25 - for you to send home all right
29:29 - um one of the questions that we have
29:32 - gotten in the past is
29:33 - how to invest and promote to the outside
29:36 - community i.e parents
29:38 - um about what you're doing
29:41 - in the classroom and i think that um a
29:44 - great way to do that
29:45 - if just the low touch easy way of doing
29:48 - it is sharing these resources with them
29:51 - um letting them know what your child has
29:52 - been doing it's what their child has
29:54 - been doing at school
29:56 - um and you know what you're trying to
29:59 - accomplish with it
30:00 - so we have a very nice letter to
30:03 - families that you can get from our
30:04 - virtual learning page
30:06 - and um
30:09 - here it is and that's just introducing
30:12 - them to
30:12 - what coding is why it's important and
30:15 - what you've been doing with codable
30:17 - at school at school whether it's in
30:19 - person or
30:20 - remotely um and it also includes
30:23 - their class code on it so this is a
30:25 - great option if you want to
30:27 - and it's the same situation where you
30:28 - just generate the pdf and it has student
30:30 - names
30:31 - and their class code and it with
30:33 - instructions for parents to log in so
30:36 - that's a great way to get the uh to both
30:39 - generate you know interest and
30:42 - investment
30:42 - from the larger community um but also to
30:45 - get your class codes at home to
30:47 - hundreds of kids all the same time so
30:50 - with that i'm going to hand it over to
30:54 - hannah
30:54 - who has more to share about
30:58 - our virtual learning tools awesome
31:01 - yes so i am going to walk through
31:04 - some more of those tools that was just
31:06 - on the virtual learning
31:08 - page that gretchen was sharing so
31:11 - if we take a look back at this page
31:14 - we put this together at the beginning of
31:17 - or over the summer
31:18 - to help you guys with virtual learning
31:21 - remote learning
31:22 - during this school year it will these
31:25 - resources like gretchen had mentioned
31:27 - these will be really useful whether or
31:29 - not you are teaching
31:30 - fully virtually if you're in a hybrid
31:32 - model or you are face to face
31:34 - it's just helpful tools tips and tools
31:36 - that can be
31:38 - used both in a virtual setting and in
31:40 - person so i'll just walk through what
31:42 - these tools are
31:43 - again you can find this tab it's right
31:44 - below the hour of code tab
31:47 - on your teacher dashboard so this first
31:49 - section here at the top
31:50 - is awesome if you haven't used this yet
31:52 - i highly recommend it
31:54 - and this is a unique url for
31:57 - all of your classes so let's say you
31:59 - teach
32:00 - 10 different elementary coding classes
32:04 - and you have a lot of families of your
32:06 - students who are wondering
32:08 - what is my my child's class code how do
32:10 - they log
32:11 - in what's their password they just need
32:14 - support with login
32:15 - you can send this single url
32:18 - you can copy it post it on a class page
32:21 - send it in an email
32:23 - to all of the families of your students
32:27 - no matter what class they're in and i
32:29 - will just click this so you can see what
32:31 - it looks like it'll
32:32 - it'll look like this so the one piece of
32:34 - information that
32:35 - families will need to know is the name
32:38 - of their child's class so these are all
32:41 - of the classes
32:42 - that i have listed out if i
32:45 - am a parent and i know my child is in
32:47 - the fifth grade class
32:49 - they can go to this url click this url
32:52 - they can view the class and then choose
32:55 - their
32:55 - child and download login instructions
32:58 - here
32:59 - so this came to be because we had a lot
33:01 - of requests from teachers who were
33:02 - asking for more support
33:04 - in getting a bunch of login information
33:07 - to a large
33:08 - group of students so that is the way to
33:11 - do it
33:11 - again i found that right here on the
33:12 - virtual learning resources page
33:14 - copy the link send it out and they can
33:16 - look up the class code
33:18 - and the password for their child's
33:20 - account
33:21 - all of that information they might need
33:23 - to have a successful hour of code
33:25 - remotely some other useful tools on this
33:28 - page
33:29 - include a student info list so this is
33:32 - similar information
33:34 - all of the class codes passwords login
33:36 - information for
33:37 - all of your students exported in a
33:39 - really easy to read csv
33:42 - so that's available here we have the
33:44 - worksheet packets
33:45 - that are also included in the unplugged
33:48 - hour of code activity that you can take
33:49 - a look at
33:50 - you can download them here as well
33:52 - another super useful thing that has
33:55 - been really successful during the
33:58 - covid shutdowns were video lessons so if
34:01 - i click view videos it's going to kick
34:03 - me over to the
34:04 - the video tab here on the left and you
34:07 - can choose between
34:08 - explain videos so videos that instruct
34:11 - and teach a new concept
34:12 - as well as create videos videos that
34:14 - pose some sort of a creative prompt
34:16 - and ask students to complete a project
34:19 - so beyond the hour of code if you're
34:21 - looking for
34:23 - some support with coding lessons if you
34:26 - want some
34:27 - instructional videos or some creative
34:29 - activities you can
34:30 - take a look here on your dashboard so
34:33 - all of these videos are super short
34:35 - there's not any that are over five
34:36 - minutes long you can assign them
34:38 - directly to students you can share a
34:40 - link to your class page
34:42 - and we have videos for every single
34:44 - concept that
34:45 - we cover in codable and i just wanted to
34:47 - point out in the create section
34:49 - we update these pretty regularly we just
34:52 - had an activity for halloween and we had
34:54 - a fall themed activity as well that's
34:56 - unplugged
34:56 - so if you're still looking for some fall
34:58 - themed content you can show this video
35:01 - and students cr complete a short
35:03 - unplugged activity
35:05 - so that is available to you from the
35:07 - video section
35:09 - i'm back at the virtual learning uh just
35:11 - to go over the last of the tools here
35:14 - so there's a virtual learning kickoff
35:15 - lesson if you are new to codable or
35:18 - i mean i guess even if you're not new to
35:19 - codable and you're just looking for
35:22 - some sort of structured lesson to
35:24 - introduce
35:25 - or to reacquaint students with the fuzz
35:27 - family of codable
35:28 - uh before the hour of code definitely
35:31 - check out this
35:32 - kickoff lesson it's just a slide stack
35:33 - you can make a copy of it
35:35 - and edit it however you wish but i
35:37 - included here
35:38 - a bunch of prompts i included some
35:40 - videos that introduced the fuzz family
35:43 - there's a couple other tips for getting
35:46 - logged in
35:47 - it walks students through everything
35:49 - they might need as well as an
35:51 - introduction to fuzztopia
35:52 - so if you want some sort of a lesson to
35:55 - introduce students
35:56 - to codable and the fuzz family before
35:59 - you start the hour of code
36:00 - that is available to you here gretchen
36:03 - mentioned the letters to families and
36:04 - then
36:05 - we also have a blog the codable blog
36:08 - that
36:08 - we are updating multiple articles
36:12 - a week right now that include tips and
36:14 - tricks for
36:15 - teaching virtually different unplugged
36:17 - activities
36:18 - different coding activities in general
36:21 - so
36:22 - definitely follow our codable blog if
36:23 - you're looking for some regularly
36:25 - updated
36:26 - coding content and we're posting a lot
36:28 - over there
36:30 - and those are the virtual learning
36:32 - resources
36:33 - please take advantage of this page and
36:35 - if you notice anything's missing if you
36:37 - think oh
36:38 - it would be super helpful if i had this
36:41 - feature that i don't see here please
36:44 - fill out this is just a link to a google
36:45 - form you can make
36:46 - make a suggestion i've been reading
36:48 - through those and it gives us some
36:50 - inspiration for what to create in the
36:52 - future so we can make
36:53 - this as easy for you guys as possible
36:57 - and with that i will move on to
37:00 - our the last thing i wanted to share
37:02 - which is just that if you are new to
37:04 - codable
37:05 - and you haven't set up a class yet and
37:09 - you don't know too much about all of the
37:12 - dashboard logistics
37:14 - i will say that we covered everything
37:16 - you could possibly need to know about
37:18 - setting up a class managing your classes
37:21 - adding passwords changing a class code
37:23 - all of these things in our back to
37:25 - school webinar
37:26 - and we've linked to that webinar in the
37:29 - webinar agenda for this hour of code
37:31 - webinar so you can check out that link
37:34 - to the back to school one
37:35 - it's also on our youtube page which i
37:37 - know you can find because you're here
37:38 - already
37:39 - and that'll just give you a quick
37:40 - rundown if you want kind of a refresher
37:43 - of what gretchen was talking about with
37:44 - my classes and progress we go over all
37:47 - of it so
37:47 - i definitely recommend you check out the
37:49 - back to school webinar if you're looking
37:51 - for more help
37:52 - setting up a class and then of course
37:54 - reach out to us if
37:55 - if there's still some confusion there
37:57 - and we can help get you set up before
37:59 - the hour of code kicks off next week
38:06 - i just realized uh we had a request for
38:08 - you to turn up your mic or i guess
38:10 - maybe speak a little louder um sorry
38:12 - everyone i know we're 38 minutes into
38:15 - this
38:15 - but that's that's been a request so
38:18 - sorry okay don't worry
38:22 - no worries okay so i could i didn't
38:24 - notice
38:26 - but others others have requested it so
38:29 - um i think it's time to move on to
38:33 - q a all right cool so
38:36 - we have some questions from the audience
38:39 - uh one of them that i wanted to be sure
38:42 - to mention
38:43 - um is from karen okdahl long time
38:46 - codabler
38:47 - uh how or does the easy difficulty level
38:51 - migrate into the harder levels as the
38:53 - students progress and she's talking
38:55 - specifically about the
38:56 - beach cleanup activity and it does
39:00 - not so whatever level your students
39:03 - choose so if they choose the easy level
39:05 - they're going to stay in the easy level
39:07 - until they're ready to move on to
39:10 - medium or hard and they can just go back
39:13 - and then play again and select the
39:15 - medium or
39:15 - hard difficulty level with each level of
39:19 - difficulty i should have mentioned this
39:20 - earlier
39:22 - they're going to have new concepts that
39:24 - they can
39:25 - incorporate into their maze designs
39:27 - there's also going to be fewer bins
39:29 - to put in their solution so for example
39:32 - with easy the options are sequence and
39:34 - conditions
39:36 - and they have i think it's eight or nine
39:39 - bins for their answer
39:41 - with the medium they can incorporate
39:43 - loops and they have
39:44 - one less bin and with
39:48 - the hard activity um
39:51 - they can add functions
39:54 - and that has
39:57 - two fewer bins than the easy mode um so
40:00 - i just wanted to be sure to clarify that
40:03 - we also um had some questions
40:07 - um if there can be more than one teacher
40:11 - on a class and there cannot be
40:15 - uh there's only one teacher per class um
40:17 - however
40:18 - on the quotable premium plan you do have
40:21 - the option to
40:22 - um if you're an admin add multiple
40:25 - teachers and so you can actually view
40:26 - student progress you can add the classes
40:29 - for your teachers if you need to
40:31 - but that is on the premium version of
40:34 - quotable only
40:35 - um okay and then i wanted to address
40:39 - some of those are the questions from the
40:40 - chat
40:41 - if anybody has questions that haven't
40:43 - been uh bree's been on it with all of
40:46 - the questions she's
40:47 - watching she always yeah she's been
40:49 - cruising through all these questions
40:51 - um but if there's anything that you have
40:55 - questions about that you would like to
40:57 - ask we will
40:58 - talk about it here but in the meantime
41:01 - i'm going to go ahead
41:02 - and address some of the questions that
41:04 - we got
41:05 - prior to the webinar so um
41:09 - let's see here one of the questions is
41:13 - what is the best way to teach coding
41:15 - virtually and
41:16 - i think we've talked a lot about the
41:18 - different ways that you can teach coding
41:19 - virtually this year
41:21 - all of the different resources that you
41:22 - can use ultimately it's up to you
41:25 - you are the expert you know your class
41:27 - situation every single classroom
41:30 - is experiencing different things right
41:32 - now so we can't be the ones to tell you
41:34 - what the best way to do that
41:36 - is however if you're just starting out
41:39 - if it were me and hannah please correct
41:40 - me if you think i'm wrong
41:42 - but i would definitely start with the
41:44 - like
41:45 - virtual kickoff lesson that hannah
41:48 - showed in the virtual
41:49 - resources section and then just give my
41:53 - kids
41:53 - access to the free play pre-readers
41:57 - activity encodable that lets them roam
42:00 - and be free to choose whatever coding
42:02 - activity they want to do
42:03 - and that's what i would do with my
42:05 - students especially if i'm
42:07 - if i'm virtual there's lots of videos
42:09 - that can accompany
42:11 - uh the kickoff lesson and also the um
42:16 - the pre-reader activity uh they're
42:18 - available on your videos
42:19 - page uh if you want to add a video to
42:22 - kind of enrich the lesson for them
42:24 - um but that's what i would do if it were
42:26 - me hannah
42:27 - anything you want to add to that yeah i
42:29 - agree i think that
42:31 - you know we've been adding video lessons
42:33 - to the dashboard
42:35 - we added from february to now i think
42:39 - 30 different videos so if you're unsure
42:41 - about how to introduce coding
42:43 - in a virtual setting over zoom and you
42:45 - have young students
42:47 - um you know it makes sense that that's
42:49 - that's really tricky and
42:50 - hopefully the video lessons that we have
42:52 - available to you
42:53 - are helpful because i do think that you
42:56 - can create a really rich coding lesson
42:57 - by
42:58 - showing a video and then doing an
42:59 - activity encodable with
43:01 - you know limited prep or instruction
43:04 - needed from
43:05 - you the teacher so if you're unsure
43:07 - about how to teach coding
43:08 - you know we have those supports there
43:10 - for you
43:13 - definitely okay we have a question from
43:15 - the audience
43:16 - uh is there a way to uh archive classes
43:21 - and there's not a way to archive classes
43:24 - so that you can bring them back later
43:27 - but you can delete classes permanently
43:29 - so if you just want to remove classes
43:30 - from your clinical dashboard that are
43:32 - from years past
43:33 - you can delete those classes you can
43:35 - also transfer students
43:37 - so if you have your classes from last
43:38 - year still set up
43:40 - and you still see some of the students
43:42 - and you need to move them to their new
43:43 - homeroom
43:44 - you can transfer students from class to
43:47 - class
43:48 - um easily and in bulk on your teacher
43:51 - dashboard
43:52 - just go to support.codable and search
43:55 - transfer and you'll see an article with
43:57 - instructions on how to do that
44:00 - um okay one question that we got
44:03 - previously was
44:04 - uh we use seesaw and canvas with
44:06 - students
44:07 - can they share their work with a class
44:09 - of peers within these learning
44:11 - management systems
44:12 - and yes uh we actually have some and
44:16 - i'll post this link
44:17 - in the chat for you we actually have
44:20 - some seesaw activities set up for
44:23 - codable
44:25 - on our codable blog and you can
44:29 - use those activities if you want to or
44:31 - just take them as inspiration
44:33 - if you want to create your own hour of
44:36 - code
44:36 - codable seesaw activity specific to your
44:39 - class
44:40 - that's what i would suggest doing
44:42 - because you know the situation you know
44:44 - what
44:44 - you want to ask your students to share
44:47 - that would be a good place to start so
44:50 - i'm just going to
44:51 - place that link here for you
44:54 - and that's the link to all of our seesaw
44:56 - activities you can take a look at them
44:58 - and use them with your students it's a
45:00 - great we love see-saw it's a great way
45:02 - to
45:03 - encourage collaboration even if you're
45:06 - you know your students are learning from
45:07 - home
45:08 - um one of the questions we also had was
45:13 - uh what advice would you give to
45:16 - students that think coding is not for
45:18 - them
45:19 - it's a good question um and what about
45:22 - when it's
45:23 - when it gets hard sometimes just trying
45:26 - again is even more frustrating
45:28 - what are more specific strategies for
45:30 - not giving up
45:31 - i love this question and i think hannah
45:33 - just wrote a great blog post about it
45:35 - hannah can you talk a little bit more
45:36 - about it
45:37 - yeah definitely so i had a really
45:39 - similar experience when i was a computer
45:41 - science teacher
45:42 - i was using a program my students were
45:45 - not very interested and there was a lot
45:46 - of frustration happening
45:48 - and i was struggling a lot i'm trying to
45:50 - teach them and get them excited about it
45:52 - so
45:53 - what ended up working for me was
45:56 - really kind of shifting gears and doing
45:58 - more of an emergent
46:00 - curriculum mindset which meant
46:03 - i scrapped my plans and i
46:07 - tried to focus on relevant topics to the
46:10 - students in their
46:11 - real lives and how i could curate
46:14 - lessons about uh what was actually going
46:18 - on
46:18 - and and different creative projects they
46:20 - could create to solve problems
46:23 - uh in the real world so we did a big
46:26 - design thinking unit and
46:30 - different projects where they were
46:31 - solving problems through engineering and
46:34 - then
46:35 - coding in scratch and using other
46:37 - programs to
46:38 - to try to link it all together so yeah i
46:42 - would say
46:43 - you know it's it can be really tricky
46:46 - if they're not showing interest i would
46:49 - keep trying to
46:50 - tweak and modify your lesson plans to
46:52 - see if there's a project or something
46:54 - creative that they can build
46:56 - that makes coding a bit more relevant to
46:58 - them in their real
47:00 - lives and i did just release a blog post
47:03 - about developing problem-solving skills
47:07 - for young
47:07 - children and how it can be tricky but
47:10 - there are some tools that
47:11 - you can do some anchor charts you can
47:13 - try different tips and tricks in that
47:15 - blog
47:16 - for how to develop creative problem
47:18 - solvers and
47:20 - and how to help students when they face
47:21 - that that moment of unsureness
47:24 - how to help them be resilient so i think
47:27 - we can link that blog
47:28 - that blog post in the chat perhaps but
47:31 - definitely check it out
47:32 - it's up on there and if you need more
47:35 - tips or you want to chat about different
47:37 - ways to modify
47:38 - your curriculum to support those
47:40 - students that are struggling
47:42 - i'm happy to connect individually and
47:44 - and we can chat about that
47:48 - awesome thank you yeah i just asked
47:50 - maria she's another codable
47:52 - team member that's hanging back and
47:54 - behind the scenes making this all work
47:56 - i asked her for the link so she can send
47:58 - it to me to post uh oh
48:00 - great great somebody already posted it
48:01 - awesome way to go team
48:04 - um okay so another question
48:07 - uh that we should address um do you have
48:10 - good videos or recommendations as to how
48:13 - to best
48:13 - introduce the hour of code to elementary
48:16 - students who have never
48:17 - coded before yes uh great question
48:20 - i have two videos that i'm going to link
48:22 - in the um
48:24 - chat for you one of them is a video from
48:28 - codable that we created with some
48:30 - codable kiddos
48:31 - and it's just so much fun we made it a
48:33 - few years ago
48:34 - um then explaining what the hour of code
48:37 - is why it's cool why coding is fun
48:39 - um and what you should do you know if
48:41 - you're another kid
48:42 - and you're interested in coding so i'm
48:45 - gonna link to that here
48:47 - and then there is also a video by
48:50 - code.org that i think is really great
48:52 - um that has a lot of celebrities and
48:55 - famous people
48:56 - and um other you know notable people
48:59 - talking about what coding is and why
49:02 - it is um important to learn so
49:05 - that's also linked here um
49:10 - let me check the chat see if we have any
49:12 - other questions
49:14 - nothing so far okay i'll move on to the
49:16 - next um
49:18 - question how do i optimize the use of
49:20 - codeable for a remote only class with
49:22 - students with disabilities
49:24 - what are recommended strategies um
49:27 - so hannah do you want to take this one
49:30 - sure
49:31 - so i would again that remote kickoff
49:34 - lesson that i
49:35 - shared on the virtual learning resources
49:37 - page
49:39 - i think that would be really helpful for
49:41 - students of any
49:42 - developmental level because it does have
49:45 - a lot of pictures
49:46 - and steps that are clearly mapped out
49:49 - so i i think in terms of introducing
49:52 - codable
49:53 - having that kind of map where you can
49:56 - follow slide by slide picture by picture
49:58 - step by step
49:59 - can be really helpful for kids who have
50:02 - just
50:03 - for students who have disabilities so
50:05 - that would be a good place to start
50:07 - for codable because i know it can be
50:09 - pretty overwhelming
50:10 - for some students when they first log in
50:12 - and there's so much going on and it can
50:14 - it can be a little over
50:15 - stimulating so breaking it down into
50:17 - really manageable
50:19 - bite-sized pieces is a good first step i
50:21 - would say
50:25 - gretchen did you want to add anything um
50:28 - no i think
50:28 - mainly the the only other thing i would
50:30 - say is that codable
50:32 - is uh not designed for students with
50:34 - disabilities we didn't have that
50:36 - um need in mind when we were designing
50:39 - it um
50:40 - we do have lots of teachers that use it
50:42 - successfully with their students with
50:44 - disabilities
50:45 - we are however not the experts you're
50:47 - the expert so
50:49 - um i would just say you know you know
50:51 - your class best
50:52 - and use your discretion uh when you're
50:55 - you know making choices for your
50:57 - students
50:57 - um we do have a lot of student or
51:00 - teachers in the
51:01 - codable community that use it with you
51:03 - know their students with disabilities
51:05 - i would pose a question on twitter
51:08 - to the to them um and see
51:11 - you know if you get some responses that
51:14 - way um
51:15 - and yeah that that covers it
51:18 - um okay the next question is i teach
51:21 - about 600 students in grades k to five
51:24 - is there a limit to how many students i
51:26 - can assign levels to
51:27 - lessons to uh and no there's not there's
51:30 - no limit on the number of students that
51:32 - you can use codable with
51:33 - um although we do have a question in the
51:35 - chat that is relevant to this so i'll be
51:38 - sure to mention it
51:39 - um classes are limited to 50 students
51:42 - so you can break up classes
51:46 - into sections of 50 if you need to
51:50 - the reason we have a limit is for
51:52 - loading uh
51:54 - concerns but also usability if you can
51:57 - imagine
51:58 - a hundred names scrolling through that
52:02 - as a kindergartener would be
52:04 - a nightmare for you and a nightmare for
52:05 - them so we do limit it to 50 students
52:09 - and if you have um more than 50 students
52:13 - in a class
52:14 - i would suggest breaking them up by
52:15 - alphabetically or
52:18 - in some other way to
52:21 - create classes that make sense for you
52:24 - and for your students
52:25 - um and i think that that covers it
52:28 - so the next question is
52:33 - um our school district has the codable
52:37 - app available to students
52:39 - on the on clevver how should they log
52:43 - in this is a great question we have a
52:44 - lot of clever users and a lot of clever
52:46 - fans
52:47 - and um what i would suggest
52:50 - is different from what we've covered so
52:52 - far in the webinar i would suggest
52:54 - actually logging in directly the way
52:57 - that your students are used to
52:58 - in clever don't deviate from what your
53:01 - students have
53:02 - learned to to do to log into codable um
53:05 - log in and then have them go to that
53:07 - beach cleanup i'm sorry not be clean
53:10 - the hour of code hut that's that we
53:12 - showed you earlier on flustopia
53:15 - um so what you would do is just have
53:17 - them log in with clever
53:18 - and then click on the hour of code hut
53:20 - underneath of the little home
53:22 - and that will direct them to all of the
53:23 - hour of code activities
53:25 - yeah and i included a an image of that
53:28 - hour of code hut in the webinar agenda
53:30 - so you know exactly
53:32 - what image kids are looking for when
53:34 - they log in so hopefully
53:35 - it's easy to find yes definitely
53:39 - okay are there any other questions we've
53:41 - we've covered it all
53:42 - um in just under an hour so
53:45 - um but if anybody has any final
53:47 - questions you'd like us to address
53:49 - um please post them into the chat we'll
53:51 - wait a couple of minutes but
53:52 - um maybe maybe a minute
53:56 - um but i think that we've covered most
53:57 - everything um thank you all so so much
54:00 - for joining us for participating for
54:04 - being brave enough to be a teacher in
54:07 - this wild year
54:08 - we really appreciate you all um i know
54:11 - that it's been difficult i know
54:13 - that there's been a lot of uncertainty
54:15 - um so we really appreciate you all we
54:18 - are glad that you joined us
54:19 - and we are glad you're planning to do
54:21 - the hour of code this year because it's
54:22 - such
54:22 - an important activity for our students
54:26 - um
54:27 - to just get them engaged in learning and
54:29 - get them engaged in
54:31 - learning about a skill that's going to
54:32 - be useful for the rest of their lives
54:35 - so um i think that that's everything we
54:39 - don't have any other questions
54:41 - uh brie just posted the agenda again in
54:43 - the chat
54:44 - so uh everything that we've talked about
54:47 - is linked in there
54:48 - um if you have any other questions you
54:50 - can always reach out to us
54:52 - at support clinical.com thank you
54:55 - all right bye everyone happy hour of
55:02 - code
