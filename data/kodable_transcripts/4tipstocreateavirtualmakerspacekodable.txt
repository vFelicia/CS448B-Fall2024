00:00 - [Music]
00:05 - hello all
00:06 - welcome back to the codable universe if
00:08 - you're new here my name is hannah
00:10 - i'm the instructional designer and coach
00:12 - at codable
00:13 - we are working to bring high quality and
00:15 - fun computer science education to
00:17 - every k5 student on this channel we post
00:20 - tons of
00:21 - animated video lessons that teach
00:23 - students coding basics
00:24 - but today we're going to do something a
00:26 - little different this is the first
00:27 - episode of a new series that i will be
00:29 - hosting on this channel
00:31 - where i hop on here and we chat about
00:33 - questions
00:34 - concerns wonderings or ideas that you
00:38 - have
00:38 - about teaching elementary computer
00:40 - science each episode will be a little
00:42 - bit different depending on
00:44 - what you guys are interested in so i
00:45 - definitely want to hear from you in the
00:47 - comments if you have ideas for topics
00:49 - you'd like to see covered
00:50 - for example i might break down a recent
00:52 - article that i find interesting
00:54 - offer different instructional tips and
00:56 - tricks share an interview
00:58 - with a teacher or provide direct
01:00 - resources the ultimate goal here is to
01:02 - get you the tools that you need to bring
01:04 - all things stem to your elementary
01:06 - students
01:07 - regardless of your background or if you
01:09 - have experience with
01:11 - science technology engineering and math
01:14 - for yourself i'm really excited about
01:16 - today's video because we are going to
01:18 - kick it off with one of my most
01:19 - favorite topics that has definitely
01:21 - gotten an overhaul in 2020
01:23 - and that is maker makerspaces in today's
01:26 - video we're going to go over
01:28 - four tips for creating your first
01:30 - virtual
01:31 - makerspace virtual makerspace if you're
01:34 - excited to learn more and you enjoy this
01:36 - video while you're watching
01:37 - please be sure to give us a thumbs up
01:39 - and click the subscribe button
01:40 - so you don't miss more videos like this
01:42 - one all right enough rambling let's get
01:44 - into it
01:45 - so let's start with the basics what is a
01:47 - makerspace
01:48 - a makerspace is exactly like it sounds
01:51 - it is
01:52 - a space in a school or a library
01:55 - museum or some other setting where
01:58 - participants
01:59 - can make things it's a makerspace
02:02 - some makerspaces have high-tech tools
02:05 - like
02:05 - 3d printers laser cutters soldering
02:08 - tools
02:10 - sewing machines that participants can
02:12 - use to
02:13 - make things but it really doesn't need
02:16 - all of these high-tech machines
02:17 - or really any machine for it to be
02:20 - considered a makerspace
02:21 - if you have cardboard legos tape
02:25 - art supplies then you're on your way you
02:27 - can totally put together a makerspace
02:29 - it's more about the maker mindset this
02:32 - idea of
02:33 - creating something out of nothing and
02:36 - getting to choose what you're working on
02:38 - those are the things that are at the
02:39 - core definition of a makerspace
02:42 - in an education setting like a school
02:44 - maker spaces provide
02:46 - students with the opportunity to create
02:48 - hands-on projects
02:50 - of their choice so let's talk benefits
02:53 - there are
02:53 - tons of benefits to teaching in a maker
02:56 - space
02:57 - young children construct their knowledge
02:59 - of the world around them
03:00 - through everyday experiences they learn
03:02 - by doing
03:03 - by asking questions and seeking the
03:06 - answers through experimentation
03:08 - this is why makerspaces are such a
03:10 - powerful
03:11 - educational environment they provide
03:13 - students with this
03:15 - opportunity to practice the four c's
03:17 - that are so
03:18 - sought after in 21st century schooling
03:21 - so if you don't know the four c's are
03:23 - critical thinking creativity
03:25 - collaboration
03:26 - and communication but beyond the four
03:29 - c's
03:30 - maker spaces are an awesome learning
03:32 - environment
03:33 - to learn so many other 21st century
03:35 - skills like problem solving
03:37 - and self-confidence basically maker
03:40 - spaces are awesome
03:41 - it's why i'm so passionate about them
03:42 - but i know a lot of teachers are
03:44 - unsure how to get started with the
03:46 - makerspace and especially in 2020 how to
03:49 - move it online so that's what we're
03:51 - going to talk about here
03:52 - like i mentioned there are tons of types
03:54 - of makerspaces
03:55 - some of them are bananas so i'll show
03:58 - you some examples there's fab
04:00 - labs which are like those high-tech
04:01 - maker spaces i was talking about with
04:03 - the 3d printers and the laser cutters
04:05 - there's arts and crafts based maker
04:07 - spaces that are a lot more accessible to
04:09 - teachers so that's probably what you've
04:11 - seen in schools or museums that include
04:14 - hands-on art materials like tape and
04:16 - cardboard
04:17 - where participants can construct and
04:19 - make projects there's also wood and
04:21 - metal workshops there's
04:22 - um hacker what's the word
04:26 - like hacker spaces where all the making
04:29 - is done
04:30 - via computing so there's tons of options
04:32 - my personal experience with makerspaces
04:35 - i used to work at a children's science
04:36 - and art museum where i would teach
04:38 - camps and classes in an early childhood
04:41 - fab lab
04:42 - so this was a building that had high
04:44 - tech tools like a 3d printer
04:46 - some laser cutters a screen printing
04:49 - contraption
04:50 - in a learning environment meant for kids
04:53 - who were 2 to 10 years old so when i
04:56 - hear makerspace that's what i think of
04:58 - but in 2020 the maker space has gotten a
05:01 - total
05:02 - makeover what we have historically
05:04 - associated with maker spaces like
05:06 - hands-on learning collaboration those
05:09 - are things that have been a lot more
05:10 - difficult
05:11 - to do safely it's just not accessible
05:14 - right now
05:15 - so teachers being the brilliant
05:17 - innovators that they are
05:19 - have adapted and they've created the
05:21 - virtual makerspace
05:22 - so how does this work in a virtual
05:25 - setting a makerspace is going to look a
05:27 - lot like a choice board
05:28 - um if you haven't seen what a choice
05:30 - board is these are any
05:32 - web-based platform that students can go
05:34 - to and choose
05:36 - from a collection of activities or
05:38 - projects
05:39 - choices could be to read to go outside
05:42 - to do a science project
05:44 - to write to do art things like that
05:46 - choice boards are awesome
05:48 - because they allow the child to choose
05:50 - what they're interested in and direct
05:52 - their own learning
05:53 - so a virtual maker space is going to be
05:55 - pretty similar to a choice board
05:57 - except all the options that are on the
06:00 - platform
06:01 - ask you to make something you keep all
06:03 - the same principles that you would in a
06:05 - physical
06:06 - maker space but you move it online great
06:09 - it sounds so easy
06:10 - how do i do that so i'm no longer
06:12 - teaching i'm working at codable
06:14 - full-time
06:15 - so to get inside the mind of a teacher
06:17 - and learn
06:18 - some first-hand tips we talked to
06:20 - shannon miller who is a district
06:22 - teacher librarian and innovation
06:24 - director of library and technology in
06:27 - iowa
06:27 - she works with get this 950
06:32 - students grades pre-k
06:35 - through 12th grade so you better believe
06:38 - that she knows what she's talking about
06:40 - i'll link her social media in the
06:41 - description box below so you can check
06:43 - out some of the work that she's doing
06:44 - she is awesome and she actually has a
06:46 - pre-made virtual
06:48 - makerspace that you can take and change
06:51 - and modify to fit the needs of your
06:53 - class it's made with google slides and
06:55 - i'll link it in the description box
06:56 - below too but that's available to you
06:58 - right now
06:59 - if you want some sort of jumping off
07:01 - place for the virtual maker space
07:02 - i am going to use this example as i go
07:05 - through her tips for creating one
07:07 - yourself
07:07 - so here is her makerspace and now let's
07:09 - talk about shannon's four tips for
07:11 - creating your own virtual maker space
07:14 - step one think carefully about how the
07:17 - activities are
07:18 - organized it's great if the maker space
07:21 - is
07:21 - inviting and interesting to look at but
07:24 - more importantly it has to be
07:25 - easy to understand so you can see in
07:28 - shannon's example she organizes all the
07:30 - projects and activities by
07:33 - subject this makes a lot of sense to me
07:35 - because whether she has a kindergartner
07:37 - or a 12th grader accessing this maker
07:39 - space
07:40 - most kids organize their school day by
07:42 - the different subjects or classes that
07:44 - they're going to
07:45 - so in a virtual maker space if the
07:47 - activities are organized that way
07:48 - it'll make sense to the student it seems
07:51 - like such an easy tip
07:52 - but it makes a huge difference if kids
07:54 - understand how the maker space
07:56 - is laid out and organized they're not
07:58 - going to waste time
07:59 - trying to figure out the format and what
08:02 - each column means
08:03 - they're going to be able to go straight
08:05 - to the activity and the subject matter
08:07 - that they're interested in
08:08 - and not waste time trying just trying to
08:10 - figure out what they're looking at
08:12 - step two you'll want to include things
08:14 - that students are familiar with
08:16 - but also some new things so what this
08:19 - means
08:19 - is when your kids first look at the
08:21 - virtual maker space
08:23 - it might feel really new to them if this
08:25 - is something that you haven't done a lot
08:26 - in the past
08:28 - they're going to want to see topics
08:30 - subjects or activities that they've seen
08:32 - before
08:33 - to kind of ease them a little bit to
08:34 - help them realize that this doesn't need
08:36 - to be like a scary
08:38 - scary shift or anything that there's
08:41 - things there that they know
08:42 - that they will be successful doing that
08:44 - said you don't
08:46 - only want the content matter in your
08:48 - virtual makerspace to be
08:50 - the kids have already done or mastered
08:52 - in the past the incredible thing about
08:54 - maker spaces is that it allows kids to
08:57 - learn
08:58 - by doing like we mentioned earlier it
09:00 - allows them to learn through
09:01 - experimentation
09:02 - and if they've already mastered a bunch
09:04 - of content
09:06 - there isn't that much to gain in the
09:08 - virtual maker space by
09:09 - redoing that same content which is why
09:12 - shannon recommends
09:13 - adding some new topics in there some new
09:16 - activities that maybe they've never seen
09:18 - before even new subject matter
09:20 - to see if they choose to
09:23 - experiment and if they do then there's a
09:25 - lot of learning opportunities there for
09:27 - example
09:28 - shannon shared that a lot of the
09:30 - teachers that she has worked with
09:32 - include coding as an option in their
09:34 - virtual maker spaces coding is something
09:36 - that is not taught in every school
09:38 - but has a big impact in helping students
09:42 - develop
09:42 - creative problem-solving skills
09:44 - resilience and logical reasoning
09:46 - so yeah don't be afraid to include
09:49 - topics that
09:50 - might be brand new to your students
09:51 - because that's how they'll learn the
09:52 - most
09:53 - step three keep it fresh as we mentioned
09:56 - you want the content in your makerspace
09:58 - to be
09:58 - organized in a way that's easy to
10:00 - understand but you don't want it to get
10:02 - stale
10:03 - this is actually one of the best things
10:05 - about a virtual makerspace i think
10:07 - and is actually a huge benefit over a
10:10 - physical makerspace is that
10:12 - if you created your makerspace online
10:14 - you can change your offerings
10:16 - all the time you might realize that one
10:19 - project that you posted is not really
10:21 - popular with your students they're not
10:23 - excited about it they're not completing
10:24 - it
10:25 - get rid of it you can switch it up you
10:27 - can add something else in there to test
10:29 - out if that would work better
10:30 - it's a way for you to make sure that the
10:32 - content you're providing for students
10:34 - is the best content for them and also it
10:37 - keeps it interactive and fun and
10:38 - interesting
10:39 - your students will log on to their
10:41 - virtual maker space excited to see
10:43 - something new that they haven't tried
10:45 - before so as shannon says
10:47 - keep it fresh and step four this is the
10:49 - step that shannon says
10:51 - is one of the most important when
10:53 - creating your own virtual maker space
10:55 - listen to your students you are the
10:57 - expert you know your students the best
10:59 - if you listen to what they're interested
11:01 - in
11:01 - you can tie that into the makerspace
11:04 - offerings
11:05 - there should be a relationship between
11:07 - your kids and your makerspace curriculum
11:10 - you can ask yourself do my students see
11:13 - themselves reflected
11:14 - in these projects are these issues that
11:17 - they care about
11:18 - are they interesting to them when my
11:20 - students work on these activities
11:22 - do they see themselves as powerful
11:24 - change makers in the world
11:26 - this is one of the reasons why i'm so
11:28 - passionate and why i love
11:29 - coding and computer science as an option
11:32 - in your virtual makerspace
11:34 - because we've seen it this year more
11:36 - than ever technology
11:37 - is changing the world and we do interact
11:40 - with it
11:41 - every single day especially during
11:43 - virtual learning
11:44 - to offer something like coding and
11:46 - computer science in your virtual maker
11:48 - space
11:49 - will help kids make a connection between
11:52 - what is going on in their everyday life
11:54 - and what they're learning in school even
11:56 - our youngest students can play a role in
11:59 - changing the world when they learn
12:00 - computer science at a young age
12:02 - so listen to them what is relevant in
12:04 - their lives and
12:05 - make sure that that is reflected in your
12:07 - maker space as well okay
12:08 - this is the last thing that i'll talk
12:10 - about before we wrap it up and
12:12 - i i thought it was really important to
12:14 - include if you were to google
12:16 - virtual makerspace or choice boards
12:20 - or even looking at shannon's version of
12:22 - her virtual maker space
12:23 - looking at any of these examples they
12:25 - are what i would call
12:26 - pinterest worthy this means that they
12:29 - look amazing they have artistic
12:32 - flourishes
12:33 - and it's clear that a lot of time went
12:35 - into
12:36 - creating the aesthetic that you actually
12:38 - see when you open the makerspace
12:40 - having it be warm and inviting and
12:44 - interesting when you first open it
12:46 - is a huge plus but i want to make sure
12:49 - that
12:49 - before i wrap this video up i tell you
12:51 - that it's not
12:52 - required if you look at these examples
12:55 - and you think to yourself
12:56 - oh gosh i am not tech savvy
12:59 - i'm i'm not artistic my maker space or
13:02 - my choice board that i put together is
13:04 - not gonna look
13:05 - like these examples that i see on
13:07 - pinterest
13:09 - that is okay it is much more important
13:12 - in my opinion to make sure that the
13:14 - activities that you're linking to
13:16 - are awesome and the aesthetic how it
13:20 - looks
13:21 - can come second because at the end of
13:23 - the day our students are going to learn
13:26 - by doing the activities they're going to
13:28 - learn by clicking the link
13:30 - and following the instructions they're
13:31 - not going to learn
13:33 - just from looking at the makerspace
13:35 - itself they have to dive in
13:37 - and do the projects so that's why i just
13:39 - wanted to emphasize
13:41 - picking the right projects that are
13:43 - relevant for your students lives
13:45 - over spending a ton of time making sure
13:48 - it looks
13:49 - beautiful again both are important but
13:51 - don't lose sight of
13:52 - where the learning is happening because
13:54 - we're all new to this
13:55 - there is no best practices for
13:58 - virtual maker spaces yet because it's
14:01 - all so new
14:02 - please do not think that some of the
14:04 - examples that you see online
14:05 - are the template that you must use to
14:08 - create your virtual maker space
14:10 - make it your own you might have a
14:11 - completely different idea
14:13 - that works a lot better for your
14:15 - students so i hope that makes sense that
14:17 - is about it
14:18 - for our first episode of
14:21 - insert the name that i come up with for
14:23 - the series that i haven't thought of yet
14:24 - if you have any ideas
14:26 - for what this series could be called
14:27 - where i offer tips and tricks like this
14:29 - leave it in the comments below
14:31 - i'd love to get some perspective from
14:33 - the community that's actually going to
14:35 - be watching these videos
14:36 - i really hope you found this video
14:38 - helpful make sure that you like the
14:39 - video if you enjoyed it and you
14:41 - subscribe to our channel so you don't
14:42 - miss the next one i'll see you next time
