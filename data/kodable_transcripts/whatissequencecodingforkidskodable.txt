00:01 - let's go we know that humans are smarter
00:08 - than computers programmers are people
00:12 - who write instructions to tell a
00:13 - computer what to do these instructions
00:17 - are written in a language that the
00:18 - computer understands called code
00:22 - programmers write the code to make a
00:24 - program run or work a program can be
00:27 - anything from moving a character across
00:30 - a screen to an entire game there are
00:36 - three basic flow control structures that
00:40 - guide Vow a program works and what it
00:42 - does today we are going to focus on
00:45 - sequence so what is sequence sequence is
00:50 - an order of events as people everything
00:54 - we do can be broken into a series of
00:56 - steps we follow to complete the task the
00:59 - order of events we follow to make sure
01:02 - the task is completed the correct way is
01:04 - called an algorithm you follow an
01:09 - algorithm every time you wash your hands
01:11 - first you get your hands wet then you
01:15 - get soap you wash off the soap and then
01:17 - you dry now as a human you may already
01:20 - know the steps you need to follow to do
01:22 - this correctly but a computer like a
01:25 - robot would not be able to follow this
01:28 - same algorithm the instructions are not
01:30 - detailed enough how do you move towards
01:34 - the sink how do you turn the water on
01:35 - how long do you rub your hands together
01:37 - if you wanted to tell a robot how to
01:40 - wash their hands or claws you would need
01:43 - to include these exact specific
01:45 - instructions for how to do every single
01:48 - step
01:49 - so what do you think happens if the
01:51 - sequence is written incorrectly in a
01:53 - programs code you guessed it the program
01:57 - won't run correctly this is called a bug
02:01 - depending on the mistake in your code a
02:03 - bug can make programs crash freeze or
02:07 - have other things happen debugging which
02:10 - means finding and fixing the mistakes in
02:12 - your code is something that every
02:15 - programmer does just like when we make
02:17 - mistakes in writing or math we have to
02:20 - find and fix the errors you did it now
02:25 - it's your turn
02:26 - practice putting commands in the correct
02:28 - sequence to instruct the fuzz how to get
02:31 - through the maze if you have a bug in
02:35 - your code just try again
02:39 - [Music]
02:46 - you
