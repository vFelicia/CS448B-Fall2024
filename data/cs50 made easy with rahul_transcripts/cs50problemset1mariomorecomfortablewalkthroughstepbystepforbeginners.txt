00:00 - hey guys so today we're gonna be doing
00:02 - Mario more comfortable now it's very
00:04 - very similar to Mario less comfortable
00:07 - but just with a few extra steps so I
00:09 - highly suggest if you haven't done the
00:11 - my you're less comfortable you watch
00:13 - that video first it's in the link in the
00:15 - description so you do that first and
00:17 - this will be much much easier I promise
00:19 - you that so what we're gonna do in this
00:23 - program what we have to do if we have to
00:25 - print a pyramid whose height depends on
00:27 - the user once again it's the same thing
00:29 - so if the user input side of APE we need
00:31 - to print a pyramid with the height of
00:33 - eight and if the user it puts a height
00:35 - of four we need to print a pyramid with
00:36 - a height of four and so on and so forth
00:38 - we've been through this and Amaya's
00:39 - comfortable now the more comfortable
00:42 - version just actually has an extra
00:45 - permit here so remember in the last
00:48 - comfortable version we printed a permit
00:50 - that was right aligned now we just need
00:52 - to print another permit next to that
00:55 - pyramid that's left aligned right that's
00:57 - the only difference between the last and
00:59 - more comfortable versions so to start us
01:01 - off we're gonna actually just copy and
01:04 - paste the code from our last comfortable
01:06 - version and just make a few
01:07 - modifications because it's exactly the
01:10 - same so if you recall this code which we
01:14 - had earlier from the last comfortable
01:17 - when we compile it and run it this is
01:21 - the output right it's all right it's
01:24 - right aligned pyramid alright so we knew
01:26 - that now all we need to do is print a
01:29 - left aligned pyramid beside it okay
01:32 - so the differences are we need a space
01:35 - right we need spaces and we need hashes
01:39 - okay so now you might be tempted
01:43 - immediately to just start another for
01:45 - loop because you might be thinking like
01:47 - okay we've used for loop for everything
01:49 - so far now he is another for loop for
01:51 - the spaces and other for loop for the
01:52 - hashes but you would be wrong
01:54 - because of this simple thing if you try
01:58 - to see a pattern of the number of spaces
01:59 - on every line you'll notice that there
02:02 - is none because the spaces on every line
02:05 - is actually two so on line one there are
02:08 - two spaces online too there are two
02:09 - spaces on line three there are two
02:11 - spaces and so on and so forth
02:13 - so the number of spaces as actually a
02:15 - constant it doesn't depend on anything
02:17 - for Mme line there are only two spaces
02:20 - which means that we don't need any sort
02:23 - of loop how we did Lu is very simply
02:25 - just printf space space we need two
02:30 - spaces all right and that's it now all
02:35 - we need to do next is print a left align
02:39 - pyramid right that's all this is it's a
02:40 - right line pyramid next to a left line
02:42 - pyramid so we know that the spaces come
02:45 - first because the spaces come in between
02:47 - the two hashes so now all we need to do
02:50 - is print a laugh like Burma that's it
02:52 - and we've done this before it the last
02:54 - comfortable version so what we need to
02:56 - do is for column equals 0 call them less
03:02 - than or equal to row column plus plus
03:07 - all right so we just need a print a hash
03:13 - and it's that simple and that's just
03:16 - because we've already gone through all
03:18 - the logic in the last comfortable
03:19 - version if you remember that so it's
03:22 - exactly the same logic it's the same
03:24 - conditions it's the same everything to
03:26 - print a pyramid next to this pyramid all
03:29 - right and it's all within the same main
03:31 - loop so basically what's happening here
03:33 - is this whole loop is we're printing a
03:36 - new line before we print a new line we
03:38 - want to print the spaces to make the
03:40 - right line pavement actually right
03:41 - aligned we're going to print the hashes
03:43 - for the right line pyramid we want to
03:46 - put the spaces between the left line and
03:48 - the right line pyramid and finally we
03:51 - want to print the hashes for the left
03:52 - line pyramid so it really is that simple
03:55 - now let's just check its compiler code
03:57 - and dot slash Mario to run it I'm sure
04:02 - right here let's save for and that's
04:05 - pretty much it guys it's very very
04:07 - simple if you've completed the last
04:08 - comfortable version everything just
04:10 - makes sense logically and if you want
04:13 - you can go ahead and check 50 and
04:17 - everything should be okay here as we
04:20 - know so type in your github username
04:24 - and password alright and while this is
04:31 - preparing guys I'm gonna be uploading
04:33 - every single problem set for the cs50
04:36 - course so make sure to subscribe cuz
04:39 - you're gonna get the entire cs50 course
04:41 - solutions on this channel also make sure
04:43 - to leave a like on this video if it
04:45 - helped you I hope it was simple enough
04:47 - to understand it was just literally two
04:48 - extra steps from the last comfortable
04:51 - version and that's pretty much it for
04:53 - this video guys I hope you enjoyed and
04:55 - yeah
04:57 - peace bye David
