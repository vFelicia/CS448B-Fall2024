00:00 - in this video we're going to be going
00:01 - over cs50 practice problem called half
00:03 - and make sure you watch all the way to
00:05 - the end because it's going to be a
00:06 - step-by-step guide for beginners now
00:08 - let's jump straight into it okay so the
00:09 - goal of the program is to calculate your
00:11 - half of the bill including tax and tip
00:13 - and for that we're gonna need three
00:14 - inputs which is the bill amount the
00:16 - sales tax percentage and the tip
00:18 - percentage right let's just go through
00:19 - quick example now as you get what I mean
00:21 - so let's say the bill amount is a
00:23 - hundred dollars and the tax is 10 and we
00:25 - want to tip 20 and it's important to
00:27 - note here that the tip is going to be as
00:28 - a percentage of the bill after tax not
00:31 - just the initial bill amount and you'll
00:32 - get what I mean in a second so first
00:33 - things first we want to calculate the
00:35 - tax amount which will just be the bill
00:37 - amount multiplied by the tax percentage
00:39 - right this logically so tax the tax
00:41 - amount will be a hundred dollars which
00:43 - is the bill amount multiplied by the tax
00:45 - percentages ten percent or 0.1 and so
00:48 - that gives us the tax amount of ten
00:49 - dollars and now we need to know what the
00:51 - total of the bill plus tax is right it's
00:54 - very step by step so the total is the
00:56 - bill amount which is hundred dollars
00:58 - plus the tax amount which is ten dollars
01:01 - right so the first Total which is Bill
01:03 - after tax so this amount is a hundred
01:06 - and ten dollars and now our tip is 20 so
01:09 - it's going to be twenty percent of the
01:10 - bill plus tax right which is 110 so tip
01:13 - amount is a hundred and ten dollars
01:15 - times 0.2 which is twenty percent which
01:18 - is equal to twenty two dollars and now
01:20 - to know the bill after tax and debt
01:22 - which is the total bill is going to be
01:24 - our total one which is the bill plus tax
01:26 - plus the tip amount which is what we
01:28 - just calculated so it's gonna be Bill
01:29 - plus tax it's a total one plus the tip
01:31 - amount which comes out to be a hundred
01:33 - and thirty two dollars but we're not
01:35 - done there because remember we usually
01:36 - calculate half of the bill so this total
01:39 - we just divided by two and we get an
01:41 - amount which is going to be your half of
01:42 - the bill the user is half of the bill so
01:44 - basically when the user inputs a bill
01:46 - amount of hundred a tax percentage of 10
01:48 - and a tip percentage of 20 our program
01:50 - will output sixty six dollars okay now
01:52 - that we get the logic let's jump
01:54 - straight into the code so we can kind of
01:55 - see how it works in programming first
01:57 - let's go through the code line by line
01:58 - and try to understand it first it
02:00 - includes the standard libraries the
02:01 - function called half which outputs a
02:03 - float and takes in three inputs which is
02:05 - Bill tax and tip okay that makes sense
02:07 - that's what we discussed earlier let's
02:09 - go to the main function float build
02:10 - amount gets get float built before tax
02:13 - and tip okay so here get flow right
02:14 - they're trying to get a float from the
02:16 - user so they're prompting the user for
02:17 - the bill amount and then after that
02:19 - they're prompting the user for the sales
02:21 - tax percentage and finally we're
02:22 - prompting the user for the tip
02:24 - percentage right just as we discussed
02:25 - earlier this is being put into code
02:27 - finally we want to print you will owe
02:29 - this amount each and it's going to be a
02:30 - float right percent F to two decimal
02:33 - points okay that's just what this means
02:35 - and it's going to take the value from a
02:36 - function called half which takes in the
02:39 - bill amount X percentage and tip
02:40 - percentage and our job here is to
02:42 - complete the function called half right
02:44 - so we need to do all the calculations
02:45 - then we need to finally output half so
02:48 - that the program can use it so we've
02:49 - already established that the first step
02:50 - is calculate the tax amount which is
02:52 - going to be your bill amount multiplied
02:54 - by a tax percentage so let's go ahead
02:56 - and put them to code let's make a
02:58 - variable let's call it tax amount right
03:00 - just keeping things simple we can call
03:02 - it anything we want so this tax amount
03:04 - is going to be your bill multiplied by
03:06 - your tax percentage that's going to be
03:07 - tax over 100 don't forget to divide by
03:10 - 100 because remember the user is going
03:12 - to input they're going to write 10 or 20
03:13 - or 30 right so if they're at 10 we need
03:15 - to convert it to 0.1 as in our example
03:18 - so we need to divide by 100 to make it
03:20 - from percentage to decimal so now we
03:21 - have the tax amount our next step is to
03:24 - calculate the bill after tax which
03:26 - logically is just going to be Bill plus
03:28 - the tax amount so let's go ahead and do
03:29 - that let's call it total one it's just a
03:32 - bill after tax gonna be Bill plus tax
03:35 - amount
03:36 - okay so far so good what's the next step
03:39 - next step is exactly the tip okay and we
03:42 - carefully tip as a percentage of the
03:43 - bill after tax or total one so let's
03:47 - call it tip amount just keeping it
03:49 - simple again uh is going to be told to
03:51 - one multiplied by tip divide by 100
03:54 - right which is just converting the tip
03:56 - into decimal from Prestige now we have
03:59 - the tip amount which is a percentage of
04:00 - the total bill including tax what's the
04:03 - next step well the next step is simply
04:05 - total everything right which is the
04:07 - build plus tax plus the tip so build
04:09 - plus tax we already know is in total one
04:11 - so let's just make another total let's
04:13 - call it total two which is an arbitrary
04:15 - name which is going to be total one
04:17 - which is build plus tax plus the tip
04:20 - amount right it's going to be a bill
04:22 - after tax and tip and remember we're not
04:24 - done here because as the program is
04:26 - called we need to calculate half of the
04:27 - bill right so all we need to do is take
04:29 - the bill after tax and dip and then
04:31 - divide it by two so that's simple enough
04:33 - so let's call it half right the variable
04:37 - we want float half is going to be total
04:39 - two which is Bill after tax and tip
04:42 - divided by two okay and that seems
04:44 - simple enough and finally oh if they
04:46 - return 0.0 we don't want to return zero
04:48 - we instead want to return half okay
04:50 - that's the variable we want to return
04:51 - now let's try to make this program let's
04:54 - try to compile it see if we made any
04:55 - mistakes
04:57 - half okay luckily we didn't make any
04:58 - mistakes let's try to run it build
05:01 - before tax and dip let's do it as our
05:02 - example earlier 110 and 20 and over here
05:05 - it says you will owe 55 each whereas in
05:09 - our example we calculated as 66 dollars
05:12 - each
05:13 - so what could the mistake be here well
05:15 - if you're a complete beginner this might
05:17 - not jump out at you right away but I
05:18 - made this mistake on purpose so you can
05:20 - let this valuable lesson so over here
05:22 - you can see that tip as an integer right
05:25 - so when we're calculating the tip amount
05:27 - over here it's going to be Total 1
05:29 - multiplied by tip divided by 100. but if
05:34 - it's an INT let's say they input 20 20
05:37 - over 100 as we know is 0.2 but since
05:40 - it's an end it's just gonna round off to
05:42 - the nearest whole number so it's
05:44 - actually just going to be zero you know
05:46 - that's why the tip did not get
05:47 - calculated and if you see uh over here
05:50 - 100 plus 10 divided by 2 is 55 dollars
05:53 - right so it did not take into account
05:55 - the tip at all why because tip is
05:58 - actually an INT whereas tip should be a
06:01 - float right so then we can get those
06:03 - precise values we need it to be correct
06:05 - to the decimals we can't just have it
06:07 - rounding off to an end so over here this
06:09 - tip amount will result in zero
06:11 - regardless of the tip we put in so this
06:13 - is a mistake over here that has one
06:15 - simple fix which just we just need to
06:17 - tell the computer hey take this tip as a
06:19 - decimal please and we could simply do
06:22 - that by saying 100.0 right this is the
06:25 - simplest way to do it let's see if that
06:27 - solves it make half dot slash half and
06:29 - again same numbers 110 and 20 and now we
06:32 - or 66 each so that's all for today guys
