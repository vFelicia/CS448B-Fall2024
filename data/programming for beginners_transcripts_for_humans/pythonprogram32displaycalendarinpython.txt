00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to display the calendar
00:05 - so in order to display calendar in
00:08 - Python we use the calendar built-in
00:10 - module and the month function inside
00:13 - this module so guys we are going to
00:15 - check this with the help of example as
00:16 - well now month function takes two
00:18 - parameters that is the first one will be
00:20 - the year and the second one will be the
00:22 - month so guys let us check this with the
00:24 - help of example using the Python program
00:26 - in vs code so the very first thing that
00:29 - we have to do is we need to import the
00:31 - calendar module so we use the import
00:33 - keyword followed by calendar as you can
00:36 - see vs code is suggesting us this
00:38 - calendar module which we are going to
00:40 - use now guys after this it is very
00:41 - simple what we can do is either we can
00:43 - take the input from the user in order to
00:46 - enter the year and the month or else we
00:49 - can assign it to a variable so let's say
00:51 - the year that we want to display the
00:53 - calendar of is 2023 and the current
00:56 - month that is going on right now is the
00:58 - month of May so over here the month will
01:01 - be assigned the value of 5 and the year
01:03 - is being assigned the value of 2023. now
01:06 - guys it is very simple in order to print
01:08 - the calendar for this particular month
01:10 - what we can simply do is we can have the
01:13 - print function and inside this we can
01:15 - use this calendar module over here that
01:18 - we have just imported so we have
01:20 - calendar module followed by Dot and then
01:23 - we have the function that is month
01:25 - inside this calendar module so when we
01:28 - use this month it takes two parameters
01:30 - the first parameter will be the year and
01:32 - the second parameter will be the month
01:33 - so for that particular year and month
01:35 - the calendar will be displayed so guys
01:37 - over here we will provide the variable
01:40 - that is here followed by comma and then
01:42 - we have month over here so let me just
01:45 - save this file now and try running this
01:46 - code
01:48 - so as you can see we have got a calendar
01:49 - over here today's date is 23 as you can
01:52 - see 23rd May 2023 and for 23rd May 2023
01:57 - the day is Tuesday so this is how very
02:00 - easily we can generate the calendar of
02:02 - any month and the Year guys let's say if
02:05 - you want to get the calendar of the next
02:07 - month that is the month of June over
02:09 - here so what we can do is simply we can
02:11 - provide the month value as 6 and let me
02:13 - just save this file now so the 31st date
02:16 - over here it is on Wednesday so the next
02:18 - day that is the 1st of June should be
02:20 - starting from Thursday over here so let
02:23 - me just run this code once again so as
02:25 - you can see for the month of June 2023
02:28 - we are getting the first date from
02:30 - Thursday over here and so on the other
02:32 - dates are being displayed and over here
02:34 - we are having the days being displayed
02:36 - guys you can also find on which day you
02:38 - were born so let's say you know the
02:40 - birth date but you don't know the day so
02:42 - over here let's say if you were born in
02:43 - 2001 so we will simply provide 2001 over
02:47 - here and then let's say the month was
02:49 - December so over here the month will be
02:51 - 12 which is December in this case so let
02:54 - me just save this file now and try
02:55 - running this code so as you can see we
02:57 - have got the calendar of December 2001
03:00 - and let's say the date of birth was 21st
03:02 - so over here 21st December 2001 the day
03:06 - was Friday so this is how you can come
03:09 - to know that on which day you were born
03:10 - provided that you know your date of
03:12 - birth so guys this is a very simple
03:14 - method in order to print the calendar
03:16 - using the Python program guys let's say
03:18 - the year was 2005 so over here 2005 is
03:22 - the year and let's say it was the month
03:24 - of January so guys using this Python
03:26 - program which was that day on which the
03:29 - date was 10 and the month was first and
03:31 - the year was 2005. comment in the
03:34 - comment section below that day for this
03:36 - particular date let us see whether your
03:38 - answer is correct or not make sure that
03:39 - you like this video so that it reaches
03:41 - to more people and subscribe to this
03:43 - channel so that you get the

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to display the calendar so in order to display calendar in Python we use the calendar builtin module and the month function inside this module so guys we are going to check this with the help of example as well now month function takes two parameters that is the first one will be the year and the second one will be the month so guys let us check this with the help of example using the Python program in vs code so the very first thing that we have to do is we need to import the calendar module so we use the import keyword followed by calendar as you can see vs code is suggesting us this calendar module which we are going to use now guys after this it is very simple what we can do is either we can take the input from the user in order to enter the year and the month or else we can assign it to a variable so let's say the year that we want to display the calendar of is 2023 and the current month that is going on right now is the month of May so over here the month will be assigned the value of 5 and the year is being assigned the value of 2023. now guys it is very simple in order to print the calendar for this particular month what we can simply do is we can have the print function and inside this we can use this calendar module over here that we have just imported so we have calendar module followed by Dot and then we have the function that is month inside this calendar module so when we use this month it takes two parameters the first parameter will be the year and the second parameter will be the month so for that particular year and month the calendar will be displayed so guys over here we will provide the variable that is here followed by comma and then we have month over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we have got a calendar over here today's date is 23 as you can see 23rd May 2023 and for 23rd May 2023 the day is Tuesday so this is how very easily we can generate the calendar of any month and the Year guys let's say if you want to get the calendar of the next month that is the month of June over here so what we can do is simply we can provide the month value as 6 and let me just save this file now so the 31st date over here it is on Wednesday so the next day that is the 1st of June should be starting from Thursday over here so let me just run this code once again so as you can see for the month of June 2023 we are getting the first date from Thursday over here and so on the other dates are being displayed and over here we are having the days being displayed guys you can also find on which day you were born so let's say you know the birth date but you don't know the day so over here let's say if you were born in 2001 so we will simply provide 2001 over here and then let's say the month was December so over here the month will be 12 which is December in this case so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we have got the calendar of December 2001 and let's say the date of birth was 21st so over here 21st December 2001 the day was Friday so this is how you can come to know that on which day you were born provided that you know your date of birth so guys this is a very simple method in order to print the calendar using the Python program guys let's say the year was 2005 so over here 2005 is the year and let's say it was the month of January so guys using this Python program which was that day on which the date was 10 and the month was first and the year was 2005. comment in the comment section below that day for this particular date let us see whether your answer is correct or not make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is Python program to add two mattresses so stay tuned
