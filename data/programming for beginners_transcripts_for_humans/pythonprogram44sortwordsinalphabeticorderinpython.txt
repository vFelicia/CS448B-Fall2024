00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to sort words in
00:06 - alphabetical order so guys in this
00:08 - program you will learn to sort the words
00:11 - in the alphabetical order using the for
00:14 - Loop and display it so guys as you can
00:16 - see for example we have this my string
00:19 - variable and we have these words inside
00:22 - the string so what we are going to do is
00:24 - we are going to sort all these words
00:26 - alphabetically and display it on the
00:28 - console using the Python program so
00:31 - basically the word starting with a
00:32 - should come first and then followed by B
00:35 - and then so on all the words should be
00:37 - sorted and must be displayed over here
00:39 - so guys let us check this with the help
00:41 - of the Python program in the vs code so
00:44 - what we will do is first of all we will
00:45 - Define the string so I'll simply copy
00:48 - this line of code over here and paste
00:50 - this in which we have the mystr variable
00:53 - and this is the string that we have now
00:56 - guys in order to sort all these words in
00:58 - the alphabetical order we need to first
01:00 - split them by using the split function
01:03 - that is present with this my string
01:05 - variable and then store it inside the
01:08 - list by transforming all the words to
01:11 - the lower case so guys as we can observe
01:13 - over here we are having some capital
01:15 - letters as well at the start of the
01:17 - string since the ASCII values of the
01:19 - capital letters will be less compared to
01:22 - those of the small letters we want to
01:24 - trade all of them as the lowercase
01:26 - letters so what we will be doing is
01:28 - first of all we will be splitting this
01:30 - entire string using the space characters
01:32 - over here so we will use my string
01:34 - followed by Dot and then we have the
01:36 - split function so guys this will help us
01:38 - in order to return all these words which
01:40 - are separated by the space characters
01:42 - and then guys what we will be doing is
01:44 - we use the for Loop and then for each
01:47 - word in this my string dot split
01:50 - function so basically all the words are
01:52 - being assigned to this word over here
01:54 - now and then this word needs to be
01:56 - converted to the lower case so over here
01:59 - we will say word followed by a DOT and
02:02 - then we will say lower now guys what
02:04 - exactly is happening over here is first
02:06 - of all we are splitting this my string
02:08 - to individual words over here and each
02:11 - word is being converted to the lower
02:12 - case by using this word dot lower and
02:15 - then guys what we will be doing is we
02:17 - will store it inside the list so over
02:19 - here we are enclosing this entire line
02:22 - of code with the open and closed square
02:24 - brackets and then before this we will
02:26 - have words as the name of the variable
02:29 - so guys basically what exactly is
02:31 - happening is all the words over here
02:33 - that are present inside these strings is
02:35 - being converted to the lowercase letters
02:38 - and it is being stored in this words
02:39 - list now guys simply we can use the sort
02:42 - function inside the list over here so we
02:45 - will say words followed by Dot and then
02:47 - we have something called as sort which
02:49 - will help us in order to sort all the
02:52 - words alphabetically and then guys after
02:54 - using the sort method we will have all
02:57 - the words inside the words variable
02:59 - being sort alphabetically so what we can
03:02 - do is simply we will use the for Loop
03:04 - once again forward in words and then we
03:08 - can print all these words so over here
03:10 - we will say print and then print this
03:13 - word followed by comma and then we can
03:15 - have the end parameter as well which
03:18 - will have the space character so over
03:19 - here all the words will be separated
03:21 - using the space characters and it will
03:24 - not go to the next line so guys let me
03:26 - just save this file now and try running
03:27 - this code so as you can see we are
03:29 - getting the entire string inside which
03:31 - all the words are being sorted
03:33 - alphabetically so as you can see we have
03:35 - a followed by C and then we have e h i
03:39 - and then L and then T and then W so guys
03:42 - basically the first character is being
03:44 - checked whether it is small or not
03:46 - followed by the second character and
03:48 - then so on all the words are being
03:49 - sorted alphabetically over here we can
03:52 - also print the original string as well
03:54 - what we can do is simply have the print
03:56 - statement and we can say orange null so
03:59 - train in this case followed by colon and
04:03 - then we can have my string over here
04:04 - this will help us in order to print the
04:07 - original string as well so as you can
04:08 - see this is the original string and this
04:10 - is the string after having all the words
04:13 - being alphabetically sorted inside that
04:16 - string so guys this is one of the
04:17 - important python programs that you can
04:19 - be asked while you are going for an
04:21 - interview as well so please make sure
04:23 - that you practice on your own so that on
04:24 - different inputs you get different
04:26 - outputs the way that we have split the
04:28 - words by using the split function over
04:30 - here and then taking each word at a time
04:33 - and then converting it into a lower case
04:35 - just by using one line of code in Python
04:38 - proves that how easily we can achieve
04:40 - simple task in the Python programming
04:42 - language so make sure that you like this
04:44 - video so that it reaches to more people
04:46 - and subscribe to this channel so that
04:48 - you get the notifications on upcoming
04:49 - videos as well the next video that we
04:51 - are going to talk about is Python
04:53 - program to illustrate different set
04:55 - operations so stay tuned

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to sort words in alphabetical order so guys in this program you will learn to sort the words in the alphabetical order using the for Loop and display it so guys as you can see for example we have this my string variable and we have these words inside the string so what we are going to do is we are going to sort all these words alphabetically and display it on the console using the Python program so basically the word starting with a should come first and then followed by B and then so on all the words should be sorted and must be displayed over here so guys let us check this with the help of the Python program in the vs code so what we will do is first of all we will Define the string so I'll simply copy this line of code over here and paste this in which we have the mystr variable and this is the string that we have now guys in order to sort all these words in the alphabetical order we need to first split them by using the split function that is present with this my string variable and then store it inside the list by transforming all the words to the lower case so guys as we can

Dot and then we have the split function so guys this will help us in order to return all these words which are separated by the space characters and then guys what we will be doing is we use the for

over here we will say word followed by a DOT and then we will say lower now guys what exactly is happening over here is first of all we are splitting this my string to individual words over here and

present inside these strings is being converted to the lowercase letters and it is being stored in this words list now guys simply we can use the sort function inside the list over here so we will say words followed by Dot and then we have something called as sort which will help us in order to sort all the words alphabetically and then guys after using the sort method we will have all the words inside the words variable being sort alphabetically so what we can do is simply we will use the for Loop once again forward in words and then we can print all these words so over here we will say

this is the original string and this is the string after having all the words being alphabetically sorted inside that string so guys this is one of the important python programs that you can be asked
