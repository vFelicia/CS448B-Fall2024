00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to learn
00:03 - about basic input and output in Python
00:06 - Programming so guys in this tutorial we
00:08 - will learn simple ways to display output
00:11 - to the users and take input from users
00:13 - in Python with the help of examples now
00:16 - guys as we have seen previously in
00:18 - Python we can simply use the print
00:20 - function to print the output so let us
00:22 - check this with the help of example over
00:24 - here so I simply want to print a
00:26 - statement so let's say I want to print
00:28 - programming for beginners that is the
00:31 - name of this YouTube channel which you
00:33 - should definitely subscribe if you have
00:34 - not subscribed it yet so once we provide
00:37 - the string inside the double quotes we
00:39 - can simply save this file and try
00:41 - running this code now so on the terminal
00:43 - we will be able to see the string
00:45 - getting printed that is programming for
00:47 - beginners I have missed out an O
00:49 - character over here so this is the
00:50 - correct string so programming for
00:52 - beginners is the string that we want to
00:54 - print and that is what we have got over
00:56 - here in the terminal now guys even with
00:58 - this print function over here this is
00:59 - function and it takes certain parameters
01:02 - so parameters are nothing but certain
01:04 - values that you can provide to the
01:05 - function so as you can see the actual
01:08 - syntax of the print function accepts
01:10 - five parameters so basically we have
01:12 - only provided one parameter over here
01:14 - this can be treated as a parameter that
01:16 - is the value that we want to print now
01:18 - apart from this we also have other
01:20 - parameters as well so object is the
01:23 - parameter which is nothing but the value
01:25 - to be printed apart from that we have
01:27 - separator then we have end parameter
01:29 - file and then flush parameter so these
01:32 - are the five parameters and these are
01:34 - the descriptions of each and every
01:35 - parameter so over here the separator
01:37 - which is an optional parameter since we
01:40 - have not provided any separator over
01:42 - here it allows us to separate multiple
01:44 - objects inside print so let's say after
01:47 - this string I want to provide another
01:49 - number over here so let's say 1 2 3 4 is
01:52 - the number that I want to provide now I
01:54 - want these objects that is one is
01:55 - programming for beginners which is a
01:57 - string and another object that is a
01:59 - number to be separated using commas so
02:01 - what we will do is after providing comma
02:04 - we will use the SCP that is another
02:06 - parameter as you can see vs code is
02:08 - providing us the auto completion feature
02:10 - over here so we just need to select that
02:13 - and then we need to provide single
02:15 - quotes and inside this we provide comma
02:18 - followed by the space character so guys
02:20 - what will happen is all the objects will
02:22 - be separated by using this comma in the
02:24 - space character over here it depends on
02:26 - your requirement how many objects you
02:28 - want to provide inside this print
02:30 - statement so let me just save this file
02:32 - and try running this code now
02:33 - so as you can see programming for
02:35 - beginners and then we have this comma
02:37 - followed by the space character and then
02:39 - we have this one two three four object
02:41 - being printed over here we can have
02:43 - another object so let's say I provide
02:45 - another string that is another statement
02:48 - over here so let me just save this file
02:50 - and try running this code now so we are
02:52 - getting an error invalid syntax perhaps
02:54 - you forgot a comma so basically after
02:56 - providing each and every object we have
02:58 - to separate it using the comma over here
03:00 - and then let me just save this file and
03:02 - try running this code now so as you can
03:04 - see programming for beginners followed
03:06 - by comma and then we have space
03:07 - characters and then we have one two
03:09 - three four again we have comma and then
03:11 - space character and then we have another
03:13 - statement so guys in this way we can use
03:15 - the separator parameter as well in order
03:17 - to separate the different objects inside
03:19 - the print function now going to next
03:21 - parameter which is end over here which
03:23 - is again optional by default it is the
03:26 - slash n character in which case the
03:28 - control flow goes to the next line
03:30 - Whenever there is another object that is
03:31 - getting printed over here so as you can
03:33 - see it allows us to add specific values
03:36 - like new line or tab character so guys
03:38 - let's say we have this print function
03:40 - over here I'll just remove this part of
03:42 - the line over here and let's say I have
03:44 - another print function in which case I
03:47 - am providing another statement so let's
03:49 - say we have another statement over here
03:52 - so guys what will happen is by default
03:54 - this and the parameter is having the
03:56 - slash n character which means the
03:58 - control flow should go to the new line
04:00 - Whenever there is a next print statement
04:02 - that is encountered so let me just save
04:04 - this file and try running this code now
04:05 - so as you can see programming for
04:07 - beginner string is getting printed in
04:09 - first line and on the second line
04:11 - another statement is getting printed now
04:13 - what if we want both these statements to
04:15 - be printed on the same line but they are
04:18 - present in the different print function
04:19 - so what we will have to do is in the
04:22 - first print function I will provide a
04:24 - comma over here and then we have the end
04:26 - parameter so as you can see this end
04:28 - parameter we have to select and then
04:30 - inside the double quotes I'll simply
04:32 - provide the full stop top followed by
04:34 - the space character so guys what is
04:36 - happening over here is after the string
04:38 - is getting printed at the end of the
04:41 - line we are providing this full stop and
04:43 - then followed by the space character and
04:45 - then whenever there is a next string
04:46 - that is encountered by the control flow
04:48 - it will get printed on the same line so
04:51 - let me just save this file and try
04:52 - running this code now so as you can see
04:54 - programming for beginners and then we
04:56 - have a full stop and then we have the
04:58 - space character as well and then we have
05:00 - another statement that is getting
05:01 - printed so guys we can also use this end
05:04 - parameter if we want multiple print
05:07 - functions to be used but all the objects
05:09 - need to be printed on the same line the
05:12 - other two parameters are file which is
05:13 - again optional where the values are
05:16 - printed so basically by default the
05:18 - values are printed on the screen and
05:19 - that is why its default value is system
05:22 - dot STD out which means it should print
05:24 - on the screen you can also provide some
05:27 - file path over here so that the content
05:29 - can be written in the file apart from
05:31 - that we also have the flush which is
05:33 - again an optional parameter it is a
05:35 - Boolean specifying if the output is
05:37 - flushed or buffered so by default it is
05:39 - having the false value so Guys these two
05:41 - parameters you can practice on your own
05:43 - as a homework for you apart from that
05:45 - guys it is very important that how do
05:47 - you take input from the user in Python
05:50 - Programming so basically while
05:51 - programming we might want to take the
05:54 - input from the user in Python we can use
05:57 - the input function so as you can see we
05:59 - have a variable over here or we can say
06:01 - identifier it is equal to we have used
06:04 - the input function so guys this input
06:06 - function it will take a parameter which
06:08 - will be kind of a label which will be
06:10 - printed on the screen for the user as a
06:13 - instruction so we are asking the user to
06:15 - enter a number and the number that will
06:17 - be entered by the user will be stored in
06:20 - this num variable over here so guys let
06:22 - us check this with the help of example
06:24 - now I'll just remove these lines of code
06:26 - so what we have to do is let's say we
06:28 - provide the number variable it is equal
06:30 - to we have to use the input function as
06:32 - you can see this is the function that is
06:34 - being suggested by the vs code over here
06:36 - and then using the open and close
06:38 - parenthesis inside this we have to
06:41 - provide a string inside the double
06:43 - quotes so we can simply provide enter a
06:45 - number now this is a instruction to the
06:48 - user to enter the number now guys what
06:50 - we can do is we can print this number
06:52 - now we can easily print this by using a
06:54 - string so let's say we provided the
06:56 - string over here that is entered number
07:00 - is and Then followed by colon and then
07:03 - after this object we have to provide a
07:04 - comma and then we can provide the number
07:07 - variable to be printed so we have
07:09 - provided the number variable over here
07:10 - let me just save this file and try
07:12 - running this code now so as you can see
07:14 - it is asking the user over here to enter
07:16 - a number so what I will provide is
07:18 - simply I will provide 10 as the number
07:20 - and then when I press enter as you can
07:23 - see entered number is 10. so this string
07:26 - is getting printed along with the number
07:28 - that is being entered by the user now
07:30 - guys it is very important to note that
07:32 - whenever we are using this input
07:34 - function the input that is taken by the
07:37 - user will be of the type string over
07:39 - here so if you print the type of this
07:41 - number variable over here let me just do
07:43 - that so we simply provide data type of
07:47 - number colon and then what we have to do
07:50 - is after comma we have to use the type
07:52 - function and inside this function we
07:55 - have to provide the number variable let
07:57 - me just save this file and try running
07:58 - this code now enter a number so let's
08:01 - say I provide 10 as the number as you
08:03 - can see enter number is 10 and after
08:05 - this data type of number it is class
08:08 - string so this is of string data type so
08:11 - whatever input is being taken from the
08:13 - user it will be stored as a string so
08:15 - what we have to do is we have to convert
08:17 - it into a number now since this is a
08:19 - string we cannot add another number to
08:22 - this particular number so let's say if
08:23 - we try to add some another number over
08:25 - here so we simply do number plus 5 over
08:28 - here let me just save this file enter
08:30 - running this code now so when we provide
08:33 - 10 SC number when I press enter as you
08:36 - can see it says can only concatenate
08:38 - string not end that's because we are
08:40 - trying to concatenate a string with a
08:43 - number over here that is the integer so
08:45 - what we have to do is we have to convert
08:47 - this input into an integer so we can
08:50 - simply provide int over here and then
08:53 - the entire input function needs to be
08:55 - enclosed within the open and close
08:57 - parenthesis so guys this we had seen
08:59 - previously as well this is the explicit
09:01 - type conversion over here which is the
09:03 - manual type conversion in which we are
09:05 - converting the string data type to the
09:07 - integer data type and now we will have
09:09 - the integer over here which can simply
09:11 - be added with another integer so let me
09:13 - just save this file and try running this
09:15 - code now
09:16 - so as you can see enter the number this
09:18 - time let's say I provide 15 as the
09:20 - number and then when I press enter as
09:22 - you can see entered number is so what is
09:25 - happening is this number that is 15 was
09:27 - taken and then 5 was added to this
09:29 - number and that is why 15 plus 5 is 20
09:31 - and this number is getting printed over
09:34 - here and you can see this data type of
09:36 - number now it is of the type integer
09:38 - that's because we have used the type
09:40 - conversion over here so guys this is the
09:42 - way you can take input from the user
09:44 - make sure that whenever you're using the
09:46 - input function the data that is being
09:48 - entered by the user is of the type
09:50 - string and you need to convert it into
09:52 - the appropriate data type before you can
09:55 - use the other operators so guys that's
09:57 - it in this video please make sure that
09:59 - you like this video so that it reaches
10:00 - to more people and subscribe to this
10:02 - channel so that you get the
10:03 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
10:05 - the next video that we are going to talk
10:07 - about is arithmetic operators in Python
10:09 - Programming so stay tuned

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about basic input and output in Python Programming so guys in this tutorial we will learn simple ways to display output to the users and take input from users in Python with the help of examples now guys as we have seen previously in Python we can simply use the print function to print the output so let us check this with the help of example over here so I simply want to print a statement so let's say I want to print programming for beginners that is the name of this YouTube channel which you should definitely subscribe if you have not subscribed it yet so once we provide the string inside the double quotes we can simply save this file and try running this code now so on the terminal we will be able to see the string getting printed that is programming for beginners I have missed out an O character over here so this is the correct string so programming for beginners is the string that we want to print and that is what we have got over here in the terminal now guys even with this print function over here this is function and it takes certain parameters so parameters are nothing but certain values that you can provide to the function so as you can see the actual syntax of the print function accepts five parameters so basically we have only provided one parameter over here this can be treated as a parameter that is the value that we want to print now apart from this we also have other parameters as well so object is the parameter which is nothing but the value to be printed apart from that we have separator then we have end parameter file and then flush parameter so these are the five parameters and these are the descriptions of each and every parameter so over here the separator which is an optional parameter since we have not provided any separator over here it allows us to separate multiple objects inside print so let's say after this string I want to provide another number over here so let's say 1 2 3 4 is the number that I want to provide now I want these objects that is one is programming for beginners which is a string and another object that is a number to be separated using commas so what we will do is after providing comma we will use the SCP that is another parameter as you can see vs code is providing us the auto completion feature over here so we just need to select that and then we need to provide single quotes and inside this we provide comma followed by the space character so guys what will happen is all the objects will be separated by using this comma in the space character over here it depends on your requirement how many objects you want to provide inside this print statement so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see programming for beginners and then we have this comma followed by the space character and then we have this one two three four object being printed over here we can have another object so let's say I provide another string that is another statement over here so let me just save this file and try running this code now so we are getting an error invalid syntax perhaps you forgot a comma so basically after providing each and every object we have to separate it using the comma over here and then let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see programming for beginners followed by comma and then we have space characters and then we have one two three four again we have comma and then space character and then we have another statement so guys in this way we can use the separator parameter as well in order to separate the different objects inside the print function now going to next parameter which is end over here which is again optional by default it is the slash n character in which case the control flow goes to the next line Whenever there is another object that is getting printed over here so as you can see it allows us to add specific values like new line or tab character so guys let's say we have this print function over here I'll just remove this part of the line over here and let's say I have another print function in which case I am providing another statement so let's say we have another statement over here so guys what will happen is by default this and the parameter is having the slash n character which means the control flow should go to the new line Whenever there is a next print statement that is encountered so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see programming for beginner string is getting printed in first line and on the second line another statement is getting printed now what if we want both these statements to be printed on the same line but they are present in the different print function so what we will have to do is in the first print function I will provide a comma over here and then we have the end parameter so as you can see this end parameter we have to select and then inside the double quotes I'll simply provide the full stop top followed by the space character so guys what is happening over here is after the string is getting printed at the end of the line we are providing this full stop and then followed by the space character and then whenever there is a next string that is encountered by the control flow it will get printed on the same line so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see programming for beginners and then we have a full stop and then we have the space character as well and then we have another statement that is getting printed so guys we can also use this end parameter if we want multiple print functions to be used but all the objects need to be printed on the same line the other two parameters are file which is again optional where the values are printed so basically by default the values are printed on the screen and that is why its default value is system dot STD out which means it should print on the screen you can also provide some file path over here so that the content can be written in the file apart from that we also have the flush which is again an optional parameter it is a Boolean specifying if the output is flushed or buffered so by default it is having the false value so Guys these two parameters you can practice on your own as a homework for you apart from that guys it is very important that how do you take input from the user in Python Programming so basically while programming we might want to take the input from the user in Python we can

function and inside this function we have to provide the number variable let me just save this file and try running this code now enter a number so let's say I provide 10 as the number as you can see enter number is 10 and after this data type of number it is class string so this is of string data type so whatever input is being taken from the user it will be stored as a string so what we have to do is we have to convert it into a number now since this is a string we cannot add another number to this particular number so let's say if we try to add some another number over here so we simply do number plus 5 over here let me just save this file enter running this code now so when we provide 10 SC number when I press enter as you can see it says can only concatenate string not end that's

happening is this number that is 15 was taken and then 5 was added to this number and that is why 15 plus 5 is 20 and this number is getting printed over here and you can see this data type of number now it is of the type integer that's because we have used the type conversion over here so guys this is the way you can take input from the user make sure that whenever you're using the input function the data that is being entered by the user is of the type string and you need to convert it into the appropriate data type before you can use the other operators so guys that's it in this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is arithmetic operators in Python Programming so stay tuned
