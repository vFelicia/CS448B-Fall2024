With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see form attribute no
00:02 - validate in form tag so guys basically
00:04 - the no validate attribute is a form
00:07 - attribute and when it is present the no
00:09 - validate specifies that all of the form
00:12 - data should not be validated when
00:14 - submitted so guys previously we had seen
00:16 - the attribute that is required which
00:19 - makes the user to provide certain value
00:21 - inside the input field that's because
00:23 - that particular input field is mandatory
00:25 - with the help of the required attribute
00:28 - but guys when we provide the no Val date
00:30 - attribute inside the form tag then it
00:33 - overwrites any of the input feelds that
00:35 - is having the required attribute and
00:37 - this is what we are going to see with
00:39 - the help of examples as well so guys let
00:41 - us move to the vs code over here and we
00:44 - have a very simple statement that is
00:46 - below content is in HTML form inside the
00:49 - paragraph tag so what we will do is we
00:51 - will provide the form with the method
00:54 - type that is get request over here and
00:56 - inside the form we will have two Fields
00:59 - the first field is is the first name so
01:01 - over here we will set it as input colon
01:04 - text and for the name attribute we will
01:06 - set it as F name and the same value we
01:09 - will copy to the ID attribute as well
01:11 - and then before this we will also have
01:13 - the label tag and for the for attribute
01:16 - we will have the same value that is f
01:17 - name and we will Define the label as
01:20 - first name in this case followed by
01:22 - colon so guys basically we have the
01:24 - input field that is the first name over
01:27 - here and then after this we are going to
01:29 - have couple of line breaks in this case
01:31 - now guys similarly we will have the
01:33 - email address as well as the second
01:35 - input field so we'll simply copy these
01:37 - lines of code and paste it over here and
01:40 - instead of type text we will have email
01:43 - in this case and for the name attribute
01:45 - we will copy the same value that is
01:47 - email and for the ID attribute as well
01:49 - we will keep the value as email over
01:51 - here for the for attribute of the label
01:54 - tag we will keep the value as email and
01:57 - instead of first name we will have the
01:58 - email label over here followed by colon
02:01 - we are asking the user to provide the
02:03 - first name and the email address and in
02:06 - this case we will make the email address
02:08 - input field mandatory so what we have to
02:10 - do is inside this input tag that is of
02:13 - the type email we will provide the
02:16 - required input field so guys basically
02:18 - this attribute is responsible in order
02:20 - to make the user to provide some data
02:23 - before submitting the form so guys after
02:25 - these couple of line breaks over here we
02:28 - will again have the submit button in
02:30 - this case so input colon submit which is
02:33 - going to define the submit button and
02:35 - for the value attribute we will have the
02:37 - submit value for this button so guys let
02:39 - me just save this file now and try
02:41 - reloading this page on the browser so as
02:43 - you can see we have the below content is
02:45 - an HTML form paragraph being displayed
02:48 - over here and then we have two fields
02:50 - that is first name and the email address
02:52 - over here now guys if we simply try to
02:55 - submit this form then as you can see we
02:57 - are getting the message that is please
02:59 - fill out this field that's because we
03:01 - have kept this input field that is email
03:03 - address as mandatory with the help of
03:06 - the required attribute over here so guys
03:08 - only after we provide certain data to
03:10 - this email input we will be able to
03:13 - submit this form so let me just provide
03:15 - some test data over here so as you can
03:17 - see we have provided test gmail.com now
03:20 - let me just click on submit button so
03:22 - now as you can see the F name and the
03:24 - email parameters are being displayed
03:26 - inside the URL over here which is being
03:28 - passed to the server so guys in this way
03:31 - the required field works now guys what
03:33 - if we don't want any of the validations
03:36 - inside the form when the user wants to
03:38 - submit this form so what we can do is we
03:40 - can use the no validate attribute that
03:43 - can be used inside the form tag so over
03:46 - here after the method that is get
03:48 - request we will simply provide no
03:50 - validate in this case so this is the
03:52 - attribute that is responsible in order
03:55 - to remove all the validations from the
03:57 - input fields that are present inside the
04:00 - form so let me just save this file now
04:02 - and try reloading this page once again
04:04 - on the browser now if you notice without
04:06 - providing any data we will be able to
04:08 - submit the form that's because we have
04:11 - provided the no validate attribute
04:13 - inside the form tag so let me just click
04:15 - on submit button over here so as you can
04:17 - see the F name and the email parameters
04:20 - are being passed to the server with the
04:22 - help of the URL over here because we
04:24 - have kept the method type as get request
04:26 - so if you notice we have not provided
04:28 - any data in inside the email address
04:31 - even though we have kept the email
04:32 - address as required over here that's
04:35 - because we have provided the no validate
04:37 - attribute inside the form tag and the
04:40 - moment we remove this no validate
04:41 - attribute from the form tag let me just
04:44 - save this file now and try reloading
04:46 - this page once again on the browser so
04:48 - now if we try to submit without
04:50 - providing any data to the email address
04:52 - it should through the validation message
04:54 - over here so when we click on submit
04:56 - Button as you can see it says please

05:00 - no validate Works in order to remove all
05:03 - the validations from the form Fields
