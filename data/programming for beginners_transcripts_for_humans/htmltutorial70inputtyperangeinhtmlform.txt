With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see input type range in
00:02 - HTML form so guys basically the input
00:05 - tag along with the type range defines a
00:08 - control for entering a number whose
00:11 - exact value is not important so we are
00:14 - going to display a slider control over
00:16 - here so basically the type range is
00:19 - responsible to display a slider control
00:22 - that the user can slide and select one
00:24 - of the values based on the Range Now the
00:26 - default range values is from 0 up to 100
00:30 - that we are going to check with the help
00:31 - of examples as well and we will also see
00:34 - the different attributes that are min
00:36 - max and step attributes so guys let us
00:38 - move to the vs code over here and
00:40 - previously we had seen the different
00:42 - input tags with the types file hidden
00:45 - month and the number as well now we are
00:47 - going to Define another input field over
00:50 - here so basically we are going to type
00:51 - input followed by colon and then we are
00:54 - going to say range over here so we type
00:56 - range so as you can see this is the Mt
00:59 - abbreviation over here which is one of
01:01 - the important features in the VSS code
01:03 - so we select this option and the type
01:05 - attribute is set to range over here now
01:07 - guys for the name part we are going to
01:09 - set it as range in this case and for the
01:12 - ID as well we are going to keep the same
01:14 - value that is range and then over here
01:16 - we will set the label and we are going
01:19 - to set the for attribute as the range
01:22 - value over here now guys let's say we
01:23 - want the user to provide the age
01:25 - previously we had asked the user to
01:27 - provide the age inside the text field
01:30 - over here but now we are going to ask
01:32 - the user to provide the age with the
01:34 - help of the slider so over here we will
01:37 - say provide your age using slider in
01:40 - this case and Then followed by colon so
01:42 - guys basically a slider will be
01:44 - displayed to the user with the help of
01:46 - this input field with the type range in
01:49 - this case and by default the range value
01:51 - will be 0 up to 100 in this case let me
01:54 - just save this file now and try
01:56 - reloading this page once again on the
01:58 - browser so as you can see provide your
02:00 - age using slider and this is the slider
02:02 - that the user can use in order to select
02:05 - one of the numbers using the slider now
02:08 - guys by default you cannot see the
02:09 - numbers over here so basically we are
02:11 - going to have another tag over here on
02:13 - the right side of the slider and we will
02:16 - have the output tag in this case so
02:18 - basically let's say after this input
02:20 - field we will have the output tag over
02:23 - here and this output tag will have the
02:25 - default value so let's say the default
02:28 - value in this case that we set is 20
02:30 - over here and the same value we are
02:32 - going to set it as 20 in this case let
02:35 - me just save this file now and try
02:36 - reloading this page once again on the
02:38 - browser so the slider is adjusted at the
02:41 - value of 20 and the same value is being
02:44 - displayed in the output tag over here
02:47 - now guys when we slide this in between
02:49 - the two numbers we cannot see the change
02:52 - in this number which is being displayed
02:54 - inside the output tag so what we have to
02:56 - do is we have to write a JavaScript code
02:59 - and then there is a attribute that we
03:00 - are going to use as you can see in order
03:03 - to display the value we have to use the
03:05 - JavaScript and this is one of the
03:07 - properties that we are going to use that
03:09 - is next element sibling so guys
03:11 - basically what is the meaning of this so
03:13 - after this input field we have the next
03:16 - element that is output which can be
03:18 - referred by using the next element
03:20 - sibling over here so what we have to do
03:22 - is inside this input field with the type
03:25 - range we will say on input over here so
03:28 - this is the attribute that we are going
03:30 - to use in such a way that when the user
03:33 - slides this particular slider over here
03:36 - the on input attribute will be called
03:39 - and inside this on input attribute we
03:41 - will be using the this keyword followed
03:44 - by Dot and then we are going to use this
03:46 - property that is next element sibling
03:50 - over here so we have next element
03:53 - sibling which is going to refer to this
03:56 - particular tag that is output in this
03:58 - case and then follow by Dot and then we
04:01 - have something called as value so
04:03 - basically what we are doing is we are
04:05 - setting the next element siblings value
04:08 - over here to which value so again we
04:10 - need to provide equal to since we need
04:12 - to assign certain value to this
04:14 - particular sibling over here after this
04:17 - input tag and the value will come from
04:19 - this input itself so basically we are
04:22 - going to use the this keyword followed
04:24 - by Dot and then we will say value so
04:27 - guys over here we are taking the value
04:29 - of the slider by using this dot value in
04:32 - this case and then this value will be
04:35 - assigned to the next element sibling
04:38 - which is the output tag in this case so
04:40 - let me just save this file now and try
04:42 - reloading this page once again on the
04:44 - browser now when the user slides over
04:46 - here as you can see the number is also
04:49 - getting updated so when the user goes to
04:52 - the extreme right you can see that the
04:53 - maximum number is 100 and to the extreme
04:56 - left the number is set to zero over here
04:59 - so guys in this way we can also have the
05:02 - number that is being displayed to the
05:03 - user by using the on input attribute and
05:07 - Then followed by the next element
05:09 - sibling property followed by Dot and
05:11 - then the value of the slider can be set
05:14 - to this particular property now guys
05:16 - apart from this we can also restrict the
05:18 - values that is the Min and the max
05:20 - values over here so what we can do is
05:22 - inside the same input tag in this case
05:24 - we can provide main attribute over here
05:27 - and let's say the minimum attribute we
05:28 - want is 18 and the maximum attribute we
05:31 - want is 60 over here so let me just save
05:34 - this file now and try reloading this
05:36 - page once again on the browser so as you
05:38 - can see the value is set to 20 by
05:40 - default and when we take it to extreme
05:42 - left the value is 18 which is the
05:44 - minimum value and to the extreme right
05:47 - the maximum value is 60 over here and
05:49 - that is what we had set as the Min and
05:51 - the max value for this particular input
05:53 - field with the type range so guys this
05:55 - is the way that you can set the input
05:57 - field with the type range over here and
06:00 - also display the number to the user so
06:02 - that the user comes to know what is the
06:04 - number that is being selected by the
06:06 - user apart from that you can also have
06:08 - the step attribute as well so let's say
06:10 - we provide the minimum value as 1 and
06:13 - the maximum value as 50 over here and we
06:16 - provide the step as 10 so in this case
06:19 - the values will be incremented or
06:21 - decremented by 10 so let me just save
06:23 - this file now and try reloading this
06:25 - page once again on the browser so as you
06:27 - can see 20 is the default value
06:30 - and then when we take it back it is 1
06:32 - and then 11 21 31 41 and then the last
06:37 - value will be 50 over here which is not
06:39 - being taken because the step value is 10
06:42 - and the maximum value should be 51 over
06:44 - here so when we set it to 51 let me just
06:46 - save this file now and try reloading
06:48 - this page now as you can see the maximum
06:50 - value that can be taken is 51 over here
06:53 - so guys in this way you can also set the
06:55 - step attribute as well for the range
06:57 - input field so comment in the comment

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see input type range in HTML form so guys basically the input tag along with the type range defines a control for entering a number whose exact value is not important so we are going to display a slider control over here so basically the type range is responsible to display a slider control that the user can slide and select one of the values based on the Range Now the default range values is from 0 up to 100 that we are going to check with the help of examples as well and we will also see the different attributes that are min max and step attributes so guys let us move to the vs code over here and previously we had seen the different input tags with the types file hidden month and the number as well now we are going to Define another input field over here so basically we are going to type input followed by colon and then we are going to say range over here so we type range so as you can see this is the Mt abbreviation over here which is one of the important features in the VSS code so we select this option and the type attribute is set to range over here now guys for the name part we are going to set it as range in this case and for the ID as well we are going to keep the same value that is range and then over here we will set the label and we are going to set the for attribute as the range value over here now guys let's say we want the user to provide the age previously we had asked the user to provide the age inside the text field over here but now we are going to ask the user to provide the age with the help of the slider so over here we will say provide your age using slider in this case and Then followed by colon so guys basically a slider will be displayed to the user with the help of this input field with the type range in this case and by default the range value will be 0 up to 100 in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see provide your age using slider and this is the slider that the user can use in order to select one of the numbers using the slider now guys by default you cannot see the numbers over here so basically we are going to have another tag over here on the right side of the slider and we will have the output tag in this case so basically let's say after this input field we will have the output tag over here and this output tag will have the default value so let's say the default value in this case that we set is 20 over here and the same value we are going to set it as 20 in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so the slider is adjusted at the value of 20 and the same value is being displayed in the output tag over here now guys when we slide this in between the two numbers we cannot see the change in this number which is being displayed inside the output tag so what we have to do is we have to write a JavaScript code and then there is a attribute that we are going to use as you can see in order to display the value we have to use the JavaScript and this is one of the properties that we are going to use that is next element sibling so guys basically what is the meaning of this so after this input field we have the next element that is output which can be referred by using the next element sibling over here so what we have to do is inside this input field with the type range we will say on input over here so this is the attribute that we are going to use in such a way that when the user slides this particular slider over here the on input attribute will be called and inside this on input attribute we will be using the this keyword followed by Dot and then we are going to use this property that is next element sibling over here so we have next element sibling which is going to refer to this particular tag that is output in this case and then follow by Dot and then we have something called as value so basically what we are doing is we are setting the next element siblings value over here to which value so again we need to provide equal to since we need to assign certain value to this particular sibling over here after this input tag and the value will come from this input itself so basically we are going to use the this keyword followed by Dot and then we will say value so guys over here we are taking the value of the slider by using this dot value in this case and then this value will be assigned to the next element sibling which is the output tag in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser now when the user slides over here as you can see the number is also getting updated so when the user goes to the extreme right you can see that the maximum number is 100 and to the extreme left the number is set to zero over here so guys in this way we can also have the number that is being displayed to the user by using the on input attribute and Then followed by the next element sibling property followed by Dot and then the value of the slider can be set to this particular property now guys apart from this we can also restrict the values that is the Min and the max values over here so what we can do is inside the same input tag in this case we can provide main attribute over here and let's say the minimum attribute we want is 18 and the maximum attribute we want is 60 over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the value is set to 20 by default and when we take it to extreme left the value is 18 which is the minimum value and to the extreme right the maximum value is 60 over here and that is what we had set as the Min and the max value for this particular input field with the type range so guys this is the way that you can set the input field with the type range over here and also display the number to the user so that the user comes to know what is the number that is being selected by the user apart from that you can also have the step attribute as well so let's say we provide the minimum value as 1 and the maximum value as 50 over here and we provide the step as 10 so in this case the values will be incremented or decremented by 10 so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see 20 is the default value and then when we take it back it is 1 and then 11 21 31 41 and then the last value will be 50 over here which is not being taken because the step value is 10 and the maximum value should be 51 over here so when we set it to 51 let me just save this file now and try reloading this page now as you can see the maximum value that can be taken is 51 over here so guys in this way you can also set the step attribute as well for the range input field so comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is input type te for telephone number so stay
