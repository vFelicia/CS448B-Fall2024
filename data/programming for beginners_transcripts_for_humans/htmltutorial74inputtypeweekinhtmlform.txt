00:26 - it is very important for you as a
00:28 - developer to check your input field on
00:31 - the different browsers whether it is
00:33 - supported by the various versions of the
00:35 - browsers so let us check this with the
00:37 - help of example in vs code over here so
00:40 - previously we had seen the various input
00:42 - field types that is telephone and the
00:44 - time and the URL as well now we will
00:47 - have another input field so over here we
00:49 - will say input followed by colon and
00:51 - this time we will have the week type
00:54 - over here so that the user is able to
00:56 - select one of the weeks of the year so
00:59 - the type is week in this case and let's
01:01 - say we provide the name as weak over
01:03 - here and the same value we will provide
01:05 - it as the ID attribute in this case now
01:08 - before this input tag we will also have
01:10 - the label so that the user comes to know
01:13 - that a weak is supposed to be selected
01:15 - from his or her side so over here we
01:18 - will provide the value for the for
01:20 - attribute as weak in this case and Then

01:33 - then we will have BR tags over here that
01:35 - is line breaks so that the submit button
01:37 - is displayed on the next line so let me
01:39 - just save this file now and try
01:41 - reloading this page once again on the

01:51 - weeks so when we click on this calendar
01:54 - icon over here as you can see a calendar
01:56 - is being displayed and user can select
01:58 - the entire week from from a particular
02:00 - year so let's say we want to select the
02:02 - next week in this case so we can click
02:04 - on any of the dates over here so let's
02:06 - say we select this so it says week 51 of
02:09 - the Year
02:10 - 2023 and then when we click on submit
02:13 - over here as you can see the week name
02:15 - is being displayed as the parameter
02:17 - inside the URL followed by the year that
02:19 - is 2023 and Then followed by week 51
