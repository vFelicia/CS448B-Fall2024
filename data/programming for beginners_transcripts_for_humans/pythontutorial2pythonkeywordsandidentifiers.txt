00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to learn
00:03 - about python keywords and identifiers so
00:06 - guys keywords are nothing but these are
00:08 - the reserved words in Python so
00:10 - basically these are the words that we
00:12 - cannot use as the identifiers now what
00:15 - are identifiers these are nothing but
00:17 - these are the names that are given to
00:18 - variables functions classes and many
00:21 - other objects that we are going to see
00:23 - in the upcoming videos as well so guys
00:25 - for examples as you can see over here
00:26 - the examples for keywords are true and
00:29 - then we have false if condition else
00:32 - condition LF so Guys these are certain
00:34 - keywords that you must be aware if you
00:36 - have already learned some other
00:38 - programming language and if not then you
00:40 - don't have to worry but we are going to
00:42 - learn about these keywords in the
00:44 - upcoming videos as well you just need to
00:47 - know that these are certain keywords
00:49 - which cannot be used anywhere else apart
00:51 - from their own functionalities so guys
00:53 - over here in order to make it more easy
00:55 - for you I have the list of all the
00:58 - python keywords over here as you can see
01:00 - she falls none true and many other
01:02 - keywords are present that have specific
01:05 - functionality as far as Python
01:06 - programming language is concerned and
01:08 - you cannot use them apart from their own
01:11 - functionality where they are supposed to
01:12 - be used now apart from this what are the
01:15 - examples of the identifiers as you can
01:17 - see message this is a particular name
01:19 - that we have given to a string another
01:21 - example is language which can Define
01:23 - another language such as a Korean
01:26 - language or the Hindi language English
01:27 - language or Spanish or French language
01:30 - or any other language which can be
01:32 - defined using this variable we also have
01:35 - other identifiers such as number count
01:37 - so this is nothing but these are certain
01:39 - names that are given to a particular
01:41 - variable so we should not mix up between
01:43 - the keywords and identifiers whenever we
01:46 - are writing the python programs so guys
01:48 - let us check this with the help of some
01:49 - examples over here so as you can see in
01:51 - this ID we have the output of the
01:53 - previous example that we have executed
01:55 - so simply we can type CLS that is the
01:58 - command in order to clear the the
02:00 - content of the terminal over here when
02:02 - we press enter the entire terminal is
02:04 - cleared and then what we will do is as
02:06 - you can see previously we had written a
02:08 - print statement and inside this we had
02:10 - given the content that this is a
02:12 - statement what we can do is this value
02:14 - can be assigned to another variable
02:16 - which is called as the identifier so I
02:19 - will just remove this line over here and
02:22 - before this what I will do is let's say
02:24 - I provide Str SD identifier name
02:27 - followed by equal to and then in between
02:29 - the double quotes I am supposed to
02:31 - provide the string that is this is a
02:33 - statement that we had printed over here
02:35 - using the print statement and then what
02:37 - we can do is in this print inside the
02:40 - open and close parenthesis over here we
02:42 - can simply provide this Str which is the
02:44 - identifier so guys what exactly is
02:47 - happening over here is we have provided
02:49 - the content that we want to print and we
02:52 - have stored that content in a particular
02:54 - identifier so this is called a
02:55 - identifier over here that is Str which
02:58 - is nothing but a name over here which is
03:00 - given to this particular value and we
03:02 - can simply provide this name that is Str
03:04 - over here and when we save this file and
03:07 - try running this code now so as you can
03:09 - see this is a statement is getting
03:10 - printed so it doesn't matter what
03:12 - content is provided over here we can
03:14 - provide some other statement as well
03:16 - like programming for beginners which is
03:19 - the name of the YouTube channel which
03:20 - you should definitely subscribe if you
03:22 - have not subscribed it already so when
03:24 - we save this file and try running this
03:26 - code as you can see programming for
03:28 - beginners is getting printed now so it
03:30 - depends on what a value is being stored
03:32 - in this particular variable which is
03:34 - also called as identifier we can give
03:36 - any name to this identifier let's say
03:38 - instead of Str we can simply give
03:40 - statement as the name of this variable
03:43 - but we have to change it in the print
03:45 - statement as well so I'll just copy this
03:47 - statement variable and paste this over
03:49 - here so guys this is nothing but
03:50 - identifier it is also called as a
03:53 - variable since we are storing some
03:55 - particular value inside this variable I
03:57 - click on Save and when I run this code
03:59 - once again again it is printing the same
04:01 - content that is programming for
04:03 - beginners so guys this is one example of
04:05 - identifier and in similar way we can
04:07 - have any other name to the identifier
04:09 - and along with that we are supposed to
04:11 - provide the value now apart from that
04:13 - can we use the keywords as the variable
04:16 - names so let us check this so let's say
04:18 - if I provide if keyword over here so
04:21 - instead of this statement over here I
04:23 - provide if and then let's say if I print
04:26 - this if so what will happen let me just
04:28 - save this file and try running this code
04:30 - so as you can see it is providing the
04:33 - syntax error that is invalid syntax and
04:35 - we can see if equal to so over here it
04:38 - is pointing out so as I have already
04:40 - told you we cannot use keywords as the
04:43 - identifier since they have their own
04:45 - meaning as far as python programs are
04:47 - concerned so we need to avoid the
04:49 - keywords being used as the identifiers
04:51 - and we should give some other names
04:52 - apart from all these keywords that are
04:55 - being displayed over here which we are
04:56 - going to learn in the upcoming videos as
04:58 - well guys it will only come with
05:00 - practice that you will come to know that
05:02 - which are the python keywords and which
05:04 - you are not supposed to use as the
05:06 - identifiers so no need to worry you just
05:08 - stick with me till the end of this video
05:10 - series and we are going to learn a lot
05:11 - about the python programs now there are
05:13 - certain rules while naming the
05:15 - identifiers so as you can see
05:17 - identifiers cannot be a keyword which we
05:19 - have just proved by providing the if
05:22 - keyword over here and then apart from
05:24 - that identifies are case sensitive so
05:26 - Guys these are two different identifiers
05:28 - let's say I provide Str over here which
05:31 - is one identifier we can simply print
05:33 - this using the print statement over here
05:35 - and then let's say we have another
05:37 - identifier as Str so over here we can
05:40 - have a different statement so let's say
05:42 - I simply provide the string over here so
05:45 - what will happen is if I save this file
05:47 - and try running this code now it is
05:49 - saying programming for beginners but Str
05:51 - and St are both the identifiers are same
05:53 - the only difference is these characters
05:55 - are uppercase characters whereas this
05:58 - Str has lowercase connectors but when we
06:00 - provide this Str over here in the print
06:03 - statement let me just save this file
06:04 - enter running this code as you can see
06:06 - this time string is getting printed
06:08 - that's because we have saved the string
06:10 - in this particular identifier that is
06:12 - capital Str so guys this proves that
06:15 - identifiers are case sensitive and you
06:17 - have to take caution while you are
06:19 - naming your identifiers over here apart
06:21 - from that it can have a sequence of
06:23 - letters and digits as well however it
06:25 - must begin with a letter or a underscore
06:28 - the first letter of an identifier cannot
06:30 - be a digit so basically we are supposed
06:32 - to start with the letter or it can also
06:34 - be a underscore over here and then white
06:37 - spaces are not allowed and apart from
06:39 - that we cannot use special symbols like
06:42 - exclamation mark at the rate hashtag and
06:45 - dollar sign and so on so there are
06:47 - certain special characters which cannot
06:48 - be used while you are naming your
06:50 - identifiers so Guys these are certain
06:52 - rules while you're naming your
06:53 - identifiers or the variables and we are
06:55 - going to follow these rules while we are
06:57 - writing the python programs in the
06:58 - upcoming videos as well so guys that's
07:00 - it in this video please make sure that
07:02 - you practice on your own so that you
07:03 - come to know about the differences
07:05 - between the keywords and the identifiers
07:07 - please make sure that you like this
07:08 - video so that it reaches to more people
07:10 - and subscribe to this channel so that
07:12 - you get the notifications on upcoming
07:13 - videos as well the next video that we
07:15 - are going to talk about is python
07:17 - variables constants and literals so stay
07:20 - tuned
