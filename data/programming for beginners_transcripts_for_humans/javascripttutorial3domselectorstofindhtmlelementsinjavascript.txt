With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see different Dom
00:01 - selectors to find HTML elements in
00:04 - JavaScript so guys basically we have
00:06 - multiple Dom selectors over here that
00:09 - can be used in order to find the HTML
00:12 - elements and based on your choice and
00:14 - the project requirements you can use any
00:16 - of them while you are finding the HTML
00:19 - elements on the web pages now guys it is
00:21 - important to note that if you're using
00:23 - any of the selector make sure that you
00:25 - are using that selector only throughout
00:27 - the JavaScript code so that it becomes
00:30 - helpful for you and anyone else that is
00:32 - reading your code in order to maintain
00:34 - it in future so guys let us see all
00:37 - these Dom selectors one by one with the
00:39 - help of examples so let us move to vs
00:41 - code over here and simply I'm going to
00:43 - remove the previous lines of code that
00:45 - we had return in the HTML and the
00:47 - JavaScript files over here now guys what
00:50 - we will do is simply we are going to
00:52 - create the diff tag with the ID so let's
00:54 - say we have the ID as demo over here and
00:57 - then we will say diff tag with ID demo
01:01 - in this case now guys similarly we are
01:03 - going to have another diff tag but this
01:05 - time instead of having the ID we are
01:07 - going to create the class and then let's
01:09 - say we provide the value as demo class
01:12 - over here similarly we will provide the
01:14 - value as demo ID for the ID attribute
01:17 - and then also we will update the content
01:19 - over here we will say diff tag with demo
01:22 - ID and then we will say d tag with demo
01:26 - class over here so guys basically we
01:28 - have created two different D text with
01:30 - the different statements over here one
01:32 - statement is having the ID value and the
01:35 - other statement is having the class
01:36 - value over here now guys let us try to
01:39 - identify these HTML elements with the
01:42 - help of the JavaScript so what we will
01:43 - do is inside the test.js file which we
01:47 - have to link it with the HTML file over
01:49 - here so simply I'm going to provide the
01:52 - script tag in this case with the SRC
01:54 - attribute as test.js which is the
01:57 - external file in this case so guys
01:59 - inside the test.js file we can make use
02:02 - of the first method that is get element
02:04 - by ID over here so guys this method
02:07 - helps us in order to identify the HTML
02:10 - element with the value of the ID over
02:12 - here that we have provided inside our
02:15 - HTML file so let us provide document
02:18 - followed by Dot and then we have the get
02:20 - element by ID method and inside the
02:23 - parenthesis we provide the value of the
02:25 - ID so simply we provide demo ID over
02:28 - here so let me just copy this and paste
02:31 - it inside the parenthesis with the
02:32 - single code now guys let us print this
02:35 - particular HTML element so simply we
02:37 - will enclose this entire statement
02:40 - within console. log so over here we will
02:42 - provide console followed by Dot and then
02:45 - we have the log statement over here and
02:47 - then inside the open and close
02:49 - parenthesis we have this entire
02:51 - statement so guys let me just save this
02:53 - file now and try reloading this page
02:55 - once again on the browser so as you can
02:57 - see we have these two statements that is
02:59 - d tag with demo ID and diff tag with
03:02 - demo class over here but we are only
03:04 - getting the HTML element that is diff
03:07 - tag with demo ID over here that's
03:09 - because we are only trying to access the
03:11 - HTML element that is having the ID with
03:14 - the help of the get element by ID method
03:17 - over here so guys as you can see this is
03:19 - the first way in order to get the HTML
03:21 - element now guys the second way is in
03:24 - order to get the elements by using the
03:26 - class name over here now always remember
03:29 - when you using the class name the same
03:31 - class name can be present for multiple
03:33 - HTML elements and that is why we will
03:36 - get the list of all the HTML elements
03:39 - that we are going to access with the
03:41 - help of the class name over here so guys
03:43 - let us try that as well so what we have
03:45 - to do is again we will type document
03:47 - followed by Dot and this time we will
03:49 - say get Elements by class name over here
03:52 - so as you can see this is the method
03:54 - that is suggested by the vs code in this
03:57 - case and inside the parenthesis we again
03:59 - have to provide double codes or single
04:01 - codes over here and then we provide the
04:03 - value of the class that is demo class
04:05 - over here so let me just copy this value
04:07 - and paste it and then let us say we want
04:10 - to print it on the console so simply we
04:12 - provide the console. log statement and
04:14 - enclose this entire statement within the
04:17 - log statement over here so when we save
04:19 - this file now let us reload this page
04:22 - once again now so as you can see first
04:23 - of all we have got the HTML element that
04:26 - is D tag with demo ID and the second log
04:28 - statement has h helped us in order to
04:30 - get the HTML collection so guys as I
04:33 - have told you this get Elements by class
04:36 - name will return you multiple HTML
04:38 - elements based on the matches that are
04:40 - found on the HTML page with the help of
04:43 - that particular class name so guys over
04:45 - here you can see the HTML collection but
04:47 - it is only having the length of one over
04:50 - here since we have only one HTML element
04:53 - with this class that is demo class in
04:55 - this case let us have another HTML
04:57 - element over here with the same class
04:59 - that is demo class over here so we will
05:01 - say d Tag 2 in this case with class demo
05:05 - so over here we have provided with demo
05:08 - class let me just save this file now and
05:10 - try reloading this page once again
05:12 - notice that currently we have length one
05:14 - over here but when we reload this page
05:16 - once again you can see that HTML
05:18 - collection is now having two length over
05:20 - here when we expand this you can see
05:22 - length is two and we have two diff tags
05:24 - over here similarly we can also have the
05:26 - paragraph tag with the class that is
05:28 - demo class so let me just provide the P
05:31 - tag inside of the diff tag over here and
05:33 - we will say paragraph tag so as you can
05:36 - see we have paragraph tag with the demo
05:38 - class let me just save this file now and
05:40 - when we reload this page once again on
05:42 - the browser So currently we will have
05:44 - three tags with the class that is demo
05:46 - class over here the first two are the
05:48 - diff tags over here and then we have the
05:50 - third tag that is the paragraph tag and
05:52 - the length is three so guys in this way
05:54 - if you want to select multiple HTML
05:57 - elements at the same time with the help
05:59 - of of the class value you can make use
06:02 - of the get Elements by class name over
06:04 - here because apart from this we also
06:06 - have something called as get Elements by
06:08 - tag name in this case so guys basically
06:11 - we make use of these tag names that we
06:13 - have provided inside the HTML code so
06:16 - let's say we want to find out all the
06:18 - div tags over here so simply we can make
06:20 - use of the div value inside the get
06:23 - Elements by tag name so let me just
06:25 - comment out these lines of code over
06:27 - here and then simply we will say
06:30 - document. get Elements by tag name as
06:34 - you can see this is the method that we
06:35 - can use and then inside the parenthesis
06:38 - we provide the codes and then inside
06:40 - these codes we provide the name of the
06:43 - tag that is div in this case and then
06:45 - guys what will happen is over here we
06:47 - should expect all the diff tag that must
06:50 - be printed on the console so let us
06:52 - enclose this entire statement inside the
06:55 - console.log so over here we provide
06:57 - console followed by Dot and then we have
07:00 - the log keyword over here guys over here
07:02 - we have provided the log statement and
07:05 - enclosed this particular get Elements by
07:07 - tag name function inside the console.log
07:10 - so let me just save this file now and
07:12 - try reloading this page once again on
07:14 - the browser so as you can see again we
07:16 - are getting the HTML collection and it
07:18 - is having the length of three over here
07:20 - when we expand this all these are having
07:23 - the diff tags over here and irrespective
07:25 - whether we have the ID or the class name
07:28 - for those diff tags all the diff tags
07:30 - will be retrived and they can be used
07:32 - for further processing as per your
07:34 - project requirement so guys this is
07:36 - another way in order to select the HTML
07:39 - elements over here by using the get
07:41 - Elements by tag name now guys apart from
07:43 - this we also have another function that
07:45 - is query selector which is one of my
07:47 - favorite functions so guys what we can
07:50 - do is instead of making use of these get
07:52 - element by ID or the class names over
07:55 - here simply we can use the query
07:56 - selector over here so we provide the
07:59 - document keyword followed by Dot and
08:01 - then we provide the query selector in
08:03 - this case now guys how do we provide the
08:06 - ID or the class name of any of the HTML
08:09 - elements that we want to retrive so guys
08:11 - over here inside the double or single
08:13 - codes if you want to provide the ID of
08:16 - the HTML element you have to make use of
08:18 - the hash character over here so similar
08:21 - to how we use the CSS selectors in order
08:23 - to provide the CSS properties in the
08:26 - same way you can make use of the query
08:28 - selector over here so when we make use
08:30 - of the ID we provide the hash character
08:33 - and Then followed by the value of that
08:35 - ID so let me just provide the
08:37 - console.log statement in order to see
08:40 - which HTML element will be printed by
08:42 - using this particular demo ID value
08:45 - along with the hash character when we
08:47 - are using query selector over here so
08:49 - let me just save this file now and try
08:51 - reloading this page once again on the
08:53 - browser so as you can see we are getting
08:55 - the diff tag that is having the ID it is
08:58 - equal to demo ID and the statement is
09:01 - diff tag with demo ID so guys in this
09:03 - way if you have the HTML element along
09:06 - with the ID value you can make use of
09:08 - the query selector and inside this while
09:10 - providing the value you can provide the
09:13 - hash character over here now guys in the
09:15 - same statement you can provide the class
09:17 - name as well along with the dot
09:19 - character so let's say you want to
09:21 - access these HTML Elements which are
09:24 - having the class name that is demo class
09:26 - over here how many Texs do we have with
09:28 - the class that is demo class we have the
09:30 - two div tags over here and then apart
09:32 - from this we also have the paragraph tag
09:35 - so what we can do is simply make use of
09:37 - this class name that is demo class and
09:40 - then inside the Javascript file over
09:42 - here we make use of the query selector
09:44 - function over here and inside the
09:46 - parenthesis we have the double or the
09:48 - single quotes and then we provide dot
09:51 - character followed by the class name now
09:53 - guys since there are multiple HTML
09:55 - elements with this particular class name
09:57 - over here as we have seen inside the
09:59 - HTML code only the first HTML element
10:02 - will be matched over here and it will be
10:05 - returned on the console so guys let us
10:07 - check that as well so over here let me
10:09 - just save this Javascript file now and
10:11 - try reloading this page once again on
10:13 - the browser as you can see the first
10:15 - diff tag that got matched with the class
10:18 - name that is demo class is returned and
10:20 - is getting printed on the console that's
10:23 - because we have made use of the query
10:25 - selector which is capable to return only
10:28 - one HTML element M at a time so we can
10:30 - use any of the CSS selectors over here
10:33 - we have first checked the ID value with
10:35 - the help of the hash character and then
10:37 - next we have checked the class value
10:39 - with the help of the dot character over
10:41 - here now guys what if we want all the
10:43 - elements which we were able to get with
10:45 - the help of the get Elements by class
10:47 - name so can query selector help us in
10:50 - order to get all those HTML elements at
10:52 - once yes we can make use of the query
10:55 - selector all function in that case in
10:57 - order to get all the HTML elements at
11:00 - once so because basically this is the
11:02 - only difference query selector will help
11:04 - you in order to return only one HTML
11:07 - element over here as you can see but in
11:10 - order to get all the other HTML elements
11:13 - you can make use of the query selector
11:15 - all function so this is the function
11:17 - that you can make use of in order to get
11:19 - the multiple HTML elements that is
11:22 - having the class name demo class so let
11:25 - me just save this file now and try
11:27 - reloading this page once again on the
11:28 - browser so as you can see this time we
11:31 - are getting the node list over here and
11:33 - it is also providing the length that is
11:35 - three in this case when we expand this
11:38 - node list you can see that the first two
11:40 - diff tags are having the demo class over
11:42 - here and the third tag is the paragraph
11:45 - tag which is again having the demo class
11:47 - in this case so guys in this way if you
11:49 - want to get multiple HTML elements you
11:52 - can make use of the query selector all
11:54 - function over here and in case if you
11:56 - want only one HTML element that is the
11:58 - first match on the web page then you can
12:00 - make use of the query selector that we
12:02 - have already seen these two methods that
12:04 - is query selector and query selector all
12:07 - provides you the flexibility in order to
12:09 - either provide the ID or the class name
12:12 - of the HTML elements that you want to
12:14 - find on the web page so guys comment in
12:16 - the comment section below whether you

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see different Dom selectors to find HTML elements in JavaScript so guys basically we have multiple Dom selectors over here that can be used in order to find the HTML elements and based on your choice and the project requirements you can use any of them while you are finding the HTML elements on the web pages now guys it is important to note that if you're using any of the selector make sure that you are using that selector only throughout the JavaScript code so that it becomes helpful for you and anyone else that is reading your code in order to maintain it in future so guys let us see all these Dom selectors one by one with the help of examples so let us move to vs code over here and simply I'm going to remove the previous lines of code that we had return in the HTML and the JavaScript files over here now guys what we will do is simply we are going to create the diff tag with the ID so let's say we have the ID as demo over here and then we will say diff tag with ID demo in this case now guys similarly we are going to have another diff tag but this time instead of having the ID we are going to create the class and then let's say we provide the value as demo class over here similarly we will provide the value as demo ID for the ID attribute and then also we will update the content over here we will say diff tag with demo ID and then we will say d tag with demo class over here so guys basically we have created two different D text with the different statements over here one statement is having the ID value and the other statement is having the class value over here now guys let us try to identify these HTML elements with the help of the JavaScript so what we will do is inside the test.js file which we have to link it with the HTML file over here so simply I'm going to provide the script tag in this case with the SRC attribute as test.js which is the external file in this case so guys inside the test.js file we can make use of the first method that is get element by ID over here so guys this method helps us in order to identify the HTML element with the value of the ID over here that we have provided inside our HTML file so let us provide document followed by Dot and then we have the get element by ID method and inside the parenthesis we provide the value of the ID so simply we provide demo ID over here so let me just copy this and paste it inside the parenthesis with the single code now guys let us print this particular HTML element so simply we will enclose this entire statement within console. log so over here we will provide console followed by Dot and then we have the log statement over here and then inside the open and close parenthesis we have this entire statement so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have these two statements that is d tag with demo ID and diff tag with demo class over here but we are only getting the HTML element that is diff tag with demo ID over here that's because we are only trying to access the HTML element that is having the ID with the help of the get element by ID method over here so guys as you can see this is the first way in order to get the HTML element now guys the second way is in order to get the elements by using the class name over here now always remember when you using the class name the same class name can be present for multiple HTML elements and that is why we will get the list of all the HTML elements that we are going to access with the help of the class name over here so guys let us try that as well so what we have to do is again we will type document followed by Dot and this time we will say get Elements by class name over here so as you can see this is the method that is suggested by the vs code in this case and inside the parenthesis we again have to provide double codes or single codes over here and then we provide the value of the class that is demo class over here so let me just copy this value and paste it and then let us say we want to print it on the console so simply we provide the console. log statement and enclose this entire statement within the log statement over here so when we save this file now let us reload this page once again now so as you can see first of all we have got the HTML element that is D tag with demo ID and the second log statement has h helped us in order to get the HTML collection so guys as I have told you this get Elements by class name will return you multiple HTML elements based on the matches that are found on the HTML page with the help of that particular class name so guys over here you can see the HTML collection but it is only having the length of one over here since we have only one HTML element with this class that is demo class in this case let us have another HTML element over here with the same class that is demo class over here so we will say d Tag 2 in this case with class demo so over here we have provided with demo class let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again notice that currently we have length one over here but when we reload this page once again you can see that HTML collection is now having two length over here when we expand this you can see length is two and we have two diff tags over here similarly we can also have the paragraph tag with the class that is demo class so let me just provide the P tag inside of the diff tag over here and we will say paragraph tag so as you can see we have paragraph tag with the demo class let me just save this file now and when we reload this page once again on the browser So currently we will have three tags with the class that is demo class over here the first two are the diff tags over here and then we have the third tag that is the paragraph tag and the length is three so guys in this way if you want to select multiple HTML elements at the same time with the help of of the class value you can make use of the get Elements by class name over here because apart from this we also have something called as get Elements by tag name in this case so guys basically we make use of these tag names that we have provided inside the HTML code so let's say we want to find out all the div tags over here so simply we can make use of the div value inside the get Elements by tag name so let me just comment out these lines of code over here and then simply we will say document. get Elements by tag name as you can see this is the method that we can use and then inside the parenthesis we provide the codes and then inside these codes we provide the name of the tag that is div in this case and then guys what will happen is over here we should expect all the diff tag that must be printed on the console so let us enclose this entire statement inside the console.log so over here we provide console followed by Dot and then we have the log keyword over here guys over here we have provided the log statement and enclosed this particular get Elements by tag name function inside the console.log so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see again we are getting the HTML collection and it is having the length of three over here when we expand this all these are having the diff tags over here and irrespective whether we have the ID or the class name for those diff tags all the diff tags will be retrived and they can be used for further processing as per your project requirement so guys this is another way in order to select the HTML elements over here by using the get Elements by tag name now guys apart from this we also have another function that is query selector which is one of my favorite functions so guys what we can do is instead of making use of these get element by ID or the class names over here simply we can use the query selector over here so we provide the document keyword followed by Dot and then we provide the query selector in this case now guys how do we provide the ID or the class name of any of the HTML elements that we want to retrive so guys over here inside the double or single codes if you want to provide the ID of the HTML element you have to make use of the hash character over here so similar to how we use the CSS selectors in order to provide the CSS properties in the same way you can make use of the query selector over here so when we make use of the ID we provide the hash character and Then followed by the value of that ID so let me just provide the console.log statement in order to see which HTML element will be printed by using this particular demo ID value along with the hash character when we are using query selector over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we are getting the diff tag that is having the ID it is equal to demo ID and the statement is diff tag with demo ID so guys in this way if you have the HTML element along with the ID value you can make use of the query selector and inside this while providing the value you can provide the hash character over here now guys in the same statement you can provide the class name as well along with the dot character so let's say you want to access these HTML Elements which are having the class name that is demo class over here how many Texs do we have with the class that is demo class we have the two div tags over here and then apart from this we also have the paragraph tag so what we can do is simply make use of this class name that is demo class and then inside the Javascript file over here we make use of the query selector function over here and inside the parenthesis we have the double or the single quotes and then we provide dot character followed by the class name now guys since there are multiple HTML elements with this particular class name over here as we have seen inside the HTML code only the first HTML element will be matched over here and it will be returned on the console so guys let us check that as well so over here let me just save this Javascript file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see the first diff tag that got matched with the class name that is demo class is returned and is getting printed on the console that's because we have made use of the query selector which is capable to return only one HTML element M at a time so we can use any of the CSS selectors over here we have first checked the ID value with the help of the hash character and then next we have checked the class value with the help of the dot character over here now guys what if we want all the elements which we were able to get with the help of the get Elements by class name so can query selector help us in order to get all those HTML elements at once yes we can make use of the query selector all function in that case in order to get all the HTML elements at once so because basically this is the only difference query selector will help you in order to return only one HTML element over here as you can see but in order to get all the other HTML elements you can make use of the query selector all function so this is the function that you can make use of in order to get the multiple HTML elements that is having the class name demo class so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this time we are getting the node list over here and it is also providing the length that is three in this case when we expand this node list you can see that the first two diff tags are having the demo class over here and the third tag is the paragraph tag which is again having the demo class in this case so guys in this way if you want to get multiple HTML elements you can make use of the query selector all function over here and in case if you want only one HTML element that is the first match on the web page then you can make use of the query selector that we have already seen these two methods that is query selector and query selector all provides you the flexibility in order to either provide the ID or the class name of the HTML elements that you want to find on the web page so guys comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to the channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is output in JavaScript so stay tuned
