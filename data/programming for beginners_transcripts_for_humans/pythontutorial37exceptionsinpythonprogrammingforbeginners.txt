00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to learn
00:03 - about exceptions in Python Programming
00:06 - so guys an exception is an unexpected
00:08 - event that occurs during the program
00:10 - execution so let's say for example if we
00:14 - have this divided by zero variable and
00:16 - then we do the assignment in such a way
00:18 - that we divide this number that is 5 by
00:21 - 0 then we get divide by zero exception
00:24 - that's because this is a runtime
00:25 - exception and we cannot divide any
00:28 - number by zero so the above code causes
00:30 - an exception as it is not possible to
00:33 - divide a number by zero errors that
00:35 - occur at runtime after passing the
00:38 - syntax test are called exceptions or
00:40 - logical errors so guys basically there
00:42 - will be many exceptions that you will
00:44 - come across when you are going to write
00:46 - python programs and these exceptions are
00:48 - going to be the runtime exceptions after
00:51 - passing the syntax test that we have
00:53 - already seen in our vs code editor so
00:55 - basically these exceptions occur when we
00:58 - try to open a file for reading that does
01:01 - not exist that is file not found error
01:03 - so basically this is one of the
01:05 - exceptions in the Python programming
01:07 - language in which case if let's say you
01:09 - are trying to open a file which is not
01:11 - present in the directory then we will
01:13 - have file not found error over here then
01:16 - if we try to divide a number by 0 then
01:18 - we will get 0 division error and then
01:20 - again if we try to import a module that
01:23 - does not access then we are going to get
01:25 - the import error and so on so basically
01:28 - there are many built-in exceptions that
01:30 - we can see by using this print statement
01:32 - inside the directory we have this locals
01:35 - and then we specify this built-ins in
01:37 - order to get the list of exceptions that
01:39 - is already built in in the Python
01:41 - programming language so this we are
01:42 - going to check with the help of example
01:44 - as well what we are going to do is we
01:46 - are going to see how the exception
01:48 - occurs in the Python program so over
01:50 - here let's say we have the variable that
01:52 - is number over here and we have the
01:54 - number that is 5 divided by zero so in
01:57 - this case we are dividing a number by
01:59 - zero since practically this is correct
02:01 - over here vs code will not throw any
02:03 - error but during the runtime we will get
02:06 - the error which we call it as the
02:07 - exception so over here when we print
02:10 - this number so we say value of number is
02:15 - followed by colon and then let's say we
02:18 - provide this number variable so let me
02:20 - just save this file now and try running
02:22 - this code so as you can see we are
02:24 - getting the 0 division error division by
02:27 - 0 which is not possible we cannot divide
02:29 - any number by zero now let me show you
02:32 - another exception let's say we are going
02:34 - to open a file in this particular
02:36 - directory and the file name is test1
02:38 - which doesn't occur inside this
02:40 - directory so let me just copy this
02:42 - directory path and we will open that
02:45 - file which is test one which is not
02:46 - present so over here we provide the
02:48 - variable name as file 1 it is equal to
02:51 - we say open and then with this we have
02:54 - the parameter that is the directory path
02:56 - we have just copied over here we will
02:58 - just Escape these back backslash
03:00 - characters so that we don't get any
03:02 - error over here for the backslashes and
03:05 - then at the end what we are going to do
03:07 - is after this we are going to provide
03:09 - test one dot txt now this file name as I
03:13 - have showed you over here it is not
03:14 - present test one is not present over
03:16 - here so we are trying to open that by
03:19 - using this test1.txt file name so now
03:22 - what we will do is simply we will save
03:24 - this file enter running this code now so
03:26 - as you can see file not found error is
03:29 - being displayed no such file or
03:31 - directory and then this file name is
03:33 - being mentioned over here what if we
03:34 - provide the correct file name let's say
03:36 - I provide this test file as the name of
03:38 - the file so I'll just copy this file
03:40 - name and paste this over here at the end
03:43 - instead of test one so I'll just paste
03:45 - this over here and then let me just save
03:46 - this file now and try running this code
03:48 - so now as you can see nothing happens we
03:50 - are not printing anything but there is
03:52 - no exception that is being printed over
03:54 - here on the terminal that's because this
03:57 - particular file name is actually present
03:59 - and hence there is is no file not found
04:01 - error that is being displayed over here
04:03 - like how we have seen previously with
04:05 - the test1 dot txt file so Guys these are
04:08 - certain exceptions that might occur when
04:10 - you are going to work with the python
04:11 - projects and such exceptions are
04:13 - inevitable we cannot avoid them but we
04:16 - can handle them so we are going to see
04:18 - exception handling in the upcoming
04:20 - videos as well how we are going to
04:22 - handle them but it is very important for
04:24 - you to know that these exceptions might
04:26 - occur when you are going to work with
04:28 - the Python programming language now guys
04:30 - let us see the list of all the built-in
04:32 - exceptions that are present inside the
04:33 - Python programming language so I'll just
04:35 - copy this line of code and then we'll
04:37 - paste this over here so as you can see
04:39 - this is a print statement and inside
04:41 - this we have the dir function and inside
04:44 - that we also have the locals function
04:46 - and then we provide the built-ins
04:48 - attribute over here so let me just save
04:50 - this file now and try running this code
04:52 - as you can see we have got the list of
04:54 - all the exceptions that are present
04:56 - inside the Python programming language
04:58 - so there are multiple errors that might
05:00 - occur which includes arithmetic error
05:02 - then we have assertion error attribute
05:04 - error base exception so there are many
05:07 - errors that you can see over here file
05:09 - not found error this is one of the
05:10 - exceptions that we have just checked and
05:13 - then we also have the zero division
05:14 - error which we just saw when we divide
05:17 - any number by zero so guys there are
05:19 - multiple exceptions that might occur
05:20 - which are already built in inside the
05:22 - Python programming language and you can
05:24 - practice on your own to see which
05:26 - exception occurs on which particular
05:28 - input please make sure that you like
05:30 - this video so that it reaches to more
05:32 - people and subscribe to this channel so
05:34 - that you get the notifications on
05:35 - upcoming videos as well the next video
05:37 - that we are going to talk about is
05:39 - exception handling with try accept block
05:41 - so stay tuned
