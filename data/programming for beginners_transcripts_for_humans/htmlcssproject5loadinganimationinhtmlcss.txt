With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we are going to create a simple
00:01 - loading animation that will look like
00:04 - this as you can see this is a circular
00:06 - loading animation and we can display
00:08 - this loading animation with the help of
00:10 - just HTML and CSS whenever you are
00:13 - retriving data to be displayed to the
00:15 - user so guys let us move to the vs code
00:17 - so guys over here inside the HTML CSS
00:20 - projects folder we are going to create
00:22 - new folder over here and we will say
00:24 - loading animation in this case and
00:27 - inside this folder we are going to
00:29 - create couple of over here so the first
00:31 - file will be index.html file and the
00:34 - other file will be representing the CSS
00:37 - file that is style. CSS file so guys
00:40 - basically we are going to make use of
00:42 - this external CSS file over here so
00:44 - inside our HTML file in this case we are
00:47 - going to make use of this particular Mt
00:49 - abbreviation that is exclamation mark in
00:51 - this case that will help us in order to
00:54 - create this particular HTML template in
00:56 - order to create the web page so guys
00:58 - over here for the title tag we are going
01:01 - to provide the string that is loading
01:03 - animation over here and also we are
01:05 - going to link this external style. CSS
01:09 - file over here with the help of the link
01:11 - tag inside the HTML file so guys after
01:14 - this inside the body tag what we are
01:16 - going to do is simply we are going to
01:18 - create a diff tag with the class that is
01:21 - loading over here so guys basically this
01:23 - diff tag will help us in order to create
01:25 - the loading animation on the web page so
01:28 - let us provide certain CSS prop
01:29 - properties to this diff tag over here we
01:32 - are going to make use of this class name
01:34 - that is loading and inside the style.
01:36 - CSS file we will provide the dot
01:38 - character followed by the name of this
01:40 - class now guys what we will do is simply
01:43 - we are going to provide a fixed width
01:45 - and height for this particular diff tag
01:47 - so let's say we have 200 pixels of width
01:50 - and 200 pixels of height over here so
01:52 - basically it is a square box initially
01:55 - and apart from this we are also going to
01:57 - provide the background color so let's
01:59 - say we provide the gray color as the
02:01 - background color and then guys for the
02:03 - body part as well we are going to
02:05 - provide certain dark color as the
02:07 - background color so you make use of this
02:10 - body tag and inside the curly braces we
02:12 - will provide the background color and
02:14 - let's say we provide the black color is
02:16 - the background color over here let me
02:18 - just save this file now and let us make
02:20 - use of this live server so simply we
02:22 - have to click on this go live in this
02:24 - case so guys as you can see we have the
02:26 - black color is the background color over
02:28 - here and we have created cre the diff
02:30 - tag successfully that is in the form of
02:32 - a square box in this case let us get the
02:35 - square box at the center of the page
02:37 - over here so what we will do is inside
02:39 - the style. CSS file for the loading
02:42 - class simply we are going to provide the
02:44 - margin it is equal to Auto and then
02:47 - apart from this from Top as well we are
02:49 - going to create certain margin so let us
02:52 - provide the 20 pixels of margin from Top
02:55 - let me just save this file now and if
02:56 - you see on the web page right now the
02:59 - diff tag is at the center of the screen
03:01 - over here now since we want a loading
03:04 - animation out of this diff tag first of
03:06 - all we will have to convert the square
03:08 - box to a circle so what we will do is
03:11 - simply we can make use of the Border
03:13 - radius CSS property and when we provide
03:16 - the Border radius as 50% the square
03:19 - shape will be converted to Circular
03:21 - shape over here so let me just save this
03:23 - file now and as you can see on the web
03:25 - page there is a circle that is getting
03:27 - created over here now guys instead of us
03:29 - using the background color that is
03:31 - coloring the circle as a gray color we
03:34 - will make use of the Border color over
03:36 - here so let me just comment out this
03:38 - background color in this case and simply
03:41 - we will provide the border of let's say
03:43 - 20 pixels and the Border type will be
03:45 - solid in this case and the same color
03:48 - that is gray color we are going to
03:49 - provide for this particular border when
03:51 - we save this file now so as you can see
03:53 - we have created a circular shape diff
03:56 - tag over here now guys on one side we
03:58 - want the B border color to be white
04:01 - color so let's say on the top side we
04:02 - want the Border color to be white color
04:05 - so that we can see the loading icon out
04:07 - of this diff tag so what we have to do
04:09 - is we need to separate out these values
04:12 - that we have provided inside the Border
04:14 - CSS property so I'm going to comment out
04:17 - this line of code and we are going to
04:19 - separate it in such a way that we have
04:21 - to provide all these values separately
04:24 - so first of all we will provide the
04:26 - Border width over here of same value
04:28 - that is 20 pixel and then the Border
04:30 - style must be solid in this case so we
04:33 - provide border style CSS property and it
04:36 - is of the type solid and the Border
04:38 - color must be gray so simply we make use
04:40 - of this border color CSS property now
04:43 - guys when we provide the value for this
04:45 - border color the first color will
04:46 - represent the top color over here
04:48 - followed by the right color and then we
04:51 - have the bottom color and then we have
04:53 - the left color in this case so the first
04:55 - color that we want to provide is white
04:57 - color that will be provided at the top
04:59 - top side of the border for this
05:01 - particular circular shape diff tag and
05:04 - then after this on the right hand side
05:06 - we want the gray color and then on the
05:08 - bottom side we again want the gray color
05:10 - and on the left side as well we want the
05:12 - gray color over here so guys basically
05:14 - only the top side must be white in this
05:17 - case so that we can see the loading icon
05:19 - so when we save this file now as you can
05:22 - see there's a border color of white
05:24 - color at the top of this particular
05:26 - circle now guys simply in order to make
05:28 - this circle look like like a loading
05:30 - animation we need to rotate it by 360°
05:34 - and we have to continue the rotation so
05:36 - what we can do is we can make use of the
05:38 - key frames over here which is very
05:41 - important when you make any of the
05:43 - animations inside the CSS so guys we
05:45 - make use of at theate character followed
05:48 - by key frames keyword over here and then
05:51 - followed by the space character and then
05:52 - simply let us give the name to this
05:54 - animation that is loading over here and
05:56 - then after this we need to provide the
05:58 - curly presses now because we need to
06:00 - define the different stages of the
06:02 - loading so let's say at the 0% which is
06:04 - at the start of the loading we don't
06:07 - want any rotation so simply we can
06:09 - provide the transform CSS property and
06:11 - inside this we are going to make use of
06:14 - this rotate function which is going to
06:16 - have the value as 0° over here so at 0%
06:20 - we don't want any rotation now similarly
06:23 - at 100% that is at the end of the
06:25 - animation we want the rotation to be
06:28 - 360° which means means this particular
06:30 - Circle should start from the 0° and then
06:33 - at the end of the animation it should be
06:35 - completely rotated by 360° over here so
06:39 - for 100% in this case we need to provide
06:41 - transform CSS property once again and
06:44 - then we need to make use of the rotate
06:46 - function and simply we provide the value
06:48 - that is 360° over here so guys in this
06:51 - way from 0% to 100% we have provided the
06:54 - different animations you can also
06:56 - provide the animations to the
06:58 - intermediate percentage that is 10% 25%
07:02 - or 50% and so on based on your animation
07:05 - requirements so guys in this case
07:07 - currently we only want to rotate this
07:09 - particular icon and that is why we have
07:11 - provided the transform CSS property with
07:14 - the help of the rotate function over
07:16 - here let me just save this file now and
07:19 - you will not see any changes right now
07:21 - on this web page that's because we have
07:23 - to link this particular key frames that
07:25 - is loading with this particular diff tag
07:27 - that is having the class name that is
07:29 - loading loading over here so what we can
07:31 - do is inside this loading class we can
07:34 - make use of the animation name CSS
07:36 - property and in this case we need to
07:38 - make use of this name that is loading
07:40 - over here and then after this we also
07:42 - have to provide the animation duration
07:44 - so let's say we want the duration to be
07:46 - 2 seconds so within 2 seconds the icon
07:50 - will rotate itself from 0° to 360° over
07:54 - here and then after this we want to
07:56 - rotate it infinite number of times so
07:59 - basic basically we make use of this
08:01 - animation iteration count over here and
08:03 - we provide the value that is infinite in
08:05 - this case let me just save this file now
08:08 - and if you see the web page as you can
08:10 - see in 2 seconds the icon is getting
08:12 - rotated over here and in this way we can
08:15 - easily create the loading animation now
08:17 - guys you can see that the speed is
08:19 - decreasing at the end of the animation
08:21 - so simply we can make use of another CSS
08:23 - property that is animation timing
08:25 - function in order to keep the speed
08:28 - linear over here so so simply we provide
08:30 - the value that is linear in this case
08:32 - that will keep the speed of the loading
08:34 - animation same throughout the animation
08:36 - so when we save this file now you will
08:38 - see that the speed is linear right now
08:41 - and there is no decrease or increase in
08:43 - the speed as far as the loading
08:45 - animation is concerned so guys based on
08:47 - your requirements you can have the
08:49 - different color for this particular
08:50 - loading animation that will match along
08:52 - with the background color of this
08:54 - particular web page and then based on
08:56 - the JavaScript code once your data is
08:59 - successful fully retrived from the
09:01 - database or from the internet you can
09:03 - hide this particular loading animation
09:05 - it becomes very important in order to
09:07 - keep your users engaged with the help of
09:10 - such animations on the web page whenever
09:12 - you are retriving data with the help of
09:14 - JavaScript so guys this is one of the
09:16 - ways in order to create the loading
09:18 - animation on your web page with the help
09:21 - of the HTML and the CSS comment in the
09:23 - comment section below whether you have

Cleaned transcript:

so now we are going to create a simple loading animation that will look like this as you can see this is a circular loading animation and we can display this loading animation with the help of just HTML and CSS whenever you are retriving data to be displayed to the user so guys let us move to the vs code so guys over here inside the HTML CSS projects folder we are going to create new folder over here and we will say loading animation in this case and inside this folder we are going to create couple of over here so the first file will be index.html file and the other file will be representing the CSS file that is style. CSS file so guys basically we are going to make use of this external CSS file over here so inside our HTML file in this case we are going to make use of this particular Mt abbreviation that is exclamation mark in this case that will help us in order to create this particular HTML template in order to create the web page so guys over here for the title tag we are going to provide the string that is loading animation over here and also we are going to link this external style. CSS file over here with the help of the link tag inside the HTML file so guys after this inside the body tag what we are going to do is simply we are going to create a diff tag with the class that is loading over here so guys basically this diff tag will help us in order to create the loading animation on the web page so let us provide certain CSS prop properties to this diff tag over here we are going to make use of this class name that is loading and inside the style. CSS file we will provide the dot character followed by the name of this class now guys what we will do is simply we are going to provide a fixed width and height for this particular diff tag so let's say we have 200 pixels of width and 200 pixels of height over here so basically it is a square box initially and apart from this we are also going to provide the background color so let's say we provide the gray color as the background color and then guys for the body part as well we are going to provide certain dark color as the background color so you make use of this body tag and inside the curly braces we will provide the background color and let's say we provide the black color is the background color over here let me just save this file now and let us make use of this live server so simply we have to click on this go live in this case so guys as you can see we have the black color is the background color over here and we have created cre the diff tag successfully that is in the form of a square box in this case let us get the square box at the center of the page over here so what we will do is inside the style. CSS file for the loading class simply we are going to provide the margin it is equal to Auto and then apart from this from Top as well we are going to create certain margin so let us provide the 20 pixels of margin from Top let me just save this file now and if you see on the web page right now the diff tag is at the center of the screen over here now since we want a loading animation out of this diff tag first of all we will have to convert the square box to a circle so what we will do is simply we can make use of the Border radius CSS property and when we provide the Border radius as 50% the square shape will be converted to Circular shape over here so let me just save this file now and as you can see on the web page there is a circle that is getting created over here now guys instead of us using the background color that is coloring the circle as a gray color we will make use of the Border color over here so let me just comment out this background color in this case and simply we will provide the border of let's say 20 pixels and the Border type will be solid in this case and the same color that is gray color we are going to provide for this particular border when we save this file now so as you can see we have created a circular shape diff tag over here now guys on one side we want the B border color to be white color so let's say on the top side we want the Border color to be white color so that we can see the loading icon out of this diff tag so what we have to do is we need to separate out these values that we have provided inside the Border CSS property so I'm going to comment out this line of code and we are going to separate it in such a way that we have to provide all these values separately so first of all we will provide the Border width over here of same value that is 20 pixel and then the Border style must be solid in this case so we provide border style CSS property and it is of the type solid and the Border color must be gray so simply we make use of this border color CSS property now guys when we provide the value for this border color the first color will represent the top color over here followed by the right color and then we have the bottom color and then we have the left color in this case so the first color that we want to provide is white color that will be provided at the top top side of the border for this particular circular shape diff tag and then after this on the right hand side we want the gray color and then on the bottom side we again want the gray color and on the left side as well we want the gray color over here so guys basically only the top side must be white in this case so that we can see the loading icon so when we save this file now as you can see there's a border color of white color at the top of this particular circle now guys simply in order to make this circle look like like a loading animation we need to rotate it by 360° and we have to continue the rotation so what we can do is we can make use of the key frames over here which is very important when you make any of the animations inside the CSS so guys we make use of at theate character followed by key frames keyword over here and then followed by the space character and then simply let us give the name to this animation that is loading over here and then after this we need to provide the curly presses now because we need to define the different stages of the loading so let's say at the 0% which is at the start of the loading we don't want any rotation so simply we can provide the transform CSS property and inside this we are going to make use of this rotate function which is going to have the value as 0° over here so at 0% we don't want any rotation now similarly at 100% that is at the end of the animation we want the rotation to be 360° which means means this particular Circle should start from the 0° and then at the end of the animation it should be completely rotated by 360° over here so for 100% in this case we need to provide transform CSS property once again and then we need to make use of the rotate function and simply we provide the value that is 360° over here so guys in this way from 0% to 100% we have provided the different animations you can also provide the animations to the intermediate percentage that is 10% 25% or 50% and so on based on your animation requirements so guys in this case currently we only want to rotate this particular icon and that is why we have provided the transform CSS property with the help of the rotate function over here let me just save this file now and you will not see any changes right now on this web page that's because we have to link this particular key frames that is loading with this particular diff tag that is having the class name that is loading loading over here so what we can do is inside this loading class we can make use of the animation name CSS property and in this case we need to make use of this name that is loading over here and then after this we also have to provide the animation duration so let's say we want the duration to be 2 seconds so within 2 seconds the icon will rotate itself from 0° to 360° over here and then after this we want to rotate it infinite number of times so basic basically we make use of this animation iteration count over here and we provide the value that is infinite in this case let me just save this file now and if you see the web page as you can see in 2 seconds the icon is getting rotated over here and in this way we can easily create the loading animation now guys you can see that the speed is decreasing at the end of the animation so simply we can make use of another CSS property that is animation timing function in order to keep the speed linear over here so so simply we provide the value that is linear in this case that will keep the speed of the loading animation same throughout the animation so when we save this file now you will see that the speed is linear right now and there is no decrease or increase in the speed as far as the loading animation is concerned so guys based on your requirements you can have the different color for this particular loading animation that will match along with the background color of this particular web page and then based on the JavaScript code once your data is successful fully retrived from the database or from the internet you can hide this particular loading animation it becomes very important in order to keep your users engaged with the help of such animations on the web page whenever you are retriving data with the help of JavaScript so guys this is one of the ways in order to create the loading animation on your web page with the help of the HTML and the CSS comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the
