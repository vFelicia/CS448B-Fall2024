00:00 - so now we will see horizontal navigation
00:02 - bar in CSS so guys basically navigation
00:05 - bar is a list of links which we are
00:08 - going to check with the help of examples
00:09 - as well and by using those list of links
00:12 - we are going to create a horizontal
00:15 - navigation bar so guys horizontal
00:17 - navigation bar can be created by using
00:19 - the display equal to inline property on
00:22 - the list of items so guys let us check
00:24 - this with the help of examples in vs
00:26 - code over here and previously we had
00:28 - seen how we can create the vertical
00:30 - navigation bar over here so guys
00:32 - similarly we are going to create a
00:34 - horizontal navigation bar in this case
00:36 - so what we are going to do is simply I'm
00:38 - going to remove the previous lines of
00:40 - code that we had written in the HTML and
00:43 - the CSS files over here now simply we
00:45 - are going to have the unordered list in
00:48 - this case inside which we are going to
00:50 - have the four list items so basically we
00:52 - are going to define the Four list items
00:55 - over here and then inside these list
00:57 - items we are going to have the anchor
00:59 - tags over here and they are going to
01:01 - have the hrf attribute with the hash
01:04 - character over here for test purpose now
01:06 - guys let us Define the text inside these
01:08 - anchor tags over here so let's say we
01:10 - have home and then we have blog and then
01:13 - let's say we have photos and then we
01:16 - have videos over here so these are the
01:18 - four list items that should be present
01:21 - inside the horizontal navigation bar
01:24 - guys over here we are going to go step
01:26 - by step in order to create a complete
01:28 - horizontal navig ation bar with the help
01:31 - of these unordered list items over here
01:34 - so guys let me just save this file now
01:35 - and try reloading this page on the
01:37 - browser so as you can see we have this
01:39 - unordered list which is present in the
01:42 - form of a vertical list over here so
01:44 - guys now first of all we are going to
01:46 - remove these bullets from the unordered
01:48 - list and also remove the padding and the
01:50 - margin that is present by default inside
01:53 - this horizontal list so guys inside the
01:55 - style. CSS file over here simply we are
01:58 - going to define the UL that is the
02:00 - unordered list tag and then we are going
02:02 - to say list style type so guys basically
02:05 - this is the CSS property that is used in
02:08 - order to Define what kind of bullet
02:10 - points we want to display as far as the
02:13 - unordered list is concerned so by
02:15 - default it is the circle that is getting
02:17 - displayed over here we can display them
02:19 - as Square as well so when we save this
02:21 - file now and try reloading this page
02:23 - once again on the browser so as you can
02:25 - see these are the square bullets over
02:26 - here but guys since we are creating the
02:29 - horizontal nav navigation bar we don't
02:31 - want any bullets over here so simply we
02:33 - are going to provide none s the list
02:35 - style type so let me just save this file
02:37 - now and try reloading this page once
02:39 - again on the browser so as you can see
02:41 - we no longer have any of the bullets
02:44 - over here now guys simply we are going
02:45 - to remove the padding and margin as well
02:47 - from these unordered list so we are
02:50 - going to say padding is equal to zero
02:52 - and also the margin attribute as zero
02:55 - over here so let me just save this file
02:57 - now and try reloading this page so as
02:59 - you can see see there is no longer
03:01 - padding and margin that is present by
03:03 - default inside this unordered list now
03:05 - guys what we are going to do is we will
03:06 - be removing the underlines from all
03:09 - these anchor tags over here so simply
03:11 - inside the LI that is the list item we
03:14 - have the anchor tags over here and then
03:16 - we are going to say text decoration it
03:18 - should be equal to none and also we are
03:21 - going to set the color as white in this
03:23 - case so guys basically we are going to
03:25 - set the text color as white and the
03:27 - background color of this unordered l as
03:30 - black so guys basically we are going to
03:32 - say background color as black in this
03:34 - case so guys when we are going to set
03:36 - the background color of this entire
03:38 - unordered list as black so the
03:40 - background color of the navigation bar
03:43 - will be updated to black color and the
03:45 - text color of the anchor text over here
03:48 - will be updated to white color and that
03:50 - is how we are going to make a perfect
03:52 - navigation bar so guys let me just save
03:54 - this file now and try reloading this
03:56 - page once again on the browser so as you
03:58 - can see we have the black background
04:00 - color over here and the text color of
04:02 - all these links is being updated to
04:04 - white color now now guys one more
04:06 - important thing we are going to have all
04:08 - these text in one line over here so what
04:10 - we can do is simply these list items
04:13 - that we have created we need to display
04:15 - them as inline since they are being
04:17 - displayed as the Block Level elements
04:19 - over here right now so simply we are
04:21 - going to define the lii that are the
04:23 - list items and we are going to say
04:25 - display is equal to inline in this case
04:28 - so that all the list items are displayed
04:30 - in one line so guys let me just save
04:32 - this file now and try reloading this
04:34 - page once again on the browser so as you
04:36 - can see all the list items are now
04:38 - getting displayed on the same line now
04:40 - guys apart from this let us provide
04:41 - certain spacing in between these list
04:44 - items as well so what we are going to do
04:46 - is simply we are going to set the
04:48 - padding as 10 pixels over here so guys
04:50 - let me just save this file now and try
04:52 - reloading this page once again on the
04:54 - browser so as you can see we have
04:55 - provided certain spacing around the list
04:58 - items over here now guys apart from this
05:00 - we also want the top and bottom padding
05:02 - as well so let's say we provide the top
05:04 - and bottom padding inside the unordered
05:07 - list in this case so simply we are going
05:09 - to say padding as 10 pixels for top and
05:12 - bottom and for the left and right we are
05:14 - going to say it as zero pixels over here
05:16 - so guys this is the way that we provide
05:18 - the top and bottom padding for any of
05:20 - the HTML elements and the next number
05:23 - will be representing the left and the
05:25 - right padding over here so guys let me
05:26 - just save this file now and try
05:28 - reloading this page once once again on
05:30 - the browser so as you can see we have
05:31 - provided the top and bottom padding as
05:34 - well with the help of the padding CSS
05:36 - property so guys the horizontal
05:38 - navigation bar is almost complete over
05:40 - here but the user should get at least
05:42 - some kind of confirmation that he or she
05:45 - will be clicking on one of these links
05:47 - so guys what we are going to do is when
05:49 - we get the mouse cursor on this
05:51 - particular list item over here so the
05:53 - list item background color should be
05:55 - updated to some color so that the user
05:58 - gets the confirmation or the feedback
06:00 - that he or she will be clicking on these
06:02 - list items which is the part of the
06:04 - navigation bar so guys what we are going
06:06 - to do is simply on the hover of the LI
06:09 - item over here so we Define the LI item
06:12 - followed by colon and then we use the
06:14 - sudo class that is hover in this case so
06:16 - when we get the cursor on the list item
06:19 - we want to change the background color
06:21 - to red color over here so simply we are
06:23 - going to say the background color CSS
06:25 - property and then we are going to set
06:28 - the value as red color over here so guys
06:30 - let me just save this file now and try
06:32 - reloading this page once again on the
06:34 - browser so now if you see we are getting
06:36 - the background color as red color over
06:38 - here and user is at least getting the
06:40 - feedback that he or she will be clicking
06:42 - on that particular link which is getting
06:44 - highlighted as red color over here so
06:46 - guys in this way we have created a very
06:48 - simple horizontal navigation bar that
06:51 - you will be seeing in many of the
06:53 - websites so guys this is one of the
06:54 - important ways in order to create the
06:57 - horizontal navigation bar by using the
06:59 - unordered list items over here and using
07:02 - some of the CSS properties that we have
07:04 - defined over here now because apart from
07:06 - this if you notice there is certain
07:08 - spacing on the left and on the top of
07:10 - this navigation bar so how we can get
07:12 - rid of that so basically it is the
07:14 - padding and the margin of the body tag
07:16 - over here so guys the body tag is
07:19 - representing the entire page that is the
07:21 - web page on this particular web browser
07:24 - so inside the body tag over here simply
07:27 - we are going to set the margin as zero
07:29 - and also the padding is zero over here
07:32 - so guys this is one of the best
07:33 - practices that the programmers follow in
07:36 - order to avoid these pacing that is
07:38 - present by default in some of the web
07:40 - browsers so guys let me just save this
07:42 - file now and try reloading this page
07:44 - once again on the browser so now if you
07:46 - see there is no spacing on the left or
07:48 - on the top of this navigation bar and
07:50 - simply we can go and select one of the
07:52 - list items from this navigation bar guys
07:55 - apart from this we can also have more
07:56 - options over here so simply you can add
07:58 - more options in this case so over here
08:01 - simply I'm going to copy these lines of
08:03 - code in this case and simply we are
08:05 - going to have more options so let's say
08:07 - we have languages over here and then
08:09 - let's say we have news and then let's
08:11 - say we have the contact option and then
08:14 - the last option is the about option over
08:16 - here so guys let me just save this file
08:18 - now and simply we have to reload this
08:20 - page so as you can see the other options
08:22 - are also getting displayed over here and
08:25 - this is the way that you can create the
08:26 - horizontal navigation bar now guys we
08:28 - have used the HF attribute as the hash
08:31 - character over have for the test purpose
08:33 - but these are going to be the real
08:35 - production links when you are going to
08:37 - implement them in your project so guys
08:39 - please make note of this HF attribute
08:42 - over here and apart from this you can
08:44 - replicate these styling for your next
08:46 - project and you can practice on your own
08:48 - so guys comment in the comment section

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see horizontal navigation bar in CSS so guys basically navigation bar is a list of links which we are going to check with the help of examples as well and by using those list of links we are going to create a horizontal navigation bar so guys horizontal navigation bar can be created by using the display equal to inline property on the list of items so guys let us check this with the help of examples in vs code over here and previously we had seen how we can create the vertical navigation bar over here so guys similarly we are going to create a horizontal navigation bar in this case so what we are going to do is simply I'm going to remove the previous lines of code that we had written in the HTML and the CSS files over here now simply we are going to have the unordered list in this case inside which we are going to have the four list items so basically we are going to define the Four list items over here and then inside these list items we are going to have the anchor tags over here and they are going to have the hrf attribute with the hash character over here for test purpose now guys let us Define the text inside these anchor tags over here so let's say we have home and then we have blog and then let's say we have photos and then we have videos over here so these are the four list items that should be present inside the horizontal navigation bar guys over here we are going to go step by step in order to create a complete horizontal navig ation bar with the help of these unordered list items over here so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have this unordered list which is present in the form of a vertical list over here so guys now first of all we are going to remove these bullets from the unordered list and also remove the padding and the margin that is present by default inside this horizontal list so guys inside the style. CSS file over here simply we are going to define the UL that is the unordered list tag and then we are going to say list style type so guys basically this is the CSS property that is used in order to Define what kind of bullet points we want to display as far as the unordered list is concerned so by default it is the circle that is getting displayed over here we can display them as Square as well so when we save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see these are the square bullets over here but guys since we are creating the horizontal nav navigation bar we don't want any bullets over here so simply we are going to provide none s the list style type so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we no longer have any of the bullets over here now guys simply we are going to remove the padding and margin as well from these unordered list so we are going to say padding is equal to zero and also the margin attribute as zero over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see see there is no longer padding and margin that is present by default inside this unordered list now guys what we are going to do is we will be removing the underlines from all these anchor tags over here so simply inside the LI that is the list item we have the anchor tags over here and then we are going to say text decoration it should be equal to none and also we are going to set the color as white in this case so guys basically we are going to set the text color as white and the background color of this unordered l as black so guys basically we are going to say background color as black in this case so guys when we are going to set the background color of this entire unordered list as black so the background color of the navigation bar will be updated to black color and the text color of the anchor text over here will be updated to white color and that is how we are going to make a perfect navigation bar so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the black background color over here and the text color of all these links is being updated to white color now now guys one more important thing we are going to have all these text in one line over here so what we can do is simply these list items that we have created we need to display them as inline since they are being displayed as the Block Level elements over here right now so simply we are going to
