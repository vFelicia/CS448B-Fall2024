With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see input type text in
00:02 - HTML form so guys basically this is the
00:05 - format we have the type attribute in
00:07 - order to Define what kind of input we
00:10 - are expecting from the user so in this
00:12 - case we are going to see the type
00:14 - attribute for which the value is text
00:16 - which defines a single line text input
00:19 - field so guys for example if you are
00:22 - having a website wherein there is a
00:24 - registration form and you want the user
00:26 - to provide the full name that is the
00:28 - first name and last name such input Texs
00:31 - with the type text can be used in order
00:33 - to help the user provide the first name
00:36 - and the last name data apart from that
00:38 - while you are logging in into some of
00:40 - the websites you will be seeing that
00:42 - username is one of the text fields and
00:44 - that is of the type text over there so
00:46 - guys let us check this with the help of
00:48 - examples in vs code over here so first
00:50 - of all we will have a simple paragraph
00:53 - and then we will say below content is in
00:56 - HTML form so guys this is a very simple
00:59 - state statement below content is an HTML
01:02 - form and then what we will do is we will
01:04 - Define the form over here and by default
01:06 - we are getting the action attribute we
01:08 - will ignore this particular attribute
01:10 - for now because we are just checking the
01:13 - input type that is a basic text field
01:15 - with the help of the input tag over here
01:18 - for which the type will be text so guys
01:20 - what we have to do is inside the form we
01:22 - can simply have the input followed by
01:24 - colon and then we can type text over
01:27 - here so guys this is the Mt abbreviation
01:29 - that that is provided by the vs code
01:31 - which is one of the special features of
01:34 - the VSS code and this is the reason why
01:36 - majority of the software developers use
01:38 - vs code as one of their editors so guys
01:41 - when we select this option as you can
01:43 - see the type is text over here and by
01:45 - default the input tag provides a type as
01:48 - text and this will be a basic text field
01:51 - that will be displayed on the UI so guys
01:53 - let me just save this file now and try
01:55 - reloading this page once again on the
01:57 - browser so as you can see below content
01:59 - is in HTML form paragraph is being
02:02 - displayed and then we are having a
02:04 - simple text field over here that will
02:06 - allow the user to provide the data over
02:09 - here and guys this is a very simple way
02:11 - in order to provide a text field by
02:13 - using the input tag over here with a
02:15 - type attribute as text value guys apart
02:18 - from that we can also have the label for
02:20 - this particular text field so what we
02:22 - will do is we will provide the name as F
02:24 - name over here which is first name and
02:26 - then let's say we provide the ID as
02:28 - first name in this case now guys this
02:30 - particular ID will be used inside the
02:32 - label tag that we are going to Define so
02:35 - before this input tag we will say label
02:37 - in this case and we are having the for
02:40 - attribute which will be expecting the ID
02:42 - of the input tag that we want to link
02:45 - this particular label tag over here so
02:47 - what we will do is we will copy the ID
02:50 - that is first name and paste it as the
02:52 - value for this for attribute and then we
02:54 - will give the label as first name in
02:56 - this case so we have given the first
02:58 - name label over here after the label we
03:00 - will provide the line break in this case
03:03 - so that we can see the text field on the
03:05 - next line over here so guys let me just
03:08 - save this file now and try reloading
03:09 - this page once again on the browser so
03:12 - as you can see first name label is being
03:14 - provided over here and this is a basic
03:16 - text field that is being displayed right
03:18 - now and guys what is the importance of
03:20 - this for attribute so as you can see
03:23 - when we click on this first name the
03:25 - cursor will be activated inside this
03:27 - text field which is linked to this first
03:29 - first name label so when we click on
03:31 - this as you can see now we can provide
03:33 - the first name and we can type the first
03:36 - name over here inside the text field in
03:38 - this case now guys similarly we can also
03:40 - have the last name over here so what we
03:42 - can do is simply I'll copy this lines of
03:44 - code and paste it after the first input
03:47 - tag over here and then simply we can
03:49 - change the ID to last name in this case
03:51 - and over here as well we will change the
03:53 - ID to last name over here the name will
03:55 - be changed to L name we will update the
03:58 - label as well to last name in this case
04:00 - let me just save this file now and try
04:02 - reloading this page once again on the
04:04 - browser so as you can see we have got
04:06 - the last name as well so when we click
04:08 - on this last name the text field is
04:10 - automatically activated over here and
04:13 - user can provide the required data in
04:16 - this particular text field as well now
04:18 - guys what happens when we provide the
04:19 - incorrect IDs for this four attribute so
04:22 - let's say we provide the last name ID to
04:25 - this first label over here and the first
04:27 - name ID to the second label over here so
04:29 - let me just save this file now and try
04:31 - reloading this page now what will happen
04:34 - is when we click on this first name
04:36 - since this first name is now linked to
04:38 - this second input field the cursor on
04:41 - the second input field will get
04:43 - activated when we click on this first
04:45 - name over here as you can see the cursor
04:47 - in the second input field is getting
04:49 - activated and whatever we type will be
04:51 - displayed in the second input field and
04:54 - when we click on this last name over
04:55 - here so when we click on this as you can
04:57 - see the cursor is getting active
04:59 - activated on the first input field so
05:01 - guys that is the importance of providing
05:03 - the correct ID inside this for attribute
05:06 - so whichever input field we want to get
05:09 - activated we should provide the ID of
05:11 - that input field to this for attribute
05:14 - over here inside the label tag and Guys
05:17 - these are certain things you should know
05:18 - as far as input type of text is
05:21 - concerned so over here we are clicking
05:23 - on the correct label and the cursor is
05:25 - getting activated in the required input
05:27 - field over here this text field will be
05:29 - used a lot when you are going to work on
