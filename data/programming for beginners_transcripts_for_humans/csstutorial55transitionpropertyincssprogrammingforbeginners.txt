With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see transition property
00:02 - in CSS so guys basically the CSS
00:04 - transition allows you to change the
00:07 - property values smoothly over a given
00:10 - duration so guys so far we have seen how
00:13 - we can transform a particular HTML
00:15 - element with the help of the translate
00:18 - rotate or the scale functions inside the
00:21 - CSS but guys those changes were made in
00:24 - such a way that there was no smooth
00:26 - transitioning over here so guys for
00:28 - example if I show you over here if we
00:31 - see the translate X function and let's
00:33 - say we provide 50 pixels of translate X
00:36 - over here so basically what will happen
00:39 - is it is directly moving on the right
00:42 - hand side by 50 pixels and there is no
00:44 - smooth transitioning that is happening
00:46 - from the original position to the Target
00:49 - position over here so guys we will check
00:51 - the entire HTML and the CSS code with
00:54 - the help of example and we are going to
00:56 - make the smooth transition that will
00:58 - work over here so guys what we do is
01:00 - simply I'm going to remove the previous
01:02 - lines of code that we had written in the
01:04 - HTML and the CSS files over here we are
01:07 - going to start from scratch and we are
01:09 - going to see how the transitions will
01:11 - work so basically in order to create a
01:13 - transition effect you must specify two
01:16 - things so what are those two things so
01:18 - the very first important thing is the
01:20 - CSS property you want to add an effect
01:23 - two and the second important thing is
01:25 - the duration of the effect so guys we
01:27 - will check the example now over here we
01:29 - are going to increase the width smoothly
01:32 - in 2 seconds for a particular HTML
01:34 - element so guys over here inside the
01:37 - body tag simply we are going to have the
01:39 - diff tag over here and for this diff tag
01:41 - let us Define certain CSS properties so
01:45 - let's say we have the width of 100
01:47 - pixels and the height as well of 100
01:49 - pixels over here so basically we are
01:51 - going to have the square box with the
01:53 - help of this drift tag and apart from
01:55 - this let us also provide the border of
01:58 - two pixels with the black color in this
02:00 - case so basically we have the Border
02:02 - style is solid and the Border color is
02:04 - black now apart from this let us also
02:06 - have the background color as yellow
02:08 - color this time and also we will get
02:11 - this div HTML element at the center of
02:13 - the screen so basically we are going to
02:15 - use the margin equal to Auto so this
02:17 - will get the diff tag at the center of
02:20 - the screen as far as the horizontal
02:22 - direction is concerned and for the
02:23 - vertical Direction let's say we provide
02:26 - the top margin as 15% over here so let
02:29 - me just save this now and try reloading
02:31 - this page once again on the browser so
02:33 - as you can see this is the square diff
02:35 - tag that we can see right now so guys
02:37 - what we will do is let's say we want to
02:39 - rotate this particular diff tag by 45°
02:42 - so simply we can use the transform
02:44 - property that we had used previously and
02:47 - we can say rotate by 45° over here so
02:51 - basically the value that we have
02:52 - provided is 45 D which stands for
02:55 - degrees let me just save this file now
02:57 - and try reloading this page once again
02:59 - on the browser so as you can see it is
03:01 - rotated by 45° what we will do is we
03:04 - will apply the CSS property on Mouse
03:07 - over so basically we want to use the div
03:10 - tag followed by colon and then we will
03:12 - use the codo class that is hover so we
03:14 - are going to paste this transform
03:16 - property so when the user gets the mouse
03:19 - that is the cursor on this particular
03:21 - diff tag then only the transform
03:23 - property should be applied so guys let
03:25 - me just save this file now and try
03:27 - reloading this page so as you can see
03:28 - this is the original position and when
03:30 - the user gets the mouse on this
03:32 - particular diff tag it is rotating
03:34 - itself but guys if you notice there is
03:36 - no smooth rotation over here basically
03:39 - from the original position it is getting
03:41 - the target position that is rotated at
03:43 - the 45° over here without any smooth
03:46 - transitioning so we are going to apply
03:48 - the smooth transition with the help of
03:50 - the transition property inside CSS so we
03:54 - must have the two important things so
03:56 - first of all the CSS property that we
03:58 - want to use so in this case we are going
04:01 - to have the transform CSS property and
04:03 - Then followed by the duration of the
04:05 - effect so guys basically how do we do
04:07 - that so inside the diff tag over here
04:10 - simply we have to use the transition CSS
04:13 - property this time and the very first
04:15 - parameter will be the CSS property that
04:17 - we want to use so in this case it is
04:19 - going to be transform over here and then
04:22 - followed by the space character and
04:24 - let's say we want to rotate it in 2
04:26 - seconds and not instantly as it is
04:28 - happening by default so guys over here
04:30 - simply we have to provide 2 s which
04:32 - stands for 2 seconds over here let me
04:34 - just save this file now and try
04:36 - reloading this page once again over here
04:38 - so with the help of this particular CSS
04:40 - property what will happen is this diff
04:42 - tag that is the square box will rotate
04:45 - itself with the help of the 45° but this
04:48 - will happen in 2 seconds so it will look
04:50 - like a smooth rotation over here so let
04:53 - me just reload this page once again and
04:55 - when we get the mouse cursor on this sff
04:57 - tag as you can see it is a smooth
04:59 - rotation that is happening over here and
05:01 - when we get the mouse cursor away from
05:03 - this diff tag again it is a smooth
05:05 - transition that is rotation towards its
05:07 - original position over here so guys in
05:10 - this way this is the transition CSS
05:12 - property that we can use in order to
05:14 - provide the smooth rotation or any of
05:16 - the properties that we want to implement
05:19 - in a smooth way so guys let us check
05:21 - another example over here we can also
05:23 - add the multiple properties to the
05:25 - transition so guys notice that we also
05:28 - have another property that is width over
05:30 - here which is 100 pixels so let's say
05:32 - during this transform that is the
05:34 - rotation we also want to increase the
05:36 - width to 200 pixels over here so what we
05:39 - can do is simply we can provide comma
05:41 - after this 2 seconds and we have to
05:43 - provide the CSS property that we want to
05:46 - change that is width in this case and
05:48 - let's say with that same duration of 2
05:50 - seconds we want to increase the width
05:52 - now guys how much we want to increase
05:54 - the width that we need to provide on
05:56 - this hover property over here so
05:58 - basically we want to change the width to
06:02 - 200 pixels this time which is the double
06:04 - value of this 100 pixels which is the
06:06 - original width of the square box so guys
06:08 - let me just save this file now and try
06:10 - reloading this page once again on the
06:12 - browser so now when we get the cursor on
06:14 - this particular square box what will
06:16 - happen is the transform will happen in 2
06:18 - seconds which will rotate the box and
06:21 - also it is going to increase the width
06:23 - within 2 seconds over here to 200 pixels
06:26 - simultaneously so both these things will
06:28 - happen simultaneous L over here in the
06:30 - span of 2 seconds in this case so let me
06:33 - just reload this page once again on the
06:35 - browser and when we get the cursor over
06:37 - here so as you can see in 2 seconds the
06:39 - square box got rotated to 45° as well
06:43 - and apart from that the width also
06:45 - increased to 200 pixels and now it is a
06:48 - rectangle that we can see and when we
06:50 - get the mouse cursor away from this HTML
06:52 - element as you can see it is coming back
06:55 - to its original position over here so
06:57 - guys in this way we can apply the multi
06:59 - mle transition properties over here and
07:02 - we need to provide the values to these
07:04 - CSS properties over here on the hover or
07:07 - any other condition that you want to
07:09 - implement based on the project
07:11 - requirement so guys apart from this we
07:13 - can also have the transition timing
07:15 - function property which is another
07:17 - property that you can mention over here
07:19 - so guys basically when you type
07:21 - transition as you can see this is the
07:22 - CSS property over here that is the
07:24 - timing function so we have multiple
07:26 - values that you can use over here so
07:28 - basically when we we provide the value
07:30 - of e it will start slowly and then in
07:33 - between it will move faster and then in
07:35 - the end the transition will end slowly
07:38 - so guys let me just save this file now
07:39 - and try reloading this page once again
07:41 - on the browser when we get the cursor
07:43 - over here as you can see in the middle
07:45 - it was very fast and at the start and at
07:47 - the end it was very slow over here so
07:50 - guys this is the meaning of E's value in
07:52 - this case we can also provide linear in
07:55 - which case the speed of the transition
07:57 - will be same throughout the span so guys
08:00 - over here there will be no slow start or
08:02 - slow end so let us check that as well so
08:04 - when we reload this page as you can see
08:06 - this is the linear transition that we
08:09 - can see over here so guys you can check
08:10 - out the other values for this particular
08:12 - transition timing function as you can
08:14 - see these are the list of suggested
08:17 - values over here and then guys apart
08:19 - from this we also have something called
08:20 - as transition delay which will help us
08:22 - in order to delay the transition so guys
08:25 - let us check that as well so over here
08:27 - what we are going to do is simply I'll
08:29 - comment out this line of code and
08:31 - basically we are going to have this
08:33 - transition delay CSS property so guys
08:35 - basically it is going to delay the
08:37 - transition so let's say we provide 2
08:39 - seconds of DeLay So basically the
08:41 - transition is not going to start up to 2
08:44 - seconds and then after that the
08:46 - transition will start that we have
08:47 - already mentioned over here so let me
08:49 - just save this file now and when we
08:51 - reload this page once again on the
08:53 - browser and let's get the cursor over
08:55 - here so 1 2 so after 2 seconds the
08:58 - transition is happening over here here
08:59 - and when we get the cursor away again
09:02 - after 2 seconds the transition will
09:04 - occur in such a way that the HTML
09:06 - element will go back to its original
09:08 - position so guys in this way you can
09:10 - also provide the transition delay based
09:12 - on the project requirements where you
09:14 - want to delay the transition for that
09:16 - particular HTML element guys while doing
09:19 - so can we change the background color as
09:21 - well so let us check that as well so
09:23 - what we will do is over here let us
09:25 - remove the delay as well and after this
09:27 - width we are going to Pro provide the
09:29 - background color property as well and
09:32 - within 2 seconds we want to change so
09:34 - the original color is the yellow color
09:36 - over here let us change the color to
09:39 - some other value so let's say we have
09:41 - the background color as aqua color this
09:43 - time so guys we are moving from yellow
09:45 - color to the aqua color and within the
09:47 - span of 2 seconds over here the color
09:49 - should change so guys let me just save
09:51 - this file now it will be a gradual
09:52 - change if you can see so let me just
09:55 - reload this page once again on the
09:57 - browser so when we get the cursor over
09:59 - here as you can see the color is also
10:01 - changing to Aqua gradually from yellow
10:04 - to Aqua and then when we get the cursor
10:06 - back from this particular rectangle
10:09 - right now that is the HTML element the
10:11 - color should change back from Aqua to
10:13 - Yellow so guys over here as you can see
10:16 - gradually it is also changing the
10:17 - background color so guys whatever CSS
10:20 - properties that you want to change you
10:22 - need to provide inside the transition
10:25 - CSS property and then apart from that
10:27 - you have to provide the time du duration
10:29 - during which the CSS property should get
10:32 - updated over here and the final value
10:35 - should be applied and when that CSS
10:37 - property will update its value the
10:39 - transition will be applied to the HTML
10:41 - element we can also have the different
10:43 - timings over here as well so let's say
10:45 - we want to finish the background color
10:47 - transition within 1 second so we have
10:49 - provided 1 second over here let me just
10:51 - save this file now and try reloading
10:53 - this page once again on the browser so
10:55 - now if you notice the aqua color has
10:58 - completed its transition within 1 second
11:00 - over here and this is the way that you
11:02 - can provide the different times for the
11:04 - transition that you have applied for the
11:06 - transition CSS property so guys comment

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see transition property in CSS so guys basically the CSS transition allows you to change the property values smoothly over a given duration so guys so far we have seen how we can transform a particular HTML element with the help of the translate rotate or the scale functions inside the CSS but guys those changes were made in such a way that there was no smooth transitioning over here so guys for example if I show you over here if we see the translate X function and let's say we provide 50 pixels of translate X over here so basically what will happen is it is directly moving on the right hand side by 50 pixels and there is no smooth transitioning that is happening from the original position to the Target position over here so guys we will check the entire HTML and the CSS code with the help of example and we are going to make the smooth transition that will work over here so guys what we do is simply I'm going to remove the previous lines of code that we had written in the HTML and the CSS files over here we are going to start from scratch and we are going to see how the transitions will work so basically in order to create a transition effect you must specify two things so what are those two things so the very first important thing is the CSS property you want to add an effect two and the second important thing is the duration of the effect so guys we will check the example now over here we are going to increase the width smoothly in 2 seconds for a particular HTML element so guys over here inside the body tag simply we are going to have the diff tag over here and for this diff tag let us Define certain CSS properties so let's say we have the width of 100 pixels and the height as well of 100 pixels over here so basically we are going to have the square box with the help of this drift tag and apart from this let us also provide the border of two pixels with the black color in this case so basically we have the Border style is solid and the Border color is black now apart from this let us also have the background color as yellow color this time and also we will get this div HTML element at the center of the screen so basically we are going to use the margin equal to Auto so this will get the diff tag at the center of the screen as far as the horizontal direction is concerned and for the vertical Direction let's say we provide the top margin as 15% over here so let me just save this now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is the square diff tag that we can see right now so guys what we will do is let's say we want to rotate this particular diff tag by 45° so simply we can use the transform property that we had used previously and we can say rotate by 45° over here so basically the value that we have provided is 45 D which stands for degrees let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see it is rotated by 45° what we will do is we will apply the CSS property on Mouse over so basically we want to use the div tag followed by colon and then we will use the codo class that is hover so we are going to paste this transform property so when the user gets the mouse that is the cursor on this particular diff tag then only the transform property should be applied so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see this is the original position and when the user gets the mouse on this particular diff tag it is rotating itself but guys if you notice there is no smooth rotation over here basically from the original position it is getting the target position that is rotated at the 45° over here without any smooth transitioning so we are going to apply the smooth transition with the help of the transition property inside CSS so we must have the two important things so first of all the CSS property that we want to use so in this case we are going to have the transform CSS property and Then followed by the duration of the effect so guys basically how do we do that so inside the diff tag over here simply we have to use the transition CSS property this time and the very first parameter will be the CSS property that we want to use so in this case it is going to be transform over here and then followed by the space character and let's say we want to rotate it in 2 seconds and not instantly as it is happening by default so guys over here simply we have to provide 2 s which stands for 2 seconds over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again over here so with the help of this particular CSS property what will happen is this diff tag that is the square box will rotate itself with the help of the 45° but this will happen in 2 seconds so it will look like a smooth rotation over here so let me just reload this page once again and when we get the mouse cursor on this sff tag as you can see it is a smooth rotation that is happening over here and when we get the mouse cursor away from this diff tag again it is a smooth transition that is rotation towards its original position over here so guys in this way this is the transition CSS property that we can use in order to provide the smooth rotation or any of the properties that we want to implement in a smooth way so guys let us check another example over here we can also add the multiple properties to the transition so guys notice that we also have another property that is width over here which is 100 pixels so let's say during this transform that is the rotation we also want to increase the width to 200 pixels over here so what we can do is simply we can provide comma after this 2 seconds and we have to provide the CSS property that we want to change that is width in this case and let's say with that same duration of 2 seconds we want to increase the width now guys how much we want to increase the width that we need to provide on this hover property over here so basically we want to change the width to 200 pixels this time which is the double value of this 100 pixels which is the original width of the square box so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now when we get the cursor on this particular square box what will happen is the transform will happen in 2 seconds which will rotate the box and also it is going to increase the width within 2 seconds over here to 200 pixels simultaneously so both these things will happen simultaneous L over here in the span of 2 seconds in this case so let me just reload this page once again on the browser and when we get the cursor over here so as you can see in 2 seconds the square box got rotated to 45° as well and apart from that the width also increased to 200 pixels and now it is a rectangle that we can see and when we get the mouse cursor away from this HTML element as you can see it is coming back to its original position over here so guys in this way we can apply the multi mle transition properties over here and we need to provide the values to these CSS properties over here on the hover or any other condition that you want to implement based on the project requirement so guys apart from this we can also have the transition timing function property which is another property that you can mention over here so guys basically when you type transition as you can see this is the CSS property over here that is the timing function so we have multiple values that you can use over here so basically when we we provide the value of e it will start slowly and then in between it will move faster and then in the end the transition will end slowly so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser when we get the cursor over here as you can see in the middle it was very fast and at the start and at the end it was very slow over here so guys this is the meaning of E's value in this case we can also provide linear in which case the speed of the transition will be same throughout the span so guys over here there will be no slow start or slow end so let us check that as well so when we reload this page as you can see this is the linear transition that we can see over here so guys you can check out the other values for this particular transition timing function as you can see these are the list of suggested values over here and then guys apart from this we also have something called as transition delay which will help us in order to delay the transition so guys let us check that as well so over here what we are going to do is simply I'll comment out this line of code and basically we are going to have this transition delay CSS property so guys basically it is going to delay the transition so let's say we provide 2 seconds of DeLay So basically the transition is not going to start up to 2 seconds and then after that the transition will start that we have already mentioned over here so let me just save this file now and when we reload this page once again on the browser and let's get the cursor over here so 1 2 so after 2 seconds the transition is happening over here here and when we get the cursor away again after 2 seconds the transition will occur in such a way that the HTML element will go back to its original position so guys in this way you can also provide the transition delay based on the project requirements where you want to delay the transition for that particular HTML element guys while doing so can we change the background color as well so let us check that as well so what we will do is over here let us remove the delay as well and after this width we are going to Pro provide the background color property as well and within 2 seconds we want to change so the original color is the yellow color over here let us change the color to some other value so let's say we have the background color as aqua color this time so guys we are moving from yellow color to the aqua color and within the span of 2 seconds over here the color should change so guys let me just save this file now it will be a gradual change if you can see so let me just reload this page once again on the browser so when we get the cursor over here as you can see the color is also changing to Aqua gradually from yellow to Aqua and then when we get the cursor back from this particular rectangle right now that is the HTML element the color should change back from Aqua to Yellow so guys over here as you can see gradually it is also changing the background color so guys whatever CSS properties that you want to change you need to provide inside the transition CSS property and then apart from that you have to provide the time du duration during which the CSS property should get updated over here and the final value should be applied and when that CSS property will update its value the transition will be applied to the HTML element we can also have the different timings over here as well so let's say we want to finish the background color transition within 1 second so we have provided 1 second over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now if you notice the aqua color has completed its transition within 1 second over here and this is the way that you can provide the different times for the transition that you have applied for the transition CSS property so guys comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is animations in CSS so stay tuned
