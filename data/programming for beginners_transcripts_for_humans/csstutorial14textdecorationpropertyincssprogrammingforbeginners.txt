With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see text decoration
00:02 - property in CSS so guys basically the
00:04 - text decoration property is used to
00:07 - format the text using CSS and this we
00:10 - are going to check with the help of
00:12 - examples as well there are multiple
00:14 - properties inside the text decoration
00:16 - and the first property that we are going
00:18 - to use is the text decoration line so
00:21 - guys let us check this with the help of
00:22 - example in vs code over here so I'll
00:25 - simply remove the previous lines of code
00:27 - from the index.html file and also Al
00:30 - from the style. CSS file over here
00:32 - basically we have a simple statement
00:34 - that is this is a test div element let
00:36 - me just save this file now and try
00:38 - reloading this page on the browser so as
00:41 - you can see this is the div tag inside
00:43 - which we have the statement that is this
00:46 - is a test Dev element now guys what is
00:48 - the meaning of the text decoration line
00:50 - so over here we have the CSS property
00:53 - that we can Define inside the style. CSS
00:55 - file so let us move to the style. CSS
00:58 - file here so guys basically this is the
01:01 - property that we are going to use and
01:03 - you can see there are multiple values
01:05 - for this text decoration line such as
01:07 - line through and then we have overline
01:09 - underline and none so guys basically the
01:12 - value that is underline will help us in
01:15 - order to underline this particular text
01:17 - inside the dev element so let us check
01:19 - that with the help of the underline
01:21 - value so let me just save this file now
01:23 - and try reloading this page on the
01:25 - browser so as you can see the text is
01:27 - getting underlined over here so the text
01:29 - text decoration line helps us in order
01:32 - to provide a line to the text in this
01:34 - case apart from underline we have other
01:36 - values as well so let us check what is
01:38 - the meaning of line through over here so
01:40 - let me just save this file now and try
01:42 - reloading this page once again on the
01:44 - browser so it will be kind of a strike
01:47 - through in this case where the text will
01:48 - be displayed behind the strike through
01:50 - over here with the help of the line
01:52 - through value apart from this we also
01:55 - have other value as well so let us check
01:57 - that so we have something called as
01:59 - overline over here so let me just save
02:01 - this file now and try reloading this
02:03 - page once again on the browser so
02:05 - similar to underline a line will be
02:07 - drawn above the text with the help of
02:09 - the overline value for the text
02:11 - decoration line so guys this is the way
02:13 - that we can provide the different values
02:15 - for the text decoration line over here
02:18 - simply we will provide the value that is
02:20 - underline so let us reload this page
02:22 - once again so the text is getting
02:24 - underlined now inside this Dev element
02:27 - now guys apart from this we can also
02:29 - have the text decoration color so let us
02:31 - apply the color to this underline that
02:33 - we have provided to this div element so
02:36 - inside the div tag simply we are going
02:38 - to provide text decoration hyphen color
02:41 - so this is the property that we are
02:43 - going to use and let us say we want to
02:45 - provide red color as the color for the
02:47 - underline so let me just save this file
02:50 - now and try reloading this page once
02:52 - again on the browser so as you can see
02:54 - the underline is having the red color
02:56 - now with the help of the text decoration
02:58 - color apart from from that we also have
03:00 - something called as text decoration
03:02 - style so let us check what will be the
03:04 - values of the text decoration style over
03:06 - here so we simply have to provide text
03:09 - decoration hyphen style in this case so
03:12 - this is the CSS property and as you can
03:14 - see we have multiple values over here by
03:17 - default the value will be solid in this
03:19 - case so let us provide the dashed value
03:21 - to the text decoration style let me just
03:24 - save this file now and try reloading
03:26 - this page once again on the browser so
03:28 - this is the text decorations style that
03:30 - is having the dashed value in this case
03:32 - apart from that we can also provide the
03:35 - dotted value as well so let us check how
03:37 - it looks like so now the underline is
03:39 - getting represented with the help of the
03:41 - dots for this particular HTML element
03:44 - now guys apart from that we have
03:45 - something called as text decoration
03:47 - thickness so basically you can provide
03:50 - the width of the underline that is being
03:52 - provided to the HTML element so we can
03:55 - use this thickness property in order to
03:58 - provide the width of the underline so
04:00 - over here we have the text decoration
04:03 - thickness in this case so this is the
04:05 - CSS property that we will be using and
04:07 - let's say we provide 5 pixels as the
04:09 - thickness for this underline let me just
04:11 - save this file now and try reloading
04:13 - this page once again on the browser so
04:16 - as you can see this is the five pixels
04:18 - dotted underline that we can see for
04:20 - this HTML element let us change the
04:22 - style to the solid value so that it
04:24 - looks more decent over here so when we
04:26 - change the value of the text decoration
04:28 - style in this case as solid let me just
04:31 - save this file now and try reloading
04:32 - this page as you can see this is the
04:34 - solid underline with the color red and
04:37 - having the width S 5 pixels with the
04:39 - help of the text decoration thickness
04:41 - CSS property so guys in this way you can
04:44 - easily use all these text decoration
04:47 - properties based on your requirements
04:49 - and apart from that you can also provide
04:51 - the simple text decoration CSS property
04:55 - that is the shorthand property in order
04:57 - to provide the values for all these CS s
04:59 - s properties so guys let us check that
05:01 - as well so I'll simply remove all these
05:03 - lines of code over here and simply let
05:06 - me just save this file now and try
05:07 - reloading this page once again on the
05:09 - browser so there is no text decoration
05:11 - that is being provided right now so what
05:14 - we can do is simply we can provide the
05:16 - text decoration shorthand property in
05:19 - this case and simply we are going to
05:21 - provide all these values one at a time
05:23 - over here so first of all the text
05:25 - decoration line should be underline
05:27 - followed by the space character and then
05:30 - the color of the underline should be red
05:32 - color followed by the style which should
05:34 - be the solid style in this case and
05:36 - let's say we want the text decoration
05:38 - thickness to be 7 pixels so simply we
05:41 - will provide the 7 pixels over here so
05:43 - guys this is the sequence that we can
05:45 - provide inside the text decoration Shand
05:48 - property that will allow us with the
05:50 - help of a single line of code provide
05:52 - all the text decoration CSS properties
05:55 - now let me just save this file now and
05:57 - try reloading this page once again on on
05:59 - the browser so as you can see there is a
06:01 - underline that is being provided to this
06:03 - HTML element based on the text
06:06 - decoration values that we have provided
06:08 - over here now instead of underline let
06:10 - us say we want it to be the overline
06:13 - text decoration in this case so simply
06:15 - instead of underline we will say
06:17 - overline over here as the value for the
06:19 - text decoration line so let me just save
06:22 - this file now and try reloading this
06:24 - page once again on the browser so as you
06:26 - can see we have the OV line now for this
06:29 - particular HTML element so guys this is
06:31 - the way that you can use the different
06:33 - text decoration properties and they are
06:36 - well Ed inside the HTML and the CSS code
06:39 - based on your requirements to be
06:41 - displayed on the web page now guys apart
06:43 - from this as you know that all the links
06:45 - in HTML are underlined by default so
06:48 - basically it is not a good practice in
06:50 - order to manually underline a particular
06:53 - text value inside the web page since a
06:55 - default way of providing the links to
06:57 - HTML is having the underline to that
07:00 - particular text which is the hyperlink
07:02 - but sometimes you will see that the
07:04 - links are styled with no underline and
07:06 - how that is done with the help of text
07:08 - decoration value that is set to none and
07:11 - it is used to remove the underline from
07:13 - links so guys let us check that as well
07:15 - with the help of example over here so
07:18 - what we will do is let us have the
07:20 - anchor tag over here which will help us
07:22 - in order to provide a link so over here
07:24 - we have a tag followed by href inside
07:27 - which we are going to provide the URL of
07:30 - a specific web page so over here we
07:32 - don't want it to be redirected to any
07:34 - other web page so we will simply provide
07:36 - the hash character over here and simply
07:38 - we will say click here in this case so
07:40 - when we say click here this is the text
07:43 - which will appear as a link on our web
07:45 - page so guys let me just save this file
07:47 - now and try reloading this page once
07:49 - again on the browser so as you can see
07:51 - this is the link that is getting
07:52 - displayed and by default there's a
07:54 - underline as you can see with the help
07:57 - of a blue color over here now guys let
07:59 - us say we don't want this underline to
08:01 - be displayed for this particular link so
08:03 - what we can do is simply inside the
08:05 - style. CSS file for this a tag we will
08:08 - Define the texture decoration so over
08:10 - here we provide the a tag in this case
08:13 - and inside this we will say text
08:15 - decoration over here and simply for this
08:18 - text decoration CSS property we will
08:20 - assign the value that is none in this
08:22 - case so guys the meaning of none over
08:24 - here is basically no text decoration
08:26 - will be applied to this tag that is the
08:28 - 8 tag in this case so guys let me just
08:31 - save this file now and try reloading
08:33 - this page once again on the browser
08:34 - before reloading you can see that there
08:36 - is an underline for this click here Link
08:39 - in this case but when we reload this
08:41 - page as you can see there is no
08:43 - underline now for this particular link
08:45 - so guys this is the way that you can
08:47 - remove the underline from all the links
08:49 - on your web page by using the text
08:52 - decoration which should be having the
08:54 - value as none that will remove all the
08:56 - underlines from the link which is being
08:58 - displayed by default so guys comment in
