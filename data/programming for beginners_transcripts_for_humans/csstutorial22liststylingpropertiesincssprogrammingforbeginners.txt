00:00 - so now we will see list styling
00:02 - properties in CSS so guys basically we
00:05 - can style the list items in HTML using
00:08 - the CSS properties and this we are going
00:10 - to check with the help of examples as
00:12 - well now guys the very first thing that
00:14 - we are going to see is the list style
00:16 - type CSS property so let us move to vs
00:19 - code over here and simply I'm going to
00:22 - remove the previous lines of code that
00:24 - we had return in the HTML and the CSS
00:27 - file in this case and then guys simply
00:29 - we are going to have the unordered list
00:31 - so guys basically there are two types of
00:33 - list in HTML that we can Define that is
00:36 - unordered list and the ordered list as
00:38 - well so first of all we will check the
00:40 - example of the unordered list so simply
00:43 - we are going to say UL so this is the Mt
00:45 - abbreviation so UL tag stands for
00:48 - unordered list over here inside which we
00:51 - are going to have the list item so guys
00:53 - we can simply Define the Alli tags in
00:55 - this case and inside the Alli tags you
00:58 - can provide the content of the the list
01:00 - so guys simply we are going to say
01:03 - unordered list item one in this case and
01:07 - simply I'm going to copy paste these
01:09 - lines of code so that we can have more
01:11 - items over here and we will name them as
01:14 - item 2 item 3 and then item four
01:17 - respectively let me just save this file
01:19 - now and try reloading this page on the
01:21 - browser so as you can see we have the
01:23 - unordered list item from 1 up to 4 now
01:27 - guys by default this is the list Style
01:30 - type that is getting displayed with the
01:31 - help of the bullets over here now guys
01:34 - instead of displaying these bullets we
01:36 - can display something else as well for
01:38 - these unordered list so let us check
01:40 - that with the help of example over here
01:42 - so we need to do it inside the style.
01:45 - CSS file and inside this first of all we
01:47 - are going to define the tag that is UL
01:50 - in which case we are going to define the
01:52 - CSS properties for the unordered list
01:55 - and then guys we have something called
01:56 - as list style type over here so as you
01:59 - can see this is the CSS property that we
02:01 - are going to use and then we can have
02:03 - many values as you can see we have
02:05 - Circle apart from this we also have
02:07 - square we can also have none in which
02:10 - case there will be no bullets that will
02:12 - be displayed by default so let us say we
02:14 - want the elements to be displayed with
02:16 - the help of the circle over here so we
02:19 - have set the value as Circle in this
02:21 - case let me just save this file now and
02:23 - try reloading this page once again on
02:25 - the browser so instead of bullets we are
02:28 - getting Circle in this case now let us
02:30 - say we want to display them as squares
02:32 - so what we can do is simply instead of
02:34 - the circle value we can say Square value
02:38 - let me just save this file now and try
02:40 - reloading this page once again on the
02:42 - browser so as you can see the list are
02:44 - getting displayed with the help of the
02:46 - squares in this case on their left hand
02:48 - side and guys in this way we can easily
02:51 - use the list style type for the
02:53 - unordered list now guys apart from this
02:55 - we can also have the list style type for
02:57 - the ordered list as well so so let us
03:00 - check that so inside the HTML file after
03:03 - the unordered list we will have the
03:05 - ordered list tag so we have the o tag
03:08 - over here inside which we are going to
03:10 - define the list items so let's say we
03:13 - have the items as ordered list one and
03:16 - then simply I'm going to copy paste this
03:18 - line of code so that we can have the
03:21 - multiple items over here we will say
03:24 - item we missed out the item keyword in
03:27 - this case so we have list item one and
03:29 - then then we will say list item 2 three
03:32 - and then
03:39 - four so guys basically we have the
03:41 - ordered list item 1 up to four in this
03:44 - case let me just save this file now and
03:46 - try reloading this page once again on
03:48 - the browser so as you can see in the
03:50 - ordered list by default we get the
03:53 - numbers that gets displayed which will
03:55 - tell us the number at which the list
03:57 - item is present now guys let us let's
03:59 - say we want to change the list style
04:02 - type over here and we want to display
04:04 - the Roman numbers in this case so what
04:06 - we can do is simply we can come inside
04:08 - the style. CSS file and over here we
04:11 - will Define the o tag since we want the
04:14 - list style type to be defined for the
04:17 - ordered list and inside this we are
04:19 - going to say list style type CSS
04:21 - property and let's say we provide the
04:24 - Roman numbers and we want the upper
04:26 - Roman numbers over here so guys we have
04:28 - lower Roman and we also have the upper
04:31 - Roman so we select this value that is
04:33 - upper Roman let me just save this file
04:35 - now and try reloading this page once
04:37 - again on the browser so as you can see
04:40 - Roman numbers are getting used over here
04:43 - in order to define the item numbers in
04:46 - this case inside the ordered list so
04:48 - guys this is the main difference inside
04:50 - the unordered list we don't know at
04:52 - which number a particular item is
04:54 - present but inside the ordered list we
04:57 - have the numbers that is 1 2 2 3 4 which
05:01 - will represent the items inside that
05:03 - ordered list and we can customize the
05:06 - list style type over here by using this
05:08 - particular CSS property now apart from
05:11 - this we also have the list style
05:13 - position so guys let us check this as
05:15 - well with the help of examples so let us
05:18 - say we have some random text over here
05:20 - for this unordered list items in such a
05:22 - way that the items are occupying
05:24 - multiple number of lines so guys what we
05:27 - can do is inside this ordered list I'm
05:29 - going to keep only two items in this
05:32 - case so I'm going to remove the third
05:34 - and the fourth item over here and we
05:36 - will change the content of the first and
05:38 - the second item so simply we are going
05:40 - to generate some random text with the
05:43 - lurm m at abbreviation and then we
05:45 - multiply it by two so that we get some
05:48 - good amount of random text over here for
05:50 - the first item and the second item as
05:53 - well so over here as well we will say
05:56 - lurm m at abbreviation so guys basically
05:59 - in both the list items we have generated
06:01 - some good amount of content over here
06:04 - let me just save this file now and try
06:06 - reloading this page once again on the
06:08 - browser so as you can see we have the
06:11 - list items that are occupying multiple
06:13 - lines in this case so over here four
06:16 - lines are getting occupied for each list
06:18 - item in the unordered list now guys let
06:21 - us use the list style position over here
06:24 - that is the next CSS property so we will
06:27 - move to the style. CSS over here and
06:29 - inside the unordered list we will say
06:32 - list style position so as you can see
06:35 - this is the CSS property that we want to
06:38 - use and by default the value of this
06:40 - list style position is outside so
06:43 - basically when we set it to outside we
06:45 - won't see any changes in this case so
06:48 - let me just save this file now and try
06:50 - reloading this page once again on the
06:52 - browser so as you can see there is no
06:54 - change right now so guys what is the
06:56 - meaning of this particular CSS property
06:59 - that is is list style position so guys
07:01 - it is the position of this particular
07:04 - square that is representing the list
07:06 - item so it is currently outside of the
07:10 - content of this list item so as you can
07:12 - see when we highlight this content it is
07:15 - to the left of this content but let's
07:17 - say if we want this Square to be the
07:20 - part of this list item inside the
07:22 - unordered list so what we can do is
07:25 - simply we can set the list style
07:27 - position to inside in this case
07:30 - so as you can see this is the list of
07:32 - values that we can set so the other
07:34 - value is inside so we are going to set
07:36 - that particular value let me just save
07:38 - this file now and try reloading this
07:40 - page once again on the browser so now if
07:43 - you see the square is now the part of
07:45 - this particular list item and it is
07:47 - getting displayed inside of the list
07:50 - item that is being displayed on the page
07:53 - so the second line over here it is just
07:55 - below this particular Square which tells
07:58 - us that this particular list style
08:00 - position is set to inside value so guys
08:03 - in this way if you want this square or
08:05 - Circle or any other value that you have
08:08 - set for this list style type to be the
08:11 - part of the list item then you can set
08:13 - the list style position to inside and if
08:16 - you want it to be outside then that will
08:18 - be the default value and you don't have
08:20 - to set it explicitly now guys apart from
08:23 - this we can also remove the default
08:25 - settings by setting the list style type
08:28 - to none so guys let us check that as
08:30 - well so what we will do is simply we are
08:32 - going to have another list that is the
08:35 - unordered list over here and let's say
08:37 - we have the item one and item two in
08:40 - this case so simply I'm going to paste
08:43 - this list item over here and we will say
08:45 - item two let me just save this file now
08:48 - and try reloading this page once again
08:50 - on the browser so as you can see we have
08:52 - item one and item two in this case now
08:55 - guys let us set the ID for this
08:57 - particular unordered list because we
08:59 - already have another unordered list that
09:01 - we have set previously so in this case
09:03 - we will set the ID and the value that we
09:06 - are going to set is a remove style in
09:09 - this case so guys basically we are going
09:11 - to use this value of the ID in order to
09:14 - set the CSS property so let me just copy
09:17 - this value and let me just save this
09:19 - file that is the HTML file and over here
09:22 - we are going to use the ID so we say
09:24 - hash character followed by the ID that
09:26 - is remove style so guys if you remember
09:29 - if we want to provide the CSS properties
09:32 - with the help of the ID of the HTML
09:35 - element then we use the hash character
09:37 - over here before specifying the ID of
09:39 - the HTML element and if we want to use
09:42 - the class then we use the dot character
09:44 - before the class name so guys inside
09:46 - this simply we are going to say list
09:49 - style type it is equal to none so guys
09:52 - basically whatever default CSS
09:54 - properties are set for the unordered
09:56 - list all those properties will be
09:58 - removed so in this case we will be
10:00 - seeing that the square that is getting
10:03 - displayed over here will be removed and
10:05 - these will be simple item one and item
10:08 - two that will be displayed on the web
10:10 - browser so let me just save this file
10:13 - now and try reloading this page once
10:15 - again on the browser so as you can see
10:17 - there is no bullet or any other list
10:20 - style type that is getting displayed but
10:22 - we are simply getting the items that is
10:24 - item one and item two being displayed on
10:27 - the web browser so in this way you can
10:30 - remove the default settings from the
10:32 - list by using the list style type value
10:35 - as none now guys apart from this we also
10:38 - have something called as list style
10:40 - image so instead of displaying the
10:42 - square or the circles over here or the
10:45 - Roman numbers in this case we can also
10:47 - use the image icons that will help us in
10:50 - order to make them look more attractive
10:53 - so guys I'll leave this property that is
10:55 - list style image as a homework for you
10:57 - so that you can practice on your own so

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see list styling properties in CSS so guys basically we can style the list items in HTML using the CSS properties and this we are going to check with the help of examples as well now guys the very first thing that we are going to see is the list style type CSS property so let us move to vs code over here and simply I'm going to remove the previous lines of code that we had return in the HTML and the CSS file in this case and then guys simply we are going to have the unordered list so guys basically there are two types of list in HTML that we can Define that is unordered list and the ordered list as well so first of all we will check the example of the unordered list so simply we are going to say UL so this is the Mt abbreviation so UL tag stands for unordered list over here inside which we are going to have the list item so guys we can simply Define the Alli tags in this case and inside the Alli tags you can provide the content of the the list so guys simply we are going to say unordered list item one in this case and simply I'm going to copy paste these lines of code so that we can have more items over here and we will name them as item 2 item 3 and then item four respectively let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have the unordered list item from 1 up to 4 now guys by default this is the list Style type that is getting displayed with the help of the bullets over here now guys instead of displaying these bullets we can display something else as well for these unordered list so let us check that with the help of example over here so we need to do it inside the style. CSS file and inside this first of all we are going to define the tag that is UL in which case we are going to define the CSS properties for the unordered list and then guys we have something called as list style type over here so as you can see this is the CSS property that we are going to use and then we can have many values as you can see we have Circle apart from this we also have square we can also have none in which case there will be no bullets that will be displayed by default so let us say we want the elements to be displayed with the help of the circle over here so we have set the value as Circle in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so instead of bullets we are getting Circle in this case now let us say we want to display them as squares so what we can do is simply instead of the circle value we can say Square value let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the list are getting displayed with the help of the squares in this case on their left hand side and guys in this way we can easily use the list style type for the unordered list now guys apart from this we can also have the list style type for the ordered list as well so so let us check that so inside the HTML file after the unordered list we will have the ordered list tag so we have the o tag over here inside which we are going to define the list items so let's say we have the items as ordered list one and then simply I'm going to copy paste this line of code so that we can have the multiple items over here we will say item we missed out the item keyword in this case so we have list item one and then then we will say list item 2 three and then four so guys basically we have the ordered list item 1 up to four in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see in the ordered list by default we get the numbers that gets displayed which will tell us the number at which the list item is present now guys let us let's say we want to change the list style type over here and we want to display the Roman numbers in this case so what we can do is simply we can come inside the style. CSS file and over here we will Define the o tag since we want the list style type to be defined for the ordered list and inside this we are going to say list style type CSS property and let's say we provide the Roman numbers and we want the upper Roman numbers over here so guys we have lower Roman and we also have the upper Roman so we select this value that is upper Roman let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see Roman numbers are getting used over here in order to define the item numbers in this case inside the ordered list so guys this is the main difference inside the unordered list we don't know at which number a particular item is present but inside the ordered list we have the numbers that is 1 2 2 3 4 which will represent the items inside that ordered list and we can customize the list style type over here by using this particular CSS property now apart from this we also have the list style position so guys let us check this as well with the help of examples so let us say we have some random text over here for this unordered list items in such a way that the items are occupying multiple number of lines so guys what we can do is inside this ordered list I'm going to keep only two items in this case so I'm going to remove the third and the fourth item over here and we will change the content of the first and the second item so simply we are going to generate some random text with the lurm m at abbreviation and then we multiply it by two so that we get some good amount of random text over here for the first item and the second item as well so over here as well we will say lurm m at abbreviation so guys basically in both the list items we have generated some good amount of content over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the list items that are occupying multiple lines in this case so over here four lines are getting occupied for each list item in the unordered list now guys let us use the list style position over here that is the next CSS property so we will move to the style. CSS over here and inside the unordered list we will say list style position so as you can see this is the CSS property that we want to use and by default the value of this list style position is outside so basically when we set it to outside we won't see any changes in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see there is no change right now so guys what is the meaning of this particular CSS property that is is list style position so guys it is the position of this particular square that is representing the list item so it is currently outside of the content of this list item so as you can see when we highlight this content it is to the left of this content but let's say if we want this Square to be the part of this list item inside the unordered list so what we can do is simply we can set the list style position to inside in this case so as you can see this is the list of values that we can set so the other value is inside so we are going to set that particular value let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now if you see the square is now the part of this particular list item and it is getting displayed inside of the list item that is being displayed on the page so the second line over here it is just below this particular Square which tells us that this particular list style position is set to inside value so guys in this way if you want this square or Circle or any other value that you have set for this list style type to be the part of the list item then you can set the list style position to inside and if you want it to be outside then that will be the default value and you don't have to set it explicitly now guys apart from this we can also remove the default settings by setting the list style type to none so guys let us check that as well so what we will do is simply we are going to have another list that is the unordered list over here and let's say we have the item one and item two in this case so simply I'm going to paste this list item over here and we will say item two let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have item one and item two in this case now guys let us set the ID for this particular unordered list because we already have another unordered list that we have set previously so in this case we will set the ID and the value that we are going to set is a remove style in this case so guys basically we are going to use this value of the ID in order to set the CSS property so let me just copy this value and let me just save this file that is the HTML file and over here we are going to use the ID so we say hash character followed by the ID that is remove style so guys if you remember if we want to provide the CSS properties with the help of the ID of the HTML element then we use the hash character over here before specifying the ID of the HTML element and if we want to use the class then we use the dot character before the class name so guys inside this simply we are going to say list style type it is equal to none so guys basically whatever default CSS properties are set for the unordered list all those properties will be removed so in this case we will be seeing that the square that is getting displayed over here will be removed and these will be simple item one and item two that will be displayed on the web browser so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see there is no bullet or any other list style type that is getting displayed but we are simply getting the items that is item one and item two being displayed on the web browser so in this way you can remove the default settings from the list by using the list style type value as none now guys apart from this we also have something called as list style image so instead of displaying the square or the circles over here or the Roman numbers in this case we can also use the image icons that will help us in order to make them look more attractive so guys I'll leave this property that is list style image as a homework for you so that you can practice on your own so comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is table styling properties in CSS so stay tuned
