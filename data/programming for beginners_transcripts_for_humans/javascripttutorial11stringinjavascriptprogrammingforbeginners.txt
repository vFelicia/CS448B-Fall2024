With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see string in JavaScript
00:02 - so guys basically string is a text that
00:05 - can be assigned or stored inside the
00:07 - variable and this we are going to check
00:09 - with the help of examples as well so
00:11 - this is the syntax that you can define a
00:14 - particular string so as you can see we
00:16 - have used the const keyword over here
00:18 - followed by the name of the variable
00:20 - that is Str Str now guys this particular
00:22 - variable will be a string when you
00:24 - provide the value on the left hand side
00:27 - which is enclosed in between the double
00:29 - quote over here so as you can see this
00:32 - particular value that is programming for
00:33 - beginners is enclosed in between the
00:36 - double codes and that is why the data
00:38 - type of this particular variable will be
00:40 - string over here now guys you can either
00:43 - use the double codes or the single code
00:45 - or you can also use the back take so all
00:48 - these we are going to check with the
00:49 - help of examples as well so let us move
00:52 - to the vs code over here so first of all
00:54 - let us Define the variable by using the
00:57 - const keyword so let's say we provide
00:59 - the variable name as Str Str that is
01:01 - string over here equal to and then we
01:03 - need to provide the value inside the
01:05 - double codes over here so guys basically
01:08 - we provide the value that is programming
01:10 - for beginners that is the name of this
01:12 - YouTube channel that you should
01:13 - subscribe if you have not done so we
01:15 - have provided the value that is
01:16 - programming for beginners in between the
01:18 - double Cotes over here let us print the
01:21 - type of this particular string variable
01:24 - so simply we can use the type of
01:26 - operator over here and then followed by
01:29 - the name of the variable that is Str Str
01:31 - so guys basically this particular log
01:34 - statement will help us in order to print
01:36 - the data type of this particular
01:38 - variable so let me just save this file
01:40 - now and try running this code by using
01:42 - the node command on the terminal so we
01:45 - provide node followed by space character
01:47 - and then the name of the Javascript file
01:49 - that is test.js so when we press enter
01:52 - as you can see we are getting the string
01:55 - data type over here that's because we
01:57 - have provided the value in between the
01:59 - double code over here and simply in
02:01 - order to print the string what we can do
02:03 - is again we can provide the console. log
02:06 - statement and this time we will provide
02:08 - the name of the variable that is St Str
02:11 - so let me just save this file now and
02:13 - try running this code once again over
02:15 - here so as you can see the data type is
02:17 - string and then we are getting the value
02:19 - of the string that is programming for
02:21 - beginners over here instead of using the
02:23 - double codes simply we can use the
02:25 - single quote as well so instead of
02:27 - providing double quote we are providing
02:29 - single Cote so over here so when we run
02:31 - this code once again we are not going to
02:33 - see any change as far as the output is
02:35 - concerned that's because it is same
02:37 - whether you provide the double codes or
02:39 - the single code when you are defining
02:41 - the string value now guys apart from
02:43 - this you can also concatenate two string
02:46 - by using the plus operator over here
02:48 - when you're using numbers the plus
02:50 - operator is used in order to add two or
02:53 - multiple numbers but when you're using
02:55 - string data type the plus operator will
02:58 - be used in order to join the two strings
03:01 - so guys let us Define another string
03:03 - over here so let's say we provide const
03:05 - and then Str str1 it is equal to and
03:08 - this time we provide YouTube channel
03:10 - over here so we have YouTube channel as
03:13 - the string and before the YouTube key
03:15 - word we provideed the space character
03:17 - since we are going to join both the
03:19 - string that is Str Str and St str1 so
03:22 - guys what we will do is simply I'm going
03:24 - to comment out this line of code over
03:26 - here and then again we are going to
03:28 - provide the console. log statement this
03:31 - time we will say St Str and then we will
03:33 - use the plus operator in order to join
03:36 - both the strings so guys basically this
03:38 - is the concatenation of two strings
03:40 - meaning we are joining two strings with
03:42 - the help of the plus operator and then
03:44 - on the right hand side we provide Str
03:46 - str1 the number of variables is not
03:48 - limited to two over here you can use as
03:51 - many times the plus operator as you want
03:53 - based on the requirements and provide
03:55 - the variable names that are having the
03:57 - string values so guys over here we are
03:59 - joining the Str Str and St str1 let us
04:02 - see what will be the output so let me
04:03 - just save this file now and try running
04:06 - this code once again on the browser as
04:08 - you can see we are getting programming
04:09 - for beginners YouTube channel so guys
04:12 - basically we have joined these two
04:14 - string values over here with the help of
04:16 - the concatenation operator that is the
04:18 - plus operator over here and in this way
04:20 - you can join two or multiple number of
04:22 - string values now guys apart from this
04:24 - you can also provide the codes inside
04:27 - the codes in a string over here so
04:29 - basically we are using single code over
04:31 - here in order to enclose the entire
04:33 - string let us say we want to provide
04:35 - double codes inside this string which is
04:38 - enclosed with the help of the single
04:40 - code so let me just comment out this
04:42 - line of code over here so what we will
04:44 - do is let's say we provide programming
04:46 - for beginners and then over here we want
04:48 - to provide YouTube channel within the
04:51 - double codes inside the first string
04:53 - over here so simply we provide the
04:55 - double codes over here and then we
04:57 - provide YouTube channel as the string
04:59 - value so guys basically the entire
05:01 - string value is enclosed within the
05:03 - single code over here and this time we
05:05 - can use the double code since the main
05:07 - string is enclosed within the single
05:09 - code let me just save this file now and
05:11 - try running this code once again on the
05:13 - browser so we have not provided any log
05:15 - statement over here so I'll just
05:17 - uncomment this line of code so that we
05:19 - are able to see the value of the string
05:21 - variable so let me just run this code
05:23 - once again as you can see programming
05:25 - for beginners and then the YouTube
05:27 - channel is enclosed in between the
05:29 - Double C code and in this way you can
05:31 - provide the double code inside the
05:33 - single code now guys can you provide
05:35 - double code inside the double code no in
05:37 - this case so if you try to provide
05:39 - double codes as the main special
05:41 - character that is enclosing the entire
05:44 - string so basically as you can see we
05:45 - are getting the error over here so in
05:48 - this case you have to provide single
05:49 - code over here so basically instead of
05:52 - double code for the YouTube channel we
05:54 - are providing single code over here so
05:56 - this time instead of having double code
05:58 - for this YouTube channel we will will
05:59 - get the single codes so let me just save
06:01 - this file now and try running this code
06:03 - once again so as you can see we are
06:05 - getting programming for beginners and
06:07 - then single quote over here since we are
06:09 - using the double quote as the main
06:11 - special character to enclose the entire
06:14 - string value over here now guys apart
06:16 - from this you can also use the template
06:18 - strings with the help of the backt so
06:20 - when you're using the back te you can
06:22 - provide the single quote and double
06:24 - quote inside the string value over here
06:26 - so let us check that as well so guys
06:28 - over here what we will do is let us say
06:30 - we provide backt over here that is the
06:33 - starting and the ending backt and then
06:35 - we will say programming for beginners
06:39 - but guys over here we want the
06:40 - programming for beginners to be present
06:42 - inside the double code so simply we can
06:45 - provide the double code which will
06:46 - enclose the programming for beginner
06:48 - string over here and then we have the
06:50 - YouTube channel which must be present in
06:52 - between the single code so over here we
06:54 - provide two times single codes and then
06:56 - we provide YouTube channel over here so
06:59 - basically this backt which is enclosing
07:02 - the main string over here will help us
07:04 - in order to provide both that is double
07:07 - quote as well as the single code this
07:09 - time so let me just save this file now
07:11 - and try running this code once again
07:12 - over here so as you can see we are
07:14 - getting programming for beginners
07:16 - between the double codes and then inside
07:18 - the single code we are getting the
07:20 - YouTube channel over here so guys you
07:22 - can also use the template string over
07:24 - here which means by using the back tap
07:26 - you can represent the string value this
07:29 - back tap also helps you in order to
07:31 - include the value of the other variable
07:33 - as well so what we can do is let us say
07:35 - we provide certain number over here with
07:38 - the help of the X variable and let us
07:40 - say we provide the number as one in this
07:42 - case so guys basically we want to append
07:44 - this number that is one inside the
07:46 - strings so what we will do is
07:48 - programming for beginners YouTube
07:49 - channel and then after this we want to
07:51 - provide hyphen and then the value of
07:53 - this number so how do we provide the
07:55 - value of the X inside this particular
07:57 - string so basically since we are using
07:59 - back Teck over here simply we can use
08:02 - the dollar symbol and then inside the
08:04 - open and close curly braces we can use
08:06 - the name of the variable that is x in
08:09 - this case so guys basically this is
08:11 - going to print the value of the variable
08:13 - that is X so let me just save this file
08:15 - now and try running this code once again
08:17 - over here so as you can see programming
08:19 - for beginners YouTube channel and then
08:21 - we are getting the value that is one
08:23 - over here so guys in this way it becomes
08:25 - very important when you use back tap in
08:28 - order to represent the Str Str value now
08:30 - guys apart from this you can also find
08:32 - the length of the string by using the
08:34 - length property over here so basically
08:36 - what this length property will do is it
08:39 - is going to print the number of
08:41 - characters that are present inside a
08:43 - particular string so guys let me just
08:45 - change the string value over here to
08:47 - test in this case so basically it is
08:49 - having four characters over here I'll
08:51 - also remove this line of code since it
08:53 - is not required for now so guys
08:55 - basically we are printing the test
08:57 - string over here so let me just save
08:59 - this file now and try running this code
09:01 - once again so as you can see we are
09:02 - getting the value that is test now let's
09:04 - say we want to find the number of
09:06 - characters that are present inside this
09:08 - string value so what we have to do is we
09:10 - need to make use of this Str Str
09:12 - variable over here followed by Dot and
09:15 - then we have something called as length
09:16 - over here so guys basically this length
09:19 - property will help us in order to get
09:21 - the number of the characters that are
09:24 - present inside this particular string
09:26 - value so when we save this file now and
09:28 - try running this code once again over
09:29 - here as you can see we are getting
09:31 - number four as the length of the string
09:33 - so in this way you can get the number of
09:35 - characters that are present inside the
09:37 - string value let's say we provide more
09:39 - string value over here as the test data
09:42 - so as you can see now there are nine
09:44 - number of characters inside this
09:45 - particular string let us verify that
09:47 - with the help of this length property
09:49 - over here so when we run this code once
09:51 - again so as you can see we are getting 9
09:53 - as the length of this particular string
09:56 - variable now guys apart from this you
09:58 - can also use the Escape characters
10:00 - inside the string value so guys over
10:02 - here what we had seen previously is
10:05 - inside the double codes you cannot
10:07 - provide more double quotes over here so
10:09 - if we try to provide a double quote in
10:11 - this case so as you can see we are
10:13 - getting the error but let's say if you
10:15 - want to provide the double quat within
10:17 - this main double quat over here which is
10:19 - enclosing the entire string so what you
10:21 - can do is simply you can use the Escape
10:24 - character which means you need to
10:26 - provide an additional back slash
10:28 - character over here here before the
10:30 - special character that you have provided
10:32 - so guys this is nothing but the Escape
10:34 - character that will help you in order to
10:37 - print the special characters which
10:39 - cannot be printed normally so let me
10:41 - just run this code once again we will
10:43 - print the value of the string variable
10:45 - over here so when we see the output as
10:48 - you can see test and then followed by
10:51 - the double quote over here and then we
10:52 - have the data in this case similarly we
10:54 - can have other special characters as
10:56 - well so we have the single code over
10:58 - here so again again in between the test
11:00 - data there will be single code that will
11:02 - be printed over here let's say if you
11:04 - want to print a back slash character so
11:06 - simply you provide a back slash
11:08 - character once and then again you
11:10 - provide the backs slash character so the
11:12 - first back slash character is the escape
11:14 - character over here let me just save
11:16 - this file now and only once the back
11:18 - slash character will be visible over
11:20 - here which is the second back slash
11:21 - character in this case so guys in this
11:23 - way you can use the Escape characters as
11:25 - well we can also compare the strings as
11:28 - well so what will do is let's say we
11:30 - have the string character that is a over
11:33 - here and we want to see whether a is
11:35 - greater than another character that is B
11:37 - so guys over here we are using the two
11:39 - string values that is having this one
11:41 - character that is a and b over here so
11:44 - is a greater than b no in this case so
11:46 - let us see what will be the output so
11:48 - when we run this code over here as you
11:50 - can see we are getting false in this
11:52 - case but let us say we change the value
11:54 - of the left hand side string to C over
11:57 - here so is C greater than b yes in this
11:59 - case so let me just save this file now
12:01 - and try running this code so as you can
12:03 - see we are getting true as the output so
12:05 - guys we can use any of the comparison
12:07 - operators in order to compare the two
12:09 - string values as well now apart from
12:12 - this we can also access the string by
12:14 - using the open and close square brackets
12:16 - over here so guys let us say we have the
12:19 - string value that is test data and let's
12:21 - say we want to access the first
12:23 - character over here so we only want the
12:25 - first letter that is T to be printed on
12:28 - the console so so guys what we will do
12:30 - is simply we use the St Str that is the
12:32 - name of the variable and then inside the
12:35 - open and close square brackets this
12:37 - particular T is being represented by the
12:39 - zero index over here so the count starts
12:42 - from zero and then the next letter that
12:44 - is e is represented by one and then we
12:46 - have two which represents the S
12:48 - character and then we have 3 4 5 and so
12:51 - on simply we need to provide the index
12:53 - number that is zero over here so guys
12:55 - let me just save this file now and try
12:57 - running this code once again on the
12:58 - console so as you can see we are getting
13:01 - the first letter that is T over here in
13:03 - order to access the second letter that
13:05 - is e over here simply we need to change
13:07 - the index number to one so let me just
13:09 - save this file now and try running this
13:11 - code once again over here so as you can
13:13 - see we are getting e letter printed over
13:15 - here on the terminal now guys what will
13:17 - be the output if we provide St Str and
13:20 - Then followed by the index number that
13:22 - is five over here so comment in the
13:24 - comment section below what will be the
13:26 - output of this particular log statement
13:28 - when we have this string value that is
13:30 - test data over here let us see whether
13:32 - your answer is correct or not please
13:34 - make sure that you like this video so
13:36 - that it reaches to more people and
13:37 - subscribe to this channel so that you
13:39 - get the notifications on upcoming videos
13:41 - as well I'll see you in the next video
13:43 - in which we are going to see the data
13:45 - types in JavaScript so stay tuned

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see string in JavaScript so guys basically string is a text that can be assigned or stored inside the variable and this we are going to check with the help of examples as well so this is the syntax that you can define a particular string so as you can see we have used the const keyword over here followed by the name of the variable that is Str Str now guys this particular variable will be a string when you provide the value on the left hand side which is enclosed in between the double quote over here so as you can see this particular value that is programming for beginners is enclosed in between the double codes and that is why the data type of this particular variable will be string over here now guys you can either use the double codes or the single code or you can also use the back take so all these we are going to check with the help of examples as well so let us move to the vs code over here so first of all let us Define the variable by using the const keyword so let's say we provide the variable name as Str Str that is string over here equal to and then we need to provide the value inside the double codes over here so guys basically we provide the value that is programming for beginners that is the name of this YouTube channel that you should subscribe if you have not done so we have provided the value that is programming for beginners in between the double Cotes over here let us print the type of this particular string variable so simply we can use the type of operator over here and then followed by the name of the variable that is Str Str so guys basically this particular log statement will help us in order to print the data type of this particular variable so let me just save this file now and try running this code by using the node command on the terminal so we provide node followed by space character and then the name of the Javascript file that is test.js so when we press enter as you can see we are getting the string data type over here that's because we have provided the value in between the double code over here and simply in order to print the string what we can do is again we can provide the console. log statement and this time we will provide the name of the variable that is St Str so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here so as you can see the data type is string and then we are getting the value of the string that is programming for beginners over here instead of using the double codes simply we can use the single quote as well so instead of providing double quote we are providing single Cote so over here so when we run this code once again we are not going to see any change as far as the output is concerned that's because it is same whether you provide the double codes or the single code when you are defining the string value now guys apart from this you can also concatenate two string by using the plus operator over here when you're using numbers the plus operator is used in order to add two or multiple numbers but when you're using string data type the plus operator will be used in order to join the two strings so guys let us Define another string over here so let's say we provide const and then Str str1 it is equal to and this time we provide YouTube channel over here so we have YouTube channel as the string and before the YouTube key word we provideed the space character since we are going to join both the string that is Str Str and St str1 so guys what we will do is simply I'm going to comment out this line of code over here and then again we are going to provide the console. log statement this time we will say St Str and then we will use the plus operator in order to join both the strings so guys basically this is the concatenation of two strings meaning we are joining two strings with the help of the plus operator and then on the right hand side we provide Str str1 the number of variables is not limited to two over here you can use as many times the plus operator as you want based on the requirements and provide the variable names that are having the string values so guys over here we are joining the Str Str and St str1 let us see what will be the output so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again on the browser as you can see we are getting programming for beginners YouTube channel so guys basically we have joined these two string values over here with the help of the concatenation operator that is the plus operator over here and in this way you can join two or multiple number of string values now guys apart from this you can also provide the codes inside the codes in a string over here so basically we are using single code over here in order to enclose the entire string let us say we want to provide double codes inside this string which is enclosed with the help of the single code so let me just comment out this line of code over here so what we will do is let's say we provide programming for beginners and then over here we want to provide YouTube channel within the double codes inside the first string over here so simply we provide the double codes over here and then we provide YouTube channel as the string value so guys basically the entire string value is enclosed within the single code over here and this time we can use the double code since the main string is enclosed within the single code let me just save this file now and try running this code once again on the browser so we have not provided any log statement over here so I'll just uncomment this line of code so that we are able to see the value of the string variable so let me just run this code once again as you can see programming for beginners and then the YouTube channel is enclosed in between the Double C code and in this way you can provide the double code inside the single code now guys can you provide double code inside the double code no in this case so if you try to provide double codes as the main special character that is enclosing the entire string so basically as you can see we are getting the error over here so in this case you have to provide single code over here so basically instead of double code for the YouTube channel we are providing single code over here so this time instead of having double code for this YouTube channel we will will get the single codes so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see we are getting programming for beginners and then single quote over here since we are using the double quote as the main special character to enclose the entire string value over here now guys apart from this you can also use the template strings with the help of the backt so when you're using the back te you can provide the single quote and double quote inside the string value over here so let us check that as well so guys over here what we will do is let us say we provide backt over here that is the starting and the ending backt and then we will say programming for beginners but guys over here we want the programming for beginners to be present inside the double code so simply we can provide the double code which will enclose the programming for beginner string over here and then we have the YouTube channel which must be present in between the single code so over here we provide two times single codes and then we provide YouTube channel over here so basically this backt which is enclosing the main string over here will help us in order to provide both that is double quote as well as the single code this time so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here so as you can see we are getting programming for beginners between the double codes and then inside the single code we are getting the YouTube channel over here so guys you can also use the template string over here which means by using the back tap you can represent the string value this back tap also helps you in order to include the value of the other variable as well so what we can do is let us say we provide certain number over here with the help of the X variable and let us say we provide the number as one in this case so guys basically we want to append this number that is one inside the strings so what we will do is programming for beginners YouTube channel and then after this we want to provide hyphen and then the value of this number so how do we provide the value of the X inside this particular string so basically since we are using back Teck over here simply we can use the dollar symbol and then inside the open and close curly braces we can use the name of the variable that is x in this case so guys basically this is going to print the value of the variable that is X so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here so as you can see programming for beginners YouTube channel and then we are getting the value that is one over here so guys in this way it becomes very important when you use back tap in order to represent the Str Str value now guys apart from this you can also find the length of the string by using the length property over here so basically what this length property will do is it is going to print the number of characters that are present inside a particular string so guys let me just change the string value over here to test in this case so basically it is having four characters over here I'll also remove this line of code since it is not required for now so guys basically we are printing the test string over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see we are getting the value that is test now let's say we want to find the number of characters that are present inside this string value so what we have to do is we need to make use of this Str Str variable over here followed by Dot and then we have something called as length over here so guys basically this length property will help us in order to get the number of the characters that are present inside this particular string value so when we save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see we are getting number four as the length of the string so in this way you can get the number of characters that are present inside the string value let's say we provide more string value over here as the test data so as you can see now there are nine number of characters inside this particular string let us verify that with the help of this length property over here so when we run this code once again so as you can see we are getting 9 as the length of this particular string variable now guys apart from this you can also use the Escape characters inside the string value so guys over here what we had seen previously is inside the double codes you cannot provide more double quotes over here so if we try to provide a double quote in this case so as you can see we are getting the error but let's say if you want to provide the double quat within this main double quat over here which is enclosing the entire string so what you can do is simply you can use the Escape character which means you need to provide an additional back slash character over here here before the special character that you have provided so guys this is nothing but the Escape character that will help you in order to print the special characters which cannot be printed normally so let me just run this code once again we will print the value of the string variable over here so when we see the output as you can see test and then followed by the double quote over here and then we have the data in this case similarly we can have other special characters as well so we have the single code over here so again again in between the test data there will be single code that will be printed over here let's say if you want to print a back slash character so simply you provide a back slash character once and then again you provide the backs slash character so the first back slash character is the escape character over here let me just save this file now and only once the back slash character will be visible over here which is the second back slash character in this case so guys in this way you can use the Escape characters as well we can also compare the strings as well so what will do is let's say we have the string character that is a over here and we want to see whether a is greater than another character that is B so guys over here we are using the two string values that is having this one character that is a and b over here so is a greater than b no in this case so let us see what will be the output so when we run this code over here as you can see we are getting false in this case but let us say we change the value of the left hand side string to C over here so is C greater than b yes in this case so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting true as the output so guys we can use any of the comparison operators in order to compare the two string values as well now apart from this we can also access the string by using the open and close square brackets over here so guys let us say we have the string value that is test data and let's say we want to access the first character over here so we only want the first letter that is T to be printed on the console so so guys what we will do is simply we use the St Str that is the name of the variable and then inside the open and close square brackets this particular T is being represented by the zero index over here so the count starts from zero and then the next letter that is e is represented by one and then we have two which represents the S character and then we have 3 4 5 and so on simply we need to provide the index number that is zero over here so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code once again on the console so as you can see we are getting the first letter that is T over here in order to access the second letter that is e over here simply we need to change the index number to one so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here so as you can see we are getting e letter printed over here on the terminal now guys what will be the output if we provide St Str and Then followed by the index number that is five over here so comment in the comment section below what will be the output of this particular log statement when we have this string value that is test data over here let us see whether your answer is correct or not please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you
