With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see mask image property
00:02 - in CSS so guys basically the CSS mask
00:05 - image property specifies a mask layer
00:08 - image and this we are going to check
00:09 - with the help of examples as well the
00:11 - mask layer image can be a PNG image or
00:14 - an SVG image a CSS gradient or an SVG
00:18 - mask element so guys out of all these we
00:21 - are going to check the CSS gradient
00:23 - example over here in which case on top
00:25 - of the original image we are going to
00:28 - create a mask image over here now guys
00:30 - it is very important to note that most
00:32 - browsers only have partial support for
00:34 - CSS masking you will need to use the
00:37 - webkit preix in addition to the standard
00:40 - property in most of the browsers so this
00:42 - testing part you have to handle while
00:44 - you are implementing the mask image
00:46 - property based on your project
00:48 - requirements so guys let us move to the
00:50 - examples over here so in the vs code
00:52 - what we are going to do is we will
00:53 - remove the previous lines of code that
00:55 - we had written in the HTML and the CSS
00:58 - files over here now guys what we are
01:00 - going to do is we will simply create a
01:02 - diff tag with the class container over
01:04 - here and then after this we are going to
01:06 - create the IMG tag inside this diff tag
01:09 - over here and then we will set the
01:11 - sample image that we already have inside
01:14 - the directory where the HTML and the CSS
01:16 - files are present and then for the alt
01:18 - attribute we will set the text as test
01:21 - image now guys let me just save this
01:23 - file now and try reloading this page on
01:25 - the browser so as you can see this is
01:27 - the original image over here let us set
01:29 - the width and and height for this
01:30 - particular image so we will use the IMG
01:33 - tag over here and let's say we have the
01:35 - square image in this case so we will set
01:38 - the width as 300 pixels and also the
01:40 - height as 300 pixels over here so guys
01:43 - basically we have set the width and
01:45 - height of this image in this case let me
01:47 - just save this file now and try
01:49 - reloading this page once again on the
01:51 - browser as you can see this is the
01:52 - square image that is getting displayed
01:54 - now guys in order to display the mask
01:56 - image on top of this particular original
01:59 - image simp we can use the linear
02:01 - gradient or the radial gradient as well
02:04 - apart from the other images that you can
02:06 - set as the mask image so guys let us
02:08 - check the example of linear gradient
02:10 - first of all so inside the style. CSS
02:13 - file over here for the diff tag which is
02:15 - having the class container we are going
02:17 - to set the CSS property so guys over
02:19 - here we have the dot character followed
02:21 - by the class name and then the property
02:23 - that we are going to use is mask image
02:25 - over here and then we will set the value
02:28 - as linear gradient and then we need to
02:30 - provide the color so guys basically one
02:33 - side of the image need to be transparent
02:35 - in this case so what we will do is let
02:37 - us say we want the top side of the image
02:39 - to be transparent and the bottom side to
02:41 - be having the original colors so guys
02:44 - what we will do is first of all we will
02:46 - set the value as transparent in this
02:48 - case followed by comma and then we have
02:50 - the black color over here let me just
02:52 - save this file now and try reloading
02:54 - this page once again on the browser so
02:56 - as you can see some kind of transparency
02:58 - is added as a m over here on top of the
03:01 - original image so guys this is the
03:03 - functionality of the mask image CSS
03:05 - property it helps us in order to create
03:08 - a mask on top of the original image let
03:11 - us say we want this transparency at the
03:13 - bottom of the image so simply we need to
03:15 - revert the changes that first of all we
03:17 - need to set the color that is black over
03:19 - here and then after this the second
03:21 - parameter can be transparent in this
03:23 - case let me just save this file now and
03:25 - notice that the transparency is at the
03:27 - top right now but it will come at the
03:29 - bottom when we reload this page so when
03:31 - we reload this page as you can see at
03:33 - the bottom there is a transparency that
03:35 - is added to this particular original
03:37 - image with the help of the Mask layer
03:39 - now guys apart from this we can also set
03:41 - the radial gradient value for the mask
03:44 - image so let us check that as well so
03:46 - what we have to do is instead of having
03:48 - the linear gradient over here simply we
03:50 - will use the radial gradient and in this
03:53 - case let us provide the shape as Circle
03:56 - over here and then let us say we have
03:58 - the black portion of 50% and Then
04:01 - followed by the rgba component in which
04:04 - case we will set the alpha component
04:06 - over here so guys we have 0 0 and then 0
04:10 - once again for the RGB value and then we
04:12 - will have 0.5 over here and let's say we
04:15 - have the percentage as 50% in this case
04:18 - let me just save this file now and try
04:20 - reloading this page once again on the
04:22 - browser so as you can see this is the
04:24 - mask layer that can be displayed with
04:26 - the help of the radial gradient so guys
04:28 - over here we can decrease the percentage
04:30 - of the black component over here so
04:32 - let's say we set it as 30% and also we
04:35 - will increase the width of the image so
04:38 - let us say we set it to 500 pixels over
04:40 - here let me just save this file now and
04:42 - try reloading this page once again on
04:44 - the browser so to some extent we can see
04:46 - the radial gradient over here and then
04:48 - after setting the black component as 20%
04:51 - and rgba component to 10% over here we
04:54 - can see that there's a radial gradient
04:56 - as a mask layer on top of the original
04:59 - page and we can see this circle at the
05:01 - right side of the image so guys in this
05:03 - way you can provide the mask layer for
05:05 - any of the original images based on your
05:08 - project requirements so guys comment in
