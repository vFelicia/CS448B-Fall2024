00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to find the factorial of
00:06 - a number using for Loop so guys the
00:08 - factorial of a number is the product of
00:11 - all the integers starting from the
00:13 - number one up to that number which is
00:15 - entered by the user so let's say for
00:17 - example the factorial of the number that
00:20 - is 6 which is entered by the user it
00:22 - will be equal to 1 multiplied by 2
00:24 - multiplied by 3 multiplied by 4
00:26 - multiplied by 5 multiplied by 6 and the
00:29 - result will be equal to 720 which is the
00:32 - product of all these numbers over here
00:34 - and guys this is the way that we find
00:36 - the factorial of a number which will be
00:38 - entered by the user now guys the
00:40 - factorial is not defined for the
00:42 - negative numbers and if the number that
00:44 - is entered by the user is 0 then the
00:46 - factorial of 0 it will be equal to 1 and
00:49 - this is the denotion that we provide
00:50 - that is 0 factorial it is equal to one
00:53 - so guys let us write the Python program
00:55 - in order to find the factorial of the
00:57 - number that is entered by the user so
00:59 - guys the very first thing that we will
01:00 - be doing is we will be taking the input
01:02 - from the user inside this number
01:04 - variable and then over here we will use
01:07 - the input function and then we will say
01:09 - enter the number so that this is the
01:12 - instruction to the user in order to
01:14 - provide the number now guys we need to
01:16 - convert the string data type to the
01:18 - integer data type so we just prefix this
01:20 - integer function and we enclose this
01:22 - entire input function inside the int
01:25 - function now guys we can simply use the
01:27 - for Loop or else we can also use the
01:29 - recursive function so in this particular
01:31 - program we are going to use the for Loop
01:33 - in order to find the factorial of a
01:35 - number now guys since we have the number
01:37 - we can simply use the for Loop over here
01:39 - and before the for Loop what we can do
01:41 - is we can say that if this number is
01:44 - entered by the user if it is equal to 0
01:46 - then we can simply say that the
01:48 - factorial is 1 so right here we can
01:50 - simply say print statement and then we
01:53 - say factorial of entered number is 1 and
01:59 - then before this entered number what we
02:01 - will do is we will provide the number
02:03 - that is entered by the user so it will
02:05 - be 0 in this case so we say dot format
02:09 - and then we provide this variable that
02:10 - is number over here so we say number in
02:13 - this case so guys this condition will
02:15 - help us in order to know that the
02:17 - factorial of the number that is entered
02:19 - by the user if it is 0 then the
02:21 - factorial will be 1 but what if the
02:23 - number that is entered by the user is
02:25 - not 0 so over here we can come in the
02:28 - else part and then inside this else part
02:30 - we can simply have the for Loop and we
02:32 - can simply say it is I and then we say
02:35 - in range and the range it will go from 1
02:38 - up to the number plus one so we say
02:40 - comma and then number plus one now guys
02:43 - since we have to include this number
02:44 - that is entered by the user as well so
02:46 - we have to provide number plus one or
02:49 - else a functionality of the range is
02:51 - that in such a way that the second
02:52 - parameter which is entered over here it
02:55 - is not considered and that is the reason
02:56 - why we have to take an extra number and
02:59 - that is why we have done plus one over
03:00 - here if let's say the number that is
03:02 - entered by the user is 10 we have to go
03:04 - up to 10 and that is why we have to take
03:06 - the number up to 11 over here in order
03:08 - to include the number that is 10. so
03:10 - guys over here after the colon what we
03:12 - have to do is we have to find the
03:14 - factorial so before this what we will be
03:16 - doing is I have another variable that is
03:18 - factorial over here which will be
03:20 - initialized as 1. now guys the same
03:22 - thing we can do since a factorial is
03:24 - initialized as 1 over here instead of
03:25 - providing 1 in this case we can provide
03:27 - the open and close curly braces and
03:29 - after this number we can provide a comma
03:31 - and we can provide this variable that is
03:33 - factorial so it will say factorial of
03:35 - entered number that is 0 if the number
03:38 - that is entered by the user is 0 is this
03:40 - particular curly braces which is
03:42 - factorial which will be 1 in this case
03:44 - now guys after this for Loop what we
03:46 - will be doing is we can simply have
03:48 - factorial on the left hand side and then
03:50 - on the right hand side again we will
03:52 - have factorial and then multiplied by
03:54 - this item that is I over here which is
03:57 - ranging from 1 up to number plus one so
03:59 - guys initially what will happen is let's
04:01 - say if the number that is entered by the
04:03 - user is 4 so what will happen is 1 up to
04:07 - 5 this is the range so factorial is 1
04:10 - initially so 1 multiplied by 1 is 1 and
04:12 - then next time the I value will be 2 so
04:15 - 1 multiplied by 2 will be 2 so 2 will be
04:17 - stored in this factorial and then 2
04:19 - multiplied by the I value will be 3 so 2
04:22 - 3 is a 6 so factorial will be 6 right
04:25 - now and the next value of I will be 4 so
04:27 - 6 multiplied by 4 will be 24 and that
04:30 - will be stored in this factorial
04:31 - variable next time the is value will be
04:34 - 5 so it will be out of this range so the
04:36 - control flow will come out of this for
04:38 - Loop so what we have to do is after this
04:40 - for Loop we have to print the same thing
04:42 - again the same statement but this time
04:44 - the variable values will be different so
04:47 - by the factorial of enter number that is
04:49 - entered by the user is factorial the
04:52 - result will be stored in this factorial
04:53 - in this case so guys let me just save
04:55 - this file now enter running this code so
04:57 - as you can see user is being asked to
04:59 - enter the number number so let's say we
05:00 - provide the number 4 this time so when
05:03 - we press enter it says factorial of
05:05 - entered number that is 4 is 24. now guys
05:08 - let us take this example that is
05:10 - factorial of number 6 it is equal to 720
05:12 - so when we run this code once again over
05:15 - here and when we provide the number that
05:18 - is 6 when we press enter as you can see
05:20 - factorial of enter number 6 is 720 and
05:23 - this is how we have successfully written
05:25 - the Python program in order to find the
05:27 - factorial of the entire number let us
05:30 - run this code once again over here this
05:31 - time we will enter the number as 0 so
05:34 - what will be the factorial of number 0
05:36 - comment in the comment section below let
05:38 - us see whether your answer is correct or
05:40 - not so guys please make sure that you
05:41 - practice on your own so that on
05:43 - different inputs you get different
05:44 - output make sure that you like this
05:46 - video so that it reaches to more people
05:48 - and subscribe to this channel so that
05:50 - you get the notifications on upcoming
05:51 - videos as well the next video that we
05:53 - are going to talk about is Python
05:55 - program to find the factorial of a
05:57 - number but this time we will be using
05:59 - the recursive function so guys make sure
06:01 - that you watch this video as well so
06:03 - that you understand how recursive
06:04 - function Works in order to find the
06:06 - factorial of a number so stay tuned

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to find the factorial of a number using for Loop so guys the factorial of a number is the product of all the integers starting from the number one up to that number which is entered by the user so let's say for example the factorial of the number that is 6 which is entered by the user it will be equal to 1 multiplied by 2 multiplied by 3 multiplied by 4 multiplied by 5 multiplied by 6 and the result will be equal to 720 which is the product of all these numbers over here and guys this is the way that we find the factorial of a number which will be entered by the user now guys the factorial is not defined for the negative numbers and if the number that is entered by the user is 0 then the factorial of 0 it will be equal to 1 and this is the denotion that we provide that is 0 factorial it is equal to one so guys let us write the Python program in order to find the factorial of the number that is entered by the user so guys the very first thing that we will be doing is we will be taking the input from the user inside this number variable and then over here we will use the input function and then we will say enter the number so that this is the instruction to the user in order to provide the number now guys we need to convert the string data type to the integer data type so we just prefix this integer function and we enclose this entire input function inside the int function now guys we can simply use the for Loop or else we can also use the recursive function so in this particular program we are going to use the for Loop in order to find the factorial of a number now guys since we have the number we can simply use the for Loop over here and before the for Loop what we can do is we can say that if this number is entered by the user if it is equal to 0 then we can simply say that the factorial is 1 so right here we can simply say print statement and then we say factorial of entered number is 1 and then before this entered number what we will do is we will provide the number that is entered by the user so it will be 0 in this case so we say dot format and then we provide this variable that is number over here so we say number in this case so guys this condition will help us in order to know that the factorial of the number that is entered by the user if it is 0 then the factorial will be 1 but what if the number that is entered by the user is not 0 so over here we can come in the else part and then inside this else part we can simply have the for Loop and we can simply say it is I and then we say in range and the range it will go from 1 up to the number plus one so we say comma and then number plus one now guys since we have to include this number that is entered by the user as well so we have to provide number plus one or else a functionality of the range is that in such a way that the second parameter which is entered over here it is not considered and that is the reason why we have to take an extra number and that is why we have done plus one over here if let's say the number that is entered by the user is 10 we have to go up to 10 and that is why we have to take the number up to 11 over here in order to include the number that is 10. so guys over here after the colon what we have to do is we have to find the factorial so before this what we will be doing is I have another variable that is factorial over here which will be initialized as 1. now guys the same thing we can do since a factorial is initialized as 1 over here instead of providing 1 in this case we can provide the open and close curly braces and after this number we can provide a comma and we can provide this variable that is factorial so it will say factorial of entered number that is 0 if the number that is entered by the user is 0 is this particular curly braces which is factorial which will be 1 in this case now guys after this for Loop what we will be doing is we can simply have factorial on the left hand side and then on the right hand side again we will have factorial and then multiplied by this item that is I over here which is ranging from 1 up to number plus one so guys initially what will happen is let's say if the number that is entered by the user is 4 so what will happen is 1 up to 5 this is the range so factorial is 1 initially so 1 multiplied by 1 is 1 and then next time the I value will be 2 so 1 multiplied by 2 will be 2 so 2 will be stored in this factorial and then 2 multiplied by the I value will be 3 so 2 3 is a 6 so factorial will be 6 right now and the next value of I will be 4 so 6 multiplied by 4 will be 24 and that will be stored in this factorial variable next time the is value will be 5 so it will be out of this range so the control flow will come out of this for Loop so what we have to do is after this for Loop we have to print the same thing again the same statement but this time the variable values will be different so by the factorial of enter number that is entered by the user is factorial the result will be stored in this factorial in this case so guys let me just save this file now enter running this code so as you can see user is being asked to enter the number number so let's say we provide the number 4 this time so when we press enter it says factorial of entered number that is 4 is 24. now guys let us take this example that is factorial of number 6 it is equal to 720 so when we run this code once again over here and when we provide the number that is 6 when we press enter as you can see factorial of enter number 6 is 720 and this is how we have successfully written the Python program in order to find the factorial of the entire number let us run this code once again over here this time we will enter the number as 0 so what will be the factorial of number 0 comment in the comment section below let us see whether your answer is correct or not so guys please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different output make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is Python program to find the factorial of a number but this time we will be using the recursive function so
