00:00 - so now we will see text effects in CSS
00:02 - so guys basically we are going to learn
00:04 - various text effects properties in this
00:07 - particular video with the help of
00:08 - examples so let us move to the vs code
00:11 - over here and simply I'm going to remove
00:13 - the previous lines of code that we had
00:15 - written in the HTML and the style. CSS
00:17 - files now guys over here simply we are
00:19 - going to have the div tag in this case
00:22 - and inside the diff tag we are going to
00:24 - have certain randomly generated text so
00:27 - let's say we have just 10 words over
00:29 - here inside this particular diff tag so
00:31 - guys in this way we can have the Mt
00:33 - abbreviation that is LM followed by the
00:36 - number of words that you want to
00:37 - randomly generate so when we press enter
00:40 - as you can see 10 words are randomly
00:42 - generated over here using the lurm M
00:45 - abbreviation now guys let me just save
00:47 - this file now and try reloading this
00:48 - page once again on the browser so as you
00:50 - can see this is the simple text that is
00:52 - getting displayed inside the diff tag
00:55 - guys what we are going to do is we will
00:56 - provide certain CSS properties to this
00:59 - diff tag over here so let's say we have
01:01 - the 30% as the width for this particular
01:04 - diff tag out of the entire width of the
01:06 - screen guys apart from this we will also
01:08 - set the bord so let's say we have two
01:10 - pixels of solid border with the black
01:13 - color over here let me just save this
01:15 - file now and try reloading this page
01:17 - once again on the browser so as you can
01:19 - see we have the 30% width in this case
01:22 - for this particular diff tag and then
01:24 - apart from this the entire sentence is
01:26 - getting displayed in two lines over here
01:28 - now guys one of the important CSS
01:31 - properties as far as text effect is
01:33 - concerned is to use the widespace CSS
01:35 - property with the value that is no rap
01:38 - so guys in this case when you want the
01:40 - text to be displayed only on one line
01:43 - you can use this whes space CSS property
01:45 - so guys let us check this so what we are
01:47 - going to do is we are going to say white
01:50 - space CSS property and this time we are
01:53 - going to set the value as no R over here
01:55 - which means the entire content should be
01:58 - displayed on one line so let me just
02:00 - save this file now and try reloading
02:02 - this page once again on the browser so
02:04 - as you can see the entire content is
02:06 - getting displayed on one line over here
02:09 - with the help of the whitespace CSS
02:10 - property which is one of the important
02:13 - properties as far as text effects is
02:15 - concerned in CSS now guys apart from
02:17 - that if you notice that we have a issue
02:19 - now over here the text is going outside
02:22 - of the border so guys if you remember we
02:24 - have set the width of 30% in this case
02:27 - so the border is set over here as you
02:29 - can see on the right hand side and the
02:31 - text is going to the right of this
02:33 - particular border so guys what we can do
02:35 - in order to solve this issue so guys
02:37 - over here we have something called as
02:39 - overflow equal to Hidden so guys
02:41 - basically we can use the Overflow CSS
02:43 - property in this case in order to hide
02:46 - the text that is going outside of this
02:48 - particular border so guys let us check
02:50 - that as well so over here what we are
02:52 - going to do is Overflow CSS property is
02:55 - the one that we are going to use and
02:57 - simply we are going to use this value
02:59 - that is hidden in in this case so guys
03:00 - let me just save this file now so what
03:03 - this will do is it will hide the content
03:05 - that is going outside of the border of
03:07 - the HTML element on the right hand side
03:10 - so let me just reload this page once
03:12 - again on the browser so as you can see
03:14 - the content that was going outside of
03:16 - this particular border is Now hidden but
03:19 - guys as you can see we can still see
03:21 - that some word is continuing over here
03:23 - which which gives a sense of
03:24 - incompleteness so guys over here we have
03:27 - another CSS property that we can use so
03:29 - we have something called as text
03:31 - overflow for which the default value is
03:34 - the clip value so guys let us check this
03:36 - as well so when we use text overflow
03:38 - property as you can see we have the list
03:40 - of values which includes clip value and
03:43 - the ellipses value so let us first check
03:45 - the clip value over here let me just
03:47 - save this file now and this is the
03:49 - default value that was set and that is
03:51 - why we won't see any change over here
03:53 - right now so let me reload this page
03:55 - once again on the browser so there is no
03:57 - change that is getting reflected over
03:59 - here here right now but guys the other
04:01 - value that we have apart from The Click
04:03 - value is the ellipses value over here so
04:06 - let us check that as well what will
04:08 - happen so let me just save this file now
04:09 - and try reloading this page once again
04:11 - on the browser so as you can see we have
04:14 - these three dots now getting displayed
04:16 - over here which is due to this alpis
04:18 - value for the text overflow CSS property
04:21 - so guys in this way if you want to show
04:23 - the user that there is certain text
04:25 - after this particular border but you
04:28 - want to restrict that text before that
04:30 - border so basically you can use this
04:32 - Ellipsis value for the text overflow
04:34 - property and guys apart from this you
04:36 - can also display the remaining text on
04:38 - over so what we have to do is we need to
04:41 - change the Overflow property to visible
04:43 - value when the user gets the mouse on
04:46 - that particular diff tag so guys let us
04:48 - check that as well what we want to do is
04:50 - when the text overflow property is set
04:53 - to Ellipsis that we have done in this
04:55 - particular case and when the user gets
04:57 - the cursor on this particular diff tag
05:00 - we want the remaining text to be
05:02 - displayed outside of this particular
05:03 - border so guys let us check that as well
05:06 - what we have to do is simply we will
05:08 - Define the diff tag followed by the
05:10 - pseudo class that is over in this case
05:12 - and then guys whatever CSS property that
05:14 - we apply over here will get implemented
05:17 - when the user gets the cursor on this
05:19 - particular diff tag so what we want to
05:21 - do is we want to change the Overflow CSS
05:24 - property to visible in this case so
05:27 - basically when we change the Overflow
05:29 - property to visible then the remaining
05:31 - text that we had hidden by using this
05:34 - particular overflow property will be now
05:36 - visible so guys let me just save this
05:38 - file now and try reloading this page
05:40 - once again on the browser notice that by
05:42 - default we don't have any text that is
05:45 - getting displayed after this particular
05:47 - border but when user gets the cursor on
05:49 - this diff tag as you can see the
05:51 - remaining text is now getting displayed
05:53 - over here and when the user takes away
05:55 - the cursor from the diff tag the
05:57 - remaining text is getting hidden with
05:59 - the the help of overflow equal to Hidden
06:02 - and text overflow equal to Ellipsis
06:04 - values so guys in this way you can use
06:06 - the different text effects CSS
06:08 - properties that we have discussed so far
06:10 - apart from this we also have something
06:12 - called as word r over here which can be
06:14 - said to break word when there is a very
06:16 - large word which is going outside of the
06:19 - border so guys let us check that as well
06:21 - so what we want to do is I'll simply
06:23 - remove these CSS properties and simply
06:26 - we are going to see the default behavior
06:28 - of the diff tag which is is having the
06:30 - width of 30% and the Border as 2 pixels
06:33 - with the color black so guys let me just
06:35 - reload this page once again so as you
06:37 - can see this is the diff tag that is
06:39 - getting displayed over here now guys let
06:41 - us say this particular word is very long
06:44 - and while displaying it on the browser
06:46 - it is going outside of the border so
06:48 - guys what we have to do is simply I'm
06:50 - going to provide certain letters after
06:53 - this particular word over here so we are
06:55 - going to offend certain random letters
06:57 - in this case so guys basically this is a
07:00 - very long word that is appearing over
07:02 - here which is longer than the width of
07:04 - the div element so guys let me just save
07:07 - this file now and try reloading this
07:09 - page once again on the browser so notice
07:11 - that by default the browser will try to
07:13 - get the words on the next line if we
07:16 - have the limited width that is provided
07:18 - to the HTML element but guys in this
07:20 - case when a specific word is very long
07:23 - and it is going outside of the border of
07:25 - the HTML element then in that case what
07:28 - we have to do is simply we can use use
07:29 - the word r CSS property so guys over
07:32 - here inside the style. CSS file simply
07:35 - we are going to say word r CSS property
07:38 - and we will say break word so guys what
07:40 - this particular value will do is it will
07:42 - break the word which is very long over
07:44 - here that is going outside of the border
07:46 - and continue that word on the next line
07:49 - in such a way that the entire content
07:51 - should be within this particular width
07:53 - of the HTML element so guys let me just
07:56 - save this file now and try reloading
07:58 - this page once again on the browser
07:59 - so as you can see the remaining letters
08:02 - inside this word is shifted to the next
08:04 - line over here in such a way that the
08:06 - content of this div tag is within the
08:09 - border of this particular HTML element
08:11 - so guys in this way you can use the
08:13 - different CSS properties as far as the
08:16 - text effects are concerned in CSS during
08:18 - your project implementation so guys

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see text effects in CSS so guys basically we are going to learn various text effects properties in this particular video with the help of examples so let us move to the vs code over here and simply I'm going to remove the previous lines of code that we had written in the HTML and the style. CSS files now guys over here simply we are going to have the div tag in this case and inside the diff tag we are going to have certain randomly generated text so let's say we have just 10 words over here inside this particular diff tag so guys in this way we can have the Mt abbreviation that is LM followed by the number of words that you want to randomly generate so when we press enter as you can see 10 words are randomly generated over here using the lurm M abbreviation now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is the simple text that is getting displayed inside the diff tag guys what we are going to do is we will provide certain CSS properties to this diff tag over here so let's say we have the 30% as the width for this particular diff tag out of the entire width of the screen guys apart from this we will also set the bord so let's say we have two pixels of solid border with the black color over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the 30% width in this case for this particular diff tag and then apart from this the entire sentence is getting displayed in two lines over here now guys one of the important CSS properties as far as text effect is concerned is to use the widespace CSS property with the value that is no rap so guys in this case when you want the text to be displayed only on one line you can use this whes space CSS property so guys let us check this so what we are going to do is we are going to say white space CSS property and this time we are going to set the value as no R over here which means the entire content should be displayed on one line so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the entire content is getting displayed on one line over here with the help of the whitespace CSS property which is one of the important properties as far as text effects is concerned in CSS now guys apart from that if you notice that we have a issue now over here the text is going outside of the border so guys if you remember we have set the width of 30% in this case so the border is set over here as you can see on the right hand side and the text is going to the right of this particular border so guys what we can do in order to solve this issue so guys over here we have something called as overflow equal to Hidden so guys basically we can use the Overflow CSS property in this case in order to hide the text that is going outside of this particular border so guys let us check that as well so over here what we are going to do is Overflow CSS property is the one that we are going to use and simply we are going to use this value that is hidden in in this case so guys let me just save this file now so what this will do is it will hide the content that is going outside of the border of the HTML element on the right hand side so let me just reload this page once again on the browser so as you can see the content that was going outside of this particular border is Now hidden but guys as you can see we can still see that some word is continuing over here which which gives a sense of incompleteness so guys over here we have another CSS property that we can use so we have something called as text overflow for which the default value is the clip value so guys let us check this as well so when we use text overflow property as you can see we have the list of values which includes clip value and the ellipses value so let us first check the clip value over here let me just save this file now and this is the default value that was set and that is why we won't see any change over here right now so let me reload this page once again on the browser so there is no change that is getting reflected over here here right now but guys the other value that we have apart from The Click value is the ellipses value over here so let us check that as well what will happen so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have these three dots now getting displayed over here which is due to this alpis value for the text overflow CSS property so guys in this way if you want to show the user that there is certain text after this particular border but you want to restrict that text before that border so basically you can use this Ellipsis value for the text overflow property and guys apart from this you can also display the remaining text on over so what we have to do is we need to change the Overflow property to visible value when the user gets the mouse on that particular diff tag so guys let us check that as well what we want to do is when the text overflow property is set to Ellipsis that we have done in this particular case and when the user gets the cursor on this particular diff tag we want the remaining text to be displayed outside of this particular border so guys let us check that as well what we have to do is simply we will Define the diff tag followed by the pseudo class that is over in this case and then guys whatever CSS property that we apply over here will get implemented when the user gets the cursor on this particular diff tag so what we want to do is we want to change the Overflow CSS property to visible in this case so basically when we change the Overflow property to visible then the remaining text that we had hidden by using this particular overflow property will be now visible so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser notice that by default we don't have any text that is getting displayed after this particular border but when user gets the cursor on this diff tag as you can see the remaining text is now getting displayed over here and when the user takes away the cursor from the diff tag the remaining text is getting hidden with the the help of overflow equal to Hidden and text overflow equal to Ellipsis values so guys in this way you can use the different text effects CSS properties that we have discussed so far apart from this we also have something called as word r over here which can be said to break word when there is a very large word which is going outside of the border so guys let us check that as well so what we want to do is I'll simply remove these CSS properties and simply we are going to see the default behavior of the diff tag which is is having the width of 30% and the Border as 2 pixels with the color black so guys let me just reload this page once again so as you can see this is the diff tag that is getting displayed over here now guys let us say this particular word is very long and while displaying it on the browser it is going outside of the border so guys what we have to do is simply I'm going to provide certain letters after this particular word over here so we are going to offend certain random letters in this case so guys basically this is a very long word that is appearing over here which is longer than the width of the div element so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so notice that by default the browser will try to get the words on the next line if we have the limited width that is provided to the HTML element but guys in this case when a specific word is very long and it is going outside of the border of the HTML element then in that case what we have to do is simply we can use use the word r CSS property so guys over here inside the style. CSS file simply we are going to say word r CSS property and we will say break word so guys what this particular value will do is it will break the word which is very long over here that is going outside of the border and continue that word on the next line in such a way that the entire content should be within this particular width of the HTML element so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the remaining letters inside this word is shifted to the next line over here in such a way that the content of this div tag is within the border of this particular HTML element so guys in this way you can use the different CSS properties as far as the text effects are concerned in CSS during your project implementation so guys comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is 2D transform property in CSS so stay tuned
