00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:04 - Python program to print Floyd's triangle
00:06 - so guys this is the Floyd's triangle
00:08 - pattern as you can see so we have four
00:11 - number of rows over here and in the
00:13 - first row we have the number one in the
00:15 - second row we have numbers two and then
00:17 - three and then in the third row we have
00:19 - three numbers four five six in the
00:22 - fourth row we have seven eight nine ten
00:24 - so guys basically with the increase in
00:27 - the number of rows there's a increase in
00:29 - the number of elements that are present
00:31 - inside each row over here and also there
00:34 - is a global number that is being
00:35 - displayed which is getting incremented
00:38 - after each printing over here so guys
00:40 - how the algorithm for pattern programs
00:42 - work so basically each pattern program
00:44 - has two or more than two Loops the
00:46 - number of the loop depends on the
00:48 - complexity of the pattern or the logic
00:50 - basically for this particular pattern we
00:52 - will have only two for Loops over here
00:54 - and then the first for Loop will work
00:57 - for the row the second for Loop that is
00:59 - the nested follow will work for the
01:01 - column so guys let us check this with
01:03 - the help of Python program how we can
01:05 - print the Floyd's triangle using the vs
01:07 - code over here so guys the very first
01:09 - thing that we will be doing is we will
01:11 - ask the user to enter the number of rows
01:13 - which will be converted to the integer
01:16 - over here so inside this end function we
01:18 - have the input function and we will ask
01:21 - the user to enter number of rows and
01:26 - then colon so guys once the user enters
01:29 - the number of rows it will be of the
01:30 - string data type so this end function
01:33 - will help us in order to convert that
01:35 - string to the integer which will be
01:37 - stored in this rows variable over here
01:39 - now guys simply we can have for Loop
01:41 - over here so for I in range now this
01:45 - range it will go from 0 up to the number
01:48 - of rows that is entered by the user
01:50 - because there is many number of rows we
01:52 - need to print as you can see in this
01:54 - example so guys over here the range is
01:56 - going from 0 up to rows and then inside
01:59 - this we will have the the nested for
02:01 - Loop so over here for J and then again
02:04 - we have the range function over here it
02:07 - will go from 0 up to the value of I so
02:10 - guys initially the value of I is 0 so it
02:13 - will go from 0 up to I plus 1 over here
02:16 - that's because the second parameter is
02:18 - not included when we use the range
02:19 - function so basically in the first
02:22 - iteration it will go from 0 up to I
02:24 - value is 0 so 0 plus 1 is 1 so 0 comma 1
02:28 - which means only once the control flow
02:30 - will go inside this for Loop over here
02:33 - which is the nested for Loop that is the
02:35 - inner for low and then after this colon
02:38 - what we have to do is we have to print
02:39 - this number one over here so guys what
02:42 - we can do is before this outer for Loop
02:44 - we can have the number variables over
02:46 - here so number initially the value is 1
02:49 - in this case and then the same number we
02:51 - need to print so one here we will say
02:53 - print and then we will say this number
02:56 - now it should not go to the next line
02:58 - until the the control flow is printing
03:01 - inside this inner for Loop so over here
03:04 - we will use the end parameter and then
03:06 - we will separate the numbers using the
03:08 - space character over here and then guys
03:10 - after this print statement also the
03:12 - number needs to be incremented by 1
03:14 - because next time the number is getting
03:17 - printed the new number is 2 and then we
03:20 - have 3 and then we have 4 5 6 and so on
03:23 - every time after the printing of the
03:25 - previous number the next number will be
03:27 - incremented by one so over here we will
03:29 - simply say number plus it is equal to 1
03:32 - which means we are incrementing the
03:34 - value of number by 1 over here now guys
03:37 - after this inner for Loop what we can do
03:39 - is we have to come to the next line in
03:41 - order to print the remaining number of
03:43 - rows over here so simply we can provide
03:45 - the print function so that the control
03:47 - flow comes to the next line in this case
03:49 - so guys this is the program that will
03:51 - help us in order to print the fluids
03:54 - triangle based on the number of rows
03:56 - that is entered by the user so guys let
03:58 - us check this I'll save this file I love
04:00 - and try running this code so as you can
04:02 - see user is being asked to enter the
04:04 - number of rows so let us provide 4 as
04:06 - the number of rows initially when we
04:08 - press enter as you can see we have got
04:10 - the fluids triangle over here it says 1
04:13 - and then 2 3 and then on the next line
04:15 - we have four five six and then we have 7
04:18 - 8 9 10. so guys this is the fluids
04:20 - triangle that we were expecting to be
04:22 - printed on the console let me just run
04:24 - this code once again and this time we
04:26 - will provide 10 number of rows over here
04:28 - when we press enter as you can see we
04:31 - have got 10 number of rows over here and
04:33 - there's a beautiful Floyd's triangle
04:35 - that can be seen on the terminal each
04:37 - time the number is getting incremented
04:39 - by 1 and then accordingly we reach the
04:42 - number to 55 which is the last element
04:44 - of the last row over here which is
04:46 - having 10 number of columns in this case
04:49 - so guys this is the way that we can
04:50 - easily write a Python program to print
04:52 - the Floyd triangle please make sure that
04:54 - you practice on your own so that on
04:56 - different inputs you have different
04:57 - outputs make sure that you like this
04:59 - video so that it reaches to more people
05:01 - and subscribe to the channel so that you
05:03 - get the notifications on upcoming videos
05:05 - as well the next video that we are going
05:07 - to talk about is Python program to merge
05:10 - two dictionaries so stay tuned

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to print Floyd's triangle so guys this is the Floyd's triangle pattern as you can see so we have four number of rows over here and in the first row we have the number one in the second row we have numbers two and then three and then in the third row we have three numbers four five six in the fourth row we have seven eight nine ten so guys basically with the increase in the number of rows there's a increase in the number of elements that are present inside each row over here and also there is a global number that is being displayed which is getting incremented after each printing over here so guys how the algorithm for pattern programs work so basically each pattern program has two or more than two Loops the number of the loop depends on the complexity of the pattern or the logic basically for this particular pattern we will have only two for Loops over here and then the first for Loop will work for the row the second for Loop that is the nested follow will work for the column so guys let us check this with the help of Python program how we can print the Floyd's triangle using the vs code over here so guys the very first thing that we will be doing is we will ask the user to enter the number of rows which will be converted to the integer over here so inside this end function we have the input function and we will ask the user to enter number of rows and then colon so guys once the user enters the number of rows it will be of the string data type so this end function will help us in order to convert that string to the integer which will be stored in this rows variable over here now guys simply we can have for Loop over here so for I in range now this range it will go from 0 up to the number of rows that is entered by the user because there is many number of rows we need to print as you can see in this example so guys over here the range is going from 0 up to rows and then inside this we will have the the nested for Loop so over here for J and then again we have the range function over here it will go from 0 up to the value of I so guys initially the value of I is 0 so it will go from 0 up to I plus 1 over here that's because the second parameter is not included when we use the range function so basically in the first iteration it will go from 0 up to I value is 0 so 0 plus 1 is 1 so 0 comma 1 which means only once the control flow will go inside this for Loop over here which is the nested for Loop that is the inner for low and then after this colon what we have to do is we have to print this number one over here so guys what we can do is before this outer for Loop we can have the number variables over here so number initially the value is 1 in this case and then the same number we need to print so one here we will say print and then we will say this number now it should not go to the next line until the the control flow is printing inside this inner for Loop so over here we will use the end parameter and then we will separate the numbers using the space character over here and then guys after this print statement also the number needs to be incremented by 1 because next time the number is getting printed the new number is 2 and then we have 3 and then we have 4 5 6 and so on every time after the printing of the previous number the next number will be incremented by one so over here we will simply say number plus it is equal to 1 which means we are incrementing the value of number by 1 over here now guys after this inner for Loop what we can do is we have to come to the next line in order to print the remaining number of rows over here so simply we can provide the print function so that the control flow comes to the next line
