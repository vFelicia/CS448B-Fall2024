With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see switch statement in
00:02 - JavaScript so guys basically the switch
00:04 - statement is used in order to perform
00:07 - the different actions based on the
00:09 - different conditions over here and
00:11 - instead of using the if else conditional
00:13 - statements that we had seen previously
00:15 - you can also use the switch statement if
00:17 - you have multiple different actions to
00:20 - be performed based on the Expressions
00:22 - value so guys over here this is the
00:24 - syntax that you can use first of all you
00:26 - have to use the switch keyword over here
00:28 - and then inside the open and close
00:30 - parenthesis you need to provide the
00:32 - expression it can be a Boolean value
00:34 - over here or a simple number as well
00:36 - that is being passed to the switch
00:38 - statement in this case this expression
00:40 - can be any number over here or the
00:42 - string as well and based on the value of
00:44 - this particular expression the control
00:46 - flow will try to match the number or the
00:49 - string over here inside the block of
00:51 - code so guys over here if this
00:53 - particular expression is equal to X so
00:55 - basically the case keyword is used
00:57 - followed by the value that is X over
00:59 - here so if the expression is equal to X
01:02 - so this block of code that is matching
01:04 - the case X over here will be getting
01:06 - executed so basically this code block
01:08 - will be executed after which we have to
01:10 - provide the breake statement so that the
01:12 - control flow comes out of the switch
01:14 - statement over here and then if the
01:16 - expression is equal to Y so basically
01:19 - the control flow will come over here it
01:21 - will check that Y is not equal to X this
01:23 - time but the next case that is case y
01:26 - will get match over here and then this
01:28 - particular code block will be EXE
01:29 - execute it and then we have the break
01:31 - statement once again and then guys after
01:33 - this in the end we should also have the
01:35 - default case over here which will help
01:37 - us in order to execute this code block
01:40 - when there were no matches for these
01:42 - particular cases inside the switch
01:44 - statement so guys let us check the
01:46 - working of the switch statement in
01:47 - JavaScript over here let me just remove
01:50 - the previous lines of code that we had
01:51 - written in the vs code so over here what
01:54 - we will do is let us say we provide the
01:56 - variable name that is option in this
01:58 - case and we provide the value as one
02:00 - over here now guys after this we will
02:02 - provide the switch statement over here
02:04 - so we have the switch keyword and Then
02:06 - followed by open and close curly braces
02:08 - and this time we are passing the
02:10 - variable name that is option and then
02:12 - after this we have the open and close
02:14 - curly braces now guys inside the switch
02:16 - statement that is inside the curly
02:18 - braces we need to Define different cases
02:20 - so let's say we have the first case over
02:22 - here we use the case keyword followed by
02:24 - the space character and then what kind
02:27 - of values can be present inside this
02:29 - option so we have the very first option
02:31 - that is zero in this case and then after
02:33 - the colon we have to provide the block
02:35 - of code over here so simply we are going
02:38 - to provide the console.log statement
02:40 - this time and then we will say option
02:42 - zero is selected so guys basically we
02:45 - have started the options from the zero
02:47 - number over here and then after this
02:49 - console.log statement you can have more
02:51 - number of statements over here after
02:53 - which you need to provide the breake
02:55 - statement so guys basically this is very
02:57 - important for the control flow to come
02:59 - out of of the switch statement so over
03:01 - here after the break statement we will
03:03 - Define another case so let us say we
03:05 - move to the case one this time and
03:07 - simply we will provide the console. log
03:10 - statement once again and this time we
03:12 - will say option one is selected over
03:14 - here and then again we will provide the
03:16 - break statement now guys similarly I'm
03:19 - going to copy paste this line of code
03:20 - over here and again we are going to
03:22 - provide case two this time and then we
03:24 - will say option two is selected so guys
03:26 - basically we have defined a different
03:28 - options over here that is case Zer case
03:31 - 1 and then case 2 and based on the value
03:33 - inside this particular option the
03:35 - console. log statement will be printed
03:37 - over here now guys in the end what we
03:39 - will do is let us say the option value
03:41 - is some other value apart from this 0 1
03:44 - and two numbers that we have provided so
03:47 - simply we are going to provide the
03:49 - default keyword over here in which case
03:51 - whatever other values that are provided
03:53 - to the option variable will get match
03:56 - with the default case over here since it
03:58 - is not matching with the other case that
04:00 - we have already defined so guys over
04:02 - here again we are going to provide the
04:03 - console.log statement and this time we
04:06 - will say some other option was selected
04:09 - so guys basically this will tell the
04:11 - user that some other option was selected
04:13 - apart from option zero option one and
04:16 - option two in this case and then guys
04:18 - after the default case it is not
04:20 - necessary to provide the break statement
04:21 - over here that's because that is the
04:23 - last statement inside the switch
04:25 - statement that we have already defined
04:27 - so guys let us see what will be the
04:28 - output of the this particular switch
04:30 - statement that we have defined over here
04:32 - in JavaScript so let me just save this
04:34 - file now and try running this code that
04:36 - is test.js file in this case so as you
04:38 - can see option one is selected is
04:40 - getting printed that's because option
04:42 - value is one over here and when the
04:44 - control flow comes inside the switch
04:46 - statement in this case first of all case
04:48 - z is getting checked so is option equal
04:50 - to zero no in this case so the control
04:53 - flow goes to the next case that is case
04:55 - one so is option equal to one this time
04:57 - yes in this case so basically option one
05:00 - is selected is getting printed over here
05:02 - similarly if the option is zero then
05:04 - this particular statement will be
05:06 - printed so guys let us check that as
05:07 - well so when we set the value of option
05:09 - as zero over here at the start of this
05:12 - particular program so when we save this
05:13 - file now and try running this code once
05:16 - again over here as you can see option
05:17 - zero is selected is getting printed over
05:20 - here similarly in order to print this
05:22 - option two is selected we have to set
05:24 - the option value as two over here and
05:27 - when we run this code once again you can
05:29 - see that option two is selected is
05:31 - getting printed over here and what if we
05:33 - provide the option equal to three value
05:35 - so let us see what will be the answer
05:37 - basically none of the cases will get
05:39 - mashed over here and finally the control
05:41 - flow will come to the default case in
05:43 - this case and basically this is the
05:45 - statement that must be printed so let me
05:47 - just save this file now and try running
05:49 - this code as you can see some other
05:51 - option was selected is getting printed
05:53 - over here so guys in this way the switch
05:55 - statement works you can also provide any
05:57 - of the string values as well to the
05:59 - option varable table and the same string
06:01 - values must be provided for these cases
06:03 - in order for them to match when the
06:05 - control flow is checking the values now
06:08 - guys apart from this not only the
06:09 - variable names over here but you can
06:11 - also provide the expression so let us
06:13 - say we have provided the option is equal
06:15 - to three and we do option minus one over
06:17 - here this time so basically what is
06:19 - getting passed to the switch statement
06:21 - over here option minus one which means 3
06:24 - - 1 it is equal to 2 so basically case
06:26 - is equal to 2 this particular line of
06:29 - code should get printed over here let me
06:31 - just save this file now and try running
06:32 - this code once again so as you can see
06:34 - option two is selected is getting
06:36 - printed over here now guys very
06:38 - important thing what happens if we don't
06:40 - provide the break statement over here so
06:41 - I have commented this particular break
06:43 - statement let us see what will be the
06:45 - output so when we save this file now and
06:47 - try running this code once again you can
06:49 - see that option two is selected is
06:51 - getting printed which is correct over
06:52 - here but the control flow after printing
06:55 - this particular statement is not going
06:57 - out of the switch statement this time
06:58 - and it is print printing the default
07:00 - case as well you can see that some other
07:02 - option was selected is also getting
07:04 - printed so guys for this reason it is
07:06 - very important that you provide the
07:08 - break keyword over here after each and
07:10 - every case and you can ignore the break
07:12 - statement for the last case that is the
07:14 - default case that's because that is the
07:16 - last statement to be checked over here
07:18 - after which we don't have any other
07:20 - cases to be checked so guys always
07:21 - remember to provide the break statement
07:23 - after each and every case that you have
07:25 - provided inside the switch statement and
07:28 - when we provide option my - 2 over here
07:30 - when the value of option is equal to 3
07:33 - the option will be equal to 1 so what
07:35 - will be the output in this case comment
07:37 - in the comment section below let us see

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see switch statement in JavaScript so guys basically the switch statement is used in order to perform the different actions based on the different conditions over here and instead of using the if else conditional statements that we had seen previously you can also use the switch statement if you have multiple different actions to be performed based on the Expressions value so guys over here this is the syntax that you can use first of all you have to use the switch keyword over here and then inside the open and close parenthesis you need to provide the expression it can be a Boolean value over here or a simple number as well that is being passed to the switch statement in this case this expression can be any number over here or the string as well and based on the value of this particular expression the control flow will try to match the number or the string over here inside the block of code so guys over here if this particular expression is equal to X so basically the case keyword is used followed by the value that is X over here so if the expression is equal to X so this block of code that is matching the case X over here will be getting executed so basically this code block will be executed after which we have to provide the breake statement so that the control flow comes out of the switch statement over here and then if the expression is equal to Y so basically the control flow will come over here it will check that Y is not equal to X this time but the next case that is case y will get match over here and then this particular code block will be EXE execute it and then we have the break statement once again and then guys after this in the end we should also have the default case over here which will help us in order to execute this code block when there were no matches for these particular cases inside the switch statement so guys let us check the working of the switch statement in JavaScript over here let me just remove the previous lines of code that we had written in the vs code so over here what we will do is let us say we provide the variable name that is option in this case and we provide the value as one over here now guys after this we will provide the switch statement over here so we have the switch keyword and Then followed by open and close curly braces and this time we are passing the variable name that is option and then after this we have the open and close curly braces now guys inside the switch statement that is inside the curly braces we need to Define different cases so let's say we have the first case over here we use the case keyword followed by the space character and then what kind of values can be present inside this option so we have the very first option that is zero in this case and then after the colon we have to provide the block of code over here so simply we are going to provide the console.log statement this time and then we will say option zero is selected so guys basically we have started the options from the zero number over here and then after this console.log statement you can have more number of statements over here after which you need to provide the breake statement so guys basically this is very important for the control flow to come out of of the switch statement so over here after the break statement we will Define another case so let us say we move to the case one this time and simply we will provide the console. log statement once again and this time we will say option one is selected over here and then again we will provide the break statement now guys similarly I'm going to copy paste this line of code over here and again we are going to provide case two this time and then we will say option two is selected so guys basically we have defined a different options over here that is case Zer case 1 and then case 2 and based on the value inside this particular option the console. log statement will be printed over here now guys in the end what we will do is let us say the option value is some other value apart from this 0 1 and two numbers that we have provided so simply we are going to provide the default keyword over here in which case whatever other values that are provided to the option variable will get match with the default case over here since it is not matching with the other case that we have already defined so guys over here again we are going to provide the console.log statement and this time we will say some other option was selected so guys basically this will tell the user that some other option was selected apart from option zero option one and option two in this case and then guys after the default case it is not necessary to provide the break statement over here that's because that is the last statement inside the switch statement that we have already defined so guys let us see what will be the output of the this particular switch statement that we have defined over here in JavaScript so let me just save this file now and try running this code that is test.js file in this case so as you can see option one is selected is getting printed that's because option value is one over here and when the control flow comes inside the switch statement in this case first of all case z is getting checked so is option equal to zero no in this case so the control flow goes to the next case that is case one so is option equal to one this time yes in this case so basically option one is selected is getting printed over here similarly if the option is zero then this particular statement will be printed so guys let us check that as well so when we set the value of option as zero over here at the start of this particular program so when we save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see option zero is selected is getting printed over here similarly in order to print this option two is selected we have to set the option value as two over here and when we run this code once again you can see that option two is selected is getting printed over here and what if we provide the option equal to three value so let us see what will be the answer basically none of the cases will get mashed over here and finally the control flow will come to the default case in this case and basically this is the statement that must be printed so let me just save this file now and try running this code as you can see some other option was selected is getting printed over here so guys in this way the switch statement works you can also provide any of the string values as well to the option varable table and the same string values must be provided for these cases in order for them to match when the control flow is checking the values now guys apart from this not only the variable names over here but you can also provide the expression so let us say we have provided the option is equal to three and we do option minus one over here this time so basically what is getting passed to the switch statement over here option minus one which means 3 1 it is equal to 2 so basically case is equal to 2 this particular line of code should get printed over here let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see option two is selected is getting printed over here now guys very important thing what happens if we don't provide the break statement over here so I have commented this particular break statement let us see what will be the output so when we save this file now and try running this code once again you can see that option two is selected is getting printed which is correct over here but the control flow after printing this particular statement is not going out of the switch statement this time and it is print printing the default case as well you can see that some other option was selected is also getting printed so guys for this reason it is very important that you provide the break keyword over here after each and every case and you can ignore the break statement for the last case that is the default case that's because that is the last statement to be checked over here after which we don't have any other cases to be checked so guys always remember to provide the break statement after each and every case that you have provided inside the switch statement and when we provide option my 2 over here when the value of option is equal to 3 the option will be equal to 1 so what will be the output in this case comment in the comment section below let us see whether your answer is correct or not so please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well I'll see you in the next video in which we are going to learn about an exercise in order to greet based on the time in JavaScript so stay tuned
