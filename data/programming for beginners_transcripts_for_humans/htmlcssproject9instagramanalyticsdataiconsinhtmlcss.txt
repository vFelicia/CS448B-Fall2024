01:08 - inside the body tag over here simply we
01:10 - are going to have the diff tag with the
01:12 - class container this time and then
01:14 - inside this we are going to have the a
01:17 - tag first of all so basically we make
01:19 - use of this a tag inside which we are
01:21 - going to make use of the Box icon so
01:24 - guys basically in order to make use of
01:26 - the icons you can simply use the Box
01:29 - icons.com website where you will find
01:31 - the CSS link over here so simply I'm
01:33 - going to copy this particular link I
01:35 - will provide both these links in the
01:37 - description section below so let me just
01:40 - copy this link and paste it under the
01:42 - head section of the HTML file so guys
01:45 - basically this is the URL from where the
01:48 - icons will be referenced and will be
01:50 - displayed on the web page wherever we
01:52 - are going to make use of the Box icons
01:54 - now guys after this we have to go to the
01:57 - website that is box icons.com so so
02:00 - simply let me just open this website on
02:01 - the browser so guys over here this is
02:03 - the Box icons website now over here
02:06 - simply you can search for the different
02:07 - icons so the first icon that we want to
02:10 - use is the heart icon this time so
02:12 - simply we have searched for heart and
02:14 - when we press enter as you can see this
02:16 - is the icon that we want to use you can
02:18 - use any of the icons based on your
02:20 - project requirements now guys we will
02:23 - click on this particular icon and as you
02:25 - can see on the right hand side we have
02:27 - to go to this font option and then we
02:29 - have have this ey tag over here with the
02:32 - class name so guys basically this class
02:34 - is used in order to refer to this
02:37 - particular icon from the box icons
02:39 - website so let me just copy this I tag
02:42 - over here inside the a tag and then
02:44 - after this we will also have the span
02:46 - tag over here and simply we will have
02:48 - the class as data for the span tag and
02:51 - then we will have the content as 60 over
02:54 - here so we can have any dummy data over
02:56 - here in order to show the count of the
02:59 - hearts and then then apart from this let
03:01 - me just copy paste these lines of code
03:03 - that is the links multiple times over
03:05 - here instead of heart in this case we
03:07 - are going to have the other icons that
03:10 - is comment and the share button so over
03:13 - here we search for comment and basically
03:15 - this is the command that we want to show
03:17 - on the web page so when we click on this
03:20 - we are going to copy this particular
03:22 - itag and similarly let me copy the it
03:24 - tag for the share icon as well so guys
03:26 - over here as you can see we have the it
03:29 - tags with the different class names that
03:31 - will help us in order to display the
03:33 - icons on the web page now guys let me
03:34 - just save this file now and let us start
03:36 - the live server over here so guys as you
03:38 - can see these are the three icons that
03:40 - we have displayed on the web page so
03:42 - guys now we will provide certain CSS
03:44 - properties to these classes that we have
03:46 - defined inside the HTML file so inside
03:49 - the style. CSS file for the container
03:52 - class let us provide certain background
03:54 - color over here and this time we will
03:56 - provide the white version of the
03:57 - background color over here so guys
03:59 - basically we will set this particular
04:01 - background color this time and also we
04:03 - will provide the padding so let's say
04:05 - from top and bottom we want 10 pixels of
04:08 - padding and from left and right we want
04:10 - 20 pixels of padding let me just save
04:12 - this file now as you can see this is the
04:14 - diff tag that is getting displayed over
04:16 - here now guys apart from this we will
04:18 - also set the width as well so let's say
04:20 - we provide the width of 30% over here
04:23 - when we save this file as you can see
04:25 - this is the div that is getting
04:27 - displayed and then after this also so we
04:30 - will make the display it is equal to
04:32 - flex and also we will set the justify
04:34 - content it is equal to Center so that
04:37 - all the icons are displayed at the
04:39 - center as far as the horizontal
04:41 - alignment is concerned now guys you can
04:43 - see that there is no spacing in between
04:45 - these icons so what we will do is
04:47 - instead of providing the center as the
04:49 - justify content we will say space evenly
04:52 - over here so when we save this file now
04:54 - as you can see there is enough space
04:56 - over here in between all the icons now
04:59 - guys what we we can do is simply we can
05:01 - also provide the Border radius as well
05:03 - so we will provide the 20 pixels value
05:05 - for the Border radius and also we will
05:08 - provide the Box Shadow so let me just
05:10 - provide the horizontal and vertical box
05:12 - Shadow and over here we will provide the
05:15 - shadow as dark blue color this time so
05:17 - when we save this file now as you can
05:19 - see we are getting the dark blue color
05:21 - as the shadow for this particular diff
05:23 - tag now guys let us get this D tag at
05:26 - the center of the screen so simply we
05:28 - will provide margin it is equal to Auto
05:30 - so as far as the horizontal alignment is
05:33 - concerned we have got the diff tag at
05:36 - the center of the screen guys this is
05:38 - just a part of the web page in which
05:39 - case you can provide all these icons
05:42 - which is the part of the analytics and
05:44 - user can interact with these icons in
05:46 - order to like comment or share and if
05:49 - you new to this YouTube Channel please
05:51 - make sure that you subscribe to this
05:52 - YouTube channel so that you get the
05:54 - notifications for the upcoming videos in
05:56 - which we are going to create more HTML
05:58 - and CSS projects now guys so far we have
06:00 - provided the required CSS properties for
06:03 - this particular diff tag now inside the
06:05 - diff tag we need to provide the CSS
06:07 - properties for all these links which are
06:09 - being represented by this a tag over
06:12 - here so guys what we will do is simply
06:14 - we will provide the class name over here
06:16 - as link this time for the ax and then
06:19 - let me just copy the class names for all
06:22 - the ax over here so that we can provide
06:24 - the CSS property to this link class so
06:27 - guys let me just copy this link class
06:29 - class name over here and then inside
06:31 - this first of all we will provide text
06:34 - decoration as none so that we don't get
06:36 - this underline as you can see so when we
06:38 - save this file now there is no more
06:40 - underline apart from this we want to
06:42 - change the font color to Black by
06:44 - default so we provide the black color as
06:47 - the font color so when we save this file
06:49 - now you can see the changes this time
06:51 - now guys what we want to do is we want
06:53 - to change the font colors of these icons
06:55 - as well we will keep this heart icon as
06:58 - red color so in of providing the CSS
07:01 - properties inside the external style
07:03 - sheet we will simply provide the inline
07:05 - style over here so for this particular I
07:08 - class that is having the heart icon
07:10 - simply we will provide the style and we
07:12 - will say color it is equal to Red this
07:15 - time so when we save this file now as
07:17 - you can see we are getting the red color
07:19 - over here apart from this we will also
07:21 - provide the color CSS property for the
07:23 - other two icons as well so for the
07:26 - comment part let us provide the color as
07:28 - blue over here here and for the share
07:30 - part let us provide the other color that
07:33 - is green color this time so guys
07:34 - basically we have the red blue and green
07:37 - color for all these icons when we save
07:39 - this file now as you can see these are
07:40 - the colors that are getting displayed
07:42 - over here now guys when the user gets
07:44 - the mouse cursor on these icons we want
07:46 - to increase its size so what we can do
07:49 - is simply inside the link class we need
07:51 - to refer to this it tag over here so we
07:55 - come to this style. CSS file we provide
07:57 - this link class and then I tag over here
08:00 - and then after this we want to make use
08:03 - of the transform CSS property in which
08:05 - case we will make use of the scale
08:08 - function over here we will say that it
08:10 - should scale by 1.3 times this time so
08:13 - when we save this file now so if you see
08:15 - the changes already there is a scaling
08:17 - that is happening over here now guys we
08:19 - want the scaling on the mouse hover so
08:21 - we have left out the hover sudo class
08:23 - this time so simply we provide the colon
08:26 - after the it tag and then we say hover C
08:29 - glass when we save this file now as you
08:31 - can see these are the default sizes for
08:33 - all these icons and when we get the
08:35 - mouse cursor over here you can see that
08:37 - the scaling is happening by 1.3 times
08:40 - over here let us increase the scaling by
08:42 - 1.5 this time so that it gives a decent
08:45 - look so when we save this file now as
08:47 - you can see this is a scaling that is
08:49 - happening and we want the scaling to
08:51 - happen smoothly so simply for the link
08:54 - class we can provide the transition CSS
08:57 - property and we can say all over over
08:59 - here and let's say we provide 0.5 second
09:02 - as the timing so when we save this file
09:04 - now we still cannot see the transition
09:06 - that is happening smoothly so guys we
09:07 - have done the mistake over here this CSS
09:10 - property should belong to the it tag
09:12 - this time so basically we will provide
09:14 - the link class followed by the it tag
09:17 - and then over here we will provide the
09:19 - transition CSS property we will say all
09:22 - and then 0.5 seconds so since we are
09:25 - making the changes for this it tag the
09:27 - transition property should be associated
09:30 - with the it tag over here so when we
09:32 - save this file now and get the mouse
09:33 - cursor over here as you can see the
09:35 - transition is happening now the scaling
09:38 - of the icon is happening to 1.5 times
09:40 - with the 0.5 seconds timing so guys in
09:43 - this way you can provide your own
09:44 - buttons based on your requirements with
09:46 - the help of these icons the links I have
09:48 - already given in the description section
09:50 - below so comment in the comment section
