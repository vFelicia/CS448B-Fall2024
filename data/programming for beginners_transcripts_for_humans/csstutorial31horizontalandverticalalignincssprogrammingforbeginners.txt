With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see horizontal and
00:01 - vertical alignment in CSS so guys
00:04 - basically in order to horizontally
00:07 - Center a block element we can use the
00:09 - margin property and set the value as
00:12 - Auto and this we are going to check with
00:14 - the help of examples as well it is very
00:16 - important to note that Center aligning
00:19 - has no effect if the width property is
00:21 - not set or is set to 100% so guys
00:24 - whenever we are going to use the margin
00:26 - property with the value as Auto we need
00:29 - to have the WID the property of that
00:31 - particular HTML element so guys let us
00:33 - check this with the help of example in
00:35 - vs code over here so I'll simply remove
00:38 - the previous lines of code that we had
00:39 - written in the HTML and the CSS files
00:42 - over here now guys in the HTML file
00:44 - simply we are going to have the div
00:46 - element so let's say we have the div tag
00:48 - over here and simply we are going to say
00:51 - this is a div element so guys let me
00:54 - just save this file now and try
00:55 - reloading this page on the browser so as
00:58 - you can see we have this is a element
01:00 - over here now guys let us have certain
01:02 - background color padding and the width
01:04 - of this particular Dev element so what
01:06 - we can do is simply in the style. CSS
01:09 - file over here we are going to define
01:11 - the diff tag and let's say we provide
01:13 - the width as 50% over here so we say 50%
01:17 - of width and then let's say we have the
01:19 - background color property and we set the
01:22 - value as yellow color in this case and
01:24 - then apart from this let us say we have
01:26 - the padding of 10 pixels from all the
01:29 - four sides so guys in this way we have
01:31 - provided the width of 50% over here so
01:34 - only the 50% of the entire width of the
01:38 - screen will be taken by this particular
01:40 - Dev element so let me just save this
01:42 - file now and try reloading this page
01:44 - once again on the browser so as you can
01:46 - see the 50% width is being taken by this
01:49 - Block Level element that is the dev
01:51 - element over here inside this web
01:53 - browser guys let us have the Border as
01:56 - well so over here what we will do is we
01:58 - will have the Border property and we
02:00 - will see two pixels width of the border
02:03 - and then the Border style will be solid
02:05 - and the color of the Border should be
02:07 - black color in this case let me just
02:09 - save this file now and try reloading
02:10 - this page once again on the browser so
02:12 - as you can see it is now looking more
02:14 - decent over here the div is now having
02:17 - the border of the black color and also
02:19 - the yellow background color now guys
02:21 - this particular div element is aligned
02:24 - at the left hand side of the browser
02:26 - what if we want this particular div
02:28 - element at the center of this particular
02:30 - web page so what we can do is simply we
02:32 - can provide the margin property so over
02:35 - here we will say margin and the value
02:37 - should be Auto so guys when we set the
02:39 - value as Auto the margin from the left
02:42 - hand side of this div element and the
02:43 - right hand side of this div element will
02:46 - be set automatically in such a way that
02:48 - the left margin and the right margin
02:50 - will be same so guys let me just save
02:52 - this file now and try reloading this
02:54 - page once again on the browser so as you
02:56 - can see the left hand side and the right
02:58 - hand side margin is set as same and in
03:01 - this way the div element is now placed
03:04 - at the center as far as the horizontal
03:06 - alignment is concerned so guys this is a
03:08 - very basic way in order to align the
03:11 - HTML element horizontally at the center
03:13 - location by using the margin equal to
03:16 - Auto property over here now guys apart
03:18 - from this we can also Center align the
03:21 - text over here by using the text align
03:23 - property so guys if you notice on this
03:25 - particular web page the text is being
03:28 - aligned at the left hand side of this
03:30 - particular Dev element what if we want
03:32 - this particular text at the center of
03:34 - the dev element that is over here so
03:37 - what we can do is simply we will say
03:39 - text align property in this case so we
03:41 - have text align and the value that we
03:43 - provide is Center let me just save this
03:45 - file now and try reloading this page
03:47 - once again on the browser so as you can
03:49 - see the text is now aligned at the
03:52 - center of this particular Dev element
03:54 - and in this way you can also align the
03:56 - text horizontally based on your
03:58 - requirements now guys apart from this we
04:00 - can also Center an image by using the
04:02 - margin equal to Auto and displays equal
04:05 - to block so guys so far we have seen how
04:08 - we can display the div element at the
04:10 - center of the page what if we have the
04:12 - image to be provided on the web page and
04:15 - it should be aligned at the center of
04:17 - the page so guys let us check that as
04:20 - well so what we will do is after this
04:22 - div element we will simply have the
04:24 - image tag over here and for this image
04:26 - tag we will have the SRC that is the
04:29 - source attribute View and simply we are
04:31 - going to provide the image name over
04:33 - here so let's say we provide sample
04:34 - forest image in this case which is
04:36 - already present inside the directory
04:39 - where this particular HTML page is being
04:41 - stored and then guys apart from this for
04:43 - this alt attribute we will say test
04:46 - image in this case so let me just save
04:48 - this file now and try reloading this
04:49 - page once again on the browser so as you
04:52 - can see the image is getting displayed
04:54 - over here let us decrease the width and
04:56 - height of this particular image so that
04:58 - it can be displayed properly so inside
05:00 - the style. CSS file over here simply we
05:03 - are going to add the IMG tag and then
05:06 - guys over here let us say we first of
05:08 - all provide the display property and we
05:11 - want to display it as a block element so
05:13 - guys by default the image elements are
05:16 - displayed as inline elements and we can
05:19 - display them as block element by using
05:21 - the display property over here and then
05:23 - apart from this we will set the width of
05:26 - let's say 100 pixels over here and also
05:29 - the height 100 pixels in this case we
05:31 - will be setting the width and height as
05:34 - 100 pixels so that the size of the image
05:36 - on the web browser is displayed properly
05:39 - so guys let me just save this file now
05:41 - and try reloading this page once again
05:43 - on the browser so as you can see this is
05:46 - the image that is getting displayed over
05:47 - here now guys let us say we want this
05:49 - particular image to be displayed at the
05:51 - center of the page so what we can do is
05:54 - simply we can provide the mar is equal
05:56 - to Auto so over here we will provide the
05:59 - mar margin property and simply we are
06:01 - going to provide the value as Auto in
06:03 - this case and for the display part we
06:05 - have already provided the value as block
06:08 - so let me just save this file now and
06:10 - try reloading this page once again on
06:12 - the browser so as you can see now the
06:14 - image is getting displayed at the center
06:16 - of this web page apart from this you can
06:18 - also increase the width and height of
06:20 - this image so let's say we provide the
06:22 - width as 200 pixels and height as 150
06:25 - pixels over here let me just save this
06:27 - file now and try reloading this page
06:29 - once again on the browser so now as you
06:31 - can see the image is being displayed
06:33 - properly over here and it is getting
06:35 - displayed at the center of the page so
06:37 - guys just by using the margin property
06:39 - with the value of Auto you can Center
06:42 - align the elements as far as the
06:44 - horizontal alignment is concerned now
06:46 - guys apart from this we can also have
06:48 - the elements Center vertically by using
06:51 - the top and bottom padding over here so
06:54 - guys let us have another HTML element in
06:56 - this case and this time let us say we
06:58 - have the parag over here so guys let me
07:01 - just save this file now and try
07:02 - reloading this page once again on the
07:04 - browser so as you can see we have this
07:06 - is a paragraph tag over here now guys
07:08 - let us provide certain background color
07:10 - and the height property to this
07:12 - particular paragraph tag so what we can
07:14 - do is simply in the style. CSS file over
07:17 - here we will have the p and simply we
07:20 - are going to say the background color
07:22 - and this time we will say the color as
07:25 - aqua and then guys apart from this let
07:27 - us have certain height as well so over
07:30 - here we will say height and let's say we
07:32 - have the height of 150 pixels in this
07:35 - case so simply we are going to provide
07:37 - the 150 pixels value for this height
07:39 - attribute over here and the width of
07:41 - this particular paragraph will be the
07:43 - entire width of the screen by default so
07:46 - guys let me just save this file now and
07:48 - try reloading this page once again on
07:50 - the browser so as you can see we have
07:52 - the background color is equa for this
07:54 - particular paragraph tag and we have
07:56 - this text over here that is the
07:58 - paragraph tag in this case now guys let
08:00 - us say we want to align this particular
08:02 - text at the center as far as vertical
08:05 - alignment is concerned inside this
08:07 - paragraph tag over here so guys what we
08:09 - can do is simply inside the style. CSS
08:12 - file over here we can provide the
08:14 - padding property now guys the padding
08:16 - property takes the values in such a way
08:19 - that the first value will be provided to
08:21 - the top padding followed by the right
08:23 - padding and then we have the bottom
08:25 - padding and then we have the left
08:27 - padding over here so simply what we can
08:29 - do we can provide 70 pixels of top
08:32 - padding in this case and 0 pixels from
08:34 - right and then again 70 pixels from
08:37 - bottom so that the top and bottom
08:39 - padding are same over here which will
08:42 - help us in order to keep this text at
08:44 - the center of this particular paragraph
08:47 - tag and then after this we have the zero
08:49 - pixels for the left padding over here so
08:52 - I simply we are going to provide 0
08:54 - pixels in this case let me just save
08:56 - this file now and try reloading this
08:58 - page once again on the browser browser
08:59 - so as you can see the top and bottom
09:02 - padding are being provided over here but
09:04 - guys if you notice we have also provided
09:07 - the height as well so if we inspect this
09:09 - particular paragraph tag in this case
09:11 - let us check the CSS Box model over here
09:14 - so as you can see this is the content
09:16 - but we also have the padding that is
09:18 - getting highlighted over here in the
09:19 - light green color so the padding of top
09:22 - and bottom is getting highlighted but
09:25 - apart from this we also have the height
09:27 - of 150 pixels over here so guys simply
09:29 - we have to remove the height of 150
09:31 - pixels in order to see that the text is
09:34 - perfectly at the center of the paragraph
09:37 - TCH as far as the vertical alignment is
09:39 - concerned so guys let me just save this
09:41 - file now and try reloading this page
09:43 - once again on the browser so now if you
09:45 - notice we have the text at the center of
09:48 - this particular paragraph tag as you can
09:50 - see the vertical alignment is at the
09:52 - center of this background color now so
09:55 - guys in this way we can simply provide
09:57 - the padding property in order to work
09:59 - ially align the text inside the HTML
10:02 - element now guys let us say we want this
10:04 - particular text at the center over here
10:06 - as far as the horizontal alignment is
10:08 - concerned so guys what we can do is
10:11 - simply we can use the text align
10:13 - property and we can set the value as
10:15 - Center let me just save this file now
10:18 - and try reloading this page once again
10:19 - on the browser so as you can see the
10:22 - text is now aligned at the center of
10:24 - this particular paragraph tag over here
10:27 - so guys in this way we can use the
10:28 - combination of the padding property and
10:30 - the text align property in order to
10:33 - Center align the text inside the HTML
10:36 - element now guys apart from this we can
10:38 - also have the text aligned at the center
10:41 - vertically by using the line height
10:44 - property so guys I'll leave this task as
10:46 - a homework for you so that you can
10:48 - practice on your own and comment in the

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see horizontal and vertical alignment in CSS so guys basically in order to horizontally Center a block element we can use the margin property and set the value as Auto and this we are going to check with the help of examples as well it is very important to note that Center aligning has no effect if the width property is not set or is set to 100% so guys whenever we are going to use the margin property with the value as Auto we need to have the WID the property of that particular HTML element so guys let us check this with the help of example in vs code over here so I'll simply remove the previous lines of code that we had written in the HTML and the CSS files over here now guys in the HTML file simply we are going to have the div element so let's say we have the div tag over here and simply we are going to say this is a div element so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have this is a element over here now guys let us have certain background color padding and the width of this particular Dev element so what we can do is simply in the style. CSS file over here we are going to define the diff tag and let's say we provide the width as 50% over here so we say 50% of width and then let's say we have the background color property and we set the value as yellow color in this case and then apart from this let us say we have the padding of 10 pixels from all the four sides so guys in this way we have provided the width of 50% over here so only the 50% of the entire width of the screen will be taken by this particular Dev element so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the 50% width is being taken by this Block Level element that is the dev element over here inside this web browser guys let us have the Border as well so over here what we will do is we will have the Border property and we will see two pixels width of the border and then the Border style will be solid and the color of the Border should be black color in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see it is now looking more decent over here the div is now having the border of the black color and also the yellow background color now guys this particular div element is aligned at the left hand side of the browser what if we want this particular div element at the center of this particular web page so what we can do is simply we can provide the margin property so over here we will say margin and the value should be Auto so guys when we set the value as Auto the margin from the left hand side of this div element and the right hand side of this div element will be set automatically in such a way that the left margin and the right margin will be same so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the left hand side and the right hand side margin is set as same and in this way the div element is now placed at the center as far as the horizontal alignment is concerned so guys this is a very basic way in order to align the HTML element horizontally at the center location by using the margin equal to Auto property over here now guys apart from this we can also Center align the text over here by using the text align property so guys if you notice on this particular web page the text is being aligned at the left hand side of this particular Dev element what if we want this particular text at the center of the dev element that is over here so what we can do is simply we will say text align property in this case so we have text align and the value that we provide is Center let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the text is now aligned at the center of this particular Dev element and in this way you can also align the text horizontally based on your requirements now guys apart from this we can also Center an image by using the margin equal to Auto and displays equal to block so guys so far we have seen how we can display the div element at the center of the page what if we have the image to be provided on the web page and it should be aligned at the center of the page so guys let us check that as well so what we will do is after this div element we will simply have the image tag over here and for this image tag we will have the SRC that is the source attribute View and simply we are going to provide the image name over here so let's say we provide sample forest image in this case which is already present inside the directory where this particular HTML page is being stored and then guys apart from this for this alt attribute we will say test image in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the image is getting displayed over here let us decrease the width and height of this particular image so that it can be displayed properly so inside the style.
