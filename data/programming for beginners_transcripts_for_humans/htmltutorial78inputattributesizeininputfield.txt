With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see input attribute size
00:02 - in input field so guys basically the
00:05 - input size attribute specifies the
00:07 - visible withd in characters of an input
00:10 - field so basically the size attribute is
00:13 - responsible in order to specify the
00:16 - visible width of the input text box the
00:19 - default value for the size that is the
00:21 - width of the text box is 20 that we have
00:23 - seen so far and it is very important to
00:26 - note that the size attribute only works
00:28 - with following input types that is text
00:31 - search telephone number URL email ID and
00:35 - password so guys basically these are the
00:38 - only input fields on which the size
00:40 - attribute can be implemented and you can
00:42 - simply increase or decrease the width of
00:45 - that input field as far as UI which
00:48 - means user interface is concerned so let
00:50 - us check this with the help of examples
00:52 - in BS code over here so previously we
00:55 - had seen the different attributes that
00:57 - are value then we had also seen read
00:59 - only at attribute and the disabled
01:01 - attribute as well now let us have
01:03 - another input and this time we will have
01:05 - the input field of the type search over
01:08 - here so that we can increase the width
01:10 - or decrease the width of this particular
01:13 - input field so we are going to have the
01:15 - input tag along with the type search and
01:18 - over here for the name part we will
01:20 - provide the value as search and for the
01:23 - ID as well we will provide the value as
01:25 - search in this case let me provide the
01:27 - label as well before the input feed and
01:30 - for the for attribute we will provide
01:32 - the value as search over here and the
01:34 - label that we will provide is search
01:37 - your term or phrase so we have a very
01:40 - simple statement over here that is
01:41 - search your term or phrase which is the
01:43 - part of the label and the user can
01:45 - simply provide a term or a phrase as
01:48 - well having list of words based on the
01:50 - requirements so guys by default the size
01:53 - of this particular input field will be
01:55 - 20 so let me just save this file now and
01:57 - try reloading this page once again on
01:59 - the browser so as you can see we have
02:01 - got search your term of phas and then we
02:04 - have this input field over here for
02:06 - which the width is 20 right now by
02:08 - default let me just provide couple of
02:10 - line breakes over here after this input
02:13 - field so that the submit button is
02:15 - displayed on the Le line so let me just
02:17 - reload this page once again on the
02:19 - browser after providing the line brakes
02:21 - so as you can see the width of this
02:23 - particular input field is 20 right now
02:25 - by default so let us say we want to
02:28 - increase the width so that the user is
02:30 - able to search for some term over here
02:32 - so let's say programming for beginners
02:35 - which is the name of this YouTube
02:37 - channel that you should definitely
02:38 - subscribe if you have not done so so
02:40 - basically when we provide programming
02:42 - for beginners over here as you can see
02:45 - not the entire phrase can be seen within
02:48 - this particular width of the input field
02:50 - which is 20 by default so let us say we
02:52 - want to provide the size as 40 in this
02:55 - case so simply we can provide size and
02:58 - then provide a number that is 40 over
03:00 - here by default it is set to 20 in other
03:03 - input Fields wherever we don't provide
03:05 - the size attribute so let me just save
03:08 - this file now and try reloading this
03:09 - page once again on the browser so as you
03:12 - can see the width of this input field is
03:15 - increased now and we can say programming
03:18 - for beginners so this phrase we can
03:21 - easily see without actually scrolling
03:24 - horizontally and again we can provide
03:26 - more characters over here on the right
03:29 - so we can say please subscribe so as you
03:32 - can see the entire phrase can be seen
03:34 - right now and then further we can type
03:36 - more content over here HTML tutorial so
03:40 - the longer the phrase the characters on
03:42 - the left hand side will code on the
03:44 - extreme left over here so that it is not
03:46 - visible right now within the same input
03:49 - field so guys this is the main reason to
03:51 - use the size attribute in order to
03:53 - increase the width of a particular input
03:55 - field where the user is expected to
03:58 - provide the large input inut in the form
04:00 - of text phrases we can also decrease the
04:03 - size of this input field so let's say we
04:05 - make the size as 10 over here let me
04:07 - just save this file now and try
04:09 - reloading this page once again on the
04:10 - browser so as you can see the size of
04:13 - this input field is now smaller compared
04:15 - to the default size which is 20 right
04:18 - now which can be seen on the other input
04:20 - Fields as well so guys in this way you
04:22 - can easily set the size attribute to any
04:25 - of the input Fields provided the type of
04:28 - the input Fields belong to text search
04:31 - telephone number URL email and password
