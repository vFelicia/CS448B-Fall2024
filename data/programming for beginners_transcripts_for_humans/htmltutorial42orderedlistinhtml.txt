00:00 - so now we will see ordered list in HTML
00:03 - so guys HTML ordered list is used to
00:06 - group a set of related items in list and
00:09 - they will be having a particular order
00:11 - in which we Define them now guys an
00:14 - ordered list starts with the o tag over
00:17 - here so we have the less than symbol
00:19 - followed by o which is ordered list and
00:22 - Then followed by the greater than symbol
00:24 - and then inside the list each list item
00:27 - starts with the Alli tag in this case so
00:30 - guys the list items will be marked with
00:32 - numbers by default so let us check this
00:34 - with the help of examples in vs code
00:36 - over here so guys previously we had
00:38 - return the unordered list items in this
00:41 - case and this is how the unordered list
00:44 - items looks on the web browser now guys
00:47 - what we will be doing is we will Define
00:49 - the ordered list as well below this
00:50 - unordered list so simply we are going to
00:53 - have a paragraph and then we will say
00:55 - below content is in ordered list we have
00:59 - a very simil simple statement that is
01:01 - below content is in ordered list now
01:03 - guys we can simply use the o tag over
01:05 - here so when we type O as you can see
01:08 - this is the starting o tag and the
01:10 - ending o tag so in between these o tags
01:13 - we will be defining our list items so we
01:16 - can simply have the Ali starting and the
01:18 - ending tag over here and then guys let's
01:21 - say we want to have the list of
01:23 - programming languages over here in a
01:25 - particular order so let's say we Define
01:27 - the first list item as python and then
01:30 - we copy and paste this line of code to
01:32 - the remaining lines and then let's say
01:34 - we have another programming language
01:36 - that is Java and then let's say we have
01:38 - C++ over here and then let's say we have
01:41 - dot in this case guys we have taken
01:43 - these programming languages just for the
01:45 - example to show how the list items will
01:47 - be displayed in the ordered list it
01:50 - doesn't mean that python is ranked
01:52 - number one over here and Java is ranked
01:54 - number two over here this is just for
01:56 - the example purpose and all of the
01:58 - programming languages have their own
02:00 - advantages and disadvantages so let me
02:02 - just save this file now and try
02:04 - reloading this page once again on the
02:06 - browser so as you can see we have the
02:08 - paragraph that is below content is in
02:10 - ordered list and then we have all the
02:12 - programming languages that we have
02:14 - listed python Java C++ and Dot so guys
02:18 - as I have told you this is not the
02:20 - rankings that we are giving to the
02:21 - programming languages you can learn
02:23 - based on your interest and each and
02:26 - every programming language have their
02:27 - own advantages and disadvantages an ages
02:30 - and if you want to learn more about
02:31 - Python and Java programming languages I
02:34 - have created lot of videos related to
02:36 - the tutorials of these programming
02:38 - languages along with it we have also
02:40 - covered multiple Python and Java
02:43 - programs with the help of examples so
02:45 - guys you can watch all those videos
02:47 - which I have added in the playlist the
02:49 - links I have given Below in the
02:50 - description section so guys this is a
02:52 - way in order to display the ordered list
02:55 - in this case wherein by default we get
02:57 - the numbers that is 1 2 3 4 and so on
03:01 - based on the number of list items in
03:03 - this case now guys we can also have the
03:05 - type attribute inside the o tag in order
03:08 - to mention how the list items should be
03:11 - displayed so by default as you can see
03:13 - over here the numbers are being
03:15 - displayed in this case but we can also
03:17 - have letters over here so let's say if
03:19 - you want to display all these
03:21 - programming languages with the help of
03:23 - the upper case characters so what we
03:25 - have to do is inside the o tag we have
03:28 - something called as type attribute
03:30 - so as you can see it indicates the
03:32 - numbering type so it can be a lowercase
03:35 - letter or the uppercase letter or it can
03:37 - also have the Roman numerals as well so
03:40 - over here right now we will be using the
03:42 - uppercase letter in this case so let's
03:45 - say we provide capital A over here so
03:47 - let me just save this file now and try
03:49 - reloading this page once again on the
03:51 - browser so as you can see now the
03:53 - programming languages are being numbered
03:55 - with the uppercase characters that is a
03:58 - b c d D and so on so guys similarly we
04:01 - can have the lowercase characters as
04:03 - well over here we need to provide the
04:06 - type that is lowercase a in this case so
04:08 - let me just save this file now and try
04:10 - reloading this page once again on the
04:12 - browser so as you can see we have a b c
04:15 - d and so on the lowercase letters are
04:17 - being displayed and these are used as
04:19 - the numbers for the ordered list we can
04:22 - also have the Roman numbers as well so
04:24 - let's say we provide capital I over here
04:26 - so let me just save this file now and
04:28 - try reloading this page so as you can
04:30 - see these are the Roman numbers 1 2 3 4
04:34 - and so on based on the number of the
04:36 - list items all the Roman numbers will be
04:39 - displayed over here in the ordered list
04:41 - now guys apart from this we also have
04:43 - the start attribute of the o tag so guys
04:46 - let us move to the default numbering
04:48 - system over here so we will change this
04:50 - type value to one in this case let me
04:52 - just save this file now and try
04:54 - reloading this page once again on the
04:56 - browser so we are getting 1 2 3 4 and so
04:59 - on but guys let's say if you want to
05:01 - start with some other number let's say
05:04 - we want to start with the fifth number
05:06 - over here so what we can do is for the o
05:08 - tag we have the start attribute so over
05:11 - here we can provide the start attribute
05:14 - as you can see this integer attribute
05:16 - specifies the start value for the
05:19 - numbering of the individual list items
05:22 - so we can say that whatever value we
05:24 - provide to this start attribute from
05:26 - that value the list items will start so
05:29 - let's say provide the number five in
05:31 - this case let me just save this file now
05:32 - and try reloading this page once again
05:34 - on the browser so as you can see the
05:36 - numbering is starting from the number
05:39 - that is five and then we have 6 7 8 and
05:42 - so on so guys in this way we can easily
05:44 - use the start attribute as well in order
05:47 - to start the ordered list from a
05:49 - particular number now guys we can also
05:50 - have the nested ordered list as well so
05:54 - inside one of the list items we can have
05:56 - another ordered list so let's say inside
05:59 - inside the Java list in this case we
06:01 - want another ordered list over here so
06:04 - what we can do is after the ending tag
06:06 - of this Java list item we come over here
06:09 - and then we provide the ordered list tag
06:12 - that is O and then we again Define the
06:14 - list items and then let's say we want to
06:17 - define the Java versions 19 and 20 so
06:20 - over here we will say Java version 19
06:24 - and then we will have another list item
06:27 - and then we will say Java version 20 in
06:30 - this case as the second list item inside
06:33 - the nested ordered list over here within
06:36 - Java list item so guys let me just save
06:38 - this file now and try reloading this
06:40 - page once again on the browser so as you
06:42 - can see inside this Java list item we
06:45 - have two more elements that we have
06:47 - defined which is again an ordered list
06:49 - over here that is being numbered as 1
06:52 - and two and it is saying Java version 19
06:55 - and Java version 20 in this case so guys
06:57 - in this way we can also have the the
06:59 - nested ordered list over here and based
07:01 - on our requirements we can also have
07:03 - images and other links over here inside
07:06 - of the simple text that we have defined
07:08 - in this ordered list and if you want to
07:10 - have the unordered list over here we can
07:12 - do that as well so instead of using the
07:15 - o tag in this case we can use the UL tag
07:18 - over here which defines the unordered
07:20 - list so we have changed the starting and
07:22 - the ending tag to the unordered list in
07:25 - this case let me just save this file now
07:27 - and try reloading this page once again
07:29 - on the browser so as you can see now a
07:31 - small circle is being displayed instead
07:33 - of the numbers over here which is the
07:35 - unordered list that we have defined
07:38 - inside the nested order list so Guys
07:40 - these are certain ways in order to
07:42 - display the ordered list and the nested
07:44 - ordered list as well comment in the
07:46 - comment section below whether you have
07:47 - learned something out of this video
07:49 - please make sure that you like this
07:51 - video so that it reaches to more people

07:58 - are going to talk talk about is

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see ordered list in HTML so guys HTML ordered list is used to group a set of related items in list and they will be having a particular order in which we Define them now guys an ordered list starts with the o tag over here so we have the less than symbol followed by o which is ordered list and Then followed by the greater than symbol and then inside the list each list item starts with the Alli tag in this case so guys the list items will be marked with numbers by default so let us check this with the help of examples in vs code over here so guys previously we had return the unordered list items in this case and this is how the unordered list items looks on the web browser now guys what we will be doing is we will Define the ordered list as well below this unordered list so simply we are going to have a paragraph and then we will say below content is in ordered list we have a very simil simple statement that is below content is in ordered list now guys we can simply use the o tag over here so when we type O as you can see this is the starting o tag and the ending o tag so in between these o tags we will be defining our list items so we can simply have the Ali starting and the ending tag over here and then guys let's say we want to have the list of programming languages over here in a particular order so let's say we Define the first list item as python and then we copy and paste this line of code to the remaining lines and then let's say we have another programming language that is Java and then let's say we have C++ over here and then let's say we have dot in this case guys we have taken these programming languages just for the example to show how the list items will be displayed in the ordered list it doesn't mean that python is ranked number one over here and Java is ranked number two over here this is just for the example purpose and all of the programming languages have their own advantages and disadvantages so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the paragraph that is below content is in ordered list and then we have all the programming languages that we have listed python Java C++ and Dot so guys as I have told you this is not the rankings that we are giving to the programming languages you can learn based on your interest and each and every programming language have their own advantages and disadvantages an ages and if you want to learn more about Python and Java programming languages I have created lot of videos related to the tutorials of these programming languages along with it we have also covered multiple Python and Java programs with the help of examples so guys you can watch all those videos which I have added in the playlist the links I have given Below in the description section so guys this is a way in order to display the ordered list in this case wherein by default we get the numbers that is 1 2 3 4 and so on based on the

Roman numbers will be displayed over here in the ordered list now guys apart from this we also have the start attribute of the o tag so guys let us move to the default numbering system over here so we will change this type value to one in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so we are getting 1 2 3 4 and so on but guys let's say if you want to start with some other number let's say we want to start with the fifth number over here so what we can do is for the o tag we have the start attribute so over here we can provide the start attribute as you can see this integer attribute specifies the start value for the numbering of the individual list items so we can say that whatever value we provide to this start attribute from that value the list items will start so let's say provide the number five in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the numbering is starting from the number that is five and then we have 6 7 8 and so on so guys in this way we can easily use the start attribute as well in order to start the ordered list from a particular number now guys we can also have the nested ordered list as well so inside one of the list items we can have another ordered list so let's say inside inside the Java list in this case we want another ordered list over here so what we can do is after the ending tag of this Java list item we come over here and then we provide the ordered list tag that is O and then we again Define the list items and then let's say we want to define the Java versions 19 and 20 so over here we will say Java version 19 and then we will have another list item and then we will say Java version 20 in this case as the second list item inside the nested ordered list over here within Java list item so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see inside this Java list item we have two more elements that we have defined which is again an ordered list over here that is being numbered as 1 and two and it is saying Java version 19 and Java version 20 in this case so guys in this way we can also have the the nested ordered list over here and based on our requirements we can also have images and other links over here inside of the simple text that we have

see now a small circle is being displayed instead of the numbers over here which is the unordered list that we have defined inside the nested order list so Guys these are certain ways in order to display the ordered list and the nested ordered list as well comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk talk about is description list in HTML so
