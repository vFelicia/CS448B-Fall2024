00:00 - so now we will see if and else
00:02 - conditional statements in JavaScript so
00:04 - guys basically very often when you write
00:06 - code you want to perform different
00:08 - actions for different decisions based on
00:10 - the data that you already have in your
00:12 - JavaScript code so guys basically you
00:14 - can use the conditional statements in
00:16 - your code in order to do this so in
00:19 - short based on certain conditions you
00:21 - can execute certain different line of
00:23 - code that you want to Define in your
00:25 - JavaScript code so guys basically in
00:27 - JavaScript we have the following
00:29 - conditional statements that is first of
00:30 - all we will use the if statement in
00:32 - order to specify a block of code to be
00:35 - executed if a specified condition is
00:37 - true so guys after this if keyword we
00:39 - provide certain condition inside the
00:42 - parenthesis and if that condition is
00:43 - true then the block of code after this
00:46 - particular if statement will be executed
00:48 - and if it is false then we use the lse
00:50 - keyword in order to specify the block of
00:52 - code to be executed if the same
00:55 - condition is false over here apart from
00:57 - this we also use the lse if in order to
00:59 - specify a new condition to test if the
01:01 - first condition is false over here so
01:04 - guys let us check this with the help of
01:05 - examples in vs code over here I'll
01:07 - simply remove the previous lines of code
01:09 - that we had written so what we will do
01:11 - is we will Define two variables over
01:13 - here so first of all we have the
01:14 - variable a it is equal to 10 and then we
01:17 - have another variable that is B in this
01:19 - case which is equal to 15 over here now
01:21 - guys what we will do is we will compare
01:23 - both these variables by using the if
01:26 - condition and we will see if variable a
01:28 - is it less than variable B so guys over
01:30 - here we use the if keyword in this case
01:32 - followed by open and close parenthesis
01:35 - inside which we have to provide the
01:36 - condition so over here let us say we
01:38 - provide a is it less than b over here so
01:41 - guys basically this is the expression
01:43 - which will return either true or false
01:45 - and then after this we have open and
01:47 - close curly braces and simply inside
01:49 - this we are going to provide the
01:51 - console. log statement and then we will
01:53 - say a is less than b in this case
01:56 - because basically if a is less than b if
01:59 - this particular expression is true then
02:01 - the control flow will go inside this
02:03 - block of code that we have defined and
02:05 - then this log statement will be executed
02:08 - in which we are printing a is less than
02:10 - b over here now guys let's see if this
02:12 - particular condition is not true so what
02:14 - we have to do is after this curly braces
02:17 - we have to provide the lse keyword over
02:19 - here and then we will have another block
02:21 - of code in which case we will print
02:23 - another statement that is a is not less
02:26 - than b over here so guys basically this
02:29 - is the statement that that will be
02:30 - printed and this is the very basic
02:32 - syntax as far as the if else conditional
02:34 - statement in JavaScript is concerned so
02:37 - guys let me just save this file now and
02:38 - let us see what will be the output over
02:40 - here so we run the test.js file in this
02:42 - case as you can see a is less than b
02:45 - that's because the value of a is 10 and
02:47 - the value of B is 15 so 10 is less than
02:50 - 15 over here so basically the control
02:52 - flow is going inside this particular
02:54 - block of code over here and this is the
02:56 - way that the if and else condition will
02:58 - work now guys let us say this particular
03:00 - condition is false and we want the
03:02 - control flow to go inside this else
03:04 - block over here so what we have to do is
03:06 - we have to make the value of a that is
03:09 - greater than b over here so that is a
03:11 - less than b no in this case so since
03:13 - this condition is false the control flow
03:15 - will not go inside this block of code so
03:18 - basically the next block of code that is
03:20 - inside the lse part will be executed
03:22 - this time so let me just save this file
03:24 - now and try running this code once again
03:26 - over here as you can see a is not less
03:28 - than b is getting Ed over here and that
03:30 - is what we had defined under the lse
03:32 - part in this case now guys apart from
03:34 - this we can also use the lse if
03:36 - condition over here so let us say you
03:38 - also want to check whether a is equal to
03:41 - B so what if we provide the value of a
03:43 - it is equal to 15 so this time a is not
03:46 - less than b but a is also not greater
03:49 - than b over here but it is equal to B
03:51 - but what output we will get over here
03:53 - when we run this code so let us check
03:55 - that as well so when we save this file
03:57 - now and try running this code once again
03:59 - as you can see a is not less than b is
04:01 - getting printed over here why so because
04:04 - we have not provided the condition where
04:06 - a is equal to B this time so is a less
04:09 - than b no in this case so the code is
04:11 - not checking anything else and that is
04:13 - why we are getting this particular
04:14 - statement getting printed on the
04:16 - terminal over here but we also want to
04:18 - provide another statement over here
04:20 - either we can provide a is equal to B
04:22 - under the L If part in this case so
04:24 - basically we provide the statement in
04:26 - between the if and else statement over
04:29 - here so we provide provide else followed
04:30 - by the space character and then we have
04:32 - the if keyword over here and again we
04:34 - have to provide another condition so
04:36 - just like how we have provided the
04:38 - condition for the if keyword over here
04:40 - we also have to provide the condition
04:42 - for the lse if in this case so simply we
04:44 - will check whether a is equal to b or
04:47 - not so basically we are using the two *
04:49 - equal to operator in order to check
04:51 - whether both the numbers are equal and
04:53 - then after this inside the curly braces
04:56 - we will say console. log over here and
04:58 - then inside this we will say a is equal
05:01 - to B so guys basically we have this
05:03 - statement that is a is equal to B over
05:05 - here so simply what the control flow
05:07 - will do is first of all it will check
05:08 - whether a is less than b no in this case
05:11 - so the control flow will go to the next
05:13 - lsf part over here and then it will
05:15 - check whether a is equal to B yes in
05:17 - this case and then this particular
05:18 - statement will be printed which is a is
05:20 - equal to B so guys once this particular
05:22 - statement is printed it will come out of
05:25 - the entire if else statement over here
05:27 - and the else statement this time will
05:29 - not get executed so guys let me just
05:31 - save this file now and try running this
05:33 - code once again over here as you can see
05:35 - a is equal to B this time so guys it is
05:37 - important to note the flow of The
05:39 - Interpreter over here first of all the
05:41 - control flow will go inside the if
05:43 - statement over here that is the first if
05:45 - statement if the condition is true then
05:47 - the statement inside this block of code
05:49 - will be executed if not then the control
05:51 - flow will come over here and check the
05:53 - statement once again and if true then
05:55 - this particular statement will be
05:57 - executed and if it is not true then the
05:59 - control flow will come to the else part
06:01 - and then this statement will be executed
06:03 - finally now guys if the statement is
06:05 - executed for this lse if part over here
06:07 - The Interpreter will not come to this
06:09 - lse part that's because only one of
06:11 - these particular statements should be
06:13 - printed on the terminal and that is how
06:15 - the if else conditions will work so guys
06:17 - let us test all these conditions once
06:19 - again so let us say we provide the value
06:21 - of 14 to the a variable let me just save
06:23 - this file now so basically a is less
06:25 - than b over here and the same thing we
06:27 - are getting a is less than b now guys
06:29 - let us say we have both the numbers
06:31 - equal so we have 15 is equal to 15 so
06:34 - this time a is equal to B is getting
06:36 - printed and let's say a is greater than
06:38 - b over here so simply we will provide
06:40 - another number that is 18 in this case
06:42 - so 18 is greater than 15 so this time a
06:45 - is not less than b should get printed
06:46 - over here so as you can see a is not
06:48 - less than b so guys in this way you can
06:50 - simply use the if and else conditional
06:53 - statements in order to execute the code
06:55 - based on the requirement so guys comment

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see if and else conditional statements in JavaScript so guys basically very often when you write code you want to perform different actions for different decisions based on the data that you already have in your JavaScript code so guys basically you can use the conditional statements in your code in order to do this so in short based on certain conditions you can execute certain different line of code that you want to Define in your JavaScript code so guys basically in JavaScript we have the following conditional statements that is first of all we will use the if statement in order to specify a block of code to be executed if a specified condition is true so guys after this if keyword we provide certain condition inside the parenthesis and if that condition is true then the block of code after this particular if statement will be executed and if it is false then we use the lse keyword in order to specify the block of code to be executed if the same condition is false over here apart from this we also use the lse if in order to specify a new condition to test if the first condition is false over here so guys let us check this with the help of examples in vs code over here I'll simply remove the previous lines of code that we had written so what we will do is we will Define two variables over here so first of all we have the variable a it is equal to 10 and then we have another variable that is B in this case which is equal to 15 over here now guys what we will do is we will compare both these variables by using the if condition and we will see if variable a is it less than variable B so guys over here we use the if keyword in this case followed by open and close parenthesis inside which we have to provide the condition so over here let us say we provide a is it less than b over here so guys basically this is the expression which will return either true or false and then after this we have open and close curly braces and simply inside this we are going to provide the console. log statement and then we will say a is less than b in this case because basically if a is less than b if this particular expression is true then the control flow will go inside this block of code that we have defined and then this log statement will be executed in which we are printing a is less than b over here now guys let's see if this particular condition is not true so what we have to do is after this curly braces we have to provide the lse keyword over here and then we will have another block of code in which case we will print another statement that is a is not less than b over here so guys basically this is the statement that that will be printed and this is the very basic syntax as far as the if else conditional statement in JavaScript is concerned so guys let me just save this file now and let us see what will be the output over here so we run the test.js file in this case as you can see a is less than b that's because the value of a is 10 and the value of B is 15 so 10 is less than 15 over here so basically the control flow is going inside this particular block of code over here and this is the way that the if and else condition will work now guys let us say this particular condition is false and we want the control flow to go inside this else block over here so what we have to do is we have to make the value of a that is greater than b over here so that is a less than b no in this case so since this condition is false the control flow will not go inside this block of code so basically the next block of code that is inside the lse part will be executed this time so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see a is not less than b is getting Ed over here and that is what we had defined under the lse part in this case now guys apart from this we can also use the lse if condition over here so let us say you also want to check whether a is equal to B so what if we provide the value of a it is equal to 15 so this time a is not less than b but a is also not greater than b over here but it is equal to B but what output we will get over here when we run this code so let us check that as well so when we save this file now and try running this code once again as you can see a is not less than b is getting printed over here why so because we have not provided the condition where a is equal to B this time so is a less than b no in this case so the code is not checking anything else and that is why we are getting this particular statement getting printed on the terminal over here but we also want to provide another statement over here either we can provide a is equal to B under the L If part in this case so basically we provide the statement in between the if and else statement over here so we provide provide else followed by the space character and then we have the if keyword over here and again we have to provide another condition so just like how we have provided the condition for the if keyword over here we also have to provide the condition for the lse if in this case so simply we will check whether a is equal to b or not so basically we are using the two * equal to operator in order to check whether both the numbers are equal and then after this inside the curly braces we will say console. log over here and then inside this we will say a is equal to B so guys basically we have this statement that is a is equal to B over here so simply what the control flow will do is first of all it will check whether a is less than b no in this case so the control flow will go to the next lsf part over here and then it will check whether a is equal to B yes in this case and then this particular statement will be printed which is a is equal to B so guys once this particular statement is printed it will come out of the entire if else statement over here and the else statement this time will not get executed so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see a is equal to B this time so guys it is important to note the flow of The Interpreter over here first of all the control flow will go inside the if statement over here that is the first if statement if the condition is true then the statement inside this block of code will be executed if not then the control flow will come over here and check the statement once again and if true then this particular statement will be executed and if it is not true then the control flow will come to the else part and then this statement will be executed finally now guys if the statement is executed for this lse if part over here The Interpreter will not come to this lse part that's because only one of these particular statements should be printed on the terminal and that is how the if else conditions will work so guys let us test all these conditions once again so let us say we provide the value of 14 to the a variable let me just save this file now so basically a is less than b over here and the same thing we are getting a is less than b now guys let us say we have both the numbers equal so we have 15 is equal to 15 so this time a is equal to B is getting printed and let's say a is greater than b over here so simply we will provide another number that is 18 in this case so 18 is greater than 15 so this time a is not less than b should get printed over here so as you can see a is not less than b so guys in this way you can simply use the if and else conditional statements in order to execute the code based on the requirement so guys comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this
