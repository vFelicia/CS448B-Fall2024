With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see pagination in CSS so
00:02 - guys basically pagination helps to
00:05 - display The Limited results on the web
00:07 - page across the various pages in the
00:09 - same view and this we are going to check
00:11 - with the help of examples as well we
00:13 - will see how we can create the
00:15 - pagination section so that the user can
00:17 - navigate through the different pages on
00:20 - the same view on the web page so guys
00:22 - first of all let us see how we can
00:24 - create the simple page Nation so let us
00:26 - move to the vs code over here and simply
00:29 - we are going to to create a div tag with
00:31 - the class pagination in this case so
00:33 - guys we have the diff tag with the class
00:35 - page Nation over here and let us add
00:38 - certain links in this case so that the
00:40 - user can click on that link in order to
00:42 - navigate through the different pages so
00:44 - guys over here we have the a tag with
00:46 - the HF attribute we can provide the hash
00:49 - character over here and simply we are
00:51 - going to number the pages so guys this
00:52 - is the first page and so on we are going
00:55 - to create more pages over here so as you
00:57 - can see we have created the page Nation
01:00 - tag over here and it is having seven
01:01 - links in this case now guys let me just
01:03 - save this file now and try reloading
01:05 - this page on the browser and let us see
01:07 - how it looks like so as you can see
01:09 - these are the links that the user can
01:11 - navigate to now guys we can also add the
01:13 - previous and the next arrows over here
01:16 - so simply I'm going to copy this line of
01:18 - code in this case and then what we will
01:20 - do is we will use the special character
01:22 - in this case so guys we have the special
01:24 - character that is less than symbol which
01:26 - will be displayed twice and then at the
01:28 - end as well we are going to to create
01:30 - another special character over here so
01:32 - guys this special character will be the
01:34 - greater than symbol which will be
01:36 - displayed twice so let me just save this
01:38 - file now and try reloading this page
01:40 - once again on the browser so as you can
01:42 - see these are the arrows over here that
01:43 - is the less than symbol and the greater
01:45 - than symbol which will represent the
01:47 - previous and the next pages that the
01:49 - user want to navigate to now guys apart
01:51 - from this let us get this pagination at
01:53 - the center of the page so what we will
01:55 - do is we will have another diff tag over
01:57 - here and then we will have the class as
01:59 - Center in this case and then we will end
02:01 - this diff tag after the pagination tag
02:03 - over here so guys simply we are
02:05 - enclosing this pagination tag inside
02:08 - another diff tag and then in this case
02:10 - we will align the text at the center so
02:12 - guys let us move to the style. CSS file
02:15 - over here and simply we are going to
02:16 - have the class name that is Center in
02:18 - this case and then we are going to say
02:20 - text align it is equal to Center let me
02:22 - just save this file now and try
02:24 - reloading this page so as you can see
02:26 - these are the pages inside the page
02:28 - Nation diff tag now guys we can ALS Al
02:30 - remove this text decoration which is
02:31 - coming by default over here so simply we
02:34 - are going to move to the style. CSS file
02:36 - in this case and then inside the
02:38 - pagination we need to go to the a tag
02:40 - over here so simply we will say
02:42 - pagination class in this case and then
02:44 - inside this we have the a tag and then
02:46 - what we will do is we will have the text
02:48 - decoration as none also we will provide
02:51 - certain padding over here so let's say
02:53 - we have a padding of five pixels so that
02:55 - there is enough space in between the
02:57 - page numbers so let me just save this
02:59 - file now and try reloading this page
03:01 - once again on the browser so as you can
03:02 - see now the pagination is looking more
03:04 - decent over here apart from that we can
03:07 - also have the color for all these text
03:09 - so let's say we have the black color
03:11 - inside of the default blue color for the
03:13 - link so as you can see we have provided
03:15 - the black color text for all the pages
03:17 - inside this pagination now guys apart
03:19 - from this we can also have the hoverable
03:21 - pagination in which case when the user
03:24 - hovers over one of the pages over here
03:26 - the background color can be updated so
03:29 - that the user gets the feedback that
03:31 - that is the page number that he or she
03:33 - wants to click so guys what we have to
03:35 - do is simply inside the page Nation we
03:37 - need to have the Pudo element that is
03:40 - hover so guys inside the page Nation
03:42 - class we have the AAG and for this we
03:44 - are going to create the hover sudo class
03:47 - over here so guys what we want to do is
03:49 - we need to change the background color
03:51 - so let's say we want to change the
03:53 - background color to Aqua over here so
03:55 - basically when the user gets the mouse
03:58 - cursor on this a tag so the hover sudo
04:01 - class will help us in order to update
04:03 - the background color to equa let me just
04:05 - save this file now and try reloading
04:07 - this page once again on the browser and
04:09 - when the user gets the mouse cursor on
04:11 - these Pages as you can see we are
04:13 - getting the background color updated to
04:16 - equa over here so guys this is the
04:17 - hoverable pagination that we can create
04:20 - based on our project requirement and
04:22 - then when the user clicks on any of the
04:24 - specific links simply you can provide
04:26 - the required hrf attribute over here the
04:29 - URL that that you want to call based on
04:31 - the page number that the user has
04:33 - clicked on so guys this is the way that
04:35 - the page ination will work apart from
04:37 - this we can also have the active page
04:38 - color over here so let's say the second
04:41 - page is active right now so what we can
04:43 - do is simply we will have the class over
04:45 - here and we will say active as the value
04:47 - for this class and simply when the user
04:49 - clicks on any of the pages you can set
04:51 - the class for that particular page as
04:53 - active and remove the class from this
04:56 - particular active page over here so guys
04:58 - what we have to do is inside the style.
05:00 - CSS file simply we need to update the
05:02 - background color for this specific page
05:05 - that is second which is having the class
05:07 - equal to active so guys what we are
05:09 - going to do is simply I'm going to copy
05:10 - these lines of code over here and then
05:13 - inside the pagination we will have a a
05:16 - tag which is going to have the active
05:17 - class over here so I'm going to remove
05:19 - this hover Pudo element and simply we
05:22 - will say a do active in this case so
05:25 - guys basically whatever CSS properties
05:27 - that we provide inside this particular
05:29 - select it will be only applied to the a
05:32 - tag that is having the class active so
05:34 - guys what we want to do is let's say we
05:36 - want to update the background color as
05:38 - green yellow over here for the page that
05:40 - is active So currently we have made the
05:42 - second page as active over here so let
05:44 - us see how it looks like let me just
05:46 - save this file now and try reloading
05:48 - this page once again on the browser so
05:50 - as you can see this is the active page
05:52 - right now and when the user goes to the
05:54 - other pages over here on over the
05:56 - background color is getting updated in
05:58 - this case so guys in this way you can
06:00 - also have the active page color apart
06:03 - from this you can also have the
06:04 - hoverable transition effect so guys in
06:06 - this case on over there is no transition
06:09 - currently but we can provide the
06:10 - transition so that there is certain kind
06:13 - of Animation that the user experiences
06:15 - so guys over here we can use the
06:17 - transition CSS property and then simply
06:19 - we can use the background color because
06:21 - that is the CSS property that we are
06:23 - changing on Hover event and then we need
06:25 - to provide the timing so let's say we
06:27 - provide 0.5 seconds in this case so guys
06:30 - basically what will happen is there is
06:32 - no background color by default for the a
06:34 - tag but we are changing the background
06:36 - color on over event so that background
06:39 - color will be updated to the aqua color
06:42 - within the time span of 0.5 second
06:44 - instead of 0 seconds which was present
06:47 - by default so guys let me just save this
06:49 - file now you will experience that the
06:50 - background color of the a tag will be
06:52 - updated to Aqua with some transition so
06:55 - let us reload this page once again on
06:56 - the browser and when we get the mouse
06:58 - cursor over here as you can see there is
07:00 - certain transition that is fade in and
07:02 - Fade Out of the background color for all
07:05 - these a tags over here which is nothing
07:07 - but it is representing the pages inside
07:09 - this pagination so guys you can have the
07:11 - transition effect over here and then
07:13 - apart from this you can also have the
07:15 - bordered pagination in this case so guys
07:17 - basically we have not provided any
07:19 - borders to all these pages so what we
07:21 - will do is simply inside the a we can
07:24 - have the Border CSS property as well so
07:26 - when we provide border of let's say one
07:28 - pixel of the type solid we can provide
07:31 - the color as gray color over here let me
07:34 - just save this file now and try
07:35 - reloading this page once again on the
07:37 - browser so as you can see all the pages
07:39 - are now getting the borders over here
07:41 - but guys there is a space in between all
07:43 - the borders for all these pages so what
07:45 - we can do is simply we can use the float
07:47 - property in this case and the value
07:49 - should be left over here let me just
07:51 - save this file now so this is used in
07:54 - order to remove the Border spacing in
07:56 - between the two borders of these pages
07:59 - and when we reload this page so as you
08:00 - can see there is no more spacing between
08:02 - the borders of all these pages over here
08:05 - so guys in this way you can apply the
08:06 - borders as well and this type of
08:08 - pagination is looking more decent over
08:10 - here along with the borders and the
08:12 - hoverable effect in this case now guys
08:14 - apart from this you can also apply
08:16 - multiple other CSS properties to all the
08:18 - pages inside your pagination diff tag
08:21 - you can have the rounded pagination as
08:23 - well in which case you will be using the
08:25 - Border radius and you can also provide
08:27 - the space in between the link by using
08:30 - the margin property so guys I'll leave
08:32 - this up to you as a homework for you so
08:34 - that you can practice on your own and
08:36 - based on your project requirements you
08:37 - can apply any of the CSS properties for
08:40 - all the pages inside your pagein nation
