With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see input attribute value
00:02 - in the input field so guys basically the
00:05 - input value attribute specifies an
00:08 - initial value for an input field which
00:11 - will be the default value when the user
00:13 - clicks on submit button without
00:15 - providing any value to this input field
00:18 - so basically it means the value
00:20 - attribute will help us to provide the
00:22 - default value inside the input field let
00:25 - us check this with the help of examples
00:27 - and vs code over here so I'll remove the
00:29 - previous lines of code in this case and
00:31 - we will only keep the form tag over here
00:34 - and then guys inside this form tag what
00:36 - we will do is we will have a P tag that
00:38 - is the paragraph tag in this case and
00:40 - then we will say below content is in
00:44 - HTML form so basically we have a very
00:47 - simple statement that is below content
00:49 - is in HTML form and simply we will ask
00:52 - the user to provide the first name and
00:54 - the last name over here so simply we
00:56 - will have the input with the type text
00:59 - in this case so we have the input tag
01:01 - along with the type text and then let's
01:03 - say the name attribute is f name and the
01:06 - same value we provided inside the ID as
01:09 - well and before that we will have the
01:11 - label and for the for attribute we will
01:13 - say F name over here so that this
01:16 - particular label is linked to the input
01:18 - field in this case and then we will say
01:21 - first name over here as the label
01:23 - followed by colon now guys this is a
01:25 - very simple text field in this case and
01:28 - we will not have any value in inside
01:30 - this input field so let us have a submit
01:32 - button in this case so we provide input
01:34 - followed by colon and then we have the
01:37 - type submit over here and the value will
01:39 - be submit in this case let me just save
01:42 - this file now and try reloading this
01:43 - page once again on the browser so as you
01:45 - can see we have two times below content
01:48 - is in HTML form so previously we had
01:50 - provided another paragraph before that
01:52 - form as well so I'll just remove one
01:54 - paragraph in this case let me just save
01:56 - this file now and try reloading this
01:58 - page so as you can see we have the first
01:59 - first name over here followed by colon
02:02 - and then simply we have the input field
02:04 - in this case guys we want the submit
02:06 - button to be on the next line so simply
02:08 - we will provide a couple of line braks
02:10 - over here using the BR tag so let me
02:12 - just save this file now and try
02:14 - reloading this page once again on the
02:16 - browser so as you can see we have a
02:17 - simple text field that is first name in
02:20 - which we can provide the first name over
02:22 - here now guys let's say we want certain
02:24 - default value to be provided inside the
02:27 - first name so what we can do is we can
02:29 - have the value attribute for this input
02:31 - tag so after this ID we will provide the
02:34 - value attribute and let's say the first
02:37 - name with the value John will be the
02:39 - default value over here so let me just
02:41 - save this file now and try reloading
02:43 - this page once again on the browser so
02:45 - as you can see when the user loads this
02:48 - particular page the default value that
02:50 - is drawn will be displayed to that user
02:53 - inside the first name input field in
02:55 - this case and then user can provide his
02:57 - or her own name over here or simply
02:59 - click click on submit button so that the
03:01 - value that is drawn will be passed to
03:03 - the server so when we click on the
03:05 - submit button over here as you can see
03:07 - inside the URL we have the F name
03:10 - parameter followed by equal to and the
03:12 - value is drawn in this case that's
03:14 - because the default value that we have
03:16 - provided in the first name input field
03:18 - is drawn over here similarly we can have
03:20 - another input field as well so let's say
03:23 - we simply copy these lines of code and
03:25 - paste it after the first name over here
03:27 - and we provide L name in this case that
03:30 - is last name as the name and ID and for
03:34 - the for attribute as well we provide the
03:36 - L name as the value and instead of first
03:38 - name we will say last name as the label
03:41 - and for the value part we will say do in
03:44 - this case so guys basically the first
03:46 - name is John last name is do so we have
03:48 - John do as the full name of the user as
03:51 - the default value for both these input
03:54 - Fields so let me just save this file now
03:56 - and try reloading this page once again
03:58 - on the browser so as you can see we have
04:00 - the first name that is having the value
04:02 - default value of John and the last name
04:05 - is having the default value as do and
04:07 - when we click on submit button simply
04:10 - without providing any data over here so
04:12 - these two names that is John and do will
04:15 - be passed to the server as the URL with
04:18 - the F name and the L name as the
04:20 - parameters we can also modify the first
04:22 - name and last name over here so simply
04:24 - we can say programming and then for the
04:26 - last name we can say beginners over here
04:29 - so let me just click on submit button
04:31 - now so basically the first name and last
04:33 - name has been updated that is
04:34 - programming and then beginners as the
04:36 - last name in this case which is being
04:38 - passed to the server so in this way we
04:40 - can have the default values for the
04:43 - required input Fields based on your
04:45 - project requirements by using the value
04:48 - attribute over here inside the input tag
04:50 - so guys comment in the comment section

the value attribute and let's say the first name with the value John will be the default value over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as

own name over here or simply click click on submit button so that the value that is drawn will be passed to the server so when we click on the submit button over here as you can see inside the URL we

simply without providing any data over here so these two names that is John and do will be passed to the server as the URL with the F name and the L name as the parameters we can also modify the first name and last name over here so simply we can say programming and then for the last name we can say beginners over here so let me just click on submit button now so basically the first name and last name has been updated that is programming and then beginners as the last name in this case which is being passed to the server so in this way we can have the default values for the required input
