00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:04 - Python program to count the number of
00:06 - vowels in a string so guys basically
00:09 - there are five vowels which are a a i o
00:13 - u so Guys these are certain characters
00:15 - which are termed as wobbles now we are
00:17 - going to check how many vowels are
00:19 - present in a test string so as you can
00:21 - see we will count the number of vowels
00:23 - in a given string in Python so guys let
00:26 - us check this with the help of Python
00:28 - program in vs code I'll simply copy this
00:30 - test string over here so that we are
00:32 - going to use it in our example so guys
00:34 - over here first of all we will Define
00:36 - the vowels as those characters which are
00:39 - a e i o u so Guys these are the
00:43 - characters that I have placed over here
00:44 - inside the vowels variable and there are
00:47 - no spaces in between we are going to
00:49 - check each character inside this string
00:51 - whether it is present inside this vowels
00:54 - variable or not and then increment the
00:57 - count for that particular vowel so guys
00:59 - over here what we have will do is our
01:01 - test string will be this is a test
01:02 - string or a sentence so now what we will
01:05 - be doing is we will create a dictionary
01:07 - having all the keys as the vowels that
01:09 - is a e i o u so because here I will name
01:13 - the dictionary as count it is equal to
01:16 - and then we will use open and close
01:18 - curly braces over here followed by Dot
01:21 - and then we have something called as
01:22 - from Keys over here so as you can see
01:25 - this is the from Keys method that we can
01:27 - use in order to initialize a dictionary
01:30 - guys it will take two parameters the
01:32 - very first parameter will be the vowels
01:34 - itself which will be treated as the keys
01:37 - for this dictionary so over here we will
01:39 - provide vowels and initially we will
01:42 - provide the value for all the vowels as
01:44 - 0 so comma followed by 0 over here so
01:47 - guys what exactly is happening over here
01:49 - is the count is a dictionary over here
01:51 - it is having all the vowels as the keys
01:55 - that is a e i o u are treated as the
01:58 - keys over here and the value you for all
02:00 - these keys will be zero so guys let us
02:03 - check this we will simply print the
02:05 - value of this count variable over here
02:07 - so when we print the count variable let
02:10 - me just save this file now and try
02:11 - running this code so as you can see we
02:13 - are getting the keys that is a it is
02:16 - equal to 0 then we have e it is again
02:18 - equal to 0 then I O U so all these
02:22 - characters which are vowels are having
02:24 - the initial values as zero now guys what
02:27 - we will do is we will use the for Loop
02:29 - and go through each character of this
02:32 - string over here and check whether each
02:34 - character is present inside this vowels
02:36 - and if it is present then we will
02:38 - increment the value of that particular
02:40 - vowel which we have encountered over
02:43 - here so guys before this print statement
02:45 - we will have the for Loop for care n and
02:49 - then a string name it is Str and Then
02:52 - followed by colon and then guys we have
02:54 - to check if this character that is this
02:56 - variable if it is present inside this
02:59 - vowels strings over here if cap in
03:03 - vowels so in this case that means that
03:05 - particular character is one of the
03:07 - vowels that is present inside this
03:09 - vowels variable so what we have to do is
03:12 - we have to increment the value of that
03:14 - particular key inside the counter
03:16 - dictionary so over here we will say
03:19 - count of that care so over here we will
03:22 - be accessing the value by using the open
03:25 - and close square brackets and inside
03:27 - this we have to provide the care which
03:29 - is the key over here of the dictionary
03:31 - it is plus equal to 1 so guys whatever
03:35 - the value of that particular vowel is it
03:38 - will be just incremented by one since we
03:40 - have encountered that care which is
03:43 - present inside the vowels Stream So guys
03:45 - this is the way that we have incremented
03:47 - the value of the keys as well by using
03:50 - the for Loop the entire string will be
03:52 - covered and ultimately we will have the
03:54 - count of each and every vowel that is
03:56 - present inside the string inside this
03:59 - count dictionary ID over here so guys
04:01 - let me just save this file now and try
04:02 - running this code once again so as you
04:04 - can see we have got the count of all the
04:06 - vowels so the vowel that is a it is
04:09 - equal to two number of times so if we
04:11 - count the number of a over here we have
04:13 - a over here is one we have the first
04:15 - occurrence of a over here and then the
04:17 - second occurrence of a over here and
04:19 - then there are no a characters and that
04:21 - is why we have got 2 over here what is
04:23 - the count of the vowel a so let us count
04:26 - that so we have e over here that is 1
04:28 - and then we have e over here 2 then we
04:31 - have 3 and then 4 so 4 is the count of a
04:35 - what is the count of I it is 3 so let us
04:38 - count that we have I over here one two
04:40 - and then we have three over here so guys
04:43 - this is the way that all the vowels have
04:45 - been counted in this particular test
04:47 - string now guys what if we provide a e i
04:50 - o u that is all the vowels just once
04:52 - over here so we say a e i o u so
04:55 - basically all the vowels are present
04:57 - inside our test string over here let me
04:59 - just save this file now the count of all
05:02 - the vowels is 1 in this case so when we
05:04 - run this code once again as you can see
05:06 - we have got all the vowels count as 1
05:08 - over here and that is how we can
05:10 - successfully count the number of vowels
05:12 - in any of the test string that we want
05:14 - so guys please make sure that you
05:15 - practice on your own so that on
05:17 - different inputs you get different
05:18 - outputs make sure that you like this
05:20 - video so that it reaches to more people
05:22 - and subscribe to this channel so that
05:24 - you get the notifications on upcoming
05:26 - videos as well the next video that we
05:28 - are going to talk about is Python
05:30 - program to merge mails so stay tuned

and then 4 so 4 is the count of a what is the count of I it is 3 so let us count that we have I over here one two and then we have three over here so guys this is the way that all the vowels have been counted in this particular test string now guys what if we provide a e i o u that is all the vowels just once over here so we say a e i o u so basically all the vowels are present inside our test string over here let me just save this file now the count of all the vowels is 1 in this case so when we run this code once again as you can see we have got all the vowels count as 1 over here and
