00:00 - welcome to another video in which we are
00:02 - going to write Python program to compute
00:04 - all the permutations of the string so
00:07 - guys basically permutation is the method
00:09 - of selecting elements from a set in
00:12 - different ways so for example as you can
00:14 - see the number of ways in which
00:16 - characters from y u p can be selected
00:20 - that are yup that is the first way of
00:23 - selecting these characters and we can
00:25 - interchange the second and third
00:26 - character and it can be y p u and then
00:30 - again we can get the second character at
00:32 - the first place and then we can have the
00:34 - first character in the second place and
00:36 - the third character at the third place
00:38 - over here so we have u y p and then
00:40 - again we have u p y by interchanging
00:42 - these two characters and then the last
00:44 - character that is p can be bought in the
00:46 - first place so it is p and then u y and
00:49 - then again we have p y u so Guys these
00:52 - are all the combinations of the string
00:54 - that is yup and apart from that we can
00:57 - also have not selecting any which is we
00:59 - are not not selecting any of the
01:01 - characters so none will be displayed in
01:03 - this case so guys this is the definition
01:05 - of permutation that is selecting the
01:07 - characters inside the string in
01:09 - different ways over here so permutations
01:11 - can be found in two ways in Python the
01:13 - very first way is by using the recursion
01:15 - which we are going to check with the
01:17 - help of example as well and the second
01:19 - way is by using the ITA tools over here
01:21 - so guys let us move to the vs code and
01:23 - what we will be doing is we will Define
01:25 - the function that is get for mutations
01:27 - over here so we say get permutations and
01:31 - then it is going to take two parameters
01:33 - that is the first parameter will be the
01:35 - string itself and the second parameter
01:37 - it will be the variable I which will
01:39 - have the default value as 0 when the
01:41 - function is getting called over here
01:43 - because what we have to do is we will be
01:45 - using the for Loop over here so for J N
01:49 - and then we will be using the range and
01:51 - the range it will go from I that we have
01:54 - defined over here as the second
01:55 - parameter of the function and it will go
01:58 - up to the length of the string so we
01:59 - will say Len of this string over here so
02:03 - guys basically at the start we are going
02:05 - from I that is 0 up to the length of the
02:08 - string and then guys what we have to do
02:09 - is we will extract each character from
02:12 - the string so we will Define another
02:14 - variable that is words and then using
02:16 - the list comprehension we can say c for
02:20 - C in and then we have string so guys
02:23 - basically what we are doing is the y u p
02:25 - characters that we will be passing to
02:27 - this string variable will be assigned to
02:31 - this character one at a time that is C
02:33 - variable over here and this C variable
02:35 - will be assigned to this words and it
02:37 - will be stored in the character array
02:39 - now next we have to do some swapping
02:41 - over here so we say words of I and then
02:44 - comma and then we have words of J it is
02:48 - equal to we say words of J comma words
02:53 - of I in this case so guys this is very
02:55 - simple way in order to swap two
02:57 - variables and then guys after swapping
02:59 - we can call this function again and that
03:01 - is the definition of recursion that is
03:03 - function calling itself so over here we
03:05 - say get permutations and then over here
03:07 - the first parameter will be this words
03:10 - in this case so the words that we have
03:12 - just swapped we will be using that as
03:14 - the first parameter comma what we will
03:16 - be doing is we will increment the value
03:18 - of I by 1 so that it can be passed over
03:21 - here guys I'll show you how this program
03:23 - will work using the debugging mode so
03:25 - that at every step you will come to know
03:28 - like how this I and J variables are
03:30 - being used in order to Interchange the
03:33 - characters inside the string now guys we
03:35 - have not defined any print statement
03:37 - over here so finally we have to provide
03:39 - the print statement when the length of
03:41 - the string is equal to this I variable
03:44 - over here so what we will be doing is we
03:46 - will have the if statement and we will
03:49 - say I is it equal to the length of the
03:52 - string so we will say the length of the
03:54 - string and then if yes then we can
03:56 - simply have the print statement and we
03:59 - need to join in this string over here
04:01 - that's because it is in the form of the
04:03 - character array after swapping the
04:05 - characters inside the string so over
04:08 - here we will see double quotes followed
04:10 - by Dot and then we have a join and then
04:13 - we can simply provide string variable
04:15 - over here and so guys we have completed
04:17 - the definition of our get permutations
04:19 - the only thing that we have to do now is
04:21 - call this get permutations so I'll just
04:24 - copy this and after this definition of
04:26 - get computations we will just paste it
04:28 - over here and then we will call it with
04:30 - the string that is yup that we have just
04:32 - seen the example for and Then followed
04:34 - by comma and then 0 now guys it is not
04:37 - necessary that we provide the 0 over
04:39 - here that's because we have provided the
04:41 - default value as 0 in this case for the
04:44 - variable I over here let me just save
04:46 - this file now and try running this code
04:48 - so as you can see we have got all the
04:50 - combinations that is the permutations of
04:52 - the string so basically we can see y u p
04:54 - over here then we have y p u that is the
04:57 - second and the third character as for
04:59 - and then we have uip then we have u p y
05:02 - we have p u y and then we have p y u now
05:05 - guys there is another combination that
05:07 - is none which we have not caught over
05:09 - here that's because we are not printing
05:11 - the last combination over here so
05:13 - basically we will simply enclose this
05:16 - get permutations call over here inside
05:18 - the print statement so let me just save
05:20 - this file now and try running this code
05:22 - once again so as you can see this time
05:23 - we have got the seventh combination over
05:25 - here after all these six combinations we
05:28 - have none in this case in such a way
05:30 - that none of the characters were
05:32 - selected and which is another
05:33 - permutation for the string now guys how
05:36 - this recursive call exactly works let us
05:38 - check this now so basically we are going
05:40 - to enable the debugging mode over here
05:42 - and I will provide the breakpoint over
05:44 - here on the third line so over here on
05:47 - the right we will say debug python file
05:49 - so now as you can see over here we can
05:51 - iterate through all these steps inside
05:53 - our programs so basically you can press
05:55 - the f11 in order to go into the step or
05:58 - else we can also have the F10 in order
06:01 - to step over so we have this step over
06:04 - over here and then inside the watch we
06:06 - can also observe the values of these
06:08 - variables that is i j and then The Words
06:10 - which is the character array so over
06:12 - here I'll click on the step over as you
06:15 - can see the I and J values are 0 right
06:17 - now and then as you can see the words
06:19 - are getting y u p being assigned as the
06:22 - character array and then once again when
06:24 - we provide click on this step over we
06:27 - come to this get permutations over here
06:29 - now this control flow will go over here
06:31 - once again with this character array
06:33 - that is words and the I will be
06:35 - incremented over here so we have i1 and
06:38 - then J also assigned as 1 and then words
06:40 - will be y u p this time and then again
06:43 - this get permutations will be called and
06:45 - then this is the third time that the
06:47 - call is being made to the get
06:49 - permutations now I and J values are 2
06:51 - over here and then we are again getting
06:54 - my upst words and then the last time
06:56 - that the get permutations is being
06:58 - called why it is the last time because
07:00 - ice value is 3 right now and the length
07:02 - of the string is also 3 so since they
07:05 - are equal the print statement will get
07:07 - executed this time so over here when we
07:09 - press over here once again so as you can
07:11 - see we have got yup as the word since
07:14 - that is the status of the words right
07:15 - now and then it will come to the third
07:18 - call of the cat permutations where I and
07:20 - J values for 2 over here and the words
07:23 - are y u p now this time the swapping
07:25 - will occur so over here let us check
07:27 - that how it happens as you can see when
07:29 - we press over here the I and J value has
07:31 - been changed to 1 again and then this
07:34 - time now J value is 2 and now as you can
07:37 - see swapping will occur this is the way
07:39 - swapping has occurred that is y and then
07:41 - instead of u p we are getting p u over
07:43 - here where the values of I and J 1 1 and
07:47 - 2 respectively so guys basically it is
07:49 - just the matter of these indices that is
07:51 - 0 1 and then 2 which are being assigned
07:54 - to the I and J variables and we are just
07:56 - swapping them at the correct positions
07:59 - based on the recursive cause of this
08:01 - function and then guys once again when
08:02 - we continue going through these steps
08:05 - that is through all the lines of codes
08:07 - over here we can see another combination
08:09 - that is ypu and then let us run this
08:12 - code now when we continue as you can see
08:14 - we have got another permutation that is
08:16 - uyp and then again when we continue over
08:19 - here we have called u p y and then again
08:22 - after continuing we are getting p u y
08:24 - then next we are getting p y u and then
08:27 - we have got none over here so guys this
08:29 - is the way that we can use recursive
08:30 - calls in order to get the permutations
08:33 - of the various characters inside the
08:35 - string now guys that is another way that
08:37 - is by using the eater tools module that
08:39 - you can practice on your own as a
08:41 - homework for you so that you can get
08:43 - some kind of practice now guys what will
08:45 - be the output when we have a different
08:46 - string over here let's say when we have
08:49 - y e s over here what will be the
08:51 - different combinations that is different
08:53 - permutations for this particular string
08:55 - that is y e s comment in the comment

08:59 - answer is correct or not make sure that

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to compute all the permutations of the string so guys basically permutation is the method of selecting elements from a set in different ways so for example as you can see the number of ways in which characters from y u p can be selected that are yup that is the first way of selecting these characters and we can interchange the second and third character and it can be y p u and then again we can get the second character at the first place and then we can have the first character in the second place and the third character at the third place over here so we have u y p and then again we have u p y by interchanging these two characters and then the last character that is p can be bought in the first place so it is p and then u y and then again we have p y u so Guys these are all the combinations of the string that is yup and apart from that we can also have not selecting any which is we are not not selecting any of the characters so none will be displayed in this case so guys this is the definition of permutation that is selecting the characters inside the string in different ways over here so permutations can be found in two ways in Python the very first way is by using the recursion which we are going to check with the help of example as well and the second way is by using the ITA tools over here so guys let us move to the vs code and what we will be doing is we will Define the function that is get for mutations over here so we say get permutations and then it is going to take two parameters that is the first parameter will be the string itself and the second parameter it will be the variable I which will have the default value as 0 when the function is getting called over here because what we have to do is we will be using the for Loop over here so for J N and then we will be using the range and the range it will go from I that we have defined over here as the second parameter of the function and it will go up to the length of the string so we will say Len of this string over here so guys basically at the start we are going from I that is 0 up to the length of the string and then guys what we have to do is we will extract each character from the string so we will Define another variable that is words and then using the list comprehension we can say c for C in and then we have string so guys basically what we are doing is the y u p characters that we will be passing to this string variable will be assigned to this character one at a time that is C variable over here and this C variable will be assigned to this words and it will be stored in the character array now next we have to do some swapping over here so we say words of I and then comma and then we have words of J it is equal to we say words of J comma words of I in this case so guys this is very simple way in order to swap two variables and then guys after swapping we can call this function again and that is the definition of recursion that is function calling itself so over here we say get permutations and then over here the first parameter will be this words in this case so the words that we have just swapped we will be using that as the first parameter comma what we will be doing is we will increment the value of I by 1 so that it can be passed over here guys I'll show you how this program will work using the debugging mode so that at every step you will come to know like how this I and J variables are being used in order to Interchange the characters inside the string now guys we have not defined any print statement over here so finally we have to provide the print statement when the length of the string is equal to this I variable over here so what we will be doing is we will have the if statement and we will say I is it equal to the length of the string so we will say the length of the string and then if yes then we can simply have the print statement and we need to join in this string over here that's because it is in the form of the character array after swapping the characters inside the string so over here we will see double quotes followed by Dot and then we have a join and then we can simply provide string variable over here and so guys we have completed the definition of our get permutations the only thing that we have to do now is call this get permutations so I'll just copy this and after this definition of get computations we will just paste it over here and then we will call it with the string that is yup that we have just seen the example for and Then followed by comma and then 0 now guys it is not necessary that we provide the 0 over here that's because we have provided the default value as 0 in this case for the variable I over here let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we have got all the combinations that is the permutations of the string so basically we can see y u p over here then we have y p u that is the second and the third character as for and then we have uip then we have u p y we have p u y and then we have p y u now guys there is another combination that is none which we have not caught over here that's because we are not printing the last combination over here so basically we will simply enclose this get permutations call over here inside the print statement so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see this time we have got the seventh combination over here after all these six combinations we have none in this case in such a way that none of the characters were selected and which is another permutation for the string now guys how this recursive call exactly works let us check this now so basically we are going to enable the debugging mode over here and I will provide the breakpoint over here on the third line so over here on the right we will say debug python file so now as you can see over here we can iterate through all these steps inside our programs so basically you can press the f11 in order to go into the step or else we can also have the F10 in order to step over so we have this step over over here and then inside the watch we can also observe the values of these variables that is i j and then The Words which is the character array so over here I'll click on the step over as you can see the I and J values are 0 right now and then as you can see the words are getting y u p being assigned as the character array and then once again when we provide click on this step over we come to this get permutations over here now this control flow will go over here once again with this character array that is words and the I will be incremented over here so we have i1 and then J also assigned as 1 and then words will be y u p this time and then again this get permutations will be called and then this is the third time that the call is being made to the get permutations now I and J values are 2 over here and then we are again getting my upst words and then the last time that the get permutations is being called why it is the last time because ice value is 3 right now and the length of the string is also 3 so since they are equal the print statement will get executed this time so over here when we press over here once again so as you can see we have got yup as the word since that is the status of the words right now and then it will come to the third call of the cat permutations where I and J values for 2 over here and the words are y u p now this time the swapping will occur so over here let us check that how it happens as you can see when we press over here the I and J value has been changed to 1 again and then this time now J value is 2 and now as you can see swapping will occur this is the way swapping has occurred that is y and then instead of u p we are getting p u over here where the values of I and J 1 1 and 2 respectively so guys basically it is just the matter of these indices that is 0 1 and then 2 which are being assigned to the I and J variables and we are just swapping them at the correct positions based on the recursive cause of this function and then guys once again when we continue going through these steps that is through all the lines of codes over here we can see another combination that is ypu and then let us run this code now when we continue as you can see we have got another permutation that is uyp and then again when we continue over here we have called u p y and then again after continuing we are getting p u y then next we are getting p y u and then we have got none over here so guys this is the way that we can use recursive calls in order to get the permutations of the various characters inside the string now guys that is another way that is by using the eater tools module that you can practice on your own as a homework for you so that you can get some kind of practice now guys what will be the output when we have a different string over here let's say when we have y e s over here what will be the different combinations that is different permutations for this particular string that is y e s comment in the comment section below let us see whether your answer is correct or not make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is Python program to create a countdown timer so stay tuned
