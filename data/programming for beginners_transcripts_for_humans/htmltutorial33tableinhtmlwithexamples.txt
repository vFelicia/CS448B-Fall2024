With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see how we can display
00:02 - tables in HTML with the help of examples
00:05 - so guys HTML tables allow web developers
00:08 - to arrange data into rows and columns
00:11 - and we are going to check this with the
00:13 - help of examples as well in the VSS code
00:15 - so guys it is very important for you to
00:18 - understand what are the different tags
00:20 - that you can use in order to display
00:22 - your tables in the form of rows and
00:24 - columns so basically we have the very
00:26 - first tag that is the main tag which is
00:29 - called as table over here so again we
00:31 - have the less than symbol and then we
00:33 - have the table keyword and then greater
00:35 - than symbol and this is the start tag we
00:38 - also have the corresponding end tag for
00:41 - this table inside which all the content
00:43 - of the table will be defined and then
00:46 - guys inside the table first of all we
00:48 - are going to define the rows which can
00:50 - be defined using the TR tag over here so
00:53 - TR stands for table Row in this case and
00:57 - it defines a horizontal row in a table
01:00 - and then next we have the table header
01:02 - so in case your requirement is to
01:04 - display the headers in the table you can
01:06 - use the th tag which stands for table
01:09 - header over here which defines the
01:12 - header for the table in this case and
01:15 - then guys we also have something called
01:16 - as TD which refers to the table data
01:19 - over here so TD tag helps us to define
01:22 - the content or data in one cell of a
01:26 - table so guys when we talk about HTML
01:28 - table over here it is similar to
01:30 - Microsoft Excel so if you have used Ms
01:33 - xcl anytime you must have noticed that
01:35 - we have multiple cells over here in
01:37 - Excel and this can be treated as one
01:40 - table over here so we can have the
01:42 - header in this case so let's say we have
01:44 - the numbers over here as the header and
01:47 - their string representation so guys this
01:49 - is nothing but these are the headers
01:51 - that are defining what will be the
01:53 - content of these particular columns over
01:56 - here so we can have them in the Bold
01:58 - formatting so we app apply the Bold
02:00 - formatting over here and we can make
02:02 - them display at the middle of the cells
02:05 - and then guys what we can have is we can
02:06 - have the numbers over here so we have 1
02:09 - 2 3 4 5 and the string representation
02:13 - says 1 2 3 4 and then we have five so
02:19 - guys this is nothing but this is a table
02:21 - over here and this is what we are going
02:23 - to see in the HTML as well we are going
02:26 - to Define this as a table and these are
02:28 - the rows so as as you can see this is
02:30 - one row over here and this is second row
02:33 - then this is third row and so on these
02:35 - are the rows and these are the columns
02:38 - so guys this row is being defined by the
02:40 - TR tag and the data inside each cell is
02:44 - being defined by the TD tag over here
02:46 - which stands for the table data and guys
02:49 - this header is being defined by the th
02:51 - tag which is the table header over here
02:54 - and outside all these tags we also have
02:56 - the main tag that is the table tag in
02:58 - order to Define the entire table so guys
03:01 - with this knowledge let us move to the
03:03 - VSS code now over here in order to
03:05 - create the table so first of all we will
03:07 - have a simple paragraph and then we will
03:10 - say below content is defined in a table
03:13 - so guys we have a very simple paragraph
03:15 - that is below content is defined in a
03:17 - table and now on the next line we are
03:20 - going to define the table over here so
03:22 - when we type table as you can see vs
03:24 - code is suggesting us this particular
03:26 - tag and when we press enter you can see
03:29 - that we have the starting tag and the
03:31 - ending tag so guys this is the shorthand
03:33 - format we can simply type the name of
03:35 - the tag and press enter in order to get
03:38 - the starting and the ending tag in the
03:41 - HTML now in between the starting and the
03:43 - ending tag what we need to Define is
03:45 - first of all we are going to Define this
03:47 - row which is going to have the table
03:49 - header so guys over here we will have
03:51 - the TR tag so when we type TR over here
03:54 - and press enter as you can see TR
03:57 - starting and the ending tag is being dis
03:59 - displayed over here and then inside the
04:01 - TR tag we will have the th tag over here
04:04 - since these are the headers that we want
04:06 - to Define so we have the th tag and when
04:09 - we press enter as you can see the
04:11 - starting and the ending tags are being
04:13 - displayed now we can simply have numbers
04:15 - which is the text for this header tag
04:18 - over here and then guys we are going to
04:20 - have another tag so again we are going
04:22 - to type T and then we will say string
04:26 - representation so guys as you can see
04:28 - inside the table starting and the ending
04:30 - tag first of all we have one row so
04:33 - inside this row we are having the two
04:35 - headers that is numbers and string
04:37 - representation we can also have one
04:39 - header over here or two headers or any
04:41 - number of headers based on your
04:43 - requirements that you want to Define so
04:45 - guys over here we are only taking two
04:48 - columns in this case so based on your
04:50 - requirements you can either increase or
04:52 - decrease the number of rows and columns
04:54 - in the HTML table now guys let me just
04:57 - save this file now and try reloading
04:59 - this page to to see how the table
05:00 - appears over here so when we reload this
05:03 - page as you can see we have the numbers
05:05 - header and the string representation as
05:07 - the header which is being displayed with
05:09 - the Bold formatting over here now guys
05:12 - let us Define certain data as we have
05:14 - seen over here how we have defined the
05:16 - data in the Excel similarly we will
05:18 - Define the data in the HTML as well so
05:21 - again we are going to have another row
05:23 - over here so guys basically this is the
05:26 - first row as you can see now we need to
05:28 - come on the next line that is after this
05:30 - first row we are going to define the
05:32 - second row over here and inside that as
05:35 - well we are going to have two columns
05:37 - with this particular data that is 1 and
05:39 - o1 so guys we come over here to the VSS
05:42 - code we again say TR in this case and
05:45 - this time we will use TD that's because
05:48 - it is not the header that we want to
05:50 - Define now we want to define the data
05:52 - inside a particular cell of the table so
05:55 - guys we use the table data that is the
05:57 - TD tag in this case so so we use TD over
06:00 - here and then we simply provide one that
06:03 - is the number one over here and what is
06:05 - the String representation it is o1 so
06:08 - again we Define another TD in this case
06:11 - and then we say one over here now let me
06:14 - just save this file now and try
06:15 - reloading this page once again on the
06:17 - browser so as you can see another row
06:20 - has been added inside the table and it
06:22 - says one and then one over here now guys
06:25 - similarly let us add remaining data that
06:27 - is 2 3 4 and five number in this case so
06:30 - let us move to the VSS code simply I
06:32 - will copy this TR data which is having
06:35 - the row with the first number in this
06:38 - case so I'm copying this and we will
06:40 - paste it four times over here in order
06:42 - to cover the remaining numbers so guys
06:44 - over here we will change two and then
06:47 - string representation will be two and
06:49 - then over here we will have three and
06:52 - then again we have the three word and
06:54 - then we have four and then a string
06:56 - representation that is four and then
06:59 - over over here we have five and then
07:01 - again we have the string representation
07:03 - that is five so guys basically we have
07:05 - defined multiple rows over here and
07:08 - inside each row we are having the table
07:10 - data that is the TD tag and inside the
07:13 - TD tag we are having the actual data
07:15 - that needs to be displayed inside the
07:17 - cells of the table now guys let me just
07:19 - save this file now and try reloading
07:22 - this page on the browser once again so
07:24 - as you can see all the data is being
07:26 - displayed now in the tabula format so
07:28 - guys you can see under the headers that
07:30 - is numbers over here all the numbers are
07:32 - getting displayed in the left aligned
07:34 - format and in the string representation
07:37 - as well all the string representations
07:39 - of the numbers are getting displayed in
07:41 - the left aligned format so guys this is
07:43 - the main purpose of using the table that
07:45 - is it allows the web developers to
07:48 - arrange the data into rows and columns
07:51 - guys we can also use the border for this
07:53 - table so that it actually looks like a
07:55 - table for you so what we can do is we
07:57 - come over here to the vs code and then
08:00 - inside the head tag we can simply
08:02 - provide the style tag over here and for
08:05 - this style tag we can say table in this
08:07 - case and let's say for this table tag we
08:10 - need to provide the border the Border
08:12 - will be of 1 pixel size and it will be
08:15 - of the solid type and then let's say we
08:18 - want to give the color as black in this
08:20 - case so guys this is one of the ways in
08:22 - order to define the Border along with
08:24 - the width of the Border then this is the
08:27 - Border style like what type of border we
08:29 - want to display and then this is the
08:31 - color of the border so guys let me just
08:33 - save this file now and try reloading
08:35 - this page once again on the browser so
08:37 - as you can see we have got the border
08:39 - now to the table guys we can also have
08:41 - the border to this table data in the
08:44 - table headers as well over here so we
08:46 - can include the th and TD tags over here
08:49 - to the same styling in this case that's
08:52 - because we want the styling to be common
08:54 - so guys after table we can provide comma
08:56 - and then we can also provide th comma TD
08:59 - tags over here so guys this particular
09:01 - styling will be applied to all these
09:04 - tags that we have defined over here in
09:06 - the HTML body so let me just save this
09:09 - file now and try reloading this page
09:11 - once again so as you can see it is being
09:13 - displayed Now using the borders over
09:15 - here all the celles are having their own
09:17 - borders guys also we can align the text
09:20 - to the right in this case by default it
09:22 - is on left so what we can do is we can
09:24 - simply come over here and we say text
09:26 - align in this case so this is the
09:28 - property that can be used in order to
09:30 - align the text and we say write as the
09:33 - value so let me just save this file now
09:35 - and try reloading this page once again
09:37 - so as you can see the content of the
09:39 - entire table is being displayed on the
09:42 - right now so guys this is the very basic
09:44 - way in order to display the table
09:46 - content inside the HTML so to summarize
09:49 - we need to have the main tag that is the
09:51 - table tag and then inside that
09:54 - individually we need to define the rows
09:56 - of the table the first row can be a head
09:59 - if you want to define the header and if
10:01 - you don't have any headers you can start
10:03 - with the TD tags as well the only
10:05 - difference between the TD that is the
10:07 - table data and the th that is the table
10:10 - header tag is that the content in the th
10:13 - tags will be displayed with the Bold
10:15 - formatting over here as you can see
10:17 - whereas the content with the TD tag will
10:19 - be displayed normally without the Bold
10:21 - formatting but you can apply the
10:23 - formatting based on your requirements to
10:25 - the TD tag as well using the internal or
10:28 - the external sty sheets guys apart from
10:30 - this you can also have the table cell
10:32 - that can contain all sorts of HTML
10:35 - elements that is it can have text which
10:37 - we have seen just now with the help of
10:39 - examples instead of text you can also
10:41 - have the images list links and other
10:44 - tables as well so guys you can check out
10:46 - the images and the links as the content
10:49 - of the table data and this activity I'll
10:52 - leave up to you as a homework for you so
10:54 - guys comment in the comment section

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see how we can display tables in HTML with the help of examples so guys HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns and we are going to check this with the help of examples as well in the VSS code so guys it is very important for you to understand what are the different tags that you can use in order to display your tables in the form of rows and columns

and this is the start tag we also have the corresponding end tag for this table inside which all the content of the table will be defined and then guys inside the table first of all we are going to define the rows which can be defined using the TR tag over here so TR stands for table Row in this case and it defines a horizontal row in a table and then next we have the table header so in case your requirement is to display the headers in the table you can use the th tag which stands for table header over here which defines the header for the table in this case and then guys we also have something called as TD which refers to the table data over here so TD tag helps us to define the content or data in one cell of a table so guys when we talk about HTML table over here it is similar to

case so let's say we have the numbers over here as the header and their string representation so guys this is nothing but these are the headers that are defining what will be the content of these particular columns over here so we can have them in the Bold formatting so we app apply the Bold formatting over here and we can make them display at the middle of the cells and then guys what we can have is we can have the numbers over here so we have 1 2 3 4 5 and the string representation says 1 2 3 4 and then we have five so guys this is nothing but this is a table over here and this is what we are going to see in the HTML as well we are going to Define this as a table and these are the rows so as as you can see this is one row over here and this is second row then this is third row and so on these are the rows and these are the columns so guys this row is being defined by the TR tag and the data inside each cell is being defined by the TD tag over here which stands for the table data and guys this header is being defined by the th tag which is the table header over here and outside all these tags we also have the main tag that is the table tag in order to Define the entire table so guys with this knowledge let us move to the VSS code now over here in order to create the table so first of all we will have a simple paragraph and then we will say below content is defined

columns in this case so based on your requirements you can either increase or decrease the number of rows and columns in the HTML table now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page to to see how the table appears over here so when we reload this page as you can see we have the numbers header and the string representation as the header which is being displayed with the Bold

to have another row over here so guys basically this is the first row as you can see now we need to come on the next line that is after this first row we are going to define the second row over here and inside that as well we are going to have two columns with this particular data that is 1 and o1 so guys we come over here to the VSS code we again say TR in this case and this time we will use TD that's because it is not the header that we want to Define now we want to define the data inside a particular cell of the table so guys we use the table data that is the TD tag in this case so so we use TD over here and then we simply provide one that is the number one over here and what is the String representation it is o1 so again we Define another TD in this case and then we say one over here now let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see another row has been added inside the table and it says one and then one over here now guys similarly let us add remaining data that is 2 3 4 and five number in this case so let us move to the VSS code simply I will copy this TR data which is having the row with the first number in this case so I'm copying this and we will paste it four times over here in order to cover the remaining numbers so guys over here we will change two and then string representation will be two and then over here we will have three and then again we have the three word and then we have four and then a string representation that is four and then over over here we have five and then again we have the string representation that is five so guys basically we have defined multiple rows over here and inside each row we are having the table data that is the TD tag and inside the TD tag we are having the actual
