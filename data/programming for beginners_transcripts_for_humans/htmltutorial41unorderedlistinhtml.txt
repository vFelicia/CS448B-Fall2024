00:00 - so now we will see unordered list in
00:02 - HTML so guys HTML unordered list is used
00:06 - to group a set of related items in list
00:09 - and we are going to check this with the
00:11 - help of examples as well now an
00:13 - unordered list starts with the UL tag
00:16 - over here so as you can see we have the
00:19 - less than symbol and Then followed by UL
00:21 - which stands for unordered list and then
00:24 - we have the greater than symbol over
00:25 - here and this is the starting tag of
00:27 - unordered list we have the ending tag as
00:30 - well now each list item starts with the
00:33 - lii tag over here so we have the less
00:36 - than symbol followed by the lii and then
00:38 - greater than symbol in order to define
00:40 - the list item inside the unordered list
00:43 - and then guys the list items will be
00:46 - marked with bullets that is the small
00:48 - black circles by default so guys let us
00:50 - check this with the help of examples now
00:53 - how we can Define the unordered list in
00:55 - the HTML page so guys over here I have
00:58 - defined the title as the unordered list
01:00 - in HTML simply we will have the
01:03 - paragraph inside the body and this
01:05 - paragraph will say that below content is
01:08 - an unordered list so we have defined a
01:10 - very simple paragraph having the
01:12 - statement below content is an unordered
01:15 - list now guys we will use the UL tag
01:17 - over here so when we type UL as you can
01:20 - see vs code is suggesting us this UL tag
01:23 - and we have created the starting tag and
01:25 - the ending tag in this case now guys
01:27 - inside this UL tag we need to Define the
01:30 - list of items so we will be using the LI
01:33 - tag over here so when we use the LI tag
01:36 - it is also having the starting tag and
01:38 - the ending tag over here and inside the
01:41 - lii tag we can Define the name of the
01:44 - item so let's say we Define coffee as
01:46 - one of the items over here and then
01:48 - similarly we will have more items so
01:50 - I'll copy this and paste this over here
01:52 - in the next lines and then let's say we
01:55 - Define another item as tea and then one
01:58 - more item as milk in this case so guys
02:00 - we have three items over here inside the
02:03 - list which is being defined as the
02:05 - unordered list now guys let me just save
02:07 - this file now and try reloading this
02:09 - page on the browser to see how the list
02:12 - items will be displayed so as you can
02:14 - see this is the list items I'll simply
02:16 - zoom in so that you can see the content
02:18 - properly so this is the way that
02:20 - unordered list items are being displayed
02:23 - with the help of the circular bullets
02:25 - over here in black color so guys this is
02:27 - the default appearance of the UN ordered
02:30 - list we can have any number of list
02:32 - items in this unordered list so over
02:35 - here let's say we create more items so
02:38 - we can simply copy and paste these list
02:40 - items in this case and let's say we say
02:42 - Coca-Cola over here is another drink and
02:45 - then let's say we have another list item
02:48 - as Pepsi so let me just save this file
02:50 - now and try reloading this page once
02:52 - again on the browser as you can see now
02:54 - we have five items in this case and all
02:56 - the items are having the prefix in this
02:59 - case it is a circular bullet over here
03:01 - which is defined as the unordered list
03:03 - which is not having any order now guys
03:05 - we can also change this appearance of
03:07 - the bullet in this case so as you can
03:10 - see we can use the list style type over
03:13 - here as the CSS property for the
03:16 - unordered list tag so what we have to do
03:18 - is inside the UL tag we need to define
03:21 - the style attribute so inside the style
03:23 - attribute we can say list style type
03:27 - over here so this is the property that
03:29 - we can use and it is having multiple
03:31 - values that you can see and the disk
03:33 - value is the default value that is being
03:36 - seen right now so what we can do is we
03:38 - can change the value to Circle in this
03:40 - case so when we set the value to Circle
03:43 - it will be a circular appearance instead
03:45 - of a bullet appearance for the unordered
03:47 - list so guys let me just save this file
03:49 - now and try reloading this page on the
03:51 - browser so as you can see small circles
03:54 - are being displayed now for each and
03:56 - every item inside the unordered list and
03:59 - that is the main meaning of the circle
04:00 - value for this list style type another
04:03 - value can be a square value as well so
04:06 - we can have the Square value let me just
04:08 - save this file now and try reloading
04:10 - this page once again on the browser so
04:12 - as you can see we have the squares now
04:15 - that are being displayed for this
04:16 - unordered list items now guys we can
04:19 - also have the nested list as well so
04:21 - let's say we want to describe more items
04:24 - inside this T that is we want to Define
04:26 - black T as well as green te in this case
04:29 - so we can have another unordered list
04:32 - inside this list item so what we have to
04:35 - do is we have to come over here and for
04:37 - this list item that is T in this case we
04:40 - can Define another unordered list by
04:42 - using the UL tag over here and inside
04:44 - the UL tag again we can have the lii tag
04:47 - in order to define the list item so
04:50 - let's say we have black T in this case
04:53 - so we Define black te and then again
04:55 - let's say we have another list item and
04:58 - this time we say green tea so over here
05:00 - we have defined green te in this case
05:03 - let me just save this file now and try
05:05 - reloading this page on the browser to
05:06 - see how it looks so as you can see black
05:09 - te and green tea are being displayed
05:11 - inside this list item that is T with a
05:14 - circular appearance over here so guys in
05:16 - this way we can also have the nested
05:18 - unordered list apart from this this list
05:21 - item can also be an image or a link as
05:24 - well which is pointing to another web
05:26 - page over here so guys you can try those
05:28 - things as well as a homework for you so
05:30 - that you can practice on your own so

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see unordered list in HTML so guys HTML unordered list is used to group a set of related items in list and we are going to check this with the help of examples as well now an unordered list starts with the UL tag over here so as you can see we have the less than symbol and Then followed by UL which stands for unordered list and then we have the greater than symbol over here and this is the starting tag of unordered list we have the ending tag as well now each list item starts with the lii tag over here so we have the less than symbol followed by the lii and then greater than symbol in order to define the list item inside the unordered list and then guys the list items will be marked with bullets that is the small black circles by default so guys let us check this with the help of examples now how we can Define the unordered list in the HTML page so guys over here I have defined the title as the unordered list in HTML simply we will have the paragraph inside the body and this paragraph will say that below content is an unordered list so we have defined a very simple paragraph having the statement below content is an unordered list now guys we will use the UL tag over here so when we type UL as you can see vs code is suggesting us this UL tag and we have created the starting tag and the ending tag in this case now guys inside this UL tag we need to Define the list of items so we will be using the LI tag over here so when we use the LI tag it is also having the starting tag and the ending tag over here and inside the lii tag we can Define the name of the item so let's say we Define coffee as one of the items over here and then similarly we will have more items so I'll copy this and paste this over here in the next lines and then let's say we Define another item as tea and then one more item as milk in this case so guys we have three items over here inside the list which is being defined as the unordered list now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser to see how the list items will be displayed so as you can see this is the list items I'll simply zoom in so that you can see the content properly so this is the way that unordered list items are being displayed with the help of the circular bullets over here in black color so guys this is the default appearance of the UN ordered list we can have any
