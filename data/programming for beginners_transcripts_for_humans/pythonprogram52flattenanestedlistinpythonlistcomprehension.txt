00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to flatten a nested list
00:06 - so guys basically to flatten a list
00:08 - meaning making one list out of list of
00:11 - list so as you can see for example over
00:13 - here if we have the input which is a
00:15 - list which is containing more list over
00:18 - here so this is the outer list in this
00:20 - example and then inside this list we
00:22 - have the first element as another list
00:24 - which is having just one element over
00:25 - here then the second element is another
00:28 - list which is having two elements over
00:30 - here and the third element over here is
00:32 - another list which is having four
00:34 - elements over here in this case now guys
00:36 - we want the output in such a way that we
00:38 - should get only one list which is having
00:40 - all these elements so this is the output
00:43 - that we are expecting that inside the
00:45 - open and close curly braces we are
00:47 - getting all these elements that are
00:49 - present as list inside this main list
00:52 - over here so guys we will be using the
00:54 - list comprehension to flatten the list
00:56 - in one line of code which is very useful
00:58 - in Python programming language so guys
01:01 - let us check this with the help of the
01:02 - vs code over here so what we can do is
01:04 - simply we will Define the list that is
01:06 - list one it is equal to I am simply
01:09 - going to copy this content of the list
01:11 - so guys let me just copy this and paste
01:13 - this over here now guys we will be using
01:15 - the list comprehension over here in
01:17 - order to go through the elements of this
01:19 - main list so what we can do is we can
01:21 - use the for Loop and then we can simply
01:24 - have sub list as the variable name and
01:27 - then in keyword followed by list one so
01:30 - guys over here we are using the main
01:32 - list in this case now guys after this
01:34 - what we can do is this sub list will
01:36 - contain this particular list that is
01:38 - having one element then next time it
01:39 - will have these two elements over here
01:41 - and the third time it will have four
01:43 - elements over here so what we can do is
01:45 - again we can have another for Loop and
01:48 - get all these elements one at a time
01:50 - using this sub list now so over here
01:52 - after list one we can use four and then
01:55 - we can simply use num as the variable
01:57 - and Then followed by n keyword and this
02:00 - time we will be using the sub list
02:02 - because we are going to iterate through
02:04 - these elements over here which are the
02:06 - sub list inside the main list so over
02:08 - here we will simply provide sub list in
02:11 - this case and then guys we are going to
02:13 - have all the elements inside this num
02:15 - variable one at a time that is one will
02:17 - be present and then 2s and 3 will be
02:20 - present and then these four elements
02:22 - will be also iterated one at a time and
02:25 - then it will be present inside this num
02:27 - variable now guys simply what we can do
02:29 - is the entire expression we can enclose
02:31 - it within the open and close square
02:33 - brackets over here we provide open and
02:36 - then close square brackets at the end
02:38 - now guys before this entire for Loop
02:41 - that is the for expression we have to
02:43 - provide this num variable so this num
02:45 - variable will be considered from this
02:47 - entire expression and one at a time all
02:50 - these numbers will be returned by this
02:52 - num variable and we need to catch it
02:54 - inside another list so let's say we
02:56 - provide the result over here and then
02:58 - equal to so this result will have the
03:01 - list data type since we are having this
03:03 - entire expression within the open and
03:06 - close square brackets over here and guys
03:08 - this is what we call it as list
03:10 - comprehension over here which helps us
03:12 - in order to write one line of code in
03:14 - order to achieve the task now guys we
03:17 - have the entire list that is all the
03:19 - individual numbers inside this resulted
03:21 - list so let us verify this we can simply
03:24 - have the print statement followed by
03:26 - result in this case so basically this
03:28 - result list we are printing over here on
03:30 - the console let me save this file now
03:33 - and try running this code now so as you
03:35 - can see we are getting all the elements
03:36 - that is one two three four five six
03:39 - inside one list instead of having
03:41 - different list over here if we print the
03:43 - original list as well we can have the
03:46 - original list over here as so we can
03:48 - simply provide the label that is
03:50 - original list followed by colon and then
03:54 - we can provide a list one over here and
03:56 - then over here as well we will provide
03:58 - the label that is the result right Less
04:01 - in this case followed by colon and then
04:03 - comma and then we have the result so let
04:05 - me just save this file now and try
04:07 - running this code once again so as you
04:09 - can see we are getting the original list
04:10 - which is list inside the list so we have
04:13 - this one element as a list which is
04:15 - present inside the outer list over here
04:18 - then we have 2 3 as a list which is
04:20 - present inside the outer list and then
04:22 - again the third list is also present
04:24 - which is having four elements but the
04:26 - result list is having all the elements
04:29 - in just one list in this case so guys
04:31 - this list comprehension is very
04:33 - important we write our Expressions based
04:35 - on our requirements in such a way that
04:37 - we can achieve our task with one line of
04:39 - code over here which is possible with
04:41 - Python programming language now guys
04:43 - there is another way in order to find
04:44 - the result list over here we can use two
04:46 - for Loops that is the first for Loop in
04:49 - order to go through the list one items
04:51 - over here and then the second for Loop
04:53 - in order to go through these individual
04:55 - list inside the list one so guys you can
04:58 - practice on your own as a homework for
04:59 - you if you want to implement that using
05:02 - the two for Loops that is the nested for
05:04 - Loop in order to combine all these
05:07 - elephants inside one list so make sure
05:09 - that you practice on your own so that on
05:11 - different inputs you get different
05:12 - outputs also you can like this video so
05:14 - that it reaches to more people and
05:16 - subscribe to the channel so that you get
05:18 - the notifications on upcoming videos as
05:20 - well the next video that we are going to
05:21 - talk about is Python program to iterate
05:24 - over dictionaries using for Loop so stay
05:27 - tuned
