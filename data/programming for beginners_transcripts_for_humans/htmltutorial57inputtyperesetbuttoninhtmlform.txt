With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see input type reset in
00:02 - HTML form so guys basically the input
00:05 - tag along with the type value as reset
00:08 - will Define a reset button that will
00:11 - reset all the form values to their
00:13 - default values so guys let's say for
00:15 - example you have multiple text fields in
00:18 - a particular form and then when the user
00:20 - tries to enter some data and wants to
00:23 - reset all the data that is clear the
00:25 - data in such cases it would be very
00:27 - helpful in order to provide a button
00:29 - that will help the user to reset all the
00:32 - data and this input tag with the type
00:35 - reset will help us to do the same so let
00:37 - us check this with the help of examples
00:39 - in vs code so guys previously we had
00:41 - seen that we had provided the username
00:43 - text field along with that we had also
00:45 - provided the password text Fields along
00:47 - with their labels and then we had also
00:49 - provided the submit button we had
00:52 - provided the value that is user by
00:54 - default to the username text field so
00:57 - let me show you how it looks on the
00:58 - browser so this is the the content of
01:00 - the previous code that we had return so
01:02 - we have a normal username and then we
01:05 - have the password and then we have the
01:06 - submit button in which case we can
01:08 - simply provide the username over here
01:10 - and we can also provide the password
01:13 - which will not be displayed to the user
01:15 - or any other person who is seeing your
01:17 - screen and then we have the submit
01:18 - button now guys let's say the user wants
01:21 - to clear all this data what we can do is
01:23 - simply we can have the input tag along
01:26 - with the type value which is reset over
01:28 - here so guys let me just Define find
01:30 - that as well so we provide input
01:32 - followed by colon and then we have
01:34 - something called as reset over here guys
01:36 - this is the Mt abbreviation that we can
01:38 - use in the vs code over here as you can
01:41 - see input type reset will be
01:43 - autogenerated when we type this so if
01:45 - you are working on any other text editor
01:47 - such as notepad or notepad++ you need to
01:50 - manually type all these characters over
01:52 - here as you can see inside the tag we
01:54 - have the type attribute and the other
01:56 - attributes as well but if you working
01:58 - with the vs code you you can make use of
02:00 - this emit abbreviation over here so we
02:03 - click on this particular option as you
02:05 - can see this is the tag that is input
02:07 - followed by type attribute and then we
02:09 - have the reset value as the type now
02:12 - guys we can also have the value on this
02:14 - button to be set so either we can say
02:17 - reset or we can simply say clear over
02:19 - here so basically this is the text that
02:22 - will be displayed on the button in this
02:24 - case so let me just save this file now
02:26 - and try reloading this page once again
02:28 - on the browser so as you can can see we
02:30 - have got the clear button over here now
02:32 - guys let's say I want to increase some
02:34 - spacing in between the submit and the
02:36 - clear button so what we can do is after
02:38 - this input of type submit button in this
02:41 - case we can have ERS and then
02:43 - non-breaking space that is nbsp so guys
02:47 - basically this is helpful when you want
02:49 - to add certain space characters in
02:51 - between the HTML elements and to avoid
02:54 - them to break into multiple lines so
02:56 - over here when we select this
02:58 - non-breaking space let me just save this
03:00 - file now and after reloading this page
03:02 - you will be noticing that the space
03:04 - between the submit and the clear button
03:06 - will increase over here so when we
03:08 - reload this as you can see the space c
03:10 - increased in this case and based on how
03:12 - many space characters you want you can
03:14 - provide the non-breaking space
03:16 - characters over here after the submit
03:18 - button now guys what happens when we
03:19 - click on the clear button so for now
03:22 - there is no data in the usern name and
03:24 - the password fails and that is why we
03:26 - are not seeing any results over here but
03:28 - when we provide certain dat data so
03:30 - let's say we provide username and let's
03:32 - say we provide some test password over
03:34 - here and then either we can click on
03:36 - submit but let's say if we have provided
03:38 - some incorrect data over here in
03:40 - multiple Fields inside the form so
03:42 - simply we can click on clear over here
03:44 - so when we click on clear as you can see
03:47 - all the text boxes are cleared now and
03:50 - they will be having their default values
03:52 - if they have any so here basically we
03:54 - have the user value as the default value
03:57 - inside the username that is why we are
03:59 - getting that value but if we remove this
04:02 - value that is user from here then that
04:04 - content will be also removed so let me
04:07 - just refresh this page once again over
04:09 - here and when we provide the data once
04:11 - again that is username in this case and
04:13 - then let's say we provide password over
04:16 - here and then when we click on this
04:17 - clear button as you can see the text
04:19 - Fields got cleared and that is the main
04:21 - functionality of this reset value for
04:24 - the type attribute inside the input tag
04:27 - so guys comment in the comment section
