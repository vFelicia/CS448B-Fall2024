00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to check if a number is
00:06 - positive negative or zero so guys in
00:08 - this example you will learn to check
00:10 - whether a number entered by the user is
00:13 - it a positive or A negative number or
00:15 - else if it is a zero so this problem is
00:17 - solved using the if alif and L statement
00:20 - so guys let us move to the vs code in
00:22 - order to check this program so basically
00:24 - the very first thing that we have to do
00:26 - is take the input from the user so this
00:29 - will be an integer so what we will do is
00:31 - we will take the integer function over
00:33 - here and inside this we will take the
00:35 - input from the user since the default
00:37 - input that will be taken by the user
00:39 - will be in the form of the string data
00:41 - type we need to convert it into the
00:43 - integer so that is why we have provided
00:45 - the inter prefix over here as the
00:47 - function so guys over here we will ask
00:50 - the user to enter the number so user
00:53 - will enter this number and it will be
00:55 - assigned to this number as an integer
00:57 - now we need to check whether this number
00:59 - that is entered by the user if it is a
01:01 - positive number if it is a negative
01:03 - number or else if it is 0 and
01:05 - accordingly we will print the output so
01:08 - the very first thing that we have to do
01:09 - is we use the if condition and we say
01:12 - number is it greater than zero so when a
01:15 - number is positive then it will be
01:17 - greater than 0 in this case what we have
01:19 - to do is simply we print that entered
01:22 - number so we say entered number that is
01:26 - we use the curly braces because we are
01:28 - going to use the dot format function
01:30 - over here in order to print the number
01:32 - over here and then we say is a positive
01:37 - number and then what we will do is after
01:40 - the string we will use dot followed by
01:42 - format and then we will provide this
01:45 - variable that is number so that it is
01:47 - printed inside this early braces over
01:49 - here so we say number over here now guys
01:52 - what if the number is not greater than 0
01:54 - so we will come in the alif part and
01:57 - then again we will check whether number
01:58 - is less than 0 so we say number is less
02:02 - than 0 and if the number is less than 0
02:04 - then it is a negative number so I'll
02:07 - simply copy this line of code and paste
02:09 - this over here but this time we will say
02:11 - enter number and then these curly braces
02:13 - will be replaced by this number is a
02:15 - negative number this time so we will say
02:17 - negative number over here if it is less
02:20 - than 0 or else it will be equal to 0 so
02:23 - basically we have checked whether the
02:25 - number is greater than 0 or else if it
02:27 - is less than 0 if no condition is
02:29 - getting satisfied after these two
02:30 - conditions and the number will be equal
02:32 - to 0 so we will simply print that the
02:34 - number is zero so over here we say
02:36 - number is 0 in this case so guys this is
02:40 - the way that we can easily write the
02:42 - Python program in order to check whether
02:44 - the enter number is a positive number
02:46 - negative number or else if it is a zero
02:49 - so guys let me just save this file now
02:50 - and try running this code so the very
02:52 - first thing that is being asked by the
02:54 - program is to enter the number so let's
02:56 - say we provide the number that is 12
02:58 - over here when we press enter as you can
03:01 - see entered number 12 is a positive
03:03 - number so basically this condition is
03:06 - getting satisfied because a number is
03:07 - greater than 0 and we are getting this
03:10 - statement being printed on the console
03:12 - now guys let us run this code once again
03:14 - this time what we will do is we will
03:15 - provide a number that is less than zero
03:17 - so let's say we provide minus 1 in this
03:20 - case and then when we press enter as you
03:22 - can see enter number that is minus 1 is
03:25 - a negative number why so because the
03:27 - very first thing that is number greater
03:29 - than 0 was not satisfied and then the
03:31 - control flow goes over here and it
03:33 - checks whether the number is less than
03:35 - zero so the condition that is number
03:37 - less than 0 is true in this case and
03:39 - that is the reason we are getting this
03:41 - statement being printed on the console
03:43 - that the entered number minus 1 is a
03:45 - negative number now guys let us check
03:47 - for the last statement that is number is
03:49 - zero so we have to provide the number
03:51 - from the user as 0 so let me just run
03:54 - this code once again over here we
03:55 - provide 0 as the number so when we press
03:58 - enter as you can see number is 0 in this
04:01 - case so this thing is getting printed
04:02 - over here now guys can we provide the
04:04 - float numbers as well so let's say when
04:06 - we run this code once again we want to
04:08 - provide a positive number that is a
04:10 - float number so we provide 2.13 in this
04:13 - case and when we press enter as you can
04:15 - see we are getting an error that is
04:17 - invalid literal for INT with base 10. so
04:20 - over here we are getting the error when
04:22 - we provide the float integer so what we
04:24 - need to do in order to avoid this error
04:26 - so basically since we are expecting of
04:29 - load number to be taken by this number
04:31 - variable but we are providing the int
04:34 - function over here we need to change it
04:36 - to a float number in this case is so
04:38 - that a float number gets stored in this
04:40 - number variable so now let us check this
04:42 - code once again I'll save this file and
04:44 - try running this code now so again we
04:46 - will provide the same number this time
04:47 - so let's say we provide 2.13 in this
04:50 - case when we press enter as you can see
04:52 - enter number 2.13 is a positive number
04:56 - so guys in this way we can also use the
04:58 - float numbers in order to check whether
05:00 - they are positive negative or zero let
05:02 - us take another input now I'll run this
05:05 - code once again we will say minus
05:07 - 0.01 so guys take this as a homework for
05:10 - you what will be the output of this
05:12 - particular number that is entered by the
05:14 - user whether it will be a positive
05:16 - number a negative number or else whether
05:18 - number is 0 will be printed comment in
05:21 - the comment section below let's see
05:22 - whether your answer is correct or not
05:24 - please make sure that you practice on
05:25 - your own so that on different inputs you
05:27 - get different output make sure that you
05:29 - like this video so that it reaches to
05:31 - more people and subscribe to this
05:32 - channel so that you get the
05:33 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
05:36 - the next video that we are going to talk
05:37 - talk about is a Python program to check
05:39 - if a number is odd or even so stay tuned

early braces over here so we say number over here now guys what if the number is not greater than 0 so we will come in the alif part and then again we will check whether number is less than 0 so we say number is less than 0 and if the number is less than 0 then it is a negative number so I'll simply copy this line of code and paste this over here but this time we will say enter number and then these curly braces will be replaced by this number is a negative number this time so we will say negative number over here if it is less than 0 or else it will be equal to 0 so basically we have checked whether the number is greater than 0 or else if it is less than 0 if no condition is getting satisfied after these two conditions and the number will be equal to 0 so we will simply print that the number is zero so over here we say number is 0 in this case so guys this is the way that we can easily write the Python program in order to check whether the enter number is a positive number negative number or else if it is a zero so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code so the very first thing that is being asked by the program is to enter the number so let's say

order to check whether they are positive negative or zero let us take another input now I'll run this code once again we will say minus 0.01 so guys take this as a homework for you what will be the output of this particular number that is entered by the user whether it will be a positive number a negative number or else whether number is 0 will be printed comment in the comment section below
