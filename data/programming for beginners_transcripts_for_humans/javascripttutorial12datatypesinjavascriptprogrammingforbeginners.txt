With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see data types in
00:02 - JavaScript so guys basically JavaScript
00:04 - has eight data types as you can see the
00:06 - first data type is the string data type
00:08 - that we have already seen previously
00:10 - next we have the number data type in
00:12 - which we can have the integers or the
00:14 - float numbers as well along with the
00:16 - decimal point apart from this we also
00:18 - have the big int data type in which case
00:21 - if any of the values cannot be
00:23 - represented by the number such as the
00:25 - very big numbers then we can use the big
00:27 - int data type over here apart from this
00:29 - we also have the bullan data type which
00:31 - is having only two values that is true
00:33 - and false and then we also have the
00:36 - undefined data type followed by the null
00:38 - data type and then we have the symbol
00:40 - and the object data types as well so
00:43 - guys let us check this with the help of
00:44 - examples in vs code over here so first
00:47 - of all we will see how we can Define the
00:49 - variable with the string data type so
00:51 - over here we will provide the variable
00:54 - name as Str Str and as we have discussed
00:56 - previously whatever value we provide in
00:59 - between the double codes or the single
01:01 - code or the back tick as well those
01:03 - values are represented as string in
01:05 - JavaScript so guys over here let us
01:08 - provide programming for beginners that
01:10 - is the name of this YouTube channel
01:11 - which you should definitely subscribe if
01:13 - you have not done so so basically we
01:16 - have this value as the string data type
01:18 - over here so the Str Str variable is now
01:21 - of the data type string in this case
01:23 - based on the value that we have provided
01:25 - so let us confirm that as well we will
01:27 - simply provide the type of character in
01:29 - inside the console. log statement and
01:32 - then we will provide the variable name
01:34 - apart from this we also want to print
01:36 - the variable value so simply we will say
01:39 - back text and then inside this we will
01:41 - say value of St Str is and Then followed
01:45 - by dollar and then inside the open and
01:47 - close curly braces we will provide the
01:49 - name of the variable that is St Str in
01:51 - this case so guys let me just save this
01:53 - file now and try running this code on
01:55 - the terminal so we will say node
01:57 - followed by the name of the JavaScript
02:00 - file that is test.js over here so as you
02:02 - can see we are getting the string as the
02:04 - output for this type of operator when we
02:07 - check the data type of this particular
02:09 - variable so basically the stdr variable
02:11 - is of the string data type over here
02:14 - apart from this the value of St Str is
02:16 - programming for beginners so you can see
02:18 - that this is the string that is getting
02:20 - printed over here so guys in this way
02:22 - this is the first data type that you can
02:24 - use in JavaScript apart from this when
02:27 - you say number basically on the right
02:29 - hand side you only have to provide the
02:31 - value of the number over here so let's
02:33 - say we provide the value as 10 in this
02:35 - case so guys basically since we are not
02:37 - using any double quotes or single quote
02:40 - over here based on the value of the
02:42 - variable the data type will be assigned
02:44 - to this particular variable so now Str
02:46 - Str will be having the data type of
02:48 - number so let us check that as well so
02:51 - over here we will also provide the
02:52 - string so that we can understand that
02:54 - this is the data type over here so guys
02:56 - basically we have data type followed by
02:58 - colon and then we are using the plus
03:00 - operator and then we are using the type
03:02 - of operator in order to get the data
03:04 - type of this particular variable let me
03:06 - just save this file now and try running
03:08 - this code once again over here as you
03:10 - can see now the data type it is equal to
03:13 - number this time that's because we have
03:15 - provided the value as number over here
03:17 - and the value of Str Str is 10 so guys
03:20 - basically we have not changed the
03:22 - variable name over here but we are
03:24 - simply changing the value So based on
03:26 - the value of the variable the data type
03:29 - will be assigned to that particular
03:30 - variable let us say we provide certain
03:33 - decimal point over here and after that
03:35 - we provide the number that is 35 which
03:37 - means 10.35 is the number so basically
03:40 - this is the float number which belongs
03:42 - to the number data type over here when
03:44 - we save this file now and try running
03:46 - this code once again over here as you
03:48 - can see data type it is equal to number
03:50 - again and the value of Str Str it is
03:52 - 10.35 so guys whether it is integers or
03:55 - the floating Point numbers with the
03:57 - decimal point all those numbers will be
03:59 - belong to the number data type and based
04:02 - on your requirements you can provide the
04:04 - values for these variables now guys
04:06 - apart from this how do we Define the big
04:08 - int over here so let us say we have a
04:10 - very big number in this case so let me
04:12 - just print a very big number over here
04:14 - so as you can see we have a very big
04:16 - number on the right hand side so let us
04:18 - see how this number will be printed on
04:20 - the console there is certain warning
04:22 - that is coming over here numeric
04:24 - literals with absolute values equal to 2
04:27 - ra to the power of 53 or greater are too
04:30 - large to be represented accurately as
04:32 - integers so guys basically it is giving
04:34 - a certain kind of information over here
04:37 - that this is belonging to a big integer
04:39 - but still let us see how the number will
04:41 - be printed on the console so let me just
04:43 - save this file now and try running this
04:45 - code once again over here so as you can
04:47 - see the data type is still number
04:49 - because we are not using the big integer
04:51 - over here in order to convert this
04:53 - particular value into a big integer so
04:56 - basically the data type is number and
04:58 - the value of this St are it is 1.23 and
05:01 - so on basically e ra to the power of 30
05:04 - is being used over here in order to
05:06 - represent the number but guys let us say
05:08 - you want to print this exact number on
05:10 - the terminal so what you can do is
05:12 - simply you can use the big int over here
05:14 - so basically this is the class that is
05:16 - big int that you have to use and when
05:18 - you use this you need to provide the
05:20 - data inside the double codes which needs
05:23 - to be enclosed between the open and
05:25 - close parenthesis over here so as you
05:27 - can see we have the big end and then we
05:29 - have the open parenthesis followed by
05:31 - the double codes and then the entire
05:33 - number that is present inside this
05:35 - double code and then we have the closed
05:38 - parenthesis over here so let me just
05:39 - save this file now and let us see what
05:41 - will be the output over here on the
05:43 - terminal so as you can see we are
05:44 - getting the data type it is equal to Big
05:46 - int over here and the value of St Str it
05:49 - is the big number that we have already
05:51 - provided in our code in this case so
05:54 - guys basically if you want to use this
05:56 - big number and want to represent it as
05:58 - the big in over here you can use this
06:01 - big int prefix over here and then you
06:03 - need to enclose this entire number
06:05 - within the parenthesis now guys apart
06:07 - from this you can also use the Boolean
06:09 - data type as well so basically it is
06:11 - going to have either true or false value
06:14 - so when we say true in this case it is a
06:16 - keyword that is reserved by JavaScript
06:18 - over here so let me just save this file
06:19 - now let us see the data type and the
06:21 - value of this True Value so as you can
06:24 - see we have the data type as bullan and
06:26 - the value of Str Str is true now
06:28 - similarly we can can also provide the
06:30 - value as false over here let me just
06:32 - save this file now again the data type
06:34 - will be bullan this time and that is how
06:36 - you can either use the true or false
06:39 - values for the Boolean data type it
06:41 - becomes very important to use the
06:42 - Boolean data type whenever you are using
06:44 - the conditional statements we also have
06:46 - something called as undefined data type
06:49 - so let us say you have not provided any
06:51 - value to this particular variable so
06:52 - simply we will provide semicolon over
06:54 - here and we are getting the error const
06:57 - to declarations must be initialized so
06:59 - guys basically let us change this to the
07:01 - let keyword so that we want to test the
07:04 - undefined data type over here so
07:06 - basically we have not provided any value
07:08 - this time so guys by default when there
07:10 - is no value that is assigned to this
07:12 - particular variable the data type of
07:14 - this variable will be undefined over
07:16 - here and the value will be also
07:18 - undefined so let us check that as well
07:20 - let me just save this file now and try
07:22 - running this code once again over here
07:24 - as you can see the data type it is equal
07:26 - to undefined and also the value that we
07:29 - have have provided for the Str Str
07:31 - variable is undefined over here so
07:33 - basically the meaning of undefined is we
07:35 - have not provided any value to the
07:37 - variable yet and it will have certain
07:40 - value in future based on the
07:41 - calculations that we are going to do
07:43 - based on the calculations or the
07:45 - Expressions that we are going to use
07:47 - along with this particular variable now
07:49 - guys apart from this we also have
07:50 - something called as null over here so we
07:53 - can simply provide the null value over
07:55 - here so let us see what will be the
07:56 - output so basically on the right hand
07:58 - side we have provided the null value for
08:00 - this particular variable let me just
08:02 - save this file now and try running this
08:04 - code once again over here so as you can
08:06 - see the data type it is equal to object
08:08 - for this particular null value and the
08:10 - value of St Str it is null so guys in
08:13 - this way you can use the null value as
08:15 - well for a particular variable there is
08:17 - another data type that is symbol which
08:19 - we are going to see in the upcoming
08:21 - videos as well and another very
08:22 - important data type is object in which
08:25 - there are multiple other data types that
08:27 - we can Define such as array and then map
08:29 - set date promises and also the custom
08:32 - objects that we are going to create in
08:34 - the upcoming videos so guys basically
08:36 - all these data types belong to the main
08:39 - data type that is object over here so
08:41 - how do we Define an array so basically
08:43 - array is nothing but the list of
08:45 - elements the list can be of the integer
08:48 - that is the number data type or it can
08:50 - be of the string data type as well or it
08:52 - can also be the big integers as well so
08:55 - in short it is going to be the list of
08:57 - all the elements that we are going to
08:59 - Define inside the array so guys how do
09:01 - we Define the array over here simply we
09:03 - declare the variable over here and then
09:05 - after the equal to operator inside the
09:08 - open and close square brackets we need
09:10 - to provide the list of all the elements
09:12 - so let's say the first element is one
09:14 - over here we want to define the list of
09:16 - numbers in this case followed by comma
09:19 - and then we have to provide the second
09:21 - element that is two in this case and
09:22 - Then followed by comma then 3 4 and so
09:25 - on so guys basically whatever number of
09:28 - elements you provide over here
09:29 - those elements must be separated by
09:31 - using the comma in this case and in this
09:34 - way you can Define the array that is the
09:36 - list of elements which will be of the
09:38 - data type object over here so guys as
09:41 - you can see we have five number of
09:42 - elements over here let us see what will
09:44 - be the output for the data type and the
09:47 - value of this variable so let me just
09:49 - save this file now and try running this
09:51 - code once again over here as you can see
09:53 - data type it is equal to object this
09:55 - time because arrays are of the data type
09:58 - object in Javas scrip and then apart
10:00 - from this we can also get the value of
10:02 - Str Str it is 1 2 3 4 5 now guys apart
10:05 - from this we can also provide the list
10:08 - of strings over here so let us say we
10:10 - want to provide the list of fruits in
10:12 - this case so simply we will provide the
10:14 - variable name as fruits over here and
10:17 - instead of having the St Str variable in
10:19 - the console. log statement we have
10:21 - provided the variable name as fruits now
10:24 - guys over here let us say the first
10:25 - fruit is Apple over here then followed
10:28 - by comma and then the second fruit is
10:30 - mango and so on we can provide the
10:32 - values of other fruits as well so we
10:34 - have watermelon as the third fruit and
10:37 - then let us say we have another fruit
10:38 - that is orange over here so guys
10:40 - basically it is nothing but the list of
10:42 - fruits that we have defined inside the
10:45 - open and close square brackets over here
10:47 - which is nothing but the array in
10:48 - JavaScript now guys let me just save
10:50 - this file now and try running this code
10:52 - once again over here as you can see we
10:54 - have the data type it is equal to object
10:56 - once again and the value of Str Str
10:58 - which means the value of fruits over
11:00 - here you can see that the value is apple
11:02 - mango watermelon and orange so guys over
11:05 - here we have the value of fruits that we
11:07 - have already defined in our code so guys
11:10 - in this way the arrays are nothing but
11:12 - the of the data type object over here
11:14 - apart from this we can also Define the
11:15 - date as well so we can get the current
11:18 - date of the system so what we will do is
11:20 - let us say we Define the date variable
11:22 - over here simply we need to use the new
11:25 - keyword in order to get the current date
11:27 - and then over here we need to make use
11:30 - of this date class in this case so guys
11:32 - after this we have to use the open and
11:34 - close parenthesis so guys in this way we
11:36 - can get the current date of the system
11:38 - so over here what we will do is we will
11:40 - replace the variable name that is fruits
11:42 - by date over here so simply we have
11:44 - value of date and then the date will be
11:46 - displayed let me just save this file now
11:48 - and try running this code once again
11:50 - over here as you can see the data type
11:52 - of date is object once again and the
11:55 - value of date is so and so that is
11:57 - getting displayed over here apart from
11:59 - this we can simply get the RS as well so
12:02 - currently it is
12:03 - 1653 over here so the r is 16 in this
12:06 - case so simply for this date variable we
12:09 - can provide Dot and then as you can see
12:11 - we have multiple other methods that you
12:13 - can use basically you can simply get the
12:15 - date as well and then we have the day
12:18 - then we have the full year then we have
12:19 - hours milliseconds minutes and so on so
12:23 - over here we have the requirement of
12:24 - getting the RS in this case so we use
12:27 - this particular method followed by open
12:29 - and close parenthesis so guys it is
12:31 - important to note that whenever we are
12:33 - going to use the method over here we
12:35 - have to provide the open and close
12:36 - parenthesis in this case so let me just
12:39 - save this file now and try running this
12:40 - code once again over here as you can see
12:43 - data type is object and the value of
12:45 - date which means the r is 16 over here
12:48 - we can simply get the date as well so we
12:50 - have the get date method so let me just
12:52 - save this file now so today's date is
12:55 - 4th over here and that is what is
12:57 - getting printed apart from this you can
12:58 - also print the month and the year as
13:01 - well so guys comment in the comment
13:02 - section below what will be the output if
13:04 - you provide the date. getet full year
13:07 - over here let us see whether your answer
13:09 - is correct or not so guys based on the
13:11 - year in which you are going to execute
13:13 - this particular line of code you will
13:15 - get a different output on the console
13:18 - and the same you can comment in the
13:19 - comment section below please make sure
13:21 - that you like this video so that it
13:22 - reaches to more people and subscribe to
13:24 - this channel so that you get the
13:25 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
13:28 - I'll see you in the next video in which
13:29 - we are going to see if and else
13:31 - conditional statements in JavaScript so
13:34 - stay tuned

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see data types in JavaScript so guys basically JavaScript has eight data types as you can see the first data type is the string data type that we have already seen previously next we have the number data type in which we can have the integers or the float numbers as well along with the decimal point apart from this we also have the big int data type in which case if any of the values cannot be represented by the number such as the very big numbers then we can use the big int data type over here apart from this we also have the bullan data type which is having only two values that is true and false and then we also have the undefined data type followed by the null data type and then we have the symbol and the object data types as well so guys let us check this with the help of examples in vs code over here so first of all we will see how we can Define the variable with the string data type so over here we will provide the variable name as Str Str and as we have discussed previously whatever value we provide in between the double codes or the single code or the back tick as well those values are represented as string in JavaScript so guys over here let us provide programming for beginners that is the name of this YouTube channel which you should definitely subscribe if you have not done so so basically we have this value as the string data type over here so the Str Str variable is now of the data type string in this case based on the value that we have provided so let us confirm that as well we will simply provide the type of character in inside the console. log statement and then we will provide the variable name apart from this we also want to print the variable value so simply we will say back text and then inside this we will say value of St Str is and Then followed by dollar and then inside the open and close curly braces we will provide the name of the variable that is St Str in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code on the terminal so we will say node followed by the name of the JavaScript file that is test.js over here so as you can see we are getting the string as the output for this type of operator when we check the data type of this particular variable so basically the stdr variable is of the string data type over here apart from this the value of St Str is programming for beginners so you can see that this is the string that is getting printed over here so guys in this way this is the first data type that you can use in JavaScript apart from this when you say number basically on the right hand side you only have to provide the value of the number over here so let's say we provide the value as 10 in this case so guys basically since we are not using any double quotes or single quote over here based on the value of the variable the data type will be assigned to this particular variable so now Str Str will be having the data type of number so let us check that as well so over here we will also provide the string so that we can understand that this is the data type over here so guys basically we have data type followed by colon and then we are using the plus operator and then we are using the type of operator in order to get the data type of this particular variable let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see now the data type it is equal to number this time that's because we have provided the value as number over here and the value of Str Str is 10 so guys basically we have not changed the variable name over here but we are simply changing the value So based on the value of the variable the data type will be assigned to that particular variable let us say we provide certain decimal point over here and after that we provide the number that is 35 which means 10.35 is the number so basically this is the float number which belongs to the number data type over here when we save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see data type it is equal to number again and the value of Str Str it is 10.35 so guys whether it is integers or the floating Point numbers with the decimal point all those numbers will be belong to the number data type and based on your requirements you can provide the values for these variables now guys apart from this how do we Define the big int over here so let us say we have a very big number in this case so let me just print a very big number over here so as you can see we have a very big number on the right hand side so let us see how this number will be printed on the console there is certain warning that is coming over here numeric literals with absolute values equal to 2 ra to the power of 53 or greater are too large to be represented accurately as integers so guys basically it is giving a certain kind of information over here that this is belonging to a big integer but still let us see how the number will be printed on the console so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here so as you can see the data type is still number because we are not using the big integer over here in order to convert this particular value into a big integer so basically the data type is number and the value of this St are it is 1.23 and so on basically e ra to the power of 30 is being used over here in order to represent the number but guys let us say you want to print this exact number on the terminal so what you can do is simply you can use the big int over here so basically this is the class that is big int that you have to use and when you use this you need to provide the data inside the double codes which needs to be enclosed between the open and close parenthesis over here so as you can see we have the big end and then we have the open parenthesis followed by the double codes and then the entire number that is present inside this double code and then we have the closed parenthesis over here so let me just save this file now and let us see what will be the output over here on the terminal so as you can see we are getting the data type it is equal to Big int over here and the value of St Str it is the big number that we have already provided in our code in this case so guys basically if you want to use this big number and want to represent it as the big in over here you can use this big int prefix over here and then you need to enclose this entire number within the parenthesis now guys apart from this you can also use the Boolean data type as well so basically it is going to have either true or false value so when we say true in this case it is a keyword that is reserved by JavaScript over here so let me just save this file now let us see the data type and the value of this True Value so as you can see we have the data type as bullan and the value of Str Str is true now similarly we can can also provide the value as false over here let me just save this file now again the data type will be bullan this time and that is how you can either use the true or false values for the Boolean data type it becomes very important to use the Boolean data type whenever you are using the conditional statements we also have something called as undefined data type so let us say you have not provided any value to this particular variable so simply we will provide semicolon over here and we are getting the error const to declarations must be initialized so guys basically let us change this to the let keyword so that we want to test the undefined data type over here so basically we have not provided any value this time so guys by default when there is no value that is assigned to this particular variable the data type of this variable will be undefined over here and the value will be also undefined so let us check that as well let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see the data type it is equal to undefined and also the value that we have have provided for the Str Str variable is undefined over here so basically the meaning of undefined is we have not provided any value to the variable yet and it will have certain value in future based on the calculations that we are going to do based on the calculations or the Expressions that we are going to use along with this particular variable now guys apart from this we also have something called as null over here so we can simply provide the null value over here so let us see what will be the output so basically on the right hand side we have provided the null value for this particular variable let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here so as you can see the data type it is equal to object for this particular null value and the value of St Str it is null so guys in this way you can use the null value as well for a particular variable there is another data type that is symbol which we are going to see in the upcoming videos as well and another very important data type is object in which there are multiple other data types that we can Define such as array and then map set date promises and also the custom objects that we are going to create in the upcoming videos so guys basically all these data types belong to the main data type that is object over here so how do we Define an array so basically array is nothing but the list of elements the list can be of the integer that is the number data type or it can be of the string data type as well or it can also be the big integers as well so in short it is going to be the list of all the elements that we are going to Define inside the array so guys how do we Define the array over here simply we declare the variable over here and then after the equal to operator inside the open and close square brackets we need to provide the list of all the elements so let's say the first element is one over here we want to define the list of numbers in this case followed by comma and then we have to provide the second element that is two in this case and Then followed by comma then 3 4 and so on so guys basically whatever number of elements you provide over here those elements must be separated by using the comma in this case and in this way you can Define the array that is the list of elements which will be of the data type object over here so guys as you can see we have five number of elements over here let us see what will be the output for the data type and the value of this variable so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see data type it is equal to object this time because arrays are of the data type object in Javas scrip and then apart from this we can also get the value of Str Str it is 1 2 3 4 5 now guys apart from this we can also provide the list of strings over here so let us say we want to provide the list of fruits in this case so simply we will provide the variable name as fruits over here and instead of having the St Str variable in the console. log statement we have provided the variable name as fruits now guys over here let us say the first fruit is Apple over here then followed by comma and then the second fruit is mango and so on we can provide the values of other fruits as well so we have watermelon as the third fruit and then let us say we have another fruit that is orange over here so guys basically it is nothing but the list of fruits that we have defined inside the open and close square brackets over here which is nothing but the array in JavaScript now guys let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see we have the data type it is equal to object once again and the value of Str Str which means the value of fruits over here you can see that the value is apple mango watermelon and orange so guys over here we have the value of fruits that we have already defined in our code so guys in this way the arrays are nothing but the of the data type object over here apart from this we can also Define the date as well so we can get the current date of the system so what we will do is let us say we Define the date variable over here simply we need to use the new keyword in order to get the current date and then over here we need to make use of this date class in this case so guys after this we have to use the open and close parenthesis so guys in this way we can get the current date of the system so over here what we will do is we will replace the variable name that is fruits by date over here so simply we have value of date and then the date will be displayed let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see the data type of date is object once again and the value of date is so and so that is getting displayed over here apart from this we can simply get the RS as well so currently it is 1653 over here so the r is 16 in this case so simply for this date variable we can provide Dot and then as you can see we have multiple other methods that you can use basically you can simply get the date as well and then we have the day then we have the full year then we have hours milliseconds minutes and so on so over here we have the requirement of getting the RS in this case so we use this particular method followed by open and close parenthesis so guys it is important to note that whenever we are going to use the method over here we have to provide the open and close parenthesis in this case so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see data type is object and the value of date which means the r is 16 over here we can simply get the date as well so we have the get date method so let me just save this file now so today's date is 4th over here and that is what is getting printed apart from this you can also print the month and the year as well so guys comment in the comment section below what will be the output if you provide the date. getet full year over here let us see whether your answer is correct or not so guys based on the year in which you are going to execute this particular line of code you will get a different output on the console and the same you can comment in the comment section below please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well I'll see you in the next video in which we are going to see if and else conditional statements in JavaScript so stay tuned
