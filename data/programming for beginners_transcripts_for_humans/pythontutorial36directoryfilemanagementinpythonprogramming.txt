00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to learn
00:03 - about directory and file management in
00:05 - Python Programming so guys our directory
00:08 - is a collection of files and sub
00:10 - directories so basically a directory
00:12 - inside another directory is known as a
00:15 - subdirectory over here and python has
00:17 - the OS module that provides us with many
00:20 - useful methods to work with directories
00:23 - and files as well so this we are going
00:25 - to check with the help of examples as
00:26 - well it is very important to note that
00:29 - over here we have a very important
00:31 - module that is OS so this package we are
00:33 - going to import in the python code so
00:36 - first of all we are going to check how
00:37 - do we get the current directory in
00:39 - Python by using the get CWD method
00:43 - inside this OS module so let us move to
00:45 - the vs code over here so the very first
00:47 - thing that we have to do is we have to
00:49 - import the OS module so once we have
00:52 - imported the OS module we can simply
00:54 - print the current working directory so
00:57 - over here we have the print statement
00:58 - followed by inside the parenthesis we
01:01 - will use this OS followed by Dot and
01:04 - then we have the get CWD that is the
01:07 - method in order to get the current
01:09 - working directory over here so let me
01:11 - just save this file now and try running
01:12 - this code it will print the current
01:14 - working directory as you can see it is
01:16 - inside the C drive followed by the users
01:18 - and then we have the user folder
01:20 - followed by the python so this is the
01:22 - directory in which this particular code
01:24 - is present as you can see over here we
01:27 - can see the entire path that is users
01:29 - user and then Python and inside this
01:31 - python folder we have this file that is
01:33 - python underscore code so this is the
01:36 - very simple method in order to get the
01:38 - current working directory in Python
01:40 - programming language now let us move to
01:42 - another task now how do we change the
01:44 - directory in the python so we have
01:46 - something called as chtir this is
01:48 - another method followed by we have to
01:51 - provide the path as the parameter to
01:53 - this particular function so what we will
01:55 - do is let us say we have this particular
01:57 - directory over here I am going to copy
01:59 - this and we are going to change the
02:02 - current working directory to this
02:03 - particular directory path that we have
02:06 - just copied so what we will do is before
02:08 - this line of code which gets us the
02:10 - current working directory we will change
02:12 - the current working directory over here
02:13 - so again we are going to use the OS
02:16 - module name followed by Dot and then we
02:18 - have something called as chtir so as you
02:21 - can see this is the method that we can
02:23 - use and then inside this we have to
02:26 - provide the path of the directory to
02:28 - which we want to change the directory so
02:30 - basically I'm going to paste this and
02:32 - this is the path that we are going to
02:33 - change the directory to so let me just
02:35 - save this file now and try running this
02:37 - code so as you can see we are getting
02:39 - some error over here Unicode Escape
02:41 - codec can't decode bytes in position two
02:44 - three so what we have to do is we have
02:46 - to escape these backslashes over here so
02:48 - I am providing another backslash
02:50 - character over here on all the instances
02:52 - of the backslash characters so let me
02:55 - just save this file now and try running
02:56 - this code so as you can see after
02:58 - changing the directory I am once and in
03:00 - getting the current working directory
03:02 - over here by calling this get CWD method
03:05 - and then you can see this that is the
03:07 - entire path that we have changed the
03:09 - directory to that path is getting
03:11 - printed on the console right now so guys
03:13 - this is the way that we can easily
03:14 - change the directory to any directory
03:16 - that we want now let us move to another
03:18 - task over here how do we list the
03:20 - directories and files in Python so what
03:23 - we are going to do is let us list all
03:25 - the subdirectories and the files that
03:27 - are present in a particular directory so
03:29 - I am going to move one stage back over
03:30 - here so as you can see inside the
03:32 - languages we have dot Java and python so
03:35 - we want to list down all the
03:37 - subdirectories over here so how do we do
03:39 - that we have something called as list
03:41 - dir method that will help us in order to
03:44 - list all the directories and the files
03:45 - so over here in the vs code what I will
03:48 - do is I'll go one step behind so we are
03:50 - going to remove this python we have to
03:52 - go up to the languages part and then
03:54 - after this what we will do is we will
03:57 - simply print the directory list so over
03:59 - here here we have OS followed by Dot and
04:02 - then we have list directory so as you
04:04 - can see we have used the chdir method in
04:07 - order to change the directory and inside
04:09 - that directory I want to list all the
04:12 - subdirectories over here and this should
04:14 - be followed by the open and close
04:15 - parenthesis because this is a function
04:17 - so let me just save this file now and
04:19 - try running this code so as you can see
04:21 - we are getting dot Java and then python
04:24 - so Guys these are the subfolders that
04:26 - are present inside this directory that
04:28 - is Dart Java and python let us move one
04:30 - step behind once again over here we can
04:33 - see programming for beginners and there
04:35 - are multiple subdirectories and files as
04:37 - well so what we can do is over here I'll
04:40 - just move one step back I'll just remove
04:42 - these languages part over here and then
04:44 - let me just save this file now and try
04:45 - running this code as you can see we are
04:47 - getting all the files in subdirectories
04:49 - we have description python.txt then
04:52 - description.txt then these are the
04:54 - subdirectories without any extensions
04:56 - over here then we have thumbnails one
04:58 - thumbnails one dot PPT which is a
05:00 - PowerPoint presentation we have videos
05:02 - and then the YouTube channel as well
05:04 - which are sub directories next let us
05:06 - move to another task so over here as you
05:09 - can see making a new directory in Python
05:11 - so how we can do that by using the mktir
05:14 - method so basically this is another
05:16 - method inside the OS module so in order
05:19 - to make a new directory what we will do
05:21 - is again we will go to our original
05:23 - directory path over here I'll just copy
05:25 - this and paste this over here inside the
05:27 - code so we'll just paste this over here
05:30 - in order to change the directory and
05:32 - I'll just Escape these backslashes so we
05:35 - just need to provide another backslash
05:37 - character in order to escape them so we
05:40 - have escaped all the instances of the
05:42 - backslash characters over here so
05:44 - basically first of all we are changing
05:45 - the directory and inside this directory
05:48 - now after this folder over here that is
05:50 - python which is having just three files
05:53 - over here we are going to create a
05:54 - subdirectory so basically in our code
05:57 - what we will do is over here instead of
05:59 - print statement we have the OS followed
06:02 - by Dot and then we have m k d i r so
06:06 - this method is being suggested by the vs
06:07 - code and over here inside the
06:09 - parenthesis it is going to take the
06:11 - parameter which is going to be the name
06:13 - of the sub directory so we are going to
06:15 - provide the name as the test so let me
06:17 - just save this file now and try running
06:18 - this code
06:20 - so over here nothing is being displayed
06:22 - over here that's because we have not
06:24 - provided any of the print statements but
06:26 - over here if we come to our directory as
06:28 - you can see it has created a new sub
06:31 - directory that is test over here which
06:32 - is going to be an empty subdirectory so
06:35 - it doesn't have any directory or files
06:37 - over here so basically this is the way
06:39 - that we can create the subdirectories
06:41 - now let us move to another task over
06:43 - here how do we rename a directory or a
06:46 - file so basically we can use the rename
06:48 - method that is the rename function
06:50 - inside the OS module and provide the
06:52 - first parameter as the old name which is
06:55 - the existing name and the second
06:56 - parameter is the new name that we want
06:58 - to rename it to so let us move to the vs
07:01 - code over here what we will do is we
07:03 - have already created the directory so
07:05 - I'll just remove this line of code and
07:07 - then we will say OS followed by Dot and
07:10 - then we have something called as rename
07:11 - method so this method takes two
07:13 - parameters the first parameter is the
07:16 - name of the directory or the file that
07:17 - we want to change the name of so let us
07:19 - say I just copied this directory name
07:22 - that is test over here and then I'll
07:24 - just paste this over here so we have
07:26 - test and then let's say we want to
07:27 - rename it to test one so I'll just
07:30 - provide test one over here so this test
07:32 - should be renamed to test one and then
07:35 - as a confirmation I'll just provide the
07:37 - print statement and then we will say the
07:40 - name
07:41 - successful and then let me just save
07:44 - this file now and try running this code
07:46 - as you can see rename successfully is
07:48 - already printed over here if we go to
07:50 - our directory as you can see test one is
07:52 - being displayed over here so the
07:54 - directory name which was named as test
07:56 - previously has been renamed to test one
07:59 - over here so guys this is the way that
08:00 - we can rename a particular directory in
08:03 - the same way we can rename the file
08:05 - names as well now let us move to another
08:06 - task over here how do we remove a
08:09 - directory or a file in Python so we can
08:11 - simply use the rmdir method in order to
08:14 - remove the directory and remove method
08:17 - in order to remove the file name so this
08:19 - method that is remove in order to delete
08:21 - the file I'll leave it up to you as a
08:23 - homework for you so that you can
08:24 - practice on your own and comment in the
08:26 - comment section below whether you were
08:28 - successfully able to delete the file in
08:30 - this example we are going to remove the
08:32 - directory that we have just created so
08:34 - we are going to remove this test One
08:36 - Directory so what we have to do is I'll
08:38 - just remove this line of code and then
08:40 - we will say oh is followed by Dot and
08:43 - then we have rmdir method and then
08:46 - inside this it takes the parameter as
08:48 - the name of the subdirectory that we
08:50 - want to remove so we will say test one
08:53 - over here and then as a confirmation we
08:55 - will say delete successful so let me
08:58 - just save this file now and try running
08:59 - this code as you can see delete
09:01 - successful is printed and when we move
09:03 - to the directory as you can see the test
09:05 - one directory that we had created is no
09:07 - longer existing right now so basically
09:09 - we have successfully deleted the
09:11 - directory in the same way you can delete
09:13 - the files as well by using the remove
09:15 - method which is the homework for you so
09:17 - guys practice on your own sources on
09:19 - different inputs you get different
09:20 - outputs we have seen a lot of functions
09:22 - that is present inside the OS module
09:24 - apart from this you can also provide the
09:27 - OS module over here followed by Dot and
09:30 - you can see there are many other methods
09:31 - that we have not covered but you can
09:33 - practice on your own so that based on
09:35 - your requirements you can use them in
09:37 - order to accomplish your task so guys
09:39 - that's it in this video please make sure
09:40 - that you like this video so that it
09:42 - reaches to more people and subscribe to
09:44 - this channel so that you get the
09:45 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
09:47 - the next video that we are going to talk
09:49 - about is exceptions in Python
09:51 - Programming so stay tuned

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about directory and file management in Python Programming so guys our directory is a collection of files and sub directories so basically a directory inside another directory is known as a subdirectory over here and python has the OS module that provides us with many useful methods to work with directories and files as well so this we are going to check with the help of examples as well it is very important to note that over here we have a very important module that is OS so this package we are going to import in the python code so first of all we are going to check how do we get the current directory in Python by using the get CWD method inside this OS module so let us move to the vs code over here so the very

followed by inside the parenthesis we will use this OS followed by Dot and then we have the get CWD that is the method in order to get the current working directory over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code it will print the current working directory as you can see it is inside the C drive followed by the users and then we have the user folder followed by the python so this is the directory in which this particular code is present as you can see over here we can see the entire path that is users user and then Python and inside this python folder we have this file that is python underscore code so this is the very simple method in order to get the current working directory in Python programming language now let us move to another task now how do we change the directory in the python so we have something called as chtir this is another method followed by we have to provide the path as the parameter to this particular function so what we will do is let us say we have this particular directory over here I am going to copy this and we are going to change the current working directory to this particular directory path that we have just copied so what we will do is before this line of code which gets us the current working directory we will change the current working directory over here so again we are going to use the OS module name followed by Dot and then we have something called as chtir so as you can see this is the method that we can use and then inside this we have to provide the path of the directory to which we want to change the directory so basically I'm going to paste this and this is the path that we are going to change the directory to so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting some error over here Unicode Escape codec can't decode bytes in position two three so what we have to do is we have to escape these backslashes over here so I am providing another backslash

save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting dot Java and then python so Guys these are the subfolders that are present inside this directory that is Dart Java and python let us move one step behind once again over here we can see programming for beginners and there are multiple subdirectories and files as well so what we can do is over here I'll just move one step back I'll just remove these languages part over here and then let me just save this file now and try running this code as you can see we are getting all the files in subdirectories we have description python.txt then description.txt then these are the subdirectories without any extensions over here then we have thumbnails one thumbnails one dot PPT which is a PowerPoint presentation we have videos and then the YouTube channel as well which are sub directories next let us move to another task so over here as you can see making a new directory in Python so how we can do that by using the mktir method so basically this is another method inside the OS module so in order to make a new directory what we will do is again we will go to our original directory path over here I'll just

now after this folder over here that is python which is having just three files over here we are going to create a subdirectory so basically in our code what we will do is over here instead of print

going to be the name of the sub directory so we are going to provide the name as the test so let me just save this file now and try running this code so over here nothing is being displayed over here that's because we have not provided any of the print statements but over here if we come to our directory as you can see it has created a new sub directory that is test over here which is going to be an empty subdirectory so it doesn't have any directory or files over here so basically this is the way that we can create the subdirectories now let us move to another task over here how do we rename

change the name of so let us say I just copied this directory name that is test over here and then I'll just paste this over here so we have test and then let's say we want to rename it to test one so I'll just provide test one over here so this test should be renamed to test one and then as a confirmation I'll just provide the print statement and then we will say the name successful and then let me just save this file now and try running this code as you can see rename successfully is already printed over here if we go to our directory as you can see test one is being displayed over here so the directory name which was named as test previously has been renamed to test one over here so guys this is the way that we can rename a particular directory in the same way we can rename the file names as well now let us move to another task over here how do we remove a directory or a file in Python so we can simply use the rmdir method in order to remove the directory and remove method in order to remove the file name so this method that is remove in order to delete the file I'll leave it up to you as a homework for you so that you can practice on your own and comment in the comment section below whether you were successfully able to delete the file in this example we are going to remove the directory that we have just created so we are going to remove this test One Directory so what we have to do is I'll just remove this line of code and then we will say oh is followed by Dot and then we have rmdir method and then inside this it takes the parameter as the name of the subdirectory that we want to remove so we will say test one over here and then as a confirmation we will say delete successful so let me just save this file now and try running this code as you can see delete successful is printed and when we move to the directory as you can see the test one directory that we had created is no longer existing right now so basically we have successfully deleted the directory in the same way you can delete the files as well by using the remove method which is the homework for you so guys practice on your own sources on different inputs you get different outputs we have seen a lot of functions that is present inside the OS module apart from this you can also provide the OS module over here followed by Dot and you can see there are many other methods that we have not covered but you can practice on your own so that based on your requirements you can use them in order to accomplish your task so guys that's it in this video please make sure that you

exceptions in Python Programming so stay tuned
