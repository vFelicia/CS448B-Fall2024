With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will work on an exercise in
00:02 - order to greet the person based on the
00:04 - time in JavaScript so guys basically in
00:07 - this particular exercise we will get the
00:09 - current time of the system using the
00:11 - JavaScript date object and then we will
00:13 - greet the person with the good morning
00:16 - or the good afternoon message over here
00:18 - so guys let us move to the vs code in
00:20 - this case so what we will do is first of
00:22 - all we will Define the variable that is
00:24 - date over here so simply we are going to
00:26 - get the current system date in this case
00:29 - so we have new keyword over here as you
00:31 - can see after the equal to operator we
00:34 - use the new keyword followed by the
00:35 - space character and then we use the date
00:38 - class in this case so basically this is
00:40 - the date class that is responsible in
00:42 - order to get the current system date
00:44 - over here and then after this what we
00:46 - will do is let us verify what we are
00:48 - getting inside the date variable so
00:51 - simply we are printing the date variable
00:53 - over here let me just save this file now
00:55 - and try running this code using the node
00:57 - keyword over here followed by the name
00:59 - of the file that is test.js so guys as
01:02 - you can see we are getting the year
01:04 - followed by the month and then we are
01:06 - getting the date as well and then we are
01:07 - getting the time as well over here so
01:09 - guys as you can see we are getting the
01:11 - complete date and time by using this
01:13 - particular date class over here now guys
01:15 - what we have to do is we need to extract
01:17 - the hour using this particular date that
01:19 - is getting printed so simply we will
01:22 - Define another variable that is r in
01:24 - this case and Then followed by the equal
01:26 - to operator this time we will use this
01:28 - particular variable that is is date
01:30 - inside which we already have the current
01:32 - date and time of the system and then
01:34 - followed by Dot and then as you can see
01:36 - we have multiple methods over here we
01:38 - have the get date method then we have
01:40 - get day get full year get hours get
01:43 - milliseconds and so on we have multiple
01:45 - methods that you can use so guys
01:47 - currently we are concerned about the
01:49 - hour of this particular time so what we
01:51 - can do is simply we can use the get
01:53 - hours over here and then followed by the
01:55 - open and close parenthesis since it is a
01:57 - method so guys now let us see what will
01:59 - be the the hour that is getting printed
02:01 - over here so simply we will provide the
02:03 - console.log statement and then we will
02:05 - print the hour let me just save this
02:07 - file now and try running this code so as
02:09 - you can see the hour is converted to the
02:11 - local time over here and we are getting
02:13 - the 17 hour in this case so guys this is
02:16 - the way that we can get the current hour
02:18 - over here of the system now guys what we
02:20 - will do is we will provide our logic in
02:22 - order to print whether it is a good
02:24 - morning message or the good afternoon
02:26 - message that is supposed to be printed
02:28 - so what we will do is first of all we
02:29 - will will check whether the hour is it
02:31 - less than or equal to 12 so guys over
02:33 - here since we are following the 24hour
02:36 - format if it is morning then the hour
02:38 - must be less than or equal to 12 over
02:40 - here so basically after the 12th hour
02:43 - the afternoon will start so simply we
02:45 - will say hour is it less than or equal
02:47 - to 12 if yes then simply we will provide
02:50 - the console.log statement and then we
02:52 - will provide good morning message in
02:54 - this case so guys basically we have this
02:56 - particular message that will be printed
02:58 - if the hour is less than or equal equal
03:00 - to 12 and if not then the good afternoon
03:02 - message must be printed so over here
03:04 - simply we will provide the else part in
03:06 - this case and then we will say
03:08 - console.log and this time we will have
03:10 - good afternoon that is getting printed
03:12 - over here on the console so guys
03:14 - basically this is the message that is
03:16 - getting printed over here let us save
03:18 - this file now and try running this code
03:20 - once again over here as you can see good
03:22 - afternoon message is getting printed
03:23 - that's because the current hour it is 17
03:26 - over here let us also print the current
03:28 - R in this case so simply we will have
03:30 - the console. log statement and then we
03:33 - will say current R it is equal to and
03:36 - then simply we will provide dollar
03:38 - followed by open and close curly presses
03:40 - and then we will provide R in this case
03:42 - let me just save this file now and try
03:44 - running this code once again over here
03:46 - as you can see current R it is equal to
03:48 - 17 and then we are getting good
03:50 - afternoon message over here now guys let
03:52 - us say if the r is 12 so what will be
03:54 - the output so simply what we will do is
03:56 - we will override the value of R in this
03:58 - case so even after getting the r over
04:01 - here as the value of 17 we are changing
04:03 - the r value over here so what we will
04:05 - set it as we will set it as 12 in this
04:08 - case in such a way that the good morning
04:10 - message must be displayed so let me just
04:12 - save this file now and try running this
04:13 - code once again over here as you can see
04:16 - current hour it is equal to 12 in this
04:18 - case and then we have the good morning
04:20 - message that is getting printed over
04:22 - here so guys based on the date time and
04:24 - the hour during which you execute this
04:26 - particular JavaScript program the good
04:29 - morning or the good afternoon message
04:30 - will be printed over here let us put
04:33 - another condition in this case so let us
04:35 - say if the hour is less than 16 over
04:38 - here so basically we are setting another
04:40 - parameter in this case so we have less
04:42 - than or equal to 16 this time and if the
04:45 - r is greater than 16 which means whether
04:47 - it is 17 or 18 we want to print the good
04:49 - evening message over here so simply we
04:52 - will have the lse part and then we will
04:53 - say console. log statement and then
04:56 - inside this we will say good evening
04:58 - message so guys over here the good
05:00 - morning message will be printed when the
05:02 - r is less than or equal to 12 then when
05:04 - the r is less than or equal to 16 the
05:06 - good afternoon message will be printed
05:08 - and if the r is greater than 16 over
05:10 - here the good evening message must be
05:12 - printed so let me just save this file
05:14 - now and try running this code once again
05:16 - over here as you can see current R it is
05:18 - equal to 17 this time which is the
05:20 - evening time so basically we are getting
05:23 - good evening message over here on the
05:24 - console so guys in this way you can get
05:26 - the current system date and time by
05:28 - using the date class over here and then
05:31 - you can print the greeting message based
05:33 - on the project requirement so guys
05:34 - comment in the comment section below
05:36 - what is the current date and time
05:38 - currently when you are running this code
05:40 - over here while you're watching this

05:48 - upcoming videos as well I'll see you in
05:50 - the next video in which we are going to
05:52 - talk about the turnar operator in

guys basically this is the message that is getting printed over here let us save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see good afternoon message is getting printed that's because the current hour it is 17 over here let us also print the current R in this case so simply we will have the console. log statement and then we will say current R it is equal to and then simply we will provide dollar followed by open and close curly presses and then we will provide R in this case let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can

so guys in this way you can get the current system date and time by using the date class over here and then you can print the greeting message based on the project requirement so guys comment in the comment section below what is the current date and time currently when you are running this code over here while you're watching this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches
