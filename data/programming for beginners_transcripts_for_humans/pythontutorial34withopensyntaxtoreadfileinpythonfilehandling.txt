00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to learn
00:03 - about with open syntax to read the file
00:06 - in Python Programming so guys in Python
00:09 - we can use the with open syntax to
00:11 - automatically close the file and as you
00:13 - can see in this example we have the
00:15 - syntax that is first of all we have the
00:17 - with keyword followed by the open
00:19 - function and then we have the path of
00:22 - the file along with the file name and
00:24 - then the second parameter is the read
00:26 - mode of the file and then we have the as
00:29 - keyword over here followed by the
00:31 - variable name and then after this colon
00:33 - we can read the content by using the
00:35 - read method and then we can simply Print
00:37 - it Now guys the advantage of using this
00:40 - with open syntax in order to read the
00:43 - content of the file is that it
00:45 - automatically closes the file so
00:47 - previously we had seen that by using
00:49 - these four lines of code we can simply
00:51 - open the file read the content and print
00:54 - the content over here and this fourth
00:56 - line over here that is close method was
00:58 - used in order to close the file that we
01:01 - had opened but this is not required if
01:04 - we are using the with open syntax so let
01:06 - us check this with the help of example
01:08 - now over here I'll just clear these
01:10 - lines of code and simply we will provide
01:12 - the width keyword first followed by open
01:15 - function and then we have the open and
01:18 - close parenthesis and inside this we
01:20 - have to provide the path of the file
01:22 - that we want to read so we are going to
01:24 - read the same file that we had used
01:26 - previously that is the test file so
01:28 - first of all we have to provide the
01:30 - directory paths over here I'll just copy
01:32 - the directory path over here and paste
01:35 - this over here and then we have the file
01:37 - name to be read so I'll just copy this
01:40 - file name and paste this over here
01:42 - followed by dot txt now guys it is very
01:45 - important that we have the double slash
01:46 - characters in order to avoid any of the
01:49 - issues that might occur due to the
01:51 - Escape characters so over here I am just
01:54 - providing the double backslash
01:55 - characters at every instance inside the
01:58 - directory path and then after this this
02:01 - is the first parameter which is the path
02:03 - of the file that we want to read and the
02:05 - second parameter that we have is the
02:07 - mode in which we want to open the file
02:09 - so we provide R in this case so this
02:12 - means that we are opening the file in
02:14 - the read mode and then guys after this
02:16 - after this open function we have the as
02:19 - keyword and Then followed by the
02:21 - variable name so let's say we provide
02:23 - file 1 in this case now this file one
02:26 - that is the variable name can be used in
02:28 - order to read the content of the file so
02:31 - after this colon we can go to the next
02:33 - line and then we can have another
02:35 - variable that is read content in this
02:38 - case followed by equal to and then we
02:41 - can have file 1 followed by Dot and then
02:43 - we have the rear method so guys this
02:45 - line of code is responsible in order to
02:48 - read the content of the file and store
02:50 - the content inside the read content
02:52 - variable name and then guys we can
02:54 - simply have the print function in order
02:56 - to print the content of the file so guys
02:59 - that is the way that we can use the with
03:01 - open syntax along with this we are using
03:04 - the read method in order to read the
03:06 - content and printing the content over
03:08 - here now it is very important to note
03:09 - that we need not have to provide this
03:12 - line of statement that is file one dot
03:14 - close in this case that's because when
03:16 - we are using the with open syntax the
03:18 - file will be automatically closed after
03:20 - the read operation is completed so I'll
03:23 - just remove this line of code since it
03:24 - is not required so guys let me just save
03:26 - this file now and try running this code
03:28 - so as you can see we are getting all the
03:30 - content of the file that is all the four
03:33 - lines over here that is present inside
03:35 - the test file so we are getting this is
03:37 - a test line in a test file and then we
03:39 - are having the this is another test line
03:41 - so whatever content is there we are
03:43 - getting it over here inside our program
03:45 - let me just remove these third and
03:47 - fourth line over here and then I'll just
03:49 - save this file now inside the test file
03:51 - and then what we will do is we will run
03:53 - this code once again this time we should
03:55 - only get the starting two lines that's
03:57 - because we have removed the third and
03:59 - fourth line from the test file so I'll
04:01 - just save this file and try running this
04:02 - code now so as you can see we are
04:04 - getting this is a test line in a test
04:06 - file and the second line this is another
04:08 - test line so only two lines over here
04:11 - are getting printed so guys this is the
04:13 - way that we can use the with open syntax
04:15 - in order to read the content of the file
04:18 - print it on the console or do whatever
04:20 - based on the requirements of your
04:22 - project now it is important to note that
04:24 - we need not have to close the file
04:26 - explicitly after carrying out the
04:28 - operations with the file that we have
04:30 - opened so guys practice on your own so
04:32 - that on different inputs you get
04:33 - different outputs please make sure that
04:35 - you like this video so that it reaches
04:37 - to more people and subscribe to this
04:39 - channel so that you get the
04:40 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
04:42 - the next video that we are going to talk
04:43 - about is file writing in Python
04:46 - Programming so stay tuned

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about with open syntax to read the file in Python Programming so guys in Python we can use the with open syntax to automatically close the file and as you can see in this example we have the syntax that is first of all we have the with keyword followed by the open function and then we have the path of the file along with the file name and then the second parameter is the read mode of the file and then we have the as keyword over here followed by the variable name and then after this colon we can read the content by using the read method and then we can simply Print it Now guys the advantage of using this with open syntax in order to read the content of the file is that it automatically closes the file so previously we had seen that by using these four lines of code we can simply open the file read the content and print the content over here and this fourth line over here that is close method was used in order to close the file that we had opened but this is not required if we are using the with open syntax so let us check this with the help of example now over here I'll just clear these lines of code and simply we will provide the width keyword first followed by open function and then we have the open and close parenthesis and inside this we have to provide the path of the file that we want to read so we are going to read the same file that we had used previously that is the test file so first of all we have to provide the directory paths over here I'll just copy the directory path over here and paste this over here and then we have the file name to be read so I'll just copy this file name and paste this over here followed by dot txt now guys it is very important that we have

file so we provide R in this case so this means that we are opening the file in the read mode and then guys after this after this open function we have the as keyword and Then followed by the variable name so let's say we provide file 1 in this case now this file one that is the variable name can be used in order to read the content of the file so after this colon we can go to the next line and then we can have another variable that is read content in this case followed by equal to and then we can have file 1 followed by Dot and then we have the rear method so guys this line of code is responsible in order to read the content of the file and store the content inside the read content variable name and then guys we can simply have the print function in order to print the content of the file so guys that is the way that we can use the with open syntax along with this we are using the read method in order to read the content and printing the content over here now it is very important to note that we need not have to provide this line of statement that is file one dot close in this case that's because when we are using the with open syntax the file will be automatically
