With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see opacity or
00:02 - transparency in CSS so guys basically
00:05 - the opacity property specifies the
00:07 - opacity or the transparency of an
00:09 - element and this we are going to check
00:11 - with the help of examples as well the
00:14 - opacity property can take a value from
00:17 - 0.0 up to 1.0 so guys basically we can
00:21 - provide the values that is from 0.0 and
00:24 - then we can also provide 0.1 0.2 0.3 and
00:28 - up to the value that is 1 1.0 so if you
00:31 - provide the lower value the more
00:33 - transparent the element will be so guys
00:35 - by default the opacity will be set as
00:38 - 1.0 to all the HTML elements and simply
00:41 - by decreasing this value towards 0.0 you
00:45 - will be increasing the transparency of
00:47 - that particular HTML element so guys let
00:50 - us check this with the help of example
00:52 - in vs code over here so simply I'm going
00:54 - to remove the previous lines of code
00:56 - that we had written in the HTML and the
00:58 - CSS files over here now guys what we are
01:01 - going to do is we are going to insert an
01:03 - image in our HTML file in this case so
01:06 - basically we are going to have the image
01:08 - and for the source attribute we are
01:10 - going to define the sample image over
01:13 - here that we have already saved in our
01:15 - directory so guys basically we are going
01:18 - to use this particular sample forest
01:20 - image in this case and then for the alt
01:22 - attribute simply we are going to provide
01:25 - test image as the alternate text over
01:28 - here so guys let me just save this file
01:30 - now and try reloading this page once
01:32 - again on the browser so as you can see
01:34 - this is the image that is getting
01:36 - displayed over here now guys we are
01:38 - going to set the width and height of
01:39 - this particular image inside the style.
01:42 - CSS file so over here simply we are
01:44 - going to provide the width and height
01:47 - inside the IMG tag over here so guys
01:49 - let's say we have the width as 200
01:51 - pixels and height as 150 pixels over
01:54 - here so basically we are going to Define
01:56 - these width and height in this case let
01:59 - me just save this file now and try
02:01 - reloading this page once again on the
02:02 - browser so as you can see this is the
02:05 - image that is getting displayed over
02:07 - here on the web browser now because by
02:09 - default the opacity value is one over
02:11 - here so simply when we provide the
02:13 - opacity CSS property so as you can see
02:17 - this is the opacity CSS property that we
02:19 - are talking about right now so by
02:21 - default the value is one right now over
02:24 - here so it is 1.0 let me just save this
02:27 - file now and try reloading this page
02:29 - when we reload this page we won't be
02:31 - able to see any change because this is
02:33 - the default value that we have provided
02:36 - over here so as you can see after
02:38 - reloading the page there is no change
02:40 - inside the image in this case now guys
02:42 - let us decrease the opacity to some
02:45 - extent over here so that we can see
02:47 - certain transparency inside this
02:49 - particular image so let's provide the
02:52 - value as 0.8 in this case so the moment
02:55 - we provide 0.8 as opacity transparency
02:58 - effect should be Prov provided to some
03:00 - extent to this particular image so guys
03:03 - let me just save this file now and try
03:05 - reloading this page once again on the
03:07 - browser so as you can see to some extent
03:09 - we can see the transparency inside this
03:12 - image now and that is how the opacity
03:14 - CSS property works let us decrease the
03:17 - value to 0.5 now so that 50% of the
03:21 - transparency can be implemented on this
03:24 - particular image let me just save this
03:26 - file now and try reloading this page
03:28 - once again on the browser so as you can
03:30 - see 50% transparency can be seen in this
03:33 - particular image right now guys what we
03:35 - will do is we will also provide the
03:37 - original image as well over here so
03:39 - simply what we will do is again we are
03:42 - going to copy this line of code once
03:44 - again over here so this IMG tag is again
03:46 - having the source attribute as the
03:48 - sample forest image and it is also
03:50 - having the alternate text as test image
03:53 - over here now guys in order to identify
03:55 - what we will do is simply we are going
03:57 - to provide couple of line breaks in this
04:00 - case so first of all for the first image
04:02 - what we will do is we will say that this
04:04 - is the original image over here so
04:06 - simply we are going to provide the
04:08 - paragraph tag in this case and then we
04:11 - will say that this is the original image
04:13 - and then after the line breaks again we
04:15 - are going to have the paragraph tag over
04:17 - here and then we will say that this is
04:19 - the modified image in this case so guys
04:22 - for the original image we are going to
04:24 - have certain ID over here so let's say
04:26 - we have the ID as original in this case
04:29 - and for the second image that is the
04:31 - modified image we are going to have the
04:33 - ID which is going to be modified in this
04:36 - case so Guys these IDs are provided so
04:38 - that we can identify between both of
04:41 - these images right now since we are
04:43 - using the common width and height for
04:45 - both the images so guys what we will do
04:47 - is I'll simply remove the opacity over
04:50 - here from this particular image and then
04:52 - we would Define the ID of the modified
04:55 - image over here so simply we are going
04:57 - to provide the hash character and for
04:59 - the modified ID so we are going to copy
05:02 - this modified ID and paste it over here
05:04 - and we are going to provide the opacity
05:06 - as 0.5 that is the 50% of transparency
05:11 - so guys basically for the modified image
05:13 - we are going to provide the opacity as
05:15 - 50% that is 0.5 is the value and for the
05:18 - original image we have not provided any
05:21 - opacity for which the default opacity
05:24 - will be one in this case so guys let me
05:26 - just save this file now and try
05:28 - reloading this page once again on the
05:29 - browser so as you can see we have this
05:32 - original image that is having the
05:34 - opacity as one and we have the modified
05:37 - image over here which is having certain
05:39 - kind of transparency in this case when
05:41 - we set the opacity as 1.0 so there will
05:44 - be no change in both the images let me
05:46 - just reload this page once again on the
05:48 - browser so as you can see there is no
05:50 - change right now but when we decrease
05:52 - the opacity so let's say we provide 0.3
05:55 - as the opacity so basically a lot of
05:58 - transparency will be provided to the
06:00 - modified image over here so let me just
06:02 - save this file now and try reloading
06:04 - this page once again on the browser so
06:06 - as you can see 0.3 opacity is helping us
06:09 - in order to provide the transparency to
06:11 - this particular modified image over here
06:14 - so guys in this way you can easily use
06:16 - the opacity CSS property in order to
06:18 - provide certain transparency to your
06:21 - images or any other HTML elements based
06:23 - on your requirements now guys apart from
06:26 - this let us check another example let us
06:28 - provide the trans transparency on Hover
06:31 - effect so guys what does this mean is
06:33 - whenever we are going to get the cursor
06:35 - on this particular image over here the
06:37 - transparency should be applied over here
06:39 - so guys what we will do is instead of
06:42 - Simply Having the modified ID and
06:44 - providing the opacity is 0.3 over here
06:47 - we are going to provide 50% transparency
06:50 - so we are going to provide opacity is
06:52 - equal to 0.5 but this should be applied
06:56 - when we get the cursor on this
06:58 - particular modified image over here and
07:00 - not by default so guys what we have to
07:02 - do is simply for this hash modified CSS
07:06 - selector after this we are going to
07:08 - provide colon and then we are going to
07:10 - use the Cudo class that is hover over
07:12 - here so guys basically what does this
07:14 - mean is whenever we are going to get the
07:17 - mouse cursor on this particular HTML
07:20 - element that is having the ID as
07:22 - modified the opacity of 0.5 will be
07:25 - applied over here so guys let me just
07:27 - save this file now and try reloading
07:29 - this this page once again on the browser
07:31 - so as you can see the original and the
07:33 - modified images both are looking same
07:35 - because by default the opacity is one
07:38 - right now on both the images but the
07:40 - moment we get the cursor on this
07:42 - particular modified image as you can see
07:45 - the transparency effect can be seen over
07:47 - here since we have provided the hover
07:49 - effect on this modified image over here
07:52 - by applying the opacity is equal to 0.5
07:55 - in this case so guys basically when we
07:57 - get the cursor over here transparency is
07:59 - set to 50% and when we get the cursor
08:02 - outside of this image the opacity is
08:04 - again set to 1.0 which is the default
08:07 - value so guys in this way you must be
08:09 - seeing many websites wherein when you
08:11 - get the cursor on a specific image the
08:13 - transparency is either increased or
08:15 - decreased so this is how the CSS
08:18 - properties are applied on those websites
08:21 - in such a way that the hover effect will
08:23 - help you in order to increase or
08:25 - decrease the transparency by using the
08:28 - opacity CSS property so guys comment in

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see opacity or transparency in CSS so guys basically the opacity property specifies the opacity or the transparency of an element and this we are going to check with the help of examples as well the opacity property can take a value from 0.0 up to 1.0 so guys basically we can provide the values that is from 0.0 and then we can also provide 0.1 0.2 0.3 and up to the value that is 1 1.0 so if you provide the lower value the more transparent the element will be so guys by default the opacity will be set as 1.0 to all the HTML elements and simply by decreasing this value towards 0.0 you will be increasing the transparency of that particular HTML element so guys let us check this with the help of example in vs code over here so simply I'm going to remove the previous lines of code that we had written in the HTML and the CSS files over here now guys what we are going to do is we are going to insert an image in our HTML file in this case so basically we are going to have the image and for the source attribute we are going to define the sample image over here that we have already saved in our directory so guys basically we are going to use this particular sample forest image in this case and then for the alt attribute simply we are going to provide test image as the alternate text over here so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is the image that is getting displayed over here now guys we are going to set the width and height of this particular image inside the style. CSS file so over here simply we are going to provide the width and height inside the IMG tag over here so guys let's say we have the width as 200 pixels and height as 150 pixels over here so basically we are going to Define these width and height in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is the image that is getting displayed over here on the web browser now because by default the opacity value is one over here so simply when we provide the opacity CSS property so as you can see this is the opacity CSS property that we are talking about right now so by default the value is one right now over here so it is 1.0 let me just save this file now and try reloading this page when we reload this page we won't be able to see any change because this is the default value that we have provided over here so as you can see after reloading the page there is no change inside the image in this case now guys let us decrease the opacity to some extent over here so that we can see certain transparency inside this particular image so let's provide the value as 0.8 in this case so the moment we provide 0.8 as opacity transparency effect should be Prov provided to some extent to this particular image so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see to some extent we can see the transparency inside this image now and that is how the opacity CSS property works let us decrease the value to 0.5 now so that 50% of the transparency can be implemented on this particular image let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see 50% transparency can be seen in this particular image right now guys what we will do is we will also provide the original image as well over here so simply what we will do is again we are going to copy this line of code once again over here so this IMG tag is again having the source attribute as the sample forest image and it is also having the alternate text as test image over here now guys in order to identify what we will do is simply we are going to provide couple

this case so guys for the original image we are going to have certain ID over here so let's say we have the ID as original in this case and for the second image that is the modified image we are going to have the ID which is going to be modified in this case so Guys these IDs are provided so that we can identify between both of these images right now since we are using the common width and height for both the images so guys what we will do is I'll simply remove the opacity over here from this particular image and then we would Define the ID of the modified image over here so simply we are going to provide the hash character and for the modified ID so we are going to copy this modified ID and paste it over here and we are going to provide the opacity as 0.5 that is the 50% of transparency so guys basically for the modified image we are going to provide the opacity as 50% that is 0.5 is the value and for the original image we have not provided any opacity for which the default opacity will be one in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have this original image that is having the opacity as one and we have the modified image over here which is having certain kind of transparency in this case when we set the opacity as 1.0 so there will be no change in both the images let me just reload this page once again on the browser so as you can see there is no change right now but when we decrease the opacity so let's say we provide 0.3 as the opacity so basically a lot of transparency will be provided to the modified image over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see 0.3 opacity is helping us in order to provide the transparency to this particular modified image over here so guys in this way you can easily use the opacity CSS property in order to provide certain transparency to your images or any other HTML elements based on your requirements now guys apart from this let us check another example let us provide the trans transparency on Hover effect so guys what does this mean is whenever we are going to get the cursor on this particular image over here the transparency should be applied over here so guys what we will do is instead of Simply Having the modified ID and providing the opacity is 0.3 over here we are going to provide 50% transparency so we are going to provide opacity is equal to 0.5 but this should be applied when we get the cursor on this particular modified image over here and not by default so guys what we have to do is simply for this hash modified CSS selector after this we are going to provide colon and then we are going to use the Cudo class that is hover
