With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see length units in CSS
00:03 - so guys basically CSS has several
00:05 - different units for expressing a length
00:08 - and many CSS properties take length
00:11 - values such as width margin padding font
00:14 - size Etc and this we are going to check
00:17 - with the help of examples as well that
00:19 - what are the different units that we can
00:21 - provide to all these CSS properties over
00:24 - here now guys length is a number
00:27 - followed by a length unit such as 10
00:30 - pixels over here so when we say 10
00:32 - pixels 10 is the length and pixel is one
00:36 - of the length units inside the CSS apart
00:39 - from this we also have 2 em over here
00:42 - where two is the length and EM is the
00:45 - length unit that we are going to check
00:47 - the that we are going to check with
00:48 - examples as well so guys let us see what
00:50 - are the different absolute lens over
00:53 - here so basically the absolute length
00:55 - units are fixed and the length expressed
00:58 - in any of these will appear as exactly
01:01 - that size over here on the screen that
01:04 - you are viewing your web page so guys
01:06 - let us see how this CM that the ctim
01:09 - will work so let us move to the vs code
01:11 - over here and simply I'm going to remove
01:13 - the previous lines of code that we had
01:15 - written in the HTML and the CSS files
01:19 - now guys what we will do is simply we
01:21 - are going to have the paragraph tag over
01:23 - here and then we will say this font size
01:27 - is in cm so guys basically we have the
01:30 - statement that is this font size is in
01:32 - cm over here and then guys what we will
01:35 - do is we are going to have the class for
01:37 - this particular paragraph and simply we
01:39 - are going to say cm in this case which
01:42 - represents the CM length over here let
01:45 - me just save this file now and try
01:46 - reloading this page on the browser so as
01:49 - you can see we have a very simple
01:50 - statement that is this font size is in
01:53 - cm now guys we have not provided any
01:55 - font size in this case inside our style.
01:58 - CSS file so by by default if you see the
02:01 - font size of this particular paragraph
02:03 - text will be 16 pixels over here so most
02:06 - of the browsers provide the font size of
02:09 - 16 pixels for all the text that are
02:11 - displayed on the web page so guys let me
02:14 - just inspect this particular paragraph
02:16 - tag so as you can see if we scroll down
02:19 - so we cannot see any of the CSS
02:21 - properties for this paragraph tag apart
02:23 - from these default CSS properties over
02:26 - here so guys what we will do is inside
02:27 - our style. CSS file in this case simply
02:30 - we are going to say dot followed by CM
02:33 - that is the class name for this
02:34 - particular paragraph tag and then we
02:36 - will say font size it is equal to let's
02:39 - say we have 16 pixels in this case so
02:42 - guys for test purpose we are going to
02:43 - see whether the font size is going to
02:45 - change or not so let me just save this
02:47 - file now and try reloading this page
02:49 - once again on the browser so as you can
02:51 - see the font size is not updated for
02:53 - this particular paragraph tag and the
02:55 - font size of 16 pixels is now getting
02:58 - reflected under under this inspect
03:00 - option guys you can also change the font
03:02 - size from here so basically you can see
03:05 - that this is 16 pixels in this case you
03:07 - can simply provide 20 pixels over here
03:09 - and simply the font size is going to be
03:11 - updated in this case you can also
03:13 - provide 22 pixels or any of the size
03:16 - over here now guys the important thing
03:18 - is we are supposed to provide the font
03:20 - size in cm so what we have to do is
03:22 - instead of pixels over here let's say we
03:24 - provide the font size as 5 cm that is CM
03:28 - over here in this case so guys let me
03:30 - just save this file now and try
03:31 - reloading this page once again on the
03:33 - browser so as you can see this is a very
03:35 - big font size over here so let me just
03:37 - change the length in this case so let's
03:39 - say we provide 0.5 CM over here let me
03:43 - just save this file now and try
03:44 - reloading this page so as you can see
03:46 - this font size is in cm and you can see
03:49 - that the CM class is having the font
03:51 - size as 0.5 CM let us increase the font
03:55 - size to 0.8 cm over here let me just
03:58 - save this file now and and try reloading
04:00 - this page so as you can see this font
04:02 - size is in cm and the size has increased
04:05 - to 0.8 cm over here so guys in this way
04:08 - this is one of the absolute lens that
04:10 - you can use based on your project
04:12 - requirements now guys apart from this
04:14 - you can also provide the length in
04:16 - millimet so let us have another
04:18 - paragraph over here so simply I'm going
04:20 - to copy this line of code over here and
04:22 - then instead of CM we are going to have
04:24 - millimeter that is MM in this case as
04:27 - the class name and then we will say this
04:29 - font size sizes in mm over here guys let
04:31 - me just save this file now and inside
04:33 - the style. CSS file once again we are
04:36 - going to have the mm class name over
04:38 - here so simply we will have mm in this
04:41 - case and for the font size let's say we
04:43 - have 5 mm over here so guys 5 mm is
04:46 - nothing but it is 0.5 CM so let me just
04:49 - save this file now and try reloading
04:51 - this page once again on the browser so
04:53 - as you can see this font size is an mm
04:56 - and if we inspect this particular
04:58 - paragraph over here it says 5 mm in this
05:00 - case now guys let us update this
05:02 - particular font size to 8 mm which means
05:05 - it will be equal to 0.8 cm so when we
05:08 - say 8 mm so in this case both the
05:11 - paragraph that is having the class that
05:13 - is CM and the mm will have the same font
05:15 - size because 0.8 cm is same as 8 mm over
05:20 - here let me just save this file now and
05:22 - try reloading this page once again on
05:24 - the browser so as you can see the font
05:26 - size of both the paragraph is now
05:28 - looking same and this is this is how you
05:30 - can use the millimeter length unit as
05:32 - well now guys apart from this we also
05:34 - have something called as inches so
05:36 - basically 1 in it is equal to 96 pixels
05:39 - over here which is equal to 2.54 CM so
05:42 - guys let us check this as well so
05:44 - basically I'm going to copy this line of
05:46 - code over here and simply we are going
05:48 - to have the class name as in in which is
05:51 - inches in this case and then let us say
05:53 - we have this text test this font size is
05:55 - in inches let me just save this file now
05:58 - and over here we are going to to copy
06:00 - this line of code for the class inches
06:03 - and let us change this class name to
06:05 - iron in this case and let us have some
06:07 - unit in terms of inches over here now
06:10 - guys what is 1 in it is equal to 96
06:12 - pixels but it will be a very big font
06:15 - size so let's say we want 0.2 in in this
06:18 - case which will be approximately 19
06:20 - pixels over here so guys let us have 0.2
06:24 - in in this case so ion is the unit that
06:26 - you can use when you want to provide the
06:29 - font size in terms of inches so guys let
06:31 - me just save this file now and try
06:33 - reloading this page once again on the
06:35 - browser so as you can see this font size
06:37 - is in inches and it is 0.2 in right now
06:41 - so when we inspect over here it says it
06:43 - is 0.2 in and if we calculate how many
06:46 - inches it will be so we multiply 96
06:49 - pixels by 0.2 in over here so basically
06:52 - it is 19.2 pixels in this case so guys
06:55 - if we provide 19.2 pixels as the size
06:58 - over here that is the font size for this
07:00 - paragraph there will be no change in
07:02 - this case so when we provide 19.2 pixels
07:05 - let me just save this file now and try
07:07 - reloading this page you will notice that
07:09 - there will be no change for the font
07:10 - size of this particular paragraph tag
07:12 - over here so when we reload so as you
07:15 - can see there is no change in this
07:16 - particular paragraphs font size and it
07:19 - is set in terms of pixels over here so
07:21 - guys basically this is the conversion
07:23 - that you can use that is 1 in it is
07:25 - equal to 96 pixels based on your project
07:28 - requirements and then guys apart from
07:30 - this we can also use the pixels unit
07:32 - which we were using till now so
07:34 - basically let us use that as well so
07:36 - over here what we will do is we will
07:38 - roll back this change to 0.2 in in this
07:41 - case and then guys apart from this let
07:42 - us have another paragraph over here in
07:45 - which case the class will be PX which
07:47 - represents the pixels length in this
07:49 - case so basically we are going to say
07:52 - the font size is in pixels for this
07:54 - paragraph so let me just save this file
07:56 - now and over here inside the style. CSS
07:59 - file let us have the entry for the
08:01 - pixels class so we have PX in this case
08:04 - and let's say we have the 24 pixel size
08:07 - for this particular font size over here
08:09 - so guys let me just save this file now
08:11 - and try reloading this page once again
08:13 - on the browser so as you can see this
08:15 - font size is in pixels over here and
08:17 - then when we inspect this particular
08:19 - paragraph you can see that we have the
08:21 - 24 pixels font size we can increase or
08:24 - decrease this font size so let us say we
08:26 - provide the 28 pixels and you can see
08:28 - that the size of this particular
08:30 - paragraph is increased now so guys in
08:32 - this way you can use the pixels length
08:34 - unit as well and apart from this we also
08:37 - have the PT which represents the point's
08:39 - length over here and then we also have
08:41 - PC which is P's length over here now one
08:44 - point it is equal to 1x 72 of 1 in and 1
08:48 - PC is equal to 12 points over here so
08:51 - guys both these length units I leave up
08:53 - to you as a homework for you so that you
08:55 - can practice on your own on different
08:57 - HTML elements and understand it in a
09:00 - more clear way now guys apart from this
09:02 - we also have certain relative lens as
09:04 - well so far we have seen what are the
09:06 - absolute lens which means these numbers
09:08 - will be directly applied to those HTML
09:11 - elements now guys what is the meaning of
09:13 - relative lens over here so basically the
09:15 - relative length units specify a length
09:18 - relative to another length property and
09:21 - the relative length units scale better
09:23 - between different rendering mediums so
09:26 - guys let us check this with the help of
09:27 - examples now the first relative length
09:30 - unit is em over here now guys it is
09:32 - relative to the font size of the element
09:35 - and 2 em means 2 * the size of the
09:38 - current font over here so guys let us
09:40 - check this with the help of example in
09:42 - vs code so what we are going to do is
09:44 - let us copy this line of code over here
09:47 - and simply what we are going to do is
09:49 - for this paragraph We are going to say
09:50 - the class name is em and then we will
09:53 - say this font size is in EM over here
09:56 - now guys as we know the default font
09:58 - size for all almost all the browsers is
10:01 - 16 pixels over here so when we say 1 em
10:04 - it will be equal to 16 pixels so let us
10:07 - check that as well let me just save this
10:09 - HTML file and move to the CSS file over
10:12 - here and simply we are going to have the
10:14 - entry for the class name that is em so
10:16 - we have do em in this case and then guys
10:19 - for the font what we will do is we will
10:21 - set it as 1 em in this case let me just
10:24 - save this file now and try reloading
10:26 - this page once again on the browser so
10:28 - as you can see this for font size is in
10:30 - EM now guys if we inspect this
10:32 - particular option over here when we
10:34 - inspect this particular paragraph you
10:36 - can see that the font size is equal to 1
10:38 - em over here so when we uncheck this as
10:41 - you can see the font size is not
10:43 - changing that's because the default font
10:45 - size for this particular browser is 16
10:48 - pixels and that is what is getting
10:50 - applied over here when we uncheck this
10:52 - option and when we check this option it
10:54 - is set to 1 em and 1 em is also equal to
10:58 - 16 pixels so guys what we will do is
11:00 - let's say we want to change it to 2 em
11:03 - over here so what will happen so since 1
11:05 - em is 16 pixels 2 * em will be equal to
11:09 - 32 pixels which can be calculated by 2 *
11:13 - by 16 so guys over here the font size
11:15 - will be increased to 32 pixels in this
11:18 - case so let me just save this file now
11:20 - and try reloading this page once again
11:22 - on the browser so as you can see this is
11:24 - equal to 32 pixels right now when we
11:26 - uncheck this option it will go back to
11:28 - 60 pixels once again because we have not
11:31 - provided any font size but when we
11:33 - provide the font size of 2 em so it will
11:35 - change to 32 pixels and guys over here
11:38 - the decimal numbers also work so let's
11:40 - say we want to provide 1.5 em in this
11:43 - case so instead of 2 em let's say we
11:46 - provide 1.5 em over here let me just
11:48 - save this file now and try reloading
11:50 - this page once again on the browser so
11:52 - now the font size is equal to 24 pixels
11:55 - which is equal to 1.5 em over here so
11:58 - guys in this way you you can use the EM
12:00 - length unit which is a relative length
12:02 - unit in this case where 1 em is equal to
12:05 - 16 pixels of the font size now guys
12:08 - apart from this we also have something
12:10 - called as R which is relative to the
12:13 - font size of the root element so guys
12:15 - what is the meaning of root element so
12:17 - over here for the HTML document we have
12:20 - the root tag as the HTML tag over here
12:23 - which is this particular tag so guys
12:25 - whatever font size of this HTML tag is
12:28 - basically based on that font size the RM
12:32 - unit will work so let us check that as
12:34 - well so in this case we are going to
12:36 - have the paragraph tag with the class
12:38 - name that is RM and then we will say
12:40 - this font size is in RM over here let me
12:43 - just save this file now and go to the
12:45 - style. CSS file in this case and then
12:48 - guys what we will do is we will also
12:49 - have the HTML tag in this case and
12:52 - inside this we are going to say font
12:54 - size and by default let's say we have
12:56 - the font size as 16 pixels so we are
12:58 - going to set the 16 pixels as the value
13:01 - for the font size inside the HTML tag
13:04 - now guys we will have the RM entry over
13:07 - here so basically we are going to have
13:09 - dot followed by the class name that is r
13:12 - and let's say we have one RM as the
13:15 - length unit so guys basically for the
13:17 - paragraph which is having the class that
13:19 - is RM over here the font size will be
13:21 - equal to 1 RM which means it will be
13:24 - equal to 1 multiplied by the font size
13:27 - of the root element that is 16 pixels so
13:29 - basically it will be equal to 16 pixels
13:32 - in this case let me just save this file
13:34 - now and try reloading this page once
13:36 - again on the browser so as you can see
13:38 - the font size is an RM and basically
13:40 - this font size is 16 pixels over here
13:43 - and the moment we change this font size
13:45 - let's say to 20 pixels in this case for
13:48 - the root element which is HTML element
13:50 - over here the font size for this
13:52 - paragraph will also increase so guys let
13:55 - me just save this file now and try
13:57 - reloading this page once again on the
13:59 - browser notice that the font size for
14:01 - this particular paragraph will increase
14:03 - now so when we reload this page as you
14:05 - can see the font size for this paragraph
14:08 - has increased over here so guys in this
14:10 - way you can use the RM unit over here
14:13 - apart from this you can also increase
14:14 - the RM unit so let's say we increase
14:17 - this unit to 1.5 over here let me just
14:20 - save this file now and this time it
14:22 - should be equal to 30 pixels because the
14:25 - HTML font size is 20 pixels right now so
14:28 - when we reload this page once again you
14:30 - will notice that this particular font
14:32 - size will increase so when we reload
14:34 - this page so as you can see the font
14:36 - size has now increased to 30 pixels this
14:39 - time so guys in this way you can use the
14:41 - RM unit as well now guys apart from this
14:43 - we also have two more important relative
14:46 - units that is VW which is relative to 1%
14:50 - of the width of the viewport and VH
14:52 - which is relative to the 1% of the
14:55 - height of the viewport so guys over here
14:57 - W stands for width and X stands for
14:59 - height and V is nothing but it is the
15:02 - viewport now guys what is viewport over
15:04 - here so basically viewport is nothing
15:06 - but the visible area that you can see on
15:08 - this particular browser so since we have
15:11 - opened console over here by using the
15:13 - F12 option on windows so basically this
15:16 - is the viewport you can see that we can
15:18 - increase or decrease the width of the
15:20 - viewport and the same number can be
15:22 - displayed over here that what is the
15:24 - width of this particular screen right
15:26 - now so when we increase the width let's
15:29 - say this is 688 pixels over here so
15:32 - right now you can see it is 688 pixels
15:35 - so what we are going to do is let us
15:37 - create another paragraph tag in this
15:39 - case so guys over here what we will do
15:41 - is inside the HTML file we will have
15:43 - another paragraph tag over here and
15:45 - simply we are going to have the class
15:47 - name as VW and then we will say this
15:50 - width is in VW so guys we are going to
15:52 - set the width property over here for
15:54 - this particular paragraph So this width
15:57 - is in VW unit so guys let me just save
16:00 - this file now and inside the style. CSS
16:03 - file again we are going to have the
16:05 - entry for this VW class so guys over
16:08 - here we have dot followed by VW and this
16:11 - time let us have the background color
16:13 - for this paragraph tag so that we can
16:15 - identify that what is the width of this
16:18 - particular paragraph So guys over here
16:20 - we have the background color as yellow
16:22 - and then what we will do is we are going
16:24 - to set the width in this case so guys
16:26 - basically as we have seen that we VW is
16:29 - nothing but it is 1% of the width of the
16:32 - viewport so guys when we say 1 VW it is
16:35 - 1% but let's say we want the 50% of this
16:38 - particular view Port so basically it is
16:41 - 688 pixels of width that we have seen
16:44 - just now so what we can do is 50% of the
16:47 - VW unit will be equal to 344 pixels so
16:50 - the same withd we are going to set so
16:53 - guys basically we are going to set 50
16:55 - length and then the unit that we are
16:57 - going to use is VW over here so let me
17:00 - just save this file now and try
17:01 - reloading this page once again on the
17:03 - browser so as you can see we have this
17:05 - paragraph which is having this width is
17:07 - in VW unit text over here and we have
17:10 - the background color as yellow and it is
17:12 - taking 50% of the width over here as far
17:15 - as this viewport is concerned guys what
17:17 - we are going to do is we will just
17:19 - comment out the previous paragraphs over
17:21 - here so that we can understand the VW
17:24 - and VH units more clearly so we have
17:27 - commented out the previous paragraph
17:29 - over here let me just save this file now
17:30 - and try reloading this page so as you
17:32 - can see we are only seeing this
17:34 - particular paragraph over here now guys
17:36 - if we increase or decrease the width
17:38 - basically the width of this paragraph
17:40 - that is having the background color as
17:42 - yellow will also increase or decrease so
17:45 - when we decrease the width you can see
17:47 - that the width of the paragraph is also
17:49 - decreasing that's because the viewport
17:51 - width is decreasing over here and
17:53 - accordingly we are setting the 50% of
17:56 - this particular viewport as the width of
17:59 - the paragraph and that is why the width
18:01 - of the paragraph is also decreasing in
18:03 - this case and when we increase the width
18:05 - of the viewport the width of the
18:07 - paragraph is increasing over here and
18:09 - let's say we set it to 600 pixels over
18:12 - here as the width so basically now the
18:14 - width of this paragraph is 300 pixels so
18:17 - guys let us check that as well so
18:19 - instead of having 50 VW let us comment
18:22 - out this line of code over here and we
18:24 - are going to set the withd once again
18:26 - and this time we are going to set the
18:28 - with S3 300 pixels over here that's
18:30 - because the viewport width is 600 pixels
18:33 - let me just save this file now and try
18:35 - reloading this page once again on the
18:37 - browser you will notice that there will
18:38 - be no change right now over here so when
18:41 - we reload this page as you can see there
18:43 - is no change right now over here and
18:45 - when we remove this line of code let us
18:47 - comment out this line of code and let us
18:49 - uncomment the line of code having the
18:52 - viewport withd that is the VW unit over
18:55 - here let me just save this file now it
18:56 - is same as 300 pixels so there will be
18:59 - no change so when we reload this page as
19:01 - you can see there is no change over here
19:03 - and now let us decrease the width of
19:05 - this particular paragraph so let us set
19:07 - it to 40 VW so let me just save this
19:11 - file now and try reloading this page
19:13 - once again on the browser so as you can
19:14 - see the width has been decreased now and
19:17 - based on the viewport over here it
19:20 - decrease or increase in this case now
19:22 - guys we can also see that the height is
19:25 - 4467 over here so what we can do is we
19:28 - can use
20:28 - particular device on which the user is
20:30 - viewing your web page so Guys these are
20:33 - some of the absolute and relative length
20:36 - units that we have seen and based on
20:38 - your project requirements you can use
20:40 - them to complete your task so guys

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see length units in CSS so guys basically CSS has several different units for expressing a length and many CSS properties take length values such as width margin padding font size Etc and this we are going to check with the help of examples as well that what are the different units that we can provide to all these CSS properties over here now guys length is a number followed by a length unit such as 10 pixels over here so when we say 10 pixels 10 is the length and pixel is one of the length units inside the CSS apart from this we also have 2 em over here where two is the length and EM is the length unit that we are going to check the that we are going to check with examples as well so guys let us see what are the different absolute lens over here so basically the absolute length units are fixed and the length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size over here on the screen that you are viewing your web page so guys let us see how this CM that the ctim will work so let us move to the vs code over here and simply I'm going to remove the previous lines of code that we had written in the HTML and the CSS files now guys what we will do is simply we are going to have the paragraph tag over here and then we will say this font size is in cm so guys basically we have the statement that is this font size is in cm over here and then guys what we will do is we are going to have the class for this particular paragraph and simply we are going to say cm in this case which represents the CM length over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have a very simple statement that is this font size is in cm now guys we have not provided any font size in this case inside our style. CSS file so by by default if you see the font size of this particular paragraph text will be 16 pixels over here so most of the browsers provide the font size of 16 pixels for all the text that are displayed on the web page so guys let me just inspect this particular paragraph tag so as you can see if we scroll down so we cannot see any of the CSS properties for this paragraph tag apart from these default CSS properties over here so guys what we will do is inside our style. CSS file in this case simply we are going to say dot followed by CM that is the class name for this particular paragraph tag and then we will say font size it is equal to let's say we have 16 pixels in this case so guys for test purpose we are going to see whether the font size is going to change or not so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the font size is not updated for this particular paragraph tag and the font size of 16 pixels is now getting reflected under under this inspect option guys you can also change the font size from here so basically you can see that this is 16 pixels in this case you can simply provide 20 pixels over here and simply the font size is going to be updated in this case you can also provide 22 pixels or any of the size over here now guys the important thing is we are supposed to provide the font size in cm so what we have to do is instead of pixels over here let's say we provide the font size as 5 cm that is CM over here in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is a very big font size over here so let me just change the length in this case so let's say we provide 0.5 CM over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see this font size is in cm and you can see that the CM class is having the font size as 0.5 CM let us increase the font size to 0.8 cm over here let me just save this file now and and try reloading this page so as you can see this font size is in cm and the size has increased to 0.8 cm over here so guys in this way this is one of the absolute lens that you can use based on your project requirements now guys apart from this you can also provide the length in millimet so let us have another paragraph over here so simply I'm going to copy this line of code over here and then instead of CM we are going to have millimeter that is MM in this case as the class name and then we will say this font size sizes in mm over here guys let me just save this file now and inside the style. CSS file once again we are going to have the mm class name over here so simply we will have mm in this case and for the font size let's say we have 5 mm over here so guys 5 mm is nothing but it is 0.5 CM so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this font size is an mm and if we inspect this particular paragraph over here it says 5 mm in this case now guys let us update this particular font size to 8 mm which means it will be equal to 0.8 cm so when we say 8 mm so in this case both the paragraph that is having the class that is CM and the mm will have the same font size because 0.8 cm is same as 8 mm over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the font size of both the paragraph is now looking same and this is this is how you can use the millimeter length unit as well now guys apart from this we also have something called as inches so basically 1 in it is equal to 96 pixels over here which is equal to 2.54 CM so guys let us check this as well so basically I'm going to copy this line of code over here and simply we are going to have the class name as in in which is inches in this case and then let us say we have this text test this font size is in inches let me just save this file now and over here we are going to to copy this line of code for the class inches and let us change this class name to iron in this case and let us have some unit in terms of inches over here now guys what is 1 in it is equal to 96 pixels but it will be a very big font size so let's say we want 0.2 in in this case which will be approximately 19 pixels over here so guys let us have 0.2 in in this case so ion is the unit that you can use when you want to provide the font size in terms of inches so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this font size is in inches and it is 0.2 in right now so when we inspect over here it says it is 0.2 in and if we calculate how many inches it will be so we multiply 96 pixels by 0.2 in over here so basically it is 19.2 pixels in this case so guys if we provide 19.2 pixels as the size over here that is the font size for this paragraph there will be no change in this case so when we provide 19.2 pixels let me just save this file now and try reloading this page you will notice that there will be no change for the font size of this particular paragraph tag over here so when we reload so as you can see there is no change in this particular paragraphs font size and it is set in terms of pixels over here so guys basically this is the conversion that you can use that is 1 in it is equal to 96 pixels based on your project requirements and then guys apart from this we can also use the pixels unit which we were using till now so basically let us use that as well so over here what we will do is we will roll back this change to 0.2 in in this case and then guys apart from this let us have another paragraph over here in which case the class will be PX which represents the pixels length in this case so basically we are going to say the font size is in pixels for this paragraph so let me just save this file now and over here inside the style. CSS file let us have the entry for the pixels class so we have PX in this case and let's say we have the 24 pixel size for this particular font size over here so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this font size is in pixels over here and then when we inspect this particular paragraph you can see that we have the 24 pixels font size we can increase or decrease this font size so let us say we provide the 28 pixels and you can see that the size of this particular paragraph is increased now so guys in this way you can use the pixels length unit as well and apart from this we also have the PT which represents the point's length over here and then we also have PC which is P's length over here now one point it is equal to 1x 72 of 1 in and 1 PC is equal to 12 points over here so guys both these length units I leave up to you as a homework for you so that you can practice on your own on different HTML elements and understand it in a more clear way now guys apart from this we also have certain relative lens as well so far we have seen what are the absolute lens which means these numbers will be directly applied to those HTML elements now guys what is the meaning of relative lens over here so basically the relative length units specify a length relative to another length property and the relative length units scale better between different rendering mediums so guys let us check this with the help of examples now the first relative length unit is em over here now guys it is relative to the font size of the element and 2 em means 2 * the size of the current font over here so guys let us check this with the help of example in vs code so what we are going to do is let us copy this line of code over here and simply what we are going to do is for this paragraph We are going to say the class name is em and then we will say this font size is in EM over here now guys as we know the default font size for all almost all the browsers is 16 pixels over here so when we say 1 em it will be equal to 16 pixels so let us check that as well let me just save this HTML file and move to the CSS file over here and simply we are going to have the entry for the class name that is em so we have do em in this case and then guys for the font what we will do is we will set it as 1 em in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this for font size is in EM now guys if we inspect this particular option over here when we inspect this particular paragraph you can see that the font size is equal to 1 em over here so when we uncheck this as you can see the font size is not changing that's because the default font size for this particular browser is 16 pixels and that is what is getting applied over here when we uncheck this option and when we check this option it is set to 1 em and 1 em is also equal to 16 pixels so guys what we will do is let's say we want to change it to 2 em over here so what will happen so since 1 em is 16 pixels 2 * em will be equal to 32 pixels which can be calculated by 2 * by 16 so guys over here the font size will be increased to 32 pixels in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is equal to 32 pixels right now when we uncheck this option it will go back to 60 pixels once again because we have not provided any font size but when we provide the font size of 2 em so it will change to 32 pixels and guys over here the decimal numbers also work so let's say we want to provide 1.5 em in this case so instead of 2 em let's say we provide 1.5 em over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now the font size is equal to 24 pixels which is equal to 1.5 em over here so guys in this way you you can use the EM length unit which is a relative length unit in this case where 1 em is equal to 16 pixels of the font size now guys apart from this we also have something called as R which is relative to the font size of the root element so guys what is the meaning of root element so over here for the HTML document we have the root tag as the HTML tag over here which is this particular tag so guys whatever font size of this HTML tag is basically based on that font size the RM unit will work so let us check that as well so in this case we are going to have the paragraph tag with the class name that is RM and then we will say this font size is in RM over here let me just save this file now and go to the style. CSS file in this case and then guys what we will do is we will also have the HTML tag in this case and inside this we are going to say font size and by default let's say we have the font size as 16 pixels so we are going to set the 16 pixels as the value for the font size inside the HTML tag now guys we will have the RM entry over here so basically we are going to have dot followed by the class name that is r and let's say we have one RM as the length unit so guys basically for the paragraph which is having the class that is RM over here the font size will be equal to 1 RM which means it will be equal to 1 multiplied by the font size of the root element that is 16 pixels so basically it will be equal to 16 pixels in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the font size is an RM and basically this font size is 16 pixels over here and the moment we change this font size let's say to 20 pixels in this case for the root element which is HTML element over here the font size for this paragraph will also increase so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser notice that the font size for this particular paragraph will increase now so when we reload this page as you can see the font size for this paragraph has increased over here so guys in this way you can use the RM unit over here apart from this you can also increase the RM unit so let's say we increase this unit to 1.5 over here let me just save this file now and this time it should be equal to 30 pixels because the HTML font size is 20 pixels right now so when we reload this page once again you will notice that this particular font size will increase so when we reload this page so as you can see the font size has now increased to 30 pixels this time so guys in this way you can use the RM unit as well now guys apart from this we also have two more important relative units that is VW which is relative to 1% of the width of the viewport and VH which is relative to the 1% of the height of the viewport so guys over here W stands for width and X stands for height and V is nothing but it is the viewport now guys what is viewport over here so basically viewport is nothing but the visible area that you can see on this particular browser so since we have opened console over here by using the F12 option on windows so basically this is the viewport you can see that we can increase or decrease the width of the viewport and the same number can be displayed over here that what is the width of this particular screen right now so when we increase the width let's say this is 688 pixels over here so right now you can see it is 688 pixels so what we are going to do is let us create another paragraph tag in this case so guys over here what we will do is inside the HTML file we will have another paragraph tag over here and simply we are going to have the class name as VW and then we will say this width is in VW so guys we are going to set the width property over here for this particular paragraph So this width is in VW unit so guys let me just save this file now and inside the style. CSS file again we are going to have the entry for this VW class so guys over here we have dot followed by VW and this time let us have the background color for this paragraph tag so that we can identify that what is the width of this particular paragraph So guys over here we have the background color as yellow and then what we will do is we are going to set the width in this case so guys basically as we have seen that we VW is nothing but it is 1% of the width of the viewport so guys when we say 1 VW it is 1% but let's say we want the 50% of this particular view Port so basically it is 688 pixels of width that we have seen just now so what we can do is 50% of the VW unit will be equal to 344 pixels so the same withd we are going to set so guys basically we are going to set 50 length and then the unit that we are going to use is VW over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have this paragraph which is having this width is in VW unit text over here and we have the background color as yellow and it is taking 50% of the width over here as far as this viewport is concerned guys what we are going to do is we will just comment out the previous paragraphs over here so that we can understand the VW and VH units more clearly so we have commented out the previous paragraph over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see we are only seeing this particular paragraph over here now guys if we increase or decrease the width basically the width of this paragraph that is having the background color as yellow will also increase or decrease so when we decrease the width you can see that the width of the paragraph is also decreasing that's because the viewport width is decreasing over here and accordingly we are setting the 50% of this particular viewport as the width of the paragraph and that is why the width of the paragraph is also decreasing in this case and when we increase the width of the viewport the width of the paragraph is increasing over here and let's say we set it to 600 pixels over here as the width so basically now the width of this paragraph is 300 pixels so guys let us check that as well so instead of having 50 VW let us comment out this line of code over here and we are going to set the withd once again and this time we are going to set the with S3 300 pixels over here that's because the viewport width is 600 pixels let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser you will notice that there will be no change right now over here so when we reload this page as you can see there is no change right now over here and when we remove this line of code let us comment out this line of code and let us uncomment the line of code having the viewport withd that is the VW unit over here let me just save this file now it is same as 300 pixels so there will be no change so when we reload this page as you can see there is no change over here and now let us decrease the width of this particular paragraph so let us set it to 40 VW so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the width has been decreased now and based on the viewport over here it decrease or increase in this case now guys we can also see that the height is 4467 over here so what we can do is we can use particular device on which the user is viewing your web page so Guys these are some of the absolute and relative length units that we have seen and based on your project requirements you can use them to complete your task so guys comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is specificity and priority in CSS so stay tuned
