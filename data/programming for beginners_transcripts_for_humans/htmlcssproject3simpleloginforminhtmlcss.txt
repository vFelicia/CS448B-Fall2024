With timestamps:

00:00 - so guys we are going to create this kind
00:01 - of login form over here that is going to
00:04 - have certain border radius and apart
00:06 - from this it is also going to have some
00:08 - box Shadow as well and when we get the
00:10 - mouse cursor on the submit button it is
00:12 - going to increase its size with the help
00:14 - of the scale function that will be used
00:16 - with the help of the transform CSS
00:18 - property so guys over here let us create
00:21 - the login form folder in this case so
00:23 - simply we are going to create another
00:26 - folder over here inside the HTML CSS
00:28 - projects and then guys apart from this
00:30 - inside this login form folder we are
00:33 - going to create two files that is the
00:35 - index.html file and the other file in
00:38 - order to handle the CSS properties so we
00:41 - will have style. CSS file as the
00:43 - external CSS file over here now guys
00:46 - what we will do is simply inside the
00:48 - index.html file we are going to write
00:51 - our HTML elements so over here inside
00:54 - the title tag we are going to say login
00:57 - form in this case so we are going to
00:59 - create a very simple login form over
01:01 - here and also we are going to link the
01:03 - external stylesheet with the help of the
01:06 - link tag over here and the HF attribute
01:08 - it is equal to style. CSS file in this
01:11 - case so guys simply we are going to
01:13 - create a form tag over here inside the
01:15 - container class which will be
01:17 - represented by the diff tag in this case
01:19 - so guys over here we have the container
01:21 - class with the help of the diff tag and
01:24 - then inside this we are going to create
01:25 - a form tag over here also we are going
01:28 - to assign the ID for this form tag so
01:30 - over here let us provide the value as
01:32 - form over here now simply we are going
01:34 - to have two fields in this case that is
01:36 - username and password so let me just
01:39 - provide the first input with the help of
01:41 - the type that is text over here and
01:44 - simply we are going to have the name as
01:46 - username and ID also equal to username
01:49 - over here let us also have couple of
01:51 - line breaks in this case so that the
01:53 - next input that is password can be
01:56 - displayed on the new line so guys over
01:58 - here we have the type is equ Al to
02:00 - password and simply we are going to have
02:02 - the name and ID values as password over
02:05 - here and then again we are going to have
02:07 - the line breaks in this case and then
02:10 - guys after this we are going to have the
02:12 - submit button over here so simply we are
02:14 - going to have the input tag with a type
02:17 - button in this case and the value must
02:19 - be submit just like how we have in the
02:21 - other forms so guys let me just save
02:24 - this file now and let us click on this
02:26 - go live button so that with the help of
02:28 - the live server extension we are able to
02:31 - see our web page on the web browser and
02:33 - whatever changes we make inside this
02:35 - particular HTML and the CSS files will
02:38 - be directly reflected on this particular
02:40 - web page over here so as you can see
02:42 - these are the two input boxes that we
02:44 - have provided and this is the submit
02:46 - button now guys let us provide certain
02:48 - CSS properties to all these HTML
02:51 - elements so first of all inside the form
02:53 - what we are going to do is we will have
02:55 - the h2 tag over here and we will say F
02:58 - below form so so guys basically this is
03:01 - the instruction to the user in order to
03:03 - feel the below form in this case also we
03:05 - are going to have certain background
03:07 - color for this diff tag which is
03:09 - represented by this container class so
03:11 - let me just copy this class name and
03:14 - inside the style. CSS file we are going
03:16 - to have the background color over here
03:19 - and let's say we provide the background
03:20 - color as aqua color let me just save
03:22 - this file now so if you notice that this
03:25 - particular color is getting displayed
03:26 - for the diff tag which is taking the
03:28 - entire width of the screen so guys we
03:30 - can reduce the width of this particular
03:32 - diff tag by providing the width CSS
03:35 - property and let's say we provide 30% as
03:37 - the width in this case so basically we
03:39 - have reduced the width over here also we
03:42 - will provide the padding so let's see we
03:44 - have the padding CSS property and we
03:46 - provide the value as 20 pixels over here
03:49 - so as you can see we have provided the
03:51 - padding as well and then apart from this
03:53 - let us also get the diff tag at the
03:56 - center of the screen by providing the
03:58 - margin is equal to auto and also we will
04:00 - have some margin from the top side as
04:03 - well so let's say we have 20 pixels of
04:05 - margin from the top so as you can see we
04:08 - are getting this diff tag that is the
04:09 - container class at the center of the
04:11 - screen now now guys let us say we want
04:13 - all these HTML elements that is the
04:15 - input fields and the submit button to be
04:18 - present at the center of this particular
04:20 - container so what we can do is simply we
04:22 - can use the text align CSS property and
04:25 - provide the value as Center over here so
04:28 - as you can see all the HTML elements are
04:30 - now present at the center of this
04:32 - particular container because apart from
04:34 - this we will also provide some
04:35 - placeholder over here so that the user
04:37 - comes to know what kind of data is
04:39 - expected over here so inside the input
04:42 - Tex we are going to provide the
04:44 - placeholder and then we will say enter
04:47 - username over here for the username
04:49 - input field and also for the password
04:51 - field we are going to provide enter
04:55 - password in this case so let me just
04:56 - save this file now so as you can see we
04:59 - are getting the placeholders over here
05:01 - now guys what we will do is for both
05:03 - these input fields we are also going to
05:05 - provide certain padding in this case so
05:07 - simply we are going to provide the IDS
05:09 - that is username and password in this
05:11 - case so since we are going to have the
05:14 - common CSS properties for both these
05:16 - fields we are going to provide the ID
05:19 - and separate them by using the comma in
05:21 - this case so guys over here what we want
05:23 - to do is we want to provide the padding
05:26 - of let's say five pixels in this case
05:28 - let me just save this file now so as you
05:29 - can see there is certain spacing when
05:31 - the user provides certain data over here
05:33 - now guys apart from this we will also
05:36 - provide certain CSS properties to this
05:38 - particular submit button so simply we
05:40 - are going to use the ID that is submit
05:42 - over here with the help of the hash
05:44 - character and then let us provide
05:47 - certain background color first of all
05:49 - and it will be the version of the green
05:51 - color so guys let us pick one of the
05:53 - colors in this case so as you can see
05:55 - this is the color that we want over here
05:57 - let me just save this file now and as
05:59 - you can see that there is no color that
06:00 - is getting implemented over here that's
06:02 - because we have not provided the ID to
06:04 - the submit button in this case so let us
06:07 - do that as well so simply we are going
06:09 - to provide the ID is equal to submit so
06:11 - now if you see there is the color that
06:13 - is getting displayed apart from this we
06:15 - will also provide the padding of let's
06:18 - say 5 pixels over here and then guys
06:20 - after this also we want some box Shadow
06:23 - to be implemented so let's say we
06:25 - provide the Border as one pixels solid
06:28 - black color over here so let us provide
06:31 - the black color Border in this case so
06:33 - as you can see this is the black color
06:35 - border and also let us provide the
06:37 - Border radius as well before the Box
06:39 - Shadow so we will provide the Border
06:42 - radius of 5 pixels so as you can see
06:44 - this is the Border radius if I zoom in
06:46 - little bit you can see there is a border
06:48 - radius that can be seen so guys after
06:50 - this what we want to do is also we will
06:52 - provide the Box Shadow over here so
06:55 - simply we will provide the Box Shadow
06:58 - and the horizontal and the vertical
07:00 - Shadow we want to keep it as zero pixels
07:02 - but we want to provide the blur effect
07:04 - so let's say we provide the five pixels
07:06 - as blur effect and the color must be
07:08 - black in this case let me just save this
07:10 - file now so if you notice there is a box
07:13 - shadow that is getting implemented over
07:15 - here for this particular submit button
07:17 - now guys when we get the mouse cursor
07:19 - over here the cursor icon must be
07:22 - updated to hand in this case so simply
07:25 - we will provide the cursor it is equal
07:27 - to pointer over here so when we save
07:29 - this file now as you can see the cursor
07:32 - is now getting updated to the hand icon
07:34 - over here and also we want it to scale
07:36 - little bit so that the size of this
07:38 - button increases when the user gets the
07:40 - mouse cursor on this particular button
07:42 - so guys what we want to do is simply we
07:45 - need to make use of the hover Pudo class
07:47 - over here so when we say submit followed
07:50 - by colon we have something called as
07:52 - hover Pudo class so in this case simply
07:55 - we can make use of the transform CSS
07:58 - property which is having scale as one of
08:00 - the function so guys we need to provide
08:02 - the value of scaling over here so when
08:04 - we provide 1.2 it is going to increase
08:07 - its size against the horizontal and the
08:10 - vertical Dimensions so when we save this
08:12 - file now and let us see the changes so
08:14 - as you can see the button size is
08:16 - increasing now and it is due to the
08:18 - scale function that we have used with
08:20 - the help of the transform CSS property
08:23 - also guys we want a smooth transition
08:25 - when the scaling is happening so simply
08:27 - we can use the transition CSS proper
08:29 - over here so we will use the transition
08:32 - CSS property and in this case we want to
08:35 - transform it smoothly so over here we
08:37 - will make use of this transform CSS
08:40 - property and the time must be let's say
08:42 - 0.3 seconds over here so simply we
08:44 - provide the time as 0.3 seconds when we
08:47 - save this file now and when we get the
08:49 - mouse cursor over here there's a smooth
08:51 - transition that you can see right now as
08:54 - far as the scaling of this button is
08:55 - concerned so guys in this way we have
08:58 - created a simple login form over here
09:00 - instead of providing the string that is
09:02 - field below form we can say login form
09:05 - in this case so as you can see this is
09:06 - the login form now similar to The Box
09:09 - Shadow and the Border radius that we
09:11 - have provided to this button over here
09:13 - we can provide the Border radius and the
09:15 - Box Shadow to this container as well so
09:18 - what we will do is inside the style. CSS
09:20 - file for this container simply we are
09:23 - going to define the Border radius of
09:25 - let's say 10 pixels over here so when we
09:28 - save this file now and as you can see
09:29 - there's a border radius of 10 pixels
09:31 - right now and also we want a certain box
09:34 - Shadow over here so let's say we provide
09:36 - a box Shadow with the help of the blur
09:38 - effect over here and we provide the
09:41 - black color as the Box Shadow so as you
09:43 - can see this is the black color box
09:45 - shadow that is getting provided to this
09:47 - container that is the login form and
09:49 - also we can provide multiple box Shadows
09:52 - over here so after providing comma after
09:54 - the first box Shadow we can provide the
09:57 - second box shadow that is having 20
09:59 - pixels of blur effect and let's say we
10:02 - want the dark blue color this time that
10:04 - will be spread across 20 pixels after
10:07 - the border of the container so when we
10:08 - save this file now you will notice that
10:10 - there is a dark blue color that is
10:12 - getting displayed after the border of
10:14 - the container which is giving this
10:16 - particular login form a decent look over
10:18 - here so guys in this way based on your
10:20 - project requirements you can create
10:22 - attractive login forms so that the user
10:24 - can provide the username and password
10:26 - and any other details as per the project
