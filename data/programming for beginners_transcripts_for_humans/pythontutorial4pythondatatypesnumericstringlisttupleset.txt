00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to learn
00:03 - about python data types in which numeric
00:06 - string list Tuple set are included so
00:10 - Guys these are the different data types
00:11 - that we can see in this video and the
00:13 - upcoming videos as well so basically in
00:15 - computer programming data type specify
00:18 - the type of data that can be stored
00:20 - inside a variable so for example number
00:22 - it is equal to 24 so 24 value belongs to
00:26 - the numeric data type and this is the
00:29 - integer value inside the numeric data
00:31 - type we have many other data types such
00:33 - as integer value then we have float
00:35 - value as well in which there is a
00:37 - decimal point we have a complex value as
00:39 - well in which as you can see this
00:40 - expression that is 1 plus 2 J this is a
00:43 - complex expression so all these are
00:45 - having numeric data types over here so
00:47 - number over here is a numeric data type
00:50 - or the integer as you can see 24 is the
00:52 - value if it was 24.5 then we would say
00:56 - that number variable is of flow data
00:58 - type so guys let us check this with the
00:59 - help of example what we can do is we can
01:02 - simply copy these lines of code over
01:04 - here I'll copy this and we'll paste this
01:06 - over here now what we will do is this
01:08 - constant.py that we had created
01:10 - previously I'll just remove from our
01:12 - python folder over here since it is no
01:14 - longer needed and we will simply keep
01:17 - python code.py where we are going to
01:20 - write all the programs over here so guys
01:22 - over here I'll simply replace the
01:24 - content of this file by this content
01:26 - I'll save this file and over here in the
01:29 - terminal I'll simply clear the screen so
01:31 - as you can see num1 it is defined as 5
01:33 - which is the integer that is being
01:35 - assigned to num1 so the data type over
01:37 - here will be the integer data type and
01:40 - using this print statement what we are
01:41 - doing is we are using this num1 and then
01:44 - followed by comma is of type which means
01:47 - num1 will be printed that is 5 will be
01:50 - printed and then we will have is of type
01:52 - string being printed and then type this
01:55 - is another method that is being used in
01:57 - order to get the type of a variable so
01:59 - as you can see this is the syntax that
02:01 - first we provide type and Then followed
02:03 - by open and close parenthesis and over
02:06 - here inside this we have num1 that is
02:08 - the variable name guys similarly we have
02:10 - provided num2s 2.0 and the same thing we
02:13 - are doing that is we are finding the
02:15 - type over here and then in the num3 as
02:17 - well we are getting the type of this
02:19 - num3 variable let me just see if this
02:22 - file enter running this code now so as
02:24 - you can see 5 is of type Class end so
02:27 - this is of the integer data type 2.0
02:30 - since it is having the decimal over here
02:32 - it is saying it is of type float over
02:34 - here and 1 plus 2 J it is of type
02:37 - complex over here so these are all
02:40 - numeric data types and inside the
02:42 - numeric data types these are described
02:43 - as integer float and complex values now
02:46 - apart from this guys we have other data
02:49 - types as well such as string that we had
02:50 - seen previously we have list as well
02:52 - Tuple and set so guys let us check this
02:55 - one at a time so over here what we will
02:57 - do is simply I'll provide Str and then I
03:00 - have provided the Str value as
03:02 - programming for beginners so what we
03:06 - will do over here is we want to find the
03:08 - type of this Str variable so what we can
03:11 - do is we can simply have the print
03:13 - statement followed by open and close
03:15 - parenthesis and we can simply have the
03:18 - type function so guys as you can see
03:19 - type is being Auto suggested over here
03:21 - we will select this and inside the open
03:24 - and close parenthesis we will use this
03:26 - variable so I'll just copy this and
03:28 - paste this over here that is Str and
03:30 - then when we save this file and try
03:31 - running this code now as you can see
03:33 - class that is Str is getting printed
03:36 - over here we can also have some string
03:38 - value over here that is first of all we
03:40 - are going to type Str that is the value
03:43 - of this Str and Then followed by comma
03:45 - and then we can simply have is of type
03:49 - inside the single quotes over here guys
03:52 - it is very important that whenever you
03:54 - want to type certain characters we
03:56 - should either have it inside the single
03:58 - quotes or double quotes as we have seen
04:00 - over here and then when we save this
04:02 - file and try running this code it will
04:03 - show us the data type of this string
04:05 - with a more sensible statement so as you
04:07 - can see programming for beginners this
04:09 - is the string value that we have given
04:11 - and then is of type now this is of type
04:14 - we have provided over here and then this
04:17 - type function that is Str it is
04:19 - returning the type of this Str variable
04:21 - which is class Str over here so this is
04:24 - of string data type now guys this Str
04:26 - over here it stands for string and not
04:29 - the name of this variable if I provide
04:31 - here something else then it will be more
04:33 - sensible so let's say if I provide
04:35 - statement over here as the name I'll
04:37 - copy this and paste this over here and
04:39 - when we run this code once again so as
04:41 - you can see it says class Str is of type
04:44 - class Str so since we have not replaced
04:46 - this Str with the statement that is why
04:48 - we are not getting it properly I'll run
04:51 - this code once again now so as you can
04:52 - see programming for beginners which is
04:54 - the value of this statement variable
04:56 - over here and then is of type and then
04:59 - we have class Str over here now apart
05:01 - from this we have other data types as
05:03 - well such as list which can be defined
05:05 - as the square brackets so what we have
05:07 - to do is let's say I provide a list 1 as
05:10 - the name of the variable and then equal
05:12 - to now guys list is nothing but it is a
05:14 - data type that have collection of
05:16 - elements so over here let's say we have
05:18 - collection of strings so let's say we
05:21 - have collection of fruits over here so
05:23 - the first fruit is Apple followed by
05:25 - comma and then again we have double
05:27 - quotes and then we have mango so all the
05:30 - elements are being separated using the
05:31 - comma over here as you can see and then
05:34 - let's say we have banana over here as
05:36 - the third fruit so what we can do is we
05:39 - can simply have print statement over
05:41 - here and then we can have type of this
05:45 - list one so I'll say list one over here
05:47 - when we save this file and try running
05:49 - this code now as you can see class list
05:52 - is getting printed so this is of data
05:54 - type that is list over here similarly we
05:56 - have Tuple and set as well which we are
05:58 - going to see in the upcoming videos what
06:00 - are the different contents of these data
06:02 - types and how do we use them and when do
06:04 - we use them so guys for now you just
06:06 - need to remember that whatever value
06:08 - that we provide to a particular variable
06:10 - automatically that data type will be
06:12 - assigned to that particular variable so
06:14 - guys that's it in this video please make
06:16 - sure that you like this video so that it
06:18 - reaches to more people and subscribe to
06:19 - the channel so that you get the
06:21 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
06:23 - the next video that we are going to talk
06:24 - about is python type conversion so stay
06:28 - tuned

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about python data types in which numeric string list Tuple set are included so Guys these are the different data types that we can see in this video and the upcoming videos as well so basically in computer programming data type specify the type of data that can be stored inside a variable so for example number it is equal to 24 so 24 value belongs to the numeric data type and this is the integer value inside the numeric data type we have many other data types such as integer value then we have float value as well in which there is a decimal point we have a complex value as well in which as you can see this expression that is 1 plus 2 J this is a complex expression so all these are having numeric data types over here so number over here is a numeric data type or the integer as you can see 24 is the value if it was 24.5 then we would say that number variable is of flow data type so guys let us check this with the help of example what we can do is we can simply copy these lines of code over here I'll copy this and we'll paste this over here now what we will do is this constant.py that we had created previously I'll just remove from our python folder over here since it is no longer needed and we will simply keep python code.py where we are going to write all the programs over here so guys over here I'll simply replace the content of this file by this content I'll save this file and over here in the terminal I'll simply clear the screen so as you can see num1 it is defined as 5 which is the

see if this file enter running this code now so as you can see 5 is of type Class end so this is of the integer data type 2.0 since it is having the decimal over here it is saying it is of type float over here and 1 plus 2 J it is of type complex over here so these are all numeric data types and inside the numeric data types these are described as integer float and complex values now apart from this guys we have other data types as well such as string that we had seen previously we have list as well Tuple and set so guys let us check this one at a time so over here what we will do is simply
