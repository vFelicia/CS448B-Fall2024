With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see 2D transform property
00:02 - in CSS so guys basically the CSS
00:05 - transform allows you to move rotate
00:08 - scale and skew the HTML elements that we
00:11 - Define inside our web page and this we
00:13 - are going to check with the help of
00:15 - multiple examples over here so guys
00:17 - before moving towards the examples let
00:19 - us understand the basic of the x-axis
00:22 - and the Y AIS that is going to be very
00:24 - important when you are going to use this
00:26 - transform property values so guys over
00:29 - here if you have already learned about
00:31 - the x-axis and Y AIS previously in your
00:34 - mathematics class basically we have the
00:36 - x-axis in the horizontal Direction over
00:39 - here so basically we have the x-axis in
00:42 - this way so this is the horizontal line
00:44 - that you can see which is xaxis over
00:46 - here simply we are going to provide the
00:48 - text box that is xaxis in this case so
00:51 - guys basically we can move the HTML
00:54 - elements in this particular direction
00:56 - when we provide the value as a positive
00:58 - value then the element will move towards
01:00 - the right in this case on the x-axis and
01:03 - when we provide the value as negative
01:06 - then the HTML element moves towards the
01:09 - left of the x-axis over here now guys
01:11 - similarly we have the Y AIS as well
01:13 - which is displayed in the vertical
01:15 - Direction so let us provide the y- axis
01:17 - as well so over here we have the Y AIS
01:20 - in the vertical Direction in this case
01:22 - so guys basically this is the Y AIS now
01:25 - guys it is very important to note that
01:26 - during our mathematics class we were
01:29 - told that the positive y AIS is on the
01:32 - top over here and the positive x-axis is
01:34 - on the right hand side so this is the
01:36 - first quadrant and Then followed by this
01:38 - is the second quadrant in which case the
01:40 - x-axis have the negative values and the
01:43 - Y AIS have the positive values but guys
01:45 - when we deal with the web browser what
01:47 - happens is our web browser is present
01:50 - inside this fourth quadrant over here so
01:52 - what will happen is when we provide the
01:54 - positive xais number the HTML element
01:57 - should move towards the right but when
01:59 - we provide the Y AIS as the positive
02:02 - number then the HTML element should move
02:04 - down in this case so guys basically this
02:06 - is the screen over here so I'll simply
02:09 - draw the screen as well in this case so
02:11 - this is the screen that we will be
02:12 - dealing with in our examples so guys now
02:15 - let us move to the different values that
02:17 - we can provide to the transform property
02:19 - so over here the first value that we can
02:21 - provide is the translate which will help
02:23 - us in order to move an element to the
02:26 - specified position so guys over here we
02:28 - can see that the translate is a function
02:30 - which will take parameters over here
02:32 - that is the first parameter will be the
02:34 - x-axis that is the length unit you have
02:37 - to provide in order to move the element
02:40 - towards the x-axis over here if it is
02:42 - positive then the element will move
02:44 - towards the right direction and if the
02:46 - value is negative then the HTML element
02:48 - will move towards the left Direction so
02:50 - guys let us check this with the help of
02:52 - examples in vs code over here so simply
02:54 - I'm going to remove the previous lines
02:56 - of code that we had written in the HTML
02:59 - and the style . CSS files now guys over
03:01 - here what we are going to do is simply
03:03 - we will have the div tag and it is going
03:05 - to have a specific width and height over
03:08 - here so simply we are going to say width
03:10 - of let's say 100 pixels this time and
03:13 - then the height as well of 100 pixels
03:15 - guys apart from this let us have certain
03:17 - border as well so let's say we have the
03:19 - border of two pixels and with border
03:22 - style as solid and the color is black
03:24 - color in this case and apart from this
03:26 - we will also have the background color
03:28 - of yellow so guys over here we have a
03:30 - simple diff tag and then guys apart from
03:32 - this let us have the diff tag at the
03:35 - center of the screen over here so right
03:36 - now the diff tag is at the top left what
03:39 - we want is we want to get the diff tag
03:41 - somewhere over here at the center of the
03:43 - screen so what we can do is simply we
03:45 - can provide the margin and we can say
03:48 - Auto so basically this is going to
03:50 - provide the automatic margin from the
03:52 - left and right and simply let's say we
03:54 - provide the 10% for the top and the
03:56 - bottom margin as well so let me just
03:58 - save this file now and try reloading
04:00 - this page so from the left and right we
04:03 - have the equal margin with the help of
04:05 - this Auto Value and from the top we are
04:07 - providing the 10% margin over here so it
04:10 - is somewhat at the middle of the screen
04:12 - let us increase this percentage to 15%
04:15 - let me just save this file now and try
04:16 - reloading this page as you can see we
04:18 - have the div element at the center of
04:20 - the screen now guys let us check the
04:22 - first example that is the translate
04:25 - function inside the transform property
04:27 - so guys what we will do is over here we
04:29 - are going to have the H effect for this
04:31 - particular div element so simply we are
04:33 - going to say div followed by colon and
04:36 - then we have the codo class that is over
04:38 - so guys what exactly we are going to do
04:40 - is when the user is going to get the
04:43 - cursor on this particular diff tag then
04:45 - we are going to see the different
04:46 - transform property values that we are
04:49 - going to Define so first of all we will
04:51 - see how this translate Works which means
04:53 - it moves an element to the specified
04:55 - position so guys let us check this so
04:57 - over here what we have to do is simp
04:59 - simply we have to use the transform CSS
05:02 - property and as you can see there are
05:04 - multiple methods that you can use these
05:06 - are nothing but the CSS functions that
05:08 - can be used over here and based on the
05:10 - project requirements you can use your
05:12 - own functions that are listed over here
05:15 - so the first function is the translate
05:17 - function which will take two parameters
05:19 - the first parameter is the x-axis so
05:21 - let's say we want to move the HTML
05:24 - element by 20 pixels on the right hand
05:26 - side so simply we can provide the value
05:29 - as 20x pixels so in this case what will
05:31 - happen is when we get the cursor over
05:33 - here on the diff tag this particular
05:35 - square box should move to the right and
05:37 - side by 20 pixels that we have defined
05:40 - over here so let me just save this file
05:42 - now and try reloading this page once
05:44 - again on the browser notice that this is
05:46 - the original position of the diff tag
05:48 - and the moment we get the cursor on this
05:50 - diff tag as you can see it has moved to
05:52 - the right hand side so if you see when
05:55 - we get the cursor back it is going back
05:57 - to the original position over here so
05:59 - guys in this way the translate property
06:01 - Works basically since we have only
06:03 - provided the value for the x-axis that
06:06 - is why it is just moving on the right
06:08 - hand side if we want to get this
06:09 - particular diff tag down as well so we
06:12 - will be providing the length unit for
06:14 - the second parameter as well so after
06:16 - this we need to provide comma and let's
06:18 - say we provide 50 pixels so by 50 pixels
06:21 - the diff tag should come down from the
06:24 - center of the screen so let me just save
06:26 - this file now andent TR reloading this
06:28 - page once again on the browser so when
06:30 - we get the cursor on this particular
06:32 - diff tag as you can see it is coming
06:34 - down as well so by 50 pixels the diff
06:37 - tag is coming down over here so guys in
06:39 - this way you can use the translate
06:40 - function inside the transform CSS
06:43 - property in order to move a particular
06:45 - HTML element to the specified position
06:48 - over here guys apart from this we also
06:50 - have something called as rotate which
06:52 - rotates an element clockwise or
06:54 - counterclockwise according to the given
06:57 - degree so guys let us check this as well
06:59 - with the help of example so over here
07:01 - instead of translate what we are going
07:03 - to do is on over of this particular diff
07:05 - tag simply we are going to use the
07:07 - rotate function over here and then guys
07:09 - what it is expecting is it is expecting
07:11 - the angle in terms of degrees so let's
07:14 - say we have 20째 over here by which this
07:16 - particular HTML element that is the diff
07:18 - tag which is a square box should rotate
07:21 - and it will rotate in the clockwise
07:23 - Direction by default so guys let me just
07:25 - save this file now and try reloading
07:27 - this page once again on the browser so
07:29 - when the user user gets the cursor on
07:30 - this particular box as you can see it
07:32 - has rotated on the right with the help
07:34 - of the 20째 that we had provided inside
07:37 - the rotate function so guys in this way
07:40 - the rotate function works over here let
07:42 - us increase the angle as well so if we
07:44 - increase it by 45째 let me just save this
07:47 - file now and try reloading this page so
07:49 - as you can see it is rotating by 45째
07:52 - over here in the clockwise Direction
07:54 - guys we can also change the direction
07:56 - that is we can rotate it in the
07:58 - counterclockwise Direction direction as
08:00 - well so what we have to do is instead of
08:02 - having the positive number we should
08:03 - have the negative number and provide the
08:06 - angle so let's say this time we provide
08:08 - -20째 so let me just save this file now
08:11 - and try reloading this page so if you
08:13 - notice it is now rotating itself in the
08:15 - counterclockwise Direction over here
08:17 - with the help of the negative angle that
08:19 - we have provided guys apart from this we
08:21 - also have something called a scale
08:23 - function which increases or decreases
08:25 - the size of an element so guys let us
08:27 - check this as well so again inside the
08:30 - over Udo class over here we have to use
08:32 - the scale function in this case so guys
08:35 - basically this is the function that we
08:36 - are going to use and simply we need to
08:38 - provide the number by which we want to
08:41 - increase the width and height of this
08:43 - particular HTML element so guys simply
08:45 - if we provide 1 comma 1 so over here
08:48 - there will be no change because this is
08:50 - the original scaling of the HTML element
08:53 - let me just save this file now and try
08:55 - reloading this page so as you can see
08:56 - when we get the cursor over here on the
08:59 - div element there is no change right now
09:01 - but the moment we increase this number
09:03 - so let's say we increase it to 1.5 over
09:05 - here as the width and 1.5 is the height
09:08 - of the HTML element so let me just save
09:10 - this file now and try reloading this
09:12 - page once again on the browser and when
09:14 - we get the cursor over here as you can
09:16 - see it has scaled to 1.5 * the width and
09:19 - the height of the original diff tag that
09:22 - we had defined so guys in this way you
09:24 - can scale up the HTML element that you
09:27 - want to scale by using this particular C
09:29 - SS function guys apart from this you can
09:31 - also decrease the size as well so any
09:33 - number lower than one in this case will
09:36 - decrease the size of the HTML element so
09:38 - let's say we change the number to 0.8
09:41 - over here as the width and height in
09:43 - this case let me just save this file now
09:45 - and try reloading this page so now if we
09:47 - get the cursor on this diff tag as you
09:49 - can see it is decreasing the size and
09:51 - the width and height is decreasing over
09:53 - here if you simply want to decrease the
09:55 - width so what we can do is we need to
09:57 - keep the height as zero in this case let
09:59 - me just save this file now and try
10:00 - reloading this so guys based on your
10:02 - project requirements you can scale up or
10:04 - scale down the HTML Elements by
10:06 - providing the units that you want to
10:09 - provide inside the CSS function that is
10:11 - scale in this case guys apart from this
10:13 - we also have something called as scale X
10:15 - and scale Y which will be scaling the
10:18 - width and height respectively for that
10:20 - particular HTML element so guys I'll
10:23 - leave this up to you as a homework for
10:24 - you so that you can practice on your own
10:27 - and understand these CSS functions more
10:29 - clearly guys apart from this we have
10:31 - something called a skew as well so it
10:33 - skes an element so basically it skes an
10:36 - element along the X and the Y AIS by the
10:38 - given angles so guys let us check this
10:40 - as well so over here what we have to do
10:42 - is instead of the scale function we will
10:44 - use the skew function this time and
10:47 - let's say we provide 10째 as the x-axis
10:50 - first of all let us check how the x-axis
10:52 - Q will work so let me just save this
10:54 - file now and try reloading this page
10:56 - once again on the browser so this is the
10:58 - original position of the diff tag and
11:00 - the moment we get the cursor as you can
11:02 - see it has changed its position so this
11:05 - is the functionality of the skew
11:06 - function that we have provided and the
11:08 - angle is 10째 over here by the x-axis and
11:11 - then guys again if we want the skew to
11:14 - be applied on the y axis as well simply
11:16 - we are going to say 20째 for the Y AIS
11:19 - component over here let me just save
11:21 - this file now and try reloading this
11:22 - page once again on the browser and when
11:24 - we get the cursor over here as you can
11:26 - see the x-axis is having this que of 10째
11:30 - in this case and the Y AIS as you can
11:32 - see from this top left to the right over
11:35 - here this particular direction this is
11:36 - the skew of the Y AIS in this case and
11:39 - it is 20째 in terms of angle so guys in
11:42 - this way you can provide the skew CSS
11:44 - function based on your project
11:46 - requirement guys apart from this you
11:47 - have something called as skew X and skew
11:50 - y as well which will skew along the
11:52 - x-axis and Y AIS respectively which we
11:54 - have already discussed with the help of
11:56 - this particular diagram previously so
11:58 - this is the x-axis in the horizontal
12:00 - Direction and this is the y- AIS in the
12:03 - vertical direction as far as two
12:05 - dimensional directions are concerned now
12:07 - because apart from this we also have
12:09 - something called as Matrix function
12:10 - which will help us in order to provide
12:12 - the numbers for all the functions that
12:15 - we have seen so far so guys this is the
12:17 - sequence that you must follow first of
12:19 - all we can provide the scale X number
12:21 - that we want to mention based on the
12:23 - requirements and Then followed by skew Y
12:25 - and then skew X and then we have the
12:27 - scale Y and then we have to translate X
12:29 - followed by Translate Y so guys let us
12:31 - check this example as well so we have
12:34 - the example Matrix function over here so
12:36 - the first parameter is one which means
12:38 - the scale X will be one in this case so
12:41 - basically it is not going to scale since
12:43 - we have provided one number over here so
12:45 - simply we can increase the scale value
12:47 - to 1.2 this time and then we have q y
12:50 - which is negative number SK X will not
12:53 - be implemented since it is zero and then
12:55 - again we have scale Y which we should
12:57 - increase over here to 1.2 once again and
13:00 - there is no translate X and Translate Y
13:02 - since we have provided the numbers as
13:04 - zero over here so guys let me just copy
13:06 - this line of code and paste it for this
13:08 - particular transform CSS property so
13:11 - what will happen let us check this as
13:12 - well so let me just save this file now
13:14 - and try reloading this page once again
13:16 - on the browser notice that we have
13:18 - provided the scale X and scale y values
13:20 - and also the skew X is in negative
13:23 - Direction over here so when we get the
13:25 - cursor on this particular diff tag as
13:27 - you can see the size of the diff tag
13:29 - that is a square box is increasing and
13:31 - this Q value of the 0.3 is helping us in
13:35 - order to tilt the square box in a
13:37 - particular direction over here guys
13:39 - apart from this we can also have the
13:41 - translate X and Translate Y numbers as
13:43 - well so what we will do is let's say we
13:45 - provide 100 pixels over here as
13:47 - translate X and 100 pixels as Translate
13:49 - Y so basically the Box should come
13:52 - somewhere over here on the bottom right
13:54 - so let us check that as well so when we
13:56 - reload this page and when we get the
13:57 - cursor over here as as you can see the
13:59 - square box is coming down over here on
14:02 - the right hand side in this case so guys
14:04 - in this way you can provide the metrix
14:06 - CSS function in order to provide the
14:08 - multiple values for all the functions
14:10 - that we have discussed so far which
14:12 - belongs to the transform CSS property so
14:15 - guys comment in the comment section
14:16 - below whether you have learned something
14:18 - out of this video please make sure that
14:20 - you like this video so that it reaches

14:27 - the next video that we are going to talk
14:28 - about is 3D transform property in CSS so
14:32 - stay tuned

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see 2D transform property in CSS so guys basically the CSS transform allows you to move rotate scale and skew the HTML elements that we Define inside our web page and this we are going to check with the help of multiple examples over here so guys before moving towards the examples let us understand the basic of the xaxis and the Y AIS that is going to be very important when you are going to use this transform property values so guys over here if you have already learned about the xaxis and Y AIS previously in your mathematics class basically we have the xaxis in the horizontal Direction over here so basically we have the xaxis in this way so this is the horizontal line that you can see which is xaxis over here simply we are going to provide the text box that is xaxis in this case so guys basically we can move the HTML elements in this particular direction when we provide the value as a positive value then the element will move towards the right in this case on the xaxis and when we provide the value as negative then the HTML element moves towards the left of the xaxis over here now guys similarly we have the Y AIS as well which is displayed in the vertical Direction so let us provide the y axis as well so over here we have the Y AIS in the vertical Direction in this case so guys basically this is the Y AIS now guys it is very important to note that during our mathematics class we were told that the positive y AIS is on the top over here and the positive xaxis is on the right hand side so this is the first quadrant and Then followed by this is the second quadrant in which case the xaxis have the negative values and the Y AIS have the positive values but guys when we deal with the web browser what happens is our web browser is present inside this fourth quadrant over here so what will happen is when we provide the positive xais number the HTML element should move towards the right but when we provide the Y AIS as the positive number then the HTML element should move down in this case so guys basically this is the screen over here so I'll simply draw the screen as well in this case so this is the screen that we will be dealing with in our examples so guys now let us move to the different values that we can provide to the transform property so over here the first value that we can provide is the translate which will help us in order to move an element to the specified position so guys over here we can see that the translate is a function which will take parameters over here that is the first parameter will be the xaxis that is the length unit you have to provide in order to move the element towards the xaxis over here if it is positive then the element will move towards the right direction and if the value is negative then the HTML element will move towards the left Direction so guys let us check this with the help of examples in vs code over here so simply I'm going to remove the previous lines of code that we had written in the HTML and the style . CSS files now guys over here what we are going to do is simply we will have the div tag and it is going to have a specific width and height over here so simply we are going to say width of let's say 100 pixels this time and then the height as well of 100 pixels guys apart from this let us have certain border as well so let's say we have the border of two pixels and with border style as solid and the color is black color in this case and apart from this we will also have the background color of yellow so guys over here we have a simple diff tag and then guys apart from this let us have the diff tag at the center of the screen over here so right now the diff tag is at the top left what we want is we want to get the diff tag somewhere over here at the center of the screen so what we can do is simply we can provide the margin and we can say Auto so basically this is going to provide the automatic margin from the left and right and simply let's say we provide the 10% for the top and the bottom margin as well so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so from the left and right we have the equal margin with the help of this Auto Value and from the top we are providing the 10% margin over here so it is somewhat at the middle of the screen let us increase this percentage to 15% let me just save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see we have the div element at the center of the screen now guys let us check the first example that is the translate function inside the transform property so guys what we will do is over here we are going to have the H effect for this particular div element so simply we are going to say div followed by colon and then we have the codo class that is over so guys what exactly we are going to do is when the user is going to get the cursor on this particular diff tag then we are going to see the different transform property values that we are going to Define so first of all we will see how this translate Works which means it moves an element to the specified position so guys let us check this so over here what we have to do is simp simply we have to use the transform CSS property and as you can see there are multiple methods that you can use these are nothing but the CSS functions that can be used over here and based on the project requirements you can use your own functions that are listed over here so the first function is the translate function which will take two parameters the first parameter is the xaxis so let's say we want to move the HTML element by 20 pixels on the right hand side so simply we can provide the value as 20x pixels so in this case what will happen is when we get the cursor over here on the diff tag this particular square box should move to the right and side by 20 pixels that we have defined over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser notice that this is the original position of the diff tag and the moment we get the cursor on this diff tag as you can see it has moved to the right hand side so if you see when we get the cursor back it is going back to the original position over here so guys in this way the translate property Works basically since we have only provided the value for the xaxis that is why it is just moving on the right hand side if we want to get this particular diff tag down as well so we will be providing the length unit for the second parameter as well so after this we need to provide comma and let's say we provide 50 pixels so by 50 pixels the diff tag should come down from the center of the screen so let me just save this file now andent TR reloading this page once again on the browser so when we get the cursor on this particular diff tag as you can see it is coming down as well so by 50 pixels the diff tag is coming down over here so guys in this way you can use the translate function inside the transform CSS property in order to move a particular HTML element to the specified position over here guys apart from this we also have something called as rotate which rotates an element clockwise or counterclockwise according to the given degree so guys let us check this as well with the help of example so over here instead of translate what we are going to do is on over of this particular diff tag simply we are going to use the rotate function over here and then guys what it is expecting is it is expecting the angle in terms of degrees so let's say we have 20째 over here by which this particular HTML element that is the diff tag which is a square box should rotate and it will rotate in the clockwise Direction by default so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so when the user user gets the cursor on this particular box as you can see it has rotated on the right with the help of the 20째 that we had provided inside the rotate function so guys in this way the rotate function works over here let us increase the angle as well so if we increase it by 45째 let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see it is rotating by 45째 over here in the clockwise Direction guys we can also change the direction that is we can rotate it in the counterclockwise Direction direction as well so what we have to do is instead of having the positive number we should have the negative number and provide the angle so let's say this time we provide 20째 so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so if you notice it is now rotating itself in the counterclockwise Direction over here with the help of the negative angle that we have provided guys apart from this we also have something called a scale function which increases or decreases the size of an element so guys let us check this as well so again inside the over Udo class over here we have to use the scale function in this case so guys basically this is the function that we are going to use and simply we need to provide the number by which we want to increase the width and height of this particular HTML element so guys simply if we provide 1 comma 1 so over here there will be no change because this is the original scaling of the HTML element let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see when we get the cursor over here on the div element there is no change right now but the moment we increase this number so let's say we increase it to 1.5 over here as the width and 1.5 is the height of the HTML element so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser and when we get the cursor over here as you can see it has scaled to 1.5 * the width and the height of the original diff tag that we had defined so guys in this way you can scale up the HTML element that you want to scale by using this particular C SS function guys apart from this you can also decrease the size as well so any number lower than one in this case will decrease the size of the HTML element so let's say we change the number to 0.8 over here as the width and height in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so now if we get the cursor on this diff tag as you can see it is decreasing the size and the width and height is decreasing over here if you simply want to decrease the width so what we can do is we need to keep the height as zero in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this so guys based on your project requirements you can scale up or scale down the HTML Elements by providing the units that you want to provide inside the CSS function that is scale in this case guys apart from this we also have something called as scale X and scale Y which will be scaling the width and height respectively for that particular HTML element so guys I'll leave this up to you as a homework for you so that you can practice on your own and understand these CSS functions more clearly guys apart from this we have something called a skew as well so it skes an element so basically it skes an element along the X and the Y AIS by the given angles so guys let us check this as well so over here what we have to do is instead of the scale function we will use the skew function this time and let's say we provide 10째 as the xaxis first of all let us check how the xaxis Q will work so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so this is the original position of the diff tag and the moment we get the cursor as you can see it has changed its position so this is the functionality of the skew function that we have provided and the angle is 10째 over here by the xaxis and then guys again if we want the skew to be applied on the y axis as well simply we are going to say 20째 for the Y AIS component over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser and when we get the cursor over here as you can see the xaxis is having this que of 10째 in this case and the Y AIS as you can see from this top left to the right over here this particular direction this is the skew of the Y AIS in this case and it is 20째 in terms of angle so guys in this way you can provide the skew CSS function based on your project requirement guys apart from this you have something called as skew X and skew y as well which will skew along the xaxis and Y AIS respectively which we have already discussed with the help of this particular diagram previously so this is the xaxis in the horizontal Direction and this is the y AIS in the vertical direction as far as two dimensional directions are concerned now because apart from this we also have something called as Matrix function which will help us in order to provide the numbers for all the functions that we have seen so far so guys this is the sequence that you must follow first of all we can provide the scale X number that we want to mention based on the requirements and Then followed by skew Y and then skew X and then we have the scale Y and then we have to translate X followed by Translate Y so guys let us check this example as well so we have the example Matrix function over here so the first parameter is one which means the scale X will be one in this case so basically it is not going to scale since we have provided one number over here so simply we can increase the scale value to 1.2 this time and then we have q y which is negative number SK X will not be implemented since it is zero and then again we have scale Y which we should increase over here to 1.2 once again and there is no translate X and Translate Y since we have provided the numbers as zero over here so guys let me just copy this line of code and paste it for this particular transform CSS property so what will happen let us check this as well so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser notice that we have provided the scale X and scale y values and also the skew X is in negative Direction over here so when we get the cursor on this particular diff tag as you can see the size of the diff tag that is a square box is increasing and this Q value of the 0.3 is helping us in order to tilt the square box in a particular direction over here guys apart from this we can also have the translate X and Translate Y numbers as well so what we will do is let's say we provide 100 pixels over here as translate X and 100 pixels as Translate Y so basically the Box should come somewhere over here on the bottom right so let us check that as well so when we reload this page and when we get the cursor over here as as you can see the square box is coming down over here on the right hand side in this case so guys in this way you can provide the metrix CSS function in order to provide the multiple values for all the functions that we have discussed so far which belongs to the transform CSS property so guys comment in the
