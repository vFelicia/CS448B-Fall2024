00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:04 - Python program to merge two dictionaries
00:06 - so guys there are multiple ways in order
00:08 - to merge dictionaries over here as you
00:10 - can see we are going to check three ways
00:12 - in order to merge dictionaries so the
00:15 - very first way is using the or operator
00:18 - over here so guys let us check this
00:19 - using the Python program in vs code over
00:22 - here so the very first thing that we
00:24 - will be doing is we will Define two
00:26 - dictionaries that is dictionary one it
00:28 - is equal to and then we have the key
00:30 - that is one and then colon we can say a
00:34 - and Then followed by comma and then we
00:36 - have another key that is to colon and
00:39 - then the value of this key it is equal
00:40 - to P so guys let us say we have this as
00:43 - dictionary one over here and then let's
00:45 - say we have dictionary 2 as well and
00:48 - inside this we will again have the key
00:50 - over here is 2 followed by colon and
00:53 - then this time we will provide the value
00:55 - as C and then comma and then let's say
00:57 - we have the key as fourth and then go
01:00 - learn and then over here we have the
01:03 - value of this KSD so guys this is the
01:05 - way that we can initialize the
01:07 - dictionary which is having the key value
01:08 - page over here the key is the integer
01:11 - data type in this case and the value it
01:13 - is of the character or the string data
01:16 - type over here now guys when we are
01:17 - merging which means we are making both
01:19 - these dictionaries combined into one
01:22 - dictionary over here as you can see it
01:24 - is having the same key that is 2 which
01:26 - is having the value of B in the first
01:28 - dictionary and the key that is 2 it is
01:31 - having the value as C in the second
01:33 - dictionary so guys always remember that
01:35 - whenever we are merging the two
01:37 - dictionaries if the same key is present
01:39 - in both the dictionaries then the value
01:42 - of the latest dictionary will be taken
01:44 - for that particular key so guys we will
01:46 - check this with the help of example as
01:48 - well when we are printing the merging of
01:50 - these dictionaries so the very first way
01:52 - in order to merge the two dictionaries
01:54 - is to using this or operator so how we
01:58 - can use that we can simply put provide
02:00 - the print statement and inside this we
02:02 - will provide dictionary 1 that is the
02:04 - ICT one over here followed by our
02:07 - operator in this case and then we have
02:09 - dict2 that is dictionary two so guys
02:12 - this is as simple as you can see over
02:14 - here in order to merge the two
02:16 - dictionaries when we save this file now
02:18 - and try running this code as you can see
02:21 - we have got one dictionary having all
02:23 - the key value pairs so the key that is
02:26 - one it is having the value as a and then
02:28 - the key that is 2 is having the value as
02:30 - C from the second dictionary and this
02:33 - proves that the latest value of the same
02:36 - key will be taken whenever the keys are
02:38 - present in multiple dictionaries and we
02:40 - are merging them and then as for the key
02:43 - that is 4 we are having the value as d
02:45 - as well because this is one of the ways
02:47 - in which we can merge two dictionaries
02:49 - over here now guys there is another way
02:51 - in order to merge the dictionary by
02:53 - using this double star operator so how
02:55 - we can do that simply again we will be
02:58 - using the print statement over here so
03:00 - I'll just comment out this line in this
03:02 - case and then we will have another print
03:05 - statement over here what we have to do
03:07 - is we have to use the open and close
03:09 - curly braces this time and then we have
03:12 - to use two time star characters and
03:14 - mention the dictionary variable name so
03:17 - dict1 followed by comma and then again 2
03:21 - times star characters and then we have
03:24 - dict2 that is dictionary two so guys
03:26 - both the dictionaries needs to be
03:28 - mentioned with these double stars as the
03:31 - prefix and then both of them should be
03:33 - present inside the open and close curly
03:36 - braces in order to merge them now guys
03:38 - let me just save this file now and try
03:40 - running this code so as you can see we
03:42 - have got the key value page that is all
03:45 - the key value passed from both the
03:46 - dictionaries over here and we have
03:48 - successfully merged both the
03:50 - dictionaries guys the Third Way is to
03:52 - use the copy and update method over here
03:55 - so what we can do is simply I'll just
03:57 - comment out this line once again and
03:59 - what we will will be doing is we will be
04:01 - creating a third dictionary so we will
04:04 - say dict3 in this case it is equal to
04:07 - what we will do is first of all we will
04:09 - copy the first dictionary inside this
04:11 - dictionary three so we will be using
04:14 - dict1 followed by Dot and then we have
04:17 - something called as copy so guys this is
04:19 - a method that will help us in order to
04:22 - copy the content of dictionary 1 into
04:24 - dictionary 3 over here so guys the
04:27 - content of dictionary 1 is present in
04:28 - dictionary three right now so if you
04:31 - simply provide a print statement with
04:33 - this variable name that is dictionary 3
04:35 - so we provide dict3 it should have the
04:39 - same content that is present inside
04:40 - dictionary one so let me just save this
04:43 - file now and try running the score so as
04:45 - you can see we have got the key that is
04:47 - 1 which is having the value a and key 2
04:50 - is having the value of p and this is the
04:52 - same content that is present inside
04:54 - dictionary one now guys how do we get
04:56 - the content of dictionary 2 inside this
04:58 - dictionary 3 over here so simply we can
05:01 - use the update method at this time so
05:03 - over here we will provide dictionary 3
05:06 - followed by Dot and then we have
05:08 - something called as update method and
05:10 - then this update method will take the
05:13 - parameter that means another dictionary
05:15 - over here so I provide dictionary 2 this
05:18 - time because we need to update it with
05:21 - the dictionary 2 in this case so guys
05:23 - this is the copy and update method that
05:25 - can help us in order to merge multiple
05:28 - dictionaries over here so let me just
05:30 - save this file now and try running this
05:31 - code once again so as you can see we
05:33 - have got the key that is 1 it is equal
05:36 - to a key 2 is equal to C and key 4 is
05:39 - equal to D so guys over here the key
05:41 - that is 2 it is equal to C is being
05:43 - included over here and key 4 with d is
05:46 - also included basically all the keys and
05:49 - values we have already got inside
05:51 - dictionary 3 which is being printed over
05:53 - here on the Domino so Guys these are the
05:55 - three ways in order to merge multiple
05:57 - dictionaries and print them according
05:59 - please make sure that you practice on
06:01 - your own so that on different inputs you
06:03 - get different outputs make sure that you
06:05 - like this video so that it reaches to
06:07 - more people and subscribe to this
06:09 - channel so that you get the
06:10 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
06:12 - the next video that we are going to talk
06:14 - about is Python program to slice list so

2 as well and inside this we will again have the key over here is 2 followed by colon and then this time we will provide the value as C and then comma and then let's say we have the key as fourth and then go learn and then over here we have the value of this KSD so guys this is the way that we can initialize the dictionary which is having the key value page over here the key is the integer data type in this case and the value it is of the character or the string data type over here now guys when we are merging which means we are making both these dictionaries combined into one dictionary over here as you can see it is having the same key that is 2 which is having the value of B in the first dictionary and the key that is 2 it is having the value as C in the second dictionary so guys always remember that whenever we are merging the two dictionaries if the same key is present in both the dictionaries then the value of the latest dictionary will be taken for that particular key so guys we will check this with the help of example as well when we are printing the merging of these dictionaries so the very first way in order to merge the two dictionaries is to using this or operator so how we can use that we can simply put provide the print statement and inside this we will provide dictionary 1 that is the ICT one over here followed by our operator in this case and then we have dict2 that is dictionary two so guys this is as simple as you can see over here in order to merge the two dictionaries when we save this file now and try running this code as you can see we have got one dictionary having all the key value pairs so the key that is one it is having the value as a and then the key that is 2 is having the value as C from the second dictionary and this proves that the latest value of the same key will be taken whenever the keys are present in multiple dictionaries and we are merging them and then as for the key that is 4 we are having the value as d as well because this is one of the ways in which we can merge two dictionaries over here now guys there is another way in order to merge the dictionary by using this double star operator so how we can do

content of dictionary 1 into dictionary 3 over here so guys the content of dictionary 1 is present in dictionary three right now so if you simply provide a print statement with this variable name that is dictionary 3 so we provide dict3 it should have the same content that is present inside dictionary one so let me just save this file now and try running the score so as you can see we have got the key that is 1 which is having the value a and key 2 is having the value of p and this is the same content that is present inside dictionary one now guys how do we get the content of dictionary 2 inside this dictionary 3 over here so simply we can use the update method at this time so over here we will provide dictionary 3 followed by Dot and then we have something called as update method and then this update method will take the parameter that means another dictionary over here so I provide dictionary 2 this time because we need to update it with the dictionary 2 in this case so guys this is the copy and update method that can help us in order to merge multiple dictionaries over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see we have got the key that is 1 it is equal to a key 2 is equal to C and key 4 is equal to D so guys over here the key that is 2 it is equal to C is being included over here and key 4 with d is also included basically all the keys and values we have already got inside dictionary 3 which is being printed over here on the Domino so Guys these are the three ways in order to merge multiple dictionaries and
