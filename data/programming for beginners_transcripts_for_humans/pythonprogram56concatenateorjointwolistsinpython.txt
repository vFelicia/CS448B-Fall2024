00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:04 - Python program to concatenate two lists
00:06 - so guys this Python program will help
00:09 - you to concatenate or join to list using
00:12 - these methods so over here we are going
00:14 - to check the four methods with the help
00:16 - of examples so the very first method is
00:18 - using the plus operator so let us check
00:20 - this with the help of example in vs code
00:22 - so guys let's say we have list one over
00:25 - here and we Define this list one as one
00:28 - two three and then four so four elements
00:31 - are present in this list one and then
00:32 - let's say we have list two which is
00:35 - having two elements over here which is
00:37 - 11 and 12 so over here we say 11 and
00:40 - then 12. so here simply we can use the
00:42 - plus operator in order to concatenate
00:45 - the list just like how we concatenate
00:47 - two strings over here so simply if we
00:49 - have the result list over here so let's
00:52 - say we have the variable name as a
00:54 - result it is equal to list one plus and
00:57 - then we say list two over here so guys
00:59 - this is the expression that we can use
01:01 - in order to concatenate or join two
01:04 - lists and then simply we can have the
01:06 - print statement and then we can say the
01:09 - result list and Then followed by colon
01:12 - and then we can simply have the result
01:14 - list over here that is the variable
01:16 - result in this case so guys let me just
01:19 - save this file now and try running this
01:21 - code so as you can see we have the
01:22 - result list over here and it is just one
01:24 - list which is having six elements that
01:27 - is one two three four and then we also
01:29 - have 11 and then 12 in this case so guys
01:31 - this is one of the ways in which we can
01:33 - concatenate or join to a list now guys
01:36 - let us move to the other approach that
01:38 - is using the iterable unpacking operator
01:40 - that is star so guys over here what we
01:43 - can do is simply instead of using this
01:45 - expression we can use another expression
01:47 - as well so guys simply we can have the
01:49 - open and close square brackets and Then
01:51 - followed by star and then we can have
01:53 - list one over here so guys before
01:55 - mentioning the variable that is list one
01:58 - we have this particular star that is
02:00 - being mentioned as a prefix and Then
02:02 - followed by comma the second variable
02:04 - name that is list 2 as well before which
02:07 - there should be a star character that
02:09 - must be present so over here we have
02:11 - star and Then followed by list two so
02:13 - guys this is another way that is using
02:16 - the iterable unpacking operator star
02:18 - using which we can concatenate Multiple
02:21 - List over here so guys the result will
02:23 - be stored in this result variable and we
02:25 - will have the result list displayed on
02:27 - the terminal so let me just save this
02:29 - file now before running this code what
02:31 - we can do is simply we can add some more
02:33 - content in the list two as well so that
02:36 - it differs from the result that was
02:37 - already printed in the previous approach
02:40 - so guys let me just save this file now
02:42 - and try running this code once again so
02:44 - as you can see we are getting one list
02:46 - over here having eight elements one two
02:48 - three four and then we have 11 12 13 and
02:51 - then 14. so guys this is another
02:53 - approach in order to join or concatenate
02:56 - two or Multiple List now guys let us
02:58 - move to another approach over here here
03:00 - we can also concatenate multiple lists
03:02 - using the unique values by using the set
03:05 - function over here so guys what we will
03:07 - do is we will have certain elements that
03:09 - are common in both the list so let's say
03:12 - we have 2 comma 3 and then 5 and then 6
03:15 - over here so guys 2 and 3 elements in
03:18 - both the list are common in this case so
03:20 - what we will do is we will simply have
03:22 - the concatenation but using the set
03:25 - method over here so guys as you must be
03:27 - aware using the set method what happens
03:29 - is only the unique values will be
03:32 - returned so in this case 2 and 3 should
03:35 - be returned only once and it will be
03:37 - stored in this result variable so the
03:40 - set method will take both the list over
03:42 - here so inside this we can provide a
03:44 - list one and then followed by plus and
03:47 - then list 2 in this case so guys this is
03:49 - the approach that we have already seen
03:51 - in the first example that is using the
03:53 - plus operator we are getting the result
03:56 - list that is list one plus list two but
03:58 - then it is converted to a set in which
04:01 - case 2 and 3 will be considered only
04:03 - once and then guys this set will be
04:06 - converted back again to the list in this
04:08 - case so we can provide a list and then
04:11 - this entire expression must be inside
04:13 - the open and close brackets over here so
04:15 - guys first of all we are concatenating
04:17 - both the list and then using the set
04:20 - method we are only getting the unique
04:22 - values and then after that we are
04:24 - converting those unique values into the
04:26 - list by using this list function and
04:28 - then storing it inside the result
04:30 - variable so guys let me just save this
04:32 - file now and try running this code once
04:34 - again so as you can see we are getting
04:36 - one two three four five and then six so
04:39 - guys only unique values are present over
04:41 - here that's because we have used the set
04:43 - method in order to concatenate and join
04:46 - two lists over here now guys let us move
04:48 - to another approach the last approach is
04:50 - using the extend method so what we can
04:53 - do is using the extend method we can
04:55 - concatenate the elements of one list
04:58 - into another list over here here so what
05:00 - we can do is let's say we have list one
05:03 - in this case so we say list one and then
05:05 - followed by dot we have something called
05:07 - as extend method which takes another
05:10 - list or maybe it takes another element
05:12 - in order to add it into list one in this
05:15 - case so what we can do is simply provide
05:17 - the list 2 over here which is another
05:19 - iterable so when we provide this what
05:22 - happens is the content of the list one
05:24 - will be displayed as it is but the
05:27 - content of the list 2 will also be added
05:29 - to list one and then guys we can simply
05:31 - print the list one in order to get the
05:34 - entire content of list one over here so
05:36 - when we say the result list we have to
05:38 - provide the list one variable in this
05:40 - case so let me just give this file now
05:42 - and try running this code once again so
05:44 - as you can see we have got the result
05:46 - list as one two three four which are the
05:48 - elements of the list one and then guys
05:51 - again we have two three five six as you
05:53 - can see two three five six are being
05:55 - displayed over here which is the content
05:57 - of the list two which we passed to the
05:59 - extend method over here in order to
06:02 - concatenate both the list so Guys these
06:04 - are all the four approaches in order to
06:06 - concatenate and join two lists please
06:08 - make sure that you practice on your own
06:10 - so that on different inputs you get
06:12 - different outputs make sure that you
06:13 - like this video so that if it reaches to
06:15 - more people and subscribe to this
06:17 - channel so that you get the
06:18 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
06:20 - the next video that we are going to talk
06:22 - about is Python program to split a list
06:25 - into evenly sized chunks so stay tuned
