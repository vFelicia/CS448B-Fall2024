With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see input attribute list
00:02 - in input field so guys basically the
00:05 - input list attribute refers to the data
00:08 - list element that contains the
00:10 - predefined options for an input element
00:13 - so basically in case you want to have
00:16 - the list of elements to be displayed
00:18 - with the help of the input element then
00:21 - you can have the input along with the
00:23 - list attribute over here and you can
00:25 - provide the ID of the data list element
00:28 - that you can Define later on so guys
00:30 - basically this input tag will now have
00:33 - the list of drop- down items from which
00:36 - the user can select one of the items so
00:38 - guys let us check this with the help of
00:40 - examples in vs code over here so
00:42 - previously we had defined the input tag
00:44 - with the type text over here which was
00:46 - having the F name that is the first name
00:49 - that the user wants to Define and also
00:51 - we had the submit button in the form of
00:54 - the image so guys what we will do is
00:56 - after this first input tag we will have
00:58 - another input tag tag over here so this
01:01 - time we are not going to Define any type
01:03 - over here but instead of this we are
01:05 - going to have the list attribute so guys
01:08 - basically the input tag along with the
01:10 - list attribute will help us in order to
01:13 - have the drop-down list in this case so
01:16 - over here let's say we provide the value
01:18 - as list one so guys basically this
01:21 - should be the ID of the data list tag
01:24 - that we are going to Define now so
01:26 - basically after this input tag we can
01:28 - Define the data list tag as well so in
01:31 - this case we Define data list tag and
01:33 - then inside this data list tag we can
01:36 - have the ID in this case so the ID must
01:39 - be equal to the value of this list
01:42 - attribute that we had defined so I'll
01:44 - just simply copy this and paste this
01:46 - over here as the ID attribute of the
01:49 - data list tag and then guys we can have
01:51 - the list of items that we want to
01:54 - display So currently if we check the web
01:55 - page there will be no items that will be
01:57 - displayed so let me just check this I'll
02:00 - save this file now and try reloading
02:02 - this page on the browser so as you can
02:04 - see we have this input field being
02:06 - displayed over here there are no values
02:08 - that is being displayed right now inside
02:10 - this input field guys what we will do is
02:12 - we will replace this particular image
02:14 - with the submit Button as well so over
02:16 - here after the data list we will have
02:19 - couple of line breaks in this case and
02:21 - then instead of having the input tag
02:23 - along with the Type image over here we
02:26 - will simply have the input tag along
02:28 - with the type submit and in this case so
02:30 - that a simple text value can be
02:32 - displayed with the help of the submit
02:34 - button so over here we have the value as
02:36 - submit so let me just save this file now
02:38 - and try reloading this page once again
02:40 - on the browser so now as you can see we
02:42 - have the submit button but the important
02:44 - thing is we need to have certain drop-
02:47 - down values over here so that the user
02:49 - can select one of the values from this
02:51 - list so guys over here what we have to
02:54 - do is inside this data list tag we need
02:57 - to Define our options with the help of
02:59 - the op option tag so over here simply we
03:01 - will have the option tag in this case we
03:04 - can remove the ending tag over here so
03:06 - I'll simply remove this and then we can
03:08 - have different options inside the value
03:10 - attribute of the option tag so let's say
03:13 - we have the label for this input tag as
03:15 - the mode of Transport so over here for
03:17 - the input part we will also have the ID
03:20 - as well and then we will say transport
03:23 - in this case and the same ID we can
03:25 - provide it as the value for the for
03:27 - attribute over here and then we can say
03:29 - select your mode of Transport so guys
03:33 - basically we are asking the user to
03:35 - select the mode of transport and then we
03:37 - will have the list of options from which
03:39 - the user can select the mode of
03:41 - Transport so let's say we provide the
03:43 - first option as bike in this case and
03:45 - some more couple of options over here so
03:47 - we will say car and the third option is
03:49 - bus in this case so guys we have three
03:52 - options over here that is bike car and
03:54 - bus so guys let me just save this file
03:56 - now and try reloading this page once
03:58 - again on the browser so now as you can
04:00 - see select your mode of Transport label
04:02 - is being displayed and if you see over
04:04 - here there's a drop down that is getting
04:06 - displayed right now inside this input
04:08 - field and when we click on this drop-
04:10 - down option as you can see bike car and
04:13 - bus options are getting displayed over
04:15 - here so we can simply select one of the
04:17 - options so let's say we Select Car in
04:19 - this case so basically this particular
04:21 - option is getting selected and then
04:23 - simply we can click on submit button
04:25 - over here so that the parameter gets
04:27 - submitted to the server but guys in this
04:29 - case we we are only able to see F name
04:31 - over here that's because for the input
04:33 - field we have not provided the name
04:36 - attribute and it is very important that
04:38 - whenever you are passing any of the
04:40 - values from the HTML form then you
04:43 - should have the name attribute as well
04:45 - so in this case we will provide the name
04:47 - attribute as the value that is same as
04:49 - ID in this case so let me just provide
04:51 - the transport value over here guys what
04:54 - if we provide the ending tag for the
04:55 - option in this case so let me just
04:57 - provide that as well to all the three of
04:59 - options and then we will also provide
05:01 - the value in between the option tags
05:03 - over here so we will say bike and then
05:05 - we have car and then we have bus over
05:08 - here as all the three options being
05:10 - displayed as text over here so let me
05:12 - just save this file now and try
05:13 - reloading this page once again on the
05:15 - browser so now if we go and select the
05:17 - mode of Transport over here in this case
05:19 - so let's say we select car as the option
05:22 - and first name as John and then let me
05:24 - just click on submit button so as you
05:26 - can see F name is getting displayed over
05:28 - here as John which is getting passed as
05:30 - the part of URL that's because we have
05:33 - provided the method as get request over
05:35 - here for the form tag and then the
05:37 - second parameter that is transport is
05:40 - being displayed with the value of car
05:42 - that the user selected While submitting
05:44 - the form so guys in this way you can
05:46 - easily have the drop- down options with
05:48 - the help of the input tag and along with
05:50 - it you can provide the list attribute
05:53 - which will have the value of the ID of
05:55 - the data list element that you are going
05:58 - to Define just like how we have defined
06:00 - over here that is the data list element
06:02 - and inside the data list element you can
06:04 - have different options over here along
06:06 - with their values in this case from
06:08 - which the user can select one of the
06:10 - values so guys comment in the comment

type over here but instead of this we are going to have the list attribute so guys basically the input tag along with the list attribute will help us in order to have the dropdown list in this case so over here let's say we provide the value as list one so guys basically this should be the ID of the data list tag that we are going to Define now so basically after this input tag we can Define the data list tag as well so in this case we Define data list tag and then inside this data list tag we can have the ID in this case so the ID must be equal to the value of this list attribute that we had defined so I'll just simply copy this and paste this over here as the ID attribute of the data list tag and then guys we can have the list of items that we want to display So currently if we check the web page there will be no items that will be displayed so let me just check this I'll save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have this input field being displayed over here there are no values that is being displayed right now inside this input field guys what we will do is we will replace this particular image with the submit Button as well so over here after the data list we will have couple of line breaks in this case and then instead of having the input tag along with the Type image over here we will simply have the input tag along with the

reloading this page once again on the browser so now as you can see we have the submit button but the important thing is we need to have certain drop down values over here so that the user can select one of the values from this list so guys over here what we have to do is inside this data list tag we need to Define our options with the help of the op option tag so over here simply we will have the option tag in this case we can remove the ending tag over here so I'll simply remove this and then we can have different options inside the value attribute of the option tag so let's say we have the label for this input tag as the mode of Transport so over here for the input part we will also have the ID as well and then we will say transport in this case and the same ID we can provide it as the value for the for attribute over here and then we can say select your mode of Transport so guys basically we are asking the user to select the mode of transport and then we will have the list of options from which the user can select the mode of Transport so let's say we provide the first option as bike in this case and some more couple of options over here so we will say car and the third option is bus in this case so guys we have three options over here that is bike car and bus so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now as you can see select your mode of Transport label is being displayed and if you see over here there's a drop down that is getting displayed right now inside this input field and when we click on this drop down option as you can see bike car and bus options are getting displayed over here so we can simply select one of the options so let's say we Select Car in this case so basically this particular
