00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to get a substring of a
00:06 - string so guys this Python program will
00:09 - help you to get the substring of a
00:11 - string so we can use slicing in Python
00:13 - in order to print the substrings now
00:16 - guys the substring is nothing but it is
00:18 - a part of a string that we want to print
00:20 - on the terminal so guys let us move to
00:22 - the vs code over here let's say we have
00:24 - a string that is programming for
00:26 - beginners which is the name of this
00:28 - YouTube channel that you should
00:30 - definitely subscribe if you have not
00:32 - done so so over here we have the value
00:34 - as programming for beginners now guys
00:37 - let us say we want to only display
00:38 - programming word over here so how do we
00:41 - do that so over here simply we can have
00:43 - the print keyword followed by open and
00:46 - close brackets and then inside this we
00:48 - can provide the Str variable now guys we
00:51 - can easily provide the indices inside
00:54 - the open and close square brackets over
00:56 - here so the very first index it will be
00:59 - equal to 0 because because we want to
01:00 - start from this letter that is p so the
01:03 - start index it is equal to 0 and then we
01:06 - have to provide a colon and then we can
01:08 - simply provide the end index and that is
01:10 - how the slicing works so what will be
01:12 - the end index over here we need to count
01:14 - the number of letters we have the
01:16 - indices over here as 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
01:24 - 10. so we have 10 letters over here this
01:27 - last letter it belongs to the 10th index
01:29 - but guys we need to give an extra index
01:32 - which is not included over here so when
01:34 - we provide 11 the 11th index will not be
01:37 - included that is the space will not be
01:39 - included but the G letter will be
01:42 - included so only from 0 up to 10 index
01:45 - numbers will be included over here in
01:48 - this string slicing guys this is the way
01:50 - that we find the substring from the
01:52 - given original string let me just save
01:54 - this file now and try running this code
01:56 - so as you can see we have got
01:58 - programming word which is the substring
01:59 - of this original string over here now
02:02 - guys let us say we want this beginners
02:04 - to be displayed so what we can do is
02:06 - again we can count the indices so G was
02:09 - at the 10th index and then we have 11
02:11 - over here and then these are the indices
02:13 - that is 11 12 13 14 15 and 16. so this B
02:19 - character is starting from the 16th
02:21 - index so instead of 0 over here we have
02:23 - to start from the 16 and then guys in
02:26 - order to go up to the end of the string
02:29 - we need not have to provide any end
02:31 - index over here so after the 16 being
02:34 - mentioned as the start index we provide
02:36 - a colon and then if we don't provide the
02:38 - end index which means all the characters
02:40 - from the 16th index will be considered
02:43 - over here in order to be printed now
02:45 - guys let me just see if this file now
02:47 - enter running this code once again as
02:49 - you can see we have quality beginner's
02:51 - word over here being printed on the
02:53 - terminal now guys let us include some
02:55 - more characters over here in order to
02:57 - check whether those are being included
02:59 - or not when we we are providing just the
03:01 - start index and not the end index so
03:03 - let's say we have a b c d over here and
03:06 - then we have X Y and Z along with the
03:09 - space characters as well so let me just
03:11 - save this file now this time also we
03:13 - should get beginners but then we should
03:15 - also get ABCD and then XYZ that's
03:17 - because we have not provided the end
03:19 - index over here so let me just run this
03:22 - code once again so as you can see we
03:24 - have got beginners a b c d x y z so guys
03:27 - this is the way in order to get the
03:29 - substring from a original string based
03:31 - on your requirements the string slicing
03:33 - also has the third parameter so after
03:36 - this colon if you don't want to provide
03:38 - the second parameter we provide the
03:40 - colon once again and then we can provide
03:42 - the third parameter as well which is the
03:45 - step parameter so let's say we want to
03:47 - ignore the characters at these even
03:49 - positions that is e and then I and then
03:51 - this n over here and then R over here so
03:54 - we provide the step as 2 over here by
03:57 - default the step will be 1 so all the
03:59 - character will be considered but when we
04:01 - provide the step is to alternate
04:03 - characters will be ignored over here and
04:06 - only the other characters will be
04:07 - displayed so let me just save this file
04:09 - now and try running this code once again
04:11 - so as you can see we have got capital B
04:13 - followed by G and then we have n over
04:16 - here and then we should have e s and
04:19 - then a and then C so the same things are
04:22 - being displayed over here e s AC
04:24 - followed by a space character and then
04:26 - in the end we have got y over here now
04:29 - guys similarly we can also provide minus
04:31 - 1 in order to display all these
04:33 - characters in the reverse order so when
04:35 - we save this file now and try running
04:37 - this code once again so as you can see
04:39 - we have got this programming for and
04:41 - then up to B we have got all the data
04:44 - which is in the reverse format so guys
04:46 - this is the way that we can use in order
04:48 - to extract the substring from the
04:50 - original string please make sure that
04:52 - you practice on your own so that on
04:54 - different inputs you get different
04:55 - outputs make sure that you like this
04:57 - video so that it reaches to more people
04:59 - and And subscribe to the channel so that
05:01 - you get the notifications on upcoming
05:03 - videos as well the next video that we
05:05 - are going to talk about is Python
05:06 - program to print output without a new
05:09 - line so stay tuned

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to get a substring of a string so guys this Python program will help you to get the substring of a string so we can use slicing in Python in order to print the substrings now guys the substring is nothing but it is a part of a string that we want to print on the terminal so guys let us move to the vs code over here let's say we have a string that is programming for beginners which is the name of this YouTube channel that you should definitely subscribe if you have not done so so over here we have the value as programming for beginners now guys let us say we want to only display programming word over here so how do we do that so over here simply we can have the print keyword followed by open and close brackets and then inside this we can provide the Str variable now guys we can easily provide the indices inside the open and close square brackets over here so the very first index it will be equal to 0 because because we want to start from this letter that is p so the start index it is equal to 0 and then we have to provide a colon and then we can simply provide the end index and that is how the slicing works so what will be the end index over here we need to count the number of letters we have the indices over here as 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. so we have 10 letters over here this last letter it belongs to the 10th index but guys we need to give an extra index which is not included over here so when we provide 11 the 11th index will not be included that is the space will not be included but the G letter will be included so only from 0 up to 10 index numbers will be included over here in this string slicing guys this is the way that we find the substring from the given original string let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we have got programming word which is the substring of this original string over here now guys let us say we want this beginners to be displayed so what we can do is again we can count the indices so G was at the 10th index and then we have 11 over here and then these are the indices that is 11 12 13 14 15 and 16. so this B character is starting from the 16th index so instead of 0 over here we have to start from the 16 and then guys in order to go up to the end of the string we need not have to provide any end index over here so after the 16 being mentioned as the start index we provide a colon and then if we don't provide the end index which means all the characters from the 16th index will be considered over here in order to be printed now guys let me just see if this file now enter running this code once again as you can see we have quality beginner's word over here being printed on the terminal now guys let us include some more characters over here in order to check whether those are being included or not when we we are providing just the start index and not the end index so let's say we have a b c d over here and then we have X Y and Z along with the space characters as well so let me just save this file now this time also we should get beginners but then we should also get ABCD and then XYZ that's because we have not provided the end index over here so let me just run this code once again so as you can see we have got beginners a b c d x y z so guys this is the way in
