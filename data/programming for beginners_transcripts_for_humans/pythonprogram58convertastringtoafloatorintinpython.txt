00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:04 - Python program to convert a string to a
00:06 - float or integer so guys this Python
00:09 - program will help you to convert a
00:11 - string to the integer of load values
00:13 - using the end to end float methods which
00:16 - are used as a prefix methods with a
00:18 - parameter that is the string data type
00:20 - so guys we are going to check all these
00:22 - with the help of examples as well so
00:24 - first of all we will see converting a
00:26 - string into the integer data type so let
00:29 - us move to the vs code over here so the
00:31 - very first thing is let's say we have a
00:33 - string variable that is the Str and then
00:36 - the data that we want to provide is 1500
00:39 - so guys let's say this 1500 is the value
00:42 - that is the number but it is of the
00:44 - string data type because we have
00:46 - enclosed it within the double quotes
00:48 - over here so what we will do is first of
00:50 - all we will print the statement that is
00:52 - the Str data type over here so Str data
00:57 - type polar and then comma we can simply
00:59 - have type method in order to get the
01:02 - type of the Str so inside the type
01:05 - method we provide a parameter that is
01:07 - Str in order to get the type of this Str
01:09 - variable so let me just keep this file
01:12 - now and try running this code so as you
01:14 - can see Str data type it says class SDR
01:17 - over here that is a string data type now
01:19 - guys let's say we want to convert it
01:21 - into the integer data type so what we
01:23 - will do is simply let's say we have the
01:26 - Str followed by underscore and then we
01:29 - will say end in this case so that we can
01:31 - identify that Str end variable must be
01:35 - of the integer data type so what we can
01:38 - simply do is we can use the int method
01:40 - over here as a prefix so over here we
01:43 - can have the int method it will take the
01:45 - parameter and this parameter will be
01:47 - this Str variable which means we are
01:50 - passing this string over here so simply
01:52 - I'll copy this and paste this over here
01:54 - so basically this string that is Str
01:56 - variable is being passed as a parameter
01:59 - to this individual variable now guys
02:01 - this string that is 1500 will be stored
02:03 - as the integer into this Str end in this
02:07 - case so let us check the data type of
02:09 - this Str end variable as well so we have
02:12 - print statement followed by Str
02:14 - underscore n and then we can simply have
02:18 - data type over here colon and then this
02:21 - time we will have the type method and
02:23 - inside this we will provide Str in in
02:26 - this case so that we get the type of
02:29 - this Str end variable so let me just
02:31 - save this file now and try running this
02:33 - code once again so as you can see Str in
02:36 - the data type it is of the class in data
02:39 - type in this case which means it is an
02:41 - integer now guys what is the difference
02:43 - over here we have the 1500 as the value
02:46 - which is the string value and then over
02:48 - here in the Str end we are having it as
02:51 - a number in this case so let us check
02:54 - what is the difference what we will do
02:56 - is simply we will have the print
02:57 - statement and then we have SDR and then
03:00 - this time we will do plus 1 over here so
03:03 - we are just having the plus operator
03:06 - over here but this is the Str variable
03:08 - which means it is of the string data
03:10 - type and we are adding one to eight so
03:13 - over here it should do string
03:14 - concatenation which will give us the
03:17 - result as one five zero zero one in this
03:20 - case but what if we add 1 to the integer
03:22 - data types over here let's say we have
03:24 - another print statement and this time we
03:27 - will be using the Str underscore end and
03:30 - then plus and then one over here so guys
03:33 - what this will do is since it is having
03:35 - 1500 as a number value that is the
03:38 - integer value it will add plus 1 which
03:41 - means it will give us the result as 1501
03:43 - this time so let me just save this file
03:46 - now and try running this code once again
03:48 - so we are getting the error can only
03:50 - concatenate Str not end to Str so over
03:54 - here what we can do is simply enclose
03:56 - this one inside the double quotes over
03:58 - here let me just say this this file now
04:00 - and try running this code once again so
04:02 - as you can see we are getting fifteen
04:04 - thousand and one over here which is of
04:06 - the string data type in this case but we
04:08 - are getting 1501 for the second case
04:11 - where we have added 1 to the integer
04:14 - data type over here so guys this is the
04:16 - difference between the integer and the
04:18 - string whenever we are using the plus
04:20 - operator in case of string it is doing
04:22 - the concatenation whereas in case of the
04:25 - integer it is adding the two numbers
04:26 - over here now guys what if we have a
04:28 - decimal number inside this double quotes
04:30 - so over here let's say we have 0.04 in
04:34 - this case so what will be the result so
04:36 - let me save this file now and try
04:37 - running this code once again so as you
04:39 - can see it is saying invalid literal for
04:41 - end with base 10 so guys in this case
04:44 - what we can do is we can convert the
04:46 - string into the float we can also
04:48 - convert the string float numeral to
04:51 - integer over here so guys basically we
04:53 - can first convert the string to the
04:55 - float number and then to the integer as
04:57 - well so first of all we will check the
04:59 - second upper approach in this case what
05:01 - we can do is simply so I'll just remove
05:03 - these lines of code over here and then
05:05 - I'll comment out these lines in this
05:07 - case and then we can have another
05:09 - variable that is Str followed by
05:11 - underscore and then we have load and
05:14 - then similarly how we had used the int
05:17 - function we can use the float function
05:19 - over here as well in order to convert
05:21 - the string to the float so we provide
05:23 - strsc parameter and then we can have the
05:26 - data type of this Str float in this case
05:29 - so over here Str and Then followed by
05:33 - underscore float data type it is and
05:36 - then we say type and then Str float in
05:39 - this case so that we get the data type
05:41 - of this Str float so let me just save
05:44 - this file now and try running this code
05:45 - once again so as you can see Str flow
05:48 - data type it is of the data type float
05:51 - and then guys we can also print the
05:53 - value so we say and value is and Then
05:58 - followed by comma and simply we can have
06:01 - Str float in this case so let me save
06:04 - this file now and try running this code
06:05 - so as you can see we have got the value
06:07 - as
06:09 - 1500.04 this time now guys we can also
06:12 - convert this float number into the
06:14 - integer as well just by using the end
06:17 - function in this case before the string
06:19 - of load so I'll just provide the end
06:22 - function inside this print function
06:24 - itself so over here we have used the end
06:27 - function while printing the Str float in
06:29 - this case so instead of
06:31 - 1500.04 we should simply get 1500 this
06:35 - time because we are converting it into
06:37 - the integer value so let me just save
06:39 - this file now and try running this code
06:41 - once again so as you can see we have got
06:43 - Str flow data type the data type will be
06:46 - float only but then we are converting it
06:48 - into the integer while printing it so
06:51 - that is why we have got the value as
06:53 - 1500 this time so Guys these are certain
06:55 - ways in order to convert the string data
06:58 - type to the integer and the flow data
07:00 - type now guys it becomes very important
07:02 - when we are taking the input from the
07:04 - user so let's say instead of this fixed
07:06 - number over here we provide the input
07:09 - function and then we ask the user to
07:11 - enter the number so basically when the
07:13 - user enters any number over here it will
07:16 - be of the string data type which we can
07:18 - convert by using the end or the float
07:20 - function over here just like how we have
07:22 - seen in the examples so guys let us save
07:25 - this file now and try running this code
07:27 - once you will be able to see what will
07:29 - be the Str data type over here once a
07:31 - user enters any data over here so when
07:34 - the user is being asked to enter the
07:36 - number let's say we provide
07:39 - 1400.45 SC number when we press enter as
07:43 - you can see Str data type is of the
07:45 - string data type over here so whatever
07:47 - data is being provided by the user it is
07:50 - of the string data type now Str float it
07:53 - will be of the flow data type that's
07:55 - because we have converted that string
07:57 - into the float and then the value it
07:59 - will be of the integer data type that's
08:01 - because we have converted that float
08:03 - value to the integer value over here so
08:05 - guys this is a way that the string that
08:07 - was entered by the user can be converted
08:09 - into the float or the integer values as
08:12 - well which becomes very important
08:13 - whenever you are writing the python
08:15 - programs so guys please make sure that
08:17 - you practice on your own so that on
08:19 - different inputs you get different
08:20 - outputs make sure that you like this
08:22 - video so that it reaches to more people
08:24 - and subscribe to this channel so that
08:26 - you get the notifications on upcoming
08:28 - videos as well the next video that we
08:30 - are going to talk about is Python
08:32 - program to get a substring of a string
08:34 - so stay tuned

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to convert a string to a float or integer so guys this Python program will help you to convert a string to the integer of load values using the end to end float methods which are used as a prefix methods with a parameter that is the string data type so guys we are going to check all these with the help of

is the Str and then the data that we want to provide is 1500 so guys let's say this 1500 is the value that is the number but it is of the string data type because we have enclosed it within the double quotes over here so what we will do is first of all we will print the statement that is the Str data type over here so Str data type polar and then comma we can simply have type method in order to get the type of the Str so inside the type method we provide a parameter that is Str in order to get the type of this Str variable so let me just keep this file now and try running this code so as you can see Str data type it says class SDR over here that is a string data type now guys let's say we want to convert it into the integer data type so what we will do is simply let's say we have the Str followed by underscore and then we will say end in this case so that we can identify that Str end variable must be of the integer data type so what we can simply do is we can use the int method over here as a prefix so over here we can have the int method it will take the parameter and this parameter will be this Str variable which means we are passing this string over here so simply I'll copy this and paste this over here so basically this string that is Str variable is being passed as a parameter to this individual variable now guys this string that is 1500 will be stored as the integer into this Str end in this case so let us check the data type of this Str end variable as well so we have print statement followed by Str underscore n and then we can simply have data type over here colon and then this time we will have the type method and inside this we will provide Str in in this case so that we get the type of this Str end variable so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see Str in the data type it is of the class in data type in this case which means it is an integer now guys what is the difference over here we have the 1500 as the value which is the string value and then over here in the Str end we are having it as a number in this case so let us check what is the difference what we will do is simply we will have the print statement and then we have SDR and then this time we will do plus 1 over here so we are just having the plus operator over here but this is the Str variable which means it is of the string data type and we are adding one to eight so over here it should do string concatenation which will give us the result as one five zero zero one in this case but what if we add 1 to the integer data types over here let's say we have another print statement and this time we will be using the Str underscore end and then plus and then one over here so guys what this will do is since it is having 1500 as a number value that is the integer value it will add plus 1 which means it will give us the result as 1501 this time so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so we are getting the error can only concatenate Str not end to Str so over here what we can do is simply enclose this one inside the double quotes over here let me just say this this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see we are getting fifteen thousand and one over here which is of the string data type in this case but we are getting 1501 for the second case where we have added 1 to the integer data type over here so guys this is the difference between the integer and the string whenever we are using the plus operator in case of string it is doing the concatenation whereas in case of the integer it is adding the two numbers over here now guys what if we have a decimal number inside this double quotes so over here let's say we have 0.04 in this case so what will be the result so let me save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see it is saying invalid literal for end with base 10 so guys in this case what we can do is we can convert the

file now and try running this code so as you can see we have got the value as 1500.04 this time now guys we can also convert this float number into the integer as well just by using the end function in this case before the string of load so I'll just provide the end function inside this print function itself so over here we have used the end function while printing the Str float in this case so instead of 1500.04 we should simply get 1500 this time because we are converting it into the integer value so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see we have got Str flow data type the data type will be float only but then we are converting it into the integer while printing it so that is why we have got the value as 1500 this time so Guys these are certain ways in order to convert the string data type to the integer and the flow data type now guys it becomes very important when we are taking the input from the user so let's say instead of this

data type is of the string data type over here so whatever data is being provided by the user it is of the string data type now Str float it will be of the flow data type that's because we have converted that string into the float and then the value it will be of the integer data type that's because we have converted that float value to the integer value over here so guys this is a way that the string that was entered by the user can be converted into the float or the integer values as well which becomes very important whenever you are writing the python programs so guys please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is Python program to get a substring of a string so stay tuned
