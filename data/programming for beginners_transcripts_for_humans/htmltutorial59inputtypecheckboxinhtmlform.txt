With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see input type checkbox
00:02 - in HTML form so guys basically the input
00:05 - tag along with the type attribute that
00:08 - is having the value as checkbox will
00:10 - Define a checkbox on the UI now guys
00:13 - what do you mean by checkbox so
00:15 - basically checkboxes let a user select
00:18 - zero or more options of a limited number
00:20 - of choices so either you don't have to
00:22 - select any of the options or you can
00:25 - select one option or multiple options as
00:27 - well that is present inside the list of
00:29 - choice Es as part of check boxes over
00:32 - here so guys let us check this with the
00:33 - help of examples in vs code over here so
00:36 - previously we had seen the input types
00:38 - that is text and then we had also seen
00:40 - password we had seen the submit and the
00:42 - reset button over here and also we had
00:45 - seen the list of radio buttons out of
00:47 - which only one option can be selected
00:50 - and this is how the page looks like on
00:51 - the UI now guys this is not one of the
00:54 - best designs in HTML that's because we
00:56 - are having the submit and clear button
00:59 - in between which should be present at
01:01 - the end of the form over here at the
01:03 - bottom so guys what we will be doing is
01:05 - we will move these two buttons that is
01:07 - reset and submit buttons at the end of
01:09 - the form over here so I'm simply going
01:12 - to cut those lines of code and paste it
01:14 - over here now let me just save this file
01:16 - now entery reloading this page so as you
01:19 - can see now we are having the submit and
01:21 - the clear buttons at the end now guys
01:23 - what we will do is after this list of
01:25 - radio buttons we will be having the list
01:27 - of check boxes as well so over here I'll
01:30 - simply remove the extra line break tags
01:32 - over here and then guys after the radio
01:34 - buttons what we will be doing is we will
01:36 - be providing the check boxes so over
01:38 - here simply we will provide the input
01:41 - followed by colon and then we have
01:43 - something called as checkbox over here
01:45 - now guys this is the Mt abbreviation
01:47 - which is one of the features of the vs
01:49 - code that we are using if you are using
01:51 - any other editor such as notepad or
01:53 - notepad++ then you have to manually type
01:56 - the entire content inside this tag along
01:59 - with the type type attribute for which
02:00 - the value will be checkbox over here now
02:03 - guys let us set the name as vehicle in
02:05 - this case so we will say vehicle one and
02:08 - then let's say we provide the ID as bike
02:10 - over here now guys similarly we will
02:12 - have two more options and these options
02:14 - will be car and boat over here so we
02:16 - will change the name to vehicle 2 and
02:19 - vehicle three in this case and the ID
02:21 - over here will be car and then the third
02:23 - option it will be boat in this case so
02:26 - we have just set the ID that is bike car
02:29 - and boat Bo for all these three options
02:31 - now guys let me just save this file now
02:33 - and try reloading this page once again
02:35 - on the browser so as you can see we are
02:37 - getting the three check boxes over here
02:39 - if you click on them these are getting
02:41 - selected in this case let me provide
02:43 - some line breaks before and after these
02:45 - checkboxes so over here we will provide
02:47 - the line break and then over here as
02:50 - well we have to provide the line brakes
02:52 - so that we can see the checkboxes
02:54 - properly so let me just reload this page
02:56 - once again so these are the three
02:58 - options that we can see on the UI now
03:00 - guys it doesn't make sense in order to
03:02 - see only those checkboxes so we can
03:04 - associate them with the labels as well
03:07 - so just like how we had done for the
03:09 - radio buttons over here we will be
03:11 - having the labels for the check boxes as
03:13 - well so simply after the checkbox we
03:15 - need to provide the label so this label
03:17 - will be for the ID that is bike so we
03:19 - are going to copy this ID that is bike
03:22 - and provide it as the value for this
03:24 - four attribute to the label so that this
03:27 - particular label tag can be linked to to
03:29 - the first checkbox over here so guys we
03:32 - are going to provide the bike and then
03:34 - after providing the value for this for
03:36 - attribute we can simply provide the
03:38 - label so we can say I have a bike now
03:41 - similarly we will have the labels for
03:43 - the other two checkboxes as well so we
03:45 - will be providing the line break once
03:47 - again over here after the label and we
03:49 - will simply copy the labels for the car
03:52 - and boat as well and then we will change
03:54 - the IDS so for the second checkbox label
03:57 - we will copy the ID over here and then
03:59 - we will say say I have a car and then
04:02 - this ID that is the third option we are
04:04 - going to set it as the for attribute for
04:06 - this last label and then we will say I
04:09 - have a boot in this case so guys let me
04:11 - just save this file now and try
04:13 - reloading this page once again on the
04:15 - browser so now as you can see we have
04:17 - the list of check boxes over here which
04:19 - are being displayed we can either select
04:21 - a zero of them or one or multiple of the
04:24 - options so in this case when we select I
04:26 - have a bike so this option is getting
04:28 - selected and and let's say if you have
04:30 - the car as well so you can select this
04:32 - option also that is I have a car so we
04:35 - can click on the label as well in order
04:37 - to select this option so as you can see
04:39 - I have a car is getting selected you can
04:41 - also select I have a boat as well so
04:44 - this option is getting selected over
04:46 - here if you want to deselect any of the
04:48 - options you can click on that particular
04:50 - option once again so this option is
04:52 - getting deselected in this case so guys
04:55 - this is the main functionality of the
04:56 - checkboxes either you can select 0 1 or
04:59 - multiple of the options that are present
05:02 - as the list of check boxes we can also
05:04 - have the label before the list of check
05:06 - boxes over here so what we can do is
05:08 - simply we can have the paragraph in this
05:10 - case and then we can say select the mode
05:13 - of Transport that you own so guys
05:16 - basically we have a very simple
05:17 - statement over here and then let me just
05:19 - save this file now and try reloading
05:21 - this page once again on the browser so
05:23 - as you can see select the mode of
05:25 - Transport that you own and then we have
05:27 - these three options over here so you can
05:29 - select any of the options based on your
05:31 - choices so guys comment in the comment
