00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to find even numbers in
00:06 - the list using the filter function so
00:08 - guys in this program we are going to
00:10 - include some elements inside this list
00:12 - and which are the even numbers inside
00:15 - this list that we are going to check
00:16 - using the filter function over here so
00:19 - as you can see this is the filter
00:20 - function which takes two parameters the
00:23 - very first parameter is the function in
00:25 - this case we have provided the anonymous
00:27 - function that allows us to check whether
00:29 - the given number is a even number or the
00:32 - odd number and the second parameter is
00:34 - the list itself from where one at a time
00:36 - the element will be passed to this
00:38 - Anonymous function so guys let us check
00:40 - this with the help of the vs code over
00:42 - here so basically the very first thing
00:44 - that we will be having is our list so we
00:46 - will name it as list one and let's say
00:48 - we have the top 10 numbers over here
00:50 - inside this list so we will just set all
00:53 - the numbers from 1 up to 10 over here so
00:56 - as you can see we have initialized the
00:57 - list one now guys we can simply use the
00:59 - filter the function in order to find
01:01 - which are the even numbers from this
01:03 - list so basically over here we will be
01:06 - using the filter function as you can see
01:08 - this filter function will take two
01:10 - parameters the very first parameter will
01:12 - be a function that will help us in order
01:14 - to find whether a number is a even
01:16 - number so let's say we provide this
01:18 - function name that is even over here
01:20 - comma we have to provide the second
01:22 - parameter that is list one so guys over
01:24 - here we will provide list one now guys
01:26 - as you can see we are getting some error
01:28 - over here it says E1 is not defined so
01:30 - we have to Define this even function so
01:32 - what we will do is let's say we provide
01:34 - the def keyword followed by this even
01:37 - function it will take one parameter that
01:39 - is X over here so how this filter
01:41 - function Works behind the scenes
01:43 - basically whatever element is present
01:45 - inside this list one one element at a
01:47 - time from this list one will be passed
01:49 - to this even function over here and that
01:52 - will be captured using this x variable
01:54 - and then guys inside this we can simply
01:56 - provide our condition that is if x
01:59 - percent 2 is it equal to 0 which means
02:03 - that when we divide this particular
02:05 - number that is X by 2 whether the
02:07 - remainder is 0 or not and guys the
02:09 - specialty of an even number is that
02:11 - whenever we divide the even number by 2
02:13 - the remainder is always 0 and in this
02:16 - case if this condition gets satisfied
02:18 - then the number that is X is an even
02:20 - number so what we will do is after this
02:22 - colon we will simply provide return true
02:25 - in this case and then guys when this
02:27 - function that is E1 it returns to true
02:29 - then that particular element that was
02:31 - passed to this even function will be
02:33 - returned by this filter function over
02:35 - here and then we can save it inside
02:37 - another list so guys over here after
02:39 - this what we have to do is we have to
02:41 - provide return false as well if this
02:44 - condition is not satisfied that is X
02:46 - person 2 is equal to equal to 0 if this
02:49 - is not satisfied then we will return
02:51 - false over here okay the first letter of
02:53 - the true it should be capital letter and
02:55 - for the false as well we should have the
02:57 - capital F over here so guys this is the
02:59 - functionality of the field data function
03:00 - that is it helps us in order to filter
03:02 - out certain elements now guys what we
03:04 - have to do is we have to store it inside
03:06 - some another list so over here basically
03:09 - we can store it inside the result over
03:11 - here in this case like whatever elements
03:13 - are coming from this even function for
03:15 - which the return value is true those
03:17 - will be stored in the result function
03:18 - and then guys we can simply provide the
03:20 - print function over here so we say print
03:23 - and then we can say A1 numbers are and
03:28 - then colon and then we can simply
03:30 - provide this result but this needs to be
03:33 - converted into the list data type so
03:34 - over here we will use the list function
03:36 - and then we will provide the result
03:38 - variable so guys over here what we have
03:40 - done is the result that we have got from
03:42 - the filter we have just converted it
03:44 - into the list and in the form of the
03:46 - list we are printing it using the print
03:48 - function over here so let me just save
03:50 - this file now and try running this code
03:53 - so as you can see we are getting even
03:55 - numbers are 2 4 6 8 10 and those are the
03:59 - actual even numbers from this entire
04:01 - list so guys this is the way that we
04:02 - have easily used the filter function in
04:04 - order to find the even numbers inside
04:06 - the list now guys can we reduce these
04:09 - number of lines of code that we have
04:10 - written yes instead of calling this even
04:13 - function what we can do is we can
04:15 - provide the anonymous function over here
04:17 - with the same functionality so how do we
04:19 - Define the anonymous function we'll just
04:21 - remove this function name and then we
04:23 - will provide Lambda and then this
04:25 - Anonymous function will take one
04:26 - parameter that is X similar to how we
04:28 - had given the parameter to this even
04:30 - function and Then followed by colon and
04:33 - then we can simply provide the condition
04:34 - that is X percent 2 the same condition
04:37 - we need to provide is it equal to 0 and
04:41 - if this condition is true then that
04:43 - particular element will be included in
04:45 - the result or else if it is not true
04:47 - then it will not be included in the
04:48 - result and then guys we can simply
04:50 - remove this definition of the even
04:52 - function over here so as we you can see
04:54 - we have just reduced the number of lines
04:55 - of Code by using the anonymous function
04:58 - inside the filter function over here so
05:00 - let me just save this file now and try
05:02 - running this code once again so as you
05:04 - can see we are getting the same output
05:05 - that is even numbers are and then we are
05:07 - getting 2 4 6 8 and then 10. okay
05:10 - similarly we can also remove this list
05:12 - one variable that we have used and
05:14 - provide the range function over here so
05:16 - instead of having this list 1 we can
05:18 - provide range function and let's say the
05:21 - numbers that we want to include are 1 up
05:24 - to 20. so the second parameter inside
05:26 - the range function should be plus 1 so
05:28 - it should be 21 so guys basically the
05:30 - first parameter will be included that is
05:32 - the number one but the second parameter
05:34 - will not be included that is 21 so a
05:36 - number that is less than 21 which is 20
05:38 - will be included so basically we are
05:40 - providing the list of the numbers that
05:42 - is 1 to 20 and from that list the even
05:45 - numbers will be displayed over here so
05:47 - we can simply remove this list one
05:49 - variable as well and then we can simply
05:51 - have these two lines of statement over
05:53 - here in order to find the even numbers
05:55 - inside the list which includes 1 to 20
05:58 - numbers so let me just save this file
06:00 - now and try running this code once again
06:02 - as you can see we are getting the even
06:04 - numbers that are 2 4 6 8 10 and then we
06:07 - also have 12 14 16 18 and then 20. so
06:11 - guys this is the way just by using one
06:13 - simple line of code over here we were
06:15 - successfully able to find out which are
06:17 - the even numbers inside the list now
06:19 - guys what happens if we directly provide
06:21 - this result to the print statement
06:22 - instead of converting it into this list
06:24 - so let us check that as well so over
06:27 - here what I'll do is I'll just remove
06:28 - this list function and I'll simply
06:30 - provide the result variable over here
06:32 - let me just save this file now and try
06:34 - running this code as you can see it says
06:36 - even numbers are and then we are getting
06:38 - this filter object add so basically we
06:40 - are getting the address of this result
06:42 - object over here that was passed by the
06:44 - filter function so it is not working
06:46 - over here we have to necessarily convert
06:49 - this result variable into a list
06:50 - variable in order to successfully render
06:53 - the results so we simply have to provide
06:55 - the list function over here and enclose
06:58 - this result variable so let me just save
07:00 - this file now and try running this code
07:01 - once again so now we are getting the
07:03 - exact even number that are present
07:05 - inside the list guys what do you think
07:07 - about this number that is 21 whether it
07:09 - is an even number or the odd number
07:11 - comment in the comment section below let
07:13 - us see whether your answer is correct or
07:15 - not please make sure that you practice
07:16 - on your own so that on different inputs
07:18 - you get different outputs make sure that
07:20 - you like this video so that it reaches
07:21 - to more people and subscribe to this
07:23 - channel so that you get the
07:24 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
07:26 - the next video that we are going to talk
07:28 - about is Python program to find the
07:30 - numbers divisible by another number so
07:33 - stay tuned

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to find even numbers in the list using the filter function so guys in this program we are going to include some elements inside this list and which are the even numbers inside this list that we are going to check using the filter function over here so as you can see this is the filter function which takes two parameters the very first parameter is the function in this case we have provided the anonymous function that allows us to check whether the given number is a even number or the odd number and the second parameter is the list itself from where one at a time the element will be passed to this Anonymous function so guys let us check this with the help of the vs code over here so basically the very first thing that we will be having is our list so we will name it as list one and let's say we have the top 10 numbers over here inside this list so we will just set all the numbers from 1 up to 10 over here so as you can see we have initialized the list one now guys we can simply use the filter the function in order to find which are the even numbers from this list so basically over here we will be using the filter function as you can see this filter function will take two parameters the very first parameter will be a function that will help us in order to find whether a number is a even number so let's say we provide this function name that is even over here comma we have to provide the second parameter that is list one so guys over here we will provide list one now guys as you can see we are getting some error over here it says E1 is not defined so we have to Define this even function so what we will do is let's say we provide the def keyword followed by this even function it will take one parameter that is X over here so how this filter function Works behind the scenes basically whatever element is present inside this list one one element at a time from this list one will be passed to this even function over here and that will be captured using this x variable and then guys inside this we can simply provide our condition that is if x percent 2 is it equal to 0 which means that when we divide this particular number that is X by 2 whether the remainder is 0 or not and guys the specialty of an even number is that whenever we divide the even number by 2 the remainder is always 0 and in this case if this condition gets satisfied then the number that is X is an even number so what we will do is after this colon we will simply provide return true in this case and then guys when this function that is E1 it returns to true then that particular element that was passed to this even function will be returned by this filter function over here and then we can save it inside another list so guys over here after this what we have to do is we have to provide return false as well if this condition is not satisfied that is X person 2 is equal to equal to 0 if this is not satisfied then we will return false over here okay the first letter of the true it should be capital letter and for the false as well we should have the capital F over here so guys this is the functionality of the field data function that is it helps us in order to filter out certain elements now guys what we have to do is we have to store it inside some another list so over here basically we can store it inside the result over here in this case like whatever elements are coming from this even function for which the return value is true those will be stored in the result function and then guys we can simply provide the print function over here so we say print and then we can say A1 numbers are and then colon and then we can simply provide this result but this needs to be converted into the list data type so over here we will use the list function and then we will provide the result variable so guys over here what we have done is the result that we have got from the filter we have just converted it into the list and in the form of the list we are printing it using the print function over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting even numbers are 2 4 6 8 10 and those are the actual even numbers from this entire list so guys this is the way that we have easily used the filter function in order to find the even numbers inside the list now guys can we reduce these number of lines of code that we have written yes instead of calling this even function what we can do is we can provide the anonymous function over

guys we can simply remove this definition of the even function over here so as we you can see we have just reduced the number of lines of Code by using the anonymous function inside the filter function over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see we are getting the same output that is even numbers are and then we are getting 2 4 6 8 and then 10. okay similarly we can also remove this list one variable that we have used and provide the range function over here so instead of having this list 1 we can provide range function and let's say the numbers that we want to include are 1 up to 20. so the second parameter inside the range function should be plus 1 so it should be 21 so guys basically the first parameter will be included that is the number one but the second parameter will not be included that is 21 so a number that is less than 21 which is 20 will be included so basically we are providing the list of the numbers that is 1 to 20 and from that list the even numbers will be displayed over here so we can simply remove this list one variable as well and then we can simply have these two lines of statement over here in order to find the even numbers inside the list which includes 1 to 20 numbers so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again as you can see we are getting the even numbers that are 2 4 6 8 10 and then we also have 12 14 16 18 and then 20. so guys this is the way just by using one simple line of code over here we were successfully able to find out which are the even numbers inside the list now guys what happens if we directly provide this result to the print statement instead of converting it into this list so let us check that as well so over here what I'll do is I'll just remove this list function and I'll simply provide the result variable over here let me just save this file now and try running this code as you can see it says even numbers are and then we are getting this filter object add so basically we are getting the address of this result object over here that was passed by the filter function so it is not working over here we have to necessarily convert this result variable into a list variable in order to successfully render the results so we simply have to provide the list function over here and enclose this result variable so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so now we are getting the exact even number that are present inside the list guys what do you think about this number that is 21 whether it is an even number or the odd number comment in the comment section below let us see whether your answer is correct or not please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video
