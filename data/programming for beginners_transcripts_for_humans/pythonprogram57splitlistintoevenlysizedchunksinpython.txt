00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:04 - Python program to split our list into
00:06 - evenly sized chunks so guys this Python
00:09 - program will help you to split a given
00:11 - list into multiple lists with mentioned
00:14 - number of elements so guys let us check
00:16 - this with the help of examples we are
00:18 - going to see two approaches the first
00:20 - approach will be using the yield keyword
00:23 - and then the second approach will be
00:24 - using the numpy module so guys let us
00:27 - move to the vs code over here the very
00:29 - first approach is the yield method so
00:31 - what we will do is first of all we will
00:33 - Define the list that is list one it is
00:35 - equal to we will have 10 elements over
00:37 - here one two three four five six seven
00:41 - eight nine and then the last element
00:43 - that is 10 over here now guys we want to
00:46 - display this list in the chunks of 2
00:49 - that is 1 2 should be present in one
00:51 - list and then another list must have
00:53 - three four and then another list must
00:55 - have 5 6 and so on there must be five
00:58 - individual list having all the these
01:00 - elements over here so guys we will
01:02 - Define the chunk size over here so chunk
01:04 - underscore size it is equal to 2 for now
01:07 - and then simply we can have the print
01:09 - statement which will call a method which
01:12 - we are going to Define so guys let us
01:14 - say we have the split method over here
01:16 - being defined so we have the def keyword
01:19 - followed by split in this case it takes
01:22 - two parameter the first parameter will
01:24 - be the list itself which will be passed
01:26 - over here and the second parameter it
01:28 - will be chunk size that will be passed
01:30 - to this function so guys let's say we
01:32 - Define it as chunk size over here then
01:35 - guys what will happen is inside this we
01:37 - are going to use the for Loop and we
01:39 - will go through the elements of the list
01:41 - so over here we say for i n we will say
01:46 - range it will go from 0 up to the length
01:50 - of this list so we use the Len methods
01:53 - followed by list one which is the list
01:56 - that is being passed to the split method
01:58 - over here and then guys third parameter
02:01 - we can have the step parameter over here
02:03 - as you can see and the step parameter
02:05 - must be the chunk size in this case so
02:07 - whatever chunk size that we Define that
02:10 - must be the step in this case now guys
02:12 - what we can simply do is we can use the
02:14 - yield keyword so guys this yield keyword
02:17 - will help us in order to return certain
02:20 - elements from this list now how the
02:22 - elements must be returned in this case
02:24 - we can simply use the list one over here
02:27 - and then we can use the list slicing in
02:30 - this case so guys when we use slicing we
02:32 - have to provide the start and the end
02:34 - indices from where the list elements
02:37 - must be included so starting we will
02:40 - have I as the start index followed by
02:42 - colon and then we can have the I plus
02:45 - chunk size this time so over here we
02:48 - have chunk size in this case so guys
02:50 - what exactly is happening over here is
02:52 - first time the value of I is 0 so it
02:55 - will go from 0 up to I plus chunk size
02:58 - which means I plus 2 which is equal to 2
03:01 - so over here 0 and 1 that is the first
03:04 - two elements will be returned next time
03:06 - when I is equal to 2 since the step
03:09 - value is 2 right now so 2 and then 2
03:12 - plus 2 will be 4 so 2 comma 3 indices
03:15 - which means 3 and 4 will be returned and
03:17 - so on with the chunk size of 2 all the
03:20 - elements will be returned one at a time
03:22 - so guys over here simply inside the
03:24 - print statement we need to call the
03:26 - split method and convert it into the
03:29 - list so over here we say list first of
03:32 - all and inside this we call the split
03:34 - method and this split method takes two
03:36 - parameters that is list one and the
03:39 - chunk size so those things we are going
03:41 - to pass so we say list one over here
03:43 - comma chunk size in this case so guys
03:47 - this is the method that will help us in
03:49 - order to split the elements of the list
03:51 - into the chunk size that is being
03:53 - mentioned over here so guys let me just
03:55 - save this file now and try running this
03:56 - code so as you can see we have got the
03:59 - five list in inside the entire list over
04:01 - here it says one two in one list and we
04:04 - have three four five six seven eight and
04:07 - then nine ten so guys that's because we
04:09 - have provided the chunk size of two what
04:11 - happens when we provide the chunk size
04:13 - of 4 in this case so over here let's say
04:15 - when we provide the chunk size of four
04:17 - so let me just save this file now and
04:19 - try running this code so as you can see
04:21 - we have got one two three four as one
04:23 - list and then we have five six seven
04:25 - eight as another list and only two
04:27 - elements that is nine and ten in the
04:29 - last list over here that's because there
04:31 - are no more elements in this case in the
04:33 - original list let us say when we say
04:35 - chunk size of 5 so there must be two
04:38 - lists that we must get over here one two
04:40 - five will be first list and then six to
04:42 - ten will be another list so let me just
04:44 - run this code once again so as you can
04:46 - see we have got two list over here one
04:49 - two three four five and then we have got
04:51 - six seven eight nine ten as well now
04:53 - guys let us see another easy approach
04:55 - that is using numpy we can easily split
04:58 - the given list over here so what we we
05:00 - will do is simply I'll just remove these
05:02 - lines of code over here now before using
05:04 - the numpy module we need to check
05:05 - whether it is already present in your
05:07 - installation folder so basically we can
05:10 - simply use the PIP keyword followed by
05:13 - list over here on the terminals and we
05:15 - press enter as you can see we will get
05:17 - the list of all the modules that are
05:19 - being currently installed so I have
05:21 - already installed numpy over here on my
05:24 - machine that is why I am getting this
05:26 - numpy and this is the version you might
05:28 - get some other version based on the date
05:30 - and time when you are practicing this
05:32 - program so guys if you have not found a
05:34 - numpy as a package in this list then you
05:37 - can simply use the PIP keyword followed
05:40 - by install and then simply you can
05:42 - provide numpy and then when you press
05:44 - enter the numpy module will be installed
05:47 - on your computer so currently since I
05:49 - have already installed it on my computer
05:51 - it is asking me to upgrade it to the
05:53 - latest version so guys the important
05:55 - thing is numpy module must be installed
05:57 - on your machine so what we can do is
05:59 - simply we can import the numpy module
06:02 - and use it in order to split the
06:04 - elements of the list so over here we can
06:06 - simply have the import keyword followed
06:09 - by numpy and then we can use the as
06:12 - keyword followed by NP so this NP will
06:15 - be used as a shorthand method in order
06:17 - to refer to this numpy module and then
06:19 - guys what we can do is let's say we have
06:21 - this same list that is list one it is
06:24 - equal to and then we have the elements
06:27 - that is 1 up to 10 so we have all the
06:29 - elements that is starting from 1 up to
06:31 - 10 over here and then guys simply we can
06:33 - have the print statement so inside the
06:36 - print statement what we will do is we
06:38 - will use the NP that is the numpy module
06:40 - followed by Dot and then we have
06:42 - something called as array split over
06:44 - here so when we type array followed by
06:47 - underscore and then we have split so as
06:49 - you can see this is the method that we
06:51 - can use in order to split the list into
06:53 - the chunk size so basically this method
06:56 - will take two parameters the very first
06:58 - parameter will be the list is list one
07:00 - over here so we provide list 1 followed
07:03 - by comma and then as you can see it is
07:05 - asking for the chunk size that is what
07:08 - is the shape that you want the list 1 to
07:10 - be distributed so basically let's say we
07:13 - provide the chunk sizes 2 in this case
07:15 - so guys this is a very simple line of
07:17 - code in order to split the list one into
07:20 - the chunk size that is being mentioned
07:22 - to this array split method that is
07:24 - present inside the numpy module so let
07:27 - me just save this file now and try
07:28 - running this code so as you can see we
07:30 - have got two arrays over here that is
07:31 - first array is one two three four five
07:33 - and then the second array is six seven
07:36 - eight nine ten so guys basically the
07:38 - second parameter is the shape that means
07:40 - how many number of arrays we want to
07:42 - split this original array into so let's
07:45 - say I want this original array to be
07:47 - split into five arrays so when we say 5
07:50 - as the size over here let me just run
07:53 - this code once again so we have got five
07:55 - arrays that is one two three four five
07:58 - six seven eight nine ten what if we
08:00 - provide the number four in this case so
08:03 - let me just save this file now and try
08:04 - running this code so as you can see we
08:06 - have got array one two three then we
08:08 - have four five six and then we have 7 8
08:10 - 9 10. so guys basically the number of
08:13 - elements for automatically adjusted
08:15 - based on the number of arrays or number
08:18 - of lists that we want to split the
08:20 - original list into so guys this is the
08:23 - functionality of the RS plate that you
08:25 - can use using the numpy module as well
08:27 - please make sure that you practice on
08:29 - your own so that on different inputs you
08:31 - get different outputs make sure that you

08:41 - about is Python program to convert a
08:44 - string to a float or integer so stay

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to split our list into evenly sized chunks so guys this Python program will help you to split a given list into multiple lists with mentioned number of elements so guys let us check this with the help of examples we are going to see two approaches the first approach will be using the yield keyword and then the second approach will be using the numpy module so guys let us move to the vs code over here the very first approach is the yield method so what we will do is first of all we will Define the list that is list one it is equal to we will have 10 elements over here one two three four five six seven eight nine and then the last element that is 10 over here now guys we want to display this list in the chunks of 2 that is 1 2 should be present in one list and then another list must have three four and then another list must have 5 6 and so on there must be five individual list having all the these elements over here so guys we will Define the chunk size over here so chunk underscore size it is equal to 2 for now and then simply we can have the print statement which will call a method which we are going to Define so guys let us say we have the split method over here being defined so we have the def keyword followed by split in this case it takes two parameter the first parameter will be the list itself which will be passed over here and the second parameter it will be chunk size that will be passed to this function so guys let's say we Define it as chunk size over here then guys what will happen is inside this we are going to use the for Loop and we will go through the elements of the list so over here we say for i n we will say range it will go from 0 up to the length of this list so we use the Len methods followed by list one which is the list that is being passed to the split method over here and then guys third parameter we can have the step parameter over here as you can see and the step parameter must be the chunk size in this case so whatever chunk size that we Define that must be the step in this case now guys what we can simply do is we can use the yield keyword so guys this yield keyword will help us in order to return certain elements from this list now how the elements must be returned in this case we can simply use the list one over here and then we can use the list slicing in this case so guys when we use slicing we have to provide the start and the end indices from where the list elements must be included so starting we will have I as the start index followed by colon and then we can have the I plus chunk size this time so over here we have chunk size in this case so guys what exactly is happening over here is first time the value of I is 0 so it will go from 0 up to I plus chunk size which means I plus 2 which is equal to 2 so over here 0 and 1 that is the first two elements will be returned next time when I is equal to 2 since the step value is 2 right now so 2 and then 2 plus 2 will be 4 so 2 comma 3 indices which means 3 and 4 will be returned and so on with the chunk size of 2 all the elements will be returned one at a time so guys over here simply inside the print statement we need to call the split method and convert it into the list so over here we say list first of all and inside this we call the split method and this split method takes two parameters that is list one and the chunk size so those things we are going to pass so we say list one over here comma chunk size in this case so guys this is the method that will help us in order to split the elements of the list into the chunk size that is being mentioned over here so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we have got the five list in inside the entire list over here it says one two in one list and we have three four five six seven eight and then nine ten so guys that's because we have provided the chunk size of two what happens when we provide the chunk size of 4 in this case so over here let's say when we provide the chunk size of four so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we have got one two three four as one list and then we have five six seven eight as another list and only two elements that is nine and ten in the last list over here that's because there are no more elements in this case in the original list let us say when we say chunk size of 5 so there must be two lists that we must get over here one two five will be first list and then six to ten will be another list so let me just run this code once again so as you can see we have got two list over here one two three four five and then we have got six seven eight nine ten as well now guys let us see another easy approach that is using numpy we can easily split the given list over here so what we we will do is simply I'll just remove these lines of code over here now before using the numpy module we need to check whether it is already present in your installation folder so basically we can simply use the PIP keyword followed by list over here on the terminals and we press enter as you can see we will get the list of all the modules that are being currently installed so I have already installed numpy over here on my machine that is why I am getting this numpy

provide the number four in this case so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we have got array one two three then we have four five six and then we have 7 8 9 10. so guys basically the number of elements for automatically adjusted based on the number of arrays or number of lists that we want to split the original list into so guys this is the functionality of the RS plate that you can use using the numpy module as well please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is Python program to convert a string to a float or integer so stay tuned
