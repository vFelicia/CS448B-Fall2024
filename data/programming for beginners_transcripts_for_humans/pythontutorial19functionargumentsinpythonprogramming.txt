00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to learn
00:03 - about function arguments in Python
00:06 - Programming so guys in computer
00:07 - programming a function argument is a
00:10 - value that is accepted by a function
00:12 - which we have already seen in the
00:13 - previous video as well now the function
00:15 - argument with the default values so in
00:18 - Python we can provide default values to
00:20 - function arguments so we use the equal
00:22 - operator to provide default values and
00:25 - this is the syntax that is Def keyword
00:27 - we use followed by add numbers that is
00:29 - the function name and then we assign
00:31 - some default values to the variables so
00:33 - guys let us check this with the help of
00:35 - examples so over here previously we had
00:37 - seen that is some numbers function that
00:40 - we had used in order to add two numbers
00:42 - it was having two parameters so over
00:45 - here A and B were the parameters and we
00:47 - were simply printing the sum of these
00:49 - two numbers that is a plus b inside the
00:52 - print function and then we were simply
00:54 - calling this function over here so some
00:56 - numbers so let's say we have two numbers
00:58 - as 10 and 20 so so I'll just save this
01:01 - file and try running this code now so
01:02 - guys this is a very simple method that
01:04 - is some numbers which takes two
01:06 - arguments A and B it is just adding
01:08 - those two numbers and printing them and
01:10 - the function is being called over here
01:12 - the result is being displayed that is 30
01:14 - based on the value that we pass now guys
01:16 - there is another important thing this
01:18 - function argument can also have the
01:20 - default values so let's say if we don't
01:22 - provide these values that is a and b
01:25 - over here so what happens in this case
01:27 - so let me just save this file and try
01:29 - running this code now as you can see it
01:31 - says some numbers missing two required
01:34 - positional arguments that is a and b so
01:36 - guys there is an error that's because
01:38 - the program is expecting us to provide
01:41 - these two values that is a and b which
01:43 - we have not provided while calling the
01:45 - function so let's say in your
01:46 - requirement you want to call the
01:48 - function but sometimes there will not be
01:51 - any value while calling that function so
01:53 - what you can do is you can provide some
01:55 - default values to this A and B so how do
01:58 - you do that you can simply provide the
02:00 - default values over here when you are
02:02 - defining this function so over here we
02:04 - have a it is equal to 10 and let's say B
02:07 - is equal to 20. so these are nothing but
02:10 - some default values that we have
02:12 - provided so let's say next time whenever
02:14 - there is a sum numbers function that is
02:16 - being called without any value of a and
02:18 - b so these values will be used that is a
02:21 - is equal to 10 and B is equal to 20 and
02:24 - a plus b sum will be returned so let me
02:26 - just save this file now and try running
02:28 - this code so as you can see 30 is being
02:30 - returned over here now let's say you
02:32 - provide one argument that is a value you
02:34 - have but B value you don't have so what
02:37 - you will do is simply you will provide a
02:39 - it is equal to 50 so let's say you want
02:42 - is value as 50 but you don't have B
02:44 - value so B value will be automatically
02:46 - taken from here that is B is equal to
02:48 - 20. we save this file and try running
02:51 - this code now so as you can see 70 is
02:53 - getting printed that's because a is
02:55 - value you have provided which is 50
02:56 - which replaces this default value that
02:59 - is 10 so this time a is 50 and B was
03:02 - already 20 and it is not being provided
03:04 - over here so B's value will be
03:06 - considered as 20 and the sum will be
03:08 - displayed over here so guys this is the
03:10 - way that the default values in the
03:11 - arguments work now guys that is another
03:13 - thing that is python keyword argument in
03:16 - keyword arguments the arguments are
03:18 - assigned based on the name of the
03:19 - arguments so for example first name and
03:22 - then last name so guys we will continue
03:24 - with the same example over here let's
03:26 - say we have the arguments As A and B we
03:29 - will just remove these default values
03:31 - over here now what we will do is while
03:33 - printing the sum we will also print the
03:35 - value of a and b so over here we will
03:37 - have the statement that is sum of and
03:40 - then we have a is equal to then we will
03:43 - provide a value and then we have comma
03:45 - once again and then let's say we have
03:47 - double quotes and we have Ampersand
03:49 - character over here and B is equal to
03:52 - then we should have the B value as well
03:55 - and then we have the equal to operator
03:57 - over here and then we have a plus so
04:00 - guys what exactly we are doing is sum of
04:03 - a equal to we are printing the value of
04:05 - a and b is equal to we are printing the
04:09 - value of B and then equal to a plus b so
04:12 - this is nothing but we are formatting
04:14 - the string so it will have the statement
04:16 - over here that is sum of a is equal to
04:18 - 10 and B is equal to 20 equal to 10 plus
04:21 - 20 which is equal to 30 so we have just
04:24 - formatted the string over here so that
04:26 - we can get the value of a and b that is
04:28 - being passed so what we can do is simply
04:30 - let's say I provide 10 and 30 over here
04:32 - which will be assigned to A and B over
04:35 - here in this case so let me just save
04:37 - this file and try running this code now
04:38 - as you can see sum of a is equal to 10
04:42 - so this first parameter that is 10 was
04:45 - being assigned to this variable that is
04:47 - a and then next time we have and B is
04:49 - equal to 30 so this value that is 30 was
04:52 - assigned to this variable that is B over
04:54 - here and that is why B is equal to 30
04:56 - and then we have equal to 40 which is
04:59 - the sum of both these numbers now guys
05:01 - let's say we want to Interchange these
05:03 - values we want to display the a value as
05:05 - 30 and B value as 10 over here so what
05:08 - we can do is simply we can keep this 10
05:11 - and 30 in the same sequence but we can
05:13 - assign it by using the variable name so
05:15 - over here B is equal to 30 so what we
05:18 - are doing exactly is this variable name
05:20 - that is B we are using that variable
05:22 - name while calling that function and we
05:24 - are assigning that value so B value will
05:26 - be 10 in this case and then we say a is
05:29 - equal to 30 so basically what we have
05:31 - done is we have interchanged the values
05:33 - we have kept the sequence of values over
05:35 - here but the variable will be having
05:37 - different values first B will be
05:39 - assigned the value that is 10 over here
05:41 - and then a will be assigned the value as
05:43 - 30 in this case so let me save this file
05:45 - and try running this code now so as you
05:48 - can see sum of a is equal to 30 so a was
05:51 - assigned the value as 30 and P is equal
05:53 - to 10 so B was assigned the value as 10
05:55 - and the sum will be 40 in this case so
05:58 - if you don't want to follow the sequence
06:00 - in which it is present inside the
06:02 - function definition the arguments values
06:04 - you can provide their names over here
06:06 - and provide the values to the variable
06:09 - names so guys this is another way in
06:11 - order to pass the arguments now there is
06:13 - another thing that is python function
06:14 - with arbitrary arguments so sometimes we
06:17 - do not know in advance a number of
06:19 - arguments that will be passed into a
06:21 - function to handle this kind of
06:23 - situation we can use the arbitrary
06:25 - arguments and then this is the syntax
06:27 - that is we use the star character over
06:29 - here so let's say in this case we just
06:31 - have two parameters over here but let's
06:33 - say if we have more than two parameters
06:35 - and we don't know what is the number of
06:37 - parameters that will be present so what
06:39 - we can simply do is we can simply have
06:41 - the star character over here and then we
06:44 - can have the variable names over here
06:46 - numbers is the arguments that we are
06:48 - providing and then what we will do is
06:50 - let's say we want to provide the sum of
06:51 - all the numbers so sum it is equal to 0
06:54 - in this case and then we will go with
06:57 - the help of for Loop so for X in numbers
07:01 - so basically this is kind of a list over
07:03 - here that we are providing and we are
07:05 - going to iterate all the numbers inside
07:07 - the list and then we have colon and then
07:10 - we can have sum it is equal to sum plus
07:13 - X and then after this we can have the
07:16 - print statement so we can simply put sum
07:20 - of all numbers colon and then we can
07:24 - simply have the sum variable name now
07:26 - guys in the same way we can call this
07:28 - function that is some numbers and we can
07:30 - have any number of arguments now this
07:32 - time so basically this star numbers will
07:35 - help us in order to have any number of
07:36 - arguments so let's say we simply provide
07:38 - the number one and let me save this file
07:40 - and try running this code now you can
07:42 - see sum of all numbers it is equal to 1
07:44 - because 1 was the only number that we
07:47 - have provided it I'll simply copy and
07:49 - paste this line of code and let's say I
07:51 - provide top 5 numbers so one two three
07:53 - four five so this time we are having
07:55 - five arguments now so first time it was
07:58 - just one argument this time it is five
08:00 - arguments so basically the number of
08:02 - arguments is dynamic we don't know how
08:04 - many number of arguments will be coming
08:05 - over here in this function in this case
08:08 - we can use this star character along
08:10 - with the argument name so let me save
08:12 - this file and try running this code now
08:14 - as you can see the first line it is
08:16 - saying sum of all numbers it is one the
08:18 - next line is sum of all numbers it is
08:20 - 15. so 1 plus 2 is 3 plus 3 6 plus 4 is
08:24 - 10 and then plus 5 it is 15 over here
08:27 - let's say we have another line of code
08:29 - we call the sum numbers once again we
08:32 - provide 10 plus 20 plus 100 this time so
08:35 - only three numbers let me save this file
08:37 - and try running this code now this time
08:39 - the sum of all numbers it is equal to
08:41 - 130 so basically 10 plus 20 is 30 plus
08:44 - 100 it is equal to 130 so guys this is
08:47 - an another way you can provide only one
08:49 - argument along with the star if you are
08:52 - not sure how many number of arguments
08:54 - can be passed while calling this
08:56 - function so Guys these are certain
08:57 - important factors as far as python
09:00 - function arguments are concerned so
09:01 - please make sure that you practice on
09:03 - your own so that on different inputs you
09:05 - get different output please make sure
09:07 - that you like this video so that it
09:08 - reaches to more people and subscribe to
09:10 - this channel so that you get the
09:11 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
09:13 - the next video that we are going to talk
09:15 - about is recursion function in Python
09:18 - Programming so stay tuned

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about function arguments in Python Programming so guys in computer programming a function argument is a value that is accepted by a function which we have already seen in the previous video as well now the function argument with the default values so in Python we can provide default values to function arguments so we use the equal operator to provide default values and this is the syntax that is Def keyword we use followed by add numbers that is the function name and then we assign some default values to the variables so guys let us check this with the help of examples so over here previously we had seen that is some numbers function that we had used in order to add two numbers it was having two parameters so over here A and B were the parameters and we were simply printing the sum of these two numbers that is a plus b inside the print function and then we were simply calling this function over here so some numbers so let's say we have two numbers as 10 and 20 so so I'll just save this file and try running this code now so guys this is a very simple method that is some numbers which takes two arguments A and B it is just adding those two numbers and printing them and the function is being called over here the result is being displayed that is 30 based on the value that we pass now guys there is another important thing this function argument can also have the default values so let's say if we don't provide these values that is a and b over here so what happens in this case so let me just save this file and try running this code now as you can see it says some numbers missing two required positional arguments that is a and b so guys there is an error that's because the program is expecting us to provide these two values that is a and b which we have not provided while calling the function so let's say in your requirement you want to call the function but sometimes there will not be any value while calling that function so what you can do is you can provide some default values to this A and B so how do you do that you can simply provide the default values over here when you are defining this function so over here we have a it is equal to 10 and let's say B is equal to 20. so these are nothing but some default values that we have provided so let's say next time whenever there is a sum numbers function that is being called without any value of a and b so these values will be used that is a is equal to 10 and B is equal to 20 and a plus b sum will be returned so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see 30 is being returned over here now let's say you provide one argument that is a value you have but B value you don't have so what you will do is simply you will provide a it is equal to 50 so let's say you want is value as 50 but you don't have B value so B value will be automatically taken from here that is B is equal to 20. we save this file and try running this code now so as you can see 70 is getting printed that's because a is value you have provided which is 50 which replaces this default value that is 10 so this time a is 50 and B was already 20 and it is not being provided over here so B's value will be considered as 20 and the sum will be displayed over here so guys this is the way that the default values in the arguments work now guys that is another thing that is python keyword argument in keyword arguments the arguments are assigned based on the name of the arguments so for example first name and then last name so guys we will continue with the same example over here let's say we have the arguments As A and B we will just remove these default values over here now what we will do is while printing the sum we will also print the value of a and b so over here we will have the statement that is sum of and then we have a is equal to then we will provide a value and then we have

over here and then we have a plus so guys what exactly we are doing is sum of a equal to we are printing the value of a and b is equal to we are printing the value of B and then equal to a plus b so this is nothing but we are formatting the string so it will have the statement over here that is sum of a is equal to 10 and B is equal to 20 equal to 10 plus 20 which is equal to 30 so we have just formatted the string over here so that we can get the value of a and b that is being passed so what we can do is simply let's say I provide 10 and 30 over here which will be assigned to A and B over here in this case so let me just save this file and try running this code now as you can see sum of a is equal to 10 so this first parameter that is 10 was being assigned to this variable that is a and then next time we have and B is equal to 30 so this value that is 30 was assigned to this variable that is B over here and that is why B is equal to 30 and then we have equal to 40 which is the sum of both these numbers now guys let's say we want to Interchange these values we want to display the a value as 30 and B value as 10 over here so what we can do is simply we can keep this 10 and 30 in the same sequence but we can assign it by using the variable name so over here B is equal to 30 so what we are doing exactly is this variable name that is B we are using that variable name while calling that function and we are assigning that value so B value will be 10 in this case and then we say a is equal to 30 so basically what we have done is we have interchanged the values we have kept

now as you can see the first line it is saying sum of all numbers it is one the next line is sum of all numbers it is 15. so 1 plus 2 is 3 plus 3 6 plus 4 is 10 and then plus 5 it is 15 over here let's say we have another line of code we call the sum numbers once again we provide 10 plus 20 plus 100 this time so only three numbers let me save this file and try running this code now this time the sum of all numbers it is equal to 130 so basically 10 plus 20 is 30 plus 100 it is equal to 130 so guys this is an another way you can provide only one argument along with the star if you are not sure how many number of arguments can be passed while calling this function so Guys these are certain important factors as far as python function arguments are concerned so please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different output please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the
