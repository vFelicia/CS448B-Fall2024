00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to find hcf or gcd using
00:07 - Loop now guys the highest common factor
00:10 - or hcf we also call it as the greatest
00:12 - common divisor or gcd of two numbers is
00:16 - the largest positive integer that
00:18 - perfectly divides the two given numbers
00:20 - so guys basically we are going to have
00:22 - the two numbers and we are going to see
00:24 - which is that largest positive number
00:26 - which exactly divides this two given
00:29 - numbers so for example the hcf of 12 and
00:32 - 14 is 2 since this 2 is the highest
00:35 - number that exactly divides 12 and 14
00:38 - that is both the numbers respectively
00:40 - and guys similarly we have other numbers
00:42 - that is 48 and 54 which will be divided
00:45 - by 6 for which the hcf will be 6 which
00:48 - divides both the numbers respectively so
00:50 - guys let us find the hcf or gcd by using
00:53 - the Python program using the vs code
00:55 - over here so guys the very first thing
00:57 - that we have to do is we have to provide
00:59 - the number one so let's say we provide
01:01 - these two numbers that is 12 and 14 over
01:03 - here so we provide the value of 12 to
01:05 - number 1 and number 2 it will be 14 in
01:09 - this case guys you can also use the
01:10 - input function in order to take the
01:12 - input from the user as well now guys
01:14 - what we will do is we will have another
01:16 - function in order to compute the hcf so
01:19 - before these variables we will Define
01:21 - the function that is compute hcf and
01:25 - then inside this compute hcf we will
01:27 - provide both these variables in the form
01:29 - of X and Y which are these two numbers
01:31 - that is number one and number two now
01:33 - guys what we will be doing is we will
01:35 - find the smallest number in this case so
01:38 - let's say initially the smaller number
01:40 - we Define it as the number that is 0
01:42 - over here and then if this x number if
01:45 - it is less than y then the smaller
01:48 - number will be X in this case so after
01:50 - this colon we provide smaller it is
01:53 - equal to X or else what we will do is we
01:56 - will provide else part over here the
01:58 - smaller number is y and case so guys
02:01 - basically what we have done is we have
02:02 - to find the smallest number out of these
02:05 - two numbers that is X and Y and if x is
02:07 - less than y then the smaller number is X
02:09 - or else the smaller number will be y now
02:12 - guys the next step is to use the for
02:14 - Loop over here so we use the for low and
02:17 - then we provide the variable that is I
02:19 - and then we have the keyword that is n
02:22 - and then we have the range function
02:24 - which will go from 1 up to the smaller
02:27 - number so we have smaller plus one guys
02:29 - always remember that whenever we are
02:31 - using the range function the second
02:33 - parameter that we provide will not be
02:35 - included in this range function so we
02:37 - have to do plus 1 over here so that the
02:39 - smaller number is also included inside
02:41 - this range so basically the for Loop
02:43 - will go from 1 up to the smaller number
02:46 - between these two numbers that is X and
02:48 - Y and then guys the next thing that we
02:50 - have to do is we have to divide both
02:51 - these numbers that is X and Y by this
02:54 - number that is I and check whether the
02:56 - remainder is 0 which means both the
02:58 - numbers are exactly divisible by this
02:59 - num number that is I and we have to
03:01 - follow these steps up to the number that
03:03 - is smaller so that the largest number is
03:05 - found and we store it inside another
03:07 - variable that is hcf so over here we
03:09 - will have another variable so let's say
03:11 - hcf it is equal to 0 initially so what
03:14 - we will do is inside this for Loop we
03:17 - will say if and then we say x percent I
03:21 - is it equal to 0 and then again we have
03:25 - another condition so we provide the and
03:27 - keyword over here and then we have y
03:30 - percent I is it again equal to 0 so in
03:34 - this case if both the numbers that is X
03:36 - and Y are exactly divisible by I that
03:39 - means this I is one of the numbers that
03:42 - exactly divides both the number so
03:43 - basically we provide hcf it is equal to
03:46 - I in this case so ultimately when the
03:49 - control flow finishes this range that is
03:51 - going from 1 up to the smaller number we
03:54 - will have the highest common factor that
03:56 - is hcf inside this variable so guys what
03:58 - we have to do is after this for Loop we
04:00 - simply have to return this hcf so we
04:03 - return hcf over here now guys what we
04:06 - have to do is we have to call this
04:07 - function that is compute hcf that we
04:10 - have defined so what we will do is we
04:12 - will simply have the print statement and
04:14 - then we will say the hcf of two numbers
04:19 - that is first number and the second
04:22 - number is and then we will print this
04:26 - hcf number I'll just remove this F
04:28 - character over here so that we don't get
04:30 - any errors on these curly braces and
04:32 - then after this we provide dot format
04:34 - and then we can simply provide the
04:37 - number one as the first parameter that
04:40 - will be printed over here instead of the
04:42 - curly braces and then we have number two
04:45 - and then what we can do is we can call
04:48 - this compute hcf in order to find the
04:51 - hcf that will be replacing this third
04:53 - curly braces so we have compute hcf and
04:58 - we provide number one and number two as
05:01 - the parameters over here which will go
05:03 - inside the X and Y variables of this
05:06 - compute hcf function over here so guys
05:08 - this is the way that we can use the loop
05:10 - that is this for Loop in order to find
05:13 - which is that number that is I which
05:15 - exactly divides both the numbers that is
05:17 - X and Y and the highest number will be
05:19 - stored in this hcf variable which will
05:21 - be our highest common factor or the
05:24 - greatest common divider which is the gcd
05:26 - now guys let me just save this file now
05:28 - and try running this code so as you can
05:30 - see the highest common factor that is
05:32 - hcf of two numbers 12 and 14 is 2 over
05:36 - here and that is what we were expecting
05:38 - that is 12 and 14 it is 2. now guys let
05:41 - us provide some other numbers let's say
05:42 - we provide the first number is 12 with
05:44 - cents and the second number is 24. so if
05:47 - you notice this 24 is also divisible by
05:50 - this number that is 12 and this number
05:52 - one that is 12 is also divisible by this
05:55 - number 12 itself so the highest common
05:57 - factor should be this number that is 12
05:59 - the quotient in this case will be 1 12
06:02 - divided by 12 will be 1 and 24 divided
06:05 - by 12 will be 2 and in both the cases
06:07 - the remainders will be 0 so guys let me
06:10 - just save this file now let us verify
06:11 - whether the hcf or these two numbers is
06:14 - 12 or not so I'll just try running this
06:16 - code once again as you can see the hcf
06:18 - of two numbers 12 and 24 is 12 so we are
06:22 - getting the right answer now guys let us
06:24 - see the first number is 54 and the
06:27 - second number is 48. now let me just say
06:29 - this file now and try running this code
06:31 - again
06:32 - so as you can see the hcf of two numbers
06:34 - 54 and 48 is 6. so guys this means that
06:38 - 6 is the highest number that divides
06:41 - both these numbers exactly that is 54
06:43 - and 48 for which the remainder we get is
06:46 - zero there is no other number after 6
06:48 - that is from 7 up to 48 for which that
06:51 - number divides both these numbers
06:53 - perfectly so guys this is the way that
06:55 - we can easily find the hcf of the two
06:57 - numbers by using the for Loop over here
06:59 - guys what if the numbers are 25 and 30
07:02 - in this case so let's say number one is
07:04 - 25 and second number is 30. so what will
07:07 - be the hcf in this case when two numbers
07:10 - are 25 and 30. so comment in the comment
07:12 - section below let us see whether your
07:14 - answer regarding this hcf is correct or
07:17 - not please make sure that you practice
07:18 - on your own so that you can find out the
07:20 - hcf of these two numbers make sure that
07:23 - you like this video so that it reaches

07:31 - about is python program to find hcf or
07:34 - gcd using the euclidean algorithm so
07:37 - stay tuned

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to find hcf or gcd using Loop now guys the highest common factor or hcf we also call it as the greatest common divisor or gcd of two numbers is the largest positive integer that perfectly divides the two given numbers so guys basically we are going to have the two numbers and we are going to see which is that largest positive number which exactly divides this two given numbers so for example the hcf of 12 and 14 is 2 since this 2 is the highest number that exactly divides 12 and 14 that is both the numbers respectively and guys similarly we have other numbers that is 48 and 54 which will be divided by 6 for which the hcf will be 6 which divides both the numbers respectively so guys let us find the hcf or gcd by using the Python program using the vs code over here so guys the very first thing that we have to do is we have to provide the number one so let's say we provide these two numbers that is 12 and 14 over here so we provide the value of 12 to number 1 and number 2 it will be 14 in this case guys you can also use the input function in order to take the input from the user as well now guys what we will do is we will have another function in order to compute the hcf so before these variables we will Define the function that is compute hcf and then inside this compute hcf we will provide both these variables in the form of X and Y which are these two numbers that is number one and number two now guys what we will be doing is we will find the smallest number in this case so let's say initially the smaller number we Define it as the number that is 0 over here and then if this x number if it is less than y then the smaller number will be X in this case so after this colon we provide smaller it is equal to X or else what we will do is we will provide else part over here the smaller number is y and case so guys basically what we have done is we have to find the smallest number out of these two numbers that is X and Y and if x is less than y then the smaller number is X or else the smaller number will be y now guys the next step is to use the for Loop over here so we use the for low and then we provide the variable that is I and then we have the keyword that is n and then we have the range function which will go from 1 up to the smaller number so we have smaller plus one guys always remember that whenever we are using the range function the second parameter that we provide will not be included in this range function so we have to do plus 1 over here so that the smaller number is also included inside this range so basically the for Loop will go from 1 up to the smaller number between these two numbers that is X and Y and then guys the next thing that we have to do is we have to divide both these numbers that is X and Y by this number that is I and check whether the remainder is 0 which means both the numbers are exactly divisible by this num number that is I and we have to follow these steps up to the number that is smaller so that the largest number is found and we store it inside another variable that is hcf so over here we will have another variable so let's say hcf it is equal to 0 initially so what we will do is inside this for Loop we will say if and then we say x percent I is it equal to 0 and then again we have another condition so we provide the and keyword over here and then we have y percent I is it again equal to 0 so in this case if both the numbers that is X and Y are exactly divisible by I that means this I is one of the numbers that exactly divides both the number so basically we provide hcf it is equal to I in this case so ultimately when the control flow finishes this range that is going from 1 up to the smaller number we will have the highest common factor that is hcf inside this variable so guys what we have to do is after this for Loop we simply have to return this hcf so we return hcf over here now guys what we have to do is we have to call this function that is compute hcf that we have defined so what we will do is we will simply have the print statement and then we will say the hcf of two numbers that is first number and the second number is and then we will print this hcf number I'll just remove this F character over here so that we don't get any errors on these curly braces and then after this we provide dot format and then we can simply provide the number one as the first parameter that will be printed over here instead of the curly braces and then we have number two and then what we can do is we can call this compute hcf in order to find the hcf that will be replacing this third curly braces so we have compute hcf and we provide number one and number two as the parameters over here which will go inside the X and Y variables of this compute hcf function over here so guys this is the way that we can use the loop that is this for Loop in order to find which is that number that is I which exactly divides both the numbers that is X and Y and the highest number will be stored in this hcf variable which will be our highest common factor or the greatest common divider which is the gcd now guys let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see the highest common factor that is hcf of two numbers 12 and 14 is 2 over here and that is what we were expecting that is 12 and 14 it is 2. now guys let us provide some other numbers let's say we provide the first number is 12 with cents and the second number is 24. so if you notice this 24 is also divisible by this number that is 12 and this number one that is 12 is also divisible by this number 12 itself so the highest common factor should be this number that is 12 the quotient in this case will be 1 12 divided by 12 will be 1 and 24 divided by 12 will be 2 and in both the cases the remainders will be 0 so guys let me just save this file now let us verify whether the hcf or these two numbers is 12 or not so I'll just try running this code once again as you can see the hcf of two numbers 12 and 24 is 12 so we are getting the right answer now guys let us see the first number is 54 and the second number is 48. now let me just say this file now and try running this code again so as you can see the hcf of two numbers 54 and 48 is 6. so guys this means that 6 is the highest number that divides both these numbers exactly that is 54 and 48 for which the remainder we get is zero there is no other number after 6 that is from 7 up to 48 for which that number divides both these numbers perfectly so guys this is the way that we can easily find the hcf of the two numbers by using the for Loop over here guys what if the numbers are 25 and 30 in this case so let's say number one is 25 and second number is 30. so what will be the hcf in this case when two numbers are 25 and 30. so comment in the comment section below let us see whether your answer regarding this hcf is correct or not please make sure that you practice on your own so that you can find out the hcf of these two numbers make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that
