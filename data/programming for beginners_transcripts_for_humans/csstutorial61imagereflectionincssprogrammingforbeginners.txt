With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see image reflection in
00:02 - CSS so guys basically the Box reflect
00:05 - property is used to create an image
00:07 - reflection and this we are going to
00:09 - check with the help of examples as well
00:11 - the value of the Box reflect property
00:14 - can be below above left or right so guys
00:17 - let us move to the vs code over here and
00:19 - simply we are going to include an image
00:22 - inside the container so guys we have the
00:24 - div tag over here and the class that we
00:27 - are going to set is the container in
00:29 - this case and then then inside this we
00:30 - are going to have the IMG tag over here
00:33 - so guys basically we are going to create
00:35 - an original image and we are going to
00:37 - create a reflection of that original
00:39 - image so for example we are going to
00:42 - have the sample forest image that is
00:44 - present in the same directory where we
00:46 - have saved this index.html file so we
00:49 - are going to select this particular JPG
00:51 - file over here that is the image file
00:53 - and we are going to set the alt
00:55 - attribute as test image over here let me
00:58 - just save this file now and let us see
00:59 - how how it looks like on the browser so
01:02 - when we reload this page on the browser
01:04 - as you can see this is the image that is
01:06 - getting displayed over here now guys we
01:08 - can set the width and height of this
01:09 - particular image in the CSS file so over
01:12 - here in the vs code we are going to move
01:14 - to the style. CSS file in this case and
01:17 - simply we are going to set the IMG tag
01:19 - and set the width and height CSS
01:21 - property for this particular image so
01:23 - guys let us say we have 400 pixels as
01:26 - width and 300 pixels as height over here
01:28 - so basically we have we are going to set
01:30 - these width and height parameters let me
01:33 - just save this file now and try
01:34 - reloading this page once again on the
01:36 - browser so as you can see this is the
01:38 - image let us reduce the size little bit
01:40 - so that we can see the reflection
01:42 - properly so we are going to set the
01:44 - width as 300 pixels and height as 200
01:46 - pixels over here so as you can see this
01:48 - is the image that is getting displayed
01:50 - which is the original image in this case
01:53 - now guys we want the image reflection to
01:55 - be displayed on the right of this image
01:58 - so what we can do is simply we can use
02:00 - the Box reflect CSS property so let us
02:03 - move to the style. CSS file over here
02:06 - and we are going to set the Box reflect
02:08 - CSS property in this case so guys
02:11 - basically this is the CSS property that
02:13 - we are going to use and we can set any
02:15 - of the four values as you can see we
02:17 - have above below left and right guys it
02:19 - is very important to note that some of
02:21 - the browser versions does not support
02:24 - this box reflect CSS property so you
02:26 - need to test on different versions of
02:28 - the browser if you are implementing this
02:30 - box reflect CSS property on production
02:33 - environment so let us say we want the
02:35 - reflection to be present on the right
02:37 - hand side so we select this right value
02:39 - over here let me just save this file now
02:41 - and try reloading this page once again
02:43 - on the browser you can see that this is
02:45 - the original image and the right hand
02:47 - side of the image is somewhere over here
02:49 - but when we reload this page as you can
02:51 - see this is the reflection that is
02:52 - occurring of the original image now so
02:55 - guys this is the image reflection that
02:57 - we can see for the sample image that we
02:59 - have display played on the browser over
03:01 - here on the left hand side you can see
03:03 - that there is a tree in the image and
03:05 - the same thing can be seen over here on
03:06 - the right hand side in the reflection of
03:09 - the image now guys we can also set the
03:11 - Border radius for this particular image
03:13 - so let us say we set the Border radius
03:15 - to 50% so that the image is displayed in
03:18 - a circular shape so let us provide the
03:20 - Border radius of 50% in this case for
03:24 - this particular IMG tag let me just save
03:26 - this file now and try reloading this
03:28 - page once again on the browser so as you
03:30 - can see we have a circular shape image
03:32 - it is not exactly the circle since the
03:35 - width and height of this particular
03:36 - image is not having the same value and
03:38 - it is looking like an ellipse shape over
03:40 - here but guys the main thing is this is
03:42 - the way that you can display the
03:44 - reflection of any of the images that you
03:46 - want to display on your web browser now
03:48 - guys apart from this we can also display
03:50 - the image on the bottom of this
03:52 - particular original image so let us
03:54 - check that as well what we are going to
03:56 - do is we will decrease the width and
03:58 - height so let's say we have 200 100
04:00 - pixels of width and 150 pixels of height
04:02 - in this case and then what we are going
04:04 - to do is instead of having the Box
04:07 - reflect as right we are going to say
04:09 - below as the value over here let me just
04:12 - save this file now and try reloading
04:14 - this page once again on the browser so
04:16 - as you can see we have this original
04:17 - image on the top and then at the bottom
04:19 - we have the reflection of this image now
04:22 - guys similarly you can also set the
04:24 - reflection to be displayed on the left
04:26 - and above the original image so I'll
04:28 - leave this up to you as has a homework
04:30 - for you so that you can practice on your
04:32 - own in order to check the image
04:33 - reflection on the left you need to get
04:35 - the image at the center or at the right
04:38 - of the screen so how you can do that
04:40 - basically the display property of the
04:42 - image is set as in line by default so
04:45 - you can set it as block element and then
04:47 - simply you can provide the margin equal
04:49 - to Auto property over here and then
04:51 - simply you can set the value of margin
04:53 - CSS property as Auto so guys this will
04:56 - help us in order to display the image at
04:59 - the center of the screen let me just
05:01 - save this file now and try reloading
05:03 - this page once again on the browser so
05:05 - as you can see the image is now getting
05:07 - displayed at the center of the screen
05:09 - and in order to get this image
05:10 - reflection on the left of the original
05:13 - image what we can do is simply instead
05:15 - of below we can set the value as left
05:18 - let me just save this file now and try
05:19 - reloading this page so as you can see
05:21 - this is the image reflection that is
05:23 - appearing on the left so guys similarly
05:25 - you can set the value of above as the
05:27 - image reflect CSS property as the Box
05:30 - reflect CSS property so guys comment in
