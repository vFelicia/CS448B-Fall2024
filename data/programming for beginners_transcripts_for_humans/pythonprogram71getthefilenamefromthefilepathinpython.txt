00:00 - welcome to another video in which we are
00:02 - going to write Python program to get the
00:04 - file name from the file path so guys
00:06 - basically we can easily get the file
00:09 - name and the extension of the file
00:11 - present in the directory in two ways the
00:13 - very first way that we are going to see
00:15 - is by using the OS module and the second
00:17 - way we are going to see is using the
00:19 - path module so let us switch to vs code
00:21 - over here to check the example so the
00:24 - very first thing that we will be doing
00:25 - is importing the OS module so we use the
00:28 - import keyword followed by OS over here
00:30 - so guys after this we use the OS module
00:33 - in order to get the file name so over
00:35 - here we use the OS followed by Dot and
00:38 - then we have something called as path
00:39 - over here as you can see vs code is
00:41 - adjusting as this path and Then followed
00:43 - by Dot and then we have something called
00:45 - as base name over here it Returns the
00:48 - final component of the path name which
00:50 - will give us the file name along with
00:51 - the extension so over here we will use
00:54 - the base name but it is going to take
00:55 - one parameter which will be the entire
00:58 - path along with the file name where the
00:59 - file is present so guys over here for
01:02 - test purpose we will use this test
01:03 - document over here so guys I'm going to
01:06 - copy this directory path so I'll just
01:07 - copy and paste this over here inside the
01:10 - double quotes we need to give this
01:11 - parameter and then since it is a
01:13 - backslash we need to escape it with
01:15 - another backslide character over here so
01:18 - at all the instances we are providing
01:20 - the backslash characters over here and
01:22 - then guys in the end we have to again
01:24 - provide the name of the file so it is
01:26 - the test file so we provide test dot txt
01:30 - in this case so guys basically what this
01:32 - method that is base name will do is
01:35 - extract this file name that is a test
01:37 - dot txt it can be any file name based on
01:40 - your directory that you give to this
01:42 - particular function that is base name
01:44 - now guys we need to catch it in a
01:46 - variable so what I will do is on the
01:48 - left hand side we will simply provide a
01:49 - file name over here as the variable name
01:52 - so this file name will have the name of
01:54 - the file so let us print that so we will
01:57 - simply have the print function and we
01:59 - will say file time in this case we
02:01 - should print the name of the file that
02:03 - we have just mentioned over here let me
02:05 - just save this file now and try running
02:06 - this code so as you can see we have got
02:09 - test.txt that is the name of the file
02:11 - now guys how do we get just the name of
02:13 - this file and remove the extension from
02:16 - this part so we have something called a
02:18 - split text inside the OS module over
02:20 - here so we will simply use the OS module
02:23 - once again followed by Dot and then path
02:25 - followed by dot once again and then this
02:27 - time we will be using the split text as
02:29 - you can see the description split the
02:31 - extension from a path name over here so
02:34 - this is the functionality of this
02:36 - particular method inside the OS module
02:38 - what we need to provide is the name of
02:40 - the file which we have already extracted
02:42 - into this file name variable so I'll
02:45 - just copy this and paste this over here
02:47 - and then we can simply print just the
02:49 - name of the file in this case so guys
02:50 - over here what we will do is we will say
02:53 - full file name over here and then as you
02:55 - can see we have provided full file name
02:57 - label so along with the extension it
02:59 - will be printed and over here we will
03:02 - say we will have print statement and
03:04 - then we will enclose this entire
03:05 - statement that is the split text inside
03:07 - the print statement and before this we
03:09 - will say file name in this case without
03:12 - extension so this is without extension
03:16 - over here followed by colon and then we
03:19 - have comma so guys let me just save this
03:21 - file now and try running this code so as
03:23 - you can see we have got full file name
03:25 - it is test.txt and then file name
03:28 - without extension as you can see it is
03:30 - returning a stuple it is having two
03:32 - elements the first element is a test
03:34 - that is the name of the file that we
03:36 - have provided and then the second
03:37 - element is the extension that is dot txt
03:40 - so guys in order to just get the name of
03:42 - the file we can simply provide the open
03:45 - and close square brackets and then we
03:47 - can provide 0 in order to just get the
03:49 - first element which is the exact name of
03:51 - the file without extension so let me
03:54 - just save this file now and try running
03:55 - this code once again so as you can see
03:57 - full file name it is test.txt and then
04:00 - file name without extension it is test
04:02 - over here so guys this is a very simple
04:04 - method in order to get the name of the
04:06 - file without extension by using the OS
04:09 - module you can use your own file names
04:12 - along with the full directory path in
04:14 - order to just extract the name of the
04:16 - files now guys let us check another
04:18 - method over here as you can see we have
04:19 - something called as path module as well
04:21 - which we can use in order to extract the
04:24 - name of the file so let us move to vs
04:26 - code over here what we will do is
04:28 - instead of importing OS we will say from
04:31 - path lab so guys there is something
04:33 - called as pathletic module inside which
04:35 - we will have path so over here we will
04:38 - just import the path in this case so we
04:40 - are importing path and then guys we
04:42 - would be needing this directory path
04:45 - over here along with the file name so
04:46 - I'll simply copy this and remove all the
04:49 - lines of code over here for now and then
04:51 - what we will be doing is we will use
04:53 - this path class as you can see and then
04:55 - we need to provide the extension that is
04:58 - the absolute path of the entire
04:59 - directory along with the name of the
05:02 - file and then guys what we can do is we
05:04 - have to provide dot followed by there is
05:06 - something called as time over here so
05:08 - guys this time attribute will help us in
05:10 - order to as you can see the final path
05:12 - component minus its last suffix which
05:15 - means it will remove its extension over
05:18 - here and it will just provide the name
05:20 - of the file in this case so let me just
05:22 - use this and then we can simply enclose
05:24 - this entire statement within the print
05:26 - function so we will say print in this
05:28 - case so guys let me just save this file
05:30 - now and try running this code so as you
05:33 - can see we have got test that is the
05:34 - name of the file that we have provided
05:36 - over here as you can see test.txt is the
05:39 - name of the file guys what if we provide
05:41 - some other name that is let's say we
05:43 - provide the output name so I'll just
05:44 - copy this and paste this over here in
05:47 - the directory path along with the name
05:49 - of the file so this particular file name
05:51 - that is output should get printed over
05:53 - here on the terminal so let me just save
05:55 - this file now and try running this code
05:57 - once again so as you can see output is
05:59 - getting extracted as the file name and
06:02 - it is being printed over here on the
06:04 - terminal so Guys these are the two ways
06:06 - in order to extract the name of the file
06:08 - using the OS module and the path class
06:10 - as well please make sure that you like
06:12 - this video so that it reaches to more
06:14 - people and subscribe to the channel so
06:16 - that you get the notifications on
06:17 - upcoming videos as well the next video
06:19 - that we are going to talk about is
06:21 - Python program to represent enum so stay
06:24 - tuned
