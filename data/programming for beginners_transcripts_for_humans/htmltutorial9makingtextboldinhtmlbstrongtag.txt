00:00 - welcome to another video in which we are
00:01 - going to learn about making text bold in
00:04 - HTML using the B tag so guys basically
00:08 - you must have used bold formatting
00:10 - feature of the word processor now
00:13 - similarly we can have such formatting in
00:15 - HTML documents as well so in order to
00:17 - make the text as bold over here anything
00:20 - that appears between the B tag as you
00:23 - can see it is the less than symbol
00:25 - followed by the B character and then the
00:27 - greater than symbol and then we have the
00:29 - same ending tag over here which is
00:31 - having the forward slash before the
00:33 - character and in between both the
00:35 - starting and ending tags we have certain
00:37 - content now in between both these tags
00:40 - whatever content is present it will be
00:42 - appearing as the Bold text which means
00:45 - we want to get certain attention of the
00:47 - user while showing this content over
00:49 - here now guys we can also use the strong
00:51 - tag in the HTML 5 for bold appearance
00:55 - which shows importance so guys let us
00:57 - check this with the help of examples now
00:58 - in the VSS code I'll just remove these
01:01 - lines of code that were written
01:02 - previously and inside the body tag we
01:05 - will have a simple paragraph using the P
01:07 - tag we will see this text is bold in
01:13 - this paragraph So guys this is a simple
01:16 - paragraph and it will be displayed
01:17 - normally on the browser I'll just change
01:20 - this title to formatting over here since
01:22 - we are going to see the formatting
01:24 - examples in HTML so guys let me just
01:26 - save this file now and try reloading
01:28 - this page on the web browser so as you
01:30 - can see it is saying this text is bold
01:32 - in this paragraph now guys so far we
01:35 - have not used the B tag over here and
01:37 - this is a simple paragraph now let's say
01:39 - we want to make this highlighted text
01:41 - that is text is bold to appear as bold
01:45 - text so what we have to do is we need to
01:47 - enclose this text within the starting
01:50 - and the ending B tag so before this text
01:53 - we are going to have the less than
01:54 - symbol and then we will say B so as you
01:57 - can see the B element represents a span
01:59 - P of text to which attention is being
02:02 - drawn for utilitarian purposes without
02:05 - conveying any extra importance and with
02:08 - no implication of an alternate Voice or
02:11 - mode so guys basically it doesn't show
02:13 - any extra importance but only to draw
02:16 - the attention to this particular phrase
02:18 - we can use the B text over here and then
02:21 - after this character we can have the
02:23 - greater than symbol and then the same
02:25 - ending tag I'm going to cut this and
02:27 - paste it after this bold word over here
02:29 - so guys basically text is bold these
02:32 - three words are enclosed inside the B
02:35 - tag over here so let me just save this
02:37 - file now and try reloading this page
02:39 - once again before reloading you can see
02:41 - that this is a simple paragraph now
02:42 - after reloading we will check what
02:44 - happens so when we press on reload this
02:46 - page you can see text is bold appearance
02:49 - is changed now it is drawing the
02:51 - attention of the user by showing it as
02:53 - bold over here and guys this is the way
02:55 - that we can use the B tag now guys
02:57 - similarly we can also use the strong
02:59 - long tag over here let me just copy this
03:02 - line of code and paste this over here
03:04 - and what we will do is instead of using
03:06 - the B tag we will use the strong tag so
03:09 - as you can see the strong element
03:11 - represents strong importance seriousness
03:13 - or urgency for its content so we are
03:16 - going to use this tag over here and then
03:18 - I'll just cut this ending tag and then
03:21 - paste this over here instead of the
03:23 - ending tag of the B I will say text is
03:26 - bold so guys basically the content of
03:28 - both the paragraphs is same but we are
03:30 - having the strong tag over here instead
03:32 - of the P tag so let us see how it will
03:34 - be appeared so we will just save this
03:36 - file now and try reloading this page
03:38 - once again so as you can see it says
03:40 - this text is bold in this paragraph So
03:43 - guys there is no difference as far as
03:45 - appearance of both the paragraphs is
03:47 - concerned it's just that the meaning
03:49 - behind the scenes for this text is bold
03:51 - is not that important compared to what
03:54 - we have used over here in the this text
03:57 - is strong over here so basically we will
03:59 - have to change this text to this text is
04:02 - strong since we are using the strong tag
04:05 - guys it depends on you what text you
04:06 - want to make bold or strong but this is
04:09 - the main importance that to seek users
04:11 - attention to certain keywords on your
04:13 - web page we can either use bold or
04:15 - strong text based on our requirements so
