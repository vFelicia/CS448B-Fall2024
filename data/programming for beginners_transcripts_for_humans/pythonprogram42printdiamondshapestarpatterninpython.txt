00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to print a diamond shape
00:06 - star pattern so guys as you can see this
00:08 - is the diamond shaped star pattern over
00:10 - here it is having seven number of stars
00:12 - in the middle row over here and then
00:14 - right at the start we are having one two
00:17 - three four five six so six number of
00:20 - spaces and Then followed by one star
00:22 - character and then we have five number
00:24 - of space characters followed by two star
00:27 - characters and then so on there are
00:29 - seven star characters over here and then
00:31 - we have decreasing number of star
00:33 - characters over here after this pyramid
00:35 - pattern now guys what will be the logic
00:37 - in order to print this diamond shape
00:39 - star pattern over here so the algorithm
00:41 - for pattern programs it is usually the
00:44 - same it is just the difference between
00:45 - the logic that we Implement inside the
00:48 - for Loops so each pattern program has
00:51 - two or more than two Loops the number of
00:53 - the loop depends on the complexity of
00:55 - pattern on Logic the first for Loop
00:57 - works for the row and the second for
00:59 - Loop works for the column so guys let us
01:02 - check this with the help of the Python
01:03 - program how we can draw the diamond
01:05 - shaped star pattern so guys over here
01:07 - what we will do is we will have the rows
01:10 - as the variable name and we will take
01:12 - this as the input from the user so over
01:14 - here we will have the end function and
01:16 - then inside this we will have the import
01:18 - and we will ask the user to enter the
01:21 - number of rows so guys over here user
01:24 - will enter the number of rows that must
01:26 - be present in the diamond shape star
01:28 - pattern now guys after the user enters
01:30 - the number of rows it will be of the
01:31 - string data type so we have used this
01:33 - hint function in order to convert it
01:36 - into the integer data type now guys what
01:38 - we will do is simply we can have the for
01:40 - Loop in order to print the diamond shape
01:42 - star pattern so we will divide it into
01:45 - two parts first of all we will print the
01:47 - pyramid star pattern over here that is
01:49 - this pyramid star pattern and Then
01:51 - followed by we will print the second
01:53 - part that is reverse pyramid star
01:55 - pattern so what we have to do is first
01:57 - of all we will have the for low I in
02:01 - range and then this range it will go
02:04 - from 0 up to rows that is being entered
02:07 - by the user now guys what will be the
02:09 - logic as I have told you first of all we
02:11 - need to print these base characters over
02:13 - here so in this seven star characters we
02:15 - have six space characters over here in
02:17 - the starting line so what we have to do
02:19 - is we have to have the another for Loop
02:21 - that is the nested follow and it goes as
02:24 - J in range and then it will go from 0 up
02:29 - to rows and then minus I minus 1. so
02:34 - guys let's say if the number of rows is
02:35 - 7 so we need to have the six space
02:37 - characters over here initially so that
02:39 - is the reason why we have put rows minus
02:41 - 1 and then with the increase in the I
02:43 - the number of space characters should
02:45 - decrease over here and that is why we
02:47 - have given minus I as well over here now
02:49 - guys after this colon what we have to do
02:51 - is simply we will print the space
02:53 - characters over here double quotes and
02:55 - then space character now we don't want
02:57 - the control flow to go to the next line
02:59 - so we will have the end parameter as
03:02 - well over here and we will have the
03:03 - blank character inside the end parameter
03:06 - now guys after this for Loop is executed
03:08 - those many number of times and we have
03:11 - the space characters being printed on
03:12 - the terminal we need to print the star
03:15 - character as well so this time we have
03:17 - to use another for Loop J in range and
03:22 - then how many times it will go it will
03:24 - go from 0 up to only one star character
03:26 - needs to be printed at the starting line
03:29 - and in the second line we have two star
03:31 - characters and so on the star characters
03:33 - must increase so basically it is the
03:35 - function of this I variable so basically
03:38 - we need to have I plus 1 this time
03:40 - because initially the I value is 0 so it
03:43 - should go from 0 up to 1 the 1 will be
03:46 - not considered so only once the control
03:48 - flow will go inside this inner for Loop
03:51 - for the very first time so once it goes
03:53 - inside this for Loop we will have to
03:55 - print the star character so over here we
03:58 - will have star followed by space
04:00 - character so that all the star
04:02 - characters are separated by a space
04:04 - character over here and then again guys
04:06 - we don't want the control flow to go to
04:08 - the next line so we will have the end
04:10 - parameter over here once again so we
04:12 - have n and this is the blank character
04:14 - that we are going to use now guys after
04:16 - this once the space characters and the
04:18 - star characters are printed what we have
04:20 - to do is the control flow needs to go to
04:22 - the next line so we simply have to have
04:25 - the print statement over here so guys
04:27 - this is the first part in order to draw
04:29 - the diamond shaped star pattern this
04:31 - outer for Loop and the inner two for
04:33 - Loops will help us in order to print the
04:36 - pyramid star pattern over here which is
04:38 - the first part that we have completed so
04:40 - let us save this file now and try
04:41 - running this code once so over here I'm
04:43 - just running this so enter the number of
04:45 - rows let us say we put the number of
04:47 - rows as 5 over here and when we press
04:49 - enter as you can see we are getting the
04:51 - pyramid shape star pattern over here and
04:54 - this is the first part that we have
04:55 - completed now guys what we have to do is
04:57 - the reverse of this pyramid star pattern
04:59 - we need to draw in order to complete the
05:02 - diamond shaped star pattern so after
05:04 - this print statement we have to come out
05:06 - of this outer for Loop and again we are
05:08 - going to have another for Loop over here
05:10 - so we have 4 I in range and this time
05:15 - the range it will go from 0 up to rows
05:18 - minus 1 that's because guys only four
05:21 - number of rows we need to draw now so
05:22 - that is why we have to put rows minus 1
05:25 - this time so we put rows minus 1 over
05:28 - here followed by colon now guys what we
05:30 - have to do is we need to reverse the
05:32 - logic this time that is the logic that
05:34 - was used in order to print the space
05:36 - character previously we need to use it
05:38 - in order to draw the star pattern over
05:41 - there and the logic that we use in order
05:43 - to print the star character we will be
05:45 - using it in order to print the space
05:47 - character so over here I'll simply copy
05:50 - this for Loop so I'll just copy this and
05:52 - paste this over here and inside this we
05:54 - need to have the space characters over
05:56 - here so I'll just copy this and paste
05:58 - this over here so what we are doing over
06:00 - here guys is we need to have just one
06:02 - space character in order to print this
06:05 - row of star pattern so over here J will
06:07 - go from 0 up to I plus 1 this time so
06:10 - only one space character will be printed
06:12 - and then guys in order to print the star
06:15 - character what we have to do is I'll
06:17 - have to copy this line of code that is
06:19 - the range that is going from 0 up to
06:21 - rows minus I minus 1 over here so we'll
06:24 - simply provide this line and then over
06:28 - here I'll provide this star character to
06:30 - be printed so I'll just copy this and
06:32 - paste this over here now guys after this
06:34 - again we will be having the print
06:36 - statement so that the control flow goes
06:38 - to the next line so guys what exactly we
06:40 - are doing is the space character needs
06:42 - to be printed only once when we are
06:44 - printing it in the reverse order and
06:47 - then the star characters will be printed
06:49 - four number of times in this particular
06:51 - case that is why we are taking it from 0
06:53 - up to rows minus I minus 1 and then guys
06:56 - it should decrease with the increase in
06:58 - the number of rows over here so let me
07:00 - just save this file now and try running
07:01 - this code once again we will put the
07:03 - same number of rows that is 5 this time
07:05 - and then when we press enter as you can
07:08 - see we are getting the beautiful diamond
07:10 - pattern over here so as you can see this
07:12 - is the diamond shape star pattern that
07:14 - we were expecting to be printed on the
07:16 - console let me just run this code once
07:18 - again and this time we will provide 10
07:20 - number of rows so when we press enter as
07:23 - you can see this is a very big diamond
07:25 - shaped star pattern which we were
07:27 - expecting to be printed by using this
07:29 - Python program so guys this is the way
07:31 - that we can easily print the diamond
07:32 - shape star pattern just by using the
07:35 - nested for Loops so we have completed
07:37 - this Python program just by using the 15
07:39 - lines of code over here and with any
07:42 - number of rows we can draw a beautiful
07:43 - diamond shaped star pattern in the
07:46 - Python program so guys please make sure
07:48 - that you practice on your own so that on
07:49 - different inputs you get different
07:51 - outputs make sure that you like this
07:52 - video so that it reaches to more people
07:54 - and subscribe to the channel so that you
07:56 - get the notifications on upcoming videos
07:58 - as well the next video that we are going
08:00 - to talk about is Python program to
08:02 - remove punctuations from a string so
08:05 - stay tuned

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to print a diamond shape star pattern so guys as you can see this is the diamond shaped star pattern over here it is having seven number of stars in the middle row over here and then right at the start we are having one two three four five six so six number of spaces and Then followed by one star character and then we have five number of space characters followed by two star characters and then so on there are seven star characters over here and then we have decreasing number of star characters over here after this pyramid pattern now guys what will be the logic in order to print this diamond shape star pattern over here so the algorithm for pattern programs it is usually the same it is just the difference between the logic that we Implement inside the for Loops so each pattern program has two or more than two Loops the number of the loop depends on the complexity of pattern on Logic the first for Loop works for the row and the second for Loop works for the column so guys let us check this with the help of the Python program how we can draw the diamond shaped star pattern so guys over here what we will do is we will have the rows as the variable name and we will take this as the input from the user so over here we will have the end function and then inside this we will have the import and we will ask the user to enter the number of rows so guys over here user will enter the number of rows that must be present in the diamond shape star pattern now guys after the user enters the number of rows it will be of the string data type so we have used this hint function in order to convert it into the integer data type now guys what we will do is simply we can have the for Loop in order to print the diamond shape star pattern so we will divide it into two parts first of all we will print the pyramid star pattern over here that is this pyramid star pattern and Then followed by we will print the second part that is reverse pyramid star pattern so what we have to do is first of all we will have the for low I in range and then this range it will go from 0 up to rows that is being entered by the user now guys what will be the logic as I have told you first of all we need to print these base characters over here so in this seven star characters we have six space characters over here in the starting line so what we have to do is we have to have the another for Loop that is the nested follow and it goes as J in range and then it will go from 0 up to rows and then minus I minus 1. so guys let's say if the number of rows is 7 so we need to have the six space characters over here initially so that is the reason why we have put rows minus 1 and then with the increase in the I the number of space characters should decrease over here and that is why we have given minus I as well over here now guys after this colon what we have to do is simply we will print the space characters over here double quotes and then space character now we don't want the control flow to go to the next line so we will have the end parameter as well over here and we will have the blank character inside the end parameter now guys after this for Loop is executed those many number of times and we have the space characters being printed on the terminal we need to print the star character as well so this time we have to use another for Loop J in range and then how many times it will go it will go from 0 up to only one star character needs to be printed at the starting line and in the second line we have two star characters and so on the star characters must increase so basically it is the function of this I variable so basically we need to have I plus 1 this time because initially the I value is 0 so it should go from 0 up to 1 the 1 will be not considered so only once the control flow will go inside this inner for Loop for the very first time so once it goes inside this for Loop we will have to print the star character so over here we will have star followed by space character so that all the star characters are separated by a space character over here and then again guys we don't want the control flow to go to the next line so we will have the end parameter over here once again so we have n and this is the blank character that we are going to use now guys after this once the space characters and the star characters are printed what we have to do is the control flow needs to go to the next line so we simply have to have the print statement over here so guys this is the first part in order to draw the diamond shaped star pattern this outer for Loop and the inner two for Loops will help us in order to print the pyramid star pattern over here which is the first part that we have completed so let us save this file now and try running this code once so over here I'm just running this so enter the number of rows let us say we put the number of rows as 5 over here and when we press enter as you can see we are getting the pyramid shape star pattern over here and this is the first part that we have completed now guys what we have to do is the reverse of this pyramid star pattern we need to draw in order to complete the diamond shaped star pattern so after this print statement we have to come out of this outer for Loop and again we are going to have another for Loop over here so we have 4 I in range and this time the range it will go from 0 up to rows minus 1 that's because guys only four number of rows we need to draw now so that is why we have to put rows minus 1 this time so we put rows minus 1 over here followed by colon now guys what we have to do is we need to reverse the logic this time that is the logic that was used in order to print the space character previously we need to use it in order to draw the star pattern over there and the logic that we use in order to print the star character we will be using it in order to print the space character so over here I'll simply copy this for Loop so I'll just copy this and paste this over here and inside this we need to have the space characters over here so I'll just copy this and paste this over here so what we are doing over here guys is we need to have just one space character in order to print this row of star pattern so over here J will go from 0 up to I plus 1 this time so only one space character will be printed and then guys in order to print the star character what we have to do is I'll have to copy this line of code that is the range that is going from 0 up to rows minus I minus 1 over here so we'll simply provide this line and then over here I'll provide this star character to be printed so I'll just copy this and paste this over here now guys after this again we will be having the print statement so that the control flow goes to the next line so guys what exactly we are doing is the space character needs to be printed only once when we are printing it in the reverse order and then the star characters will be printed four number of times in this particular case that is why we are taking it from 0 up to rows minus I minus 1 and then guys it should decrease with the increase in the number of rows over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again we will put the same number of rows that is 5 this time and then when we press enter as you can see we are getting the beautiful diamond pattern over here so as you can see this is the diamond shape star pattern that we were expecting to be printed on the console let me just run this code once again and this time we will provide 10 number of rows so when we press enter as you can see this is a very big diamond shaped star pattern which we were expecting to be printed by using this Python program so guys this is the way that we can easily print the diamond shape star pattern just by using the nested for Loops so we have completed this Python program just by using the 15 lines of code over here and with any number of rows we can draw a beautiful diamond shaped star pattern in the Python program so guys please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to the channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is Python program to remove punctuations from a string so stay tuned
