00:00 - so now we will see responsive web design
00:02 - in HTML so guys basically responsive web
00:05 - design is about creating web pages that
00:08 - look good on all devices so whether you
00:11 - view the web pages on the computer or
00:13 - desktop or your laptop or tablets or
00:16 - even your mobile phones so basically
00:18 - whatever web pages that we design using
00:20 - the HTML code it should be looking good
00:23 - on all the devices irrespective from
00:25 - where the viewer is viewing your web
00:28 - page now guys this design is called the
00:30 - responsive web design that means the
00:32 - HTML web page will adapt itself in order
00:35 - to look good on all the devices now a
00:38 - responsive web design will automatically
00:41 - adjust for different screen sizes and
00:43 - the view ports responsive web design is
00:45 - about using HTML and CSS to
00:48 - automatically resize hide shrink or
00:51 - enlarge a website to make it look good
00:54 - on all the devices such as desktops
00:56 - tablets and phones so guys as I've told
00:59 - you responsive web design is nothing but
01:01 - it is the attempt in order to make the
01:03 - HTML and CSS in such a way that it
01:06 - should resize hide and Shrink or enlarge
01:09 - the existing HTML elements to different
01:12 - devices such as desktops tablets and
01:15 - mobile phones as well now in order to
01:17 - create the responsive website we add the
01:20 - meta tag over here so as you can see
01:22 - this is the meta tag with the name that
01:24 - is viewport and the content as the width
01:27 - is equal to device width and the initial
01:29 - scale is is equal to 1 so guys this we
01:31 - are going to check with the help of
01:33 - example as well we need to mention this
01:35 - meta tag inside the head tag of the HTML
01:38 - document so guys let us move to the vs
01:40 - code over here I'll clear all the lines
01:42 - of code for now so basically whenever we
01:44 - are going to create the new HTML code
01:47 - what we do is we first type HTML and as
01:50 - you can see HTML colon file this is the
01:53 - option that we will select so that we
01:55 - get the boiler plate code in the VSS
01:57 - code so guys this is one of the
01:59 - important feature features of the vs
02:00 - code it helps us in order to create the
02:03 - boiler plate code that is ready for use
02:05 - so that we can focus on our
02:07 - functionality of the web page now guys
02:09 - over here by default as you can see this
02:11 - is the meta tag over here with the name
02:14 - that is viewport which is responsible in
02:16 - order to create this web page as a
02:19 - responsive web page so what we will do
02:21 - is first of all we will comment out this
02:23 - line over here so that we don't see a
02:25 - responsive web page that we are going to
02:27 - Define and then guys the title of the
02:29 - this document we are going to Define it
02:31 - as responsive web page over here and now
02:34 - guys what we will be doing is first of
02:36 - all we will have the image so I'm going
02:38 - to define the image over here in which
02:40 - case we are going to display this image
02:43 - which is the thumbnail of one of the
02:44 - videos that we have already created so
02:47 - guys the directory path we are going to
02:49 - provide in the base tag over here so
02:51 - that we can refer to that particular
02:54 - path as the parent path so over here we
02:56 - provide the base tag and to the hrf we
02:59 - Prov provide this directory path over
03:01 - here followed by the back slash in this
03:03 - case now guys since we have to use the
03:05 - horizontal scroll bar over here what we
03:07 - can do is we can use the word rap
03:09 - functionality of vs code so we have to
03:12 - come to this view menu over here and
03:14 - then you can see word rrap in this case
03:16 - so basically we are using the word r so
03:18 - that we can see the entire content on
03:21 - one screen without using the horizontal
03:23 - scroll bar over here guys this becomes
03:25 - important when we are having the text
03:27 - that is long enough that goes out side
03:30 - the screen width on this vs code now
03:32 - guys what we have to do is we need to
03:34 - provide the source of this image and
03:36 - then this is nothing but it is going to
03:38 - be the name of the file so let's say we
03:40 - want to provide this file that is the
03:43 - image to be displayed on the web page so
03:46 - we provide the name of this file and the
03:48 - prefix that is the entire directory path
03:50 - is being provided in the base tag over
03:53 - here so we just have to provide the name
03:54 - of the file followed by PNG that is the
03:57 - extension in this case and then let's
04:00 - say we provide the alt attribute as test
04:03 - image over here which is the value so in
04:05 - case the image is not found over here
04:08 - then this test image will be displayed
04:09 - so let me just save this file now and
04:11 - try reloading this page on the browser
04:13 - so as you can see the image is being
04:15 - displayed over here but guys the image
04:17 - is right now enlarged in this case so
04:20 - what we can do is let's say we only want
04:22 - to display the 50% of the image as the
04:25 - width so we provide the width as the 50%
04:29 - so so guys this will be the 50% of the
04:32 - screen that will be occupied by the
04:34 - image over here so let me just save this
04:36 - file now and try reloading this page so
04:38 - as you can see only 50% of the width is
04:41 - being taken by the image right now over
04:43 - here guys what if we don't provide the
04:45 - extension so when we don't provide the
04:47 - extension so basically whatever text is
04:50 - being provided inside the alt attribute
04:52 - that text will be displayed that's
04:54 - because the HTML code will not be able
04:57 - to find this particular file because we
04:59 - have not provided the extension let me
05:01 - just save this file now and try
05:03 - reloading this page so as you can see
05:05 - test image that is the text inside the
05:08 - alt attribute is being displayed right
05:10 - now guys that is why it becomes very
05:12 - important that we provide the alt
05:14 - attribute over here so in case there are
05:16 - certain issues in order to find the
05:18 - files on the server then we can at least
05:21 - have the text being displayed to the
05:23 - user now guys what we are going to do is
05:25 - after this we are going to have the
05:26 - heading that is H1 over here and then we
05:29 - will say this is heading one in this
05:32 - case and then guys again we are going to
05:34 - have the paragraph and we will be having
05:36 - a long paragraph over here so guys for
05:38 - test content we are going to provide the
05:41 - lauram Epsom text so guys this is a long
05:43 - text and this is what we are going to
05:45 - select on the vs code so guys this is
05:47 - another important functionality of vs
05:50 - code it provides a certain test data as
05:52 - well in order to test our web pages now
05:55 - guys let me just save this file now and
05:56 - try reloading this page on the browser
05:58 - so as you you can see we are having the
06:00 - 50% width of the image that is being
06:03 - displayed and then we are having this is
06:05 - heading one that is being displayed
06:06 - using the hed1 tag and then we also have
06:09 - the P tag which is having certain
06:11 - content over here now guys how do we
06:12 - know whether this page is responsive or
06:15 - not so what we can do is we can press
06:17 - the F12 button on the keyboard so as you
06:20 - can see this is the Dave tools that is
06:22 - being opened right now over here and
06:24 - then on the left the second icon you can
06:26 - see toggle device toolbar so guys
06:29 - basically we are going to select this
06:31 - option so that we can see how this web
06:33 - page looks on different devices with
06:35 - different screen sizes so guys we just
06:37 - need to click over here on this
06:39 - particular icon so as you can see we
06:41 - have selected the responsive option over
06:44 - here we can select a different options
06:45 - that is iPhone SE and then there are
06:47 - different options for the mobile phones
06:49 - and the tablets as well but currently we
06:52 - are going to see the responsive option
06:54 - and this is how it is being displayed
06:56 - right now I'll just decrease the size of
06:58 - this Dave console and then when we
07:00 - increase the size you can see that this
07:02 - is the perfect web page that is being
07:04 - displayed that is 50% of the width is
07:06 - being occupied by this image and then we
07:09 - have the heading and then we have the
07:11 - paragraph as well now guys when we
07:13 - decrease the screen size as you can see
07:16 - the size of the image heading and
07:17 - paragraph is also decreasing up to this
07:20 - point and then guys what is happening is
07:22 - when we decrease the size more you can
07:24 - see that the paragraph is getting
07:26 - truncated now and then the heading is
07:28 - also getting truncated so guys this is
07:30 - the main issue when we are not making
07:32 - our web pages responsive over here when
07:35 - you decrease the width of the screen
07:37 - more as you can see now the image is
07:39 - getting truncated and not the entire
07:41 - image is being displayed right now so
07:43 - guys currently as you can see even the
07:45 - heading and the paragraph is not getting
07:47 - displayed properly right now not all the
07:50 - text is getting displayed currently so
07:52 - you can see this is the horizontal
07:53 - scroll bar that is present right now on
07:56 - this particular screen with very small
07:58 - width so guys what we can do is we can
08:01 - use the meta tag over here that we had
08:03 - just commented during the start of this
08:05 - video so we'll just remove the comment
08:07 - from here and then we are going to set
08:09 - the viewport property that is under the
08:12 - meta tag in this case so guys let me
08:14 - just save this file now and try
08:16 - reloading this page with the same width
08:18 - of the responsive device over here so
08:21 - when we reload this page as you can see
08:23 - the image is now set to the 50% of this
08:26 - particular current withd right now and
08:28 - then the end entire heading is being
08:30 - displayed this is heading one and then
08:33 - this paragraph is also being displayed
08:35 - right now and there is no horizontal
08:37 - scroll bar right now that you can see
08:39 - and if I moving left and right it is not
08:41 - moving so guys basically this is a
08:43 - complete responsive page right now just
08:46 - by using this viewport we are making the
08:49 - web page responsive which will adapt
08:51 - itself based on the width of the screen
08:53 - so as you can see the image is being
08:55 - displayed completely even though it is
08:58 - very small but it is is not truncating
09:00 - the image or the text from the right
09:02 - hand side so guys in this way we can
09:03 - easily make our web pages responsive
09:05 - over here and test it by using the Dave
09:08 - tools under which we have the responsive
09:10 - option over here now guys we can make
09:12 - the width of the image as 100% as well
09:15 - so let me just do that quickly so when
09:17 - we do it 100% that is the width of the
09:20 - image let me just refresh this page once
09:22 - again so as you can see the entire width
09:24 - of the device is being taken by this
09:27 - particular image and when we decrease
09:28 - the width of this screen you can see
09:31 - that the image is even scaling down its
09:33 - width automatically so guys this is the
09:35 - main functionality of having the
09:37 - responsive page over here it
09:39 - automatically shrinks or enlarges the
09:42 - content that is present inside the web
09:44 - page which is responsive and then to
09:46 - disable this view we can again click on
09:48 - this particular icon over here so that
09:50 - it can be displayed on the normal web
09:52 - page so guys it becomes very important
09:54 - to include this particular line of code
09:56 - that is the meta teag along with the
09:59 - name attribute that is viewport and then
10:02 - this content attribute over here which
10:04 - gets automatically applied when you are
10:06 - writing the HTML code in the vs code so
10:09 - guys comment in the comment section
10:10 - below whether you have learned something
10:12 - out of this video please make sure that

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see responsive web design in HTML so guys basically responsive web design is about creating web pages that look good on all devices so whether you view the web pages on the computer or desktop or your laptop or tablets or even your mobile phones so basically whatever web pages that we design using the HTML code it should be looking good on all the devices irrespective from where the viewer is viewing your web page now guys this design is called the responsive web design that means the HTML web page will adapt itself in order to look good on all the devices now a responsive web design will automatically adjust for different screen sizes and the view ports responsive web design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize hide shrink or enlarge a website to make it look good on all the devices such as desktops tablets and phones so guys as I've told you responsive web design is nothing but it is the attempt in order to make the HTML and CSS in such a way that it should resize hide and Shrink or enlarge the existing HTML elements to different devices such as desktops tablets and mobile phones as well now in order to create the responsive website we add the meta tag over here so as you can see this is the meta tag with the name that is viewport and the content as the width is equal to device width and the initial scale is is equal to 1 so guys this we are going to check with the help of example as well we need to mention this meta tag inside the head tag of the HTML document so guys let us move to the vs code over here I'll clear all the lines of code for now so basically whenever we are going to create the new HTML code what we do is we first type HTML and as you can see HTML colon file this is the option that we will select so that we get the boiler plate code in the VSS code so guys this is one of the important feature features of the vs code it helps us in order to create the boiler plate code that is ready for use so that we can focus on our functionality of the web page now guys over here by default as you can see this is the meta tag over here with the name that is viewport which is responsible in order to create this web page as a responsive web page so what we will do is first of all we will comment out this line over here so that we don't see a responsive web page that we are going to Define and then guys the title of the this document we are going to Define it as responsive web page over here and now guys what we will be doing is first of all we will have the image so I'm going to define the image over here in which case we are going to display this image which is the thumbnail of one of the videos that we have already created so guys the directory path we are going to provide in the base tag over here so

so as you can see only 50% of the width is being taken by the image right now over here guys what if we don't provide the extension so when we don't provide the extension so basically whatever text is being provided inside the alt attribute that text will be displayed that's because the HTML code will not be able to find this particular file because we have not provided the extension let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see test image that is the text inside the alt attribute is being displayed right now guys that is why it becomes very important that we provide the alt attribute over here so in case there are certain issues in order to find the files on the server then we can at least have the text being displayed to the user now guys what we are going to do is after this we are going to have the heading that is H1 over here and then we will say this is heading one in this case and then guys again we are going to have the paragraph and we will be having a long paragraph over here so guys for test content we are going to provide the lauram Epsom text so guys this is a long text and this is what we are going to select on the vs code so guys this is another important functionality of vs code it provides a certain test data as well in order to test our web pages now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you you can see we are having the 50% width of the image that is being displayed and then we are having this is heading one that is being displayed using the hed1 tag and then we also have the P tag which is having certain content over here now guys how do we know whether this page is responsive or not so what we can do is we can press the F12 button on the keyboard so as you can

displayed that is 50% of the width is being occupied by this image and then we have the heading and then we have the paragraph as well now guys when we decrease the screen size as you can see the size of the image heading and paragraph is also decreasing up to this point and then guys what is happening is when we decrease the size more you can see that the paragraph is getting truncated now and then the heading is also getting truncated so guys this is the main issue when we are not making our web pages responsive over here when you decrease the width of the screen more as you can see now the image is getting truncated and not the entire image is being displayed right now so guys currently as you can see even the heading and the paragraph is not getting displayed properly right now not all the text is getting displayed currently so you can see this is the horizontal scroll bar that is present right now on this particular screen with very small width so guys what we can do is we can use the meta tag over here that we had just commented during the start of this video so we'll just remove the comment from here and then we are going to set the viewport property that is under the meta tag in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page with the same width of the responsive device over here so when we reload this page as you can see the image is now set to the 50% of this particular current withd right now and then the end entire heading is being displayed this is heading one and then this paragraph is also being displayed right now and there is no horizontal scroll bar right now that you can see and if I moving left and right it is not moving so guys basically this is a complete responsive page right now just by using this viewport we are making the web page responsive which will adapt itself based on the width of the screen so as you can see the image is being displayed completely even though it is very small but it is is not truncating the image or the text from the right hand side so guys in this way we can easily make our web pages responsive over here and test it by using the Dave tools under which we have the
