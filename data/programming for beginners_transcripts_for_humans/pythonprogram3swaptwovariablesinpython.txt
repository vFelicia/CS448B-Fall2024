00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to swap two variables so
00:06 - guys over here there are two ways in
00:08 - order to swap two variables in Python
00:10 - basically first of all we are going to
00:12 - use a temporary variable in order to
00:14 - swap two variables and secondly we are
00:16 - going to see how we can swap two
00:18 - variables without using a temporary
00:20 - variable so guys let us move to the vs
00:22 - code over here so what we will do is
00:24 - let's say we have two numbers over here
00:26 - x it is equal to 10 and then let's say
00:29 - we provide y it is equal to 20 so guys
00:32 - what we will do is we will simply print
00:34 - the values of X and Y before swapping so
00:37 - we say print and then inside this we
00:40 - have the values of X and Y are we will
00:45 - provide open and close curly braces and
00:48 - Then followed by comma and then again
00:49 - open and close curly braces and then
00:51 - after this we will provide format over
00:53 - here so dot format and we simply provide
00:56 - the x and y variable so I have X comma 5
00:59 - so guys this parameters in the format
01:01 - function will help us to print the
01:03 - values X and Y by using these open and
01:06 - close curly braces over here and then we
01:08 - missed out one thing that is the values
01:10 - of X and Y are after printing the values
01:12 - we have to provide before swapping so
01:15 - over here we provide before swapping
01:17 - label so that we come to know that these
01:20 - are the values before swapping so guys
01:22 - let me just save this file now and try
01:23 - running this code so as you can see the
01:26 - values of X and Y are 10 comma 20 before
01:29 - swapping now guys let us say we want to
01:31 - swap the values of these two variables
01:33 - which means we want to assign this value
01:35 - that is 20 to X and then the value of x
01:38 - which was 10 should be assigned to this
01:40 - variable that is y so what we can simply
01:43 - do is we can use a temporary variable so
01:45 - we can have temp it is equal to X so
01:48 - basically first of all we are storing
01:49 - this value that is 10 to the temporary
01:51 - variable and then we will assign this
01:54 - value 20 to the variable X over here so
01:57 - what we can say is equal to Y so after
01:59 - the state mean we have 20 as the value
02:02 - for x and for the variable y we still
02:04 - have the value 20 so we need to get the
02:07 - value of 10 over here for the Y variable
02:09 - which we can get by using the stamp
02:11 - variable that we have just used
02:14 - L equal to temp in this case so guys
02:16 - first of all we are assigning the value
02:18 - of 10 that is X to 10 so that we can
02:21 - temporarily store the value that is 10
02:23 - over here then we are assigning the
02:25 - value of y which is 20 to the variable
02:27 - that is X and then again to the variable
02:30 - y we are assigning the value of temp
02:32 - which is having the value as 10 in this
02:34 - case so guys over here what we can do is
02:37 - simply we can copy this line that is a
02:39 - print statement and after all these
02:41 - three operations we can paste it over
02:42 - here the values of X and Y are we will
02:45 - get the X and Y values and over here we
02:48 - simply have to do after swapping so we
02:50 - have not changed anything inside this
02:52 - print statement but we are only changing
02:55 - the label over here so now we should get
02:57 - 20 and then 10 in this case for the
02:59 - values of X and Y variables now let me
03:02 - save this file now I'll try running this
03:04 - code so as you can see the values of X
03:07 - and Y are 10 comma 20 before swapping so
03:10 - that is what we had assigned over here
03:12 - initially but after swapping pain which
03:14 - means after carrying out these three
03:16 - operations we are getting the values of
03:19 - X and Y are 20 comma 10 after swapping
03:22 - so guys we have successfully swapped
03:24 - both the variables in this case that is
03:26 - the values of X and Y have been swapped
03:28 - successfully now guys there is another
03:30 - way in order to swap the variables that
03:33 - is without using the temporary variable
03:35 - so what we can do is we can simply
03:37 - remove these lines of code but by using
03:39 - just one line of code over here we can
03:41 - simply swap both the variables so over
03:44 - here what we can do is we provide X
03:46 - followed by comma and then we provide y
03:48 - it is equal to Simply what we can do is
03:51 - we can swap the two variables over here
03:53 - so first of all we have to provide Y and
03:55 - Then followed by comma and then we have
03:57 - X so guys what exactly we are doing is
04:00 - the value of y should be assigned to X
04:02 - in this case and the value of x should
04:05 - be assigned to Y in this case and that
04:07 - is what the meaning of this expression
04:09 - is so after this expression gets
04:12 - executed we will have the swap operate
04:13 - relation successful so guys let me just
04:16 - save this file now and try running this
04:17 - code so as you can see we are getting
04:19 - the values of X and Y are 10 and 20
04:22 - before swapping and then again we are
04:24 - getting the values of X and Y are 20
04:27 - comma 10 after swapping so guys
04:29 - successfully we were able to swap both
04:31 - the variables over here as we can see so
04:33 - guys practice on your own show that on
04:35 - different inputs you get different
04:36 - outputs please make sure that you like

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to swap two variables so guys over here there are two ways in order to swap two variables in Python basically first of all we are going to use a temporary variable in order to swap two variables and secondly we are going to see how we can swap two variables without using a temporary variable so guys let us move to the vs code over here so what we will do is let's say we have two numbers over here x it is equal to 10 and then let's say we provide y it is equal to 20 so guys what we will do is we will simply print the values of X and Y before swapping so we say print and then inside this we have the values of X and Y are we will provide open and close curly braces and Then followed by comma and then again open and close curly braces and then after this we will provide format over here so dot format and we simply provide the x and y variable so I have X comma 5 so guys this parameters in the format function will help us to print the values X and Y by using these open and close curly braces over here and then we missed out one thing that is the values of X and Y are after printing the values we have to provide before swapping so over here we provide before swapping label so that we come to know that these are the values before swapping so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see the values of X and Y are 10 comma 20 before swapping now guys let us say we want to swap the values of these two variables which means we want to assign this value that is 20 to X and then the value of x which was 10 should be assigned to this variable that is y so what we can simply do is we can use a temporary variable so we can have temp it is equal to X so basically first of all we are storing this value that is 10 to the temporary variable and then we will assign this value 20 to the variable X over here so what we can say is equal to Y so after the state mean we have 20 as the value for x and for the variable y we still have the value 20 so we need to get the value of 10 over here for the Y variable which we can get by using the stamp variable that we have just used L equal to temp in this case so guys first of all we are assigning the value of 10 that is X to 10 so that we can temporarily store the value that is 10 over here then we are assigning the value of y which is 20 to the variable that is X and then again to the variable y we are assigning the value of temp which is having the value as 10 in this case so guys over here what we can do is simply we can copy this line that is a print statement and after all these three operations we can paste it over here the values of X and Y are we will get the X and Y values and over here we simply have to do after swapping so we have not changed anything inside this print statement but we are only changing the label over here so now we should get 20 and then 10 in this case for the values of X and Y variables now let me save this file now I'll try running this code so as you can see the values of X and Y are 10 comma 20 before swapping so that is what we had assigned over here initially but after swapping pain which means after carrying out these three operations we are getting the values of X and Y are 20 comma 10 after swapping so guys we have successfully swapped both the variables in this case that is the values of X and Y have been swapped successfully now guys there is another way in order to swap the variables that is without using the temporary variable so what we can do is we can simply remove these lines of code but by using just one line of code over here we can simply swap both the variables so over here what we can do is we provide X followed by comma and then we provide y it is equal to Simply what we can do is we can swap the two variables over here so first of all we have to provide Y and Then followed by comma and then we have X so guys what exactly we are doing is the value of y should be assigned to X in this case and the value of x should be assigned to Y in this case and that is what the meaning of this expression is so after this expression gets executed we will have the swap operate relation successful so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting the values of X and Y are 10 and 20 before swapping and then again we are getting the values of X and Y are 20 comma 10 after swapping so guys successfully we were able to swap both the variables over here as we can see so guys practice on your own show that on different inputs you get different outputs please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is Python program to Generate random numbers so stay tuned
