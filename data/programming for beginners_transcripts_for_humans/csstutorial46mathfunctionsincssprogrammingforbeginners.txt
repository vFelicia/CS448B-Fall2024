With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see math functions in CSS
00:03 - so guys basically the CSS math functions
00:05 - allow mathematical Expressions to be
00:08 - used as property values and this we are
00:10 - going to check with the help of examples
00:12 - as well so we will see the various
00:14 - functions such as the caly function and
00:16 - the max function and the Min function
00:18 - over here so guys basically we can
00:20 - provide the mathematical expressions in
00:23 - between these parenthesis that you can
00:24 - see inside this for these CSS math
00:27 - functions so guys let us check the
00:29 - examples over here so basically the
00:31 - Kelsey function performs a calculation
00:33 - to be used as the property value so guys
00:35 - let us check this with the help of
00:37 - example in vs code over here so simply
00:39 - inside this body section of the HTML web
00:41 - page what we are going to do is we will
00:43 - simply have the diff container over here
00:46 - so we will Define the diff tag with the
00:47 - class container in this case and then
00:49 - guys basically we are going to generate
00:51 - some random text over here using the LM
00:54 - M abbreviation so guys as you can see we
00:56 - have generated some random text in this
00:58 - case now guys let me just SA this file
01:00 - now and try reloading this page on the
01:02 - browser so as you can see this is some
01:04 - random text that we have generated now
01:06 - guys what we will do is inside the
01:08 - style. CSS file we will provide certain
01:11 - CSS properties to this class container
01:13 - over here which is associated with the
01:15 - diff tag that we have defined so guys
01:17 - basically we are going to have the
01:19 - background color as yellow in this case
01:21 - so we will use the background color CSS
01:23 - property also we will Define the Border
01:26 - as two pixels border withd with the
01:28 - Border style as solid and the Border
01:31 - color as black color in this case let us
01:33 - also provide certain padding over here
01:35 - so we will provide the value as 5 pixels
01:37 - in this case let me just save this file
01:39 - now and try reloading this page once
01:41 - again on the browser so as you can see
01:43 - this is the dev with the class container
01:45 - with the required CSS properties that we
01:48 - have defined now guys how do we use the
01:50 - Kelsey function that is the math
01:52 - function over here inside the style. CSS
01:55 - file so guys we can use the with CSS
01:58 - property in order to define the width of
02:00 - this particular diff tag So currently it
02:02 - is taking the 100% width of this entire
02:05 - screen let us set it to 50% width of the
02:08 - screen so how we can do that simply by
02:11 - providing the width property over here
02:13 - and then simply we can provide 50% in
02:15 - this case so let me just save this file
02:17 - now and try reloading this page once
02:19 - again on the browser so as you can see
02:21 - we have the 50% within this case now
02:23 - guys this is the direct way in order to
02:25 - provide certain value to the CSS
02:27 - property but let's say from this 100% of
02:30 - the width of this particular diff
02:31 - container that we have seen just now so
02:33 - let us change it to 100% in this case so
02:36 - let's say if we only want to remove the
02:38 - 200 pixels from the right so what we can
02:41 - do is simply we can use the math
02:43 - function that is Kelsey over here so as
02:45 - you can see this is the function and
02:47 - inside this we have to provide the
02:49 - expression that is 100% minus 200 pixels
02:53 - so guys basically this is the
02:54 - mathematical expression that we are
02:56 - providing what we are saying to the web
02:58 - browser over here is from the 100% of
03:01 - the width please remove 200 pixels so
03:04 - whatever the result will be of this
03:06 - particular expression that result will
03:08 - be set as the width of this particular
03:10 - class that is container over here so let
03:12 - me just save this file now and try
03:14 - reloading this page once again on the
03:15 - browser so as you can see from the right
03:18 - 200 pixels has been removed from here
03:20 - that is from the 100% we are subtracting
03:23 - 200 pixels of the width and this is the
03:25 - way that the width of a particular div
03:27 - container or any other HTML element can
03:29 - be set by using the Kelsey math function
03:32 - over here guys apart from this let us
03:34 - say if we want to remove more 100 pixels
03:36 - from the right so what we can do is from
03:38 - the 100% of the width we want to remove
03:41 - 300 pixels from here so simply we have
03:43 - to minus the 300 pixels let me just save
03:46 - this file now and try reloading this
03:48 - page once again on the browser so as you
03:50 - can see 300 pixels is removed from the
03:53 - 100% of the width of this particular div
03:55 - container and in this way you can
03:57 - provide the mathematical expression in
03:59 - inside the parenthesis of this math
04:01 - function that is kelc now guys apart
04:03 - from this we also have the max function
04:05 - over here which uses the largest value
04:08 - so we will be providing the comma
04:09 - separated list of values from which the
04:12 - largest value will be used in order to
04:14 - set the property value in this case so
04:17 - guys let us check this as well so what
04:19 - we will do is instead of using the
04:20 - Kelsey math function we will use the max
04:23 - math function over here and inside this
04:25 - let us say we only provide one value
04:27 - that is 300 pixels over here so so guys
04:30 - what will happen so in this case since
04:31 - the largest value is 300 pixels because
04:34 - that is the only value that is present
04:36 - right now inside the max math function
04:38 - so that is what is going to be set as
04:40 - the value for this particular width of
04:42 - the container so guys let me just save
04:44 - this file now and try reloading this
04:46 - page once again on the browser so as you
04:48 - can see this is the 300 pixels width of
04:50 - the diff container if we right click
04:52 - over here and click on the inspect
04:53 - option we will be able to see the width
04:56 - of the container over here as you can
04:58 - see the content is 300 * by 180 so over
05:01 - here 300 is the width of this particular
05:04 - Dev element right now so guys in this
05:06 - way you can use the max function with
05:08 - just one value and apart from this let
05:10 - us say we also want to provide another
05:13 - value that is 50% of the entire width of
05:16 - the screen so guys over here we have to
05:18 - provide comma followed by 50% so guys
05:21 - this is another value over here so
05:23 - currently 300 pixels is this much on the
05:25 - screen that you can see and when we say
05:27 - 50% it will be at the center of the
05:30 - screen where the right hand side of the
05:32 - div element must be present so Guys
05:34 - Somewhere over here the right hand side
05:35 - of the div element should occur when we
05:38 - apply these changes over here so let me
05:39 - just save this file now and try
05:41 - reloading this page once again on the
05:43 - browser so as you can see the 50% of the
05:46 - width of the screen is being taken right
05:48 - now and the border is present at the
05:50 - center of the page over here as far as
05:52 - horizontal alignment is concerned so
05:54 - guys out of 300 pixels and 50% 50% is
05:58 - greater right now and that is what is
05:59 - being set as the value of the width CSS
06:02 - property now guys apart from this let us
06:04 - say we also have 70% as the width So
06:07 - currently 70% of the width will be the
06:09 - highest number over here so let me just
06:11 - save this file now and try reloading
06:13 - this page once again on the browser so
06:15 - 70% is being set as the width of the div
06:18 - container so in this way you can also
06:20 - use the max math function inside the CSS
06:23 - for any of the CSS properties that you
06:25 - want to use the mathematical expression
06:28 - for now guys similarly we will have the
06:30 - Min function as well which uses the
06:32 - smallest value from the comma separated
06:34 - list of values as the property value so
06:37 - guys let us check this as well so out of
06:39 - all these three values that we have
06:41 - provided 70% is the largest value and
06:44 - that is what we have seen over here that
06:46 - is 70% of the width is getting
06:49 - implemented right now for this div
06:51 - container what if we provide the minan
06:53 - function for the same list of values so
06:55 - in this case the minimum value will be
06:57 - 300 pixels because that is the smallest
07:00 - value out of all these three values and
07:02 - that is what should be set as the width
07:05 - for this particular div container so
07:07 - guys let me just save this file now and
07:09 - try reloading this page notice that we
07:11 - have provided the Min function over here
07:14 - instead of Max function so when we
07:15 - reload this page as you can see the
07:17 - minimum value which is 300 pixels out of
07:20 - all these list of values will be
07:22 - implemented as the width of the div
07:24 - container when we right click and click
07:26 - on the inspect option you can see that
07:28 - the 300 pixels that is the width is
07:30 - being set for this particular HTML
07:32 - element apart from this we can also
07:34 - reduce the width so let's say we provide
07:36 - another value is 200 pixels So currently
07:39 - 200 pixels is the smallest value out of
07:42 - all these values that we can see right
07:44 - now so when we save this file now and
07:46 - try reloading this page once again on
07:48 - the browser so as you can see 200 pixels
07:51 - is being set as the width of the HTML
07:53 - element and instead of using Min we can
07:55 - also use max function in this case let
07:57 - me just save this file now so currently
07:59 - 70% will be set as the width of the div
08:02 - element so when we reload this page as
08:04 - you can see this is the 70% of the
08:07 - screen that is being taken by this HTML
08:09 - element so guys comment in the comment

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see math functions in CSS so guys basically the CSS math functions allow mathematical Expressions to be used as property values and this we are going to check with the help of examples as well so we will see the various functions such as the caly function and the max function and the Min function over here so guys basically we can provide the mathematical expressions in between these parenthesis that you can see inside this for these CSS math functions so guys let us check the examples over here so basically the Kelsey function performs a calculation to be used as the property value so guys let us check this with the help of example in vs code over here so simply inside this body section of the HTML web page what we are going to do is we will simply have the diff container over here so we will Define the diff tag with the class container in this case and then guys basically we are going to generate some random text over here using the LM M abbreviation so guys as you can see we have generated some random text in this case now guys let me just SA this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see this is some random text that we have generated now guys what we will do is inside the style. CSS file we will provide certain CSS properties to this class container over here which is associated with the diff tag that we have defined so guys basically we are going to have the background color as yellow in this case so we will use the background color CSS property also we will Define the Border as two pixels border withd with the Border style as solid and the Border color as black color in this case let us also provide certain padding over here so we will provide the value as 5 pixels in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is the dev with the class container with the required CSS properties that we have defined now guys how do we use the Kelsey function that is the math function over here inside the style. CSS file so guys we can use the with CSS property in order to define the width of this particular diff tag So currently it is taking the 100% width of this entire screen let us set it to 50% width of the screen so how we can do that simply by providing the width property over here and then simply we can provide 50% in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the 50% within this case now guys this is the direct way in order to provide certain value to the CSS property but let's say from this 100% of the width of this particular diff container that we have seen just now so let us change it to 100% in this case so let's say if we only want to remove the 200 pixels from the right so what we can do is simply we can use the math function that is Kelsey over here so as you can see this is the function and inside this we have to provide the expression that is 100% minus 200 pixels so guys basically this is the mathematical expression that we are providing what we are saying to the web browser over here is from the 100% of the width please remove 200 pixels so whatever the result will be of this particular expression that result will be set as the width of this particular class that is container over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see from the right 200 pixels has been removed from here that is from the 100% we are subtracting 200 pixels of the width and this is the way that the width of a particular div container or any other HTML element can be set by using the Kelsey math function over here guys apart from this let us say if we want to remove more 100 pixels from the right so what we can do is from the 100% of the width we want to remove 300 pixels from here so simply we have to minus the 300 pixels let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see 300 pixels is removed from the 100% of the width of this particular div container and in this way you can provide the mathematical expression in inside the parenthesis of this math function that is kelc now guys apart from this we also have the max function over here which uses the largest value so we will be providing the comma separated list of values from which the largest value will be used in order to set the property value in this case so guys let us check this as well so what we will do is instead of using the Kelsey math function we will use the max math function over here and inside this let us say we only provide one value that is 300 pixels over here so so guys what will happen so in this case since the largest value is 300 pixels because that is the only value that is present right now inside the max math function so that is what is going to be set as the value for this particular width of the container so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is the 300 pixels width of the diff container if we right click over here and click on the inspect option we will be able to see the width of the container over here as you can see the content is 300 * by 180 so over here 300 is the width of this particular Dev element right now so guys in this way you can use the max function with just one value and apart from this let us say we also want to provide another value that is 50% of the entire width of the screen so guys over here we have to provide comma followed by 50% so guys this is another value over here so currently 300 pixels is this much on the screen that you can see and when we say 50% it will be at the center of the screen where the right hand side of the div element must be present so Guys Somewhere over here the right hand side of the div element should occur when we apply these changes over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the 50% of the width of the screen is being taken right now and the border is present at the center of the page over here as far as horizontal alignment is concerned so guys out of 300 pixels and 50% 50% is greater right now and that is what is being set as the value of the width CSS property now guys apart from this let us say we also have 70% as the width So currently 70% of the width will be the highest number over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so 70% is being set as the width of the div container so in this way you can also use the max math function inside the CSS for any of the CSS properties that you want to use the mathematical expression for now guys similarly we will have the Min function as well which uses the smallest value from the comma separated list of values as the property value so guys let us check this as well so out of all these three values that we have provided 70% is the largest value and that is what we have seen over here that is 70% of the width is getting implemented right now for this div container what if we provide the minan function for the same list of values so in this case the minimum value will be 300 pixels because that is the smallest value out of all these three values and that is what should be set as the width for this particular div container so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page notice that we have provided the Min function over here instead of Max function so when we reload this page as you can see the minimum value which is 300 pixels out of all these list of values will be implemented as the width of the div container when we right click and click on the inspect option you can see that the 300 pixels that is the width is being set for this particular HTML element apart from this we can also reduce the width so let's say we provide another value is 200 pixels So currently 200 pixels is the smallest value out of all these values that we can see right now so when we save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see 200 pixels is being set as the width of the HTML element and instead of using Min we can also use max function in this case let me just save this file now so currently 70% will be set as the width of the div element so when we reload this page as you can see this is the 70% of the screen that is being taken by this HTML element so guys comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to the channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is rounded Corners in CSS so stay tuned
