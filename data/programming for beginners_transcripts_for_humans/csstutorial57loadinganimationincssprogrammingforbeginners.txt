With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see a simple loading
00:02 - animation in CSS with the help of
00:04 - example over here so guys let us move to
00:06 - the vs code in this case and simply we
00:08 - are going to remove the previous lines
00:10 - of code that we had written in the HTML
00:13 - and the CSS files over here now guys we
00:15 - need to create a diff tag that will help
00:18 - us in order to create a circle with the
00:21 - help of the Border CSS property and then
00:24 - we are going to rotate the diff tag in
00:26 - order to create a simple loading
00:28 - animation with the help of C CSS
00:30 - properties so guys first of all we will
00:32 - provide the diff tag with the help of
00:34 - the loading CSS class over here so
00:37 - basically we have used the diff tag with
00:39 - the class name that is loading in this
00:41 - case and simply we are going to use this
00:43 - class name over here inside the style.
00:46 - CSS file so guys we are going to paste
00:48 - this class name with the help of the dot
00:51 - character over here so that we can
00:52 - provide certain CSS properties for this
00:55 - diff tag so first of all we will provide
00:57 - the withd S 200 pixels in this case and
01:00 - also the height of 200 pixels so that we
01:03 - get a square box out of this diff tag
01:05 - over here and then apart from this we
01:07 - will also provide certain background
01:09 - color to the body tag over here so let's
01:12 - say we have a dark background color in
01:14 - this case so we have provided the dark
01:16 - background color and let's see the color
01:18 - of the text is white over here now guys
01:20 - apart from this we also want the
01:22 - background color of this diff tag to be
01:24 - displayed so let's say we have the
01:26 - background color for the diff tag as
01:28 - white color in this case and then apart
01:30 - from this let us get this div tag at the
01:33 - center of the screen so simply we are
01:35 - going to provide the margin CSS property
01:38 - with the value as Auto over here now
01:40 - guys let me just save this file now and
01:42 - try reloading this page once again on
01:44 - the browser so as you can see this is
01:46 - the diff tag that we have included on
01:48 - the HTML file now guys we are going to
01:50 - make a circle out of this diff tag so
01:53 - how do we do that so first of all we
01:55 - will provide the Border radius over here
01:57 - which should be 50% in order to make the
02:01 - diff tag as a circular diff tag over
02:03 - here let me just save this file now and
02:05 - try reloading this page so as you can
02:07 - see with the help of this border radius
02:09 - equal to 50% we have converted the
02:12 - square box to a circle over here now
02:14 - guys we only want the border of the
02:16 - circle to be displayed so what we will
02:18 - do is simply I'm going to comment out
02:20 - this background color in this case and
02:22 - let's say we provide the Border as 10
02:25 - pixels with the color that is white and
02:28 - the Border style will be solid in this
02:29 - this case so guys basically we have
02:31 - provided the 10 pixels solid white color
02:34 - border over here instead of the
02:36 - background color so let me just save
02:38 - this file now and try reloading this
02:40 - page so as you can see we have provided
02:41 - the Border over here for this particular
02:44 - Circle let us increase the width of the
02:46 - border to 20 pixels so that we can see
02:48 - the loading animation properly so as you
02:51 - can see this is the circle that we have
02:52 - drawn over here and this is just the
02:54 - border that we have included now guys
02:56 - simply we can rotate this circle in
02:58 - order to see the simple loading
03:00 - animation and in order to do that we
03:03 - need to have one side of the Border have
03:05 - a different color so what we will do is
03:07 - we will divide this values for the
03:10 - Border CSS property so first of all we
03:12 - will say border width of 20 pixels that
03:15 - we had defined and then the Border style
03:18 - should be solid so over here we will
03:20 - Define the Border style as solid in this
03:22 - case and then guys for the Border color
03:24 - we will provide the color as white so
03:27 - simply we will say border color in this
03:30 - case so all these are CSS properties
03:33 - that you can Define separately let me
03:35 - just save this file now and try
03:36 - reloading this page so as you can see
03:38 - there is no change right now we want the
03:41 - top border to be of the different color
03:43 - so simply we will Define the first color
03:46 - which will be corresponding to the top
03:48 - border over here as gray color so let's
03:50 - say we provide the gray color as the
03:52 - value for the top border and then for
03:54 - the left and right border we want the
03:57 - white color and then for the bottom side
03:59 - we also want the white color to be
04:01 - displayed so guys basically the first
04:03 - border color will be top color followed
04:05 - by the right hand side and Then followed
04:07 - by the bottom side and then we have the
04:09 - left hand side so over here the gray
04:10 - color will be at the top side and then
04:13 - this white color will be at the right
04:15 - side followed by the white color at the
04:17 - bottom side and then again since we have
04:19 - not provided the fourth color the left
04:21 - color will be taken from this particular
04:23 - white color over here let me just save
04:25 - this file now and try reloading this
04:27 - page once again on the browser so as you
04:29 - can you can see this is the gray color
04:31 - at the top of the circle over here now
04:33 - guys simply we want to rotate this
04:35 - circle with the help of the animation so
04:37 - what we will do is we will simply Define
04:40 - the key frames over here and then we
04:42 - will say loading as the name of the
04:44 - animation so what we want to do is
04:47 - simply at the 0% we are going to provide
04:50 - the CSS property that is transform over
04:52 - here and simply we are going to say
04:54 - rotate and initially it should be 0° in
04:57 - this case and then after this for the
04:59 - 100 % what we are going to do is we are
05:02 - going to Define this as 100% over here
05:04 - we are going to still use the transform
05:06 - CSS property and this time we want to
05:09 - rotate it by 360° over here so guys as
05:12 - you can see we are going from 0° to 360
05:15 - Dee as far as rotation of the HTML
05:18 - element is concerned and now guys we are
05:21 - going to link this animation to the diff
05:24 - tag over here so basically for this
05:26 - particular block of CSS properties we
05:29 - are going to provide the animation name
05:31 - over here so simply we are going to
05:33 - provide the loading that is the
05:35 - animation name we have provided in this
05:37 - case after the key frames keyword and
05:39 - also we need to provide the animation
05:41 - duration which we can say 2 seconds in
05:44 - this case so guys basically within 2
05:46 - seconds the animation should complete
05:48 - let me just save this file now and try
05:50 - reload this page once again on the
05:52 - browser so as you can see the circle is
05:55 - rotating itself and only once it has
05:57 - rotated itself so guys basically we can
05:59 - also use the iteration count as well for
06:02 - the animation so over here we will say
06:04 - iteration count equal to infinite so
06:07 - that it loads infinite number of times
06:09 - so let me just reload this page so as
06:11 - you can see the diff element that is the
06:14 - circle is rotating itself continuously
06:17 - within the span of 2 seconds over here
06:19 - now guys if you notice the speed of the
06:21 - animation is decreasing at the end of
06:23 - the animation over here so what we can
06:25 - do is simply we can provide the speed as
06:28 - linear in this case so we need to use
06:30 - the animation timing function in which
06:32 - case we are going to provide the value
06:34 - as linear so let me just save this file
06:36 - now and try reload this page once again
06:39 - on the browser so as you can see the
06:40 - speed of the loading icon is linear over
06:43 - here and this is the way that you can
06:45 - easily create the loading animation icon
06:48 - with the help of the HTML and the CSS
06:51 - properties so guys comment in the

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see a simple loading animation in CSS with the help of example over here so guys let us move to the vs code in this case and simply we are going to remove the previous lines of code that we had written in the HTML and the CSS files over here now guys we need to create a diff tag that will help us in order to create a circle with the help of the Border CSS property and then we are going to rotate the diff tag in order to create a simple loading animation with the help of C CSS properties so guys first of all we will provide the diff tag with the help of the loading CSS class over here so basically we have used the diff tag with the class name that is loading in this case and simply we are going to use this class name over here inside the style. CSS file so guys we are going to paste this class name with the help of the dot character over here so that we can provide certain CSS properties for this diff tag so first of all we will provide the withd S 200 pixels in this case and also the height of 200 pixels so that we get a square box out of this diff tag over here and then apart from this we will also provide certain background color to the body tag over here so let's say we have a dark background color in this case so we have provided the dark background color and let's see the color of the text is white over here now guys apart from this we also want the background color of this diff tag to be displayed so let's say we have the background color for the diff tag as white color in this case and then apart from this let us get this div tag at the center of the screen so simply we are going to provide the margin CSS property with the value as Auto over here now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is the diff tag that we have included on the HTML file now guys we are going to make a circle out of this diff tag so how do we do that so first of all we will provide the Border radius over here which should be 50% in order to make the diff tag as a circular diff tag over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see with the help of this border radius equal to 50% we have converted the square box to a circle over here now guys we only want the border of the circle to be displayed so what we will do is simply I'm going to comment out this background color in this case and let's say we provide the Border as 10 pixels with the color that is white and the Border style will be solid in this this case so guys basically we have provided the 10 pixels solid white color border over here instead of the background color so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see we have provided the Border over here for this particular Circle let us increase the width of the border to 20 pixels so that we can see the loading animation properly so as you can see this is the circle that we have drawn over here and this is just the border that we have included now guys simply we can rotate this circle in order to see the simple loading animation and in order to do that we need to have one side of the Border have a different color so what we will do is we will divide this values for the Border CSS property so first of all we will say border width of 20 pixels that we had defined and then the Border style should be solid so over here we will Define the Border style as solid in this case and then guys for the Border color we will provide the color as white so simply we will say border color in this case so all these are CSS properties that you can Define separately let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see there is no change right now we want the top border to be of the different color so simply we will Define the first color which will be corresponding to the top border over here as gray color so let's say we provide the gray color as the value for the top border and then for the left and right border we want the white color and then for the bottom side we also want the white color to be displayed so guys basically the first border color will be top color followed by the right hand side and Then followed by the bottom side and then we have the left hand side so over here the gray color will be at the top side and then this white color will be at the right side followed by the white color at the bottom side and then again since we have not provided the fourth color the left color will be taken from this particular white color over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can you can see this is the gray color at the top of the circle over here now guys simply we want to rotate this circle with the help of the animation so what we will do is we will simply Define the key frames over here and then we will say loading as the name of the animation so what we want to do is simply at the 0% we are going to provide the CSS property that is transform over here and simply we are going to say rotate and initially it should be 0° in this case and then after this for the 100 % what we are going to do is we are going to Define this as 100% over here we are going to still use the transform CSS property and this time we want to rotate it by 360° over here so guys as you can see we are going from 0° to 360 Dee as far as rotation of the HTML element is concerned and now guys we are going to link this animation to the diff tag over here so basically for this particular block of CSS properties we are going to provide the animation name over here so simply we are going to provide the loading that is the animation name we have provided in this case after the key frames keyword and also we need to provide the animation duration which we can say 2 seconds in this case so guys basically within 2 seconds the animation should complete let me just save this file now and try reload this page once again on the browser so as you can see the circle is rotating itself and only once it has rotated itself so guys basically we can also use the iteration count as well for the animation so over here we will say iteration count equal to infinite so that it loads infinite number of times so let me just reload this page so as you can see the
