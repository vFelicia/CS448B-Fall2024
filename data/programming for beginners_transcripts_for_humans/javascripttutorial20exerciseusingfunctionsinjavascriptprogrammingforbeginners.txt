00:00 - so now we will work on an exercise using
00:02 - the functions in JavaScript so guys
00:04 - basically you have to follow the below
00:06 - steps in order to complete this exercise
00:09 - on functions in JavaScript so let us
00:11 - start with the first task over here so
00:14 - basically you have to create the
00:15 - function with the name add in this case
00:18 - taking two parameters that is a and b so
00:21 - guys you can pause this video and
00:23 - practice on your own and complete this
00:25 - task one by one and if you are getting
00:27 - stuck anywhere then you can check how I
00:29 - am doing on the screen so guys basically
00:31 - let us move to the vs code over here so
00:33 - first of all we will use the function
00:36 - keyword in order to define the function
00:38 - with the name add in this case and then
00:40 - we will provide two parameters inside
00:42 - the open and close parenthesis so let us
00:45 - provide the parameters that is a and b
00:47 - over here and then after this we are
00:50 - going to provide the open and close
00:51 - curly braces so guys we need to
00:54 - calculate the addition of A and B and
00:57 - return the result over here so what we
00:59 - will do is let us provide the variable
01:01 - that is sum in this case and then it is
01:03 - equal to a + b over here so basically we
01:06 - are just adding these two numbers that
01:09 - will be passed as parameters during the
01:11 - function call with the help of the
01:12 - function name that is add in this case
01:15 - so guys basically A+ B will be assigned
01:17 - to the sum variable over here and then
01:20 - we have to return this sum so basically
01:22 - we are going to use the return statement
01:24 - in this case and we are returning the
01:26 - sum variable over here and then after
01:29 - this we need need to call this function
01:31 - five times with different parameter
01:33 - values so guys let us call this function
01:35 - five times over here so before calling
01:37 - the function five times we need to
01:39 - display the results of all calls to
01:41 - function with proper statements to be
01:43 - displayed on Console so guys over here
01:46 - let us provide the proper statements
01:47 - inside the console.log statement so what
01:50 - we will do is simply we will say result
01:53 - of addition of two numbers is and then
01:58 - we have to provide dollar symbol and
02:00 - then inside the open and close curly
02:01 - braces simply we are going to call the
02:04 - add function in this case with two
02:06 - parameters so let us say the first
02:08 - function call is having two numbers that
02:10 - is 1 comma 2 in this case so let me just
02:13 - save this file now and try running this
02:15 - code on the terminal so simply we will
02:17 - say node followed by the name of the
02:18 - Javascript file that is test.js so as
02:21 - you can see result of addition of two
02:24 - numbers is three in this case since we
02:26 - have provided the two numbers as one and
02:28 - two so similarly we will call this
02:30 - function five times over here with the
02:32 - help of the required string that we have
02:35 - provided inside the string literal so
02:37 - guys over here what we will do is let us
02:39 - provide some other parameters so let's
02:41 - say we provide 5 and four and then we
02:44 - provide 10 and then 12 in this case and
02:47 - then for the fourth call let us provide
02:49 - 8 followed by 12 in this case and then
02:52 - in the end let's say we provide 10 and
02:54 - then we provide 23 in this case so guys
02:57 - let us see what will be the output of
02:59 - all the these additions of numbers so
03:01 - let me just save this file now and try
03:03 - running this code once again over here
03:05 - on the terminal so as you can see 1 + 2
03:08 - it is equal to 3 over here then 5 + 4 it
03:11 - is equal to 9 and then 10 + 12 it is
03:14 - equal to 22 and Then followed by 8 + 12
03:17 - it is equal to 20 and then 10 + 23 it is
03:21 - equal to 33 over here so guys whatever
03:24 - numbers we have provided to this add
03:26 - function it was successfully able to
03:29 - find the sum of both the numbers that
03:31 - were provided as parameters to the add
03:33 - function in this case so basically we
03:35 - have completed all the four task inside
03:38 - this particular exercise now the last
03:40 - task is to convert the function to an
03:43 - arrow function over here now guys in
03:45 - order to convert this regular function
03:47 - into an arrow function simply we have to
03:49 - remove the function keyword over here
03:52 - and we have to define the variable that
03:54 - is add in this case so simply we say let
03:57 - as the keyword in this case and Then
03:59 - followed by by the name of the function
04:01 - that is ADD over here followed by equal
04:03 - to operator and then guys inside the
04:06 - open and close parenthesis we are taking
04:08 - the two parameters that is a and b in
04:10 - this case and then after this we need to
04:13 - provide the combination of characters
04:15 - that is equal to and the greater than
04:17 - symbol so guys basically this is nothing
04:19 - but the arrow function over here and
04:21 - then after this we have the open and
04:23 - close curly braces inside which we are
04:25 - going to have the lines of code that is
04:28 - going to complete certain operation that
04:30 - is addition of two numbers in this case
04:33 - so guys let me just save this file now
04:35 - and try running this code once again on
04:36 - the terminal to see whether the output
04:39 - that we are getting is same as compared
04:41 - to the previous output so let me just
04:43 - run this code once again as you can see
04:45 - we are getting the sum of all these
04:47 - numbers that we had entered on the
04:49 - console. log statement now guys since we
04:51 - are only returning a plus b over here we
04:54 - can make this function definition more
04:56 - shorter over here so what we have to do
04:58 - is simply I'm going to return a plus b
05:00 - in this case so I'm going to remove the
05:03 - sum variable over here and then after
05:05 - the curly braces we have A+ B and simply
05:08 - we can use the return statement as well
05:11 - and then close this curly braces in this
05:13 - case and remove this particular lines of
05:15 - code so guys over here as you can see we
05:17 - are simply returning a plus b which is
05:19 - the sum of these two numbers which are
05:21 - getting passed as the parameters to this
05:23 - Arrow function so let me just save this
05:25 - file now and try running this code once
05:27 - again over here on the terminal so as
05:30 - you can see we are getting the same
05:31 - result over here now guys again we can
05:33 - remove the return statement as well
05:35 - since it is only having one line of code
05:38 - over here so guys always remember when
05:40 - we are having the arrow function if you
05:42 - just have one line of code to be
05:44 - executed then return statement is not
05:47 - required automatically the value of this
05:49 - particular expression will be returned
05:51 - so simply I'm going to remove this
05:53 - return statement and also these curly
05:55 - braces are not required when you are not
05:57 - using the return statement in this case
05:59 - case so as you can see we are simply
06:01 - passing A and B as the parameters to the
06:03 - arrow function and returning the
06:06 - expression that is a plus b which is
06:08 - going to return the value of the
06:10 - addition of these two numbers over here
06:12 - for all the console. log statements so
06:15 - let me just save this file now and try
06:17 - running this code once again over here
06:18 - on the terminal so as you can see we are
06:21 - getting all these results as the sum of
06:23 - the two numbers that we are passing with
06:25 - the help of the add Arrow function over
06:28 - here so guys what will be the out when
06:29 - we call the add function with the two
06:31 - numbers that is 5 and six over here so
06:34 - what will be the sum of these two
06:36 - numbers when this particular add
06:38 - function will be called so comment in
06:40 - the comment section below let us see
06:41 - whether your answer is correct or not
06:43 - please make sure that you like this
06:44 - video so that it reaches to more people
06:47 - and subscribe to the channel so that you
06:48 - get the notifications on upcoming videos
06:51 - as well I'll see you in the next video
06:53 - in which we are going to talk about
06:54 - break and continue statements in
06:56 - JavaScript so stay tuned

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will work on an exercise using the functions in JavaScript so guys basically you have to follow the below steps in order to complete this exercise on functions in JavaScript so let us start with the first task over here so basically you have to create the function with the name add in this case taking two parameters that is a and b so guys you can pause this video and practice on your own and complete this task one by one and if you are getting stuck anywhere then you can check how I am doing on the screen so guys basically let us move to the vs code over here so first of all we will use the function keyword in order to define the function with the name add in this case and then we will provide two parameters inside the open and close parenthesis so let us provide the parameters that is a and b over here and then after this we are going to provide the open and close curly braces so guys we need to calculate the addition of A and B and return the result over here so what we will do is let us provide the variable that is sum in this case and then it is equal to a + b over here so basically we are just adding these two numbers that will be passed as parameters during the function call with the help of the function name that is add in this case so guys basically A+ B will be assigned to the sum variable over here and then we have to return this sum so basically we are going to use the return statement in this case and we are returning the sum variable over here and then after this we need need to call this function five times with different parameter values so guys let us call this function five times over here so before calling the function five times we need to display the results of all calls to function with proper statements to be displayed on Console so guys over here let us provide the proper statements inside the console.log statement so what we will do is simply we will say result of addition of two numbers is and then we have to provide dollar symbol and then inside the open and close curly braces simply we are going to call the add function in this case with two parameters so let us say the first function call is

here with the help of the required string that we have provided inside the string literal so guys over here what we will do is let us provide some other parameters so let's say we provide 5 and four and then we provide 10 and then 12 in this case and then for the fourth call let us provide 8 followed by 12 in this case and then in the end let's say we provide 10 and then we provide 23 in this case so guys let us see what will be the output of all the these additions of numbers so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here on the terminal so as you can see 1 + 2 it is equal to 3 over here then 5 + 4 it is equal to 9 and then 10 + 12 it is equal to 22 and Then followed by 8 + 12 it is equal to 20 and then 10 + 23 it is equal to 33 over here so guys whatever numbers we have provided to this add function it was successfully able to find the sum of both the numbers that were provided as parameters to the add function in this case so basically we have completed all the four task inside this particular exercise now the last task is to convert the function to an arrow function over here now guys in order to convert this regular function into an arrow function simply we have to remove the function keyword over here and we have to define the variable that is add in this case so simply we say let as the keyword in this case and Then followed by by the name of the function that is ADD over here followed by equal to operator and then guys inside the open and close parenthesis we are taking the two parameters that is a and b in this case and then after this we need to provide the combination of characters that is equal to and the greater than symbol so guys basically this is nothing but the arrow function over here and then after this we have the open and close curly braces inside which we are going to have the lines of code that is going to complete certain operation that is addition of two numbers in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code once again on the terminal to see whether the output that we are getting is same as compared to the previous output so let me just run this code once again as you can see we are getting the sum of all these numbers that we had entered on the console. log statement now guys since we are only returning a plus b over here we can make this function definition more shorter over here so what we have to do is simply I'm going to return a plus b in this case so I'm going to remove the sum variable over here and then after the curly braces we have A+ B and simply we can use the return statement as well and then close this curly braces in this case and remove this particular lines of code so guys over here as you can see we are simply returning a plus b which is the sum of these two numbers which are getting passed as the parameters to this Arrow function so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here on the terminal so as you can see we are getting the same result over here now guys again we can remove the return statement as well since it is only having one line of code over here so guys always remember when we are having the arrow function if you just have one line of code to be executed then return statement is not required automatically the value of this particular expression will be returned so simply I'm going to remove this return statement and also these curly braces are not required when you are not using the return statement in this case case so as you can see we are simply passing A and B as the parameters to the arrow function and returning the expression that is a plus b which is going to return the value of the addition of these two numbers over here for all the console. log statements so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here on the terminal so as you can see we are getting all these results as the sum of the two numbers that we are passing with the help of the add Arrow function over here so guys what will be the out when we call the add function with the two numbers that is 5 and six over here so what will be the sum of these two numbers when this particular add function will be called so comment in the comment section below let us see whether your answer is correct or not please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to the channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well I'll see you in the next video in which we are going to talk about break and continue statements in JavaScript so stay tuned
