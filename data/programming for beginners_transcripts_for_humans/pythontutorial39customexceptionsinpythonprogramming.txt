00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to learn
00:03 - about custom exceptions in Python
00:06 - Programming so guys in Python we can
00:08 - Define custom exceptions by creating a
00:10 - new class that is derived from the
00:12 - built-in exception class so guys that we
00:15 - are going to check with the help of
00:16 - examples as well as you can see this is
00:18 - the syntax we have the class keyword
00:21 - followed by the space character and then
00:23 - we have the name of the exception that
00:25 - we want to create which is going to be
00:27 - the user defined exception and this is
00:29 - the way that we inherit another class
00:31 - inside the parenthesis after the user
00:34 - defined name we have the exception class
00:36 - name so guys whatever attributes and
00:38 - behaviors that are present inside the
00:40 - exception will get inherited to this
00:43 - custom error user defined exception over
00:46 - here and then we can have a statement
00:47 - over here inside this custom error as to
00:50 - why this error is being raised over here
00:52 - and then followed by the pass keyword
00:54 - and then guys we can have our own code
00:56 - that is the try and accept block and
00:59 - then inside the driveway block based on
01:00 - the conditions we can raise this custom
01:02 - error based on our requirements and once
01:05 - it is raised it will be handled by using
01:07 - the accept keyword over here followed by
01:09 - the custom error exception and then we
01:12 - can have the block of code in order to
01:13 - handle the exception so guys let us
01:15 - check this with the help of example now
01:17 - over here first of all we are going to
01:19 - have the user defined exceptions over
01:21 - here let's say we have the class and the
01:23 - exception that we are going to have is
01:26 - let's say we are having the voting
01:28 - application and we have to check whether
01:30 - a particular person is having the H that
01:33 - is greater than 18 if the age is less
01:35 - than 18 and the person is not eligible
01:37 - to vote then we are going to call this
01:39 - particular exception that we are going
01:41 - to Define so we are going to Simply name
01:43 - the exception as the age error over here
01:46 - so we have age error and then it should
01:49 - inherit the exception class so over here
01:52 - we are going to say exception and Then
01:54 - followed by colon and then we can simply
01:56 - say raise when person a is less than 18
02:02 - so if the person age is less than 18 he
02:05 - or she is not eligible to vote and this
02:07 - is the exception that is going to be
02:09 - raised so over here we are going to have
02:12 - the pass statement and now guys what we
02:14 - will do is we will have our lines of
02:16 - code over here inside the dry blocks
02:18 - over here we will ask the user in order
02:21 - to enter the age so over here we will
02:24 - have age variable it is equal to we are
02:27 - going to take the input from the user
02:29 - and it says enter page and then we have
02:32 - colon and then what we will do is we
02:35 - will check if this age is less than 18
02:37 - so we will simply say if age is less
02:41 - than 18 followed by colon if the entered
02:44 - age is less than 18 we have to raise
02:46 - this age error exception so I'll just
02:49 - copy this and paste this over here first
02:51 - of all we have to use the erase keyword
02:53 - followed by the age error over here so
02:56 - basically if age is less than 18 then we
02:59 - have to raise the age adder and then
03:01 - what we can do is we can catch that
03:03 - error over here inside the accept block
03:05 - so accept the block followed by the age
03:08 - error over here and then we have the
03:10 - colon and then we can simply say print
03:12 - and over here person is not eligible to
03:17 - vote so guys this is a statement that is
03:19 - going to be printed when the age is less
03:21 - than 18 but what if the age is not less
03:24 - than 18 and if it is greater than 18 so
03:27 - the person is eligible to vote so what
03:29 - we will do is we can have the else part
03:31 - over here which will get executed when
03:33 - this exception is not occurring inside
03:35 - the drive log so over here we can simply
03:38 - provide the print statement and we will
03:40 - say person is eligible to vote now guys
03:46 - this statement we can also have inside
03:47 - the try block as well we can also have
03:50 - after this if statement we can have the
03:52 - else part and the same print statement
03:55 - over here so it depends on you how you
03:56 - want to structure your code this is
03:58 - another way in order to provide by the
04:00 - else part and this will be executed only
04:02 - when there is no exception that is
04:04 - occurring inside the dry block and then
04:06 - optionally you can also have the finally
04:08 - block as well which will help you to
04:10 - execute certain lines of code
04:11 - irrespective whether the exception has
04:14 - occurred inside the dry block or not so
04:16 - guys let me just save this file now and
04:18 - try running this code now so it says
04:20 - enter it so let's say we provide the
04:21 - ages 23 over here and then when we press
04:24 - enter it says less than not supported
04:27 - between instances of strn and so guys by
04:30 - default whenever we take any input from
04:33 - the user it takes the input as the
04:35 - string so basically this age data type
04:37 - string right now we want to convert it
04:39 - to the integer so we can simply convert
04:41 - this string into integer over here we
04:44 - can provide the end and inside the
04:45 - parenthesis we can take the entire input
04:48 - over here so guys let me just save this
04:50 - file now and try running this code once
04:51 - again we will provide the hs23 and when
04:54 - we press enter it says person is
04:57 - eligible to vote so basically what we
04:59 - have done over here is we have converted
05:01 - the string data type to the integer data
05:03 - type by enclosing this entire input by
05:06 - the end and now let us run this code
05:08 - once again now so that we can catch this
05:10 - exception when the age is less than 18.
05:12 - so guys let's say when the age is 17
05:15 - over here in which case the age is less
05:17 - than 18 right now when we press enter it
05:20 - says person is not eligible to vote so
05:23 - what has happened over here is since the
05:25 - age was less than 18 the raise age error
05:28 - has helped us in order to throw this
05:31 - exception that is the age error and what
05:33 - has happened is the control flow has
05:35 - come over here to this accept block and
05:37 - it printed this line of code that is
05:39 - person is not eligible to vote so that
05:42 - is the same string that is getting
05:43 - printed over here person is not eligible
05:45 - to vote and previously it was trending
05:48 - this statement that this person is
05:49 - eligible to vote when the age was
05:51 - greater than or equal to 18. now guys
05:54 - when the age is 18 Again the person will
05:56 - be eligible to vote that's because the
05:58 - condition that we have given one over
06:00 - here in order to raise the error is age
06:03 - less than 18 so let us check that once
06:05 - again over here when we run this code
06:07 - once again when we say 18 as the age it
06:10 - says person is eligible to vote so the
06:12 - person will be not eligible to vote only
06:15 - when the age is less than 18 and not
06:18 - equal to 18. so guys this is the way
06:20 - that we can create our own user defined
06:22 - custom exception over here and call that
06:25 - Exception by using the raise keyword
06:27 - inside the try block and catch that
06:30 - exception using the accept block over
06:32 - here and handle it accordingly based on
06:34 - our requirements so guys practice on
06:36 - your own so that on different inputs you
06:38 - get different outputs please make sure
06:40 - that you like this video so that it
06:41 - reaches to more people and subscribe to
06:43 - the channel so that you get the
06:45 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
06:46 - the next video that we are going to talk
06:48 - about is object oriented programming in
06:51 - Python that is we are going to check the
06:53 - classes and objects so stay tuned

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about custom exceptions in Python Programming so guys in Python we can Define custom exceptions by creating a new class that is derived from the builtin exception class so guys that we are going to check with the help of examples as well as you can see this is the syntax we have the class keyword followed by the space

after the user defined name we have the exception class name so guys whatever attributes and behaviors that are present inside the exception will get inherited to this custom error user defined exception over here and then we can have a statement over here inside this custom error as to why this error is being raised over here and then followed by the pass keyword and then guys we can have our own code that is the try and accept block and then inside the driveway block based on the conditions we can raise this custom error based on our requirements and once it is raised it will be handled by using the accept keyword over here followed by the custom error exception and then we can have the block of code in order to handle the exception so guys let us check this with the help of example now over here first of all we are going to have the user defined exceptions over here let's say we have the class and the exception that we are going to have is let's say we are having the voting application and we have to check whether a particular person is having the H that is greater than 18 if the age is less than 18 and the person is not eligible to vote then we are going to call this particular exception that we are going to Define so we are going to Simply name the exception as the age error over here so we have age error and then it should inherit the exception class so over here we are going to say exception and Then followed by colon and then we can simply say raise when person a is less than 18 so if the person age is less than 18 he or she is not eligible to vote and this is the exception that is going to be raised so over here we are going to have the pass statement and now guys what we will do is we will have our lines of code over here inside the dry blocks over here we will ask the user in order to enter the age so over here we will have age variable it is equal to we are going to take the input from the user and it says enter page and then we have colon and then what we will do is we will check if this age is less than 18 so we will simply say if age is less than 18 followed by colon if the entered age is less than 18 we have to raise this age error exception so I'll just copy this and paste this over here first of all we have to use the erase keyword followed by the age error over here so basically if age is less than 18 then we have to raise the age adder and then what we can do is we can catch that error over here inside the accept block so accept the block followed by the age error over here and then we have the colon and then we can simply say print and over here person is not eligible to vote so guys this is a statement that is going to be printed when the age is less than 18 but what if the age is not less than 18 and if it is greater than 18 so the person is eligible to vote so what we will do is we can have the else part over here which will get executed when this exception is not occurring inside the drive log so over here we can simply provide the print statement and we will say person is eligible to vote now guys this statement we can also have inside the try block as well we can also have after this if statement we can have the else part and the same print statement over here so it depends on you how you want to structure your code this is another way in order to provide by the else part and this will be executed only when there is no exception that is occurring inside the dry block and then optionally you can also have the finally block as well which will help you to execute certain lines of code irrespective whether the exception has occurred inside the dry block or not so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code now so it says enter it so let's say we provide the ages 23 over here and then when we press enter it says less than not supported between instances of strn and so guys by default whenever we take any input from the user it takes the input as the string so basically this age data type string right now we want to convert it to the integer so we can simply convert this string into integer over here we can provide the end and inside the parenthesis we can take the entire input over here so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code once again we will provide the hs23 and when we press enter it says person is eligible to vote so basically what we have done over here is we have converted the string data type to the integer data type by enclosing this entire input by the end and now let us run this code once again now so that we can catch this exception when the age is less than 18. so guys let's say when the age is 17 over here in which case the age is less than 18 right now when we press enter it says person is not eligible to vote so what has happened over here is since the age was less than 18 the raise age error has helped us in order to throw this exception that is the age error and what has happened is the control flow has come over here to this accept block and it printed this line of code that is person is not eligible to vote so that is the same string that is getting printed over here person is not eligible to vote and previously it was trending this statement that this person is eligible to vote when the age was greater than or equal to 18. now guys when the age is 18 Again the person will be eligible to vote that's because the condition that we have given one over here in order to raise the error is age less than 18 so let us check that once again over here when we run this code once again when we say 18 as the age it says person is eligible to vote so the person will be not eligible to vote only when the age is less than 18 and not equal to 18. so guys this is the way that we can create our own user defined custom exception over here and call that Exception by using the raise keyword inside the try block and catch that exception using the accept block over here and handle it accordingly based on our requirements so guys practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to the channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is object oriented programming in Python that is we are going to
