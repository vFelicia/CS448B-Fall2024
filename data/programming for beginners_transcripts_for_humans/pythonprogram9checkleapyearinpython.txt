00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to check whether the
00:05 - entered year is a leap year so guys
00:07 - basically in this program we will take
00:09 - the year as the input from the user and
00:12 - we will check whether the entered year
00:13 - is a leap year now what is the logic in
00:16 - order to check whether the ear is a leap
00:18 - year so basically a leap year is exactly
00:21 - divisible by 4 except for Century years
00:24 - which is the ears ending with double
00:26 - zero so basically any year that is
00:29 - divisible by 4 and we get the remainder
00:31 - as 0 will be the leap year except the
00:34 - century years now the century here is a
00:37 - leap year only if it is perfectly
00:39 - divisible by 400 so guys what we will be
00:42 - doing is first of all we are going to
00:43 - check whether the entered year is a
00:45 - century year which means whether it is
00:47 - ending with a double zero and if it is a
00:50 - century here we will check whether it is
00:52 - divisible by 400 if so then it is a leap
00:55 - year and if this condition is not
00:57 - satisfied we will check whether the
00:58 - entered year is divisible by 4 and it is
01:01 - not divisible by a century so guys let
01:03 - us write this Python program in vs code
01:05 - so over here what we will be doing is we
01:08 - will take the input from the user and
01:10 - store it inside the ER so it is equal to
01:12 - we take the input and then we say enter
01:15 - the here
01:18 - so user will be entering the year now
01:20 - this input function takes the input from
01:22 - the user as a string data type so we
01:25 - need to convert it into the integer so
01:27 - what we will do is we will provide the
01:28 - end function and enclose the entire
01:31 - input within this open and close
01:33 - parenthesis so over here we have the
01:35 - prefix as the end function now we have
01:38 - the year inside this year variable as
01:40 - the integer so what we have to do is
01:42 - first of all we need to check whether
01:44 - this year is divisible by 100 so over
01:46 - here we will say here percent 100 is it
01:50 - equal to 0 and if yes then we also have
01:54 - to check whether it is divisible by 400
01:56 - so over here we will say end and then
01:59 - again we will say here percent 400 is it
02:03 - equal to 0 this time so guys basically
02:05 - when the year is divisible by 100 and it
02:08 - is also divisible by 400 then it is a
02:11 - leap year so over here we will simply
02:13 - print the statement that is entered year
02:16 - so we say enter third year and then we
02:20 - will also print the ear that is entered
02:22 - by the user and then we will say is a
02:25 - leaf here in this case and Then followed
02:28 - by dot format and then we will provide
02:30 - this year variable inside the format
02:32 - function so guys over here we will get
02:34 - entered year and then the year that is
02:36 - being entered by the user is a leap year
02:39 - for which this condition is satisfied
02:40 - now guys if this condition is not
02:42 - satisfied we will also have to check
02:44 - whether the entered year is divisible by
02:47 - 4 so over here what we will do is we
02:49 - will again provide the alif condition
02:51 - and then we will say here percent 4 is
02:56 - it equal to 0 and then we will also say
02:59 - whether this year percent hundred so we
03:03 - need to check whether year percent
03:04 - hundred is not equal to 0 this time we
03:08 - will say not equal to 0 so it is
03:10 - divisible by 4 but it is not divisible
03:12 - by 100 then also it is a leap year so
03:15 - over here again we will print the same
03:17 - statement that is has entered here is a
03:19 - leap year so I'll just copy this and
03:21 - paste this over here so Guys these are
03:23 - the two conditions first of all if the
03:25 - year is a century ear which means it is
03:27 - divisible by 100 and if it is also
03:29 - divisible by 400 then only it is a leap
03:32 - year and if it is not divisible by 100
03:34 - but it is divisible by 4 then also it is
03:37 - a leap year now guys for all the other
03:40 - conditions the entered year is not a
03:42 - leap year so we will say else in this
03:44 - case and then again we will print the
03:46 - same statement but we will change the
03:48 - labels I'll just copy and paste this
03:50 - over here and then we will say entered
03:52 - here the year will be displayed is not a
03:54 - leap year this time so we will say not a
03:57 - leap year so guys let me just save this
03:59 - file now and try running this code
04:01 - so as you can see user is being asked to
04:03 - enter the ER so we will say 2000 and let
04:06 - us check whether this is the leap year
04:07 - or not so when we press enter as you can
04:10 - see entered year 2000 is a leap year why
04:13 - so so if we check the first condition
04:14 - that is year percent hundred is it equal
04:16 - to 0 yes in this case because 2000 can
04:19 - be divided by 0 over here and also year
04:22 - person 400 is equal to 0 because 2000 is
04:25 - perfectly divisible by 400 this time and
04:27 - that is why we are getting this as a
04:29 - leap year now guys let us run this code
04:31 - once again we will check whether
04:33 - 2022 that is the last year was it a leap
04:36 - year so let's provide 2022 so as you can
04:40 - see entered year 2022 is not a leap year
04:43 - why so because first condition is not
04:45 - satisfying it is not a century here
04:46 - secondly it is not divisible by 4 as
04:49 - well so this condition is also not
04:51 - getting satisfied so the last statement
04:52 - that is remaining is entered here is not
04:55 - a leap year and that is what we are
04:56 - getting now guys let me just run this
04:58 - code once again let us check whether
04:59 - 2020 is a leave here or not so when we
05:02 - press enter as you can see entered year
05:05 - 2020 is a leap year so guys this
05:07 - condition that is year percent 4 is
05:10 - equal to 0 this thing is getting
05:11 - satisfied because 2020 is perfectly
05:14 - divisible by 4 and it is not divisible
05:16 - by 100 and that is why we are getting
05:18 - this that is entered here is a leap year
05:20 - now guys let us check another input so
05:23 - let me just run this code once again we
05:25 - will provide 2016 as the year so guys
05:28 - what will be the output of this whether
05:30 - it is a leap year or not comment in the
05:32 - comment section below as a homework for
05:34 - you so guys you can practice on your own
05:35 - write this code and check for this year
05:38 - that is 2016 whether it is a leap year
05:40 - or not and comment in the comment
05:42 - section below let us see whether your
05:44 - answer is correct or not please make

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to check whether the entered year is a leap year so guys basically in this program we will take the year as the input from the user and we will check whether the entered year is a leap year now what is the logic in order to check whether the ear is a leap year so basically a leap year is exactly divisible by 4 except for Century years which is the ears ending with double zero so basically any year that is divisible by 4 and we get the remainder as 0 will be the leap year except the century years now the century here is a leap year only if it is perfectly divisible by 400 so guys what we will be doing is first of all we are going to check whether the entered year is a century year which means whether it is ending with a double zero and if it is a century here we will check whether it is divisible by 400 if so then it is a leap year and if this condition is not satisfied we will check whether the entered year is divisible by 4 and it is not divisible by a century so guys let us write this Python program in vs code so over here what we will be doing is we will take the input from the user and store it inside the ER so it is equal to we take the input and then we say enter the here so user will be entering the year now this input function takes the input from the user as a string data type so we need to convert it into the integer so what we will do is we will provide the end function and enclose the entire input within this open and close parenthesis so over here we have the prefix as the end function now we have the year inside this year variable as the integer so what we have to do is first of all we need to check whether this year is divisible by 100 so over here we will say here percent 100 is it equal to 0 and if yes then we also have to check whether it is divisible by 400 so over here we will say end and then again we will say here percent 400 is it equal to 0 this time so guys basically when the year is divisible by 100 and it is also divisible by 400 then it is a leap year so over here we will simply print the statement that is entered year so we say enter third year and then we will also print the ear that is entered by the user and then we will say is a leaf here in this case and Then followed by dot format and then we will provide this year variable inside the format function so guys over here we will get entered year and then the year that is being entered by the user is a leap year for which this condition is satisfied now guys if this condition is not satisfied we will also have to check whether the entered year is divisible by 4 so over here what we will do is we will again provide the alif condition and then we will say here percent 4 is it equal to 0 and then we will also say whether this year percent hundred so we need to check whether year percent hundred is not equal to 0 this time we will say not equal to 0 so it is divisible by 4 but it is not divisible by 100 then also it is a leap year so over here again we will print the same statement that is has entered here is a leap year so I'll just copy this and paste this over here so Guys these are the two conditions first of all if the year is a century ear which means it is divisible by 100 and if it is also divisible by 400 then only it is a leap year and if it is not divisible by 100 but it is divisible by 4 then also it is a leap year now guys for all the other conditions the entered year is not a leap year so we will say else in this case and then again we will print the same statement but we will change the labels I'll just copy and paste this over here and then we will say entered here the year will be displayed is not a leap year this time so we will say not a leap year so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see user is being asked to enter the ER so we will say 2000 and let us check whether this is the leap year or not so when we press enter as you can see entered year 2000 is a leap year why so so if we check the first condition that is year percent hundred is it equal to 0 yes in this case because 2000 can be divided by 0 over here and also year person 400 is equal to 0 because 2000 is perfectly divisible by 400 this time and that is why we are getting this as a leap year now guys let us run this code once again we will check whether 2022 that is the last year was it a leap year so let's provide 2022 so as you can see entered year 2022 is not a leap year why so because first condition is not satisfying it is not a century here secondly it is not divisible by 4 as well so this condition is also not getting satisfied so the last statement that is remaining is entered here is not a leap year and that is what we are getting now guys let me just run this code once again let us check whether 2020 is a leave here or not so when we press enter as you can see entered year 2020 is a leap year so guys this condition that is year percent 4 is equal to 0 this thing is getting satisfied because 2020 is perfectly divisible by 4 and it is not divisible by 100 and that is why we are getting this that is entered here is a leap year now guys let us check another input so let me just run this code once again we will provide 2016 as the year so guys what will be the output of this whether it is a leap year or not comment in the comment section below as a homework for you so guys you can practice on your own write this code and check for this year that is 2016 whether it is a leap year or not and comment in the comment section below let us see whether your answer is correct or not please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe
