03:34 - registration so simply we provide the
03:36 - button tag over here and also we will
03:38 - provide the class as register over here
03:41 - so this is the button tag with the class
03:43 - register and also we will have the text
03:46 - that is register for this particular
03:48 - button let me just save this file now
03:50 - and start the server so that we can see
03:52 - the changes on the web page so guys as
03:54 - you can see these are all the input
03:55 - Fields by default that are getting
03:57 - displayed over here we have not provided
04:00 - any CSS properties so far so guys
04:02 - basically we are going to provide the
04:04 - CSS properties one by one in order to
04:07 - make this registration form look more
04:09 - attractive so guys what we will do is
04:11 - inside the style. CSS file first of all
04:14 - we will make use of this class name that
04:16 - is container over here so we simply
04:18 - provide dot followed by the container
04:20 - class and then we will have the width of
04:23 - 30% so let's say we have the width of
04:25 - 30% over here also we will provide
04:28 - certain background color so let's say we
04:30 - have this light version of green color
04:32 - as the background color this time so let
04:35 - me just save this file now as you can
04:37 - see we have this light version of the
04:39 - green color as the background color over
04:41 - here apart from this we will also set
04:43 - the display it is equal to flex and
04:45 - since all the flex items must be present
04:48 - in a column so basically we will set the
04:50 - flex direction as column over here so
04:53 - when we save this file now as you can
04:55 - see these are all the flex items that
04:57 - are displayed right now now guys apart
04:59 - from this we also want to set the
05:01 - padding as well so simply we will keep
05:03 - the padding as 20 pixels and also we
05:06 - will provide certain border radius over
05:08 - here so we provide the Border radius of
05:10 - 20 pixels once again we will provide the
05:13 - Box Shadow so over here we will provide
05:16 - 10 pixels of blur effect with the color
05:18 - that is black color over here when we
05:20 - save this file now as you can see this
05:22 - is the registration form that is getting
05:24 - displayed this time now guys apart from
05:26 - this we also want the margin it is equal
05:28 - to auto so that we can get the
05:31 - registration form at the center of the
05:33 - screen over here as far as the
05:34 - horizontal alignment is concerned so as
05:36 - you can see this is a very simple
05:38 - registration form that the user can use
05:41 - in order to register himself or herself
05:43 - now guys after this let us provide
05:45 - certain CSS properties for these input
05:48 - Fields over here so simply we are going
05:50 - to make use of this class name that is
05:52 - input hyphen field so let me just copy
05:55 - this class name and then inside the
05:57 - style. CSS file we will make use of this
05:59 - class name over here first of all let us
06:02 - provide certain padding so let's say we
06:04 - have the padding of 10 pixels over here
06:06 - also we have the Border radius of 10
06:09 - pixels let me just save this file now as
06:12 - you can see this is the way that the
06:13 - registration form is getting displayed
06:15 - this time apart from this let us also
06:18 - remove the line brakes that we have
06:20 - provided since it is creating the Extra
06:22 - Spaces in between the input Fields so
06:25 - guys over here we have only kept one
06:27 - line break let me just save this file
06:29 - now and as as you can see these are all
06:30 - the input fields that are getting
06:32 - displayed over here now guys what we
06:34 - want to do is when the user gets the
06:35 - mouse cursor over here and clicks on any
06:38 - of the input fields we want certain box
06:40 - Shadow to be provided to these input
06:43 - Fields so simply inside the style. CSS
06:46 - file we have to make use of this class
06:49 - name that is input field over here and
06:51 - we will make use of the pseudo class
06:53 - that is focused this time so guys
06:55 - basically this Udo class is responsible
06:58 - in order to provide any CSS properties
07:00 - when the user gets the mouse cursor on
07:03 - the input field and clicks inside the
07:05 - input field over here so that is the
07:07 - time when those CSS properties will be
07:10 - applied so guys over here what we will
07:12 - do is simply we will provide the Box
07:14 - Shadow over here and this time we will
07:16 - say 10 pixels of box Shadow and we will
07:19 - provide the blue color as the Box Shadow
07:22 - this time when we save this file now
07:23 - when we get the mouse cursor over here
07:25 - and click on it as you can see we are
07:27 - getting the blue color over here and and
07:29 - when we click on the other input Fields
07:31 - as well we are getting the blue color as
07:33 - the Box Shadow let us increase the blur
07:36 - effect to 15 pixels over here when we
07:38 - save this file now as you can see the
07:41 - blue color is now getting more visible
07:42 - over here with the light green
07:44 - background color that we have provided
07:46 - to The Container now guys apart from
07:48 - this let us also provide certain CSS
07:50 - properties to this register button over
07:52 - here so simply we will make use of this
07:54 - register class and then we will provide
07:57 - certain CSS properties to this register
07:59 - the class by using the dot character so
08:02 - over here first of all we will provide
08:04 - the width as minimum content over here
08:07 - let me just save this file now as you
08:08 - can see only the required space is being
08:11 - taken by this particular button also for
08:13 - this container we will set the Align
08:15 - items so that we get all the items at
08:17 - the center of the container so when we
08:19 - say align items it is equal to Center as
08:22 - you can see all the input fields and the
08:24 - register button is now at the center of
08:26 - the container and for the input field we
08:29 - will set the width as 80% over here so
08:32 - that there is no Extra Spaces that is
08:34 - left as you can see on the left hand
08:36 - side and the right hand side of the
08:37 - input Fields so basically we will keep
08:40 - the width as 80% over here so as you can
08:43 - see 80% of the space is being taken by
08:45 - all the input Fields this time now guys
08:47 - for the register button let us provide
08:49 - more CSS properties over here so we will
08:52 - provide the background color over here
08:54 - as green color also we will set the
08:57 - color as white color that is the font
08:59 - color over here and then apart from this
09:01 - we will also set the padding of let's
09:03 - say 5 pixels this time and the Border
09:06 - radius as well so simply we will say
09:08 - border radius of 10 pixels when we save
09:11 - this file now as you can see this is the
09:12 - button that is getting displayed over
09:14 - here we will also remove the border so
09:17 - simply we will say border it is equal to
09:19 - none and let us increase the padding to
09:21 - 10 pixels this time so this is a decent
09:24 - register button that is getting
09:26 - displayed over here also we want to
09:28 - change the cursor icon so we will set
09:31 - the cursor it is equal to pointer so
09:33 - when we get the mouse cursor over here
09:35 - on the register button it is getting
09:37 - converted to the hand tool over here now
09:39 - guys apart from this when the user gets
09:41 - the mouse cursor on this register button
09:43 - we want to scale the button so how we
09:45 - can do that so simply we will make use
09:47 - of the hover sudo class over here so we
09:50 - will say register colon hover and then
09:53 - simply we will say transform and this
09:55 - time we will make use of the scale and
09:57 - it should scale by 1 Point two times
10:00 - over here so when we save this file now
10:02 - and when we get the mouse cursor over
10:04 - here as you can see the button is
10:06 - scaling Itself by 1.2 times that we have
10:09 - provided and if we want the smooth
10:11 - transition simply we will provide the
10:12 - transition CSS property to this register
10:15 - button over here so we provide
10:18 - transition and we will say all and this
10:20 - time we will say 0.5 seconds as the
10:22 - timing when we save this file now and
10:25 - now when we get the mouse cursor as you
10:27 - can see there's a smooth transition that
10:29 - is happening over here the register
10:31 - button is increasing its size so guys
10:33 - basically this is the way that you can
10:35 - provide the transition effect to any of
10:38 - the HTML elements based on your
10:39 - requirements and then guys when we get
10:41 - the mouse cursor over here and click on
10:43 - any of the input Fields basically we are
10:46 - getting the Box shadow of the blue color
10:48 - this time so that the user gets the
10:50 - feedback that this is the input field
10:53 - that is getting clicked and you are
10:54 - supposed to provide the data inside this
10:56 - field so guys simply let us provide
10:58 - certain data over here so we have
