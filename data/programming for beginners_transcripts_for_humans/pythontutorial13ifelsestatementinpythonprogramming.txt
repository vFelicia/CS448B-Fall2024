00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to learn
00:03 - about if else statement in Python
00:06 - Programming so guys in computer
00:07 - programming we use the if statement to
00:10 - run a block of code only when a certain
00:13 - condition is met so for example as you
00:15 - can see assigning grades that is ABC
00:18 - based on the marks obtained by a student
00:21 - so basically over here in this case we
00:23 - will be using the if condition now what
00:25 - can be the conditions we can say that if
00:27 - the percentage of the student is above
00:30 - 90 percent so assign grade A in the same
00:33 - way if the percentage is above 75
00:35 - percent then assign Grade B and if the
00:38 - percentage is above 65 percent but less
00:41 - than 75 percent then assign grade C so
00:44 - during such conditions we have to use
00:46 - the if else statement over here now
00:48 - similarly in Python there are three
00:50 - forms of if else statement so we are
00:53 - going to check all these forms of
00:54 - statements one at a time with the help
00:56 - of examples the first part is the if
00:58 - statement in which case we are going to
01:00 - Simply have the if statement over here
01:02 - along with the condition and the block
01:04 - of code the next form will be if else
01:07 - statement in which case we will also
01:09 - have the else block over here and the
01:11 - third form of the if else statement will
01:13 - be first we will be having the if
01:14 - statement and Then followed by the alif
01:17 - statement in which case we have another
01:19 - condition over here and then finally we
01:21 - have the else statement over here so let
01:23 - us take all this with the help of
01:24 - examples in the vs code so over here
01:27 - let's say we have the value of x it is
01:29 - equal to 10. now what we have to do is
01:32 - we have to provide the if condition over
01:34 - here so as you can see when we type if
01:36 - keyword over here vs code is suggesting
01:39 - us that we can use this if keyword so we
01:41 - are going to use this and then we are
01:43 - supposed to have some condition so we
01:45 - can say x greater than 5 over here so
01:48 - guys this is one of the comparison
01:49 - operators that we have already seen
01:51 - previously it will check whether this
01:53 - left hand side variable is it greater
01:55 - than the value that is present on the
01:57 - right hand side so guys this is one of
01:59 - the conditions that we are going to
02:00 - check and then followed by a colon over
02:03 - here so guys this is the format in which
02:05 - we provide the if condition and if this
02:08 - condition that is whether X is greater
02:10 - than 5 if it is true then we want to
02:12 - come inside this and there will be the
02:14 - block of code we need to have certain
02:16 - statements over here so we will say
02:19 - print and we can simply put the string
02:21 - that is X is greater than 5 over here
02:25 - since that is the condition that we have
02:27 - checked so this is the very simple code
02:29 - that we can have with the if condition
02:31 - over here let me just save this file and
02:33 - try running this code now so as you can
02:35 - see it is displaying X is greater than 5
02:37 - now guys this is just one statement that
02:40 - we have provided inside the if condition
02:42 - we can also have multiple lines of code
02:44 - inside this block over here after the if
02:46 - condition so we simply have to press
02:49 - enter and provide the another print
02:51 - statement and let's say we will simply
02:53 - put we have checked X so we have a very
02:57 - general statement over here that is we
02:59 - have checked X over here let me just
03:01 - save this file and try running this code
03:02 - now so as you can see X is greater than
03:04 - 5 this thing is getting printed and this
03:07 - statement that is we have checked X is
03:09 - also getting printed so all the lines of
03:11 - code that is present inside the block
03:14 - after this condition that we have
03:16 - provided in the if statement will be
03:18 - executed only when this condition that
03:20 - is X greater than 5 is true now what if
03:23 - this condition is not true so let's say
03:25 - I provide X less than 5 over here in
03:28 - which case this condition will become
03:30 - false so what will happen is the control
03:32 - flow will not go inside this block and
03:34 - it will not print these statements over
03:36 - here let us verify this I will just save
03:39 - this file and try running this code now
03:41 - so as you can see nothing is getting
03:43 - printed over here that's because these
03:45 - lines of code are not getting executed
03:47 - because this condition was false now how
03:49 - do we verify that we have to come out of
03:52 - this block so basically we have indented
03:54 - this code that is there are some space
03:56 - characters over here in this line that
03:58 - is why these lines of code over here are
04:01 - treated to be present inside the block
04:03 - after this condition we have to come out
04:05 - of that block over here so we simply
04:08 - press enter and then we press backspace
04:10 - so that the cursor is aligned to this if
04:12 - condition over here now we can simply
04:14 - provide another print statement and I
04:17 - will simply say outside if statement so
04:20 - over here we say outside if statement
04:23 - now guys this line of code it will
04:25 - confirm that the control flow has come
04:27 - out of the if block over here so let me
04:29 - just save this file now and try running
04:31 - this code so as you can see we are
04:33 - getting outside if statement that's
04:35 - because X less than 5 condition was
04:37 - false and that is why these two lines of
04:40 - code were not printed and and then the
04:42 - control Flow came out of the if
04:43 - condition and then this line that is
04:45 - outside if statement was printed so guys
04:48 - it is very important that you follow
04:49 - this indentation as far as your python
04:52 - programs are concerned you might get
04:53 - incorrect output if you don't follow
04:55 - such indentations properly now let us
04:58 - move to another form of if statement so
05:00 - over here the second form is we provide
05:02 - the else part as well so the first part
05:04 - we have already seen that is using the
05:05 - if statement let us now use the else
05:08 - statement as well so over here what we
05:10 - will do is first of all we will check
05:11 - whether X is greater than 5 and then we
05:14 - will print that is X is greater than 5
05:17 - over here now what if X is not greater
05:19 - than 5 that means it is less than or
05:21 - equal to 5 so we have to define the else
05:24 - part over here so first of all we have
05:26 - to remove this indentation part so I'll
05:28 - just press on backspace and then we
05:30 - provide the else keyword as you can see
05:32 - vs code is suggesting us this as keyword
05:34 - over here we will use this and then
05:37 - followed by colon and then we can go
05:39 - inside this block of code and similarly
05:41 - we will have another print statement in
05:43 - this case we will say X is not greater
05:46 - than 5 so we are checking whether X is
05:49 - greater than 5 and we will say x is
05:51 - greater than 5 if this condition is true
05:53 - and if this is not true then it will go
05:55 - in the else part and it will say X is
05:58 - not greater than 5 and after this part
06:00 - of code gets executed the control flow
06:02 - will come over here and it will print
06:04 - this statement that is outside if
06:06 - statement over here so let me just save
06:07 - this file and try running this code now
06:10 - so as you can see it says X is greater
06:12 - than 5 so why here since the value of x
06:14 - it is 10 it is printing X is greater
06:17 - than 5 after this x greater than 5
06:19 - condition is true and then after that we
06:21 - are getting outside if statement so the
06:24 - control flow did not go inside this else
06:26 - part that's because it went inside this
06:28 - if part and this line of code was
06:30 - executed so guys the control flow can
06:33 - only go inside one block of code if this
06:35 - condition is true then it will come out
06:37 - it will not go inside the else part and
06:40 - if this condition becomes false then it
06:42 - will go over here in the else part and
06:44 - execute that line of code so let us
06:46 - check that second scenario now what if X
06:48 - is not greater than 5 so we will change
06:51 - the value of x and let us say the X
06:53 - values is 2 now so in this case is X
06:56 - greater than 5 no in this case so this
06:58 - line of code that is X is not greater
07:00 - than 5 should get printed let me just
07:02 - save this file and try running this code
07:04 - now so as you can see X is not greater
07:07 - than 5 this line of code is getting
07:09 - printed that's because the condition was
07:11 - false and the control Flow came in the
07:13 - else part and it executed this line of
07:16 - code after this outside if statement got
07:18 - printed over here as you can see on the
07:20 - console so guys this is one of the
07:22 - examples of the if else statement that
07:24 - we can use guys there will be many
07:25 - instances where you will be using this
07:27 - if else statement in your actual
07:30 - programs so make sure that you practice
07:31 - on your own now after this let us see
07:34 - another part that is we have the alif as
07:36 - well so guys let us take this example
07:38 - over here that is of grading system so
07:40 - if the percentage is greater than 90 we
07:43 - have to assign the grade that is a If
07:45 - the percentage is greater than 75 but
07:47 - less than 90 then we will say the grade
07:50 - is B and if the percentage is greater
07:52 - than 65 but less than 75 then we have to
07:55 - put the grade as C so guys let us move
07:57 - to the code over here let us clear all
07:59 - these lines of code and over here we
08:01 - will simply have the percentage variable
08:03 - and let's say we have 95 as the
08:06 - percentage initially and then we have
08:08 - another variable that is great let's say
08:09 - it is is equal to D initially so we have
08:12 - this character that is D over here now
08:14 - what we have to do is we have to provide
08:16 - the if condition and the first condition
08:18 - is whether the percentage is above 90.
08:21 - so over here we will say inside the if
08:23 - condition first of all whether this
08:25 - percentage is it above 90 over here so
08:28 - we will simply have percentage greater
08:30 - than 90 and if this is true then we have
08:33 - to provide colon and then we have to
08:35 - make the value of this grade as a so
08:37 - grade it is equal to a over here inside
08:39 - the single quotes now we have another
08:42 - condition that is if the percentage is
08:44 - greater than 75 but if it is less than
08:46 - or equal to 90 then it should be B so
08:49 - what we have to do is we can use the
08:51 - alif part over here so we have alif
08:54 - keyword so as you can see vs code is
08:56 - suggesting us this alif keyword over
08:58 - here followed by we have to check
09:00 - whether this percentage again is it
09:03 - greater than 75 so over here if it is
09:05 - greater than 75 then we have to come in
09:08 - this block of code and then after this
09:10 - is again we have to assign the value to
09:12 - this grade variable and this time the
09:14 - value will be B over here so we will
09:16 - assign the value to grade as B and then
09:19 - after this we will again have the alif
09:21 - part over here and we need to check
09:23 - whether the percentage is greater than
09:24 - 65 or not and then in that case we have
09:27 - to provide C so over here we will say n
09:30 - left percentage it is greater than 65 in
09:35 - this case and then if this is true then
09:37 - we have to provide the grade value as C
09:40 - over here and then guys we can also have
09:43 - the else part over here and we can
09:45 - simply provide that the grade in the
09:47 - else part it can be D over here in case
09:49 - the percentage is less than 65 so we can
09:52 - have grade SD and then finally we will
09:54 - have the print statement over here so we
09:56 - have the print function and we will
09:58 - simply provide the grade value so the
10:01 - grade is and then we have comma and then
10:04 - the grade variable over here so guys
10:06 - over here as you can see initially the
10:08 - percentage is 95 so it should go inside
10:10 - the first if statement so let me just
10:12 - save this file now and try running this
10:14 - code so as you can see we are getting
10:16 - some error over here at the else Parts
10:18 - over here we have forgot to provide the
10:20 - colon after the else part so it is very
10:22 - important that we provide the colon
10:24 - after any of these keywords that we have
10:26 - used and the conditions that we have
10:28 - used so let me just save this file and
10:29 - try running this code now so as you can
10:31 - see the grade is a that's because the
10:33 - percentage value is 95 and in this case
10:36 - percentage is greater than 90 and that
10:39 - is why the grade is being assigned as
10:40 - the value as a what if the percentage
10:42 - value is not greater than 90 so let's
10:45 - say we provide the percentage value as
10:47 - 85 so in this case the control flow will
10:49 - come over here it will check whether
10:50 - percentage greater than 90 no in this
10:53 - case then it will go inside the alif
10:55 - part so is percentage greater than 75
10:57 - yes in this case so this line of code
11:00 - that is grade equal to B will get
11:02 - executed and then the control flow will
11:04 - come directly out of the if else
11:06 - statement and it will print the grade
11:07 - over here let me just save this file
11:09 - interaction in this code now so as you
11:11 - can see the grade is being assigned the
11:13 - value as B so grade is B is getting
11:15 - printed over here similarly let's say we
11:17 - provide the percentage value as 70. so
11:20 - this time this condition that is
11:22 - percentage greater than 65 will get
11:24 - executed because the previous conditions
11:26 - are already false in this case so let me
11:28 - just save this file and try running this
11:30 - code now so grade must be C so as you
11:32 - can see the grade is C over here and
11:34 - what if the percentage is less than 65
11:36 - so let's say we provide the percentage
11:38 - of 60 so finally the else part that is
11:40 - grade equal to T will get executed so
11:43 - let me just save this file and try
11:45 - running this code now so now in this
11:47 - case the grade is D so in this way we
11:49 - can easily use the if else statement we
11:51 - can also use the alif keyword in order
11:53 - to check the intermediate conditions
11:55 - over here so guys we are going to use a
11:57 - lot of if else statement in our python
11:59 - programs as well please make sure that
12:01 - you practice on your own so that on
12:03 - different inputs you get different
12:04 - outputs please make sure that you like
12:06 - this video so that it reaches to more
12:07 - people and subscribe to this channel so
12:09 - that you getting notifications on
12:11 - upcoming videos as well the next video
12:13 - that we are going to talk about is for
12:15 - Loop in Python Programming so stay tuned

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about if else statement in Python Programming so guys in computer programming we use the if statement to run a block of code only when a certain condition is met so for example as you can see assigning grades that is ABC based on the marks obtained by a student so basically over here in this case we will be using the if condition now what can be the conditions we can say that if the percentage of the student is above 90 percent so assign grade A in the same way if the percentage is above 75 percent then assign Grade B and if the percentage is above 65 percent but less than 75 percent then assign grade C so during such conditions we have to use the if else statement over here now similarly in Python there are three forms of if else statement so we are going to check all these forms of statements one at a time with the help of examples the first part is the if statement in which case we are going to Simply have the if statement over here along with the condition and the block of code the next form will be if else statement in which case we will also have the else block over here and the third form of the if else statement will be first we will be having the if statement and Then followed by the alif statement in which case we have another condition over here and then finally we have the else statement over here so let us take all this with the help of examples in the vs code so over here let's say we have the value of x it is equal to 10. now what we have to do is we have to provide the if condition over here so as you can see when we type if keyword over here vs code is suggesting us that we can use this if keyword so we are going to use this and then we are supposed to have some condition so we can say x greater than 5 over here so guys this is one of the comparison operators that we have already seen previously it will check whether this left hand side variable is it greater than the value that is present on the right hand side so guys this is one of the conditions that we are going to check and then followed by a colon over here so guys this is the format in which we provide the if condition and if this condition that is whether X is greater than 5 if it is true then we want to come inside this and there will be the block of code we need to have certain statements over here so we will say print and we can simply put the string that is X is greater than 5 over here since that is the condition that we have checked so this is the very simple code that we can have with the if condition over here let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see it is displaying X is greater than 5 now guys this is just one statement that we have provided inside the if condition we can also have multiple lines of code inside this block over here after the if condition so we simply have to press enter and provide the another print statement and let's say we will simply put we have checked X so we have a very general statement over here that is we have checked X over here let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see X is greater than 5 this thing is getting printed and this statement that is we have checked X is also getting printed so all the lines of code that is present inside the block after this condition that we have provided in the if statement will be executed only when this condition that is X greater than 5 is true now what if this condition is not true so let's say I provide X less than 5 over here in which case this condition will become false so what will happen is the control flow will not go inside this block and it will not print these statements over here let us verify this I will just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see nothing is getting printed over here that's because these lines of code are not getting executed because this condition was false now how do we verify that we have to come out of this block so basically we have indented this code that is there are some space characters over here in this line that is why these lines of code over here are treated to be present inside the block after this condition we have to come out of that block over here so we simply press enter and then we press backspace so that the cursor is aligned to this if condition over here now we can simply provide another print statement and I will simply say outside if statement so over here we say outside if statement now guys this line of code it will confirm that the control flow has come out of the if block over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting outside if statement that's because X less than 5 condition was false and that is why these two lines of code were not printed and and then the control Flow came out of the if condition and then this line that is outside if statement was printed so guys it is very important that you follow this indentation as far as your python programs are concerned you might get incorrect output if you don't follow such indentations properly now let us move to another form of if statement so over here the second form is we provide the else part as well so the first part we have already seen that is using the if statement let us now use the else statement as well so over here what we will do is first of all we will check whether X is greater than 5 and then we will print that is X is greater than 5 over here now what if X is not greater than 5 that means it is less than or equal to 5 so we have to define the else part over here so first of all we have to remove this indentation part so I'll just press on backspace and then we provide the else keyword as you can see vs code is suggesting us this as keyword over here we will use this and then followed by colon and then we can go inside this block of code and similarly we will have another print statement in this case we will say X is not greater than 5 so we are checking whether X is greater than 5 and we will say x is greater than 5 if this condition is true and if this is not true then it will go in the else part and it will say X is not greater than 5 and after this part of code gets executed the control flow will come over here and it will print this statement that is outside if statement over here so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see it says X is greater than 5 so why here since the value of x it is 10 it is printing X is greater than 5 after this x greater than 5 condition is true and then after that we are getting outside if statement so the control flow did not go inside this else part that's because it went inside this if part and this line of code was executed so guys the control flow can only go inside one block of code if this condition is true then it will come out it will not go inside the else part and if this condition becomes false then it will go over here in the else part and execute that line of code so let us check that second scenario now what if X is not greater than 5 so we will change the value of x and let us say the X values is 2 now so in this case is X greater than 5 no in this case so this line of code that is X is not greater than 5 should get printed let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see X is not greater than 5 this line of code is getting printed that's because the condition was false and the control Flow came in the else part and it executed this line of code after this outside if statement got printed over here as you can see on the console so guys this is one of the examples of the if else statement that we can use guys there will be many instances where you will be using this if else statement in your actual programs so make sure that you practice on your own now after this let us see another part that is we have the alif as well so guys let us take this example over here that is of grading system so if the percentage is greater than 90 we have to assign the grade that is a If the percentage is greater than 75 but less than 90 then we will say the grade is B and if the percentage is greater than 65 but less than 75 then we have to put the grade as C so guys let us move to the code over here let us clear all these lines of code and over here we will simply have the percentage variable and let's say we have 95 as the percentage initially and then we have another variable that is great let's say it is is equal to D initially so we have this character that is D over here now what we have to do is we have to provide the if condition and the first condition is whether the percentage is above 90. so over here we will say inside the if condition first of all whether this percentage is it above 90 over here so we will simply have percentage greater than 90 and if this is true then we have to provide colon and then we have to make the value of this grade as a so grade it is equal to a over here inside the single quotes now we have another condition that is if the percentage is greater than 75 but if it is less than or equal to 90 then it should be B so what we have to do is we can use the alif part over here so we have alif keyword so as you can see vs code is suggesting us this alif keyword over here followed by we have to check whether this percentage again is it greater than 75 so over here if it is greater than 75 then we have to come in this block of code and then after this is again we have to assign the value to this grade variable and this time the value will be B over here so we will assign the value to grade as B and then after this we will again have the alif part over here and we need to check whether the percentage is greater than 65 or not and then in that case we have to provide C so over here we will say n left percentage it is greater than 65 in this case and then if this is true then we have to provide the grade value as C over here and then guys we can also have the else part over here and we can simply provide that the grade in the else part it can be D over here in case the percentage is less than 65 so we can have grade SD and then finally we will have the print statement over here so we have the print function and we will simply provide the grade value so the grade is and then we have comma and then the grade variable over here so guys over here as you can see initially the percentage is 95 so it should go inside the first if statement so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting some error over here at the else Parts over here we have forgot to provide the colon after the else part so it is very important that we provide the colon after any of these keywords that we have used and the conditions that we have used so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see the grade is a that's because the percentage value is 95 and in this case percentage is greater than 90 and that is why the grade is being assigned as the value as a what if the percentage value is not greater than 90 so let's say we provide the percentage value as 85 so in this case the control flow will come over here it will check whether percentage greater than 90 no in this case then it will go inside the alif part so is percentage greater than 75 yes in this case so this line of code that is grade equal to B will get executed and then the control flow will come directly out of the if else statement and it will print the grade over here let me just save this file interaction in this code now so as you can see the grade is being assigned the value as B so grade is B is getting printed over here similarly let's say we provide the percentage value as 70. so this time this condition that is percentage greater than 65 will get executed because the previous conditions are already false in this case so let me just save this file and try running this code now so grade must be C so as you can see the grade is C over here and what if the percentage is less than 65 so let's say we provide the percentage of 60 so finally the else part that is grade equal to T will get executed so let me just save this file and try running this code now so now in this case the grade is D so in this way we can easily use the if else statement we can also use the alif keyword in order to check the intermediate conditions over here so guys we are going to use a lot of if else statement in our python programs as well please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people
