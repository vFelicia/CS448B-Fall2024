With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see how we can change the
00:02 - HTML content using JavaScript so guys
00:05 - basically we can use one of the many
00:07 - JavaScript HTML methods which is get
00:10 - element by ID over here and then inside
00:13 - the parenthesis in this case we need to
00:15 - provide the ID of the HTML element in
00:18 - order to get the HTML element and then
00:21 - guys we can update the content of this
00:23 - HTML element as per our requirements so
00:26 - guys let us see how we can change the
00:28 - HTML content using JavaScript over here
00:31 - inside vs code so let me just remove the
00:34 - previous lines of code that we had
00:35 - written in the HTML and the JavaScript
00:38 - files over here and then guys simply we
00:40 - are going to have the diff tag inside
00:42 - which we will have the statement that is
00:45 - Hello World in this case now guys for
00:47 - this D tag we need to provide the ID
00:49 - attribute as well so let's say we
00:51 - provide the ID and let's say the value
00:53 - that we provide is demo over here so
00:55 - guys basically we have provided the ID
00:58 - attribute and the value is demo so let
01:00 - me just save this file now and try
01:02 - reloading this page on the browser so as
01:04 - you can see this is the statement that
01:06 - is hello world that is getting printed
01:08 - with the help of the diff tag over here
01:10 - now guys we need to change the content
01:12 - of this diff tag so what we will do is
01:14 - we will link the script tag over here at
01:17 - the end of the body tag in this case
01:20 - just before the end tag of the body over
01:22 - here and then we can provide the source
01:24 - attribute that is test.js in this case
01:26 - so guys basically we have linked the
01:28 - external Javascript file over here guys
01:30 - inside the external Javascript file we
01:33 - need to identify this diff tag so that
01:36 - we are able to get the value that is
01:38 - Hello World from this def tag so how do
01:41 - we identify it so guys basically there
01:43 - are multiple Dom selectors over here
01:45 - that will help us in order to identify
01:47 - the HTML elements now what is Dom so
01:50 - basically Dom full form is document
01:53 - object model which is nothing but the
01:55 - structure of the web page wherein we
01:57 - have the multiple HTML elements inside
02:00 - the body tag so guys if I show you over
02:03 - here when we press F12 or when we
02:05 - inspect this web page in this case you
02:08 - can see all the elements over here this
02:10 - is nothing but the Dom of this
02:12 - particular web page we have the head
02:13 - section over here and then inside the
02:15 - head section we have multiple tags and
02:18 - then after that we have the body tag as
02:20 - well inside which currently we only have
02:22 - one tag over here but with time when
02:25 - your project is going to become more
02:27 - complex you are going to have multiple
02:29 - tags over here inside the body tag so
02:31 - guys basically this is nothing but the
02:33 - Dom that is document object model and
02:35 - using this document keyword we can
02:38 - access the different HTML elements
02:40 - inside the body tag over here so guys
02:42 - simply we can provide the document
02:44 - keyword as you can see this is the
02:47 - suggestion that is provided by the vs
02:48 - code over here after which we provide
02:51 - Dot and Then followed by get element by
02:54 - ID so guys as you can see there are
02:56 - multiple methods in order to get the
02:58 - element the first first one is get
03:00 - element by ID over here which we are
03:03 - going to use apart from this you can
03:05 - also get the elements by class name over
03:07 - here then we have get Elements by name
03:09 - then get Elements by tag name and so on
03:12 - you can make use of any of these methods
03:15 - in order to get the HTML element so for
03:17 - now we are going to make use of this get
03:20 - element by ID since we have already
03:22 - provided the ID value over here which is
03:24 - demo in this case we will see the
03:26 - different examples of the Dom selectors
03:28 - in the upcoming videos as well and based
03:30 - on your choice you can make use of the
03:32 - required selector as per the project
03:34 - requirements so guys over here we make
03:37 - use of the get element by ID and then we
03:39 - provide the open and close parenthesis
03:41 - inside which we need to provide the
03:43 - value of this ID over here so guys
03:45 - simply I'm going to copy the value of
03:47 - the ID and paste it inside the
03:49 - parenthesis now guys inside the
03:51 - parenthesis either you can have the
03:53 - double codes or the single codes over
03:55 - here in order to provide the value of
03:58 - the ID so guys as you can see see we
04:00 - have provided the value of the ID inside
04:03 - the get element by ID method over here
04:06 - so guys this is a very simple statement
04:08 - in order to get the value of the HTML
04:10 - element that is D tag in this case now
04:13 - guys if we want to verify whether we
04:14 - have got the correct value by using this
04:17 - get element by ID method simply we can
04:20 - provide the console. log statement so
04:22 - over here we can provide console
04:24 - followed by Dot and then we have the log
04:27 - statement over here and then inside the
04:29 - open and close parenthesis we can
04:31 - provide this entire statement that we
04:33 - had provided in this case that is
04:35 - document. get element by ID over here so
04:38 - guys previously we had seen that
04:40 - console.log statement will help us in
04:43 - order to print the data on the console
04:46 - so when we open console over here we
04:47 - will be able to see the data on the
04:49 - console when this particular statement
04:51 - is getting executed over here so guys
04:53 - let me just save this file now and try
04:55 - reloading this page once again on the
04:57 - browser so as you can see we have CAU
04:59 - the HT ml element that is Def tag along
05:02 - with the ID that is demo over here and
05:04 - it is also providing the value that is
05:06 - Hello World in this case because
05:07 - whatever value we provide over here
05:09 - inside the HTML the same value will be
05:12 - provided by the method that we have
05:14 - provided inside a JavaScript code so
05:16 - guys let us say we only want Hello World
05:19 - statement without the exclamation mark
05:21 - so when we save this file now and try
05:23 - reloading this page once again on the
05:25 - browser as you can see the same diff tag
05:27 - is now getting printed over here along
05:30 - with the hello world statement without
05:32 - the exclamation marks that we have
05:33 - already removed so guys this is the way
05:35 - that you can identify the HTML Elements
05:38 - by using the document. getet element by
05:40 - ID and then confirm it by using the
05:43 - console. log statement now guys after
05:45 - getting this HTML element which is
05:48 - containing this particular HTML element
05:50 - over here simply we can make use of the
05:52 - inner HTML property that is provided by
05:55 - the JavaScript code so guys over here we
05:57 - provide the dot character followed by
05:59 - the inner HTML as you can see this is
06:02 - the property that we must use and it
06:04 - will help us in order to overwrite the
06:07 - current value that is provided inside
06:09 - the diff tag over here so guys let us
06:12 - say we want to set it as programming for
06:14 - beginner that is the name of this
06:15 - YouTube channel which you should
06:16 - definitely subscribe if you have not
06:18 - done so so guys basically we have
06:20 - provided programming for beginner
06:22 - statement over here with the help of the
06:24 - inner HTML property by first of all
06:27 - recognizing the HTML element with the
06:29 - help of the get element by ID over here
06:32 - so this particular statement will help
06:34 - us in order to change the content that
06:37 - is hello world will be replaced by this
06:40 - programming for beginners or any other
06:42 - string that you provide by using this
06:44 - particular property guys remember that
06:46 - you need to make use of this assignment
06:48 - operator and Then followed by the value
06:50 - of the string inside the double or the
06:52 - single quotes over here apart from this
06:54 - there is a semicolon that you can
06:56 - provide at the end of the line which
06:58 - helps us to recognize that this is the
07:00 - end of the line inside a JavaScript code
07:02 - now guys semicolon is optional so you
07:04 - won't get any error if you forget to
07:06 - provide this particular semicolon in
07:08 - this case so let me just save this file
07:10 - now and simply when we reload this page
07:12 - the hello world string must be replaced
07:14 - by the programming for beginners so let
07:17 - me reload this page as you can see
07:18 - programming for beginners is now getting
07:20 - printed over here because we have
07:22 - provided this JavaScript code along with
07:24 - the inner HTML property that helps us in
07:28 - order to change the content of the web
07:30 - page so guys this is the reason that
07:32 - JavaScript is known in order to provide
07:35 - the interactivity with the web pages
07:37 - inside the website so guys basically
07:39 - HTML is used in order to create the HTML
07:42 - elements as we have seen over here CSS
07:45 - is used in order to design the HTML
07:47 - elements and then JavaScript is used in
07:50 - order to provide the interaction that is
07:52 - interactivity with the website now guys
07:54 - what we have done so far is we have
07:56 - provided this particular line inside a
07:58 - JavaScript code which will be executed
08:01 - when we simply reload this page but in
08:03 - reality what should happen is this is
08:05 - the original page that is having hello
08:07 - world over here and we must have certain
08:09 - button over here on the web page and
08:11 - when the user clicks on that particular
08:13 - button the JavaScript code must be
08:15 - called in order to change this content
08:18 - on the web page so guys we are going to
08:20 - check that as well in the upcoming
08:21 - videos as well how you can do that by
08:24 - clicking a particular button and then
08:26 - changing the content of the HTML element
08:28 - so guys comment in the comment section
