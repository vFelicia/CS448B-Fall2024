00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to learn
00:03 - about file writing in Python Programming
00:06 - so guys in Python a file operation takes
00:09 - place in the following order so
00:11 - basically first of all we have to open
00:13 - the file then secondly we can write into
00:16 - the file that we have opened and the
00:18 - last step is to close the file so these
00:20 - are the operations in this order in
00:22 - which we have to follow while writing
00:24 - the content into the file now there are
00:26 - two things we need to remember while
00:28 - writing to a file so first of all if we
00:31 - try to open a file that doesn't exist so
00:34 - a new file will be created in this case
00:36 - so guys we are going to check this with
00:37 - the help of example as well and in the
00:40 - second case if a file already exists
00:42 - then its content is erased and new
00:45 - content is added to the file again so
00:47 - Guys these are the two important things
00:49 - that you should know while writing into
00:51 - the file if the file is not already
00:53 - present then a new file will be created
00:55 - and if the file is already present then
00:58 - the existing content will be most and
01:00 - the new content will be added into the
01:02 - file so guys the first operation is
01:04 - opening the file over here in which case
01:06 - we can use the open method to open the
01:09 - file and this is the example we have the
01:12 - variable on the left hand side and then
01:14 - we have the open method followed by the
01:16 - name of the file over here along with
01:18 - the entire path if it is present in some
01:21 - other directory and Then followed by the
01:23 - second parameter that is W which stands
01:25 - for the right mode so guys let us check
01:27 - this with the help of example now over
01:29 - here so what we will do is we will say
01:31 - file 1 which is the variable name
01:33 - followed by equal to and then we have
01:36 - the open method in this case so we have
01:38 - to provide the name of the file along
01:40 - with the directory path inside the
01:42 - parenthesis and the double quotes over
01:44 - here so what we will do is we are going
01:46 - to use this directory over here in order
01:49 - to create a new file and write the
01:51 - content into the file so guys over here
01:53 - there are only two files that is Python
01:55 - tutorial and test file we are going to
01:58 - create a third file that is out Port dot
02:01 - txt in which we are going to write the
02:03 - content by using the code over here so
02:05 - basically I'm going to paste the entire
02:07 - directory path and in order to avoid any
02:10 - errors I'll just use the double
02:12 - backslashes over here since these are
02:14 - the Escape characters so we provide the
02:16 - double backslashes and then at the end
02:18 - we have to provide the name of the file
02:20 - so I'll simply provide output dot txt in
02:24 - this case and then guys the second
02:25 - parameter needs to be the writing mode
02:28 - so over here inside the double quotes we
02:30 - can say w which means we are opening the
02:33 - file in the right mode in this case now
02:35 - guys we have completed the first step
02:37 - now what is the next step writing into
02:39 - the file so basically writing in a file
02:41 - in a python so after we open a file we
02:43 - use the write method to write the
02:46 - content in the file and this is the way
02:48 - as you can see in this example we have
02:50 - the variable name that is file 1
02:51 - followed by Dot and then we have the
02:54 - right method and then the content that
02:57 - we want to write into the file so guys
02:58 - basically what we will towards on the
03:01 - second line over here we will say file 1
03:03 - followed by Dot and then we have the
03:06 - right method this right method can be
03:08 - used in order to write the content into
03:10 - the file and it takes certain parameters
03:12 - the parameters will be the string or the
03:14 - integer numbers that you want to print
03:16 - or store inside the file so guys let's
03:19 - say I want to provide this is first line
03:24 - in output
03:27 - file
03:28 - so guys this is the content that we want
03:30 - to write into the file and this is the
03:32 - way that we can use the write function
03:34 - in order to write the content into the
03:36 - file and it takes the parameter as the
03:38 - string which you want to store inside
03:40 - the file now after writing what we have
03:42 - to do is we have to close the file so
03:45 - when we are done with performing
03:46 - operations on the file we need to
03:49 - properly close the file closing a file
03:51 - will free up the resources that were
03:53 - tied with the file it is done using the
03:55 - close method in Python so as you can see
03:58 - in this example we have file one dot
04:00 - close so over here we can simply provide
04:03 - file 1 Dot close in this case and then
04:07 - open and close parenthesis it doesn't
04:09 - take any parameters over here so guys
04:11 - let me just save this file now before
04:13 - running this code I'll show you the
04:14 - directory once again we have only two
04:16 - files over here that is Python tutorial
04:18 - and test file we are going to have a
04:21 - third file over here that is the
04:22 - output.txt that will be created after
04:25 - execution of this code so before running
04:27 - this code what I will do is I'll have
04:29 - the print statement so that we get the
04:32 - confirmation that the code is executed
04:34 - so we will say file created
04:38 - successfully
04:41 - so this is the statement that will be
04:43 - printed after all the lines of code are
04:45 - executed so guys let me just save this
04:47 - file now and try running this code so as
04:49 - you can see we are getting file created
04:51 - successfully and if we go inside the
04:53 - directory now as you can see we are
04:55 - getting the third file over here that is
04:57 - the output in this case so if we open
04:59 - this file as you can see this is first
05:01 - line in output file and this is what we
05:04 - have printed by using our program this
05:06 - is first line in output file the same
05:09 - statement is being printed over here it
05:11 - is being stored in our output file and
05:13 - guys this is the way that we have
05:15 - created a new file by using the python
05:18 - code in a particular directory that we
05:20 - wanted and also return the content into
05:23 - the file by using the two methods that
05:25 - is first of all we have used the open
05:27 - function in order to open the file in
05:30 - the right mode and then we have used the
05:33 - write function in order to write the
05:35 - content into the file now guys let us
05:37 - say we have another scenario in the same
05:39 - file we want to update the first line to
05:42 - this is first line and I'll just remove
05:44 - this in output file content over here so
05:47 - we have the short message that is this
05:49 - is first line and then what I will do is
05:51 - we have another statement so again we
05:54 - will have the file one dot right and
05:56 - then we can say this is second line in
05:59 - this case so guys we are having the two
06:01 - lines over here now and this will act as
06:03 - a kind of update now that's because we
06:06 - already have this output.txt file in
06:09 - this directory and now what we are doing
06:10 - is simply we are opening it once again
06:13 - and these lines will be stored in the
06:16 - file and guys remember that while you
06:18 - are opening the existing file what we
06:20 - already saw is the content is erased and
06:23 - the new content is added to the file so
06:25 - basically these two lines will be
06:27 - printed inside the output.txt file and
06:30 - now what we will do is for this print
06:31 - function we will say file updated
06:34 - successfully so guys let me just save
06:36 - this file now before running this code
06:38 - I'll show you that file once again over
06:40 - here we we have the output file I just
06:43 - open this file we are having this is
06:44 - first line in a output file so let me
06:47 - just close this now and what we will do
06:49 - is we will run this code so as you can
06:52 - see file updated successfully we are
06:54 - getting this message will go to the
06:56 - directory to check what is the content
06:58 - so as you can see both the statements
07:00 - are getting printed over here this is
07:01 - first line and Then followed by this is
07:04 - second line now guys what happened is
07:06 - both the lines have continued on the
07:08 - same line but we can have them on the
07:10 - separate lines as well so what we can do
07:12 - is in our code we can simply provide the
07:14 - slashing character at the end of the
07:17 - first line over here so that the control
07:19 - flow goes to the next line while
07:21 - printing this statement that is this is
07:23 - second line so guys let me just save
07:24 - this file and try running this code now
07:26 - once again so it says file updated
07:28 - successfully we come back over here in
07:30 - the directory we open the output file
07:33 - now as you can see this is first line
07:35 - and then we have on the other line This
07:37 - is second line over here so guys in this
07:39 - way we can easily write the content in
07:42 - the file we can also have the multiple
07:44 - lines of content being stored in the
07:47 - file that we opened by using the Python
07:49 - programming language guys this concept
07:51 - of reading and writing the files are
07:52 - very important as far as your project
07:54 - requirements are concerned so please
07:56 - make sure that you practice on your own
07:57 - so that on different inputs you get
07:59 - different output apart from this can we
08:02 - use the with open syntax in order to
08:05 - write a file so you can try this as a
08:07 - homework for you you can watch my
08:08 - previous video as well in which I have
08:10 - explained you how we can use the with
08:12 - open syntax in order to read the file
08:15 - and in which case we don't have to close
08:17 - the file that's because it is
08:18 - automatically handled by this with open
08:21 - syntax for us so please treat this as a
08:23 - homework for you and comment in the
08:25 - comment section below whether you were
08:27 - able to use the with open syntax in
08:29 - order to write into the file please make
08:31 - sure that you like this video so that it
08:33 - reaches to more people and subscribe to
08:35 - this channel so that you get the
08:36 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
08:38 - the next video that we are going to talk
08:40 - about is there directory in Python
08:42 - Programming so stay tuned

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about file writing in Python Programming so guys in Python a file operation takes place in the following order so basically first of all we have to open the file then secondly we can write into the file that we have opened and the last step is to close the file so these are the operations in this order in which we have to follow while writing the content into the file now there are two things we need to remember while writing to a file so first of all if we try to open a file that doesn't exist so a new file will be created in this case so guys we are going to check this with the help of example as well and in the second case if a file already exists then its content is erased and new content is added to the file again so Guys these are the two important things that you should know while writing into the file if the file is not already present then a new file will be created and if the file is already present then the existing content will be most and the new content will be added into the file so guys the first operation is opening the file over here in which case we can use the open method to open the file and this is the example we have the variable on the left hand side and then we have the open method followed by the name of the file over here along with the entire path if it is present in some other directory and Then followed by the second parameter that is W which stands for the right mode so guys let us check this with the help of example now over here so what we will do is we will say file 1 which is the variable name followed by equal to and then we have the open method in this case so we have to provide the name of the file along with the directory path inside the parenthesis and the double quotes over here so what we will do is we are going to use this directory over here in order to create a new file and write the content into the file so guys over here there are only two files that is Python tutorial and test file we are going to create a third file that is out Port dot txt in which we are going to write the content by using the code over here so basically I'm going to paste the entire directory path and in order to avoid any errors I'll just use the double backslashes over here since these are the Escape characters so we provide the double backslashes and then at the end we have to provide the name of the file so I'll simply provide output dot txt in this case and then guys the second parameter needs to be the writing mode so over here inside the double quotes we can say w which means we are opening the file in the right mode in this case now guys we have completed the first step now what is the next step writing into the file so basically writing in a file in a python so after we open a file we use the write method to write the content in the file and this is the way as you can see in this example we have the variable name that is file 1 followed by Dot and then we have the right method and then the content that we want to write into the file so guys basically what we will towards on the second line over here we will say file 1 followed by Dot and then we have the right method this right method can be used in order to write the content into the file and it takes certain parameters the parameters will be the string or the integer numbers that you want to print or store inside the file so guys let's say I want to provide this is first line in output file so guys this is the content that we want to write into the file and this is the way that we can use the write function in order to write the content into the file and it takes the parameter as the string which you want to store inside the file now after writing what we have to do is we have to close the file so when we are done with performing operations on the file we need to properly close the file closing a file will free up the resources that were tied with the file it is done using the close method in Python so as you can see in this example we have file one dot close so over here we can simply provide file 1 Dot close in this case and then open and close parenthesis it doesn't take any parameters over here so guys let me just save this file now before running this code I'll show you the directory once again we have only two files over here that is Python tutorial and test file we are going to have a third file over here that is the output.txt that will be created after execution of this code so before running this code what I will do is I'll have the print statement so that we get the confirmation that the code is executed so we will say file created successfully so this is the statement that will be printed after all the lines of code are executed so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting file created successfully and if we go inside the directory now as you can see we are getting the third file over here that is the output in this case so if we open this file as you can see this is first line in output file and this is what we have printed by using our program this is first line in output file the same statement is being printed over here it is being stored in our output file and guys this is the way that we have created a new file by using the python code in a particular directory that we wanted and also return the content into the file by using the two methods that is first of all we have used the open function in order to open the file in the right mode and then we have used the write function in order to write the content into the file now guys let us say we have another scenario in the same file we want to update the first line to this is first line and I'll just remove this in output file content over here so we have the short message that is this is first line and then what I will do is we have another statement so again we will have the file one dot right and then we can say this is second line in this case so guys we are having the two lines over here now and this will act as a kind of update now that's because we already have this output.txt file in this directory and now what we are doing is simply we are opening it once again and these lines will be stored in the file and guys remember that while you are opening the existing file what we already saw is the content is erased and the new content is added to the file so basically these two lines will be printed inside the output.txt file and now what we will do is for this print function we will say file updated successfully so guys let me just save this file now before running this code I'll show you that file once again over here we we have the output file I just open this file we are having this is first line in a output file so let me just close this now and what we will do is we will run this code so as you can see file updated successfully we are getting this message will go to the directory to check what is the content so as you can see both the statements are getting printed over here this is first line and Then followed by this is second line now guys what happened is both the lines have continued on the same line but we can have them on the separate lines as well so what we can do is in our code we can simply provide the slashing character at the end of the first line over here so that the control flow goes to the next line while printing this statement that is this is second line so guys let me just save this file and try running this code now once again so it says file updated successfully we come back over here in the directory we open the output file now as you can see this is first line and then we have on the other line This is second line over here so guys in this way we can easily write the content in the file we can also have the multiple lines of content being stored in the file that we opened by using the Python programming language guys this concept of reading and writing the files are very important as far as your project requirements are concerned so please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different output apart from this can we use the with open syntax in order to write a file so you can try this as a homework for you you can watch my previous video as well

about is there directory in Python Programming so stay tuned
