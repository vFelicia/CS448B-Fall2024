00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to make a simple
00:05 - calculator so guys in this program we
00:08 - ask the user to choose an operation for
00:11 - simple calculator such as addition
00:13 - subtract multiplication or division then
00:16 - the user enters two numbers based on the
00:19 - choice of operation and then the result
00:21 - will be displayed based on the operation
00:23 - that is selected so guys this is a very
00:25 - simple calculator that we are going to
00:27 - make using the Python program in vs code
00:29 - so guys over here the very first thing
00:31 - that we are going to print is we are
00:33 - going to say choose an operation so
00:35 - choose an operation between one to four
00:38 - so these operations will be the very
00:40 - first thing will be the number one it
00:43 - will be equal to add so two numbers will
00:45 - be added over here and then similarly we
00:48 - have more three operations so over here
00:50 - the second operation it will be subtract
00:52 - so we say subtract over here and then we
00:55 - have multiply and then we have divide
00:57 - over here so these are the operations it
00:59 - is 1 is for ADD adding 2 is for
01:01 - subtracting 3 is for multiplying and
01:03 - then 4 is for dividing two numbers so
01:05 - guys what we can do is choose an
01:07 - operation this label we can provide
01:09 - after providing all these options that
01:11 - is one to four and then user will be
01:13 - providing one of these options so what
01:16 - we will do is we will take that option
01:17 - inside the option variable it is equal
01:20 - to we will use the input function in
01:23 - order to take the input from the user
01:25 - and instead of having this print
01:27 - statement we can have this label inside
01:29 - the input function so I'll just copy
01:32 - this and paste this over here inside the
01:34 - input function and we can simply remove
01:36 - this print statement over here so guys
01:38 - basically we are providing four options
01:40 - and then we are asking the user to
01:42 - choose an operation now guys over here
01:44 - the data that is provided by the user
01:46 - will be of the string data type so we
01:48 - need to convert it into the integer so
01:51 - we use the end function as the prefix
01:53 - and enclose the entire input function
01:56 - inside this int function over here so
01:58 - that whatever operation is chosen by ID
02:00 - user it is converted to integer and then
02:02 - it is stored in this option variable now
02:05 - guys we need to check whether the option
02:06 - selected is between 1 to 4 so over here
02:09 - we say if option n and then we can have
02:13 - the list and the list will contain one
02:15 - two three four which means this
02:18 - expression that is option n inside this
02:20 - list it will be true only when the user
02:23 - selects the option between 1 to 4 and
02:25 - then after that only we will take the
02:27 - two numbers from the user in order to
02:29 - carry out the operation of the simple
02:31 - calculator or else what we can do is if
02:34 - the number that is entered by the user
02:36 - is not between 1 to 4 then it is an
02:38 - invalid operation so we can simply print
02:41 - the invalid operation over here so we
02:44 - say invalid operation entered now guys
02:48 - we take the two numbers in order to
02:50 - carry out the operation that is selected
02:52 - by the user so over here what we will do
02:55 - is we will say num1 it is equal to n and
02:58 - inside this we will have the in port and
03:00 - we will say enter first number so over
03:03 - here enter first number so basically
03:06 - this is the label user will enter the
03:09 - first number and it will be converted to
03:11 - the integer which will be then assigned
03:13 - to this num1 similarly we have the
03:15 - second number to be provided by the user
03:17 - so I'll just copy and paste the same
03:19 - line of code we will say num2 and then
03:22 - over here enter second number this time
03:25 - so user enters the second number over
03:27 - here now based on the operation we need
03:29 - to find out the result so guys what we
03:31 - will do is we will say if and then we
03:33 - will check whether this option is it
03:36 - equal to 1 which means when the
03:38 - operation selected is 1 which means we
03:40 - need to add the two numbers so num1 plus
03:43 - num2 should be present inside the result
03:45 - so over here we say colon and then we
03:48 - have another variable that is result it
03:50 - is equal to num1 plus num 2 over here so
03:54 - guys this is the addition operation now
03:56 - let's say if the option that is selected
03:58 - is 2 so we will have the LF part over
04:01 - here and then we can again say option is
04:04 - it equal to 2 so this time what we have
04:06 - to do is we have to subtract the two
04:09 - numbers so result it will be equal to
04:11 - num1 minus num2 this time so over here
04:14 - we will say num1 minus num2 in this case
04:17 - again if the option is 3 over here what
04:19 - we will do is I'll simply copy paste
04:22 - these lines of code over here so we have
04:24 - alif option and then is it equal to 3 so
04:27 - for the operation that is 3 over here we
04:30 - need to multiply the two numbers over
04:31 - here it will be num1 multiplied by num2
04:35 - in this case and then guys if the option
04:36 - selected is 4 which means we need to
04:38 - divide the two numbers what we will do
04:40 - is again we will copy paste this line of
04:42 - code and then if the operation is 4 then
04:45 - the result it will be equal to num1
04:47 - divided by num2 so guys 2 times forward
04:50 - slash is over here since we are dealing
04:51 - with the integers so if you want to get
04:54 - the integer so we will have 2 times
04:56 - forward slashes and if we want the float
04:58 - number we can have just one time forward
05:00 - slash over here that we will check in
05:02 - the upcoming examples as well so guys
05:04 - this is a simple calculator that is
05:06 - helping us in order to carry out these
05:08 - operations using the if and the alif
05:10 - options over here now guys what we will
05:12 - do is finally we have to print the
05:14 - result so over here we will simply say
05:17 - the result of the operation so we say
05:20 - the result of the operation is and then
05:25 - we can simply have the curly braces and
05:27 - then after this we can use the dot
05:29 - format and then what we can do is simply
05:31 - we can provide the result variable
05:33 - inside which the result is present of
05:35 - the operation that is selected by the
05:37 - user now guys simply we have to save
05:39 - this file now and try running this code
05:41 - so as we can see first option is add
05:44 - second is subtract then we have multiply
05:46 - and then divide and then choose an
05:47 - operation so user is being asked to
05:49 - choose the operation so let's say we
05:51 - provide the first option and then when
05:53 - we press enter it says enter first
05:55 - number so let's say we provide 10 and
05:57 - the second number is 20. so in this case
06:00 - the result will be 10 plus 20 which is
06:02 - equal to 30 so when we press enter it
06:04 - says the result of the operation is 30
06:06 - over here now guys let me just run this
06:09 - code once again this time we will choose
06:10 - the second operation that is subtract so
06:12 - when we provide 2 and then enter first
06:15 - number let's say we provide 20 and the
06:17 - second number is 5 so 20 minus 5 it is
06:20 - equal to 15 so when we press enter it
06:22 - says the result of the operation is 15
06:24 - this time let me just run this code once
06:27 - again this time we will check the
06:28 - multiplication operation so over here we
06:31 - choose the operation as 3 which is
06:33 - multiplication enter first number let's
06:35 - say we provide 5 and then enter second
06:37 - number let's say again we provide the
06:39 - number that is 5 over here so 5
06:41 - multiplied by 5 gives us 25 so when we
06:44 - press enter it says the result of the
06:46 - operation is 25 this time so let me just
06:49 - run this code once again this time let
06:51 - us select divide as the operation so
06:53 - operation is 4 and then let's say the
06:56 - first number is 100 and then the second
06:58 - number it is equal to 20 this time so
07:00 - 100 divided by 20 gives us the quotient
07:03 - as 5 so when we press enter it says the
07:06 - result of the operation is 5 this time
07:08 - now guys let's say we provide any other
07:09 - option which is not between 1 to 4 so
07:12 - let's say I provide the option as 5 over
07:14 - here during the choose an operation
07:16 - input so when we press enter as you can
07:19 - see we are getting invalid operation
07:20 - entered and then again we are getting
07:23 - the runtime error that is the result
07:24 - since this result was defined inside the
07:27 - if statement it was not expecting that
07:30 - we were supposed to print it over here
07:32 - outside the if statement and that is why
07:34 - we are getting this error that is name
07:36 - result is not defined now guys simply we
07:39 - can get rid of that error by defining
07:41 - ending the result variable outside the
07:43 - if statement and we can simply provide
07:45 - the result as 0 over here so when we
07:48 - save this file now and try running this
07:49 - code once again and when we provide the
07:51 - option as 5 over here when we press
07:53 - enter as you can see invalid operation
07:56 - entered and the result of the operation
07:58 - is 0 over here by default now guys let
08:00 - us say when we run this code once again
08:02 - and when we want to divide the two
08:03 - numbers this time so when we choose the
08:05 - operation as 4 and this time what we do
08:08 - is let's say I provide the number 5 over
08:10 - here and the second number is 2 so 5
08:13 - divided by 2 should give us 2.5 as the
08:16 - float number but since we have used the
08:18 - double forward slashes it will give us
08:21 - the integer value over here so when we
08:23 - press enter over here it says the result
08:25 - of the operation is 2 which is right 5
08:27 - divided by 2 gives us the quotient as 2
08:30 - but the remainder is 1 but when we want
08:32 - the quotient to be of the float data
08:35 - type what we can do is we can convert
08:37 - both these numbers that is num1 and num2
08:39 - into the float numbers so here we have
08:42 - to provide the float function inside of
08:45 - the end function for both these numbers
08:46 - and then what we can do is num1 and then
08:49 - divide by num2 only 1 forward slash is
08:52 - required in order to divide the two
08:54 - floating integers so when we save this
08:57 - file now and try running this code once
08:59 - again what we will do is we will provide
09:01 - the operation as 4 which is divided this
09:03 - time and then enter first number let's
09:05 - say we provide 5 and the second number
09:07 - is 2 and when we press enter as we can
09:09 - see the result of the operation is 2.5
09:12 - so basically as far as divide operation
09:14 - is concerned we can have both the
09:16 - numbers as the floating integers over
09:18 - here and then we can use the single
09:20 - forward slash in order to get the
09:22 - quotient as the floating integer and
09:24 - when we want the result to be of the
09:26 - purely integer data type we can have the
09:29 - double forward slashes and then when we
09:31 - save this file now enter running this
09:33 - code once again when we provide the
09:34 - operation as 4 and then the first number
09:37 - is 5 second number S2 we get the result
09:39 - as 2.0 that's because we have provided
09:42 - the double forward slashes as far as
09:44 - division is concerned so guys this is
09:46 - very important two forward slashes means
09:48 - we will get the integer as the result
09:50 - and one forward slashes means we will
09:53 - get the floating number as the result so
09:55 - guys please make sure that you practice
09:56 - on your own so that on different inputs
09:58 - you get different outputs and you are
10:00 - able to make the simple calculator using
10:02 - the Python program make sure that you
10:04 - like this video so that it reaches to
10:06 - more people and subscribe to this
10:07 - channel so that you get the
10:09 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
10:11 - the next video that we are going to talk
10:12 - about is Python program to shuffle the
10:15 - deck of cards so stay tuned

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to make a simple calculator so guys in this program we ask the user to choose an operation for simple calculator such as addition subtract multiplication or division then the user enters two numbers based on the choice of operation and then the result will be displayed based on the operation that is selected so guys this is a very simple calculator that we are going to make using the Python program in vs code so guys over here the very first thing that we are going to print is we are going to say choose an operation so choose an operation between one to four so these operations will be the very first thing will be the number one it will be equal to add so two numbers will be added over here and then similarly we have more three operations so over here the second operation it will be subtract so we say subtract over here and then we have multiply and then we have divide over here so these are the operations it is 1 is for ADD adding 2 is for subtracting 3 is for multiplying and then 4 is for dividing two numbers so guys what we can do is choose an operation this label we can provide after providing all these options that is one to four and then user will be providing one of these options so what we will do is we will take that option inside the option variable it is equal to we will use the input function in order to take the input from the user and instead of having this print statement we can have this label inside the input function so I'll just copy this and paste this over here inside the input function and we can simply remove this print statement over here so guys basically we are providing four options and then we are asking the user to choose an operation now guys over here the data that is provided by the user will be of the string data type so we need to convert it into the integer so we use the end function as the prefix and enclose the entire input function inside this int function over here so that whatever operation is chosen by ID user it is converted to integer and then it is stored in this option variable now guys we need to check whether the option selected is between 1 to 4 so over here we say if option n and then we can have the list and the list will contain one two three four which means this expression that is option n inside this list it will be true only when the user selects the option between 1 to 4 and then after that only we will take the two numbers from the user in order to carry out the operation of the simple calculator or else what we can do is if the number that is entered by the user is not between 1 to 4 then it is an invalid operation so we can simply print the invalid operation over here so we say invalid operation entered now guys we take the two numbers in order to carry out the operation that is selected by the user so over here what we will do is we will say num1 it is equal to n and inside this we will have the in port and we will say enter first number so over here enter first number so basically this is the label user will enter the first number and it will be converted to the integer which will be then assigned to this num1 similarly we have the second number to be provided by the user so I'll just copy and paste the same line of code we will say num2 and then over here enter second number this time so user enters the second number over here now based on the operation we need to find out the result so guys what we will do is we will say if and then we will check whether this option is it equal to 1 which means when the operation selected is 1 which means we need to add the two numbers so num1 plus num2 should be present inside the result so over here we say colon and then we have another variable that is result it is equal to num1 plus num 2 over here so guys this is the addition operation now let's say if the option that is selected is 2 so we will have the LF part over here and then we can again say option is it equal to 2 so this time what we have to do is we have to subtract the two numbers so result it will be equal to num1 minus num2 this time so over here we will say num1 minus num2 in this case again if the option is 3 over here what we will do is I'll simply copy paste these lines of code over here so we have alif option and then is it equal to 3 so for the operation that is 3 over here we need to multiply the two numbers over here it will be num1 multiplied by num2 in this case and then guys if the option selected is 4 which means we need to divide the two numbers what we will do is again we will copy paste this line of code and then if the operation is 4 then the result it will be equal to num1 divided by num2 so guys 2 times forward slash is over here since we are dealing with the integers so if you want to get the integer so we will have 2 times forward slashes and if we want the float number we can have just one time forward slash over here that we will check in the upcoming examples as well so guys this is a simple calculator that is helping us in order to carry out these operations using the if and the alif options over here now guys what we will do is finally we have to print the result so over here we will simply say the result of the operation so we say the result of the operation is and then we can simply have the curly braces and then after this we can use the dot format and then what we can do is simply we can provide the result variable inside which the result is present of the operation that is selected by the user now guys simply we have to save this file now and try running this code so as we can see first option is add second is subtract then we have multiply and then divide and then choose an operation so user is being asked to choose the operation so let's say we provide the first option and then when we press enter it says enter first number so let's say we provide 10 and the second number is 20. so in this case the result will be 10 plus 20 which is equal to 30 so when we press enter it says the result of the operation is 30 over here now guys let me just run this code once again this time we will choose the second operation that is subtract so when we provide 2 and then enter first number let's say we provide 20 and the second number is 5 so 20 minus 5 it is equal to 15 so when we press enter it says the result of the operation is 15 this time let me just run this code once again this time we will check the multiplication operation so over here we choose the operation as 3 which is multiplication enter first number let's say we provide 5 and then enter second number let's say again we provide the number that is 5 over here so 5 multiplied by 5 gives us 25 so when we press enter it says the result of the operation is 25 this time so let me just run this code once again this time let us select divide as the operation so operation is 4 and then let's say the first number is 100 and then the second number it is equal to 20 this time so 100 divided by 20 gives us the quotient as 5 so when we press enter it says the result of the operation is 5 this time now guys let's say we provide any other option which is not between 1 to 4 so let's say I provide the option as 5 over here during the choose an operation input so when we press enter as you can see we are getting invalid operation entered and then again we are getting the runtime error that is the result since this result was defined inside the if statement it was not expecting that we were supposed to print it over here outside the if statement and that is why we are getting this error that is name result is not defined now guys simply we can get rid of that error by defining ending the result variable outside the if statement and we can simply provide the result as 0 over here so when we save this file now and try running this code once again and when we provide the option as 5 over here when we press enter as you can see invalid operation entered and the result of the operation is 0 over here by default now guys let us say when we run this code once again and when we want to divide the two numbers this time so when we choose the operation as 4 and this time what we do is let's say I provide the number 5 over here and the second number is 2 so 5 divided by 2 should give us 2.5 as the float number but since we have used the double forward slashes it will give us the integer value over here so when we press enter over here it says the result of the operation is 2 which is right 5 divided by 2 gives us the quotient as 2 but the remainder is 1 but when we want the quotient to be of the float data type what we can do is we can convert both these numbers that is num1 and num2 into the float numbers so here we have to provide the float function inside of the end function for both these numbers and then what we can do is num1 and then divide by num2 only 1 forward slash is required in order to divide the two floating integers so when we save this file now and try running this code once again what we will do is we will provide the operation as 4 which is divided this time and then enter first number let's say we provide 5 and the second number is 2 and when we press enter as we can see the result of the operation is 2.5 so basically as far as divide operation is concerned we can have both the numbers as the floating integers over here and then we can use the single forward slash in order to get the quotient as the floating integer and when we want the result to be of the purely integer data type we can have the double forward slashes and then when we save this file now enter running this code once again when we provide the operation as 4 and then the first number is 5 second number S2 we get the result as 2.0 that's because we have provided the double forward slashes as far as division is concerned so guys this is very important two forward slashes means we will get the integer as the result and one forward slashes means we will get the floating number as the result so guys please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs and you are able to make the simple calculator using the Python program make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to
