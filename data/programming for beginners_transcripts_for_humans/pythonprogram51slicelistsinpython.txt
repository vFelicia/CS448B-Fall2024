00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to slice list so guys
00:06 - basically slicing of the list means we
00:09 - are finding the subset of the entire
00:11 - list we are going to include only a part
00:14 - of the list from the entire list and
00:16 - that is the process that we call list
00:17 - slicing so the format for this slicing
00:20 - is in such a way as you can see inside
00:22 - the open and close square brackets we
00:24 - have three parameters the first
00:26 - parameter is the start parameter from
00:28 - where we have to provide the index which
00:31 - is the index from where we want to start
00:33 - the elements to be included and then the
00:35 - second parameter is the stop parameter
00:37 - this is the index where the list slicing
00:40 - will stop and then the third parameter
00:42 - is the step which will help us in order
00:44 - to implement the gaps if we want to
00:46 - ignore some of the elements in between
00:48 - so guys all these three parameters are
00:51 - separated by a colon over here as you
00:53 - can see and this is the format of the
00:54 - list slicing so this is the description
00:56 - the start is the index of the list where
00:59 - slicing starts and then the stop is the
01:01 - index of the list where slicing ends and
01:04 - then we have step which allows you to
01:06 - select the nth item within the range
01:08 - start to stop so as you can see this is
01:10 - the example if we have the list which
01:12 - contains one two three four five as the
01:15 - elements inside the list and we only
01:17 - want to include the second and third
01:19 - index which means three and four so we
01:21 - can basically have the list slicing in
01:23 - this way that we need to provide the
01:25 - name of the list and then inside the
01:27 - open and close square brackets we have
01:29 - the start that is 2 over here so this
01:32 - means from index 2 that is 0 1 and then
01:35 - 2 so the element 3 will be included and
01:38 - then it will go up to index 4 so this is
01:40 - index 2 and then this is index 3 and
01:43 - this is index four so these three
01:45 - elements out of which the stock part
01:47 - that is the fourth index will not be
01:49 - included over here so only three and
01:52 - four will be included so guys it is
01:54 - important to note that whatever index we
01:56 - provide as the stop index over here that
01:59 - element will not be loaded and then in
02:01 - this case we have just ignored the step
02:03 - so all the elements in between will be
02:05 - included so guys let us check this with
02:07 - the help of examples now over here so
02:09 - basically we are going to define the
02:11 - list so let's say we have list one it is
02:14 - equal to 1 2 3 4 5. so Guys these are
02:18 - the elements inside the list now guys
02:19 - what do we want is we want to print only
02:22 - 3 and 4 which means 0 1 2 that is the
02:25 - second and third index so what we have
02:28 - to do is inside the print statement we
02:30 - provide list one and then with open and
02:33 - close square brackets either you can
02:35 - access just one element so let's say if
02:37 - you want to access this element that is
02:39 - 3 we can provide 2 over here that is the
02:41 - index number in order to access this
02:44 - element that is three so let me just
02:46 - save this file now and try running this
02:48 - code so as you can see three is getting
02:50 - printed over here but what if we want to
02:52 - print 3 and 4 in this case so over here
02:55 - we will have list slicing so after this
02:57 - second index we have colon and then we
03:00 - you have to provide the stop index which
03:02 - is this element over here which is at
03:04 - the fourth index so over here we provide
03:06 - four guys remember that it will include
03:09 - only three and four the fourth index
03:11 - will not be included because the stock
03:13 - index is not included over here by
03:15 - implementing the list slicing so let me
03:17 - just save this file now and try running
03:19 - this code so as you can see we are
03:21 - getting three and then four now guys
03:22 - let's say I want to access all the
03:24 - elements after three so what we can do
03:26 - is we don't have to provide the stop
03:28 - parameter so over here we provide two
03:30 - that is the index of this element that
03:32 - is 3 and then after colon we don't
03:34 - provide anything so all the elements
03:36 - after the second index will be included
03:39 - in this case it will be three four five
03:41 - so let me just save this file now and
03:43 - try running this code so as you can see
03:44 - we are getting three four five now guys
03:46 - let me just change the content of the
03:48 - list we will provide the numbers over
03:51 - here from 1 to 10 so we have 7 8 9 and
03:54 - then we have 10 so top 10 numbers over
03:56 - here let me just save this file now and
03:58 - try running this code as you can can see
04:00 - we are getting the numbers from 3 up to
04:02 - 10 over here and that is how we have
04:04 - done the less slicing now guys let's say
04:06 - we want all the numbers so what we can
04:08 - do is simply we can provide 0 over here
04:10 - and then colon and then no stop and step
04:13 - parameter so let me just save this file
04:15 - now and try running this code so we are
04:17 - getting 1 up to 10 over here now guys we
04:19 - know that on the A1 indices over here we
04:22 - have the odd numbers so let's say if you
04:24 - want to print all the odd numbers over
04:26 - here which is at the step two so what we
04:28 - can do is we provide 0 and then colon we
04:31 - don't have to provide the stop parameter
04:33 - since we want all the elements to be
04:35 - included and then we have to provide
04:36 - colon once again and this time we will
04:39 - be providing step parameter S2 guys by
04:41 - default the step parameter is 1 so that
04:43 - all the elements are displayed but when
04:46 - we provide two so over here the first
04:48 - index is 0 which means first element
04:50 - over here that is 1 will be displayed
04:52 - and then since the step is to the second
04:54 - element will be ignored and 3 will be
04:56 - displayed and then again the fourth
04:58 - element will be ignored and 5 will be
05:00 - displayed and so on based on this step
05:02 - the elements will be displayed so let me
05:04 - just save this file now and try running
05:06 - this code so as you can see all the odd
05:09 - numbers are getting displayed now in
05:10 - case we want to display the even numbers
05:12 - which starts from the index 1 over here
05:15 - so we just change this start parameter
05:17 - to 1 over here in this case so let me
05:19 - just save this file now and try running
05:21 - this code so as you can see we are
05:23 - getting all the even numbers now guys
05:25 - let's say we want to start in the first
05:27 - index that is we want to ignore the
05:29 - first number over here we are starting
05:30 - from the first index and we want to go
05:32 - up to the second last number over here
05:35 - and we want to ignore the last number so
05:37 - as the stop parameter what we can do is
05:39 - we can simply remove the step parameter
05:41 - over here and for the Stop parameter we
05:43 - can provide the index of the last
05:45 - element so that it is not included so
05:48 - the index of the last element is
05:49 - negative one so list slicing also
05:52 - supports the negative indices over here
05:54 - which means before this 0 the minus 1
05:57 - will be referred to the last element
05:58 - over here then minus S2 will be referred
06:01 - to the second last element and so on the
06:03 - negative indices will be representing
06:05 - the elements from the reverse of the
06:07 - list now guys what we can do is simply
06:09 - save this file now and try running this
06:11 - code so as you can see the numbers 2 3 4
06:13 - up to 9 are getting displayed the first
06:16 - number and the last number is ignored
06:18 - over here now guys there is a very
06:19 - important feature of less slicing which
06:21 - can be used in order to reverse the
06:23 - entire list so what we can do is instead
06:26 - of providing the start and stop
06:27 - parameter we will ignore them we will
06:30 - only provide the step parameter over
06:31 - here that is the third parameter in this
06:34 - case which will be negative 1 so we
06:36 - provide two colons over here and then
06:39 - followed by negative one so let us see
06:41 - what happens over here so when we
06:42 - provide two colons and Then followed by
06:45 - negative one over here we should get the
06:47 - reverse of this list over here it is 10
06:49 - 9 8 and then up to 1 in this case so let
06:52 - me just save this file now and try
06:54 - running this code so as you can see we
06:55 - are getting the list that is in the
06:57 - reverse order that is 10 9 8 7 and then
07:00 - up to one so guys this is one of the
07:02 - important features of less slicing if
07:04 - you want to reverse the list you can use
07:06 - the list slicing feature in such a way
07:08 - that you don't provide the start and
07:10 - stop parameter but you provide the step
07:12 - parameter as negative 1 in this case
07:14 - what happens when we provide negative 2
07:16 - over here so let us check that when we
07:18 - save this file now and try running this
07:20 - code as you can see the numbers in
07:22 - between will be ignored so the first
07:24 - number is considered that is 10 and then
07:26 - 9 will be ignored and then 8 will be
07:28 - considered 7 will be ignored and then 6
07:30 - will be considered and so on all the
07:32 - even numbers in the reverse order are
07:35 - getting printed over here we can also
07:37 - display the odd numbers in the same way
07:38 - that is in the reverse order by
07:40 - providing minus 2 as the start parameter
07:43 - over here so minus 2 which means it will
07:45 - start from 9 and then with the step
07:47 - parameter of minus 2 it will go to 7 and
07:50 - then 5 and then 3 and then one so let me
07:52 - just save this file now and try running
07:54 - this code so as you can see we are
07:56 - getting the odd numbers in the reverse
07:58 - order so guys practice on your own so
07:59 - that on different inputs you get
08:01 - different outputs please make sure that

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to slice list so guys basically slicing of the list means we are finding the subset of the entire list we are going to include only a part of the list from the entire list and that is the process that we call list slicing so the format for this slicing is in such a way as you can see inside the open and close square brackets we have three parameters the first parameter is the start parameter from where we have to provide the index which is the index from where we want to start the elements to be included and then the second parameter is the stop parameter this is the index where the list slicing will stop and then the third parameter is the step which will help us in order to implement the gaps if we want to ignore some of the elements in between so guys all these three parameters are separated by a colon over here as you can see and this is the format of the list slicing so this is the description the start is the index of the list where slicing starts and then the stop is the index of the list where slicing ends and then we have step which allows you to select the nth item within the range start to stop so as you can see this is the example if we have the list which contains one two three four five as the elements inside the list and we only want to include the second and third index which means three and four so we can basically have the list slicing in this way that we need to provide the name of the list and then inside the open and close square brackets we have the start that is 2 over here so this means from index 2 that is 0 1 and then 2 so the element 3 will be included and then it will go up to index 4 so this is index 2 and then this is index 3 and this is index four so these three elements out of which the stock part that is the fourth index will not be included over here so only three and four will be included so guys it is important to note that whatever index we provide as the stop index over here that element will not be loaded and then in this case we have just ignored the step so all the elements in between will be included so guys let us check this with the help of examples now over here so basically we are going to define the list so let's say we have list one it is equal to 1 2 3 4 5. so Guys these are the elements inside the list now guys what do we want is we want to print only 3 and 4 which means 0 1 2 that is the second and third index so what we have to do is inside the print statement we provide list one and then with open and close square brackets either you can access just one element so let's say if you want to access this element that is 3 we can provide 2 over here that is the index number in order to access this element that is three so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see three is getting printed over here but what if we want to print 3 and 4 in this case so over here we will have list slicing so after this second index we have colon and then we you have to provide the stop index which is this element over here which is at the fourth index so over here we provide four guys remember that it will include only three and four the fourth index will not be included because the stock index is not included over here by implementing the list slicing so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting three and then four now guys let's say I want to access all the elements after three so what we can do is we don't have to provide the stop parameter so over here we provide two that is the index of this element that is 3 and then after colon we don't provide anything so all the elements after the second index will be included in this case it will be three four five so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting three four five now guys let me just change the content of the list we will provide the numbers over here from 1 to 10 so we have 7 8 9 and then we have 10 so top 10 numbers over here let me just save this file now and try running this code as you can can see we are getting the numbers from 3 up to 10 over here and that is how we have done the less slicing now guys let's say we want all the numbers so what we can do is simply we can provide 0 over here and then colon and then no stop and step parameter so let me just save this file now and try running this code so we are getting 1 up to 10 over here now guys we know that on the A1 indices over here we have the odd numbers so let's say if you want to print all the odd numbers over here which is at the step two so what we can do is we provide 0 and then colon we don't have to provide the stop parameter since we want all the elements to be included and then we have to provide colon once again and this time we will be providing step parameter S2 guys by default the step parameter is 1 so that all the elements are displayed but when we provide two so over here the first index is 0 which means first element over here that is 1 will be displayed and then since the step is to the second element will be ignored and 3 will be displayed and then again the fourth element will be ignored and 5 will be displayed and so on based on this step the elements will be displayed so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see all the odd numbers are getting displayed now in case we want to display the even numbers which starts from the index 1 over here so we just change this start parameter to 1 over here in this case so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting all the even numbers now guys let's say we want to start in the first index that is we want to ignore the first number over here we are starting from the first index and we want to go up to the second last number over here and we want to ignore the last number so as the stop parameter what we can do is we can simply remove the step parameter over here and for the Stop parameter we can provide the index of the last element so that it is not included so the index of the last element is negative one so list slicing also supports the negative indices over here which means before this 0 the minus 1 will be referred to the last element over here then minus S2 will be referred to the second last element and so on the negative indices will be representing the elements from the reverse of the list now guys what we can do is simply save this file now and try running this code so as you can see the numbers 2 3 4 up to 9 are getting displayed the first number and the last number is ignored over here now guys there is a very important feature of less slicing which can be used in order to reverse the entire list so what we can do is instead of providing the start and stop parameter we will ignore them we will only provide the step parameter over here that is the third parameter in this case which will be negative 1 so we provide two colons over here and then followed by negative one so let us see what happens over here so when we provide two colons and Then followed by negative one over here we should get the reverse of this list over here it is 10 9 8 and then up to 1 in this case so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting the list that is in the reverse order that is 10 9 8 7 and then up to one so guys this is one of the important features of less slicing if you want to reverse the list you can use the list slicing feature in such a way that you don't provide the start and stop parameter but you provide the step parameter as negative 1 in this case what happens when we provide negative 2 over here so let us check that when we save this file now and try running this code as you can see the numbers in between will be ignored so the first number is considered that is 10 and then 9 will be ignored and then 8 will be considered 7 will be ignored and then 6 will be considered and so on all the even numbers in the reverse order are getting printed over here we can also display the odd numbers in the same way that is in the reverse order by providing minus 2 as the start parameter over here so minus 2 which means it will start from 9 and then with the step parameter of minus 2 it will go to 7 and then 5 and then 3 and then one so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting the odd numbers in the reverse order so guys practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is Python program to flatten unnested list so stay tuned
