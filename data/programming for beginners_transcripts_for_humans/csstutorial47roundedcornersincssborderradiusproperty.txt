00:00 - so now we will see rounded Corners in
00:02 - CSS so guys basically in CSS the Border
00:05 - radius property can be used in order to
00:08 - provide the rounded Corners to the HTML
00:11 - elements and this we are going to check
00:13 - with the help of examples as well
00:15 - remember that we can easily use the
00:16 - Border radius property and provide
00:18 - certain length unit in order to provide
00:21 - the rounded Corners to the HTML element
00:24 - so guys let us check the example with
00:26 - the help of the div element that is
00:27 - having the background color over here so
00:30 - simply I'm going to remove the previous
00:31 - lines from the style. CSS and the HTML
00:34 - file over here now guys what we will do
00:36 - is simply we are going to have the diff
00:38 - tag and inside the diff tag we are going
00:40 - to say this is a sample HTML
00:45 - element so guys basically we have this
00:48 - very simple statement that is this is a
00:50 - sample HTML element over here now guys
00:52 - let me just save this file now and try
00:54 - reloading this page once again on the
00:56 - browser so as you can see we have this
00:58 - is a sample HTML element which is inside
01:00 - the diff tag now guys let us provide
01:02 - certain CSS properties over here to the
01:05 - diff tag so inside the style. CSS file
01:08 - we will be having the diff tag over here
01:10 - and for this diff tag we are going to
01:12 - have the background color so let's say
01:14 - we are going to set the color as yellow
01:16 - over here and then apart from this we
01:18 - will also set the border so border width
01:21 - will be two pixels over here apart from
01:23 - this the Border style will be solid and
01:25 - the color will be black in this case and
01:27 - let us also provide certain paddings so
01:30 - let's say we provide five pixels of
01:31 - padding over here let me just save this
01:33 - file now and try reloading this page
01:35 - once again on the browser so as you can
01:37 - see we have the yellow background color
01:40 - and also the border that is getting
01:41 - displayed for this particular div
01:43 - element now guys since the div element
01:45 - is the Block Level element that is why
01:47 - it is taking the entire width of the
01:49 - screen so guys what we can do is simply
01:52 - we are going to say display it is equal
01:54 - to in line so that the div element only
01:57 - takes the width that is required by the
01:59 - content of this Dev element so over here
02:02 - we will say display it is equal to in
02:04 - line so let me just save this file now
02:06 - and try reloading this page so as you
02:08 - can see we have the div element that is
02:10 - taking only that much width which is
02:13 - required by the content of the div
02:14 - element now simply we can use the Border
02:17 - radius property over here in order to
02:19 - provide the rounded corners for this
02:21 - HTML element that is the diff tag so
02:24 - simply we can provide the length unit of
02:26 - let's say 5 pixels over here so guys
02:28 - border radius is the CSS property that
02:30 - we can use and the length unit that we
02:32 - are using right now is 5 pixels let me
02:34 - just save this file now and try
02:36 - reloading this page once again on the
02:38 - browser as you can see we have certain
02:40 - rounded Corners over here let me just
02:42 - zoom in little bit so as you can see
02:44 - these are the rounded Corners that are
02:45 - implemented for this particular Dev tag
02:48 - if we remove this border radius property
02:50 - let me just save this file now so
02:52 - currently there are no rounded corners
02:54 - but when we provide the Border radius
02:56 - CSS property along with certain value
02:58 - over here so when we reload this page as
03:00 - you can see these are the rounded
03:02 - Corners let me just increase the value
03:04 - to 10 pixels over here let me just save
03:06 - this file now and try reloading this
03:08 - page so as you can see these are the
03:09 - rounded Corners that can be displayed
03:12 - for this particular HTML element so guys
03:14 - in this way you can easily use the
03:16 - Border radius CSS property in order to
03:18 - have the rounded Corners over here guys
03:21 - apart from this we can also use the
03:23 - value in terms of percentage for the
03:25 - Border radius so guys let's say we
03:27 - provide 10% of Border r radius in this
03:30 - case so let me just save this file now
03:32 - and try reloading this page once again
03:34 - on the browser so this is the 10% border
03:36 - radius that you can see over here
03:38 - similarly if you provide 50% of Border
03:41 - radius what will happen so guys let me
03:43 - just save this file now and try
03:45 - reloading this page once again on the
03:46 - browser so as you can see this is the
03:48 - 50% value for the Border radius that we
03:51 - have provided now guys you can also make
03:53 - a circle over here for a particular div
03:55 - element in this case now guys you can
03:57 - also create a circle by using the B
04:00 - radius with the help of the diff tag
04:02 - over here but in that case you need to
04:04 - provide the width and height of the diff
04:06 - tag in such a way that both the width
04:08 - and the height must be equal so guys let
04:10 - us check that as well so what we are
04:12 - going to do is simply we will say width
04:14 - it is equal to 100 pixels and height it
04:17 - is again equal to 100 pixels over here
04:19 - and apart from this we will remove this
04:21 - property that is display it is equal to
04:23 - inline right now and then let us
04:25 - decrease some text over here so simply
04:28 - we are going to say the word that is div
04:30 - in this case let me just save this file
04:31 - now and try reloading this page once
04:33 - again on the browser so as you can see
04:36 - this is a circle that is getting
04:37 - implemented right now let us remove this
04:40 - text from the diff tag over here and
04:42 - guys this circle is Possible only when
04:44 - you provide the Border radius it is
04:46 - equal to 50% when you make it as 40% it
04:49 - won't be the perfect circle let me just
04:51 - save this file now and try reloading
04:53 - this page once again on the browser so
04:55 - as you can see it is not a perfect
04:57 - circle right now when we remove the
04:58 - Border radius there will be no rounded
05:01 - Corners right now and it will be simply
05:03 - a square since we have provided the
05:05 - width and height which is having the
05:06 - same value that is 100 pixels let me
05:08 - just save this file now and try
05:10 - reloading this page so as you can see
05:12 - this is a square that is getting
05:13 - displayed right now with the help of the
05:15 - div tag but when we provide the Border
05:17 - radius of 50% it will be the circle that
05:21 - will be displayed on the web browser so
05:23 - let me just save this file now and try
05:24 - reloading this page once again on the
05:26 - browser so this is the circle that is
05:28 - getting displayed on the web browser so
05:30 - guys in this way if you want a circle or
05:32 - the rounded corners for the HTML
05:34 - elements based on your project
05:36 - requirements you can use the Border
05:38 - radius property inside the style. CSS

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see rounded Corners in CSS so guys basically in CSS the Border radius property can be used in order to provide the rounded Corners to the HTML elements and this we are going to check with the help of examples as well remember that we can easily use the Border radius property and provide certain length unit in order to provide the rounded Corners to the HTML element so guys let us check the example with the help of the div element that is having the background color over here so simply I'm going to remove the previous lines from the style. CSS and the HTML file over here now guys what we will do is simply we are going to have the diff tag and inside the diff tag we are going to say this is a sample HTML element so guys basically we have this very simple statement that is this is a sample HTML element over here now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have this is a sample HTML element which is inside the diff tag now guys let us provide certain CSS properties over here to the diff tag so inside the style. CSS file we will be having the diff tag over here and for this diff tag we are going to have the background color so let's say we are going to set the color as yellow over here and then apart from this we will also set the border so border width will be two pixels over here apart from this the Border style will be solid and the color will be black in this case and let us also provide certain paddings so let's say we provide five pixels of padding over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the yellow background color and also the border that is getting displayed for this particular div element now guys since the div element is the Block Level element that is why it is taking the entire width of the screen so guys what we can do is simply we are going to say display it is equal to in line so that the div element only takes the width that is required by the content of this Dev element so over here we will say display it is equal to in line so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see we have the div element that is taking only that much width which is required by the content of the div element now simply we can use the Border radius property over here in order to provide the rounded corners for this HTML element that is the diff tag so simply we can provide the length unit of let's say 5 pixels over here so guys border radius is the CSS property that we can use and the length unit that we are using right now is 5 pixels let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see we have certain rounded Corners over here let me just zoom in little bit so as you can see these are the rounded Corners that are implemented for this particular Dev tag if we remove this border radius property let me just save this file now so currently there are no rounded corners but when we provide the Border radius CSS property along with certain value over here so when we reload this page as you can see these are the rounded Corners let me just increase the value to 10 pixels over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see these are the rounded Corners that can be displayed for this particular HTML element so guys in this way you can easily use the Border radius CSS property in order to have the rounded Corners over here guys apart from this we can also use the value in terms of percentage for the Border radius so guys let's say we provide 10% of Border r radius in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so this is the 10% border radius that you can see over here similarly if you provide 50% of Border radius what will happen so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is the 50% value for the Border radius that we have provided now guys you can also make a circle over here for a particular div element in this case now guys you can also create a circle by using the B radius with the help of the diff tag over here but in that case you need to provide the width and height of the diff tag in such a way that both the width and the height must be equal so guys let us check that as well so what we are going to do is simply we will say width it is equal to 100 pixels and height it is again equal to 100 pixels over here and apart from this we will remove this property that is display it is equal to inline right now and then let us decrease some text over here so simply we are going to say the word that is div in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is a circle that is getting implemented right now let us remove this text from the diff tag over here and guys this circle is Possible only when you provide the Border radius it is equal to 50% when you make it as 40% it won't be the perfect circle let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see it is not a perfect circle right now when we remove the Border radius there will be no rounded Corners right now and it will be simply a square since we have provided the width and height which is having the same value that is 100 pixels let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see this is a square that is getting displayed right now with the help of the div tag but when we provide the Border radius of 50% it will be the circle that will be displayed on the web browser so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so this is the circle that is getting displayed on the web browser so guys in this way if you want a circle or the rounded corners for the HTML elements based on your project requirements you can use the Border radius property inside the style.
