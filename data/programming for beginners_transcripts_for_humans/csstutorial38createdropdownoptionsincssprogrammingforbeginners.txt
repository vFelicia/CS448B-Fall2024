00:00 - so now we will see how we can create the
00:02 - drop- down options in CSS so guys
00:05 - basically we are going to create a
00:07 - hoverable drop down with the help of the
00:10 - CSS and the drop down options should be
00:13 - displayed when the mouse is hovered over
00:15 - a button so guys let us check this with
00:17 - the help of examples in vs code over
00:19 - here so simply I'm going to remove the
00:21 - previous lines of code that we had
00:23 - written in the HTML and the CSS files
00:26 - over here now guys as far as the drop
00:29 - down option is concerned simply you can
00:31 - have the select tag over here and inside
00:34 - the select tag you can have multiple
00:36 - options in this case so let's say we
00:38 - have one of the option as option one
00:41 - over here so simply we are going to say
00:43 - one in this case and then you can copy
00:45 - paste this line of code and then we can
00:48 - change the text to the other options
00:51 - over here so we have the two so we have
00:54 - the second option is two and the third
00:56 - option is three over here so guys
00:58 - basically you can simply have the drop
00:59 - drop down options with the help of the
01:01 - HTML tag that is the select and the
01:04 - option tags over here let me just save
01:06 - this file now and try reloading this
01:08 - page on the browser so as you can see we
01:11 - have these drop- down options over here
01:13 - but guys we are going to implement the
01:15 - drop down options by using the CSS in
01:18 - this case instead of using the select
01:20 - and the option tags over here so what we
01:23 - are going to do is we are going to
01:25 - Define certain diff tags over here and a
01:28 - button tag as well and using the CSS
01:30 - file over here and certain CSS
01:33 - properties we are going to display these
01:35 - options when we get the mouse cursor on
01:37 - that particular button that we are going
01:39 - to Define so guys let us complete this
01:41 - exercise over here so simply we are
01:44 - going to have let's say the h2 tag over
01:46 - here and then we will say get your mouse
01:50 - cursor on below button so guys simply we
01:53 - are having this particular statement
01:55 - that is get your mouse cursor on below
01:57 - button over here and we are going to
01:59 - Define the diff tag in this casee which
02:02 - is going to have the class name as drop
02:04 - down over here so simply we are going to
02:06 - define the diff tag followed by the dot
02:08 - character and then we have the name of
02:10 - the class that is dropped down and when
02:12 - we press enter as you can see a diff tag
02:14 - with the class name that is drop down is
02:17 - getting created over here now guys
02:19 - inside this we are going to have the
02:21 - button tag over here and for this button
02:23 - tag we are going to say drop down as the
02:26 - text and then guys over here we are
02:28 - going to have the class and the class
02:30 - name will be button drop down in this
02:33 - case guys we are going to make use of
02:35 - these class names inside the CSS files
02:38 - and that is why we are defining these
02:39 - classes over here and it is one of the
02:41 - best practices in order to create the
02:44 - classes or the IDS for the different
02:46 - HTML elements that you create based on
02:49 - your requirements now guys apart from
02:51 - this after this button we are going to
02:53 - have another diff tag over here and then
02:56 - we are going to have the class name in
02:58 - this case as the drop down cont content
03:00 - so guys basically this is the diff tag
03:02 - which is going to display the drop-down
03:05 - content that is all the options as you
03:07 - can see these are the options that will
03:09 - be present inside this particular diff
03:11 - tag over here so guys inside this what
03:14 - we will do is we will have the anchor
03:16 - tags in this case so we are going to
03:18 - have the HF attribute as the hash
03:21 - character and simply we are going to
03:23 - provide link one over here and then we
03:25 - are going to copy paste these lines of
03:27 - code and simply we are going to say link
03:29 - 2 and Link three so guys basically what
03:32 - we are doing is we are having three
03:34 - options over here inside the diff that
03:37 - is defining the drop- down content in
03:39 - this case so guys let me just save this
03:41 - file now and try reloading this page
03:43 - once again on the browser so as you can
03:45 - see we have the h2 tag over here which
03:47 - is having the simple statement get your
03:49 - mouse cursor on below button so guys
03:52 - when we get the mouse cursor on this
03:54 - particular button over here all these
03:56 - link items that are the options should
03:58 - get displayed in this case so guys let
04:00 - us provide certain CSS properties to
04:03 - this button element first of all so what
04:05 - we are going to do is we will copy the
04:07 - class of this button over here and
04:10 - simply inside the style. CSS file we are
04:12 - going to use the dot character followed
04:14 - by the name of the class in this case so
04:17 - guys basically we are going to have
04:19 - certain background color so let's say we
04:21 - have the background color over here and
04:24 - the text color as white so guys
04:26 - basically we have the color CSS property
04:28 - as white over here and also we will have
04:31 - the padding of let's say 10 pixels in
04:33 - this case let me just save this file now
04:35 - and try reloading this page once again
04:37 - on the browser so as you can see we have
04:39 - this particular button with the
04:41 - background color that is green and the
04:43 - text color is white and we have certain
04:45 - padding that we have implemented over
04:47 - here guys there is a default border that
04:49 - is getting displayed over here so what
04:51 - we are going to do is simply inside this
04:53 - button we are going to say border it is
04:56 - equal to none so that we can remove this
04:58 - border from this button let me just save
05:00 - this file now and try reloading this
05:02 - page once again on the browser so as you
05:04 - can see we don't have any border right
05:06 - now over here now guys what we are going
05:07 - to do is these link items are present in
05:10 - one line we want them to be on the
05:12 - separate lines over here and also we
05:15 - want the div section that is the drop-
05:17 - down content it should have certain
05:19 - background color so guys what we are
05:21 - going to do is first of all we are going
05:23 - to style this drop- down content diff
05:25 - tag over here so simply I'm going to
05:27 - copy this class name and then inside the
05:30 - CSS file we are going to provide the dot
05:32 - character followed by the class name
05:34 - over here and then we are going to
05:36 - provide the background color in this
05:38 - case so let's say we provide the gray
05:40 - color as the background color over here
05:42 - so guys we have the 6 * D characters in
05:45 - this case which is representing a gray
05:48 - color shade over here and then apart
05:50 - from this we also want the width of this
05:52 - particular section to be limited so we
05:55 - are going to provide the width is 100
05:57 - pixels in this case let me just save
05:59 - this file now and try reloading this
06:00 - page once again on the browser so as you
06:02 - can see we have the background color as
06:04 - the gray color over here but guys apart
06:06 - from this we also want these links to be
06:08 - present on the next line so what we can
06:11 - do is simply inside this class name so
06:13 - we are going to provide dot followed by
06:15 - the class name and whatever a tags are
06:17 - present we are going to provide the
06:19 - anchor tag over here and then inside
06:22 - this we are going to say display is
06:24 - equal to block so guys by default the
06:27 - display properties is in line for this
06:29 - particular anchor tag and that is why
06:31 - all the links are getting displayed on
06:33 - the same line so we are going to provide
06:36 - displays equal to block so that all of
06:38 - them are displayed on separate lines
06:40 - over here so let me just save this file
06:42 - now and try reloading this page once
06:44 - again on the browser so as you can see
06:46 - all the links are now getting displayed
06:48 - on the separate lines apart from this
06:50 - let us remove the underline as well from
06:52 - these anchor tags so we will provide the
06:55 - text decoration is equal to none in this
06:58 - case and also apart from this let us
07:00 - provide the color of this text as black
07:03 - color over here so we are going to
07:04 - provide the color as black and also
07:07 - provide the padding so guys over here
07:09 - simply we are going to provide the
07:10 - padding as 5 pixels let me just save
07:13 - this file now and try reloading this
07:15 - page so as you can see we have the
07:17 - padding also we have removed the
07:18 - underline over here and we have the text
07:21 - color as black color right now now guys
07:23 - apart from this when the user gets the
07:25 - cursor on these particular links we want
07:27 - the background color to be updated for
07:29 - these links so what we can do is simply
07:32 - on the hover property of these a tag we
07:34 - can change the background color so
07:36 - simply I'm going to copy these lines of
07:38 - code and paste it over here but we are
07:41 - going to provide the sudo class in this
07:43 - case which is the over sudo class and on
07:45 - this hover Udo class we want to change
07:48 - the background color so simply we are
07:49 - going to say background color in this
07:51 - case and let's say we have the
07:53 - background color as Aqua so guys
07:55 - basically we are going to set this
07:56 - particular background color when the
07:58 - user gets the the mouse on that
08:00 - particular link text so let me just save
08:02 - this file now and try reloading this
08:04 - page once again on the browser so now
08:06 - when we get the cursor over here on
08:08 - these links that is the options the
08:10 - background color of that particular
08:12 - option is now getting updated now now
08:15 - guys very important thing is when we get
08:17 - the mouse cursor on this drop- down then
08:19 - only we want this particular section to
08:22 - be displayed that is having the list of
08:24 - options so by default all these list of
08:27 - options should be hidden over here so
08:29 - what we can do is simply for this
08:31 - particular drop- down content class we
08:34 - are going to define the display is equal
08:36 - to nonone property so over here we
08:38 - already have this drop- down content
08:40 - inside our CSS file so simply we are
08:43 - going to say display is equal to none
08:45 - this time so guys basically by default
08:48 - this particular diff tag that is having
08:50 - the class that is drop down content will
08:52 - not be displayed over here so let me
08:54 - just save this file now and try
08:55 - reloading this page once again on the
08:57 - browser so as you can see after finding
08:59 - all the CSS properties we have set the
09:02 - display is equal to none property so by
09:04 - default this particular section which is
09:06 - present over here right now but it is
09:08 - not getting visible and we want it to be
09:11 - visible when we get the mouse cursor on
09:13 - this drop down button over here so guys
09:15 - how do we make it visible so basically
09:17 - we are going to set the display is equal
09:19 - to block property when we get the mouse
09:22 - cursor on this particular diff tag over
09:24 - here so what is the diff tag in this
09:26 - case so it is the diff tag that is
09:28 - having the class equal to drop down so
09:30 - simply I'm going to copy this class that
09:32 - is dropped down over here and then
09:33 - inside the style. CSS file simply we are
09:36 - going to say dot followed by the name of
09:38 - the class that is dropped down and when
09:40 - we get the mouse cursor on this
09:43 - particular diff tag we are going to
09:45 - provide the hover codo class over here
09:48 - so basically it says that whenever we
09:50 - are going to get the mouse cursor on the
09:53 - diff tag that is having the class drop
09:55 - down over here then these particular CSS
09:57 - properties will be implement Ed so what
10:00 - we want to do is we want to make the
10:02 - drop- down content as visible so guys
10:05 - when we hover over this particular diff
10:07 - tag we want the drop- down content that
10:10 - is this particular diff to be visible
10:12 - over here so we need to copy this class
10:14 - name that is drop down content over here
10:17 - and after this H we need to provide the
10:19 - space character and the div that is with
10:22 - this particular class name should be
10:24 - displayed so we need to provide the dot
10:26 - character since it is a class name and
10:28 - then inside this we we are going to say
10:30 - display it is equal to block this time
10:32 - so guys by default it was display is
10:34 - equal to none but when we get the mouse
10:37 - cursor on this particular diff tag that
10:39 - is having the class drop down so on the
10:41 - hover sudo class we want to get the
10:44 - drop- down content to be displayed over
10:46 - here with the help of the display equal
10:48 - to blog so let me just save this file
10:50 - now and try reloading this page once
10:52 - again on the browser so by default there
10:54 - is no drop down that you can see over
10:56 - here but the moment we get the mouse
10:58 - cursor on this drop drop down button
11:00 - over here you can see that the drop-
11:02 - down content is now getting displayed
11:04 - over here now guys if you notice when we
11:06 - get the mouse cursor over here as well
11:08 - on the right hand side the drop- down
11:10 - content is again getting displayed why
11:12 - so that's because we have provided the
11:15 - display equal to block on the drop- down
11:17 - class which is the diff tag over here
11:19 - and as you know the diff tag is the
11:21 - Block Level element so let us right
11:23 - click over here and click on the inspect
11:25 - option let us see the length of the diff
11:28 - tag over here so as you can see this is
11:30 - the diff tag with the class drop down on
11:32 - which we have provided the hover
11:34 - property and and if you see the entire
11:36 - width of the screen is getting
11:38 - highlighted over here so guys what we
11:40 - can do is simply for this particular
11:42 - diff tag that is having the class drop
11:44 - down we can have the display property as
11:47 - in line so simply we are going to go
11:49 - inside the style. CSS file over here and
11:52 - for this class that is the drop down
11:54 - over here we are going to provide the
11:56 - dot character followed by the class name
11:58 - that is drop down and simply we are
12:00 - going to say display is equal to in line
12:03 - so basically it is going to take only
12:05 - that much width as required by the text
12:08 - inside this particular diff tag over
12:10 - here let me just save this file now and
12:12 - try reloading this page once again on
12:14 - the browser so now if you see the drop
12:16 - down diff tag it is not taking the
12:18 - entire width of the screen but it is
12:21 - only taking the width of the button that
12:23 - is present over here right now so guys
12:25 - when we get the mouse cursor over here
12:27 - as you can see we are getting the drop
12:29 - down content that is getting visible
12:31 - right now but when we get the mouse
12:33 - cursor on the right hand side now there
12:35 - is no drop- down content that is getting
12:37 - displayed so guys only when you get the
12:39 - mouse cursor on this particular button
12:42 - then only the drop- down content that is
12:44 - having the list of options to be
12:46 - selected will be displayed over here so
12:49 - guys this is the way that you can
12:50 - implement the drop down options by using
12:52 - CSS properties comment in the comment

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see how we can create the drop down options in CSS so guys basically we are going to create a hoverable drop down with the help of the CSS and the drop down options should be displayed when the mouse is hovered over a button so guys let us check this with the help of examples in vs code over here so simply I'm going to remove the previous lines of code that we had written in the HTML and the CSS files over here now guys as far as the drop down option is concerned simply you can have the select tag over here and inside the select tag you can have multiple options in this case so let's say we have one of the option as option one over here so simply we are going to say one in this case and then you can copy paste this line of code and then we can change the text to the other options over here so we have the two so we have the second option is two and the third option is three over here so guys basically you can simply have the drop drop down options with the help of the HTML tag that is the select and the option tags over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have these drop down options over here but guys we are going to implement the drop down options by using the CSS in this case instead of using the select and the option tags over here so what we are going to do is we are going to Define certain diff tags over here and a button tag as well and using the CSS file over here and certain CSS properties we are going to display these options when we get the mouse cursor on that particular button that we are going to Define so guys let us complete this exercise over here so simply we are going to have let's say the h2 tag over here and then we will say get your mouse cursor on below button so guys simply we are having this particular statement that is get your mouse cursor on below button over here and we are going to Define the diff tag in this casee which is going to have the class name as drop down over here so simply we are going to define the diff tag followed by the dot character and then we have the name of the class that is dropped down and when we press enter as you can see a diff tag with the class name that is drop down is getting created over here now guys inside this we are going to have the button tag over here and for this button tag we are going to say drop down as the text and then guys over here we are going to have the class and the class name will be button drop down in this case guys we are going to make use of these class names inside the CSS files and that is why we are defining these classes over here and it is one of the best practices in order to create the classes or the IDS for the different HTML elements that you create based on your requirements now guys apart from this after this button we are going to have another diff tag over here and then we are going to have the class name in this case as the drop down cont content so guys basically this is the diff tag which is going to display the dropdown content that is all the options as you can see these are the options that will be present inside this particular diff tag over here so guys inside this what we will do is we will have the anchor tags in this case so we are going to have the HF attribute as the hash character and simply we are going to provide link one over here and then we are going to copy paste these lines of code and simply we are going to say link 2 and Link three so guys basically what we are doing is we are having three options over here inside the diff that is defining the drop down content in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the h2 tag over here which is having the simple statement get your mouse cursor on below button so guys when we get the mouse cursor on this particular button over here all these link items that are the options should get displayed in this case so guys let us provide certain CSS properties to this button element first of all so what we are going to do is we will copy the class of this button over here and simply inside the style. CSS file we are going to use the dot character followed by the name of the class in this case so guys basically we are going to have certain background color so let's say we have the background color over here and the text color as white so guys basically we have the color CSS property as white over here and also we will have the padding of let's say 10 pixels in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have this particular button with the background color that is green and the text color is white and we have certain padding that we have implemented over here guys there is a default border that is getting displayed over here so what we are going to do is simply inside this button we are going to say border it is equal to none so that we can remove this border from this button let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we don't have any border right now over here now guys what we are going to do is these link items are present in one line we want them to be on the separate lines over here and also we want the div section that is the drop down content it should have certain background color so guys what we are going to do is first of all we are going to style this drop down content diff tag over here so simply I'm going to copy this class name and then inside the CSS file we are going to provide the dot character followed by the class name over here and then we are going to provide the background color in this case so let's say we provide the gray color as the background color over here so guys we have the 6 * D characters in this case which is representing a gray color shade over here and then apart from this we also want the width of this particular section to be limited so we are going to provide the width is 100 pixels in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the background color as the gray color over here but guys apart from this we also want these links to be present on the next line so what we can do is simply inside this class name so we are going to provide dot followed by the class name and whatever a tags are present we are going to provide the anchor tag over here and then inside this we are going to say display is equal to block so guys by default the display properties is in line for this particular anchor tag and that is why all the links are getting displayed on the same line so we are going to provide displays equal to block so that all of them are displayed on separate lines over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see all the links are now getting displayed on the separate lines apart from this let us remove the underline as well from these anchor tags so we will provide the text decoration is equal to none in this case and also apart from this let us provide the color of this text as black color over here so we are going to provide the color as black and also provide the padding so guys over here simply we are going to provide the padding as 5 pixels let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see we have the padding also we have removed the underline over here and we have the text color as black color right now now guys apart from this when the user gets the cursor on these particular links we want the background color to be updated for these links so what we can do is simply on the hover property of these a tag we can change the background color so simply I'm going to copy these lines of code and paste it over here but we are going to provide the sudo class in this case which is the over sudo class and on this hover Udo class we want to change the background color so simply we are going to say background color in this case and let's say we have the background color as Aqua so guys basically we are going to set this particular background color when the user gets the the mouse on that particular link text so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now when we get the cursor over here on these links that is the options the background color of that particular option is now getting updated now now guys very important thing is when we get the mouse cursor on this drop down then only we want this particular section to be displayed that is having the list of options so by default all these list of options should be hidden over here so what we can do is simply for this particular drop down content class we are going to define the display is equal to nonone property so over here we already have this drop down content inside our CSS file so simply we are going to say display is equal to none this time so guys basically by default this particular diff tag that is having the class that is drop down content will not be displayed over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see after finding all the CSS properties we have set the display is equal to none property so by default this particular section which is present over here right now but it is not getting visible and we want it to be visible when we get the mouse cursor on this drop down button over here so guys how do we make it visible so basically we are going to set the display is equal to block property when we get the mouse cursor on this particular diff tag over here so what is the diff tag in this case so it is the diff tag that is having the class equal to drop down so simply I'm going to copy this class that is dropped down over here and then inside the style. CSS file simply we are going to say dot followed by the name of the class that is dropped down and when we get the mouse cursor on this particular diff tag we are going to provide the hover codo class over here so basically it says that whenever we are going to get the mouse cursor on the diff tag that is having the class drop down over here then these particular CSS properties will be implement Ed so what we want to do is we want to make the drop down content as visible so guys when we hover over this particular diff tag we want the drop down content that is this particular diff to be visible over here so we need to copy this class name that is drop down content over here and after this H we need to provide the space character and the div that is with this particular class name should be displayed so we need to provide the dot character since it is a class name and then inside this we we are going to say display it is equal to block this time so guys by default it was display is equal to none but when we get the mouse cursor on this particular diff tag that is having the class drop down so on the hover sudo class we want to get the drop down content to be displayed over here with the help of the display equal to blog so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so by default there is no drop down that you can see over here but the moment we get the mouse cursor on this drop drop down button over here you can see that the drop down content is now getting displayed over here now guys if you notice when we get the mouse cursor over here as well on the right hand side the drop down content is again getting displayed why so that's because we have provided the display equal to block on the drop down class which is the diff tag over here and as you know the diff tag is the Block Level element so let us right click over here and click on the inspect option let us see the length of the diff tag over here so as you can see this is the diff tag with the class drop down on which we have provided the hover property and and if you see the entire width of the screen is getting highlighted over here so guys what we can do is simply for this particular diff tag that is having the class drop down we can have the display property as in line so simply we are going to go inside the style. CSS file over here and for this class that is the drop down over here we are going to provide the dot character followed by the class name that is drop down and simply we are going to say display is equal to in line so basically it is going to take only that much width as required by the text inside this particular diff tag over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now if you see the drop down diff tag it is not taking the entire width of the screen but it is only taking the width of the button that is present over here right now so guys when we get the mouse cursor over here as you can see we are getting the drop down content that is getting visible right now but when we get the mouse cursor on the right hand side now there is no drop down content that is getting displayed so guys only when you get the mouse cursor on this particular button then only the drop down content that is having the list of options to be selected will be displayed over here so guys this is the way that you can implement the drop down options by using CSS properties comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is attribute selectors in CSS so stay tuned
