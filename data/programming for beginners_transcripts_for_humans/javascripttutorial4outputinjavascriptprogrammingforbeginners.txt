With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see output in JavaScript
00:02 - so guys there are multiple ways in order
00:05 - to provide the output in JavaScript some
00:07 - of them we have already seen previously
00:09 - so let us go through them once again so
00:12 - guys first of all we have something
00:13 - called as inner HTML so guys let us
00:16 - check how we can use the inner HTML with
00:18 - the help of example over here so let me
00:21 - just remove the previous lines of code
00:22 - that we had written in the HTML and the
00:25 - JavaScript files in this case now guys
00:27 - simply inside the body tag of the HTML
00:30 - web page we are going to have the diff
00:33 - tag along with certain statement so let
00:35 - us say we have programming for beginners
00:38 - as the statement over here inside the
00:40 - diff tag which is the name of this
00:42 - YouTube channel that you should
00:43 - definitely subscribe in order to learn
00:45 - more about the JavaScript so guys this
00:47 - is a statement inside the diff tag over
00:49 - here and let us also provide the ID for
00:52 - this particular diff tag and we give the
00:54 - value as demo over here let me just save
00:56 - this file now and try reloading this
00:58 - page once again on the browser as you
01:00 - can see we have programming for
01:02 - beginners that is getting printed on the
01:04 - web page now guys what is the usage of
01:06 - this inner HTML so basically we find one
01:09 - of the HTML elements on the web page so
01:11 - let's say we have this HTML element that
01:14 - is having the value programming for
01:16 - beginners and we replace it with another
01:18 - statement over here inside this HTML
01:21 - element and this can be achieved by
01:23 - using the inner HTML property so guys
01:26 - let us check that how we can achieve it
01:29 - so inside the test.js file we need to
01:31 - provide our JavaScript code before which
01:33 - we need to link the Javascript file with
01:36 - this particular HTML file over here so
01:38 - simply we use the script tag along with
01:41 - the SRC attribute and we provide the
01:43 - name of the Javascript file that we are
01:45 - going to write that is test.js file now
01:48 - guys let me just provide the statement
01:50 - inside the test.js file over here so
01:53 - simply we will make use of the document
01:56 - followed by Dot and then we will say
01:58 - query selector so over here we are going
02:00 - to make use of the ID of the HTML
02:03 - element that is demo in this case so let
02:06 - me just copy this ID and inside the
02:08 - query selector inside the single code
02:10 - over here we need to provide the hash
02:12 - character since we are making use of the
02:15 - ID value of the HTML element and Then
02:18 - followed by the ID value over here so
02:21 - guys this particular statement will help
02:23 - us in order to identify the HTML element
02:26 - that we want to update so let us verify
02:28 - that by using the console.log statement
02:31 - over here so simply we enclose this
02:33 - entire statement that we had written
02:36 - inside the console.log statement in this
02:38 - case let me just save this file now and
02:40 - try reloading this page once again on
02:42 - the browser so as you can see on the
02:45 - right hand side under the console
02:46 - section of the web browser we can see
02:49 - the diff tag with the ID that is demo
02:51 - and then we have the programming for
02:53 - beginners string over here now guys we
02:55 - want to change the content of this
02:57 - particular diff tag so what we can do is
03:00 - simply we can make use of the inner HTML
03:02 - property which is one of the output
03:04 - statements in JavaScript so guys in this
03:07 - case simply inside the JavaScript code
03:10 - over here we are going to remove the
03:12 - console. log statement and then after we
03:14 - have identified the HTML element which
03:17 - we are getting over here on the console
03:19 - simply we are going to append dot
03:21 - followed by Inner HTML property so as
03:23 - you can see this is the property that we
03:25 - are going to use and Then followed by
03:28 - the assignment operator that is equal to
03:30 - operator over here and then inside the
03:32 - double or the single code we can provide
03:35 - our statement to be printed inside the
03:37 - def tag so simply we will say this is a
03:40 - diff tag updated by JavaScript so guys
03:45 - over here we have this updated statement
03:47 - this is a diff tag updated by JavaScript
03:50 - over here let me just save this file now
03:52 - and when we reload this page instead of
03:54 - having programming for beginners we will
03:56 - have this statement that is this is a
03:58 - diff tag up updated by JavaScript over
04:01 - here so let me just reload this page in
04:03 - this case so as you can see this is a
04:05 - div tag updated by JavaScript now guys
04:08 - in real case scenario we won't be having
04:10 - the inner HTML directly under the
04:13 - JavaScript code over here since it is
04:15 - updating the HTML element on the page
04:18 - load so basically we are going to have a
04:21 - button inside the HTML web page and when
04:23 - the user clicks on that particular
04:25 - button the JavaScript code that we have
04:27 - written over here in order to update the
04:29 - the statement will be called in order to
04:32 - update the content on the web page so
04:34 - guys we will check this in the upcoming
04:36 - sessions as well but this is a very
04:38 - simple example as far as the inner HTML
04:40 - property is concerned now guys apart
04:42 - from this we also have something called
04:44 - as document. right so over here what we
04:47 - can do is let me just comment out this
04:49 - line of code over here simply we can
04:51 - make use of control+ for/ as the
04:54 - keyboard shortcut in order to provide
04:56 - this particular single line command on
04:58 - the vs code now after this let me just
05:00 - save this file now we will have the
05:02 - original statement on the web browser so
05:04 - as you can see programming for beginners
05:06 - is getting printed over here that's
05:07 - because we have commented out this line
05:10 - of code which is not getting executed
05:12 - and comments are one of the best ways in
05:14 - order to provide certain instructions to
05:17 - other programmers when they are going to
05:18 - read your JavaScript code now guys let
05:21 - us try this particular statement that is
05:23 - document. WR now guys what is the
05:24 - meaning of this document. WR so guys
05:27 - basically it is going to add another St
05:29 - statement to your existing file over
05:31 - here inside the HTML so guys let us
05:34 - check that as well so over here what we
05:36 - will do is simply inside the Javascript
05:39 - file in this case we will provide
05:41 - document followed by Dot and then we
05:43 - will say write method over here and then
05:46 - inside the parenthesis we are going to
05:48 - either have double or single codes over
05:50 - here and then we will say new statement
05:52 - in this case so let me just save this
05:54 - file now and try reloading this page
05:56 - once again on the browser as you can see
05:58 - we have programming for big us and in
06:00 - this case we have the other line that is
06:02 - new statement over here which is added
06:04 - with the help of this document. write
06:06 - method in this case now guys it is very
06:08 - important to note that after loading the
06:11 - particular HTML web page you should not
06:13 - call this document. write function
06:16 - because it will replace the entire
06:18 - content of the web page so in order to
06:20 - understand this let us have couple of
06:22 - more diff tags over here and what we
06:24 - will do is simply I'm going to remove
06:26 - the ID attribute from these two D tag so
06:30 - we have these three div tags over here
06:32 - let me just save this file now and try
06:34 - reloading this web page once again on
06:35 - the browser so as you can see all these
06:38 - three statements are now getting printed
06:40 - now guys let us have button over here
06:41 - after the last diff tag in this case so
06:44 - simply we will have button with the text
06:47 - that is Click me over here let me just
06:48 - save this file now and when we reload
06:51 - this page you can see that we have a
06:52 - button over here now guys it is not
06:54 - recommended that you should use the
06:56 - document. WR after the page is loaded in
06:59 - this case so basically the entire page
07:01 - is loaded now but let's say on the click
07:04 - functionality of this particular button
07:06 - you have the document. write function so
07:09 - basically we are going to have the
07:10 - onclick attribute which is one of the
07:13 - attributes of the button HTML element
07:16 - and inside this particular onclick
07:18 - attribute we are going to have the
07:20 - JavaScript code which is document
07:22 - followed by Dot and then we have the
07:24 - right function over here and then let's
07:26 - say we have the same statement that is
07:28 - new statement m in this case so guys
07:31 - basically what we are trying to do is
07:33 - when the user clicks on this particular
07:35 - button we are going to call the
07:37 - JavaScript code that is document. write
07:40 - and it is going to write the new
07:41 - statement over here so basically this
07:43 - JavaScript code will be executed after
07:46 - the entire page is loaded on the web
07:49 - page which is not recommended since it
07:51 - is going to replace the entire content
07:53 - of the web page so guys let us check
07:55 - that so when we save this file now and
07:57 - try reloading this page so as you can
07:59 - see we have all the statements over here
08:01 - but when we click on this particular
08:03 - button that is Click me so as you can
08:05 - see new statement is getting printed
08:07 - over here and all the previous
08:09 - statements got replaced by this
08:11 - particular new statement so guys this is
08:13 - the reason that it is not recommended in
08:15 - order to make use of this document.
08:18 - write function after the page is loaded
08:20 - since it is going to replace the entire
08:23 - content of the existing page now guys
08:25 - apart from this we also have something
08:27 - called as alert over here which will
08:29 - help first in order to provide the
08:31 - output using the windows alert so guys
08:33 - let us check that as well so instead of
08:35 - having the document. WR statement simply
08:38 - we can make use of the alert function
08:40 - over here so guys this is another
08:42 - JavaScript function that will help us in
08:44 - order to provide certain statement
08:46 - inside the windows alert so let us say
08:49 - we provide certain statement that is
08:52 - this is a alert window so guys basically
08:55 - inside the parenthesis of the alert
08:57 - function we have the single codes and
09:00 - then inside that we have the statement
09:02 - this is alert window so when we save
09:04 - this file now basically we need to click
09:07 - on this button once again in order to
09:09 - make this alert appear over here so when
09:11 - we reload this page once again in this
09:14 - case and when we click on this
09:15 - particular button that is Click me you
09:17 - can see there's a window alert that is
09:19 - appearing and it is having the content
09:21 - this is alert window so guys in this way
09:24 - you can also provide the alerts as well
09:26 - if you want to add this particular
09:28 - feature based on your project
09:29 - requirements as apart from this we have
09:31 - already seen the usage of the
09:33 - console.log that is the fourth statement
09:35 - as part of the output in JavaScript so
09:38 - Guys these are some of the statements
09:39 - that you can use in order to provide the
09:41 - output in JavaScript apart from this we
09:44 - also have something called as text
09:45 - content and inner text as well which
09:48 - provides the same functionality similar
09:50 - to Inner HTML but there are certain
09:52 - differences so those differences we are
09:54 - going to check in the upcoming videos as
09:56 - well so comment in the comment section
09:58 - below whether you have learned learn
09:59 - something out of this video please make
10:01 - sure that you like this video so that it
10:03 - reaches to more people and subscribe to
10:05 - this channel so that you get the
10:06 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
10:08 - I'll see you in the next video in which
10:10 - we are going to cover an exercise in
10:12 - order to find the sum of numbers that is
10:15 - entered by the user using JavaScript so
10:18 - stay tuned

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see output in JavaScript so guys there are multiple ways in order to provide the output in JavaScript some of them we have already seen previously so let us go through them once again so guys first of all we have something called as inner HTML so guys let us check how we can use the inner HTML with the help of example over here so let me just remove the previous lines of code that we had written in the HTML and the JavaScript files in this case now guys simply inside the body tag of the HTML web page we are going to have the diff tag along with certain statement so let us say we have programming for beginners as the statement over here inside the diff tag which is the name of this YouTube channel that you should definitely subscribe in order to learn more about the JavaScript so guys this is a statement inside the diff tag over here and let us also provide the ID for this particular diff tag and we give the value as demo over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see we have programming for beginners that is getting printed on the web page now guys what is the usage of this inner HTML so basically we find one of the HTML elements on the web page so let's say we have this HTML element that is having the value programming for beginners and we replace it with another statement over here inside this HTML element and this can be achieved by using the inner HTML property so guys let us check that how we can achieve it so inside the test.js file we need to provide our JavaScript code before which we need to link the Javascript file with this particular HTML file over here so simply we use the script tag along with the SRC attribute and we provide the name of the Javascript file that we are going to write that is test.js file now guys let me just provide the statement inside the test.js file over here so simply we will make use of the document followed by Dot and then we will say query selector so over here we are going to make use of the ID of the HTML element that is demo in this case so let me just copy this ID and inside the query selector inside the single code over here we need to provide the hash character since we are making use of the ID value of the HTML element and Then followed by the ID value over here so guys this particular statement will help us in order to identify the HTML element that we want to update so let us verify that by using the console.log statement over here so simply we enclose this entire statement that we had written inside the

statement to be printed inside the def tag so simply we will say this is a diff tag updated by JavaScript so guys over here we have this updated statement this is a diff tag updated by JavaScript over here let me just save this file now and when we reload this page instead of having programming for beginners we will have this statement that is this is a diff tag up updated by JavaScript over here so let me just reload this page in this case so as you can see this is a div tag updated by JavaScript now guys in real case scenario we won't be having the inner HTML directly under the JavaScript

JavaScript code that we have written over here in order to update the the statement will be called in order to update the content on the web page so guys we will check this in the upcoming sessions as well but this is a very simple example as far as the inner HTML property is concerned now guys apart from this we also have something called as document. right so over here what we can do is let me just comment out this line of code over here simply we can make use of control+ for/ as the keyboard shortcut in order to provide this particular single line command on the vs code now after this let me just save this file now we will have the original statement on the web browser so as you can see programming for beginners is getting printed over here that's because we have commented out this line of code which is not getting executed and comments are one of the best ways in order to provide certain instructions to other programmers when they are going to read your JavaScript code now guys let us try this particular statement that is document. WR now guys what is the meaning of this document. WR so guys basically it is going to add another St statement to your existing file over here inside the HTML so guys let us check that as well so over here what we will do is simply inside the Javascript file in this case we will provide document followed by Dot and then we will say write method over here and then inside the parenthesis we are going to either have double or single codes over here and then we will say new statement in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see we have programming for big us and in this case we have the other line that is new statement over here which is added with the help of this document. write method in this case now guys it is very important to note that after loading the particular HTML web page you should not call this document. write function because it will replace the entire content of the web page so in order to understand this let us have couple of more diff tags over here and what we will do is simply I'm going to remove the ID attribute from these two D tag so we have these three div tags over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this web page once again on the browser so as you can see all these three statements are now getting printed now guys let us have button over here after the last diff tag in this case so simply we will have button with the text that is Click me over here let me just save this file now and when we reload this page you can see that we have a button over here now guys it is not recommended that you should use the document. WR after the page is loaded in this case so basically the entire page is loaded now but let's say on the click functionality of this particular button you have the document. write function so basically we are going to have the onclick attribute which is one of the attributes of the button HTML element and inside this particular onclick attribute we are going to have the JavaScript code which is document followed by Dot and then we have the right function over here and then let's say we have the same statement that is new statement m in this case so guys basically what we are trying to do is when the user clicks on this particular button we are going to call the JavaScript code that is document. write and it is going to write the new statement over here so basically this JavaScript code will be executed after the entire page is loaded on the web page which is not recommended since it is going to replace the entire content of the web page so guys let us check that so when we save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see we have all the statements over here but when we click on this particular button that is Click me so as you can see new statement is getting printed over here and all the previous statements got replaced by this particular new statement so guys this is the reason that it is not recommended in order to make use of this document. write function after the page is loaded since it is going to replace the entire content of the existing page now guys apart from this we also have something called as alert over here which will help first in order to provide the output using the windows alert so guys let us check that as well so instead of having the document.
