00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to display the powers of
00:06 - 2 using the for low so guys let us check
00:08 - this with the help of the vs code over
00:10 - here we can simply find the power of the
00:12 - number that is 2 by using the for Loop
00:14 - so over here we will be using the four
00:16 - keyword followed by I and then we will
00:19 - give the in keyword followed by this
00:21 - range now this range let's say we want
00:24 - to go up to the number that is 10 that
00:26 - is 2 raised to 10 over here so what we
00:28 - have to do is inside this for Loop we
00:30 - will simply have print statement and
00:32 - then we will say to raised to the number
00:36 - that is going to be I since this range
00:39 - it is going to go from 0 up to 9 we are
00:41 - going to print this statement each time
00:44 - the number that is I is incremented by 1
00:47 - so over here 2 raised to the very first
00:49 - number will come as 0 and then we will
00:51 - have the number that is 1 2 3 and so on
00:54 - so 2 raised to this number and Then
00:56 - followed by is and then the result that
00:59 - is 2 raised to that number so after this
01:01 - we are going to have the dot format in
01:04 - order to replace both these curly braces
01:06 - we have to provide two numbers over here
01:08 - the first variable it will be I and Then
01:11 - followed by comma and then we need to
01:13 - find the Power of 2 raised to this I
01:16 - number over here so what we will be
01:18 - doing is 2 2 times multiplication symbol
01:21 - and then I so guys this expression is
01:23 - used in order to find the power of the
01:26 - integer that is 2 over here now guys let
01:28 - me just save this file now and try
01:29 - running this code so as you can see we
01:31 - are getting the output over here that is
01:33 - 2 raised to 0 it is 1 that's because any
01:35 - number raised to 0 is 1 and 2 raised to
01:38 - 1 is 2 then 2 raised to 2 is 4 and then
01:40 - so on 2 raised to 3 is 8 then we have 16
01:43 - 32 64 128 and the last number that is 2
01:47 - raised to 9 it is 500 and 12. now guys
01:50 - whatever number that we give to this
01:52 - range it is excluded so basically in
01:54 - order to find 2 raised to 10 in this
01:56 - entire list we have to provide 11 over
01:59 - here inside the range function so let me
02:01 - just save this file now and try running
02:02 - this code once again now this time we
02:05 - are getting 2 raised to 10 as the last
02:06 - number for which the result is 1024
02:10 - which is correct let us verify this in
02:12 - the calculator as well we give 2 raised
02:14 - to the number that is 10 over here when
02:17 - we press equal to as you can see we are
02:18 - getting 1024 so guys just by using a for
02:22 - Loop and one line of statement over here
02:24 - we are simply getting the power of the
02:26 - integer that is 2 over here and in
02:29 - similar way you can get the power of any
02:31 - number that is entered by the user using
02:33 - this logic please make sure that you
02:35 - practice on your own so that on
02:36 - different inputs you get different
02:38 - outputs make sure that you like this
02:39 - video so that it reaches to more people
02:41 - and subscribe to the channel so that you
02:43 - get the notifications on upcoming videos
02:45 - as well the next video that we are going
02:47 - to talk about is Python program to
02:49 - display powers of 2 but this time we are
02:51 - going to use the anonymous function
02:53 - using the map function as well so stay
02:56 - tuned
