00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to check whether the
00:05 - entire number is a prime number so guys
00:08 - a positive integer greater than 1 which
00:10 - has no other factors except one and the
00:13 - number itself is called a prime number
00:16 - so let's say for example we have the
00:18 - number 2 which is a prime number and it
00:20 - is greater than 1 so the number one is
00:23 - not a prime number but it starts from
00:24 - the number two and then the next number
00:26 - that is 3 is again a prime number
00:28 - because there is no other number which
00:30 - divides the number three itself except
00:32 - the number that is one apart from that
00:34 - we have the number five which is again a
00:36 - prime number the next number is 7 which
00:38 - is again a prime number so all these are
00:40 - the list of prime numbers as they do not
00:42 - have any factors now if we check for
00:44 - example let's say the number six it is
00:46 - not a prime number it is a composite
00:48 - number that's because a number six can
00:50 - be obtained by multiplying the number
00:52 - two by three and in such a case this
00:54 - number that is this result is not a
00:56 - prime number so guys let us check when
00:58 - the user enters any particular a number
01:00 - whether it is a prime number or not let
01:03 - us write the Python program for this so
01:04 - guys over here in the vs code what we
01:06 - will do is the very first thing is we
01:08 - are supposed to provide the variable
01:10 - that is number which will be taken by
01:12 - the user as the input so over here we
01:14 - provide the input function and then we
01:17 - will say enter the number as the
01:19 - instruction to the user in order to
01:22 - check whether the entered number is a
01:23 - prime number since this input function
01:25 - takes the input as the string data type
01:28 - we have to convert it into the integer
01:30 - so over here we have to provide the
01:32 - prefix that is in the function over here
01:34 - that will help us in order to convert
01:36 - the string data to the integer now guys
01:38 - what will be the logic in order to find
01:40 - whether this number that is entered by
01:41 - the user is the prime number so
01:43 - basically we are going to start from the
01:45 - number 2 and we are going to divide this
01:47 - number by 2 in order to check whether
01:49 - the remainder is 0 if the remainder is 0
01:52 - that means a number is divisible by 2
01:54 - and it is not a prime number and if the
01:56 - remainder is not 0 then we have to move
01:58 - to the next number that is 3 and then
02:00 - again we have to check whether number
02:02 - divided by 3 is giving us 0 as the
02:04 - remainder and so on we have to check up
02:07 - to with each this number in order to
02:09 - check whether the number is prime or not
02:11 - so guys over here we will have the flag
02:13 - variable which will be false initially
02:15 - which means that the number is not a
02:17 - prime number right now so we set it as
02:19 - false and then what we will do is inside
02:21 - the for Loop we will be dividing the
02:23 - number in order to check whether the
02:25 - remainder is 0 so we will say for I and
02:28 - then in and then we will say range and
02:30 - this range it will go from 2 up to that
02:33 - number so over here we will say number
02:34 - in this case and then guys inside this
02:37 - what we have to do is we have to check
02:38 - whether this number percent I is 0 or
02:41 - not so we say if condition followed by
02:43 - number and then we have percent and then
02:46 - I whether it is equal to 0 and if it is
02:49 - 0 then we have to set the flag as true
02:51 - over here so that we can say that it is
02:53 - not a prime number so guys when the flag
02:55 - value is false then it is a prime number
02:57 - and when the flag value is true then it
02:59 - is not a prime number so over here once
03:02 - we find that the flag is true what we
03:04 - have to do is we have to break that
03:05 - means we have to come out of this for
03:07 - Loop so once we have found that a number
03:09 - is not a prime number there is no point
03:12 - of checking the remaining I value
03:14 - whether it is dividing this particular
03:16 - number in order to check whether the
03:17 - remainder is 0 or not so that is the
03:19 - reason we have to come out of the for
03:21 - Loop over here so outside this for Loop
03:24 - what we have to do is we have to check
03:25 - whether this flag value it is true or
03:27 - false so if the flag value is true then
03:30 - we have to say that entered number is
03:32 - not a prime number so we simply have to
03:34 - print the statement so we say print and
03:37 - then we say entered number that is we
03:41 - will replace these curly braces with the
03:43 - number over here and then we will say is
03:45 - not a prime number
03:48 - so guys after the string we have to use
03:50 - the dot format function and provide that
03:53 - variable name that is entered by the
03:54 - user that is number so that these curly
03:56 - braces are replaced by this particular
03:58 - variable that is number over here and if
04:01 - the flag is false which means the number
04:03 - that is entered by the user is a prime
04:05 - number so again we have to provide the
04:07 - current statement but this time it will
04:09 - be a prime number so over here what we
04:11 - will do is we will simply copy the
04:13 - Sprint statement and we will say else in
04:16 - this case and then entered number is a
04:18 - prime number in this case so guys in
04:20 - this else part over here we have said
04:22 - entered number that is the number is a
04:24 - prime number so let me just save this
04:26 - file now and try running this code
04:28 - so as you can see user is being asked to
04:30 - enter the number so let's say we provide
04:32 - the number 5 as the input and when we
04:35 - press enter as you can see enter number
04:37 - 5 is a prime number that's because there
04:40 - is no other number that is dividing five
04:42 - apart from this number itself that is
04:44 - five and one let us run this code once
04:46 - again and this time we will check
04:47 - whether the number 6 is a prime number
04:49 - or not so when we provide 6 so as you
04:52 - can see enter number six is not a prime
04:54 - number that's because 2 multiplied by 3
04:57 - will give us 6 and that is the reason
04:58 - why it is not a prime number so guys
05:00 - this is the way that we can easily find
05:02 - whether the provided number that is
05:04 - entered by the user is a prime number or
05:06 - not now guys apart from this this is not
05:08 - a very optimized code what we are doing
05:10 - is we are checking whether the numbers
05:12 - that is starting from 2 is it dividing
05:15 - the enter number or not so let's say if
05:17 - the number that is entered by the user
05:19 - is 99 we can optimize this code in such
05:22 - a way that we can ignore the number such
05:24 - as after 2 we can ignore the number 4
05:26 - then we have 6 and then we have 8 which
05:28 - are all even numbers which are again
05:30 - divisible by 2 for which we have already
05:32 - checked whether this number is divisible
05:34 - by 2 or not and apart from that once we
05:37 - reach the halfway that is let's say for
05:39 - the number 50 if we reach 25 as the
05:42 - value of I we can come out of the for
05:44 - Loop since after the number 25 it is
05:47 - impossible to multiply because after the
05:50 - number 25 there will be no other number
05:52 - which will be the factor of that number
05:54 - which is entered by the user which is
05:56 - 50. so guys such optimizations can be
05:58 - also done from your side once you are
06:00 - implementing the Python program in order
06:02 - to find whether the entered number is a
06:04 - prime number so guys I'll leave up to
06:06 - you as a homework for you but this is a
06:08 - very simple program in order to find
06:09 - whether the entered number is a prime
06:11 - number or not so please make sure that
06:13 - you practice on your own so that on
06:14 - different inputs you get different
06:15 - outputs make sure that you like this
06:17 - video so that it reaches to more people
06:19 - and subscribe to this channel so that
06:21 - you get the notifications on upcoming
06:22 - videos as well the next video that we
06:24 - are going to talk about is Python
06:26 - program to find the factorial of a
06:28 - number or using a for Loop so stay tuned

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to check whether the entire number is a prime number so guys a positive integer greater than 1 which has no other factors except one and the number itself is called a prime number so let's say for example we have the number 2 which is a prime number and it is greater than 1 so the number one is not a prime number but it starts from the number two and then the next number that is 3 is again a prime number because there is no other number which divides the number three itself except the number that is one apart from that we have the number five which is again a prime number the next number is 7 which is again a prime number so all these are the list of prime numbers as they do not have any factors now if we check for example let's say the number six it is not a prime number it is a composite number that's because a number six can be obtained by multiplying the number two by three and in such a case this number that is this result is not a prime number so guys let us check when the user enters any particular a number whether it is a prime number or not let us write the Python program for this so guys over here in the vs code what we will do is the very first thing is we are supposed to provide the variable that is number which will be taken by the user as the input so over here we provide the input function and then we will say enter the number as the instruction to the user in order to check whether the entered number is a prime number since this input function takes the input as the string data type we have to convert it into the integer so over here we have to provide the prefix that is in the function over here that will help us in order to convert the string data to the integer now guys what will be the logic in order to find whether this number that is entered by the user is the prime number so basically we are going to start from the number 2 and we are going to divide this number by 2 in order to check whether the remainder is 0 if the remainder is 0 that means a number is divisible by 2 and it is not a prime number and if the remainder is not 0 then we have to move to the next number that is 3 and then again we have to check whether number divided by 3 is giving us 0 as the remainder and so on we have to check up to with each this number in order to check whether the number is prime or not so guys over here we will have the flag variable which will be false initially which means that the number is not a prime number right now so we set it as false and then what we will do is inside the for Loop we will be dividing the number in order to check whether the remainder is 0 so we will say for I and then in and then we will say range and this range it will go from 2 up to that number so over here we will say number in this case and then guys inside this what we have to do is we have to check whether this number percent I is 0 or not so we say if condition followed by number and then we have percent and then I whether it is equal to 0 and if it is 0 then we have to set the flag as true over here so that we can say that it is not a prime number so guys when the flag value is false then it is a prime number and when the flag value is true then it is not a prime number so over here once we find that the flag is true what we have to do is we have to break that means we have to come out of this for Loop so once we have found that a number is not a prime number there is no point of checking the remaining I value whether it is dividing this particular number in order to check whether the remainder is 0 or not so that is the reason we have to come out of the for Loop over here so outside this for Loop what we have to do is we have to check whether this flag value it is true or false so if the flag value is true then we have to say that entered number is not a prime number so we simply have to print the statement so we say print and then we say entered number that is we will replace these curly braces with the number over here and then we will say is not a prime number so guys after the string we have to use the dot format function and provide that variable name that is entered by the user that is number so that these curly braces are replaced by this particular variable that is number over here and if the flag is false which means the number that is entered by the user is a prime number so again we have to provide the current statement but this time it will be a prime number so over here what we will do is we will simply copy the Sprint statement and we will say else in this case and then entered number is a prime number in this case so guys in this else part over here we have said entered number that is the number is a prime number so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see user is being asked to enter the number so let's say we provide the number 5 as the input and when we press enter as you can see enter number 5 is a prime number that's because there is no other number that is dividing five apart from this number itself that is five and one let us run this code once again and this time we will check whether the number 6 is a prime number or not so when we provide 6 so as you can see enter number six is not a prime number that's because 2 multiplied by 3 will give us 6 and that is the reason why it is not a prime number so guys this is the way that we can easily find whether the provided number that is entered by the user is a prime number or not now guys apart from this this is not a very optimized code what we are doing is we are checking whether the numbers that is starting from 2 is it dividing the enter number or not so let's say if the number that is entered by the user is 99 we can optimize this code in such a way that we can ignore the number such as after 2 we can ignore the number 4 then we have 6 and then we have 8 which are all even numbers which are again divisible by 2 for which we have already checked whether this number is divisible by 2 or not and apart from that once we reach the halfway that is let's say for the number 50 if we reach 25 as the value of I we can come out of the for Loop since after the number 25 it is impossible to multiply because after the number 25 there will be no other number which will be the factor of that number which is entered by the user which is 50. so guys such optimizations can be also done from your side once you are implementing the Python program in order to find whether the entered number is a prime number so guys I'll leave up to you as a homework for you but this is a very simple program in order to find whether the entered number is a prime number or not so please
