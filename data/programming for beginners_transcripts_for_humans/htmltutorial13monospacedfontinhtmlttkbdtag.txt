00:00 - welcome to another video in which we are
00:02 - going to learn about monospaced font in
00:04 - HTML so guys the content that is within
00:07 - the TT tag that is the starting tag and
00:09 - the ending tag over here is written in a
00:12 - mono spaced font now what is a mono
00:14 - spaced font so most of the fonts are
00:16 - known as variable with fonts because
00:19 - different letters are of different width
00:22 - for example the letter M over here is
00:25 - wider than the letter I so you can see
00:27 - the width of the letter M it is more
00:30 - compared to the width of the letter I
00:32 - over here now in a mono spaced font
00:34 - however each letter has the same width
00:37 - so this we are going to check with the
00:39 - help of examples now now guys remember
00:41 - that the TT tag that is used for the
00:43 - mono spaced font in HTML is being
00:45 - deprecated and we must use the kbd tag
00:49 - if we are using the HTML5 version so let
00:52 - us check this with the help of examples
00:53 - now in the vs code so what we will do is
00:56 - we will have a paragraph with a P tag
00:58 - over here and we will say this text is
01:02 - mono space so over here we have this
01:04 - text is mono spaced in this paragraph So
01:07 - this is one statement inside the
01:09 - paragraph that this text is mono's based
01:11 - in this paragraph let me just save this
01:13 - file now and try reloading this page as
01:16 - you can see we are getting a simple
01:17 - paragraph over here now guys what we
01:19 - need to do is these three words that is
01:21 - text is mono space we want to display it
01:24 - in the mono spaced font so what we will
01:27 - do is inside the source code we need to
01:29 - enclose these three words within the TT
01:32 - tag so over here we will simply have the
01:34 - lesson symbol and then we will say TT
01:36 - over here and then greater than symbol
01:38 - so let me just cut this ending tag and
01:41 - paste it after this monus based word so
01:44 - we have enclosed this text is mono
01:46 - spaced within this TT tag that is the
01:48 - star tag and the end tag as you can see
01:50 - it is being displayed in the red color
01:52 - that's because this tag is deprecated in
01:54 - the latest version of the HTML let me
01:56 - just save this file now and try
01:58 - reloading this page so as you can see
02:00 - the appearance of this text is
02:02 - monospaced is different compared to the
02:05 - other words in the same paragraph over
02:07 - here all the characters of this text is
02:09 - having the same with noun so guys
02:11 - basically even though this tag is
02:13 - deprecated but still it is being
02:14 - supported in some of the latest versions
02:16 - it is better to use the latest tags over
02:19 - here and that is what we have the KVD
02:21 - tag for so basically this is another tag
02:24 - in the HTML5 that we can use in order to
02:27 - have the same functionality similar to
02:29 - this DT tag so I'll just remove the TT
02:32 - tag over here and we will see KBT in
02:35 - this case so when we type kbd so as you
02:37 - can see kvt is being suggested by the vs
02:40 - code I'll end it using the greater than
02:42 - symbol and then cut this ending tag and
02:45 - replace this TT tag with the ending tag
02:47 - of the kvt let me just save this file
02:49 - now and try reloading this page once
02:51 - again no change will be noticed as you
02:54 - can see since the text is mono spaced is
02:56 - being displayed over here using the kbd
02:58 - tag as well so guys this this is the way
03:00 - that we can have the mono spaced font
03:02 - for some of the text or all of the text
03:05 - inside the paragraph or any other tags
03:08 - that you are using based on your
03:09 - requirements comment in the comment
