00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to learn
00:03 - about super method in Python inheritance
00:06 - so guys basically in Python inheritance
00:08 - we can use method overriding to call the
00:11 - method of a subclass but if we need to
00:14 - access the superclass method from the
00:17 - subclass we can use the super method so
00:20 - this is what we are going to check with
00:21 - the help of examples now over here first
00:23 - of all we are going to check that how
00:25 - method overriding works and then we are
00:27 - going to see how we can use the super
00:29 - method in order to call the method of
00:32 - the superclass so let us check this with
00:34 - the help of examples in the vs code so
00:36 - first of all we are going to have the
00:38 - parent class let's say we have the
00:39 - animal class as the parent class and
00:42 - basically we are going to have one
00:43 - function inside this class that is 8 and
00:46 - this function is going to take one
00:48 - parameter by default which is the object
00:50 - and we are going to name it as self over
00:52 - here and simply we can print the
00:54 - statement that is I can eat so we have I
00:59 - can eat statement over here so basically
01:01 - whenever we are going to call this
01:03 - method of the animal class it is going
01:06 - to print I can eat guys before this we
01:08 - can also provide the prefix that is
01:10 - animal so that we can identify that this
01:12 - is the method from the animal class now
01:14 - guys let us say we have another class
01:16 - that is the dog class which inherits the
01:18 - attributes and the functions of this
01:20 - animal class which is the super class so
01:23 - we have the class dog over here and
01:25 - inside the parenthesis we have animal
01:27 - and this is how we achieve python
01:29 - inheritance by using the parent class
01:31 - inside the parenthesis while defining
01:34 - the child class over here followed by a
01:36 - colon and then what we will do is first
01:38 - of all we have the past statement so
01:40 - that we don't have any code inside this
01:42 - so what we are going to do is since we
01:44 - are inheriting the animal class inside
01:46 - the dog class so basically we have
01:49 - access to this function that is 8 over
01:51 - here so we are going to create the
01:53 - object of this dog class as dog one it
01:56 - is equal to dog over here and then open
01:58 - and close parenthesis and for this dog
02:01 - one followed by dot as you can see each
02:04 - method is getting suggested by the vs
02:06 - code so we can use this function in
02:08 - order to call it followed by open and
02:10 - close parenthesis so let me just save
02:12 - this file now and try running this code
02:13 - so as you can see animal I can eat so
02:16 - this statement is getting printed that's
02:18 - because we have provided the statement
02:20 - inside the eat function of the animal
02:22 - class but guys for this dog class this
02:25 - statement that is animal I can eat is
02:27 - not very specific let's say we want to
02:29 - be little bit specific over here and we
02:31 - want to say that the dog likes to eat
02:33 - bones over here so what we can do is
02:35 - simply we can have the same method name
02:38 - and we can change the print statement
02:40 - inside that method name inside the dog
02:43 - class so what I will do is I'll just
02:45 - copy these lines of code and instead of
02:47 - the pass statement I'll provide certain
02:49 - code over here that is the copied code
02:52 - from the animal class so over here we
02:54 - have the same method with the same name
02:56 - but inside this what we will do is
02:58 - instead of animal over here we will
03:00 - provide dog and over here we will say I
03:03 - like to eat bones so guys basically this
03:08 - statement is little bit more specific it
03:10 - says that this is the talk and it likes
03:12 - to eat bones so we have provided the
03:14 - method with the same name similar to
03:16 - that of the method that is present
03:18 - inside the animal now guys we need not
03:20 - have to change anything over here this
03:22 - dog one object will call the eat
03:24 - function and due to Method overriding
03:27 - this function of the dog class will be
03:29 - called and not this particular statement
03:31 - will be called over here so let me just
03:33 - save this file now and try running this
03:35 - code so as you can see dog I like to eat
03:38 - bones so basically this print statement
03:40 - is getting executed which proves that
03:43 - this eat function is being called which
03:45 - belongs to the dog class and this is
03:47 - what we call it as a method overriding
03:49 - now guys there is a requirement where do
03:51 - we use the super method over here as we
03:53 - have seen the super method can be used
03:55 - in order to access the superclass method
03:58 - so let's say before printing the this
04:00 - statement that is dog like to eat bones
04:02 - over here what we want is we also want
04:05 - to print this statement that is animal I
04:07 - can eat so what we can do is while
04:10 - calling this eat method when the control
04:12 - flow goes over here we can go inside
04:14 - this function and we can use the super
04:17 - keyword so basically this is another
04:18 - method followed by open and close
04:21 - parenthesis so internally what is
04:23 - happening over here is this super will
04:25 - refer to the parent class that is animal
04:27 - over here so what we can do is while
04:29 - referring to this animal class we can
04:31 - access this function that is each
04:33 - function of the animal class so after
04:35 - the Super method we can provide dot
04:38 - followed by as you can see it function
04:40 - is being suggested by the vs code over
04:42 - here so we can use this eight function
04:44 - followed by open and close Parent Access
04:46 - so basically this is the way in order to
04:49 - access the method of a superclass from
04:51 - the subclass over here by using the
04:53 - super method so guys whenever you are
04:56 - dealing with method overriding over here
04:57 - the method of the subclass will be
05:00 - called by default and in case you want
05:02 - to also call the method of the
05:04 - superclass you can use the super method
05:06 - followed by that method name in order to
05:09 - call the method of the superclass so
05:11 - guys practice on your own so that on
05:12 - different inputs you get different
05:14 - outputs please make sure that you like
05:16 - this video so that it reaches to more
05:17 - people and subscribe to this channel so
05:19 - that you get the notifications on
05:21 - upcoming videos as well the next video
05:22 - that we are going to talk about is
05:24 - multiple inheritance in Python
05:26 - Programming so stay tuned

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about super method in Python inheritance so guys basically in Python inheritance we can use method overriding to call the method of a subclass but if we need to access the superclass method from the subclass we can use the super method so this is what we are going to check with the help of examples now over here first of all we are going to check that how method overriding works and then we are going to see how we can use the super method in order to call the method of the superclass so let us check this with the help

class that is 8 and this function is going to take one parameter by default which is the object and we are going to name it as self over here and simply we can print the statement that is I can eat so we have I can eat statement over here so basically whenever we are going to call this method of the animal class it is going to print I can eat guys before this we can also provide the prefix that is animal so that we can identify that this is the method from the animal class now guys let us say we have another class that is the dog class which inherits the attributes and the functions of this animal class which is the super class so we have the class dog over here and inside the parenthesis we have animal and this is how we achieve python inheritance by using the parent class inside the parenthesis while defining the child class over here followed by a colon and then what we will do is first of all we have the past statement so that we don't have any code inside this so what we are going to do is since we are inheriting the animal class inside the dog class so basically we have access to this function that is 8 over here so we are going to create the object of this dog class as dog one it is equal to dog over here and then open and close parenthesis and for this dog one followed by dot as you can see each method is getting suggested by the vs code so we can use this function in order to call it followed by open and close parenthesis so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see animal I can eat so this statement is getting printed that's

animal class so over here we have the same method with the same name but inside this what we will do is instead of animal over here we will provide dog and over here we will say I like to eat bones so guys basically this statement is little bit more specific it says that this is the talk and it likes to eat bones so we have provided the method with the same name similar to that of the method that is present inside the animal now guys we need not have to change anything over here this dog one object will call the eat function and due to Method overriding this function of the dog class will be called and not this particular statement will be called over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see dog I like to eat bones so basically this print statement is getting executed which proves that this eat function is being called which belongs to the dog class and this is what we call it as a method overriding now guys there is a requirement where do we use the super method over here as we have seen the super method can be used in order to access the superclass method so let's say before printing the this statement that is dog like to eat bones over here what we want is we also want to print this statement that is animal I can eat so what we can do is while calling this eat method when the control flow goes over here we can go inside this function and we can use the super keyword so basically this is another method followed by open and close parenthesis so internally what is happening over here is this super will refer to the parent class that is animal over here so what we can do is while referring to this animal class we can access this function that is each function of the animal class so after the Super method we can provide dot followed by as you can see it function is being suggested by the vs code over here so we can use this eight function followed by open and close Parent Access so basically this is the way in order to access the method of a superclass from the subclass over here by using the super method so guys whenever you are dealing with method overriding over here the method of the subclass will be called by default and in case you want to also call the method of the superclass you can use the super method followed by that method name in order to call the method of the superclass so guys practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the
