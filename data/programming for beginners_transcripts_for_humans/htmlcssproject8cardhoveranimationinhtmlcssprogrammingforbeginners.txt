With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we are going to create a card
00:01 - hover animation over here so basically
00:04 - we are going to create this simple card
00:06 - along with some box Shadow over here and
00:08 - when the user gets the mouse cursor on
00:11 - this card as you can see on the right
00:13 - hand side we are going to animate
00:15 - certain HTML elements with the help of
00:17 - the Pudo elements that we will Define
00:20 - inside the external stylesheet using the
00:22 - CSS properties so guys basically this is
00:25 - the cardover animation that we are going
00:27 - to create so guys let us move to the vs
00:29 - code so so now we will create a new
00:31 - folder inside HTML CSS projects so in
00:34 - this case we are going to create 08
00:37 - uncore and then card H animation as the
00:40 - name of the folder and then guys inside
00:42 - this we are going to create two files
00:44 - that is the index.html file and the
00:47 - style. CSS file as well so guys
00:49 - basically we have both these files
00:51 - inside the card hover animation folder
00:54 - and then inside the HTML file we are
00:56 - going to make use of this EMT
00:58 - abbreviation in order to generate this
01:00 - HTML template so guys inside the title
01:03 - tag we are going to say card over
01:06 - animation as the title of the page and
01:09 - we are going to link this style. CSS
01:11 - file as the external style sheet over
01:14 - here by using the link colon CSS M
01:17 - abbreviation so guys basically for the
01:19 - HF attribute we have to provide the
01:21 - external stylesheet as you can see now
01:24 - guys inside the body tag we are going to
01:26 - create the diff tag with the class
01:28 - container so basically we have the class
01:31 - over here for the diff tag and inside
01:33 - this div we are going to create another
01:35 - diff tag over here and then simply we
01:37 - are going to have the class name that is
01:39 - card and then inside this div tag we are
01:41 - going to have two more div tags first of
01:44 - all we will have the div tag with the
01:45 - class name over here so for this we are
01:48 - going to set the name as programming for
01:50 - beginners that is the name of this
01:52 - YouTube channel that you should
01:53 - definitely subscribe if you have not
01:55 - done so and then apart from this we are
01:57 - going to have another diff tag with the
01:59 - class roll over here and then for this D
02:02 - tag we are going to say YouTuber and
02:05 - coder over here so guys basically we
02:07 - have these two statements inside the
02:09 - diff tags let me just save this file now
02:11 - and let us see how the changes look like
02:13 - on the browser so we are going to run
02:16 - this live server over here so these are
02:17 - the two statements that are getting
02:19 - displayed over here now guys we are
02:21 - going to provide certain CSS properties
02:23 - in this case so first of all for the
02:25 - container class let us Define certain
02:27 - CSS properties over here so guys let us
02:29 - provide the width in this case so let's
02:31 - say we have 250 pixels of width and also
02:34 - a height over here so basically we will
02:36 - provide the height of 600 pixels this
02:38 - time apart from this we will also
02:40 - provide the white color as the
02:42 - background color over here let us change
02:44 - the version of the white color this time
02:46 - and let us provide this grayish color as
02:49 - the background color for this particular
02:51 - container class let me just save this
02:53 - file now so as you can see this is the
02:55 - container that is getting displayed let
02:57 - us adjust the height in this case so
02:59 - that we you can see the card properly on
03:01 - the screen so we have provided the width
03:03 - of 200 pixels and the height of 300
03:06 - pixels over here and this is how the
03:07 - card will look like now guys what we
03:09 - will do is we want to get this card at
03:11 - the center of the screen over here so
03:13 - simply we will provide margin as Auto
03:16 - Value this time so when we save this
03:18 - file as you can see the card is now
03:20 - present at the center of the screen
03:22 - apart from this we will also provide
03:24 - certain CSS properties to the card class
03:27 - that is present inside the container so
03:29 - guys what we we can do is we can simply
03:31 - provide the card class name over here
03:33 - and also we will set the width and
03:35 - height as 100% so that the card class
03:37 - takes the entire width and height of the
03:40 - container class over here and then apart
03:42 - from this we will also provide display
03:44 - it is equal to flex and we will say
03:47 - justify content as Center so that we are
03:50 - able to get this text at the center of
03:52 - this particular container so when we
03:54 - save this file now as you can see we are
03:56 - getting programming for beginners and
03:58 - then YouTuber and cod over here guys by
04:01 - default the flex direction is row over
04:03 - here so what we have to do is we need to
04:05 - make the flex direction as column so
04:07 - that both these strings are displayed
04:10 - vertically so guys over here we will say
04:12 - Flex Direction it is equal to column let
04:14 - me just save this file now so as you can
04:16 - see now both the text are now present at
04:19 - the center of the container as far as
04:21 - vertical alignment is concerned apart
04:23 - from this we will also provide text
04:25 - align it is equal to Center so that we
04:27 - get them at the center of the container
04:30 - as far as horizontal alignment is
04:32 - concerned apart from this let us also
04:34 - provide certain border radius over here
04:36 - for the container class so let's say we
04:38 - have the Border radius this time of 20
04:41 - pixels and also we will provide the Box
04:43 - Shadow over here so we will provide the
04:45 - blur effect with the color that is black
04:47 - in this case so guys basically we have
04:50 - zero pixels of horizontal and vertical
04:52 - box Shadow and we are providing the blur
04:54 - effect of 20 pixels with the black color
04:57 - when we save this file now as you can
04:59 - see it is giving the shadow over here
05:01 - for this particular card let us also
05:04 - adjust the background color over here to
05:06 - some extent so that it looks more decent
05:08 - so as you can see it is now looking more
05:10 - decent over here after adjusting the
05:12 - background color guys as per your
05:14 - requirements you can provide your own
05:16 - background color based on the project
05:18 - requirements now guys apart from this we
05:20 - will make use of the before and after
05:22 - sudo elements in order to create more
05:25 - HTML elements over here that will help
05:27 - us in order to provide the over
05:30 - animation so what we will do is for the
05:33 - card class we are going to create the
05:35 - before Pudo element so in this case we
05:38 - make use of the card class followed by 2
05:40 - * colon and then we will say before sudo
05:43 - element and then guys over here what we
05:45 - have to do is first of all we will have
05:47 - to provide the content it is equal to
05:50 - blank so we provide two times double
05:52 - string over here and then apart from
05:54 - this we also have to set the position it
05:56 - is equal to Absolute now guys since we
05:59 - are making the position equal to
06:00 - Absolute over here we need to make the
06:02 - position equal to relative for this
06:04 - particular card class so over here we
06:07 - will provide the position it is equal to
06:09 - relative this time and now since we have
06:11 - provided the position equal to Absolute
06:13 - for this before sudo element we can
06:15 - simply provide the top CSS property as
06:18 - zero and also the left CSS property as
06:21 - zero so that this new element starts
06:23 - from the top left corner of this
06:25 - particular card and then apart from this
06:27 - we will also set the withd as 100% over
06:31 - here and also the height as 100% so that
06:34 - it takes the entire width and height of
06:37 - the card in this case now guys apart
06:39 - from this let us also provide the
06:41 - background color over here so we will
06:43 - provide a blue version of the background
06:45 - color this time and let us set this
06:48 - lighter Blue version as the background
06:50 - color for this before element when we
06:52 - save this file now as you can see the
06:54 - entire card is now getting covered with
06:56 - the help of this before Pudo element now
06:59 - guys apart from this what we have to do
07:00 - is we will provide the transform CSS
07:03 - property as well in which case we are
07:05 - going to provide the skew over here so
07:08 - we are going to provide the skew by 30Â°
07:11 - so when we save this file now as you can
07:13 - see this is the skew CSS property that
07:16 - is applied on this particular pseudo
07:18 - element and let us also translate it to
07:21 - the right hand side so basically for
07:22 - this transform CSS property after the
07:24 - skew function that we have provided we
07:27 - can simply provide the translate
07:29 - function as well so we will provide
07:30 - translate X and we will move it by 50%
07:34 - over here when we save this file now as
07:36 - you can see we have moved it by 50% let
07:39 - us move it by 100% over here and see how
07:41 - it looks like so in this case we have
07:43 - moved it to 100% this time so guys in
07:46 - this way we have provided one of the
07:48 - HTML Elements by using the before sudo
07:51 - element which is part of this particular
07:53 - card class over here now guys let me
07:55 - just adjust the background color for the
07:57 - Udo element to this particular Blue
07:58 - version of the color so as you can see
08:00 - this is the Pudo element that is getting
08:03 - generated over here now guys similarly
08:05 - we will have another HTML element with
08:07 - the help of the after Pudo element over
08:10 - here so simply I'm going to copy paste
08:11 - these lines of code over here and
08:13 - instead of having before we will say
08:15 - after this time and all the CSS
08:17 - properties will be same except the skew
08:20 - for which we have to provide -30Â° so
08:23 - that it is opposite to the one that we
08:26 - have already created so when we save
08:28 - this file now as you can see see this is
08:29 - the way that the after element is also
08:32 - getting created over here now guys the
08:34 - portion that is going outside of this
08:35 - particular card we want to hide it so
08:38 - simply what we can do is for this
08:39 - container we can again provide the
08:42 - position it is equal to relative again
08:44 - since it is a container and simply we
08:46 - will say overflow it is equal to Hidden
08:49 - so that whatever HTML is outside of the
08:51 - boundary of the container it will be hid
08:53 - done so when we save this file now the
08:55 - portion of the seudo elements that we
08:57 - had created which was going outside of
08:59 - the the card is Now hidden this time now
09:01 - guys apart from this we will also
09:03 - provide certain opacity as well to both
09:05 - these Pudo elements so over here we will
09:08 - provide the opacity CSS property and
09:10 - let's say we provide the opacity it is
09:12 - equal to 0.7 so that we have certain
09:15 - kind of transparency which can be used
09:17 - in order to display this text when we
09:20 - get these Udo elements at the center of
09:22 - this card during the card hover
09:24 - animation so guys we have provided the
09:27 - opacity as well of 0.7 for both these
09:30 - cards now guys similarly we will create
09:32 - the before and after seudo elements for
09:34 - this container class as well but this
09:36 - time we will make changes as far as
09:38 - translate X is concerned so over here
09:41 - simply I'm going to copy paste these
09:43 - lines of code once again and inser of
09:45 - the Dot card over here we will have dot
09:48 - container this time for both before and
09:50 - the after pseudo elements and then we
09:53 - are going to keep all the CSS properties
09:55 - same over here except the translate X
09:57 - this time in which case we are going to
10:00 - make it as 85% over here so guys
10:02 - basically the translate X for both that
10:05 - is before and after Pudo elements will
10:07 - be 85% this time when we save this file
10:10 - now as you can see we have another layer
10:13 - of the same Pudo elements that is
10:15 - getting displayed over here now guys
10:17 - apart from this we can also provide
10:19 - certain box Shadow for the Pudo elements
10:22 - that we had created previously so that
10:24 - we can see them properly over here so
10:26 - inside this card class with the before
10:28 - elements simply we are going to provide
10:31 - the Box Shadow this time and then we
10:33 - will have the 10 pixels of box Shadow
10:36 - and we will have the color as blue so
10:38 - let us see how it looks like when we
10:40 - save this file now as you can see this
10:42 - is the Box shadow that is getting
10:44 - appeared over here similarly we are
10:46 - going to have the box Shadow for the
10:48 - after pseudo element as well so when we
10:51 - save this file now as you can see over
10:53 - here we are getting the Box Shadow this
10:55 - time now guys when we get the mouse
10:57 - cursor on this card we want the sudo
10:59 - elements to come towards the left hand
11:01 - side over here so what we can do is
11:03 - simply on Hover event we can change the
11:06 - translate X CSS property so guys over
11:09 - here first of all for the card class we
11:12 - are going to define the hover Pudo class
11:15 - over here and then after this we want to
11:18 - change the translate X property for the
11:20 - Pudo element over here so guys simply
11:22 - for the card class in this case we are
11:24 - going to make use of the hover class
11:26 - over here and then we are going to make
11:28 - use of the Pudo element that is before
11:31 - and then what we have to do is we will
11:33 - simply say transform and then we can say
11:36 - translate this time and we will have
11:39 - translate X and it should come to 50%
11:41 - over here so guys basically we are
11:43 - moving the before sudo element by 50% on
11:47 - left hand side and then guys similarly
11:49 - for the after sudo element as well we
11:51 - want the same transformation so we
11:53 - provide comma and then we provide the
11:56 - after sudo element over here basically
11:58 - as you can see the skew is getting
12:00 - removed over here so simply what we can
12:02 - do is we can also provide the skew as
12:04 - well so we need to provide it separately
12:07 - so over here we have provided the
12:09 - translate X it is equal to 50% and also
12:12 - we will keep the skew as 30Â° over here
12:15 - and then apart from this for the after
12:17 - seudo element as well we will again
12:20 - translate it by 50% and the skew this
12:22 - time must be -30Â° so over here we can
12:25 - provide the -30Â° as the skew parameter
12:28 - so guys when we get the mouse cursor
12:30 - over here as you can see it is moving
12:32 - now towards the left but guys basically
12:34 - we want the smooth transition as well so
12:36 - what we will do is we have to provide
12:38 - the transition CSS property to all these
12:40 - coo elements so basically we will say
12:43 - transition all and then we will provide
12:46 - 0.5 seconds over here and simply I'm
12:48 - going to copy paste these lines of code
12:51 - for all the pseudo elements so that we
12:54 - have the transition that is smooth this
12:56 - time and then apart from this let us
12:58 - also increase the translate X so that it
13:01 - doesn't go towards the extreme left of
13:03 - the card so basically we are going to
13:05 - keep it as 80% over here for both these
13:08 - pseudo elements this time so when we
13:09 - save this file now as you can see this
13:12 - is the way that the transition is
13:13 - happening over here similarly we will
13:15 - provide the transition for the container
13:18 - Pudo elements that is before and after
13:20 - so instead of having the class we will
13:22 - simply say container over here and then
13:24 - we will provide the translate X this
13:27 - time it should be 65% over here here so
13:29 - when we say 65 so that there is a gap of
13:31 - 15% between the seudo elements of both
13:34 - that is the card class and the container
13:36 - class as well so when we get the mouse
13:38 - cursor over here as you can see we are
13:40 - getting the animation for this
13:42 - particular card over here so guys
13:43 - basically we have the issue over here
13:45 - when we get the mouse cursor on this
13:47 - particular Cudo element the other Cudo
13:49 - element is going back to its original
13:51 - position so in order to solve that we
13:53 - can simply provide the container hover
13:56 - class for all these Transformations that
13:58 - we we have provided so let me change
14:00 - that quickly over here so guys as you
14:02 - can see we have the hover sudo class for
14:04 - the container class over here and then
14:07 - after that we have provided the before
14:09 - and after sudo element for the card
14:11 - class and also the before and after sudo
14:14 - element for the container class as well
14:16 - so when we save this file now now you
14:18 - can see that all the elements are now
14:20 - coming together as far as the animation
14:22 - is concerned so guys in this way you can
14:24 - create the simple card hover animation
14:26 - over here based on your requirements you
14:28 - can change the colors as well and then
14:30 - apart from this we can also make some
14:32 - changes to the text that is getting
14:34 - displayed over here so we can also
14:36 - provide certain scaling as far as the
14:38 - transformation of this text is concerned
14:40 - when the user gets the mouse cursor on
14:42 - these cards over here so guys comment in

Cleaned transcript:

so now we are going to create a card hover animation over here so basically we are going to create this simple card along with some box Shadow over here and when the user gets the mouse cursor on this card as you can see on the right hand side we are going to animate certain HTML elements with the help of the Pudo elements that we will Define inside the external stylesheet using the CSS properties so guys basically this is the cardover animation that we are going to create so guys let us move to the vs code so so now we will create a new folder inside HTML CSS projects so in this case we are going to create 08 uncore and then card H animation as the name of the folder and then guys inside this we are going to create two files that is the index.html file and the style. CSS file as well so guys basically we have both these files inside the card hover animation folder and then inside the HTML file we are going to make use of this EMT abbreviation in order to generate this HTML template so guys inside the title tag we are going to say card over animation as the title of the page and we are going to link this style. CSS file as the external style sheet over here by using the link colon CSS M abbreviation so guys basically for the HF attribute we have to provide the external stylesheet as you can see now guys inside the body tag we are going to create the diff tag with the class container so basically we have the class over here for the diff tag and inside this div we are going to create another diff tag over here and then simply we are going to have the class name that is card and then inside this div tag we are going to have two more div tags first of all we will have the div tag with the class name over here so for this we are going to set the name as programming for beginners that is the name of this YouTube channel that you should definitely subscribe if you have not done so and then apart from this we are going to have another diff tag with the class roll over here and then for this D tag we are going to say YouTuber and coder over here so guys basically we have these two statements inside the diff tags let me just save this file now and let us see how the changes look like on the browser so we are going to run this live server over here so these are the two statements that are getting displayed over here now guys we are going to provide certain CSS properties in this case so first of all for the container class let us Define certain CSS properties over here so guys let us provide the width in this case so let's say we have 250 pixels of width and also a height over here so basically we will provide the height of 600 pixels this time apart from this we will also provide the white color as the background color over here let us change the version of the white color this time and let us provide this grayish color as the background color for this particular container class let me just save this file now so as you can see this is the container that is getting displayed let us adjust the height in this case so that we you can see the card properly on the screen so we have provided the width of 200 pixels and the height of 300 pixels over here and this is how the card will look like now guys what we will do is we want to get this card at the center of the screen over here so simply we will provide margin as Auto Value this time so when we save this file as you can see the card is now present at the center of the screen apart from this we will also provide certain CSS properties to the card class that is present inside the container so guys what we we can do is we can simply provide the card class name over here and also we will set the width and height as 100% so that the card class takes the entire width and height of the container class over here and then apart from this we will also provide display it is equal to flex and we will say justify content as Center so that we are able to get this text at the center of this particular container so when we save this file now as you can see we are getting programming for beginners and then YouTuber and cod over here guys by default the flex direction is row over here so what we have to do is we need to make the flex direction as column so that both these strings are displayed vertically so guys over here we will say Flex Direction it is equal to column let me just save this file now so as you can see now both the text are now present at the center of the container as far as vertical alignment is concerned apart from this we will also provide text align it is equal to Center so that we get them at the center of the container as far as horizontal alignment is concerned apart from this let us also provide certain border radius over here for the container class so let's say we have the Border radius this time of 20 pixels and also we will provide the Box Shadow over here so we will provide the blur effect with the color that is black in this case so guys basically we have zero pixels of horizontal and vertical box Shadow and we are providing the blur effect of 20 pixels with the black color when we save this file now as you can see it is giving the shadow over here for this particular card let us also adjust the background color over here to some extent so that it looks more decent so as you can see it is now looking more decent over here after adjusting the background color guys as per your requirements you can provide your own background color based on the project requirements now guys apart from this we will make use of the before and after sudo elements in order to create more HTML elements over here that will help us in order to provide the over animation so what we will do is for the card class we are going to create the before Pudo element so in this case we make use of the card class followed by 2 * colon and then we will say before sudo element and then guys over here what we have to do is first of all we will have to provide the content it is equal to blank so we provide two times double string over here and then apart from this we also have to set the position it is equal to Absolute now guys since we are making the position equal to Absolute over here we need to make the position equal to relative for this particular card class so over here we will provide the position it is equal to relative this time and now since we have provided the position equal to Absolute for this before sudo element we can simply provide the top CSS property as zero and also the left CSS property as zero so that this new element starts from the top left corner of this particular card and then apart from this we will also set the withd as 100% over here and also the height as 100% so that it takes the entire width and height of the card in this case now guys apart from this let us also provide the background color over here so we will provide a blue version of the background color this time and let us set this lighter Blue version as the background color for this before element when we save this file now as you can see the entire card is now getting covered with the help of this before Pudo element now guys apart from this what we have to do is we will provide the transform CSS property as well in which case we are going to provide the skew over here so we are going to provide the skew by 30Â° so when we save this file now as you can see this is the skew CSS property that is applied on this particular pseudo element and let us also translate it to the right hand side so basically for this transform CSS property after the skew function that we have provided we can simply provide the translate function as well so we will provide translate X and we will move it by 50% over here when we save this file now as you can see we have moved it by 50% let us move it by 100% over here and see how it looks like so in this case we have moved it to 100% this time so guys in this way we have provided one of the HTML Elements by using the before sudo element which is part of this particular card class over here now guys let me just adjust the background color for the Udo element to this particular Blue version of the color so as you can see this is the Pudo element that is getting generated over here now guys similarly we will have another HTML element with the help of the after Pudo element over here so simply I'm going to copy paste these lines of code over here and instead of having before we will say after this time and all the CSS properties will be same except the skew for which we have to provide 30Â° so that it is opposite to the one that we have already created so when we save this file now as you can see see this is the way that the after element is also getting created over here now guys the portion that is going outside of this particular card we want to hide it so simply what we can do is for this container we can again provide the position it is equal to relative again since it is a container and simply we will say overflow it is equal to Hidden so that whatever HTML is outside of the boundary of the container it will be hid done so when we save this file now the portion of the seudo elements that we had created which was going outside of the the card is Now hidden this time now guys apart from this we will also provide certain opacity as well to both these Pudo elements so over here we will provide the opacity CSS property and let's say we provide the opacity it is equal to 0.7 so that we have certain kind of transparency which can be used in order to display this text when we get these Udo elements at the center of this card during the card hover animation so guys we have provided the opacity as well of 0.7 for both these cards now guys similarly we will create the before and after seudo elements for this container class as well but this time we will make changes as far as translate X is concerned so over here simply I'm going to copy paste these lines of code once again and inser of the Dot card over here we will have dot container this time for both before and the after pseudo elements and then we are going to keep all the CSS properties same over here except the translate X this time in which case we are going to make it as 85% over here so guys basically the translate X for both that is before and after Pudo elements will be 85% this time when we save this file now as you can see we have another layer of the same Pudo elements that is getting displayed over here now guys apart from this we can also provide certain box Shadow for the Pudo elements that we had created previously so that we can see them properly over here so inside this card class with the before elements simply we are going to provide the Box Shadow this time and then we will have the 10 pixels of box Shadow and we will have the color as blue so let us see how it looks like when we save this file now as you can see this is the Box shadow that is getting appeared over here similarly we are going to have the box Shadow for the after pseudo element as well so when we save this file now as you can see over here we are getting the Box Shadow this time now guys when we get the mouse cursor on this card we want the sudo elements to come towards the left hand side over here so what we can do is simply on Hover event we can change the translate X CSS property so guys over here first of all for the card class we are going to define the hover Pudo class over here and then after this we want to change the translate X property for the Pudo element over here so guys simply for the card class in this case we are going to make use of the hover class over here and then we are going to make use of the Pudo element that is before and then what we have to do is we will simply say transform and then we can say translate this time and we will have translate X and it should come to 50% over here so guys basically we are moving the before sudo element by 50% on left hand side and then guys similarly for the after sudo element as well we want the same transformation so we provide comma and then we provide the after sudo element over here basically as you can see the skew is getting removed over here so simply what we can do is we can also provide the skew as well so we need to provide it separately so over here we have provided the translate X it is equal to 50% and also we will keep the skew as 30Â° over here and then apart from this for the after seudo element as well we will again translate it by 50% and the skew this time must be 30Â° so over here we can provide the 30Â° as the skew parameter so guys when we get the mouse cursor over here as you can see it is moving now towards the left but guys basically we want the smooth transition as well so what we will do is we have to provide the transition CSS property to all these coo elements so basically we will say transition all and then we will provide 0.5 seconds over here and simply I'm going to copy paste these lines of code for all the pseudo elements so that we have the transition that is smooth this time and then apart from this let us also increase the translate X so that it doesn't go towards the extreme left of the card so basically we are going to keep it as 80% over here for both these pseudo elements this time so when we save this file now as you can see this is the way that the transition is happening over here similarly we will provide the transition for the container Pudo elements that is before and after so instead of having the class we will simply say container over here and then we will provide the translate X this time it should be 65% over here here so when we say 65 so that there is a gap of 15% between the seudo elements of both that is the card class and the container class as well so when we get the mouse cursor over here as you can see we are getting the animation for this particular card over here so guys basically we have the issue over here when we get the mouse cursor on this particular Cudo element the other Cudo element is going back to its original position so in order to solve that we can simply provide the container hover class for all these Transformations that we we have provided so let me change that quickly over here so guys as you can see we have the hover sudo class for the container class over here and then after that we have provided the before and after sudo element for the card class and also the before and after sudo element for the container class as well so when we save this file now now you can see that all the elements are now coming together as far as the animation is concerned so guys in this way you can create the simple card hover animation over here based on your requirements you can change the colors as well and then apart from this we can also make some changes to the text that is getting displayed over here so we can also provide certain scaling as far as the transformation of this text is concerned when the user gets the mouse cursor on these cards over here so guys comment
