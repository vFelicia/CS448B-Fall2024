00:00 - so now we will see button styling in CSS
00:02 - so guys basically we will use the
00:04 - different CSS properties in order to
00:07 - style the buttons so first of all we are
00:09 - going to see how the default button
00:11 - looks like on the web browser so guys
00:14 - let us move to the vs code over here and
00:16 - simply in the HTML file we are going to
00:19 - have a simple button tag over here and
00:21 - then for this particular button tag we
00:24 - are going to have the text that is
00:26 - default in this case after which we are
00:28 - going to have a line break over here
00:30 - here so guys we have the default text
00:32 - for this button let us see how it looks
00:34 - like on the web browser so let me just
00:36 - save this file now and try reloading
00:38 - this page on the browser so as you can
00:40 - see this is the default button that
00:42 - appears on most of the browsers over
00:45 - here now guys in most of the projects
00:46 - you will have to provide certain CSS
00:49 - properties in order to modify the look
00:51 - and feel of the button that you want to
00:53 - display so guys over here we are going
00:55 - to cover the various types of buttons as
00:58 - you can see we have the button color
01:00 - over here first of all so let us check
01:01 - that as well so after this particular
01:03 - default button let us have the div tag
01:06 - inside which we will have our customized
01:08 - buttons for which we will apply the CSS
01:11 - properties so guys over here we will set
01:13 - the button with the class that is
01:15 - background color that is blue over here
01:17 - so guys basically we are setting the
01:19 - class name that is BG blue in this case
01:22 - and then we will set the text as blue
01:24 - for this particular button and then
01:26 - apart from this we will also have the
01:27 - buttons with other colors as well so we
01:30 - will have the blue green and red color
01:32 - buttons over here so simply we are going
01:35 - to set the class names as BG blue BG
01:38 - green and then BG red over here and the
01:41 - text that we are going to set is green
01:43 - and red in this case so guys basically
01:46 - these are the three buttons that will be
01:48 - displayed on the web browser and they
01:50 - are present inside the diff tag over
01:52 - here let me just save this file now and
01:54 - try reloading this page once again on
01:56 - the browser notice that all these
01:58 - buttons are displayed in the default way
02:00 - that's because we have not provided any
02:02 - of the CSS properties to these buttons
02:04 - so guys what we are going to do is
02:06 - inside the style. CSS file that is
02:08 - linked to this particular HTML file over
02:10 - here we are going to provide certain
02:13 - common CSS properties for the buttons
02:15 - that are present inside the diff tag so
02:17 - after the diff tag we are going to
02:19 - provide the button over here after which
02:22 - we are going to set certain properties
02:24 - so let's say we provide the margin
02:26 - property as 10 pixels over here and then
02:28 - apart from this we are are also going to
02:31 - set the padding property as 10 pixels
02:33 - over here and then we are also going to
02:35 - have the color as white color in this
02:38 - case so that the text for all these
02:40 - buttons are displayed in the white color
02:42 - let me just save this file now and try
02:44 - reloading this page once again on the
02:46 - browser notice that all these properties
02:48 - are applied to these buttons which are
02:50 - present inside the diff tag over here
02:53 - now one by one we are going to set the
02:55 - background colors for all these buttons
02:57 - in this case so guys simply we are going
02:59 - to set set the CSS properties for all
03:01 - these buttons before which we are going
03:03 - to set the Border equal to none for all
03:05 - these buttons so that we don't see these
03:08 - black color borders that you can see
03:10 - right now so guys let us set the
03:11 - background color for all these buttons
03:13 - with the help of the class name over
03:15 - here so first of all we have the BG blue
03:18 - class in which case we are going to set
03:20 - the background color as blue color over
03:22 - here similarly we are going to set the
03:25 - green and red color background for the
03:27 - classes that is BG green and BG red in
03:30 - this case so guys over here we are going
03:32 - to set the background color as green and
03:34 - for the other class that is BG red we
03:36 - are going to set the background color as
03:38 - red in this case let me just save this
03:40 - file now and try reloading this page
03:42 - once again on the browser so as you can
03:44 - see these are the buttons with the
03:46 - different background color that we have
03:48 - provided with the help of the CSS
03:50 - properties and you can see that there is
03:51 - a default Button as well over here which
03:54 - is looking less attractive compared to
03:56 - the other buttons for which we have
03:57 - provided the CSS properties so guys this
04:00 - is the way that you can provide the
04:01 - background color for the different
04:03 - buttons over here now apart from this
04:05 - when we get the cursor on these buttons
04:07 - we need to change the cursor to hand
04:09 - tool so what we can do is for all the
04:11 - buttons in this case that are present
04:13 - inside the diff tag we are going to set
04:15 - the cursor CSS property to the value
04:18 - that is pointer over here let me just
04:20 - save this file now and try reloading
04:22 - this page so when we get the cursor on
04:24 - the button as you can see it has been
04:25 - converted to the hand tool over here so
04:28 - in this way you can set the cursor
04:29 - properly property as well now guys apart
04:31 - from this let us also see how we can set
04:33 - the button font size so let us move to
04:35 - the HTML file first of all and what we
04:38 - will do is we will copy these lines of
04:40 - code once again and this time we are
04:42 - going to change the class name in order
04:44 - to set the font size over here so let's
04:47 - say we have the font size of 12 pixels
04:49 - first of all and then we have the font
04:51 - size of 16 pixels which is the default
04:54 - font size for the button and then we
04:56 - have the font size of 20 pixels over
04:59 - here and and then guys for the text part
05:01 - instead of blue we are going to have 12
05:03 - pixels in this case and then apart from
05:05 - this for this green we are going to say
05:07 - 16 pixels which is the font size and
05:09 - then for the red we are going to have 20
05:11 - pixels over here so we are going to have
05:14 - all these buttons with different font
05:16 - sizes and then apart from this we will
05:18 - also have the background colors for all
05:20 - these buttons so guys simply we are
05:22 - going to set the BG blue for the first
05:24 - button and then followed by BG Green in
05:27 - this case for the second button and then
05:29 - over here we will set BG red for the
05:31 - third button over here so guys in order
05:34 - to apply the CSS properties from
05:36 - multiple classes you can provide the
05:38 - different classes inside the class
05:41 - attribute over here which should be
05:42 - separated with the space character in
05:44 - this way so let me just save this file
05:46 - now and try reloading this page once
05:48 - again on the browser notice that we have
05:50 - CAU all the background colors for these
05:52 - buttons but the font size is not set so
05:55 - far so what we are going to do is we
05:57 - will set the font size using this font
06:00 - 12 font 16 and font 20 classes inside
06:03 - the CSS file so guys over here after
06:06 - this we are going to set the font size
06:08 - equal to 12 for this particular class so
06:10 - simply we are going to set the font size
06:12 - CSS property to 12 pixels over here and
06:15 - then similarly we are going to set the
06:18 - 16 pixels and 20 pixels font size so
06:20 - over here we have font 16 it is equal to
06:23 - 16 pixels and then we have font 20 it is
06:26 - equal to 20 pixels over here let me just
06:29 - save this file now and try reloading
06:31 - this page once again on the browser so
06:33 - as you can see we have 12 pixels 16
06:35 - pixels and then 20 pixels font size for
06:38 - all these respective buttons over here
06:40 - now guys apart from this we can also
06:42 - have the rounded buttons as well so what
06:44 - we will do is simply we are going to
06:46 - copy these lines of code once again over
06:49 - here and then what we are going to do is
06:51 - instead of having the font classes over
06:53 - here we will have the class that starts
06:56 - with round over here so guys basically
06:58 - we have round five which will set the
07:00 - Border radius as 5 pixels over here and
07:03 - then we have the round 10 and then we
07:06 - will have the round 50 in which case we
07:08 - are going to set it as 50% in this case
07:11 - so guys over here we will set it as 5
07:13 - pixels so that we can identify that this
07:15 - is the button with the Border radius as
07:18 - 5 pixels and then we have 10 pixels over
07:20 - here and then in this case we will have
07:22 - 50% over here let me just save this file
07:25 - now and try reloading this page once
07:27 - again on the browser as you can see we
07:29 - have all all the buttons in this case
07:30 - but we need to provide the Border radius
07:33 - to all these classes so what we are
07:34 - going to do is we will copy this round
07:37 - five over here and then inside the
07:38 - style. CSS file we will have this class
07:41 - name that is around five and then for
07:43 - this class we are going to set the
07:45 - Border radius which will be equal to 5
07:48 - pixels over here similarly we will copy
07:50 - this line of code for the round 10 and
07:53 - the round 50 classes as well for which
07:56 - case we are going to set the Border
07:57 - radius as 10 pixels and and then 50%
08:00 - respectively so guys over here we have
08:02 - set the Border radius properties as well
08:05 - let me just save this file now and try
08:07 - reloading this page once again on the
08:08 - browser as you can see this is the 5
08:10 - pixel border radius and Then followed by
08:13 - the 10 pixel border radius for this
08:15 - button and then this is the 50% border
08:17 - radius which means approximately it will
08:19 - be a circular button over here when the
08:22 - width and the height of the button is
08:24 - same so guys in this way you can set the
08:26 - Border radius for a specific button
08:28 - based on your requirements and then
08:30 - apart from this we will also have the
08:31 - colored button borders so guys so far we
08:34 - have provided the colors inside the
08:36 - button but what we are going to do is we
08:39 - will have the button color that is the
08:41 - background color is white but these
08:42 - colors will be the Border colors for
08:45 - these buttons so guys let us check that
08:47 - as well so what we will do is simply I'm
08:49 - going to copy these lines of code over
08:51 - here once again and then we will remove
08:53 - the class names over here from all these
08:56 - buttons so we will set the Border as
08:58 - blue over over here and then apart from
09:00 - this we will set the Border as green for
09:03 - the second button so let me just quickly
09:05 - set the Border green class name and then
09:08 - the last button will have the border red
09:11 - class name and then we will set the text
09:13 - as blue green and red respectively so
09:16 - guys over here we have set the buttons
09:18 - with the Border blue border green and
09:20 - the border red class name so what we
09:22 - have to do is we need to set the
09:24 - background color as white for all these
09:26 - buttons and then we are going to set the
09:29 - Border color for these buttons so let me
09:31 - just copy this class name and then
09:32 - inside the style. CSS file over here
09:35 - simply we are going to provide the CSS
09:37 - properties for these class names so
09:39 - first of all border blue it will have
09:41 - the background color as white color over
09:44 - here and then we need to set the border
09:46 - so let's say we set the Border as one
09:48 - pixel which will be of the solid type in
09:51 - this case and then the color should be
09:53 - blue color over here so guys let me just
09:54 - save this file now and let us see how it
09:56 - looks like on the web browser so on the
09:58 - browser let me just reload this page as
10:01 - you can see we have the Border color as
10:03 - the blue color over here but guys we are
10:05 - not able to see the text because it is
10:07 - of the color white by default so we need
10:10 - to change the color to black as well so
10:12 - guys over here we are going to set the
10:14 - color as black once again and since this
10:17 - particular color property is having the
10:18 - black color over here for this border
10:20 - blue so this black color will be
10:22 - implemented and it will override the
10:24 - previous value that is color equal to
10:27 - White that we had set for the button t
10:29 - tag over here that's because the recent
10:31 - color that we are setting is black in
10:33 - this case so guys always remember
10:35 - whatever the recent CSS property is
10:37 - applied to any of the classes or the
10:40 - Texs that particular CSS property will
10:42 - be implemented or used when that HTML
10:46 - element is displayed on the web browser
10:48 - so let me just save this file now and
10:50 - try reloading this page once again on
10:51 - the browser so as you can see we have
10:53 - this blue color button that is getting
10:56 - displayed similarly we need to display
10:58 - the green and the red color buttons as
10:59 - well so we are going to copy these lines
11:02 - of code and change the colors to green
11:05 - and red over here so we have the classes
11:07 - border green and over here instead of
11:09 - having the blue color border we will
11:11 - have the green color border over here
11:13 - and then for the border red class we are
11:16 - going to have the red color border over
11:18 - here let me just save this file now and
11:20 - try reloading this page once again on
11:22 - the browser so as you can see we have
11:24 - the blue green and red buttons in this
11:27 - case for which the background color is
11:28 - white and the Border colors are blue
11:31 - green and red respectively so guys in
11:33 - this way instead of having the
11:35 - background colors you can also have the
11:37 - Border colors and your buttons will look
11:39 - attractive on the website now guys apart
11:41 - from this we can also have the hoverable
11:43 - buttons so over here what we are going
11:45 - to do is when the user gets the mouse
11:48 - cursor on these buttons over here we
11:50 - want to change its background color to
11:52 - the same color so let's say when the
11:54 - user gets the mouse cursor on this blue
11:57 - button over here so the background color
11:59 - should be set as blue and the font color
12:02 - should be set as white so what we can do
12:04 - is simply for this border blue class we
12:07 - need to define the Pudo class that is
12:09 - hover so guys simply we are going to
12:11 - copy this border blue class name
12:14 - followed by colon and then on Hover
12:16 - event which is the sudo class we need to
12:19 - set the background color as blue color
12:21 - in this case so basically we are setting
12:23 - the background color as blue and we want
12:25 - to set the color as white so that the
12:28 - text color can be dis played properly on
12:30 - this particular background color that is
12:32 - set as blue so let me just save this
12:33 - file now and try reloading this page
12:35 - once again on the browser so by default
12:37 - as you can see this is the button that
12:39 - is getting displayed but when the user
12:41 - gets the mouse cursor on this blue
12:43 - button over here the background color is
12:45 - getting updated so guys in this way you
12:47 - can set the hover effect on the green
12:49 - and the red buttons as well so let us do
12:51 - that as well quickly so simply we are
12:53 - going to copy these lines of code and
12:56 - over here instead of having the blue we
12:58 - are going to have the B green class name
13:00 - for which the background color should be
13:02 - green color over here and for the border
13:04 - red hover event we are going to have the
13:07 - background color as red in this case so
13:09 - guys let me just save this file now and
13:11 - try reloading this page once again on
13:13 - the browser when we get the mouse cursor
13:14 - on green button you can see that the
13:16 - background color is updated to green and
13:18 - the red button the background color is
13:20 - updated to Red in this way we can have
13:23 - the hover effect on the buttons as well
13:25 - based on the CSS properties that we have
13:27 - seen by using the h event over here now
13:30 - guys apart from this we can also have
13:32 - the shadow for the buttons so let us
13:34 - create another button over here with the
13:36 - class button Shadow so guys let me just
13:38 - change the class name to BTN and then we
13:42 - have Shadow over here and basically we
13:44 - are going to change the text to Shadow
13:46 - button in this case so guys we have
13:48 - another button that is Shadow button
13:50 - over here let me just save this file now
13:52 - and try reloading this page once again
13:54 - on the browser so this is the button
13:56 - that is getting displayed over here let
13:58 - us change the SS properties for this
14:00 - button Shadow so let me just copy this
14:02 - class name and then paste this over here
14:04 - after the dot character and what we are
14:06 - going to do is we will set the
14:08 - background color as aqua color over here
14:11 - we will set the text color as black
14:13 - color in this case let me just save this
14:15 - file now and try reloading this page
14:17 - once again on the browser so as you can
14:18 - see we have the shadow button over here
14:21 - now guys in order to create the shadow
14:23 - for this button we can simply use the
14:25 - Box Shadow CSS property so over here
14:28 - inside the button Shadow class we will
14:30 - have the box Shadow CSS property and
14:33 - first of all we will have to set the
14:35 - horizontal Shadow so let's say we have 2
14:37 - pixels of horizontal Shadow and then 2
14:39 - pixels of vertical Shadow and then we
14:41 - need to provide the blur effect so let's
14:44 - say 5 pixels of blur effect and the
14:46 - color of the shadow that we want to
14:47 - display so let's say we have the black
14:49 - color over here let me just save this
14:51 - file now and try reloading this page
14:53 - once again on the browser so as you can
14:55 - see we have the black color shadow that
14:57 - is getting displayed over here apart
14:59 - from this we can also have the multiple
15:01 - Shadows so after the black color we can
15:03 - provide comma and then let's say we
15:05 - provide 0 pixels for horizontal and
15:08 - vertical Shadow and then for the blur
15:10 - effect let's say we provide 20 pixels of
15:12 - blur effect over here and then apart
15:14 - from this let us say we have the color
15:16 - of the Shadow as blue after this black
15:18 - color shadow so let me just save this
15:20 - file now and try reloading this page you
15:22 - will notice that after this black color
15:24 - shadow there will be the blue color
15:26 - shadow that will be displayed for this
15:28 - particular shadow button so when we
15:29 - reload this page you can see that there
15:31 - is a blue color shadow that is getting
15:33 - displayed over here which is making this
15:35 - button look more attractive on the web
15:38 - page so guys this is the way that you
15:40 - can provide the shadow effect for the
15:41 - button and the other effects as well
15:44 - based on the CSS properties that we have
15:46 - seen so far for the button HTML element
15:49 - so guys comment in the comment section

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see button styling in CSS so guys basically we will use the different CSS properties in order to style the buttons so first of all we are going to see how the default button looks like on the web browser so guys let us move to the vs code over here and simply in the HTML file we are going to have a simple button tag over here and then for this particular button tag we are going to have the text that is default in this case after which we are going to have a line break over here here so guys we have the default text for this button let us see how it looks like on the web browser so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see this is the default button that appears on most of the browsers over here now guys in most of the projects you will have to provide certain CSS properties in order to modify the look and feel of the button that you want to display so guys over here we are going to cover the various types of buttons as you can see we have the button color over here first of all so let us check that as well so after this particular default button let us have the div tag inside which we will have our customized buttons for which we will apply the CSS properties so guys over here we will set the button with the class that is background color that is blue over here so guys basically we are setting the class name that is BG blue in this case and then we will set the text as blue for this particular button and then apart from this we will also have the buttons with other colors as well so we will have the blue green and red color buttons over here so simply we are going to set the class names as BG blue BG green and then BG red over here and the text that we are going to set is green and red in this case so guys basically these are the three buttons that will be displayed on the web browser and they are present inside the diff tag over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser notice that all these buttons are displayed in the default way that's because we have not provided any of the CSS properties to these buttons so guys what we are going to do is inside the style. CSS file that is linked to this particular HTML file over here we are going to provide certain common CSS properties for the buttons that are present inside the diff tag so after the diff tag we are going to provide the button over here after which we are going to set certain properties so let's say we provide the margin property as 10 pixels over here and then apart from this we are are also going to set the padding property as 10 pixels over here and then we are also going to have the color as white color in this case so that the text for all these buttons are displayed in the white color let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser notice that all these properties are applied to these buttons which are present inside the diff tag over here now one by one we are going to set the background colors for all these buttons in this case so guys simply we are going to set set the CSS properties for all these buttons before which we are going to set the Border equal to none for all these buttons so that we don't see these black color borders that you can see right now so guys let us set the background color for all these buttons with the help of the class name over here so first of all we have the BG blue class in which case we are going to set the background color as blue color over here similarly we are going to set the green and red color background for the classes that is BG green and BG red in this case so guys over here we are going to set the background color as green and for the other class that is BG red we are going to set the background color as red in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see these are the buttons with the different background color that we have provided with the help of the CSS properties and you can see that there is a default Button as well over here which is looking less attractive compared to the other buttons for which we have provided the CSS properties so guys this is the way that you can provide the background color for the different buttons over here now apart from this when we get the cursor on these buttons we need to change the cursor to hand tool so what we can do is for all the buttons in this case that are present inside the diff tag we are going to set the cursor CSS property to the value that is pointer over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so when we get the cursor on the button as you can see it has been converted to the hand tool over here so in this way you can set the cursor properly property as well now guys apart from this let us also see how we can set the button font size so let us move to the HTML file first of all and what we will do is we will copy these lines of code once again and this time we are going to change the class name in order to set the font size over here so let's say we have the font size of 12 pixels first of all and then we have the font size of 16 pixels which is the default font size for the button and then we have the font size of 20 pixels over here and and then guys for the text part instead of blue we are going to have 12 pixels in this case and then apart from this for this green we are going to say 16 pixels which is the font size and then for the red we are going to have 20 pixels over here so we are going to have all these buttons with different font sizes and then apart from this we will also have the background colors for all these buttons so guys simply we are going to set the BG blue for the first button and then followed by BG Green in this case for the second button and then over here we will set BG red for the third button over here so guys in order to apply the CSS properties from multiple classes you can provide the different classes inside the class attribute over here which should be separated with the space character in this way so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser notice that we have CAU all the background colors for these buttons but the font size is not set so far so what we are going to do is we will set the font size using this font 12 font 16 and font 20 classes inside the CSS file so guys over here after this we are going to set the font size equal to 12 for this particular class so simply we are going to set the font size CSS property to 12 pixels over here and then similarly we are going to set the 16 pixels and 20 pixels font size so over here we have font 16 it is equal to 16 pixels and then we have font 20 it is equal to 20 pixels over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have 12 pixels 16 pixels and then 20 pixels font size for all these respective buttons over here now guys apart from this we can also have the rounded buttons as well so what we will do is simply we are going to copy these lines of code once again over here and then what we are going to do is instead of having the font classes over here we will have the class that starts with round over here so guys basically we have round five which will set the Border radius as 5 pixels over here and then we have the round 10 and then we will have the round 50 in which case we are going to set it as 50% in this case so guys over here we will set it as 5 pixels so that we can identify that this is the button with the Border radius as 5 pixels and then we have 10 pixels over here and then in this case we will have 50% over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see we have all all the buttons in this case but we need to provide the Border radius to all these classes so what we are going to do is we will copy this round five over here and then inside the style. CSS file we will have this class name that is around five and then for this class we are going to set the Border radius which will be equal to 5 pixels over here similarly we will copy this line of code for the round 10 and the round 50 classes as well for which case we are going to set the Border radius as 10 pixels and and then 50% respectively so guys over here we have set the Border radius properties as well let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see this is the 5 pixel border radius and Then followed by the 10 pixel border radius for this button and then this is the 50% border radius which means approximately it will be a circular button over here when the width and the height of the button is same so guys in this way you can set the Border radius for a specific button based on your requirements and then apart from this we will also have the colored button borders so guys so far we have provided the colors inside the button but what we are going to do is we will have the button color that is the background color is white but these colors will be the Border colors for these buttons so guys let us check that as well so what we will do is simply I'm going to copy these lines of code over here once again and then we will remove the class names over here from all these buttons so we will set the Border as blue over over here and then apart from this we will set the Border as green for the second button so let me just quickly set the Border green class name and then the last button will have the border red class name and then we will set the text as blue green and red respectively so guys over here we have set the buttons with the Border blue border green and the border red class name so what we have to do is we need to set the background color as white for all these buttons and then we are going to set the Border color for these buttons so let me just copy this class name and then inside the style. CSS file over here simply we are going to provide the CSS properties for these class names so first of all border blue it will have the background color as white color over here and then we need to set the border so let's say we set the Border as one pixel which will be of the solid type in this case and then the color should be blue color over here so guys let me just save this file now and let us see how it looks like on the web browser so on the browser let me just reload this page as you can see we have the Border color as the blue color over here but guys we are not able to see the text because it is of the color white by default so we need to change the color to black as well so guys over here we are going to set the color as black once again and since this particular color property is having the black color over here for this border blue so this black color will be implemented and it will override the previous value that is color equal to White that we had set for the button t tag over here that's because the recent color that we are setting is black in this case so guys always remember whatever the recent CSS property is applied to any of the classes or the Texs that particular CSS property will be implemented or used when that HTML element is displayed on the web browser so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have this blue color button that is getting displayed similarly we need to display the green and the red color buttons as well so we are going to copy these lines of code and change the colors to green and red over here so we have the classes border green and over here instead of having the blue color border we will have the green color border over here and then for the border red class we are going to have the red color border over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the blue green and red buttons in this case for which the background color is white and the Border colors are blue green and red respectively so guys in this way instead of having the background colors you can also have the Border colors and your buttons will look attractive on the website now guys apart from this we can also have the hoverable buttons so over here what we are going to do is when the user gets the mouse cursor on these buttons over here we want to change its background color to the same color so let's say when the user gets the mouse cursor on this blue button over here so the background color should be set as blue and the font color should be set as white so what we can do is simply for this border blue class we need to define the Pudo class that is hover so guys simply we are going to copy this border blue class name followed by colon and then on Hover event which is the sudo class we need to set the background color as blue color in this case so basically we are setting the background color as blue and we want to set the color as white so that the text color can be dis played properly on this particular background color that is set as blue so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so by default as you can see this is the button that is getting displayed but when the user gets the mouse cursor on this blue button over here the background color is getting updated so guys in this way you can set the hover effect on the green and the red buttons as well so let us do that as well quickly so simply we are going to copy these lines of code and over here instead of having the blue we are going to have the B green class name for which the background color should be green color over here and for the border red hover event we are going to have the background color as red in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser when we get the mouse cursor on green button you can see that the background color is updated to green and the red button the background color is updated to Red in this way we can have the hover effect on the buttons as well based on the CSS properties that we have seen by using the h event over here now guys apart from this we can also have the shadow for the buttons so let us create another button over here with the class button Shadow so guys let me just change the class name to BTN and then we have Shadow over here and basically we are going to change the text to Shadow button in this case so guys we have another button that is Shadow button over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so this is the button that is getting displayed over here let us change the SS properties for this button Shadow so let me just copy this class name and then paste this over here after the dot character and what we are going to do is we will set the background color as aqua color over here we will set the text color as black color in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the shadow button over here now guys in order to create the shadow for this button we can simply use the Box Shadow CSS property so over here inside the button Shadow class we will have the box Shadow CSS property and first of all we will have to set the horizontal Shadow so let's say we have 2 pixels of horizontal Shadow and then 2 pixels of vertical Shadow and then we need to provide the blur effect so let's say 5 pixels of blur effect and the color of the shadow that we want to display so let's say we have the black color over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the black color shadow that is getting displayed over here apart from this we can also have the multiple Shadows so after the black color we can provide comma and then let's say we provide 0 pixels for horizontal and vertical Shadow and then for the blur effect let's say we provide 20 pixels of blur effect over here and then apart from this let us say we have the color of the Shadow as blue after this black color shadow so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page you will notice that after this black color shadow there will be the blue color shadow that will be displayed for this particular shadow button so when we reload this page you can see that there is a blue color shadow that is getting displayed over here which is making this button look more attractive on the web page so guys this is the way that you can provide the shadow effect for the button and the other effects as well based on the CSS properties that we have seen so far for the button HTML element so guys comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and
