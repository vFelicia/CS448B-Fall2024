00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to copy the file content
00:06 - from one file to another file so guys
00:08 - this Python program will help you to
00:11 - copy the content of one file to another
00:13 - file that is from source to destination
00:15 - we will use the sh util module so guys
00:18 - this is one of the important modules in
00:20 - the Python program which is having copy
00:23 - file function which can help us in order
00:25 - to copy the content from one file to
00:27 - another file so let us check this with
00:29 - the help of example now over here so
00:31 - what we are going to do is we are going
00:33 - to import the sh util module so we use
00:36 - the from keyword and then we have sh
00:39 - util in this case so guys inside this
00:42 - module we are going to have the copy
00:44 - file function so we use the import
00:46 - function and then we say copy file so
00:49 - guys this is one of the ways in order to
00:52 - import the function from a particular
00:54 - module if we don't want to import the
00:56 - entire module but only want to import a
00:59 - particular a function from a module we
01:01 - can use this statement by using the from
01:03 - keyword and Then followed by the module
01:06 - name and then we use the import keyword
01:08 - and then the function that we want to
01:10 - import and then guys what we can do is
01:12 - simply we can use this copy file
01:14 - function in order to copy the content
01:16 - from one file to another file so over
01:19 - here it takes two parameters the first
01:21 - parameter will be the source file and
01:23 - then the second parameter will be the
01:25 - destination file so guys I have two
01:27 - files over here that is the output file
01:29 - which is going to be the source file
01:31 - over here right now so when I open this
01:33 - file as you can see it is having certain
01:35 - statements that is this is first line
01:38 - and then we have this a second line and
01:40 - then we have this is another statement
01:42 - over here so this is some test content
01:44 - that I have written in the output file
01:46 - what we are going to do is all these
01:49 - statements we are going to copy from the
01:51 - output file and paste it inside the test
01:53 - file over here as you can see so if I
01:56 - open this test file it is not having any
01:58 - content right now so we we are going to
02:00 - copy the content from the output file to
02:03 - the test file by using the copy file
02:05 - function over here so let us move to the
02:08 - vs code right now so the very first
02:10 - thing is it is expecting the source file
02:12 - so inside the double quotes we provide
02:14 - the entire path of this directory over
02:17 - here so I'll simply copy this and paste
02:20 - this and then guys in order to escape
02:21 - this backslash we have to provide
02:23 - another backslash over here so I'll
02:26 - quickly provide the extra backslash in
02:28 - front of the single backslashes and then
02:31 - guys we again provide the double
02:32 - backslash and then the name of the file
02:34 - so which is the output.txt so I'll
02:37 - simply copy this and paste this over
02:39 - here this is the output followed by Dot
02:41 - and then we have txt now guys the second
02:44 - parameter will be the destination file
02:46 - so over here I provide comma and then I
02:49 - come to the next line so that it becomes
02:51 - more readable and then again since the
02:53 - destination file that is the test file
02:55 - is present in the same directory I am
02:58 - going to provide the same directory over
02:59 - here once again so I'll copy this and
03:02 - paste this over here and then again I'll
03:04 - escape this backslash character once
03:07 - again on all the instances now guys in
03:09 - the end we have to provide the
03:10 - destination file over here which is test
03:12 - file right now so we have test dot txt
03:15 - in this case so we have test.txt so guys
03:19 - basically the first parameter is the
03:20 - output.txt file the entire path of this
03:24 - file and then we have the test.txt so
03:27 - both these parameters are provided in
03:29 - the copy file right now so guys what we
03:31 - will do is after this we can simply have
03:33 - the print statement over here and then
03:35 - we can simply say file content copy
03:40 - successfully so get we get certain
03:42 - message about the success of this
03:44 - operation in order to copy the content
03:47 - of one file into another file so guys
03:49 - let me just save this file now and try
03:51 - running this code so as you can see we
03:53 - are getting file content copied
03:54 - successfully now we have to go inside
03:57 - that directory and open this file that
03:59 - is a test file which is the destination
04:01 - file so when I open this as you can see
04:03 - we are getting the content of that file
04:05 - which was present inside the output so
04:08 - let me open that output file as well so
04:10 - these were the statements and then the
04:12 - same statements we are getting in the
04:14 - test file as well so as you can see we
04:16 - are getting this is first line and then
04:17 - we have this is second line and then we
04:19 - have this is another statement so guys
04:21 - in this way we can easily copy the
04:23 - content of one file to another file by
04:25 - using the copy file function inside the
04:28 - sh util module now guys what happens if
04:30 - we copy the content of another file to
04:33 - the same test file over here currently
04:35 - it is having certain content so whether
04:37 - it will append the new statements from
04:39 - the new source file or whether it will
04:41 - overwrite the entire content let us
04:43 - check this so basically as you can see
04:45 - we have another file that is the names
04:47 - file it is having the list of certain
04:49 - names over here so what we are going to
04:51 - do is we are going to use this file as
04:53 - the source file now so I'll simply open
04:56 - the vs code over here instead of
04:58 - output.txt we will send provide
05:00 - names.txt so that our source file right
05:03 - now is different that is the names file
05:05 - the destination file is same that is a
05:07 - test file so let me just save this file
05:09 - now and try running this code once again
05:11 - so as you can see file content copied
05:13 - successfully if I come over here in the
05:15 - directory and open this test file once
05:18 - again as you can see we are getting the
05:19 - names now and the previous content of
05:22 - the output file has been overwritten now
05:24 - so guys this is important functionality
05:26 - whenever you are using the copy file
05:28 - function the entire content will be
05:31 - overwritten in the destination file if
05:33 - it is having any content and let's say
05:35 - if this file is not present let's say I
05:37 - delete this file so what will happen
05:39 - whether the Python program will help us
05:41 - in order to create that file and copy
05:43 - the content from that file let us check
05:45 - that so I'll just run this code once
05:47 - again over here when this file is not
05:49 - present right now that is the test.txt
05:51 - is not present in the directory that we
05:54 - have mentioned so when I run this code
05:56 - as you can see it says file content
05:58 - copied successfully when I come over
06:00 - again in the directory so test file is
06:03 - being created right now so if there is
06:05 - no file that is created a new file will
06:07 - be created and inside that we will get
06:09 - the content of the source file so guys
06:11 - this is the functionality of the copy
06:13 - file function inside the sh util so
06:16 - please make sure that you practice on
06:18 - your own so that on different inputs you
06:19 - get different outputs make sure that you
06:21 - like this video so that it reaches to
06:23 - more people and subscribe to this
06:25 - channel so that you get the
06:26 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
06:28 - the next video that we are going to talk
06:30 - about is Python program to concatenate
06:33 - to list so stay tuned

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to copy the file content from one file to another file so guys this Python program will help you to copy the content of one file to another file that is from source to destination we will use the sh util module so guys this is one of the important modules in the Python program which is having copy file

the sh util module so we use the from keyword and then we have sh util in this case so guys inside this module we are going to have the copy file function so we use the import function and then we say copy file so guys this is one of the ways in order to import the function from a particular module if we don't want to import the entire module but only want to import a particular a function from a module we can use this statement by using the from keyword and Then followed by the module name and then we use the import keyword and then the function that we want to import and then guys what we can do is simply we can use this copy file function in order to copy the content from one file to another file so over here it takes two parameters the first parameter will be the source file and then the second parameter will be the destination file so guys I have two files over here that is the output file which is going to be the source file over here right now so when I open this file as you can see it is having certain statements that is this is first line and then we have this a second line and then we have this is another statement over here so this is some test content that I have written in the output file what we are going to do is all these statements we are going to copy from the output file and paste it inside the test file over here as you can see so if I open this test file it is not having any content right now so we we are going to copy the content from the output file to the test file by using the copy file function over here so let us move to the vs code right now so the very first thing is it is expecting the source file so inside the double quotes we provide the entire path of this directory over here so I'll simply copy this and paste this and then guys in order to escape this backslash we have to provide another backslash over here so I'll quickly provide the extra backslash in front of the single backslashes and then guys we again provide the double backslash and then the name of the file so which is the output.txt so I'll simply copy this and paste this over here this is the output followed by Dot and then we have txt now guys the second parameter will be the destination file so over here I provide comma and then I come to the next line so that it becomes more readable and then again since the destination file that is the test file is present in the same directory I am going to provide the same directory over here once again so I'll copy this and paste this over here and then again I'll escape this backslash character once again on all the instances now guys in the end we have to provide the destination file over here which is test file right now so we have test dot txt in this case so we have test.txt so guys basically the first parameter is the output.txt file the entire path of this file and then we have the test.txt so both these parameters are provided in the copy file right now so guys what we will do is after this we can simply have the print statement over here and then we can simply say file content copy successfully so get we get certain message about the success of this operation in order to copy the content of one file into another file so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting file content copied successfully now we have to go inside that directory and open this file that is a test file which is the destination file so when I open this as you can see we are getting the content of that file which was present inside the output so let me

this is second line and then we have this is another statement so guys in this way we can easily copy the content of one file to another file by using the copy file function inside the sh util module now guys what happens if we copy the content of another file to the same test file over here currently it is having certain content so whether it will append the new statements from the new source file or whether it will overwrite the entire content let us check this so basically as you can see we have another file that is the names file it is having the list of certain names over here so what

is not present let's say I delete this file so what will happen whether the Python program will help us in order to create that file and copy the content from that file let us check that so I'll just run this code once again over here when this file is not present right now that is the test.txt is not present in the directory that we have mentioned so when I run this code as you can see it says file content copied successfully when I come over again in the directory so test file is being created right now so if there is no file that is created a new file will be created and inside that we will get the content of the source file so guys this is the functionality of the copy file function inside the sh util so please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video
