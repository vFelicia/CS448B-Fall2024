00:00 - so now we will see box sizing property
00:02 - in CSS so guys basically the CSS box
00:05 - sizing property allows us to include the
00:07 - padding and the Border in an HTML
00:10 - elements total width and height so guys
00:12 - this we are going to check with the help
00:14 - of examples as well so by default we
00:16 - have seen so far the width and height of
00:18 - an element is calculated like below so
00:21 - basically whatever width we provide to
00:23 - the HTML element that is considered and
00:25 - then the padding and the border is also
00:28 - considered in order to to calculate the
00:31 - actual width of the HTML element similar
00:33 - cases with the height attribute as well
00:35 - so when we have the height of the HTML
00:38 - element the padding and the border is
00:40 - also added in order to calculate the
00:43 - actual height of the element so guys we
00:45 - can simply use the Box sizing property
00:48 - in order to avoid the confusion and also
00:50 - include the padding and the Border
00:53 - within the width and height that is
00:54 - already specified for the HTML element
00:57 - so guys let us move to the vs code over
00:59 - here and simply inside the HTML file we
01:01 - are going to create two div tags over
01:04 - here the first div tag is having the
01:05 - class name that is div 1 in this case
01:08 - and then we will say this is a sample
01:11 - diff one over here and then similarly we
01:13 - will have another diff tag with the
01:15 - class that is div 2 in this case so
01:17 - basically we will have div 2 and then
01:20 - over here as well we will update it as
01:22 - div 2 over here apart from this between
01:24 - both the diff Texs we will have the line
01:26 - break so let me just save this file now
01:28 - and try reloading this page once again
01:29 - on the browser as you can see we have
01:31 - SIMPLE statements that is this is a
01:33 - sample div 1 and Sample div 2 over here
01:36 - now guys let us provide certain styling
01:38 - inside the style. CSS file so for the
01:40 - very first class that is d one over here
01:43 - we will specify the width of 300 pixels
01:46 - in this case and a height of 100 pixels
01:48 - over here and then apart from this we
01:50 - will also set the border so let's say we
01:52 - have two pixels solid border with the
01:55 - color that is black color over here now
01:57 - guys similarly we will provide the CSS
01:59 - properties for the second diff tag over
02:01 - here that is having the class name diff
02:03 - 2 in this case and again we are going to
02:05 - have the width and height that is 300
02:08 - pixels and 100 pixels respectively we
02:10 - will have the different color border and
02:12 - for the Border part we will have a
02:14 - different color so let's say we have the
02:16 - Border color is blue color over here let
02:18 - me just save this file now and try
02:19 - reloading this page once again on the
02:21 - browser so as you can see we have the
02:23 - first diff tag which is having the width
02:25 - as 300 pixels and the height as 100
02:27 - pixels over here and for the div two tag
02:29 - as well we have the same width and
02:31 - height values over here we have a
02:33 - different border color in this case that
02:35 - is blue color now guys what we will do
02:37 - is let us provide certain padding to
02:39 - this particular diff tag that is the
02:40 - second diff tag over here so simply
02:43 - inside the diff two selector we will
02:45 - have the padding CSS selector and let's
02:47 - say we have 20 pixels as padding so guys
02:49 - what will happen is apart from the width
02:51 - and height of this particular diff tag
02:54 - the padding number will also be added
02:56 - and it will increase the width and
02:58 - height of the diff tag so let us check
02:59 - that as well so when we save this file
03:01 - now and try reloading this page once
03:03 - again on the browser if you notice now
03:05 - the size of this particular diff tag
03:07 - that is the second diff tag over here is
03:10 - more compared to the first diff tag and
03:12 - if you notice in the code we have the
03:14 - same width and height value over here
03:16 - that is 300 pixels and 100 pixels for
03:19 - the div 1 and div 2 as well so as you
03:21 - can see the width and height of div 2 is
03:23 - also 300 and 100 pixels respectively so
03:26 - guys this is the issue as far as the
03:28 - width and height of the HTML elements
03:30 - are concerned on the same page so in
03:32 - order to avoid this issue simply we can
03:34 - use the Box sizing CSS property over
03:37 - here so guys when we say box sizing we
03:39 - have the value as border box in which
03:41 - case the padding attribute will also be
03:43 - included within the width and height
03:45 - that you have already specified over
03:47 - here within this selector so when we
03:49 - save this file now and try reloading
03:51 - this page once again on the browser if
03:53 - you see now the exact width and height
03:56 - of this particular diff tag that is diff
03:58 - 2 is 3 100 pixels respectively since we
04:01 - have provided the Box sizing as border
04:04 - box so guys basically the content and
04:06 - the padding will be adjusted accordingly
04:09 - apart from that the Border will be also
04:10 - adjusted in such a way that the actual
04:13 - width and height of this particular diff
04:15 - tag should be 300 pixels and 100 pixels
04:18 - now guys if you notice the first diff
04:20 - tag is little bit larger as far as the
04:22 - width is concerned compared to the
04:24 - second diff tag why so because the
04:26 - border of two pixels is taking the extra
04:29 - space over here for the first div tag so
04:31 - again if we provide the Box sizing CSS
04:34 - property for the first div tag over here
04:36 - and we provide the value as border box
04:39 - this particular issue should get
04:40 - resolved so let me just save this file
04:42 - now and when we reload this page so now
04:44 - if you notice the width of this
04:46 - particular div 1 is exactly the same as
04:48 - that of the div 2 HTML element over here
04:51 - that's because we are using the Box
04:53 - sizing equal to border box for both
04:56 - these diff tags in this case so guys in
04:58 - this way in order to avoid the confusion
05:00 - and to be consistent as far as the width
05:03 - and height of the HTML elements are
05:05 - concerned it is very important that you
05:07 - use the Box sizing CSS property for all
05:09 - the HTML elements so instead of
05:12 - providing it to individual CSS selectors
05:14 - across the multiple CSS selectors over
05:17 - here let me just save this file now and
05:18 - try reloading this page once again
05:20 - without the Box sizing CSS property you
05:23 - will notice that the dimensions are
05:24 - different but simply you can have the
05:26 - universal selector over here with the
05:28 - help of the star and then in this case
05:30 - you can simply provide the Box sizing to
05:32 - all the CSS selectors over here so
05:34 - simply with this particular single line
05:36 - of code within the universal selector
05:39 - the dimensions of all the HTML elements
05:41 - will be consistent so guys let me just
05:43 - save this file now and try reloading
05:45 - this page once again on the browser as
05:47 - you can see the width and height of both
05:49 - these diff tags are same that is 300
05:51 - pixels and 100 pixels respectively and
05:54 - apart from this the second div is also
05:56 - having the required padding of 20 pixels
05:58 - that we have provided provided over here
06:00 - so guys in this way you can easily use
06:02 - the Box sizing CSS property in order to
06:05 - be consistent as far as the dimensions
06:07 - of the HTML elements are concerned in
06:09 - your project this will help you in order
06:11 - to include the padding and the Border
06:13 - withd as well within the width and the
06:15 - height of the HTML element so guys

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see box sizing property in CSS so guys basically the CSS box sizing property allows us to include the padding and the Border in an HTML elements total width and height so guys this we are going to check with the help of examples as well so by default we have seen so far the width and height of an element is calculated like below so basically whatever width we provide to the HTML element that is considered and then the padding and the border is also considered in order to to calculate the actual width of the HTML element similar cases with the height attribute as well so when we have the height of the HTML element the padding and the border is also added in order to calculate the actual height of the element so guys we can simply use the Box sizing property in order to avoid the confusion and also include the padding and the Border within the width and height that is already specified for the HTML element so guys let us move to the vs code over here and simply inside the HTML file we are going to create two div tags over here the first div tag is having the class name that is div 1 in this case and then we will say this is a sample diff one over here and then similarly we will have another diff tag with the class that is div 2 in this case so basically we will have div 2 and then over here as well we will update it as div 2 over here apart from this between both the diff Texs we will have the line break so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see we have SIMPLE statements that is this is a sample div 1 and Sample div 2 over here now guys let us provide certain styling inside the style. CSS file so for the very first class that is d one over here we will specify the width of 300 pixels in this case and a height of 100 pixels over here and then apart from this we will also set the border so let's say we have two pixels solid border with the color that is black color over here now guys similarly we will provide the CSS properties for the second diff tag over here that is having the class name diff 2 in this case and again we are going to have the width and height that is 300 pixels and 100 pixels respectively we will have the different color border and for the Border part we will have a different color so let's say we have the Border color is blue color over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the first diff tag which is having the width as 300 pixels and the height as 100 pixels over here and for the div two tag as well we have the same width and height values over here we have a different border color in this case that is blue color now guys what we will do is let us provide certain padding to this particular diff tag that is the second diff tag over here so simply inside the diff two selector we will have the padding CSS selector and let's say we have 20 pixels as padding so guys what will happen is apart from the width and height of this particular diff tag the padding number will also be added and it will increase the width and height of the diff tag so let us check that as well so when we save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser if you notice now the size of this particular diff tag that is the second diff tag over here is more compared to the first diff tag and if you notice in the code we have the same width and height value over here that is 300 pixels and 100 pixels for the div 1 and div 2 as well so as you can see the width and height of div 2 is also 300 and 100 pixels respectively so guys this is the issue as far as the width and height of the HTML elements are concerned on the same page so in order to avoid this issue simply we can use the Box sizing CSS property over here so guys when we say box sizing we have the value as border box in which case the padding attribute will also be included within the width and height that you have already specified over here within this selector so when we save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser if you see now the exact width and height of this particular diff tag that is diff 2 is 3 100 pixels respectively since we have provided the Box sizing as border box so guys basically the content and the padding will be adjusted accordingly apart from that the Border will be also adjusted in such a way that the actual width and height of this particular diff tag should be 300 pixels and 100 pixels now guys if you notice the first diff tag is little bit larger as far as the width is concerned compared to the second diff tag why so because the border of two pixels is taking the extra space over here for the first div tag so again if we provide the Box sizing CSS property for the first div tag over here and we provide the value as border box this particular issue should get resolved so let me just save this file now and when we reload this page so now if you notice the width of this particular div 1 is exactly the same as that of the div 2 HTML element over here that's because we are using the Box sizing equal to border box for both these diff tags in this case so guys in this way in order to avoid the confusion and to be
