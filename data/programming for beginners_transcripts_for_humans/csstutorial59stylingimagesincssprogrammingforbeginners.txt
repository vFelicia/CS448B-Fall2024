With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see styling images in CSS
00:03 - so guys we can use the various CSS
00:05 - properties in order to style the images
00:08 - and this we are going to check with the
00:09 - help of examples as well so first of all
00:12 - we will see how we can create the
00:14 - rounded images so guys let us move to
00:16 - the vs code over here and simply we are
00:18 - going to remove the previous lines of
00:20 - code that we had written in the HTML and
00:23 - the CSS files over here now guys what we
00:25 - are going to do is simply we are going
00:27 - to have the diff tag over here with the
00:30 - class name that is container in this
00:32 - case so we have this class name that is
00:35 - container for this DP tag now guys apart
00:38 - from this we will also have the image
00:40 - over here inside this container and this
00:42 - image should have the SRC attribute and
00:45 - the value that we are going to provide
00:48 - is the directory path of the image which
00:51 - we have already saved over here inside
00:53 - the directory where we have the HTML
00:55 - file so guys we have the sample Forest
00:57 - image. JPG file in this case and let's
01:00 - say we have the alternate text S test
01:03 - image over here so this IMG tag will
01:06 - help us in order to display the image on
01:09 - the web browser let me just save this
01:11 - file now and let us move to the style.
01:13 - CSS file over here and we will provide
01:15 - the width and height for this particular
01:17 - image so guys let's say we provide the
01:20 - width as 300 pixels and the height as
01:22 - 300 pixels as well so that the image is
01:25 - displayed as a square box over here let
01:28 - me just save this file now and try
01:30 - reloading this page on the browser so as
01:32 - you can see this is the image that is
01:34 - getting displayed right now so guys
01:36 - first of all we will see how we can make
01:38 - this image appear as a rounded image so
01:41 - it should be displayed inside the circle
01:44 - so guys what we are going to do is we
01:45 - need to convert the square shape image
01:48 - into a circular shape image so simply we
01:50 - can use the Border radius CSS property
01:53 - so over here we say border radius in
01:55 - this case and the value must be 50%
01:58 - always remember that if you want some
02:00 - HTML element to have a circular shape we
02:03 - can simply provide the Border radius CSS
02:06 - property and the value must be 50% over
02:08 - here let me just save this file now and
02:10 - try reloading this page once again on
02:12 - the browser so as you can see we have
02:14 - the rounded image that is getting
02:16 - displayed right now apart from this we
02:18 - can also display the thumbnail images
02:21 - with the border so what we will do is
02:22 - simply I'm going to comment out this
02:24 - line of code over here and we will have
02:27 - the border of 2 pixels with the border
02:30 - type that is solid and the Border color
02:32 - that is black color in this case apart
02:34 - from this we will also have certain
02:36 - padding so that we can see the Border
02:38 - clearly and there is certain spacing in
02:41 - between the image and the border of the
02:43 - image let me just save this file now and
02:45 - try reloading this page once again on
02:47 - the browser so as you can see after this
02:49 - image we have the border which is having
02:51 - the width as 2 pixels and the color is
02:53 - black right now apart from this we can
02:55 - also have the box Shadow for this border
02:58 - so what we are going to do is simply we
03:00 - are going to provide the Box Shadow CSS
03:03 - property and we can say 0 pixels as
03:05 - horizontal Shadow and then 0 pixels as
03:08 - vertical Shadow and simply we can
03:10 - provide the 5 pixels blur effect and the
03:12 - color must be dark blue over here so
03:15 - guys basically the first parameter is
03:16 - the horizontal Shadow followed by the
03:18 - vertical shadow that you can provide and
03:21 - then we have something called as blur
03:22 - effect that will help us in order to
03:24 - spread the color that we provide as the
03:27 - fourth parameter which is dark blue in
03:29 - this case let me just save this file now
03:31 - and try reloading this page once again
03:33 - on the browser as you can see we have
03:35 - the dark blue box Shadow over here apart
03:38 - from this we can also have the multiple
03:40 - shadows as well so after comma we can
03:43 - provide another Shadow so let's say in
03:45 - this case we have 20 pixels of blur
03:47 - effect and the color is blue so we are
03:50 - providing the blue color for the Box
03:52 - Shadow and let me just reload this page
03:54 - as you can see this is a blue color that
03:56 - is spreading out across 20 pixels over
03:59 - here after after the border of the image
04:01 - so guys in this way we can provide the
04:03 - cool CSS properties in order to make our
04:06 - images look more attractive over here
04:09 - apart from this we can also have the
04:10 - responsive images as well so guys let me
04:13 - just increase the width of this
04:14 - particular image to let's say 450 pixels
04:17 - over here so when we provide 450 pixels
04:20 - let me just save this file now the width
04:21 - of this particular image must increase
04:23 - when we reload this page so as you can
04:25 - see this is the 450 pixels width and 300
04:28 - pixels height right right now but guys
04:30 - when we decrease the size of this
04:33 - browser so let us see what will happen
04:35 - so when we are decreasing the width of
04:37 - the browser slowly as you can see the
04:39 - image is getting cropped and certain
04:41 - information from the image cannot be
04:43 - seen without scrolling the horizontal
04:46 - bar right now so guys on smaller devices
04:48 - it is very important that the images
04:51 - scale themselves up or down so when the
04:54 - screen size is decreasing the image size
04:56 - must also decrease at the same time so
04:59 - that the ENT enre image is displayed on
05:01 - the 100% width of the screen so guys in
05:04 - order to solve this issue we can use the
05:06 - max withd CSS property over here so let
05:09 - me just expand this browser and simply
05:12 - we are going to use the max with CSS
05:14 - property in this case for the image tag
05:17 - and it must be set to 100% over here so
05:20 - let me just save this file now so guys
05:22 - what is the meaning of this Max width
05:24 - basically we are telling the browser to
05:26 - have the maximum width of this image
05:28 - equal to 100% % of the width of the
05:31 - screen so even if your page is displayed
05:33 - on the smaller screen the 100% width of
05:36 - the screen will be taken as the maximum
05:38 - width for the image and there will be no
05:40 - horizontal scroll bar that must be
05:42 - displayed so guys let me just save this
05:44 - file now and try reloading this page so
05:47 - now if we decrease the size of the
05:48 - browser so as you can see we are
05:50 - decreasing the size you can see that the
05:52 - image width is also decreasing over here
05:55 - so this is the way that we can create
05:57 - the responsive images with the help of
06:00 - the max with CSS property in this case
06:02 - now guys apart from this we can also
06:04 - Center an image so how do we do that by
06:07 - default the display CSS property for
06:10 - this image is in line so simply we need
06:12 - to set the display property as block
06:14 - over here so that we can simply use the
06:17 - margin CSS property and the value must
06:20 - be Auto in this case so guys basically
06:22 - for any HTML element that is having the
06:25 - display equal to block we can use the
06:28 - margin CSS property as Auto in order to
06:31 - get that HTML element at the center of
06:33 - the screen horizontally so let me just
06:35 - save this file now and try reloading
06:38 - this page once again on the browser so
06:40 - as you can see now the image is getting
06:42 - displayed at the center of the screen as
06:44 - far as horizontal alignment is concerned
06:47 - guys apart from this we can also make
06:49 - the images transparent by using the
06:51 - opacity CSS property so by default we
06:54 - have the opacity as one over here simply
06:57 - we can set the opacity as 0 .5 which
07:00 - means we are providing 50% transparency
07:03 - for this image let me just reload this
07:05 - page as you can see we have provided the
07:07 - transparency effect over here we can
07:09 - also increase the transparency by
07:11 - providing the opacity equal to 0.3 over
07:14 - here let me just save this file now and
07:16 - try reloading this page as you can see
07:19 - we have increased more transparency
07:21 - effect for this particular image that is
07:23 - getting displayed on the browser now
07:25 - guys apart from this we also can provide
07:28 - the text on the image image so what we
07:30 - can do is let's say we want to provide
07:32 - the text that is another diff tag over
07:35 - here inside the container so we will say
07:38 - diff followed by the class name that is
07:40 - text over here and simply we are going
07:42 - to say Simple Text in this case now guys
07:45 - let me just save this file now and try
07:46 - reloading this page once again on the
07:48 - browser as you can see the simple text
07:50 - is getting displayed over here after the
07:53 - image but we want to display it on the
07:55 - image over here somewhere at the top
07:58 - left corner so what we can do is first
08:01 - of all let us remove this margin equal
08:02 - to Auto and display equal to block
08:05 - property so that the image is getting
08:07 - displayed at the left of the screen over
08:09 - here so as you can see the image is
08:11 - getting displayed right now at the left
08:13 - of the screen and we only want this text
08:15 - to be displayed at the top left
08:18 - Direction over here on the image so
08:20 - simply for the container class that is
08:23 - the diff tag which is the parent tag
08:25 - over here for both the image and the
08:27 - other diff tag over here we need to Pro
08:29 - provide the position property as
08:31 - relative so simply we will say container
08:34 - and then for this container we will
08:36 - provide the position property over here
08:38 - as relative in this case so guys
08:40 - basically we have the position property
08:42 - as relative and for the image we will
08:45 - provide the position property as
08:47 - absolute and for the other diff tag that
08:49 - is having the simple text we will also
08:51 - provide the position property as
08:53 - relative so over here we have the class
08:55 - name that is text in this case and then
08:58 - we say position it is equal to Absolute
09:01 - over here and not relative so guys let
09:03 - me just save this file now and try
09:05 - reloading this page once again on the
09:07 - browser as you can see both the image
09:09 - and the simple text is now getting
09:11 - displayed and the top and the left CSS
09:14 - property for both these tags right now
09:17 - is zero over here now simply we can
09:19 - provide the top and left CSS property in
09:22 - order to provide certain spacing for
09:24 - this text so what we can do is inside
09:27 - the dot text over here we will provide
09:30 - the top as 5 pixels and also the left as
09:33 - 5 pixels over here you can also provide
09:36 - percentages as well let me just save
09:38 - this file now and try reloading this
09:40 - page as you can see there is certain
09:42 - spacing at the top and at the left as
09:44 - well let us provide the percentages
09:46 - instead of pixels so that we get more
09:48 - spacing over here so when we reload this
09:50 - page as you can see we are getting the
09:52 - simple text at the top left corner of
09:55 - this particular image so guys in this
09:57 - way you can provide the different CS ACC
09:59 - properties for the image in order to
10:01 - style them based on your requirements
10:04 - because apart from this we also have
10:05 - something called as image filters over
10:07 - here so simply inside the IMG tag we can
10:10 - simply provide the filter CSS property
10:13 - and then as you can see there are
10:15 - different methods that you can use and
10:17 - provide the different values as well so
10:19 - let's say we have the brightness
10:21 - function that we are going to use so let
10:23 - us increase the brightness to 150 let me
10:26 - just save this file now and try
10:28 - reloading this page once again again on
10:29 - the browser so as you can see the
10:31 - brightness is increasing now so guys we
10:33 - have provided the opacity at 0.3 let us
10:36 - provide the opacity as one so as you can
10:38 - see this has increased the brightness
10:41 - right now so guys when we provide the
10:42 - brightness equal to two over here inside
10:44 - the parenthesis and when we reload this
10:47 - page as you can see the brightness of
10:48 - the image is increasing apart from this
10:51 - there are many other methods that you
10:53 - can use we can also use the blur effect
10:55 - over here so let us check that as well
10:57 - so if we provide two pixels of blur
10:59 - effect as you can see there is blur
11:01 - effect to some extent for this
11:03 - particular image so guys you can use any
11:05 - of the methods that is provided by the
11:07 - filter over here in order to style your
11:10 - images based on your project
11:11 - requirements so guys comment in the

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see styling images in CSS so guys we can use the various CSS properties in order to style the images and this we are going to check with the help of examples as well so first of all we will see how we can create the rounded images so guys let us move to the vs code over here and simply we are going to remove the previous lines of code that we had written in the HTML and the CSS files over here now guys what we are going to do is simply we are going to have the diff tag over here with the class name that is container in this case so we have this class name that is container for this DP tag now guys apart from this we will also have the image over here inside this container and this image should have the SRC attribute and the value that we are going to provide is the directory path of the image which we have already saved over here inside the directory where we have the HTML file so guys we have the sample Forest image. JPG file in this case and let's say we have the alternate text S test image over here so this IMG tag will help us in order to display the image on the web browser let me just save this file now and let us move to the style. CSS file over here and we will provide the width and height for this particular image so guys let's say we provide the width as 300 pixels and the height as 300 pixels as well so that the image is displayed as a square box over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see this is the image that is getting displayed right now so guys first of all we will see how we can make this image appear as a rounded image so it should be displayed inside the circle so guys what we are going to do is we need to convert the square shape image into a circular shape image so simply we can use the Border radius CSS property so over here we say border radius in this case and the value must be 50% always remember that if you want some HTML element to have a circular shape we can simply provide the Border radius CSS property and the value must be 50% over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the rounded image that is getting displayed right now apart from this we can also display the thumbnail images with the border so what we will do is simply I'm going to comment out this line of code over here and we will have the border of 2 pixels with the border type that is solid and the Border color that is black color in this case apart from this we will also have certain padding so that we can see the Border clearly and there is certain spacing in between the image and the border of the image let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see after this image we have the border which is having the width as 2 pixels and the color is black right now apart from this we can also have the box Shadow for this border so what we are going to do is simply we are going to provide the Box Shadow CSS property and we can say 0 pixels as horizontal Shadow and then 0 pixels as vertical Shadow and simply we can provide the 5 pixels blur effect and the color must be dark blue over here so guys basically the first parameter is the horizontal Shadow followed by the vertical shadow that you can provide and then we have something called as blur effect that will help us in order to spread the color that we provide as the fourth parameter which is dark blue in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see we have the dark blue box Shadow over here apart from this we can also have the multiple shadows as well so after comma we can provide another Shadow so let's say in this case we have 20 pixels of blur effect and the color is blue so we are providing the blue color for the Box Shadow and let me just reload this page as you can see this is a blue color that is spreading out across 20 pixels over here after after the border of the image so guys in this way we can provide the cool CSS properties in order to make our images look more attractive over here apart from this we can also have the responsive images as well so guys let me just increase the width of this particular image to let's say 450 pixels over here so when we provide 450 pixels let me just save this file now the width of this particular image must increase when we reload this page so as you can see this is the 450 pixels width and 300 pixels height right right now but guys when we decrease the size of this browser so let us see what will happen so when we are decreasing the width of the browser slowly as you can see the image is getting cropped and certain information from the image cannot be seen without scrolling the horizontal bar right now so guys on smaller devices it is very important that the images scale themselves up or down so when the screen size is decreasing the image size must also decrease at the same time so that the ENT enre image is displayed on the 100% width of the screen so guys in order to solve this issue we can use the max withd CSS property over here so let me just expand this browser and simply we are going to use the max with CSS property in this case for the image tag and it must be set to 100% over here so let me just save this file now so guys what is the meaning of this Max width basically we are telling the browser to have the maximum width of this image equal to 100% % of the width of the screen so even if your page is displayed on the smaller screen the 100% width of the screen will be taken as the maximum width for the image and there will be no horizontal scroll bar that must be displayed so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so now if we decrease the size of the browser so as you can see we are decreasing the size you can see that the image width is also decreasing over here so this is the way that we can create the responsive images with the help of the max with CSS property in this case now guys apart from this we can also Center an image so how do we do that by default the display CSS property for this image is in line so simply we need to set the display property as block over here so that we can simply use the margin CSS property and the

simply we can set the opacity as 0 .5 which means we are providing 50% transparency for this image let me just reload this page as you can see we have provided the transparency effect over here we can also increase the transparency by providing the opacity equal to 0.3 over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see we have increased more transparency effect for this particular image that is getting displayed on the browser now guys apart from this we also can provide the text on the image image so what we can do is let's say we want to provide the text that is another diff tag over here inside the container so we will say diff followed by the class name that is text over here and simply we are going to say Simple Text in this case now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see the simple text is getting displayed over here after the image but we want to display it on the image over here somewhere at the top left corner so what we can do is first of all let us remove this margin equal to Auto and display equal to block property so that the image is getting displayed at the left of the screen over here so as you can see the image is getting displayed right now at the left of the screen and we only want this text to be displayed at the top left Direction over here on the image so simply for the container class that is the diff tag which is the parent tag over here for both the image and the other diff tag over here we need to Pro provide the position property as relative so simply we will say container and then for this container we will provide the position property over here as relative in this case so guys basically we have the position property as relative and for the image we will provide the position property as absolute and for the other diff tag that is having the simple text we will also provide the position property as relative so over here we have the class name that is text in this case and then we say position it is equal to Absolute over here and not relative so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see both the image and the simple text is now getting displayed and the top and the left CSS property for both these tags right now is zero over here now simply we can provide the top and left CSS property in order to provide certain spacing for this text so what we can do is inside the dot text over here we will provide the top as 5 pixels and also the left as 5 pixels over here you can also provide percentages as well let me just save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see there is certain spacing at the top and at the left as well let us provide the percentages instead of pixels so that we get more spacing over here so when we reload this page as you can see we are getting the simple text at the top left corner of this particular image so guys in this way you can provide the different CS ACC properties for the image in order to style them based on your requirements because apart from this we also have something called as image filters over
