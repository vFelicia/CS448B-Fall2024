00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to convert the decimal
00:06 - number to Binary octal and hexadecimal
00:09 - numbers now guys the decimal system is
00:11 - the most widely used number system as we
00:14 - have been using this in our daily life
00:15 - now guys however computers only
00:18 - understand binary binary octal and
00:21 - hexadecimal number systems are closely
00:23 - related and we may require to convert
00:25 - the decimal numbers into these systems
00:28 - so the decimal system is base 10 that we
00:30 - have been using that is 10 symbols 0 up
00:33 - to 9 are used to represent a decimal
00:35 - number and similarly binary is base 2
00:38 - that is 0 and 1 octal is base 8 that is
00:41 - 0 up to 7 and hexadecimal is base 16
00:44 - which means 0 to 9 and then a to F so
00:47 - guys we are going to see how we can
00:49 - convert this base 10 to base 2 base 8
00:52 - and base 16 respectively using the
00:55 - built-in functions in the Python program
00:56 - now guys the number with the prefix is
00:59 - 0b is considered as binary 0 o is octal
01:03 - and 0x is considered as hexadecimal so
01:06 - for example as you can see this number
01:08 - that is 60 which is a page 10 number
01:10 - which belongs to the decimal system if
01:12 - we check what is the binary
01:13 - representation of this number it is 0p
01:16 - and then triple times 1 and then double
01:19 - zero similarly the octal representation
01:21 - is 0 o and then 74 and then hexadecimal
01:25 - representation is 0x and then 3C so guys
01:28 - we are going to see how we can convert
01:30 - this number that is 60 into these
01:32 - representations using the Python program
01:34 - so guys let us move to the vs code over
01:37 - here so what we will be doing is the
01:39 - very first thing is we are going to
01:40 - define the number it is equal to 60 over
01:43 - here we are going to take the same
01:45 - example in this case that is the number
01:47 - 60 of the base 10. now guys we can
01:49 - simply have the print statement and then
01:51 - over here we can simply say binary
01:54 - representation so we say binary
01:57 - representation is and then open and
02:00 - close curly braces and then guys
02:02 - followed by Dot and then we have
02:04 - something called as format and then what
02:06 - we can do is simply we can provide the
02:08 - function that is b i n so as you can see
02:11 - b i n is a function that will help us in
02:13 - order to convert the base 10 number to a
02:16 - base 2 number that is a binary number so
02:19 - over here inside this bin function we
02:22 - have to provide the variable that is
02:24 - number over here so guys this is a
02:25 - built-in function that is b i n in order
02:28 - to convert the base 10 number that is
02:30 - the decimal system number to a binary
02:32 - number now guys I'll just remove this F
02:34 - part over here so that we remove the
02:36 - error from the curly braces now guys let
02:38 - me just save this file now enter running
02:40 - this code so guys as we can see binary
02:43 - representation is 0b and then 4 times 1
02:46 - and then 0. so guys I'll just correct
02:48 - this over here it is 4 times 1 and then
02:50 - 2 times 0. now guys similarly what we
02:52 - can do is we can also have the
02:54 - representations of the octal and the
02:56 - hexadecimal numbers so I'll just copy
02:58 - and paste these lines of code over here
02:59 - once again and then we can simply
03:02 - provide octal representation is and then
03:04 - over here we can simply say hexa decimal
03:08 - representation is and then instead of
03:10 - this binary function that is b i n we
03:12 - can simply use the octal function which
03:15 - is OCT so guys this OCT function that is
03:18 - the oct function will help us in order
03:20 - to convert the decimal number to the
03:22 - octal number over here and then
03:24 - similarly we have the hex function over
03:26 - here that is h e x in order to help us
03:29 - to convert the decimal number to the
03:31 - hexadecimal number now guys let me save
03:33 - this file now and try running this code
03:35 - once again so that we get all the
03:36 - representations as you can see we have
03:38 - already got the binary representation of
03:40 - the number 60 then we have after
03:42 - representation which is 0 on then 74
03:45 - that is what we were expecting over here
03:47 - that is 0 or 74 and then we have 0 x 3 c
03:51 - as the hexadecimal representation which
03:53 - is the correct representation over here
03:55 - for the decimal number that is 60. now
03:57 - guys similarly what we can do is we can
03:59 - provide the number 10 as well and see
04:01 - what are the binary octal and
04:03 - hexadecimal representations of this
04:05 - decimal number that is 10 let me just
04:08 - save this file now and try running this
04:10 - code as you can see we are getting the
04:11 - binary representation as 0b 1 0 1 0
04:15 - octal is 0 or 12 and then hexadecimal is
04:19 - 0x and then a so guys this is the way
04:22 - that we can easily convert the decimal
04:24 - system number into these representations
04:27 - that we have seen over here so guys
04:29 - please make sure that you practice on
04:30 - your own so that on different inputs you
04:32 - get different outputs make sure that you
04:34 - like this video so that it reaches to
04:35 - more people and subscribe to this
04:37 - channel so that you get the
04:38 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
04:40 - the next video that we are going to talk
04:42 - about is Python program to find ASCII
04:45 - value of the character so stay tuned

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to convert the decimal number to Binary octal and hexadecimal numbers now guys the decimal system is the most widely used number system as we have been using this in our daily life now guys however computers only understand binary binary octal and hexadecimal number systems are closely related and we may require to convert the decimal numbers into these systems so the decimal system is base 10 that we have been using that is 10 symbols 0 up to 9 are used to represent a decimal number and similarly binary is base 2 that is 0 and 1 octal is base 8 that is 0 up to 7 and hexadecimal is base 16 which means 0 to 9 and then a to F so guys we are going to see how we can convert this base 10 to base 2 base 8 and base 16 respectively using the builtin functions in the Python program now guys the number with the prefix is 0b is considered as binary 0 o is octal and 0x is considered as hexadecimal so for example as you can see this number that is 60 which is a page 10 number which belongs to the decimal system if we check what is the binary representation of this number it is 0p and then triple times 1 and then double zero similarly the octal representation is 0 o and then 74 and then hexadecimal representation is 0x and then 3C so guys we are going to see how we can convert this number that is 60 into these representations using the Python program so guys let us move to the vs code over here so what we will be doing is the very first thing is we are going to define the number it is equal to 60 over here we are going to take the same example in this case that is the number 60 of the base 10. now guys we can simply have the print statement and then over here we can simply say binary representation so we say binary representation is and then open and close curly braces and then guys followed by Dot and then we have something called as format and then what we can do is simply we can provide the function that is b i n so as you can see b i n is a function that will help us in order to convert the base 10 number to a base 2 number that is a binary number so over here inside this bin function we have to provide the variable that is number over here so guys this is a builtin function that is b i n in order to convert the base 10 number that is the decimal system number to a binary number now guys I'll just remove this F part over here so that we remove the error from the curly braces now guys let me just save this file now enter running this code so guys as we can see binary representation is 0b and then 4 times 1 and then 0. so guys I'll just correct this over here it is 4 times 1 and then 2 times 0. now guys similarly what we can do is we can also have the representations of the octal and the hexadecimal numbers so I'll just copy and paste these lines of code over here once again and then we can simply provide octal representation is and then over here we can simply say hexa decimal representation is and then instead of this binary function that is b i n we can simply use the octal function which is OCT so guys this OCT function that is the oct function will help us in order to convert the decimal number to the octal number over here and then similarly we have the hex function over here that is h e x in order to help us to convert the decimal number to the hexadecimal number now guys let me save this file now and try running this code once again so that we get all the representations as you can see we have already got the binary representation of the number 60 then we have after representation which is 0 on then 74 that is what we were expecting over here that is 0 or 74 and then we have 0 x 3 c as the hexadecimal representation which is the correct representation over here for the decimal number that is 60. now guys similarly what we can do is we can provide the number 10 as well and see what are the binary octal and hexadecimal representations of this decimal number that is 10 let me just save this file now and try running this code as you can see we are getting the binary representation as 0b 1 0 1 0 octal is 0 or 12 and then hexadecimal is 0x and then a so guys this is the way that we can easily convert the decimal system number into these representations that we have seen over here so guys please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is Python program to find ASCII value of the character so stay tuned
