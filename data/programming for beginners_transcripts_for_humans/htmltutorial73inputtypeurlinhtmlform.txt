00:00 - so now we will see input type URL in
00:02 - HTML form so guys basically the input
00:05 - tag along with the type URL is used for
00:08 - input fields that should contain a URL
00:11 - address so basically let's say if you
00:13 - have a URL or a link to a particular web
00:16 - page and you want to provide it inside
00:18 - one of the text boxes on one of the
00:21 - websites that will help you in order to
00:23 - have certain validations in place so
00:25 - guys depending on the web browser the
00:27 - URL field can be automatically Val
00:30 - validated when submitted so it depends
00:32 - on the browser that the user uses in
00:34 - order to F the form or provide the URL
00:37 - in one of the input fields that is being
00:39 - developed by you so you should test it
00:41 - thoroughly on different browsers
00:43 - whenever you are going to use the input
00:46 - tag along with the type URL and some of
00:48 - the smartphones also recognize the URL
00:51 - type and adds a doom to the keyboard to
00:54 - match the URL so basically this is one
00:57 - of the important features of the
00:58 - smartphone in today's date that it will
01:01 - help the user in order to provide a doom
01:03 - button on the keyboard while the user is
01:06 - providing the URL in the input field
01:09 - that is provided by the developer so
01:11 - guys let us check this with the help of
01:12 - example in vs code over here so
01:14 - previously we had seen the input field
01:17 - with the type telephone number and the
01:19 - type that is time over here which will
01:21 - allow the user to provide the telephone
01:23 - number and the time respectively now
01:25 - after this we will have another input
01:27 - field followed by colon and this time we
01:30 - will have the type as URL so we simply
01:32 - type URL over here and this is the emit
01:35 - abbreviation which is one of the special
01:37 - features of vs code in this case so guys
01:40 - as you can see we have the input tag
01:42 - along with the type URL and over here
01:44 - for the name attribute we will say URL
01:47 - in this case and for the ID attribute we
01:50 - will say URL once again and before this
01:52 - we will also have the lab over here and
01:55 - for the for attribute we will say URL so
01:57 - that when the user clicks on this
01:59 - particular label this input field is
02:01 - focused so that the user can provide the
02:03 - required link or the URL to the web page
02:06 - so over here we will say provide web
02:09 - page Link in this case followed by colon
02:12 - so we are asking the user to provide the
02:14 - web page link which is also known as URL
02:17 - to a particular web page and after this
02:19 - input tag we will have couple of line
02:21 - breaks over here so let me just save
02:23 - this file now and try reloading this
02:25 - page once again on the browser so as you
02:27 - can see provide web page link label is
02:30 - being displayed over here and when the
02:32 - user clicks on this particular label the
02:34 - input field is getting focused in this
02:36 - case and the user came provide the URL
02:38 - over here so let's say we provide Google
02:40 - as the URL so is this the correct URL no
02:44 - in this case this is not the correct
02:45 - format of the URL still we will test it
02:48 - let me just click on submit button over
02:50 - here as you can see please enter the URL
02:53 - error message is being displayed over
02:55 - here so let me just provide Doom over
02:57 - here in this case so let us check
02:59 - whether now this URL will be submitted
03:01 - or not so when we click on submit so
03:03 - again please enter a URL so the
03:06 - important thing that we are missing over
03:08 - here in this case is the https so
03:10 - whenever we go to the web browser and
03:12 - type one of the URLs so let's say we
03:15 - want to go to Google so simply we can
03:17 - provide google.com over here but
03:19 - automatically the browsers are designed
03:22 - in such a way that they provide the
03:23 - https prefix over here before the domain
03:27 - so that is what is being EXP ected over
03:30 - here in the HTML form as well so before
03:33 - this let us say we provide https
03:36 - followed by colon and then two times
03:38 - forward slashes over here now this is
03:40 - the correct URL that will be accepted by
03:43 - this input field of type URL over here
03:46 - so let me just click on submit button
03:48 - once again so as you can see URL
03:50 - parameter is being displayed over here
03:52 - in the URL and then after that we have
03:55 - the https and the entire URL that we
03:58 - have provided in in this case it is
04:00 - displaying the asky characters over here
04:02 - for the colon and the forward slashes
04:05 - that we had provided so guys in this way
04:07 - you can provide any of the URLs based on
04:09 - your project requirements and ask the
04:11 - user to paste a particular link to the
04:13 - web page if the user is expected to do
04:15 - so but make sure that you test this
04:17 - input field on different browsers
04:19 - because we never know what browser the
04:21 - actual user is using while he or she is
04:24 - submitting the HTML form or using it
04:27 - outside the HTML form as well so comment
04:29 - in in the comment section below whether
