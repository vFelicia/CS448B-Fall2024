With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see form elements in HTML
00:03 - so guys basically there are various form
00:05 - elements in HTML so one of the form
00:07 - elements is input tag which takes the
00:10 - input from the user so guys let us check
00:12 - this with the help of example in the VSS
00:15 - code over here so first of all what we
00:17 - will do is we will Define the paragraph
00:19 - by using the P tag over here and then we
00:22 - will say below content is in form so
00:26 - guys we have a very simple statement
00:28 - that is below content is in form and
00:30 - then on the next line we will Define the
00:32 - form tag over here so we type form and
00:34 - as you can see this is the Mt
00:36 - abbreviation that is form tag over here
00:38 - we are going to select this and the
00:40 - action attribute helps us in order to
00:43 - provide the name of the server side file
00:46 - that will be responsible in order to
00:48 - handle the data when this form is
00:50 - submitted so guys we are going to ignore
00:52 - this particular action attribute for now
00:54 - since it deals with the file that is on
00:56 - the server side now guys what we are
00:58 - going to do is we are going to simply
01:00 - provide the input tag over here so that
01:03 - the user can provide certain input so we
01:05 - will provide the input tag in this case
01:08 - and the type will be text over here so
01:10 - guys basically there are multiple types
01:12 - for the input tag so the type text helps
01:15 - us to have a single line text box that
01:18 - will help the user to provide certain
01:20 - data which we can send to the server now
01:22 - guys we can have a particular name to
01:24 - this text box so let's say we provide
01:26 - the name value as a name over here and
01:29 - then let's say we provide the ID as
01:31 - YouTube channel so guys basically we are
01:34 - going to provide the YouTube channel
01:36 - name in this particular text box and
01:38 - that is why we have given the ID that is
01:40 - YouTube channel we can modify it as
01:43 - YouTube channel name over here so that
01:45 - it becomes more specific and over here
01:47 - as well we will say YT and then name
01:50 - over here so guys basically we have
01:51 - provided the input text box in this case
01:54 - let me just save this file now and try
01:56 - reloading this page once again on the
01:58 - browser so as you can can see below
02:00 - content is in form and we are Simply
02:02 - Having the text box over here that will
02:04 - allow the user to provide certain data
02:07 - inside the text box in this case but
02:09 - guys this Standalone text box doesn't
02:12 - give us much idea about what kind of
02:14 - data is being expected from the user so
02:17 - basically we have another form element
02:19 - that is the label element which will
02:21 - Define the label for this input so guys
02:23 - what we can do is before this input we
02:26 - can have the label tag as well so over
02:28 - here we can provide the lab
02:30 - and then guys we have something called
02:31 - as for attribute which will take the
02:34 - value as the ID of the input that we
02:37 - want this label to link with so guys
02:40 - this label will be related to this text
02:42 - box so we should have the ID of this
02:44 - text box being copied and pasted over
02:47 - here as the value of this for attribute
02:49 - so that when the user clicks on this
02:51 - label this particular input text field
02:54 - gets activated so we need to provide the
02:56 - label that is YouTube channel name over
03:00 - here so guys basically this is the
03:02 - simple text that will be displayed to
03:04 - the user so that he or she comes to know
03:06 - that what input is being expected to be
03:09 - provided inside this text box after this
03:11 - label we will have the line break so
03:13 - that the input is displayed on the next
03:15 - line and over here as well we are going
03:17 - to have the line break in this case let
03:19 - me just save this file now and try
03:20 - reloading this page once again on the
03:22 - browser so as you can see now we have
03:25 - the YouTube channel name and this makes
03:27 - more sense since the user comes to know
03:29 - that inside the text box you are
03:31 - supposed to provide the name of this
03:33 - YouTube channel so guys basically this
03:34 - for attribute helps us in order to click
03:38 - on this label so that we can activate
03:40 - this text box over here so when we click
03:42 - on this YouTube channel name so as you
03:44 - can see the text box is being activated
03:47 - now and then we can simply provide the
03:49 - name of this YouTube channel which you
03:51 - should definitely subscribe if you have
03:53 - not done so so basically we have
03:55 - provided a name that is programming for
03:57 - beginners over here by using the simple
03:59 - label and the input text box now guys
04:01 - let us move to another element we have
04:03 - something called as select which helps
04:05 - us in order to provide the dropdown list
04:08 - so guys over here we can provide the
04:09 - select tag as well so when we provide
04:12 - the select tag we again have the name
04:14 - and the ID over here so let's say we
04:16 - provide the name as social media in this
04:18 - case so we are going to provide the list
04:20 - of social media platforms and the ID we
04:23 - will again keep it as social media so
04:25 - over here we will copy and paste it as
04:28 - the social media over here now guys what
04:30 - we have to do is in between the select
04:32 - starting and the ending tag we need to
04:34 - have the list of values being defined
04:36 - over here so simply we can have the
04:38 - option tag so as you can see option tag
04:41 - will help us in order to have the list
04:44 - of values that we can provide inside the
04:47 - select tag over here so basically the
04:49 - first option let us say we have YouTube
04:52 - as the first option in this case and
04:54 - then let me just copy this and paste it
04:56 - few times so that we can provide the
04:58 - different values for for these options
05:00 - so let's say we have the second option
05:02 - is Facebook and then let's say the third
05:05 - option is Instagram over here and then
05:07 - let's say we have Twitter in this case
05:10 - so basically we have four social media
05:12 - platforms over here that we have defined
05:14 - and then guys we also have to provide
05:16 - the value attribute over here because
05:19 - this is the value that is going to be
05:21 - passed to the server and server will
05:23 - differentiate between all these list of
05:25 - values by using the value inside this
05:28 - value attribute so basically we are
05:30 - going to Simply have YouTube as the
05:32 - value over here and we can also have
05:35 - Facebook in this case as the value of
05:37 - the second option and then over here we
05:40 - have Instagram and for the last option
05:42 - we will simply have Twitter so guys
05:44 - basically these are nothing but the
05:45 - values that we have provided and these
05:48 - values will be used on the server side
05:50 - when the user clicks on the submit
05:52 - button these values will be passed for
05:54 - the list of options and guys the text
05:56 - that we have provided that is YouTube
05:58 - Facebook in Instagram and Twitter over
06:00 - here this will be displayed at the UI
06:03 - site to the user so let me just save
06:05 - this file now and try reloading this
06:07 - page once again on the browser so as you
06:09 - can see we are getting a drop down field
06:12 - over here and we need to click on this
06:13 - drop down field and we will get all the
06:16 - options in this case so by default the
06:18 - first option is selected over here and
06:20 - when we click on this we can select one
06:23 - of the options so let's say we select
06:24 - Instagram over here so when we click on
06:27 - this so Instagram is selected in this
06:29 - case so guys basically whatever value is
06:31 - being selected over here it will be
06:33 - passed to the server for further
06:35 - processing and again we can have the
06:36 - label over here so after this BR line
06:39 - break we will have another line break
06:41 - over here and let's say we provide the
06:43 - label in this case and this label should
06:45 - belong to this select tag over here so
06:48 - I'll just copy the ID of the select tag
06:50 - and paste it over here and then we will
06:52 - say social media platforms over here so
06:57 - guys we have social media platforms and
06:59 - then we will again have the line break
07:01 - so that all the options are being
07:02 - displayed on the next line let me just
07:04 - save this file now and try reloading
07:06 - this page once again on the browser so
07:08 - as you can see we are getting the social
07:10 - media platforms over here now guys by
07:12 - default the first option will be
07:14 - selected that is YouTube so how do we
07:16 - make this second option that is Facebook
07:19 - as selected over here so simply what we
07:21 - can do is we can come to this option
07:23 - that is Facebook and after the value
07:26 - inside the starting tag we can simply
07:28 - provide selected attribute over here so
07:31 - as you can see if present this Boolean
07:34 - attribute indicates that the option is
07:36 - initially selected so we simply provide
07:39 - this selected option over here let me
07:41 - just save this file now and when we
07:43 - reload this page by default you will be
07:45 - seeing the Facebook option that is
07:47 - selected in this case so when we reload
07:50 - this page as you can see Facebook is
07:52 - being selected by default and then you
07:54 - have to click on this option and then
07:56 - you will see all the list of items that
07:58 - are present in the drop down so guys
08:00 - whatever option you want to display by
08:03 - default as selected option you can
08:05 - provide the selected keyword over here
08:07 - in order to show that particular option
08:10 - selected by default so over here we have
08:12 - selected Twitter in this case let me
08:14 - just save this file now and try
08:15 - reloading this page so as you can see
08:17 - Twitter is being selected by default
08:19 - over here guys similarly for the input
08:21 - field we can also have the value
08:24 - attribute over here so when we provide
08:26 - the value attribute we need to provide C
08:29 - string over here so let's say we provide
08:31 - test as the string to the value
08:33 - attribute let me just save this file now
08:35 - so guys basically this test string will
08:37 - be displayed by default when the user
08:40 - reloads this page so when we reload this
08:42 - page as you can see test is the YouTube
08:44 - channel name by default and then user
08:47 - can provide the name of the YouTube
08:48 - channel based on the requirements now
08:50 - guys apart from this we have something
08:52 - called as text area which is the
08:54 - multi-line input field so guys we can
08:57 - have the multiple line input field field
08:59 - as well if you are expecting a long
09:01 - input from the user such as a feedback
09:04 - or the remarks input so guys what we
09:06 - have to do is inside the VSS code over
09:09 - here we have something called as text
09:11 - area so as you can see this is the tag
09:14 - and then we can provide the name such as
09:16 - we can provide remarks over here and
09:18 - then again the ID that we are going to
09:21 - provide is remarks in this case and then
09:23 - guys we have something called as rows
09:25 - and calls over here so this is going to
09:27 - define the number of rows meaning how
09:29 - many number of rows vertically the text
09:32 - area will occupy the space and then
09:34 - horizontally how many columns the text
09:36 - area will be occupying the space so over
09:39 - here by default the rows are 10 and the
09:42 - columns are 30 in this case and then
09:44 - guys before this we can also have the
09:46 - label that is assigned to this text area
09:48 - so simply we will have the label and for
09:51 - the for attribute we are going to
09:53 - provide the ID of this text area so I'll
09:55 - simply copy the remarks ID and paste it
09:58 - over here and then simply we will
10:00 - provide the remarks label over here
10:02 - followed by colon and then we also have
10:05 - the line break over here at the end of
10:07 - the label and guys in between the text
10:09 - area text we can provide the hint to the
10:12 - user we can say provide your remarks so
10:17 - guys let me just save this file now and
10:19 - try reloading this page once again on
10:21 - the browser so as you can see this is
10:23 - the multi-line input field that is
10:25 - expandable over here so guys on the
10:27 - bottom right as you can see when you get
10:29 - the cursor it gets converted to this
10:31 - Arrow cursor over here and we can simply
10:34 - click it and drag it to the appropriate
10:36 - point so that we can increase or
10:38 - decrease the size of this particular
10:40 - text area and this is the hint that is
10:42 - provided to the user we can provide the
10:44 - remarks over here and we can simply say
10:47 - this is programming for beginner YouTube
10:53 - channel which I have subscribed so guys
10:57 - basically this is the multi line input
10:59 - that can be provided by the user with
11:02 - the help of the text area HTML element
11:05 - now guys apart from this we also have
11:07 - the button form element over here which
11:09 - will help us in order to display the
11:11 - clickable button so what we can do is
11:13 - simply inside this form we can have the
11:16 - input tag over here followed by colon
11:19 - and then we have something called as
11:21 - button in this case so guys basically
11:23 - the type will be button so we have
11:25 - already seen the type that is text which
11:27 - is the input field the type button will
11:29 - be a clickable button and the value will
11:32 - be provided over here inside the value
11:34 - attribute which will be displayed on the
11:37 - button itself so for the value attribute
11:39 - we can simply say click me over here
11:41 - followed by exclamation mark So guys let
11:43 - me just save this file now and try
11:45 - reloading this page once again on the
11:47 - browser so as you can see we have this
11:49 - click me button which is being displayed
11:51 - on the right and when we click on this
11:53 - since we have not added any JavaScript
11:56 - code over here nothing will happen but
11:58 - we can simply click on this particular
12:00 - button and based on our requirements
12:02 - carry out the actions that we want to
12:04 - perform now simply we can have the line
12:06 - break after this text area so that the
12:08 - button is displayed on the next line
12:10 - over here so let me just save this file
12:12 - now and try reloading this page so as
12:15 - you can see over here we are getting the
12:17 - button that is being displayed on the UI
12:19 - now guys apart from this we have
12:21 - something called as field set and the
12:23 - legend as well which helps us in order
12:25 - to group the form elements and provide
12:27 - name to the form so guys this entire
12:30 - form that we have seen just now right
12:32 - from the YouTube channel name and then
12:34 - we have social media platforms which is
12:36 - the select element and then we have the
12:38 - remarks which is the text area and then
12:41 - we also have the button this entire form
12:43 - can be enclosed in between the field set
12:46 - which is nothing but grouping of the
12:48 - form elements so what we can do is we
12:51 - can have the field set tag over here so
12:54 - guys what we are going to do is first of
12:55 - all I'm going to set the word rep so
12:58 - that all the content is being displayed
13:00 - on this screen instead of using the
13:02 - horizontal scroll bar now after this
13:04 - form element over here we can simply
13:06 - have the field set in this case so this
13:09 - is the field set tag over here and I'll
13:12 - cut this field set ending tag and paste
13:15 - it after the last input that is the
13:17 - button over here now let me just save
13:19 - this file now and try reloading this
13:21 - page once again on the browser so as you
13:23 - can see we are getting a border in this
13:25 - case and this is defining our form that
13:28 - is all the form elements are present
13:30 - inside this border now guys we can also
13:33 - give the name to this form that will be
13:35 - displayed over here along with the
13:37 - border so what we can do is we can have
13:39 - the legend tag over here so we provide
13:42 - Legend tag and we simply have to provide
13:44 - the name of the form so let's say we
13:47 - provide the name of the form as test
13:48 - form over here so let me just save this
13:50 - file now and try reloading this page on
13:53 - the browser so as you can see along with
13:55 - the Border we are getting the name that
13:57 - is test form over here with the help of
13:59 - the legend tag so guys this is the main
14:01 - functionality of the field set which
14:04 - will help us in order to group the
14:06 - entire content of the form and the
14:08 - legend tag that will give the name to
14:10 - that particular form so guys apart from
14:12 - this we also have something called as
14:14 - data list over here which will help us
14:16 - in order to display the list of the
14:18 - drop- down options so guys what we will
14:20 - do is after this button we are going to
14:23 - have the data list over here so guys
14:25 - basically we are going to have the input
14:27 - tag over here and for this input tag
14:30 - instead of having the type attribute we
14:32 - will be having the list attribute so
14:34 - over here we will say list and we will
14:36 - give some value to this list so let's
14:38 - say we provide the browsers as the value
14:41 - to this list now guys we are supposed to
14:43 - define the list of browsers which will
14:46 - be displayed as the drop- down for this
14:48 - input list over here so what we can do
14:50 - is on the next line we can have the data
14:53 - list as the tag in this case and guys
14:55 - for this data list tag we are going to
14:57 - have the ID which will be equal to the
15:00 - value of this list attribute for this
15:03 - input so I'm going to copy this and
15:05 - paste it as the ID over here and in
15:07 - between this data list starting and the
15:09 - ending tag we are going to have the list
15:12 - of options so let's say the first option
15:14 - over here is Chrome in this case and the
15:17 - value that we are going to provide is
15:19 - Google Chrome over here so we say Google
15:22 - Chrome and then after this we will have
15:24 - more options over here so we will say
15:27 - another browser as Firefox and then
15:30 - let's say we provide Safari as the third
15:33 - option and then let's say we have Edge
15:35 - as the fourth option so let's say over
15:37 - here we say Firefox Guys these values
15:40 - will be displayed on the UI that we
15:42 - provide in between the starting and the
15:44 - ending tag and the values that we
15:46 - provide will be passed to the server so
15:48 - over here we have Safari as the third
15:51 - browser and then we have MS Edge that is
15:55 - Microsoft Edge as the fourth option over
15:58 - here now guys let me just save this file
16:00 - now and try reloading this page once
16:02 - again on the browser so as you can see
16:04 - we have CAU another input field over
16:06 - here and you can see there is a drop-
16:08 - down option in this case so when we
16:10 - click on this drop down option as you
16:12 - can see these are the options that we
16:14 - are getting so guys we are getting the
16:16 - value as well along with it the text
16:18 - that we had given that is Chrome over
16:20 - here for Google Chrome and then we are
16:22 - getting Firefox Safari and Edge so guys
16:25 - this is another way in order to show the
16:27 - list of options by using the data list
16:30 - and binding it with the input tag by
16:33 - using the list attribute which will have
16:36 - the value as the ID of the data list tag
16:39 - so Guys these are certain form elements
16:41 - that you can use based on your
16:42 - requirements comment in the comment

Cleaned transcript:

so now we will see form elements in HTML so guys basically there are various form elements in HTML so one of the form elements is input tag which takes the input from the user so guys let us check this with the help of example in the VSS code over here so first of all what we will do is we will Define the paragraph by using the P tag over here and then we will say below content is in form so guys we have a very simple statement that is below content is in form and then on the next line we will Define the form tag over here so we type form and as you can see this is the Mt abbreviation that is form tag over here we are going to select this and the action attribute helps us in order to provide the name of the server side file that will be responsible in order to handle the data when this form is submitted so guys we are going to ignore this particular action attribute for now since it deals with the file that is on the server side now guys what we are going to do is we are going to simply provide the input tag over here so that the user can provide certain input so we will provide the input tag in this case and the type will be text over here so guys basically there are multiple types for the input tag so the type text helps us to have a single line text box that will help the user to provide certain data which we can send to the server now guys we can have a particular name to this text box so let's say we provide the name value as a name over here and then let's say we provide the ID as YouTube channel so guys basically we are going to provide the YouTube channel name in this particular text box and that is why we have given the ID that is YouTube channel we can modify it as YouTube channel name over here so that it becomes more specific and over here as well we will say YT and then name over here so guys basically we have provided the input text box in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can can see below content is in form and we are Simply Having the text box over here that will allow the user to provide certain data inside the text box in this case but guys this Standalone text box doesn't give us much idea about what kind of data is being expected from the user so basically we have another form element that is the label element which will Define the label for this input so guys what we can do is before this input we can have the label tag as well so over here we can provide the lab and then guys we have something called as for attribute which will take the value as the ID of the input that we want this label to link with so guys this label will be related to this text box so we should have the ID of this text box being copied and pasted over here as the value of this for attribute so that when the user clicks on this label this particular input text field gets activated so we need to provide the label that is YouTube channel name over here so guys basically this is the simple text that will be displayed to the user so that he or she comes to know that what input is being expected to be provided inside this text box after this label we will have the line break so that the input is displayed on the next line and over here as well we are going to have the line break in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see now we have the YouTube channel name and this makes more sense since the user comes to know that inside the text box you are supposed to provide the name of this YouTube channel so guys basically this for attribute helps us in order to click on this label so that we can activate this text box over here so when we click on this YouTube channel name so as you can see the text box is being activated now and then we can simply provide the name of this YouTube channel which you should definitely subscribe if you have not done so so basically we have provided a name that is programming for beginners over here by using the simple label and the input text box now guys let us move to another element we have something called as select which helps us in order to provide the dropdown list so guys over here we can provide the select tag as well so when we provide the select tag we again have the name and the ID over here so let's say we provide the name as social media in this case so we are going to provide the list of social media platforms and the ID we will again keep it as social media so over here we will copy and paste it as the social media over here now guys what we have to do is in between the select starting and the ending tag we need to have the list of values being defined over here so simply we can have the option tag so as you can see option tag will help us in order to have the list of values that we can provide inside the select tag over here so basically the first option let us say we have YouTube as the first option in this case and then let me just copy this and paste it few times so that we can provide the different values for for these options so let's say we have the second option is Facebook and then let's say the third option is Instagram over here and then let's say we have Twitter in this case so basically we have four social media platforms over here that we have defined and then guys we also have to provide the value attribute over here because this is the value that is going to be passed to the server and server will differentiate between all these list of values by using the value inside this value attribute so basically we are going to Simply have YouTube as the value over here and we can also have Facebook in this case as the value of the second option and then over here we have Instagram and for the last option we will simply have Twitter so guys basically these are nothing but the values that we have provided and these values will be used on the server side when the user clicks on the submit button these values will be passed for the list of options and guys the text that we have provided that is YouTube Facebook in Instagram and Twitter over here this will be displayed at the UI site to the user so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we are getting a drop down field over here and we need to click on this drop down field and we will get all the options in this case so by default the first option is selected over here and when we click on this we can select one of the options so let's say we select Instagram over here so when we click on this so Instagram is selected in this case so guys basically whatever value is being selected over here it will be passed to the server for further processing and again we can have the label over here so after this BR line break we will have another line break over here and let's say we provide the label in this case and this label should belong to this select tag over here so I'll just copy the ID of the select tag and paste it over here and then we will say social media platforms over here so guys we have social media platforms and then we will again have the line break so that all the options are being displayed on the next line let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we are getting the social media platforms over here now guys by default the first option will be selected that is YouTube so how do we make this second option that is Facebook as selected over here so simply what we can do is we can come to this option that is Facebook and after the value inside the starting tag we can simply provide selected attribute over here so as you can see if present this Boolean attribute indicates that the option is initially selected so we simply provide this selected option over here let me just save this file now and when we reload this page by default you will be seeing the Facebook option that is selected in this case so when we reload this page as you can see Facebook is being selected by default and then you have to click on this option and then you will see all the list of items that are present in the drop down so guys whatever option you want to display by default as selected option you can provide the selected keyword over here in order to show that particular option selected by default so over here we have selected Twitter in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see Twitter is being selected by default over here guys similarly for the input field we can also have the value attribute over here so when we provide the value attribute we need to provide C string over here so let's say we provide test as the string to the value attribute let me just save this file now so guys basically this test string will be displayed by default when the user reloads this page so when we reload this page as you can see test is the YouTube channel name by default and then user can provide the name of the YouTube channel based on the requirements now guys apart from this we have something called as text area which is the multiline input field so guys we can have the multiple line input field field as well if you are expecting a long input from the user such as a feedback or the remarks input so guys what we have to do is inside the VSS code over here we have something called as text area so as you can see this is the tag and then we can provide the name such as we can provide remarks over here and then again the ID that we are going to provide is remarks in this case and then guys we have something called as rows and calls over here so this is going to define the number of rows meaning how many number of rows vertically the text area will occupy the space and then horizontally how many columns the text area will be occupying the space so over here by default the rows are 10 and the columns are 30 in this case and then guys before this we can also have the label that is assigned to this text area so simply we will have the label and for the for attribute we are going to provide the ID of this text area so I'll simply copy the remarks ID and paste it over here and then simply we will provide the remarks label over here followed by colon and then we also have the line break over here at the end of the label and guys in between the text area text we can provide the hint to the user we can say provide your remarks so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is the multiline input field that is expandable over here so guys on the bottom right as you can see when you get the cursor it gets converted to this Arrow cursor over here and we can simply click it and drag it to the appropriate point so that we can increase or decrease the size of this particular text area and this is the hint that is provided to the user we can provide the remarks over here and we can simply say this is programming for beginner YouTube channel which I have subscribed so guys basically this is the multi line input that can be provided by the user with the help of the text area HTML element now guys apart from this we also have the button form element over here which will help us in order to display the clickable button so what we can do is simply inside this form we can have the input tag over here followed by colon and then we have something called as button in this case so guys basically the type will be button so we have already seen the type that is text which is the input field the type button will be a clickable button and the value will be provided over here inside the value attribute which will be displayed on the button itself so for the value attribute we can simply say click me over here followed by exclamation mark So guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have this click me button which is being displayed on the right and when we click on this since we have not added any JavaScript code over here nothing will happen but we can simply click on this particular button and based on our requirements carry out the actions that we want to perform now simply we can have the line break after this text area so that the button is displayed on the next line over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see over here we are getting the button that is being displayed on the UI now guys apart from this we have something called as field set and the legend as well which helps us in order to group the form elements and provide name to the form so guys this entire form that we have seen just now right from the YouTube channel name and then we have social media platforms which is the select element and then we have the remarks which is the text area and then we also have the button this entire form can be enclosed in between the field set which is nothing but grouping of the form elements so what we can do is we can have the field set tag over here so guys what we are going to do is first of all I'm going to set the word rep so that all the content is being displayed on this screen instead of using the horizontal scroll bar now after this form element over here we can simply have the field set in this case so this is the field set tag over here and I'll cut this field set ending tag and paste it after the last input that is the button over here now let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we are getting a border in this case and this is defining our form that is all the form elements are present inside this border now guys we can also give the name to this form that will be displayed over here along with the border so what we can do is we can have the legend tag over here so we provide Legend tag and we simply have to provide the name of the form so let's say we provide the name of the form as test form over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see along with the Border we are getting the name that is test form over here with the help of the legend tag so guys this is the main functionality of the field set which will help us in order to group the entire content of the form and the legend tag that will give the name to that particular form so guys apart from this we also have something called as data list over here which will help us in order to display the list of the drop down options so guys what we will do is after this button we are going to have the data list over here so guys basically we are going to have the input tag over here and for this input tag instead of having the type attribute we will be having the list attribute so over here we will say list and we will give some value to this list so let's say we provide the browsers as the value to this list now guys we are supposed to define the list of browsers which will be displayed as the drop down for this input list over here so what we can do is on the next line we can have the data list as the tag in this case and guys for this data list tag we are going to have the ID which will be equal to the value of this list attribute for this input so I'm going to copy this and paste it as the ID over here and in between this data list starting and the ending tag we are going to have the list of options so let's say the first option over here is Chrome in this case and the value that we are going to provide is Google Chrome over here so we say Google Chrome and then after this we will have more options over here so we will say another browser as Firefox and then let's say we provide Safari as the third option and then let's say we have Edge as the fourth option so let's say over here we say Firefox Guys these values will be displayed on the UI that we provide in between the starting and the ending tag and the values that we provide will be passed to the server so over here we have Safari as the third browser and then we have MS Edge that is Microsoft Edge as the fourth option over here now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have CAU another input field over here and you can see there is a drop down option in this case so when we click on this drop down option as you can see these are the options that we are getting so guys we are getting the value as well along with it the text that we had given that is Chrome over here for Google Chrome and then we are getting Firefox Safari and Edge so guys this is another way in order to show the list of options by using the data list and binding it with the input tag by using the list attribute which will have the value as the ID of the data list tag so Guys these are certain form elements that you can use based on your requirements comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so
