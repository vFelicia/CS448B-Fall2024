00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:04 - Python program to check if a list is
00:06 - empty so guys there are multiple ways in
00:08 - order to check whether the given list is
00:10 - empty or not so these are the three ways
00:12 - that we are going to use in order to
00:14 - check whether a given list is empty in
00:16 - Python program so the very first thing
00:19 - is using the Boolean operation so let us
00:21 - check this with the help of example now
00:22 - over here so let's say we provide list 1
00:25 - as the variable name and then we have it
00:28 - as an empty string so we are going to
00:30 - check whether this list is empty and if
00:32 - it is true then we are going to print a
00:34 - statement that the given list is empty
00:36 - so over here what we can do is using the
00:39 - Boolean operation how do we use that so
00:41 - we use the if condition and then we have
00:44 - to use the not keyword in such a way
00:46 - that when the expression is false over
00:48 - here then also the control flow should
00:50 - go inside this since the not of false
00:52 - will be true in this case so what we
00:55 - have to do is we simply have to provide
00:57 - list one in this case so guys what
00:59 - exactly is happening over here is the
01:01 - control flow is going to check whether
01:03 - there are certain elements inside this
01:05 - list one and if it is not finding any of
01:07 - the elements inside this list 1 it is
01:10 - going to return false and since we have
01:12 - used the not keyword the false result
01:14 - will be converted to true and the
01:16 - control flow will go inside this but
01:18 - what we have to do is since we know that
01:20 - the Boolean expression is false in this
01:23 - case which means the list 1 is empty in
01:25 - this case so what we have to do is we
01:27 - can simply say this list is empty so
01:31 - guys this is a statement basically we
01:33 - are going to check whether list 1 it
01:35 - returns true or false if it is empty
01:37 - then it returns false in this case and
01:40 - if it is false then we are going to
01:41 - reverse the result that is we are going
01:43 - to make it true and then inside this we
01:45 - are going to say that this list is empty
01:47 - and if it is not empty what will happen
01:50 - is this list 1 will return true and not
01:53 - keyword will make the result as false so
01:55 - the control flow will not go inside this
01:58 - if condition so what will happen is we
02:01 - can provide the else part so that the
02:02 - control flow goes inside this and we can
02:05 - simply say that this list is not empty
02:10 - this time so guys this is a statement
02:12 - that is going to be printed when the
02:13 - list is not empty and this list is empty
02:16 - will be printed in this condition when
02:18 - the list has no elements so guys let me
02:20 - just save this file now and try running
02:22 - this code so as you can see it says this
02:24 - list is empty that's because actually it
02:26 - is empty over here let's say we provide
02:28 - certain elements that is 1 and 2 in this
02:30 - case so when we save this file now and
02:32 - try running this code this time it says
02:34 - this list is not empty that's because
02:37 - this condition that is list 1 has
02:39 - returned true in this case and the not
02:41 - keyword has made it false so what
02:43 - happens is the control flow will not go
02:45 - inside this if condition but it will go
02:47 - inside this else part and this statement
02:50 - that is this list is not empty is
02:52 - getting printed now let us check another
02:54 - approach over here we can also use the
02:56 - alien method in order to find the length
02:59 - of the s and if it returns a zero then
03:02 - the list will be empty and if it returns
03:04 - a non-zero number then the list is not
03:06 - empty so let us check this so over here
03:09 - we will make it as a empty list once
03:11 - again and this time what we have to do
03:13 - is we have to provide Len function and
03:16 - then we say list one this time so
03:18 - basically we are going to find the
03:19 - length of list 1 in this case it is 0
03:22 - which means the Boolean expression will
03:24 - be false for the value 0 and since we
03:27 - have used the not keyword the result
03:29 - will be converted to true and the this
03:32 - list is empty statement should get
03:34 - printed for this particular example when
03:36 - the list is actually empty so let me
03:38 - just save this file now and try running
03:40 - this code once again so as you can see
03:42 - this list is empty is getting printed
03:44 - again we can provide certain elements
03:46 - over here let's say we provide one two
03:48 - three four in which case the list is not
03:50 - empty so let me just save this file now
03:52 - and try running this code so it says
03:54 - this list is not empty why so because
03:56 - the length of the list 1 it returns 4
03:59 - this time which basically represents the
04:01 - Boolean value as true and when we do the
04:04 - not of true it becomes false and the
04:06 - control flow will not go inside this
04:07 - false condition so it will go in the
04:10 - else part and print this particular
04:11 - statement now guys let us check another
04:13 - approach we can simply use the open and
04:16 - close square brackets in order to
04:18 - compare whether the list is empty so
04:20 - over here what we can do is we can
04:22 - remove the not part as well over here
04:24 - and then we can say list one is it equal
04:27 - to open and close square brackets so
04:29 - over here we are using the equality
04:31 - operator and then we are checking
04:33 - whether it is an empty list and if this
04:35 - condition is true this list is empty
04:37 - will get printed or else the list will
04:39 - not be empty so let me just save this
04:41 - file now currently it is not empty so
04:44 - the second statement inside the else
04:45 - part should get printed so let me just
04:47 - run this code once again so it says this
04:50 - list is not empty now in order to print
04:52 - this particular statement that is this
04:54 - list is empty we have to make this list
04:57 - as empty over here so what will happen
04:59 - is this list one is actually equal to
05:02 - this open and close square brackets now
05:05 - and that is why this condition will be
05:07 - true and this statement should be
05:09 - printed on the console so let me just
05:11 - save this file now and try running this
05:12 - code once again so as you can see it
05:14 - says this list is empty is getting
05:16 - printed now so guys in this way we can
05:19 - easily find whether a given list is
05:21 - empty or Not by using these approaches
05:23 - please make sure that you practice on
05:24 - your own so that on different inputs you
05:27 - get different outputs make sure that you
05:28 - like this video so that it reaches to
05:30 - more people and subscribe to this
05:32 - channel so that you get the
05:33 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
05:35 - the next video that we are going to talk
05:37 - about is Python program to copy a file
05:40 - so stay tuned

we simply have to provide list one in this case so guys what exactly is happening over here is the control flow is going to check whether there are certain elements inside this list one and if it is not finding any of the elements inside this list 1 it is going to return false and since we have used the not keyword the false result will be converted to true and the control flow will go inside this but what we have to do is since we know that the Boolean expression is false in this case which means the list 1 is empty in this case so what we have to do is we can simply say this list is

keyword will make the result as false so the control flow will not go inside this if condition so what will happen is we can provide the else part so that the control flow goes inside this and we can simply say that this list is not empty this time so guys this is a statement that is going to be printed when the list is not empty and this list is empty will be printed in this condition when the list has no elements so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see it says this list is empty that's because actually it is empty over here let's say we provide certain elements that is 1 and 2 in this case so when we save this file now and try running this code this time it says this list is not empty that's because this condition that is list 1 has returned

basically represents the Boolean value as true and when we do the not of true it becomes false and the control flow will not go inside this false condition so it will go in the else part and print this particular statement now guys let us check another approach we can simply use the open and close square brackets in order to compare whether the list is empty so over here what we can do is we can remove the not part as well over here and then we can say list one is it equal to open and close square brackets so over here we are using the equality operator and then we are checking whether it is an empty list and if this condition is true this list is empty will get printed or else the list will not be empty so let me just save this file now currently it is not empty so the second statement inside the else part should get printed so let me just run this code once again so it says this list is not empty now in order to print this particular statement that is this list is empty we have to make this list as empty over here so what will happen is this list one is actually equal to this open and close square brackets now and that is why this condition will be true and this statement should be printed on the console so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see it says this list is empty is getting printed now so guys in this
