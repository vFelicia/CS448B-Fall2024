00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to learn
00:03 - about arithmetic operators in Python
00:06 - Programming so guys arithmetic operators
00:08 - are used to perform mathematical
00:10 - operations like addition subtraction
00:12 - multiplication and many other operations
00:15 - which can be done using the integers or
00:17 - the numbers in Python so guys for
00:20 - example let's say we provide the print
00:22 - function over here and inside this
00:24 - function we provide 5 plus 6 as the
00:26 - parameter so what will happen is the
00:28 - plus operator is being used over here in
00:30 - order to add these two numbers that is 5
00:32 - and 6 and the result that is 11 will be
00:35 - printed so let us quickly check this
00:37 - with the help of example over here so
00:39 - what we will do is we will use the print
00:41 - function and inside this parenthesis we
00:43 - will simply provide 5 plus 6 over here
00:46 - and when we just save this file and try
00:48 - running this code now so as you can see
00:50 - 11 is getting printed so guys what we
00:52 - have done over here is we have simply
00:54 - used the plus operator in order to add
00:56 - two numbers we can also do this by using
00:59 - the very variables as well so let's say
01:01 - we provide num1 it is equal to 10 and
01:04 - let's say we provide a num2 it is equal
01:06 - to 20 and then let's say I provide sum
01:09 - it is equal to num 1 plus num 2 over
01:13 - here so guys basically once again we
01:15 - have used this plus operator in order to
01:18 - add two numbers that is num1 and num2
01:20 - for which the values are 10 and 20
01:22 - respectively and the result will be
01:25 - stored in this sum and when we provide
01:27 - this sum inside the print statement we
01:29 - will get that result so let me just save
01:31 - this file and try running this code now
01:33 - so as you can see 30 is getting printed
01:35 - that is the sum of 10 plus 20 over here
01:38 - so guys this is one of the arithmetic
01:40 - operator that is plus is being used in
01:42 - order to add the two numbers apart from
01:44 - this addition we have other operators as
01:47 - well as you can see subtraction we have
01:49 - in which the two numbers can be
01:50 - subtracted so over here 4 minus 2 it is
01:53 - equal to 2 so over here minus operator
01:56 - is being used we have multiplication as
01:58 - well in which multiply operator is used
02:01 - in order to multiply two numbers we have
02:03 - division as well in order to divide the
02:06 - two numbers so as you can see 4 divided
02:08 - by 2 it is equal to 2 so we are getting
02:10 - the quotient over here and we have the
02:12 - modulo operator as well which can be
02:14 - used by using this percent operator so
02:17 - guys what happens is five percent to
02:19 - what this will do is it will divide the
02:21 - number on the left hand side that is 5
02:23 - by the number on right hand side that is
02:25 - 2 so 5 divided by 2 it will give us the
02:28 - quotient as 2 but the remainder will be
02:30 - 1 and we will be getting the remainder
02:32 - of this operation that is 1 over here
02:34 - and similarly we have power operator as
02:37 - well so as we can see 4 and then 2 times
02:39 - multiplication symbol over here which is
02:41 - the power symbol and then 2 which means
02:44 - 4 multiplied by 4 will be done which is
02:46 - equal to 16. so basically this is
02:48 - nothing but the square of the number in
02:50 - this case it is the square of this
02:52 - number that is four so guys let us take
02:54 - all these operators with the help of
02:56 - examples over here so what we will do is
02:58 - first of all we will print and add two
03:01 - numbers so let's say we provide 10 as
03:03 - first number and 20 as the second number
03:05 - so this is the addition of two numbers
03:07 - let's say we want to subtract two
03:09 - numbers over here and the two numbers
03:11 - are let's say 20 and then minus what we
03:13 - do is we will minus 15 over here let's
03:16 - say the third expression is
03:17 - multiplication so I will simply provide
03:20 - 5 as the number multiplied by 7 is
03:22 - another number the next operator is the
03:24 - Divide operator so let's say I provide
03:26 - the print statement over here and we
03:28 - provide 50 as one number divided by 10
03:31 - as another number and then we have
03:34 - another print statement let's say we
03:36 - want to find the remainder after
03:38 - dividing two numbers so let's say 40 is
03:41 - one number and then we provide
03:43 - percentage sign and then we provide 15
03:45 - as the second number and then the last
03:47 - operator that is the power operator I
03:50 - simply provide 5 as the number and then
03:52 - two times multiplication over here which
03:54 - means power and then I provide 2 is the
03:57 - second number so guys let me just save
03:59 - this file enter running this code we
04:01 - will check the results of all these
04:02 - operations over here so as you can see
04:04 - the first print statement that is 10
04:06 - plus 20 it is providing us 30 as the
04:08 - result and this is the correct result
04:10 - over here 20 minus 15 should be 5 and
04:13 - that is what we are getting over here as
04:14 - 5 and then 5 multiplied by 7 it is equal
04:17 - to 35 and we are getting 35 over here
04:20 - then 50 divided by 10 should give us the
04:22 - quotient that is 5 and we are getting
04:24 - 5.0 over here and then 40 percent 15
04:28 - which means 40 is divided by 15 and then
04:31 - what is the remainder is getting
04:32 - returned to this print function and 10
04:35 - is getting returned why 40 divided by 15
04:38 - the quotient will be 2 that is 15
04:40 - multiplied by 2 is 30 but the remaining
04:43 - number will be 10 which will be the
04:45 - remainder and that is what we are
04:46 - getting over here is the 10 as the
04:48 - remainder and then 5 power 2 which means
04:51 - 5 multiplied by 5 is done over here and
04:53 - 5 multiplied by 5 is 25 and that is what
04:56 - we are getting over here so Guys these
04:58 - are certain arithmetic operators that
05:00 - you can use which include addition
05:02 - subtraction multiplication division and
05:05 - then finding the remainder of the two
05:07 - numbers by dividing them and then we can
05:09 - also find the power of the number so
05:11 - guys you can use them based on your
05:12 - requirements so guys that's it in this
05:14 - video please make sure that you practice
05:16 - on your own so that on different inputs
05:18 - you get different output please make
05:19 - sure that you like this video so that it
05:21 - reaches to more people and subscribe to
05:23 - the channel so that you get the
05:24 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
05:26 - the next video that we are going to talk
05:28 - about is assignment operators in Python
05:31 - Programming so stay tuned

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about arithmetic operators in Python Programming so guys arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition subtraction multiplication and many other operations which can be done using the integers or the numbers in Python so guys for example let's say we provide the print function over here and inside this function we provide 5 plus 6 as the parameter so what will happen is the plus operator is being used over here in order to add these two numbers that is 5 and 6 and the result that is 11 will be printed so let us quickly check this with the help of example over here so what we will do is we will use the print function and inside this parenthesis we will simply provide 5 plus 6 over here and when we just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see 11 is getting printed so guys what we have done over here is we have simply used the plus operator in order to add two numbers we can also do this by using the very variables as well so let's say we provide num1 it is equal to 10 and let's say we provide a num2 it is equal to 20 and then let's say I provide sum it is equal to num 1 plus num 2 over here so guys basically once again we have used this plus operator in order to add two numbers that is num1 and num2 for which the values are 10 and 20 respectively and the result will be stored in this sum and when we provide this sum inside the print statement we will get that result so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see 30 is getting printed that is the sum of 10 plus 20 over here so guys this is one of the arithmetic operator that is plus is being used in order to add the two numbers apart from this addition we have other operators as well as you can see subtraction we have in which the two numbers can be subtracted so over here 4 minus 2 it is equal to 2 so over here minus operator is being used we have multiplication as well in which multiply operator is used in order to multiply two numbers we have division as well in order to divide the two numbers so as you can see 4 divided by 2 it is equal to 2 so we are getting the quotient over here and we have the modulo operator as well which can be used by using this percent operator so guys what happens is five percent to what this will do is it will divide the number on the left hand side that is 5 by the number on right hand side that is 2 so 5 divided by 2 it will give us the quotient as 2 but the remainder will be 1 and we will be getting the remainder of this operation that is 1 over here and similarly we have power operator as well so as we can see 4 and then 2 times multiplication symbol over here which is the power symbol and then 2 which means 4 multiplied by 4 will be done which is equal to 16. so basically this is nothing but the square of the number in this case it is the square of this number that is four so guys let us take all these operators with the help of examples over here so what we will do is first of all we will print and add two numbers so let's say we provide 10 as first number and 20 as the second number so this is the addition of two numbers let's say we want to subtract two numbers over here and the two numbers are let's say 20 and then minus what we do is we will minus 15 over here let's say the third expression is multiplication so I will simply provide 5 as the number multiplied by 7 is another number the next operator is the Divide operator so let's say I provide the print statement over here and we provide 50 as one number divided by 10 as another number and then we have another print statement let's say we want to find the remainder after dividing two numbers so let's say 40 is one number and then we provide percentage sign and then we provide 15 as the second number and then the last operator that is the power operator I simply provide 5 as the number and then two times multiplication over here which means power and then I provide 2 is the second number so guys let me just save this file enter running this code we will check the results of all these operations over here so as you can see the first print statement that is 10 plus 20 it is providing us 30 as the result and this is the correct result over here 20 minus 15 should be 5 and that is what we are getting over here as 5 and then 5 multiplied by 7 it is equal to 35 and we are getting 35 over here then 50 divided by 10 should give us the quotient that is 5 and we are getting 5.0 over here and then 40 percent 15 which means 40 is divided by 15 and then what is the remainder is getting returned to this print function and 10 is getting returned why 40 divided by 15 the quotient will be 2 that is 15 multiplied by 2 is 30 but the remaining number will be 10 which will be the remainder and that is what we are getting over here is the 10 as the remainder and then 5 power 2 which means 5 multiplied by 5 is done over here and 5 multiplied by 5 is 25 and that is what we are getting over here so Guys these are certain arithmetic operators that you can use which include addition subtraction multiplication division and then finding the remainder of the two numbers by dividing them and then we can also find the power of the number so guys you can use them based on your requirements so guys that's it in this video please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different output please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to the channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is assignment operators in Python Programming so stay tuned
