00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to learn
00:03 - about closures in Python Programming so
00:06 - guys python closure is a nested function
00:08 - that allows us to access variables of
00:11 - the outer function even after the outer
00:14 - function is closed so guys we will check
00:16 - this with the help of examples as well
00:18 - so what this python closure means is
00:20 - whenever we are having the inner
00:22 - function inside the outer function and
00:24 - when we are using the variable of the
00:27 - outer function inside the inner function
00:29 - still we can access that variable from
00:32 - the inner function itself even after the
00:34 - outer function execution is completed so
00:37 - guys over here we have the function that
00:39 - is the create and over here what we are
00:41 - doing is we are providing the variable
00:43 - that is name and the value is drawn over
00:45 - here and what we are doing is we are
00:47 - returning an anonymous function so in
00:49 - this case we have to return the function
00:51 - which will be assigned to the variable
00:54 - so we are returning Lambda and then we
00:56 - are saying hi and then this name so guys
00:58 - basically what we have to do is us when
01:00 - we are calling this create function we
01:02 - are assigning the value to this message
01:05 - so what will be the return value over
01:07 - here it will be this Anonymous function
01:09 - which will be returned and it will be
01:11 - assigned to this message variable and
01:14 - since it is a function now we have to
01:16 - use the open and close parenthesis while
01:18 - calling this function that is message
01:20 - and we can call it inside the print
01:22 - function as well since it is going to
01:24 - return this string over here so guys let
01:26 - us check this with the help of example
01:28 - now so we are going to have the function
01:30 - that is grid over here which is not
01:32 - going to take any parameter and then
01:34 - inside this we are going to have the
01:36 - name let's say we initialize the name as
01:38 - Peter and then what we are going to do
01:40 - is we are going to return an anonymous
01:43 - function in this case so let's say the
01:45 - anonymous function it is Lambda followed
01:47 - by colon and then we are simply going to
01:50 - provide the string that is height
01:52 - followed by plus and then the name that
01:54 - we have already defined over here for
01:56 - which the value is beta so guys this is
01:58 - the way that we can have the anonymous
02:01 - function now this Anonymous function
02:03 - will be assigned to another variable
02:05 - when the create function is called so
02:08 - over here we will say message it is
02:11 - equal to this grid function so this grid
02:14 - function is being called what the
02:16 - control flow will do is it will see that
02:18 - the name value is parameter and it will
02:20 - say high name and this entire Anonymous
02:22 - function will be assigned to this
02:24 - message now we can simply call this
02:26 - message and print the statement so over
02:28 - here we will have the print statement
02:30 - and we can call this message variable
02:33 - but it is a function now since this grid
02:36 - function is returning the anonymous
02:37 - function we have to provide this open
02:39 - and close parenthesis over here along
02:41 - with the message variable name so guys
02:43 - let me just save this file now and try
02:45 - running this code so as you can see we
02:47 - are getting the message that is hi Peter
02:49 - so guys over here this function is being
02:52 - treated as a closure now why so because
02:55 - as you can see we are printing this
02:57 - message function and the execution of
02:59 - this this function is already over that
03:01 - is the outer function execution is
03:04 - already over but the name parameter is
03:06 - present inside the outer function still
03:09 - we can access it by calling the variable
03:11 - that is outside of the grid function and
03:14 - guys this is what we call it as a python
03:16 - closure wherein we can access the
03:18 - variable of the outer function from the
03:21 - inner function now guys let us take
03:22 - another example so let's say we have a
03:24 - function over here so we say d e f
03:27 - followed by the function name that is
03:28 - calculate which is not going to take any
03:30 - parameter and then over here let's say
03:33 - we provide the value of n it is equal to
03:35 - 1 and then what we will do is we will
03:37 - have another inner function over here so
03:40 - we say def followed by Inner and then
03:43 - this is another function so what this
03:45 - function will do is it will access the
03:47 - variable that is in the outer function
03:49 - that is the variable n and it will add 2
03:53 - to it so basically what we have to do is
03:55 - we have to use the non-local keyword
03:57 - over here in order to access that
03:59 - variable after this we have to increment
04:01 - the value of n by 2 so n plus it is
04:04 - equal to 2 over here and then we will
04:07 - say return n in this case so guys
04:09 - basically what this is doing is it is
04:11 - taking this variable that is n and then
04:14 - it is incrementing the value of n by 2
04:16 - and then it is returning so guys
04:18 - basically it is going to only return the
04:20 - odd number starting from 3 over here
04:22 - since the initial value of n is 1 and
04:25 - what we will do is the outer function
04:27 - that is calculate it is going to Simply
04:30 - return this inner function over here so
04:32 - we say return in r in this case so guys
04:36 - basically whenever we are going to call
04:38 - this calculate it is going to return
04:40 - this function that is enough which will
04:42 - be assigned to another variable outside
04:44 - of this calculate function so let's say
04:46 - we have a variable that is odd it is
04:49 - equal to we call this function that is
04:51 - calculate over here so what this will do
04:53 - is the control flow will see that we
04:55 - have called the calculate function it
04:57 - will come over here and then n will be
04:59 - assigned the value that is 1 and then it
05:01 - is going to return in R so basically
05:03 - this is getting returned that is the
05:06 - inner function is getting returned and
05:07 - it will be assigned to this odd variable
05:09 - so next time we can simply call this odd
05:12 - variable in order to get the value of
05:15 - this n so let us check that what we can
05:17 - do is we can simply provide the print
05:19 - statement and inside this we can call
05:21 - this odd function over here so this odd
05:24 - function is going to call this inner
05:26 - function it is going to see that the
05:27 - non-local and the value is 1 right now
05:30 - so it will do n plus it is equal to 2.
05:33 - so the latest value of n will be 3 and
05:35 - that value will be returned and it will
05:37 - be displayed over here so guys let me
05:39 - just save this file and try running this
05:40 - code now so as you can see 3 is getting
05:42 - displayed similarly if we want to get
05:45 - more values so I am going to Simply copy
05:47 - and paste these lines of code that is we
05:49 - are going to print more odd numbers over
05:51 - here so I'll just save this file now and
05:52 - try running this code as you can see we
05:54 - are getting three and then the next odd
05:56 - number will be 5 and then the next odd
05:58 - number will be 7 so guys basic we have
06:00 - only called the outer function that is
06:03 - calculate once but this is the
06:05 - importance of the Python closure it
06:07 - remembers what the previous value of n
06:09 - was and continuously it increments the
06:12 - value of n by 2 and that is what we are
06:14 - getting over here so guys this is the
06:15 - way that we can Implement python
06:17 - closures please make sure that you
06:19 - practice on your own so that on
06:20 - different inputs you get different
06:21 - output make sure that you like this
06:23 - video so that it reaches to more people
06:25 - and subscribe to this channel so that
06:27 - you get the notifications on upcoming
06:28 - videos as well the next video that we
06:30 - are going to talk about is decorators in
06:32 - Python Programming so stay tuned

Peter so guys over here this function is being treated as a closure now why so because as you can see we are printing this message function and the execution of this this function is already over that is the outer function execution is already over but the name parameter is present inside the outer function still we can access it by calling the variable that is outside of the grid function and guys
