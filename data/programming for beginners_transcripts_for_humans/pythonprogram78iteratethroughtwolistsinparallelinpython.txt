00:00 - welcome to another video in which we are
00:02 - going to write Python program to iterate
00:04 - through two lists in pathlon so guys we
00:07 - can iterate through two lists in pattern
00:09 - in two ways so as you can see the first
00:11 - way is by using the zip function over
00:13 - here which is available from Python 3
00:16 - plus version and the second way is by
00:18 - using the eater tools module that we are
00:21 - going to see which is available from
00:22 - python 2 plus versions over here so let
00:25 - us check both these ways in the vs code
00:27 - so the very first thing that we will be
00:29 - doing is we will be defining two lists
00:31 - over here so let's say first list is
00:33 - list one and then simply we have four
00:36 - numbers over here one two three and then
00:39 - four now guys in the second list we will
00:42 - have certain alphabets over here so we
00:44 - name it as list two and the alphabets
00:47 - are a b c so we are going to keep only
00:49 - three alphabets that is a b and then C
00:53 - over here so as you can see we have four
00:55 - numbers in this case that is four
00:57 - elements in list one and three elements
01:00 - in list 2 we are going to see what is
01:02 - the main difference between the zip
01:04 - function and the ETA tools module when
01:07 - we are going to iterate through two
01:08 - lists in parallel so guys over here what
01:11 - we will be doing is we will use the for
01:13 - Loop and then we will have two variables
01:15 - that is I and J which will be iterating
01:18 - through the elements of the Tuple that
01:20 - will be returned by the zip function
01:23 - over here so i j n and we are going to
01:26 - use zip over here so as you can see it
01:29 - yields tuples until an input is
01:31 - exhausted so inside a zip we are going
01:33 - to provide two lists that is list 1 and
01:36 - list two so as you can see we have
01:38 - provided both the parameters that is
01:39 - list one and less 2 and simply what we
01:42 - will be doing is we will print the I and
01:44 - J values over here so we will say I
01:47 - comma J in this case so let me just save
01:49 - this file now and try running this code
01:52 - so as you can see we have got one a then
01:55 - 2B and 3C using the zip class over here
01:58 - so it is not a method it is a class that
02:00 - is being suggested by the vs code now
02:03 - guys what we will be doing is we will
02:05 - also see how iter tools works so
02:07 - basically we are going to import this
02:09 - module so basically this is the module
02:11 - over here which we are supposed to
02:12 - import so we say import and then we have
02:15 - it tools over here now guys inside the
02:18 - ETA tools we have certain methods that
02:19 - we can use so again we will be using the
02:22 - for Loop and we will go through the inj
02:25 - variables and then we have n and this
02:27 - time we will be using The Ether tools
02:29 - module inside this we have a class that
02:31 - is called as zip longest so as you can
02:34 - see this is the class zip underscore
02:36 - long list which returns a zip longest
02:38 - object whose next method returns a tuple
02:41 - where the ith element comes from the I
02:43 - the terrible argument so basically this
02:45 - will also return as the Tuple and we can
02:47 - iterate through the two variables it is
02:49 - I and J over here inside this also so we
02:53 - are supposed to provide list 1 and list
02:54 - 2 so we are going to provide first
02:56 - parameter is list one and second
02:58 - parameter is list two over here and
03:00 - again we will be printing the I and J
03:03 - values so I'll simply copy this and
03:05 - paste this over here the only difference
03:07 - that we will be making over here is we
03:09 - will be providing The Hyphen in this
03:11 - case between the two values over here of
03:13 - the two list so that we can identify
03:16 - that these values are coming from the
03:18 - ETA tools whereas these values without
03:20 - the hyphen is coming from zip class over
03:23 - here so let me just save this file now
03:24 - and try running this code once again so
03:27 - as you can see I'll just expand this
03:28 - terminal so basically we are getting 1 a
03:31 - 2 B and 3C once again which is coming
03:34 - from the zip class over here and then we
03:37 - are also getting 1A then we have 2B and
03:40 - then we have 3C and also we have got the
03:43 - fourth element and it says None over
03:45 - here on the right so guys the main
03:47 - difference over here is the Ziplocs will
03:49 - help us in order to iterate through the
03:51 - list that is having the less number of
03:54 - elements so over here we have only three
03:56 - elements in the list two and that is why
03:58 - we have got only three combinations over
04:00 - here while we are iterating both the
04:02 - list whereas the ETA tools will help us
04:04 - in order to iterate through the longest
04:06 - list over here which is list one in this
04:09 - case so all the elements of list one
04:11 - will be appearing on the left hand side
04:12 - since we are providing I on the left
04:14 - hand side over here and the J that is
04:17 - representing the list 2 it is only
04:18 - providing us the three elements and then
04:20 - the fourth element is being represented
04:22 - as none over here so guys this is the
04:24 - main difference and these are the two
04:26 - ways using which you can iterate through
04:28 - two list over here in parallel as what
04:31 - will be the output if we provide more
04:33 - two elements over here so let's say we
04:35 - have D and then we have e over here as
04:38 - well so what will be the output if we
04:40 - use just the zip class in this case
04:42 - comment in the comment section below let
04:44 - us see whether your answer is correct or
04:46 - not so please make sure that you
04:47 - practice on your own so that you get the
04:49 - correct answer and you can comment in

welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to iterate through two lists in pathlon so guys we can iterate through two lists in pattern in two ways so as you can see the first way is by using the zip function over here which is available from Python 3 plus version and the second way is by using the eater tools module that we are going to see which is available from

c so we are going to keep only three alphabets that is a b and then C over here so as you can see we have four numbers in this case that is four elements in list one and three elements in list 2 we
