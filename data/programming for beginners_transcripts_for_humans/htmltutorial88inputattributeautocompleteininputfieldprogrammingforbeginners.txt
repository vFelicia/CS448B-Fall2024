With timestamps:

00:00 - so now we will see input attribute
00:02 - autocomplete in input field so guys
00:04 - basically the input autocomplete
00:07 - attribute specifies whether a form or
00:09 - the input field should have autocomplete
00:12 - on or off so when we say autocomplete on
00:15 - when the user starts typing he or she
00:17 - will be provided the list of values that
00:20 - was already typed by him or her
00:22 - previously and when the autoc complete
00:24 - is off there will be no suggestions that
00:27 - will be provided by the HTML form or the
00:30 - input field so basically the
00:32 - autocomplete allows the browser to
00:33 - predict the value and when the user
00:36 - starts to type in a field the browser
00:38 - should display the options to F in the
00:40 - field based on the earlier typed values
00:43 - so guys basically whatever suggestions
00:45 - is being provided by the browser it is
00:47 - the OWN users value that was provided to
00:50 - the browser in the previous sessions and
00:52 - there will be no new values that will be
00:54 - provided by the browser so the
00:56 - autocomplete attribute works with the
00:58 - form and the following input types such
01:01 - as text search URL telephone number
01:04 - email password date Pickers range and
01:07 - color so guys let us check this with the
01:09 - help of examples in vs code over here so
01:12 - previously we had the first name as the
01:14 - input field now what we will do is again
01:16 - we will have the last name as well so we
01:19 - will simply copy these lines of code and
01:21 - paste it after the first name input
01:23 - field and then over here we will say l
01:26 - name in this case which will stand for
01:28 - last name over here so we say last name
01:31 - and then we will again copy the L name
01:34 - value to the name attribute and the ID
01:36 - attribute as well so because basically
01:38 - we will ask the user to provide the
01:40 - first name and the last name as well and
01:42 - we had also provided the drop- down list
01:45 - item with the help of the input tag and
01:47 - the data list tag over here so we will
01:50 - keep those options as it is so let me
01:52 - just save this file now and try
01:53 - reloading this page on the browser so as
01:56 - you can see we have the first name and
01:58 - last name over here apart from this we
02:00 - also have the drop- down list in this
02:01 - case now guys by default the auto
02:03 - complete will be on for this input type
02:06 - that is text over here so if we simply
02:08 - go to the first name input field over
02:11 - here and click on this text box as you
02:13 - can see John and programming these were
02:16 - some of the values that I had provided
02:18 - previously to the text boxes and for the
02:20 - last name as well as you can see we have
02:22 - beginners and do that was provided to
02:25 - the last name input field that we had
02:27 - seen in the previous examples so guys
02:29 - these are the autocomplete suggestions
02:31 - that we can see now guys what if you
02:33 - don't want to see the autocomplete
02:35 - suggestions over here so simply we can
02:37 - come to this last name in this case the
02:39 - input field and then after this we can
02:42 - have the auto complete attribute so as
02:44 - you can see this is the attribute that
02:46 - we are going to use and then this should
02:48 - be off in this case so when we say
02:51 - autocomplete is off then the browser
02:53 - will not provide any suggestions to the
02:55 - user for this particular input field so
02:58 - guys let me just save this file now
02:59 - Ander try reloading this page once again
03:01 - on the browser now if we go and click on
03:03 - this last name over here as you can see
03:06 - there is no suggestions that is being
03:07 - provided in this case and if we click on
03:09 - the first name input field we can still
03:12 - see the suggestions that's because by
03:14 - default the auto complete is on over
03:16 - here so again we can provide the
03:18 - autocomplete attribute and we can
03:20 - provide the value as off in order to
03:22 - turn off the suggestions so let me just
03:24 - save this file now and try reloading
03:26 - this page once again on the browser so
03:28 - now if we go and click on this input
03:30 - field there are no suggestions that is
03:32 - being displayed by the browser so guys
03:34 - this is the way that we can provide the
03:36 - autocomplete or the auto suggestion
03:38 - feature to the user and based on the
03:41 - browser history of the user the
03:43 - suggestions will be provided by the
03:44 - browser to the user so now over here we
03:47 - have kept the auto complete on for the
03:49 - first input field that is f name over
03:52 - here and let me just reload this page
