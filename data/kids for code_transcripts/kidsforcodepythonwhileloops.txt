00:00 - hello everyone welcome to kids for code
00:03 - today we'll be learning about why loops
00:06 - all right so what are loops let's say i
00:09 - wanted to print out hello
00:10 - three times how do we do this
00:13 - the obvious answer is print printhello
00:15 - printhello
00:16 - printhello what if one to do that a
00:19 - hundred times
00:20 - we have to write the same thing over and
00:22 - over and over and over again
00:24 - loops let us execute the same code over
00:26 - and over until the condition is broken
00:28 - or false that way we don't print hello
00:31 - 100 times
00:35 - a while loop is a kind of loop that
00:37 - keeps on going while
00:38 - a condition is true it's kind of like a
00:41 - repeating if statement
00:42 - that starts over again if it's true
00:44 - instead of just running it
00:46 - for example while a bathtub is not full
00:49 - keep filling it with water
00:51 - so if bathtub is not full we add more
00:53 - water if bathtub is still not full we
00:55 - add more water
00:56 - if bathtub is still not full you add
00:58 - even more water and then when bathtub is
00:59 - full we don't add any more water
01:01 - this bathtub is not full is now false
01:08 - let's try the bathtub example so we'll
01:11 - say
01:12 - first how full or bathtub can get
01:15 - we'll say it's when the height of the
01:17 - water is five
01:19 - all right now let's see where our
01:21 - bathtub is right now
01:23 - the bathtub now is at zero there's no
01:26 - water in it
01:27 - all right so while the bathtub now is
01:30 - less than
01:32 - the full bathtub i'm going to add water
01:37 - by adding one to it and plus equals one
01:41 - all right so then we can print out at
01:43 - the end
01:46 - uh how much water we
01:53 - you have see it's five you can see how
01:55 - we got there also
01:59 - let's try this again right as you can
02:02 - see we start out
02:03 - first are zero then we add one so
02:06 - there's
02:06 - one we go to two because one was less
02:10 - than five
02:11 - they got a three because two was less
02:13 - than five you have four
02:15 - and five and try to win the while loop
02:18 - again
02:18 - that's of now is five and full bathtub
02:21 - is also 5.
02:22 - so since 5 is not less than 5 you stop
02:24 - doing the while loop
02:29 - so while the steps step 1 we check the
02:32 - condition
02:33 - just like the if statement if it is true
02:37 - and only if it is true in step two we
02:40 - run our code
02:41 - step three we go back to the condition
02:44 - and check if it's true
02:45 - and step four we repeat this until the
02:48 - condition
02:48 - is false
02:52 - all right let's look at an example we're
02:54 - going to count from one to ten
02:56 - so we're going to say our counter is one
02:58 - while the counter
03:00 - is less than or equal to ten print
03:02 - counter value counter
03:05 - counter plus equals one
03:08 - so you have to go to a valley where the
03:09 - condition will eventually be false
03:11 - otherwise you're going to go into an
03:13 - infinite loop and it just keeps on going
03:14 - over and
03:15 - over and over again it will never stop
03:17 - in this example the loop's condition
03:19 - depends on the counter variable
03:21 - this counter is written here we're
03:24 - increasing counter
03:25 - by one every iteration the counter will
03:28 - eventually be 11
03:29 - this makes this condition false because
03:31 - 11 is not less than or equal to 10
03:34 - and the loop will stop if we didn't have
03:36 - counter plus equals 1
03:38 - the loop would never end and we have an
03:40 - internal loop we do not want this
03:43 - let's look at the counter example so
03:46 - remember the counter starts at one
03:48 - and while the counter is less than or
03:50 - equal to ten
03:52 - let's try running it let's see what
03:55 - happens
03:56 - the first counter value to get is one
03:59 - because
04:00 - we run this counter one is less than or
04:03 - equal to ten
04:04 - we print out the value and add one
04:07 - next value is two because one was less
04:10 - than ten
04:12 - sorry because 2 is less than 10. you
04:14 - rented out two and we added a one
04:17 - now it's three to print out three
04:19 - because three is less than ten
04:21 - four five six seven eight nine until we
04:23 - get all the way up to ten
04:25 - ten is still less than or equal to ten
04:27 - so we print out ten
04:29 - then we add one to the counter to make
04:30 - it eleven
04:32 - but now eleven is not less than or equal
04:35 - to ten
04:35 - so we end the while loop which brings us
04:38 - the end of the program
04:41 - let's make a simple game
04:47 - called the waiting game
04:50 - all right we're going to keep track
04:52 - number of rounds the player has played
04:54 - we'll start it at zero because we
04:55 - haven't played anything yet
04:58 - i'm also going to get input from the
04:59 - user
05:03 - i'm going to ask if they want to play
05:05 - another round and ask them as a yes or
05:07 - no question it's the other answer y or n
05:10 - if the answer yes meaning they want to
05:12 - keep on playing
05:14 - we're going to keep on looping through
05:15 - this
05:17 - i'm going to add a round and tell them
05:20 - how many rounds they played for
05:27 - let's test it out and see how it works
05:33 - you want to play another round we'll say
05:34 - yes
05:36 - i played for one round you want to play
05:38 - for another round
05:40 - of course i do i played for two rounds
05:43 - do you want to play another round sure i
05:46 - do
05:46 - you want to play another round i'm tired
05:49 - of waiting so i'll say no
05:51 - there it ended because this became false
05:55 - my input was not
05:58 - y when my input was y
06:01 - kept on going and running this code over
06:03 - and over and over again
06:05 - that's all while it was
06:09 - let's look at the summary questions one
06:12 - what do we use loops for
06:13 - and why do we use them question two why
06:16 - do we need to make sure to change the
06:18 - condition variable when looping
06:20 - you can answer these on your own for now
06:22 - we'll go over them next class
