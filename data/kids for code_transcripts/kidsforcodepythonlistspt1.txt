00:01 - hey guys welcome back to kids for code
00:04 - today we're going to be learning about
00:05 - lists
00:09 - so what do we know so far we know how to
00:12 - declare variables one at a time
00:15 - and we know that only one piece of data
00:17 - can be stored in that variable
00:20 - however what if we wanted to store
00:22 - related pieces of data
00:23 - into one variable what would what would
00:26 - we store it in
00:27 - a box or a container
00:31 - well we have this thing called lists and
00:34 - what is a list
00:35 - well lists or are ordered sequences that
00:38 - can hold a variety of data types
00:41 - so we use square brackets to hold the
00:43 - data which is kind of like the container
00:46 - and then we use commas to separate each
00:48 - piece of data that is inside the
00:50 - container
00:52 - so items and lists are indexed the same
00:54 - as characters and strings
00:57 - the first item starts with index 0
01:00 - and each index holds a certain piece of
01:03 - data
01:04 - so here we have a visual example of
01:07 - a list so
01:11 - as you can see we have four items in
01:14 - this list
01:15 - and each one is index so
01:19 - the first element which is which
01:21 - contains strawberry
01:22 - is index zero and then the next one is
01:25 - banana
01:26 - which is index 1 and so on
01:33 - so let's look at this example in our
01:36 - code
01:37 - so let's take the same
01:40 - fruits example and we're going to
01:44 - um declare a list variable called fruits
01:48 - and then we're going to set it equal to
01:50 - a list
01:51 - so to declare the list we're going to
01:53 - start with a
01:54 - opening square bracket and then put each
01:57 - of our
01:58 - list items in in this case it's strings
02:01 - which is like the string strawberry and
02:04 - then
02:05 - each list item is separated by
02:08 - commas right here so
02:12 - each item is assigned an index it's just
02:15 - like the characters
02:16 - um in strings that we just learned so
02:22 - look at this in python so um
02:25 - if i declared a variable called fruits
02:28 - and
02:29 - set it to a list
02:32 - so i'm going to start with an opening
02:34 - bracket and then
02:36 - store a list of four strings so
02:39 - string strawberry then a comma
02:43 - next one banana
02:47 - mango and apple
02:54 - that is how you declare a list
02:58 - so now we're going to go into printing
03:00 - lists so to print
03:02 - the list the entire list we can just
03:05 - print the variable just like we normally
03:07 - would
03:08 - so print fruit
03:15 - okay so let's run that
03:20 - and here we get the list printed out
03:25 - with the square brackets and the commas
03:29 - so that's how we print out the list but
03:31 - what if we wanted to print out a
03:32 - specific element of the list
03:34 - like for example banana
03:38 - so how we do this is by accessing
03:41 - elements
03:42 - and it is exactly the same as how we
03:45 - deal with strings
03:46 - so we write the list variable followed
03:49 - by square brackets and the indices we
03:51 - want to include
03:54 - so if we wanted to print out banana
03:58 - for example this is index 0 1
04:02 - 2 3. so banana is index 1 in the fruits
04:05 - list variable so do that we're just
04:08 - going to do it just like we did with
04:10 - strings last time
04:12 - we're going to write the fruits variable
04:14 - and then a square bracket
04:15 - and then the index which is 1. if we run
04:18 - that
04:20 - we get banana and we can do the same
04:24 - thing
04:24 - as if we want like from the first index
04:27 - to
04:28 - the third index um from some middle
04:31 - index to the end or from the start to
04:34 - some um index in the middle
04:37 - for example i could do like
04:43 - uh one two three so that would print out
04:47 - um the first index which is banana
04:50 - all the way up to three but not
04:52 - including three so
04:54 - um one zero one two three so it would
04:57 - just include one and two so it should
04:59 - just print out banana and mango
05:03 - and yep that's what we have and remember
05:05 - that we can also use negative
05:07 - in this index indices um
05:11 - and that would like negative one gives
05:13 - you the very last item in the list so
05:16 - fruits negative one should give me apple
05:20 - yep there we have it
05:24 - so to modify uh your list
05:28 - we're going to access the element you
05:30 - want to change using the square bracket
05:32 - just like we did right before and then
05:35 - we're going to use the assignment
05:36 - operator to change it to
05:38 - something else so
05:42 - let's say i didn't like strawberries
05:45 - anymore and i wanted to change it to
05:46 - pineapple
05:48 - so strawberry is index zero so we're
05:51 - going to
05:52 - access that element first so fruits zero
05:57 - and then assign it to something else so
05:58 - remember to reassign we use the equals
06:01 - assignment operator and we change it to
06:03 - whatever we want
06:05 - so pineapple if we run that
06:10 - let's print that okay so
06:15 - now we don't see strawberry anymore
06:17 - because we replaced it with
06:18 - pineapple
06:23 - some important things about lists is
06:25 - that
06:26 - unlike some other languages you can
06:28 - store different data types in a list and
06:30 - it works exactly the same as
06:33 - all the other lists we just did so for
06:36 - example i can
06:38 - declare a list variable called items and
06:41 - i can have it store strings
06:42 - booleans doubles
06:46 - or float sorry um
06:49 - and that's what we have here and it
06:52 - works
06:53 - just like everything else we've done and
06:56 - then to get the length of the list we
06:58 - use the len
06:59 - function um which is the same as strings
07:02 - so i wanted to get the length
07:07 - of the fruits list variable
07:10 - you can declare a variable called length
07:12 - and use the len
07:14 - um function so when fruits
07:18 - then we can print the length and we
07:21 - should get four
07:25 - now um okay so we can also loop
07:31 - through lists so we can use the for loop
07:35 - which is what we just learned last week
07:37 - um
07:39 - and this is like the easiest way to
07:42 - loop through a list because a list is
07:44 - iterable
07:46 - so let's say i wanted to use a for loop
07:50 - to print out
07:52 - uh every element of a list so
07:56 - write a for loop remember that the list
08:00 - is iterable so we can just
08:02 - declare like fruit or it can be item or
08:06 - anything
08:07 - and then in fruits so this loops through
08:10 - each element of the item which is
08:12 - separated by commas so
08:15 - then we can just print item
08:19 - and run it and we should get each
08:21 - element on a new line
08:25 - um so you actually cannot reassign the
08:29 - list
08:29 - element to something else using this
08:33 - um variable you have here so think of um
08:37 - like fruit here
08:38 - or item here as kind of like a temporary
08:42 - copy
08:42 - of the element that you're on right now
08:46 - so remember that to
08:49 - reassign a list element we have to
08:52 - actually
08:53 - reference the item in the list you can't
08:55 - use a copy because then you would just
08:57 - be changing the copy not the actual
08:59 - element
08:59 - in the list so to reassign the list
09:02 - element remember we have to
09:04 - um get the element
09:07 - and then reassign something else so
09:10 - let's see
09:11 - let's try to reassign it and see
09:15 - um what happens so
09:19 - once i wanted to replace every single
09:21 - element with
09:22 - pineapple so if i tried it like this
09:30 - i'm hoping that each element will
09:35 - the pineapple but let's see what happens
09:39 - nothing changes and it's because item is
09:42 - just a copy
09:42 - so the actual elements of the fruits
09:46 - list is not changed
09:52 - so if we did want to reassign items
09:55 - using a for loop it's a little bit
09:57 - complicated
10:00 - so we're going to use the range function
10:04 - so in range
10:08 - and then the length of the list
10:12 - so this is um
10:15 - going through 0 1 2 3 because the length
10:19 - is 4 and remember that the range
10:22 - of 4 is 0 1 2 and 3.
10:27 - so this way we can just use i as the
10:30 - index
10:31 - so fruits i
10:35 - and we can reassign it
10:42 - so basically this is just going zero and
10:44 - then fruits of zero
10:46 - we assign it to pineapple then one
10:49 - fruit of one we assign that to pineapple
10:54 - so now we see that the actual fruits
10:59 - list was changed
11:04 - an easier way to do this is actually
11:05 - using a while loop
11:08 - so let's first start with trying to
11:11 - print out
11:13 - each element in a list using a while
11:15 - loop
11:17 - so first we're going to set a variable
11:19 - called index to
11:20 - zero and then while
11:24 - index is less than the length
11:27 - of our list
11:30 - so remember that the length is four but
11:32 - our list only goes up to index
11:34 - three um so this is why it's less than
11:38 - not less than or equal to so we're going
11:41 - to go 0
11:42 - 1 2 3 and then envelope
11:46 - so if we wanted to print each element
11:48 - we're going to write a print statement
11:50 - and then fruits
11:54 - index
11:57 - and then remember that you have to
11:59 - change this
12:00 - index variable or else we're going to go
12:02 - into an infinite loop so
12:06 - let's run that and we've printed out
12:10 - each
12:10 - element so first our index is zero
12:14 - it prints the zeroth index of fruit
12:17 - and then we add one so index is now one
12:19 - one is still less than
12:20 - four which is the length of our fruits
12:23 - list
12:24 - we're going to print out the first index
12:26 - of fruits which is banana
12:28 - and we're going to keep doing that until
12:30 - index is 3
12:31 - 3 is still less than 4 print out apple
12:34 - and then when index is 4 4 is not less
12:37 - than 4 so it ends the loop
12:41 - and then to reassign list
12:45 - item list items
12:49 - we can do almost the same thing as what
12:51 - we did with the for loop
12:53 - so fruits
12:56 - that that index of fruits
12:59 - will reassign to
13:03 - pineapple and then
13:07 - we're going to add one to index
13:10 - if we run that we
13:14 - print it you should get pineapple
13:16 - pineapple pineapple pineapple
13:19 - so first we start with zero and then the
13:21 - zeroth index of fruits we're going to
13:23 - assign it to pineapple
13:25 - and then one two three and do the same
13:27 - thing
13:29 - so that's it for today and i'll see you
13:32 - guys next time
