00:01 - hi guys welcome back to our final html
00:05 - lesson
00:06 - so today we're going to be learning
00:08 - about making menus
00:09 - or navigation bars for our website
00:14 - we're going to start off with the basics
00:15 - which is just html
00:18 - and just like in a restaurant
00:21 - uh for a restaurant menu our navigation
00:25 - bar on our website is basically just
00:27 - going to be
00:27 - a list of items more specifically
00:30 - the items are going to be links to other
00:33 - pages that we create
00:35 - so the user can navigate to different
00:37 - pages
00:38 - and so to start off our html
00:42 - we're going to be making an unordered
00:44 - list of
00:45 - links so i'm going to demo
00:49 - we're going to create an unordered list
00:53 - and inside for our list items
00:57 - we're going to be putting links and you
01:00 - guys have done this already so this
01:02 - should be
01:02 - a piece of cake and i'm just going to
01:05 - put
01:05 - three websites that i have already made
01:23 - and the last one
01:34 - okay so i have my three
01:37 - links or list items in my unordered list
01:40 - and if i were to live preview this
01:47 - we can see that we just have a simple
01:50 - unordered list
01:51 - with bullets and some formatting to let
01:55 - us know that these are links
01:57 - now for our navigation bar we don't want
02:00 - bullets and we don't want the formatting
02:03 - so next we're going to use css to get
02:06 - rid of some of these
02:08 - formatting so for the css
02:15 - we're going to start learning how to
02:17 - create a vertical navigation bar
02:20 - and as you can see like we have demoed
02:25 - the list is bulleted and formatted and
02:28 - in order to get rid of these we need to
02:30 - use
02:30 - css so
02:34 - the three properties that we're going to
02:36 - be using
02:37 - are list style type margin
02:40 - and padding and our selector is going to
02:44 - be
02:44 - ul or our unordered list because that is
02:48 - where
02:48 - most of the formatting takes place
02:51 - so inside our style tags we're going to
02:54 - use the selector ul
02:57 - and the list style type property
03:01 - is going to be used to get rid of the
03:04 - bullets
03:07 - in the browser for links there is some
03:10 - default formatting
03:11 - which kind of pulls the list away from
03:14 - the side of the page
03:16 - and closer to the center so for our
03:19 - navigation bar we want it to be
03:21 - exactly on the side of our page so we're
03:24 - going to get rid of that by setting
03:25 - the margin and the padding to zero
03:34 - now we can see that the bullets are gone
03:37 - and the list
03:38 - is exactly on the side of our page which
03:41 - is where we want it
03:45 - so next you can see that for links
03:47 - there's some
03:48 - text decoration which is the underline
03:51 - and you guys have learned the text
03:53 - decoration property
03:55 - in order to get rid of these underlines
03:58 - we're going to be
03:59 - setting the text decoration property to
04:02 - none so
04:06 - our selector for this is going to be
04:09 - list
04:09 - item link because uh we have a list
04:13 - of links and we want to specify that
04:17 - it is the list or the links in our list
04:22 - that we want to format
04:23 - and not the other links on our page
04:27 - so we're going to set text decoration to
04:31 - none
04:34 - and now we can see that the underlines
04:36 - are gone
04:38 - and next we're going to be talking about
04:41 - something called
04:45 - display or block display
04:49 - as you can see if i hover my mouse over
04:52 - the words
04:53 - i'm able to click on the link
04:56 - but if i were to move my mouse outside
04:59 - of the words in this blank space right
05:02 - here
05:02 - i can't click it and navigate to a
05:04 - different page
05:06 - and for our navigation bars
05:09 - we want it to be
05:12 - we want it to be easy to use so that the
05:15 - user can click
05:16 - a large area around the word and still
05:19 - be able to navigate to a different page
05:22 - so for this we're going to use a
05:23 - property called display
05:26 - and we're going to set it to block
05:29 - and in order for you guys to visualize
05:31 - visualize this
05:33 - i'm going to set the background color
05:36 - to let's say this color
05:41 - now if i were to run it you can see that
05:44 - the space
05:45 - outside of the words is also
05:48 - in color and if i were to click outside
05:50 - of the words in this space
05:53 - it actually takes me to the page which
05:55 - means the link is active
05:57 - all along this colored area
06:00 - and if i were to set my screen to the
06:04 - biggest you can see that it extends all
06:06 - the way across the page
06:08 - now for our navigation menus we don't
06:11 - need it to be
06:12 - all the way across the page so
06:15 - we're going to set the width to a width
06:17 - that we would like
06:19 - and i'm just going to set my width to
06:21 - about 100 pixels
06:24 - and you can make yours whatever you
06:26 - would like
06:27 - so if we were to run this you can see
06:29 - that the length has decreased
06:31 - significantly
06:32 - and it's just this area that is
06:35 - clickable
06:38 - so i can click outside of the words and
06:40 - the links
06:41 - still work
06:47 - um so that is about it
06:50 - for making a vertical navigation bar
06:54 - and we also have horizontal navigation
06:57 - bars
06:59 - which is similar to the navigation bar
07:03 - you see
07:03 - up here on the screen
07:06 - where my mouse is
07:10 - so to create a horizontal navigation bar
07:13 - first we're going to be talking about
07:15 - the display property again
07:18 - and keep in mind that using the display
07:21 - property
07:22 - to create a horizontal navigation bar
07:25 - only works
07:26 - if you have not formatted your menu yet
07:31 - and what i mean by that is this is a
07:34 - formatted
07:34 - navigation bar and if i were to use
07:38 - the display property and set the value
07:41 - to inline
07:42 - this will have no effect on what the
07:44 - menu looks like
07:47 - so as you can see
07:52 - if i were to use the selector list item
07:56 - and set the display to inline
08:02 - our menu remains vertical now if i were
08:05 - to get rid
08:06 - of this formatting that i have here
08:14 - we can see that the links have moved
08:17 - side by side
08:19 - and now this is basically a horizontal
08:22 - navigation bar
08:24 - but if you wanted to keep your
08:25 - formatting and keep
08:27 - your um block display
08:31 - you can use a different property which
08:34 - is called
08:35 - float and we're going to set this float
08:37 - property
08:38 - to left which will get our block
08:41 - elements to be
08:42 - next to each other
08:46 - so if i i have replaced my formatting
08:49 - and now i'm just going to replace the
08:53 - display in line line to
08:56 - float and set it to left
09:00 - and now if i were to run it we can see
09:02 - that
09:03 - our links are formatted and
09:06 - uh in a horizontal line next to each
09:09 - other
09:10 - now you can also set float to
09:13 - right and what this will do
09:16 - is just going to move all the links to
09:19 - the right side of your page
09:20 - if you wanted your navigation bar to be
09:23 - on the right side instead of the left
09:26 - so that is it
09:30 - for navigation bars and
09:33 - i hope you guys get a lot of practice
09:35 - doing this it's really fun once you get
09:37 - used to it
09:39 - and since this is our last lesson
09:43 - um we'll be saying goodbye and i hope
09:46 - you guys
09:47 - keep coding and i hope you guys have had
09:51 - a fun time with us
09:52 - learning about html bye
