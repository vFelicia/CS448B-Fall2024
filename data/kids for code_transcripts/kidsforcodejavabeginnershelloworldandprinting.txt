00:00 - hi guys welcome back to kids for code so
00:03 - today we're going to do day two of our
00:05 - java beginners class so it's about hello
00:09 - world and printing and hello world is a
00:11 - program that you guys are going to be
00:13 - writing yourselves today so in order to
00:15 - write this program we're gonna need
00:17 - eclipse which you guys should have
00:18 - downloaded in the last video if you
00:21 - don't have that done yet it's okay go
00:23 - watch that video first and then come
00:25 - back here where you can write hello
00:26 - world so we're gonna go to our desktop
00:32 - to go to our Eclipse and we should have
00:37 - Eclipse saved to our desktop here and
00:39 - where you can double click it if you
00:41 - don't see Eclipse on your desktop you
00:44 - can go to the folder where you
00:46 - downloaded Eclipse and then double click
00:49 - it here if you still can't find it now
00:51 - you can go to search it and type eclipse
00:56 - in your search bar and you should find
00:58 - it here too so now we're gonna go to
01:00 - eclipse and we started this program last
01:05 - time HelloWorld but all we did was write
01:08 - this line and Eclipse provided that for
01:10 - us so notice that this is public class
01:13 - HelloWorld and this HelloWorld is
01:16 - spelled the exact same as the file name
01:19 - and if we have this with the wrong
01:23 - capitalization or spelling our program
01:26 - is not going to work so we have to have
01:28 - this the exact same notice that it has
01:30 - this red underline just like if you were
01:32 - writing on a document and you spell
01:35 - something wrong eclipse will underline
01:37 - it in red and tell you that it's not
01:39 - right now we're right and we can start
01:43 - writing so I'm gonna write a line and
01:47 - you guys are just gonna copy it exactly
01:49 - so I'm going to do public static void vo
01:58 - ID and then main then we're going to do
02:03 - a parenthesis and then string with a
02:07 - capital S to square
02:11 - our brackets and then args a RG s so
02:19 - this is what is called the main method
02:21 - we're not gonna go into exactly what the
02:24 - main method is but just know that all of
02:27 - your code is going to be inside of here
02:29 - and you have to write this line exactly
02:32 - how it is here or else your programs not
02:34 - gonna work so now you're gonna do a
02:37 - curly bracket press ENTER and another
02:39 - one should appear here so you see how
02:43 - there is an opening curly bracket here
02:44 - and then there's a closing one here all
02:47 - of our code has to be inside of these
02:49 - two curly brackets or else it's not
02:51 - inside the main method so if we write
02:54 - our code over here our code is going to
02:58 - be inside of the class as you can see
03:00 - here with this curly bracket but it's
03:03 - not going to be inside of the main
03:04 - method which is where we want to write
03:06 - it so we're not going to write it there
03:08 - we're gonna go inside of these curly
03:09 - brackets here and then we're gonna start
03:11 - writing so now I'm going to write
03:15 - another line and you guys have just have
03:18 - to copy this one exactly the same again
03:20 - so we're gonna do another capital S it's
03:23 - for system dot out dot print L N and
03:33 - then we're gonna have parentheses again
03:35 - we're gonna have quotes which you can
03:39 - find by holding shift and then the
03:41 - apostrophe on your keyboard and then
03:44 - we're going to type hello world just
03:48 - like the title of our program so notice
03:53 - that there's like a little underline
03:56 - here right underlined that's our that's
03:58 - Eclipse telling us that we're wrong and
04:00 - that this won't work if we try to run it
04:03 - so we have to have this semicolon at the
04:06 - end and then everything will be right
04:10 - and the red underline will go away so
04:13 - this is all the code we're going to need
04:15 - for our first program and now we're
04:17 - gonna run it so there are two ways to
04:19 - run our program so the first way is by
04:23 - pressing this green play button
04:25 - and this is run hello world the second
04:28 - way is by right-clicking going to run as
04:32 - here the same green play button and then
04:35 - java application now we're gonna have
04:42 - our hello world pop up in what's called
04:45 - the console window so this console here
04:48 - is just where the results of our program
04:51 - are going to show up and here what we
04:54 - wanted is we wanted to print hello world
04:57 - and then that's what our program did it
04:59 - printed hello world here so
05:01 - congratulations if you have hello world
05:03 - showing up here that means that your
05:05 - first program is successful and now
05:08 - we're going to go back to our slides and
05:10 - we're going to go into a little more in
05:13 - depth with our printing for our future
05:17 - projects so print statements that's what
05:21 - we just did in hello world we printed
05:23 - out hello world to our screen and now we
05:27 - are going to look at how we had these
05:31 - quotes notice that there is one left
05:34 - quote one right Club quote and all of
05:37 - our text is inside of it so if we look
05:40 - over here these print statements will
05:42 - not work this one doesn't have any
05:45 - quotes at all this one only has a left
05:47 - one and this one only has a right one
05:49 - and we're gonna take a look at these
05:51 - inside of Eclipse and I have another
05:54 - file here called printing examples where
05:56 - we can show this off so here we have
05:59 - examples of incorrect printing this is
06:02 - the one without any quotes only left
06:04 - quote and only right quote notice how
06:07 - Eclipse is telling us hey this line is
06:09 - wrong if you try to run it it's not
06:11 - gonna work so it has this red underline
06:14 - here and that means we have to fix it so
06:17 - for now I'm gonna delete this wrong code
06:20 - because we have the correct one and what
06:21 - it should look like up here 1cor on the
06:24 - left one on the right and notice that I
06:29 - have these extra words in a different
06:32 - color
06:32 - that's just what are called comments so
06:36 - comments are just what the programmer
06:38 - can use to
06:39 - remind it's remind him or herself what
06:42 - the code does and it tells other people
06:45 - reading your code exactly what it does
06:47 - so before I had those examples of
06:49 - incorrect printing and over here I have
06:52 - examples of incorrect printing telling
06:53 - you what they do so we're gonna have to
06:56 - have comments for every project that we
06:58 - do in the future but don't worry about
07:00 - exactly when to do comments or what you
07:03 - exactly you should write we're gonna get
07:04 - into that later so let's go back to our
07:07 - slides and we're gonna keep talking
07:11 - about printing and now we're gonna talk
07:14 - about println and just print so over
07:19 - here we have print Ln which is what we
07:21 - were using before but I want to tell you
07:24 - guys that it will print every word
07:27 - that's inside of these parentheses but
07:29 - it's also going to print another extra
07:32 - line after what you have inside of these
07:34 - parentheses so you can think of print Ln
07:37 - Ln as line and it's just another line
07:41 - after what you write another note is
07:44 - that system dot println without any
07:48 - words inside of it will mean that it's
07:50 - just gonna print a blank line with
07:52 - nothing in it just like if you were
07:54 - hitting answer on your keyboard when
07:55 - you're typing in like a document but
07:59 - we're gonna see that system dot out dot
08:02 - print no Ln means that there's not going
08:05 - to be an extra line so no Ln means no
08:08 - extra line so let's take a look at this
08:11 - inside of Eclipse so over here I have
08:16 - the print versus print Ln you can see
08:19 - from my comment and you can see that it
08:22 - says hello world prints with no Ln and
08:26 - then hello again with the Ln so let's
08:30 - see exactly what these two lines do when
08:32 - we try to run our program and remember
08:35 - that's how we run our program we're
08:37 - gonna click this green Run button or we
08:40 - can right click run as java application
08:46 - so first we just printed just exactly
08:50 - what we had in our original hello world
08:52 - but over here we can see that we did not
08:56 - have an Ln over here so there's no extra
08:59 - line over here it's like if you didn't
09:02 - press ENTER in a document it's all
09:05 - connected on the same line here so now
09:08 - when we do hello again it does have the
09:11 - Ln so it's going to have a line after it
09:14 - here and if we print something else it's
09:16 - going to show up on the next line so
09:19 - remember the difference between print
09:21 - and print Ln print no extra line print
09:24 - Ln there is an extra line after so we're
09:29 - going to go back to our slides and we're
09:33 - going to go over one more new thing so
09:37 - we can also combine words inside of a
09:40 - print statement with a plus sign just
09:42 - like if you were doing a plus sign in
09:44 - math it means you're going to put those
09:45 - two things together so in side of a
09:49 - print statement inside of these
09:51 - parentheses it's going to put hello and
09:53 - world together
09:54 - but notice that I have quotes
09:57 - surrounding each word and no quotes
10:00 - around the plus sign so let's take a
10:02 - look at this inside of Eclipse so we're
10:07 - done with these and over here
10:13 - it says combining words inside of a
10:15 - string so we see that here this plus
10:19 - sign
10:20 - there's no quotes around it but for
10:21 - every word that the plus sign is adding
10:24 - we needed quotes around both of them so
10:26 - hello world each with quotes and if I
10:31 - want to put more words like hello world
10:35 - this is my program these extra words
10:42 - are gonna stay in the same quotes so the
10:45 - quotes are just telling the computer
10:47 - that hey this is these are the words
10:49 - that I want to print I don't want to
10:52 - print this plus sign I just wanted to
10:54 - add the words for me so there's no
10:55 - quotes around here so now I'm gonna run
10:58 - this and it's gonna come to our console
11:03 - window and see here it added the hello
11:05 - world the hello and the world this is my
11:08 - program to make hello world this is my
11:10 - program so that's the end of the new
11:15 - stuff we're learning today but now we're
11:18 - gonna have a few questions for summary
11:20 - time these questions I'm not gonna
11:22 - answer today I'm gonna answer them in
11:24 - the next video that we have so for now
11:28 - you can just think about it and then
11:29 - when you watch the next video
11:31 - you can see if you're correct so the
11:34 - question one is how do we write the main
11:36 - method and I want the exact line of code
11:39 - with all the correct spelling and the
11:42 - capitalization all the correct symbols
11:45 - because if you don't do it exactly it's
11:47 - the computer is not gonna work it's not
11:50 - gonna a close it's not gonna let you run
11:51 - it and now question 2 how would you
11:55 - print the words to your console hello
11:58 - how are you
11:59 - so think about the the new print method
12:03 - we did what would it look like what
12:04 - would the exact line of code look like
12:06 - for you to print this to your console
12:09 - and the third question is what is the
12:12 - difference between print and print LM so
12:15 - if you don't remember the answer to any
12:17 - of these questions you should feel free
12:19 - to go back watch it again all of the
12:22 - answers are in the video and thanks for
12:26 - watching I'll see you guys in the next
12:29 - video where we're gonna go over these
12:30 - answers and then learn more about Java
12:32 - bye
