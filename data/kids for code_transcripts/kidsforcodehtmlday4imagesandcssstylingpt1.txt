00:02 - hi guys my name is victoria and today
00:05 - i'll be your html instructor
00:07 - today we're going to learn about images
00:10 - and a little bit about styling with css
00:14 - before we get started we're going to
00:15 - review the summary questions from the
00:17 - last video
00:18 - so number one what is the difference
00:21 - between ol and ul
00:23 - the ol tag is used for ordered lists and
00:26 - the ul tag is used for unordered lists
00:29 - number two what is the tag used for a
00:32 - list item
00:34 - the li tag is used for list items
00:37 - number three write the code for a link
00:40 - to your school's website
00:41 - so here i have the a tag or the opening
00:45 - a tag
00:46 - and for href the href attribute i've put
00:50 - the url to my school's website and
00:53 - lastly
00:53 - i've put the name i want to give the
00:56 - link
00:57 - which is also just the name of my school
01:00 - number four what is something you should
01:02 - keep in mind when creating links to
01:04 - other web pages you created
01:06 - so other web pages or your html pages
01:10 - they have to be in the same folder
01:12 - in order for the links to work
01:16 - great so now we're going to get started
01:18 - on adding images to our
01:20 - web page first we're going to start off
01:24 - with the image tag
01:26 - and the image tag is an empty tag which
01:29 - means it doesn't have a closing tag
01:32 - inside we have the source attribute
01:35 - which is the file name
01:36 - and extension of the picture the file
01:39 - name
01:40 - is here and the extension
01:43 - is a jpeg and
01:47 - next we have the width and the height of
01:49 - the picture in pixels
01:51 - and lastly we have alt or the alternate
01:54 - name for the picture
01:56 - this is a short description of the
01:58 - picture in words
02:02 - so where should the files be located
02:05 - although we're putting pictures on our
02:07 - webpage they're actually still stored
02:09 - separate from the page
02:11 - if the source name is just the name
02:14 - and extension of the image then the
02:17 - image just sits directly next to the web
02:19 - page but in the same folder
02:21 - this is crucial the image has to be in
02:23 - the same folder as your html page
02:27 - but if you decide to put your image in a
02:30 - folder
02:31 - that's also in the same folder as the
02:33 - html page
02:34 - you also have to specify the name of the
02:36 - folder and a slash before you put the
02:39 - name
02:39 - of the image in its extension
02:46 - so before we move on we're going to do a
02:50 - little
02:50 - demonstration so we can get used to
02:53 - putting images on our website so right
02:56 - now
02:57 - my image or my page
03:01 - actually looks like this so
03:05 - here i've written here's a picture i
03:07 - took so we're going to put an image that
03:09 - i took
03:10 - in the space below so we're going to go
03:13 - back to our code
03:15 - and under where i've written this
03:19 - i'm going to start off with the image
03:21 - tag
03:24 - and now we have to give the source name
03:27 - so i'm going to go back to my folder and
03:29 - see i've already downloaded my picture
03:31 - and i've given it a name
03:33 - diamond beach and it's in the same
03:35 - folder
03:37 - as my page which is my html page
03:40 - so we're going to go back and we know
03:43 - that this is a jpg file
03:44 - that's the extension the extension will
03:47 - be dot jpg
03:50 - so we're going to type in the name of
03:53 - the file
03:54 - and then the extension next we're going
03:57 - to give the width and the height
03:59 - so i know that the picture i took is
04:02 - a rectangular picture a vertical
04:04 - rectangle
04:05 - so i'm going to make sure my width is
04:07 - slightly less than my height
04:09 - so the width i'm going to give 200 or
04:13 - yes 200 pixels and the height will be
04:18 - 300 pixels so lastly we're going to give
04:22 - it an alternate name
04:23 - so i'm just going to name it
04:26 - diamond h which is also just the name of
04:29 - my file
04:32 - and then closing bracket
04:36 - so we're going to save this
04:39 - and go back to our page
04:44 - we got the image here so
04:47 - actually you might be wondering what is
04:49 - the purpose of alt
04:51 - since we can see that on the page we
04:53 - don't even see
04:55 - the name that we gave it well if we go
04:58 - back
04:59 - if for some reason um the page can't
05:02 - access the image
05:04 - so um let's just say that
05:07 - instead of beach i just put
05:10 - typo so now with this name this image
05:14 - doesn't exist
05:15 - because i need my image diamond beach
05:18 - so in this case if we go back again
05:25 - we will see that inside of the picture
05:27 - we have the alternate name that we gave
05:29 - it
05:30 - so that's actually the reason that we
05:32 - give it a name
05:34 - so now we're going to go back
05:38 - and images as links believe it or not we
05:42 - can also make
05:43 - images into links for a normal link we
05:45 - would specify what word or words we want
05:48 - to show up on the web page
05:50 - so for this example we have
05:54 - the url for google and then we just
05:56 - called the link
05:58 - google to make an image into a link it's
06:01 - actually
06:02 - very simple we just place the image tag
06:05 - containing our image inside the a tag
06:08 - where the word would usually be so right
06:11 - now on my page
06:14 - um i'll have to go back and fix the typo
06:20 - okay so right now
06:24 - i have a link here kids for code and
06:27 - then the picture
06:28 - so if i wanted to turn my picture into a
06:31 - link
06:31 - we're going to go back to our code and
06:34 - my link
06:34 - is actually right here and i've named it
06:37 - kids4code but if i wanted to make the
06:40 - picture
06:40 - into a link i'm going to actually take
06:42 - this entire line
06:46 - copy it and then
06:49 - instead of kids for code
06:52 - i'm going to put the image tag so now
06:56 - we're going to go back
07:00 - and when we click on our image it takes
07:04 - us to the website
07:05 - isn't that cool okay
07:08 - so let's move on
07:11 - css styling all right we're going to
07:14 - learn how to style our web page using
07:16 - css
07:18 - css can actually be added in three
07:20 - different ways
07:21 - which is the inline internal and
07:23 - external styles
07:25 - for today's lesson we're going to learn
07:27 - the internal style
07:29 - which is done inside the style tags
07:32 - on the head section of our page so
07:35 - right here we have our style tags and
07:38 - i've actually already added some
07:41 - um since you noticed that my page has a
07:44 - little color in the background
07:46 - and the title is in the center of the
07:49 - page so we're going to learn how to do
07:50 - that
07:54 - so the internal style sheet you define
07:56 - your styles in the actual
07:58 - html page so yes this is
08:01 - our html code and we're just going to do
08:03 - the css on the same document
08:08 - and it only applies to that page
08:12 - [Music]
08:14 - um so inside the style tags we're going
08:16 - to have
08:17 - css rules a css rule
08:20 - consists of a css selector and one or
08:24 - more
08:24 - properties and their values which you
08:26 - get to decide
08:30 - and this statement right here that
08:33 - contains the property and the value is
08:35 - called
08:35 - a declaration so here we have the
08:37 - declaration syntax
08:39 - you should have the property a colon
08:43 - then the value and then a semicolon
08:49 - so first we're going to experiment with
08:52 - the color of the text
08:54 - so this property is just called color
08:57 - very simple
08:58 - and the value is going to be a hex color
09:01 - code
09:01 - or just one of the color constants that
09:04 - brackets offers
09:05 - so here we have the hex color code for
09:07 - red
09:08 - but in brackets you could also just type
09:10 - the word red
09:12 - so we're going to go back to our code
09:14 - and i'm going to try
09:16 - to change this heading right here
09:20 - into red so i'm gonna go
09:23 - here and
09:27 - i'm just gonna write red
09:30 - so now if we go back to our page
09:34 - the titles turn red very simple
09:40 - next we're going to do the color behind
09:42 - this text or
09:43 - this is basically just a highlight as
09:45 - you would do
09:46 - in a document so this property is
09:50 - background color again very simple
09:52 - straightforward names
09:54 - and the value again will be a hex color
09:57 - code
09:57 - for one of the color constants that
09:59 - brackets offers
10:01 - so if i were to go back and i wanted to
10:03 - add
10:04 - a color behind my heading
10:07 - i'm going to say background color
10:11 - and then let's say i just want the
10:14 - background to be green
10:18 - type green and then go back
10:24 - we can see that the entire line has been
10:27 - highlighted
10:27 - green very simple
10:32 - next the text size and this uh this
10:36 - property is
10:36 - font size so not text size it's actually
10:39 - font size which may be a little
10:41 - confusing
10:43 - and the value is a number value in
10:45 - pixels
10:46 - there are also other units but we'll do
10:48 - that later on
10:50 - so the font size actually
10:54 - for h1 through h6 the headings they
10:57 - actually all have their default sizes
10:59 - so for h1 actually the default size is
11:02 - 36 pixels and down here
11:06 - h3 the default size is actually 24
11:09 - pixels
11:10 - so if i actually wanted my text to be a
11:12 - little larger than it already
11:14 - is i'm going to write font size
11:18 - and let's just make it 50 pixels
11:25 - save that we're gonna go back
11:28 - so this is the size it is now and since
11:31 - we've made it bigger
11:34 - yep so our title has gotten bigger and
11:38 - that's it very soon
11:43 - um next we have the font weight
11:48 - the properties is called font weight
11:50 - notice that all of these
11:52 - like font size background color the ones
11:55 - that have
11:55 - multiple words in them they all are
11:58 - separated by a hyphen
11:59 - so don't forget that so for font weight
12:03 - we have a number values that we can do
12:07 - it ranges from 100 to 900 100 being the
12:11 - lightest
12:11 - and 900 being the fullest but they're
12:14 - also
12:14 - um they're also words that you can use
12:17 - in brackets
12:19 - so we're going to go back the default
12:22 - for
12:22 - h1 is actually bolder so if i wanted my
12:26 - title to be
12:27 - a little thinner we're going to use
12:34 - font weight and then we're going to say
12:36 - maybe
12:36 - [Music]
12:37 - 200.
12:38 - [Music]
12:41 - let's go back and now we can see the
12:45 - text has gotten significantly lighter
12:48 - it's thinner and that's just what font
12:51 - way it is it controls just how bold you
12:53 - want your text to be
12:58 - okay so lastly we have font choice
13:02 - which is just the font of your text and
13:05 - this property is flat family
13:07 - again separated by a hyphen so for the
13:10 - value
13:11 - we have um generalized fonts which
13:14 - includes
13:14 - cursive fantasy monospace sans-serif and
13:18 - serif
13:19 - and then we have specific fonts like you
13:21 - would see in google docs or microsoft
13:24 - word
13:24 - like arial time sync roman etc
13:28 - um google fonts is a great resource for
13:31 - this
13:32 - so you can access google fonts from your
13:34 - browser just
13:35 - by searching it up
13:40 - and
13:43 - we can see that there are a bunch of
13:45 - fonts here
13:48 - and so many fonts to choose from
13:51 - so i'm just going to demonstrate a
13:52 - little how you can use this
13:55 - we're going to choose one font
13:58 - let's go with
14:04 - let's go with this one so we're going to
14:06 - click on here
14:08 - and to use this font we're going to
14:11 - do you see right here this plus and
14:14 - select this style we're going
14:16 - to click on this
14:19 - and click on
14:22 - embed so it's going to tell you that you
14:25 - have to
14:26 - copy this section of code into the head
14:29 - of your html
14:30 - which we're going to do
14:31 - [Music]
14:35 - so right here under head i'm just going
14:37 - to paste it at the top
14:39 - the link okay and then we're going to go
14:42 - back
14:43 - and see they have they've already
14:45 - written the line of code for us
14:47 - font family and sriracha cursive
14:50 - so we're actually going to just copy
14:52 - this section
14:55 - and where we want our text to be that
14:58 - font which is the heading again
15:00 - we're going to paste it here save it
15:05 - and now we're going to go back to our
15:06 - page and see what happens
15:08 - so yeah we've got this font
15:11 - which we saw on the website it's the
15:13 - same font
15:15 - so yeah google font is a very good
15:17 - resource there are a bunch of fonts you
15:19 - can use
15:20 - just remember that when you use it you
15:22 - have to follow these steps
15:24 - go um so again
15:27 - when you get to this site you're gonna
15:30 - go select this style
15:33 - [Music]
15:39 - um and then click on embed you're going
15:41 - to copy
15:42 - this into your head and then this
15:46 - into your css rule where you want the
15:49 - font to be
15:50 - this
15:53 - so we're font go back
15:57 - so that's it for today's lesson here are

16:06 - following along you should easily be
16:08 - able to answer these questions
