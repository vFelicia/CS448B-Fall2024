00:02 - all right hello everybody
00:03 - welcome to kids for code uh today we're
00:06 - going to go over
00:07 - lists part two all right so
00:10 - combining lists if you want to combine
00:13 - several lists into one
00:14 - you can just add them with the plus sign
00:17 - so here we have two lists
00:18 - top of sandwich which has bread and
00:20 - cheese
00:22 - and bottom of sandwich which has lettuce
00:24 - ham
00:25 - and bread so if we printed out the top
00:28 - of the sandwich
00:29 - plus the bottom of the sandwich we're
00:31 - going to combine them with a plus sign
00:33 - so you get combined into one lift
00:35 - which is bread cheese
00:38 - lettuce ham and bread you take this
00:42 - and add this to one list
00:46 - all right now finding things in this
00:50 - if you want to find where something is
00:52 - in the list you can use index
00:55 - so for example here's my statement from
00:56 - before but fully made now
00:58 - i bread cheese lettuce and bread again
01:03 - so if we print out the index of cheese
01:06 - let's see how much the index cheese is
01:08 - gonna find the index that cheese is at
01:10 - which is
01:11 - zero one so should print out one
01:17 - now this finds the first index so if i
01:20 - had instead said bread
01:22 - it would have told me it was at zero it
01:24 - would not have talked about this one
01:26 - because that bread is not the first
01:28 - bread
01:30 - if you only want to know whether
01:31 - something is in a list you can use
01:33 - in my sandwich again but the in keyword
01:37 - uh turns into a boolean which is either
01:39 - true or false
01:41 - so each of these is either true or false
01:44 - so to start print olives and sandwich
01:48 - so are there olives in my sandwich red
01:51 - cheese lettuce ham bread none of those
01:52 - are always
01:53 - so this is false my next one ham and
01:57 - sandwich
01:58 - red cheese lettuce ham ah ham ham is ham
02:01 - obviously so him is in my sandwich
02:03 - so this one is false and this one is
02:05 - true so we get
02:07 - false true
02:11 - all right finding big and small things
02:15 - if you want to find the biggest thing in
02:16 - a list you can use
02:18 - max okay here prices equals 50
02:22 - 20 15 70 50. print max of prices
02:27 - what's the biggest price 70 right it's
02:30 - bigger than 50
02:31 - 20 15 and 50. so we're going to print
02:34 - out 70 because it's the biggest
02:36 - it's important to notice here that it
02:38 - prints out the thing that's biggest
02:40 - not where the biggest thing is for
02:43 - example it could have printed out
02:44 - instead zero one two
02:46 - three to say the third index so it
02:48 - doesn't say that it says what the
02:49 - biggest thing is
02:52 - if you want to find the smallest thing
02:54 - you can use min this works a lot like
02:56 - math
02:56 - in reverse in this case the smallest is
02:59 - 15.
03:00 - so it prints out 15. again you have to
03:03 - notice that it doesn't print out two
03:05 - because if you said index two it prints
03:07 - out fifteen because fifteen is a fig
03:09 - that's smallest
03:13 - all right changing the length of lists
03:16 - if you wanna add something to the end of
03:18 - the lift
03:18 - you can use a pen so here's most of my
03:21 - sandwich it has bread
03:22 - peanut butter and jelly we're going to
03:25 - add bread by appending it
03:26 - to the end so when i print out most of
03:29 - sandwich
03:31 - you get bread peanut butter jelly and
03:33 - bread
03:37 - if you want to delete something from a
03:39 - list you can use remove
03:41 - so here's a sandwich some extra stuff
03:43 - you have bread
03:44 - cheese watermelon and bread i personally
03:47 - don't like watermelon very much and i
03:49 - think most people don't like it in their
03:50 - sandwiches
03:51 - so we're going to take out watermelon
03:53 - and print extra sandwich
03:55 - you might guess i'm just going to take
03:57 - out the watermelon
03:59 - we have bread cheese and bread
04:02 - so here like before it's important to
04:04 - realize we'd say the thing we want to
04:06 - remove
04:07 - not where it is instead of saying
04:10 - watermelon's at 0
04:11 - 1 2 and saying index two we see
04:14 - watermelon
04:15 - because that's the thing we want to get
04:16 - rid of
04:19 - all right thank you guys for paying
04:21 - attention bye
