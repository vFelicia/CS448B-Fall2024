00:00 - hi guys welcome to day two of kids for
00:04 - code my name is Zoey and I'm going to be
00:06 - your teacher for today so today we're
00:09 - going to be going through a brackets
00:11 - tutorial and we're going to learn about
00:12 - some basic page structure for your first
00:15 - HTML web page so before we get started
00:19 - we're going to go over the answers of
00:21 - the summary questions that Connie left
00:23 - you off with so the first question what
00:25 - are coding languages if you said
00:27 - something along the lines of a set of
00:29 - instructions the computer uses to follow
00:31 - certain commands that you give it then
00:32 - you are correct the coding languages are
00:35 - what we use to communicate with the
00:37 - computer so that they can perform it
00:40 - executes the different commands that we
00:41 - give them number two what are HTML and
00:44 - CSS HTML and CSS are two common
00:48 - programming languages that we use when
00:49 - building and designing a web site this
00:51 - leads us to number three what is HTML
00:53 - used for and what is CSS used for hTML
00:57 - is used as the basic building blocks of
00:59 - the website and CSS is used as style of
01:02 - the website and make it look nice so
01:04 - think back to the example of the house
01:06 - HTML are the building blocks that we use
01:08 - to build the house and CSS is what we
01:11 - use to make sure that the house looks
01:12 - nice we cannot color to it change the
01:15 - way it looks and everything can be
01:16 - styled using CSS and finally number four
01:19 - what do tags do tags are the directions
01:23 - for the computer to follow in order to
01:24 - execute the different commands you give
01:26 - it there are many different tags that we
01:28 - use and we're going to learn about some
01:30 - of them now
01:32 - first we are going to go over brackets
01:34 - brackets is another text editor tool
01:37 - that you can use and although notepad
01:39 - and TextEdit will work fine brackets
01:41 - makes coding a lot easier and a lot more
01:42 - fun plus it's completely free for
01:44 - download so we are going to go through a
01:47 - quick little tutorial on how to download
01:49 - brackets so first I'm going to go to
01:54 - google and type brackets and then I'm
02:00 - going to click on the first option that
02:01 - pops up
02:05 - next I'm going to click on download'
02:08 - brackets
02:10 - you can see a downloading right here in
02:13 - the bottom left
02:18 - so once it's done downloading I'm going
02:20 - to right click and click show in folder
02:26 - and here we can see brackets in our
02:29 - folder so if we right-click this and
02:32 - click open with brackets
02:41 - and an error might pop up but it's okay
02:43 - just press okay and good job you've
02:47 - downloaded brackets so this is just a
02:49 - short project I was working on before
02:51 - but once you download it you might get
02:53 - something that looks like this and this
02:55 - is just a short little thing that
02:57 - everyone gets when they first download
02:59 - brackets it just explains to you what
03:01 - brackets is used for and the different
03:03 - things you can do in brackets so here is
03:06 - my project right now once you create a
03:09 - project or a file in brackets you're
03:11 - going to want to save it so mine I'm
03:13 - going for mine I'm going to press file
03:16 - save as
03:19 - you
03:23 - and then you're going to want to give it
03:27 - a name so mine is going to be called
03:29 - example and this is important when
03:31 - you're naming it make sure that you put
03:33 - dot html' at the end so that it
03:37 - recognizes it as an HTML file and
03:39 - another thing you can do is you can save
03:41 - it in a folder so I'm saving in a folder
03:43 - called HTML press save and since it
03:48 - already exists and I'm going to replace
03:50 - it press yes and there you go I have
03:54 - just saved my file another cool thing
03:56 - you can do in brackets is if you click
03:59 - on the top right this little lightning
04:01 - bolt this is called the live preview so
04:04 - if you click on it
04:11 - then you can live preview your website
04:13 - in the browser so this website is the
04:16 - result of this code that I typed in
04:23 - you
04:26 - so now we are going to go through some
04:29 - basic page structure first we have
04:32 - document type
04:33 - now document type is this first tag
04:37 - right here document type is what we call
04:39 - an empty tag which means there is no
04:41 - closing tag and what I mean by that is
04:44 - here for example this is an opening tag
04:46 - and this is a closing tag it surrounds
04:49 - the content however for document type
04:52 - there's only one of it and it's at the
04:54 - very top you don't see another document
04:56 - type closing tag at the bottom you only
04:58 - need one of it the document type tag
05:01 - tells the browser what type of document
05:03 - the web pages so in this example this is
05:05 - an HTML page next we have our HTML tags
05:10 - every HTML document begins and ends with
05:13 - this HTML tag after the document type
05:15 - this is the opening tag and this is the
05:19 - closing tag it surrounds the entire
05:21 - content on the page next after HTML tag
05:26 - we have our head tags the head tags
05:28 - contains the title of the document along
05:31 - with other information about the file so
05:33 - here we have the title and we have two
05:36 - style tags and it's all inside this
05:39 - opening head tag and this closing head
05:42 - tag next we have our title tags so the
05:47 - title tags look like this your title is
05:50 - in between the two tags make sure you
05:53 - have an opening title tag and a closing
05:55 - title tag in this case the title of our
05:58 - webpage is called the title in the
06:01 - example of my webpage my title is right
06:04 - here notice it is within the head and my
06:11 - title of my website is called Zoe's
06:13 - website so once you go to my live
06:15 - preview of my website you can see it
06:17 - right here
06:18 - Zoe's website
06:22 - you
06:25 - next we have our body tags the body tags
06:28 - have the main content of your page net
06:31 - so all of your text your images your
06:33 - links all of it go inside your body tags
06:36 - so in my example my body tags are right
06:40 - here inside my body tags I have this
06:45 - header that says all about Zoe a few
06:47 - sentences explaining who I am and then I
06:51 - have a list right here they are all
06:53 - inside my body tags
06:58 - you
07:00 - next we have our two style tags so this
07:04 - is where you style at different elements
07:05 - of your page here you can change the
07:08 - color the size of your font what your
07:10 - font is and in my example my style tags
07:15 - are right here they write after my title
07:17 - and here I can control the background
07:20 - color I made it this color and I can
07:23 - control the heading I aligned it in the
07:25 - center and I control the color I can
07:28 - control the paragraphs what color I made
07:30 - it so as you can see you can control a
07:33 - lot of things in the style tag now we're
07:39 - going to go through some other simple
07:41 - tags that you can incorporate into your
07:42 - page first is the P tag P defines a
07:47 - paragraph in this example we have the
07:49 - sentence this is some text in a
07:51 - paragraph and it's surrounded by this P
07:54 - tag and this P tag so this is what it
07:57 - will look like in the browser make sure
07:59 - you have an opening and a closing tag to
08:01 - make sure it displays correctly next we
08:05 - have our h1 through h6 tags these are
08:08 - our headings h1 is the most important
08:11 - heading and h6 is the least important so
08:14 - if you have a very big notice or
08:16 - announcement that you would like to put
08:17 - make sure you surround it with an h1 tag
08:20 - as you can see the h1 tag makes this
08:23 - text the biggest and this is the
08:26 - smallest and as you go down the line you
08:29 - can see your text is getting smaller and
08:31 - smaller
08:34 - next we have our break break inserts a
08:38 - single line break so here we have a
08:40 - sentenced sentence this text contains a
08:43 - line break however after contains you
08:47 - have a br tag so what this looks like in
08:49 - the browser is that a line break is on a
08:53 - new line because of this tag next we
08:58 - have our HR tag this creates a
09:00 - horizontal rule which is just a line and
09:02 - it separates different content on your
09:06 - page so here we have HTML hTML is a
09:11 - language for describing webpages and
09:12 - then we have the HR rule and as you can
09:16 - see this creates the line right here
09:19 - because of the HR now HR and the BR tags
09:23 - are both tags that don't need closing
09:26 - tags so all you need is just to type
09:29 - this in and you don't need to surround
09:30 - anything with it it is an empty tag next
09:35 - we have our B tag B is short for bold
09:38 - and what it does is it makes your text
09:41 - look bold so here we have to be tags
09:43 - surrounding the word red and surrounding
09:46 - the word blue notice that there is an
09:48 - opening and a closing tag here an
09:51 - opening and a closing tag here so what
09:54 - that does is it makes the word red blue
09:56 - and it makes the word it makes the word
09:59 - red bold sorry and it makes the word
10:01 - blue bold it was a red house with a blue
10:04 - door so you can use the B tags to
10:07 - emphasize certain words in your sentence
10:10 - all right that is going to be the end
10:13 - and now we're going to have some new
10:15 - summary questions so all of the answers
10:17 - to these summary questions can be found
10:19 - throughout the video so if you follow
10:21 - along then you will be answered then you
10:22 - will be able to answer all of these
10:24 - questions first what is the title you
10:26 - must have at the very top of your code
10:28 - what does an empty tag mean what is the
10:31 - difference between an h1 and an age 6
10:33 - tag and 4 what is the tag that you would
10:35 - use to create a line break thank you
10:38 - guys so much for watching we really
10:40 - appreciate it and if you would like some
10:42 - more information you can go to our
10:44 - website Kids 4 code thank you
