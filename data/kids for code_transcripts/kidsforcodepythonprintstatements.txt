00:01 - hi guys my name is emily and
00:03 - i'm going to be your python instructor
00:05 - for today
00:07 - so in the last video jason left you guys
00:10 - off
00:10 - with downloading python and pycharm to
00:13 - your own computers
00:15 - so if you haven't done that already make
00:16 - sure you go watch that video first
00:20 - so today we're going to be learning
00:21 - about print statements and how we print
00:23 - out messages
00:24 - to the screen
00:28 - so to print the screen there is only one
00:30 - command
00:31 - which is print followed by a pair of
00:33 - parentheses
00:35 - so inside the parentheses is where you
00:37 - write what you want to print to the
00:39 - console
00:40 - and i'll get to what the console means
00:42 - in just a bit
00:44 - you must put your statement in quotes
00:46 - inside the parentheses
00:48 - and you can use either double quotes or
00:50 - single quotes
00:51 - if you have no apostrophes in your
00:53 - message
00:55 - you'll use single quotes so for example
00:57 - if i wanted to
00:58 - print the word hi there are no
01:00 - apostrophes in that word so i'm going to
01:02 - surround it with single quotes
01:04 - however if you have a statement with
01:06 - apostrophes
01:08 - for example it's there's an apostrophe
01:12 - right here we're going to surround our
01:14 - message
01:15 - with double quotes um however you cannot
01:19 - use both a single and a double quote
01:21 - so for example uh we cannot do double
01:24 - quotes
01:25 - high single quote you have to use either
01:27 - double quotes or single quotes
01:31 - so let's see what the print command
01:33 - looks like so
01:34 - let's say i wanted to print the phrase
01:37 - hello world
01:38 - shown right here so i'm going to hop
01:40 - over to the pycharm ide
01:47 - so
01:52 - i'm going to quickly go over how we uh
01:55 - make a new python file so we're going to
01:57 - find
01:57 - our project that we made and we're going
01:59 - to right click it
02:01 - and click new python file and then you
02:04 - can name it whatever you want
02:05 - so i'm going to name this printing
02:08 - now we have a new python file so we
02:11 - wanted to print hello world
02:13 - hello world does not have any
02:14 - apostrophes in it so we're going to use
02:16 - single quotes
02:17 - so first i'm going to start with writing
02:19 - the print command
02:20 - so print parentheses and notice how
02:23 - pycharm
02:24 - automatically completes this ending
02:27 - parenthesis it makes our lives a lot
02:29 - easier
02:30 - so we're going to use single quotes and
02:32 - then in between the two quotes we're
02:33 - going to
02:34 - write our message so hello world
02:40 - and let's run that and see what happens
02:44 - you can click the green
02:47 - run button up here or you can right
02:49 - click and there should be an
02:51 - option to run
02:54 - so what pops up on the bottom here is
02:56 - our console which is
02:58 - the place where all our messages are
03:00 - displayed
03:01 - so if we look inside the console we can
03:03 - see that hello world was printed out
03:08 - let's say i wanted to um print out the
03:11 - phrase hi
03:12 - on emily um so we're going to
03:15 - write another print command and
03:19 - let's think so hi i'm emily has an
03:22 - apostrophe right here in the word i'm
03:24 - so we're going to surround the entire
03:26 - message with double quotes
03:29 - so hi i'm emily
03:34 - i'm gonna print that and see what
03:35 - happens and
03:37 - hi i'm emily shows up right here so
03:40 - notice how
03:41 - after hello world it jumped to a new
03:43 - line to print hi i'm emily and that's
03:46 - because we used a new print statement
03:48 - so every time we write another print
03:51 - statement
03:51 - it automatically jumps to the next slide
03:54 - another thing to note here is
03:56 - um notice how there is this uh blank
04:00 - line right here of just white space
04:03 - in our code but then when we run it
04:05 - there is
04:06 - no white space in between that's because
04:09 - our code does not care about white space
04:11 - so i could put like 100 lines of white
04:15 - line of white uh white space
04:18 - in between these two print statements
04:21 - and
04:23 - the same exact thing would print out so
04:25 - if i ran it
04:26 - the same thing prints out
04:29 - so let's say i wanted to print out this
04:32 - phrase right here
04:34 - which is double quote what's up double
04:36 - quote with the quotes
04:38 - um so let's write another print command
04:43 - let's try using single quotes and see
04:45 - what happens
04:46 - so single quote and then our message
04:48 - which is double quote
04:49 - what's up
04:54 - double quote and then i'm gonna surround
04:56 - it with single quotes so
04:58 - our message is right here and it's
05:00 - surrounded by single quotes
05:02 - then a red underline pops up which means
05:04 - that there is an
05:05 - error in our code um let's see why
05:09 - so we used a single quote but then there
05:11 - was an apotrophy
05:12 - in our statement so python thinks that
05:16 - this apostrophe is our ending quote so
05:19 - everything after it over here is not
05:22 - inside the quotes
05:24 - so let's try using double quotes to
05:27 - surround our message
05:29 - so look at this so our message
05:32 - is here and it's surrounded by
05:36 - two double quotes but there's still an
05:38 - error so let's see
05:39 - why um we use the double quote but then
05:43 - we have another double quote here
05:45 - so python thinks that this that
05:48 - this quote is our starting quote and
05:50 - this is our ending quote
05:52 - so everything here
05:56 - everything after here is not inside the
05:59 - quotes
06:00 - so what can we do if we can't use single
06:02 - quotes or double quotes
06:04 - well there's a special key we can use so
06:06 - first we're going to
06:07 - surround our message with single quotes
06:12 - so message is right inside of here and
06:14 - it's surrounded by
06:15 - single quotes and right before the
06:17 - apostrophe in our message we're going to
06:20 - use a backslash which is right
06:23 - above the enter or return key so it
06:26 - looks like
06:26 - that and our red line goes away let's
06:30 - try printing it and see what happens
06:32 - and it prints out exactly the way i
06:34 - wanted it to
06:39 - so next we're going to go into
06:41 - commenting
06:42 - so not everything in your code has to be
06:45 - actual code
06:46 - you can also have comments which are
06:48 - english statements that are not
06:49 - recognized as code and do not run
06:53 - so to comment we're going to type a
06:55 - number sign
06:56 - followed by a space and then our message
06:59 - or
07:00 - comment um so let's see what this looks
07:02 - like in pycharm
07:04 - sorry um
07:08 - let's say i wanted to print i wanted to
07:11 - comment these
07:12 - three lines of code and um
07:16 - so i'm going to uh write a number sign
07:19 - followed by a space
07:20 - and i'm going to write these are
07:24 - some print statements and
07:27 - let's run that and see what happens
07:30 - the same thing prints out as if i did
07:33 - not have this comment here
07:34 - this comment is not code
07:38 - so why do we use comments well this is
07:40 - helpful to document your code especially
07:43 - when it becomes
07:44 - more complex and confusing and
07:46 - explaining it in comments is necessary
07:48 - so that
07:49 - you know you're doing later on when you
07:51 - look back at your projects
07:53 - and that other people who are reading
07:54 - your code know that know what you are
07:56 - doing
07:59 - so that takes us to our printing and
08:02 - commenting exercises
08:04 - so you're going to use the print command
08:07 - that we
08:07 - learned today and you're going to print
08:10 - at least seven statements about yourself
08:13 - um just like i have here
08:16 - and then after you finish that you're
08:18 - going to put a comment
08:19 - on the first line so at the very
08:22 - beginning of your code and you're going
08:23 - to tell us
08:24 - what your code does using a comment
08:28 - so that's it for today and i'll see you
08:31 - guys next time
