00:00 - hello world welcome to cs50
00:03 - problem set one hello walkthrough now
00:06 - it's a very simple problem set
00:08 - and the main reason i'm making this
00:09 - video is actually so that i can guide
00:12 - you guys through the process of actually
00:13 - using the ide correctly because i know
00:15 - it may be complicated for some people
00:17 - all right so first of all we have a
00:19 - blank terminal right so let's type
00:22 - mkdir psat1 now make a directory
00:26 - called psat1 and then cd
00:29 - p set one which means change directory
00:31 - to pset one
00:33 - now within psi one we wanna make another
00:35 - directory called hello
00:37 - so make dir hello
00:41 - and then change directory to hello so cd
00:43 - hello
00:45 - all right now that we're done with that
00:47 - click on the folder
00:49 - and you guys will not have any of these
00:51 - you guys will just have this psat one
00:52 - right click on this
00:55 - now click on the hello right click it
00:59 - and then click new file and this new
01:02 - file let's call it
01:03 - hello dot c all right
01:09 - i double tap on hello dot c
01:14 - all right um so now we have a blank uh
01:16 - we have a blank slate
01:18 - and what we need to do now is first
01:20 - thing we need to do
01:21 - is include the normal libraries right so
01:24 - let's include
01:26 - standard io.h
01:30 - and also include cs50.h
01:33 - now these are just the libraries so that
01:35 - we can use the functions
01:36 - all right so let's make a comment
01:39 - include libraries
01:41 - all right now to start the program
01:44 - we need to do int main void and this is
01:47 - nothing more than just saying
01:49 - when green flag clicked on scratch all
01:51 - right so into main void
01:53 - open the flurry brackets the flower
01:55 - brackets um
01:56 - so so what do we need to really do in
01:59 - this program
02:00 - well we need to take some user input and
02:03 - then we need to say
02:05 - hello to whatever the user inputs so
02:07 - let's say the user inputs
02:08 - david we need to say hello david right
02:11 - so first thing we need to do is prompt
02:13 - the user for some input
02:15 - so let's first create a variable called
02:17 - name
02:19 - and that variable is a string right
02:20 - because it's letters
02:22 - so string name
02:25 - equals now how do we get some input from
02:28 - the user
02:29 - if you remember from the lecture it's
02:30 - using the get function
02:32 - all right so get underscore
02:35 - and we want to name from the user so
02:37 - that's a string so get underscore string
02:41 - and we prompt the user for some input
02:42 - let's say what is
02:45 - your name question mark and then we want
02:48 - a new line
02:49 - all right so backslash n that's how we
02:51 - do a new line
02:52 - and semicolon semicolon is just like a
02:54 - full stop right so it's like that's the
02:56 - end of the thought
02:58 - now we don't just want to prompt the
03:00 - user for input we want to say
03:02 - hello name whatever whatever name the
03:05 - user inputs right
03:07 - so now we can use the printf function
03:10 - so printf let's say
03:14 - hello comma and now we want to we want
03:18 - to say hello to whoever
03:19 - to whatever name they type in but we
03:22 - don't know what name that's going to be
03:23 - right because that depends on the user
03:25 - so we can use a placeholder so we just
03:28 - write percent
03:29 - s because it's a string so hello percent
03:32 - s
03:33 - and now we just need to tell the
03:34 - computer where do we need to get it from
03:37 - so we need to get it the percent s comes
03:40 - from a variable
03:40 - called name so percent as comma
03:44 - name right and that's outside the
03:46 - quotation marks
03:48 - so now we just need to put a semicolon
03:50 - all right
03:52 - and that's pretty much it let's just go
03:54 - to file
03:56 - save all right i'll change it save now
03:58 - let's try to
04:00 - make hello compile it all right
04:03 - seems to be going well dot slash hello
04:06 - what is your name uh let's say david
04:11 - hello david okay this is correct right
04:14 - technically but
04:15 - uh we have to also print a new line
04:17 - because it doesn't look nice here does
04:19 - it
04:19 - so let's we forgot to put the backslash
04:22 - n that's just to print a new line
04:24 - now let's compile it again make hello
04:27 - all right
04:28 - seems to be doing well dot hello what is
04:30 - your name let's say bob
04:33 - hello bob okay so that's it for this
04:36 - tutorial guys it was very very simple
04:38 - now let's just put some comments to make
04:40 - it very clear
04:41 - so this line if you remember was to get
04:43 - user input
04:45 - right and the next line was to print
04:49 - hello comma user input so this
04:53 - so those are the commands right and the
04:56 - commands are just to make it very clear
04:57 - with us and it gives us points as well
05:00 - so we're actually graded based on two
05:02 - things the correctness of your code
05:04 - and the style of your code all right so
05:07 - now we just need to check whether
05:08 - everything is correct so we
05:10 - copy the thing from here check function
05:13 - from here
05:14 - and we copy it into the terminal right
05:18 - it asks us for a github username let's
05:20 - put that in
05:21 - and our password as well
05:24 - all right it's going to verify should be
05:27 - correct as we've tested it out
05:29 - but it doesn't hurt try again
05:32 - and by the way guys make sure to
05:34 - subscribe because i'm going to be doing
05:36 - walkthroughs for every single problem
05:38 - set uh
05:39 - for mario cash credit every single
05:42 - problem set of cs50
05:43 - is gonna be posted to this channel so
05:45 - make sure you subscribe
05:47 - and okay so it seems to be correct now
05:49 - let's check for the style
05:51 - style50hello.c right
05:54 - okay it's telling us to put oh okay so
05:58 - we shouldn't have a space
06:00 - in the into main void part let's try
06:02 - that again style50
06:04 - looks good alright so when we're done
06:06 - with that we can actually just go ahead
06:08 - and copy the submit function and paste
06:12 - it into our terminal again now i'm not
06:13 - going to submit because i've already
06:15 - submitted
06:15 - but you guys get the gist of it now this
06:18 - is very easy problem set guys it does
06:20 - get harder
06:21 - so good luck with that but this is it
06:23 - for this video guys make sure to leave a
06:25 - like if
06:26 - you enjoyed if it helped you at all and
06:27 - make sure to subscribe for all future
06:29 - videos
06:30 - thanks guys bye david

hello world welcome to cs50 problem set one hello walkthrough now it's a very simple problem set and the main reason i'm making this video is actually so that i can guide you guys through the process

so make sure you subscribe and okay so it seems to be correct now let's check for the style style50hello.c right okay it's telling us to put oh okay so we shouldn't have a space in the into main void part let's try that again style50 looks good alright so when we're done with that we can actually just go ahead and copy the submit function and paste it into our terminal again now i'm not going to submit because i've already submitted but you guys get the gist of it now this is very easy problem set guys it does get harder so good luck with that but this is it for this video guys make sure to
