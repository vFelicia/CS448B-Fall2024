00:00 - hey guys so today we're gonna be doing
00:02 - Mario more comfortable now it's very
00:04 - very similar to Mario less comfortable
00:07 - but just with a few extra steps so I
00:09 - highly suggest if you haven't done the
00:11 - my you're less comfortable you watch
00:13 - that video first it's in the link in the
00:15 - description so you do that first and
00:17 - this will be much much easier I promise
00:19 - you that so what we're gonna do in this
00:23 - program what we have to do if we have to
00:25 - print a pyramid whose height depends on
00:27 - the user once again it's the same thing
00:29 - so if the user input side of APE we need
00:31 - to print a pyramid with the height of
00:33 - eight and if the user it puts a height
00:35 - of four we need to print a pyramid with
00:36 - a height of four and so on and so forth
00:38 - we've been through this and Amaya's
00:39 - comfortable now the more comfortable
00:42 - version just actually has an extra
00:45 - permit here so remember in the last
00:48 - comfortable version we printed a permit
00:50 - that was right aligned now we just need
00:52 - to print another permit next to that
00:55 - pyramid that's left aligned right that's
00:57 - the only difference between the last and
00:59 - more comfortable versions so to start us
01:01 - off we're gonna actually just copy and
01:04 - paste the code from our last comfortable
01:06 - version and just make a few
01:07 - modifications because it's exactly the
01:10 - same so if you recall this code which we
01:14 - had earlier from the last comfortable
01:17 - when we compile it and run it this is
01:21 - the output right it's all right it's
01:24 - right aligned pyramid alright so we knew
01:26 - that now all we need to do is print a
01:29 - left aligned pyramid beside it okay
01:32 - so the differences are we need a space
01:35 - right we need spaces and we need hashes
01:39 - okay so now you might be tempted
01:43 - immediately to just start another for
01:45 - loop because you might be thinking like
01:47 - okay we've used for loop for everything
01:49 - so far now he is another for loop for
01:51 - the spaces and other for loop for the
01:52 - hashes but you would be wrong
01:54 - because of this simple thing if you try
01:58 - to see a pattern of the number of spaces
01:59 - on every line you'll notice that there
02:02 - is none because the spaces on every line
02:05 - is actually two so on line one there are
02:08 - two spaces online too there are two
02:09 - spaces on line three there are two
02:11 - spaces and so on and so forth
02:13 - so the number of spaces as actually a
02:15 - constant it doesn't depend on anything
02:17 - for Mme line there are only two spaces
02:20 - which means that we don't need any sort
02:23 - of loop how we did Lu is very simply
02:25 - just printf space space we need two
02:30 - spaces all right and that's it now all
02:35 - we need to do next is print a left align
02:39 - pyramid right that's all this is it's a
02:40 - right line pyramid next to a left line
02:42 - pyramid so we know that the spaces come
02:45 - first because the spaces come in between
02:47 - the two hashes so now all we need to do
02:50 - is print a laugh like Burma that's it
02:52 - and we've done this before it the last
02:54 - comfortable version so what we need to
02:56 - do is for column equals 0 call them less
03:02 - than or equal to row column plus plus
03:07 - all right so we just need a print a hash
03:13 - and it's that simple and that's just
03:16 - because we've already gone through all
03:18 - the logic in the last comfortable
03:19 - version if you remember that so it's
03:22 - exactly the same logic it's the same
03:24 - conditions it's the same everything to
03:26 - print a pyramid next to this pyramid all
03:29 - right and it's all within the same main
03:31 - loop so basically what's happening here
03:33 - is this whole loop is we're printing a
03:36 - new line before we print a new line we
03:38 - want to print the spaces to make the
03:40 - right line pavement actually right
03:41 - aligned we're going to print the hashes
03:43 - for the right line pyramid we want to
03:46 - put the spaces between the left line and
03:48 - the right line pyramid and finally we
03:51 - want to print the hashes for the left
03:52 - line pyramid so it really is that simple
03:55 - now let's just check its compiler code
03:57 - and dot slash Mario to run it I'm sure
04:02 - right here let's save for and that's
04:05 - pretty much it guys it's very very
04:07 - simple if you've completed the last
04:08 - comfortable version everything just
04:10 - makes sense logically and if you want
04:13 - you can go ahead and check 50 and
04:17 - everything should be okay here as we
04:20 - know so type in your github username
04:24 - and password alright and while this is
04:31 - preparing guys I'm gonna be uploading
04:33 - every single problem set for the cs50
04:36 - course so make sure to subscribe cuz
04:39 - you're gonna get the entire cs50 course
04:41 - solutions on this channel also make sure
04:43 - to leave a like on this video if it
04:45 - helped you I hope it was simple enough
04:47 - to understand it was just literally two
04:48 - extra steps from the last comfortable
04:51 - version and that's pretty much it for
04:53 - this video guys I hope you enjoyed and
04:55 - yeah
04:57 - peace bye David

hey guys so today we're gonna be doing Mario more comfortable now it's very very similar to Mario less comfortable but just with a few extra steps so I highly suggest if you haven't done the my you're less comfortable you watch that video first it's in the link in the description so you do that first and this will be much much easier I promise you that so what we're gonna do in this program what we have to do if we have to print a pyramid whose height depends on the user once again it's the same thing so if the user input side of APE we need to print a pyramid with the height of eight and if the user it puts a height of four we need to print a pyramid with a height of four and so on and so forth we've been through this and Amaya's comfortable now the more comfortable version just actually has an extra permit here so remember in the last comfortable version we printed a permit that was right aligned now we just need to print another permit next to that pyramid that's left aligned right that's the only difference between the last and more comfortable versions so to start us off we're gonna actually just copy and paste the code from our last comfortable version and just make a few modifications because it's exactly the same so if you recall this code which we had earlier from the last comfortable when we compile it and run it this is the output right it's all right it's right aligned pyramid alright so we knew that now all we need to do is print a left aligned pyramid beside it okay so the differences are we need a space right we need spaces and we need hashes okay so now you might be tempted immediately to just start another for loop because you might be thinking like okay we've used for loop for everything so far now he is another for loop for the spaces and other for loop for the hashes but you would be wrong because of this simple thing if you try to see a pattern of the number of spaces on every line you'll notice that there is none because the spaces on every line is actually two so on line one there are two spaces online too there are two spaces on line three there are two spaces and so on and so forth so the number of spaces as actually a constant it doesn't depend on anything for Mme line there are only two spaces which means that we don't need any sort of loop how we did Lu is very simply just printf space space we need two spaces all right and that's it now all we need to do next is print a left align pyramid right that's all this is it's a right line pyramid next to a left line pyramid so we know that the spaces come first because the spaces come in between the two hashes so now all we need to do is print a laugh like Burma that's it and we've done this before it the last comfortable version so what we need to do is for column equals 0 call them less than or equal to row column plus plus all right so we just need a print a hash and it's that simple and that's just because we've already gone through all the logic in the last comfortable version if you remember that so it's exactly the same logic it's the same conditions it's the same everything to print a pyramid next to this pyramid all right and it's all within the same main loop so basically what's happening here is this whole loop is we're printing a new line before we print a new line we want to print the spaces to make the right line pavement actually right aligned we're going to print the hashes for the right line pyramid we want to put the spaces between the left line and the right line pyramid and finally we want to print the hashes for the left line pyramid so it really is that simple now let's just check its compiler code and dot slash Mario to run it I'm sure right here let's save for and that's pretty much it guys it's very very simple if you've completed the last comfortable version everything just makes sense logically and if you want you can go ahead and check 50 and everything should be okay here as we know so type in your github username and password alright and while this is preparing guys I'm gonna be uploading every single problem set for the cs50 course so make sure to subscribe cuz you're gonna get the entire cs50 course solutions on this channel also make sure to leave a like on this video if it helped you I hope it was simple enough to understand it was just literally two extra steps from the last comfortable version and that's pretty much it for this video guys I hope you enjoyed and yeah peace bye David
