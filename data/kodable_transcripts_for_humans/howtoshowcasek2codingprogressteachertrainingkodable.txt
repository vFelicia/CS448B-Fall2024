00:15 - we are almost done before i wrap up i'll
00:18 - just share some quick tips for what to
00:20 - do after you've evaluated student
00:22 - progress so
00:24 - you've
00:25 - if we kind of summarize what we've
00:26 - talked about so far you've thought about
00:28 - the standards you've used it to guide
00:30 - what you're teaching and what you're
00:32 - hoping students will learn then you
00:34 - might have employed some of the methods
00:36 - for evaluation you've conducted
00:38 - interviews you've
00:40 - looked at their designs and
00:43 - emphasize projects and now
00:46 - you want to share it and uh thinking
00:48 - about how to share student learning
00:51 - progress with admin and parents
00:54 - depending on how many students you have
00:55 - it can be a lot and i'm hoping that
00:57 - these
00:58 - these just quick possibilities are
01:00 - something that you might choose to do to
01:02 - showcase
01:04 - the growth and the skills that the kids
01:05 - have gained
01:06 - which again i mentioned are a bit harder
01:08 - to quantify so sharing it can be tricky
01:13 - so the first is show don't tell
01:15 - basically make learning and progress
01:18 - visible and this doesn't need to be a
01:19 - competition or like a star chart on your
01:22 - wall just having some sort of visual
01:25 - depiction of progress can be really
01:28 - motivating and inspiring
01:31 - and i would say
01:32 - as a
01:33 - teacher interested in bringing
01:35 - computer science education into your
01:37 - classroom you're likely also open to
01:41 - using technology in new ways so i would
01:43 - say take advantage of the digital medium
01:45 - you can think about posting
01:48 - project examples that your kids have
01:50 - done on a class page online or as a
01:53 - newsletter
01:55 - or like featured in a slide deck or
01:56 - something where you're utilizing the
01:58 - digital medium to share
02:01 - work and
02:03 - really who the students are to admin and
02:06 - parents and other teachers
02:10 - second would be to invite peers to join
02:13 - your class um when i was a computer
02:15 - science teacher i was the only teacher
02:17 - at my school who was teaching coding and
02:19 - there were so many other teachers that i
02:21 - worked with that simply had no idea what
02:24 - my kids were doing in my classroom
02:26 - because it was so different from what
02:29 - other classes might look like so when i
02:31 - started inviting them in just to have
02:33 - them view the work that my kids were
02:36 - doing
02:37 - they
02:37 - they were so excited to see the content
02:39 - crossover and they were
02:41 - more apt to ask their students what they
02:43 - were learning computer science and i
02:46 - just think it's a really nice way to
02:48 - illuminate this again this subject
02:50 - computer science for k2 students is a
02:53 - really new idea and the best way to
02:56 - share progress a lot of the time is just
02:58 - to invite others to witness it
03:03 - the third is to host an event as i've
03:05 - mentioned time and time again today i
03:07 - love projects as a way to demonstrate
03:10 - and assess
03:12 - learning and
03:14 - uh
03:15 - if you would like to showcase student
03:18 - progress
03:19 - if you've been doing project-based
03:21 - learning in your classroom hosting some
03:22 - sort of an event that
03:24 - puts the projects on display is a really
03:27 - awesome way to do that so
03:30 - again using my own experience as a
03:32 - computer science teacher we did a
03:34 - project-based unit learning unit on
03:37 - game design and at the end we had a mini
03:40 - maker faire where students got to
03:43 - showcase
03:44 - a lot of them had physical games that
03:46 - they had created like with recycled
03:48 - materials and also had games that they
03:51 - had coded um on scratch that they had on
03:54 - the chromebooks and we invited friends
03:56 - and family to come and interact with
03:59 - them and i just think this is a really
04:02 - lovely way for
04:04 - your young students to be able to share
04:07 - the progress the effort that they've put
04:09 - forth throughout the unit and just get
04:12 - the community involved a little bit
04:14 - it can be a really nice way to share the
04:16 - progress there

we are almost done before i wrap up i'll just share some quick tips for what to do after you've evaluated student progress so you've if we kind of summarize what we've talked about so far you've thought about the standards you've used it to guide what you're teaching and what you're hoping students will learn then you might have employed some of the methods for evaluation you've conducted interviews you've looked at their designs and emphasize projects and now you want to share it and uh thinking about how to share student learning progress with admin and parents depending on how many students you have it can be a lot and i'm hoping that these these just quick possibilities are something that you might choose to do to showcase the growth and the skills that the kids have gained which again i mentioned are a bit harder to quantify so sharing it can be tricky so the first is show don't tell basically make learning and progress visible and this doesn't need to be a competition or like a star chart on your wall just having some sort of visual depiction of progress can be really motivating and inspiring and i would say as a teacher interested in bringing computer science education into your classroom you're likely also open to using technology in new ways so i would say take advantage of the digital medium you can think about posting project examples that your kids have done on a class page online or as a newsletter or like featured in a slide deck or something where you're utilizing the digital medium to share work and really who the students are to admin and parents and other teachers second would be to invite peers to join your class um when i was a computer science teacher i was the only teacher at my school who was teaching coding and there were so many other teachers that i worked with that simply had no idea what my kids were doing in my classroom because it was so different from what other classes might look like so when i started inviting them in just to have them view the work that my kids were doing they they were so excited to see the content crossover and they were more apt to ask their students what they were learning computer science and i just think it's a really nice way to illuminate this again this subject computer science for k2 students is a really new idea and the best way to share progress a lot of the time is just to invite others to witness it the third is to host an event as i've mentioned time and time again today i love projects as a way to demonstrate and assess learning and uh if you would like to showcase student progress if you've been doing projectbased learning in your classroom hosting some sort of an event that puts the projects on display is a really awesome way to do that so again using my own experience as a computer science teacher we did a projectbased unit learning unit on game design and at the end we had a mini maker faire where students got to showcase a lot of them had physical games that they had created like with recycled materials and also had games that they had coded um on scratch that they had on the chromebooks and we invited friends and family to come and interact with them and i just think this is a really lovely way for your young students to be able to share the progress the effort that they've put forth throughout the unit and just get the community involved a little bit it can be a really nice way to share the progress there
