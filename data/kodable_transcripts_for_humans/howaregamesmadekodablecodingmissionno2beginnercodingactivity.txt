00:01 - think about your favorite games
00:04 - have you ever wondered how they were
00:06 - made or why they look the way they do
00:10 - there are a lot of steps and different
00:11 - jobs involved in creating a game
00:14 - today you will practice these steps as
00:16 - you design and test your own computer
00:18 - game encodable
00:20 - here's your mission
00:21 - design your own version of an asteroid
00:24 - blaster game
00:25 - use conditional statements to make
00:27 - observations as you change the game code
00:32 - so what goes into making a game
00:35 - well people
00:36 - here at codable we have two programmers
00:39 - one artist one head of product and one
00:41 - project manager all working on the game
00:43 - you love to play
00:45 - that's five people who collaborate and
00:47 - work together to make one game come to
00:49 - life
00:50 - let's start from the beginning though
00:52 - there are some basic steps that people
00:54 - go through in the process of making a
00:56 - game
00:57 - step 1 imagine what is the idea for your
01:00 - game
01:02 - step 2 design
01:04 - what will your game look like and how
01:06 - will it work
01:07 - step 3 create
01:09 - program your game step 4 test have
01:14 - people try it out and give feedback
01:16 - step 5 improve
01:18 - what is working what could be better
01:22 - repeat this process to continue to
01:23 - improve your game over time
01:27 - let's take a look at this process in
01:29 - codable's game designer
01:35 - we've already taken care of step 1 and
01:37 - come up with the idea for this game
01:39 - the goal is to clear the colored
01:41 - asteroids with the fuzzballs
01:44 - today you will help with the rest of the
01:46 - steps
01:47 - here's what you'll do
01:49 - first open the game settings and take a
01:52 - look at the code
01:53 - you can add to it or change it
01:56 - for example
01:57 - if you apply the galaxy background
02:01 - then the background will change colors
02:05 - in programming this if then relationship
02:08 - is called a conditional statement
02:11 - for every design decision that you make
02:13 - in this activity you can use a
02:16 - conditional statement to observe the
02:17 - effects
02:20 - let's look at another example this time
02:22 - in the asteroids file
02:25 - if i select drop direction up
02:29 - then the asteroids will clear by moving
02:31 - up
02:35 - in the bins file
02:37 - if the number of bins is five
02:40 - then i have more asteroids to play with
02:44 - use conditional statements like these to
02:46 - observe changes as you design the rest
02:49 - of your game
02:52 - be sure to save your code by clicking
02:54 - the green check mark each time
02:58 - you did it
03:00 - when you are done test it out
03:04 - trade with a partner for them to play
03:06 - too and get feedback
03:10 - finally make changes based on feedback
03:12 - from your partner
03:14 - for example if your friend says the game
03:16 - was too hard you will want to change the
03:18 - difficulty
03:20 - if you choose hacker then it will be
03:22 - hard
03:23 - but if you choose normal then it will be
03:26 - easier
03:29 - don't forget game designers are never
03:31 - done after just one try building a game
03:34 - takes a lot of testing and improvement
03:37 - just look at how codable has changed
03:38 - over the years
03:40 - and we're not done yet
03:44 - now it's your turn open game designer
03:47 - create a game and complete your mission
03:51 - design your own version of an asteroid
03:54 - blaster game
03:55 - use conditional statements to make
03:57 - observations as you change the game code
04:01 - good luck
