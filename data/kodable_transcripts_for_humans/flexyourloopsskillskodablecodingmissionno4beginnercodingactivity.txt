00:00 - let's talk about loops
00:02 - loops are a command programmers use to
00:04 - repeat a part of their code until a task
00:07 - is complete
00:09 - loops are important because they help
00:10 - your code stay bug free keep your code
00:13 - short and save you programming time
00:17 - loops are useful in everyday life too
00:19 - anytime you repeat the same task
00:21 - multiple times like practicing your
00:24 - basketball shot or jumping on a
00:25 - trampoline you are looping an action
00:29 - they're especially helpful for a
00:30 - computer
00:31 - remember a computer can't do anything
00:34 - unless instructed to by a human
00:37 - loops are one of the tools that a
00:38 - programmer can use to more easily give
00:41 - instructions to a computer
00:44 - here's your mission
00:46 - create a fun fitness program for the
00:48 - fuzz family using loops in your
00:51 - instructions
00:52 - so you might be wondering what do loops
00:54 - have to do with a workout routine
00:57 - think about everything you need to do to
00:59 - use a jump rope
01:01 - you swing the rope up
01:03 - you swing the rope down and you jump
01:05 - repeat the same task over and over and
01:08 - over again that's jumping rope
01:11 - as a human you wouldn't have to think
01:13 - about every single step separately
01:16 - but what if you wanted to explain how to
01:18 - use a jump rope to your fuzz friend who
01:21 - has never even heard or tried it before
01:24 - instead of saying jump rope 10 times
01:28 - you would have to break down the
01:29 - instructions for every single step
01:32 - swing up swing down jump swing up swing
01:35 - down jump
01:37 - over and over and over again
01:39 - instead you can use a loop in your code
01:42 - to turn this
01:43 - into this the result is the same your
01:46 - fuzz will jump rope 10 times but the
01:49 - loop helps to make your code shorter
01:52 - and saves you the time it would take to
01:54 - write out all those repeating commands
01:57 - today your coding mission is to create a
02:00 - fun fitness program
02:01 - include at least three exercises in your
02:04 - routine and decide how many times each
02:07 - of the moves should be looped
02:09 - let's take a look at an example from our
02:11 - fuzz family
02:12 - they've shared with you their fuzzy flex
02:14 - program and we're all going to try it
02:16 - out together
02:17 - just do your best it's okay if you need
02:20 - to practice the moves a few times
02:23 - the first move is jumping jacks
02:25 - one jumping jack looks like this
02:28 - our program says to loop this action ten
02:31 - times
02:32 - let's try it
02:33 - one
02:34 - two three
02:37 - four
02:38 - five
02:39 - six
02:40 - seven
02:41 - eight
02:41 - nine
02:42 - ten
02:43 - awesome job
02:45 - the next move is push-ups
02:47 - one push-up looks like this
02:50 - let's loop this action five times
02:53 - one
02:54 - two
02:55 - three
02:56 - four
02:57 - five
02:58 - nice work
03:00 - the final move is the side stretch
03:03 - one looks like this
03:05 - we will loop this action ten times
03:08 - here we go
03:09 - one
03:10 - two
03:11 - three
03:12 - four
03:13 - five
03:14 - six
03:15 - seven
03:16 - eight
03:17 - nine
03:18 - ten
03:19 - nice job you completed the fuzzy flex
03:21 - program
03:23 - this program was easy to follow
03:26 - but think about how long and difficult
03:28 - the fuzzy flex program would have been
03:30 - to write and to follow if we couldn't
03:32 - use loops
03:33 - for example the instructions for 10
03:35 - jumping jacks would look like this
03:42 - now it's your turn
03:43 - create a fuzzy flex program of your own
03:46 - with at least three different exercise
03:48 - moves
03:49 - use a loop to specify the number of
03:51 - times each exercise should be repeated
03:54 - write out your program and share it with
03:56 - a friend or a family member to test out
03:59 - make changes to your loops as needed if
04:01 - the moves are too easy try increasing
04:04 - the number of times it should be
04:05 - repeated
04:07 - too hard take the number of loops down
04:10 - it's up to you
04:12 - good luck
