00:04 - hey this is gretchen
00:05 - i am going to go over conditions or if
00:08 - then statements
00:09 - we're going to start in smee board and
00:12 - lesson if then
00:14 - roll
00:16 - so conditions are an exception to a rule
00:20 - they allow your code to become more
00:21 - dynamic so
00:23 - for example if there was a password
00:27 - and if you get the password correct
00:30 - then the computer will allow you to
00:32 - enter the program
00:33 - if you get it wrong then it'll tell you
00:35 - to try again
00:38 - encodable conditions are represented by
00:40 - colored tiles
00:42 - they're all different colors so the rule
00:45 - is
00:46 - fuzz is gonna roll until it hits a wall
00:49 - uh the exception would be if the tile is
00:52 - purple
00:53 - then go down so i'm gonna show you how
00:55 - we're gonna program
00:56 - him to do that
01:01 - so we're gonna go forward first and
01:04 - we're gonna go down
01:06 - we're gonna use this purple tile here to
01:08 - tell him to go
01:09 - down at the purple tile on the map so
01:12 - we're going to say
01:13 - if the tile is purple then go down
01:16 - we do that by putting the purple tile
01:19 - underneath the down arrow
01:21 - then we're going to go forward so let's
01:23 - see what happens when we do that
01:29 - yay we did it awesome
01:33 - so that's how conditions are used and
01:34 - codable if you have any questions you
01:36 - can always take a look at the codable
01:38 - learning guide
