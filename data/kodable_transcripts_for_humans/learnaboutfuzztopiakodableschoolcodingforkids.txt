00:46 - into place you unlocked mission control
00:51 - from this treehouse you and the fuzz
00:54 - family can blast off to

00:58 - they're all
00:59 - shown here on your mission control
01:01 - screen
01:02 - each world has its own game in smeeborg
01:06 - you write programs that tell a fuzz how

01:21 - in bug world you create and modify
01:23 - heroes that will defend your spaceship
01:25 - from the slimes
01:28 - at beach cleanup you can use code for

01:47 - game levels and worlds you can explore
01:50 - and might tell you what world to go to
01:52 - at certain times
01:55 - as you play levels your code rank goes
01:58 - up
01:58 - this means you're learning how to code
02:00 - and can earn rewards in the game
02:03 - like new activities more fuzzes
02:06 - and cool badges when your code rank is
02:09 - high enough
02:10 - other buildings on fuzztopia will unlock
02:14 - these have fun projects inside
02:17 - first fuzz builder where you can code
02:19 - your own member of the fuzz family

02:24 - game designer where you design an
02:26 - asteroid blaster game with
02:28 - properties based on what you want

02:34 - own techno maze level
02:38 - if you get confused at some point in the
02:40 - game that's okay
02:42 - computer scientists are always learning
02:44 - and solving problems

02:51 - to see the videos your teacher assigned
02:53 - to help you get
02:54 - unstuck one last thing
02:58 - this is the fustopia store when you earn

03:02 - you can spend them on new costumes for
03:04 - fuzzes and decorations for fustopia
03:07 - to shop in the store ask your parents to
03:09 - play codable at home
03:12 - that's it for this tour of fuzztopia the
03:14 - fuzz family
03:15 - can't wait to see you here again soon
03:18 - happy coding
