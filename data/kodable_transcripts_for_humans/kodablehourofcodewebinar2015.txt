00:00 - alright so right here I'm Gretchen this
00:06 - is mike o'connor john and we just wanted
00:11 - to quickly go over what the hour of code
00:13 - is if you guys so that um if you have
00:16 - any questions or if you are not sure
00:19 - what's happening or if this is your
00:20 - first time we can answer all those
00:22 - questions for you so just going to
00:24 - quickly go over everything that you
00:26 - would need to know if you wanted to do
00:27 - an hour of code with Kota Bowl um and
00:30 - then we'll have questions probably
00:32 - somewhere in the middle and then at the
00:33 - end um all right so I'm just gonna tell
00:36 - you guys a little bit about what the
00:38 - hour of code is and why it's important
00:41 - so the hour of code is an event that was
00:45 - organized by Cobourg and CSI week as an
00:50 - opportunity to promote computer science
00:53 - to kids all around the world they want
00:56 - to get as many kids as possible to try
00:58 - at least one hour of code I'm sure that
01:01 - you all know the incredible demand for
01:04 - technical talent people who understand
01:06 - programming who can program or who just
01:09 - can you know use technology successfully
01:12 - so that is the that's the purpose at the
01:16 - hour of code to get more kids aware of
01:18 - what computer science is and why it's
01:20 - important and how it can how they can
01:23 - use it to make change in their
01:26 - communities and in the world so um it's
01:29 - during the second week of December every
01:33 - year to honor grace hopper who was an
01:37 - incredible computer scientist she
01:40 - invented the first compiler which makes
01:42 - it possible for us to program using
01:44 - programming languages she was also the
01:46 - first person to have a bug in her in a
01:51 - program and that was because there was
01:52 - an actual moth in her computer haha so
01:55 - she she coined the term bug um so yeah
01:58 - that's a little bit of fun a little bit
02:01 - of a fun thing to talk with students
02:03 - about so i can share later the link to
02:07 - information about her she's pretty
02:09 - awesome she was an admiral in the US
02:11 - Navy
02:13 - so if you're going to be using co double
02:16 - then it's important to get prepared so
02:20 - I'm going to go over a little bit about
02:22 - everything you should do to prepare for
02:24 - the hour of code and this is in general
02:27 - if you're using anything it'll probably
02:28 - be helpful to do some of these things
02:30 - and then we'll go over what to do during
02:33 - the hour of code know as the events
02:36 - happening what to expect and then if you
02:39 - want to go beyond one hour with your
02:40 - students if you're planning on doing
02:42 - more stuff with your kids later um next
02:47 - semester or even next school year we'll
02:49 - go over some of the stuff that you can
02:50 - do with co double there too so I'm
02:54 - here's the link real quick to Grace
02:57 - Hopper should be able to see it on the
03:02 - side of your screen ok um show item
03:08 - alright great so first we'll go over
03:11 - Kota bowl I'm so quotable is programming
03:14 - curriculum for elementary schools and
03:17 - this year we're doing something we've
03:19 - never done before we're providing lesson
03:21 - plans to everybody great specific lesson
03:25 - plans for the hour of code for free you
03:27 - do not need an account to use these you
03:29 - do not need to pay to use these they're
03:31 - completely free um predominantly
03:34 - unplugged so there's a lot of unplugged
03:35 - options for you this year so i'll go
03:38 - ahead and show you that um real quickly
03:47 - so you can see what they look like um so
03:50 - here are where you can find our lesson
03:52 - plans its code will accomplish our code
03:55 - / lessons and I'll share this link as
03:58 - well but you can see we have K through 5
04:00 - lesson plans available it's all
04:03 - basically the same but we've scaled it
04:06 - up what lessons you're actually what
04:09 - concepts you're actually covering for
04:11 - each grade level all of these lesson
04:13 - plans can be done in about an hour so
04:16 - you can cut things out if you have a
04:18 - little bit less time but that's building
04:20 - in time for some independent practice on
04:24 - the devices so if you don't have device
04:27 - then you can automatically cut out 10
04:29 - minutes um so it's pretty fun it's a fun
04:32 - activity where you um get the kids
04:36 - together and you talk about what a
04:37 - programmer is and why they're important
04:39 - and what they do with giving you a lot
04:41 - of that information here and then you
04:43 - have to program someone in the room
04:46 - usually it's helpful if it's an adult
04:47 - because you can tell them ahead of time
04:50 - what they need to do how they need to
04:51 - act as a robot but the students program
04:55 - then to do something so in this activity
04:57 - it's a walk forward turn around and jump
04:59 - and you have to you have to program them
05:02 - to do this and we give you some code in
05:04 - order to do it and and you talk with the
05:06 - students about why that code is
05:07 - important and so it really builds up
05:10 - their understanding of what programming
05:13 - is it gives them a nice real world
05:15 - example a tangible example which is
05:17 - great for I know a lot of you guys
05:19 - mentioned that you're doing this with
05:20 - kindergarteners um it's great for you
05:23 - know pre readers kindergarteners it's
05:25 - nice for them to have like a tangible
05:27 - example of what they're going to be
05:28 - doing um and then after you're finished
05:32 - you can check for understanding and have
05:34 - them go do a little bit of programming
05:38 - on their own on their devices um and
05:41 - like I said there's lesson plans for
05:44 - kindergarten first grade second grade
05:45 - third grade fourth grade fifth grade
05:47 - each of them is slightly different if
05:49 - you have kids who are pretty experience
05:51 - with programming if you guys have been
05:53 - doing this for a while um just jump up
05:56 - probably to the next grade level you
05:58 - know best what's appropriate for your
06:00 - student so I'm just take a look at all
06:03 - of them and decide what you think your
06:04 - students can handle um if you're working
06:07 - with some of you said you were working
06:08 - with middle school students our fifth
06:10 - grade lesson plan is pretty it covers
06:12 - quite a bit so I think that this would
06:15 - easily scale up for sixth and seventh
06:18 - grade students once you're getting into
06:19 - 8th 9th takes you know high school age
06:21 - um then I'm not so sure if you could do
06:25 - it if it's their very first introduction
06:27 - then yeah I think that it would probably
06:29 - be appropriate um so co double is a
06:36 - available
06:38 - desktop iPad web and Android it works on
06:44 - Safari Chrome Internet Explorer Firefox
06:48 - you have to have pretty new versions of
06:50 - these browsers in order for it to work
06:53 - correctly um you need OS X 1.8 at 10.8
06:58 - sorry Tim point 8 or higher in Windows 7
07:01 - or higher and then for Android it's 2.3
07:04 - and iOS is six point 0 or higher um yeah
07:08 - so that's a little bit about the devices
07:10 - um and i'll go ahead and share the
07:13 - activities for you hiya John was saying
07:23 - I've got my nice watch outfit on I'm
07:26 - going to be the Lord Commander you Jon
07:28 - Snow my fur okay so there's that link
07:34 - okay now a few of you are asking
07:38 - questions about whether or not to set up
07:40 - a class and um if that if you think that
07:44 - that would be if we thought that that
07:47 - would be necessary for you for the our
07:49 - code it really depends on what you're
07:51 - trying to do afterward so you think that
07:53 - you are going to be doing a lot of
07:56 - coding after the hour of code if you're
07:58 - planning on making this like a you know
08:00 - something that you do somewhat regularly
08:02 - at your school then I would definitely
08:03 - recommend setting up a class it's just
08:06 - going to make your life a whole lot
08:07 - easier afterward I know that it's a
08:10 - little bit of work up front but it's
08:11 - going to make things a whole lot easier
08:13 - for you so um what you need in order to
08:16 - do that is just a roster of all of your
08:19 - students um it takes just two or three
08:23 - minutes to set up one class you can copy
08:25 - and paste from your roster it's real
08:28 - simple and then after that all the kids
08:30 - need is that class code you can make it
08:32 - whatever you want and they can log in
08:35 - using that class code you can also if
08:38 - you're using the web version you can
08:40 - also bookmark that you have a unique URL
08:42 - so that makes it really easy for the
08:44 - students to get logged in I can actually
08:47 - i'll just show you really quickly how
08:48 - you
08:48 - logged in with a class and then how you
08:50 - would get logged in without a class so
08:53 - the hour of code you're going to want to
08:59 - go to game notable calm our dash of the
09:07 - hash code um if you are not using a
09:11 - class you will play without saving and
09:14 - that just automatically creates an
09:17 - anonymous user you can the kids can play
09:19 - there's like literally no setup um they
09:23 - can hit save and exit and get this
09:25 - student code but you will have to write
09:26 - it down and enter it next time if you
09:28 - want to continue where you left off um
09:30 - if you want to if you want to play with
09:39 - a class code or student code play with
09:42 - class code or student code and then
09:43 - enter the class code and this works the
09:48 - same on the iPad except on the iPad you
09:50 - can save the class code so you don't
09:52 - have to enter it every time here we go
09:55 - so you can see here my students um you
09:59 - just tap that will tap their name on the
10:01 - iPad or they or Android click their name
10:04 - if they're using the web version and
10:06 - then they can continue if you just hit
10:09 - the spaceship it takes you directly to
10:11 - where you left off so it was really nice
10:16 - if you're planning on doing any coding
10:18 - after the hour of code that um you know
10:21 - if you come back after the holiday break
10:23 - and you're ready to get started some of
10:24 - the kids won't remember is that where
10:26 - they were they can just hit play and
10:28 - they'll be safe like all their progress
10:31 - will be saved you'll be able to view
10:33 - their progress on our dashboard there's
10:35 - a lot of extra benefits if this is just
10:38 - a one-time thing that I definitely
10:39 - recommend using just a local profile on
10:43 - your student devices on the iPads or
10:45 - Android devices or just using the play
10:48 - without saving on the web version it
10:50 - will just be super simple for you oh
10:54 - yeah um can you go back to the class
10:57 - overview page listen yeah I just wanted
11:00 - to let everyone know that you
11:02 - could actually bookmark that URL the
11:04 - Garrett calm / class / famous glass for
11:09 - your classes instead of famous class
11:10 - you'll see your class code there but if
11:13 - you're using if you're working with
11:14 - younger kids in kindergarten first grade
11:16 - and they might have trouble typing in
11:17 - their class code you can bookmark those
11:19 - URLs for the students and then if you go
11:21 - there directly you'll immediately get to
11:23 - their class roster and they'll be able
11:25 - to click on their name so you can see
11:28 - there's my famous class now and I can
11:30 - just come directly here um spell yeah
11:33 - that's super simple to if you're using a
11:35 - class code um here's all right um oh I
11:44 - also wanted to let you all know if
11:46 - you're planning on um some things that
11:49 - you want to do if you're getting
11:50 - prepared ahead of time um we have
11:55 - certificates also for students so i'll
11:57 - share that link as well so that when
11:59 - everybody finishes you can just you know
12:01 - sign their names and they've completed
12:03 - an hour of code and that they know I've
12:07 - done an hour of programming their
12:09 - programmers now it's a lot of fun it's
12:11 - all share a link to that as well um but
12:15 - yeah that's a little bit about setting
12:16 - up a class vs not setting up a class
12:18 - it's really your choice we made it
12:20 - pretty easy to do either option it's
12:22 - just a little bit more work if you want
12:24 - to do it ahead of time but it will save
12:27 - you in the long run if you want to not
12:30 - set up a class and then import students
12:32 - you can do that like after say you try
12:35 - this out and then later on you want to
12:37 - continue with it you can have those
12:39 - student codes you write down and you can
12:41 - import them but it gets a little bit
12:43 - tedious you did know think about just
12:45 - doing that for 25 students so be kind of
12:48 - a pain but um but yeah saving saving you
12:51 - a little bit of time is doing a little
12:53 - bit of work up front so um I guess I'm
12:58 - gonna see if we've got any questions on
13:00 - Twitter um no it doesn't look like it
13:04 - you guys can also add questions on the
13:07 - side here so we have questions okay what
13:11 - is a quick way to bookmark when using
13:13 - iPad
13:14 - so if you are going to be using co
13:16 - double on an iPad um i would suggest
13:19 - well you have to download the app in
13:21 - order to use it um so then just go over
13:24 - with students before you get started
13:25 - what the icon looks like um it's the
13:28 - same as our Google+ and YouTube and all
13:32 - of our social media icons it's just a
13:34 - gold square where the blue fuzz on the
13:37 - front um go over that with students say
13:39 - okay whatever we're going to go to go to
13:41 - this one this is co dab'll then that
13:44 - that makes it really easy to know
13:45 - exactly where to go on the iPad if you
13:48 - do set up a class then once you enter
13:51 - that class code one time it'll be saved
13:54 - on the iPad so you never have to enter
13:57 - it again they just go over what your
13:59 - class name is um you can make it
14:01 - whatever you want say you can always
14:02 - make it something that the students will
14:04 - remember they just tap on that and then
14:07 - they tap their name very similar to what
14:08 - happens on the web version um and okay
14:14 - got it I selected this question no it's
14:19 - answered okay oh that is here's your
14:22 - question Valerie if it doesn't let me
14:24 - know okay um so if anybody else has
14:28 - questions feel free to put them here I'm
14:30 - happy to answer them um so let's go over
14:35 - a little bit of where to get the
14:37 - different versions of koda bolt so we
14:40 - have an hour of code page setup where
14:44 - you can find all of the stuff that I'm
14:46 - sharing here um go ahead and share that
14:50 - it's co double com / our dash of dash
14:56 - code and that has all of this it has
15:01 - links to download everything um it has
15:04 - links to the web version it has linked
15:07 - to our unplugged activities as links to
15:09 - the what up to the certificate and to
15:12 - our lesson plans so you can find
15:14 - everything that you need here i'll go
15:19 - ahead and show it to you real quick
15:25 - alright so you can see a lesson plans
15:38 - page alright hour of code um so here's
15:45 - where kids can get started I think it's
15:47 - probably easier for you less
15:48 - distractions on this page if you just
15:50 - bookmark the page that we talked about
15:52 - game not co double calm um but you can
15:57 - also have them play here it'll take them
15:58 - directly to it um and then this is where
16:01 - you can find the lesson plans and here's
16:03 - where you can find where to download or
16:07 - set up everything so we better pc
16:10 - version mac web ipad android and
16:15 - unplugged um you can share quotable and
16:18 - then here's a link to these certificates
16:20 - to download for your students and this
16:22 - is co double calm / hour of codes i just
16:26 - shared it on the side here um so that's
16:31 - just about everything you need in order
16:34 - to get set up um if you if you have any
16:42 - questions feel free to post them on the
16:43 - side here um okay good great alright so
16:50 - let's see during the day up so one thing
16:55 - to consider if you're planning an hour
16:57 - of code for no matter what you're
16:59 - planning on using what it's quotable
17:00 - anything else um code.org might find
17:04 - anything i would definitely recommend
17:07 - having a plan B so everybody's servers
17:10 - get hit pretty hard um but everyone
17:17 - servers get hit pretty hard and so there
17:21 - might be a little bit of spotty service
17:22 - ours are set up in a way that is very
17:24 - very unlikely for you to see any issues
17:28 - with loading times or anything like that
17:30 - um we scale it pretty well so I don't
17:34 - expect to have any trouble if you're
17:36 - using the eye
17:37 - version on the android version or the
17:39 - desktop version that's irrelevant there
17:42 - will be any issues with Internet
17:43 - connectivity there and if you you asked
17:46 - about saving progress on those versions
17:49 - you'd actually don't need internet to
17:51 - use them um it'll just save eventually
17:55 - like the next time yeah the device
17:56 - connects to the Internet it'll save
17:58 - their progress up that way so there's no
18:02 - need to have internet for those versions
18:04 - for the web version obviously you have
18:05 - to have the Internet um but yeah there
18:08 - shouldn't be any trouble with with our
18:10 - servers that did that week but it's
18:13 - always important to have a plan B so um
18:16 - we have quite a few i plug lesson plans
18:20 - available we have the fuzz family frenzy
18:23 - which is a lot of fun you have kids pick
18:25 - a partner so after you go over like what
18:27 - a programmer is and you program someone
18:30 - at front of the room together and then
18:32 - you can have them break up into pairs
18:34 - and they have to program a partner to go
18:36 - through an obstacle course some people
18:38 - have used toilet paper to set up mazes
18:41 - in their gym which is really cool idea
18:43 - people have just had them go from one
18:46 - end of the classroom to the other some
18:47 - people go out to the playground and have
18:49 - them hula hoop and it's just a lot of
18:51 - fun you can use whatever resources you
18:53 - have available around you um but uh but
18:59 - that's a really good resource salt be
19:01 - sure to share that with you guys um and
19:07 - this is in our curriculum as well as if
19:10 - you have Co dab'll um you have access to
19:13 - this on your teacher dashboard also it's
19:19 - the fuzz family friends e so this is a
19:21 - really good plan B if anything goes
19:23 - wrong or say like one of your devices
19:25 - just decides not to work um that day
19:28 - that happens just have a plan B no
19:31 - matter what it is even if it's not the
19:32 - fuzz family frenzy have a plan B just in
19:34 - case things go awry because it always
19:39 - happens something always comes up okay
19:42 - um alright so that's pretty much it from
19:45 - get being prepared um if anybody has
19:49 - question
19:50 - like I said you can ask them on the side
19:51 - here or on Kota bowl at credible um on
19:57 - Twitter so let's go over a little bit of
20:00 - what to expect a lot of you said that
20:02 - this is your first time doing hour of
20:04 - code not really sure what to expect uh
20:06 - well it's a lot of fun just expect to
20:10 - have a lot of fun expect to get a lot of
20:13 - questions from your students about you
20:15 - know what a programmer is and and
20:17 - they'll be very interested in games like
20:20 - that that's like the only thing you can
20:22 - do to program you can you know talk with
20:25 - them a little bit about some of the
20:27 - other things that we program I always
20:29 - like to use the example of airplanes
20:31 - because a lot of people don't let of
20:34 - kids and some adults don't realize that
20:36 - there are computers and airplanes I hope
20:39 - pilots fly just examples like that that
20:41 - are real things that they don't they
20:44 - maybe not might not make a connection to
20:46 - the fact that a person has to program it
20:48 - um that's just a nice way to help them
20:51 - see the the broader appeal of
20:55 - programming um and then just you know
21:00 - expect for there to be some issues with
21:03 - technology we all have issues of
21:05 - Technology from time to time so that's
21:07 - why it's important to have a plan B um
21:09 - and just have fun it's a really exciting
21:12 - time be sure to read through everything
21:14 - ahead of time so you know you know you
21:17 - feel confident and prepared but really
21:18 - there's a lot there's not a lot you need
21:20 - to do or need to worry about knowing
21:22 - ahead of time it's it's a really good
21:25 - time to you know just explore and learn
21:27 - with your students um it's a lot of fun
21:30 - I would suggest um having an
21:35 - administrator or another teacher anybody
21:37 - who you feel might be interested in
21:39 - programming or getting more coding at
21:42 - your school have them come by and have
21:44 - them participate because it'll really be
21:47 - nice to be able to talk with them about
21:50 - it later and see about you know how you
21:52 - can do more of these types of things at
21:54 - your school um and so if they see the
21:58 - engagement if they see what happens
22:00 - during the hour of code and how excited
22:01 - kids get and how
22:03 - how much fun it is and how everybody's
22:05 - smiling and having fun and learning all
22:06 - at the same time um that'll be very very
22:10 - powerful later on so I would definitely
22:12 - do all you can to get other parents
22:16 - administrators or other teachers
22:18 - involved and you're going to need a
22:21 - couple extra hands too with that many
22:23 - devices around sure most of you know
22:24 - that so um if you're if you're planning
22:28 - to have an hour code event trying to get
22:30 - parents and administrators and other
22:32 - teachers to come it'll be a lot of fun
22:36 - as usual we get I wanted Activision with
22:41 - technology and then problems that arise
22:44 - make sure you set up code ago added the
22:48 - class codes before the day of because a
22:52 - lot of times we find teachers will will
22:54 - add the class code the day of and
22:55 - realized i forgot their class code and
22:57 - then they've got to go sign in and
22:58 - they're going to find it the best way to
23:00 - do it if you're using co double on an
23:02 - iOS app or as an Android app or on the
23:05 - web entering figure out where your class
23:06 - codes are under the men bookmark those
23:09 - URLs download the classes on the iPad
23:11 - and then all you have to do is we've
23:13 - taken a lot of pains to make it as easy
23:15 - as possible to sign in for kids
23:17 - especially young kids it's I think two
23:19 - or three taps to get a kindergartener
23:22 - into in dakota blue and actually playing
23:25 - usually to make sure that this setup has
23:27 - been done beforehand because if you're
23:28 - trying to get 30 kindergarteners to
23:30 - enter in class codes the day out i'm
23:32 - sure you know it's a little a little
23:33 - stressful that's true yeah definitely
23:36 - but you do have the freedom to make the
23:39 - class code anything you want so if you
23:41 - if you make it something that's really
23:43 - easy like the room number or the name of
23:45 - their school um then then it's pretty
23:48 - easy to get them signed in week out
23:50 - kindergarteners I would I would set it
23:53 - up ahead of time um alright I don't see
23:57 - any questions on Twitter um anybody know
24:04 - alright great so um the next thing that
24:07 - I wanted to go over is on during the
24:11 - lesson so a lot of people asked about
24:14 - whether or not to just get
24:16 - the kids devices and just let them go
24:18 - and I think it's a common misconception
24:20 - that because you're programming you have
24:23 - to have a device in your hand you have
24:25 - to be you have to have technology which
24:27 - makes sense right with program computers
24:30 - but I think it's really important and
24:32 - our curriculum set up this way um I
24:34 - think over half of it is off screen
24:36 - because it's really important to go over
24:40 - a concept and make sure the kids are
24:41 - understanding it a little bit ahead of
24:43 - time just talk a little bit about what
24:45 - the book kept you know talk a little bit
24:47 - about the vocabulary talk about what a
24:48 - programmer is talk about why we need
24:50 - program what is this concept that we're
24:53 - actually learning if you include all of
24:55 - that in the lesson plan so do a little
24:57 - bit of instruction ahead of time so that
24:59 - they know what they're doing and why
25:01 - it's relevant um it's fun you know
25:03 - they're obviously gonna have all gonna
25:05 - have a lot of fun um but it is important
25:08 - to make sure that they make the
25:10 - connection with what they're having fun
25:12 - with and what they're learning uh so so
25:15 - yes I would plan to do a little bit of
25:17 - instruction with them um a few people
25:21 - asked about switching classes so if you
25:23 - have lots of classes coming back and
25:26 - forth or in and out really quickly make
25:29 - sure to have kids log out in the ipad
25:31 - app we had a lot of log out buttons on
25:34 - the pause screen on the main screen or
25:36 - if you just double tap and swipe up on
25:39 - the home button um that will that will
25:42 - log out students so if you can have them
25:45 - all do that before they switch you know
25:47 - like five minutes before it's time to
25:50 - switch just tell the model log out and
25:52 - that will give you once everyone's done
25:53 - if you have a little bit of extra time
25:55 - you can ask some questions about what
25:57 - they learned um and that way when the
26:00 - next group of kids come in everyone's
26:02 - logged out and they can just sign in on
26:04 - their on their profile or create a new
26:07 - one however you're doing it um yeah so
26:11 - that's that's pretty much it for
26:14 - preparation and during the event um and
26:18 - then I wanted to go over after what
26:20 - happens after the our code why are we
26:22 - doing this what what do we what should I
26:25 - expect after this huge event is over
26:28 - what
26:29 - well I think that a lot of people use
26:33 - the hour of code is an opportunity to
26:35 - experiment and decide whether
26:37 - programming is something that they want
26:38 - to do more of at their school so you're
26:42 - not alone there's just about everybody
26:44 - who uses Kota Bowl found out about it
26:46 - during the hour of code and have been
26:48 - using it ever since so um we've set it
26:52 - up to be pretty easy to continue on with
26:54 - it if you do set up classes like I said
26:56 - that's the that's the easiest thing to
26:58 - do if you're playing go on afterward you
27:01 - can view all of our free lesson plans um
27:04 - from your teacher dashboard i'll go
27:07 - ahead and show you that really quickly
27:10 - how to find that so if you go to
27:19 - dashboard code will calm you can log in
27:22 - this is where you login to create your
27:24 - classes and everything um this is what
27:26 - it looks like to create a new class it's
27:28 - very simple um but after the hour of
27:32 - code you can actually go and view all of
27:35 - your students progress you can see what
27:37 - your students completed this class
27:39 - doesn't have any progress you can see
27:42 - what your what concepts your students
27:44 - were learning um who is in progress and
27:47 - who hasn't completed anything you can
27:50 - you can learn a lot about where students
27:54 - are and what you might need to go over a
27:57 - little bit um and then if you want to
27:59 - you can actually go and view our
28:01 - curriculum and set it up and go a little
28:05 - bit more in depth so we have three units
28:09 - for sequence um four units for condition
28:13 - so it's a pretty it's a pretty hefty um
28:15 - thing to get into I'm so go ahead and
28:18 - take a look at it and decide if it's
28:20 - something that you want to go a little
28:21 - bit further with I love this stuff is
28:23 - for a subsequence conditions are both
28:25 - free and then strings which is part of
28:29 - our third grade curriculum is free as
28:32 - well so all of this our curriculum goes
28:35 - k25 so it's something that your school
28:38 - is considering then you can browse
28:40 - through all of this stuff or four
28:42 - and get an idea if it's right for you um
28:46 - say our code is a great way to get
28:48 - started with that um yeah so and then
28:54 - like I said if you're planning to go
28:56 - beyond an hour of code with with
29:01 - programming or wisco tible then having
29:05 - an administrator or a parent or another
29:09 - teacher come with you to the to the
29:12 - first initial you know event the hour of
29:15 - code um having them come and see all of
29:20 - this will really be powerful in making
29:22 - the extra effort to integrate it into
29:25 - fringe lemon to make time for it and
29:27 - you'll just have an ally somebody who
29:29 - has seen the power of what you're trying
29:32 - to do and who can be your teammate and
29:34 - making sure that it all happens and and
29:36 - can do what it takes to make it happen
29:39 - at your school so so yeah um that's
29:42 - pretty much it um got another question
29:45 - oh sure I had one someone was asking if
29:52 - you needed to create your class through
29:54 - the app or if it's done on the website
29:56 - it is that is done through the website
30:00 - so it makes it just makes it really easy
30:02 - um to copy and paste and stuff you can't
30:05 - really do that very easily multitasking
30:07 - is not simple on the icon so yes you
30:10 - have to create it on on the on the
30:14 - website um code volcom in it you can
30:17 - show you where you get signed up you
30:23 - just go to co double calm and and click
30:33 - get started i sign up as a parent or a
30:36 - teacher um that's all it takes it's
30:40 - really simple to get signed in and get
30:42 - started so and then once you have set up
30:44 - your account um once you've set up your
30:48 - account that's all you really need to do
30:50 - on the website you can view the
30:51 - curriculum materials and stuff and you
30:53 - contracts you to progress but all of the
30:55 - actual you know what the students do um
30:58 - that's done through the the web version
31:01 - game code welkom or through the ipad app
31:04 - and that's where they that's sort of
31:07 - their window into kota bowl but there's
31:10 - so much more that's just the tip of the
31:11 - iceberg uh yeah so that's that's just
31:15 - about every things anybody help us some
31:17 - questions I will leave it open for a
31:20 - couple more minutes to see if there's
31:22 - any questions that I didn't answer doo
31:29 - doo doo doo doo doo de doo doo um we're
31:45 - friends Davis said well played co double
31:48 - going web-based and downloadable for
31:51 - hour of code thank you thank you John
31:55 - think about there's a lot of work
31:58 - involved and getting those things out
32:00 - there so we appreciate it um I didn't
32:05 - want to go over playlist while we're
32:07 - waiting for questions to come in I'm
32:09 - just really quickly you can actually set
32:12 - up playlist if you have an account with
32:13 - potable you can set up a playlist that
32:15 - lets you stop students at a certain
32:17 - point so if you're planning on going
32:19 - further later on they will fly through
32:22 - stuff you know kids love games um
32:25 - they'll just keep going and keep going
32:27 - we'll go and download it at home and and
32:29 - then if you were planning lessons you're
32:31 - like oh I have nothing left they've
32:33 - already done it all well you want to
32:34 - make sure that you're doing lessons with
32:36 - them so that they're actually
32:38 - understanding a lot of this stuff and
32:40 - making the connections from the concepts
32:42 - in the game into programming um and so
32:45 - if you're planning on doing that it's
32:47 - nice test set up a playlist and you can
32:50 - set a stopping point for your students
32:51 - um it's really simple i'll go ahead and
32:54 - show you how to do that real quick um i
33:00 - don't see
33:12 - so I'm just gonna go to playlist and it
33:17 - can see I've got my default this is what
33:19 - everybody has when they first sign up
33:20 - for Kota bowl um it's just with
33:23 - everything open and I've created some
33:25 - new ones you can create a new one and
33:28 - just use the default of the template but
33:32 - then once you click on it you can see
33:35 - all of the lessons in co double so this
33:38 - is all of everything all of the
33:40 - different units so right now I've got
33:42 - conditions fuzzy Fiesta hidden for my
33:46 - students so this does not appear on
33:48 - their devices at all I wanted them to
33:50 - skip it i didn't want them to do it so I
33:53 - hid it from them um if I wanted to stop
33:56 - them so what I would suggest feed our
33:57 - code is stopping students before they
33:59 - get to conditions because you want to go
34:01 - over conditions if you can um I would
34:05 - stop them here and I'm going to suck
34:08 - them at the end of debugging secrets um
34:12 - and then still they'll be able to get
34:15 - through all 15 of these levels and then
34:19 - they'll be stopped and they'll get a
34:20 - notification saying that they've been
34:22 - stopped and then that gives you the
34:25 - opportunity to go over things a little
34:27 - bit more so that's a playlist out if you
34:32 - wanted to you could set up one for the
34:34 - our code call it the hour of code you
34:37 - can make as many as you want there's no
34:39 - limit oh and then want to thought there
34:42 - is no limit on classes or students
34:44 - either anymore for free plans the only
34:48 - thing that you're limited to is what
34:50 - curriculum and lessons you have excess
34:52 - access to um so if you have a large
34:55 - school that's want to use it you can go
34:57 - ahead and add them all
35:04 - okay um so Valerie asked if we could
35:07 - through the app and just show you how it
35:09 - works really quickly that's a great
35:11 - suggestion um I can't believe I didn't
35:14 - think about doing that so we'll do that
35:16 - really quickly all right um so I'm going
35:30 - to enter my class code Katniss is my
35:37 - favorite so I'm gonna play as Katniss
35:39 - she's a really good programmer all right
35:44 - and I'm gonna take you all to the very
35:47 - first lesson um so that you can see it
35:51 - so here we've got sequence um oh and
35:55 - actually i'll show you so you know how I
35:57 - I stopped my students after sequence at
36:01 - the end of it you can see conditions is
36:03 - actually your teachers lock this so now
36:05 - they can't they can see it but they just
36:07 - can't get to it um so we'll start at the
36:10 - very first level so we want our fuzz so
36:17 - fuzz's our furry aliens who were
36:19 - exploring space and their UFO crash on
36:22 - this planet called Smee Borg and Smee
36:25 - Borg is covered with mazes and so your
36:27 - students have to program these fuzz's to
36:29 - go through the mazes because buses love
36:32 - to explore they're very very curious so
36:35 - you just drag and drop the commands so
36:38 - we're first we're going to go forward
36:40 - and we're gonna go down and then we're
36:45 - going to go right and then you press
36:50 - play and so your character will roll
36:52 - until they hit a wall alright so it gets
37:04 - um pretty advanced pretty quickly um
37:10 - especially for kindergartners but we've
37:13 - added a lot more extra are a lot of
37:16 - extra see
37:18 - once this concept right here sequence
37:20 - basically just putting things in order
37:22 - to do to do perform at perform an action
37:26 - so we want to get to the end of this
37:28 - maze that's the action that we want to
37:30 - perform so we're going to go um right up
37:33 - right up right and this would be our
37:40 - program so this is our code and with
37:49 - older students you can get into things
37:51 - like conditions loops functions we do
37:54 - that we have that included in our
37:57 - interest in our lesson plans you talked
38:00 - about it a little bit loops and
38:01 - functions are part of the paved portion
38:03 - of kota bowl though so they won't be
38:05 - able to practice it in the game but they
38:07 - can't practice conditions if they want
38:08 - to so that's a little bit about the game
38:20 - Thank some of this here we go all right
38:25 - hope that covers it there's more that
38:28 - you want to see let me know um covered
38:34 - this one Joanie asked about do we need
38:37 - to do it on the app or on the website
38:40 - for creating a class it's the website so
38:43 - that's good um see okay it doesn't look
38:52 - like we have any questions on Twitter um
38:55 - last chance if you have questions i'll
38:58 - type them in I'm going to hang out for
39:01 - another minute or so but I think think
39:03 - we just about covered everything so um
39:05 - if you have more questions feel free to
39:08 - email me or John our email address is
39:12 - Gretchen or John our name atco double
39:16 - com or you can tweet at us at coda bowl
39:20 - we're happy to answer any questions oh
39:23 - we're pretty quick to respond most of
39:25 - the time so if you need anything feel
39:28 - free to ask us as your
39:29 - getting prepared um so thank you
39:32 - everybody is really enjoyed I enjoyed
39:35 - this I always enjoy talking about
39:36 - programming um and I hope you all have a
39:40 - wonderful our code and enjoy it have fun
39:44 - lynn MA

Cleaned transcript:

alright so right here I'm Gretchen this is mike o'connor john and we just wanted to quickly go over what the hour of code is if you guys so that um if you have any questions or if you are not sure what's happening or if this is your first time we can answer all those questions for you so just going to quickly go over everything that you would need to know if you wanted to do an hour of code with Kota Bowl um and then we'll have questions probably somewhere in the middle and then at the end um all right so I'm just gonna tell you guys a little bit about what the hour of code is and why it's important so the hour of code is an event that was organized by Cobourg and CSI week as an opportunity to promote computer science to kids all around the world they want to get as many kids as possible to try at least one hour of code I'm sure that you all know the incredible demand for technical talent people who understand programming who can program or who just can you know use technology successfully so that is the that's the purpose at the hour of code to get more kids aware of what computer science is and why it's important and how it can how they can use it to make change in their communities and in the world so um it's during the second week of December every year to honor grace hopper who was an incredible computer scientist she invented the first compiler which makes it possible for us to program using programming languages she was also the first person to have a bug in her in a program and that was because there was an actual moth in her computer haha so she she coined the term bug um so yeah that's a little bit of fun a little bit of a fun thing to talk with students about so i can share later the link to information about her she's pretty awesome she was an admiral in the US Navy so if you're going to be using co double then it's important to get prepared so I'm going to go over a little bit about everything you should do to prepare for the hour of code and this is in general if you're using anything it'll probably be helpful to do some of these things and then we'll go over what to do during the hour of code know as the events happening what to expect and then if you want to go beyond one hour with your students if you're planning on doing more stuff with your kids later um next semester or even next school year we'll go over some of the stuff that you can do with co double there too so I'm here's the link real quick to Grace Hopper should be able to see it on the side of your screen ok um show item alright great so first we'll go over Kota bowl I'm so quotable is programming curriculum for elementary schools and this year we're doing something we've never done before we're providing lesson plans to everybody great specific lesson plans for the hour of code for free you do not need an account to use these you do not need to pay to use these they're completely free um predominantly unplugged so there's a lot of unplugged options for you this year so i'll go ahead and show you that um real quickly so you can see what they look like um so here are where you can find our lesson plans its code will accomplish our code / lessons and I'll share this link as well but you can see we have K through 5 lesson plans available it's all basically the same but we've scaled it up what lessons you're actually what concepts you're actually covering for each grade level all of these lesson plans can be done in about an hour so you can cut things out if you have a little bit less time but that's building in time for some independent practice on the devices so if you don't have device then you can automatically cut out 10 minutes um so it's pretty fun it's a fun activity where you um get the kids together and you talk about what a programmer is and why they're important and what they do with giving you a lot of that information here and then you have to program someone in the room usually it's helpful if it's an adult because you can tell them ahead of time what they need to do how they need to act as a robot but the students program then to do something so in this activity it's a walk forward turn around and jump and you have to you have to program them to do this and we give you some code in order to do it and and you talk with the students about why that code is important and so it really builds up their understanding of what programming is it gives them a nice real world example a tangible example which is great for I know a lot of you guys mentioned that you're doing this with kindergarteners um it's great for you know pre readers kindergarteners it's nice for them to have like a tangible example of what they're going to be doing um and then after you're finished you can check for understanding and have them go do a little bit of programming on their own on their devices um and like I said there's lesson plans for kindergarten first grade second grade third grade fourth grade fifth grade each of them is slightly different if you have kids who are pretty experience with programming if you guys have been doing this for a while um just jump up probably to the next grade level you know best what's appropriate for your student so I'm just take a look at all of them and decide what you think your students can handle um if you're working with some of you said you were working with middle school students our fifth grade lesson plan is pretty it covers quite a bit so I think that this would easily scale up for sixth and seventh grade students once you're getting into 8th 9th takes you know high school age um then I'm not so sure if you could do it if it's their very first introduction then yeah I think that it would probably be appropriate um so co double is a available desktop iPad web and Android it works on Safari Chrome Internet Explorer Firefox you have to have pretty new versions of these browsers in order for it to work correctly um you need OS X 1.8 at 10.8 sorry Tim point 8 or higher in Windows 7 or higher and then for Android it's 2.3 and iOS is six point 0 or higher um yeah so that's a little bit about the devices um and i'll go ahead and share the activities for you hiya John was saying I've got my nice watch outfit on I'm going to be the Lord Commander you Jon Snow my fur okay so there's that link okay now a few of you are asking questions about whether or not to set up a class and um if that if you think that that would be if we thought that that would be necessary for you for the our code it really depends on what you're trying to do afterward so you think that you are going to be doing a lot of coding after the hour of code if you're planning on making this like a you know something that you do somewhat regularly at your school then I would definitely recommend setting up a class it's just going to make your life a whole lot easier afterward I know that it's a little bit of work up front but it's going to make things a whole lot easier for you so um what you need in order to do that is just a roster of all of your students um it takes just two or three minutes to set up one class you can copy and paste from your roster it's real simple and then after that all the kids need is that class code you can make it whatever you want and they can log in using that class code you can also if you're using the web version you can also bookmark that you have a unique URL so that makes it really easy for the students to get logged in I can actually i'll just show you really quickly how you logged in with a class and then how you would get logged in without a class so the hour of code you're going to want to go to game notable calm our dash of the hash code um if you are not using a class you will play without saving and that just automatically creates an anonymous user you can the kids can play there's like literally no setup um they can hit save and exit and get this student code but you will have to write it down and enter it next time if you want to continue where you left off um if you want to if you want to play with a class code or student code play with class code or student code and then enter the class code and this works the same on the iPad except on the iPad you can save the class code so you don't have to enter it every time here we go so you can see here my students um you just tap that will tap their name on the iPad or they or Android click their name if they're using the web version and then they can continue if you just hit the spaceship it takes you directly to where you left off so it was really nice if you're planning on doing any coding after the hour of code that um you know if you come back after the holiday break and you're ready to get started some of the kids won't remember is that where they were they can just hit play and they'll be safe like all their progress will be saved you'll be able to view their progress on our dashboard there's a lot of extra benefits if this is just a onetime thing that I definitely recommend using just a local profile on your student devices on the iPads or Android devices or just using the play without saving on the web version it will just be super simple for you oh yeah um can you go back to the class overview page listen yeah I just wanted to let everyone know that you could actually bookmark that URL the Garrett calm / class / famous glass for your classes instead of famous class you'll see your class code there but if you're using if you're working with younger kids in kindergarten first grade and they might have trouble typing in their class code you can bookmark those URLs for the students and then if you go there directly you'll immediately get to their class roster and they'll be able to click on their name so you can see there's my famous class now and I can just come directly here um spell yeah that's super simple to if you're using a class code um here's all right um oh I also wanted to let you all know if you're planning on um some things that you want to do if you're getting prepared ahead of time um we have certificates also for students so i'll share that link as well so that when everybody finishes you can just you know sign their names and they've completed an hour of code and that they know I've done an hour of programming their programmers now it's a lot of fun it's all share a link to that as well um but yeah that's a little bit about setting up a class vs not setting up a class it's really your choice we made it pretty easy to do either option it's just a little bit more work if you want to do it ahead of time but it will save you in the long run if you want to not set up a class and then import students you can do that like after say you try this out and then later on you want to continue with it you can have those student codes you write down and you can import them but it gets a little bit tedious you did know think about just doing that for 25 students so be kind of a pain but um but yeah saving saving you a little bit of time is doing a little bit of work up front so um I guess I'm gonna see if we've got any questions on Twitter um no it doesn't look like it you guys can also add questions on the side here so we have questions okay what is a quick way to bookmark when using iPad so if you are going to be using co double on an iPad um i would suggest well you have to download the app in order to use it um so then just go over with students before you get started what the icon looks like um it's the same as our Google+ and YouTube and all of our social media icons it's just a gold square where the blue fuzz on the front um go over that with students say okay whatever we're going to go to go to this one this is co dab'll then that that makes it really easy to know exactly where to go on the iPad if you do set up a class then once you enter that class code one time it'll be saved on the iPad so you never have to enter it again they just go over what your class name is um you can make it whatever you want say you can always make it something that the students will remember they just tap on that and then they tap their name very similar to what happens on the web version um and okay got it I selected this question no it's answered okay oh that is here's your question Valerie if it doesn't let me know okay um so if anybody else has questions feel free to put them here I'm happy to answer them um so let's go over a little bit of where to get the different versions of koda bolt so we have an hour of code page setup where you can find all of the stuff that I'm sharing here um go ahead and share that it's co double com / our dash of dash code and that has all of this it has links to download everything um it has links to the web version it has linked to our unplugged activities as links to the what up to the certificate and to our lesson plans so you can find everything that you need here i'll go ahead and show it to you real quick alright so you can see a lesson plans page alright hour of code um so here's where kids can get started I think it's probably easier for you less distractions on this page if you just bookmark the page that we talked about game not co double calm um but you can also have them play here it'll take them directly to it um and then this is where you can find the lesson plans and here's where you can find where to download or set up everything so we better pc version mac web ipad android and unplugged um you can share quotable and then here's a link to these certificates to download for your students and this is co double calm / hour of codes i just shared it on the side here um so that's just about everything you need in order to get set up um if you if you have any questions feel free to post them on the side here um okay good great alright so let's see during the day up so one thing to consider if you're planning an hour of code for no matter what you're planning on using what it's quotable anything else um code.org might find anything i would definitely recommend having a plan B so everybody's servers get hit pretty hard um but everyone servers get hit pretty hard and so there might be a little bit of spotty service ours are set up in a way that is very very unlikely for you to see any issues with loading times or anything like that um we scale it pretty well so I don't expect to have any trouble if you're using the eye version on the android version or the desktop version that's irrelevant there will be any issues with Internet connectivity there and if you you asked about saving progress on those versions you'd actually don't need internet to use them um it'll just save eventually like the next time yeah the device connects to the Internet it'll save their progress up that way so there's no need to have internet for those versions for the web version obviously you have to have the Internet um but yeah there shouldn't be any trouble with with our servers that did that week but it's always important to have a plan B so um we have quite a few i plug lesson plans available we have the fuzz family frenzy which is a lot of fun you have kids pick a partner so after you go over like what a programmer is and you program someone at front of the room together and then you can have them break up into pairs and they have to program a partner to go through an obstacle course some people have used toilet paper to set up mazes in their gym which is really cool idea people have just had them go from one end of the classroom to the other some people go out to the playground and have them hula hoop and it's just a lot of fun you can use whatever resources you have available around you um but uh but that's a really good resource salt be sure to share that with you guys um and this is in our curriculum as well as if you have Co dab'll um you have access to this on your teacher dashboard also it's the fuzz family friends e so this is a really good plan B if anything goes wrong or say like one of your devices just decides not to work um that day that happens just have a plan B no matter what it is even if it's not the fuzz family frenzy have a plan B just in case things go awry because it always happens something always comes up okay um alright so that's pretty much it from get being prepared um if anybody has question like I said you can ask them on the side here or on Kota bowl at credible um on Twitter so let's go over a little bit of what to expect a lot of you said that this is your first time doing hour of code not really sure what to expect uh well it's a lot of fun just expect to have a lot of fun expect to get a lot of questions from your students about you know what a programmer is and and they'll be very interested in games like that that's like the only thing you can do to program you can you know talk with them a little bit about some of the other things that we program I always like to use the example of airplanes because a lot of people don't let of kids and some adults don't realize that there are computers and airplanes I hope pilots fly just examples like that that are real things that they don't they maybe not might not make a connection to the fact that a person has to program it um that's just a nice way to help them see the the broader appeal of programming um and then just you know expect for there to be some issues with technology we all have issues of Technology from time to time so that's why it's important to have a plan B um and just have fun it's a really exciting time be sure to read through everything ahead of time so you know you know you feel confident and prepared but really there's a lot there's not a lot you need to do or need to worry about knowing ahead of time it's it's a really good time to you know just explore and learn with your students um it's a lot of fun I would suggest um having an administrator or another teacher anybody who you feel might be interested in programming or getting more coding at your school have them come by and have them participate because it'll really be nice to be able to talk with them about it later and see about you know how you can do more of these types of things at your school um and so if they see the engagement if they see what happens during the hour of code and how excited kids get and how how much fun it is and how everybody's smiling and having fun and learning all at the same time um that'll be very very powerful later on so I would definitely do all you can to get other parents administrators or other teachers involved and you're going to need a couple extra hands too with that many devices around sure most of you know that so um if you're if you're planning to have an hour code event trying to get parents and administrators and other teachers to come it'll be a lot of fun as usual we get I wanted Activision with technology and then problems that arise make sure you set up code ago added the class codes before the day of because a lot of times we find teachers will will add the class code the day of and realized i forgot their class code and then they've got to go sign in and they're going to find it the best way to do it if you're using co double on an iOS app or as an Android app or on the web entering figure out where your class codes are under the men bookmark those URLs download the classes on the iPad and then all you have to do is we've taken a lot of pains to make it as easy as possible to sign in for kids especially young kids it's I think two or three taps to get a kindergartener into in dakota blue and actually playing usually to make sure that this setup has been done beforehand because if you're trying to get 30 kindergarteners to enter in class codes the day out i'm sure you know it's a little a little stressful that's true yeah definitely but you do have the freedom to make the class code anything you want so if you if you make it something that's really easy like the room number or the name of their school um then then it's pretty easy to get them signed in week out kindergarteners I would I would set it up ahead of time um alright I don't see any questions on Twitter um anybody know alright great so um the next thing that I wanted to go over is on during the lesson so a lot of people asked about whether or not to just get the kids devices and just let them go and I think it's a common misconception that because you're programming you have to have a device in your hand you have to be you have to have technology which makes sense right with program computers but I think it's really important and our curriculum set up this way um I think over half of it is off screen because it's really important to go over a concept and make sure the kids are understanding it a little bit ahead of time just talk a little bit about what the book kept you know talk a little bit about the vocabulary talk about what a programmer is talk about why we need program what is this concept that we're actually learning if you include all of that in the lesson plan so do a little bit of instruction ahead of time so that they know what they're doing and why it's relevant um it's fun you know they're obviously gonna have all gonna have a lot of fun um but it is important to make sure that they make the connection with what they're having fun with and what they're learning uh so so yes I would plan to do a little bit of instruction with them um a few people asked about switching classes so if you have lots of classes coming back and forth or in and out really quickly make sure to have kids log out in the ipad app we had a lot of log out buttons on the pause screen on the main screen or if you just double tap and swipe up on the home button um that will that will log out students so if you can have them all do that before they switch you know like five minutes before it's time to switch just tell the model log out and that will give you once everyone's done if you have a little bit of extra time you can ask some questions about what they learned um and that way when the next group of kids come in everyone's logged out and they can just sign in on their on their profile or create a new one however you're doing it um yeah so that's that's pretty much it for preparation and during the event um and then I wanted to go over after what happens after the our code why are we doing this what what do we what should I expect after this huge event is over what well I think that a lot of people use the hour of code is an opportunity to experiment and decide whether programming is something that they want to do more of at their school so you're not alone there's just about everybody who uses Kota Bowl found out about it during the hour of code and have been using it ever since so um we've set it up to be pretty easy to continue on with it if you do set up classes like I said that's the that's the easiest thing to do if you're playing go on afterward you can view all of our free lesson plans um from your teacher dashboard i'll go ahead and show you that really quickly how to find that so if you go to dashboard code will calm you can log in this is where you login to create your classes and everything um this is what it looks like to create a new class it's very simple um but after the hour of code you can actually go and view all of your students progress you can see what your students completed this class doesn't have any progress you can see what your what concepts your students were learning um who is in progress and who hasn't completed anything you can you can learn a lot about where students are and what you might need to go over a little bit um and then if you want to you can actually go and view our curriculum and set it up and go a little bit more in depth so we have three units for sequence um four units for condition so it's a pretty it's a pretty hefty um thing to get into I'm so go ahead and take a look at it and decide if it's something that you want to go a little bit further with I love this stuff is for a subsequence conditions are both free and then strings which is part of our third grade curriculum is free as well so all of this our curriculum goes k25 so it's something that your school is considering then you can browse through all of this stuff or four and get an idea if it's right for you um say our code is a great way to get started with that um yeah so and then like I said if you're planning to go beyond an hour of code with with programming or wisco tible then having an administrator or a parent or another teacher come with you to the to the first initial you know event the hour of code um having them come and see all of this will really be powerful in making the extra effort to integrate it into fringe lemon to make time for it and you'll just have an ally somebody who has seen the power of what you're trying to do and who can be your teammate and making sure that it all happens and and can do what it takes to make it happen at your school so so yeah um that's pretty much it um got another question oh sure I had one someone was asking if you needed to create your class through the app or if it's done on the website it is that is done through the website so it makes it just makes it really easy um to copy and paste and stuff you can't really do that very easily multitasking is not simple on the icon so yes you have to create it on on the on the website um code volcom in it you can show you where you get signed up you just go to co double calm and and click get started i sign up as a parent or a teacher um that's all it takes it's really simple to get signed in and get started so and then once you have set up your account um once you've set up your account that's all you really need to do on the website you can view the curriculum materials and stuff and you contracts you to progress but all of the actual you know what the students do um that's done through the the web version game code welkom or through the ipad app and that's where they that's sort of their window into kota bowl but there's so much more that's just the tip of the iceberg uh yeah so that's that's just about every things anybody help us some questions I will leave it open for a couple more minutes to see if there's any questions that I didn't answer doo doo doo doo doo doo de doo doo um we're friends Davis said well played co double going webbased and downloadable for hour of code thank you thank you John think about there's a lot of work involved and getting those things out there so we appreciate it um I didn't want to go over playlist while we're waiting for questions to come in I'm just really quickly you can actually set up playlist if you have an account with potable you can set up a playlist that lets you stop students at a certain point so if you're planning on going further later on they will fly through stuff you know kids love games um they'll just keep going and keep going we'll go and download it at home and and then if you were planning lessons you're like oh I have nothing left they've already done it all well you want to make sure that you're doing lessons with them so that they're actually understanding a lot of this stuff and making the connections from the concepts in the game into programming um and so if you're planning on doing that it's nice test set up a playlist and you can set a stopping point for your students um it's really simple i'll go ahead and show you how to do that real quick um i don't see so I'm just gonna go to playlist and it can see I've got my default this is what everybody has when they first sign up for Kota bowl um it's just with everything open and I've created some new ones you can create a new one and just use the default of the template but then once you click on it you can see all of the lessons in co double so this is all of everything all of the different units so right now I've got conditions fuzzy Fiesta hidden for my students so this does not appear on their devices at all I wanted them to skip it i didn't want them to do it so I hid it from them um if I wanted to stop them so what I would suggest feed our code is stopping students before they get to conditions because you want to go over conditions if you can um I would stop them here and I'm going to suck them at the end of debugging secrets um and then still they'll be able to get through all 15 of these levels and then they'll be stopped and they'll get a notification saying that they've been stopped and then that gives you the opportunity to go over things a little bit more so that's a playlist out if you wanted to you could set up one for the our code call it the hour of code you can make as many as you want there's no limit oh and then want to thought there is no limit on classes or students either anymore for free plans the only thing that you're limited to is what curriculum and lessons you have excess access to um so if you have a large school that's want to use it you can go ahead and add them all okay um so Valerie asked if we could through the app and just show you how it works really quickly that's a great suggestion um I can't believe I didn't think about doing that so we'll do that really quickly all right um so I'm going to enter my class code Katniss is my favorite so I'm gonna play as Katniss she's a really good programmer all right and I'm gonna take you all to the very first lesson um so that you can see it so here we've got sequence um oh and actually i'll show you so you know how I I stopped my students after sequence at the end of it you can see conditions is actually your teachers lock this so now they can't they can see it but they just can't get to it um so we'll start at the very first level so we want our fuzz so fuzz's our furry aliens who were exploring space and their UFO crash on this planet called Smee Borg and Smee Borg is covered with mazes and so your students have to program these fuzz's to go through the mazes because buses love to explore they're very very curious so you just drag and drop the commands so we're first we're going to go forward and we're gonna go down and then we're going to go right and then you press play and so your character will roll until they hit a wall alright so it gets um pretty advanced pretty quickly um especially for kindergartners but we've added a lot more extra are a lot of extra see once this concept right here sequence basically just putting things in order to do to do perform at perform an action so we want to get to the end of this maze that's the action that we want to perform so we're going to go um right up right up right and this would be our program so this is our code and with older students you can get into things like conditions loops functions we do that we have that included in our interest in our lesson plans you talked about it a little bit loops and functions are part of the paved portion of kota bowl though so they won't be able to practice it in the game but they can't practice conditions if they want to so that's a little bit about the game Thank some of this here we go all right hope that covers it there's more that you want to see let me know um covered this one Joanie asked about do we need to do it on the app or on the website for creating a class it's the website so that's good um see okay it doesn't look like we have any questions on Twitter um last chance if you have questions i'll type them in I'm going to hang out for another minute or so but I think think we just about covered everything so um if you have more questions feel free to email me or John our email address is Gretchen or John our name atco double com or you can tweet at us at coda bowl we're happy to answer any questions oh we're pretty quick to respond most of the time so if you need anything feel free to ask us as your getting prepared um so thank you everybody is really enjoyed I enjoyed this I always enjoy talking about programming um and I hope you all have a wonderful our code and enjoy it have fun lynn MA
