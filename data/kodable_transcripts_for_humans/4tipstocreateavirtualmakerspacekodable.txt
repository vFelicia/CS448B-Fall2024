00:00 - [Music]
00:05 - hello all
00:06 - welcome back to the codable universe if
00:08 - you're new here my name is hannah
00:10 - i'm the instructional designer and coach
00:12 - at codable
00:13 - we are working to bring high quality and
00:15 - fun computer science education to
00:17 - every k5 student on this channel we post
00:20 - tons of
00:21 - animated video lessons that teach
00:23 - students coding basics
00:24 - but today we're going to do something a
00:26 - little different this is the first
00:27 - episode of a new series that i will be
00:29 - hosting on this channel
00:31 - where i hop on here and we chat about
00:33 - questions
00:34 - concerns wonderings or ideas that you
00:38 - have
00:38 - about teaching elementary computer
00:40 - science each episode will be a little
00:42 - bit different depending on
00:44 - what you guys are interested in so i
00:45 - definitely want to hear from you in the
00:47 - comments if you have ideas for topics
00:49 - you'd like to see covered
00:50 - for example i might break down a recent
00:52 - article that i find interesting
00:54 - offer different instructional tips and
00:56 - tricks share an interview
00:58 - with a teacher or provide direct
01:00 - resources the ultimate goal here is to
01:02 - get you the tools that you need to bring
01:04 - all things stem to your elementary
01:06 - students
01:07 - regardless of your background or if you
01:09 - have experience with
01:11 - science technology engineering and math
01:14 - for yourself i'm really excited about
01:16 - today's video because we are going to
01:18 - kick it off with one of my most
01:19 - favorite topics that has definitely
01:21 - gotten an overhaul in 2020
01:23 - and that is maker makerspaces in today's
01:26 - video we're going to go over
01:28 - four tips for creating your first
01:30 - virtual
01:31 - makerspace virtual makerspace if you're
01:34 - excited to learn more and you enjoy this
01:36 - video while you're watching
01:37 - please be sure to give us a thumbs up
01:39 - and click the subscribe button
01:40 - so you don't miss more videos like this
01:42 - one all right enough rambling let's get
01:44 - into it
01:45 - so let's start with the basics what is a
01:47 - makerspace
01:48 - a makerspace is exactly like it sounds
01:51 - it is
01:52 - a space in a school or a library
01:55 - museum or some other setting where
01:58 - participants
01:59 - can make things it's a makerspace
02:02 - some makerspaces have high-tech tools
02:05 - like
02:05 - 3d printers laser cutters soldering
02:08 - tools
02:10 - sewing machines that participants can
02:12 - use to
02:13 - make things but it really doesn't need
02:16 - all of these high-tech machines
02:17 - or really any machine for it to be
02:20 - considered a makerspace
02:21 - if you have cardboard legos tape
02:25 - art supplies then you're on your way you
02:27 - can totally put together a makerspace
02:29 - it's more about the maker mindset this
02:32 - idea of
02:33 - creating something out of nothing and
02:36 - getting to choose what you're working on
02:38 - those are the things that are at the
02:39 - core definition of a makerspace
02:42 - in an education setting like a school
02:44 - maker spaces provide
02:46 - students with the opportunity to create
02:48 - hands-on projects
02:50 - of their choice so let's talk benefits
02:53 - there are
02:53 - tons of benefits to teaching in a maker
02:56 - space
02:57 - young children construct their knowledge
02:59 - of the world around them
03:00 - through everyday experiences they learn
03:02 - by doing
03:03 - by asking questions and seeking the
03:06 - answers through experimentation
03:08 - this is why makerspaces are such a
03:10 - powerful
03:11 - educational environment they provide
03:13 - students with this
03:15 - opportunity to practice the four c's
03:17 - that are so
03:18 - sought after in 21st century schooling
03:21 - so if you don't know the four c's are
03:23 - critical thinking creativity
03:25 - collaboration
03:26 - and communication but beyond the four
03:29 - c's
03:30 - maker spaces are an awesome learning
03:32 - environment
03:33 - to learn so many other 21st century
03:35 - skills like problem solving
03:37 - and self-confidence basically maker
03:40 - spaces are awesome
03:41 - it's why i'm so passionate about them
03:42 - but i know a lot of teachers are
03:44 - unsure how to get started with the
03:46 - makerspace and especially in 2020 how to
03:49 - move it online so that's what we're
03:51 - going to talk about here
03:52 - like i mentioned there are tons of types
03:54 - of makerspaces
03:55 - some of them are bananas so i'll show
03:58 - you some examples there's fab
04:00 - labs which are like those high-tech
04:01 - maker spaces i was talking about with
04:03 - the 3d printers and the laser cutters
04:05 - there's arts and crafts based maker
04:07 - spaces that are a lot more accessible to
04:09 - teachers so that's probably what you've
04:11 - seen in schools or museums that include
04:14 - hands-on art materials like tape and
04:16 - cardboard
04:17 - where participants can construct and
04:19 - make projects there's also wood and
04:21 - metal workshops there's
04:22 - um hacker what's the word
04:26 - like hacker spaces where all the making
04:29 - is done
04:30 - via computing so there's tons of options
04:32 - my personal experience with makerspaces
04:35 - i used to work at a children's science
04:36 - and art museum where i would teach
04:38 - camps and classes in an early childhood
04:41 - fab lab
04:42 - so this was a building that had high
04:44 - tech tools like a 3d printer
04:46 - some laser cutters a screen printing
04:49 - contraption
04:50 - in a learning environment meant for kids
04:53 - who were 2 to 10 years old so when i
04:56 - hear makerspace that's what i think of
04:58 - but in 2020 the maker space has gotten a
05:01 - total
05:02 - makeover what we have historically
05:04 - associated with maker spaces like
05:06 - hands-on learning collaboration those
05:09 - are things that have been a lot more
05:10 - difficult
05:11 - to do safely it's just not accessible
05:14 - right now
05:15 - so teachers being the brilliant
05:17 - innovators that they are
05:19 - have adapted and they've created the
05:21 - virtual makerspace
05:22 - so how does this work in a virtual
05:25 - setting a makerspace is going to look a
05:27 - lot like a choice board
05:28 - um if you haven't seen what a choice
05:30 - board is these are any
05:32 - web-based platform that students can go
05:34 - to and choose
05:36 - from a collection of activities or
05:38 - projects
05:39 - choices could be to read to go outside
05:42 - to do a science project
05:44 - to write to do art things like that
05:46 - choice boards are awesome
05:48 - because they allow the child to choose
05:50 - what they're interested in and direct
05:52 - their own learning
05:53 - so a virtual maker space is going to be
05:55 - pretty similar to a choice board
05:57 - except all the options that are on the
06:00 - platform
06:01 - ask you to make something you keep all
06:03 - the same principles that you would in a
06:05 - physical
06:06 - maker space but you move it online great
06:09 - it sounds so easy
06:10 - how do i do that so i'm no longer
06:12 - teaching i'm working at codable
06:14 - full-time
06:15 - so to get inside the mind of a teacher
06:17 - and learn
06:18 - some first-hand tips we talked to
06:20 - shannon miller who is a district
06:22 - teacher librarian and innovation
06:24 - director of library and technology in
06:27 - iowa
06:27 - she works with get this 950
06:32 - students grades pre-k
06:35 - through 12th grade so you better believe
06:38 - that she knows what she's talking about
06:40 - i'll link her social media in the
06:41 - description box below so you can check
06:43 - out some of the work that she's doing
06:44 - she is awesome and she actually has a
06:46 - pre-made virtual
06:48 - makerspace that you can take and change
06:51 - and modify to fit the needs of your
06:53 - class it's made with google slides and
06:55 - i'll link it in the description box
06:56 - below too but that's available to you
06:58 - right now
06:59 - if you want some sort of jumping off
07:01 - place for the virtual maker space
07:02 - i am going to use this example as i go
07:05 - through her tips for creating one
07:07 - yourself
07:07 - so here is her makerspace and now let's
07:09 - talk about shannon's four tips for
07:11 - creating your own virtual maker space
07:14 - step one think carefully about how the
07:17 - activities are
07:18 - organized it's great if the maker space
07:21 - is
07:21 - inviting and interesting to look at but
07:24 - more importantly it has to be
07:25 - easy to understand so you can see in
07:28 - shannon's example she organizes all the
07:30 - projects and activities by
07:33 - subject this makes a lot of sense to me
07:35 - because whether she has a kindergartner
07:37 - or a 12th grader accessing this maker
07:39 - space
07:40 - most kids organize their school day by
07:42 - the different subjects or classes that
07:44 - they're going to
07:45 - so in a virtual maker space if the
07:47 - activities are organized that way
07:48 - it'll make sense to the student it seems
07:51 - like such an easy tip
07:52 - but it makes a huge difference if kids
07:54 - understand how the maker space
07:56 - is laid out and organized they're not
07:58 - going to waste time
07:59 - trying to figure out the format and what
08:02 - each column means
08:03 - they're going to be able to go straight
08:05 - to the activity and the subject matter
08:07 - that they're interested in
08:08 - and not waste time trying just trying to
08:10 - figure out what they're looking at
08:12 - step two you'll want to include things
08:14 - that students are familiar with
08:16 - but also some new things so what this
08:19 - means
08:19 - is when your kids first look at the
08:21 - virtual maker space
08:23 - it might feel really new to them if this
08:25 - is something that you haven't done a lot
08:26 - in the past
08:28 - they're going to want to see topics
08:30 - subjects or activities that they've seen
08:32 - before
08:33 - to kind of ease them a little bit to
08:34 - help them realize that this doesn't need
08:36 - to be like a scary
08:38 - scary shift or anything that there's
08:41 - things there that they know
08:42 - that they will be successful doing that
08:44 - said you don't
08:46 - only want the content matter in your
08:48 - virtual makerspace to be
08:50 - the kids have already done or mastered
08:52 - in the past the incredible thing about
08:54 - maker spaces is that it allows kids to
08:57 - learn
08:58 - by doing like we mentioned earlier it
09:00 - allows them to learn through
09:01 - experimentation
09:02 - and if they've already mastered a bunch
09:04 - of content
09:06 - there isn't that much to gain in the
09:08 - virtual maker space by
09:09 - redoing that same content which is why
09:12 - shannon recommends
09:13 - adding some new topics in there some new
09:16 - activities that maybe they've never seen
09:18 - before even new subject matter
09:20 - to see if they choose to
09:23 - experiment and if they do then there's a
09:25 - lot of learning opportunities there for
09:27 - example
09:28 - shannon shared that a lot of the
09:30 - teachers that she has worked with
09:32 - include coding as an option in their
09:34 - virtual maker spaces coding is something
09:36 - that is not taught in every school
09:38 - but has a big impact in helping students
09:42 - develop
09:42 - creative problem-solving skills
09:44 - resilience and logical reasoning
09:46 - so yeah don't be afraid to include
09:49 - topics that
09:50 - might be brand new to your students
09:51 - because that's how they'll learn the
09:52 - most
09:53 - step three keep it fresh as we mentioned
09:56 - you want the content in your makerspace
09:58 - to be
09:58 - organized in a way that's easy to
10:00 - understand but you don't want it to get
10:02 - stale
10:03 - this is actually one of the best things
10:05 - about a virtual makerspace i think
10:07 - and is actually a huge benefit over a
10:10 - physical makerspace is that
10:12 - if you created your makerspace online
10:14 - you can change your offerings
10:16 - all the time you might realize that one
10:19 - project that you posted is not really
10:21 - popular with your students they're not
10:23 - excited about it they're not completing
10:24 - it
10:25 - get rid of it you can switch it up you
10:27 - can add something else in there to test
10:29 - out if that would work better
10:30 - it's a way for you to make sure that the
10:32 - content you're providing for students
10:34 - is the best content for them and also it
10:37 - keeps it interactive and fun and
10:38 - interesting
10:39 - your students will log on to their
10:41 - virtual maker space excited to see
10:43 - something new that they haven't tried
10:45 - before so as shannon says
10:47 - keep it fresh and step four this is the
10:49 - step that shannon says
10:51 - is one of the most important when
10:53 - creating your own virtual maker space
10:55 - listen to your students you are the
10:57 - expert you know your students the best
10:59 - if you listen to what they're interested
11:01 - in
11:01 - you can tie that into the makerspace
11:04 - offerings
11:05 - there should be a relationship between
11:07 - your kids and your makerspace curriculum
11:10 - you can ask yourself do my students see
11:13 - themselves reflected
11:14 - in these projects are these issues that
11:17 - they care about
11:18 - are they interesting to them when my
11:20 - students work on these activities
11:22 - do they see themselves as powerful
11:24 - change makers in the world
11:26 - this is one of the reasons why i'm so
11:28 - passionate and why i love
11:29 - coding and computer science as an option
11:32 - in your virtual makerspace
11:34 - because we've seen it this year more
11:36 - than ever technology
11:37 - is changing the world and we do interact
11:40 - with it
11:41 - every single day especially during
11:43 - virtual learning
11:44 - to offer something like coding and
11:46 - computer science in your virtual maker
11:48 - space
11:49 - will help kids make a connection between
11:52 - what is going on in their everyday life
11:54 - and what they're learning in school even
11:56 - our youngest students can play a role in
11:59 - changing the world when they learn
12:00 - computer science at a young age
12:02 - so listen to them what is relevant in
12:04 - their lives and
12:05 - make sure that that is reflected in your
12:07 - maker space as well okay
12:08 - this is the last thing that i'll talk
12:10 - about before we wrap it up and
12:12 - i i thought it was really important to
12:14 - include if you were to google
12:16 - virtual makerspace or choice boards
12:20 - or even looking at shannon's version of
12:22 - her virtual maker space
12:23 - looking at any of these examples they
12:25 - are what i would call
12:26 - pinterest worthy this means that they
12:29 - look amazing they have artistic
12:32 - flourishes
12:33 - and it's clear that a lot of time went
12:35 - into
12:36 - creating the aesthetic that you actually
12:38 - see when you open the makerspace
12:40 - having it be warm and inviting and
12:44 - interesting when you first open it
12:46 - is a huge plus but i want to make sure
12:49 - that
12:49 - before i wrap this video up i tell you
12:51 - that it's not
12:52 - required if you look at these examples
12:55 - and you think to yourself
12:56 - oh gosh i am not tech savvy
12:59 - i'm i'm not artistic my maker space or
13:02 - my choice board that i put together is
13:04 - not gonna look
13:05 - like these examples that i see on
13:07 - pinterest
13:09 - that is okay it is much more important
13:12 - in my opinion to make sure that the
13:14 - activities that you're linking to
13:16 - are awesome and the aesthetic how it
13:20 - looks
13:21 - can come second because at the end of
13:23 - the day our students are going to learn
13:26 - by doing the activities they're going to
13:28 - learn by clicking the link
13:30 - and following the instructions they're
13:31 - not going to learn
13:33 - just from looking at the makerspace
13:35 - itself they have to dive in
13:37 - and do the projects so that's why i just
13:39 - wanted to emphasize
13:41 - picking the right projects that are
13:43 - relevant for your students lives
13:45 - over spending a ton of time making sure
13:48 - it looks
13:49 - beautiful again both are important but
13:51 - don't lose sight of
13:52 - where the learning is happening because
13:54 - we're all new to this
13:55 - there is no best practices for
13:58 - virtual maker spaces yet because it's
14:01 - all so new
14:02 - please do not think that some of the
14:04 - examples that you see online
14:05 - are the template that you must use to
14:08 - create your virtual maker space
14:10 - make it your own you might have a
14:11 - completely different idea
14:13 - that works a lot better for your
14:15 - students so i hope that makes sense that
14:17 - is about it
14:18 - for our first episode of
14:21 - insert the name that i come up with for
14:23 - the series that i haven't thought of yet
14:24 - if you have any ideas
14:26 - for what this series could be called
14:27 - where i offer tips and tricks like this
14:29 - leave it in the comments below
14:31 - i'd love to get some perspective from
14:33 - the community that's actually going to
14:35 - be watching these videos
14:36 - i really hope you found this video
14:38 - helpful make sure that you like the
14:39 - video if you enjoyed it and you
14:41 - subscribe to our channel so you don't
14:42 - miss the next one i'll see you next time
14:45 - [Music]
14:54 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello all welcome back to the codable universe if you're new here my name is hannah i'm the instructional designer and coach at codable we are working to bring high quality and fun computer science education to every k5 student on this channel we post tons of animated video lessons that teach students coding basics but today we're going to do something a little different this is the first episode of a new series that i will be hosting on this channel where i hop on here and we chat about questions concerns wonderings or ideas that you have about teaching elementary computer science each episode will be a little bit different depending on what you guys are interested in so i definitely want to hear from you in the comments if you have ideas for topics you'd like to see covered for example i might break down a recent article that i find interesting offer different instructional tips and tricks share an interview with a teacher or provide direct resources the ultimate goal here is to get you the tools that you need to bring all things stem to your elementary students regardless of your background or if you have experience with science technology engineering and math for yourself i'm really excited about today's video because we are going to kick it off with one of my most favorite topics that has definitely gotten an overhaul in 2020 and that is maker makerspaces in today's video we're going to go over four tips for creating your first virtual makerspace virtual makerspace if you're excited to learn more and you enjoy this video while you're watching please be sure to give us a thumbs up and click the subscribe button so you don't miss more videos like this one all right enough rambling let's get into it so let's start with the basics what is a makerspace a makerspace is exactly like it sounds it is a space in a school or a library museum or some other setting where participants can make things it's a makerspace some makerspaces have hightech tools like 3d printers laser cutters soldering tools sewing machines that participants can use to make things but it really doesn't need all of these hightech machines or really any machine for it to be considered a makerspace if you have cardboard legos tape art supplies then you're on your way you can totally put together a makerspace it's more about the maker mindset this idea of creating something out of nothing and getting to choose what you're working on those are the things that are at the core definition of a makerspace in an education setting like a school maker spaces provide students with the opportunity to create handson projects of their choice so let's talk benefits there are tons of benefits to teaching in a maker space young children construct their knowledge of the world around them through everyday experiences they learn by doing by asking questions and seeking the answers through experimentation this is why makerspaces are such a powerful educational environment they provide students with this opportunity to practice the four c's that are so sought after in 21st century schooling so if you don't know the four c's are critical thinking creativity collaboration and communication but beyond the four c's maker spaces are an awesome learning environment to learn so many other 21st century skills like problem solving and selfconfidence basically maker spaces are awesome it's why i'm so passionate about them but i know a lot of teachers are unsure how to get started with the makerspace and especially in 2020 how to move it online so that's what we're going to talk about here like i mentioned there are tons of types of makerspaces some of them are bananas so i'll show you some examples there's fab labs which are like those hightech maker

teach camps and classes in an early childhood fab lab so this was a building that had high tech tools like a 3d printer some laser cutters a screen printing contraption in a learning environment meant for kids who were 2 to 10 years old so when i hear makerspace that's what i think of but in 2020 the maker space has gotten a total makeover what we have historically associated with maker spaces like handson learning collaboration those are things that have been a lot more difficult to do safely it's just not accessible right now so teachers being the brilliant innovators that they are have adapted and they've created the virtual makerspace so how does this work in a virtual setting a makerspace is going to look a lot like a choice board um if you haven't seen what a choice board is these are any webbased platform that students can go to and choose from a collection of activities or projects choices could be to read to go outside to do a science project to write to do art things like that choice boards are awesome because they allow the child to choose what they're interested in and direct their own learning so a virtual maker space is going to be pretty similar to a choice board except all the options that are on the platform ask you to make something you keep all the same principles that you would in a physical maker space but you move it online great it sounds so easy how do i do that so i'm no longer teaching i'm working at codable fulltime so to get inside the mind of a teacher and learn some firsthand tips we talked to shannon miller who is a district teacher librarian and innovation director of library and technology in iowa she works with get this 950 students grades prek through 12th grade so you better believe that she knows what she's talking about i'll link her social media in the description box below so you can check out some of the work that she's doing she is awesome and she actually has a premade virtual makerspace that you can take and change and modify to fit the needs of your class it's made with google slides and i'll link it in the description box below too but that's available to you right now if you want some sort of jumping off place for the virtual maker space i am going to use this example as i go through her tips for creating one yourself so here is her makerspace and now let's talk about shannon's four tips for creating your own virtual maker space step one think carefully about how the activities are organized it's great if the maker space is inviting and interesting to look at but more importantly it has to be easy to understand so you can see in shannon's example she organizes all the projects and activities by subject this makes a lot of sense to me because whether she has a kindergartner or a 12th grader accessing this maker space most kids organize their school day by the different subjects or classes that they're going to so in a virtual maker space if the activities are organized that way it'll make sense to the student it seems like such an easy tip but it makes a huge difference if kids understand how the maker space is laid out and organized they're not going to waste time trying to figure out the format and what each column means they're going to be able to go straight to the activity and the subject matter that they're interested in and not waste time trying just trying to figure out what they're looking at step two you'll want to include things that students are familiar with but also some new things so what this means is when your kids first look at the virtual maker space it might feel really new to them if this is something that you haven't done a lot in the past they're going to want to see topics subjects or activities that they've seen before to kind of ease them a little bit to help them realize that this doesn't need to be like a scary scary shift or anything that there's things there that they know that they will be successful doing that said you don't only want the content matter in your virtual makerspace to be the kids have already done or mastered in the past the incredible thing about maker spaces is that it allows kids to learn by doing like we mentioned earlier it allows them to learn through experimentation and if they've already mastered a bunch of content there isn't that much to gain in the virtual maker space by redoing that same content which is why shannon recommends adding some new topics in there some new activities that maybe they've never seen before even new subject matter to see if they choose to experiment and if they do then there's a lot of learning opportunities there for example shannon shared that a lot of the teachers that she has worked with include coding as an option in their virtual maker spaces coding is something that is not taught in every school but has a big impact in helping students develop creative problemsolving skills resilience and logical reasoning so yeah don't be afraid to include topics that might be brand new to your students because that's how they'll learn the most step three keep it fresh as we mentioned you want the content in your makerspace to be organized in a way that's easy to understand but you don't want it to get stale this is actually one of the best things about a virtual makerspace i think and is actually a huge benefit over a physical makerspace is that if you created your makerspace online you can change your offerings all the time you might realize that one project that you posted is not really popular with your students they're not excited about it they're not completing it get rid of it you can switch it up you can add something else in there to test out if that would work better it's a way for you to make sure that the content you're providing for students is the best content for them and also it keeps it interactive and fun and interesting your students will log on to their virtual maker space excited to see something new that they haven't tried before so as shannon says keep it fresh and step four this is the step that shannon says is one of the most important when creating your own virtual maker space listen to your students you are the expert you know your students the best if you listen to what they're interested in you can tie that into the makerspace offerings there should be a relationship between your kids and your makerspace curriculum you can ask yourself do my students see themselves reflected in these projects are these issues that they care about are they interesting to them when my students work on these activities do they see themselves as powerful change makers in the world this is one of the reasons why i'm so passionate and why i love coding and computer science as an option in your virtual makerspace because we've seen it this year more than ever technology is changing the world and we do interact with it every single day especially during virtual learning to offer something like coding and computer science in your virtual maker space will help kids make a connection between what is going on in their everyday life and what they're learning in school even our youngest students can play a role in changing the world when they learn computer science at a young age so listen to them what is relevant in their lives and make sure that that is reflected in your maker space as well okay this is the last thing that i'll talk about before we wrap it up and i i thought it was really important to include if you were to google virtual makerspace or choice boards or even looking at shannon's version of her virtual maker space looking at any of these examples they are what i would call pinterest worthy this means that they look amazing they have artistic flourishes and it's clear that a lot of time went into creating the aesthetic that you actually see when you open the makerspace having it be warm and inviting and interesting when you first open it is a huge plus but i want to make sure that before i wrap this video up i tell you that it's not required if you look at these examples and you think to yourself oh gosh i am not tech savvy i'm i'm not artistic my maker space or my choice board that i put together is not gonna look like these examples that i see on pinterest that is okay it is much more important in my opinion to make sure that the activities that you're linking to are awesome and the aesthetic how it looks can come second because at the end of the day our students are going to learn by doing the activities they're going to learn by clicking the link and following the instructions they're not going to learn just from looking at the makerspace itself they have to dive in and do the projects so that's why i just wanted to emphasize picking the right projects that are relevant for your students lives over spending a ton of time making sure it looks beautiful again both are important but don't lose sight of where the learning is happening because we're all new to this there is no best practices for virtual maker spaces yet because it's all so new please do not think that some of the examples that you see online are the template that you must use to create your virtual maker space make it your own you might have a completely different idea that works a lot better for your students so i hope that makes sense that is about it for our first episode of insert the name that i come up with for the series that i haven't thought of yet if you have any ideas for what this series could be called where i offer tips and tricks like this leave it in the comments below i'd love to get some perspective from the community that's actually going to be watching these videos i really hope you found this video helpful make sure that you like the video if you enjoyed it and you subscribe to our channel so you don't miss the next one i'll see you next time bye
