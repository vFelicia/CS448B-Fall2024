00:18 - my guess is if you're watching
00:20 - this webinar chances are you do have
00:23 - some idea of how coding education can
00:27 - benefit
00:28 - your students but you might not know all
00:30 - the details and that's why we're here
00:32 - so i've broken this section down into
00:34 - three parts the benefits for students
00:36 - the benefits for teachers because there
00:38 - are some benefits for you
00:39 - and some benefits for admin and and
00:42 - school-wide benefits as well
00:45 - so first benefits for students this is
00:48 - likely why we're bringing coding into
00:49 - the classroom we want
00:51 - uh to help our students be the best that
00:53 - they can be
00:54 - and that's what we're going to talk
00:56 - about now so the first
00:58 - big benefit is the soft skills that
01:01 - students learn while coding that can be
01:04 - helpful in all areas of school and
01:07 - beyond
01:09 - unlike hard skills that can be learned
01:12 - and evaluated these soft skills are
01:17 - they're a little bit more subtle they're
01:19 - they're harder to
01:21 - identify and they might be a little bit
01:22 - more difficult to measure
01:24 - but they are developed and fostered and
01:27 - nurtured
01:28 - through practice so we're talking about
01:31 - skills like
01:32 - teamwork and collaboration creative
01:34 - thinking and problem solving
01:36 - mental flexibility resilience and work
01:39 - ethic
01:40 - traditional schooling requires teachers
01:43 - to cover so much specific
01:45 - content knowledge that kids will be
01:47 - tested on so finding
01:48 - time to nurture and practice these soft
01:52 - skills can be really difficult
01:54 - and coding is one way to actively
01:57 - practice
01:58 - these soft skills that are you know
02:01 - they're equally as important these are
02:03 - skills that are going to serve them
02:04 - for their entire life so coding can
02:07 - really help with those soft skills for
02:09 - sure
02:11 - the next is developing executive
02:14 - functioning skills
02:16 - similar to soft skills that are a little
02:19 - bit harder
02:19 - to target in traditional school but are
02:22 - still vital
02:23 - for future success coding can help
02:26 - target
02:27 - executive function skills like planning
02:30 - planning ahead
02:32 - self-pacing figuring out what pace would
02:35 - work best for you of working on a task
02:37 - by yourself
02:38 - working memory so remembering things in
02:41 - a short
02:42 - period of time and adaptability when
02:46 - faced with challenges so when presented
02:49 - with a challenge
02:50 - how do you respond and get through that
02:53 - challenge
02:54 - coding since there are so many
02:57 - opportunities to
02:58 - make mistakes but then also identify
03:01 - them and solve them
03:02 - it's really great for staying adaptable
03:05 - when faced with challenge and
03:06 - in general developing those executive
03:08 - function skills
03:11 - the third benefit for students is
03:12 - language development
03:14 - i think we all know that children are
03:16 - are better able to learn new languages
03:18 - when they're younger
03:19 - and code is just that it's a language
03:22 - and sometimes it's easy to forget that
03:25 - but it is a language that children can
03:27 - learn when they're younger they'll have
03:29 - a faster time to catch on
03:31 - as opposed to us adults who are
03:32 - interested in learning to code when
03:34 - we're older
03:34 - and we have a little bit more difficulty
03:37 - as well as being able to learn a
03:39 - language
03:40 - faster when they're younger language
03:42 - learning has been shown to improve
03:44 - a lot of things with student cognitive
03:46 - function so that includes
03:48 - you know enhanced problem-solving skills
03:51 - improved verbal abilities
03:53 - again better memory and creative
03:56 - thinking
03:56 - so because code is a language and
03:59 - language development
04:00 - has a lot of these benefits i just like
04:02 - to point that out it's one more benefit
04:04 - for your students
04:06 - and then the fourth one is increased
04:09 - self-efficacy so when we're talking
04:10 - about
04:11 - self-efficacy we're referring to a
04:14 - couple things
04:15 - one includes mental flexibility so how
04:18 - children
04:18 - are judging their own abilities their
04:21 - confidence levels
04:23 - their confidence in the ability to like
04:26 - exert control over
04:28 - one's own motivation and behavior and
04:31 - social environment uh coding and
04:33 - computer science lessons have been
04:35 - linked to
04:36 - increased self-efficacy especially for
04:38 - early elementary students
04:40 - these students have been shown to be
04:42 - more likely to stay on task
04:44 - to stay motivated to control their
04:47 - responses to stimuli in the classroom
04:49 - so that's another huge benefit for
04:51 - coding education
04:53 - so in summary for your benefits for
04:55 - students coding skills translate
04:58 - to many different areas and benefits
05:00 - students far beyond
05:02 - just learning to code which is why i
05:04 - love it so much
05:07 - okay up next is benefits for teachers so
05:11 - while i'm guessing most of you
05:13 - might be implementing a coding program
05:16 - for the benefit
05:16 - of your students there are some
05:19 - additional benefits for teachers that
05:21 - are a huge added bonus so the first
05:24 - is a classroom culture crafting a
05:26 - classroom culture
05:28 - that is meaningful for you and your
05:30 - students so what i mean by this
05:31 - is that coding can be difficult
05:35 - and by incorporating it you're telling
05:37 - your students that your classroom
05:40 - is a safe place to try something new to
05:43 - take a risk
05:44 - to come up and generate with multiple
05:46 - possible solutions
05:47 - um when i was teaching i know my
05:50 - students would
05:51 - come to my classroom at their recess or
05:54 - their lunch breaks
05:54 - to just to ask crazy questions or to
05:57 - pitch
05:58 - a project idea just to let their
06:00 - creativity kind of run wild
06:02 - because they knew that the coding
06:04 - classroom that they entered was a place
06:07 - where
06:07 - they could do that they didn't have to
06:09 - do everything perfect they just had to
06:11 - put forward effort and
06:14 - express themselves how they wanted so
06:17 - even if you
06:18 - don't have your own classroom dedicated
06:20 - to coding if you are trying to
06:21 - incorporate coding
06:23 - or computer science into a math
06:25 - classroom or an english classroom
06:27 - just know that by doing so you are
06:30 - bringing in opportunities for
06:32 - problem solving and for risk taking and
06:35 - that's something really special for
06:36 - classroom culture
06:38 - and as well coding is oftentimes
06:41 - you know project based which means
06:44 - students have the opportunity to bring
06:45 - in
06:46 - their own personal expression to your
06:47 - classroom so you have that opportunity
06:50 - for
06:50 - responsive teaching the second benefit
06:54 - for teachers
06:55 - is we talked about it a little bit on
06:56 - the last slide but student engagement
06:58 - and motivation
07:00 - as i mentioned on that student benefits
07:02 - slide coding and computer science has
07:03 - been linked to
07:05 - increased student engagement and
07:08 - motivation to learn really so this is
07:11 - obviously great news for your kiddos but
07:13 - it's a huge plus for you as the teacher
07:15 - it's so much more fun
07:17 - and easy to teach when students are
07:19 - excited to be at school and excited to
07:21 - be learning
07:23 - which really is the key coding is fun
07:26 - and my students were motivated in class
07:28 - because it was something different
07:29 - it was something that was drawing on
07:31 - parts of their their brain that
07:33 - the other classes weren't the other
07:35 - subjects weren't you get to make things
07:37 - and share projects so
07:39 - seeing my students happy was a real
07:41 - benefit to me and i'm
07:43 - happy and engaged and motivated and i'm
07:45 - sure it would be for you too
07:50 - and then the third benefit for teachers
07:52 - is going to be
07:53 - student self-sufficiency again they all
07:56 - kind of weave together but the nature of
07:58 - coding is filled with
08:00 - trial and error forming hypotheses
08:03 - testing iterating debugging
08:06 - you know there will be an uncountable
08:08 - number of times where
08:10 - students need to get unstuck and the joy
08:13 - of coding is that there are possible
08:15 - ways to make that happen so
08:17 - you'll see students helping themselves
08:19 - helping their classmates
08:21 - to solve their problems in a way that
08:23 - works for them
08:24 - and practice is key right so if you
08:28 - bring coding into your classroom and
08:29 - there are so many chances for them to
08:30 - solve their own problems
08:32 - they are going to reach self-sufficiency
08:35 - faster
08:36 - um this example on the right this
08:38 - picture you're seeing was sent to us
08:39 - from
08:40 - a teacher who uses codable in their
08:41 - classroom and
08:43 - it's filled with recommendation
08:45 - questions that
08:46 - students can ask each other when they
08:48 - get stuck so it's a way for
08:51 - kids to help each other and to not have
08:53 - to raise their hand
08:54 - and ask the teacher when they're stuck
08:56 - every single time
08:57 - they can solve the problem on their own
08:59 - with the help from their classmates and
09:01 - that's really great
09:05 - finally there are benefits for school
09:08 - admin
09:08 - or for school-wide benefits as well
09:12 - and these are somewhat similar to
09:13 - benefits for teachers but i do think
09:15 - it's worth mentioning them on a
09:16 - school-wide
09:17 - a school-wide scale a bigger scale so
09:20 - the first
09:21 - bringing coding into your school can
09:23 - increase that culture of hard work
09:26 - we've talked about it a bunch but it's
09:27 - asking questions creative problem
09:29 - solving
09:30 - this doesn't need to be siloed to a
09:32 - single computer science room and frankly
09:34 - it shouldn't be it should be
09:36 - school-wide and i've seen a lot of
09:38 - schools have success
09:39 - when teachers buy in and are infusing
09:42 - coding or
09:43 - stem into every subject and not treating
09:47 - it just as an extra
09:49 - i think this is important because when
09:50 - we treat computer science or stem as an
09:53 - add-on
09:53 - then our students are smart and they're
09:56 - learning
09:57 - that that stem and coding is separate
10:00 - from english and math and science and
10:02 - social studies
10:03 - when in the real world they're all
10:05 - really linked together stem and coding
10:07 - and computer science
10:08 - touch all of these subjects once they
10:10 - leave
10:11 - the school yard so i do like to
10:15 - encourage
10:16 - schools to be incorporating this and not
10:19 - treat it as separate
10:20 - that said fully integrating stem into a
10:24 - curriculum takes a ton of time and it's
10:26 - not going to happen overnight
10:27 - but i do think that coding especially is
10:29 - a a good smaller place to start
10:34 - and then a third benefit for admin is
10:36 - exposing children to new career paths
10:39 - you've likely seen some sort of a chart
10:42 - or
10:43 - like a bar graph that shows how exposure
10:46 - to computer science at a young age
10:48 - increases the likelihood that that child
10:51 - will pursue it again in the future
10:52 - either in graduate study or as a career
10:55 - and that is still
10:56 - totally true we never know what sort of
10:59 - interest
11:00 - we can spark with a new subject or a new
11:03 - experience so
11:04 - bringing coding into the classroom or
11:06 - into the school
11:07 - is a good way to expose students to
11:10 - something that they might not have
11:11 - realized was a possibility for them
11:16 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

my guess is if you're watching this webinar chances are you do have some idea of how coding education can benefit your students but you might not know all the details and that's why we're here so i've broken this section down into three parts the benefits for students the benefits for teachers because there are some benefits for you and some benefits for admin and and schoolwide benefits as well so first benefits for students this is likely why we're bringing coding into the classroom we want uh to help our students be the best that they can be and that's what we're going to talk about now so the first big benefit is the soft skills that students learn while coding that can be helpful in all areas of school and beyond unlike hard skills that can be learned and evaluated these soft skills are they're a little bit more subtle they're they're harder to identify and they might be a little bit more difficult to measure but they are developed and fostered and nurtured through practice so we're talking about skills like teamwork and collaboration creative thinking and problem solving mental flexibility resilience and work ethic traditional schooling requires teachers to cover so much specific content knowledge that kids will be tested on so finding time to nurture and practice these soft skills can be really difficult and coding is one way to actively practice these soft skills that are you know they're equally as important these are skills that are going to serve them for their entire life so coding can really help with those soft skills for sure the next is developing executive functioning skills similar to soft skills that are a little bit harder to target in traditional school but are still vital for future success coding can help target executive function skills like planning planning ahead selfpacing figuring out what pace would work best for you of working on a task by yourself working memory so remembering things in a short period of time and adaptability when faced with challenges so when presented with a challenge how do you respond and get through that challenge coding since there are so many opportunities to make mistakes but then also identify them and solve them it's really great for staying adaptable when faced with challenge and in general developing those executive function skills the third benefit for students is language development i think we all know that children are are better able to learn new languages when they're younger and code is just that it's a language and sometimes it's easy to forget that but it is a language that children can learn when they're younger they'll have a faster time to catch on as opposed to us adults who are interested in learning to code when we're older and we have a little bit more difficulty as well as being able to learn a language faster when they're younger language learning has been shown to improve a lot of things with student cognitive function so that includes you know enhanced problemsolving skills improved verbal abilities again better memory and creative thinking so because code is a language and language development has a lot of these benefits i just like to point that

motivated to control their responses to stimuli in the classroom so that's another huge benefit for coding education so in summary for your benefits for students coding skills translate to many different areas and benefits students far beyond just learning to code which is why i love it so much okay up next is benefits for teachers so while i'm guessing most of you might be implementing a

sort of interest we can spark with a new subject or a new experience so bringing coding into the classroom or into the school is a good way to expose students to something that they might not have realized was a possibility for them
