00:06 - the codable back to school webinar uh
00:10 - we are so excited to talk to you all
00:11 - we're so so excited to go back to school
00:13 - with you
00:14 - um i'm gretchen i'm one of the founders
00:17 - of codable
00:18 - with me today is hannah um
00:21 - and we are looking forward to a new
00:23 - school year even though it's going to
00:25 - look a little bit different
00:26 - uh we've learned a lot in the spring and
00:28 - the summer and you're ready
00:30 - with lots of great tools for you to use
00:32 - to support your students whether you are
00:35 - in person or remote um
00:38 - do you want to take a second to
00:39 - introduce yourself sure my name is
00:41 - hannah boston i am the instructional
00:43 - coach
00:44 - and designer here at codable so the bulk
00:46 - of my role
00:47 - is creating resources for you for the
00:50 - teachers
00:51 - to make teaching easier in your
00:53 - classroom so that includes teacher
00:54 - guides and lesson plans as well as
00:57 - materials for students so i've been
00:59 - working a lot on student-facing videos
01:01 - and worksheets
01:03 - anything to support that first-time
01:05 - experience using codable
01:07 - and i actually have a background in
01:08 - teaching i did about five years as a
01:10 - preschool teacher and museum
01:12 - educator and tots in middle school
01:14 - computer science as well
01:15 - so i'm really excited that everybody is
01:17 - here and that we can share some of these
01:19 - awesome resources that we've been
01:20 - working on
01:21 - to get ready for the school year
01:25 - thanks hannah yeah um so welcome
01:27 - everybody as you guys are
01:29 - introducing yourselves in the chat if
01:30 - you haven't introduced yourself
01:32 - um you know tell us your name where
01:34 - you're from you know what grades you
01:36 - teach and maybe one thing that you are
01:38 - either nervous about or excited about
01:40 - for new school year
01:41 - um i'm gonna quickly go over our agenda
01:44 - and then we'll get started so
01:49 - uh first we're going to talk about our
01:51 - remote learning tools lots of you asked
01:53 - for
01:54 - tools to support your students as you're
01:56 - teaching remotely so we're going to
01:58 - cover all the things that we created
01:59 - this summer including some remote login
02:03 - tools as well as some teaching tools for
02:05 - you
02:07 - then we're going to go over how to set
02:08 - up one or many classes many of you asked
02:11 - about how you can
02:12 - set up lots of classes uh all at once
02:14 - and so we're going to go over some of
02:16 - those tools with you
02:18 - uh then we're going to see what it looks
02:20 - like to log in and play as a student
02:22 - just so that you know what your students
02:23 - are experiencing
02:25 - uh and you can see what it's like to log
02:27 - in for them
02:29 - uh then hannah has some instructional
02:31 - tips for you and tools a lot of you
02:33 - asked about grade specific
02:35 - uh teaching tips so
02:38 - she's going to share some of that with
02:39 - you including our scope and sequence
02:41 - and we've set aside a good amount of
02:44 - time today
02:45 - for question and questions and answers
02:47 - uh normally we like to spend a little
02:49 - bit more
02:50 - time going through like the setup of
02:52 - everything but
02:53 - we knew that this year would be a little
02:54 - bit different there might be lots of
02:56 - extra questions so
02:57 - uh we've set aside a good amount of time
02:59 - for q a at the end
03:00 - um so if you do have questions please
03:02 - post them in the chat on the right hand
03:04 - side of the video
03:05 - um brie who many of you might have
03:08 - already talked to
03:09 - uh is standing by answering questions as
03:12 - they come up
03:13 - um but if you see someone you may pause
03:16 - and
03:16 - answer them during the webinar so all
03:19 - right we'll get started
03:22 - so i'm going to go over to my teacher
03:25 - dashboard
03:26 - and this is at
03:30 - dashboard.codable.com and this is where
03:32 - you log in to see
03:34 - everything that you need to manage your
03:36 - classes uh
03:37 - to see lesson plans to check student
03:40 - progress
03:41 - to assign videos to assignment levels to
03:43 - students visit dashboard.codable.com
03:47 - right now this is our new remote
03:50 - learning
03:50 - kobe 19 support page we've added this
03:53 - over the summer
03:54 - it's your hub for all of the tools that
03:57 - you might need to support
03:58 - students learning remotely but all of
04:00 - these tools are really useful whether or
04:02 - not you're in the classroom so i imagine
04:04 - they will eventually become a permanent
04:06 - fixture
04:07 - in the codeable product they just might
04:09 - be in a different place but
04:11 - um for now they're all here in a quick
04:13 - place to find them
04:15 - first i'm going to go over student login
04:18 - so
04:21 - um so
04:24 - i'm going to show you okay so we created
04:26 - this custom
04:28 - link for teachers so this is a great
04:30 - place for
04:31 - you to share uh with families
04:34 - how they can find their child's login
04:37 - information
04:38 - um so this is a custom link for you and
04:40 - your classes
04:41 - so that's it little show
04:45 - okay great so you can see i have a lot
04:47 - of classrooms where i took a little
04:48 - while load but
04:50 - you can see it here are all of my
04:52 - classes
04:54 - my parents can go to find their class
04:57 - then they'll view the class and they'll
04:59 - be able to find their child
05:01 - so once they find their child they can
05:03 - download blogging instructions
05:05 - and this will show them exactly how to
05:07 - log into the game
05:09 - how to use the class code what the class
05:11 - code is everything that their child
05:13 - needs to log in and get started learning
05:15 - at home
05:20 - so you can see it shows use the school
05:22 - profile
05:24 - um where to log in on ios where to log
05:26 - in on web
05:28 - and then the class code and the parent
05:29 - code for them
05:32 - great all right
05:35 - and the next tool that we have if you're
05:38 - not comfortable
05:39 - sharing all of that information with um
05:42 - you know parents then that's totally
05:45 - fine we have an option here
05:47 - uh to just download a csv of all of your
05:51 - students login information so this is
05:54 - nice if you want to put it in your lms
05:56 - or if you just want to send it to people
05:57 - individually but you want it all in a
06:00 - single list
06:01 - you can get it for each class if you
06:04 - want to get all classes you just click
06:06 - export all classes if you want to find a
06:09 - specific class
06:11 - you just click that and it's going to
06:17 - save a csv for me
06:24 - there you go you can see i've got my
06:27 - child
06:27 - the student's profile name the class
06:31 - name
06:31 - the class code and then if you have
06:34 - passwords
06:34 - enabled for your class either a password
06:38 - or a picture password it'll show what
06:41 - that would be for the student
06:42 - right here if you don't have it on it's
06:44 - still going to show up here because
06:45 - we assign those automatically you just
06:47 - have to enable it if you want to use it
06:50 - um but it'll still be on this list
06:56 - okay and
06:59 - uh the last thing that i want to cover
07:01 - is our letter to families
07:03 - so this is really nice uh to use in
07:06 - conjunction with either of these options
07:08 - it's a letter that goes over
07:11 - um exactly what students are going to be
07:14 - learning
07:18 - coding in general uh we have a spanish
07:21 - version and an english version
07:25 - i'm gonna show that
07:31 - so yeah it shows what we will learn
07:34 - we're going to code
07:35 - what grades k the two are going to learn
07:37 - what grades three or five are going to
07:39 - learn
07:40 - why coding is important and then down
07:42 - here at the bottom
07:43 - you've got their uh class code and
07:46 - instructions on how to log in with that
07:48 - so it's really useful if you just want
07:51 - to send this home that's totally
07:53 - adequate but if you want to send more
07:55 - information if you have passwords
07:56 - enabled or something like that
07:58 - either of the two options that i showed
07:59 - previously will be useful for you
08:03 - okay and with that i'm going to hand it
08:06 - over to hannah who's going to
08:08 - show us some of our other teaching tools
08:11 - for mot changing
08:13 - great yeah so gretchen really went over
08:16 - some tools for remote login but getting
08:19 - the kids logged in is the first step
08:21 - then we're going to teach them using
08:22 - codeable and we've developed a series of
08:26 - materials here you can also find them on
08:28 - the covet 19 resources and updates page
08:30 - that will help you
08:32 - introduce codable for the first time in
08:33 - a remote setting again
08:35 - totally useful in person as well and
08:38 - how to teach some of the concepts along
08:40 - with the game
08:41 - in distance learning as well so the
08:44 - first resource that i will show you
08:46 - is this remote learning kickoff lesson
08:48 - this is a slide stack that i put
08:51 - together to help with that first
08:52 - time introducing codable to student
08:55 - experience
08:56 - so we got a lot of feedback from
08:57 - teachers who were saying i want to
08:59 - introduce codable
09:00 - to my kindergartners i haven't met them
09:02 - they're far away
09:03 - i can't be there in person what flow
09:06 - should i go through to
09:07 - to show them codable for the first time
09:09 - so this is a slide stack
09:11 - and you won't be able to edit this so
09:14 - just make a copy when you open it up and
09:16 - then you can modify it and change it
09:18 - and make it your own so it works for you
09:21 - and your students
09:22 - and this will walk through some of the
09:25 - background of codable
09:26 - and how to get them playing so i won't
09:29 - go through every slide but i'll just
09:31 - point out some highlights
09:32 - there's some open-ended questions to
09:34 - start getting kids excited
09:36 - and interested in the world of codable
09:38 - we have a video here
09:40 - meet the fuzz family if you haven't seen
09:42 - this video i recommend you
09:43 - check it out this gives some background
09:46 - to the fuzz family
09:47 - why they are living on fostopia
09:50 - what the different worlds of codable are
09:52 - and some background about the fuzz
09:54 - family
09:54 - i find that it helps kids get engaged
09:57 - and
09:58 - especially for younger students having
10:00 - some sort of story
10:01 - background can be really powerful for
10:04 - kind of sparking that interest right off
10:06 - the bat
10:06 - encodable in general the other very
10:09 - useful part of this slides deck
10:11 - is we walk through all the steps to
10:14 - getting kids
10:15 - logged in because if they have their
10:17 - login information great but how do they
10:19 - use it
10:20 - especially if you can't read so there's
10:22 - lots of pictures here for kids to follow
10:24 - you could be sharing this slide stack
10:28 - in a zoom call for example and walk kids
10:31 - through the steps they need to get into
10:33 - codable
10:34 - and the final piece that is really
10:36 - helpful about this slides deck i just
10:38 - added this video last week
10:40 - and it is a tour of fuzztopia so
10:44 - we've gotten some feedback from teachers
10:45 - that they can get the kids logged in but
10:47 - then
10:48 - what are they looking at what is the
10:49 - world of festopia what is this tree
10:52 - house how do they get to the lesson
10:53 - the level of the game levels uh so this
10:56 - video will walk through
10:57 - all of that it introduces fuzztopia and
11:00 - if kids ever need to go back
11:02 - and watch to see what is that building
11:04 - that i go to
11:05 - to make my own fuzz um this video will
11:08 - be super helpful for them
11:10 - again you could play it and screen share
11:12 - so that they can watch it with you on
11:14 - zoom or something
11:15 - or you could just share the link
11:17 - individually so that's a great way to
11:19 - introduce codable for the first time
11:21 - again make it your own
11:22 - modify it if you make a copy it's
11:24 - totally yours
11:26 - the second thing that i will point out
11:29 - that can be really helpful for
11:31 - using codeable to teach in a remote
11:33 - setting or in person
11:35 - are these video lessons you can find
11:37 - them here on the covid page
11:38 - or by clicking the button on the left
11:40 - side menu
11:42 - and these videos are broken down into
11:45 - two different categories we have videos
11:48 - that explain
11:49 - so these are videos that explain
11:50 - different coding concepts
11:52 - that kids are learning in the game and
11:54 - then we also have videos for
11:56 - creation so these are great for posing
11:58 - an open-ended challenge or some sort of
12:00 - an activity for
12:02 - kids to do that will spark a little bit
12:03 - more creativity
12:05 - if you are using codable for the first
12:07 - time with students
12:09 - i definitely recommend starting out a
12:11 - lesson with some sort of explain
12:14 - video we have a video for every single
12:17 - coding concept
12:18 - that codable teaches so whether it's
12:21 - sequence or conditions loops functions
12:23 - there's a
12:24 - five less than five minute video for
12:26 - every one of these
12:27 - topics they have kid friendly examples
12:31 - examples from the real world that kids
12:32 - can draw on their own experiences
12:34 - and it can just really help especially
12:37 - if you are feeling
12:38 - not super confident in your own coding
12:40 - ability these videos
12:42 - are very helpful for introducing a
12:43 - concept to students for the first time
12:46 - so i definitely recommend checking those
12:48 - out again you can find them
12:49 - right here on the covid page and oh i
12:52 - did i did want to point out that
12:54 - you can assign these videos directly to
12:56 - students
12:57 - so one option is to play it and like i
13:00 - said
13:00 - screen share so they can watch it with
13:02 - you the other thing you can do is click
13:04 - this assign video to students
13:06 - button it will bring up the menu and you
13:09 - can choose
13:10 - to assign the video to different classes
13:13 - gretchen later in this webinar will show
13:15 - you how kids will access those videos
13:18 - but they can get to them
13:19 - directly from the game itself so that
13:22 - was a feature that we had requested a
13:24 - lot and we're
13:25 - super excited that we were able to put
13:27 - it in kids can get the videos
13:29 - right in the game when they need the
13:30 - help the most so that is that
13:34 - um the last oh i have two more things
13:36 - i'm just going to show you for
13:38 - using uh the kovid 19 resources for
13:41 - teaching with codable
13:42 - um the next thing is worksheet packets
13:46 - so these are packets broken down by
13:49 - grade level that are perfect for having
13:52 - an
13:52 - unplugged experience these are great for
13:56 - those of our students that don't have
13:58 - computer access
13:59 - or access to reliable internet or as a
14:02 - supplementary material
14:04 - to accompany the online screen time you
14:07 - can also have some unplugged worksheet
14:08 - time
14:09 - and you can download these directly from
14:11 - this page
14:13 - i will show you what they look like now
14:15 - so there
14:16 - are quite a few worksheets in each
14:18 - packet and i'm hoping to
14:19 - be developing more as the semester goes
14:22 - on
14:22 - but these worksheets were designed to
14:25 - kind of mirror
14:26 - the same experience that kids are
14:28 - getting in the game but on paper
14:30 - so they're broken down by concept
14:34 - and if you were to download these
14:36 - worksheets
14:37 - right at this moment they would look
14:39 - like this if you download them
14:41 - in a couple hours they will look like
14:42 - this i'm updating them
14:44 - to include more content integration so
14:48 - we heard from a lot of teachers that you
14:50 - guys wanted to know
14:51 - not just the coding concepts that these
14:53 - worksheets are teaching but also
14:55 - what other skills these worksheets can
14:57 - be used to
14:59 - support and so if you download these in
15:01 - a couple hours
15:02 - they will have a little tag on the top
15:04 - for all the other integration
15:06 - topics that the worksheets cover so
15:08 - again great for kids to
15:10 - use if you want a little bit of a break
15:12 - from screen time or if they don't have
15:15 - internet or computer access and then the
15:18 - final piece
15:19 - if you've been using codeable before you
15:20 - know about this already but i just want
15:21 - to
15:22 - point it out how you assign game levels
15:25 - to kids so it's on the assignments tab
15:28 - on the left
15:29 - and you can click on the world that you
15:31 - want to assign levels for
15:33 - i'll start with smeeborg which is our
15:35 - introductory world so
15:37 - whether your kids are in kindergarten or
15:38 - fifth grade they'll probably be starting
15:40 - with
15:41 - smiborg and you can assign game levels
15:45 - right here so
15:46 - you choose the episode of levels that
15:49 - you want to assign
15:50 - you can click the assign button and
15:52 - choose the classes you want to assign
15:53 - the levels for
15:54 - they will assign automatically and your
15:57 - kids are ready to go so when they log in
15:59 - to the game they will only be able to
16:01 - play the levels that you have assigned
16:03 - here
16:04 - on the level assignments page it's great
16:07 - if you want to stop
16:08 - kids from moving too far forward you can
16:10 - unassign them
16:12 - and kind of control the pacing for your
16:15 - different classes
16:17 - so those are some of the resources that
16:20 - we have and i'll just really quickly say
16:22 - an example structure for how to use all
16:25 - of these because that was kind of a lot
16:26 - of stuff
16:27 - this is just a recommendation so again
16:29 - it's totally up to you
16:30 - but i might recommend introducing the
16:34 - coding concept with a video or an
16:37 - explanation some sort of instructional
16:39 - time
16:40 - then you can have kids fill out a
16:41 - worksheet and then you can have them
16:44 - play the game level as just a kind of
16:46 - natural progression
16:48 - from introduction to application to
16:52 - um playing the game levels themselves so
16:54 - if you have any more questions about how
16:56 - to
16:56 - modify these resources for your own
16:58 - class definitely let us know
17:00 - i'm happy to work one-on-one with any
17:02 - teacher to
17:03 - make sure that you put together a
17:05 - structure that feels like it works for
17:06 - you
17:07 - and now that we've kind of gone over the
17:10 - login tools the teaching tools
17:12 - gretchen is going to touch on how to set
17:15 - up your classes because all of this
17:16 - stuff is great but it's only useful
17:18 - if you actually have your classes set up
17:20 - and ready to go from the dashboard
17:22 - so i will turn it back over to
17:25 - gretchen thanks hannah yeah so now we're
17:29 - gonna go over
17:30 - how to put up one or many classes using
17:32 - codable
17:33 - this is just the minute of time because
17:34 - i've seen there's a question about
17:36 - clever and google classroom so
17:40 - i'm gonna touch on that a little bit
17:41 - today um but if you do have more
17:44 - in-depth questions about it
17:45 - i definitely recommend checking out our
17:48 - support center at support.codable.com
17:51 - we have a back-to-school section up at
17:53 - the top that uh has
17:54 - help articles on using google classroom
17:56 - using clever
17:58 - as well as uh how to add classes in bulk
18:01 - in codable if you don't use google
18:03 - classroom or clever
18:04 - um and then i also wanted to
18:08 - quickly say that i think there's a
18:09 - there's a few parents
18:11 - uh in the crowd today and thank you so
18:14 - much for showing up
18:15 - uh and helping your child learn about
18:18 - coding
18:18 - uh some of you are on the parent plan
18:21 - some of you are
18:22 - masquerading as teachers awesome i'm
18:25 - really excited
18:26 - we actually are looking into some
18:28 - options for
18:29 - homeschool this year it's something that
18:31 - we're exploring so
18:32 - if any of you are interested in that i
18:35 - uh encourage you
18:36 - to reach out to me i would love to talk
18:38 - to you learn a little bit more about
18:39 - what you're trying to do this school
18:40 - year to help try to learn
18:42 - um so that we can modify our parent plan
18:46 - for you to be the best experience so
18:48 - that is something that we're looking
18:49 - into
18:50 - if you reach me my email is gretchen
18:53 - i'm having those conversations uh this
18:56 - week
18:56 - and next week so awesome thank you
19:00 - okay so with that i'm going to hop into
19:03 - creating my first class
19:04 - uh so we're gonna go back to
19:08 - our dashboard and go to the my classes
19:12 - tab over here
19:13 - on the left and this is where you can
19:17 - add classes this is where you can access
19:19 - your class page for each individual
19:21 - class
19:21 - i have tons of classes here um so i'm
19:25 - just going to walk through
19:26 - creating a class with you so you just
19:28 - click add a class
19:31 - and i'm going to create a class name so
19:33 - i'm going to name my class
19:35 - back to school
19:40 - okay and if i have
19:44 - lots of classes that i want to add uh
19:46 - i'm gonna click the
19:47 - advanced options uh so this is where you
19:50 - could import with google classroom and
19:52 - add all of the classes at once
19:54 - uh if you are signed up with clever if
19:57 - you've already signed up with clever
19:58 - you'll also see a clever button here i'm
20:01 - not signed up with clever but
20:03 - that this is where it would show up um
20:05 - if you decide that you want to add
20:07 - multiple classes at once using the
20:10 - quotable bulk
20:11 - import feature you would just click this
20:14 - need to add multiple classes button
20:16 - and that would take you to the bulk
20:17 - import option
20:20 - um so i've selected a k-5 pacing for my
20:23 - class
20:24 - because i want them to
20:27 - have access to everything all of the
20:29 - levels encodable however
20:31 - if this was say a first grade class and
20:34 - i want to
20:35 - pace codeable for them as a first grade
20:38 - class or
20:39 - with content that's appropriate for
20:41 - first grade class i could just select
20:43 - first grade
20:44 - and that would make everything that
20:45 - shows up in the game
20:47 - be focused on first grade it would also
20:49 - uh
20:50 - tailor the lesson plans that show up on
20:52 - my class page for this class to be a
20:54 - first grade
20:56 - pacing uh but i'm going to leave it open
20:58 - to okay to five
21:00 - for now i can always change that later
21:03 - okay i'm going to continue
21:06 - and here's where i can add my students
21:08 - so you can copy and paste these
21:10 - from a roster if you have it uh
21:13 - if you don't and you just want to skip
21:15 - it for now that's fine too you can add
21:17 - students later but
21:18 - i'm going to add my students
21:29 - great okay
21:34 - and here's my class code so this is what
21:36 - my students will use to log
21:38 - in to codeable4 uh to access all of the
21:41 - levels and to log into the game
21:43 - uh we generate this code for you but if
21:46 - you decide you want to use something
21:48 - that's a little bit easier for
21:49 - kindergarteners or first graders
21:51 - to remember you can always edit this
21:53 - later
21:54 - and i'll show you how to do that in just
21:57 - a second
21:58 - now i'm going to hit continue
22:11 - great uh so this is another option for
22:14 - uh
22:14 - sharing information with parents these
22:17 - are printable invitations that are
22:19 - customized for each student uh if you
22:21 - click that button it will generate them
22:23 - for you
22:24 - but for now i'm just going to skip it
22:29 - all right well this is my class page uh
22:32 - so you can access a lot of tools from
22:34 - here
22:34 - i'm not going to get too into this uh
22:36 - last year's
22:38 - last year's webinar was heavily focused
22:40 - on class setup and management
22:41 - and it's it hasn't changed so if you
22:44 - have questions about this
22:46 - i recommend checking out the 2019
22:48 - webinar
22:49 - uh the link is in the agenda that we
22:51 - sent out in an email before this
22:54 - started i'm also going to ask for you to
22:56 - post the link
22:57 - in the chat for you right now um that is
23:00 - where you can find
23:01 - all of that all of all the information
23:03 - about managing your class
23:06 - the time stamps for everything are in
23:08 - the description so you can easily find
23:10 - what you're looking for
23:11 - um but i'm just going to hop over to the
23:14 - class settings and
23:16 - show you where you can edit the class
23:17 - code so you just go to this class code
23:20 - and name
23:31 - this is also where i can turn on picture
23:33 - passwords or
23:34 - text passwords a lot of people were
23:36 - asking us for passwords in the spring
23:38 - when remote learning
23:39 - first kicked off and uh we
23:43 - added picture passwords and text
23:44 - passwords for you guys so you can
23:46 - turn those off and on really easily and
23:49 - then you can also change your pacing so
23:51 - like i said if i was to make this a
23:54 - first grade
23:55 - uh that would change what shows up on my
23:58 - lessons page right here
24:00 - but for right now again i'm leaving it k
24:02 - to five
24:04 - all right
24:12 - i think that's everything for this
24:13 - section so i'm going to
24:15 - turn it over to uh hannah for
24:18 - some instructional tips and tools
24:23 - great so there's a couple
24:26 - tools that i will go over that are on
24:28 - the teacher dashboard for you to use
24:30 - and some of these you you may have seen
24:33 - before and some of these are
24:35 - new compared to what we had available
24:37 - last year um so i will start
24:39 - with teacher demo mode if you don't know
24:42 - what teacher demo mode is you can access
24:44 - it it's that first button
24:46 - on the left side menu underneath the
24:48 - kovid 19 resources section
24:50 - teacher demo mode you can play the
24:53 - codable game
24:53 - and see exactly what your students will
24:56 - see
24:57 - in the game all of the content encodable
25:00 - is
25:00 - unlocked in demo mode and there's a
25:02 - couple
25:03 - reasons why this is super helpful one
25:06 - is that you can demo different
25:09 - levels that maybe the students haven't
25:11 - gotten to yet but if you want to
25:13 - show a little teaser or prepare them for
25:15 - what's to come
25:16 - you can show them exactly what levels
25:20 - they might see in the game coming up
25:22 - you can walk through a level yourself if
25:25 - you want to demo
25:26 - or model one level and then have the
25:28 - kids do it
25:29 - at the same time maybe you're doing a
25:31 - screen share in zoom
25:32 - or if you want to show them some of the
25:35 - different
25:36 - creative options that we have the fuzz
25:38 - builder game designer and maze maker
25:40 - you can access all of these as well so
25:44 - demo mode is great you can get it right
25:46 - on your dashboard you don't need to
25:48 - create a different profile or anything
25:51 - it's in the same place that all the
25:52 - other resources are located
25:54 - so you can use teacher demo mode again
25:56 - to prepare yourself for
25:57 - lessons or to demo and model levels
26:01 - and activities for kids so that is the
26:03 - first thing you may have seen that
26:04 - before
26:05 - something that is different compared to
26:07 - what we had at the beginning of last
26:09 - year is the lesson library
26:11 - now we used to have a resources section
26:14 - at the top of this dashboard as well
26:17 - we have combined it with a lesson
26:18 - library because we wanted everything you
26:20 - might need
26:21 - to teach with codable to be in one easy
26:24 - to find place
26:26 - so the lesson library looks like this
26:28 - there's a couple sections
26:29 - the first is a get to know codable
26:31 - section that includes a series of
26:34 - videos you might recognize some of these
26:36 - we've gone over
26:37 - already but if you were to click on
26:40 - a video this get to know codable section
26:43 - you can watch this video
26:44 - to learn and then there's also a series
26:46 - of guides you can download because i
26:48 - know some teachers want to read instead
26:49 - of watch a video
26:50 - we have a little bit for everyone so you
26:53 - can download
26:53 - teacher guides here how to set up
26:55 - devices and how to introduce the fuzz
26:57 - family
26:58 - all in one place the next section you
27:01 - can browse resources by codable world
27:04 - so this is really helpful since the game
27:06 - is broken up into these
27:08 - uh different codable worlds neborg
27:10 - astroradia and bug world we wanted the
27:11 - lesson library to also be broken up in
27:13 - the same way so it's super easy for you
27:15 - to follow along
27:17 - each section includes a bunch of
27:19 - resources and i won't walk through every
27:21 - single one i'll just point out
27:23 - the different materials that we do have
27:24 - available so
27:26 - there's a teacher guide if you want to
27:27 - learn more about the coding content
27:29 - and what the kids are learning there's
27:31 - some learning outcomes in here as well
27:33 - you can do that for smeeborg at least
27:35 - there's answer keys we have a vocabulary
27:37 - page and you can also get to the student
27:39 - videos
27:40 - from these world pages as well so again
27:43 - it's a lot of resources you may have
27:45 - already seen that we've talked about
27:46 - in this webinar so far but all in one
27:49 - place
27:49 - and the same goes for asteroidia and for
27:52 - bug world
27:54 - we did get a question from a teacher who
27:56 - was asking
27:57 - you know what are some recommendations
27:59 - for using codeable with older
28:01 - students for like third fourth and fifth
28:03 - graders because a lot of
28:04 - our resources are geared for younger
28:06 - kids and i do want to point out
28:08 - a great way is to start with these
28:11 - teacher guides
28:12 - the content in bugrow than astroradia it
28:14 - can it's kind of confusing it can get a
28:16 - little tricky
28:17 - and by understanding it yourself and
28:19 - reading through these teacher guides
28:20 - you'll be better prepared to support
28:23 - some older students with
28:24 - this content that they can totally grasp
28:27 - but that does might
28:28 - like it might take a little bit more uh
28:31 - work and understanding and you can
28:32 - show them these student videos as well
28:35 - to get those older kids
28:36 - engaged and recognizing that shooting
28:39 - the astro
28:40 - the fuzz balls at the asteroids is
28:42 - teaching variables and values so
28:45 - those are some resources for that and
28:48 - the
28:48 - last section is exploring the lessons by
28:51 - grade
28:52 - and i will just show you when you click
28:55 - on
28:55 - the different grade levels it has all of
28:57 - our lesson plans available
28:59 - these are unplugged lesson plans
29:01 - designed for
29:04 - in-class collaborative use however
29:08 - even if you are remote teaching you can
29:10 - click on these lessons and modify
29:14 - them to fit the needs of your students a
29:17 - lot of them would be great for
29:18 - encouraging kids to get outside and do
29:20 - some sort of activity if that's what
29:22 - you're looking for
29:23 - and then they also include some really
29:25 - helpful direct instruction
29:29 - scripted lesson plans that you can use
29:30 - so even if you're not
29:32 - following the entire plan you can pick
29:34 - and choose from the lessons
29:36 - what pieces might be helpful for for you
29:39 - and your
29:40 - students and i wanted to show that
29:43 - in this lesson section you can filter
29:47 - and we have a lot of other
29:50 - subjects aside from just coding concepts
29:53 - that
29:54 - are taught with these lessons so we
29:56 - integrate with math
29:57 - english language arts robotics we have
30:00 - some lessons that are social studies
30:01 - related and science related
30:03 - so if you are curious about integrating
30:06 - codable
30:07 - in other subject matters definitely
30:10 - check out
30:10 - these lesson plans and explore these
30:13 - different
30:14 - subjects that we are also catering to
30:17 - for example
30:17 - if i chose ela for fifth graders there's
30:19 - a choose your own adventure
30:21 - lesson and some letter writing lessons
30:23 - so
30:24 - a great way to not just teach coding but
30:26 - to integrate it
30:27 - in other subjects as well
30:30 - and along with content integration and
30:34 - for thinking about teaching
30:37 - children of all different grades we do
30:39 - have some
30:40 - resources available that will help you
30:42 - figure out that pacing and that scope
30:44 - and sequence
30:45 - so there is a site on our codeable site
30:49 - you can go to
30:50 - which is codable.com outcomes
30:53 - and that link where you can share in the
30:56 - chat and if you haven't seen this
30:58 - this is our section of the website where
31:02 - we go
31:02 - over the different computer science
31:04 - standards that codable
31:06 - is meeting and that kids are learning
31:07 - when using codable
31:09 - this was developed by a big team of
31:11 - computer science experts and the codable
31:13 - team
31:14 - and breaks down what students are
31:17 - learning with codable not just
31:19 - related to computational thinking but
31:21 - also a lot of
31:22 - other skills like communication
31:25 - social emotional learning and impact all
31:28 - of this is on our website
31:30 - and you can also take a look at our
31:32 - scope and sequence so i linked it
31:34 - in the agenda that we sent out and brie
31:37 - can share it in the chat as well i
31:41 - linked this lesson planner because it
31:42 - breaks down
31:44 - the beginning is a space where you can
31:46 - plan some of your lessons for the year
31:48 - but then
31:48 - it also breaks down our full scope and
31:51 - sequence for k-5 concepts
31:54 - so this is useful for you you can use it
31:57 - if you want you don't have to of course
31:58 - but we do
31:59 - show you all of the different units that
32:02 - we teach with codable and a breakdown
32:04 - for k through five what kids are
32:06 - learning
32:07 - and if you scroll down further what game
32:11 - levels
32:12 - can be used to teach each theme
32:15 - and unit so this is great if you want a
32:18 - little bit more support
32:20 - in terms of structuring your levels and
32:23 - lessons for each individual grade
32:25 - especially for teachers using
32:27 - codable with a wide range of grades not
32:30 - just one
32:31 - this is great for kind of keeping track
32:33 - of what levels
32:34 - you would want students to play to meet
32:36 - all of those
32:37 - outcomes so this is available to you
32:40 - again i linked it in the agenda
32:43 - for this webinar and i encourage you to
32:44 - check it out if you're looking for a
32:46 - little bit more support
32:47 - with structuring codable for multiple
32:50 - grade levels and i think our last
32:54 - section so those are the instructional
32:56 - tips and tools before i
32:58 - let gretchen wrap it up i do want to say
33:00 - if you have any questions about that
33:02 - please let me know my email is hannah
33:05 - codable.com and i'm happy to work with
33:08 - you
33:09 - to put together different lesson plans
33:12 - or
33:12 - a unit plan for you and your students
33:15 - just let me know
33:16 - so i will turn it back over to gretchen
33:18 - and she will show you
33:20 - what students do how they log into the
33:22 - game and
33:23 - what the game is so gretchen take it
33:26 - away yeah
33:27 - i actually just wanted to before we
33:29 - switched to that section hannah i wanted
33:31 - to
33:32 - address a couple of the questions that
33:33 - we got in our rsvp
33:35 - document um one of them was regarding
33:39 - you know how do i what questions can i
33:41 - ask my students to
33:43 - know if they're learning and um i did
33:47 - want to point out
33:48 - while you were on the lesson plans page
33:50 - uh where they can find the check for
33:51 - understanding
33:52 - section for every lesson because that's
33:55 - a really useful tool
33:56 - even if you're not using the lesson
33:58 - plans if you go to a lesson that's
34:00 - associated with the concept
34:02 - that your students are working on that
34:04 - week
34:05 - you can pull that check your
34:06 - understanding section out and use it
34:09 - either as a take-home assignment
34:10 - as a discussion in your room call or
34:14 - in your classroom and that's a great way
34:16 - to understand
34:17 - what your kids are learning from
34:19 - holdable
34:21 - another option too is to just use the uh
34:24 - worksheet that we created that had
34:27 - created to
34:28 - check you know how well students are
34:30 - retaining the information
34:32 - from the letters so that's i just wanted
34:35 - to be sure to mention that while we were
34:37 - on it
34:38 - it's great all right cool so i am going
34:41 - to take over
34:43 - and we're going to go over student login
34:45 - so
34:46 - to log students in they need to either
34:49 - download codable on ios or
34:52 - have a browser where they can
34:57 - log into codable.com login encodable
35:00 - works on any web browser
35:02 - so as long as they have access to a
35:03 - computer and internet they can
35:05 - get on um or if they have an ipad
35:08 - or an iphone at home they can use
35:11 - codeable for ios
35:14 - uh so i'm going to demonstrate how to
35:18 - log in on a computer
35:20 - uh so i'm logging in to a school profile
35:24 - we also have home profiles many of you
35:26 - i think are parents who are on a home um
35:30 - the difference here is that the school
35:32 - profile is
35:33 - set up to receive assignments it's set
35:36 - up for
35:36 - school use and if you are having your
35:39 - students
35:40 - learn at home you're going to want to
35:42 - share the class code and let them know
35:43 - to log in with their
35:45 - profile the home profile is for home
35:48 - memberships it's for parents who want to
35:50 - give their kids extra practice
35:52 - it has different levels than what
35:53 - students are playing at school
35:55 - it has different games and features um
35:57 - including like some coding challenges
35:59 - for extra practice
36:00 - it has um access to the store where they
36:04 - can like
36:05 - customize their fuzz and get use the
36:07 - coins that they earn to buy
36:08 - you know different costumes for their
36:10 - buzzes or decorations for fuzz
36:12 - topia so they're very different um but
36:15 - complementary so
36:16 - depending on what your child what kids
36:19 - are learning at school
36:20 - their parents may want to opt in to
36:22 - getting a home membership and that would
36:24 - be the home
36:24 - profile login but for school use
36:28 - we're going to use this full profile
36:31 - so i'm going to use my class code that
36:33 - has some progress
36:34 - already so i'm going to screen this
36:38 - class
36:55 - okay and i'm going to click on my name
37:08 - so for a view of what codable will look
37:11 - like
37:12 - the first time students log in i
37:14 - recommend using the postopia tour video
37:17 - uh sharing that with your students
37:18 - watching that to understand what
37:20 - postopia will look like for them the
37:22 - first time they log in i've played with
37:24 - this profile already so everything is
37:26 - unlocked
37:27 - um so this is what topia will eventually
37:30 - look like
37:31 - but to see what that unlocking and that
37:33 - first experience is like i would i
37:35 - definitely recommend that video
37:37 - uh that we shared earlier um but i'm
37:40 - just gonna hop right into it so
37:42 - flustopia has a lot of different places
37:45 - where your students can explore
37:46 - uh there's maze maker where they can
37:48 - create their own maze levels
37:50 - and practice using sequencing conditions
37:52 - loops
37:53 - and functions there's game designer
37:55 - where they can
37:57 - create their own games using ascorbia
38:00 - variables
38:00 - and properties there's a builder where
38:04 - they can hold their own characters
38:06 - and they are exploring what javascript
38:09 - and swift look like uh and then
38:12 - there are some other sections that
38:16 - students have access to at home uh to
38:19 - you know play more levels uh and then
38:22 - we have here the videos tab this is
38:24 - where students will see the videos that
38:27 - you assigned to them from your teacher
38:28 - dashboard
38:29 - and the video view here in order
38:32 - that they were assigned so this was the
38:35 - most recently assigned video on june
38:38 - 23rd
38:38 - for my class i assigned a video on loops
38:41 - so it shows up at the top
38:42 - if i was to assign one today it would
38:45 - show up above this one
38:47 - so it's going to shut the most recent is
38:49 - going to show up at the top
38:51 - there's also a tab for all videos and
38:53 - this is where students can kind of
38:55 - explore on their own
38:56 - if they want to find videos that are
38:58 - helpful for what they're learning
39:00 - at the moment they can hop over here and
39:02 - see all of the videos and sort
39:04 - by concept i wouldn't recommend that for
39:07 - your younger students but for some of
39:08 - your older students who
39:09 - can do you know directed learning
39:11 - self-directed learning i think
39:12 - that's a good option
39:15 - okay so i'm gonna hop back into the game
39:18 - and
39:19 - i'm going to show mission control so
39:21 - mission control is where your students
39:23 - jump off into all of the different games
39:26 - that are assigned from your teacher
39:28 - dashboard this is where
39:29 - you can direct them uh to find their
39:32 - assignments so
39:34 - the first world that most of your
39:36 - students will start with is sneeborg and
39:38 - maborg is focused on programming logic
39:41 - and um some of the problem solving
39:44 - skills that are
39:45 - important for learning to code there's
39:47 - no text so it's all symbol-based
39:49 - it's great for your kind of learners but
39:51 - it's also useful for your older students
39:53 - to
39:54 - uh start with so that they have a solid
39:57 - foundation before they hop into any
39:59 - text-based coding
40:01 - students are going to learn about
40:02 - sequencing conditions
40:04 - loops and functions
40:07 - the next is australia is for probably
40:11 - you know your third and fourth grade
40:12 - students this is their first transition
40:15 - into code we start introducing what
40:17 - variables are what they look like
40:19 - in conjunction with the videos it's a
40:21 - really helpful
40:23 - place for them to start being familiar
40:25 - with what code looks like and how
40:27 - javascript is used uh in
40:30 - astroradio they're matching different
40:34 - fuzzballs with different properties to
40:36 - the matching
40:38 - asteroids to clear the asteroid field
40:43 - and then we have bug world which is for
40:46 - our fourth and fifth grade students this
40:48 - is where we're starting to introduce
40:49 - them to
40:50 - object oriented programming students are
40:54 - battling the slimes of the world and
40:57 - defending
40:58 - the buzz family with their hero
41:01 - defenders
41:02 - they can modify the properties and the
41:05 - objects that are
41:06 - used in this game to basically
41:09 - win the game and
41:12 - the last world is beach cleanup this is
41:15 - our hour food event
41:17 - last year and it was so popular
41:22 - uh it's appropriate for all ages k-5
41:25 - they can't customize the difficulty so
41:27 - they can choose if they want it to be
41:29 - easy medium or hard
41:30 - in there they can practice sequencing
41:32 - conditions loops
41:34 - and functions and kids can draw their
41:37 - own maze
41:38 - and then they have them to pick up trash
41:41 - on the beach
41:42 - and then they have to program their way
41:44 - through that maze that they just
41:47 - and the last thing that i want to point
41:48 - out here is the quick play button a lot
41:51 - of you asked for this
41:52 - it used to be encodable and it
41:54 - disappeared and now it's made a return
41:56 - because
41:57 - backed by popular demand um we have he
42:00 - added the quick play button so the quick
42:01 - play button just
42:03 - does exactly what it says it goes
42:04 - directly to the last
42:06 - level that your student was on so it's
42:08 - easy for them to
42:10 - quickly get back to the level they were
42:12 - on or quickly get to the assigned
42:14 - levels without having to navigate
42:16 - through all the different menus
42:20 - okay and with that i
42:23 - am going to switch to our q a section
42:28 - um so if you have any questions
42:31 - about anything that we've covered so far
42:33 - please
42:35 - post that in the chat
42:38 - uh but i'm gonna go ahead and answer
42:40 - some of the questions
42:41 - that we had over
42:46 - oh sorry lost my notebook okay
42:49 - i gotta answer some of the questions
42:51 - that we had in the rsvp link
42:53 - uh that we didn't have time to answer
42:55 - here so um i'm just going to quickly go
42:57 - over
42:58 - those um so i've covered what devices
43:00 - portable is accessible on
43:02 - ipads and computer browser another
43:06 - question that we have is
43:07 - what will be accessible to schools who
43:09 - do not have a technology budget this
43:10 - year
43:11 - and that's really important we didn't
43:13 - want to cover that so
43:14 - uh the free version of portable includes
43:17 - the first two sets of
43:18 - levels in each unit so if you think
43:20 - about sequence it's going to have the
43:22 - first two sets of levels in that unit
43:24 - available for free
43:26 - as well as the first lesson plan in that
43:28 - unit
43:29 - um and that's true for all political
43:30 - units however
43:32 - uh to help to help the schools that are
43:35 - kind of struggling due to changes caused
43:37 - by the pandemic
43:38 - we are offering access to all lessons
43:41 - in the lesson library through december
43:44 - of this year so through december of
43:46 - 2020.
43:46 - um it does not include levels in the
43:48 - game but it does include
43:50 - all teaching materials all lesson plans
43:52 - and videos in the lesson library
43:54 - you will have access to those through
43:56 - the end of this
43:57 - calendar year here um
44:00 - what kind of questions can i ask my kids
44:02 - to find out what they're learning from
44:04 - the material oh because i thought
44:05 - already
44:06 - uh how do i assign codable to your
44:08 - google classroom so
44:10 - i talked about this a little bit i
44:12 - definitely recommend checking out our
44:13 - support center but
44:14 - assigning through portable is simple in
44:17 - the classroom
44:18 - we do have a health article in our
44:19 - support center for that um
44:22 - when you add i do want to point out
44:24 - though that
44:25 - when you add students using the group of
44:28 - classroom import
44:30 - it's not a two-way integration so when
44:33 - you do it
44:34 - make sure that everything's in there
44:35 - because if you make any changes to your
44:37 - google classroom
44:38 - after that's been done you have to redo
44:41 - the import it doesn't automatically
44:42 - change
44:43 - when you make changes in google
44:44 - classroom
44:46 - um gretchen can i add one thing about
44:48 - the google classroom question
44:50 - great so yeah like gretchen mentioned
44:53 - you can use google classroom
44:54 - to add your students to codable super
44:57 - easy and that integration will add them
44:59 - you click a button and it'll happen
45:00 - automatically in terms of assigning
45:03 - codable levels through google classroom
45:06 - and that will look
45:06 - like in google classroom when you have
45:08 - that assignments
45:10 - or like the classwork section um you can
45:13 - post
45:14 - the link to codeablecodable.com
45:18 - login or i actually might gretchen will
45:21 - you share my screen really quick so i
45:22 - can show this
45:23 - um in your on your teacher dashboard
45:27 - you can select your class so i'm on the
45:29 - dashboard i'm clicking on my classes you
45:32 - can select your class
45:33 - and at the top it says class code this
45:36 - is the class code that i set up for this
45:38 - class
45:39 - if i click this it will automatically
45:42 - open up
45:43 - my roster i can copy this url
45:47 - and post this to google classroom that
45:50 - way when my kids log into their google
45:52 - classroom
45:52 - all they need to do is click this link
45:55 - it will open up
45:56 - this page automatically they don't need
45:58 - to enter their class code this will pop
46:00 - up automatically and then they can
46:02 - choose
46:02 - their name so in terms of assigning
46:06 - through
46:06 - google classroom that is probably the
46:09 - easiest way to do it it's just a one
46:11 - click for your students and they'll be
46:12 - brought
46:13 - immediately to their roster they just
46:15 - need to find their name
46:16 - to log in awesome thank you
46:20 - yeah um okay
46:24 - and then the next question is similar if
46:27 - students use codable last year and log
46:29 - them through clever
46:30 - how do i move them to their new class
46:32 - and new teacher will it resync
46:34 - automatically
46:35 - i it might not resync automatically it
46:38 - depends on if
46:39 - you are on a paid version of portable
46:42 - or not but if you want to do the sync
46:45 - manually just
46:46 - log into your codable dashboard and
46:49 - click the
46:50 - sync with clever button on the my
46:52 - classes page
46:53 - and that will start the same thing and
46:56 - make sure that all of your students are
46:58 - in the correct class
47:00 - uh and free if you could link to that
47:03 - support
47:04 - article in the chat that would be
47:05 - helpful okay
47:07 - awesome so the see
47:10 - i think that free is handling all the
47:12 - questions in the chat but
47:14 - um someone didn't ask what is the best
47:16 - practice
47:17 - having kids start over eat here or
47:20 - moving them to a new class and keeping
47:22 - their progress
47:23 - and um it really is up to you
47:27 - you can transfer students for this thing
47:29 - will be
47:30 - clever or you can actually we have a
47:32 - transfer option
47:33 - uh within codable as well you can
47:36 - transfer students
47:36 - and their progress will stay with you
47:39 - but
47:40 - we do recommend starting them over each
47:42 - year if
47:43 - you are wanting to manage what they're
47:45 - doing in potable if it's a free play
47:48 - scenario in your classroom that's
47:50 - totally fine i would recommend making
47:52 - their progress because kids love all the
47:53 - things that they create
47:55 - but if you happen to be you know trying
47:57 - to structure
47:58 - your lessons following a certain pacing
48:01 - it is fine to
48:02 - start them over from where they need to
48:04 - be each year
48:08 - let me see if there's any questions
48:15 - oh this is a good one okay so um
48:18 - luke asked if we archive or delete a
48:20 - class do children still have access to
48:22 - the projects that they
48:23 - have made and the answer is no uh if the
48:26 - class is deleted it's gone
48:28 - so the students won't be able to log in
48:30 - the class code will no longer work
48:32 - and their progress will no longer be
48:35 - incredible
48:40 - it looks like stephanie wrote does the
48:43 - ipad app have access to the same content
48:45 - as playing on the website
48:47 - i can see yeah where that confusion
48:49 - might come from yes it is exactly
48:51 - the same product so if you click
48:54 - log in with the school profile on the
48:56 - ipad app or
48:58 - log in with a school profile on the
48:59 - website it will look
49:01 - exactly the same and they will have
49:02 - access to the same content playing on
49:04 - either
49:04 - platform
49:08 - um let's see here oh
49:12 - claire asked about our social channels
49:14 - so you can follow us on
49:16 - facebook and twitter we love having you
49:19 - guys apart so you're
49:20 - always sharing new things here we
49:21 - actually have a new member of the
49:23 - codable team who's going to be working
49:25 - on all of our social channels and you're
49:28 - going to start to see and hear from her
49:30 - more names maria
49:31 - she just joined this week ago maria
49:33 - she's watching right now
49:35 - um but that's who you'll be talking to
49:37 - if you chat with us on social
49:39 - um and yeah so please feel free to
49:42 - follow us on facebook
49:43 - twitter and instagram our handle is at
49:47 - codable
49:47 - on all of those channels uh we also just
49:50 - started
49:51 - a uh seesaw page
49:54 - and are posting activities there so
49:57 - if you're looking for some seesaw
49:58 - activities that use codable
50:00 - uh check out our blog there's a page
50:03 - there with all of our seesaw activities
50:06 - um and then the last channel to
50:08 - definitely mention
50:10 - is our youtube channel because
50:13 - hannah has done hannah has done a great
50:17 - job
50:18 - of making our youtube the hub for all
50:22 - things video so like if you're looking
50:24 - for a video to
50:26 - teach your students about anything
50:27 - incredible you can probably find it on
50:29 - our youtube channel
50:30 - just subscribe to our channel and you'll
50:32 - get notifications when we post new
50:33 - things there
50:34 - totally and i will add at the bottom of
50:36 - the covid19 resources page
50:39 - on your teacher dashboard i didn't show
50:41 - it when i was going through my demo but
50:43 - there is a button to click
50:44 - that says are we missing anything are
50:47 - you looking for anything that we don't
50:48 - have
50:49 - if you know that your students would
50:51 - really benefit from a certain type of
50:52 - video
50:53 - i'm making them almost every week and
50:55 - i'm happy to take suggestions
50:57 - so if you have a topic idea for a video
51:00 - that you're looking for
51:01 - please feel free to fill out that form
51:03 - you can find it exactly on the
51:04 - covet 19 resources page and i will take
51:07 - a look and connect with you
51:08 - if it seems like something that other
51:09 - teachers would benefit from
51:13 - great i'm going to cover a couple of
51:14 - more questions that we got from our rcp
51:17 - page so
51:18 - how do you handle teaching remotely to
51:20 - kids who are way ahead of others in
51:22 - class
51:23 - so i think with all of the different
51:26 - tools that we've shared today it might
51:28 - be a little bit easier to do this
51:30 - differently than it was in the classroom
51:33 - uh so if you want to move all of your
51:34 - all-stars to a separate codeable class
51:37 - and then assign advanced videos and
51:39 - levels to them
51:41 - that would be my recommendation so that
51:43 - any students who are ready for more
51:45 - challenging content
51:47 - would have their own class code and log
51:48 - in and they would be able to
51:51 - access it all from home at their own
51:54 - pace hannah do you have anything to add
51:58 - for your arena yeah i was just going to
52:01 - add
52:02 - that i i showed the concept
52:05 - videos the explain concept videos on the
52:07 - dashboard the other section of that was
52:09 - the create
52:10 - videos and sort of what gretchen was
52:12 - saying
52:13 - um if you were to create if you if let's
52:15 - say half your class is moving at a much
52:17 - faster pace than the other half
52:19 - you could create two classes and then
52:21 - for the class that's moving ahead
52:22 - if you don't want them to do more game
52:25 - levels but you still want them to have
52:27 - meaningful experiences with codable you
52:29 - could assign them one of those
52:30 - creative videos they're basically mini
52:33 - challenges we call them coding missions
52:36 - and a lot of them use the
52:39 - uh the creative activities encodable the
52:41 - fuzz builder the maze maker and the game
52:43 - designer
52:43 - and those never expire you can kids can
52:46 - create as many projects as they want
52:48 - in using those platforms so that's one
52:50 - option you could have
52:51 - those kids that are moving ahead do kind
52:53 - of an open-ended
52:55 - creative project as you have some of the
52:58 - other students playing the levels
53:00 - and catching up so yeah gretchen's just
53:02 - showing how
53:04 - there were the explained videos on the
53:05 - left and the create videos on the right
53:07 - um there's eight coding missions so far
53:09 - but i'm creating more all the time
53:11 - and again they're like short four minute
53:14 - mini challenges
53:16 - um some of them are unplugged some of
53:17 - them are plugged in so that's a great
53:19 - way to
53:20 - keep kids engaged if they're moving in
53:22 - the levels
53:23 - faster they can do an activity to
53:27 - kind of pump the brakes and and fill the
53:28 - time there yeah so to kind of add on to
53:31 - that
53:31 - you know suggested structure that hannah
53:35 - mentioned earlier about
53:36 - finding the video to introduce the
53:38 - concept
53:39 - if you wanted to assign say you were
53:41 - covering functions
53:42 - that week you could assign the
53:45 - introduction to functions and then you
53:47 - could also assign
53:48 - this fashionable functions coding
53:50 - mission video
53:51 - that is for kids who have extra time
53:54 - so if they move ahead and they're ready
53:56 - for something more challenging
53:59 - uh that is functions related then you
54:02 - could assign this video to them
54:04 - oh and i will say for the parents that
54:06 - are watching the families that are
54:07 - watching
54:08 - these videos the coding missions and the
54:11 - concept videos
54:12 - um also show up onto your parent
54:14 - dashboard so and they're free on our
54:16 - youtube channel as well
54:17 - so these are not just for teachers these
54:19 - can be used by anybody who wants
54:21 - a little extra activity or explanation
54:24 - for the coding concept
54:26 - feel free to use these whether you're a
54:27 - teacher or a parent
54:29 - or both definitely
54:33 - okay and then we have a couple more
54:36 - questions here
54:39 - oh i love this question this is the last
54:41 - question we have from the rctv
54:43 - how can i teach coding outdoors without
54:45 - computers
54:46 - and i love this in any scenario but it
54:49 - sounds like it might be
54:55 - instruction which is sounds great um if
54:58 - you're
54:58 - in person take a look at the lesson
55:00 - library every single lesson plan
55:02 - includes an unplugged portion that is
55:04 - perfect for instruction outside
55:06 - without computers so all of the lesson
55:08 - plans that hannah was showing
55:10 - from the lesson library have a
55:13 - guided guided practice section and that
55:15 - is meant to be unplugged
55:17 - it may be a collaborative activity or it
55:19 - might be a worksheet
55:21 - it might have kids you know doing some
55:23 - sort of
55:24 - a obstacle course there's lots of
55:26 - different things that we have there
55:27 - getting them to
55:29 - move and think um about computer science
55:34 - in the way that it relates to them with
55:36 - the world around them not just on
55:38 - computers
55:40 - okay so that's all of our questions that
55:43 - we have prepared in advance
55:44 - are there any questions from anyone in
55:47 - the chat we've had a couple more minutes
55:49 - it looks like brie is a superhero in
55:51 - that chat right now and it looks like
55:52 - she's covering most of them so thank you
55:55 - yes thank you so much
56:07 - oh this is an inch this is a good one
56:09 - and it's probably a good one to point
56:11 - out right now so
56:12 - i teach portable as a parent to my
56:13 - six-year-old is there a live chatbot or
56:16 - support system if they're stuck with a
56:17 - problem
56:18 - we do not have a live chatbot um
56:20 - although
56:21 - we do have a support we we all do
56:24 - support it codeable we have a support uh
56:26 - channel where you can reach out to us
56:28 - but for kids we don't recommend that
56:30 - it's not set up for us to answer their
56:32 - questions however
56:34 - we have added a
56:37 - hint system into smeaboard
56:40 - using fuzzbuzz this fairy fuzz that
56:43 - helpful she likes to fly in and get
56:45 - hints if they need it
56:46 - uh and there's a she'll hold a little
56:49 - question mark sign
56:51 - on the side of the level if they've been
56:53 - inactive for a little bit of time
56:55 - and they can tap on
56:59 - i like to leave it up to kids sometimes
57:01 - they're just thinking and they don't
57:02 - need a hint but sometimes they do
57:03 - um so she will fly in and give a hint to
57:06 - your child
57:07 - uh or your students if they need it um
57:11 - introduced this
57:12 - i hope you have any feedback about the
57:14 - way that kids are getting would love it
57:16 - um you can always reach out to us with
57:18 - that feedback at supportable.com
57:20 - and that's where you can reach out to
57:22 - any of us if you have
57:24 - questions after this webinar is over
57:31 - all right i think that i haven't seen

57:52 - you
57:54 - all right thanks everyone bye bye

Cleaned transcript:

alrighty we're here hello hi everyone um welcome to the codable back to school webinar uh we are so excited to talk to you all we're so so excited to go back to school with you um i'm gretchen i'm one of the founders of codable with me today is hannah um and we are looking forward to a new school year even though it's going to look a little bit different uh we've learned a lot in the spring and the summer and you're ready with lots of great tools for you to use to support your students whether you are in person or remote um do you want to take a second to introduce yourself sure my name is hannah boston i am the instructional coach and designer here at codable so the bulk of my role is creating resources for you for the teachers to make teaching easier in your classroom so that includes teacher guides and lesson plans as well as materials for students so i've been working a lot on studentfacing videos and worksheets anything to support that firsttime experience using codable and i actually have a background in teaching i did about five years as a preschool teacher and museum educator and tots in middle school computer science as well so i'm really excited that everybody is here and that we can share some of these awesome resources that we've been working on to get ready for the school year thanks hannah yeah um so welcome everybody as you guys are introducing yourselves in the chat if you haven't introduced yourself um you know tell us your name where you're from you know what grades you teach and maybe one thing that you are either nervous about or excited about for new school year um i'm gonna quickly go over our agenda and then we'll get started so uh first we're going to talk about our remote learning tools lots of you asked for tools to support your students as you're teaching remotely so we're going to cover all the things that we created this summer including some remote login tools as well as some teaching tools for you then we're going to go over how to set up one or many classes many of you asked about how you can set up lots of classes uh all at once and so we're going to go over some of those tools with you uh then we're going to see what it looks like to log in and play as a student just so that you know what your students are experiencing uh and you can see what it's like to log in for them uh then hannah has some instructional tips for you and tools a lot of you asked about grade specific uh teaching tips so she's going to share some of that with you including our scope and sequence and we've set aside a good amount of time today for question and questions and answers uh normally we like to spend a little bit more time going through like the setup of everything but we knew that this year would be a little bit different there might be lots of extra questions so uh we've set aside a good amount of time for q a at the end um so if you do have questions please post them in the chat on the right hand side of the video um brie who many of you might have already talked to uh is standing by answering questions as they come up um but if you see someone you may pause and answer them during the webinar so all right we'll get started so i'm going to go over to my teacher dashboard and this is at dashboard.codable.com and this is where you log in to see everything that you need to manage your classes uh to see lesson plans to check student progress to assign videos to assignment levels to students visit dashboard.codable.com right now this is our new remote learning kobe 19 support page we've added this over the summer it's your hub for all of the tools that you might need to support students learning remotely but all of these tools are really useful whether or not you're in the classroom so i imagine they will eventually become a permanent fixture in the codeable product they just might be in a different place but um for now they're all here in a quick place to find them first i'm going to go over student login so um so i'm going to show you okay so we created this custom link for teachers so this is a great place for you to share uh with families how they can find their child's login information um so this is a custom link for you and your classes so that's it little show okay great so you can see i have a lot of classrooms where i took a little while load but you can see it here are all of my classes my parents can go to find their class then they'll view the class and they'll be able to find their child so once they find their child they can download blogging instructions and this will show them exactly how to log into the game how to use the class code what the class code is everything that their child needs to log in and get started learning at home so you can see it shows use the school profile um where to log in on ios where to log in on web and then the class code and the parent code for them great all right and the next tool that we have if you're not comfortable sharing all of that information with um you know parents then that's totally fine we have an option here uh to just download a csv of all of your students login information so this is nice if you want to put it in your lms or if you just want to send it to people individually but you want it all in a single list you can get it for each class if you want to get all classes you just click export all classes if you want to find a specific class you just click that and it's going to save a csv for me there you go you can see i've got my child the student's profile name the class name the class code and then if you have passwords enabled for your class either a password or a picture password it'll show what that would be for the student right here if you don't have it on it's still going to show up here because we assign those automatically you just have to enable it if you want to use it um but it'll still be on this list okay and uh the last thing that i want to cover is our letter to families so this is really nice uh to use in conjunction with either of these options it's a letter that goes over um exactly what students are going to be learning coding in general uh we have a spanish version and an english version i'm gonna show that so yeah it shows what we will learn we're going to code what grades k the two are going to learn what grades three or five are going to learn why coding is important and then down here at the bottom you've got their uh class code and instructions on how to log in with that so it's really useful if you just want to send this home that's totally adequate but if you want to send more information if you have passwords enabled or something like that either of the two options that i showed previously will be useful for you okay and with that i'm going to hand it over to hannah who's going to show us some of our other teaching tools for mot changing great yeah so gretchen really went over some tools for remote login but getting the kids logged in is the first step then we're going to teach them using codeable and we've developed a series of materials here you can also find them on the covet 19 resources and updates page that will help you introduce codable for the first time in a remote setting again totally useful in person as well and how to teach some of the concepts along with the game in distance learning as well so the first resource that i will show you is this remote learning kickoff lesson this is a slide stack that i put together to help with that first time introducing codable to student experience so we got a lot of feedback from teachers who were saying i want to introduce codable to my kindergartners i haven't met them they're far away i can't be there in person what flow should i go through to to show them codable for the first time so this is a slide stack and you won't be able to edit this so just make a copy when you open it up and then you can modify it and change it and make it your own so it works for you and your students and this will walk through some of the background of codable and how to get them playing so i won't go through every slide but i'll just point out some highlights there's some openended questions to start getting kids excited and interested in the world of codable we have a video here meet the fuzz family if you haven't seen this video i recommend you check it out this gives some background to the fuzz family why they are living on fostopia what the different worlds of codable are and some background about the fuzz family i find that it helps kids get engaged and especially for younger students having some sort of story background can be really powerful for kind of sparking that interest right off the bat encodable in general the other very useful part of this slides deck is we walk through all the steps to getting kids logged in because if they have their login information great but how do they use it especially if you can't read so there's lots of pictures here for kids to follow you could be sharing this slide stack in a zoom call for example and walk kids through the steps they need to get into codable and the final piece that is really helpful about this slides deck i just added this video last week and it is a tour of fuzztopia so we've gotten some feedback from teachers that they can get the kids logged in but then what are they looking at what is the world of festopia what is this tree house how do they get to the lesson the level of the game levels uh so this video will walk through all of that it introduces fuzztopia and if kids ever need to go back and watch to see what is that building that i go to to make my own fuzz um this video will be super helpful for them again you could play it and screen share so that they can watch it with you on zoom or something or you could just share the link individually so that's a great way to introduce codable for the first time again make it your own modify it if you make a copy it's totally yours the second thing that i will point out that can be really helpful for using codeable to teach in a remote setting or in person are these video lessons you can find them here on the covid page or by clicking the button on the left side menu and these videos are broken down into two different categories we have videos that explain so these are videos that explain different coding concepts that kids are learning in the game and then we also have videos for creation so these are great for posing an openended challenge or some sort of an activity for kids to do that will spark a little bit more creativity if you are using codable for the first time with students i definitely recommend starting out a lesson with some sort of explain video we have a video for every single coding concept that codable teaches so whether it's sequence or conditions loops functions there's a five less than five minute video for every one of these topics they have kid friendly examples examples from the real world that kids can draw on their own experiences and it can just really help especially if you are feeling not super confident in your own coding ability these videos are very helpful for introducing a concept to students for the first time so i definitely recommend checking those out again you can find them right here on the covid page and oh i did i did want to point out that you can assign these videos directly to students so one option is to play it and like i said screen share so they can watch it with you the other thing you can do is click this assign video to students button it will bring up the menu and you can choose to assign the video to different classes gretchen later in this webinar will show you how kids will access those videos but they can get to them directly from the game itself so that was a feature that we had requested a lot and we're super excited that we were able to put it in kids can get the videos right in the game when they need the help the most so that is that um the last oh i have two more things i'm just going to show you for using uh the kovid 19 resources for teaching with codable um the next thing is worksheet packets so these are packets broken down by grade level that are perfect for having an unplugged experience these are great for those of our students that don't have computer access or access to reliable internet or as a supplementary material to accompany the online screen time you can also have some unplugged worksheet time and you can download these directly from this page i will show you what they look like now so there are quite a few worksheets in each packet and i'm hoping to be developing more as the semester goes on but these worksheets were designed to kind of mirror the same experience that kids are getting in the game but on paper so they're broken down by concept and if you were to download these worksheets right at this moment they would look like this if you download them in a couple hours they will look like this i'm updating them to include more content integration so we heard from a lot of teachers that you guys wanted to know not just the coding concepts that these worksheets are teaching but also what other skills these worksheets can be used to support and so if you download these in a couple hours they will have a little tag on the top for all the other integration topics that the worksheets cover so again great for kids to use if you want a little bit of a break from screen time or if they don't have internet or computer access and then the final piece if you've been using codeable before you know about this already but i just want to point it out how you assign game levels to kids so it's on the assignments tab on the left and you can click on the world that you want to assign levels for i'll start with smeeborg which is our introductory world so whether your kids are in kindergarten or fifth grade they'll probably be starting with smiborg and you can assign game levels right here so you choose the episode of levels that you want to assign you can click the assign button and choose the classes you want to assign the levels for they will assign automatically and your kids are ready to go so when they log in to the game they will only be able to play the levels that you have assigned here on the level assignments page it's great if you want to stop kids from moving too far forward you can unassign them and kind of control the pacing for your different classes so those are some of the resources that we have and i'll just really quickly say an example structure for how to use all of these because that was kind of a lot of stuff this is just a recommendation so again it's totally up to you but i might recommend introducing the coding concept with a video or an explanation some sort of instructional time then you can have kids fill out a worksheet and then you can have them play the game level as just a kind of natural progression from introduction to application to um playing the game levels themselves so if you have any more questions about how to modify these resources for your own class definitely let us know i'm happy to work oneonone with any teacher to make sure that you put together a structure that feels like it works for you and now that we've kind of gone over the login tools the teaching tools gretchen is going to touch on how to set up your classes because all of this stuff is great but it's only useful if you actually have your classes set up and ready to go from the dashboard so i will turn it back over to gretchen thanks hannah yeah so now we're gonna go over how to put up one or many classes using codable this is just the minute of time because i've seen there's a question about clever and google classroom so i'm gonna touch on that a little bit today um but if you do have more indepth questions about it i definitely recommend checking out our support center at support.codable.com we have a backtoschool section up at the top that uh has help articles on using google classroom using clever as well as uh how to add classes in bulk in codable if you don't use google classroom or clever um and then i also wanted to quickly say that i think there's a there's a few parents uh in the crowd today and thank you so much for showing up uh and helping your child learn about coding uh some of you are on the parent plan some of you are masquerading as teachers awesome i'm really excited we actually are looking into some options for homeschool this year it's something that we're exploring so if any of you are interested in that i uh encourage you to reach out to me i would love to talk to you learn a little bit more about what you're trying to do this school year to help try to learn um so that we can modify our parent plan for you to be the best experience so that is something that we're looking into if you reach me my email is gretchen i'm having those conversations uh this week and next week so awesome thank you okay so with that i'm going to hop into creating my first class uh so we're gonna go back to our dashboard and go to the my classes tab over here on the left and this is where you can add classes this is where you can access your class page for each individual class i have tons of classes here um so i'm just going to walk through creating a class with you so you just click add a class and i'm going to create a class name so i'm going to name my class back to school okay and if i have lots of classes that i want to add uh i'm gonna click the advanced options uh so this is where you could import with google classroom and add all of the classes at once uh if you are signed up with clever if you've already signed up with clever you'll also see a clever button here i'm not signed up with clever but that this is where it would show up um if you decide that you want to add multiple classes at once using the quotable bulk import feature you would just click this need to add multiple classes button and that would take you to the bulk import option um so i've selected a k5 pacing for my class because i want them to have access to everything all of the levels encodable however if this was say a first grade class and i want to pace codeable for them as a first grade class or with content that's appropriate for first grade class i could just select first grade and that would make everything that shows up in the game be focused on first grade it would also uh tailor the lesson plans that show up on my class page for this class to be a first grade pacing uh but i'm going to leave it open to okay to five for now i can always change that later okay i'm going to continue and here's where i can add my students so you can copy and paste these from a roster if you have it uh if you don't and you just want to skip it for now that's fine too you can add students later but i'm going to add my students great okay and here's my class code so this is what my students will use to log in to codeable4 uh to access all of the levels and to log into the game uh we generate this code for you but if you decide you want to use something that's a little bit easier for kindergarteners or first graders to remember you can always edit this later and i'll show you how to do that in just a second now i'm going to hit continue great uh so this is another option for uh sharing information with parents these are printable invitations that are customized for each student uh if you click that button it will generate them for you but for now i'm just going to skip it all right well this is my class page uh so you can access a lot of tools from here i'm not going to get too into this uh last year's last year's webinar was heavily focused on class setup and management and it's it hasn't changed so if you have questions about this i recommend checking out the 2019 webinar uh the link is in the agenda that we sent out in an email before this started i'm also going to ask for you to post the link in the chat for you right now um that is where you can find all of that all of all the information about managing your class the time stamps for everything are in the description so you can easily find what you're looking for um but i'm just going to hop over to the class settings and show you where you can edit the class code so you just go to this class code and name this is also where i can turn on picture passwords or text passwords a lot of people were asking us for passwords in the spring when remote learning first kicked off and uh we added picture passwords and text passwords for you guys so you can turn those off and on really easily and then you can also change your pacing so like i said if i was to make this a first grade uh that would change what shows up on my lessons page right here but for right now again i'm leaving it k to five all right i think that's everything for this section so i'm going to turn it over to uh hannah for some instructional tips and tools great so there's a couple tools that i will go over that are on the teacher dashboard for you to use and some of these you you may have seen before and some of these are new compared to what we had available last year um so i will start with teacher demo mode if you don't know what teacher demo mode is you can access it it's that first button on the left side menu underneath the kovid 19 resources section teacher demo mode you can play the codable game and see exactly what your students will see in the game all of the content encodable is unlocked in demo mode and there's a couple reasons why this is super helpful one is that you can demo different levels that maybe the students haven't gotten to yet but if you want to show a little teaser or prepare them for what's to come you can show them exactly what levels they might see in the game coming up you can walk through a level yourself if you want to demo or model one level and then have the kids do it at the same time maybe you're doing a screen share in zoom or if you want to show them some of the different creative options that we have the fuzz builder game designer and maze maker you can access all of these as well so demo mode is great you can get it right on your dashboard you don't need to create a different profile or anything it's in the same place that all the other resources are located so you can use teacher demo mode again to prepare yourself for lessons or to demo and model levels and activities for kids so that is the first thing you may have seen that before something that is different compared to what we had at the beginning of last year is the lesson library now we used to have a resources section at the top of this dashboard as well we have combined it with a lesson library because we wanted everything you might need to teach with codable to be in one easy to find place so the lesson library looks like this there's a couple sections the first is a get to know codable section that includes a series of videos you might recognize some of these we've gone over already but if you were to click on a video this get to know codable section you can watch this video to learn and then there's also a series of guides you can download because i know some teachers want to read instead of watch a video we have a little bit for everyone so you can download teacher guides here how to set up devices and how to introduce the fuzz family all in one place the next section you can browse resources by codable world so this is really helpful since the game is broken up into these uh different codable worlds neborg astroradia and bug world we wanted the lesson library to also be broken up in the same way so it's super easy for you to follow along each section includes a bunch of resources and i won't walk through every single one i'll just point out the different materials that we do have available so there's a teacher guide if you want to learn more about the coding content and what the kids are learning there's some learning outcomes in here as well you can do that for smeeborg at least there's answer keys we have a vocabulary page and you can also get to the student videos from these world pages as well so again it's a lot of resources you may have already seen that we've talked about in this webinar so far but all in one place and the same goes for asteroidia and for bug world we did get a question from a teacher who was asking you know what are some recommendations for using codeable with older students for like third fourth and fifth graders because a lot of our resources are geared for younger kids and i do want to point out a great way is to start with these teacher guides the content in bugrow than astroradia it can it's kind of confusing it can get a little tricky and by understanding it yourself and reading through these teacher guides you'll be better prepared to support some older students with this content that they can totally grasp but that does might like it might take a little bit more uh work and understanding and you can show them these student videos as well to get those older kids engaged and recognizing that shooting the astro the fuzz balls at the asteroids is teaching variables and values so those are some resources for that and the last section is exploring the lessons by grade and i will just show you when you click on the different grade levels it has all of our lesson plans available these are unplugged lesson plans designed for inclass collaborative use however even if you are remote teaching you can click on these lessons and modify them to fit the needs of your students a lot of them would be great for encouraging kids to get outside and do some sort of activity if that's what you're looking for and then they also include some really helpful direct instruction scripted lesson plans that you can use so even if you're not following the entire plan you can pick and choose from the lessons what pieces might be helpful for for you and your students and i wanted to show that in this lesson section you can filter and we have a lot of other subjects aside from just coding concepts that are taught with these lessons so we integrate with math english language arts robotics we have some lessons that are social studies related and science related so if you are curious about integrating codable in other subject matters definitely check out these lesson plans and explore these different subjects that we are also catering to for example if i chose ela for fifth graders there's a choose your own adventure lesson and some letter writing lessons so a great way to not just teach coding but to integrate it in other subjects as well and along with content integration and for thinking about teaching children of all different grades we do have some resources available that will help you figure out that pacing and that scope and sequence so there is a site on our codeable site you can go to which is codable.com outcomes and that link where you can share in the chat and if you haven't seen this this is our section of the website where we go over the different computer science standards that codable is meeting and that kids are learning when using codable this was developed by a big team of computer science experts and the codable team and breaks down what students are learning with codable not just related to computational thinking but also a lot of other skills like communication social emotional learning and impact all of this is on our website and you can also take a look at our scope and sequence so i linked it in the agenda that we sent out and brie can share it in the chat as well i linked this lesson planner because it breaks down the beginning is a space where you can plan some of your lessons for the year but then it also breaks down our full scope and sequence for k5 concepts so this is useful for you you can use it if you want you don't have to of course but we do show you all of the different units that we teach with codable and a breakdown for k through five what kids are learning and if you scroll down further what game levels can be used to teach each theme and unit so this is great if you want a little bit more support in terms of structuring your levels and lessons for each individual grade especially for teachers using codable with a wide range of grades not just one this is great for kind of keeping track of what levels you would want students to play to meet all of those outcomes so this is available to you again i linked it in the agenda for this webinar and i encourage you to check it out if you're looking for a little bit more support with structuring codable for multiple grade levels and i think our last section so those are the instructional tips and tools before i let gretchen wrap it up i do want to say if you have any questions about that please let me know my email is hannah codable.com and i'm happy to work with you to put together different lesson plans or a unit plan for you and your students just let me know so i will turn it back over to gretchen and she will show you what students do how they log into the game and what the game is so gretchen take it away yeah i actually just wanted to before we switched to that section hannah i wanted to address a couple of the questions that we got in our rsvp document um one of them was regarding you know how do i what questions can i ask my students to know if they're learning and um i did want to point out while you were on the lesson plans page uh where they can find the check for understanding section for every lesson because that's a really useful tool even if you're not using the lesson plans if you go to a lesson that's associated with the concept that your students are working on that week you can pull that check your understanding section out and use it either as a takehome assignment as a discussion in your room call or in your classroom and that's a great way to understand what your kids are learning from holdable another option too is to just use the uh worksheet that we created that had created to check you know how well students are retaining the information from the letters so that's i just wanted to be sure to mention that while we were on it it's great all right cool so i am going to take over and we're going to go over student login so to log students in they need to either download codable on ios or have a browser where they can log into codable.com login encodable works on any web browser so as long as they have access to a computer and internet they can get on um or if they have an ipad or an iphone at home they can use codeable for ios uh so i'm going to demonstrate how to log in on a computer uh so i'm logging in to a school profile we also have home profiles many of you i think are parents who are on a home um the difference here is that the school profile is set up to receive assignments it's set up for school use and if you are having your students learn at home you're going to want to share the class code and let them know to log in with their profile the home profile is for home memberships it's for parents who want to give their kids extra practice it has different levels than what students are playing at school it has different games and features um including like some coding challenges for extra practice it has um access to the store where they can like customize their fuzz and get use the coins that they earn to buy you know different costumes for their buzzes or decorations for fuzz topia so they're very different um but complementary so depending on what your child what kids are learning at school their parents may want to opt in to getting a home membership and that would be the home profile login but for school use we're going to use this full profile so i'm going to use my class code that has some progress already so i'm going to screen this class okay and i'm going to click on my name so for a view of what codable will look like the first time students log in i recommend using the postopia tour video uh sharing that with your students watching that to understand what postopia will look like for them the first time they log in i've played with this profile already so everything is unlocked um so this is what topia will eventually look like but to see what that unlocking and that first experience is like i would i definitely recommend that video uh that we shared earlier um but i'm just gonna hop right into it so flustopia has a lot of different places where your students can explore uh there's maze maker where they can create their own maze levels and practice using sequencing conditions loops and functions there's game designer where they can create their own games using ascorbia variables and properties there's a builder where they can hold their own characters and they are exploring what javascript and swift look like uh and then there are some other sections that students have access to at home uh to you know play more levels uh and then we have here the videos tab this is where students will see the videos that you assigned to them from your teacher dashboard and the video view here in order that they were assigned so this was the most recently assigned video on june 23rd for my class i assigned a video on loops so it shows up at the top if i was to assign one today it would show up above this one so it's going to shut the most recent is going to show up at the top there's also a tab for all videos and this is where students can kind of explore on their own if they want to find videos that are helpful for what they're learning at the moment they can hop over here and see all of the videos and sort by concept i wouldn't recommend that for your younger students but for some of your older students who can do you know directed learning selfdirected learning i think that's a good option okay so i'm gonna hop back into the game and i'm going to show mission control so mission control is where your students jump off into all of the different games that are assigned from your teacher dashboard this is where you can direct them uh to find their assignments so the first world that most of your students will start with is sneeborg and maborg is focused on programming logic and um some of the problem solving skills that are important for learning to code there's no text so it's all symbolbased it's great for your kind of learners but it's also useful for your older students to uh start with so that they have a solid foundation before they hop into any textbased coding students are going to learn about sequencing conditions loops and functions the next is australia is for probably you know your third and fourth grade students this is their first transition into code we start introducing what variables are what they look like in conjunction with the videos it's a really helpful place for them to start being familiar with what code looks like and how javascript is used uh in astroradio they're matching different fuzzballs with different properties to the matching asteroids to clear the asteroid field and then we have bug world which is for our fourth and fifth grade students this is where we're starting to introduce them to object oriented programming students are battling the slimes of the world and defending the buzz family with their hero defenders they can modify the properties and the objects that are used in this game to basically win the game and the last world is beach cleanup this is our hour food event last year and it was so popular uh it's appropriate for all ages k5 they can't customize the difficulty so they can choose if they want it to be easy medium or hard in there they can practice sequencing conditions loops and functions and kids can draw their own maze and then they have them to pick up trash on the beach and then they have to program their way through that maze that they just and the last thing that i want to point out here is the quick play button a lot of you asked for this it used to be encodable and it disappeared and now it's made a return because backed by popular demand um we have he added the quick play button so the quick play button just does exactly what it says it goes directly to the last level that your student was on so it's easy for them to quickly get back to the level they were on or quickly get to the assigned levels without having to navigate through all the different menus okay and with that i am going to switch to our q a section um so if you have any questions about anything that we've covered so far please post that in the chat uh but i'm gonna go ahead and answer some of the questions that we had over oh sorry lost my notebook okay i gotta answer some of the questions that we had in the rsvp link uh that we didn't have time to answer here so um i'm just going to quickly go over those um so i've covered what devices portable is accessible on ipads and computer browser another question that we have is what will be accessible to schools who do not have a technology budget this year and that's really important we didn't want to cover that so uh the free version of portable includes the first two sets of levels in each unit so if you think about sequence it's going to have the first two sets of levels in that unit available for free as well as the first lesson plan in that unit um and that's true for all political units however uh to help to help the schools that are kind of struggling due to changes caused by the pandemic we are offering access to all lessons in the lesson library through december of this year so through december of 2020. um it does not include levels in the game but it does include all teaching materials all lesson plans and videos in the lesson library you will have access to those through the end of this calendar year here um what kind of questions can i ask my kids to find out what they're learning from the material oh because i thought already uh how do i assign codable to your google classroom so i talked about this a little bit i definitely recommend checking out our support center but assigning through portable is simple in the classroom we do have a health article in our support center for that um when you add i do want to point out though that when you add students using the group of classroom import it's not a twoway integration so when you do it make sure that everything's in there because if you make any changes to your google classroom after that's been done you have to redo the import it doesn't automatically change when you make changes in google classroom um gretchen can i add one thing about the google classroom question great so yeah like gretchen mentioned you can use google classroom to add your students to codable super easy and that integration will add them you click a button and it'll happen automatically in terms of assigning codable levels through google classroom and that will look like in google classroom when you have that assignments or like the classwork section um you can post the link to codeablecodable.com login or i actually might gretchen will you share my screen really quick so i can show this um in your on your teacher dashboard you can select your class so i'm on the dashboard i'm clicking on my classes you can select your class and at the top it says class code this is the class code that i set up for this class if i click this it will automatically open up my roster i can copy this url and post this to google classroom that way when my kids log into their google classroom all they need to do is click this link it will open up this page automatically they don't need to enter their class code this will pop up automatically and then they can choose their name so in terms of assigning through google classroom that is probably the easiest way to do it it's just a one click for your students and they'll be brought immediately to their roster they just need to find their name to log in awesome thank you yeah um okay and then the next question is similar if students use codable last year and log them through clever how do i move them to their new class and new teacher will it resync automatically i it might not resync automatically it depends on if you are on a paid version of portable or not but if you want to do the sync manually just log into your codable dashboard and click the sync with clever button on the my classes page and that will start the same thing and make sure that all of your students are in the correct class uh and free if you could link to that support article in the chat that would be helpful okay awesome so the see i think that free is handling all the questions in the chat but um someone didn't ask what is the best practice having kids start over eat here or moving them to a new class and keeping their progress and um it really is up to you you can transfer students for this thing will be clever or you can actually we have a transfer option uh within codable as well you can transfer students and their progress will stay with you but we do recommend starting them over each year if you are wanting to manage what they're doing in potable if it's a free play scenario in your classroom that's totally fine i would recommend making their progress because kids love all the things that they create but if you happen to be you know trying to structure your lessons following a certain pacing it is fine to start them over from where they need to be each year let me see if there's any questions oh this is a good one okay so um luke asked if we archive or delete a class do children still have access to the projects that they have made and the answer is no uh if the class is deleted it's gone so the students won't be able to log in the class code will no longer work and their progress will no longer be incredible it looks like stephanie wrote does the ipad app have access to the same content as playing on the website i can see yeah where that confusion might come from yes it is exactly the same product so if you click log in with the school profile on the ipad app or log in with a school profile on the website it will look exactly the same and they will have access to the same content playing on either platform um let's see here oh claire asked about our social channels so you can follow us on facebook and twitter we love having you guys apart so you're always sharing new things here we actually have a new member of the codable team who's going to be working on all of our social channels and you're going to start to see and hear from her more names maria she just joined this week ago maria she's watching right now um but that's who you'll be talking to if you chat with us on social um and yeah so please feel free to follow us on facebook twitter and instagram our handle is at codable on all of those channels uh we also just started a uh seesaw page and are posting activities there so if you're looking for some seesaw activities that use codable uh check out our blog there's a page there with all of our seesaw activities um and then the last channel to definitely mention is our youtube channel because hannah has done hannah has done a great job of making our youtube the hub for all things video so like if you're looking for a video to teach your students about anything incredible you can probably find it on our youtube channel just subscribe to our channel and you'll get notifications when we post new things there totally and i will add at the bottom of the covid19 resources page on your teacher dashboard i didn't show it when i was going through my demo but there is a button to click that says are we missing anything are you looking for anything that we don't have if you know that your students would really benefit from a certain type of video i'm making them almost every week and i'm happy to take suggestions so if you have a topic idea for a video that you're looking for please feel free to fill out that form you can find it exactly on the covet 19 resources page and i will take a look and connect with you if it seems like something that other teachers would benefit from great i'm going to cover a couple of more questions that we got from our rcp page so how do you handle teaching remotely to kids who are way ahead of others in class so i think with all of the different tools that we've shared today it might be a little bit easier to do this differently than it was in the classroom uh so if you want to move all of your allstars to a separate codeable class and then assign advanced videos and levels to them that would be my recommendation so that any students who are ready for more challenging content would have their own class code and log in and they would be able to access it all from home at their own pace hannah do you have anything to add for your arena yeah i was just going to add that i i showed the concept videos the explain concept videos on the dashboard the other section of that was the create videos and sort of what gretchen was saying um if you were to create if you if let's say half your class is moving at a much faster pace than the other half you could create two classes and then for the class that's moving ahead if you don't want them to do more game levels but you still want them to have meaningful experiences with codable you could assign them one of those creative videos they're basically mini challenges we call them coding missions and a lot of them use the uh the creative activities encodable the fuzz builder the maze maker and the game designer and those never expire you can kids can create as many projects as they want in using those platforms so that's one option you could have those kids that are moving ahead do kind of an openended creative project as you have some of the other students playing the levels and catching up so yeah gretchen's just showing how there were the explained videos on the left and the create videos on the right um there's eight coding missions so far but i'm creating more all the time and again they're like short four minute mini challenges um some of them are unplugged some of them are plugged in so that's a great way to keep kids engaged if they're moving in the levels faster they can do an activity to kind of pump the brakes and and fill the time there yeah so to kind of add on to that you know suggested structure that hannah mentioned earlier about finding the video to introduce the concept if you wanted to assign say you were covering functions that week you could assign the introduction to functions and then you could also assign this fashionable functions coding mission video that is for kids who have extra time so if they move ahead and they're ready for something more challenging uh that is functions related then you could assign this video to them oh and i will say for the parents that are watching the families that are watching these videos the coding missions and the concept videos um also show up onto your parent dashboard so and they're free on our youtube channel as well so these are not just for teachers these can be used by anybody who wants a little extra activity or explanation for the coding concept feel free to use these whether you're a teacher or a parent or both definitely okay and then we have a couple more questions here oh i love this question this is the last question we have from the rctv how can i teach coding outdoors without computers and i love this in any scenario but it sounds like it might be instruction which is sounds great um if you're in person take a look at the lesson library every single lesson plan includes an unplugged portion that is perfect for instruction outside without computers so all of the lesson plans that hannah was showing from the lesson library have a guided guided practice section and that is meant to be unplugged it may be a collaborative activity or it might be a worksheet it might have kids you know doing some sort of a obstacle course there's lots of different things that we have there getting them to move and think um about computer science in the way that it relates to them with the world around them not just on computers okay so that's all of our questions that we have prepared in advance are there any questions from anyone in the chat we've had a couple more minutes it looks like brie is a superhero in that chat right now and it looks like she's covering most of them so thank you yes thank you so much oh this is an inch this is a good one and it's probably a good one to point out right now so i teach portable as a parent to my sixyearold is there a live chatbot or support system if they're stuck with a problem we do not have a live chatbot um although we do have a support we we all do support it codeable we have a support uh channel where you can reach out to us but for kids we don't recommend that it's not set up for us to answer their questions however we have added a hint system into smeaboard using fuzzbuzz this fairy fuzz that helpful she likes to fly in and get hints if they need it uh and there's a she'll hold a little question mark sign on the side of the level if they've been inactive for a little bit of time and they can tap on i like to leave it up to kids sometimes they're just thinking and they don't need a hint but sometimes they do um so she will fly in and give a hint to your child uh or your students if they need it um introduced this i hope you have any feedback about the way that kids are getting would love it um you can always reach out to us with that feedback at supportable.com and that's where you can reach out to any of us if you have questions after this webinar is over all right i think that i haven't seen any questions pop up i think degree hannah has most of them she's an allstar um but if you do like i said if you guys have any questions about the fact please reach out to us um and we're looking forward to the school year yeah thank you so much for joining us and yeah feel free to reach out with any other questions we are here to support you all right thanks everyone bye bye
