00:00 - good morning I'm Gretchen we're the
00:02 - founders of codable this is Hannah and I
00:06 - recently joined our team early this
00:09 - summer that she recently she's our
00:12 - instructional coach at global so a lot
00:14 - of you may have talked to her this
00:16 - summer we've been doing some training
00:17 - calls with her she's doing a great job
00:19 - she was making some amazing resources
00:23 - you will find we'll cover some of them
00:25 - in this webinar but you'll find the
00:27 - money on your dashboard um she was a
00:31 - computer science teacher in an
00:33 - elementary school and then went back to
00:35 - school at Harvard where she was studying
00:38 - technology innovation in education and
00:41 - she was also working in their creative
00:44 - computing lab there for a little bit
00:45 - she's just super knowledgeable we're so
00:48 - lucky having um and so she's going to be
00:52 - joining us she's gonna be leaving most
00:54 - of this so you guys can get familiar
00:55 - with Hannah um if you have any questions
00:58 - as we're going through things we have a
01:00 - live chat on the side you can push your
01:02 - question there we're going to be
01:03 - checking in with that as we go and
01:05 - breathe I'm sure many of you know BRE
01:07 - she is going to be monitoring questions
01:09 - and answering any of them as they come
01:13 - up if she can so we're so excited to
01:17 - have you all if you have questions feel
01:20 - free to post them we're going to cover
01:22 - so I'm just going to give you a rundown
01:24 - of all the things you're going to talk
01:25 - about we're gonna cover getting started
01:28 - with codable so many of you all are new
01:30 - yeah thank you to everybody who RSVP'd
01:31 - and told us a little bit about if you
01:34 - can use Google before I was so blown
01:36 - away it's so exciting to have so many
01:37 - newbies and then some of you guys are
01:40 - coming back for the second time or third
01:42 - time I think gosh this points like seven
01:45 - years I think so um we're gonna cover
01:48 - all of the exciting things we added this
01:50 - summer we've been making a lot of
01:52 - changes on the parent side of coda well
01:56 - they're going to affect some of the
01:57 - things you're doing at school
01:59 - we're also we've also been adding a lot
02:01 - of resources on your teacher dashboard
02:03 - so we're going to get to some of that
02:05 - today so yeah let's get started I'm so
02:08 - excited to have you back to school
02:09 - everybody yeah
02:10 - have you back to school so my kitchen
02:12 - said the goal of this webinar is really
02:14 - for all of you to feel comfortable
02:16 - teaching your first class with codable
02:18 - this year whether that's your first
02:19 - class ever or your just your first class
02:22 - this year because your students are new
02:24 - and so we're gonna jump in I'm going to
02:26 - broadcast my teacher dashboard to you
02:29 - guys and walk through some things that
02:31 - are new and then the basics for setting
02:34 - up a class and getting started so I'm
02:36 - gonna jump into that as always if you
02:38 - guys have any questions please feel free
02:39 - to write them in and we'll try to answer
02:41 - them as we go and then have a big
02:42 - question and answer at the end and so
02:45 - I'm going to jump in and share my screen
02:48 - I wish you guys can see the setup that
02:55 - we have so Hannah doesn't actually have
02:58 - a standing desk we have her monitor like
03:02 - up on her trash can right now so I'm
03:05 - really gonna go great crazy setup that
03:10 - we whipped up the last minute so that we
03:12 - can be standing but yeah it's working
03:14 - out really nice so far then modernism
03:18 - toppling over okay all right um so we
03:24 - are in this is your teacher dashboard
03:26 - I'm guessing most of you have seen this
03:29 - before if you have it you can register
03:31 - for a free teacher - a free teacher
03:33 - account on our website so once you're in
03:37 - I'm going to talk through really quickly
03:39 - how to add a class that is the first
03:41 - step to teaching with codable so though
03:44 - you can click this add class button and
03:47 - yes one second can you switch so that
03:50 - it's the full screen who's right name
03:53 - yes but we're not even there so okay
03:56 - here we go see hopefully that helped out
03:58 - yeah awesome I'm just gonna wait to make
04:03 - sure that we're all set up thank you
04:07 - perfect um so we are in our class class
04:11 - creation page so what I'm going to title
04:14 - this class webinar but you can name it
04:17 - whatever you need for your students
04:19 - there's also advanced options to import
04:22 - your
04:23 - in bulk through Google classroom and
04:25 - there's a clever link as well so we can
04:28 - continue on I'm going to add some
04:31 - students so I will add Hannah Gretchen
04:34 - and Bree as students for my class save
04:38 - and continue now the class code is the
04:41 - way that your students will be able to
04:43 - log in and use quotable so there are
04:46 - there is a video giving you a tip on how
04:48 - to create a class code basically we just
04:50 - want this to be easy to remember and
04:52 - something that your students will be
04:56 - able to remember so I'm going to give it
04:59 - webinar 2 as my class code save and
05:02 - continue' you can also choose to use
05:05 - some of these suggested class codes if
05:09 - you want to just to make things easier
05:11 - for yourself if you decide to make to
05:13 - use one of those but then you decide to
05:15 - change it you can always change it from
05:16 - your class page absolutely so once you
05:20 - have your class set up that's kind of
05:22 - the first big thing you need to get onto
05:24 - your teacher dashboard after this you
05:28 - can pretty easily jump right into
05:30 - teaching with codable you just need to
05:33 - get your students logged in to play so
05:37 - doing that is very simple you'll just
05:39 - click on the button that says student
05:41 - instructions student instructions are
05:44 - going to generate a page here that you
05:50 - can see that will give your students all
05:53 - the instructions they need to use the
05:55 - classic code you just created to play
05:58 - with codable so they will just need to
06:01 - open codable either through the iPad app
06:04 - or through the web at a notable com they
06:08 - are going to enter their class code that
06:10 - you just created and that's super easy
06:13 - because each student is going to be
06:15 - given a unique code card so it has their
06:20 - name on it you can see these are the
06:21 - students I just entered for my class as
06:23 - well as the class code it's right there
06:25 - super easy to see there's also a parent
06:28 - code on these code cards if students
06:30 - want to continue playing at home and
06:31 - we're going to get into a little bit
06:33 - about
06:33 - sharing with parents a bit later one
06:36 - thing to note is that if you are using
06:40 - iPads when you download this class you
06:43 - only have to enter the class code once
06:46 - it'll just download that class roster
06:49 - and then whenever kids come back to the
06:52 - app all you need to do is like tap on
06:54 - the class and the tap on their name so
06:57 - entering the class code is only
06:58 - something you have to do once on the
06:59 - iPad um so once you have once your
07:03 - students have class code it's very easy
07:06 - for them to start playing with codable
07:09 - and I'm just going to show you how easy
07:10 - that would be so you've set up your
07:12 - class and you've created a class code
07:14 - your students are going to access game
07:17 - decodable comm or the iPad app they'll
07:21 - click on the button that says enter
07:22 - class code and this is where you will
07:25 - enter the code again that was on their
07:29 - code cards this is webinar 2 so when
07:33 - they enter their class code they are
07:35 - then prompted to choose their name from
07:37 - the class roster so I'm going to choose
07:40 - to play as Hana and it will take them
07:46 - right into the codable game so again we
07:50 - did that in about five minutes
07:52 - setting up the class generating the
07:54 - class code and then having your students
07:57 - log in once they have the link to play
07:59 - and so right now I'm just gonna go
08:01 - through one lesson in codable so for
08:05 - those of you that haven't seen it before
08:07 - or experienced it too much and you can
08:10 - see what it's all about and so when your
08:14 - students log in for the first time this
08:16 - is exactly what they will see so they
08:22 - will be prompted to meet blue fuzz you
08:27 - can see the code syntax showing up as
08:31 - they are dragging the different parts
08:34 - and then they are into fuzz topia so
08:37 - again this is exactly what your students
08:39 - will see when they're playing the game
08:41 - for
08:41 - those of you that are new and they would
08:46 - be brought to this hope the dashboard
08:48 - where they will click go and these are
08:51 - our three worlds in codable Smee Borg
08:54 - asteroid and bug world and we're gonna
08:56 - get into the lessons and a little bit
09:00 - more about great pacing when we dive
09:03 - into the dashboard a little bit later
09:05 - but I'm just going to show you if you're
09:07 - starting for the first time what your
09:09 - students would see if they click on Sea
09:12 - Org so they will start at level one and
09:16 - you can see if that level one is
09:17 - unlocked the first thing that happens in
09:22 - Smee Borg is they are going to meet us
09:25 - but as I'm just going to fast-forward
09:27 - through on the introductory video so you
09:29 - guys can see the lesson here but they're
09:32 - given a little tutorial of how Smee
09:35 - board works so sweet work is really
09:37 - trying to teach it's trying to teach
09:42 - sequence conditions loops and functions
09:45 - but it starts with a very basic tutorial
09:49 - of how to input code commands to get
09:56 - your Fuzz through the techno Me's to the
09:59 - end and so I you can see that I dragged
10:02 - in different arrow commands I would move
10:04 - my foot through the maze and I'm going
10:06 - to click go on oh yeah yeah umm so above
10:09 - thingy the play button you guys see this
10:11 - adorable little I character I mean is
10:14 - buzz-buzz and this is our our new hint
10:17 - system that we just added this school
10:19 - year we added it early at this summer
10:21 - but it's really nice there's a face of
10:24 - three hints that students can get if
10:26 - they're struggling they're gonna be
10:28 - prompted to get a hint after 30 seconds
10:31 - if they need it
10:32 - so we've tested it with a bunch of kids
10:34 - and it's surprise I was I was a little
10:36 - worried oh they're just gonna hit hints
10:38 - every time but I've seen a lot of them
10:40 - actually like really like to try before
10:43 - they hit get the hint and it's only
10:45 - going to give them a portion of the
10:47 - correct answer so they're still
10:51 - constructive struggle that's happening
10:53 - but you can read more about it on our
10:56 - help center support quotable calm if you
10:59 - have any questions feel free to let us
11:00 - know or feedback honestly because it's
11:03 - new yeah so after your students have
11:06 - input the code commands that they need
11:09 - to get their folks to the means they'll
11:10 - click go you can see the different
11:14 - commands are lighting up as they move to
11:16 - the level and then they'll move on to
11:18 - the next lesson so that is just a really
11:21 - quick snapshot of what's new board looks
11:24 - like and what your students would be
11:27 - doing for the first time that they log
11:30 - into the game I am back on my teacher
11:32 - dashboard now and I want to show you
11:34 - something that we've newly moved to the
11:37 - left side of your dashboard which is
11:39 - called teacher demo mode I'm holding my
11:42 - mouse over it right now it's with this
11:43 - green game controller so we just went
11:47 - through what your students would
11:48 - experience the first time that they are
11:50 - playing if you are on your teacher
11:52 - dashboard and you want to play a level
11:56 - to see what your students would be doing
11:58 - that day or remind yourself what is
12:00 - happening in Seaborg you can actually
12:03 - play every single codable level by
12:06 - clicking on teacher demo mode this is
12:08 - codable unlocked and it's something that
12:10 - when I'm talking to teachers not
12:13 - everyone has heard of or used before I
12:15 - think it's incredibly helpful when
12:17 - you're planning but I'm just gonna
12:19 - quickly click on it it is codable
12:22 - unlocked so all levels are open for you
12:25 - to play in Snee Borg asteroid eeeh and
12:28 - bug world
12:29 - so if you want to learn a little bit
12:31 - about what your students would be doing
12:33 - this is the place to go and you'll see
12:35 - that everything is unlocked on the sides
12:38 - including the game levels when you click
12:41 - on the treehouse in the middle I'm just
12:43 - going to take a moment right now we have
12:45 - this open to tilt I guess some of you
12:48 - this is all very new but to a lot of you
12:50 - you're like what in the world is this so
12:52 - we spend so much time the summer at
12:55 - creating fuzzy copia which is the new
12:57 - like home planet of the fuzzes we've
13:00 - been we've been following their
13:01 - adventures
13:02 - years and years but and now we get to
13:04 - see their home planet and this is going
13:06 - to be the hub for all your students work
13:09 - so they can go to the tree house to
13:12 - select their mission which is right over
13:14 - to the for the game levels they can go
13:16 - to make mazes over here in this little
13:19 - maze maker Hut they can go to build
13:23 - their own fuzz in the fuzz build or a
13:25 - tree house and then they can go make
13:28 - their own games in the game maker game
13:31 - designer garden there's so much
13:33 - happening here you're gonna be adding a
13:35 - lot to this over the coming school year
13:37 - it's a great way to like keep students
13:39 - engaged so they can see their worth
13:41 - building soon they're going to be able
13:42 - to kind of customize the way that this
13:44 - looks and we have some really exciting
13:46 - plans for fuzz topia for the our code
13:49 - this year but one thing that's really
13:51 - cool is that this will sync between what
13:53 - students are doing at home and at school
13:55 - so if those if your students go home and
13:59 - their parents are thrilled that they're
14:01 - learning to code and they decide to go
14:02 - ahead and get a codable for parents
14:05 - account those are different levels it's
14:08 - not going to interfere with what you're
14:09 - doing at school but this will sync up
14:12 - between the two accounts so kids have
14:14 - some sort of continuity between what
14:16 - they're doing at school what they're
14:17 - doing at home and they can really like
14:19 - invest in collecting all of their fuzzes
14:21 - and managing all their creations and I'm
14:24 - really go hog-wild with all the cool
14:26 - things that they can do the last thing
14:29 - to point out is that the little Hart
14:32 - house over here and that actually is
14:34 - where they're going to collect all their
14:36 - badges and achievements and everything
14:40 - that they've been working so hard for
14:41 - and codable will be collected in that
14:43 - little house so yeah there was a lot of
14:46 - exciting things that we've updated in
14:48 - the game I hope you guys like this I
14:49 - just wanted to point this out because I
14:51 - know some of you are gonna come in on
14:52 - the first day of school open up your
14:54 - eyes oh my god so here you go
14:58 - a quick little tour of Suns topia yeah I
15:01 - just also wanted to point out I'm seeing
15:03 - a lot of comments that are saying that
15:04 - you used to create a student like a fake
15:07 - teacher account as a student to go
15:09 - through the game hi here
15:10 - you this is a lot easier and it's always
15:12 - right here on your teacher dashboard if
15:15 - you need to use it it's also I think
15:17 - somebody pointed out it's a great way to
15:19 - demo a lesson to students if you want to
15:21 - play alongside them so that's another
15:23 - use for it so at this point I'm just
15:26 - gonna pause really quick we've gone
15:28 - through setting up a class getting
15:31 - students logged in and then seeing what
15:33 - students might be learning through the
15:35 - teacher demo mode are there any
15:36 - questions and that we can address right
15:39 - now before we move forward to the rest
15:41 - of the dashboard
15:42 - um no questions and I can see so far I
15:45 - look I'll give people a minute to write
15:48 - those in it they have them but I did
15:49 - want to address
15:50 - Deborah Kirby actually made a really
15:52 - good point show saying it'd be helpful
15:54 - if we could know everything like a text
15:56 - pop-up or something to know what it is
15:59 - on post ouvea and I totally agree I
16:04 - think we're going to be adding some
16:07 - support documents for Fuzz topia so that
16:11 - you know everything that's going on
16:13 - there you can always check support dr.
16:15 - kovac on we have help articles for just
16:17 - about everything but yeah that's a good
16:19 - point maybe we should add something in
16:21 - teacher materials
16:22 - to cover that your students however are
16:25 - going to be guided through Fuzz topia so
16:27 - nothing is going to be unlocked when
16:29 - they start and then as they progress
16:31 - through the game because they're
16:33 - learning new concepts those buildings
16:36 - those tree houses and all the different
16:37 - areas will unlock for them and kind of
16:39 - give them a tutorial on how to use it
16:41 - what they're going to be doing and so
16:43 - like we actually changed a little bit of
16:45 - how things are unlocked first for kids
16:47 - so once they unlock the fuzz builder for
16:51 - example it'll pop up here they'll unlock
16:53 - the building and then they'll start
16:55 - collecting costumes and decorations for
16:58 - their fuzzes as they're continuing
17:01 - through codable so it's going to be like
17:03 - a gradual process where we introduce
17:05 - students to it but I totally agree w I
17:07 - need something for teachers to know like
17:09 - what more old are all these building
17:11 - that's a great
17:12 - yeah yeah definitely okay so there's no
17:17 - one question can I make a cart back-end
17:20 - or my asks can I make a hard copy of the
17:22 - fuzz Tokyo page I would it would be
17:25 - great if I had a list of what each place
17:27 - oh so I we've got an idea I think we'll
17:32 - make some sort of a map I mean we'll put
17:34 - it in our help center but then we can
17:36 - also send it out to you guys as a
17:38 - resource but some sort of a map with
17:39 - everything labeled and a short
17:41 - description would just be a really good
17:43 - thing to have since it is new for a lot
17:45 - of teachers yeah
17:46 - all right feedback in the Marigny yeah
17:48 - so we've gone through teacher demo mode
17:50 - the next part of the webinar that I'm
17:53 - gonna walk through is how you can use
17:55 - your teacher - or to manage your classes
17:58 - we've got a lot of really great
17:59 - questions thank you to those of you who
18:01 - RSVP'd and wrote in questions about
18:03 - managing classes and I'm gonna try to
18:06 - address them all now and then we'll
18:07 - cover what we don't address in the Q&A
18:10 - so when you get into your teacher
18:12 - dashboard you'll always select the class
18:14 - that you're looking to teach for that
18:16 - day if you can remember back at the
18:18 - beginning I created my webinar class so
18:20 - that's what I'm going to click on to use
18:23 - as I walk through these features at the
18:25 - top of your dashboard these ones at the
18:27 - top here where I'm driving my mouse
18:29 - these are linked to your specific class
18:33 - that you just chose so I am on webinar
18:35 - class and the first thing I'm going to
18:37 - talk about is assignments so assignments
18:41 - is basically the way that we describe
18:44 - how which levels of the game your
18:47 - students are able to plan you will see
18:50 - that if you selected k5 as your grade
18:54 - then everyone whether or not you
18:58 - selected k5 or not potable automatically
19:01 - assigns levels if you don't want your
19:04 - students to be able to play a specific
19:06 - level all you need to do is click on
19:10 - assign that means that when your
19:12 - students log in to the game they will
19:15 - not be able to play the level that you
19:17 - have unassigned if all levels are
19:20 - assigned
19:21 - you give them the class code and they
19:23 - log in they will be able to move through
19:26 - the levels at their own pace without
19:29 - ever being stopped at any point so I
19:33 - point out the assignments tab has a
19:35 - really useful way for teachers to
19:38 - control how quickly their students are
19:40 - moving through the game and kind of use
19:43 - that as a tool to shape your lesson
19:46 - plans so if you are interested in just
19:50 - having students do one set of levels a
19:53 - day because you are also teaching other
19:55 - content in your class you can unassign
19:58 - the other levels students will only be
20:01 - able to play the ones that are lit up in
20:03 - green and then the next day you can
20:05 - assign the next level I do actually
20:09 - if you can you just show that you'll
20:11 - need to click but over here on this side
20:13 - tab you actually have like a global
20:15 - assignments page that you can use if you
20:18 - want to assign things to multiple
20:20 - classes you don't have to go to each
20:21 - class page you can actually just go to
20:23 - this assignments page and assign to all
20:26 - classes or to just like say you want to
20:29 - have all your third grade classes on the
20:31 - same pacing you can just assign it to
20:33 - all your third grade classes that's a
20:34 - great place to go to do that so there's
20:37 - there's two different ways that you can
20:38 - do this awesome
20:40 - Elmo so this is the assignments tab like
20:42 - I said I'm going to move forward into
20:45 - the lessons tab again these are lessons
20:48 - that codable recommends based on the
20:52 - grades that you selected when you
20:54 - created your class so when I set up my
20:57 - webinar class I selected k5 as my grade
21:00 - band quotable is then going to recommend
21:04 - curriculum recommend lessons that are
21:07 - appropriate for that grade level so if I
21:10 - have selected only kindergarten classes
21:12 - these lessons would look different there
21:15 - would be fewer lessons in some of these
21:17 - trickier units as you get into a some
21:22 - more advanced content it would it paces
21:25 - it for you but you can always edit the
21:28 - grade levels that you've selected and
21:31 - then that
21:31 - will impact the pacing that codable
21:34 - recommends you show them that oh yeah
21:37 - absolutely so right now I'm k5 I'm just
21:40 - going to edit my class setting which is
21:43 - over here I'm going to select
21:44 - kindergarten just as an example going to
21:48 - save my changes and then when I head
21:52 - back to lessons you'll see that a lot of
21:55 - those units that were covering some more
21:58 - advanced content are gone so
22:00 - kindergarten has these units sequence
22:03 - and conditions with the accompanying
22:05 - lessons that are appropriate for
22:07 - kindergarten now if you notice that your
22:10 - kindergarteners are moving through these
22:13 - lessons and they're doing a really great
22:15 - job and they are capable of taking on
22:17 - some trickier content always remember
22:20 - that you can edit the grade in your
22:22 - class settings k5 will give you access
22:25 - to everything since it covers all the
22:28 - grades and that will open up the rest of
22:32 - the units and the lessons um so I'm just
22:35 - going to dive into an example lesson if
22:39 - you guys have any questions again please
22:41 - feel free to write them in after this
22:43 - we'll take a pause and to answer some
22:44 - questions about assignments and lessons
22:46 - so I'm going to start at unit 1 sequence
22:50 - and the first lesson is introduction
22:53 - there were some questions that were
22:56 - written in about the difference between
23:00 - what is accessible on a free teacher
23:02 - account and then what is accessible on a
23:04 - paid account sequence one introduction
23:07 - is a lesson that's available to everyone
23:10 - who's watching here so what this is
23:13 - definitely a great place to look to see
23:15 - if our lessons that we provide would
23:17 - work for you and your students I'm just
23:19 - gonna walk through what the lesson holds
23:22 - so each lesson starts with a short
23:25 - description of the lesson it covers the
23:27 - objectives so for this first lesson
23:29 - students are going to be able to move a
23:32 - robot which is actually another
23:34 - classmate or a teacher to move across a
23:38 - room to perform different actions like
23:40 - spinning and jumping I'm using
23:42 - programming like
23:43 - so it then covers vocabulary and all of
23:48 - our vocabulary has been updated this
23:49 - year so definitions are a bit simpler
23:53 - um easier for younger students to
23:55 - understand which is great
23:56 - each lesson then moves into direct
23:59 - instruction so kind of the philosophy of
24:04 - these lessons is a gradual release model
24:07 - so we want it's kind of like an I do we
24:10 - do you do format so the I do is when you
24:14 - as the teacher are introducing a new
24:17 - concept and this is maybe you're going
24:20 - over new vocabulary you're asking
24:23 - students but they already know about the
24:25 - content that you're covering so for
24:28 - example in this first lesson we're
24:30 - talking about what is something a
24:32 - programmer might make on what do
24:34 - programmers do what how do they use code
24:37 - so it's really discussion based I'm
24:40 - going over an introduction of the
24:42 - content for the day the second section
24:45 - of each lesson is the guided practice
24:47 - activity that is the we do and these are
24:51 - unplugged activities that you can do
24:54 - with your students where they are
24:56 - getting a really hands-on tangible
24:59 - experience with the coding concept that
25:01 - you're introducing that day so in this
25:04 - example students are acting as
25:06 - programmers and they're applying
25:08 - knowledge of programming language and
25:10 - sequence to command a robot and I'm you
25:12 - can't see if I'm saying that in quotes
25:14 - because it's a it's another person to
25:16 - move forward and jump so again this is
25:19 - unplugged and every single lesson that
25:22 - you'll see on our teacher dashboard that
25:24 - we've created are hung flowed Plaisance
25:26 - for students to really get that hands-on
25:28 - experience first so they're learning
25:30 - about it in an unplugged hands-on way on
25:33 - the final section is actually the
25:38 - independent practice that's the you do
25:40 - section of the lesson where students are
25:43 - logging into codable and we recommend
25:45 - certain less levels themed levels to go
25:49 - with each lesson so in this example
25:52 - students are going to be logging into
25:54 - Smee Borg and they'll be clicking on the
25:56 - first set of levels in sequence these
25:59 - are directly tied to the sequence
26:02 - concepts that we just went over in the
26:05 - direct instruction and the guided
26:07 - practice activity each lesson then wraps
26:10 - up with a check for understanding these
26:12 - are usually group discussions maybe
26:14 - they're a short reflection for the
26:16 - student to participate in where they
26:18 - kind of sum up what it was learned that
26:20 - day
26:21 - are there any questions before we move
26:24 - on about these lessons because I know I
26:27 - just went over a lot of information
26:29 - there um we are getting lots of love
26:34 - people are so excited like oh my gosh
26:36 - this is made for me um so thank you guys
26:39 - I'm so happy that you all like this I
26:43 - did want to address so Scott was asking
26:45 - he's a parent um and they are curious
26:49 - about whether or not to use the parent
26:51 - or school version I would say for the
26:54 - vast majority like 99.9% of parents the
26:59 - parent version is what you want unless
27:01 - you are a home schooler or you are in
27:04 - some sort of like a cottage school
27:05 - situation I definitely recommend the
27:08 - parent version using colorful at home
27:10 - because our like program and pricing and
27:15 - everything is set up for like school
27:17 - users on the school version and the
27:20 - parent version likewise I set up for
27:22 - home use for use by a parent we are
27:26 - actually working on a lot of materials
27:28 - for parents this school year we just
27:31 - added progress tracking and for parents
27:33 - teachers actually you can share with
27:36 - that that parent code they don't even
27:38 - need a parents account to arlenian
27:40 - account that they don't need to like
27:42 - upgrade to the paid version to view what
27:44 - their kids are doing at school but if
27:46 - you choose to get the parent version
27:48 - you're gonna have access to progress
27:50 - tracking for both school and home and
27:52 - then we're working on a lot of these
27:54 - same materials for parents but in a
27:57 - better context like for what you're
28:01 - actually doing at home so like a lot of
28:03 - this stuff is set up for a class
28:05 - situation with multiple students like
28:08 - lots and lots of students in other cases
28:10 - and so for parents it's just best to
28:12 - stick with the parent version but if you
28:15 - are interested like say you are on one
28:16 - schooler or you do have an interest in
28:21 - using our school product at home please
28:24 - feel free to email me at Gretchen at
28:27 - Kohler Bolcom or support code will calm
28:30 - and we can chat with you about getting
28:33 - something set up for you so definitely
28:35 - do that but again I just want to
28:37 - reiterate the parent version is probably
28:39 - what you want to go with this absolutely
28:41 - okay so again this was the lesson and
28:45 - we'll go over what lesson library is in
28:47 - just a little bit and we're going to
28:49 - move on to student creations and
28:51 - actually Gretchen is going to talk about
28:53 - how you kind of just touched on it but
28:56 - if you want to say it again what we're
28:58 - doing to share student creations that
29:00 - students are creating in class with
29:02 - families yeah I'm gonna go put it and
29:05 - show you guys what you can see so when
29:08 - your students go we don't have any
29:10 - creation here we have a class that does
29:11 - yeah totally class of what I'm chick
29:14 - cave the k5 so when your students are
29:20 - unlocking those areas infos topia like a
29:23 - buzz builder and the maze maker and all
29:25 - these other sections of culpable they're
29:29 - gonna start creating their own closets
29:30 - and they're so cute I just love all the
29:33 - things that students make we actually do
29:35 - a feed of them like on the back side and
29:37 - go to and it's just adorable
29:39 - but um you can actually view them all
29:43 - from here and you can view the code that
29:44 - they wrote and then you can send this it
29:47 - prints a little PDF that you can send
29:50 - home to parents and actually if they go
29:54 - ahead and set up a global account at
29:55 - home they can view all of their child's
29:59 - creations from their parent dashboard
30:01 - and they can log in using the class code
30:05 - at home and play with their fusses or if
30:08 - they decide to get a parent account they
30:10 - and actually play with those buzzes at
30:13 - home as well so it's just really neat to
30:16 - be able to share everything that they're
30:18 - learning with their family the other
30:22 - thing that they can see are their mazes
30:25 - so in codable there's a way for students
30:28 - 1/3 yeah um so we actually have the
30:32 - option for kids to wonder when they're
30:34 - learning new concepts like saying
30:35 - they've they've gotten to conditions and
30:39 - they've sort of mastered conditions
30:40 - maze maker will unlock and they'll have
30:42 - the option to start making their own
30:44 - levels using conditions and then as they
30:47 - unlock loops they'll have the option to
30:49 - add a maze and create a maze that uses
30:51 - loops and it's really just so incredible
30:55 - through the things that kids come up
30:57 - with I used to make all of the levels I
30:59 - still make all of the levels in codable
31:01 - and I was like I know basically every
31:05 - like way that you can make a level
31:07 - uncodable so we did a maze native
31:09 - competition I guess like a year ago and
31:11 - I was blown away there were so many
31:13 - creative and just inspiring pieces that
31:16 - kids came up with so it's a great way to
31:18 - like assess how well they're
31:20 - understanding the concept but also just
31:22 - to get them thinking creatively using
31:24 - the design thinking process and learning
31:27 - about you know basically working
31:30 - backwards through a problem
31:31 - yeah absolutely so like Gretchen said
31:33 - these the creative applications can be
31:35 - used kind of as an informal assessment
31:38 - and when you're teaching to see how
31:40 - students are asking the concepts and
31:41 - actually applying them in a creative way
31:44 - um another tool that we have here for
31:47 - tracking student progress is the
31:49 - progress tab so we did get a couple
31:52 - questions written in on the RSVP that
31:54 - was asking about grades does codable
31:56 - give grades how do i grade this work um
32:00 - so that's going to be really dependent
32:02 - on you as a teacher but besides the
32:05 - informal assessments with these student
32:07 - creations you can use this progress tab
32:09 - to see their level of progress how far
32:13 - they are moving through the game so
32:15 - which concepts they're covering it you
32:18 - can see Alex my student here has
32:20 - finished si
32:22 - Wynn's alice is just starting and my
32:24 - other students are further behind so
32:26 - that's just a way for you to gauge how
32:28 - students are moving through the levels
32:30 - and which which concepts are mastering
32:32 - you also have this option to click on
32:34 - view standards progress and this is
32:37 - going to show you which computer science
32:40 - standards for each unit so for sequence
32:43 - conditions etc your students have
32:46 - started are working on or have mastered
32:50 - and these computer science standards if
32:53 - you go to codable Java Khan / outcomes
32:56 - you'll see how we put these computer
32:59 - science standards together for sequence
33:02 - they cover State Standards and other
33:07 - other computer science standards that
33:09 - we've put together to cover everything
33:12 - that you might need to be tracking for
33:14 - your school so again this progress tab
33:18 - it's covering in progress as well as
33:20 - standards progress and you can kind of
33:22 - use that information how you need to in
33:25 - order to provide grades about something
33:28 - you're interested in doing but we just
33:29 - wanted to give you the information here
33:31 - in case you may need it so before we
33:34 - move on I'll just point out that there
33:36 - are also tabs at the top here for
33:39 - students and for class settings both of
33:41 - these are useful for managing your class
33:44 - students you'll be able to see your
33:47 - class roster print their login
33:49 - instructions again and add students to
33:51 - your class and then class settings like
33:54 - I showed before is a good way to edit
33:56 - what grade your class is maybe you want
33:59 - to change the class code or assign the
34:01 - class to another teacher so that they
34:04 - can have the information for your class
34:07 - this is the place to do it there's also
34:09 - you can see this danger zone there are
34:12 - some things over here that you might
34:13 - need for resetting all student progress
34:15 - and other things like that if you have
34:18 - questions about this please let us know
34:20 - some of the stuff that I saw in the RSVP
34:24 - questions about transferring students
34:26 - we're going to go over when we talk
34:28 - about these tabs here on the left but we
34:31 - just went over all of the different
34:33 - features that codable teacher
34:35 - - word offers for managing a specific
34:38 - class are there any questions Richard
34:40 - that are that have been written in about
34:42 - the times that we covered so far really
34:47 - only just one question about what grades
34:50 - clinical is appropriate for so cloacal
34:52 - is focused on groups k25 we do have
34:55 - people who use it with younger students
34:57 - may be like pre-k or teaching students
35:00 - we also have people that use it in
35:02 - middle school it's their just introduced
35:04 - including to their kids for the first
35:05 - time obviously if you're using it with
35:08 - older students or younger students
35:09 - they're going to move at a different
35:10 - pace then what codable might like assume
35:15 - so if they're younger they may move a
35:17 - little bit slower or if they're older
35:19 - than even move a little bit faster and
35:22 - you can adjust everything from your
35:24 - assignments page based on what you see
35:26 - happening in your classroom so like I
35:29 - said you can totally manage using it
35:31 - with kids outside of those age ranges if
35:34 - you want to but yes it is primarily
35:36 - focused on K through 5 totally great so
35:42 - as we move on I'll direct your attention
35:45 - to this left menu on the side of your
35:48 - dashboard if you remember this is where
35:50 - we found teacher demo mode before the
35:52 - resources here on the left side of your
35:55 - dashboard are not linked to one specific
35:57 - class so this is where you want to go
35:59 - like arch and said if you're assigning
36:01 - to multiple classes at one time or you
36:05 - want to manage student transferring
36:07 - across multiple classes you'll go to
36:10 - this left side menu so I'm going to
36:13 - start with the lesson library we take in
36:17 - one quick question oh yeah so it knows
36:25 - asking if we have the option to add
36:28 - multiple like share a class by the
36:30 - teacher say you have a co teacher or
36:32 - something
36:32 - right now there's only one teacher per
36:34 - class but you can say you're on the
36:37 - codable school plan and you're an admin
36:41 - or like say you're the tech teacher for
36:43 - at school and there's a first-grade
36:44 - teacher who wants to add their class
36:47 - you can add teachers and assign them to
36:51 - a specific class if you are on a
36:53 - quotable school plan but for the basic
36:56 - free version there is no way to have
36:59 - multiple teachers and there's no way to
37:00 - have multiple teachers on a class in the
37:03 - school version either you would just
37:04 - view it as an admin and you would see
37:06 - all the classes and then that teacher
37:07 - would be assigned to it if you have
37:09 - questions about our admin tools please
37:12 - feel free to email me Gretchen at
37:15 - koat.com or Bree at coldwell comm we're
37:17 - happy to go over that with you children
37:20 - great so like I said we're moving into
37:24 - the lesson library the lesson library is
37:27 - the place where you can find lessons
37:30 - that are not linked to are not well
37:33 - they're not all linked to our core
37:35 - content there are a lot of them are
37:37 - supplementary that you can use to cover
37:39 - different content besides just the
37:43 - coding concepts that are covered in our
37:45 - core curriculum so for exists ill Terr
37:49 - feature on the left side it's kind of
37:51 - like what you would use if you were
37:53 - shopping where you know you're looking
37:55 - for and you can filter based on what
37:58 - you're looking for specifically so if I
38:00 - am interested in finding kindergarten
38:03 - lessons and let's say I want to cover
38:07 - the coding concept of sequence and then
38:11 - I can choose a content area let's say I
38:13 - really want to do an introduction to
38:15 - robotics unit the lesson library filters
38:19 - and offers you lessons that are directly
38:22 - linked to those features that you just
38:24 - filtered for um so this does bring up
38:26 - our robotics unit where we've partnered
38:29 - with Wonder workshop and the - and dot
38:32 - robots and you can click on these
38:35 - lessons again they're structured the
38:38 - same way that the lessons were when we
38:40 - went over them in the lessons tab where
38:42 - there are scripted and they cover
38:44 - everything you'll need to use to run the
38:47 - lesson if you find something in the
38:49 - lesson library that you want to teach
38:51 - you can click Save the lesson you'll
38:53 - choose the class that you want to save
38:56 - it for I'm and that will save right to
38:59 - your
38:59 - says dashboard so you won't need to go
39:01 - back into the Lawson library to find it
39:02 - again it'll be saved which is really
39:05 - nice so again visit these are a lot of
39:08 - these are supplementary lessons that you
39:12 - might want to use in other content areas
39:15 - not just coding but it shows you how
39:18 - coding concepts can be linked to all of
39:21 - these other content areas so for example
39:23 - if I'm interested in integrating a
39:26 - coding lesson into en la I can click
39:30 - English language arts the tab over here
39:32 - I'm and it'll filter into these lessons
39:34 - that I can click on to teach different
39:37 - things so definitely I recommend
39:39 - exploring this lesson library to see
39:42 - what is available to you you'll notice
39:45 - that there's a little quotable school
39:46 - icon on some of these that means that
39:48 - those lessons are just accessible to
39:51 - schools with the quotable school account
39:53 - but if it doesn't have the icon then
39:56 - it's open for you to click on and you
39:59 - can go through these lessons to see if
40:01 - it's something you'd want to integrate
40:03 - in your class and if it is a paid lesson
40:06 - you can actually view a preview FL so
40:09 - for those of you who are considering
40:11 - incredible school for your for your
40:13 - students you can get a view of what our
40:17 - paid lessons look like cool so the next
40:22 - look we kind of touched on assignments
40:25 - already so I'm not going to click on it
40:27 - but that's where you would want to go if
40:28 - you were assigning levels to multiple
40:31 - classes at once the students tab is what
40:35 - I want to go to now because we did get a
40:37 - lot of questions since there's a lot of
40:39 - teachers who are starting their school
40:41 - year and want to transfer students from
40:43 - one class to another maybe classes are
40:46 - moving up a grade and you want to
40:48 - transfer some students from the
40:50 - kindergarten class to the first grade
40:51 - class this is where you can do all of
40:54 - that really easily and transfer in bulk
40:56 - so I'll show you quickly if I wanted to
41:00 - transfer let's say I have some students
41:02 - in my first grade class who I want to
41:05 - transfer into my second grade class I
41:07 - would click on the students tab I would
41:10 - select the students
41:12 - that are in my first-grade class that I
41:15 - want to transfer you can select as many
41:19 - as you need and then there's this purple
41:21 - transfer selected students button I
41:24 - click on that there's a drop-down menu
41:27 - it's going to ask me which class I want
41:29 - to put them in so I want to transfer
41:31 - them to second grade I'm going to click
41:33 - on the second class and transfer
41:35 - students so it's that easy now you'll
41:38 - see that my two students here that were
41:41 - originally in first grade
41:42 - I've now transferred into second grade
41:45 - so this is the place you can go to do
41:47 - all of that transferring from one class
41:51 - to another which I know a lot of people
41:53 - were interested in so if there are any
41:56 - questions about transferring students in
41:59 - bulk let us know I'll pause right now to
42:02 - see if there's anything that we need I'm
42:08 - just like reading through the chat
42:09 - there's a lot of discussion and on the
42:11 - lesson library holiday it looks like
42:13 - we've answered all the questions people
42:18 - were asking like if they're on the game
42:20 - access plan of codable school would they
42:23 - have access to these lessons no you do
42:26 - not have access to all of the lessons in
42:29 - the lesson library if you're on the game
42:30 - access plan but you will have access to
42:32 - the free one so if if you're on if you
42:36 - have purchased the curriculum add-on and
42:38 - don't have access to these but if you
42:39 - don't then you'll just look at the
42:41 - quotable school icon but you'd have the
42:43 - ones that don't have that on it and then
42:45 - we have let's see oh people are asking
42:55 - if there will be a recorded version of
42:57 - the webinar and oh yes yeah definitely
43:00 - so if this is being recorded right now
43:02 - we'll be sure to have the final version
43:04 - posted after we're done so you can head
43:07 - on back to review anything we've talked
43:10 - about also I'm offering trainings for
43:13 - teachers during the start of this school
43:15 - year so if you want to walk through the
43:18 - dashboard again one-on-one and kind of
43:20 - go over just what you're interested
43:23 - or what you need more clarification on
43:24 - please reach out to me my email is Hana
43:27 - at potable comm and I'm happy to help
43:30 - you walk through that so someone was
43:32 - asking if there was an easy way to move
43:33 - students from first grade to second
43:35 - grade classes instead of putting all the
43:37 - names in again and I know you just went
43:39 - over that so I hope that that answered
43:41 - their question but I did want to be sure
43:44 - to address for people who are using
43:47 - either Google classroom or clever and
43:51 - soon class link actually really excited
43:54 - about um theirs
43:57 - so if you're using clever or class link
43:59 - I would assume I'm not as familiar with
44:00 - classic yet but codable will
44:03 - automatically update based on what you
44:05 - put into Kluber um if you are using if
44:11 - you're using Google classroom you will
44:13 - need to import your students again
44:15 - so you'd wipe out what you have is is
44:17 - seeing includable and then import them
44:19 - again it is not a two-way integration so
44:21 - it's not going to update live and if you
44:24 - aren't using either of those options
44:26 - then yes the class transfer the transfer
44:30 - selected students option that Hannah
44:32 - just showed you would be the way to go
44:35 - we do have bulk import built into the
44:39 - global dashboard when you're creating a
44:40 - class if you decide you wanted to start
44:42 - fresh and add all your students at once
44:44 - and say you have like 25 classes like so
44:47 - many of you do we have a bulk import
44:49 - option where you can just copy/paste
44:51 - your rosters from a spreadsheet and then
44:53 - I can eat the classes and stuff so
44:55 - that's really quick and easy to do if
44:57 - you don't have clever or some of the
45:00 - other options available to you so I am
45:04 - going to jump in a lot of you wrote in
45:07 - asking what is new what is new so I am
45:09 - going to show you what is new for
45:12 - teachers and Gretchen's gonna go over
45:14 - share to touch on a bunch of them but
45:16 - what is new for students so a big thing
45:19 - that is new that you guys I hope will
45:22 - love is the resource center it's at the
45:25 - top of this left menu and when you click
45:28 - on it this is where we are going to put
45:31 - all of our public resources everything
45:34 - you might need to teach with Co
45:36 - to show potable to your students to get
45:40 - started again so I'll just kind of walk
45:42 - through what is in the Resource Center
45:44 - there's the getting started kit that we
45:46 - had that was on the homepage when we
45:49 - logged in this getting started kit is
45:51 - going to be really helpful for those of
45:53 - you that want to know what codable is
45:56 - about what students are going to learn
45:58 - what content is going to be covered
46:01 - before actually using it with your
46:04 - students so there's three parts to the
46:06 - getting started kit there's a guy that
46:07 - is going to help you get set up with
46:10 - devices which we talked about with the
46:12 - code cards and then there's also an
46:15 - updated potable field guide and our
46:18 - updated scope and sequence so the
46:20 - codable field guide I think I actually
46:22 - have it up here this is a brand new
46:26 - guide that we've created that covers
46:28 - everything in codable that you might
46:32 - need to teach with it so it walks you
46:34 - through each of the three worlds what
46:36 - students are learning and what it will
46:38 - actually look like for them in the game
46:40 - it talks about our creative applications
46:43 - like we mentioned with building fuzzies
46:45 - and making mazes and then gives you a
46:48 - breakdown of our curriculum if that's
46:50 - something you're interested in using and
46:53 - some tips and tricks for how to
46:54 - implement the lessons
46:56 - so again if you're interested in
46:59 - learning more about codable what it's
47:00 - all about
47:01 - definitely check out this getting
47:03 - started kit it's in the resource center
47:05 - of your teacher dashboard and that
47:07 - includes our scope and sequence gesso so
47:10 - a lot of you have asked for scope and
47:12 - sequence over the years and we had one
47:14 - we didn't have a place to put it so I'm
47:16 - so happy we have this resource center
47:18 - because now all of those things that
47:20 - we've been creating over the years I'm
47:21 - just like sending the people over the
47:23 - automail are available here we're going
47:26 - to be adding a ton to this page over the
47:28 - next couple of months but yeah if you're
47:32 - looking for a scope and sequence check
47:34 - out the getting started kit it is in
47:35 - there so yeah yeah the other big thing
47:39 - that you probably see and are super
47:41 - excited about is we are starting to be
47:44 - staying answer keys so as a teacher we
47:47 - know that you know working through
47:50 - problems with your students is really
47:52 - important but sometimes you just get
47:54 - stuff and you need you feel like you
47:56 - need to know the answer to help this is
47:58 - the place to go so these are all the
48:01 - solutions for the smiie board lessons
48:03 - and we're working on asteroid iya and
48:05 - bug world as well and one think those
48:07 - are done they'll show up here in the
48:09 - answer keys of the Resource Center so
48:12 - these are all of this meatboy answer
48:14 - keys again right here Resource Center
48:17 - next to the getting started kit you can
48:19 - view the solutions there the other
48:23 - resources that are available in the
48:25 - Resource Center are the teacher guides
48:29 - teacher guides will walk you through all
48:32 - of this all of the content again that
48:34 - you are there students are learning in
48:37 - codable there are videos that are meant
48:40 - for you where you can watch them and
48:42 - learn more about the coding content if
48:45 - you are confused about any of the
48:46 - conditions or loops or any of the
48:48 - content that we're covering this is a
48:50 - place great place to go for you and then
48:52 - there are also classroom materials
48:54 - resources for your classroom posters you
48:57 - can pull it up and we're going to be
48:59 - adding to these all of the time so that
49:01 - is a quick overview of the Resource
49:03 - Center definitely poke around it's a
49:05 - great place well like Gretchen said
49:07 - we'll add to it a bunch can you show
49:09 - them one of the oh yeah so the end is
49:13 - actually working on updating all these
49:14 - but I do want to go ahead and show you
49:16 - so many people don't know that this
49:18 - exists and so I wanted to be sure to
49:20 - show everyone this is where you can go
49:24 - to learn about a concept before you
49:25 - teach it it sort of like codable for
49:28 - teachers so we talked about what see in
49:31 - this example this is our sequence guide
49:34 - what sequence is how it's used in
49:36 - programming some of the core like
49:38 - vocabulary vocabulary that you want to
49:41 - cover just explaining it to you in
49:44 - simple terms because I know so many of
49:47 - you don't have a background in computer
49:48 - science like oh these concepts are so
49:50 - new to me so we just wrote everything
49:52 - down in an easy-to-understand way so
49:56 - that you can
49:57 - speak with a little bit more confidence
49:58 - when you're talking to your students and
49:59 - answering their questions and then we'll
50:02 - address what codable is teaching
50:04 - on-screen and how it works and how it
50:07 - relates to what this concept actually is
50:10 - in programming okay it's not everything
50:15 - really wanting to hello I think I think
50:17 - that is everything that was a lot so if
50:20 - you guys have questions please ask them
50:22 - reach out to us this video again will be
50:25 - recorded so no need to memorize it all
50:27 - right now um so I'm gonna give a couple
50:30 - minutes for people to ask questions if
50:34 - they have them you can go over our Q&A
50:37 - document but yeah so but I did want to
50:44 - be sure to let you guys know we are
50:49 - going to be adding a lot less spoiler so
50:51 - if you have questions you can always
50:53 - reach out to us at support at codable
50:55 - comm we also are doing a lot of work on
50:59 - our YouTube channel looking to add a lot
51:01 - more content there for you and for
51:04 - students and for parents so if you want
51:07 - to subscribe to our youtube channel just
51:09 - click the subscribe button somewhere on
51:12 - the screen up right below and you'll get
51:15 - updates about men we post new content
51:18 - we're also going to be doing a lot for
51:21 - parents this year so if you want to
51:23 - share that code card or any of your
51:27 - students creations with them that way
51:29 - you can be sure that they're staying
51:31 - updated on what's happening in your
51:33 - classroom and they're gonna be getting a
51:35 - lot of really cool new features this
51:37 - year as well um so let me see if we have
51:39 - any question great okay so they all had
51:46 - a question about Australia and
51:48 - connecting the concept of strings and
51:50 - colored a color glass sure as you shoot
51:52 - at this level seems hard put together
51:54 - can you explain a little bit of like
51:58 - what the connection is or do you want me
52:00 - to about what's happening on screen and
52:03 - then also where you can find more
52:05 - materials on like what's actually going
52:08 - on on screen yeah well so to find
52:10 - materials that will be in the resource
52:12 - center and that we were just on and if
52:15 - you go to those teacher guides there is
52:18 - a teacher guide for string variables
52:20 - array and Ruby variables and what am I
52:24 - forgetting
52:24 - strings arrays integers integers so
52:28 - there's guys for all of those and
52:29 - epidemic it shows you the screen
52:31 - captures of the actual game and talks
52:33 - through those how those concepts are
52:36 - being applied do you want to give a
52:38 - little bit of background about it um I'm
52:42 - sorry I was reading I'm like how how the
52:46 - how the link between the game and the
52:49 - variables oh yeah yeah so basically
52:51 - what's happening when you are assigning
52:53 - a variable of property or sorry
52:56 - assigning a variable of value in
52:59 - programming you need to use you need to
53:04 - make sure that there that you're either
53:06 - using a string which is a string of
53:08 - characters so we use colors represent
53:11 - that so it appears on the screen as
53:13 - purple written out so kids are learning
53:16 - like what the value types are in in
53:20 - coding when you're using variables
53:23 - there's those three different types
53:24 - there's also integers which is just a
53:27 - number and then there's arrays which can
53:29 - be a list of items it can be either a
53:32 - string or an integer and so for our idea
53:36 - we're really just trying to get them
53:37 - familiar with variable types and also
53:40 - like assigning value to things and then
53:42 - the game is the great way to hook them a
53:44 - awesome way to make sure that those
53:47 - concepts are hitting home and if
53:50 - students are really grasping like what a
53:52 - variable is is to progress them into the
53:55 - game designer as they're moving through
53:57 - our idea they're going to unlock
53:58 - properties which are just another name
54:01 - for variables within the game designer
54:04 - and they can actually start creating and
54:06 - designing their filling game and
54:07 - modifying properties within the code to
54:10 - make adjustments either to make it
54:12 - easier or harder or like a different
54:15 - flair to it
54:16 - so we have a really cool project where
54:18 - you can team students up to talk about
54:22 - like what kind of game they want and
54:24 - can make a game suitable for their
54:25 - partner and then they get feedback and
54:27 - to iterate on their design so there's a
54:29 - lot of stuff happening with variables
54:31 - within asteroid yeah but I would
54:34 - definitely be sure to check out the
54:35 - resources that cover all of that so that
54:37 - you can um talk about it with your
54:40 - students yeah and you can also reach out
54:42 - to us anytime you have questions always
54:48 - yes so they will practice they'll ask
54:50 - people if they practice these concepts
54:52 - when they build yes okay I don't see any
54:58 - other questions coming in so yeah if you
55:05 - guys need anything or we're going to
55:07 - share actually last thing on my cover
55:09 - we're gonna share all the resources of
55:11 - resources that we talked about in the
55:15 - description below this video after the
55:17 - fact I'm going to add a timestamp to
55:19 - some of the sections that we covered so
55:21 - that we can be sure to make this useful
55:24 - for people after the fact so you want to
55:26 - come back and you're like what was that
55:27 - thing they said you can come back and
55:29 - look through and see the resources and
55:32 - jump to a section of the video so thank
55:35 - you all so much I wanna you we're so
55:37 - psyched for this school year we have big
55:39 - plans and we love hearing all of your
55:41 - feedback so please please please keep us
55:44 - updated on that yeah and we love seeing
55:46 - all of your happy smiling faces and your
55:48 - students faces um this school year it's
55:51 - one of the things that keeps us
55:52 - motivated so we actually have a channel
55:54 - like in our team slack where we can see
55:57 - like what's happening on Twitter and who
55:58 - knows so if you want to share with us
56:00 - what's going on in your classroom if you
56:02 - have permission to do that please do
56:04 - that we love love love seeing what's
56:06 - going on so um thank you all so much for
56:09 - watching thank say Hanna but you know
56:11 - someone I come yeah thank you to those
56:13 - of you that have been commenting and
56:14 - giving tips and tricks tricks to other
56:16 - teachers that's so great and really
56:19 - brings together equitable community so
56:21 - thank you that you guys's we'll talk to
56:23 - you soon yep please reach out to us
56:25 - we're happy to talk alright everybody
56:27 - thanks again talk to you soon have a
56:29 - good
56:29 - thank you bye

Cleaned transcript:

good morning I'm Gretchen we're the founders of codable this is Hannah and I recently joined our team early this summer that she recently she's our instructional coach at global so a lot of you may have talked to her this summer we've been doing some training calls with her she's doing a great job she was making some amazing resources you will find we'll cover some of them in this webinar but you'll find the money on your dashboard um she was a computer science teacher in an elementary school and then went back to school at Harvard where she was studying technology innovation in education and she was also working in their creative computing lab there for a little bit she's just super knowledgeable we're so lucky having um and so she's going to be joining us she's gonna be leaving most of this so you guys can get familiar with Hannah um if you have any questions as we're going through things we have a live chat on the side you can push your question there we're going to be checking in with that as we go and breathe I'm sure many of you know BRE she is going to be monitoring questions and answering any of them as they come up if she can so we're so excited to have you all if you have questions feel free to post them we're going to cover so I'm just going to give you a rundown of all the things you're going to talk about we're gonna cover getting started with codable so many of you all are new yeah thank you to everybody who RSVP'd and told us a little bit about if you can use Google before I was so blown away it's so exciting to have so many newbies and then some of you guys are coming back for the second time or third time I think gosh this points like seven years I think so um we're gonna cover all of the exciting things we added this summer we've been making a lot of changes on the parent side of coda well they're going to affect some of the things you're doing at school we're also we've also been adding a lot of resources on your teacher dashboard so we're going to get to some of that today so yeah let's get started I'm so excited to have you back to school everybody yeah have you back to school so my kitchen said the goal of this webinar is really for all of you to feel comfortable teaching your first class with codable this year whether that's your first class ever or your just your first class this year because your students are new and so we're gonna jump in I'm going to broadcast my teacher dashboard to you guys and walk through some things that are new and then the basics for setting up a class and getting started so I'm gonna jump into that as always if you guys have any questions please feel free to write them in and we'll try to answer them as we go and then have a big question and answer at the end and so I'm going to jump in and share my screen I wish you guys can see the setup that we have so Hannah doesn't actually have a standing desk we have her monitor like up on her trash can right now so I'm really gonna go great crazy setup that we whipped up the last minute so that we can be standing but yeah it's working out really nice so far then modernism toppling over okay all right um so we are in this is your teacher dashboard I'm guessing most of you have seen this before if you have it you can register for a free teacher a free teacher account on our website so once you're in I'm going to talk through really quickly how to add a class that is the first step to teaching with codable so though you can click this add class button and yes one second can you switch so that it's the full screen who's right name yes but we're not even there so okay here we go see hopefully that helped out yeah awesome I'm just gonna wait to make sure that we're all set up thank you perfect um so we are in our class class creation page so what I'm going to title this class webinar but you can name it whatever you need for your students there's also advanced options to import your in bulk through Google classroom and there's a clever link as well so we can continue on I'm going to add some students so I will add Hannah Gretchen and Bree as students for my class save and continue now the class code is the way that your students will be able to log in and use quotable so there are there is a video giving you a tip on how to create a class code basically we just want this to be easy to remember and something that your students will be able to remember so I'm going to give it webinar 2 as my class code save and continue' you can also choose to use some of these suggested class codes if you want to just to make things easier for yourself if you decide to make to use one of those but then you decide to change it you can always change it from your class page absolutely so once you have your class set up that's kind of the first big thing you need to get onto your teacher dashboard after this you can pretty easily jump right into teaching with codable you just need to get your students logged in to play so doing that is very simple you'll just click on the button that says student instructions student instructions are going to generate a page here that you can see that will give your students all the instructions they need to use the classic code you just created to play with codable so they will just need to open codable either through the iPad app or through the web at a notable com they are going to enter their class code that you just created and that's super easy because each student is going to be given a unique code card so it has their name on it you can see these are the students I just entered for my class as well as the class code it's right there super easy to see there's also a parent code on these code cards if students want to continue playing at home and we're going to get into a little bit about sharing with parents a bit later one thing to note is that if you are using iPads when you download this class you only have to enter the class code once it'll just download that class roster and then whenever kids come back to the app all you need to do is like tap on the class and the tap on their name so entering the class code is only something you have to do once on the iPad um so once you have once your students have class code it's very easy for them to start playing with codable and I'm just going to show you how easy that would be so you've set up your class and you've created a class code your students are going to access game decodable comm or the iPad app they'll click on the button that says enter class code and this is where you will enter the code again that was on their code cards this is webinar 2 so when they enter their class code they are then prompted to choose their name from the class roster so I'm going to choose to play as Hana and it will take them right into the codable game so again we did that in about five minutes setting up the class generating the class code and then having your students log in once they have the link to play and so right now I'm just gonna go through one lesson in codable so for those of you that haven't seen it before or experienced it too much and you can see what it's all about and so when your students log in for the first time this is exactly what they will see so they will be prompted to meet blue fuzz you can see the code syntax showing up as they are dragging the different parts and then they are into fuzz topia so again this is exactly what your students will see when they're playing the game for those of you that are new and they would be brought to this hope the dashboard where they will click go and these are our three worlds in codable Smee Borg asteroid and bug world and we're gonna get into the lessons and a little bit more about great pacing when we dive into the dashboard a little bit later but I'm just going to show you if you're starting for the first time what your students would see if they click on Sea Org so they will start at level one and you can see if that level one is unlocked the first thing that happens in Smee Borg is they are going to meet us but as I'm just going to fastforward through on the introductory video so you guys can see the lesson here but they're given a little tutorial of how Smee board works so sweet work is really trying to teach it's trying to teach sequence conditions loops and functions but it starts with a very basic tutorial of how to input code commands to get your Fuzz through the techno Me's to the end and so I you can see that I dragged in different arrow commands I would move my foot through the maze and I'm going to click go on oh yeah yeah umm so above thingy the play button you guys see this adorable little I character I mean is buzzbuzz and this is our our new hint system that we just added this school year we added it early at this summer but it's really nice there's a face of three hints that students can get if they're struggling they're gonna be prompted to get a hint after 30 seconds if they need it so we've tested it with a bunch of kids and it's surprise I was I was a little worried oh they're just gonna hit hints every time but I've seen a lot of them actually like really like to try before they hit get the hint and it's only going to give them a portion of the correct answer so they're still constructive struggle that's happening but you can read more about it on our help center support quotable calm if you have any questions feel free to let us know or feedback honestly because it's new yeah so after your students have input the code commands that they need to get their folks to the means they'll click go you can see the different commands are lighting up as they move to the level and then they'll move on to the next lesson so that is just a really quick snapshot of what's new board looks like and what your students would be doing for the first time that they log into the game I am back on my teacher dashboard now and I want to show you something that we've newly moved to the left side of your dashboard which is called teacher demo mode I'm holding my mouse over it right now it's with this green game controller so we just went through what your students would experience the first time that they are playing if you are on your teacher dashboard and you want to play a level to see what your students would be doing that day or remind yourself what is happening in Seaborg you can actually play every single codable level by clicking on teacher demo mode this is codable unlocked and it's something that when I'm talking to teachers not everyone has heard of or used before I think it's incredibly helpful when you're planning but I'm just gonna quickly click on it it is codable unlocked so all levels are open for you to play in Snee Borg asteroid eeeh and bug world so if you want to learn a little bit about what your students would be doing this is the place to go and you'll see that everything is unlocked on the sides including the game levels when you click on the treehouse in the middle I'm just going to take a moment right now we have this open to tilt I guess some of you this is all very new but to a lot of you you're like what in the world is this so we spend so much time the summer at creating fuzzy copia which is the new like home planet of the fuzzes we've been we've been following their adventures years and years but and now we get to see their home planet and this is going to be the hub for all your students work so they can go to the tree house to select their mission which is right over to the for the game levels they can go to make mazes over here in this little maze maker Hut they can go to build their own fuzz in the fuzz build or a tree house and then they can go make their own games in the game maker game designer garden there's so much happening here you're gonna be adding a lot to this over the coming school year it's a great way to like keep students engaged so they can see their worth building soon they're going to be able to kind of customize the way that this looks and we have some really exciting plans for fuzz topia for the our code this year but one thing that's really cool is that this will sync between what students are doing at home and at school so if those if your students go home and their parents are thrilled that they're learning to code and they decide to go ahead and get a codable for parents account those are different levels it's not going to interfere with what you're doing at school but this will sync up between the two accounts so kids have some sort of continuity between what they're doing at school what they're doing at home and they can really like invest in collecting all of their fuzzes and managing all their creations and I'm really go hogwild with all the cool things that they can do the last thing to point out is that the little Hart house over here and that actually is where they're going to collect all their badges and achievements and everything that they've been working so hard for and codable will be collected in that little house so yeah there was a lot of exciting things that we've updated in the game I hope you guys like this I just wanted to point this out because I know some of you are gonna come in on the first day of school open up your eyes oh my god so here you go a quick little tour of Suns topia yeah I just also wanted to point out I'm seeing a lot of comments that are saying that you used to create a student like a fake teacher account as a student to go through the game hi here you this is a lot easier and it's always right here on your teacher dashboard if you need to use it it's also I think somebody pointed out it's a great way to demo a lesson to students if you want to play alongside them so that's another use for it so at this point I'm just gonna pause really quick we've gone through setting up a class getting students logged in and then seeing what students might be learning through the teacher demo mode are there any questions and that we can address right now before we move forward to the rest of the dashboard um no questions and I can see so far I look I'll give people a minute to write those in it they have them but I did want to address Deborah Kirby actually made a really good point show saying it'd be helpful if we could know everything like a text popup or something to know what it is on post ouvea and I totally agree I think we're going to be adding some support documents for Fuzz topia so that you know everything that's going on there you can always check support dr. kovac on we have help articles for just about everything but yeah that's a good point maybe we should add something in teacher materials to cover that your students however are going to be guided through Fuzz topia so nothing is going to be unlocked when they start and then as they progress through the game because they're learning new concepts those buildings those tree houses and all the different areas will unlock for them and kind of give them a tutorial on how to use it what they're going to be doing and so like we actually changed a little bit of how things are unlocked first for kids so once they unlock the fuzz builder for example it'll pop up here they'll unlock the building and then they'll start collecting costumes and decorations for their fuzzes as they're continuing through codable so it's going to be like a gradual process where we introduce students to it but I totally agree w I need something for teachers to know like what more old are all these building that's a great yeah yeah definitely okay so there's no one question can I make a cart backend or my asks can I make a hard copy of the fuzz Tokyo page I would it would be great if I had a list of what each place oh so I we've got an idea I think we'll make some sort of a map I mean we'll put it in our help center but then we can also send it out to you guys as a resource but some sort of a map with everything labeled and a short description would just be a really good thing to have since it is new for a lot of teachers yeah all right feedback in the Marigny yeah so we've gone through teacher demo mode the next part of the webinar that I'm gonna walk through is how you can use your teacher or to manage your classes we've got a lot of really great questions thank you to those of you who RSVP'd and wrote in questions about managing classes and I'm gonna try to address them all now and then we'll cover what we don't address in the Q&A so when you get into your teacher dashboard you'll always select the class that you're looking to teach for that day if you can remember back at the beginning I created my webinar class so that's what I'm going to click on to use as I walk through these features at the top of your dashboard these ones at the top here where I'm driving my mouse these are linked to your specific class that you just chose so I am on webinar class and the first thing I'm going to talk about is assignments so assignments is basically the way that we describe how which levels of the game your students are able to plan you will see that if you selected k5 as your grade then everyone whether or not you selected k5 or not potable automatically assigns levels if you don't want your students to be able to play a specific level all you need to do is click on assign that means that when your students log in to the game they will not be able to play the level that you have unassigned if all levels are assigned you give them the class code and they log in they will be able to move through the levels at their own pace without ever being stopped at any point so I point out the assignments tab has a really useful way for teachers to control how quickly their students are moving through the game and kind of use that as a tool to shape your lesson plans so if you are interested in just having students do one set of levels a day because you are also teaching other content in your class you can unassign the other levels students will only be able to play the ones that are lit up in green and then the next day you can assign the next level I do actually if you can you just show that you'll need to click but over here on this side tab you actually have like a global assignments page that you can use if you want to assign things to multiple classes you don't have to go to each class page you can actually just go to this assignments page and assign to all classes or to just like say you want to have all your third grade classes on the same pacing you can just assign it to all your third grade classes that's a great place to go to do that so there's there's two different ways that you can do this awesome Elmo so this is the assignments tab like I said I'm going to move forward into the lessons tab again these are lessons that codable recommends based on the grades that you selected when you created your class so when I set up my webinar class I selected k5 as my grade band quotable is then going to recommend curriculum recommend lessons that are appropriate for that grade level so if I have selected only kindergarten classes these lessons would look different there would be fewer lessons in some of these trickier units as you get into a some more advanced content it would it paces it for you but you can always edit the grade levels that you've selected and then that will impact the pacing that codable recommends you show them that oh yeah absolutely so right now I'm k5 I'm just going to edit my class setting which is over here I'm going to select kindergarten just as an example going to save my changes and then when I head back to lessons you'll see that a lot of those units that were covering some more advanced content are gone so kindergarten has these units sequence and conditions with the accompanying lessons that are appropriate for kindergarten now if you notice that your kindergarteners are moving through these lessons and they're doing a really great job and they are capable of taking on some trickier content always remember that you can edit the grade in your class settings k5 will give you access to everything since it covers all the grades and that will open up the rest of the units and the lessons um so I'm just going to dive into an example lesson if you guys have any questions again please feel free to write them in after this we'll take a pause and to answer some questions about assignments and lessons so I'm going to start at unit 1 sequence and the first lesson is introduction there were some questions that were written in about the difference between what is accessible on a free teacher account and then what is accessible on a paid account sequence one introduction is a lesson that's available to everyone who's watching here so what this is definitely a great place to look to see if our lessons that we provide would work for you and your students I'm just gonna walk through what the lesson holds so each lesson starts with a short description of the lesson it covers the objectives so for this first lesson students are going to be able to move a robot which is actually another classmate or a teacher to move across a room to perform different actions like spinning and jumping I'm using programming like so it then covers vocabulary and all of our vocabulary has been updated this year so definitions are a bit simpler um easier for younger students to understand which is great each lesson then moves into direct instruction so kind of the philosophy of these lessons is a gradual release model so we want it's kind of like an I do we do you do format so the I do is when you as the teacher are introducing a new concept and this is maybe you're going over new vocabulary you're asking students but they already know about the content that you're covering so for example in this first lesson we're talking about what is something a programmer might make on what do programmers do what how do they use code so it's really discussion based I'm going over an introduction of the content for the day the second section of each lesson is the guided practice activity that is the we do and these are unplugged activities that you can do with your students where they are getting a really handson tangible experience with the coding concept that you're introducing that day so in this example students are acting as programmers and they're applying knowledge of programming language and sequence to command a robot and I'm you can't see if I'm saying that in quotes because it's a it's another person to move forward and jump so again this is unplugged and every single lesson that you'll see on our teacher dashboard that we've created are hung flowed Plaisance for students to really get that handson experience first so they're learning about it in an unplugged handson way on the final section is actually the independent practice that's the you do section of the lesson where students are logging into codable and we recommend certain less levels themed levels to go with each lesson so in this example students are going to be logging into Smee Borg and they'll be clicking on the first set of levels in sequence these are directly tied to the sequence concepts that we just went over in the direct instruction and the guided practice activity each lesson then wraps up with a check for understanding these are usually group discussions maybe they're a short reflection for the student to participate in where they kind of sum up what it was learned that day are there any questions before we move on about these lessons because I know I just went over a lot of information there um we are getting lots of love people are so excited like oh my gosh this is made for me um so thank you guys I'm so happy that you all like this I did want to address so Scott was asking he's a parent um and they are curious about whether or not to use the parent or school version I would say for the vast majority like 99.9% of parents the parent version is what you want unless you are a home schooler or you are in some sort of like a cottage school situation I definitely recommend the parent version using colorful at home because our like program and pricing and everything is set up for like school users on the school version and the parent version likewise I set up for home use for use by a parent we are actually working on a lot of materials for parents this school year we just added progress tracking and for parents teachers actually you can share with that that parent code they don't even need a parents account to arlenian account that they don't need to like upgrade to the paid version to view what their kids are doing at school but if you choose to get the parent version you're gonna have access to progress tracking for both school and home and then we're working on a lot of these same materials for parents but in a better context like for what you're actually doing at home so like a lot of this stuff is set up for a class situation with multiple students like lots and lots of students in other cases and so for parents it's just best to stick with the parent version but if you are interested like say you are on one schooler or you do have an interest in using our school product at home please feel free to email me at Gretchen at Kohler Bolcom or support code will calm and we can chat with you about getting something set up for you so definitely do that but again I just want to reiterate the parent version is probably what you want to go with this absolutely okay so again this was the lesson and we'll go over what lesson library is in just a little bit and we're going to move on to student creations and actually Gretchen is going to talk about how you kind of just touched on it but if you want to say it again what we're doing to share student creations that students are creating in class with families yeah I'm gonna go put it and show you guys what you can see so when your students go we don't have any creation here we have a class that does yeah totally class of what I'm chick cave the k5 so when your students are unlocking those areas infos topia like a buzz builder and the maze maker and all these other sections of culpable they're gonna start creating their own closets and they're so cute I just love all the things that students make we actually do a feed of them like on the back side and go to and it's just adorable but um you can actually view them all from here and you can view the code that they wrote and then you can send this it prints a little PDF that you can send home to parents and actually if they go ahead and set up a global account at home they can view all of their child's creations from their parent dashboard and they can log in using the class code at home and play with their fusses or if they decide to get a parent account they and actually play with those buzzes at home as well so it's just really neat to be able to share everything that they're learning with their family the other thing that they can see are their mazes so in codable there's a way for students 1/3 yeah um so we actually have the option for kids to wonder when they're learning new concepts like saying they've they've gotten to conditions and they've sort of mastered conditions maze maker will unlock and they'll have the option to start making their own levels using conditions and then as they unlock loops they'll have the option to add a maze and create a maze that uses loops and it's really just so incredible through the things that kids come up with I used to make all of the levels I still make all of the levels in codable and I was like I know basically every like way that you can make a level uncodable so we did a maze native competition I guess like a year ago and I was blown away there were so many creative and just inspiring pieces that kids came up with so it's a great way to like assess how well they're understanding the concept but also just to get them thinking creatively using the design thinking process and learning about you know basically working backwards through a problem yeah absolutely so like Gretchen said these the creative applications can be used kind of as an informal assessment and when you're teaching to see how students are asking the concepts and actually applying them in a creative way um another tool that we have here for tracking student progress is the progress tab so we did get a couple questions written in on the RSVP that was asking about grades does codable give grades how do i grade this work um so that's going to be really dependent on you as a teacher but besides the informal assessments with these student creations you can use this progress tab to see their level of progress how far they are moving through the game so which concepts they're covering it you can see Alex my student here has finished si Wynn's alice is just starting and my other students are further behind so that's just a way for you to gauge how students are moving through the levels and which which concepts are mastering you also have this option to click on view standards progress and this is going to show you which computer science standards for each unit so for sequence conditions etc your students have started are working on or have mastered and these computer science standards if you go to codable Java Khan / outcomes you'll see how we put these computer science standards together for sequence they cover State Standards and other other computer science standards that we've put together to cover everything that you might need to be tracking for your school so again this progress tab it's covering in progress as well as standards progress and you can kind of use that information how you need to in order to provide grades about something you're interested in doing but we just wanted to give you the information here in case you may need it so before we move on I'll just point out that there are also tabs at the top here for students and for class settings both of these are useful for managing your class students you'll be able to see your class roster print their login instructions again and add students to your class and then class settings like I showed before is a good way to edit what grade your class is maybe you want to change the class code or assign the class to another teacher so that they can have the information for your class this is the place to do it there's also you can see this danger zone there are some things over here that you might need for resetting all student progress and other things like that if you have questions about this please let us know some of the stuff that I saw in the RSVP questions about transferring students we're going to go over when we talk about these tabs here on the left but we just went over all of the different features that codable teacher word offers for managing a specific class are there any questions Richard that are that have been written in about the times that we covered so far really only just one question about what grades clinical is appropriate for so cloacal is focused on groups k25 we do have people who use it with younger students may be like prek or teaching students we also have people that use it in middle school it's their just introduced including to their kids for the first time obviously if you're using it with older students or younger students they're going to move at a different pace then what codable might like assume so if they're younger they may move a little bit slower or if they're older than even move a little bit faster and you can adjust everything from your assignments page based on what you see happening in your classroom so like I said you can totally manage using it with kids outside of those age ranges if you want to but yes it is primarily focused on K through 5 totally great so as we move on I'll direct your attention to this left menu on the side of your dashboard if you remember this is where we found teacher demo mode before the resources here on the left side of your dashboard are not linked to one specific class so this is where you want to go like arch and said if you're assigning to multiple classes at one time or you want to manage student transferring across multiple classes you'll go to this left side menu so I'm going to start with the lesson library we take in one quick question oh yeah so it knows asking if we have the option to add multiple like share a class by the teacher say you have a co teacher or something right now there's only one teacher per class but you can say you're on the codable school plan and you're an admin or like say you're the tech teacher for at school and there's a firstgrade teacher who wants to add their class you can add teachers and assign them to a specific class if you are on a quotable school plan but for the basic free version there is no way to have multiple teachers and there's no way to have multiple teachers on a class in the school version either you would just view it as an admin and you would see all the classes and then that teacher would be assigned to it if you have questions about our admin tools please feel free to email me Gretchen at koat.com or Bree at coldwell comm we're happy to go over that with you children great so like I said we're moving into the lesson library the lesson library is the place where you can find lessons that are not linked to are not well they're not all linked to our core content there are a lot of them are supplementary that you can use to cover different content besides just the coding concepts that are covered in our core curriculum so for exists ill Terr feature on the left side it's kind of like what you would use if you were shopping where you know you're looking for and you can filter based on what you're looking for specifically so if I am interested in finding kindergarten lessons and let's say I want to cover the coding concept of sequence and then I can choose a content area let's say I really want to do an introduction to robotics unit the lesson library filters and offers you lessons that are directly linked to those features that you just filtered for um so this does bring up our robotics unit where we've partnered with Wonder workshop and the and dot robots and you can click on these lessons again they're structured the same way that the lessons were when we went over them in the lessons tab where there are scripted and they cover everything you'll need to use to run the lesson if you find something in the lesson library that you want to teach you can click Save the lesson you'll choose the class that you want to save it for I'm and that will save right to your says dashboard so you won't need to go back into the Lawson library to find it again it'll be saved which is really nice so again visit these are a lot of these are supplementary lessons that you might want to use in other content areas not just coding but it shows you how coding concepts can be linked to all of these other content areas so for example if I'm interested in integrating a coding lesson into en la I can click English language arts the tab over here I'm and it'll filter into these lessons that I can click on to teach different things so definitely I recommend exploring this lesson library to see what is available to you you'll notice that there's a little quotable school icon on some of these that means that those lessons are just accessible to schools with the quotable school account but if it doesn't have the icon then it's open for you to click on and you can go through these lessons to see if it's something you'd want to integrate in your class and if it is a paid lesson you can actually view a preview FL so for those of you who are considering incredible school for your for your students you can get a view of what our paid lessons look like cool so the next look we kind of touched on assignments already so I'm not going to click on it but that's where you would want to go if you were assigning levels to multiple classes at once the students tab is what I want to go to now because we did get a lot of questions since there's a lot of teachers who are starting their school year and want to transfer students from one class to another maybe classes are moving up a grade and you want to transfer some students from the kindergarten class to the first grade class this is where you can do all of that really easily and transfer in bulk so I'll show you quickly if I wanted to transfer let's say I have some students in my first grade class who I want to transfer into my second grade class I would click on the students tab I would select the students that are in my firstgrade class that I want to transfer you can select as many as you need and then there's this purple transfer selected students button I click on that there's a dropdown menu it's going to ask me which class I want to put them in so I want to transfer them to second grade I'm going to click on the second class and transfer students so it's that easy now you'll see that my two students here that were originally in first grade I've now transferred into second grade so this is the place you can go to do all of that transferring from one class to another which I know a lot of people were interested in so if there are any questions about transferring students in bulk let us know I'll pause right now to see if there's anything that we need I'm just like reading through the chat there's a lot of discussion and on the lesson library holiday it looks like we've answered all the questions people were asking like if they're on the game access plan of codable school would they have access to these lessons no you do not have access to all of the lessons in the lesson library if you're on the game access plan but you will have access to the free one so if if you're on if you have purchased the curriculum addon and don't have access to these but if you don't then you'll just look at the quotable school icon but you'd have the ones that don't have that on it and then we have let's see oh people are asking if there will be a recorded version of the webinar and oh yes yeah definitely so if this is being recorded right now we'll be sure to have the final version posted after we're done so you can head on back to review anything we've talked about also I'm offering trainings for teachers during the start of this school year so if you want to walk through the dashboard again oneonone and kind of go over just what you're interested or what you need more clarification on please reach out to me my email is Hana at potable comm and I'm happy to help you walk through that so someone was asking if there was an easy way to move students from first grade to second grade classes instead of putting all the names in again and I know you just went over that so I hope that that answered their question but I did want to be sure to address for people who are using either Google classroom or clever and soon class link actually really excited about um theirs so if you're using clever or class link I would assume I'm not as familiar with classic yet but codable will automatically update based on what you put into Kluber um if you are using if you're using Google classroom you will need to import your students again so you'd wipe out what you have is is seeing includable and then import them again it is not a twoway integration so it's not going to update live and if you aren't using either of those options then yes the class transfer the transfer selected students option that Hannah just showed you would be the way to go we do have bulk import built into the global dashboard when you're creating a class if you decide you wanted to start fresh and add all your students at once and say you have like 25 classes like so many of you do we have a bulk import option where you can just copy/paste your rosters from a spreadsheet and then I can eat the classes and stuff so that's really quick and easy to do if you don't have clever or some of the other options available to you so I am going to jump in a lot of you wrote in asking what is new what is new so I am going to show you what is new for teachers and Gretchen's gonna go over share to touch on a bunch of them but what is new for students so a big thing that is new that you guys I hope will love is the resource center it's at the top of this left menu and when you click on it this is where we are going to put all of our public resources everything you might need to teach with Co to show potable to your students to get started again so I'll just kind of walk through what is in the Resource Center there's the getting started kit that we had that was on the homepage when we logged in this getting started kit is going to be really helpful for those of you that want to know what codable is about what students are going to learn what content is going to be covered before actually using it with your students so there's three parts to the getting started kit there's a guy that is going to help you get set up with devices which we talked about with the code cards and then there's also an updated potable field guide and our updated scope and sequence so the codable field guide I think I actually have it up here this is a brand new guide that we've created that covers everything in codable that you might need to teach with it so it walks you through each of the three worlds what students are learning and what it will actually look like for them in the game it talks about our creative applications like we mentioned with building fuzzies and making mazes and then gives you a breakdown of our curriculum if that's something you're interested in using and some tips and tricks for how to implement the lessons so again if you're interested in learning more about codable what it's all about definitely check out this getting started kit it's in the resource center of your teacher dashboard and that includes our scope and sequence gesso so a lot of you have asked for scope and sequence over the years and we had one we didn't have a place to put it so I'm so happy we have this resource center because now all of those things that we've been creating over the years I'm just like sending the people over the automail are available here we're going to be adding a ton to this page over the next couple of months but yeah if you're looking for a scope and sequence check out the getting started kit it is in there so yeah yeah the other big thing that you probably see and are super excited about is we are starting to be staying answer keys so as a teacher we know that you know working through problems with your students is really important but sometimes you just get stuff and you need you feel like you need to know the answer to help this is the place to go so these are all the solutions for the smiie board lessons and we're working on asteroid iya and bug world as well and one think those are done they'll show up here in the answer keys of the Resource Center so these are all of this meatboy answer keys again right here Resource Center next to the getting started kit you can view the solutions there the other resources that are available in the Resource Center are the teacher guides teacher guides will walk you through all of this all of the content again that you are there students are learning in codable there are videos that are meant for you where you can watch them and learn more about the coding content if you are confused about any of the conditions or loops or any of the content that we're covering this is a place great place to go for you and then there are also classroom materials resources for your classroom posters you can pull it up and we're going to be adding to these all of the time so that is a quick overview of the Resource Center definitely poke around it's a great place well like Gretchen said we'll add to it a bunch can you show them one of the oh yeah so the end is actually working on updating all these but I do want to go ahead and show you so many people don't know that this exists and so I wanted to be sure to show everyone this is where you can go to learn about a concept before you teach it it sort of like codable for teachers so we talked about what see in this example this is our sequence guide what sequence is how it's used in programming some of the core like vocabulary vocabulary that you want to cover just explaining it to you in simple terms because I know so many of you don't have a background in computer science like oh these concepts are so new to me so we just wrote everything down in an easytounderstand way so that you can speak with a little bit more confidence when you're talking to your students and answering their questions and then we'll address what codable is teaching onscreen and how it works and how it relates to what this concept actually is in programming okay it's not everything really wanting to hello I think I think that is everything that was a lot so if you guys have questions please ask them reach out to us this video again will be recorded so no need to memorize it all right now um so I'm gonna give a couple minutes for people to ask questions if they have them you can go over our Q&A document but yeah so but I did want to be sure to let you guys know we are going to be adding a lot less spoiler so if you have questions you can always reach out to us at support at codable comm we also are doing a lot of work on our YouTube channel looking to add a lot more content there for you and for students and for parents so if you want to subscribe to our youtube channel just click the subscribe button somewhere on the screen up right below and you'll get updates about men we post new content we're also going to be doing a lot for parents this year so if you want to share that code card or any of your students creations with them that way you can be sure that they're staying updated on what's happening in your classroom and they're gonna be getting a lot of really cool new features this year as well um so let me see if we have any question great okay so they all had a question about Australia and connecting the concept of strings and colored a color glass sure as you shoot at this level seems hard put together can you explain a little bit of like what the connection is or do you want me to about what's happening on screen and then also where you can find more materials on like what's actually going on on screen yeah well so to find materials that will be in the resource center and that we were just on and if you go to those teacher guides there is a teacher guide for string variables array and Ruby variables and what am I forgetting strings arrays integers integers so there's guys for all of those and epidemic it shows you the screen captures of the actual game and talks through those how those concepts are being applied do you want to give a little bit of background about it um I'm sorry I was reading I'm like how how the how the link between the game and the variables oh yeah yeah so basically what's happening when you are assigning a variable of property or sorry assigning a variable of value in programming you need to use you need to make sure that there that you're either using a string which is a string of characters so we use colors represent that so it appears on the screen as purple written out so kids are learning like what the value types are in in coding when you're using variables there's those three different types there's also integers which is just a number and then there's arrays which can be a list of items it can be either a string or an integer and so for our idea we're really just trying to get them familiar with variable types and also like assigning value to things and then the game is the great way to hook them a awesome way to make sure that those concepts are hitting home and if students are really grasping like what a variable is is to progress them into the game designer as they're moving through our idea they're going to unlock properties which are just another name for variables within the game designer and they can actually start creating and designing their filling game and modifying properties within the code to make adjustments either to make it easier or harder or like a different flair to it so we have a really cool project where you can team students up to talk about like what kind of game they want and can make a game suitable for their partner and then they get feedback and to iterate on their design so there's a lot of stuff happening with variables within asteroid yeah but I would definitely be sure to check out the resources that cover all of that so that you can um talk about it with your students yeah and you can also reach out to us anytime you have questions always yes so they will practice they'll ask people if they practice these concepts when they build yes okay I don't see any other questions coming in so yeah if you guys need anything or we're going to share actually last thing on my cover we're gonna share all the resources of resources that we talked about in the description below this video after the fact I'm going to add a timestamp to some of the sections that we covered so that we can be sure to make this useful for people after the fact so you want to come back and you're like what was that thing they said you can come back and look through and see the resources and jump to a section of the video so thank you all so much I wanna you we're so psyched for this school year we have big plans and we love hearing all of your feedback so please please please keep us updated on that yeah and we love seeing all of your happy smiling faces and your students faces um this school year it's one of the things that keeps us motivated so we actually have a channel like in our team slack where we can see like what's happening on Twitter and who knows so if you want to share with us what's going on in your classroom if you have permission to do that please do that we love love love seeing what's going on so um thank you all so much for watching thank say Hanna but you know someone I come yeah thank you to those of you that have been commenting and giving tips and tricks tricks to other teachers that's so great and really brings together equitable community so thank you that you guys's we'll talk to you soon yep please reach out to us we're happy to talk alright everybody thanks again talk to you soon have a good thank you bye
