With timestamps:

00:00 - all right here we are um hi everybody my
00:05 - name is Gretchen humor and I am with the
00:07 - founders of Kota bowl I am so excited to
00:11 - talk with Iowa educators today about the
00:14 - hour of code why it's important how you
00:17 - can get started I just all of the great
00:19 - things that that entails um I've got
00:22 - with me here angel mendez she is from
00:26 - the governor's office she works in the
00:29 - organization called Iowa stem and she's
00:32 - in charge of all the communications and
00:34 - marketing for them and making sure that
00:36 - you guys know about all the wonderful
00:37 - things that they're doing we've been
00:39 - working together for a little while um
00:41 - you know kind of figuring out how to
00:44 - improve um you know the things that are
00:48 - offered to Iowa educators for computer
00:51 - science we've been learning a lot about
00:53 - all the great things that they've been
00:54 - doing and how we can help um and so I'm
00:57 - really excited to have her speak with
00:59 - you guys but first I want to and just
01:01 - quickly go over some of the things we're
01:03 - going to be talking about we're going to
01:05 - go over now the hour of code what it is
01:07 - why it's relevant I think that if you're
01:09 - here you probably already know all that
01:11 - so we'll go over it quickly um and then
01:13 - we'll talk a little bit about what to
01:15 - expect and how you can prepare and then
01:17 - what I'm really excited about is how to
01:19 - prepare so that you can go beyond an
01:22 - hour of code that's a big thing that
01:25 - we've been hearing a lot about from
01:26 - people this year is you know I this is a
01:28 - kickoff for me for the rest of my school
01:30 - year um and some people they've done it
01:32 - before other people this is their first
01:34 - attempt at doing the hour of code and so
01:36 - there you know look excited but a little
01:38 - bit apprehensive about what to expect
01:40 - and so we're just going to go through
01:41 - some of the things you can do to prepare
01:43 - so that you're off and rolling um
01:45 - successfully for the rest of the school
01:47 - year and so without further ado I would
01:50 - like to present angel mendez she's gonna
01:52 - tell you guys what all resources are
01:56 - available specifically for Iowa
01:58 - educators and then we'll get into the
02:00 - details of what to expect right Thank
02:04 - You breslin hi everybody this is angel
02:06 - mendez and the communications manager
02:08 - for the iphone the stem advisors if
02:11 - you've you never the organization before
02:13 - will let me tell you knew Geist it is a
02:15 - resource for STEM education for Iowa
02:18 - educators both in school and out of
02:21 - school there are myriad of things I
02:23 - could tell you about but just know if
02:25 - you go to Iowa stem gov there are a list
02:28 - of everything you can do to get involved
02:30 - with them there's a regional stem
02:32 - manager who is charged with making sure
02:34 - that you're aware of those opportunities
02:36 - and linking you up with those that are
02:39 - most appropriate to you one of those is
02:41 - why we're here today called code Iowa
02:43 - and that's our attempt to localize the
02:47 - hour of code to Iowa and getting more
02:49 - Iowans whether it's parents grandparents
02:52 - kids
02:53 - educators businesspeople lawmakers you
02:57 - name it everyone across Iowa to try one
03:00 - hour of computer coding during computer
03:02 - science education week which is December
03:04 - sent through the 11th I believe just two
03:08 - weeks away and so with code Iowa what we
03:11 - do it's a really a two-part thing the
03:13 - first part is we give away what we call
03:16 - code Iowa technology awards we're giving
03:19 - away six this year however that
03:21 - application closed just last Friday so
03:25 - that opportunity has since closed but
03:27 - it's an annual thing under thirty five
03:29 - hundred dollars to buy instructional
03:31 - technology for your classroom both are
03:33 - sponsored by google and verizon they've
03:37 - been gracious partners in that capacity
03:39 - and
03:42 - so we'll be announcing who those
03:44 - awardees are during computer science
03:46 - education week however there's still a
03:48 - thing for you to get involved in and
03:49 - that is you need to register your event
03:52 - on the hour of code website if you go to
03:55 - our code calm and just scroll towards
03:57 - the bottom of the page there's a join us
04:00 - um place where you put you know what
04:03 - your organization is what your first and
04:05 - last name is I think an email very
04:07 - simple just to say that yes I'm hosting
04:09 - an event in Iowa and this is what it's
04:11 - going to look like and your name will be
04:13 - put on a list on the arm code website
04:15 - where we'll pull from and say these are
04:17 - all of the all of the organizations in
04:20 - Iowa that participate in the hour of
04:22 - code they are now being certified code
04:25 - iowa partners is what we call them and
04:28 - every one of those people on that list
04:29 - will be eligible for computer science
04:32 - trainings that we are planning some in
04:35 - partnership with kota bowl some with
04:37 - oracle academy and some with code org as
04:41 - well coming in the spring and summer of
04:43 - 2017 so if you haven't already
04:46 - registered your event on that website
04:48 - and we'll make sure you get added to
04:50 - that list otherwise I guess I think
04:53 - Gretchen said we wanted to open it for a
04:55 - couple of questions Gretchen I'm seeing
04:57 - any yet that that we can address and
05:00 - regards this the stem Council and what
05:02 - we do I'm not seeing any yet I can we
05:08 - can wait a couple seconds and see if we
05:09 - have any group any role in um I should
05:11 - have said ahead of time you guys can
05:13 - send us questions through Twitter at
05:17 - Kota bowl if you're following a new one
05:20 - use social media if you want to use the
05:23 - chat we've got to check out up here on
05:25 - the left hand side if you're in google
05:27 - hangouts um otherwise if you want to
05:29 - post to the YouTube page where you're
05:31 - watching live you can also do that um so
05:34 - I've got all of those things up if you
05:36 - want to post your question we'll wait a
05:37 - couple minutes our minute or so and see
05:40 - if we have anything roll in um I have a
05:44 - couple of questions for you angel um
05:46 - just while we're waiting uh so what do
05:50 - you think uh you know is one of the
05:53 - challenges that Iowa educators are
05:55 - facing you know getting started with an
05:58 - hour of code is there anything that you
06:00 - guys do to kind of help them overcome
06:01 - that
06:02 - well I think the biggest thing is it's
06:05 - um it's not a new topic at all computer
06:08 - science has been around for a while but
06:10 - it's another hour ago
06:12 - there's not a lot of people who are
06:15 - actually doing it in the schools and
06:17 - that's because right now Iowa doesn't
06:19 - really have a system of getting more
06:21 - computer science into the schools in all
06:23 - of the schools as well you know you
06:24 - think of libraries museums Girl Scouts
06:27 - Boy Scouts there's all sorts of organic
06:30 - organizations taking this on to and I
06:33 - think co.org is a really great job of
06:35 - getting those people who are first
06:37 - hearing about computer science and
06:39 - connecting so how to get that going so
06:42 - instead of us trying to create that what
06:44 - we've done is really latching on to the
06:46 - latching onto code.org and really
06:49 - promoting that as strongly as we can
06:52 - across the state as a means to get that
06:56 - going and from there they can take it
06:57 - and run with it and make it what what
06:59 - they want because I can set at this
07:01 - point there's not really a system in
07:03 - place that says kind of what that's
07:05 - going to look like there is however why
07:09 - sure there was some state legislation
07:11 - that was turned down Oliver I believe
07:14 - there is more calm than pipe we could
07:17 - say that is focused on computer science
07:21 - that we can hope to see past this year's
07:24 - well I don't know too many details on
07:26 - that but I think in the coming month I
07:27 - might have more information so apparent
07:30 - just say that all i'm following that you
07:31 - can always reach out to me as well and i
07:34 - can share it with
07:35 - ok and then um it's good to hear what
07:39 - you guys are doing you know at a state
07:40 - level but what are some of the things
07:41 - that people can find locally if they you
07:44 - know are reaching out to try and find
07:46 - some support within their town or city
07:49 - you know where they can look to that i
07:51 - would say i would point you to we have
07:54 - six regional send managers across the
07:56 - state and those you know we broke iowa
07:58 - up into six pieces of the pie and in
08:02 - each of those regions there's what we
08:03 - call regional sim manager that's house
08:05 - that either one of the regent
08:07 - universities or at a community college
08:09 - and that person is the one that's really
08:12 - charged with making sure that that
08:15 - educator whether they're in for out of
08:18 - school is connected with you know those
08:20 - those opportunities that they're
08:21 - interested in so at the state level me
08:23 - being just the voice of stem and i can
08:27 - tell you off the top of my head you know
08:28 - oh there is you know this organization
08:31 - and mists you know southern part of iowa
08:33 - that's really good that would be
08:35 - something that our managers would know
08:36 - and they're really good about connecting
08:38 - those pieces for us so if you have an
08:42 - interest in learning more about who your
08:44 - regional manager is you go to iowa stem
08:47 - gov / regions i'll put this in the
08:49 - now perfect and they can find their
08:52 - regional manager based on what city they
08:55 - are located in awesome okay great and
08:58 - then my last question I'm not seeing
09:01 - anything coming in let me check Twitter
09:03 - one more time but um
09:05 - do you
09:07 - know I know that a big concern for a lot
09:10 - of people when they're talking about
09:11 - getting started with coding and
09:12 - especially dating it beyond you know the
09:15 - hour of code is cost and there's a lot
09:18 - of free things that are available but
09:19 - you know for people who know they want
09:23 - to do a full k25 roll out or that you
09:26 - know k to 12 even and cost can be a
09:29 - major concern for them what are some
09:31 - ways that they can go about finding
09:33 - financial resources and what are some
09:36 - that exists just to give people an idea
09:38 - of what's available for them well I can
09:41 - think of two things off the top of my
09:42 - head the first one up is pretty easy and
09:45 - that's better what I mentioned earlier
09:47 - if you're wanting to continue pursuing
09:50 - computer science down the road beyond
09:52 - you know just the neck in the next two
09:55 - weeks we have those computer science
09:57 - training so again you want to make sure
09:59 - you get your a bit register and what
10:01 - happens is we put you on a list will
10:03 - send you information about all these
10:04 - trainings that were planning on having
10:06 - in the spring and summer and those
10:08 - trainings are naturally pretty already
10:10 - which is great however you know to get
10:13 - out of the classroom is actually go to
10:15 - these trainings there's travel that you
10:18 - have to live take on and there's also
10:20 - the faculty of the paper substitute
10:22 - teacher to take over the classroom while
10:24 - you're gone and what's nice to us again
10:25 - through google and verizon were able to
10:27 - help supplement those additional costs
10:30 - beyond the actual training to actually
10:32 - get you there on to participate the
10:35 - second thing too is what what the same
10:38 - counsel really wants to do is help bring
10:41 - communities together we want businesses
10:44 - and educators to connect because that's
10:46 - what's ultimately going to help
10:49 - feed the future pipeline talent pipeline
10:51 - of iowa and that community is going to
10:55 - look different across the state there
10:57 - are different sort of industries in each
10:59 - of these little communities so maybe you
11:01 - have a business in your city that is
11:05 - really reliant on technology or really
11:07 - reliant on computer science take this
11:10 - idea to them say we want to get you know
11:12 - co double in our classroom where we want
11:14 - to get um
11:15 - you know some other known a computer
11:19 - science software to teach our students
11:21 - these ins and outs of it um you know
11:24 - reach out to them bring them the cost
11:26 - pitch it to them there's businesses are
11:29 - more eager to get involved with the
11:31 - schools and I think most of us really
11:33 - imagine and that's one of the things
11:34 - that we've seen through the stem council
11:36 - because we are so involved not only with
11:39 - education but also with economic
11:40 - development I think if you just reach
11:42 - out to the local
11:44 - community aspect and tap into that
11:47 - you're really going to see some things
11:48 - at them awesome okay well thank you so
11:52 - much for joining us um I I'm not saying
11:54 - anything but I can I share people with
11:58 - people who have questions I maybe at the
12:00 - end or throughout can I share your
12:02 - contact information with them oh yeah of
12:04 - course please go ahead perfect i will
12:06 - post that on the YouTube page and on the
12:10 - event page in facebook as well so that
12:12 - they have that
12:13 - all right thank you so much have a great
12:15 - evening and a happy thanksgiving for
12:17 - Prince Gretchen all right bye bye
12:21 - okay everybody um so that was angel and
12:25 - it sounds like um there's a lot of great
12:28 - things out there for everybody um you
12:32 - know who's interested in going beyond an
12:33 - hour of code but also getting started
12:34 - you know we've got a lot of really cool
12:36 - opportunities in Iowa and to be honest
12:39 - with you all that you know there's
12:40 - things that are offered in Iowa that I
12:44 - haven't seen in many other states and so
12:47 - you guys are very fortunate i'm really
12:48 - excited to be partnering with the
12:50 - governor's office and with iowa stem and
12:53 - with code iowa it's really exciting to
12:55 - see you know then making a change in
12:57 - their state so um that's really great
13:00 - we're going to go ahead and jump into
13:02 - what the hour of code is why it's
13:04 - important um and and go from there so
13:07 - the hour of code is an event that
13:11 - started about three years ago through a
13:14 - partnership between cobourg and
13:17 - computer science education week and
13:19 - these two groups got together they
13:21 - wanted to take an opportunity to provoke
13:23 - computer science to every person
13:27 - especially students so that they can see
13:31 - what it can do to just try one hour one
13:35 - hour of coding um and so that naturally
13:39 - with the name came about the hour of
13:41 - code um the week changes every year but
13:45 - it's usually the first week of December
13:47 - and that's computer science education
13:49 - week and so it's a really big movement
13:52 - to get kids just excited about computer
13:56 - science to get your communities excited
13:58 - about computer science to get your
14:00 - colleagues and your administrators
14:02 - excited about what can come of showing
14:05 - kids you know maybe not expecting every
14:07 - child to become a programmer but just
14:08 - showing them the opportunities that are
14:10 - available for learning how to code and
14:13 - what kind of things can open up to them
14:15 - if they do decide to pursue learning to
14:18 - code and so you know it's a really fun
14:20 - week it's my favorite week of the year
14:22 - it's the biggest holiday for me so um
14:24 - it's just very exciting there's such a
14:27 - great sense of community that comes out
14:29 - of it just everybody sharing about it
14:31 - and everyone's talking and there's a
14:33 - real buzz in the school that you don't
14:35 - wrote that you don't always feel you
14:37 - know it's easy to get caught up in the
14:39 - procedures and and the day-to-day grind
14:41 - but you know it's just a really fun way
14:44 - to learn new things learn problem
14:46 - solving in an interesting way that we
14:49 - don't do every year so every day um
14:52 - so that's that's a little bit about you
14:55 - know the hour of code and why it's
14:56 - important um you know obviously learning
15:01 - to code is a very important thing for
15:03 - our future information and for our kids
15:06 - there's going to be two hundred
15:09 - or there's going to be two million open
15:12 - computer science jobs in by 2020 and so
15:17 - having
15:19 - kids be prepared to you know go into the
15:22 - workforce with a little bit of an
15:23 - understanding of computer science if not
15:25 - you know fluent in a programming
15:27 - language gives them a huge opportunity
15:29 - when they give into a workforce and when
15:32 - they go and beyond and so doing
15:35 - everything that we can to prepare them
15:37 - for that is crucial so we'll go ahead
15:40 - and jump into what to expect with the
15:42 - hour of code and and how you can get
15:44 - started we're going to focus
15:47 - mostly on co double and how to get
15:49 - started with code but do cool shirt
15:51 - mention of it
15:54 - is just a phenomenal partner we've been
15:57 - partnering with them for three years
15:58 - along with a lot of other companies and
16:01 - they provide tons and tons of tutorials
16:03 - for free french caters to get started
16:07 - this year we have 19 that we have
16:11 - promoted through code org and I know
16:14 - that there's no
16:16 - hundreds of others that are available
16:18 - and so if you go to code org slash learn
16:21 - um you can find a lot of great resources
16:24 - available to our code website as well
16:27 - there's a lot of great stuff to view
16:29 - into you know sort of figure out what
16:31 - you think is best for your students and
16:33 - what you want to work on
16:35 - or take a look at what's available i may
16:38 - keep going um
16:40 - perspective but i know we do a lot of
16:42 - work we've been start we started know
16:45 - about in august getting our tutorials
16:48 - prepared so that it would be as easy as
16:49 - possible for people who just find us on
16:51 - you know that site and can it go through
16:53 - you know every step of the way we hold
16:56 - their hand and then make sure that
16:57 - they're ready for the big event during
17:00 - the hour of code and so you'll find that
17:02 - a lot of the tutorial partners are very
17:04 - eager to help very willing to it you
17:06 - know guide you if you do have questions
17:08 - but the tutorials are really helpful and
17:11 - knowing exactly what you can do with
17:13 - your students I know this year code.org
17:15 - is excited to be promoting more lesson
17:17 - plans we've provided lesson plans just
17:20 - about every year that we've participated
17:21 - but I know a lot of others are providing
17:24 - lesson plans as well um so let's go
17:27 - ahead and dive in and i'll be sure to
17:31 - you no answer any questions that come up
17:33 - so if you do have questions there's a
17:35 - chat window on the side of the
17:39 - the youtube chick page where this is
17:42 - streaming and
17:43 - you can also comment or you can tweet at
17:47 - me and again our twitter handle is at go
17:50 - to bowl
17:51 - and so you can always tweet at co dab'll
17:54 - and i'll be sure to answer your
17:56 - questions so if no one has questions
17:59 - right now then I'll keep going alright
18:02 - so um
18:06 - you can find all of the quotable hour of
18:10 - code
18:11 - resources at
18:13 - co double com / our dash of dash code
18:18 - and i'll go ahead and show you what
18:20 - we've got available there
18:21 - [Music]
18:24 - see here
18:26 - from working really hard at getting this
18:28 - up and ready for you guys so um
18:32 - excited for you to see it
18:40 - [Music]
18:51 - okay so you can see here um this is our
18:56 - hour of code site we've got a lot of
19:00 - great resources here if you want to go
19:03 - to our lesson plans we've got over 19
19:05 - lesson plans our curriculum director
19:08 - working tirelessly assembling all of
19:11 - these for you guys she was an elementary
19:13 - school teacher for many years and he's
19:17 - been working with us for the past year
19:19 - and just completely revamped our
19:21 - curriculum but if she's thrilled to be
19:23 - able to offer you guys some hour of code
19:26 - specific tutorials um so if you click on
19:29 - any of these you can see we've got four
19:30 - categories we've got beginner
19:32 - programming advanced programming
19:35 - robotics and then what I'm most excited
19:38 - about this year is ela and programming
19:40 - we know that you know for a big big
19:42 - challenge is finding time in the day for
19:44 - computer science and how can you fit it
19:47 - into your schedule and there's already
19:48 - so many things we need to teach how in
19:50 - the world am I going to teach something
19:51 - new um
19:53 - well the way to you know sort of fitted
19:57 - in is integrating it with what you're
19:59 - already teaching and so we put together
20:01 - an ela
20:03 - lesson plan and then you can see the
20:06 - standards that are taught with each of
20:08 - these lessons on you know on these icons
20:11 - a lesson plan that covers a standard for
20:15 - each grade level in writing and also
20:18 - helps teach some programming so let's go
20:20 - ahead and take a look at the
20:21 - kindergarten one
20:23 - the way that our lessons are structured
20:26 - is um it follows a typical lesson lesson
20:29 - structure or a lesson cycle we do a few
20:32 - minutes of direct instruction where we
20:33 - you know open up and talk start a
20:35 - discussion with students about what is
20:38 - computer science and why is this
20:39 - important and put it in terms that they
20:41 - can understand and relate it to their
20:43 - world and it's this is all completely
20:45 - scripted you can see here and then we
20:49 - introduce the new material we talk about
20:51 - you know what we're going to be doing
20:53 - here why why it's important and how we
20:56 - can work together
20:57 - and in this example they're going to be
20:59 - doing sentence puzzles so putting
21:02 - together a sentence and learning the
21:04 - structure of a sentence and how that
21:06 - relates to sequence which is an
21:08 - important concept in programming it's
21:11 - really the first and most fundamental
21:12 - concept that we teach to students
21:14 - especially for kindergarteners you know
21:16 - we start putting things in order a
21:18 - computer is a machine that reads things
21:21 - in a very specific order it will only
21:22 - read things in the order that we tell it
21:24 - to and so that is why putting things in
21:26 - the correct order is the most important
21:28 - thing to learn in the most foundational
21:30 - concepts for students or when we're
21:32 - getting started with computer science um
21:34 - and with programming and so that's what
21:37 - we go over in this lesson in obviously
21:39 - there's some clear tie into ela and so
21:43 - three or four kilo directors and a
21:45 - fantastic job in putting together these
21:48 - lesson plans so that you can do know
21:51 - some writing with your kids while you're
21:54 - doing some programming and then after
21:58 - doing the independent or the the direct
22:02 - instruction you can move into some
22:04 - guided practice where everybody works
22:05 - together
22:06 - so using a sentence puzzle follow their
22:10 - own graphic organizers and hens they'll
22:11 - be able to copy a sentence puzzle and
22:14 - fill it out and
22:16 - they do that together and then
22:18 - independent practice you can do a little
22:21 - bit of programming together um and so
22:23 - each lesson you know finishes with a
22:27 - closing exit ticket eh and everybody
22:29 - really understands you know what we
22:32 - learned here today what is sequence what
22:34 - are sentences and how are they
22:35 - structured and going on from there and
22:38 - each of these ela lesson plans is
22:40 - actually set up to be appropriate for
22:44 - I'm sorry to be appropriate for each
22:48 - grade level so in fifth grade you know
22:50 - rather than doing sentence puzzles um
22:52 - you know they're writing a short story
22:54 - doing a little bit of creative writing
22:56 - and
22:58 - working together on that so um and
23:01 - that's just our ela lesson plans we have
23:03 - robotics
23:05 - which features Dash and dot of wonder
23:08 - workshop um some advanced so you can
23:11 - start learning some JavaScript and
23:13 - object-oriented programming with your
23:15 - upper elementary students doing
23:17 - conditions and advanced sequencing with
23:20 - your kindergartners so these are some of
23:22 - our advanced lesson plans and they all
23:24 - follow that same structure of you know
23:26 - direct instruction independent practice
23:28 - and some direct instruction guided
23:31 - practice and an independent practice
23:33 - with the the final section of
23:35 - independent practice being done in Kota
23:38 - belong screen everything else has done
23:40 - off-screen together as a class so that
23:43 - really helps give kids a tangible
23:45 - example of what you're going to be
23:46 - learning why it's important and relating
23:49 - it to their real world into their
23:51 - day-to-day which is crucial when you're
23:54 - talking about such abstract technology
23:58 - technological concepts and so once you
24:02 - complete you know the first two sections
24:04 - of
24:05 - these lessons where you know you make
24:08 - sure you introduce it vocabulary to do
24:10 - the direct instruction you do a guided
24:12 - practice activity together I'm in this
24:14 - one you know it's a dance party where
24:16 - you put together a loop to music you
24:20 - know say the chicken dance you know
24:22 - you're in a repeat portions which would
24:23 - be programming concept called a loop and
24:26 - then you can um once you've done those
24:29 - four sections you can jump into
24:31 - independent practice oh you know for
24:33 - five to ten fifteen minutes where the
24:36 - kids are coding together or
24:38 - independently on their devices so it's
24:41 - really a holistic approach to teaching
24:43 - CS making sure that we're taking things
24:46 - you know slowly and off-screen in
24:48 - learning in in a lot of different ways
24:50 - for every type of learner and then
24:52 - coming together at the end and bringing
24:54 - out the technology and really putting
24:55 - our new concept into practice um so you
25:00 - can find all of these lesson plans
25:02 - like I said on our hour of code landing
25:08 - page
25:09 - down here at the bottom I'll go ahead
25:11 - and put the link in the chat window for
25:13 - you
25:19 - and that's where you can go to find all
25:21 - of those um
25:23 - does anybody have any questions on
25:26 - anything that I've covered so far
25:32 - [Music]
25:36 - just check
25:38 - my locations for questions doesn't look
25:41 - like yet um
25:46 - ok so let us go ahead and continue um
25:52 - so once you have your lesson plan and
25:54 - and you've decided what you want to do
25:57 - there's a couple of things you're going
25:59 - to need to set up for your kids to get
26:02 - started you know you do the lesson and
26:04 - then you want them to be able to you
26:05 - know as quickly as possible or as
26:07 - seamlessly as possible with a class full
26:10 - of you know 2011 tree school students to
26:13 - jump into other independent practice
26:15 - portion and so where you're going to
26:17 - have them go is this this section right
26:19 - here students get started play now
26:22 - that's going to take them to
26:25 - game notable calm / hour of code if you
26:30 - have a coda Bowl class setup and you
26:33 - want to use that you can click play with
26:36 - a class source student code if you don't
26:38 - have a code will account a quotable
26:39 - teacher account or class setup just
26:42 - click play without saving and that will
26:44 - let them create a session right here
26:46 - just for the hour of code without having
26:48 - to set it up ahead of time and then
26:50 - they're often running straight into
26:53 - horrible and they can get going and
26:56 - learning you know right just by hitting
26:59 - play I'll take them to the first lesson
27:01 - humble in size get to meet me so you can
27:05 - see it's really fresh
27:08 - once they've been taught about hospice
27:10 - concept of sequence which is boiler in
27:12 - here I can jump in and start doing some
27:15 - coding on their own and use my little
27:18 - mill around the room if your parent is
27:20 - they are in volunteering no that's
27:22 - always helpful to listen to start
27:24 - solving puzzles
27:26 - and there are some awesome sobbing and
27:28 - learning about sequence
27:31 - I'm dragging and dropping arrows and
27:33 - putting them into the correct sequence
27:35 - if you're going to be doing a word fast
27:37 - concept then you're probably an
27:40 - experienced co double user and so I
27:43 - would suggest
27:44 - signing in with your class code we I'll
27:47 - show you how to do that real quickly but
27:49 - first if you want them to be able to
27:51 - come back later just copy this student
27:54 - code and they can login with this
27:56 - another day
27:59 - if you want to use your class code do an
28:02 - advanced lesson do your class code
28:09 - [Music]
28:11 - came back co double common
28:14 - [Music]
28:15 - and play with class code
28:18 - i'm going to enter my class code
28:27 - then the students will be able to select
28:29 - their name from this list from the
28:32 - roster that i've imported ahead of time
28:35 - you choose my name and
28:40 - then depending on what lesson they're
28:42 - doing
28:43 - you will have them go to the to the
28:46 - corresponding levels incredible so let's
28:49 - say we wanted to do
28:58 - let's say we wanted to do
29:00 - [Music]
29:02 - conditions with our students which is
29:05 - the first grade advanced concept I would
29:08 - have them log in and go to
29:13 - the section on condition that
29:15 - corresponds with what's on the list
29:16 - early and you can see the corresponding
29:19 - levels
29:21 - you can see the corresponding levels
29:24 - here
29:26 - so we're going to do L loops sorry not
29:30 - conditions it's loops so you're going to
29:31 - do loopy lessons 3.12 3.5 and you'll be
29:35 - able to find that in the game
29:38 - and they'll be able to login I know so
29:42 - with your lessons there you go one
29:44 - through five that's the ones that
29:46 - they're going to be doing and this will
29:48 - take them between 10 to 15 minutes to do
29:51 - all of our lessons are about about 50
29:54 - minutes long which seems to be in a
29:56 - standard for what you know the time that
29:59 - most people have set aside for this
30:03 - so that's how to get started with
30:06 - countable and use co double for the hour
30:09 - of code um but I want to go ahead and
30:14 - jump into you know what to expect the
30:16 - day of um and
30:20 - and you know how you can kind of build
30:23 - excitement around around the hour of
30:26 - code
30:27 - stop
30:34 - so there's some things that you can do
30:36 - to really build excitement on the day of
30:39 - and to know what to expect if this is
30:41 - your first hour of code a lot of people
30:42 - you know have been doing it for a few
30:45 - years but if it's your first time um
30:47 - there's plenty of people around you
30:49 - whether it's on social media or you know
30:52 - angel or you know the local stem a
30:56 - representative who can help you I kind
30:59 - of get started there's a lot of people
31:00 - you can reach out to for advice but I'll
31:03 - just quickly run through some of the
31:04 - things that I see and you know talk
31:07 - about what to expect on the day of um
31:10 - so there's uh there's always the
31:15 - expectation that things need to go
31:17 - perfectly and as an elementary school
31:19 - teacher you know that that things are
31:21 - always going to come up with there's
31:22 - always going to be some transitions and
31:24 - some learning opportunities for every
31:27 - lesson and so the hour of code is no
31:29 - different just because it's different
31:31 - material doesn't mean that you know your
31:33 - lesson needs to be any different um so
31:36 - what you do what to expect is you know
31:40 - to just know that developers do their
31:42 - best to make their sites run effectively
31:45 - and efficiently
31:46 - but you know there's going to be times
31:49 - where it doesn't work or the servers are
31:52 - overloaded and just have a screen free
31:55 - option as a backup I know that that may
31:59 - seem counterintuitive to learning to
32:01 - cook but with elementary school kids
32:03 - it's actually the best way to get
32:04 - started and so that's why all of our
32:06 - lessons can be completed offline the
32:09 - group practice is a big part of learning
32:12 - and is all done offline and unplugged so
32:15 - using any of our lesson plans you'll
32:17 - have a screen free option available if
32:19 - for some reason um you know a sites not
32:21 - working um the other thing to expect is
32:24 - used lots of excitement and joy and
32:26 - learning we have a lot of great student
32:30 - resources um you know to show your kids
32:33 - some videos of
32:34 - other kids talking about why it's fun to
32:37 - learn to code and why it's important and
32:39 - what's some things that they've learned
32:40 - and I'll share that with you in the
32:42 - resources section at the end of the at
32:45 - the end of the webinar but there's also
32:46 - some great resources
32:49 - available through code org they've got
32:53 - some great videos so celebrities talking
32:55 - about why it's important to learn to
32:56 - code to kind of build back type before
32:59 - you get into the lesson and so um I
33:01 - would say to do some of that and then
33:04 - also expect a lot of interest from
33:05 - parents and other teachers don't be
33:07 - afraid to invite others to come into
33:09 - your classroom and just sit and watch
33:11 - inevitably they're going to jump in and
33:13 - they're going to want to be involved and
33:15 - you're going to get their hands dirty
33:16 - with you so you always have a network of
33:18 - people who fall back on if things aren't
33:20 - going exactly that you planned um and
33:23 - then the other thing is to expect to
33:25 - have a lot of questions from kids about
33:28 - things and you know don't use use your
33:31 - normal teaching
33:32 - strategies for answering those questions
33:34 - asked 3 than need you know ask your
33:37 - partner think pair share doing some
33:39 - things to help take the pressure off of
33:41 - you to have all of the answers and work
33:43 - together to problem-solve that's one of
33:44 - the beautiful things about learning to
33:46 - code is it's such a great way to reach
33:48 - out to others and use a community to
33:50 - learn things um and really foster that
33:53 - culture within your classroom so so
33:56 - those are some things to expect
33:59 - I'll go ahead and quickly walk you
34:00 - through how you can get started
34:04 - and get rolling for after the hour of
34:07 - code and the best way to do that is to
34:10 - create a quotable teacher account so
34:13 - that you can log in with a class code
34:15 - and you can have your students saving
34:16 - their progress easily and seamlessly and
34:18 - locking in but you know with the full
34:20 - roster ahead of time so we'll i'll
34:23 - quickly walk you through that and um
34:26 - yeah so but if anybody has any questions
34:29 - feel free to send them my way I'm
34:32 - listening
34:33 - okay so
34:39 - go ahead and share my screen
34:50 - okay now from the hour of code site
34:55 - for more hour of code page you can
35:00 - um get started
35:04 - select teacher
35:09 - you're going to put in your contact
35:11 - information
35:32 - I'm going to be a teaching
35:40 - and it's just going to walk you through
35:42 - you know what we were talking about
35:43 - about how our lessons are structured and
35:46 - you know how you can teach with koda
35:49 - bowl and how r curriculum is set up this
35:52 - is a quick you know tutorial about and
35:55 - direct instruction group practice
35:57 - independent practice walking you through
36:00 - using sequence as the example
36:02 - i'll go ahead and log into my account so
36:05 - you can see what it looks like once
36:07 - you're through all of this
36:36 - um so once you're in here you can see
36:40 - there's videos explaining each concept
36:44 - and then there's
36:46 - you've got a classes and students page
36:49 - and you can actually track your students
36:50 - progress
36:51 - so
36:54 - I'm going to go ahead and show you how
36:56 - to add a class um
36:58 - you just need to set up your class names
37:02 - i'm going to need my room
37:06 - 5g
37:07 - across code you can frisk me anything i
37:10 - suggest it being something that is
37:12 - easier for students to remember like
37:14 - your school mascot or your school street
37:16 - name or their classroom or your last
37:19 - name and something that they're going to
37:21 - be able to easily remember i'm going to
37:24 - just generate one you can also have two
37:25 - one generated for you you can change
37:27 - this at any time if you'd like for time
37:30 - i'm going to go ahead and generate it
37:31 - and
37:32 - then you just add your students so fat
37:47 - you can also copy and paste these up
37:49 - from a spreadsheet if he's like
38:02 - all right so it's already um I'm going
38:06 - to go to my class and I can see all my
38:08 - students um so that's how you go ahead
38:11 - and get your students imported but the
38:13 - real place to go is our courage one page
38:16 - and this is where you're going to find
38:17 - all the lesson plans for getting started
38:19 - with koda bowl
38:21 - and going beyond just the hour of code
38:23 - you know if you're just getting started
38:25 - teaching computer science the hour of
38:26 - code is a great way to do that and our
38:29 - lesson plans make it super simple to get
38:30 - started but I welcome you to explore
38:33 - this over the holiday break and kind of
38:36 - get a feel for some of the things that
38:37 - we offer to go beyond an hour of code we
38:40 - really really make it easy to offer a
38:42 - k25 scaffolded curriculum um to your
38:45 - students into your to your entire school
38:48 - if the hour of code is a success and if
38:51 - you really enjoy it and say how can I
38:53 - get more of this we offer a lot of these
38:56 - lesson plans for free you can try each
39:00 - and every one of our concepts with your
39:03 - students so you can see you know
39:05 - object-oriented programming with your
39:07 - upper elementary and you can get into
39:09 - some sequencing and conditions with your
39:12 - kindergarteners and first graders I'll
39:15 - show you one of those just say in an
39:17 - idea of what it looks like you can see
39:18 - it looks really similar to our hour of
39:20 - code lesson plans completely scripted
39:22 - guided practice independent practice um
39:25 - you know really getting the kids
39:27 - thinking offline and online and then
39:31 - each of these units offers an overview
39:34 - and explanation of the concepts so if
39:36 - you're thinking how am I going to teach
39:37 - about computer science if I don't know
39:38 - what it is um three has done a fantastic
39:41 - job of breaking it down each concept so
39:45 - that you can jump in feeling prepared
39:47 - I'm explaining what this concept is how
39:50 - it relates programming in a short quick
39:51 - video and then also with examples down
39:54 - below
39:56 - them so you can never you know you never
39:58 - have to feel like you don't know what
40:00 - you're teaching each each of these is is
40:03 - really easy to get through and so that
40:07 - is what I would suggest doing if you
40:09 - decide you want to go beyond an hour of
40:11 - code go ahead and get started set up
40:13 - your class you don't have to use it for
40:15 - the hour of code but you know it will be
40:17 - helpful for getting students signed in
40:19 - if you decide to UM
40:21 - and let me just check and see if we've
40:24 - got any questions
40:30 - let's see here
40:40 - doesn't
40:42 - look like we've got any questions
40:45 - so that is
40:48 - it um if anybody has any questions you
40:52 - can always reach out to me Gretchen at
40:56 - quotable com write my name and chat
41:02 - where you can reach out to Angel she's
41:04 - super helpful she's you know a great
41:08 - resource and she'll be able to point you
41:10 - in the right direction for how to get
41:12 - help locally in Iowa and I really am
41:16 - excited for you guys to get started with
41:17 - the our code if you have you know um
41:20 - some exciting stories during that week
41:23 - feel free to tweet them at us or share
41:25 - them with us we love hearing from
41:27 - teachers especially that week um so yeah
41:30 - alright everybody thank you so much and
41:33 - have a happy Thanksgiving

Cleaned transcript:

all right here we are um hi everybody my name is Gretchen humor and I am with the founders of Kota bowl I am so excited to talk with Iowa educators today about the hour of code why it's important how you can get started I just all of the great things that that entails um I've got with me here angel mendez she is from the governor's office she works in the organization called Iowa stem and she's in charge of all the communications and marketing for them and making sure that you guys know about all the wonderful things that they're doing we've been working together for a little while um you know kind of figuring out how to improve um you know the things that are offered to Iowa educators for computer science we've been learning a lot about all the great things that they've been doing and how we can help um and so I'm really excited to have her speak with you guys but first I want to and just quickly go over some of the things we're going to be talking about we're going to go over now the hour of code what it is why it's relevant I think that if you're here you probably already know all that so we'll go over it quickly um and then we'll talk a little bit about what to expect and how you can prepare and then what I'm really excited about is how to prepare so that you can go beyond an hour of code that's a big thing that we've been hearing a lot about from people this year is you know I this is a kickoff for me for the rest of my school year um and some people they've done it before other people this is their first attempt at doing the hour of code and so there you know look excited but a little bit apprehensive about what to expect and so we're just going to go through some of the things you can do to prepare so that you're off and rolling um successfully for the rest of the school year and so without further ado I would like to present angel mendez she's gonna tell you guys what all resources are available specifically for Iowa educators and then we'll get into the details of what to expect right Thank You breslin hi everybody this is angel mendez and the communications manager for the iphone the stem advisors if you've you never the organization before will let me tell you knew Geist it is a resource for STEM education for Iowa educators both in school and out of school there are myriad of things I could tell you about but just know if you go to Iowa stem gov there are a list of everything you can do to get involved with them there's a regional stem manager who is charged with making sure that you're aware of those opportunities and linking you up with those that are most appropriate to you one of those is why we're here today called code Iowa and that's our attempt to localize the hour of code to Iowa and getting more Iowans whether it's parents grandparents kids educators businesspeople lawmakers you name it everyone across Iowa to try one hour of computer coding during computer science education week which is December sent through the 11th I believe just two weeks away and so with code Iowa what we do it's a really a twopart thing the first part is we give away what we call code Iowa technology awards we're giving away six this year however that application closed just last Friday so that opportunity has since closed but it's an annual thing under thirty five hundred dollars to buy instructional technology for your classroom both are sponsored by google and verizon they've been gracious partners in that capacity and so we'll be announcing who those awardees are during computer science education week however there's still a thing for you to get involved in and that is you need to register your event on the hour of code website if you go to our code calm and just scroll towards the bottom of the page there's a join us um place where you put you know what your organization is what your first and last name is I think an email very simple just to say that yes I'm hosting an event in Iowa and this is what it's going to look like and your name will be put on a list on the arm code website where we'll pull from and say these are all of the all of the organizations in Iowa that participate in the hour of code they are now being certified code iowa partners is what we call them and every one of those people on that list will be eligible for computer science trainings that we are planning some in partnership with kota bowl some with oracle academy and some with code org as well coming in the spring and summer of 2017 so if you haven't already registered your event on that website and we'll make sure you get added to that list otherwise I guess I think Gretchen said we wanted to open it for a couple of questions Gretchen I'm seeing any yet that that we can address and regards this the stem Council and what we do I'm not seeing any yet I can we can wait a couple seconds and see if we have any group any role in um I should have said ahead of time you guys can send us questions through Twitter at Kota bowl if you're following a new one use social media if you want to use the chat we've got to check out up here on the left hand side if you're in google hangouts um otherwise if you want to post to the YouTube page where you're watching live you can also do that um so I've got all of those things up if you want to post your question we'll wait a couple minutes our minute or so and see if we have anything roll in um I have a couple of questions for you angel um just while we're waiting uh so what do you think uh you know is one of the challenges that Iowa educators are facing you know getting started with an hour of code is there anything that you guys do to kind of help them overcome that well I think the biggest thing is it's um it's not a new topic at all computer science has been around for a while but it's another hour ago there's not a lot of people who are actually doing it in the schools and that's because right now Iowa doesn't really have a system of getting more computer science into the schools in all of the schools as well you know you think of libraries museums Girl Scouts Boy Scouts there's all sorts of organic organizations taking this on to and I think co.org is a really great job of getting those people who are first hearing about computer science and connecting so how to get that going so instead of us trying to create that what we've done is really latching on to the latching onto code.org and really promoting that as strongly as we can across the state as a means to get that going and from there they can take it and run with it and make it what what they want because I can set at this point there's not really a system in place that says kind of what that's going to look like there is however why sure there was some state legislation that was turned down Oliver I believe there is more calm than pipe we could say that is focused on computer science that we can hope to see past this year's well I don't know too many details on that but I think in the coming month I might have more information so apparent just say that all i'm following that you can always reach out to me as well and i can share it with ok and then um it's good to hear what you guys are doing you know at a state level but what are some of the things that people can find locally if they you know are reaching out to try and find some support within their town or city you know where they can look to that i would say i would point you to we have six regional send managers across the state and those you know we broke iowa up into six pieces of the pie and in each of those regions there's what we call regional sim manager that's house that either one of the regent universities or at a community college and that person is the one that's really charged with making sure that that educator whether they're in for out of school is connected with you know those those opportunities that they're interested in so at the state level me being just the voice of stem and i can tell you off the top of my head you know oh there is you know this organization and mists you know southern part of iowa that's really good that would be something that our managers would know and they're really good about connecting those pieces for us so if you have an interest in learning more about who your regional manager is you go to iowa stem gov / regions i'll put this in the now perfect and they can find their regional manager based on what city they are located in awesome okay great and then my last question I'm not seeing anything coming in let me check Twitter one more time but um do you know I know that a big concern for a lot of people when they're talking about getting started with coding and especially dating it beyond you know the hour of code is cost and there's a lot of free things that are available but you know for people who know they want to do a full k25 roll out or that you know k to 12 even and cost can be a major concern for them what are some ways that they can go about finding financial resources and what are some that exists just to give people an idea of what's available for them well I can think of two things off the top of my head the first one up is pretty easy and that's better what I mentioned earlier if you're wanting to continue pursuing computer science down the road beyond you know just the neck in the next two weeks we have those computer science training so again you want to make sure you get your a bit register and what happens is we put you on a list will send you information about all these trainings that were planning on having in the spring and summer and those trainings are naturally pretty already which is great however you know to get out of the classroom is actually go to these trainings there's travel that you have to live take on and there's also the faculty of the paper substitute teacher to take over the classroom while you're gone and what's nice to us again through google and verizon were able to help supplement those additional costs beyond the actual training to actually get you there on to participate the second thing too is what what the same counsel really wants to do is help bring communities together we want businesses and educators to connect because that's what's ultimately going to help feed the future pipeline talent pipeline of iowa and that community is going to look different across the state there are different sort of industries in each of these little communities so maybe you have a business in your city that is really reliant on technology or really reliant on computer science take this idea to them say we want to get you know co double in our classroom where we want to get um you know some other known a computer science software to teach our students these ins and outs of it um you know reach out to them bring them the cost pitch it to them there's businesses are more eager to get involved with the schools and I think most of us really imagine and that's one of the things that we've seen through the stem council because we are so involved not only with education but also with economic development I think if you just reach out to the local community aspect and tap into that you're really going to see some things at them awesome okay well thank you so much for joining us um I I'm not saying anything but I can I share people with people who have questions I maybe at the end or throughout can I share your contact information with them oh yeah of course please go ahead perfect i will post that on the YouTube page and on the event page in facebook as well so that they have that all right thank you so much have a great evening and a happy thanksgiving for Prince Gretchen all right bye bye okay everybody um so that was angel and it sounds like um there's a lot of great things out there for everybody um you know who's interested in going beyond an hour of code but also getting started you know we've got a lot of really cool opportunities in Iowa and to be honest with you all that you know there's things that are offered in Iowa that I haven't seen in many other states and so you guys are very fortunate i'm really excited to be partnering with the governor's office and with iowa stem and with code iowa it's really exciting to see you know then making a change in their state so um that's really great we're going to go ahead and jump into what the hour of code is why it's important um and and go from there so the hour of code is an event that started about three years ago through a partnership between cobourg and computer science education week and these two groups got together they wanted to take an opportunity to provoke computer science to every person especially students so that they can see what it can do to just try one hour one hour of coding um and so that naturally with the name came about the hour of code um the week changes every year but it's usually the first week of December and that's computer science education week and so it's a really big movement to get kids just excited about computer science to get your communities excited about computer science to get your colleagues and your administrators excited about what can come of showing kids you know maybe not expecting every child to become a programmer but just showing them the opportunities that are available for learning how to code and what kind of things can open up to them if they do decide to pursue learning to code and so you know it's a really fun week it's my favorite week of the year it's the biggest holiday for me so um it's just very exciting there's such a great sense of community that comes out of it just everybody sharing about it and everyone's talking and there's a real buzz in the school that you don't wrote that you don't always feel you know it's easy to get caught up in the procedures and and the daytoday grind but you know it's just a really fun way to learn new things learn problem solving in an interesting way that we don't do every year so every day um so that's that's a little bit about you know the hour of code and why it's important um you know obviously learning to code is a very important thing for our future information and for our kids there's going to be two hundred or there's going to be two million open computer science jobs in by 2020 and so having kids be prepared to you know go into the workforce with a little bit of an understanding of computer science if not you know fluent in a programming language gives them a huge opportunity when they give into a workforce and when they go and beyond and so doing everything that we can to prepare them for that is crucial so we'll go ahead and jump into what to expect with the hour of code and and how you can get started we're going to focus mostly on co double and how to get started with code but do cool shirt mention of it is just a phenomenal partner we've been partnering with them for three years along with a lot of other companies and they provide tons and tons of tutorials for free french caters to get started this year we have 19 that we have promoted through code org and I know that there's no hundreds of others that are available and so if you go to code org slash learn um you can find a lot of great resources available to our code website as well there's a lot of great stuff to view into you know sort of figure out what you think is best for your students and what you want to work on or take a look at what's available i may keep going um perspective but i know we do a lot of work we've been start we started know about in august getting our tutorials prepared so that it would be as easy as possible for people who just find us on you know that site and can it go through you know every step of the way we hold their hand and then make sure that they're ready for the big event during the hour of code and so you'll find that a lot of the tutorial partners are very eager to help very willing to it you know guide you if you do have questions but the tutorials are really helpful and knowing exactly what you can do with your students I know this year code.org is excited to be promoting more lesson plans we've provided lesson plans just about every year that we've participated but I know a lot of others are providing lesson plans as well um so let's go ahead and dive in and i'll be sure to you no answer any questions that come up so if you do have questions there's a chat window on the side of the the youtube chick page where this is streaming and you can also comment or you can tweet at me and again our twitter handle is at go to bowl and so you can always tweet at co dab'll and i'll be sure to answer your questions so if no one has questions right now then I'll keep going alright so um you can find all of the quotable hour of code resources at co double com / our dash of dash code and i'll go ahead and show you what we've got available there see here from working really hard at getting this up and ready for you guys so um excited for you to see it okay so you can see here um this is our hour of code site we've got a lot of great resources here if you want to go to our lesson plans we've got over 19 lesson plans our curriculum director working tirelessly assembling all of these for you guys she was an elementary school teacher for many years and he's been working with us for the past year and just completely revamped our curriculum but if she's thrilled to be able to offer you guys some hour of code specific tutorials um so if you click on any of these you can see we've got four categories we've got beginner programming advanced programming robotics and then what I'm most excited about this year is ela and programming we know that you know for a big big challenge is finding time in the day for computer science and how can you fit it into your schedule and there's already so many things we need to teach how in the world am I going to teach something new um well the way to you know sort of fitted in is integrating it with what you're already teaching and so we put together an ela lesson plan and then you can see the standards that are taught with each of these lessons on you know on these icons a lesson plan that covers a standard for each grade level in writing and also helps teach some programming so let's go ahead and take a look at the kindergarten one the way that our lessons are structured is um it follows a typical lesson lesson structure or a lesson cycle we do a few minutes of direct instruction where we you know open up and talk start a discussion with students about what is computer science and why is this important and put it in terms that they can understand and relate it to their world and it's this is all completely scripted you can see here and then we introduce the new material we talk about you know what we're going to be doing here why why it's important and how we can work together and in this example they're going to be doing sentence puzzles so putting together a sentence and learning the structure of a sentence and how that relates to sequence which is an important concept in programming it's really the first and most fundamental concept that we teach to students especially for kindergarteners you know we start putting things in order a computer is a machine that reads things in a very specific order it will only read things in the order that we tell it to and so that is why putting things in the correct order is the most important thing to learn in the most foundational concepts for students or when we're getting started with computer science um and with programming and so that's what we go over in this lesson in obviously there's some clear tie into ela and so three or four kilo directors and a fantastic job in putting together these lesson plans so that you can do know some writing with your kids while you're doing some programming and then after doing the independent or the the direct instruction you can move into some guided practice where everybody works together so using a sentence puzzle follow their own graphic organizers and hens they'll be able to copy a sentence puzzle and fill it out and they do that together and then independent practice you can do a little bit of programming together um and so each lesson you know finishes with a closing exit ticket eh and everybody really understands you know what we learned here today what is sequence what are sentences and how are they structured and going on from there and each of these ela lesson plans is actually set up to be appropriate for I'm sorry to be appropriate for each grade level so in fifth grade you know rather than doing sentence puzzles um you know they're writing a short story doing a little bit of creative writing and working together on that so um and that's just our ela lesson plans we have robotics which features Dash and dot of wonder workshop um some advanced so you can start learning some JavaScript and objectoriented programming with your upper elementary students doing conditions and advanced sequencing with your kindergartners so these are some of our advanced lesson plans and they all follow that same structure of you know direct instruction independent practice and some direct instruction guided practice and an independent practice with the the final section of independent practice being done in Kota belong screen everything else has done offscreen together as a class so that really helps give kids a tangible example of what you're going to be learning why it's important and relating it to their real world into their daytoday which is crucial when you're talking about such abstract technology technological concepts and so once you complete you know the first two sections of these lessons where you know you make sure you introduce it vocabulary to do the direct instruction you do a guided practice activity together I'm in this one you know it's a dance party where you put together a loop to music you know say the chicken dance you know you're in a repeat portions which would be programming concept called a loop and then you can um once you've done those four sections you can jump into independent practice oh you know for five to ten fifteen minutes where the kids are coding together or independently on their devices so it's really a holistic approach to teaching CS making sure that we're taking things you know slowly and offscreen in learning in in a lot of different ways for every type of learner and then coming together at the end and bringing out the technology and really putting our new concept into practice um so you can find all of these lesson plans like I said on our hour of code landing page down here at the bottom I'll go ahead and put the link in the chat window for you and that's where you can go to find all of those um does anybody have any questions on anything that I've covered so far just check my locations for questions doesn't look like yet um ok so let us go ahead and continue um so once you have your lesson plan and and you've decided what you want to do there's a couple of things you're going to need to set up for your kids to get started you know you do the lesson and then you want them to be able to you know as quickly as possible or as seamlessly as possible with a class full of you know 2011 tree school students to jump into other independent practice portion and so where you're going to have them go is this this section right here students get started play now that's going to take them to game notable calm / hour of code if you have a coda Bowl class setup and you want to use that you can click play with a class source student code if you don't have a code will account a quotable teacher account or class setup just click play without saving and that will let them create a session right here just for the hour of code without having to set it up ahead of time and then they're often running straight into horrible and they can get going and learning you know right just by hitting play I'll take them to the first lesson humble in size get to meet me so you can see it's really fresh once they've been taught about hospice concept of sequence which is boiler in here I can jump in and start doing some coding on their own and use my little mill around the room if your parent is they are in volunteering no that's always helpful to listen to start solving puzzles and there are some awesome sobbing and learning about sequence I'm dragging and dropping arrows and putting them into the correct sequence if you're going to be doing a word fast concept then you're probably an experienced co double user and so I would suggest signing in with your class code we I'll show you how to do that real quickly but first if you want them to be able to come back later just copy this student code and they can login with this another day if you want to use your class code do an advanced lesson do your class code came back co double common and play with class code i'm going to enter my class code then the students will be able to select their name from this list from the roster that i've imported ahead of time you choose my name and then depending on what lesson they're doing you will have them go to the to the corresponding levels incredible so let's say we wanted to do let's say we wanted to do conditions with our students which is the first grade advanced concept I would have them log in and go to the section on condition that corresponds with what's on the list early and you can see the corresponding levels you can see the corresponding levels here so we're going to do L loops sorry not conditions it's loops so you're going to do loopy lessons 3.12 3.5 and you'll be able to find that in the game and they'll be able to login I know so with your lessons there you go one through five that's the ones that they're going to be doing and this will take them between 10 to 15 minutes to do all of our lessons are about about 50 minutes long which seems to be in a standard for what you know the time that most people have set aside for this so that's how to get started with countable and use co double for the hour of code um but I want to go ahead and jump into you know what to expect the day of um and and you know how you can kind of build excitement around around the hour of code stop so there's some things that you can do to really build excitement on the day of and to know what to expect if this is your first hour of code a lot of people you know have been doing it for a few years but if it's your first time um there's plenty of people around you whether it's on social media or you know angel or you know the local stem a representative who can help you I kind of get started there's a lot of people you can reach out to for advice but I'll just quickly run through some of the things that I see and you know talk about what to expect on the day of um so there's uh there's always the expectation that things need to go perfectly and as an elementary school teacher you know that that things are always going to come up with there's always going to be some transitions and some learning opportunities for every lesson and so the hour of code is no different just because it's different material doesn't mean that you know your lesson needs to be any different um so what you do what to expect is you know to just know that developers do their best to make their sites run effectively and efficiently but you know there's going to be times where it doesn't work or the servers are overloaded and just have a screen free option as a backup I know that that may seem counterintuitive to learning to cook but with elementary school kids it's actually the best way to get started and so that's why all of our lessons can be completed offline the group practice is a big part of learning and is all done offline and unplugged so using any of our lesson plans you'll have a screen free option available if for some reason um you know a sites not working um the other thing to expect is used lots of excitement and joy and learning we have a lot of great student resources um you know to show your kids some videos of other kids talking about why it's fun to learn to code and why it's important and what's some things that they've learned and I'll share that with you in the resources section at the end of the at the end of the webinar but there's also some great resources available through code org they've got some great videos so celebrities talking about why it's important to learn to code to kind of build back type before you get into the lesson and so um I would say to do some of that and then also expect a lot of interest from parents and other teachers don't be afraid to invite others to come into your classroom and just sit and watch inevitably they're going to jump in and they're going to want to be involved and you're going to get their hands dirty with you so you always have a network of people who fall back on if things aren't going exactly that you planned um and then the other thing is to expect to have a lot of questions from kids about things and you know don't use use your normal teaching strategies for answering those questions asked 3 than need you know ask your partner think pair share doing some things to help take the pressure off of you to have all of the answers and work together to problemsolve that's one of the beautiful things about learning to code is it's such a great way to reach out to others and use a community to learn things um and really foster that culture within your classroom so so those are some things to expect I'll go ahead and quickly walk you through how you can get started and get rolling for after the hour of code and the best way to do that is to create a quotable teacher account so that you can log in with a class code and you can have your students saving their progress easily and seamlessly and locking in but you know with the full roster ahead of time so we'll i'll quickly walk you through that and um yeah so but if anybody has any questions feel free to send them my way I'm listening okay so go ahead and share my screen okay now from the hour of code site for more hour of code page you can um get started select teacher you're going to put in your contact information I'm going to be a teaching and it's just going to walk you through you know what we were talking about about how our lessons are structured and you know how you can teach with koda bowl and how r curriculum is set up this is a quick you know tutorial about and direct instruction group practice independent practice walking you through using sequence as the example i'll go ahead and log into my account so you can see what it looks like once you're through all of this um so once you're in here you can see there's videos explaining each concept and then there's you've got a classes and students page and you can actually track your students progress so I'm going to go ahead and show you how to add a class um you just need to set up your class names i'm going to need my room 5g across code you can frisk me anything i suggest it being something that is easier for students to remember like your school mascot or your school street name or their classroom or your last name and something that they're going to be able to easily remember i'm going to just generate one you can also have two one generated for you you can change this at any time if you'd like for time i'm going to go ahead and generate it and then you just add your students so fat you can also copy and paste these up from a spreadsheet if he's like all right so it's already um I'm going to go to my class and I can see all my students um so that's how you go ahead and get your students imported but the real place to go is our courage one page and this is where you're going to find all the lesson plans for getting started with koda bowl and going beyond just the hour of code you know if you're just getting started teaching computer science the hour of code is a great way to do that and our lesson plans make it super simple to get started but I welcome you to explore this over the holiday break and kind of get a feel for some of the things that we offer to go beyond an hour of code we really really make it easy to offer a k25 scaffolded curriculum um to your students into your to your entire school if the hour of code is a success and if you really enjoy it and say how can I get more of this we offer a lot of these lesson plans for free you can try each and every one of our concepts with your students so you can see you know objectoriented programming with your upper elementary and you can get into some sequencing and conditions with your kindergarteners and first graders I'll show you one of those just say in an idea of what it looks like you can see it looks really similar to our hour of code lesson plans completely scripted guided practice independent practice um you know really getting the kids thinking offline and online and then each of these units offers an overview and explanation of the concepts so if you're thinking how am I going to teach about computer science if I don't know what it is um three has done a fantastic job of breaking it down each concept so that you can jump in feeling prepared I'm explaining what this concept is how it relates programming in a short quick video and then also with examples down below them so you can never you know you never have to feel like you don't know what you're teaching each each of these is is really easy to get through and so that is what I would suggest doing if you decide you want to go beyond an hour of code go ahead and get started set up your class you don't have to use it for the hour of code but you know it will be helpful for getting students signed in if you decide to UM and let me just check and see if we've got any questions let's see here doesn't look like we've got any questions so that is it um if anybody has any questions you can always reach out to me Gretchen at quotable com write my name and chat where you can reach out to Angel she's super helpful she's you know a great resource and she'll be able to point you in the right direction for how to get help locally in Iowa and I really am excited for you guys to get started with the our code if you have you know um some exciting stories during that week feel free to tweet them at us or share them with us we love hearing from teachers especially that week um so yeah alright everybody thank you so much and have a happy Thanksgiving
