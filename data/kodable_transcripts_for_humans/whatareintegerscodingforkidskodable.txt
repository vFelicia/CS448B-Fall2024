00:00 - let's go
00:04 - this is mo mo has fur that is black
00:09 - eyes that are brown and a tail that is
00:11 - feathery
00:13 - she also has a name of course now let's
00:16 - say you wanted to turn
00:17 - mo into a character for a video game
00:21 - all of these values that describe mo
00:23 - need to be written out in the code
00:25 - like this each value is represented with
00:28 - a string of letters
00:29 - so we call it a string now let's say you
00:32 - decide you want mo the game dog to have
00:35 - different color
00:35 - eyes first find the eyes variable in the
00:39 - code
00:40 - you can edit the value at stores by
00:42 - deleting it and typing something new
00:45 - like blue or green but
00:48 - strings aren't the only pieces of
00:50 - information that our program needs to
00:52 - keep track of
00:53 - for example mo is 9 years old but
00:56 - soon she'll be 10. we want to store the
00:59 - value of her age
01:00 - in a variable like this this way we can
01:04 - update or change the number value when
01:06 - we need to
01:08 - you can see that while some variables
01:10 - store a string
01:12 - like green other variables can store an
01:15 - integer an integer is just a whole
01:19 - number
01:20 - like 1 3 or 6
01:24 - if the number has any fractions or
01:26 - decimals
01:27 - then it's not an integer integers are
01:30 - whole
01:31 - let's look at another example mo has one
01:35 - treat one is an integer and we can store
01:38 - it in a variable but when she's a good
01:40 - girl she might get
01:42 - two or seven the variable
01:45 - treat stays the same but the integer
01:48 - value at stores can change
01:50 - this will also change the outcome a
01:53 - computer program
01:54 - for a game stores a lot of information
01:56 - as integers
01:57 - so number values can change or update
01:59 - while you play
02:00 - look you have an integer rank and coin
02:03 - count right here encodable
02:05 - this is an example of a game program
02:07 - storing an integer value
02:09 - that represents something like your
02:11 - score the fuzz family is learning all
02:13 - about integers too
02:15 - the last time we checked in with them
02:17 - they had just used their knowledge of
02:19 - strings to destroy the colorful asteroid
02:21 - field
02:22 - but now they have a new challenge
02:25 - they've run
02:25 - into asteroids that do not have string
02:28 - values
02:29 - see the numbers on them these asteroids
02:32 - have integer values
02:34 - here's how you can help the fuzz family
02:36 - start by looking at the integer values
02:38 - or
02:39 - numbers on the asteroids i see four
02:42 - then choose a matching numbered fuzzball
02:45 - this means one with the same
02:47 - integer value four
02:50 - tap the fuzzball to load the blaster
02:53 - and then tap to aim at an asteroid of
02:55 - the same value
02:56 - if the fuzzball integer meets an
02:58 - asteroid of equal value
03:00 - they will both clear and the fuzzes can
03:02 - pass through
03:04 - that's not all do you see any other
03:06 - examples of integers on the windscreen
03:09 - [Music]
03:10 - that's right the number of stars and
03:12 - coins you earn at the end are stored as
03:14 - integers too
03:16 - now that you've seen variables in
03:17 - astroradia what do you think
03:20 - why are integers so important in game
03:22 - design
03:24 - [Music]
03:27 - let's review a variable is like a
03:29 - container that stores a single value
03:31 - that can change
03:33 - some variables store values made up of
03:35 - letters
03:36 - like purple these are called strings
03:39 - other variables can store a value that
03:41 - represents a whole number
03:43 - like two these are called integers
03:46 - there's actually another mystery type of
03:48 - variable we use in codable
03:50 - but we'll keep that a secret until our
03:51 - next video
03:54 - happy coding

let's go this is mo mo has fur that is black eyes that are brown and a tail that is feathery she also has a name of course now let's say you wanted to turn mo into a character for a video game all of these values that describe mo need to be written out in the code like this each value is represented with a string of letters so we call it a string now let's say you decide you want mo the game dog to have different color eyes first find the eyes variable in the code you can edit the value at stores by deleting it and typing something new like blue or green but strings aren't the only pieces of information that our program needs to keep track of for example mo is 9 years old but soon she'll be 10. we want to store the value of her age in a variable like this this way we can update or change the number value when we need to you can see that while some variables store a string like green other variables can store an integer an integer is just a whole number like 1 3 or 6 if the number has any fractions or decimals then it's not an integer integers are whole let's look at another example mo has one treat one is an integer and we can store it in a variable but when she's a good girl she might get two or seven the variable treat stays the same but the integer value at stores can change this will also change the outcome a computer program for a game stores a lot of information as integers so number values can change or update while you play look you have an integer rank and coin count right here encodable this is an example of a game program storing an integer value that represents something like your score the fuzz family is learning all about integers too the last time we checked in with them they had just used their knowledge of strings to destroy the colorful asteroid field but now they have a new challenge they've run into asteroids that do not have string values see the numbers on them these asteroids have integer values here's how you can help the fuzz family start by looking at the integer values or numbers on the asteroids i see four then choose a matching numbered fuzzball this means one with the same integer value four tap the fuzzball to load the blaster and then tap to aim at an asteroid of the same value if the fuzzball integer meets an asteroid of equal value they will both clear and the fuzzes can pass through that's not all do you see any other examples of integers on the windscreen that's right the number of stars and coins you earn at the end are stored as integers too now that you've seen variables in astroradia what do you think why are integers so important in game design let's review a variable is like a container that stores a single value that can change some variables store values made up of letters like purple these are called strings other variables can store a value that represents a whole number like two these are called integers there's actually another mystery type of variable we use in codable but we'll keep that a secret until our next video happy coding
