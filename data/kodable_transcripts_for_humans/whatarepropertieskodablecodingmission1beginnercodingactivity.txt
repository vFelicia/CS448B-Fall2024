00:01 - this is the fuzz family you might notice
00:04 - that no two fuzzes look exactly the same
00:07 - some have blue eyes some are rainbow
00:09 - some are different accessories
00:12 - just from looking you can tell that blue
00:15 - is different from Prism but how
00:18 - they look different because they have
00:20 - different properties
00:23 - a property is a feature or
00:25 - characteristic belonging to something
00:27 - you have properties that make you human
00:30 - like hands ears and a nose
00:33 - fuzzes have properties too
00:36 - they have a body eyes
00:39 - and a mouth
00:41 - fuzzes share many properties but they
00:43 - might look different from fuzz to fuzz
00:46 - all fuzzes have a body color body color
00:49 - is a property but you can change the
00:51 - body color for example the body color
00:54 - for blue fuzz is blue while the body
00:57 - color for Simon is green
01:00 - you try
01:02 - what's the body color of Shaggy
01:05 - here I go what about princess
01:09 - properties are important because they
01:11 - help us tell all the fuzzes apart
01:13 - [Music]
01:16 - today you are going to explore fuzz
01:19 - properties and choose from different
01:21 - categories to build your own fuzz
01:25 - this is the fuzz Builder
01:27 - at the bottom you'll see five categories
01:32 - here's your mission build your own fuzz
01:35 - character using three properties and two
01:38 - functions
01:42 - okay how can you do this first look
01:45 - through all the categories
01:47 - then select your items
01:53 - make sure you count your lines of code
01:55 - you should be adding five lines to the
01:57 - existing code
02:00 - for example if I only choose a body and
02:03 - eyes then I've selected properties from
02:06 - two categories and have added two lines
02:08 - of code
02:11 - and a silly looking fuzz that's
02:12 - incomplete
02:15 - you can fix that by building the rest of
02:17 - your fuzz
02:26 - when you're done compare your fuzz to
02:29 - someone else's
02:31 - are your fuzzes the same what is similar
02:34 - about your fuzz's properties
02:37 - what is different
02:39 - now it's your turn open fuzz Builder
02:43 - build a fuzz and complete your mission
02:47 - you're looking to use three properties
02:50 - and two functions good luck
