00:00 - hey this is Gretchen today we're going
00:02 - to cover sequence one of the building
00:04 - blocks of programming I'm gonna start
00:07 - and Smee Borg lesson one two three role
00:13 - sequences like order of events you have
00:15 - to be really specific when you're giving
00:17 - instructions in programming in codable
00:20 - the blue guy his name is fuzz he
00:22 - represents the computer computers are
00:25 - basically really really dumb pieces of
00:28 - hardware and they need instructions in
00:30 - order to do anything the symbols
00:32 - represent programming commands we use
00:35 - these to give your fuzz instructions
00:37 - once we drag and drop them into the bins
00:40 - they represent your code and we're going
00:42 - to drag and drop the commands in order
00:45 - to get them to the end of the maze first
00:48 - we're going to go forward then we're
00:50 - going to go down and then we're going to
00:52 - go right this teaches kids how specific
00:56 - you need to be when you're programming
00:59 - that's it thanks
