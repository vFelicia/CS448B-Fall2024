00:00 - reading and writing are a lot like
00:02 - computer programming when we read a
00:04 - story we follow an order of events or
00:07 - sequence from the first line to the last
00:11 - we have to for the storyline or plot to
00:13 - make sense
00:15 - have you ever read a book by opening it
00:17 - in the middle flipping back to the first
00:19 - sentence and then reading the last page
00:21 - no way this would be really confusing
00:24 - in a computer program sequence is just
00:27 - as important
00:28 - we instruct computers by giving them
00:30 - directions written in code
00:33 - if we write code in the wrong sequence
00:36 - the program won't make sense to the
00:37 - computer just like stories don't make
00:40 - sense to us if the events are out of
00:42 - order
00:43 - now think about your life as if it were
00:45 - a storybook
00:47 - pretty cool right
00:48 - but unlike a story that has a set
00:50 - sequence of events
00:52 - your life can take twists and turns
00:54 - based on the conditions around you
00:57 - in other words life is filled with ifs
01:00 - if it is sunny
01:02 - then you go outside
01:06 - if you are tired
01:07 - then you sleep
01:10 - if it is halloween then you might dress
01:13 - up
01:14 - all of these ifs are what keep life
01:16 - interesting you see your day will change
01:19 - based on the conditions around you and
01:22 - the choices you make in response
01:24 - this is awesome because it means no two
01:26 - days are exactly the same
01:29 - have you ever read a choose your own
01:32 - adventure book
01:33 - if not what do you think this type of
01:35 - book is about
01:38 - these are stories where you have some
01:39 - control over the path the story takes
01:42 - sort of like in real life
01:44 - you start with a single order of events
01:47 - but as you read you will get a choice
01:50 - and the storyline will branch in many
01:53 - possible directions based on the
01:54 - conditions you choose
01:57 - the ending you get to might not be the
01:59 - same one as your friend
02:01 - for every choice you make in a book like
02:03 - this
02:04 - you complete a conditional statement
02:07 - those are the if then statements we were
02:09 - talking about before
02:11 - if you choose option 1
02:14 - then something will happen
02:16 - but if you choose the other option
02:19 - then the path the story takes will be
02:21 - totally different
02:23 - so what does this have to do with coding
02:25 - well just like a choose your own
02:27 - adventure author
02:29 - programmers also use conditional
02:31 - statements like this to make their code
02:33 - more dynamic and interesting
02:36 - here's your mission
02:38 - combine programming and storytelling use
02:41 - a conditional statement to write the
02:43 - ending of a short story
02:46 - here's how it works there are three
02:48 - picture prompts think of these as the
02:51 - multiple options in a choose your own
02:53 - adventure book
02:54 - ask yourself what would happen if one of
02:58 - these conditions were true
03:00 - choose one of the images
03:03 - then what would happen next
03:06 - write a short story describing the
03:08 - ending
03:09 - get creative the possibilities are
03:11 - endless
03:12 - you can pause the video here to choose
03:14 - your picture and write your story
03:19 - awesome work
03:20 - looking for a bonus coding adventure you
03:23 - can also practice using conditions in
03:26 - codable's mazemaker
03:28 - here we use colored tiles to represent
03:30 - conditions these tiles will make your
03:33 - program more dynamic and colorful
03:36 - after you draw your maze look for spots
03:39 - where your fuzz will have multiple
03:41 - options for where to roll
03:43 - for example here my fuzz can move
03:45 - straight or
03:47 - turn down
03:48 - i want to place a condition tile at this
03:51 - point to tell my fuzz
03:53 - if pink
03:54 - then turn down to collect the stars
03:58 - now it's time to test my maze
04:00 - if i don't put a condition in my program
04:04 - then my fuzz will move straight
04:07 - let's try again
04:10 - if pink
04:12 - then turn down this condition is true so
04:16 - my fuzz will change directions
04:18 - we did it
04:20 - now it's your turn if you haven't
04:22 - already pick one of the three images and
04:25 - use the condition to write a short story
04:28 - then practice using conditioned tiles to
04:30 - make a dynamic program in the codable
04:33 - maze maker
04:35 - good luck

Cleaned transcript:

reading and writing are a lot like computer programming when we read a story we follow an order of events or sequence from the first line to the last we have to for the storyline or plot to make sense have you ever read a book by opening it in the middle flipping back to the first sentence and then reading the last page no way this would be really confusing in a computer program sequence is just as important we instruct computers by giving them directions written in code if we write code in the wrong sequence the program won't make sense to the computer just like stories don't make sense to us if the events are out of order now think about your life as if it were a storybook pretty cool right but unlike a story that has a set sequence of events your life can take twists and turns based on the conditions around you in other words life is filled with ifs if it is sunny then you go outside if you are tired then you sleep if it is halloween then you might dress up all of these ifs are what keep life interesting you see your day will change based on the conditions around you and the choices you make in response this is awesome because it means no two days are exactly the same have you ever read a choose your own adventure book if not what do you think this type of book is about these are stories where you have some control over the path the story takes sort of like in real life you start with a single order of events but as you read you will get a choice and the storyline will branch in many possible directions based on the conditions you choose the ending you get to might not be the same one as your friend for every choice you make in a book like this you complete a conditional statement those are the if then statements we were talking about before if you choose option 1 then something will happen but if you choose the other option then the path the story takes will be totally different so what does this have to do with coding well just like a choose your own adventure author programmers also use conditional statements like this to make their code more dynamic and interesting here's your mission combine programming and storytelling use a conditional statement to write the ending of a short story here's how it works there are three picture prompts think of these as the multiple options in a choose your own adventure book ask yourself what would happen if one of these conditions were true choose one of the images then what would happen next write a short story describing the ending get creative the possibilities are endless you can pause the video here to choose your picture and write your story awesome work looking for a bonus coding adventure you can also practice using conditions in codable's mazemaker here we use colored tiles to represent conditions these tiles will make your program more dynamic and colorful after you draw your maze look for spots where your fuzz will have multiple options for where to roll for example here my fuzz can move straight or turn down i want to place a condition tile at this point to tell my fuzz if pink then turn down to collect the stars now it's time to test my maze if i don't put a condition in my program then my fuzz will move straight let's try again if pink then turn down this condition is true so my fuzz will change directions we did it now it's your turn if you haven't already pick one of the three images and use the condition to write a short story then practice using conditioned tiles to make a dynamic program in the codable maze maker good luck
