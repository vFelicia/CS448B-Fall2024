00:02 - think about your favorite games
00:04 - have you ever wondered how they were
00:05 - made or why they look the way they do
00:09 - there are a lot of steps and different
00:11 - jobs involved in creating a game
00:14 - today you will practice these steps as
00:16 - you design and test your own computer
00:18 - game encodable
00:20 - here's your mission
00:22 - design your own asteroid blaster game
00:25 - select variables and modify their values
00:28 - to customize the way your game looks and
00:30 - functions
00:32 - so what goes into making a game
00:35 - well here at codable we have two
00:37 - programmers one designer one head of
00:39 - product and one project manager who
00:41 - collaborate and work together to make
00:43 - one game come to life
00:47 - let's start from the beginning though
00:48 - there are some basic steps that people
00:50 - go through in the process of making a
00:53 - game
00:54 - step 1 id8 what is the idea for your
00:57 - game
00:58 - step 2 design
01:00 - what will your game look like how will
01:02 - it work
01:03 - step 3 create
01:06 - program or develop your game
01:09 - step 4 test
01:11 - have other players play your game and
01:13 - give you feedback
01:14 - step 5 iterate
01:16 - what is working and what isn't
01:19 - repeat this process to continue to
01:21 - improve your game over time
01:24 - let's take a look at this process in
01:26 - codable's game designer
01:32 - we've already taken care of step one and
01:34 - come up with the idea for this game the
01:36 - goal is to clear the colored asteroids
01:38 - with the fuzzballs
01:40 - today you will help with the rest of the
01:42 - steps
01:44 - here's what you'll do
01:45 - [Music]
01:46 - open the game settings code and take a
01:48 - look at the variables that you can add
01:50 - or change here at the bottom
01:52 - if you decide to add the game background
01:55 - variable then you can choose the value
01:58 - for example i can make the value stars
02:01 - or galaxy and change the way my game's
02:04 - background looks for a player
02:08 - let's look at another example this time
02:10 - in the asteroids file
02:13 - asteroid drop direction is a variable
02:16 - right now the value assigned to it is
02:18 - down
02:19 - i can change this value to up
02:23 - now the asteroids clear by moving up
02:27 - in programming we refer to variables
02:29 - with values that are words like up or
02:32 - down as string
02:34 - variables but some variables can have
02:37 - number values
02:39 - in the bins file
02:41 - if i assign a value of 5 to the number
02:43 - bins variable
02:45 - then i have more asteroids to play with
02:48 - number of bins stores a number value so
02:51 - we call this an integer variable
02:55 - select more variables and assign or
02:57 - modify their values to design the rest
02:59 - of your game
03:00 - be sure to save your code by clicking
03:02 - the green check mark each time
03:06 - you did it
03:07 - when you are done test it out
03:11 - trade with a partner for them to play to
03:12 - and get feedback
03:16 - finally iterate on your game based on
03:18 - the feedback from your partner that's
03:20 - what's so great about variables they can
03:22 - change
03:24 - for example if your friend says the game
03:26 - was too hard you will want to change the
03:28 - difficulty
03:30 - find the game difficulty variable
03:33 - and modify its value to be something
03:35 - easier
03:40 - [Music]
03:42 - don't forget building a game takes a lot
03:44 - of testing and improvements
03:46 - just look at how codable has changed
03:48 - over the years
03:49 - and we're not done yet
03:52 - now it's your turn
03:54 - open game designer create a game
03:57 - and complete your mission
03:59 - remember you are looking to design your
04:02 - own asteroid blaster game
04:04 - you will select variables and modify
04:06 - their values to customize the way your
04:09 - game looks and functions
04:12 - good luck
