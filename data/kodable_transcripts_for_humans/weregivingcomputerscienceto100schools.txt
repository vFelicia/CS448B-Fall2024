00:37 - that you can really create a ton of
00:38 - value without having a ton of resources
00:40 - store yeah so that's why we have always
00:45 - been committed to making programming
00:46 - accessible to all students
00:48 - so today we're putting our money where
00:50 - our mouth is from now until June we want
00:52 - to give codable to a hundred schools

01:09 - what we're doing but we're also calling
01:11 - on you if every person who used codable
01:14 - donated $20 we could provide computer
01:16 - science to the entire nation but we're
01:18 - not asking for that we're just asking
01:20 - for five dollars if you have five
01:21 - dollars to put toward computer science
01:23 - it's going to go towards giving a tour
