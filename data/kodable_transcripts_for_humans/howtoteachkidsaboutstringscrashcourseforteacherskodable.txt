00:01 - whoo-hoo
00:02 - let's go hi I'm Doreen I'm the director
00:06 - of curriculum at codable the short video
00:08 - is going to introduce you to the concept
00:10 - you'll be teaching in this unit thanks
00:11 - for watching
00:18 - variables store information in the
00:21 - program you can think of them like a box
00:23 - or a container with a label on it
00:25 - related to the items inside these items
00:28 - inside are called values and they can be
00:30 - stored as text or as numbers when you
00:33 - use variables in a program you're
00:35 - controlling the output of the program or
00:37 - what the user sees there are different
00:39 - types of variables used in different
00:41 - situations there are strings integers
00:44 - and arrays we're going to talk about
00:46 - string variables which are used to
00:48 - represent text strings hold groups of
00:51 - characters like a word or a phrase
00:54 - making it easier for programmers to read
00:56 - and work with an easy way to think about
00:59 - strings in real life is to think about
01:01 - the way that your brain stores people's
01:02 - names think about a person as a variable
01:05 - hear a name is simply a value that your
01:08 - brain uses to identify a person just
01:10 - like variables have values that can
01:13 - change or vary a person's name can
01:16 - change if they get married or when a
01:18 - friend starts calling them by a new
01:19 - nickname in programming strings allow
01:23 - programmers to easily store find or
01:25 - change information in the program in the
01:29 - final part of each lesson on string
01:31 - variables students will independently
01:33 - practice storing strings which are
01:35 - represented by colors
01:37 - when students put a colored fuzzball
01:40 - into the command bin they're assigning a
01:42 - value to a variable
01:43 - students will match the variable with an
01:46 - astroid type in order to clear the
01:48 - asteroid field
01:49 - when like asteroids touch in the
01:52 - asteroid field they'll automatically
01:54 - clear on their own students need to
01:56 - think critically and use as few
01:58 - variables as possible to clear the
02:00 - asteroid field in this level we can see
02:03 - how students will assign values to
02:05 - variables by using the colored fuzzballs
02:07 - on the left like variables will clear on
02:10 - their own so in this level students only
02:13 - need to clear the yellow asteroids using
02:15 - one yellow string let's think about how
02:18 - strings work in programming we can use a
02:21 - video game as an example and think about
02:23 - how a game developer can control what
02:25 - the players see a character's name eye
02:28 - color and hair color are sorta strings
02:31 - this makes it easy for a programmer to
02:33 - know or change what variables represent
02:36 - specific information in the program a
02:38 - programmer working on the game could
02:40 - type in the variable for a character's
02:42 - eye color for example and edit the value
02:45 - from blue to brown this would instantly
02:48 - change the character's eye color and
02:49 - what the player would see in the game
02:52 - strings make it easy for programmers to
02:54 - find information in their code and reuse
02:57 - values in their programs variables can
02:59 - change think very and strings allow
03:02 - programmers to easily read and change
03:05 - values that are assigned to different
03:06 - variables throughout their programs
03:13 - [Music]
03:18 - you
