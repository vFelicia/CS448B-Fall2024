00:07 - hello everyone welcome to codable
00:10 - show-and-tell my name is Hana basta and
00:12 - I'm the instructional coach here at
00:14 - codable the Show and Tell webinar series
00:16 - is a time for me to sit down with a
00:19 - teacher or a curriculum designer
00:22 - somebody using codable in their
00:25 - classroom and maybe they're using it in
00:27 - an interesting or different way or
00:29 - they're grappling with a common problem
00:31 - that other teachers might be facing as
00:33 - well and the goal of these talks is
00:36 - really for those of you who are watching
00:37 - to learn something new maybe it raises a
00:40 - question for you something you want to
00:42 - get answered but really just to get
00:44 - inspired by the awesome teachers who are
00:46 - using go to pool in their classrooms so
00:49 - today I am joined by Jaclyn laberge
00:52 - liger a Jacqueline thanks so much for
00:54 - joining us yeah
00:57 - Jaclyn is a rock star teacher using
00:59 - codable but I also just want to say that
01:03 - what she's doing in her classroom you're
01:05 - gonna hear all about it but it is
01:07 - something that those of you watching can
01:09 - definitely do in your classroom as well
01:10 - we have designed codable to be really
01:13 - accessible and Jacqueline's gonna tell
01:14 - you how she's using it and give you some
01:17 - tips and tricks so whatever she's
01:19 - talking about definitely feel free to
01:20 - give it a try and I'll have both of our
01:23 - contact information in the description
01:24 - box of this video so you can reach out
01:27 - to us if you have any questions but I'm
01:29 - gonna jump in to jacqueline asking you
01:31 - some questions and then this will just
01:33 - flow like a regular conversation so I'd
01:36 - love for you to first tell us a little
01:38 - bit about the school that you are
01:40 - teaching at kind of what your role is at
01:42 - that school tell us a little bit about
01:44 - the students and what you do okay so I
01:47 - teach at no Republican area schools
01:48 - which is a smaller school in the Upper
01:52 - Peninsula of Michigan I actually teach
01:55 - in every building I was hired to teach
01:57 - in high school I've traditionally been a
01:59 - high school teacher but when I first
02:01 - came here they went one-to-one the year
02:03 - that I came here every student in the
02:05 - entire district all the way down to
02:06 - early kindergarten has iPads I started
02:11 - as a high school teacher and helping
02:12 - with the technology distribution in the
02:13 - one to one and
02:15 - as I was here a year or two we started
02:18 - to want more and more technology classes
02:20 - so right now I'm actually teaching tech
02:21 - to every elementary student as a special
02:24 - and then I also teach to tech classes in
02:28 - the middle school and then I teach three
02:29 - different hours in the high school but
02:32 - they involve a lot of different tech
02:33 - classes like sometimes I'm teaching a
02:35 - couple of different tech classes at the
02:36 - same time so we have a lot of technology
02:38 - available here at this school
02:40 - yeah and we're a smaller school you know
02:45 - we have about almost 50% free and
02:47 - reduced lunch we did apply for the
02:49 - codable for every one award this year
02:51 - and we've won it and we're super excited
02:53 - about that could you tell people really
02:55 - quick just what a quick snippet of what
02:57 - that was about
02:58 - yeah so portable does offer quotable for
03:01 - everyone is a little mini award grant
03:05 - kind of application that you can make
03:08 - with Cobalt if you need certain
03:10 - standards like our school did and you
03:12 - show all the amazing things you're doing
03:14 - with codable you can win a year's grant
03:17 - of the entire quotable program which is
03:20 - a very wonderful amazing program that
03:22 - we're very fortunate to have right now
03:23 - and that's what happened with us and now
03:26 - we have quotable in our entire district
03:28 - and I use it from ek all the way up to
03:32 - fifth grade and then sometimes my sixth
03:36 - graders to actually they really love it
03:38 - even or 68 does a little bit incredible
03:41 - to cool I use the entire curriculum in
03:44 - my elementary school what is that like
03:46 - to be teaching so many different grades
03:49 - because I know a lot of teachers that
03:51 - are watching this or ever eat out to me
03:53 - are teaching K through five what is that
03:57 - like for you what's challenging about it
03:59 - it's challenging because yes I am all
04:03 - over the place I'm in every building so
04:05 - I'm running a lot and obviously like
04:08 - from a record standpoint when I log into
04:10 - my power school which is where we keep
04:11 - all of our records I have a lot of
04:14 - classes but I love it because I feel
04:16 - like it's very well for one thing I get
04:19 - to I get to know everybody in the
04:21 - elementary school they're very excited
04:23 - about technology
04:25 - I'm super-excited that they're learning
04:27 - coding already because I also teach AP
04:30 - Computer Science in the high school and
04:34 - obviously coding is really important to
04:36 - me I'm a computer science minor so this
04:39 - way I know that all of our students that
04:41 - are coming up are getting some really
04:43 - amazing coding experience before they
04:45 - even get up to the middle school or the
04:47 - high school and then so from that
04:49 - standpoint I love it because I get to
04:50 - meet everybody gets to know everybody
04:51 - and I get to control the curriculum
04:54 - that's happening or have a you know
04:56 - saying all the curriculum it's happening
04:57 - all the way up until they come up into
04:59 - high school with me so well and so you
05:04 - just mentioned that you studied computer
05:06 - science and I talked to a lot of
05:08 - teachers who do not have any background
05:10 - in computer science so I'm curious if
05:12 - you could say a little bit to that what
05:14 - is it like teaching young children
05:17 - coding when you yourself have a computer
05:19 - science background
05:20 - yes so computer science it's a pretty
05:23 - rare degree to have an education because
05:28 - don't choose to go into the education
05:31 - field but that's why I work with code
05:33 - I'm also a facilitator for code.org
05:35 - which is an amazing program as well and
05:37 - that's the curriculum we use in our
05:39 - middle spooner high school to teach
05:41 - computer science and we try to teach
05:44 - teachers no matter what degree they have
05:46 - it doesn't matter that they can still
05:49 - teach coding even if they've not don't
05:51 - have computer science to be themselves
05:52 - from a standpoint of having a computer
05:54 - science degree I think it's awesome and
05:56 - amazing that I can go in and see all
05:58 - those elementary students learning some
06:01 - of the really crazy like functions and
06:04 - loops and if-then decision structures
06:07 - even when they're as young as
06:09 - kindergarten yeah some of the kids are
06:11 - learning some of those concepts in such
06:13 - an amazing way I think I've said this
06:16 - before
06:17 - portable has an incredible way of making
06:20 - it all game oriented fun but really
06:23 - teaching perseverance and still getting
06:25 - in these concepts that you wouldn't
06:27 - think a kindergartner would be able to
06:29 - understand but yet with the moving of
06:32 - the maze and the way it's been taught it
06:34 - really does an amazing job of teaching
06:37 - so from a pure science standpoint I look
06:39 - at it and I think oh my god these kids
06:41 - are like doing functions but that
06:45 - doesn't mean either this coding program
06:52 - teaching coding is amazing no matter
06:53 - what I mean when I took a computer
06:56 - science degree obviously keep your
06:57 - science was in a much different language
06:59 - everything was different
07:01 - so it isn't like I feel like it's given
07:04 - me some sort of amazing advantage to
07:06 - teach it I feel like anybody could teach
07:09 - it I do feel very excited for the future
07:11 - though of these students because they're
07:13 - seeing some concepts and I believe
07:15 - sometimes by the time students get to
07:17 - high school understanding a function or
07:19 - understanding an if/then or a loop
07:20 - sometimes the perseverance isn't there
07:24 - or the logic just isn't there and they
07:26 - don't they feel like it's too late to
07:28 - learn it not that it's ever too late but
07:31 - I do love that these students will grow
07:32 - up with functions and events and loops
07:35 - and then they'll just be like yeah well
07:42 - so much of it is just that exposure at a
07:44 - young age that when they see it in you
07:46 - know JavaScript syntax later they're not
07:49 - afraid of it they know the basics what
07:53 - sorts of recommendations do you make to
07:54 - teachers who don't have that computer
07:57 - science background what kind of
07:59 - resources would you recommend for them
08:01 - or what would you say is just teaching
08:10 - that it's okay to be learning along with
08:12 - students I actually think that's such an
08:14 - amazing thing in any subject no matter
08:16 - what subject you're in no matter what
08:18 - you're teaching no matter what you do in
08:19 - education I think that when you build a
08:22 - community in your classroom a foundation
08:25 - where they know it's safe they know
08:27 - we're all learning together I think that
08:29 - if you're gonna do computer science and
08:31 - you don't have computer science degree
08:32 - you just need to let go and enjoy it and
08:35 - have fun learning it along with them
08:37 - because it is an incredible thing to
08:38 - learn and it is really good for many
08:40 - different things like I said including
08:42 - perseverance which is
08:44 - my favorite things that that students
08:46 - need to learn before they get out
08:48 - because we can Google everything you can
08:50 - persevere in anything if you have
08:52 - perseverance so I think from a teacher
08:59 - standpoint it's just a mindset it's a
09:02 - mindset of saying we're in this together
09:04 - you know I'm here to coach you it's okay
09:07 - if you found or discovered something
09:09 - that I haven't yet discovered I'm not
09:11 - here to make you think that I'm some
09:13 - authority on everything it's impossible
09:15 - to be an authority on everything in
09:17 - technology no matter who you are or what
09:21 - you're teaching or where you are that's
09:23 - an impossible feat so I think as a
09:25 - technology teacher who has been teaching
09:26 - technology for a while I know there was
09:29 - a point in my teaching career where I
09:31 - had to say you know what we are all in
09:32 - this together I'm not telling you we're
09:35 - all discovering together and any teacher
09:37 - with that mindset could be teaching
09:40 - really any level of code it could be in
09:43 - the elementary it could be in the middle
09:44 - school could be in the high school it
09:46 - could be at the college level as long as
09:48 - you're in it in that method that hey
09:50 - we're all discovering this together and
09:51 - we're all gonna succeed together so I'd
09:54 - say that's my number one thing is just
09:56 - that attitude that teachers need to have
09:58 - ya know that's so important because I
10:00 - also feel like if you're a new teacher
10:02 - and you're teaching coding which you
10:04 - don't know anything about maybe you're
10:06 - afraid just to admit that you don't have
10:08 - the answer but like you said building
10:11 - that class community where it's okay to
10:13 - take a risk and if you're wrong then
10:15 - you're learning it alongside your
10:16 - students which is great can you think of
10:19 - a time when you got stumped in class as
10:21 - a teacher or like when you didn't know
10:24 - the answer well I think from a computer
10:27 - stand computer science standpoint in the
10:29 - high school especially any time students
10:33 - are debugging a program and again this
10:35 - goes back to teaching technology for a
10:37 - long time if you've been teaching
10:38 - computer science computer programming at
10:41 - all quoting at all for a long time you
10:43 - know that there's times that students
10:45 - will have a bug in their program that
10:47 - you can't just walk up and look at it
10:49 - and instantly say oh this is what's
10:50 - wrong so I think from from like a
10:53 - debugging standpoint it happens all the
10:56 - computer science teachers you know you
10:58 - have to walk in there and go I can't
11:00 - pretend like I'm gonna know your answer
11:02 - immediately I mean obviously you've been
11:03 - working on this program for a long time
11:05 - here's all these lines of code you know
11:07 - there's a lot of things to do so I think
11:09 - that that happens all the time with
11:10 - debugging mmm I think that I'm very open
11:14 - to when a student is excited about
11:16 - something they've discovered even if
11:18 - it's something I do already know making
11:20 - it seem like they've discovered
11:21 - something maybe that we haven't had
11:23 - before because that's really rewarding
11:26 - to them you know for them to go out and
11:27 - go did you see that this is like it was
11:29 - excited because I just own this or I
11:31 - just learned this or I taught or
11:33 - something and actually codable because
11:35 - it's constantly changing codable does
11:38 - such an amazing job of keeping their
11:40 - curriculum up-to-date and keeping the
11:42 - kids on their toes and introducing new
11:45 - things to them a lot of times students
11:47 - will find something in codable that
11:48 - we've not yet discovered as a class and
11:50 - especially the students who run with it
11:52 - and they'll come up and they'll go hey
11:54 - this is like or did you see this yet or
11:55 - you know look what I did and look what
11:57 - level I met in codable and I loved it I
11:59 - didn't see that yet and that's really
12:02 - amazing that you can do that where
12:03 - there's always in computer science you
12:05 - know five different ways to do the same
12:07 - thing or they'll come up and say you
12:09 - know I I did it this way it's different
12:11 - than what everybody else did and you're
12:12 - just like that close me away and that's
12:14 - awesome mmm and once you have that
12:17 - established that in your classroom I
12:19 - think it's good for students but it's
12:21 - also good for you it takes off this you
12:24 - know pressure that you have to feel like
12:26 - you're you know some sort of authority
12:28 - that has to have the answer to
12:30 - everything and that's impossible
12:32 - and it's not good for the students
12:34 - teacher I mean it's good for them to see
12:36 - you as a human being yeah it's too
12:39 - exhausting to have all the answers all
12:40 - the time that would not be very fun I'm
12:42 - so speaking to like that level of
12:45 - excitement that you're talking about in
12:46 - your classroom I always equate that a
12:49 - lot with motivation and like when the
12:51 - students are excited to learn more
12:53 - they're super motivated to keep going
12:54 - what have you done in your own classroom
12:57 - with codable to try to like spark that
13:00 - motivation and excitement or maybe it's
13:02 - a lesson that you built about coding to
13:04 - get kids motivated but how do you foster
13:07 - motivation
13:09 - one thing about coding in general is
13:11 - that I I do promote coding in every
13:14 - level of our building in every way I can
13:15 - you might even notice actually yeah
13:18 - boosters I have everywhere and I don't
13:20 - just put them in my classroom I put him
13:23 - out in the hallways and um you know I
13:25 - try to I do try to talk to students
13:26 - one-to-one and group them with a group
13:29 - of students I'll try to talk to them
13:30 - about why coding is such a great thing
13:32 - right now and why would be a great thing
13:34 - for them to take interest in it in the
13:36 - elementary school honestly I don't feel
13:39 - like I've had to do a ton of motivation
13:41 - they are motivated and if I I feel like
13:45 - if I weren't introducing these things to
13:48 - them they would be finding them anyway I
13:49 - mean I think they go out and they find
13:52 - them and they get excited and then just
13:55 - being excited about what coding is about
13:57 - excites them too but you know we start
14:01 - in the beginning of the year well we
14:03 - start with a couple things we start with
14:04 - a video on growth mindset because I feel
14:08 - like and you know going back to the
14:10 - teacher to who thinks they can't teach
14:12 - computer science if you learn or study
14:14 - or even just google anything about
14:16 - growth mindset and just start believing
14:18 - in growth mindset or following it on
14:20 - Twitter where there's so many people who
14:22 - believe in growth mindset I think that
14:24 - establishing that is great because
14:26 - students get excited that they can try
14:28 - something that they know that if they
14:30 - don't get it right the first time it's
14:31 - not a wrong answer
14:33 - you're not gonna fail or we say you know
14:36 - like we watch this Khan Academy video
14:38 - the first day that you can learn
14:40 - anything failure is just another word
14:42 - for growing teaching that mentality gets
14:45 - them excited already yeah and then when
14:47 - they think you know what they go into
14:49 - codable and they think they're playing a
14:51 - game
14:51 - they are just instantly like this is so
14:55 - much fun I get to do this and then the
14:57 - fun part about it and and this is what I
14:59 - really love is I think that when they
15:02 - start and taking it's a game you know
15:05 - most kids will get bored with a game I
15:07 - think over time because there isn't much
15:09 - depth to the game or they'll go master
15:12 - it or whatever I think that when
15:14 - students actually discover that they're
15:15 - doing the coding part when they start to
15:18 - oh my god I really have to think in this
15:20 - game like I'm really thinking through
15:22 - this it actually gets them more excited
15:24 - because they're so excited to for those
15:26 - challenges to beat those challenges to
15:28 - get somewhere to accomplish something
15:30 - and then when they equate it to school
15:32 - and they're like this is like school
15:33 - like this is how it should feel
15:35 - it becomes very motivating on their own
15:37 - and you know I'm very into intrinsic
15:40 - motivation I think even in the high
15:42 - school too often students especially for
15:45 - some reason students who come from
15:46 - middle school always believe for some
15:48 - reason along the way that they're doing
15:49 - things in school for their teachers and
15:52 - teaching them that is not for their
15:54 - teachers it's for them you know you're
15:56 - doing this for your life to be better
15:58 - that intrinsic motivation all the way
16:01 - down to the elementary Accord well does
16:03 - such a great job of giving them that
16:04 - because they do they get through those
16:06 - challenges and it isn't just a game
16:08 - anymore
16:08 - yeah and they get it and then I think
16:11 - they come out and they really want more
16:13 - coding they want more technology too but
16:16 - they start to understand the difference
16:17 - between coding and technology which a
16:19 - lot of people in our country probably
16:21 - don't even understand the difference and
16:23 - they understand it and they want more of
16:25 - it I really want to understand this
16:33 - coding piece yeah and just like you were
16:37 - saying just to feel successful at school
16:40 - and we've talked a little bit about this
16:42 - and I'm sure you I'd love for you to
16:44 - share it with the viewers but like
16:46 - having some students that maybe aren't
16:49 - succeeding in other parts of school
16:51 - recognize that they are coding they are
16:53 - doing computer science and they are
16:55 - successful can you talk a little bit
16:57 - about that with what you've noticed the
16:59 - impact of coding on uncodable on yours
17:02 - to some of your students yes we talked
17:05 - about this once before because I said
17:07 - sometimes when I come into an elementary
17:08 - classroom especially you know there's a
17:11 - student that obviously either isn't that
17:14 - interested in his classroom work or you
17:18 - know whatever is happening in the
17:19 - classroom for some reason he's sitting
17:21 - right by the teacher's desk where she's
17:22 - sitting right by a teacher's desk where
17:23 - they're off to the side because they are
17:26 - you know
17:27 - maybe trouble focusing or whatever and a
17:30 - lot of times when they see they have
17:32 - control over something like that and
17:34 - they're able to you know succeed and
17:38 - like you said feel that success that
17:40 - intrinsic motivation and they realize
17:42 - I'm excited when they get through a
17:44 - level oftentimes those students really
17:47 - do better in coding then they may be
17:49 - traditionally are doing in some of the
17:51 - other subjects because they know they
17:53 - have control over it they know they have
17:54 - that ability to do what they want to do
17:57 - and move on and move forward especially
18:00 - in like codable is a good example of a
18:02 - program where you know if they're into
18:04 - it and they start moving they can move
18:07 - at their own rate and they can see hey
18:09 - I'm getting through this quickly and and
18:11 - I love it and I had one student in the
18:14 - ek this year who literally when I would
18:18 - walk in the door he would be waiting for
18:19 - me to open another level please tell me
18:22 - you've opened more levels I need more
18:23 - levels like that's how some students get
18:25 - and it's really rewarding and exciting
18:27 - because you know sometimes students who
18:30 - struggle with attention and who struggle
18:32 - in other subjects then sometimes also
18:34 - have behavior issues and I know I tend
18:38 - to be very optimistic in this way but I
18:40 - feel like when they have something that
18:42 - they're passionate about
18:43 - and when they have something that they
18:44 - know that they're good at it's gonna
18:46 - carry over into everything it's gonna
18:48 - carry over into those other subjects and
18:50 - it's gonna carry over into the classroom
18:51 - and they're gonna be like I have a
18:53 - purpose now when you give them that
18:54 - purpose and that passion I feel like it
18:57 - can really help them in all of their
18:59 - aspects yeah I love that and when we had
19:02 - first talked about this I was pretty
19:04 - blown away because I had almost the
19:05 - exact same experience when I used to
19:07 - teach middle school computer science
19:08 - where I had one student who I would talk
19:11 - to his other teachers and I was I could
19:13 - not believe that he was acting the way
19:15 - he was acting in these other classes
19:17 - because he would get to coding and just
19:19 - be so focused be working so hard and
19:22 - then wanting me to share with his
19:23 - parents every day like Miss Boston can
19:26 - you text them what I worked on today
19:27 - like I want you to share my progress
19:29 - with them so I mean I completely agree
19:32 - the power of coding I mean having
19:35 - something where students can really feel
19:36 - successful doing this this really tricky
19:40 - discipline
19:41 - at a young age like that's awesome and
19:43 - the behavioral transformation is really
19:45 - powerful I mean aren't you just excited
19:56 - yeah just traditionally aren't doing
19:59 - very well in other subjects then it's
20:00 - it's just an amazing power they have and
20:02 - then you can get them to see how high
20:05 - demand that job is if they want to you
20:07 - know follow that and pursue that degree
20:10 - I mean then you can really get them
20:12 - fired up yeah I agree
20:14 - so thinking about these students that
20:16 - maybe are struggling in other classes
20:18 - what sort of things might you do to try
20:20 - to help them like bring that growth
20:23 - coding mindset from the computer science
20:25 - classroom into their other classes like
20:28 - do you talk to other teachers or talk to
20:29 - the student what might you do yeah well
20:32 - the students themselves I feel like a
20:34 - lot of times and we said this before too
20:36 - because computer science can be so
20:40 - rewarding on an intrinsic level a lot of
20:43 - times they pick it up on their own like
20:45 - I feel like it isn't really something
20:48 - that I particularly try to find a
20:50 - student and say you should you know I I
20:53 - think when I approach it I try to think
20:55 - of every single student in the classroom
20:57 - as being able to be successful and so
20:59 - maybe from that perspective I wouldn't
21:01 - say that I intentionally go to a student
21:04 - but I definitely talk to the entire
21:05 - class and say I don't know what your
21:08 - past or what you guys are like in school
21:10 - but this is different this is not like
21:13 - anything else and you can be successful
21:15 - at this if you want to be and this is an
21:17 - excellent career to get into it you do
21:19 - any kind of research or googling on what
21:21 - we need for computer science people in
21:23 - this country right now you'll see very
21:26 - quickly that it's it's an amazing field
21:28 - to get into so I think I promoted a lot
21:30 - like I said before with the posters with
21:33 - the students I do try to get as many
21:35 - students as excited about it as I can in
21:37 - this district we all do the hour of code
21:40 - yeah yeah
21:42 - on that coding week every year I try to
21:46 - make it a really big deal i order the
21:47 - stickers i order the posters i try to
21:49 - promote it any way i can because we're
21:52 - one to one I've had district
21:54 - my tech director can send the you know
21:57 - the desktop just that goes right to the
22:00 - our code and sometimes even just that
22:02 - even just you know sticking a shortcut
22:05 - on an iPad desktop in our district
22:07 - students don't know what is this and
22:09 - they'll click it you know and then
22:11 - they'll go right into it and I think
22:12 - once they've done the hour of code they
22:15 - kind of start to get that feel like I
22:17 - get what this is I know what this is
22:19 - about and I love it most students really
22:22 - love it even without you pushing too
22:24 - hard
22:25 - yeah that's why going back to the thing
22:27 - with the teachers again I really think
22:28 - the teachers themselves should not be
22:30 - afraid of it I mean go out and try the
22:32 - hour of code it's fun it's exciting it's
22:35 - hard to believe that something like that
22:37 - is is what makes computers run but it is
22:41 - and it's so neat and interesting to see
22:43 - how computer runs versus just using them
22:46 - yeah you know totally yeah right now I
22:48 - codable we're excited to be we're
22:50 - planning for the hour of code and
22:52 - getting ready for it already it's not
22:53 - for a couple months but you can ever
22:55 - start planning too early because I agree
22:57 - it's such a great time and I've had some
22:59 - questions from teachers who have asked
23:00 - like is it too much for the first time
23:02 - we use codable to be for the hour of
23:05 - code is that gonna be too overwhelming
23:07 - like oh no you just jump in there and
23:09 - we've talked a little bit about this too
23:11 - that feeling of when you're trying to
23:13 - build your community of growth mindset
23:15 - in your classroom sometimes just jumping
23:17 - in and trying it is the best way to
23:19 - start so both the teacher and the
23:22 - student really and and that teacher
23:25 - having that attitude where they're
23:26 - showing the student that it's okay to
23:28 - jump in and start it's a great lesson in
23:31 - itself yeah I mean all of that I think
23:34 - everything that surrounds coding that
23:36 - way the ability to to be able to
23:40 - persevere or try again failure is not
23:42 - really failing because you try again
23:44 - until you get it right and that you know
23:47 - jumping into the unknown because it is
23:49 - all unknown it's unknown for everyone
23:51 - really I mean computer science is gonna
23:53 - constantly be changing and evolving in
23:56 - there like I said there is no one person
23:58 - who can be an expert in all of it yeah I
24:00 - agree
24:01 - and you had mentioned that you guys the
24:04 - the district is really interested in
24:06 - coding education and you
24:07 - have one-to-one iPads can you tell us a
24:09 - little bit more about the district that
24:11 - you were teaching in and maybe people
24:13 - who are watching and if they're in a
24:15 - similar situation they'll learn a little
24:17 - bit more about about this district
24:20 - decided to go one-to-one before I taught
24:22 - here actually I was at a district that
24:25 - was a little bit further away from where
24:27 - I live and it was a much larger district
24:30 - and they had not on one-to-one yet and
24:32 - then when this district went one-to-one
24:33 - their computer technology business
24:36 - teacher laughs and my children go here a
24:39 - student so I was super excited to
24:42 - consider this option and I really want
24:44 - it to be in one to one district so Dave
24:47 - yeah we're super excited about making
24:49 - sure that we got into technology as
24:52 - being a tool to improve what we can do
24:56 - in our district like I said we're almost
24:58 - 50 percent free and reduced lunch so
25:00 - students don't necessarily have
25:03 - technology in their hands everywhere
25:05 - they go at home we also don't
25:07 - necessarily have we have we're very
25:09 - rural geographically could you're
25:11 - familiar with the state of Michigan the
25:13 - U P is very distant like we are in
25:16 - Michigan but we're very hard from
25:18 - Detroit and so it's difficult to get
25:21 - internet around here and Wi-Fi and
25:23 - things like that so taking a very
25:25 - proactive approach is what they did to
25:28 - get technology into the hands of every
25:29 - student which is what I wanted to be a
25:31 - part of and I'm super super excited that
25:33 - we do that we do a lot of adaptive
25:35 - learning here which I feel also is an
25:38 - amazing place going in educated like in
25:41 - education I don't know how we could
25:43 - survive without adaptive learning really
25:45 - I mean the fact that we can use
25:47 - technology to adapt to where a student
25:50 - needs to be so they can feel that
25:51 - success that goes back again to that you
25:53 - know feeling of not being a failure it
25:55 - shouldn't feel like failure you need to
25:57 - try something multiple times until you
25:59 - get it that should not be a negative
26:00 - thing that should be I'm gonna be a you
26:03 - know a person who first appears until I
26:04 - get it which is a stronger lesson anyway
26:07 - and so they're very they're very Pro
26:10 - technology very Pro adaptive learning we
26:13 - don't block social media here you might
26:15 - notice and we've said before and since
26:17 - you said you're sharing my contact
26:18 - information that might
26:20 - handles teach Knobloch because I'm a
26:22 - very big promoter of social media I
26:25 - think anybody who is anti social media
26:28 - has not seen it used in the more
26:30 - powerful way it can be used or hasn't
26:33 - been taught to use it correctly so we
26:34 - teach social media instead of blocking
26:37 - it in the hopes that we will create a
26:39 - generation of students who can really
26:41 - harness the power of social media
26:42 - there's a lot of amazing things that can
26:45 - be done with social media when it's used
26:46 - correctly totally yeah so they're very
26:48 - supportive of that too I feel very
26:50 - fortunate to be here where I get a lot
26:52 - of support in technology administration
26:53 - is very supportive and that's awesome
26:57 - what might you say to a teacher who is
27:00 - working at a school that wants to try
27:03 - codable but maybe doesn't have that type
27:05 - of support like potentially there's it's
27:08 - not one-to-one maybe you students who
27:10 - have to be in pairs or threes what would
27:14 - you recommend for them I think person
27:16 - trees but still be exciting I really
27:19 - feel like students just get excited from
27:22 - you know all computer science but
27:24 - codable especially younger students just
27:27 - love everything about it and the
27:29 - students that I have even though they're
27:31 - one-to-one they still want to be next to
27:32 - each other sharing what's happening with
27:34 - each other you know showing each other
27:35 - what they did helping each other so I
27:38 - think it's great no matter what kind of
27:40 - technology you have to be able to
27:42 - introduce it also most you know a lot of
27:45 - people have technology at home too like
27:48 - even if even if a parent had an iPhone
27:51 - or any kind of Bowl and that could put
27:53 - quotable is an app on it students can
27:54 - still use it and I've mentioned this
27:56 - before I've actually had students whose
27:59 - parents texted me at home because they
28:01 - wanted to get into their quota bowl at
28:03 - home because they were either home on
28:05 - Christmas Braden we had a snow day one
28:07 - time I got a text on a snow day or it's
28:11 - just students who just can't get enough
28:12 - of it during the day and their parents
28:14 - are texting me and saying my student is
28:17 - driving me crazy they want to be in
28:18 - their photo book all what do I need to
28:20 - do and so it is it's amazing and no
28:23 - matter what way you could use it I think
28:26 - it's it's going to make students excited
28:28 - and that's computer science in general
28:30 - I think that you know the way we teach
28:33 - it now and the opportunities and the
28:35 - resources we have out there and and
28:38 - almost all of it is free you know
28:41 - there's a lot of really good resources
28:42 - out there that people can start with and
28:45 - and try it and get exposed to it and and
28:49 - it doesn't matter if you're one-to-one
28:50 - or not you think yeah I just have a
28:53 - couple more questions as we're wrapping
28:55 - up if your students take away one thing
28:58 - from their experience with codable what
29:01 - would you hope that that would be
29:03 - perseverance Tim I know I say it over
29:05 - and over again important yeah it is I
29:08 - think when a student understands that
29:12 - the control is in their hands it goes
29:14 - back to the intrinsic thing again that
29:16 - they're not doing school or someone else
29:19 - and that they're not powerless in school
29:22 - like there isn't there isn't someone
29:25 - telling you well you're good at this or
29:26 - you're not good and Dennis or this is
29:28 - where you belong or this is where you
29:30 - fit in I think that that lesson no
29:33 - matter how you get that through to
29:34 - students no matter what subject it's
29:36 - through or whether it's through coaching
29:37 - or sports that you have the control of
29:40 - being able to you know it's this power
29:44 - over your own life and your own self to
29:47 - say I can do this I can I can get angry
29:50 - and quit and say I hate it or I can
29:53 - persevere and say so what if I didn't
29:55 - get it right the first time I'm gonna
29:56 - try and get it until I get it right I
29:58 - think that's a really important but also
30:02 - just the excitement of coding and
30:04 - knowing how a computer works from the
30:06 - inside I think too is great and I think
30:08 - students when they start doing coding
30:10 - whether it's through quotable or any
30:12 - source of computer science they very
30:15 - quickly understand that they're learning
30:16 - not just to use a computer but actually
30:19 - how the computer works and I think a lot
30:21 - of them realized very quickly too that
30:23 - their parents don't really know much
30:25 - about how the computer works so they can
30:26 - come home and say did you know that you
30:29 - know this is how it works like I'm
30:31 - actually controlling like I'm not just
30:33 - playing a game right now I'm controlling
30:34 - this character I'm deciding where this
30:37 - character is going and when you play the
30:39 - game I can write code where I get to
30:42 - control what happen
30:43 - according to what you do I think when
30:44 - students get that you know that's a
30:46 - really exciting thing to that I hope
30:48 - they get out of any computer science
30:50 - yeah that's great I mean I think it also
30:53 - that speaks a lot to like the teacher
30:55 - communicating when the students are
30:57 - using codable communicating what is
30:59 - happening because like you said if
31:01 - they're playing it they're gonna be
31:02 - engaged they're gonna be motivated but
31:04 - they might not truly understand that
31:06 - they are coding this fuzz to move
31:08 - through this maze so the role of the
31:09 - teacher to really help them realize that
31:12 - they are coding they are not just moving
31:14 - of phones around right and I think does
31:17 - a really good job of that because when
31:19 - they get to the fuzz maker you almost
31:21 - can't not understand that you're coding
31:24 - then that's what I mean quotable have
31:25 - some really amazing creators there I
31:28 - don't know who's creating your content
31:29 - but I love how in in like in my mind
31:32 - like I said as a computer science person
31:34 - I can see that they've really found ways
31:38 - to get the kids to get coding in just a
31:41 - different way but things like that I
31:43 - think they start to get the concept of
31:46 - oh wait I'm controlling this according
31:48 - to what I do over here yeah and that is
31:52 - such an incredibly powerful thing to
31:55 - understand it really is and it's it's so
31:57 - great for them to see that I'll pass
31:59 - that along but love it thank you and
32:01 - then what's your one final
32:03 - recommendation if you were to try to
32:05 - boil it down to one recommendation for a
32:08 - new teacher interested in trying codable
32:10 - what would you say to them yeah I would
32:12 - say just jump in
32:14 - like we said dive in there's really
32:16 - nothing stopping you from diving in and
32:18 - trying it I mean even like we said even
32:22 - if you're pairing up like we love tired
32:24 - programming in co.org too we talked
32:27 - about Parrikar programming all the time
32:28 - it's a great thing for students to work
32:30 - together it's great thing for students
32:32 - to solve problems together I really
32:34 - can't think of a reason that you
32:36 - couldn't jump in and try and you know at
32:40 - least discover what's happening in it
32:42 - and if you're afraid of computer science
32:44 - or you're free to coding or you're free
32:46 - that you don't know what's happening
32:47 - when they're gonna jump in you know
32:50 - that's just an attitude in your mind
32:52 - where if your promote
32:54 - growth mindset you're promoting it but
32:56 - you're not thinking yes got a little
32:57 - yeah if you have growth mindset you know
33:01 - that as long as you're willing to try it
33:03 - as long as you're willing to persevere
33:04 - you can't really get it wrong you can't
33:07 - do it wrong there is no wrong way to
33:09 - teach a student how to get interested in
33:12 - any subject let alone coding and and
33:14 - like I said there's so many resources
33:16 - out there right now we have such a
33:17 - ginormous shortage of coders coming out
33:20 - that we we have a lot of resources that
33:23 - are out there available for us to use
33:25 - Jacqueline thank you so much for joining
33:27 - me it was it's always lovely to talk to
33:30 - you I want to say to everybody else
33:33 - watching if you're interested in
33:34 - learning more about what we've talked
33:35 - about in this video or have any
33:37 - questions um you can reach out to me my
33:39 - email is Hannah at codable comm and I
33:41 - will include Jacqueline's contact
33:43 - information Twitter and email as well
33:46 - and then don't forget to Like and
33:49 - subscribe to our codable Channel
33:50 - Jacqueline thank you so much for joining
33:52 - me it was so nice to talk to you that's
34:01 - so great thank you so much we'll talk
34:02 - again soon

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome to codable showandtell my name is Hana basta and I'm the instructional coach here at codable the Show and Tell webinar series is a time for me to sit down with a teacher or a curriculum designer somebody using codable in their classroom and maybe they're using it in an interesting or different way or they're grappling with a common problem that other teachers might be facing as well and the goal of these talks is really for those of you who are watching to learn something new maybe it raises a question for you something you want to get answered but really just to get inspired by the awesome teachers who are using go to pool in their classrooms so today I am joined by Jaclyn laberge liger a Jacqueline thanks so much for joining us yeah Jaclyn is a rock star teacher using codable but I also just want to say that what she's doing in her classroom you're gonna hear all about it but it is something that those of you watching can definitely do in your classroom as well we have designed codable to be really accessible and Jacqueline's gonna tell you how she's using it and give you some tips and tricks so whatever she's talking about definitely feel free to give it a try and I'll have both of our contact information in the description box of this video so you can reach out to us if you have any questions but I'm gonna jump in to jacqueline asking you some questions and then this will just flow like a regular conversation so I'd love for you to first tell us a little bit about the school that you are teaching at kind of what your role is at that school tell us a little bit about the students and what you do okay so I teach at no Republican area schools which is a smaller school in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan I actually teach in every building I was hired to teach in high school I've traditionally been a high school teacher but when I first came here they went onetoone the year that I came here every student in the entire district all the way down to early kindergarten has iPads I started as a high school teacher and helping with the technology distribution in the one to one and as I was here a year or two we started to want more and more technology classes so right now I'm actually teaching tech to every elementary student as a special and then I also teach to tech classes in the middle school and then I teach three different hours in the high school but they involve a lot of different tech classes like sometimes I'm teaching a couple of different tech classes at the same time so we have a lot of technology available here at this school yeah and we're a smaller school you know we have about almost 50% free and reduced lunch we did apply for the codable for every one award this year and we've won it and we're super excited about that could you tell people really quick just what a quick snippet of what that was about yeah so portable does offer quotable for everyone is a little mini award grant kind of application that you can make with Cobalt if you need certain standards like our school did and you show all the amazing things you're doing with codable you can win a year's grant of the entire quotable program which is a very wonderful amazing program that we're very fortunate to have right now and that's what happened with us and now we have quotable in our entire district and I use it from ek all the way up to fifth grade and then sometimes my sixth graders to actually they really love it even or 68 does a little bit incredible to cool I use the entire curriculum in my elementary school what is that like to be teaching so many different grades because I know a lot of teachers that are watching this or ever eat out to me are teaching K through five what is that like for you what's challenging about it it's challenging because yes I am all over the place I'm in every building so I'm running a lot and obviously like from a record standpoint when I log into my power school which is where we keep all of our records I have a lot of classes but I love it because I feel like it's very well for one thing I get to I get to know everybody in the elementary school they're very excited about technology I'm superexcited that they're learning coding already because I also teach AP Computer Science in the high school and obviously coding is really important to me I'm a computer science minor so this way I know that all of our students that are coming up are getting some really amazing coding experience before they even get up to the middle school or the high school and then so from that standpoint I love it because I get to meet everybody gets to know everybody and I get to control the curriculum that's happening or have a you know saying all the curriculum it's happening all the way up until they come up into high school with me so well and so you just mentioned that you studied computer science and I talked to a lot of teachers who do not have any background in computer science so I'm curious if you could say a little bit to that what is it like teaching young children coding when you yourself have a computer science background yes so computer science it's a pretty rare degree to have an education because don't choose to go into the education field but that's why I work with code I'm also a facilitator for code.org which is an amazing program as well and that's the curriculum we use in our middle spooner high school to teach computer science and we try to teach teachers no matter what degree they have it doesn't matter that they can still teach coding even if they've not don't have computer science to be themselves from a standpoint of having a computer science degree I think it's awesome and amazing that I can go in and see all those elementary students learning some of the really crazy like functions and loops and ifthen decision structures even when they're as young as kindergarten yeah some of the kids are learning some of those concepts in such an amazing way I think I've said this before portable has an incredible way of making it all game oriented fun but really teaching perseverance and still getting in these concepts that you wouldn't think a kindergartner would be able to understand but yet with the moving of the maze and the way it's been taught it really does an amazing job of teaching so from a pure science standpoint I look at it and I think oh my god these kids are like doing functions but that doesn't mean either this coding program teaching coding is amazing no matter what I mean when I took a computer science degree obviously keep your science was in a much different language everything was different so it isn't like I feel like it's given me some sort of amazing advantage to teach it I feel like anybody could teach it I do feel very excited for the future though of these students because they're seeing some concepts and I believe sometimes by the time students get to high school understanding a function or understanding an if/then or a loop sometimes the perseverance isn't there or the logic just isn't there and they don't they feel like it's too late to learn it not that it's ever too late but I do love that these students will grow up with functions and events and loops and then they'll just be like yeah well so much of it is just that exposure at a young age that when they see it in you know JavaScript syntax later they're not afraid of it they know the basics what sorts of recommendations do you make to teachers who don't have that computer science background what kind of resources would you recommend for them or what would you say is just teaching that it's okay to be learning along with students I actually think that's such an amazing thing in any subject no matter what subject you're in no matter what you're teaching no matter what you do in education I think that when you build a community in your classroom a foundation where they know it's safe they know we're all learning together I think that if you're gonna do computer science and you don't have computer science degree you just need to let go and enjoy it and have fun learning it along with them because it is an incredible thing to learn and it is really good for many different things like I said including perseverance which is my favorite things that that students need to learn before they get out because we can Google everything you can persevere in anything if you have perseverance so I think from a teacher standpoint it's just a mindset it's a mindset of saying we're in this together you know I'm here to coach you it's okay if you found or discovered something that I haven't yet discovered I'm not here to make you think that I'm some authority on everything it's impossible to be an authority on everything in technology no matter who you are or what you're teaching or where you are that's an impossible feat so I think as a technology teacher who has been teaching technology for a while I know there was a point in my teaching career where I had to say you know what we are all in this together I'm not telling you we're all discovering together and any teacher with that mindset could be teaching really any level of code it could be in the elementary it could be in the middle school could be in the high school it could be at the college level as long as you're in it in that method that hey we're all discovering this together and we're all gonna succeed together so I'd say that's my number one thing is just that attitude that teachers need to have ya know that's so important because I also feel like if you're a new teacher and you're teaching coding which you don't know anything about maybe you're afraid just to admit that you don't have the answer but like you said building that class community where it's okay to take a risk and if you're wrong then you're learning it alongside your students which is great can you think of a time when you got stumped in class as a teacher or like when you didn't know the answer well I think from a computer stand computer science standpoint in the high school especially any time students are debugging a program and again this goes back to teaching technology for a long time if you've been teaching computer science computer programming at all quoting at all for a long time you know that there's times that students will have a bug in their program that you can't just walk up and look at it and instantly say oh this is what's wrong so I think from from like a debugging standpoint it happens all the computer science teachers you know you have to walk in there and go I can't pretend like I'm gonna know your answer immediately I mean obviously you've been working on this program for a long time here's all these lines of code you know there's a lot of things to do so I think that that happens all the time with debugging mmm I think that I'm very open to when a student is excited about something they've discovered even if it's something I do already know making it seem like they've discovered something maybe that we haven't had before because that's really rewarding to them you know for them to go out and go did you see that this is like it was excited because I just own this or I just learned this or I taught or something and actually codable because it's constantly changing codable does such an amazing job of keeping their curriculum uptodate and keeping the kids on their toes and introducing new things to them a lot of times students will find something in codable that we've not yet discovered as a class and especially the students who run with it and they'll come up and they'll go hey this is like or did you see this yet or you know look what I did and look what level I met in codable and I loved it I didn't see that yet and that's really amazing that you can do that where there's always in computer science you know five different ways to do the same thing or they'll come up and say you know I I did it this way it's different than what everybody else did and you're just like that close me away and that's awesome mmm and once you have that established that in your classroom I think it's good for students but it's also good for you it takes off this you know pressure that you have to feel like you're you know some sort of authority that has to have the answer to everything and that's impossible and it's not good for the students teacher I mean it's good for them to see you as a human being yeah it's too exhausting to have all the answers all the time that would not be very fun I'm so speaking to like that level of excitement that you're talking about in your classroom I always equate that a lot with motivation and like when the students are excited to learn more they're super motivated to keep going what have you done in your own classroom with codable to try to like spark that motivation and excitement or maybe it's a lesson that you built about coding to get kids motivated but how do you foster motivation one thing about coding in general is that I I do promote coding in every level of our building in every way I can you might even notice actually yeah boosters I have everywhere and I don't just put them in my classroom I put him out in the hallways and um you know I try to I do try to talk to students onetoone and group them with a group of students I'll try to talk to them about why coding is such a great thing right now and why would be a great thing for them to take interest in it in the elementary school honestly I don't feel like I've had to do a ton of motivation they are motivated and if I I feel like if I weren't introducing these things to them they would be finding them anyway I mean I think they go out and they find them and they get excited and then just being excited about what coding is about excites them too but you know we start in the beginning of the year well we start with a couple things we start with a video on growth mindset because I feel like and you know going back to the teacher to who thinks they can't teach computer science if you learn or study or even just google anything about growth mindset and just start believing in growth mindset or following it on Twitter where there's so many people who believe in growth mindset I think that establishing that is great because students get excited that they can try something that they know that if they don't get it right the first time it's not a wrong answer you're not gonna fail or we say you know like we watch this Khan Academy video the first day that you can learn anything failure is just another word for growing teaching that mentality gets them excited already yeah and then when they think you know what they go into codable and they think they're playing a game they are just instantly like this is so much fun I get to do this and then the fun part about it and and this is what I really love is I think that when they start and taking it's a game you know most kids will get bored with a game I think over time because there isn't much depth to the game or they'll go master it or whatever I think that when students actually discover that they're doing the coding part when they start to oh my god I really have to think in this game like I'm really thinking through this it actually gets them more excited because they're so excited to for those challenges to beat those challenges to get somewhere to accomplish something and then when they equate it to school and they're like this is like school like this is how it should feel it becomes very motivating on their own and you know I'm very into intrinsic motivation I think even in the high school too often students especially for some reason students who come from middle school always believe for some reason along the way that they're doing things in school for their teachers and teaching them that is not for their teachers it's for them you know you're doing this for your life to be better that intrinsic motivation all the way down to the elementary Accord well does such a great job of giving them that because they do they get through those challenges and it isn't just a game anymore yeah and they get it and then I think they come out and they really want more coding they want more technology too but they start to understand the difference between coding and technology which a lot of people in our country probably don't even understand the difference and they understand it and they want more of it I really want to understand this coding piece yeah and just like you were saying just to feel successful at school and we've talked a little bit about this and I'm sure you I'd love for you to share it with the viewers but like having some students that maybe aren't succeeding in other parts of school recognize that they are coding they are doing computer science and they are successful can you talk a little bit about that with what you've noticed the impact of coding on uncodable on yours to some of your students yes we talked about this once before because I said sometimes when I come into an elementary classroom especially you know there's a student that obviously either isn't that interested in his classroom work or you know whatever is happening in the classroom for some reason he's sitting right by the teacher's desk where she's sitting right by a teacher's desk where they're off to the side because they are you know maybe trouble focusing or whatever and a lot of times when they see they have control over something like that and they're able to you know succeed and like you said feel that success that intrinsic motivation and they realize I'm excited when they get through a level oftentimes those students really do better in coding then they may be traditionally are doing in some of the other subjects because they know they have control over it they know they have that ability to do what they want to do and move on and move forward especially in like codable is a good example of a program where you know if they're into it and they start moving they can move at their own rate and they can see hey I'm getting through this quickly and and I love it and I had one student in the ek this year who literally when I would walk in the door he would be waiting for me to open another level please tell me you've opened more levels I need more levels like that's how some students get and it's really rewarding and exciting because you know sometimes students who struggle with attention and who struggle in other subjects then sometimes also have behavior issues and I know I tend to be very optimistic in this way but I feel like when they have something that they're passionate about and when they have something that they know that they're good at it's gonna carry over into everything it's gonna carry over into those other subjects and it's gonna carry over into the classroom and they're gonna be like I have a purpose now when you give them that purpose and that passion I feel like it can really help them in all of their aspects yeah I love that and when we had first talked about this I was pretty blown away because I had almost the exact same experience when I used to teach middle school computer science where I had one student who I would talk to his other teachers and I was I could not believe that he was acting the way he was acting in these other classes because he would get to coding and just be so focused be working so hard and then wanting me to share with his parents every day like Miss Boston can you text them what I worked on today like I want you to share my progress with them so I mean I completely agree the power of coding I mean having something where students can really feel successful doing this this really tricky discipline at a young age like that's awesome and the behavioral transformation is really powerful I mean aren't you just excited yeah just traditionally aren't doing very well in other subjects then it's it's just an amazing power they have and then you can get them to see how high demand that job is if they want to you know follow that and pursue that degree I mean then you can really get them fired up yeah I agree so thinking about these students that maybe are struggling in other classes what sort of things might you do to try to help them like bring that growth coding mindset from the computer science classroom into their other classes like do you talk to other teachers or talk to the student what might you do yeah well the students themselves I feel like a lot of times and we said this before too because computer science can be so rewarding on an intrinsic level a lot of times they pick it up on their own like I feel like it isn't really something that I particularly try to find a student and say you should you know I I think when I approach it I try to think of every single student in the classroom as being able to be successful and so maybe from that perspective I wouldn't say that I intentionally go to a student but I definitely talk to the entire class and say I don't know what your past or what you guys are like in school but this is different this is not like anything else and you can be successful at this if you want to be and this is an excellent career to get into it you do any kind of research or googling on what we need for computer science people in this country right now you'll see very quickly that it's it's an amazing field to get into so I think I promoted a lot like I said before with the posters with the students I do try to get as many students as excited about it as I can in this district we all do the hour of code yeah yeah on that coding week every year I try to make it a really big deal i order the stickers i order the posters i try to promote it any way i can because we're one to one I've had district my tech director can send the you know the desktop just that goes right to the our code and sometimes even just that even just you know sticking a shortcut on an iPad desktop in our district students don't know what is this and they'll click it you know and then they'll go right into it and I think once they've done the hour of code they kind of start to get that feel like I get what this is I know what this is about and I love it most students really love it even without you pushing too hard yeah that's why going back to the thing with the teachers again I really think the teachers themselves should not be afraid of it I mean go out and try the hour of code it's fun it's exciting it's hard to believe that something like that is is what makes computers run but it is and it's so neat and interesting to see how computer runs versus just using them yeah you know totally yeah right now I codable we're excited to be we're planning for the hour of code and getting ready for it already it's not for a couple months but you can ever start planning too early because I agree it's such a great time and I've had some questions from teachers who have asked like is it too much for the first time we use codable to be for the hour of code is that gonna be too overwhelming like oh no you just jump in there and we've talked a little bit about this too that feeling of when you're trying to build your community of growth mindset in your classroom sometimes just jumping in and trying it is the best way to start so both the teacher and the student really and and that teacher having that attitude where they're showing the student that it's okay to jump in and start it's a great lesson in itself yeah I mean all of that I think everything that surrounds coding that way the ability to to be able to persevere or try again failure is not really failing because you try again until you get it right and that you know jumping into the unknown because it is all unknown it's unknown for everyone really I mean computer science is gonna constantly be changing and evolving in there like I said there is no one person who can be an expert in all of it yeah I agree and you had mentioned that you guys the the district is really interested in coding education and you have onetoone iPads can you tell us a little bit more about the district that you were teaching in and maybe people who are watching and if they're in a similar situation they'll learn a little bit more about about this district decided to go onetoone before I taught here actually I was at a district that was a little bit further away from where I live and it was a much larger district and they had not on onetoone yet and then when this district went onetoone their computer technology business teacher laughs and my children go here a student so I was super excited to consider this option and I really want it to be in one to one district so Dave yeah we're super excited about making sure that we got into technology as being a tool to improve what we can do in our district like I said we're almost 50 percent free and reduced lunch so students don't necessarily have technology in their hands everywhere they go at home we also don't necessarily have we have we're very rural geographically could you're familiar with the state of Michigan the U P is very distant like we are in Michigan but we're very hard from Detroit and so it's difficult to get internet around here and WiFi and things like that so taking a very proactive approach is what they did to get technology into the hands of every student which is what I wanted to be a part of and I'm super super excited that we do that we do a lot of adaptive learning here which I feel also is an amazing place going in educated like in education I don't know how we could survive without adaptive learning really I mean the fact that we can use technology to adapt to where a student needs to be so they can feel that success that goes back again to that you know feeling of not being a failure it shouldn't feel like failure you need to try something multiple times until you get it that should not be a negative thing that should be I'm gonna be a you know a person who first appears until I get it which is a stronger lesson anyway and so they're very they're very Pro technology very Pro adaptive learning we don't block social media here you might notice and we've said before and since you said you're sharing my contact information that might handles teach Knobloch because I'm a very big promoter of social media I think anybody who is anti social media has not seen it used in the more powerful way it can be used or hasn't been taught to use it correctly so we teach social media instead of blocking it in the hopes that we will create a generation of students who can really harness the power of social media there's a lot of amazing things that can be done with social media when it's used correctly totally yeah so they're very supportive of that too I feel very fortunate to be here where I get a lot of support in technology administration is very supportive and that's awesome what might you say to a teacher who is working at a school that wants to try codable but maybe doesn't have that type of support like potentially there's it's not onetoone maybe you students who have to be in pairs or threes what would you recommend for them I think person trees but still be exciting I really feel like students just get excited from you know all computer science but codable especially younger students just love everything about it and the students that I have even though they're onetoone they still want to be next to each other sharing what's happening with each other you know showing each other what they did helping each other so I think it's great no matter what kind of technology you have to be able to introduce it also most you know a lot of people have technology at home too like even if even if a parent had an iPhone or any kind of Bowl and that could put quotable is an app on it students can still use it and I've mentioned this before I've actually had students whose parents texted me at home because they wanted to get into their quota bowl at home because they were either home on Christmas Braden we had a snow day one time I got a text on a snow day or it's just students who just can't get enough of it during the day and their parents are texting me and saying my student is driving me crazy they want to be in their photo book all what do I need to do and so it is it's amazing and no matter what way you could use it I think it's it's going to make students excited and that's computer science in general I think that you know the way we teach it now and the opportunities and the resources we have out there and and almost all of it is free you know there's a lot of really good resources out there that people can start with and and try it and get exposed to it and and it doesn't matter if you're onetoone or not you think yeah I just have a couple more questions as we're wrapping up if your students take away one thing from their experience with codable what would you hope that that would be perseverance Tim I know I say it over and over again important yeah it is I think when a student understands that the control is in their hands it goes back to the intrinsic thing again that they're not doing school or someone else and that they're not powerless in school like there isn't there isn't someone telling you well you're good at this or you're not good and Dennis or this is where you belong or this is where you fit in I think that that lesson no matter how you get that through to students no matter what subject it's through or whether it's through coaching or sports that you have the control of being able to you know it's this power over your own life and your own self to say I can do this I can I can get angry and quit and say I hate it or I can persevere and say so what if I didn't get it right the first time I'm gonna try and get it until I get it right I think that's a really important but also just the excitement of coding and knowing how a computer works from the inside I think too is great and I think students when they start doing coding whether it's through quotable or any source of computer science they very quickly understand that they're learning not just to use a computer but actually how the computer works and I think a lot of them realized very quickly too that their parents don't really know much about how the computer works so they can come home and say did you know that you know this is how it works like I'm actually controlling like I'm not just playing a game right now I'm controlling this character I'm deciding where this character is going and when you play the game I can write code where I get to control what happen according to what you do I think when students get that you know that's a really exciting thing to that I hope they get out of any computer science yeah that's great I mean I think it also that speaks a lot to like the teacher communicating when the students are using codable communicating what is happening because like you said if they're playing it they're gonna be engaged they're gonna be motivated but they might not truly understand that they are coding this fuzz to move through this maze so the role of the teacher to really help them realize that they are coding they are not just moving of phones around right and I think does a really good job of that because when they get to the fuzz maker you almost can't not understand that you're coding then that's what I mean quotable have some really amazing creators there I don't know who's creating your content but I love how in in like in my mind like I said as a computer science person I can see that they've really found ways to get the kids to get coding in just a different way but things like that I think they start to get the concept of oh wait I'm controlling this according to what I do over here yeah and that is such an incredibly powerful thing to understand it really is and it's it's so great for them to see that I'll pass that along but love it thank you and then what's your one final recommendation if you were to try to boil it down to one recommendation for a new teacher interested in trying codable what would you say to them yeah I would say just jump in like we said dive in there's really nothing stopping you from diving in and trying it I mean even like we said even if you're pairing up like we love tired programming in co.org too we talked about Parrikar programming all the time it's a great thing for students to work together it's great thing for students to solve problems together I really can't think of a reason that you couldn't jump in and try and you know at least discover what's happening in it and if you're afraid of computer science or you're free to coding or you're free that you don't know what's happening when they're gonna jump in you know that's just an attitude in your mind where if your promote growth mindset you're promoting it but you're not thinking yes got a little yeah if you have growth mindset you know that as long as you're willing to try it as long as you're willing to persevere you can't really get it wrong you can't do it wrong there is no wrong way to teach a student how to get interested in any subject let alone coding and and like I said there's so many resources out there right now we have such a ginormous shortage of coders coming out that we we have a lot of resources that are out there available for us to use Jacqueline thank you so much for joining me it was it's always lovely to talk to you I want to say to everybody else watching if you're interested in learning more about what we've talked about in this video or have any questions um you can reach out to me my email is Hannah at codable comm and I will include Jacqueline's contact information Twitter and email as well and then don't forget to Like and subscribe to our codable Channel Jacqueline thank you so much for joining me it was so nice to talk to you that's so great thank you so much we'll talk again soon
