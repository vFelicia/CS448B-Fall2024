00:00 - [Music]
00:00 - welcome to the fuzz family's pi day
00:02 - potluck
00:03 - all the fuzzies were supposed to bring a
00:05 - different kind of pie to share
00:07 - ruby has cherry spike brought pumpkin
00:10 - simon has apple violet brought pecan
00:14 - and wait a minute one of these pies
00:17 - is not like the others blue fuzz brought
00:20 - this mysterious symbol to the party
00:23 - does this look like pie to you
00:27 - well it might look different but the
00:28 - symbol is actually also called
00:31 - pi it's spelled differently there's no e
00:34 - at the end but it does sound the same
00:37 - the thing is you can't eat this pie it's
00:40 - a symbol
00:41 - that represents a very special number
00:44 - that is helpful for solving
00:45 - math mysteries about circles
00:49 - so let's talk circles for a sec because
00:51 - there are two important distances that
00:53 - will help us
00:54 - understand what this weird pie that you
00:56 - can't eat
00:57 - is all about the first is the distance
01:00 - from one point
01:02 - all the way around the circle the fancy
01:05 - math word for this
01:06 - is called circumference the second
01:09 - is the distance from one point across
01:11 - the circle
01:13 - the word for this is diameter
01:16 - pi is just the relationship or ratio
01:19 - between the two distances
01:21 - no matter what circle you look at the
01:24 - circumference
01:24 - is always a little more than 3 times the
01:27 - diameter
01:29 - but instead of saying a little more than
01:31 - 3 or
01:32 - 3.14 it's easier for us to use this
01:35 - greek
01:36 - symbol hi so why does pie matter
01:40 - well like i said before pi is helpful
01:43 - for solving math mysteries
01:45 - this is because if you know just one of
01:47 - these two distances
01:49 - you can use pi to figure out the other
01:51 - one
01:52 - here's an example last week the fuzz
01:55 - family decided they wanted to know the
01:57 - width of the planet smiborg
02:00 - the width or diameter is the distance
02:03 - from one point on the planet
02:05 - straight across to the other side but
02:08 - here's the thing
02:09 - planet smeaborg is not a flat circle
02:12 - it's a sphere like a ball and there's no
02:16 - way the fuzzes could measure
02:17 - a straight line through it they would
02:20 - have had to bury through the center of
02:21 - the planet
02:22 - and not even cole fuzz could dig that
02:24 - far
02:25 - then violet remembered something and
02:27 - told the rest of the fuzzies
02:29 - we can use pie to solve this mystery we
02:32 - just need to know the distance around
02:34 - the planet
02:36 - she flew all the way around the planet
02:38 - smiborg in her spaceship
02:39 - and measured the circumference then she
02:42 - used her knowledge of pie
02:44 - and solved the mystery of the smeborg
02:46 - diameter
02:49 - pie is very important to the fuzz family
02:51 - not only because it helps them solve
02:53 - mysteries like this around the universe
02:55 - but also because their bodies are
02:57 - spheres
02:58 - it's a cool thing that every single fuzz
03:00 - has in common
03:02 - fuzzes love to roll and bounce and spin
03:04 - to celebrate their circular shape
03:08 - and it's not just the fuzzes math lovers
03:10 - all over the universe have a holiday on
03:13 - march 14th
03:14 - to appreciate pie shapes and math in
03:17 - general
03:18 - your coding mission is to create a
03:21 - codable maze that includes a shape you
03:23 - see
03:23 - at the pi day potluck step one is to
03:27 - choose a shape
03:28 - take a look at the picture of the pi day
03:30 - party what shapes do you notice
03:34 - here are some examples i like the
03:36 - triangle shape of simon's party hat
03:39 - so i'll pick that step 2 log in to
03:42 - codable
03:43 - if you've already unlocked the maze
03:44 - maker you can go straight there
03:46 - but if you're brand new to codable make
03:48 - sure you start on planet smeeborg
03:51 - players need to complete at least four
03:53 - levels to learn about sequence and
03:54 - unlock the maze maker
03:57 - step three is to click the build button
03:59 - and open a new maze
04:00 - draw the shape you chose we need to
04:03 - connect the shape to each side of the
04:05 - maze maker
04:06 - then get creative this is a celebration
04:09 - so don't be afraid to add lots of
04:10 - decorations
04:12 - finally it's time to place the stars in
04:13 - the maze and test to make sure it's
04:15 - solvable
04:16 - in this example i actually just need my
04:19 - fuzz to roll straight
04:20 - so my code is only one command
04:23 - don't forget in programming and in math
04:26 - we test we make fixes we test and try
04:29 - again
04:30 - so don't give up if your maze doesn't
04:32 - work on the first try
04:34 - you're up next
04:38 - happy pi day

welcome to the fuzz family's pi day potluck all the fuzzies were supposed to bring a different kind of pie to share ruby has cherry spike brought pumpkin simon has apple violet brought pecan and wait a minute one of these pies is not like the others blue fuzz brought this mysterious symbol to the party does this look like pie to you well it might look different but the symbol is actually also called pi it's spelled differently there's no e at the end but it does sound the same the thing is you can't eat this pie it's a symbol that represents a very special number that is helpful for solving math mysteries about circles so let's talk circles for a sec because there are two important distances that will help us understand what this weird pie that you can't eat is all about the first is the distance from one point all the way around the circle the fancy math word for this is called circumference the second is the distance from one point across the circle the word for this is diameter pi is just the relationship or ratio between the two distances no matter what circle you look at the circumference is always a little more than 3 times the diameter but instead of saying a little more than 3 or 3.14 it's easier for us to use this greek symbol hi so why does pie matter well like i said before pi is helpful for solving math mysteries this is because if you know just one of these two distances you can use pi to figure out the other one here's an example last week the fuzz family decided they wanted to know the width of the planet smiborg the width or diameter is the distance from one point on the planet straight across to the other side but here's the thing planet smeaborg is not a flat circle it's a sphere like a ball and there's no way the fuzzes could measure a straight line through it they would have had to bury through the center of the planet and not even cole fuzz could dig that far then violet remembered something and told the rest of the fuzzies we can use pie to solve this mystery we just need to know the distance around the planet she flew all the way around the planet smiborg in her spaceship and measured the circumference then she used her knowledge of pie and solved the mystery of the smeborg diameter pie is very important to the fuzz family not only because it helps them solve mysteries like this around the universe but also because their bodies are spheres it's a cool thing that every single fuzz has in common fuzzes love to roll and bounce and spin to celebrate their circular shape and it's not just the fuzzes math lovers all over the universe have a holiday on march 14th to appreciate pie shapes and math in general your coding mission is to create a codable maze that includes a shape you see at the pi day potluck step one is to choose a shape take a look at the picture of the pi day party what shapes do you notice here are some examples i like the triangle shape of simon's party hat so i'll pick that step 2 log in to codable if you've already unlocked the maze maker you can go straight there but if you're brand new to codable make sure you start on planet smeeborg players need to complete at least four levels to learn about sequence and unlock the maze maker step three is to click the build button and open a new maze draw the shape you chose we need to connect the shape to each side of the maze maker then get creative this is a celebration so don't be afraid to add lots of decorations finally it's time to place the stars in the maze and test to make sure it's solvable in this example i actually just need my fuzz to roll straight so my code is only one command don't forget in programming and in math we test we make fixes we test and try again so don't give up if your maze doesn't work on the first try you're up next happy pi day
