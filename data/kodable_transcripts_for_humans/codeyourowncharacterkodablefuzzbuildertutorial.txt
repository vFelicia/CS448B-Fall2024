00:00 - welcome to codable today we are going to
00:02 - walk through how to build your own fuzz
00:04 - character to start let's go to fuzz
00:07 - Builder
00:08 - we can either create a new character or
00:10 - edit a fuzz that we've previously built
00:12 - let's create a new fuzz together
00:15 - first let's give our fuzz a name
00:18 - [Music]
00:23 - next we'll use a function to code our
00:25 - fuzz's body eyes and mouth features
00:31 - [Music]
00:35 - these features will be stored as
00:36 - properties in our code that means every
00:39 - time we play with our fuzz character
00:40 - they will always have the same design
00:52 - together
00:58 - we have a ton of options available so
01:01 - don't be afraid to get creative
01:03 - [Music]
01:13 - great job
01:15 - now that we've got our fuzz let's get
01:18 - them dressed up with some fun
01:19 - decorations
01:21 - [Music]
01:56 - finally let's save our fuzz so you can
02:00 - select which fuzz you want to play with
02:01 - as you explore the rest of fuzztopia
02:05 - happy coding
