00:01 - let's go
00:05 - has this ever happened to you you're
00:07 - meeting somebody new
00:08 - they introduce themselves and then five
00:10 - seconds later you can't remember their
00:11 - name
00:13 - wouldn't it be great if the brain had
00:14 - some sort of storage system to avoid
00:16 - this
00:18 - like what if every time someone new
00:20 - tells you their name
00:22 - your brain writes it down on a piece of
00:23 - paper puts it in a box
00:26 - labels the box and stores it away
00:28 - [Music]
00:29 - then if you ever need the name you can
00:31 - just use the label to retrieve the box
00:33 - open it up and voila you have the name
00:36 - and now you can use it
00:38 - if you programmed a computer like a
00:40 - robot to remember people's names it
00:43 - would do
00:43 - something like this the brain box i
00:46 - mentioned
00:47 - acts just like a variable in programming
00:50 - a variable
00:51 - is like a container that stores a value
00:54 - the value in this example is a string of
00:56 - letters that together
00:58 - help you identify someone in coding a
01:01 - name is what we call
01:02 - a string no it's not like the one on
01:05 - your shoe
01:06 - this is a type of value stored in a
01:08 - variable that is made up of characters
01:10 - words phrases or symbols just like all
01:14 - variables have values that can change
01:16 - or vary a person's name can change too
01:20 - do you have any nicknames maybe your
01:22 - family or friends
01:23 - all call you something different no
01:25 - matter what someone calls you
01:27 - you still have a name the value of your
01:29 - name can change
01:30 - but it won't change anything else about
01:32 - you a lot of
01:33 - games keep track of players names here
01:36 - take a look at fuzztopia
01:38 - there is your name right there as a
01:39 - string games can also track
01:42 - other pieces of information that might
01:43 - change or vary as you play
01:46 - like the background the characters and
01:48 - colors
01:49 - all of these variables represent string
01:52 - values
01:54 - the fuzz family is learning all about
01:56 - strings too just like you are right now
01:58 - the fuzz family loves to explore the
02:00 - universe
02:01 - but sometimes they run into this huge
02:04 - asteroid field
02:05 - they can see asteroids of all different
02:07 - colors like green
02:09 - red and yellow how will they get through
02:13 - the fuzzies know that in code each color
02:16 - that you see
02:17 - is actually written out as a string of
02:19 - text
02:20 - and they can use these strings to clear
02:22 - the asteroid field
02:24 - you can help the fuzzes too start by
02:27 - looking at the values or
02:28 - colors of the asteroids i see purple
02:32 - then choose a matching colored fuzzball
02:36 - this means one with the same string
02:38 - value purple
02:40 - tap the fuzzball to load the blaster and
02:42 - then tap to aim at an asteroid of the
02:45 - same color
02:46 - if the fuzzball string meets with an
02:48 - asteroid of equal value
02:50 - they will both clear and the fuzzes can
02:52 - pass through
02:54 - now that you've seen variables in
02:56 - asteroidia what do you think
02:58 - why are strings so important in game
03:01 - design
03:02 - take a moment to reflect or discuss
03:04 - [Music]
03:07 - when you use variables to store string
03:09 - values in a program you are often
03:11 - controlling the output
03:12 - or what the user sees for instance let's
03:15 - say one of our programmers at codable
03:17 - wanted to change what blue fuzz's eyes
03:20 - look like
03:21 - a programmer could go into the code find
03:24 - the eyes
03:25 - variable for blue fuzz and edit the
03:28 - value
03:28 - from blue to alien
03:32 - this would instantly change the
03:33 - appearance of blue fuzz's eyes
03:36 - and what all players including you would
03:38 - see encodable
03:40 - when you design your own game you will
03:42 - be able to control things like this
03:46 - strings are so powerful
03:49 - what will you code next
