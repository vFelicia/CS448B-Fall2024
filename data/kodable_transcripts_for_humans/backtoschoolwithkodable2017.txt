00:00 - hey everyone this is Gretchen with
00:03 - codable I'm here with Bree gray our
00:06 - curriculum director and we are so
00:08 - excited for the new school year
00:11 - uh we are thrilled to have you all here
00:13 - and we are excited to walk you through
00:17 - some of the changes that we've made to
00:19 - codable over the past year but also to
00:21 - just if you're new to codable walk you
00:23 - through your dashboard uh get you all
00:25 - set up and make sure that you're good to
00:26 - go for the new year so
00:28 - um with that I'm gonna let Brie Take the
00:31 - Lead yeah
00:32 - um
00:33 - so we're gonna start um we're gonna Dive
00:36 - Right In and talk about adding your
00:38 - first class and setting your class up
00:41 - um and then we'll do a dashboard tour uh
00:44 - we can show you some of our new features
00:45 - we're really excited today we announced
00:47 - our lesson Library
00:49 - um so we have some exciting new lessons
00:51 - stuff to talk about and then we'll talk
00:54 - about game updates and share some
00:56 - resources with you so we'll Dive Right
00:58 - In Here to setting up our first class
01:03 - okay so we are on the top we're going to
01:05 - start again and talk about adding a
01:08 - glass
01:09 - um so we will add our class and
01:12 - again we're going to name this webinar
01:15 - so
01:17 - here is where you will decide the pacing
01:19 - that your students will be on you can
01:21 - change this later but this is how you'll
01:24 - manage the content that your students
01:25 - have access to so if you want everything
01:28 - to be open for your students you would
01:30 - do a K through five option if you have a
01:33 - Kindergarten class and you want them on
01:34 - our kindergarten pacing that would be
01:37 - this option so whatever grade level you
01:39 - choose will be the only content that
01:41 - they have access to and we'll talk more
01:43 - about how you can manage what they have
01:46 - access to within that grade level but
01:48 - the only only the grade level you choose
01:51 - will be what you have access to
01:54 - if you want to import students in bulk
01:56 - you can do that here and if you have
01:58 - Google classrooms you can do that by
02:00 - clicking here
02:01 - so let's continue we're going to add
02:03 - myself and Gretchen as students to this
02:07 - class
02:09 - so here you'll see that we've generated
02:10 - some options for class codes
02:13 - um if you have younger students you'll
02:15 - notice these would not be easy to
02:16 - remember so we actually have a tip of
02:18 - the week video that Gretchen will be
02:20 - sharing
02:22 - um just on creating an easy to remember
02:24 - class code and going over some naming
02:26 - structures there so I'm going to make
02:28 - our class code webinar for this class
02:31 - because it's easy to remember
02:34 - we will continue
02:39 - so this is where the grade level and the
02:42 - pacing stuff comes into play so we used
02:44 - to have playlists and I'm sure some of
02:46 - you remember that you loved that you
02:48 - could stop students from accessing
02:49 - things you have not taught yet
02:52 - um if you still want to use that feature
02:55 - where you only have students on the
02:57 - levels that you have taught the lessons
02:59 - for you would click assign lessons
03:02 - manually if you want everything open for
03:05 - a free play situation you would click I
03:07 - want to assign all now I will note again
03:10 - that whatever grade level you chose when
03:13 - you say all you're only choosing for
03:15 - that grade so if you want everything you
03:17 - would do K through five if you made a
03:20 - second grade class and you click all
03:21 - that all only means all of the second
03:24 - grade content this can be changed later
03:26 - when you click on manage class which
03:28 - we'll get to but for now I'm going to do
03:30 - I want to assign lessons manually
03:51 - there you go I think can everyone see
03:54 - our cursor all right
03:56 - it's waving
03:58 - okay great so I'm going to go to our
04:00 - dashboard
04:02 - so we're on the second grade pacing
04:04 - these are all of the lessons that are
04:06 - aligned with second grade
04:09 - um this again can be changed later so
04:13 - um
04:15 - so as we talked about if you want to
04:16 - change your pacing say you decide you
04:18 - want your second graders to have access
04:20 - to some first grade stuff or some third
04:22 - grade content you can go to K through
04:24 - five and you'll see that that changes
04:26 - what they have access to
04:28 - and if you want to change how your
04:30 - assigning levels you can go to manage
04:33 - class and you'll see down here you can
04:35 - assign all practice levels and if you've
04:38 - already done that and you don't want it
04:39 - that way you can unassign practice level
04:41 - s here
04:43 - we're going to go back
04:44 - so if you've chosen to assign levels
04:47 - manually you'll do that directly from a
04:49 - lesson plan so let's just click on our
04:51 - first lesson plan
04:54 - and you'll see assigned practice levels
04:56 - here if you don't click on this and
04:58 - you've chosen to assign levels manually
05:00 - your students when they log into the
05:02 - game will not have access to any lessons
05:04 - so as soon as you click this that will
05:06 - be what shows up on their devices
05:10 - so we're going to start talking a little
05:12 - bit about um the lesson plan since we
05:14 - have them up here so all of our lesson
05:17 - plans are designed to follow
05:21 - all of our lesson plans are designed to
05:22 - follow a gradual release model so that's
05:25 - the I do we do you do structure so I'm
05:28 - going to open these tabs so we can see
05:30 - more in our lesson plan
05:35 - and if you've never seen one of our
05:36 - lesson plans before
05:38 - we'll look on the left so this is where
05:40 - you'll see the name for the lesson plan
05:41 - you can print directly from your teacher
05:44 - dashboard
05:45 - any materials which you'll see listed
05:47 - here you can download
05:50 - by clicking here
05:51 - and again you can assign the practice
05:53 - lessons
05:55 - here are the learning objectives so in
05:57 - this lesson students will be able to
05:58 - explain what a programmer does students
06:00 - will be able to move a robot forward
06:02 - Spin and jump using basic programming
06:04 - language
06:05 - if we click here you'll see our
06:07 - standards listed which we'll talk about
06:09 - a bit more
06:10 - um and you'll see vocabulary for the
06:12 - lesson
06:14 - I'm going to pause for just a second
06:15 - because I'm getting some feedback that
06:18 - it's a little small hard to see see if
06:21 - we can make this better
06:23 - command plus
06:27 - Lizzie can you get that
06:36 - improve things quite a bit for everybody
06:38 - and
06:41 - see about our cursor here
07:02 - okay I think that we've had that
07:10 - yeah show cursor okay so we should be
07:12 - all set great sorry no problem okay so
07:18 - we will walk through the structure of
07:19 - our lesson plans
07:21 - um all of the codable lesson plans that
07:23 - are aligned with our game levels follow
07:25 - the idea we do you do structure and a
07:28 - little bit we're going to introduce our
07:30 - lesson Library which is more flexible
07:32 - um there are many lessons there are more
07:34 - free form open-ended there's a lot of
07:37 - resources that are not following this
07:39 - structure but for our lessons that are
07:41 - aligned with our standards and our game
07:43 - they do follow this so for direct
07:46 - instruction this is where you'll
07:48 - introduce the programming Concepts
07:50 - including all the vocabulary
07:52 - and this is usually about 10 to 15
07:56 - minutes long
07:57 - after direct instruction you'll move
07:59 - into a guided practice activity
08:02 - um this is either whole group or in
08:04 - pairs and usually has some materials
08:06 - like I said they're all included here
08:09 - um students will be working
08:10 - collaboratively and applying the concept
08:14 - off screen before they work on screen so
08:17 - so after the guided practice activity
08:20 - which is about 20 minutes students will
08:22 - move into the independent practice
08:23 - portions this is where they'll apply the
08:25 - concept completely independently this is
08:28 - in the game so students will get on the
08:31 - app or play at game.codable.com and use
08:34 - that class code
08:37 - up here this is our class code students
08:39 - will log in with that class code and
08:41 - choose their name from the class list to
08:44 - play and do their independent practice
08:46 - and every quotable lesson ends with an
08:48 - exit ticket or some kind of informal
08:50 - assessment
08:52 - you can also assign practice levels at
08:54 - the bottom of each lesson plan
09:03 - all right I'm going to try our cursor
09:05 - one more time guys I've got all the
09:07 - settings clicked so I'm not really sure
09:09 - what's going on
09:19 - okay
09:20 - I want to see that
09:22 - you can just click on that
09:29 - um
09:35 - okay so we're gonna just voice out what
09:39 - we're what we're clicking on I don't
09:41 - know
09:42 - okay for anybody who is considering the
09:44 - wirecast play streaming service through
09:48 - uh YouTube
09:49 - not going to give it five stars
09:53 - um so yeah so we have our it's supposed
09:56 - to be showing our cursor but it's not
09:58 - showing up so we'll have to do some
09:59 - troubleshooting we want to use this
10:01 - again but for now we're just gonna say
10:03 - like what button we're clicking on
10:06 - um and when we highlight it it should
10:07 - change color do some sort of action
10:10 - um Bree if you're pointing to actual
10:11 - text like it shouldn't highlight it for
10:13 - them that should help sure okay we're
10:15 - actually coming off of this lesson plan
10:17 - to the top of your page so you'll see it
10:21 - should have just highlighted orange my
10:23 - classes lesson Library
10:25 - students progress and admin so we're
10:29 - just going to talk a little bit about
10:31 - some of the tabs that you see at the top
10:33 - um and what they do before we get into
10:35 - the lesson Library which we're super
10:37 - excited to talk about um actually we had
10:39 - a question from Maureen she asked um can
10:43 - you share students with another teacher
10:45 - and so actually Maureen uh right now
10:49 - that's just it's a codable school
10:51 - feature so
10:52 - um if you're a paid user of codable then
10:54 - you have the option to create admins and
10:57 - they can actually see you know all of
10:59 - the students and teachers within your
11:01 - school and set up classes for people and
11:04 - monitor student progress and all kinds
11:05 - of things like that from an admin level
11:07 - but uh on the free version it's not an
11:10 - option to link accounts and share
11:13 - classes with other teachers so we do
11:15 - have that option it's just part of our
11:17 - paid program
11:18 - cool so my classes is where we started
11:23 - and this is where you'll do anything to
11:25 - manage your classes so you'll see we
11:27 - have a list of classes
11:28 - um I know you cannot see my cursor so
11:31 - I'm hovering over the class names here
11:34 - and I'm going to click under first grade
11:36 - on grade one just to show you an example
11:38 - and this should look familiar because we
11:41 - saw this when we created our first class
11:43 - I just want to show you how you can
11:45 - manage by clicking manage class
11:48 - this is where you can add students this
11:50 - green add students button transfer class
11:53 - roster if you want to switch this class
11:56 - roster to another class so maybe you had
11:59 - a second grade class and they went to
12:01 - third grade and you want to move your
12:03 - first grade class now into second grade
12:04 - you could do that by clicking transfer
12:07 - class and selecting where you'd like to
12:09 - move it
12:11 - um we're not going to do that right now
12:12 - and here this purple print parent
12:13 - instructions button will download a
12:16 - handout for you to send home
12:18 - um with a student code for each student
12:20 - they can log in and practice at home
12:23 - if you want to make any changes to the
12:25 - class if you look on the right side of
12:28 - this page you'll see edit class class
12:31 - name you can change it anytime class
12:34 - code say you think you know I 6 k v m ZN
12:38 - is too hard to remember you could change
12:40 - it there if a new teacher is taking over
12:43 - the class you could change the teacher
12:45 - here again this is part of the admin
12:48 - feature so say I was an admin at my
12:50 - school and right now I have it assigned
12:53 - to me but I want to make sure that
12:56 - um Miss eatsam has has access to her
13:00 - class I could just change it to her
13:02 - um and change the teacher and then she
13:05 - could now access this from her teacher
13:07 - dashboard and view all of the students
13:09 - and all the student progress and manage
13:11 - her class from there so it's really nice
13:13 - if you're setting up classes for other
13:16 - teachers in your organization to have
13:18 - that feature available to you and again
13:21 - with this grade level option down here
13:23 - if you change the grade level it will
13:25 - change the pacing so your your students
13:28 - will have access you and your students
13:29 - will have access to different material
13:31 - depending on what grade level you choose
13:33 - and I know we mentioned before about
13:35 - assigning all practice levels at once
13:37 - this orange button and on assigning
13:40 - practice levels and that's where you can
13:42 - manage if your students have you know a
13:44 - free-for-all situation where they can
13:46 - just kind of play through you'd want to
13:48 - assign all but again if you want to
13:50 - assign from the lesson plan like we just
13:52 - talked about you would want to do that
13:54 - manually
13:56 - so we are going to go back up to the top
13:58 - of the page and we're going to click on
14:00 - students should highlight Orange
14:03 - this is where you'll see all students
14:05 - that you have listed
14:07 - um you can filter by class to search for
14:09 - a student you can just type a student
14:11 - into the search you can transfer
14:14 - students you can delete students you can
14:17 - create new students by clicking the
14:19 - green create new student button and
14:21 - adding them to a class of your choice
14:24 - you can print parent instructions or you
14:26 - can import an existing student so if you
14:29 - have a student that already has an
14:30 - account you would click import student
14:33 - and enter their code and name and select
14:36 - a class to add them to
14:40 - here we have the progress bar at the top
14:43 - this orange progress button when we
14:45 - click here
14:47 - this loads the progress for all of your
14:50 - classes so if you want to look at a
14:52 - class progress
14:54 - um just per class you would click this
14:56 - middle class progress view button
15:00 - and you can select a class from your
15:02 - list so let's see who might have
15:05 - progress here
15:07 - we'll look at
15:09 - hour of code and we can see how far we
15:12 - are through the lesson plans how many
15:14 - programs have been written so that's how
15:16 - many levels students have played through
15:19 - and how students are progressing through
15:21 - each unit
15:25 - all right so now we are going to go to
15:28 - back to the top and go to lesson Library
15:30 - please
15:34 - ready in the past few weeks for back to
15:37 - school so we're super excited about this
15:40 - um so the lesson library is great
15:42 - because as the curriculum developer here
15:44 - it gives us the freedom to collaborate
15:47 - with other teachers and to write coding
15:49 - lessons that include content areas that
15:52 - are not something that we've we have in
15:54 - our full curriculum so now we have
15:57 - lessons that include math Ela we have a
16:00 - robotics unit and we have the freedom
16:02 - really to create coding lessons out of
16:04 - any discipline so
16:06 - we are going to start by looking on the
16:09 - left hand side under filters
16:12 - this is kind of a way for you to search
16:14 - as though you're shopping so if you're
16:16 - online shopping and you know what you're
16:18 - looking for you typically use a filter
16:20 - right you're not going to search for
16:21 - shoes if you're looking for shirts so
16:24 - this can really help you narrow down
16:25 - your search we have a lot of lessons and
16:27 - we're going to be adding more
16:29 - um super excited that teachers can also
16:32 - submit their own lessons so if you have
16:34 - your own I'll show you how to do that
16:36 - um but just for this purpose I really
16:39 - want to show you our new robotics unit
16:41 - so I'm going to go to content area
16:44 - robotics
16:46 - and you'll see that it loads our new
16:48 - robotics units so we're super excited
16:51 - that we partnered with Wonder workshop
16:52 - and I'm sure you're all fans of Dash and
16:55 - dots yes Dash and Dot are now part of
16:57 - the codable family so I will click on
17:00 - our first one just to give you guys a
17:02 - little
17:04 - Snippets so what's great about the
17:05 - lesson library is you can save these
17:09 - lessons so you'll browse like a catalog
17:11 - it's not going to show up on your
17:12 - dashboard these lessons unless you
17:14 - explicitly search or save them um and
17:18 - you can add them to what you already
17:20 - have via our pacing so if you've created
17:23 - a second grade class and you're on
17:25 - second grade pasting you definitely have
17:27 - those lessons saved but if you want to
17:29 - teach a robotics unit you can add that
17:31 - to what you already have so by clicking
17:33 - save this lesson
17:35 - I can then choose a class to save it too
17:38 - I'm going to save this to our webinar
17:41 - class and you'll see that it highlights
17:43 - and hovers when you hover it it'll
17:45 - highlight and you can save
17:48 - and now this lesson is saved to our
17:50 - class so we can add any kind of coding
17:54 - lesson we want or we can just stick to
17:56 - the codable curriculum
17:58 - um I'm going to go back to the lesson
18:00 - library though and show you so this
18:03 - Banner at the top is our featured unit
18:05 - obviously it's back to school so we're
18:08 - featuring back to school lessons and I
18:10 - want to show these two because there's a
18:13 - good example of um
18:16 - coding lessons that you can teach
18:17 - unplugged your first couple weeks of
18:19 - school so the new lesson in the lesson
18:21 - Library
18:23 - um are not linked to game content so
18:25 - these are the idea of the lesson
18:26 - libraries for coding to be taught every
18:29 - day
18:30 - um and you can do that in a variety of
18:32 - ways and that's what we're trying to to
18:34 - do we're trying to spread awareness that
18:37 - coding is everywhere and also that you
18:39 - know you can integrate coding into what
18:41 - you're already doing so we're going to
18:43 - take a look at our first back to school
18:47 - lesson so this is a kindergarten lesson
18:49 - but so I'm going to interrupt you for
18:50 - sure we had a question about the lesson
18:53 - Library Maureen was asking if this is
18:55 - premium only or can anybody access it so
19:00 - it's free to everybody to use
19:02 - um you'll see in I'm gonna just go back
19:04 - to it for just a second
19:06 - um you'll see so lessons that are free
19:09 - to use have no icon special icon on them
19:13 - um but if I was to click on third grade
19:16 - um
19:17 - you'll see some have codable school so
19:20 - those are our paid lessons those are
19:22 - part of our paid curriculum so anything
19:24 - that doesn't have that icon you can use
19:25 - completely free
19:27 - um and add it to any of your classes
19:31 - which is awesome
19:33 - okay so we'll go back to this it's a
19:36 - kindergarten lesson um just because of
19:39 - the
19:40 - activity that we chose but you can use
19:43 - this as a template
19:45 - um and you can really run with it and
19:48 - use your own classroom procedures to
19:50 - teach coding in the same way so I'm
19:52 - going to save this lesson to a
19:54 - Kindergarten class because I want to use
19:58 - it for kindergarten
20:00 - so that will be added to that
20:01 - kindergarten class so in this lesson
20:04 - students will be able to follow a
20:06 - sequence of steps related to classroom
20:08 - procedures and programming so this
20:10 - lesson introduces the concept of
20:12 - sequence and following steps and
20:14 - breaking tasks down into steps
20:17 - um and we used hand washing as an
20:20 - example but I'm sure that you can think
20:21 - of 100 classroom procedures that you can
20:24 - break down and train students to follow
20:26 - in a sequence and relate to programming
20:28 - so in this particular lesson
20:30 - students are following a sequence of
20:33 - steps they're using those sight words
20:35 - first next then and last
20:38 - and they're practicing a classroom
20:40 - procedure that will be used every day in
20:43 - their classroom
20:44 - um and the materials that go with it
20:46 - just like our other lessons are
20:48 - available for download as well
20:52 - do we have a question uh nope that's
20:54 - great I think we're good so you guys can
20:57 - feel free to oh we do have a question uh
20:59 - can you say the lesson to multiple
21:01 - classes
21:02 - you can yeah so say
21:06 - um actually you can see Pinterest too
21:08 - yeah
21:10 - so uh Brie was saving this to Blue uh to
21:14 - test but actually I had already saved it
21:17 - to my blue class so you can see you can
21:19 - remove it from here as well
21:20 - um so if I wanted to assign it to all of
21:22 - my kindergarten classes say I would just
21:24 - hover over the next generation and save
21:27 - it to them and so it's actually saved to
21:29 - all of my kindergarten classes so I can
21:31 - be sure to go over coding and classroom
21:34 - procedures with all of my Kinders so
21:38 - yes
21:39 - great
21:41 - so
21:42 - we're going to get into talking about
21:44 - the game and some updates we've made
21:46 - over the summer to the game but before
21:48 - we do that I just want to note that the
21:51 - codable lessons
21:52 - um
21:53 - that exist on your dashboard already as
21:56 - part of our curriculum
21:58 - you can assign or you can pin and save
22:02 - them but um those are linked to game
22:04 - content other lessons in the lesson
22:06 - Library are not so I got a question this
22:08 - week from a teacher who was wondering
22:09 - where the online content was for some of
22:12 - these lesson Library
22:14 - lessons and there's actually not game
22:17 - content so it's just important to note
22:19 - that if you don't see it listed in the
22:20 - lesson plan it does not go with
22:24 - um specific game content although you
22:25 - can have obviously your students
22:27 - practice sequence after they do you know
22:29 - this hand watching lesson because that
22:31 - makes sense but it's just not explicitly
22:33 - going to say do this lesson online
22:36 - so we are going to move into the game I
22:39 - just want to make sure I didn't miss
22:40 - anything sure uh we also have a question
22:44 - from mum bugs who asks if
22:48 - um we should so she has some students
22:50 - who have never been doing any coding
22:52 - before
22:53 - um she didn't say what grade they're in
22:54 - but uh she said should they start at a
22:57 - kindergarten level and that's a great
22:58 - question and something we get a lot
23:00 - um so actually I'll share our our
23:02 - recommended pacing for your first year
23:05 - of coding uh in the chat but we
23:08 - recommend that everyone start at the
23:09 - kindergarten level if you have not done
23:11 - any coding before and you're just your
23:13 - older students are just going to move at
23:15 - a little bit of an accelerated pace so
23:17 - they may not need to spend nearly as
23:19 - long learning about sequence as your
23:21 - kindergarteners would however it is
23:23 - important just like you know if you were
23:25 - learning to read for the first time in
23:27 - fifth grade you would still need to
23:29 - learn your ABCs you would need to learn
23:30 - about sentence structure and about
23:32 - um the sounds of words and everything
23:34 - like that so
23:36 - um it's the same thing for coding we
23:37 - need everybody to start from the
23:39 - beginning so yes I would suggest a
23:41 - kindergarten and starting with the
23:43 - kindergarten content but if you assign a
23:45 - fifth grade class
23:47 - um encodable it will automatically put
23:49 - them on that year one pacing and then
23:52 - it'll just Mark things off as you go
23:54 - through codable
23:55 - um So eventually they'll get up to the
23:56 - fifth grade content so yeah thanks for
24:00 - the question
24:01 - great so we are going to move to the
24:04 - game content so if you have students
24:08 - um working in the app on an iPad uh make
24:11 - sure that you update your apps because
24:14 - we've made a lot of changes and we want
24:16 - you to have access to all the awesome
24:17 - news stuff in our latest release
24:19 - so update your apps on your iPads um and
24:22 - if you are playing on the web again it's
24:24 - game.codile.com so you can access
24:27 - um the on-screen lessons either way so
24:30 - we're going to enter our class code
24:33 - um
24:34 - use a different
24:39 - great and one recommendation that I do
24:43 - have which is also a video resource
24:45 - we'll be sharing as a teaching tip is to
24:47 - make yourself a teacher profile so I'm
24:50 - on a teacher profile right now and what
24:53 - that means is every lesson is unlocked
24:55 - already so if I want to help a student
24:58 - who's in Australia I don't have to play
25:00 - all the way through planet smeeborg to
25:02 - be able to help them with the level that
25:04 - they're on so I can see what they have
25:06 - access to and um yeah I can hop around
25:09 - and Skip around levels and work with
25:10 - students and it's just super important
25:13 - for teachers to be able to see exactly
25:15 - what it is that students are working on
25:18 - um no matter what level they're at
25:20 - so I'm going to navigate us over here to
25:24 - our awesome fuzz in his spaceship or her
25:26 - I'm not sure in their spaceship and we
25:29 - are going to explore our new ship
25:32 - control panel actually first do you mind
25:35 - if we go through
25:37 - um like just one level of sequence but
25:39 - sure people can see yeah uh just to kind
25:42 - of get everybody familiar with what
25:44 - codable looks like if you're just
25:45 - starting out with your students say this
25:47 - is your first year teaching you just
25:48 - taught your first lesson on whether it's
25:51 - hand washing sequence
25:53 - um the fuzz family frenzy whatever it
25:55 - may be and your students are just
25:57 - getting started in the game
25:59 - um when they first log in they can click
26:01 - play and it'll take them automatically
26:03 - to the levels that have been assigned to
26:05 - them
26:06 - um you can also take them to the very
26:09 - first level of sequence
26:11 - um and that's where they will be
26:13 - starting and so what we have them
26:15 - starting out with is just very simple
26:17 - you know putting arrows in the correct
26:19 - order to get their fuzz through the Maze
26:22 - and we work them all the way up from
26:24 - this to writing in JavaScript in fifth
26:27 - grade so going over object oriented
26:28 - programming with actual syntax and
26:32 - instantiating objects and all kinds of
26:34 - crazy things and all of your teacher
26:36 - materials will actually explain those
26:38 - Concepts to you before you go in to
26:39 - teach your first class
26:41 - um but yeah so if you're following the
26:44 - codable track as as far as that pacing
26:47 - guide that I just sent goes students
26:49 - will start here in a very simple maze
26:51 - but then it quickly gets diffic more and
26:54 - more difficult and working them up to
26:56 - JavaScript so but we actually have been
27:00 - hard at work adding some creative
27:02 - content which is what breed's going to
27:04 - take over talking about
27:08 - for those who are new
27:12 - um so we're going to go back to our new
27:15 - open-ended creative content so
27:18 - we added two new
27:20 - um I guess features here
27:23 - um we have this I'm hovering over I
27:25 - don't think you can see my arrow in the
27:27 - middle this maze is build your own maze
27:30 - called our maze maker and then this
27:32 - green pick a fuzz you can build your own
27:34 - fuzz we're going to start with maze
27:36 - maker
27:38 - um
27:39 - so we I would recommend using the maze
27:43 - maker for K through two students and
27:46 - build your own fuzz for upper grade
27:48 - students that being said what what
27:50 - Gretchen just mentioned about you know
27:52 - if upper grade students don't have
27:53 - coding experience then in this case I
27:56 - would say maze maker so this is more for
27:58 - beginner coders
28:00 - um who have not had experience yet with
28:02 - sequence or conditions or loops and
28:05 - functions because that is what they'll
28:07 - be doing in maze maker build your own
28:09 - fuzz has a lot of JavaScript syntax we
28:12 - talk about variables and properties and
28:15 - um
28:15 - that's much more advanced and I need
28:17 - this Foundation First so that should be
28:20 - kept in mind with our creative content
28:23 - um I'm gonna pause for one second we've
28:24 - got quite a few questions sure uh
28:26 - Maureen asks do you find that kids need
28:28 - a refresher to get back up to speed or
28:30 - can they easily pick up where they left
28:32 - off if you're coming in for the new year
28:35 - um and say they haven't been doing any
28:36 - coding over the summer I would suggest
28:38 - maybe one or two lessons of refresher
28:42 - um if you look at the different grades
28:44 - for beyond your first year in that
28:47 - pacing guide that I showed you you can
28:48 - tell it's sort of stacked um and
28:50 - scaffolded so there's about
28:52 - um maybe like a half a unit of review on
28:55 - the last concept that they learned in
28:57 - the school year the year before
28:59 - um but I think you'll find that students
29:01 - pick it up pretty quickly
29:04 - um after some light Refresher
29:06 - um and then we have a question from
29:08 - Carla who oh sorry Tracy is 7.3.5 the
29:12 - most recent version
29:15 - um
29:16 - I am not certain about that actually I
29:20 - will double check for you Tracy uh and
29:22 - I'll post it in the chat
29:24 - um
29:25 - Carla asks do your students have to say
29:28 - when they exit the game or does it save
29:29 - for them uh so it saves for them so if
29:33 - you're using the web version and you
29:35 - just have them exit it will save
29:37 - um and then whenever they come back
29:39 - using their class code
29:41 - um it'll have all of their progress
29:42 - saved the same with the app so if you're
29:45 - using codable on the iPad you it'll save
29:49 - all of their progress locally on the
29:51 - device and then when that device is
29:53 - connected to the internet it'll send it
29:55 - to us and then anytime they log in with
29:58 - their class code their progress would be
29:59 - saved so yes we save automatically
30:06 - any other questions before we we have a
30:10 - question from
30:11 - 777 a a n g and they ask how do you
30:15 - update the app in iPads so um if you're
30:18 - using configurator for your school
30:21 - um your it person will probably be able
30:24 - to set that up for you it's a way to
30:25 - like Mass update all of your iPads
30:27 - otherwise if you go to the App Store you
30:29 - should be able to see your updates there
30:31 - it'll tell you how many updates you have
30:33 - and if it doesn't say that there's an
30:35 - update available for codable then you're
30:37 - on the latest version
30:40 - great
30:41 - all right so we're going to get back to
30:44 - maze maker um again it's it's best for
30:49 - beginners who are looking to build that
30:51 - foundation and it's awesome for
30:53 - assessment so if you want to test what
30:56 - your students can do this is a great way
30:58 - to have them build their own problems
31:01 - and solve their own problems so it's
31:03 - almost like they're working backwards
31:05 - and we'll get into that
31:06 - um it's also super fun and Visually
31:08 - appealing so that's another added bonus
31:10 - we're going to pick an awesome
31:13 - binary code background kids love also
31:16 - creating mazes and challenging one
31:18 - another we had some kids in the office
31:20 - who were having a blast making
31:22 - Unstoppable mazes for each other and so
31:25 - just like our curriculum is scaffolded
31:27 - um students will not be able to add
31:29 - loops and functions until they're there
31:32 - in the game so this will unlock the maze
31:36 - maker um
31:38 - let's start I'm looking for elements
31:40 - will unlock as they move through right
31:42 - so we're going to start by dragging some
31:45 - tiles I'm not really thinking this out
31:47 - which I don't recommend because students
31:50 - should be thinking critically and
31:51 - planning it um this is just going to be
31:53 - a simple example and then I can add
31:57 - awesome decoration
32:01 - um
32:02 - as I please and then I can lay out the
32:04 - star path so the stars mean
32:08 - the maze has to be solved um correctly
32:11 - oops
32:13 - so if I were to place a star in a more
32:16 - complex puzzle um that wasn't the best
32:19 - way to solve the maze then all three
32:21 - stars would not be earned which means I
32:22 - didn't solve this puzzle most
32:24 - efficiently this is a basic puzzle
32:27 - though
32:28 - this up here this pink button I don't
32:30 - think you can see me hovering over it at
32:32 - click on it is the Eraser
32:35 - um just in case you need to erase
32:37 - so once we build our maze I'm going to
32:40 - add one condition tile
32:42 - s we can test
32:45 - so we need to go right
32:49 - down so you can see this is sort of
32:52 - similar to uh the game that I was
32:54 - showing you earlier if you're new to
32:56 - codable
32:56 - um this is sort of just a play on our
32:58 - classic amazing maze puzzle game
33:02 - um and in this particular maze that
33:06 - Bree's created we're learning all about
33:07 - sequins and a little bit about
33:09 - conditions so here there's a pink
33:11 - condition tile so what this means is if
33:14 - I hit a pink tile then I go right so
33:17 - I have to put our condition down and
33:20 - then the arrow on top
33:21 - and now we'll test our names to do that
33:31 - all right and so we created and solved a
33:34 - maze and
33:37 - so I'm gonna go back just for time's
33:39 - sake and
33:41 - see if there are any questions about
33:43 - maze knicker before we move on to
33:45 - building our own fuzz
33:46 - um
33:47 - or
33:49 - nope
33:51 - Let's see we have a question from Jane
33:54 - Malone Miller are the lessons with bebot
33:57 - or blue bot robots they are with Dash
34:01 - and Dot robot uh which are from Wonder
34:04 - Workshop uh and but but the way that
34:08 - Bree wrote them uh was intended for them
34:11 - to be easily adaptable to whatever
34:13 - robots you have in your classroom so
34:15 - they were specifically designed for Dash
34:17 - and Dot but say you have b-bots
34:19 - um or some other robot in your classroom
34:21 - say a Sphero or something I think you
34:23 - could easily adapt it
34:24 - um to solve the same yeah it would take
34:27 - a little
34:28 - um work to adapt it a little bit of time
34:30 - just because the Wonder Workshop app and
34:33 - robots are used and
34:36 - um they're going to be different from
34:37 - vbots and things like that but the
34:39 - actual content
34:41 - um and teaching is totally applicable to
34:44 - any robot so the activities use those
34:47 - robots
34:48 - um that might be where you need to
34:49 - switch it up a little but the actual
34:51 - instruction I think will will apply
34:55 - all right so we are going to one more
34:58 - question from Tracy Williams do you
35:00 - recommend starting over each year my
35:02 - first grade students moved really
35:03 - quickly last year and most have done all
35:06 - of smeborg and Astoria I don't feel like
35:08 - they are ready for bug world
35:10 - um
35:10 - yes first graders I don't recommend
35:13 - putting into bug world uh unless you
35:17 - have one who one or two in your class
35:19 - you feel are like totally ready for that
35:21 - it is definitely a fifth grade concept
35:24 - especially if you're not teaching the
35:26 - content like if you're not planning on
35:27 - using the lessons and you just want them
35:29 - going through the game
35:30 - it is not recommended it is it's pretty
35:33 - complicated stuff I mean they're doing
35:34 - they're writing JavaScript so I would
35:37 - say
35:37 - um holding off on that until they're in
35:40 - third fourth or fifth grade
35:41 - um it's definitely an upper elementary
35:43 - uh type of content
35:45 - you're actually going to see it a little
35:47 - bit here with our with our fuzz uh
35:49 - Creator some of the some of the
35:51 - JavaScript that we use in codable
35:54 - so when we hit build here
35:57 - this is directly related to bug world so
36:00 - this is Javascript
36:02 - um classes and objects and properties
36:05 - are all JavaScript and part of object
36:08 - oriented programming so we're going to
36:10 - name our class and this is exactly how
36:12 - you would do this in JavaScript we're
36:15 - going to name this webinar class
36:17 - when we click this check mark this is
36:21 - Javascript syntax so
36:25 - okay so what we're doing is we are
36:28 - creating
36:30 - um our fuzz so to but to get started
36:32 - making our fuzz we need to construct our
36:34 - fuzz so you can see our Constructor here
36:37 - um we're gonna add a body to our fuzz
36:40 - and we can actually modify this property
36:43 - which is another concept that we cover
36:45 - in bug world
36:47 - um
36:47 - so we're going to say this is our body
36:50 - and the body property is Pink
36:56 - um so then we need to add eyes
36:58 - so the eyes property for our webinar
37:02 - fuzz are going to be green Gray
37:07 - and we have to add a mouth
37:10 - so the mouth property for this Buzz
37:14 - right now is going to be
37:17 - cheese those are values
37:20 - yeah
37:21 - um so yeah the property value for this
37:23 - is going to be cheese
37:26 - um so then we have a function for
37:29 - getting dressed so what we do is we
37:32 - would add
37:36 - mohawk
37:38 - and let's add some glasses
37:48 - party glasses so our webinar fuzz is
37:51 - ready to party and all of these Concepts
37:53 - that you see here in this JavaScript are
37:55 - part of bug world and they are all
37:57 - covered in the lesson plans on
38:00 - object-oriented programming and
38:02 - JavaScript you can access all of the
38:04 - information from your teacher dashboard
38:06 - and your teacher materials cover all of
38:09 - these things that I just mentioned like
38:11 - um classes and objects and values and
38:14 - properties everything that we said here
38:16 - functions they're all covered in that
38:19 - content so
38:20 - um you can feel totally prepared when
38:22 - you're explaining it to your students
38:23 - what exactly is going on here and I
38:26 - guess I would use this opportunity to
38:28 - stress the importance of actually
38:30 - teaching unplugged before getting
38:33 - students onto this so I would not have
38:35 - students I wouldn't even show them the
38:37 - open-ended content until they've learned
38:39 - what they're doing
38:41 - um because this can be fun and great and
38:43 - it looks pretty and kids love it but if
38:45 - they don't know what it is and what
38:46 - they're doing then it really does lose
38:48 - its value so I would hold off on
38:51 - introducing this until you've taught
38:52 - these Concepts to your students unless
38:55 - you're taking you know just an explore
38:56 - to Learn Type approach but then again
38:59 - coming back to the lessons after they've
39:02 - explored it is really important so that
39:03 - they have the vocabulary to talk about
39:05 - and articulate what they're what they're
39:07 - doing
39:08 - to have questions
39:13 - um it looks like John is in the process
39:15 - of answering some questions
39:18 - um
39:23 - let's see here I don't think I see
39:29 - any questions that haven't been answered
39:31 - so okay
39:33 - um let's see here
39:35 - game updates so the last thing that we
39:37 - want to cover
39:39 - um
39:41 - to our faces hi
39:44 - so
39:45 - um the last thing that we want to say is
39:47 - that we have tons and tons of resources
39:49 - available for you all we spent the
39:51 - summer uh kind of going through
39:53 - everything and making sure that it's
39:56 - easily accessible from a few different
39:58 - locations
39:59 - um as well as making sure that it's
40:01 - updated and ready to go for the new year
40:03 - so
40:04 - um a great place to go for uh
40:07 - information and articles about
40:08 - everything that we've covered here
40:10 - actually is our help center and you can
40:13 - access that from support.codable.com uh
40:16 - Bree and I and John all write articles
40:19 - there
40:20 - um whenever we feel like there's
40:21 - something that we've been answering a
40:22 - lot of questions to we'll put in there
40:24 - also if we have new features that we
40:26 - want to make sure everyone understands
40:28 - we'll put articles there another great
40:31 - resource is our blog uh so that's
40:34 - blog.codehole.com I know we have really
40:36 - creative URLs and you can find helpful
40:39 - articles there as well as updates on
40:42 - codable and what we're doing and what
40:44 - we're working on right now we have a
40:47 - contest going for the year of code you
40:50 - can tell us your coding challenge for
40:52 - yourself for the year and we'll check in
40:54 - with people randomly throughout the year
40:56 - and if you're on track then you can win
40:58 - prizes for your class so
41:00 - um that's a good place to stay tuned to
41:02 - like know what's going on with codable
41:04 - um what our updates are and things like
41:06 - that
41:08 - um the last place that I would suggest
41:10 - uh checking if you have questions about
41:13 - codable is
41:15 - um YouTube we do a lot of tutorials and
41:17 - tips as well as like product tours and
41:20 - things like that on our YouTube channel
41:22 - you're probably on it right now watching
41:24 - this so you're familiar with it but but
41:27 - yeah I would definitely suggest poking
41:29 - around some of our videos we have videos
41:30 - for every single concept that we teach
41:32 - in codable including sequence conditions
41:35 - but also covering classes and variables
41:38 - and properties so
41:40 - um all of these things that we've
41:41 - mentioned are covered in a multitude of
41:43 - places
41:45 - um we did have one question about coding
41:48 - terms and simplifying definitions for
41:50 - kids and you were just mentioning some
41:52 - of our resources and I think our teacher
41:55 - overviews have videos and they're
41:57 - actually meant for adults or for
41:59 - teachers they're not the most
42:00 - kid-friendly they're just not that fun I
42:02 - guess but
42:03 - um I think there are a lot of visuals in
42:05 - those videos that may be helpful for
42:07 - kids to understand especially conditions
42:09 - and I would I would definitely recommend
42:12 - checking out our back to school lessons
42:15 - we have the lesson on conditions and
42:17 - conditional statements that really
42:18 - relates these programming terms to real
42:21 - life and I think that's the best way to
42:22 - help kids understand programming
42:25 - definitions is to to talk about them in
42:28 - ways that relate to things around them
42:29 - and that's what we try to do in some of
42:32 - our teacher materials and those videos
42:34 - so you may find that helpful
42:39 - is this the question you're in yeah
42:41 - yeah awesome I was just reading through
42:43 - the chat yeah okay
42:46 - um does anybody else have any questions
42:48 - for us I know we've gone through a lot
42:49 - tonight
42:51 - um but I want to make sure to answer any
42:52 - questions that may have come up we've
42:54 - we've tried pretty hard to answer as
42:56 - they've been coming but we'll wait a
42:58 - couple minutes to see if there's any
42:59 - more
43:02 - and while we're waiting actually I did
43:04 - also want to show
43:07 - if you have one question uh Tracy asks
43:10 - do you think you will be adding more
43:12 - levels to the paid version just more of
43:14 - the same concept uh we are planning to
43:18 - add more to bug world
43:21 - um and we are
43:25 - um focusing the rest of the year on
43:28 - Creative content so
43:30 - we've had a lot of feedback from people
43:32 - saying that they love that our linear uh
43:35 - our linear game content but that they're
43:37 - wanting more free open-ended content to
43:41 - let kids kind of practice the concepts
43:43 - that they've been learning
43:44 - um so we're really focusing on that for
43:46 - the next year but there will be more bug
43:49 - world content coming hopefully soon
43:56 - okay we'll wait a couple more minutes
43:59 - if there's any other questions and Bree
44:00 - wanted to show I just wanted to show if
44:03 - you have a great idea for teaching a
44:05 - certain concept or including coding in
44:07 - anything
44:08 - um you can submit a lesson I just want
44:10 - to show you where to do that so this
44:12 - orange submit my lesson button will just
44:15 - bring you to a Google form where you can
44:17 - tell us a little bit about your lesson
44:19 - and uh whatever you can fill in if we
44:24 - can create a lesson out of that even if
44:25 - you just have an idea fantastic we want
44:28 - to hear you know any ideas or even if
44:29 - you have full lessons we'd love you to
44:32 - submit them so that we can add them to
44:34 - our awesome lesson library and share it
44:36 - with your friends
44:37 - okay so I've got a couple questions here
44:41 - um Maureen asks do you find that the
44:44 - fifth graders pick up the syntax quickly
44:46 - uh drives me crazy is there a way that
44:49 - syntax errors are highlighted so uh the
44:52 - way that our syntax works is it types
44:55 - out most of it for them so we remove
44:57 - some of the frustration of like oh I've
44:59 - missed a semicolon or I missed a period
45:02 - or I have I'm missing a character
45:05 - um so that they can really just select
45:07 - the value that they want from a drop
45:10 - down so they'll see all of the syntax uh
45:12 - they just won't actually have to type it
45:14 - which is really nice for students who
45:16 - are still learning their typing skills
45:18 - um
45:19 - so syntax errors kind of eliminated from
45:22 - the whole thing which is really nice
45:25 - um and if you're going over the
45:26 - vocabulary with them you should find uh
45:29 - that they start to pick up the syntax
45:31 - pretty well because that's all covered
45:32 - in the lessons
45:34 - um so you'll be talking about it
45:35 - together in class
45:37 - and I think like most of our material is
45:39 - pretty scaffolded we don't just throw
45:40 - them into the syntax they're seeing it
45:42 - first before they're manipulating it and
45:44 - then eventually they'll be writing it
45:46 - but it's pretty gradual and yeah
45:49 - it builds on itself Tracy Williams asks
45:53 - can you lock the creative fuzz part of
45:55 - ship control panel uh no you can't right
45:58 - now but that is something we have Free's
46:00 - been advocating for since the moment we
46:02 - created I taught kindergarten in first
46:04 - grade so I am I'm saying we should lock
46:06 - it yeah and I have a feeling with the
46:08 - start of the school year we'll start
46:10 - getting more and more requests for that
46:11 - so
46:12 - um hopefully soon we'll be able to add
46:13 - that for you guys
46:16 - um Stacy blauer asks do you think there
46:19 - are enough lessons for an entire year
46:21 - with the free option
46:23 - uh so there are about 12 lessons uh 12
46:27 - weeks of lessons and that really depends
46:30 - on how in depth you want to go with
46:32 - coding in the library and in the library
46:34 - the library is more like supplemental
46:36 - things or if they're special occasions
46:38 - mini lessons things like that I think we
46:41 - have an Earth Day lesson in there
46:43 - um but yeah it really depends on how in
46:46 - depth you want to go if you guys are
46:47 - just exploring and you're figuring out
46:49 - this whole coding thing and you're just
46:51 - getting started absolutely like figure
46:53 - out if codable is the right thing for
46:54 - you figure out if it's something you
46:56 - want to continue teaching with
46:58 - um but if you're ready to sort of go in
47:00 - depth with your students and you really
47:01 - want them prepared at the end of
47:04 - um Elementary School to be writing apps
47:07 - and games and and websites and creating
47:09 - things in Middle School uh then I would
47:11 - say it'd be worth exploring the the paid
47:15 - content because we have now over 70
47:17 - weeks of of lessons you can really have
47:20 - a whole Year's worth of content
47:22 - um to teach your students and make sure
47:25 - that they're prepared for middle school
47:27 - so if that's something you're interested
47:29 - in you can always reach out to either me
47:30 - or Bree
47:32 - um or support codable.com and we can set
47:35 - up a quick chat with you get it getting
47:37 - to know sort of your coding goals we're
47:40 - trying to achieve in your school
47:42 - um and really get to know like yours you
47:44 - know your special situation and make a
47:46 - recommendation on what plan would be
47:48 - right for you
47:50 - um go over some of our pricing options
47:51 - and cover all that you would get with
47:53 - the school plan
47:57 - um so
47:59 - Kate molito asks I know each great each
48:02 - new grade level starts with a review
48:04 - from last year that does this
48:06 - reset student progress or will it show
48:10 - will it show those
48:13 - I think Kate what you're asking is
48:16 - um does it reset student progress if you
48:18 - do those reviews
48:21 - um
48:21 - it will not delete their previous
48:24 - attempts on in the game
48:27 - um it will just add more attempts to
48:29 - that progress so it'll say last
48:32 - attempted and it'll say they've
48:34 - attempted it you know five times however
48:37 - many times they've completed it and
48:39 - it'll show their highest score on that
48:42 - level so say they reviewed it and they
48:43 - did better than they did last year it'll
48:45 - show that high score
48:50 - [Music]
48:50 - um
48:52 - Tracy Williams asks can teachers make
48:55 - their own maze in the village of Maze
48:56 - and share it with students uh we yes you
49:00 - can absolutely create your own maze we
49:02 - are working on adding a sharing feature
49:05 - actually that's next on our agenda for
49:07 - the year so hopefully sometime in
49:09 - September or October that will be
49:11 - released to you guys
49:13 - um to start sharing it'll be between
49:15 - classes like sorry within within classes
49:17 - so students in your class will have
49:19 - access to mazes that were created by
49:21 - students in your class or by you
49:24 - um
49:25 - and not like with the world
49:27 - [Music]
49:30 - um Jesus saves me through and through
49:31 - asks how to record students progress if
49:35 - they are doing it manually as they do
49:37 - not yet have tablets that's a great
49:39 - question actually
49:41 - um we don't have any way of recording
49:44 - it is really nice a coding portfolio of
49:49 - all of their work which is really nice
49:50 - for them to take home at the end of the
49:52 - school year and sort of show their
49:53 - parents the other thing that's really
49:54 - important is parent interact engagement
49:57 - um parents just love
49:59 - seeing what their kids are learning at
50:01 - school and the kids love showing them
50:03 - and kind of being the expert on this New
50:06 - Concept that they just learned so that's
50:08 - another great way
50:12 - um
50:15 - Android version so
50:18 - um I can't see your username but uh we
50:21 - had an Android version
50:24 - and unfortunately since we are such a
50:26 - small team I don't know if you all know
50:27 - but we're five people
50:29 - uh and so we were not able to support it
50:33 - and we didn't want to keep it out there
50:35 - with it being not a great experience we
50:37 - also didn't have a ton of people using
50:39 - Android devices in the classroom
50:42 - um and so unfortunately we had to pull
50:43 - it from the Google Play Store but it is
50:47 - something that we want to eventually put
50:48 - back out there once we're able to
50:50 - support it so
50:51 - hopefully soon bye comfortable school
50:54 - and we can hire more people
50:57 - um yeah I think that that is
51:04 - all of the questions
51:08 - um
51:10 - yeah awesome well thank you all so much
51:13 - for joining us thank you for sticking
51:15 - with us through technical support at the
51:18 - beginning
51:18 - again if you're planning on using
51:22 - wirecast play
51:24 - maybe not
51:28 - um but anyway so have a really great
51:30 - start to your school year and feel free
51:31 - to reach out to us anytime
51:33 - support.codable.com
51:36 - um and we'll be happy to answer your
51:38 - questions yeah all right thank you back
51:41 - to school yay
51:42 - see ya
51:44 - thank you

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone this is Gretchen with codable I'm here with Bree gray our curriculum director and we are so excited for the new school year uh we are thrilled to have you all here and we are excited to walk you through some of the changes that we've made to codable over the past year but also to just if you're new to codable walk you through your dashboard uh get you all set up and make sure that you're good to go for the new year so um with that I'm gonna let Brie Take the Lead yeah um so we're gonna start um we're gonna Dive Right In and talk about adding your first class and setting your class up um and then we'll do a dashboard tour uh we can show you some of our new features we're really excited today we announced our lesson Library um so we have some exciting new lessons stuff to talk about and then we'll talk about game updates and share some resources with you so we'll Dive Right In Here to setting up our first class okay so we are on the top we're going to start again and talk about adding a glass um so we will add our class and again we're going to name this webinar so here is where you will decide the pacing that your students will be on you can change this later but this is how you'll manage the content that your students have access to so if you want everything to be open for your students you would do a K through five option if you have a Kindergarten class and you want them on our kindergarten pacing that would be this option so whatever grade level you choose will be the only content that they have access to and we'll talk more about how you can manage what they have access to within that grade level but the only only the grade level you choose will be what you have access to if you want to import students in bulk you can do that here and if you have Google classrooms you can do that by clicking here so let's continue we're going to add myself and Gretchen as students to this class so here you'll see that we've generated some options for class codes um if you have younger students you'll notice these would not be easy to remember so we actually have a tip of the week video that Gretchen will be sharing um just on creating an easy to remember class code and going over some naming structures there so I'm going to make our class code webinar for this class because it's easy to remember we will continue so this is where the grade level and the pacing stuff comes into play so we used to have playlists and I'm sure some of you remember that you loved that you could stop students from accessing things you have not taught yet um if you still want to use that feature where you only have students on the levels that you have taught the lessons for you would click assign lessons manually if you want everything open for a free play situation you would click I want to assign all now I will note again that whatever grade level you chose when you say all you're only choosing for that grade so if you want everything you would do K through five if you made a second grade class and you click all that all only means all of the second grade content this can be changed later when you click on manage class which we'll get to but for now I'm going to do I want to assign lessons manually there you go I think can everyone see our cursor all right it's waving okay great so I'm going to go to our dashboard so we're on the second grade pacing these are all of the lessons that are aligned with second grade um this again can be changed later so um so as we talked about if you want to change your pacing say you decide you want your second graders to have access to some first grade stuff or some third grade content you can go to K through five and you'll see that that changes what they have access to and if you want to change how your assigning levels you can go to manage class and you'll see down here you can assign all practice levels and if you've already done that and you don't want it that way you can unassign practice level s here we're going to go back so if you've chosen to assign levels manually you'll do that directly from a lesson plan so let's just click on our first lesson plan and you'll see assigned practice levels here if you don't click on this and you've chosen to assign levels manually your students when they log into the game will not have access to any lessons so as soon as you click this that will be what shows up on their devices so we're going to start talking a little bit about um the lesson plan since we have them up here so all of our lesson plans are designed to follow all of our lesson plans are designed to follow a gradual release model so that's the I do we do you do structure so I'm going to open these tabs so we can see more in our lesson plan and if you've never seen one of our lesson plans before we'll look on the left so this is where you'll see the name for the lesson plan you can print directly from your teacher dashboard any materials which you'll see listed here you can download by clicking here and again you can assign the practice lessons here are the learning objectives so in this lesson students will be able to explain what a programmer does students will be able to move a robot forward Spin and jump using basic programming language if we click here you'll see our standards listed which we'll talk about a bit more um and you'll see vocabulary for the lesson I'm going to pause for just a second because I'm getting some feedback that it's a little small hard to see see if we can make this better command plus Lizzie can you get that improve things quite a bit for everybody and see about our cursor here okay I think that we've had that yeah show cursor okay so we should be all set great sorry no problem okay so we will walk through the structure of our lesson plans um all of the codable lesson plans that are aligned with our game levels follow the idea we do you do structure and a little bit we're going to introduce our lesson Library which is more flexible um there are many lessons there are more free form openended there's a lot of resources that are not following this structure but for our lessons that are aligned with our standards and our game they do follow this so for direct instruction this is where you'll introduce the programming Concepts including all the vocabulary and this is usually about 10 to 15 minutes long after direct instruction you'll move into a guided practice activity um this is either whole group or in pairs and usually has some materials like I said they're all included here um students will be working collaboratively and applying the concept off screen before they work on screen so so after the guided practice activity which is about 20 minutes students will move into the independent practice portions this is where they'll apply the concept completely independently this is in the game so students will get on the app or play at game.codable.com and use that class code up here this is our class code students will log in with that class code and choose their name from the class list to play and do their independent practice and every quotable lesson ends with an exit ticket or some kind of informal assessment you can also assign practice levels at the bottom of each lesson plan all right I'm going to try our cursor one more time guys I've got all the settings clicked so I'm not really sure what's going on okay I want to see that you can just click on that um okay so we're gonna just voice out what we're what we're clicking on I don't know okay for anybody who is considering the wirecast play streaming service through uh YouTube not going to give it five stars um so yeah so we have our it's supposed to be showing our cursor but it's not showing up so we'll have to do some troubleshooting we want to use this again but for now we're just gonna say like what button we're clicking on um and when we highlight it it should change color do some sort of action um Bree if you're pointing to actual text like it shouldn't highlight it for them that should help sure okay we're actually coming off of this lesson plan to the top of your page so you'll see it should have just highlighted orange my classes lesson Library students progress and admin so we're just going to talk a little bit about some of the tabs that you see at the top um and what they do before we get into the lesson Library which we're super excited to talk about um actually we had a question from Maureen she asked um can you share students with another teacher and so actually Maureen uh right now that's just it's a codable school feature so um if you're a paid user of codable then you have the option to create admins and they can actually see you know all of the students and teachers within your school and set up classes for people and monitor student progress and all kinds of things like that from an admin level but uh on the free version it's not an option to link accounts and share classes with other teachers so we do have that option it's just part of our paid program cool so my classes is where we started and this is where you'll do anything to manage your classes so you'll see we have a list of classes um I know you cannot see my cursor so I'm hovering over the class names here and I'm going to click under first grade on grade one just to show you an example and this should look familiar because we saw this when we created our first class I just want to show you how you can manage by clicking manage class this is where you can add students this green add students button transfer class roster if you want to switch this class roster to another class so maybe you had a second grade class and they went to third grade and you want to move your first grade class now into second grade you could do that by clicking transfer class and selecting where you'd like to move it um we're not going to do that right now and here this purple print parent instructions button will download a handout for you to send home um with a student code for each student they can log in and practice at home if you want to make any changes to the class if you look on the right side of this page you'll see edit class class name you can change it anytime class code say you think you know I 6 k v m ZN is too hard to remember you could change it there if a new teacher is taking over the class you could change the teacher here again this is part of the admin feature so say I was an admin at my school and right now I have it assigned to me but I want to make sure that um Miss eatsam has has access to her class I could just change it to her um and change the teacher and then she could now access this from her teacher dashboard and view all of the students and all the student progress and manage her class from there so it's really nice if you're setting up classes for other teachers in your organization to have that feature available to you and again with this grade level option down here if you change the grade level it will change the pacing so your your students will have access you and your students will have access to different material depending on what grade level you choose and I know we mentioned before about assigning all practice levels at once this orange button and on assigning practice levels and that's where you can manage if your students have you know a freeforall situation where they can just kind of play through you'd want to assign all but again if you want to assign from the lesson plan like we just talked about you would want to do that manually so we are going to go back up to the top of the page and we're going to click on students should highlight Orange this is where you'll see all students that you have listed um you can filter by class to search for a student you can just type a student into the search you can transfer students you can delete students you can create new students by clicking the green create new student button and adding them to a class of your choice you can print parent instructions or you can import an existing student so if you have a student that already has an account you would click import student and enter their code and name and select a class to add them to here we have the progress bar at the top this orange progress button when we click here this loads the progress for all of your classes so if you want to look at a class progress um just per class you would click this middle class progress view button and you can select a class from your list so let's see who might have progress here we'll look at hour of code and we can see how far we are through the lesson plans how many programs have been written so that's how many levels students have played through and how students are progressing through each unit all right so now we are going to go to back to the top and go to lesson Library please ready in the past few weeks for back to school so we're super excited about this um so the lesson library is great because as the curriculum developer here it gives us the freedom to collaborate with other teachers and to write coding lessons that include content areas that are not something that we've we have in our full curriculum so now we have lessons that include math Ela we have a robotics unit and we have the freedom really to create coding lessons out of any discipline so we are going to start by looking on the left hand side under filters this is kind of a way for you to search as though you're shopping so if you're online shopping and you know what you're looking for you typically use a filter right you're not going to search for shoes if you're looking for shirts so this can really help you narrow down your search we have a lot of lessons and we're going to be adding more um super excited that teachers can also submit their own lessons so if you have your own I'll show you how to do that um but just for this purpose I really want to show you our new robotics unit so I'm going to go to content area robotics and you'll see that it loads our new robotics units so we're super excited that we partnered with Wonder workshop and I'm sure you're all fans of Dash and dots yes Dash and Dot are now part of the codable family so I will click on our first one just to give you guys a little Snippets so what's great about the lesson library is you can save these lessons so you'll browse like a catalog it's not going to show up on your dashboard these lessons unless you explicitly search or save them um and you can add them to what you already have via our pacing so if you've created a second grade class and you're on second grade pasting you definitely have those lessons saved but if you want to teach a robotics unit you can add that to what you already have so by clicking save this lesson I can then choose a class to save it too I'm going to save this to our webinar class and you'll see that it highlights and hovers when you hover it it'll highlight and you can save and now this lesson is saved to our class so we can add any kind of coding lesson we want or we can just stick to the codable curriculum um I'm going to go back to the lesson library though and show you so this Banner at the top is our featured unit obviously it's back to school so we're featuring back to school lessons and I want to show these two because there's a good example of um coding lessons that you can teach unplugged your first couple weeks of school so the new lesson in the lesson Library um are not linked to game content so these are the idea of the lesson libraries for coding to be taught every day um and you can do that in a variety of ways and that's what we're trying to to do we're trying to spread awareness that coding is everywhere and also that you know you can integrate coding into what you're already doing so we're going to take a look at our first back to school lesson so this is a kindergarten lesson but so I'm going to interrupt you for sure we had a question about the lesson Library Maureen was asking if this is premium only or can anybody access it so it's free to everybody to use um you'll see in I'm gonna just go back to it for just a second um you'll see so lessons that are free to use have no icon special icon on them um but if I was to click on third grade um you'll see some have codable school so those are our paid lessons those are part of our paid curriculum so anything that doesn't have that icon you can use completely free um and add it to any of your classes which is awesome okay so we'll go back to this it's a kindergarten lesson um just because of the activity that we chose but you can use this as a template um and you can really run with it and use your own classroom procedures to teach coding in the same way so I'm going to save this lesson to a Kindergarten class because I want to use it for kindergarten so that will be added to that kindergarten class so in this lesson students will be able to follow a sequence of steps related to classroom procedures and programming so this lesson introduces the concept of sequence and following steps and breaking tasks down into steps um and we used hand washing as an example but I'm sure that you can think of 100 classroom procedures that you can break down and train students to follow in a sequence and relate to programming so in this particular lesson students are following a sequence of steps they're using those sight words first next then and last and they're practicing a classroom procedure that will be used every day in their classroom um and the materials that go with it just like our other lessons are available for download as well do we have a question uh nope that's great I think we're good so you guys can feel free to oh we do have a question uh can you say the lesson to multiple classes you can yeah so say um actually you can see Pinterest too yeah so uh Brie was saving this to Blue uh to test but actually I had already saved it to my blue class so you can see you can remove it from here as well um so if I wanted to assign it to all of my kindergarten classes say I would just hover over the next generation and save it to them and so it's actually saved to all of my kindergarten classes so I can be sure to go over coding and classroom procedures with all of my Kinders so yes great so we're going to get into talking about the game and some updates we've made over the summer to the game but before we do that I just want to note that the codable lessons um that exist on your dashboard already as part of our curriculum you can assign or you can pin and save them but um those are linked to game content other lessons in the lesson Library are not so I got a question this week from a teacher who was wondering where the online content was for some of these lesson Library lessons and there's actually not game content so it's just important to note that if you don't see it listed in the lesson plan it does not go with um specific game content although you can have obviously your students practice sequence after they do you know this hand watching lesson because that makes sense but it's just not explicitly going to say do this lesson online so we are going to move into the game I just want to make sure I didn't miss anything sure uh we also have a question from mum bugs who asks if um we should so she has some students who have never been doing any coding before um she didn't say what grade they're in but uh she said should they start at a kindergarten level and that's a great question and something we get a lot um so actually I'll share our our recommended pacing for your first year of coding uh in the chat but we recommend that everyone start at the kindergarten level if you have not done any coding before and you're just your older students are just going to move at a little bit of an accelerated pace so they may not need to spend nearly as long learning about sequence as your kindergarteners would however it is important just like you know if you were learning to read for the first time in fifth grade you would still need to learn your ABCs you would need to learn about sentence structure and about um the sounds of words and everything like that so um it's the same thing for coding we need everybody to start from the beginning so yes I would suggest a kindergarten and starting with the kindergarten content but if you assign a fifth grade class um encodable it will automatically put them on that year one pacing and then it'll just Mark things off as you go through codable um So eventually they'll get up to the fifth grade content so yeah thanks for the question great so we are going to move to the game content so if you have students um working in the app on an iPad uh make sure that you update your apps because we've made a lot of changes and we want you to have access to all the awesome news stuff in our latest release so update your apps on your iPads um and if you are playing on the web again it's game.codile.com so you can access um the onscreen lessons either way so we're going to enter our class code um use a different great and one recommendation that I do have which is also a video resource we'll be sharing as a teaching tip is to make yourself a teacher profile so I'm on a teacher profile right now and what that means is every lesson is unlocked already so if I want to help a student who's in Australia I don't have to play all the way through planet smeeborg to be able to help them with the level that they're on so I can see what they have access to and um yeah I can hop around and Skip around levels and work with students and it's just super important for teachers to be able to see exactly what it is that students are working on um no matter what level they're at so I'm going to navigate us over here to our awesome fuzz in his spaceship or her I'm not sure in their spaceship and we are going to explore our new ship control panel actually first do you mind if we go through um like just one level of sequence but sure people can see yeah uh just to kind of get everybody familiar with what codable looks like if you're just starting out with your students say this is your first year teaching you just taught your first lesson on whether it's hand washing sequence um the fuzz family frenzy whatever it may be and your students are just getting started in the game um when they first log in they can click play and it'll take them automatically to the levels that have been assigned to them um you can also take them to the very first level of sequence um and that's where they will be starting and so what we have them starting out with is just very simple you know putting arrows in the correct order to get their fuzz through the Maze and we work them all the way up from this to writing in JavaScript in fifth grade so going over object oriented programming with actual syntax and instantiating objects and all kinds of crazy things and all of your teacher materials will actually explain those Concepts to you before you go in to teach your first class um but yeah so if you're following the codable track as as far as that pacing guide that I just sent goes students will start here in a very simple maze but then it quickly gets diffic more and more difficult and working them up to JavaScript so but we actually have been hard at work adding some creative content which is what breed's going to take over talking about for those who are new um so we're going to go back to our new openended creative content so we added two new um I guess features here um we have this I'm hovering over I don't think you can see my arrow in the middle this maze is build your own maze called our maze maker and then this green pick a fuzz you can build your own fuzz we're going to start with maze maker um so we I would recommend using the maze maker for K through two students and build your own fuzz for upper grade students that being said what what Gretchen just mentioned about you know if upper grade students don't have coding experience then in this case I would say maze maker so this is more for beginner coders um who have not had experience yet with sequence or conditions or loops and functions because that is what they'll be doing in maze maker build your own fuzz has a lot of JavaScript syntax we talk about variables and properties and um that's much more advanced and I need this Foundation First so that should be kept in mind with our creative content um I'm gonna pause for one second we've got quite a few questions sure uh Maureen asks do you find that kids need a refresher to get back up to speed or can they easily pick up where they left off if you're coming in for the new year um and say they haven't been doing any coding over the summer I would suggest maybe one or two lessons of refresher um if you look at the different grades for beyond your first year in that pacing guide that I showed you you can tell it's sort of stacked um and scaffolded so there's about um maybe like a half a unit of review on the last concept that they learned in the school year the year before um but I think you'll find that students pick it up pretty quickly um after some light Refresher um and then we have a question from Carla who oh sorry Tracy is 7.3.5 the most recent version um I am not certain about that actually I will double check for you Tracy uh and I'll post it in the chat um Carla asks do your students have to say when they exit the game or does it save for them uh so it saves for them so if you're using the web version and you just have them exit it will save um and then whenever they come back using their class code um it'll have all of their progress saved the same with the app so if you're using codable on the iPad you it'll save all of their progress locally on the device and then when that device is connected to the internet it'll send it to us and then anytime they log in with their class code their progress would be saved so yes we save automatically any other questions before we we have a question from 777 a a n g and they ask how do you update the app in iPads so um if you're using configurator for your school um your it person will probably be able to set that up for you it's a way to like Mass update all of your iPads otherwise if you go to the App Store you should be able to see your updates there it'll tell you how many updates you have and if it doesn't say that there's an update available for codable then you're on the latest version great all right so we're going to get back to maze maker um again it's it's best for beginners who are looking to build that foundation and it's awesome for assessment so if you want to test what your students can do this is a great way to have them build their own problems and solve their own problems so it's almost like they're working backwards and we'll get into that um it's also super fun and Visually appealing so that's another added bonus we're going to pick an awesome binary code background kids love also creating mazes and challenging one another we had some kids in the office who were having a blast making Unstoppable mazes for each other and so just like our curriculum is scaffolded um students will not be able to add loops and functions until they're there in the game so this will unlock the maze maker um let's start I'm looking for elements will unlock as they move through right so we're going to start by dragging some tiles I'm not really thinking this out which I don't recommend because students should be thinking critically and planning it um this is just going to be a simple example and then I can add awesome decoration um as I please and then I can lay out the star path so the stars mean the maze has to be solved um correctly oops so if I were to place a star in a more complex puzzle um that wasn't the best way to solve the maze then all three stars would not be earned which means I didn't solve this puzzle most efficiently this is a basic puzzle though this up here this pink button I don't think you can see me hovering over it at click on it is the Eraser um just in case you need to erase so once we build our maze I'm going to add one condition tile s we can test so we need to go right down so you can see this is sort of similar to uh the game that I was showing you earlier if you're new to codable um this is sort of just a play on our classic amazing maze puzzle game um and in this particular maze that Bree's created we're learning all about sequins and a little bit about conditions so here there's a pink condition tile so what this means is if I hit a pink tile then I go right so I have to put our condition down and then the arrow on top and now we'll test our names to do that all right and so we created and solved a maze and so I'm gonna go back just for time's sake and see if there are any questions about maze knicker before we move on to building our own fuzz um or nope Let's see we have a question from Jane Malone Miller are the lessons with bebot or blue bot robots they are with Dash and Dot robot uh which are from Wonder Workshop uh and but but the way that Bree wrote them uh was intended for them to be easily adaptable to whatever robots you have in your classroom so they were specifically designed for Dash and Dot but say you have bbots um or some other robot in your classroom say a Sphero or something I think you could easily adapt it um to solve the same yeah it would take a little um work to adapt it a little bit of time just because the Wonder Workshop app and robots are used and um they're going to be different from vbots and things like that but the actual content um and teaching is totally applicable to any robot so the activities use those robots um that might be where you need to switch it up a little but the actual instruction I think will will apply all right so we are going to one more question from Tracy Williams do you recommend starting over each year my first grade students moved really quickly last year and most have done all of smeborg and Astoria I don't feel like they are ready for bug world um yes first graders I don't recommend putting into bug world uh unless you have one who one or two in your class you feel are like totally ready for that it is definitely a fifth grade concept especially if you're not teaching the content like if you're not planning on using the lessons and you just want them going through the game it is not recommended it is it's pretty complicated stuff I mean they're doing they're writing JavaScript so I would say um holding off on that until they're in third fourth or fifth grade um it's definitely an upper elementary uh type of content you're actually going to see it a little bit here with our with our fuzz uh Creator some of the some of the JavaScript that we use in codable so when we hit build here this is directly related to bug world so this is Javascript um classes and objects and properties are all JavaScript and part of object oriented programming so we're going to name our class and this is exactly how you would do this in JavaScript we're going to name this webinar class when we click this check mark this is Javascript syntax so okay so what we're doing is we are creating um our fuzz so to but to get started making our fuzz we need to construct our fuzz so you can see our Constructor here um we're gonna add a body to our fuzz and we can actually modify this property which is another concept that we cover in bug world um so we're going to say this is our body and the body property is Pink um so then we need to add eyes so the eyes property for our webinar fuzz are going to be green Gray and we have to add a mouth so the mouth property for this Buzz right now is going to be cheese those are values yeah um so yeah the property value for this is going to be cheese um so then we have a function for getting dressed so what we do is we would add mohawk and let's add some glasses party glasses so our webinar fuzz is ready to party and all of these Concepts that you see here in this JavaScript are part of bug world and they are all covered in the lesson plans on objectoriented programming and JavaScript you can access all of the information from your teacher dashboard and your teacher materials cover all of these things that I just mentioned like um classes and objects and values and properties everything that we said here functions they're all covered in that content so um you can feel totally prepared when you're explaining it to your students what exactly is going on here and I guess I would use this opportunity to stress the importance of actually teaching unplugged before getting students onto this so I would not have students I wouldn't even show them the openended content until they've learned what they're doing um because this can be fun and great and it looks pretty and kids love it but if they don't know what it is and what they're doing then it really does lose its value so I would hold off on introducing this until you've taught these Concepts to your students unless you're taking you know just an explore to Learn Type approach but then again coming back to the lessons after they've explored it is really important so that they have the vocabulary to talk about and articulate what they're what they're doing to have questions um it looks like John is in the process of answering some questions um let's see here I don't think I see any questions that haven't been answered so okay um let's see here game updates so the last thing that we want to cover um to our faces hi so um the last thing that we want to say is that we have tons and tons of resources available for you all we spent the summer uh kind of going through everything and making sure that it's easily accessible from a few different locations um as well as making sure that it's updated and ready to go for the new year so um a great place to go for uh information and articles about everything that we've covered here actually is our help center and you can access that from support.codable.com uh Bree and I and John all write articles there um whenever we feel like there's something that we've been answering a lot of questions to we'll put in there also if we have new features that we want to make sure everyone understands we'll put articles there another great resource is our blog uh so that's blog.codehole.com I know we have really creative URLs and you can find helpful articles there as well as updates on codable and what we're doing and what we're working on right now we have a contest going for the year of code you can tell us your coding challenge for yourself for the year and we'll check in with people randomly throughout the year and if you're on track then you can win prizes for your class so um that's a good place to stay tuned to like know what's going on with codable um what our updates are and things like that um the last place that I would suggest uh checking if you have questions about codable is um YouTube we do a lot of tutorials and tips as well as like product tours and things like that on our YouTube channel you're probably on it right now watching this so you're familiar with it but but yeah I would definitely suggest poking around some of our videos we have videos for every single concept that we teach in codable including sequence conditions but also covering classes and variables and properties so um all of these things that we've mentioned are covered in a multitude of places um we did have one question about coding terms and simplifying definitions for kids and you were just mentioning some of our resources and I think our teacher overviews have videos and they're actually meant for adults or for teachers they're not the most kidfriendly they're just not that fun I guess but um I think there are a lot of visuals in those videos that may be helpful for kids to understand especially conditions and I would I would definitely recommend checking out our back to school lessons we have the lesson on conditions and conditional statements that really relates these programming terms to real life and I think that's the best way to help kids understand programming definitions is to to talk about them in ways that relate to things around them and that's what we try to do in some of our teacher materials and those videos so you may find that helpful is this the question you're in yeah yeah awesome I was just reading through the chat yeah okay um does anybody else have any questions for us I know we've gone through a lot tonight um but I want to make sure to answer any questions that may have come up we've we've tried pretty hard to answer as they've been coming but we'll wait a couple minutes to see if there's any more and while we're waiting actually I did also want to show if you have one question uh Tracy asks do you think you will be adding more levels to the paid version just more of the same concept uh we are planning to add more to bug world um and we are um focusing the rest of the year on Creative content so we've had a lot of feedback from people saying that they love that our linear uh our linear game content but that they're wanting more free openended content to let kids kind of practice the concepts that they've been learning um so we're really focusing on that for the next year but there will be more bug world content coming hopefully soon okay we'll wait a couple more minutes if there's any other questions and Bree wanted to show I just wanted to show if you have a great idea for teaching a certain concept or including coding in anything um you can submit a lesson I just want to show you where to do that so this orange submit my lesson button will just bring you to a Google form where you can tell us a little bit about your lesson and uh whatever you can fill in if we can create a lesson out of that even if you just have an idea fantastic we want to hear you know any ideas or even if you have full lessons we'd love you to submit them so that we can add them to our awesome lesson library and share it with your friends okay so I've got a couple questions here um Maureen asks do you find that the fifth graders pick up the syntax quickly uh drives me crazy is there a way that syntax errors are highlighted so uh the way that our syntax works is it types out most of it for them so we remove some of the frustration of like oh I've missed a semicolon or I missed a period or I have I'm missing a character um so that they can really just select the value that they want from a drop down so they'll see all of the syntax uh they just won't actually have to type it which is really nice for students who are still learning their typing skills um so syntax errors kind of eliminated from the whole thing which is really nice um and if you're going over the vocabulary with them you should find uh that they start to pick up the syntax pretty well because that's all covered in the lessons um so you'll be talking about it together in class and I think like most of our material is pretty scaffolded we don't just throw them into the syntax they're seeing it first before they're manipulating it and then eventually they'll be writing it but it's pretty gradual and yeah it builds on itself Tracy Williams asks can you lock the creative fuzz part of ship control panel uh no you can't right now but that is something we have Free's been advocating for since the moment we created I taught kindergarten in first grade so I am I'm saying we should lock it yeah and I have a feeling with the start of the school year we'll start getting more and more requests for that so um hopefully soon we'll be able to add that for you guys um Stacy blauer asks do you think there are enough lessons for an entire year with the free option uh so there are about 12 lessons uh 12 weeks of lessons and that really depends on how in depth you want to go with coding in the library and in the library the library is more like supplemental things or if they're special occasions mini lessons things like that I think we have an Earth Day lesson in there um but yeah it really depends on how in depth you want to go if you guys are just exploring and you're figuring out this whole coding thing and you're just getting started absolutely like figure out if codable is the right thing for you figure out if it's something you want to continue teaching with um but if you're ready to sort of go in depth with your students and you really want them prepared at the end of um Elementary School to be writing apps and games and and websites and creating things in Middle School uh then I would say it'd be worth exploring the the paid content because we have now over 70 weeks of of lessons you can really have a whole Year's worth of content um to teach your students and make sure that they're prepared for middle school so if that's something you're interested in you can always reach out to either me or Bree um or support codable.com and we can set up a quick chat with you get it getting to know sort of your coding goals we're trying to achieve in your school um and really get to know like yours you know your special situation and make a recommendation on what plan would be right for you um go over some of our pricing options and cover all that you would get with the school plan um so Kate molito asks I know each great each new grade level starts with a review from last year that does this reset student progress or will it show will it show those I think Kate what you're asking is um does it reset student progress if you do those reviews um it will not delete their previous attempts on in the game um it will just add more attempts to that progress so it'll say last attempted and it'll say they've attempted it you know five times however many times they've completed it and it'll show their highest score on that level so say they reviewed it and they did better than they did last year it'll show that high score um Tracy Williams asks can teachers make their own maze in the village of Maze and share it with students uh we yes you can absolutely create your own maze we are working on adding a sharing feature actually that's next on our agenda for the year so hopefully sometime in September or October that will be released to you guys um to start sharing it'll be between classes like sorry within within classes so students in your class will have access to mazes that were created by students in your class or by you um and not like with the world um Jesus saves me through and through asks how to record students progress if they are doing it manually as they do not yet have tablets that's a great question actually um we don't have any way of recording it is really nice a coding portfolio of all of their work which is really nice for them to take home at the end of the school year and sort of show their parents the other thing that's really important is parent interact engagement um parents just love seeing what their kids are learning at school and the kids love showing them and kind of being the expert on this New Concept that they just learned so that's another great way um Android version so um I can't see your username but uh we had an Android version and unfortunately since we are such a small team I don't know if you all know but we're five people uh and so we were not able to support it and we didn't want to keep it out there with it being not a great experience we also didn't have a ton of people using Android devices in the classroom um and so unfortunately we had to pull it from the Google Play Store but it is something that we want to eventually put back out there once we're able to support it so hopefully soon bye comfortable school and we can hire more people um yeah I think that that is all of the questions um yeah awesome well thank you all so much for joining us thank you for sticking with us through technical support at the beginning again if you're planning on using wirecast play maybe not um but anyway so have a really great start to your school year and feel free to reach out to us anytime support.codable.com um and we'll be happy to answer your questions yeah all right thank you back to school yay see ya thank you
