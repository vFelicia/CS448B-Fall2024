00:00 - on a computer you can do all sorts of
00:02 - things play games do your homework watch
00:08 - videos all of these things are done
00:11 - using computer programs a computer
00:15 - program is a set of instructions that a
00:18 - computer follows to complete a task you
00:22 - can see computer programs and action all
00:24 - around you they control things like cell
00:27 - phones coffee makers cars microwaves
00:30 - washing machines gaming consoles if we
00:35 - didn't have computer programs these
00:37 - things that we use every day would not
00:39 - be the same most of them wouldn't even
00:43 - exist so computer programs are important
00:55 - and help control a lot of the devices
00:57 - and machines that we use every day but
01:01 - what are these programs made from
01:03 - computer programs are made out of their
01:06 - own special computer language called
01:08 - code a computer can't think for itself
01:15 - and you can't talk to it like a person
01:21 - this is because computers don't
01:24 - understand the same language that you
01:26 - speak computers only understand code if
01:29 - we want a computer to do something like
01:32 - make a game you can't just tell it to
01:36 - you need to give the computer
01:38 - step-by-step instructions for how to
01:40 - make the game in a language it
01:42 - understands code computers need code to
01:46 - do pretty much anything computer code is
01:51 - usually made out of words and numbers
01:53 - like this programmers like you are
01:58 - people who learn how to put these words
02:00 - and numbers in order so your computer
02:02 - can follow your instructions and know
02:04 - what to do
02:06 - Ince me Borg your fuzz character acts
02:09 - just like a computer
02:11 - your fuzz can't think for itself and
02:13 - needs a programmer like you to tell it
02:16 - what to do whatever commands you choose
02:21 - to write in your program your fuzz will
02:24 - follow them exactly from the first
02:28 - command to the last one as the
02:33 - programmer you will decide what
02:35 - instructions to give your fuzz so it
02:37 - knows where to roll and how to move
02:40 - let's get coding

on a computer you can do all sorts of things play games do your homework watch videos all of these things are done using computer programs a computer program is a set of instructions that a computer follows to complete a task you can see computer programs and action all around you they control things like cell phones coffee makers cars microwaves washing machines gaming consoles if we didn't have computer programs these things that we use every day would not be the same most of them wouldn't even exist so computer programs are important and help control a lot of the devices and machines that we use every day but what are these programs made from computer programs are made out of their own special computer language called code a computer can't think for itself and you can't talk to it like a person this is because computers don't understand the same language that you speak computers only understand code if we want a computer to do something like make a game you can't just tell it to you need to give the computer stepbystep instructions for how to make the game in a language it understands code computers need code to do pretty much anything computer code is usually made out of words and numbers like this programmers like you are people who learn how to put these words and numbers in order so your computer can follow your instructions and know what to do Ince me Borg your fuzz character acts just like a computer your fuzz can't think for itself and needs a programmer like you to tell it what to do whatever commands you choose to write in your program your fuzz will follow them exactly from the first command to the last one as the programmer you will decide what instructions to give your fuzz so it knows where to roll and how to move let's get coding
