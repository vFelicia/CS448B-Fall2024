00:02 - hi everyone
00:04 - happy hour of code my name is gretchen
00:06 - hebner
00:07 - and this is hannah boston uh we're two
00:10 - members of the codable team uh and we
00:13 - are so excited
00:15 - to bring you the hour of code webinar
00:18 - we're going to go over all the things
00:20 - that you i'm sorry
00:23 - we're going to go over all the things
00:25 - that you need to do
00:27 - to prepare for the hour of code this
00:29 - year um
00:30 - so i am one of the founders of codable
00:34 - uh this is my i guess
00:38 - seventh hour of code hooray yay uh
00:41 - hannah is uh newer to the codable team
00:45 - than seven years ago but she's not she
00:47 - is a veteran
00:48 - hour of coder um hannah do you want to
00:51 - introduce yourself a little bit tell us
00:52 - a little bit about what you do at
00:53 - codable
00:54 - sure so i am the instructional designer
00:56 - and coach at codable so my
00:58 - main role is supporting you guys the
01:00 - teachers
01:01 - creating teacher guides videos anything
01:03 - that you need to
01:04 - do to feel confident teaching coding
01:06 - with your elementary students
01:08 - and lately i've been making a lot of our
01:10 - student facing videos
01:12 - so the videos you might watch to prep
01:14 - for the hour of code
01:15 - i helped to create those so if you guys
01:17 - have any questions
01:19 - recommendations for future videos lesson
01:21 - plans worksheets anything like that
01:23 - that's what i'm working on so yeah i'm
01:25 - really excited for the hour of code this
01:26 - year it's going to be a good one
01:28 - yeah yeah it's going to be great even
01:30 - though it might be a little bit
01:31 - different
01:32 - a lot of you submitted questions asking
01:34 - about
01:36 - how to participate in the hour of code
01:38 - virtually or in a hybrid model
01:40 - because things are wild right now
01:43 - everybody is in a different situation so
01:45 - we're going to talk a lot about ways
01:48 - that you can do
01:49 - the hour of code virtually with your
01:50 - students or practicing social distancing
01:53 - uh and what have you uh so with that i'm
01:56 - gonna hop
01:56 - into the agenda just tell you guys a
01:58 - little bit about what we're gonna cover
01:59 - today so
02:00 - first and foremost we're gonna start off
02:02 - strong talking about how to do the hour
02:04 - of code during a pandemic
02:06 - um and we'll get into how to prepare
02:10 - uh and this is the same whether you are
02:12 - in person
02:13 - or uh teaching virtually what you need
02:16 - to do to prepare
02:17 - uh to teach with your students um what
02:20 - will students be doing so we'll go over
02:21 - some of the
02:22 - tutorials we'll go over how to log them
02:24 - in uh or how to tell them to log in if
02:27 - they're
02:27 - doing that from home uh then we'll talk
02:30 - a little bit about how to recognize
02:32 - their achievements some of the different
02:33 - things that you can see on your teacher
02:35 - dashboard
02:36 - after the hour of code is completed and
02:39 - how you can recognize them uh we'll go
02:42 - over some
02:43 - more of our virtual learning tools and
02:45 - these aren't specific to the hour of
02:47 - code these are
02:48 - just tools that you can use uh you know
02:51 - to use codeable but they are
02:52 - very helpful for the hour of code so we
02:55 - went over them a little bit in our back
02:56 - to school webinar if any of you
02:58 - were at that um but we wanted to be sure
03:02 - to mention all of them here again today
03:05 - and then we have
03:06 - a set of we have set aside some time at
03:09 - the end of the
03:10 - webinar for uh questions and answers
03:13 - some of you guys posted questions
03:15 - but we will also be taking questions
03:17 - from the audience so there's a little
03:18 - chat window
03:19 - over on the right hand side of the video
03:22 - and you can post your questions there
03:24 - brie gray is our um
03:28 - director of customer success she is
03:29 - hanging out in the
03:31 - chat answering all of your questions she
03:33 - is the best person to answer questions
03:36 - uh so she will get to them as quickly as
03:39 - she can if she doesn't get to it we'll
03:40 - talk about it on air
03:42 - um and there there's also an agenda
03:45 - floating around we sent it in the email
03:49 - and there's just helpful
03:52 - resources in there everything that we
03:54 - post and talk about today is covered in
03:56 - that agenda so
03:58 - um if you are like oh no i need that
04:00 - link you can go to the agenda and find
04:02 - the link so
04:03 - uh but we'll also post some links in the
04:05 - chat all right
04:06 - with that i'm going to hop into
04:10 - um what to do
04:13 - during the hour of code during pandemic
04:17 - okay so um the hour of code is a magical
04:22 - moment in every year uh where we talk
04:25 - about
04:26 - the importance of learning to code we
04:28 - introduce what coding is to our students
04:30 - and it's a worldwide event organized by
04:32 - code.org to
04:34 - um just get kids to try one hour of
04:36 - coding
04:37 - and there's no reason that we can't do
04:39 - this
04:41 - we fully believe in you guys and we've
04:43 - done everything we can to to prepare
04:45 - resources for you to do this virtually
04:46 - if that's what's happening in your
04:48 - school so
04:49 - um you do not need to know how to code
04:52 - to teach an hour of code your students
04:55 - do not need to have any previous coding
04:57 - experience
04:58 - it is designed to be a beginner
05:01 - experience so if this is your first hour
05:03 - of code we've got you
05:05 - you're going to come out of this
05:06 - prepared and if it's your fifth or
05:08 - seventh like me uh welcome back we're so
05:11 - glad to have you so
05:12 - um i will
05:16 - i think that's everything oh i did want
05:18 - to make sure to mention that
05:20 - um the hour of code is an event to
05:24 - honor grace hopper who is a
05:28 - awesome woman and she was an early
05:30 - pioneer in computer science she created
05:32 - the first compiler
05:33 - and every year the hour code is a week
05:36 - long celebration to
05:38 - celebrate her birthday she was born on
05:40 - december 7th and
05:42 - she was an admiral in the u.s navy and
05:44 - she created the first compiler she's
05:46 - also
05:46 - famous for coining the phrase bug
05:49 - because she found a moth
05:50 - in the room sized computer that she was
05:55 - working on
05:55 - uh and it was causing the computer not
05:58 - to work so
05:58 - that's where the phrase bug came from
06:00 - it's from an actual
06:02 - bug it was a moth stuck in a computer um
06:07 - so with that i think we are ready to
06:10 - move on
06:10 - to how to prepare um so hannah
06:13 - is going to take you through all of the
06:16 - resources that you
06:17 - can look through to prepare to teach the
06:19 - hour code with your students
06:21 - um and she's going to go over some of
06:22 - the activities and then i'm going to
06:24 - talk about setup so hannah thank you
06:27 - gretchen
06:28 - so yes i'm going to talk about how to
06:30 - prepare
06:31 - the first thing you can do to prepare is
06:34 - log into your teacher dashboard
06:36 - and we have created a brand new tab on
06:40 - the teacher dashboard
06:41 - titled hour of code that has all the
06:44 - resources you could possibly need
06:46 - to prep for the hour of code and teach
06:49 - it to your students
06:50 - so this is the hour of code tab it's
06:53 - right at the top of your teacher
06:54 - dashboard
06:55 - and it's bolded so you can't miss it and
06:58 - you'll see the first thing at the top is
07:00 - the how to
07:02 - hour of code with codable video
07:04 - everything that i'm about to mention
07:06 - is summarized in a short four minute
07:08 - video right here at the top of your hour
07:10 - of code page so if
07:11 - you feel like i'm moving too fast or you
07:13 - just want to review
07:14 - the steps that i'm talking about here to
07:16 - prepare i definitely recommend you
07:18 - log into your dashboard view this hour
07:21 - of code page and check out the video
07:22 - it'll be super helpful for you
07:24 - so the first step to prepare for the
07:26 - hour of code is going to be to decide
07:29 - where and how you will run the hour of
07:31 - code this means what devices your
07:34 - students will be using
07:35 - to do the hour of code activities the
07:38 - tutorials
07:39 - so this is going to look really
07:40 - different for all of us some of you
07:42 - might be face to face
07:43 - and have ipads or some sort of in-school
07:46 - device to use with your students
07:48 - other teachers might have students that
07:50 - are remote
07:52 - and maybe you don't know exactly what
07:53 - devices they're using
07:55 - we do have an ios app so any
07:58 - student with an ios device like an ipad
08:00 - or an iphone
08:01 - can participate in the hour of code and
08:03 - we also have all the hour of code
08:05 - activities available via the web
08:07 - so it doesn't totally matter what
08:10 - devices your students are using
08:12 - it'll just be helpful for you to plan
08:13 - ahead so you know
08:15 - how to help them for login and things
08:17 - like that but this year we're also
08:18 - really excited to
08:20 - share that we have a totally unplugged
08:23 - lesson for the hour of code
08:25 - that's just worksheets that students can
08:27 - complete
08:28 - so if your students do not have access
08:30 - to tech devices that is okay we got you
08:33 - covered
08:34 - and we have an unplugged activity for
08:35 - you this year
08:37 - so step one decide where and how the
08:40 - second
08:40 - step to prepare for the hour of code
08:42 - will be to
08:43 - choose a tutorial so on this hour of
08:46 - code page if you scroll down we have all
08:49 - of our tutorials or
08:51 - that's the hour of code speak for
08:52 - activity or project
08:54 - we have them all featured here at the
08:56 - bottom and we have
08:58 - five featured activities this year
09:01 - we have a bunch more i think there's 15
09:03 - plus
09:04 - activities you can choose from but these
09:05 - are the five that we
09:07 - that we recommend for beginner coders
09:09 - and beginner teachers
09:11 - they have the most supports with them so
09:13 - i'm going to
09:14 - walk through the different activities we
09:16 - have available to you
09:17 - but again i definitely recommend you
09:19 - explore the hour of code page yourself
09:21 - you might find another activity that
09:23 - you'd like to use with your students
09:25 - so the first activity that we have
09:27 - available is the
09:28 - intro to programming pre-readers welcome
09:31 - if you are new to codable or your
09:33 - students are younger
09:34 - we had a couple questions write in about
09:37 - what's the best activity for my
09:38 - kindergartners or my first graders
09:41 - we definitely recommend this intro to
09:43 - programming it'll introduce
09:44 - students to the coding basics like
09:47 - sequence conditions
09:48 - loops and functions and it's just an
09:51 - introduction to the codeable
09:53 - game so it'll give students four
09:55 - different games to choose from
09:57 - and they can work through the game
09:59 - levels they are self-guided self-paced
10:02 - so students can kind of control their
10:05 - learning experience with very minimal
10:08 - prep or instruction from you the teacher
10:11 - the second it's a great option for free
10:13 - play too if you're just wanting to have
10:15 - them
10:16 - do free play that's a great great job
10:18 - absolutely yeah because it's self
10:20 - exactly thanksgiving it's self-paced and
10:22 - so free play
10:23 - um would be an awesome option for that
10:25 - activity
10:26 - uh the second one that we have featured
10:28 - here is make your own codable mazes oh
10:30 - and i just wanted to point out
10:32 - we have all the grade recommendations
10:33 - listed below the activity as well
10:35 - um the second one is make your own
10:37 - codeable mazes so here students are
10:40 - guided through five different levels of
10:42 - codable and then they complete a maze
10:44 - building challenge
10:46 - that's aligned with common core math
10:48 - standards
10:49 - so in the game the students will choose
10:51 - their grade level and then the challenge
10:53 - that they are presented
10:54 - will be aligned with common core math
10:57 - for that grade level
10:58 - so that's a really great one if you're
11:00 - looking for a way to integrate coding
11:02 - into
11:02 - some of your other subjects like math
11:05 - this would be a great one for you
11:06 - plus as kids get to make their own mazes
11:09 - they can express their creativity
11:11 - and get artistic so that is a great
11:14 - option for you guys
11:15 - the third one here is beach cleanup if
11:18 - you
11:19 - did the hour of code with codable last
11:21 - year you'll know that beach cleanup was
11:22 - brand new
11:23 - last year this year we have it again and
11:25 - we've revamped it
11:26 - given it a little bit of a facelift and
11:29 - so this is an awesome option if you want
11:31 - to
11:31 - integrate with environmental science in
11:35 - this activity
11:36 - students learn to program using basic
11:39 - commands
11:40 - and clean up the fuzztopia beach to
11:42 - protect the
11:43 - ocean life the sea creatures so in this
11:46 - activity students will also be
11:48 - designing a maze that connects different
11:50 - pieces of
11:51 - trash and then they code their fuzz
11:54 - through the maze to collect
11:55 - the recycling and this one has three
11:58 - or four different tutorial videos
12:01 - available
12:02 - in the game itself so if you are looking
12:04 - for an activity that
12:05 - has more video support so you don't need
12:08 - to do the direct instruction
12:10 - the kids can click the video and watch
12:12 - it at their own
12:14 - pace at their own time the beach cleanup
12:16 - has those videos embedded in the game so
12:19 - super easy for them to review the
12:21 - concepts and learn as they go
12:23 - and the final one featured here on this
12:24 - page is the build your own
12:26 - fuzz this is an awesome activity if you
12:29 - want students to get creative and design
12:32 - and code their own fuzz character the
12:34 - fuzzes are the
12:35 - characters of codable so students will
12:38 - code
12:39 - and modify properties to bring their
12:41 - character to life
12:43 - and we do recommend here grades two
12:45 - through five
12:46 - because the activity features real
12:49 - javascript
12:49 - syntax so upper elementary students can
12:53 - often do a little bit of a better job
12:55 - making the connections between the
12:56 - javascript syntax and the properties
12:58 - that are shown
12:59 - on their fuzz but again all of these
13:01 - activities are great for
13:03 - all ages students will just modify them
13:05 - to
13:06 - to be appropriate if your kindergartners
13:08 - want to design a fuzz that is a-okay
13:11 - they might just not understand the
13:12 - javascript syntax but
13:14 - they'll still get to modify properties
13:17 - and get exposed to code in that way
13:19 - and finally i'll just click this view
13:21 - all button and scroll down a bit and
13:23 - you'll see the first activity
13:25 - underneath the four that are featured is
13:27 - our coding basics
13:28 - unplugged this activity is completely
13:31 - unplugged you'll have to print out
13:34 - worksheets for your students but after
13:36 - that they can use pen and paper
13:38 - and it's a lot of our coding puzzles
13:41 - just in
13:42 - an unplugged format so it's great if
13:44 - students again do not have access to
13:46 - tech devices or if you're just looking
13:48 - for another
13:49 - option if you want to combine unplugged
13:52 - and plugged in
13:53 - this is an option for you and then as
13:56 - you can see there's a bunch more to
13:58 - choose from
13:59 - that integrate into a lot of other
14:00 - subjects like robotics and english
14:02 - so you can take your pick all of these
14:04 - activities can be completed
14:06 - in an hour for the hour of code so
14:09 - they're all here available to you again
14:10 - on your dashboard
14:12 - at the hour of code tab and after you've
14:15 - picked your tutorial
14:16 - the third and final step to prepare is
14:19 - to
14:20 - spread the word so the hour of code as
14:22 - gretchen mentioned is a magical time
14:24 - it's really exciting and i know
14:26 - a lot of us could use a little bit of a
14:28 - boost this year right now
14:30 - so hype up the hour of code your
14:32 - students get to
14:34 - be really creative and it's very fun so
14:37 - get them excited
14:38 - and the other piece to spreading the
14:41 - word
14:41 - is to give them virtual participation
14:44 - instructions so we have that tab right
14:47 - here at the top
14:48 - you can download this participation
14:50 - guide it walks through
14:52 - all the steps students and or their
14:54 - families will need to follow
14:56 - to get logged in and coding so we wanted
14:59 - to make it as easy for you as possible
15:01 - if you send this home and students
15:02 - follow all the steps they should be able
15:04 - to log in to the hour of code
15:06 - and complete their activity so you can
15:08 - email those post it to a class page
15:10 - hand them out in person whatever works
15:13 - best for you but
15:14 - those participation instructions are
15:17 - right there so you can
15:18 - use them how you need and i think that
15:21 - covers
15:22 - all of the activities that we have
15:24 - available this year
15:25 - if you guys have any questions about
15:27 - this page please let us know and again i
15:29 - definitely recommend
15:30 - watching that how to hour of code with
15:32 - codable video
15:34 - it summarizes everything i just
15:35 - mentioned in a bit of a shorter package
15:39 - so with that said i'm going to pass it
15:41 - back off to gretchen to go over
15:44 - how to get students set up since now
15:46 - you've chosen your tutorial
15:48 - you can get the students set up and
15:49 - coding
15:53 - thank you hannah okay so uh i just want
15:56 - to
15:57 - quickly tell you all make sure that uh
15:59 - if you're playing in person
16:01 - if you're using school devices please
16:03 - make sure that you are updated to the
16:05 - latest version of codable so that you
16:06 - have access to
16:08 - the hour of code activities uh some of
16:10 - them have
16:11 - been updated uh and others you know
16:15 - if it's on an older version then it
16:17 - might not have the
16:18 - we have like a timed release for the
16:20 - activities so that they'll show up at a
16:22 - certain date so if it's an old version
16:23 - it might not
16:24 - have the newest activity so please be
16:26 - sure to update
16:27 - your devices if you're playing on the
16:29 - web um
16:30 - you can save the link to whatever
16:33 - activity you choose for your students
16:36 - and post that to your class page or send
16:39 - it home in an email just like hannah
16:41 - said
16:41 - and that will take students directly to
16:43 - the activity that they
16:46 - need to play so i'm just going to
16:48 - quickly walk you through
16:49 - what students are going to see and what
16:52 - they're going to do
16:53 - um so
16:58 - i actually have a question that i think
17:00 - i should probably address first so
17:02 - i have multiple classes with hundreds of
17:04 - students total
17:06 - how can i get the class code to all of
17:08 - my students in the easiest way
17:10 - so like hannah mentioned i think that
17:13 - there
17:14 - are great ways to send home the class
17:17 - code
17:17 - to students we have we're going to go
17:20 - over
17:20 - our all of our virtual learning tools at
17:23 - the end of this
17:25 - and there are three different ways that
17:26 - you can actually send home your class
17:28 - code
17:29 - one of them is with like a pdf that has
17:33 - um the class code on it and instructions
17:36 - on how to log into codable
17:37 - uh so that would be the probably my
17:40 - choice but then there's also like a
17:42 - spreadsheet you can use there's lots of
17:43 - different options so we'll go over oh
17:45 - go over that at the end um we also have
17:48 - ways to
17:49 - add students in bulk so if you're
17:51 - planning to
17:53 - use codeable with a lot of students and
17:54 - you haven't added them decodable yet
17:57 - you can learn more about how to add
17:59 - students in bulk by going to our support
18:01 - center
18:01 - at support codable.com and
18:04 - there you'll find instructions on how to
18:07 - add students
18:08 - in bulk many classes all at once we have
18:11 - google classroom integration clever
18:12 - integration
18:13 - and uh we have our own bulk importer if
18:16 - you're planning to do it that way
18:17 - so lots of options um
18:21 - okay so uh
18:25 - the last thing that i'll say before i
18:27 - show things is that we
18:28 - do encourage so quotable is accessible
18:31 - without a codeable
18:32 - account so if you are a teacher using
18:34 - codable for the very first time and you
18:36 - have you
18:37 - have not set up an account you do not
18:39 - have to have an account to use it
18:40 - um you can go to game.google.com
18:44 - hour code you can direct your students
18:46 - here and there's an option to
18:48 - play without saving um so i'm just going
18:50 - to show
18:52 - you how to do that um and that's here
18:57 - game.codable.com hour of code if you do
19:00 - have a codeable account you can also
19:02 - come here
19:03 - this thing's blocking it there you go
19:05 - you can see it's got a play without
19:06 - saving button
19:07 - and that's where students can go to play
19:10 - um but it will not save their progress
19:12 - it's a one-time use they can come back
19:16 - many times but every time it's going to
19:18 - start them from the beginning
19:19 - so if you're using codable and you don't
19:21 - want to set up classes that's a good way
19:23 - to do it
19:24 - however we do recommend setting up
19:26 - classes just because
19:27 - number one it's free you can use with as
19:29 - many students as you want
19:30 - um but number two you're going to have
19:33 - all of their progress saved you're going
19:34 - to be able to send home
19:35 - instructions you have access to all of
19:37 - these great resources that hannah has
19:39 - covered
19:40 - so i do recommend setting up a class or
19:43 - setting up an account and creating
19:44 - classes like i mentioned there's lots of
19:47 - ways you can add students in bulk
19:50 - okay with that i'm going to show you how
19:53 - students are going to log in
19:54 - so if you're playing on the web and you
19:57 - chose
19:58 - an activity um when you click on that
20:01 - activity you're going to get this little
20:02 - landing page
20:03 - this is the link that i would share with
20:04 - your students because they can just
20:06 - click this play online button
20:09 - and enter their class code
20:21 - and it's going to take them directly to
20:24 - the activity
20:25 - uh without needing to kind of search for
20:28 - it
20:28 - in the in the game
20:42 - all right here we are beach cleanup so
20:46 - i can just click on beach cleanup and
20:48 - start playing
20:49 - um we do have options
20:53 - for instructional videos along with this
20:56 - and they are accessible from that
20:58 - landing page
21:00 - and they're also available on our
21:01 - youtube channel which you are all on
21:03 - presently so you can find them there
21:06 - they're also available on your
21:07 - teacher dashboard on the videos page so
21:10 - um
21:11 - they're they're available in a lot of
21:12 - different places uh
21:14 - and they are also on the lesson plan so
21:17 - you
21:17 - you should have them um so what you
21:19 - would do in this activity
21:21 - click play choose your difficulty level
21:24 - and i'm just going to show you guys how
21:26 - to play
21:26 - uh beach cleanup just so that you
21:30 - are familiar with it because sometimes
21:33 - it can be a little tricky so
21:36 - what you do you want to connect all of
21:38 - these recycling
21:41 - bins or the recycling symbols
21:44 - and program your fuzz through the maze
21:46 - um so
21:47 - this is a really simple sequence level
21:50 - i'm gonna go
21:51 - forward down forward up
21:55 - forward back down
21:59 - and right to go out however it looks
22:01 - like we're going to need a condition
22:04 - i'm just going to add a condition here
22:06 - and we'll talk a little bit about what a
22:07 - condition is
22:08 - um but one thing to point out is that
22:12 - this path can be anything your students
22:14 - want it to be so it's a lot of
22:16 - creativity involved in this activity
22:19 - um you know students thinking about the
22:21 - best way to get through the maze
22:23 - if you want to encourage them not to use
22:25 - a condition
22:26 - um if they haven't learned what
22:27 - conditions are they can re
22:29 - re rearrange this maze uh to remove the
22:33 - condition
22:33 - so and then we have oh i forgot the
22:36 - videos are accessible
22:37 - here as well so here's how to play
22:41 - uh the easy version of codable um just
22:44 - click that little question mark and it's
22:46 - gonna
22:46 - have hannah walk them through how to
22:48 - play
22:50 - um so i'm gonna click play
23:14 - oh i did it just enough moves yes
23:18 - okay i'm gonna click test it and see
23:20 - what happens
23:22 - looks like i'm gonna make it to the end
23:31 - those little penguins are so cute
23:35 - okay so your students can choose to save
23:37 - the maze and that's going to save it to
23:38 - their projects
23:40 - uh on your teacher dashboard or and they
23:42 - can also
23:43 - go on to the next level so um that's
23:45 - just a quick demo of how to get students
23:47 - logged in
23:48 - what they will experience if they're
23:49 - playing beach cleanup um i'm gonna go
23:51 - back
23:52 - out and just show you this is where
23:55 - students go to the
23:56 - uh make your own quotable mazes this is
23:58 - where students will go
23:59 - to build their own characters uh if they
24:02 - if you chose the free play option it
24:05 - would actually take them
24:06 - to uh flustopia and mission control
24:10 - where they can play through codable at
24:12 - their own pace
24:13 - choose from any of the four codeable
24:15 - worlds
24:16 - to play on um and
24:20 - you know kind of experience codable in
24:22 - its entirety
24:23 - at their own pace
24:27 - um i believe
24:30 - that covers it let me just double check
24:33 - my
24:33 - notes real quick yeah i think the only
24:36 - other thing that might be helpful to
24:37 - mention here on the fostopia screen
24:39 - is if your kids do somehow navigate
24:42 - themselves to this
24:43 - screen and you're wondering how to get
24:45 - back to all of those hour of code
24:46 - activities
24:47 - there is a beach hut underneath the home
24:50 - building that has the hour of code sign
24:52 - on it
24:53 - and that's what your kids your students
24:54 - can click in order to get back to the
24:56 - hour of code activities sometimes it can
24:58 - be tricky if they get kicked out
24:59 - for whatever reason so that's how they
25:01 - find their way back yes thank you hannah
25:03 - and that brings up a good point which is
25:04 - that
25:05 - um this method of sending out the
25:08 - tutorial link to your students with the
25:10 - landing page
25:12 - to bring them directly here works on the
25:14 - web
25:15 - however if they're playing at home um
25:18 - and they're on an ios device or if
25:20 - you're in school on an ios device
25:21 - there's no way for us to like directly
25:23 - to the specific activity so what you're
25:26 - going to do is have them click on this
25:28 - hour code hut
25:29 - when they first come in to the game and
25:31 - tell them which activity you want them
25:33 - to do
25:33 - um so they will land here on fuzztopia
25:37 - and you're going to want to direct them
25:38 - to the hour of code hud
25:40 - if you're playing on ios thank you i
25:43 - meant to mention that yes um yeah okay
25:47 - um and next up on our agenda
25:52 - is recognizing uh what
25:56 - students are recognizing student
25:57 - achievement
25:59 - um so
26:03 - i'm gonna quickly share my screen so
26:05 - that you guys can see
26:06 - my student progress um
26:11 - great
26:15 - okay so um after the hour of code
26:18 - kids are gonna be super excited about
26:20 - coding uh they
26:21 - you know are jazzed up because they've
26:24 - been playing in a really fun game
26:26 - for an hour uh and it's a great
26:28 - opportunity to
26:29 - um recognize what they've just done
26:32 - and also to share with their family
26:35 - about what you are doing
26:36 - in the classroom whether that's a
26:38 - virtual classroom or an in-person
26:39 - classroom
26:40 - um and here is where you can find
26:44 - what students have been doing so i'm
26:46 - gonna click
26:47 - on one of my classes
26:51 - and i'm going to click on my famous
26:54 - class
27:00 - okay so here i can see my students
27:03 - progress and everything that they've
27:05 - achieved
27:06 - uh while they were playing codable this
27:08 - is where you'll find
27:09 - progress from the free play option so if
27:12 - students are just playing encodable
27:14 - they're playing that introduction to
27:16 - programming beginner
27:18 - pre-readers welcome activity this is
27:20 - where you're gonna see their progress
27:22 - you can
27:22 - view individual students um you can see
27:26 - different levels that they completed you
27:27 - can see what concepts they were working
27:29 - on
27:30 - um and all of this is being reworked by
27:33 - fabulous hannah um so keep an eye on
27:36 - this page for
27:38 - cool updates um you can also
27:42 - view creation so if you
27:45 - assigned the fuzz builder tutorial or
27:49 - the maze maker tutorial
27:50 - this is where you can actually see what
27:52 - your students created
27:54 - so i can see all of the fuzzes that my
27:56 - students made
27:58 - i can actually get a pdf version
28:03 - of that fuzz and send it home to
28:06 - their family and let them see it it's
28:09 - going to show me the code
28:11 - that the student wrote so i can actually
28:15 - see what my student wrote and the code
28:18 - that they
28:18 - wrote to create their fuzz um so that's
28:21 - a really fun
28:22 - way to recognize student achievement if
28:24 - they
28:25 - created any sort of you know fun
28:27 - creation
28:28 - same with maze maker you're going to be
28:30 - able to see
28:32 - yeah here we go you're going to be able
28:34 - to see sorry these are really old mazes
28:36 - they're not showing up um you're going
28:38 - to be able to see the maze
28:40 - and print to share with the family
28:45 - and lastly i will show you where you can
28:48 - find certificates this is a big hit
28:50 - every year
28:51 - everyone wants certificates for their
28:52 - students so um and it's a great way to
28:55 - recognize what they've been working on
28:57 - so if you want to download certificates
28:59 - for your students
29:00 - you just select the classes that you
29:01 - want to include
29:03 - um and then this is going to generate a
29:06 - pdf
29:07 - with their with their names on it so
29:10 - find my
29:17 - and that'll have each individual
29:22 - student a certificate with their name on
29:24 - it
29:25 - for you to send home all right
29:29 - um one of the questions that we have
29:32 - gotten in the past is
29:33 - how to invest and promote to the outside
29:36 - community i.e parents
29:38 - um about what you're doing
29:41 - in the classroom and i think that um a
29:44 - great way to do that
29:45 - if just the low touch easy way of doing
29:48 - it is sharing these resources with them
29:51 - um letting them know what your child has
29:52 - been doing it's what their child has
29:54 - been doing at school
29:56 - um and you know what you're trying to
29:59 - accomplish with it
30:00 - so we have a very nice letter to
30:03 - families that you can get from our
30:04 - virtual learning page
30:06 - and um
30:09 - here it is and that's just introducing
30:12 - them to
30:12 - what coding is why it's important and
30:15 - what you've been doing with codable
30:17 - at school at school whether it's in
30:19 - person or
30:20 - remotely um and it also includes
30:23 - their class code on it so this is a
30:25 - great option if you want to
30:27 - and it's the same situation where you
30:28 - just generate the pdf and it has student
30:30 - names
30:31 - and their class code and it with
30:33 - instructions for parents to log in so
30:36 - that's a great way to get the uh to both
30:39 - generate you know interest and
30:42 - investment
30:42 - from the larger community um but also to
30:45 - get your class codes at home to
30:47 - hundreds of kids all the same time so
30:50 - with that i'm going to hand it over to
30:54 - hannah
30:54 - who has more to share about
30:58 - our virtual learning tools awesome
31:01 - yes so i am going to walk through
31:04 - some more of those tools that was just
31:06 - on the virtual learning
31:08 - page that gretchen was sharing so
31:11 - if we take a look back at this page
31:14 - we put this together at the beginning of
31:17 - or over the summer
31:18 - to help you guys with virtual learning
31:21 - remote learning
31:22 - during this school year it will these
31:25 - resources like gretchen had mentioned
31:27 - these will be really useful whether or
31:29 - not you are teaching
31:30 - fully virtually if you're in a hybrid
31:32 - model or you are face to face
31:34 - it's just helpful tools tips and tools
31:36 - that can be
31:38 - used both in a virtual setting and in
31:40 - person so i'll just walk through what
31:42 - these tools are
31:43 - again you can find this tab it's right
31:44 - below the hour of code tab
31:47 - on your teacher dashboard so this first
31:49 - section here at the top
31:50 - is awesome if you haven't used this yet
31:52 - i highly recommend it
31:54 - and this is a unique url for
31:57 - all of your classes so let's say you
31:59 - teach
32:00 - 10 different elementary coding classes
32:04 - and you have a lot of families of your
32:06 - students who are wondering
32:08 - what is my my child's class code how do
32:10 - they log
32:11 - in what's their password they just need
32:14 - support with login
32:15 - you can send this single url
32:18 - you can copy it post it on a class page
32:21 - send it in an email
32:23 - to all of the families of your students
32:27 - no matter what class they're in and i
32:29 - will just click this so you can see what
32:31 - it looks like it'll
32:32 - it'll look like this so the one piece of
32:34 - information that
32:35 - families will need to know is the name
32:38 - of their child's class so these are all
32:41 - of the classes
32:42 - that i have listed out if i
32:45 - am a parent and i know my child is in
32:47 - the fifth grade class
32:49 - they can go to this url click this url
32:52 - they can view the class and then choose
32:55 - their
32:55 - child and download login instructions
32:58 - here
32:59 - so this came to be because we had a lot
33:01 - of requests from teachers who were
33:02 - asking for more support
33:04 - in getting a bunch of login information
33:07 - to a large
33:08 - group of students so that is the way to
33:11 - do it
33:11 - again i found that right here on the
33:12 - virtual learning resources page
33:14 - copy the link send it out and they can
33:16 - look up the class code
33:18 - and the password for their child's
33:20 - account
33:21 - all of that information they might need
33:23 - to have a successful hour of code
33:25 - remotely some other useful tools on this
33:28 - page
33:29 - include a student info list so this is
33:32 - similar information
33:34 - all of the class codes passwords login
33:36 - information for
33:37 - all of your students exported in a
33:39 - really easy to read csv
33:42 - so that's available here we have the
33:44 - worksheet packets
33:45 - that are also included in the unplugged
33:48 - hour of code activity that you can take
33:49 - a look at
33:50 - you can download them here as well
33:52 - another super useful thing that has
33:55 - been really successful during the
33:58 - covid shutdowns were video lessons so if
34:01 - i click view videos it's going to kick
34:03 - me over to the
34:04 - the video tab here on the left and you
34:07 - can choose between
34:08 - explain videos so videos that instruct
34:11 - and teach a new concept
34:12 - as well as create videos videos that
34:14 - pose some sort of a creative prompt
34:16 - and ask students to complete a project
34:19 - so beyond the hour of code if you're
34:21 - looking for
34:23 - some support with coding lessons if you
34:26 - want some
34:27 - instructional videos or some creative
34:29 - activities you can
34:30 - take a look here on your dashboard so
34:33 - all of these videos are super short
34:35 - there's not any that are over five
34:36 - minutes long you can assign them
34:38 - directly to students you can share a
34:40 - link to your class page
34:42 - and we have videos for every single
34:44 - concept that
34:45 - we cover in codable and i just wanted to
34:47 - point out in the create section
34:49 - we update these pretty regularly we just
34:52 - had an activity for halloween and we had
34:54 - a fall themed activity as well that's
34:56 - unplugged
34:56 - so if you're still looking for some fall
34:58 - themed content you can show this video
35:01 - and students cr complete a short
35:03 - unplugged activity
35:05 - so that is available to you from the
35:07 - video section
35:09 - i'm back at the virtual learning uh just
35:11 - to go over the last of the tools here
35:14 - so there's a virtual learning kickoff
35:15 - lesson if you are new to codable or
35:18 - i mean i guess even if you're not new to
35:19 - codable and you're just looking for
35:22 - some sort of structured lesson to
35:24 - introduce
35:25 - or to reacquaint students with the fuzz
35:27 - family of codable
35:28 - uh before the hour of code definitely
35:31 - check out this
35:32 - kickoff lesson it's just a slide stack
35:33 - you can make a copy of it
35:35 - and edit it however you wish but i
35:37 - included here
35:38 - a bunch of prompts i included some
35:40 - videos that introduced the fuzz family
35:43 - there's a couple other tips for getting
35:46 - logged in
35:47 - it walks students through everything
35:49 - they might need as well as an
35:51 - introduction to fuzztopia
35:52 - so if you want some sort of a lesson to
35:55 - introduce students
35:56 - to codable and the fuzz family before
35:59 - you start the hour of code
36:00 - that is available to you here gretchen
36:03 - mentioned the letters to families and
36:04 - then
36:05 - we also have a blog the codable blog
36:08 - that
36:08 - we are updating multiple articles
36:12 - a week right now that include tips and
36:14 - tricks for
36:15 - teaching virtually different unplugged
36:17 - activities
36:18 - different coding activities in general
36:21 - so
36:22 - definitely follow our codable blog if
36:23 - you're looking for some regularly
36:25 - updated
36:26 - coding content and we're posting a lot
36:28 - over there
36:30 - and those are the virtual learning
36:32 - resources
36:33 - please take advantage of this page and
36:35 - if you notice anything's missing if you
36:37 - think oh
36:38 - it would be super helpful if i had this
36:41 - feature that i don't see here please
36:44 - fill out this is just a link to a google
36:45 - form you can make
36:46 - make a suggestion i've been reading
36:48 - through those and it gives us some
36:50 - inspiration for what to create in the
36:52 - future so we can make
36:53 - this as easy for you guys as possible
36:57 - and with that i will move on to
37:00 - our the last thing i wanted to share
37:02 - which is just that if you are new to
37:04 - codable
37:05 - and you haven't set up a class yet and
37:09 - you don't know too much about all of the
37:12 - dashboard logistics
37:14 - i will say that we covered everything
37:16 - you could possibly need to know about
37:18 - setting up a class managing your classes
37:21 - adding passwords changing a class code
37:23 - all of these things in our back to
37:25 - school webinar
37:26 - and we've linked to that webinar in the
37:29 - webinar agenda for this hour of code
37:31 - webinar so you can check out that link
37:34 - to the back to school one
37:35 - it's also on our youtube page which i
37:37 - know you can find because you're here
37:38 - already
37:39 - and that'll just give you a quick
37:40 - rundown if you want kind of a refresher
37:43 - of what gretchen was talking about with
37:44 - my classes and progress we go over all
37:47 - of it so
37:47 - i definitely recommend you check out the
37:49 - back to school webinar if you're looking
37:51 - for more help
37:52 - setting up a class and then of course
37:54 - reach out to us if
37:55 - if there's still some confusion there
37:57 - and we can help get you set up before
37:59 - the hour of code kicks off next week
38:06 - i just realized uh we had a request for
38:08 - you to turn up your mic or i guess
38:10 - maybe speak a little louder um sorry
38:12 - everyone i know we're 38 minutes into
38:15 - this
38:15 - but that's that's been a request so
38:18 - sorry okay don't worry
38:22 - no worries okay so i could i didn't
38:24 - notice
38:26 - but others others have requested it so
38:29 - um i think it's time to move on to
38:33 - q a all right cool so
38:36 - we have some questions from the audience
38:39 - uh one of them that i wanted to be sure
38:42 - to mention
38:43 - um is from karen okdahl long time
38:46 - codabler
38:47 - uh how or does the easy difficulty level
38:51 - migrate into the harder levels as the
38:53 - students progress and she's talking
38:55 - specifically about the
38:56 - beach cleanup activity and it does
39:00 - not so whatever level your students
39:03 - choose so if they choose the easy level
39:05 - they're going to stay in the easy level
39:07 - until they're ready to move on to
39:10 - medium or hard and they can just go back
39:13 - and then play again and select the
39:15 - medium or
39:15 - hard difficulty level with each level of
39:19 - difficulty i should have mentioned this
39:20 - earlier
39:22 - they're going to have new concepts that
39:24 - they can
39:25 - incorporate into their maze designs
39:27 - there's also going to be fewer bins
39:29 - to put in their solution so for example
39:32 - with easy the options are sequence and
39:34 - conditions
39:36 - and they have i think it's eight or nine
39:39 - bins for their answer
39:41 - with the medium they can incorporate
39:43 - loops and they have
39:44 - one less bin and with
39:48 - the hard activity um
39:51 - they can add functions
39:54 - and that has
39:57 - two fewer bins than the easy mode um so
40:00 - i just wanted to be sure to clarify that
40:03 - we also um had some questions
40:07 - um if there can be more than one teacher
40:11 - on a class and there cannot be
40:15 - uh there's only one teacher per class um
40:17 - however
40:18 - on the quotable premium plan you do have
40:21 - the option to
40:22 - um if you're an admin add multiple
40:25 - teachers and so you can actually view
40:26 - student progress you can add the classes
40:29 - for your teachers if you need to
40:31 - but that is on the premium version of
40:34 - quotable only
40:35 - um okay and then i wanted to address
40:39 - some of those are the questions from the
40:40 - chat
40:41 - if anybody has questions that haven't
40:43 - been uh bree's been on it with all of
40:46 - the questions she's
40:47 - watching she always yeah she's been
40:49 - cruising through all these questions
40:51 - um but if there's anything that you have
40:55 - questions about that you would like to
40:57 - ask we will
40:58 - talk about it here but in the meantime
41:01 - i'm going to go ahead
41:02 - and address some of the questions that
41:04 - we got
41:05 - prior to the webinar so um
41:09 - let's see here one of the questions is
41:13 - what is the best way to teach coding
41:15 - virtually and
41:16 - i think we've talked a lot about the
41:18 - different ways that you can teach coding
41:19 - virtually this year
41:21 - all of the different resources that you
41:22 - can use ultimately it's up to you
41:25 - you are the expert you know your class
41:27 - situation every single classroom
41:30 - is experiencing different things right
41:32 - now so we can't be the ones to tell you
41:34 - what the best way to do that
41:36 - is however if you're just starting out
41:39 - if it were me and hannah please correct
41:40 - me if you think i'm wrong
41:42 - but i would definitely start with the
41:44 - like
41:45 - virtual kickoff lesson that hannah
41:48 - showed in the virtual
41:49 - resources section and then just give my
41:53 - kids
41:53 - access to the free play pre-readers
41:57 - activity encodable that lets them roam
42:00 - and be free to choose whatever coding
42:02 - activity they want to do
42:03 - and that's what i would do with my
42:05 - students especially if i'm
42:07 - if i'm virtual there's lots of videos
42:09 - that can accompany
42:11 - uh the kickoff lesson and also the um
42:16 - the pre-reader activity uh they're
42:18 - available on your videos
42:19 - page uh if you want to add a video to
42:22 - kind of enrich the lesson for them
42:24 - um but that's what i would do if it were
42:26 - me hannah
42:27 - anything you want to add to that yeah i
42:29 - agree i think that
42:31 - you know we've been adding video lessons
42:33 - to the dashboard
42:35 - we added from february to now i think
42:39 - 30 different videos so if you're unsure
42:41 - about how to introduce coding
42:43 - in a virtual setting over zoom and you
42:45 - have young students
42:47 - um you know it makes sense that that's
42:49 - that's really tricky and
42:50 - hopefully the video lessons that we have
42:52 - available to you
42:53 - are helpful because i do think that you
42:56 - can create a really rich coding lesson
42:57 - by
42:58 - showing a video and then doing an
42:59 - activity encodable with
43:01 - you know limited prep or instruction
43:04 - needed from
43:05 - you the teacher so if you're unsure
43:07 - about how to teach coding
43:08 - you know we have those supports there
43:10 - for you
43:13 - definitely okay we have a question from
43:15 - the audience
43:16 - uh is there a way to uh archive classes
43:21 - and there's not a way to archive classes
43:24 - so that you can bring them back later
43:27 - but you can delete classes permanently
43:29 - so if you just want to remove classes
43:30 - from your clinical dashboard that are
43:32 - from years past
43:33 - you can delete those classes you can
43:35 - also transfer students
43:37 - so if you have your classes from last
43:38 - year still set up
43:40 - and you still see some of the students
43:42 - and you need to move them to their new
43:43 - homeroom
43:44 - you can transfer students from class to
43:47 - class
43:48 - um easily and in bulk on your teacher
43:51 - dashboard
43:52 - just go to support.codable and search
43:55 - transfer and you'll see an article with
43:57 - instructions on how to do that
44:00 - um okay one question that we got
44:03 - previously was
44:04 - uh we use seesaw and canvas with
44:06 - students
44:07 - can they share their work with a class
44:09 - of peers within these learning
44:11 - management systems
44:12 - and yes uh we actually have some and
44:16 - i'll post this link
44:17 - in the chat for you we actually have
44:20 - some seesaw activities set up for
44:23 - codable
44:25 - on our codable blog and you can
44:29 - use those activities if you want to or
44:31 - just take them as inspiration
44:33 - if you want to create your own hour of
44:36 - code
44:36 - codable seesaw activity specific to your
44:39 - class
44:40 - that's what i would suggest doing
44:42 - because you know the situation you know
44:44 - what
44:44 - you want to ask your students to share
44:47 - that would be a good place to start so
44:50 - i'm just going to
44:51 - place that link here for you
44:54 - and that's the link to all of our seesaw
44:56 - activities you can take a look at them
44:58 - and use them with your students it's a
45:00 - great we love see-saw it's a great way
45:02 - to
45:03 - encourage collaboration even if you're
45:06 - you know your students are learning from
45:07 - home
45:08 - um one of the questions we also had was
45:13 - uh what advice would you give to
45:16 - students that think coding is not for
45:18 - them
45:19 - it's a good question um and what about
45:22 - when it's
45:23 - when it gets hard sometimes just trying
45:26 - again is even more frustrating
45:28 - what are more specific strategies for
45:30 - not giving up
45:31 - i love this question and i think hannah
45:33 - just wrote a great blog post about it
45:35 - hannah can you talk a little bit more
45:36 - about it
45:37 - yeah definitely so i had a really
45:39 - similar experience when i was a computer
45:41 - science teacher
45:42 - i was using a program my students were
45:45 - not very interested and there was a lot
45:46 - of frustration happening
45:48 - and i was struggling a lot i'm trying to
45:50 - teach them and get them excited about it
45:52 - so
45:53 - what ended up working for me was
45:56 - really kind of shifting gears and doing
45:58 - more of an emergent
46:00 - curriculum mindset which meant
46:03 - i scrapped my plans and i
46:07 - tried to focus on relevant topics to the
46:10 - students in their
46:11 - real lives and how i could curate
46:14 - lessons about uh what was actually going
46:18 - on
46:18 - and and different creative projects they
46:20 - could create to solve problems
46:23 - uh in the real world so we did a big
46:26 - design thinking unit and
46:30 - different projects where they were
46:31 - solving problems through engineering and
46:34 - then
46:35 - coding in scratch and using other
46:37 - programs to
46:38 - to try to link it all together so yeah i
46:42 - would say
46:43 - you know it's it can be really tricky
46:46 - if they're not showing interest i would
46:49 - keep trying to
46:50 - tweak and modify your lesson plans to
46:52 - see if there's a project or something
46:54 - creative that they can build
46:56 - that makes coding a bit more relevant to
46:58 - them in their real
47:00 - lives and i did just release a blog post
47:03 - about developing problem-solving skills
47:07 - for young
47:07 - children and how it can be tricky but
47:10 - there are some tools that
47:11 - you can do some anchor charts you can
47:13 - try different tips and tricks in that
47:15 - blog
47:16 - for how to develop creative problem
47:18 - solvers and
47:20 - and how to help students when they face
47:21 - that that moment of unsureness
47:24 - how to help them be resilient so i think
47:27 - we can link that blog
47:28 - that blog post in the chat perhaps but
47:31 - definitely check it out
47:32 - it's up on there and if you need more
47:35 - tips or you want to chat about different
47:37 - ways to modify
47:38 - your curriculum to support those
47:40 - students that are struggling
47:42 - i'm happy to connect individually and
47:44 - and we can chat about that
47:48 - awesome thank you yeah i just asked
47:50 - maria she's another codable
47:52 - team member that's hanging back and
47:54 - behind the scenes making this all work
47:56 - i asked her for the link so she can send
47:58 - it to me to post uh oh
48:00 - great great somebody already posted it
48:01 - awesome way to go team
48:04 - um okay so another question
48:07 - uh that we should address um do you have
48:10 - good videos or recommendations as to how
48:13 - to best
48:13 - introduce the hour of code to elementary
48:16 - students who have never
48:17 - coded before yes uh great question
48:20 - i have two videos that i'm going to link
48:22 - in the um
48:24 - chat for you one of them is a video from
48:28 - codable that we created with some
48:30 - codable kiddos
48:31 - and it's just so much fun we made it a
48:33 - few years ago
48:34 - um then explaining what the hour of code
48:37 - is why it's cool why coding is fun
48:39 - um and what you should do you know if
48:41 - you're another kid
48:42 - and you're interested in coding so i'm
48:45 - gonna link to that here
48:47 - and then there is also a video by
48:50 - code.org that i think is really great
48:52 - um that has a lot of celebrities and
48:55 - famous people
48:56 - and um other you know notable people
48:59 - talking about what coding is and why
49:02 - it is um important to learn so
49:05 - that's also linked here um
49:10 - let me check the chat see if we have any
49:12 - other questions
49:14 - nothing so far okay i'll move on to the
49:16 - next um
49:18 - question how do i optimize the use of
49:20 - codeable for a remote only class with
49:22 - students with disabilities
49:24 - what are recommended strategies um
49:27 - so hannah do you want to take this one
49:30 - sure
49:31 - so i would again that remote kickoff
49:34 - lesson that i
49:35 - shared on the virtual learning resources
49:37 - page
49:39 - i think that would be really helpful for
49:41 - students of any
49:42 - developmental level because it does have
49:45 - a lot of pictures
49:46 - and steps that are clearly mapped out
49:49 - so i i think in terms of introducing
49:52 - codable
49:53 - having that kind of map where you can
49:56 - follow slide by slide picture by picture
49:58 - step by step
49:59 - can be really helpful for kids who have
50:02 - just
50:03 - for students who have disabilities so
50:05 - that would be a good place to start
50:07 - for codable because i know it can be
50:09 - pretty overwhelming
50:10 - for some students when they first log in
50:12 - and there's so much going on and it can
50:14 - it can be a little over
50:15 - stimulating so breaking it down into
50:17 - really manageable
50:19 - bite-sized pieces is a good first step i
50:21 - would say
50:25 - gretchen did you want to add anything um
50:28 - no i think
50:28 - mainly the the only other thing i would
50:30 - say is that codable
50:32 - is uh not designed for students with
50:34 - disabilities we didn't have that
50:36 - um need in mind when we were designing
50:39 - it um
50:40 - we do have lots of teachers that use it
50:42 - successfully with their students with
50:44 - disabilities
50:45 - we are however not the experts you're
50:47 - the expert so
50:49 - um i would just say you know you know
50:51 - your class best
50:52 - and use your discretion uh when you're
50:55 - you know making choices for your
50:57 - students
50:57 - um we do have a lot of student or
51:00 - teachers in the
51:01 - codable community that use it with you
51:03 - know their students with disabilities
51:05 - i would pose a question on twitter
51:08 - to the to them um and see
51:11 - you know if you get some responses that
51:14 - way um
51:15 - and yeah that that covers it
51:18 - um okay the next question is i teach
51:21 - about 600 students in grades k to five
51:24 - is there a limit to how many students i
51:26 - can assign levels to
51:27 - lessons to uh and no there's not there's
51:30 - no limit on the number of students that
51:32 - you can use codable with
51:33 - um although we do have a question in the
51:35 - chat that is relevant to this so i'll be
51:38 - sure to mention it
51:39 - um classes are limited to 50 students
51:42 - so you can break up classes
51:46 - into sections of 50 if you need to
51:50 - the reason we have a limit is for
51:52 - loading uh
51:54 - concerns but also usability if you can
51:57 - imagine
51:58 - a hundred names scrolling through that
52:02 - as a kindergartener would be
52:04 - a nightmare for you and a nightmare for
52:05 - them so we do limit it to 50 students
52:09 - and if you have um more than 50 students
52:13 - in a class
52:14 - i would suggest breaking them up by
52:15 - alphabetically or
52:18 - in some other way to
52:21 - create classes that make sense for you
52:24 - and for your students
52:25 - um and i think that that covers it
52:28 - so the next question is
52:33 - um our school district has the codable
52:37 - app available to students
52:39 - on the on clevver how should they log
52:43 - in this is a great question we have a
52:44 - lot of clever users and a lot of clever
52:46 - fans
52:47 - and um what i would suggest
52:50 - is different from what we've covered so
52:52 - far in the webinar i would suggest
52:54 - actually logging in directly the way
52:57 - that your students are used to
52:58 - in clever don't deviate from what your
53:01 - students have
53:02 - learned to to do to log into codable um
53:05 - log in and then have them go to that
53:07 - beach cleanup i'm sorry not be clean
53:10 - the hour of code hut that's that we
53:12 - showed you earlier on flustopia
53:15 - um so what you would do is just have
53:17 - them log in with clever
53:18 - and then click on the hour of code hut
53:20 - underneath of the little home
53:22 - and that will direct them to all of the
53:23 - hour of code activities
53:25 - yeah and i included a an image of that
53:28 - hour of code hut in the webinar agenda
53:30 - so you know exactly
53:32 - what image kids are looking for when
53:34 - they log in so hopefully
53:35 - it's easy to find yes definitely
53:39 - okay are there any other questions we've
53:41 - we've covered it all
53:42 - um in just under an hour so
53:45 - um but if anybody has any final
53:47 - questions you'd like us to address
53:49 - um please post them into the chat we'll
53:51 - wait a couple of minutes but
53:52 - um maybe maybe a minute
53:56 - um but i think that we've covered most
53:57 - everything um thank you all so so much
54:00 - for joining us for participating for
54:04 - being brave enough to be a teacher in
54:07 - this wild year
54:08 - we really appreciate you all um i know
54:11 - that it's been difficult i know
54:13 - that there's been a lot of uncertainty
54:15 - um so we really appreciate you all we
54:18 - are glad that you joined us
54:19 - and we are glad you're planning to do
54:21 - the hour of code this year because it's
54:22 - such
54:22 - an important activity for our students
54:26 - um
54:27 - to just get them engaged in learning and
54:29 - get them engaged in
54:31 - learning about a skill that's going to
54:32 - be useful for the rest of their lives
54:35 - so um i think that that's everything we
54:39 - don't have any other questions
54:41 - uh brie just posted the agenda again in
54:43 - the chat
54:44 - so uh everything that we've talked about
54:47 - is linked in there
54:48 - um if you have any other questions you
54:50 - can always reach out to us
54:52 - at support clinical.com thank you
54:55 - all right bye everyone happy hour of
55:02 - code

Cleaned transcript:

hi everyone happy hour of code my name is gretchen hebner and this is hannah boston uh we're two members of the codable team uh and we are so excited to bring you the hour of code webinar we're going to go over all the things that you i'm sorry we're going to go over all the things that you need to do to prepare for the hour of code this year um so i am one of the founders of codable uh this is my i guess seventh hour of code hooray yay uh hannah is uh newer to the codable team than seven years ago but she's not she is a veteran hour of coder um hannah do you want to introduce yourself a little bit tell us a little bit about what you do at codable sure so i am the instructional designer and coach at codable so my main role is supporting you guys the teachers creating teacher guides videos anything that you need to do to feel confident teaching coding with your elementary students and lately i've been making a lot of our student facing videos so the videos you might watch to prep for the hour of code i helped to create those so if you guys have any questions recommendations for future videos lesson plans worksheets anything like that that's what i'm working on so yeah i'm really excited for the hour of code this year it's going to be a good one yeah yeah it's going to be great even though it might be a little bit different a lot of you submitted questions asking about how to participate in the hour of code virtually or in a hybrid model because things are wild right now everybody is in a different situation so we're going to talk a lot about ways that you can do the hour of code virtually with your students or practicing social distancing uh and what have you uh so with that i'm gonna hop into the agenda just tell you guys a little bit about what we're gonna cover today so first and foremost we're gonna start off strong talking about how to do the hour of code during a pandemic um and we'll get into how to prepare uh and this is the same whether you are in person or uh teaching virtually what you need to do to prepare uh to teach with your students um what will students be doing so we'll go over some of the tutorials we'll go over how to log them in uh or how to tell them to log in if they're doing that from home uh then we'll talk a little bit about how to recognize their achievements some of the different things that you can see on your teacher dashboard after the hour of code is completed and how you can recognize them uh we'll go over some more of our virtual learning tools and these aren't specific to the hour of code these are just tools that you can use uh you know to use codeable but they are very helpful for the hour of code so we went over them a little bit in our back to school webinar if any of you were at that um but we wanted to be sure to mention all of them here again today and then we have a set of we have set aside some time at the end of the webinar for uh questions and answers some of you guys posted questions but we will also be taking questions from the audience so there's a little chat window over on the right hand side of the video and you can post your questions there brie gray is our um director of customer success she is hanging out in the chat answering all of your questions she is the best person to answer questions uh so she will get to them as quickly as she can if she doesn't get to it we'll talk about it on air um and there there's also an agenda floating around we sent it in the email and there's just helpful resources in there everything that we post and talk about today is covered in that agenda so um if you are like oh no i need that link you can go to the agenda and find the link so uh but we'll also post some links in the chat all right with that i'm going to hop into um what to do during the hour of code during pandemic okay so um the hour of code is a magical moment in every year uh where we talk about the importance of learning to code we introduce what coding is to our students and it's a worldwide event organized by code.org to um just get kids to try one hour of coding and there's no reason that we can't do this we fully believe in you guys and we've done everything we can to to prepare resources for you to do this virtually if that's what's happening in your school so um you do not need to know how to code to teach an hour of code your students do not need to have any previous coding experience it is designed to be a beginner experience so if this is your first hour of code we've got you you're going to come out of this prepared and if it's your fifth or seventh like me uh welcome back we're so glad to have you so um i will i think that's everything oh i did want to make sure to mention that um the hour of code is an event to honor grace hopper who is a awesome woman and she was an early pioneer in computer science she created the first compiler and every year the hour code is a week long celebration to celebrate her birthday she was born on december 7th and she was an admiral in the u.s navy and she created the first compiler she's also famous for coining the phrase bug because she found a moth in the room sized computer that she was working on uh and it was causing the computer not to work so that's where the phrase bug came from it's from an actual bug it was a moth stuck in a computer um so with that i think we are ready to move on to how to prepare um so hannah is going to take you through all of the resources that you can look through to prepare to teach the hour code with your students um and she's going to go over some of the activities and then i'm going to talk about setup so hannah thank you gretchen so yes i'm going to talk about how to prepare the first thing you can do to prepare is log into your teacher dashboard and we have created a brand new tab on the teacher dashboard titled hour of code that has all the resources you could possibly need to prep for the hour of code and teach it to your students so this is the hour of code tab it's right at the top of your teacher dashboard and it's bolded so you can't miss it and you'll see the first thing at the top is the how to hour of code with codable video everything that i'm about to mention is summarized in a short four minute video right here at the top of your hour of code page so if you feel like i'm moving too fast or you just want to review the steps that i'm talking about here to prepare i definitely recommend you log into your dashboard view this hour of code page and check out the video it'll be super helpful for you so the first step to prepare for the hour of code is going to be to decide where and how you will run the hour of code this means what devices your students will be using to do the hour of code activities the tutorials so this is going to look really different for all of us some of you might be face to face and have ipads or some sort of inschool device to use with your students other teachers might have students that are remote and maybe you don't know exactly what devices they're using we do have an ios app so any student with an ios device like an ipad or an iphone can participate in the hour of code and we also have all the hour of code activities available via the web so it doesn't totally matter what devices your students are using it'll just be helpful for you to plan ahead so you know how to help them for login and things like that but this year we're also really excited to share that we have a totally unplugged lesson for the hour of code that's just worksheets that students can complete so if your students do not have access to tech devices that is okay we got you covered and we have an unplugged activity for you this year so step one decide where and how the second step to prepare for the hour of code will be to choose a tutorial so on this hour of code page if you scroll down we have all of our tutorials or that's the hour of code speak for activity or project we have them all featured here at the bottom and we have five featured activities this year we have a bunch more i think there's 15 plus activities you can choose from but these are the five that we that we recommend for beginner coders and beginner teachers they have the most supports with them so i'm going to walk through the different activities we have available to you but again i definitely recommend you explore the hour of code page yourself you might find another activity that you'd like to use with your students so the first activity that we have available is the intro to programming prereaders welcome if you are new to codable or your students are younger we had a couple questions write in about what's the best activity for my kindergartners or my first graders we definitely recommend this intro to programming it'll introduce students to the coding basics like sequence conditions loops and functions and it's just an introduction to the codeable game so it'll give students four different games to choose from and they can work through the game levels they are selfguided selfpaced so students can kind of control their learning experience with very minimal prep or instruction from you the teacher the second it's a great option for free play too if you're just wanting to have them do free play that's a great great job absolutely yeah because it's self exactly thanksgiving it's selfpaced and so free play um would be an awesome option for that activity uh the second one that we have featured here is make your own codable mazes oh and i just wanted to point out we have all the grade recommendations listed below the activity as well um the second one is make your own codeable mazes so here students are guided through five different levels of codable and then they complete a maze building challenge that's aligned with common core math standards so in the game the students will choose their grade level and then the challenge that they are presented will be aligned with common core math for that grade level so that's a really great one if you're looking for a way to integrate coding into some of your other subjects like math this would be a great one for you plus as kids get to make their own mazes they can express their creativity and get artistic so that is a great option for you guys the third one here is beach cleanup if you did the hour of code with codable last year you'll know that beach cleanup was brand new last year this year we have it again and we've revamped it given it a little bit of a facelift and so this is an awesome option if you want to integrate with environmental science in this activity students learn to program using basic commands and clean up the fuzztopia beach to protect the ocean life the sea creatures so in this activity students will also be designing a maze that connects different pieces of trash and then they code their fuzz through the maze to collect the recycling and this one has three or four different tutorial videos available in the game itself so if you are looking for an activity that has more video support so you don't need to do the direct instruction the kids can click the video and watch it at their own pace at their own time the beach cleanup has those videos embedded in the game so super easy for them to review the concepts and learn as they go and the final one featured here on this page is the build your own fuzz this is an awesome activity if you want students to get creative and design and code their own fuzz character the fuzzes are the characters of codable so students will code and modify properties to bring their character to life and we do recommend here grades two through five because the activity features real javascript syntax so upper elementary students can often do a little bit of a better job making the connections between the javascript syntax and the properties that are shown on their fuzz but again all of these activities are great for all ages students will just modify them to to be appropriate if your kindergartners want to design a fuzz that is aokay they might just not understand the javascript syntax but they'll still get to modify properties and get exposed to code in that way and finally i'll just click this view all button and scroll down a bit and you'll see the first activity underneath the four that are featured is our coding basics unplugged this activity is completely unplugged you'll have to print out worksheets for your students but after that they can use pen and paper and it's a lot of our coding puzzles just in an unplugged format so it's great if students again do not have access to tech devices or if you're just looking for another option if you want to combine unplugged and plugged in this is an option for you and then as you can see there's a bunch more to choose from that integrate into a lot of other subjects like robotics and english so you can take your pick all of these activities can be completed in an hour for the hour of code so they're all here available to you again on your dashboard at the hour of code tab and after you've picked your tutorial the third and final step to prepare is to spread the word so the hour of code as gretchen mentioned is a magical time it's really exciting and i know a lot of us could use a little bit of a boost this year right now so hype up the hour of code your students get to be really creative and it's very fun so get them excited and the other piece to spreading the word is to give them virtual participation instructions so we have that tab right here at the top you can download this participation guide it walks through all the steps students and or their families will need to follow to get logged in and coding so we wanted to make it as easy for you as possible if you send this home and students follow all the steps they should be able to log in to the hour of code and complete their activity so you can email those post it to a class page hand them out in person whatever works best for you but those participation instructions are right there so you can use them how you need and i think that covers all of the activities that we have available this year if you guys have any questions about this page please let us know and again i definitely recommend watching that how to hour of code with codable video it summarizes everything i just mentioned in a bit of a shorter package so with that said i'm going to pass it back off to gretchen to go over how to get students set up since now you've chosen your tutorial you can get the students set up and coding thank you hannah okay so uh i just want to quickly tell you all make sure that uh if you're playing in person if you're using school devices please make sure that you are updated to the latest version of codable so that you have access to the hour of code activities uh some of them have been updated uh and others you know if it's on an older version then it might not have the we have like a timed release for the activities so that they'll show up at a certain date so if it's an old version it might not have the newest activity so please be sure to update your devices if you're playing on the web um you can save the link to whatever activity you choose for your students and post that to your class page or send it home in an email just like hannah said and that will take students directly to the activity that they need to play so i'm just going to quickly walk you through what students are going to see and what they're going to do um so i actually have a question that i think i should probably address first so i have multiple classes with hundreds of students total how can i get the class code to all of my students in the easiest way so like hannah mentioned i think that there are great ways to send home the class code to students we have we're going to go over our all of our virtual learning tools at the end of this and there are three different ways that you can actually send home your class code one of them is with like a pdf that has um the class code on it and instructions on how to log into codable uh so that would be the probably my choice but then there's also like a spreadsheet you can use there's lots of different options so we'll go over oh go over that at the end um we also have ways to add students in bulk so if you're planning to use codeable with a lot of students and you haven't added them decodable yet you can learn more about how to add students in bulk by going to our support center at support codable.com and there you'll find instructions on how to add students in bulk many classes all at once we have google classroom integration clever integration and uh we have our own bulk importer if you're planning to do it that way so lots of options um okay so uh the last thing that i'll say before i show things is that we do encourage so quotable is accessible without a codeable account so if you are a teacher using codable for the very first time and you have you have not set up an account you do not have to have an account to use it um you can go to game.google.com hour code you can direct your students here and there's an option to play without saving um so i'm just going to show you how to do that um and that's here game.codable.com hour of code if you do have a codeable account you can also come here this thing's blocking it there you go you can see it's got a play without saving button and that's where students can go to play um but it will not save their progress it's a onetime use they can come back many times but every time it's going to start them from the beginning so if you're using codable and you don't want to set up classes that's a good way to do it however we do recommend setting up classes just because number one it's free you can use with as many students as you want um but number two you're going to have all of their progress saved you're going to be able to send home instructions you have access to all of these great resources that hannah has covered so i do recommend setting up a class or setting up an account and creating classes like i mentioned there's lots of ways you can add students in bulk okay with that i'm going to show you how students are going to log in so if you're playing on the web and you chose an activity um when you click on that activity you're going to get this little landing page this is the link that i would share with your students because they can just click this play online button and enter their class code and it's going to take them directly to the activity uh without needing to kind of search for it in the in the game all right here we are beach cleanup so i can just click on beach cleanup and start playing um we do have options for instructional videos along with this and they are accessible from that landing page and they're also available on our youtube channel which you are all on presently so you can find them there they're also available on your teacher dashboard on the videos page so um they're they're available in a lot of different places uh and they are also on the lesson plan so you you should have them um so what you would do in this activity click play choose your difficulty level and i'm just going to show you guys how to play uh beach cleanup just so that you are familiar with it because sometimes it can be a little tricky so what you do you want to connect all of these recycling bins or the recycling symbols and program your fuzz through the maze um so this is a really simple sequence level i'm gonna go forward down forward up forward back down and right to go out however it looks like we're going to need a condition i'm just going to add a condition here and we'll talk a little bit about what a condition is um but one thing to point out is that this path can be anything your students want it to be so it's a lot of creativity involved in this activity um you know students thinking about the best way to get through the maze if you want to encourage them not to use a condition um if they haven't learned what conditions are they can re re rearrange this maze uh to remove the condition so and then we have oh i forgot the videos are accessible here as well so here's how to play uh the easy version of codable um just click that little question mark and it's gonna have hannah walk them through how to play um so i'm gonna click play oh i did it just enough moves yes okay i'm gonna click test it and see what happens looks like i'm gonna make it to the end those little penguins are so cute okay so your students can choose to save the maze and that's going to save it to their projects uh on your teacher dashboard or and they can also go on to the next level so um that's just a quick demo of how to get students logged in what they will experience if they're playing beach cleanup um i'm gonna go back out and just show you this is where students go to the uh make your own quotable mazes this is where students will go to build their own characters uh if they if you chose the free play option it would actually take them to uh flustopia and mission control where they can play through codable at their own pace choose from any of the four codeable worlds to play on um and you know kind of experience codable in its entirety at their own pace um i believe that covers it let me just double check my notes real quick yeah i think the only other thing that might be helpful to mention here on the fostopia screen is if your kids do somehow navigate themselves to this screen and you're wondering how to get back to all of those hour of code activities there is a beach hut underneath the home building that has the hour of code sign on it and that's what your kids your students can click in order to get back to the hour of code activities sometimes it can be tricky if they get kicked out for whatever reason so that's how they find their way back yes thank you hannah and that brings up a good point which is that um this method of sending out the tutorial link to your students with the landing page to bring them directly here works on the web however if they're playing at home um and they're on an ios device or if you're in school on an ios device there's no way for us to like directly to the specific activity so what you're going to do is have them click on this hour code hut when they first come in to the game and tell them which activity you want them to do um so they will land here on fuzztopia and you're going to want to direct them to the hour of code hud if you're playing on ios thank you i meant to mention that yes um yeah okay um and next up on our agenda is recognizing uh what students are recognizing student achievement um so i'm gonna quickly share my screen so that you guys can see my student progress um great okay so um after the hour of code kids are gonna be super excited about coding uh they you know are jazzed up because they've been playing in a really fun game for an hour uh and it's a great opportunity to um recognize what they've just done and also to share with their family about what you are doing in the classroom whether that's a virtual classroom or an inperson classroom um and here is where you can find what students have been doing so i'm gonna click on one of my classes and i'm going to click on my famous class okay so here i can see my students progress and everything that they've achieved uh while they were playing codable this is where you'll find progress from the free play option so if students are just playing encodable they're playing that introduction to programming beginner prereaders welcome activity this is where you're gonna see their progress you can view individual students um you can see different levels that they completed you can see what concepts they were working on um and all of this is being reworked by fabulous hannah um so keep an eye on this page for cool updates um you can also view creation so if you assigned the fuzz builder tutorial or the maze maker tutorial this is where you can actually see what your students created so i can see all of the fuzzes that my students made i can actually get a pdf version of that fuzz and send it home to their family and let them see it it's going to show me the code that the student wrote so i can actually see what my student wrote and the code that they wrote to create their fuzz um so that's a really fun way to recognize student achievement if they created any sort of you know fun creation same with maze maker you're going to be able to see yeah here we go you're going to be able to see sorry these are really old mazes they're not showing up um you're going to be able to see the maze and print to share with the family and lastly i will show you where you can find certificates this is a big hit every year everyone wants certificates for their students so um and it's a great way to recognize what they've been working on so if you want to download certificates for your students you just select the classes that you want to include um and then this is going to generate a pdf with their with their names on it so find my and that'll have each individual student a certificate with their name on it for you to send home all right um one of the questions that we have gotten in the past is how to invest and promote to the outside community i.e parents um about what you're doing in the classroom and i think that um a great way to do that if just the low touch easy way of doing it is sharing these resources with them um letting them know what your child has been doing it's what their child has been doing at school um and you know what you're trying to accomplish with it so we have a very nice letter to families that you can get from our virtual learning page and um here it is and that's just introducing them to what coding is why it's important and what you've been doing with codable at school at school whether it's in person or remotely um and it also includes their class code on it so this is a great option if you want to and it's the same situation where you just generate the pdf and it has student names and their class code and it with instructions for parents to log in so that's a great way to get the uh to both generate you know interest and investment from the larger community um but also to get your class codes at home to hundreds of kids all the same time so with that i'm going to hand it over to hannah who has more to share about our virtual learning tools awesome yes so i am going to walk through some more of those tools that was just on the virtual learning page that gretchen was sharing so if we take a look back at this page we put this together at the beginning of or over the summer to help you guys with virtual learning remote learning during this school year it will these resources like gretchen had mentioned these will be really useful whether or not you are teaching fully virtually if you're in a hybrid model or you are face to face it's just helpful tools tips and tools that can be used both in a virtual setting and in person so i'll just walk through what these tools are again you can find this tab it's right below the hour of code tab on your teacher dashboard so this first section here at the top is awesome if you haven't used this yet i highly recommend it and this is a unique url for all of your classes so let's say you teach 10 different elementary coding classes and you have a lot of families of your students who are wondering what is my my child's class code how do they log in what's their password they just need support with login you can send this single url you can copy it post it on a class page send it in an email to all of the families of your students no matter what class they're in and i will just click this so you can see what it looks like it'll it'll look like this so the one piece of information that families will need to know is the name of their child's class so these are all of the classes that i have listed out if i am a parent and i know my child is in the fifth grade class they can go to this url click this url they can view the class and then choose their child and download login instructions here so this came to be because we had a lot of requests from teachers who were asking for more support in getting a bunch of login information to a large group of students so that is the way to do it again i found that right here on the virtual learning resources page copy the link send it out and they can look up the class code and the password for their child's account all of that information they might need to have a successful hour of code remotely some other useful tools on this page include a student info list so this is similar information all of the class codes passwords login information for all of your students exported in a really easy to read csv so that's available here we have the worksheet packets that are also included in the unplugged hour of code activity that you can take a look at you can download them here as well another super useful thing that has been really successful during the covid shutdowns were video lessons so if i click view videos it's going to kick me over to the the video tab here on the left and you can choose between explain videos so videos that instruct and teach a new concept as well as create videos videos that pose some sort of a creative prompt and ask students to complete a project so beyond the hour of code if you're looking for some support with coding lessons if you want some instructional videos or some creative activities you can take a look here on your dashboard so all of these videos are super short there's not any that are over five minutes long you can assign them directly to students you can share a link to your class page and we have videos for every single concept that we cover in codable and i just wanted to point out in the create section we update these pretty regularly we just had an activity for halloween and we had a fall themed activity as well that's unplugged so if you're still looking for some fall themed content you can show this video and students cr complete a short unplugged activity so that is available to you from the video section i'm back at the virtual learning uh just to go over the last of the tools here so there's a virtual learning kickoff lesson if you are new to codable or i mean i guess even if you're not new to codable and you're just looking for some sort of structured lesson to introduce or to reacquaint students with the fuzz family of codable uh before the hour of code definitely check out this kickoff lesson it's just a slide stack you can make a copy of it and edit it however you wish but i included here a bunch of prompts i included some videos that introduced the fuzz family there's a couple other tips for getting logged in it walks students through everything they might need as well as an introduction to fuzztopia so if you want some sort of a lesson to introduce students to codable and the fuzz family before you start the hour of code that is available to you here gretchen mentioned the letters to families and then we also have a blog the codable blog that we are updating multiple articles a week right now that include tips and tricks for teaching virtually different unplugged activities different coding activities in general so definitely follow our codable blog if you're looking for some regularly updated coding content and we're posting a lot over there and those are the virtual learning resources please take advantage of this page and if you notice anything's missing if you think oh it would be super helpful if i had this feature that i don't see here please fill out this is just a link to a google form you can make make a suggestion i've been reading through those and it gives us some inspiration for what to create in the future so we can make this as easy for you guys as possible and with that i will move on to our the last thing i wanted to share which is just that if you are new to codable and you haven't set up a class yet and you don't know too much about all of the dashboard logistics i will say that we covered everything you could possibly need to know about setting up a class managing your classes adding passwords changing a class code all of these things in our back to school webinar and we've linked to that webinar in the webinar agenda for this hour of code webinar so you can check out that link to the back to school one it's also on our youtube page which i know you can find because you're here already and that'll just give you a quick rundown if you want kind of a refresher of what gretchen was talking about with my classes and progress we go over all of it so i definitely recommend you check out the back to school webinar if you're looking for more help setting up a class and then of course reach out to us if if there's still some confusion there and we can help get you set up before the hour of code kicks off next week i just realized uh we had a request for you to turn up your mic or i guess maybe speak a little louder um sorry everyone i know we're 38 minutes into this but that's that's been a request so sorry okay don't worry no worries okay so i could i didn't notice but others others have requested it so um i think it's time to move on to q a all right cool so we have some questions from the audience uh one of them that i wanted to be sure to mention um is from karen okdahl long time codabler uh how or does the easy difficulty level migrate into the harder levels as the students progress and she's talking specifically about the beach cleanup activity and it does not so whatever level your students choose so if they choose the easy level they're going to stay in the easy level until they're ready to move on to medium or hard and they can just go back and then play again and select the medium or hard difficulty level with each level of difficulty i should have mentioned this earlier they're going to have new concepts that they can incorporate into their maze designs there's also going to be fewer bins to put in their solution so for example with easy the options are sequence and conditions and they have i think it's eight or nine bins for their answer with the medium they can incorporate loops and they have one less bin and with the hard activity um they can add functions and that has two fewer bins than the easy mode um so i just wanted to be sure to clarify that we also um had some questions um if there can be more than one teacher on a class and there cannot be uh there's only one teacher per class um however on the quotable premium plan you do have the option to um if you're an admin add multiple teachers and so you can actually view student progress you can add the classes for your teachers if you need to but that is on the premium version of quotable only um okay and then i wanted to address some of those are the questions from the chat if anybody has questions that haven't been uh bree's been on it with all of the questions she's watching she always yeah she's been cruising through all these questions um but if there's anything that you have questions about that you would like to ask we will talk about it here but in the meantime i'm going to go ahead and address some of the questions that we got prior to the webinar so um let's see here one of the questions is what is the best way to teach coding virtually and i think we've talked a lot about the different ways that you can teach coding virtually this year all of the different resources that you can use ultimately it's up to you you are the expert you know your class situation every single classroom is experiencing different things right now so we can't be the ones to tell you what the best way to do that is however if you're just starting out if it were me and hannah please correct me if you think i'm wrong but i would definitely start with the like virtual kickoff lesson that hannah showed in the virtual resources section and then just give my kids access to the free play prereaders activity encodable that lets them roam and be free to choose whatever coding activity they want to do and that's what i would do with my students especially if i'm if i'm virtual there's lots of videos that can accompany uh the kickoff lesson and also the um the prereader activity uh they're available on your videos page uh if you want to add a video to kind of enrich the lesson for them um but that's what i would do if it were me hannah anything you want to add to that yeah i agree i think that you know we've been adding video lessons to the dashboard we added from february to now i think 30 different videos so if you're unsure about how to introduce coding in a virtual setting over zoom and you have young students um you know it makes sense that that's that's really tricky and hopefully the video lessons that we have available to you are helpful because i do think that you can create a really rich coding lesson by showing a video and then doing an activity encodable with you know limited prep or instruction needed from you the teacher so if you're unsure about how to teach coding you know we have those supports there for you definitely okay we have a question from the audience uh is there a way to uh archive classes and there's not a way to archive classes so that you can bring them back later but you can delete classes permanently so if you just want to remove classes from your clinical dashboard that are from years past you can delete those classes you can also transfer students so if you have your classes from last year still set up and you still see some of the students and you need to move them to their new homeroom you can transfer students from class to class um easily and in bulk on your teacher dashboard just go to support.codable and search transfer and you'll see an article with instructions on how to do that um okay one question that we got previously was uh we use seesaw and canvas with students can they share their work with a class of peers within these learning management systems and yes uh we actually have some and i'll post this link in the chat for you we actually have some seesaw activities set up for codable on our codable blog and you can use those activities if you want to or just take them as inspiration if you want to create your own hour of code codable seesaw activity specific to your class that's what i would suggest doing because you know the situation you know what you want to ask your students to share that would be a good place to start so i'm just going to place that link here for you and that's the link to all of our seesaw activities you can take a look at them and use them with your students it's a great we love seesaw it's a great way to encourage collaboration even if you're you know your students are learning from home um one of the questions we also had was uh what advice would you give to students that think coding is not for them it's a good question um and what about when it's when it gets hard sometimes just trying again is even more frustrating what are more specific strategies for not giving up i love this question and i think hannah just wrote a great blog post about it hannah can you talk a little bit more about it yeah definitely so i had a really similar experience when i was a computer science teacher i was using a program my students were not very interested and there was a lot of frustration happening and i was struggling a lot i'm trying to teach them and get them excited about it so what ended up working for me was really kind of shifting gears and doing more of an emergent curriculum mindset which meant i scrapped my plans and i tried to focus on relevant topics to the students in their real lives and how i could curate lessons about uh what was actually going on and and different creative projects they could create to solve problems uh in the real world so we did a big design thinking unit and different projects where they were solving problems through engineering and then coding in scratch and using other programs to to try to link it all together so yeah i would say you know it's it can be really tricky if they're not showing interest i would keep trying to tweak and modify your lesson plans to see if there's a project or something creative that they can build that makes coding a bit more relevant to them in their real lives and i did just release a blog post about developing problemsolving skills for young children and how it can be tricky but there are some tools that you can do some anchor charts you can try different tips and tricks in that blog for how to develop creative problem solvers and and how to help students when they face that that moment of unsureness how to help them be resilient so i think we can link that blog that blog post in the chat perhaps but definitely check it out it's up on there and if you need more tips or you want to chat about different ways to modify your curriculum to support those students that are struggling i'm happy to connect individually and and we can chat about that awesome thank you yeah i just asked maria she's another codable team member that's hanging back and behind the scenes making this all work i asked her for the link so she can send it to me to post uh oh great great somebody already posted it awesome way to go team um okay so another question uh that we should address um do you have good videos or recommendations as to how to best introduce the hour of code to elementary students who have never coded before yes uh great question i have two videos that i'm going to link in the um chat for you one of them is a video from codable that we created with some codable kiddos and it's just so much fun we made it a few years ago um then explaining what the hour of code is why it's cool why coding is fun um and what you should do you know if you're another kid and you're interested in coding so i'm gonna link to that here and then there is also a video by code.org that i think is really great um that has a lot of celebrities and famous people and um other you know notable people talking about what coding is and why it is um important to learn so that's also linked here um let me check the chat see if we have any other questions nothing so far okay i'll move on to the next um question how do i optimize the use of codeable for a remote only class with students with disabilities what are recommended strategies um so hannah do you want to take this one sure so i would again that remote kickoff lesson that i shared on the virtual learning resources page i think that would be really helpful for students of any developmental level because it does have a lot of pictures and steps that are clearly mapped out so i i think in terms of introducing codable having that kind of map where you can follow slide by slide picture by picture step by step can be really helpful for kids who have just for students who have disabilities so that would be a good place to start for codable because i know it can be pretty overwhelming for some students when they first log in and there's so much going on and it can it can be a little over stimulating so breaking it down into really manageable bitesized pieces is a good first step i would say gretchen did you want to add anything um no i think mainly the the only other thing i would say is that codable is uh not designed for students with disabilities we didn't have that um need in mind when we were designing it um we do have lots of teachers that use it successfully with their students with disabilities we are however not the experts you're the expert so um i would just say you know you know your class best and use your discretion uh when you're you know making choices for your students um we do have a lot of student or teachers in the codable community that use it with you know their students with disabilities i would pose a question on twitter to the to them um and see you know if you get some responses that way um and yeah that that covers it um okay the next question is i teach about 600 students in grades k to five is there a limit to how many students i can assign levels to lessons to uh and no there's not there's no limit on the number of students that you can use codable with um although we do have a question in the chat that is relevant to this so i'll be sure to mention it um classes are limited to 50 students so you can break up classes into sections of 50 if you need to the reason we have a limit is for loading uh concerns but also usability if you can imagine a hundred names scrolling through that as a kindergartener would be a nightmare for you and a nightmare for them so we do limit it to 50 students and if you have um more than 50 students in a class i would suggest breaking them up by alphabetically or in some other way to create classes that make sense for you and for your students um and i think that that covers it so the next question is um our school district has the codable app available to students on the on clevver how should they log in this is a great question we have a lot of clever users and a lot of clever fans and um what i would suggest is different from what we've covered so far in the webinar i would suggest actually logging in directly the way that your students are used to in clever don't deviate from what your students have learned to to do to log into codable um log in and then have them go to that beach cleanup i'm sorry not be clean the hour of code hut that's that we showed you earlier on flustopia um so what you would do is just have them log in with clever and then click on the hour of code hut underneath of the little home and that will direct them to all of the hour of code activities yeah and i included a an image of that hour of code hut in the webinar agenda so you know exactly what image kids are looking for when they log in so hopefully it's easy to find yes definitely okay are there any other questions we've we've covered it all um in just under an hour so um but if anybody has any final questions you'd like us to address um please post them into the chat we'll wait a couple of minutes but um maybe maybe a minute um but i think that we've covered most everything um thank you all so so much for joining us for participating for being brave enough to be a teacher in this wild year we really appreciate you all um i know that it's been difficult i know that there's been a lot of uncertainty um so we really appreciate you all we are glad that you joined us and we are glad you're planning to do the hour of code this year because it's such an important activity for our students um to just get them engaged in learning and get them engaged in learning about a skill that's going to be useful for the rest of their lives so um i think that that's everything we don't have any other questions uh brie just posted the agenda again in the chat so uh everything that we've talked about is linked in there um if you have any other questions you can always reach out to us at support clinical.com thank you all right bye everyone happy hour of code
