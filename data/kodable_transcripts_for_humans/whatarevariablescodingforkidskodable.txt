00:00 - [Music]
00:02 - computer programs contain a lot of
00:04 - information think about some of the
00:07 - games you love to play the code that
00:10 - makes up the program for a game needs to
00:12 - include instructions for everything the
00:14 - player sees and does this would include
00:17 - the setting characters colors objects
00:21 - and interactions just like in a story or
00:23 - a movie scene all of this information is
00:26 - stored in the game code for most games
00:30 - like asteroid Eoin codable almost
00:33 - everything you see is a variable a
00:35 - variable is something that can change or
00:38 - vary so it makes sense that a game would
00:41 - be made up of a bunch of variables right
00:43 - without them nothing would ever change
00:45 - and playing the game would be really
00:47 - boring so what exactly is a variable you
00:51 - can think of a variable like a container
00:53 - that holds information the information
00:56 - or data stored in a variable is called
00:59 - the value let's say you are thirsty so
01:03 - you grab a cup from your cupboard the
01:05 - cup is clear glass and you can see that
01:07 - it is empty you fill the cup up with
01:10 - water now the cup looks like it has
01:12 - changed the color is blue however the
01:15 - cup itself is not different at all it is
01:18 - simply the storage container for the
01:20 - liquid you chose to put in it you can
01:23 - fill it up with lemonade or orange juice
01:25 - or any other liquid and it still won't
01:27 - change the cup itself in this example
01:31 - your cup acts just like a variable and
01:33 - the liquid you put into it is a value so
01:37 - we know variables can hold all different
01:39 - kinds of values just like a cup can
01:42 - store lots of different kinds of liquids
01:44 - encoding we can label a variable based
01:47 - on the type of value that it stores just
01:49 - like you could label the cup based on
01:51 - the liquids inside in programming there
01:54 - are many different types of values that
01:56 - can be stored in a variable button
01:58 - codable we focus on three strings
02:01 - integers and arrays let's break these
02:05 - down really quick some variables can
02:08 - store values that are characters or
02:10 - words called strings
02:12 - strings are everywhere in games from
02:14 - names to instructions to colors anything
02:17 - described with letters if a variable is
02:20 - assigned a string value we can label it
02:23 - a string variable in codable we use
02:27 - colored fuzz balls to represent string
02:29 - variables some variables can store
02:32 - number values called integers in a game
02:35 - these would be helpful for determining
02:37 - volume difficulty or speed these number
02:41 - values are stored in an integer variable
02:44 - in codable we use numbered fuzz balls to
02:47 - represent integers the final type of
02:50 - variable encode abaut is an array this
02:53 - type of variable stores both integers
02:56 - and strings in an ordered list in
02:58 - codable arrays are shown with these
03:01 - brackets and can store both the colored
03:03 - and numbered fuzz balls in sequence
03:06 - remember variables store values that
03:08 - don't have to be permanent
03:10 - just like liquids in a cup the value can
03:13 - change or vary but the variable stays
03:15 - the same now it's your turn practice
03:19 - assigning values to variables in coda
03:22 - bowls astroid a game and game designer
03:24 - an asteroid iya you match the colored
03:28 - fuzzball variables on the left with
03:30 - asteroids of equal value on the right if
03:33 - the variable meets an asteroid of equal
03:36 - value the asteroids will clear let's try
03:39 - one more level that is a bit harder
03:41 - I'll start by storing all the same
03:44 - values that I see in the asteroids let's
03:48 - try it oh oh it looks like I don't need
03:53 - every value I saw that's okay these are
03:56 - variables so as the programmer I can
03:58 - change the values remember we want to
04:01 - keep code short the asteroids will clear
04:04 - themselves if like values match so I
04:07 - just need to blue fuzzball variables and
04:10 - gravity does the rest
04:12 - hooray we kept our code short and
04:15 - cleared the asteroids in game designer
04:18 - you call the shots choose from the many
04:21 - variables you want to change and make
04:23 - the value something different now you
04:27 - can give it a try yourself
04:29 - happy coding
