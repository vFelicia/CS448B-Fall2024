00:18 - how to ask questions and get ideas from
00:20 - other teachers
00:22 - before i begin i realized i don't have a
00:24 - slide for this but i did want to mention
00:25 - it
00:27 - if there's a coding or a stem program
00:28 - that you're curious about
00:30 - like codable or scratch
00:33 - and before you start you you would love
00:36 - to talk to a teacher who's already using
00:38 - it just to see how they're doing it
00:39 - and to learn a little bit more about the
00:41 - practical application
00:44 - i would recommend reaching out to
00:47 - somebody on that team somebody who works
00:49 - on the product like a customer service
00:51 - rep or somebody at the company
00:53 - i can speak from codables experience we
00:55 - have teachers all over the world using
00:57 - codable in
00:58 - a wide variety of educational
01:00 - environments and we would love
01:02 - to connect you with a teacher who is
01:04 - also
01:05 - using that also using codable or
01:07 - whatever program
01:09 - in a similar way to offer insights or to
01:11 - answer questions since
01:14 - they would be able to know some of the
01:15 - ins and outs better than we would since
01:17 - they have a similar teaching experience
01:19 - so that's just one thing i wanted to
01:20 - mention
01:21 - if you have specific questions about a
01:23 - program see if
01:24 - they can't connect you with a teacher
01:26 - who is also using that program i think
01:28 - it's a really nice way to learn
01:31 - okay so two ways to get involved and to
01:34 - get some of your questions answered are
01:36 - webinars and conferences
01:37 - these are two webinars that we love but
01:39 - there are a ton out there
01:41 - that one on the bottom that's computer
01:42 - science for rhode island those are not
01:44 - just rhode island
01:45 - themed webinars they just have a nice
01:47 - section on their website that
01:50 - maps out some free webinars that are
01:51 - coming up that you might be interested
01:54 - in signing up for and then as i
01:56 - mentioned at the beginning
01:57 - we have a couple webinars through
01:59 - codable
02:00 - happening next week on tuesday and then
02:02 - again in october and hopefully we can
02:04 - offer
02:04 - um a lot more in the future as well and
02:07 - then
02:08 - conferences are an option they're a
02:09 - little bit more intensive because you
02:11 - are
02:12 - putting time aside to attend sometimes
02:14 - there is cost involved
02:15 - but it is a great place to meet with
02:18 - like-minded teachers and admin and
02:19 - learn about programs that you didn't
02:22 - even know existed
02:23 - so those are two options to start and
02:26 - then
02:28 - social media is really alive with stem
02:30 - and coding communities they're super
02:32 - active
02:33 - and these are two on facebook that we
02:35 - that we love and then a couple of our
02:37 - favorite instagram influencers stem
02:40 - influencers
02:41 - i mean they're a great place to get
02:42 - ideas like project ideas or classroom
02:45 - ideas and i know that many are really
02:47 - willing
02:48 - to connect and chat i mean they are
02:49 - teachers and parents
02:51 - just like you so that's one other place
02:53 - to go for
02:55 - for quick inspiration if you are
02:56 - interested in learning more about
02:58 - what coding might look like in different
03:01 - classrooms and actually see real
03:02 - pictures and videos from
03:04 - their work

how to ask questions and get ideas from other teachers before i begin i realized i don't have a slide for this but i did want to mention it if there's a coding or a stem program that you're curious about like codable or scratch and before you start you you would love to talk to a teacher who's already using it just to see how they're doing it and to learn a little bit more about the practical application i would recommend reaching out to somebody on that team somebody who works on the product like a customer service rep or somebody at the company i can speak from codables experience we have teachers all over the world using codable in a wide variety of educational environments and we would love to connect you with a teacher who is also using that also using codable or whatever program in a similar way to offer insights or to answer questions since they would be able to know some of the ins and outs better than we would since they have a similar teaching experience so that's just one thing i wanted to mention if you have specific questions about a program see if they can't connect you with a teacher who is also using that program i think it's a really nice way to learn okay so two ways to get involved and to get some of your questions answered are webinars and conferences these are two webinars that we love but there are a ton out there that one on the bottom that's computer science for rhode island those are not just rhode island themed webinars they just have a nice section on their website that maps out some free webinars that are coming up that you might be interested in signing up for and then as i mentioned at the beginning we have a couple webinars through codable happening next week on tuesday and then again in october and hopefully we can offer um a lot more in the future as well and then conferences are an option they're a little bit more intensive because you are putting time aside to attend sometimes there is cost involved but it is a great place to meet with likeminded teachers and admin and learn about programs that you didn't even know existed so those are two options to start and then social media is really alive with stem and coding communities they're super active and these are two on facebook that we that we love and then a couple of our favorite instagram influencers stem influencers i mean they're a great place to get ideas like project ideas or classroom ideas and i know that many are really willing to connect and chat i mean they are teachers and parents just like you so that's one other place to go for for quick inspiration if you are interested in learning more about what coding might look like in different classrooms and actually see real pictures and videos from their work
