00:15 - student engagement and enjoyment of
00:17 - coding curriculum is critical
00:20 - and
00:21 - there is an exciting fun way to combine
00:24 - computer science education
00:26 - with that assessment method we mentioned
00:28 - design scenarios and that is
00:30 - project-based learning this is also a
00:32 - big buzzword i'm sure you've heard about
00:34 - it before but i'd like to touch on it
00:36 - with computer science in mind and kind
00:38 - of give you an outline for
00:40 - how to do project-based learning in your
00:42 - classroom if you're interested but also
00:44 - why it's a really effective tool for
00:47 - measuring and tracking progress for your
00:49 - students
00:52 - all right so i will move on to the next
00:56 - slide
00:59 - all right so what is project-based
01:02 - learning
01:03 - project-based learning i might say pbl
01:06 - is a teaching approach in which
01:08 - students are engaging in and learning
01:11 - through authentic meaningful projects so
01:14 - rather than doing like a summative
01:17 - project at the end you've done your your
01:19 - core curriculum you've reached the end
01:21 - of the unit you're going to do a big
01:23 - project to wrap it up
01:25 - project-based learning means actually
01:27 - embedding the project
01:29 - and the instruction together like the
01:31 - project is the curriculum it's the whole
01:34 - unit so i really loved this quote that
01:37 - describes project-based learning as
01:40 - integrating knowing and doing so
01:42 - students learn knowledge and elements of
01:44 - the core curriculum but then they apply
01:46 - it to solve authentic problems and
01:48 - produce results that matter and your
01:51 - kindergarten first grade and second
01:52 - grade students absolutely can do this
01:55 - i've seen some early elementary teachers
01:57 - kind of shy away from the project-based
02:00 - learning approach because thinking about
02:02 - real-world
02:03 - authentic problems
02:05 - kind of seems big sometimes for our
02:07 - youngest learners but they can handle it
02:09 - and i'll give you an example of a
02:10 - teacher who is doing work like that now
02:15 - so how to implement project-based
02:18 - learning in the classroom as a computer
02:20 - science teacher
02:21 - you may choose to present a problem or a
02:24 - question that relates to technology
02:26 - since that's the subject that you're
02:28 - teaching or you're trying to incorporate
02:30 - into your classroom and you can try to
02:32 - bed embed authenticity into the project
02:36 - by
02:37 - guiding students to examine computer
02:40 - science technology already in the world
02:42 - around them
02:44 - again early elementary students they
02:46 - know what's going on in the world of
02:47 - technology way more than we know and
02:49 - they can tackle
02:50 - a real world problem through coding and
02:53 - programming
02:54 - i do know it can be tricky to come up
02:57 - with a challenging problem or a question
02:59 - for students to solve which is why i
03:02 - definitely recommend following what your
03:04 - students are interested in aim for
03:07 - engagement what we talked about earlier
03:09 - so
03:10 - if your students are interested in
03:12 - topics like protecting the environment
03:14 - or helping animals then you might start
03:17 - with a core essential question related
03:20 - to that subject and then go off of that
03:23 - and the un sustainable development goals
03:26 - that i mentioned
03:27 - back when we were talking about iste
03:30 - um standards that is a great place to
03:33 - start you might recognize that
03:36 - these un goals like i mentioned are
03:38 - they're already iste aligned and you can
03:41 - use them as a resource to guide student
03:44 - learning so
03:45 - this
03:46 - example that you see on the screen this
03:48 - is from a teacher who goes at by at
03:52 - edtech classroom she's on instagram and
03:54 - um and twitter and she
03:58 - honed in on a un sustainable development
04:01 - goal and then asked her students how can
04:03 - we help reduce pollution in our oceans
04:06 - the ideas that they came up with she
04:08 - kind of captured in this web and then
04:10 - from there they developed a project and
04:13 - actually created solutions for this real
04:16 - world challenge and she brought in the
04:19 - codable coding tool to investigate this
04:22 - further what it would mean for keeping
04:24 - beaches clean and how it all connects
04:26 - together so that's a great example of
04:29 - using a resource like the un sustainable
04:32 - development goals like the iste computer
04:34 - science standards and coming up with
04:37 - project ideas from there and then
04:39 - incorporating technology and different
04:41 - coding resources to help out towards the
04:43 - end
04:47 - so why are projects effective evaluation
04:50 - tools we sort of mentioned it when we
04:52 - went over the design scenario as an
04:54 - evaluation method
04:56 - i will just highlight that
04:58 - authentic assessment and evaluation
05:01 - through project-based learning will
05:04 - allow us to
05:06 - like systematically document a child's
05:08 - progress and development because the
05:10 - project happens over time it's not a
05:12 - single day where anyone could be having
05:14 - a bad day they take a test and it
05:17 - demonstrates that
05:18 - they are in x group and not meeting x
05:21 - standards with a project
05:24 - it's it's a longer
05:25 - you know it's a longer time
05:28 - uh it's longer and time consuming and
05:31 - children have to put more effort towards
05:32 - it for a more sustained amount of time
05:35 - so as the teacher will be able to
05:37 - systematically document their progress
05:40 - from the start of the project to the end
05:42 - and depending on the project pbl can
05:45 - develop a child's ability to
05:48 - work both independently and with their
05:50 - peers building teamwork and group skills
05:53 - and there's so many components as i
05:55 - mentioned that it lets the teacher have
05:57 - multiple assessment opportunities like
05:59 - you could assess the planning stage
06:02 - if you're doing research online you
06:04 - could assess how the research
06:06 - works and their typing skills you can
06:08 - move into the actual
06:11 - solution design stage think about how
06:14 - they are thinking outside the box and
06:16 - being innovative
06:17 - basically it allows you the teacher to
06:19 - learn a lot more about
06:22 - the student as a person
06:24 - and as someone who is working on a
06:27 - project that they care about
06:28 - from start to finish
06:31 - i really love pbl because it refocuses
06:34 - education on the student it's not just
06:36 - the curriculum it's it's like student
06:38 - human based and you're able to capture
06:41 - things that can't be taught or measured
06:44 - with an exam they must be
06:46 - like activated through experience like
06:49 - drive passion creativity empathy
06:52 - um resiliency so i love projects they
06:55 - give you a little glimpse at these
06:57 - intangibles that students have to offer
06:59 - they just might not have the right
07:02 - medium to do it
07:03 - and one last thing computer science is a
07:06 - field that is all about the creation and
07:09 - execution of projects producing websites
07:11 - building software creating video games
07:15 - coders are coding for a purpose there's
07:17 - an outcome there's something that
07:18 - they're working towards it's project
07:20 - based in the real world so i love to
07:23 - mirror that at school
07:26 - and have the
07:27 - things that we're using to evaluate
07:29 - learning be
07:30 - what you would use to evaluate a coder
07:33 - in the real world
07:38 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

student engagement and enjoyment of coding curriculum is critical and there is an exciting fun way to combine computer science education with that assessment method we mentioned design scenarios and that is projectbased learning this is also a big buzzword i'm sure you've heard about it before but i'd like to touch on it with computer science in mind and kind of give you an outline for how to do
