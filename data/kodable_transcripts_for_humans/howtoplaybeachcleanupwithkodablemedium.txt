00:05 - imagine if you had to repeat the same
00:07 - steps over and over and over to complete
00:10 - a task for example think about writing
00:13 - your name easy enough right but let's
00:18 - say you needed to write it 10 times or a
00:20 - hundred how about a thousand maybe
00:24 - you're a celebrity and you need to keep
00:26 - up with all the autograph requests
00:29 - suddenly a simple task becomes a lot
00:32 - more intense wouldn't it be great if you
00:35 - could command your name to be written as
00:37 - many times as you needed in programming
00:40 - this would be the perfect time to use a
00:42 - loop a loop is a command used to repeat
00:47 - a part of code until a certain desired
00:49 - process is complete it may seem silly to
00:53 - imagine needing to write your name a
00:55 - thousand times but in reality
00:57 - programmers often need to write
00:59 - thousands of the same line of code in
01:03 - programming we can use a loop to repeat
01:06 - this code without needing to rewrite it
01:09 - again and again encode Abul this is what
01:12 - we use to program a loop this loop ER
01:16 - will repeat to commands a certain number
01:18 - of times to achieve an outcome let's
01:21 - take a look at how this loop can affect
01:24 - your code a block of code like this
01:27 - works the same as code like this the
01:31 - outcome for both is identical your Fuzz
01:35 - will move right down right and down but
01:39 - what do you notice about the two
01:41 - programs the first option is shorter it
01:45 - is only using one loop or command while
01:48 - the second option is for commands and
01:51 - repeats the same commands twice in
01:55 - codable if we want our fuzz to repeat
01:58 - certain actions we can tell it to do so
02:01 - using only one command space instead of
02:04 - multiple this is important because we
02:07 - want to keep our code short to minimize
02:09 - errors and bugs code shouldn't be long
02:13 - than it needs to be which is why in
02:15 - codable there are limited command bins
02:17 - when a loop can and should be used when
02:21 - you are creating your Me's for this
02:23 - activity think about what you can do to
02:25 - repeat patterns if you create patterns
02:29 - that are repeating then the commands use
02:31 - to move your fuzz through the maze will
02:33 - also repeat and you can use a loop to
02:36 - keep code short let's work through a
02:39 - level using loops together start by
02:43 - drawing the path that will allow the
02:44 - fuzz to collect all the trash here we
02:48 - want our fuzz to move right up right up
02:52 - right down right drag the commands into
03:05 - your program to tell your fuzz how to
03:07 - move uh-oh it looks like there are not
03:17 - enough pins to hold all the commands we
03:19 - need let's look to see if there are any
03:22 - patterns of repeating commands in our
03:24 - code here and here after our first
03:30 - command we tell our fuzz to move up
03:33 - right up right these are two commands
03:38 - that are repeating we can use a loop
03:40 - instead this way we take up only one
03:44 - command bin instead of four now we can
03:47 - code the rest of the program and are
03:49 - left with bins to spare when you use a
03:56 - looper your code will run in sequence
03:58 - before the loop and pick up again right
04:01 - after now it's your turn create your
04:05 - maze code your program test it out
