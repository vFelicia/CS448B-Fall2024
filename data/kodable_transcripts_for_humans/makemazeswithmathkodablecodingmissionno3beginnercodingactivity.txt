00:00 - you've probably heard that math is a
00:02 - part of our lives everywhere and that's
00:04 - true
00:05 - for example think about how much math
00:08 - goes into just this cookie
00:10 - you use math when you measure things
00:13 - count things
00:14 - figure out what shape something is
00:17 - or cut it in half
00:18 - but have you ever noticed the math
00:20 - skills you use when you practice coding
00:23 - think about the way you solve a math
00:25 - problem like this
00:27 - there are ordered steps to follow i
00:29 - should solve this problem moving left to
00:31 - right
00:32 - along the way i need to make careful
00:34 - decisions
00:36 - and at the end i will double check my
00:38 - work
00:39 - these are some of the same skills you
00:41 - use when you are coding
00:43 - today you're going to use math skills to
00:46 - design and build your own game level in
00:48 - codables maze maker
00:52 - here's your mission build a maze that
00:54 - includes the shape of a
00:56 - square how many tiles make up each side
00:59 - of your square
01:05 - if i want to build a maze i need to plan
01:07 - ahead
01:08 - first i'll pick a background
01:11 - there are a lot of other tools to choose
01:13 - from
01:14 - i can draw my maze
01:15 - erase if i make a mistake
01:17 - decorations
01:19 - condition tiles and test the maze
01:22 - i'm going to start with the maze tiles
01:25 - do you notice the individual tiles that
01:27 - appear wherever i click
01:29 - we can use them to help us count
01:32 - add
01:33 - [Music]
01:34 - subtract
01:37 - and make certain shapes
01:42 - let's practice this mission together
01:44 - remember your coding mission is to
01:46 - design a maze that includes the shape of
01:48 - a square
01:49 - so i'm going to start by drawing my
01:51 - square
01:52 - we know that a square has sides that are
01:54 - all the same length
01:55 - i think i want my square to have five
01:57 - tiles per side
01:59 - one two three four five
02:03 - one two three four five
02:07 - but this square is not a maze yet
02:09 - i need to connect the square to each
02:11 - side of the maze maker
02:13 - notice how the start tile appears in the
02:15 - far left column
02:18 - and the end tile on the right
02:21 - it's time to place the stars in my maze
02:23 - to make sure it's solvable
02:26 - i'm ready to test my maze
02:29 - i need my fuzz to collect all three
02:31 - stars and get to the finish
02:34 - so i want my fuzz to move right
02:36 - down
02:37 - right
02:38 - up right
02:41 - let's try it
02:44 - [Music]
02:46 - don't worry if you can't solve it on the
02:47 - first try just try again
02:51 - at the start of my square i want my fuzz
02:53 - to turn down
02:55 - but we know our fuzz will continue to
02:57 - roll to the right until it hits a wall
02:59 - we need something right here in our maze
03:02 - to tell our fuzz to change directions
03:04 - good news is we can always go back and
03:06 - edit the maze
03:10 - these are condition tiles we can use
03:12 - them to change our fuzz's path in our
03:14 - program
03:16 - i'm going to put one right here that
03:18 - will tell my fuzz if pink
03:21 - then turn down
03:23 - now that i've edited my maze i'm ready
03:25 - to try again
03:28 - can't forget to add that condition to
03:30 - the program
03:31 - if pink
03:33 - then turn down
03:37 - we did it remember in programming and in
03:40 - math we test we make fixes and try again
03:43 - until the problem is solved
03:45 - now i can save my maze
03:49 - you're up next log in to codable select
03:52 - the maze maker and complete your mission
03:55 - build a maze that includes the shape of
03:57 - a square
03:58 - how many tiles make up each side of your
04:00 - square
04:02 - get creative and happy coding
