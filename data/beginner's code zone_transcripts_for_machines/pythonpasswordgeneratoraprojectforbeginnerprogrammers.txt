foreign that will generate randomly strong passwords so basically it's a strong password generator program and here I have already created an file in which we are going to write our program so in order a password to be strong it must follow two criterias first one is that it must contain at least a character from digit from lowercase from upper case letter and from symbols and second condition is that it must have a larger length so these two conditions must be followed by a password for it to be a strong password to create a program which will generate a strong password first of all we need to get all these characters in this category and to do so we can either create a list of all digits manually like creating a list containing all the digits in string form and similarly for lowercase letter and uppercase letter and symbols but this process is a bit time consuming so instead of doing this we can use a model named string to import string model use import string and now inside our digit variable we can just use string model and its digits function now this will create a string name digit containing all the digits 0 to 9. let's have a look on it yeah here we can see digits give us a string containing all the digits from 0 to 9 so for now let's remove it and create string of lowercase letters name it lower case and we have a method name as Sky lower case for getting all the lower case strings and similar to this we have a method upper sky for getting all the characters of uppercase letters now to use symbols just use string Dot and penetration is the method name for letting all the symbols till now what we have done is imported string model and with the help of string module we have stored all the digits value in digit variable and all the lower case letters in this lower case variable and so on for uppercase and symbols and no before generating a password let's create a temporary password uh I'm giving it a name of temp now this is an empty string variable and so our first condition for a strong password was that it must contain at least one character from all of these to follow this condition we will manually just add or concatenate any one character from all of this and to choosing a random character you can use a random module to use random model we first need to import it now we have a method name choice in random model which will choose any single character from our given variable so here our variable name is digit now what this line will do is it will add a random digit from 0 to 9 to our temporary password so we need to do it for all these remaining three also let me just copy and paste it change it for to lowercase for adding a lowercase letter and uppercase and lastly we have symbols so now we have created a temporary password named temp of length 4 containing uh one character from all of these no so our first criteria for password is fulfilled uh it must have a larger length so to get length let's ask the landform user and store it in a variable name length to ask it from user we will just use it input and enter the message you want to show here just write enter the password length now user will give us a length for password which he or she required and now we can see here our password must at least contain a length of 4 to fulfill our first condition if a user gives a length lesser than 4 then we will give it some message like please enter the length of greater than or equal to 4 so to check that we can use if else statement and if length less than 4 then just simply show a message that length must be greater than or equal to 4. and if length is great already greater than or equal to 4 then we will just give the user randomly generated strong password to add more characters in our password we can use for Loop for I in range and length minus 4. we are subtracting 4 from total length because we are already taken uh four characters in our temporary password we just need to add remaining ones to our password so to add more characters in our password we can now use a choice from any of these strings so let's just create a variable which contains all of these characters and name it I'm naming it total and for a combination I'm just adding all these string variables into a single variable now total contains this total variable contains all the string containing digits lowercase letter up against letter and symbol now to increase the length of our password I'll just randomly choose one character so to lose it just add a random factor from total variable this will generate a temporary string of password for given length now we can see here that every time we run this code our password will contain its first character as a digit and then a lowercase and so on we don't want it to generate a password in this defined manner so what we can do is we can Shuffle the character since from our temporary password and then generate our main password from it and for shuffling first of all we need to convert this temporary string variable into a list and so this will convert our temperatures three string variable into a list and now we can apply a random shuffle method on temp and now our temp will contain shuffled characters so there will be no predefined manner for our password and to convert this shuffled list of characters into our main password we can just create a empty string variable password and add every cutter of our temp to password now we have got a password string containing our required strong password and we can simply print it to show our generated password so that's it for our program now so let's run it it's asking for a length I'm giving it a length of 10 so it generates me a password of 10 characters let's see one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and now check whether it following our criteria for strong password so it contains at least one digit it contains a lowercase letter and uppercase letter and at least a symbol so first condition is fulfilled and it also have a length greater than equal to 4 so this program is working fine now let me check for uh length lesser than 4 so it gives us a message that length must be greater than or equal to four so we can see it's working just fine let's try to generate some more passwords of some random length and we can see it's working just fine and giving us some very strong randomly generated password which are not in predefined manner also like here first letter is capital here it's slower here it's symbol so yeah that's it for our program it's working fine now let me give you um quick summary about what we have done so far so first of all we imported a string model and a random model and we use this string model to generate a string variables containing all digits or lowercase letters uppercase letters and symbols using this these string Methods and after that here we have generated our total named variable which contains all the characters of these digits login and symbols after that we have created a temporary string variable which is empty initially and now to fulfill our first condition of containing at least one character from all of these we have manually added one character from all of this you with the help of choice method from random model and here our length of temporary password has already become 4 and now we are asking the user to give us a length for password and now after that we are checking whether the length is less than 4 or greater and equal so if user gives us a length less than four then we'll just simply tell the user that length must be greater than or equal to 4. and if it is greater than or equal to 4 then we will just simply work on our password and we have already added four characters in our temporary password so the remaining length of past characters will be added into our temporary variable using this for Loop and now our choice will be from this list containing all of these character not from just single string so after creating a temporary password which is equal to the given length first of all we created a list from our password and after that we shuffled our password and to store it in a string we have created a password string variable and we have added every character of stamp in our password string and after that we just printed the password so this was everything about our program for generating strong passwords now I hope you understood it and do comments if you have any doubts in the comment section and please like And subscribe to my channel thank you
