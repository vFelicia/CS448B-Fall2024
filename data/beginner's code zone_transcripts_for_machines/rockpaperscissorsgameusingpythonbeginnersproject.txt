Welcome All in This video I will be teaching you how to create a rock paper scissor cave in Python this is the game we are going to build on running it will give us an option for selecting game points then say five then it asks sir for a choice sir I am choosing paper after hitting enter it shows me which computer is true so here computer choose season and as Caesar bits paper computer got a point and clear about zero point now it's again asking for a choice let's say go now it's in computer also choose row so it's in time no points to anyone now let's choose another option I chose this and come to the choose paper so either bit paper I got one point So currently score is one one and when the score of any of player reach 5 then Game Stop final winner will be clear so this is the game we have to build today let's start creating it foreign keeping it in mind we will be creating our game first of all create a list of choices enter the name of your choice here we have rock paper and scissor these are the choices which users can choose during a and after that we are also keeping note on points of player user so initially make them zero first of all let's play clear words as people will give it value 0 similarly for computer points let's say three points and give it also available these are the points from and these are for clear now we will ask user to enter the game point so so that we can create a variable name point and as the game points will be of integer type so use 8 then we have to use input for taking inputs and here we can write down message let's say enter the game points after that we know that game is going to run until any one of player hits the game point so let's play a game our game points are five flow earlier than player then also Game Stops there so for this condition we can write trial P points are less than points which are the total game part and C points are also less than points so let's I'm creating a variable name layer for storing user choice and for taking a string input just use input directly and give you a message here I'm saying you want choice now user will have to choose one out of these rock paper and figure and the value which user enter will get stored in this player variable after that we have to get a choice from computer also let's create a variable computer for getting computer choice and now it's completely is going to play it has to randomly choose from these three choices for choosing a random number via random class in Python so we can import use it by writing this import random and now simply write random Dot end of class okay inside this you Choice parameters you can write the list name for which our choice to be made so here we are going to make a choice from this Choice list so I'm writing it's here let me just quickly show you how this random feature and this choice is working import random create a list and ask something you need like two four five six and I am printing a random choice list of choices this level contain two four five six and I run this code then my output will be one of these two four five six here it's giving me five when I again run it it's all so giving five then two two four I hope this random draw if the third is clear to you now let's get back to our code first of all let's check if there is a tie condition or not you when a time will occur a time will occur if computer and player both have selected the same choice so for checking it we can use if player is equal to computer then we simply print it's a type or else if what we are going to check is player in Choice means user first discount this list only and if that condition meets then we will have to check but our some future choose so our computer have three choices to select if computer call it was broke will continue to choose a rock another condition can be if computer choose season and other will be a computer Choice paper if computer chose Rock then we have to check what player choose so player is equal to is equal to figure or other condition can be this layer is equal to paper and the third condition we don't have to check for 0 because if player also chooses Rock and computer is also choosing lock then this condition will be got here only our code this part of code is not be executed so only these two conditions are can occur if computers to read the Rope here computer is choosing Rock and player is choosing so in our game rules rock is beating these are Prince computer is beating players so who will get a increasing Point computers three point will be increased by 0.31 plus is equal to one this will increase the moment so computer and otherwise player wants me the increase now coming to the Caesar part let me just paste the code here and if computer choose a Caesar then player must have chosen from broke or paper here because Caesar condition will be again caught here and check for rock and scissor so rock bit season creates player is beating computer so player point will be increased and for paper and figure Caesar is beating paper so Caesar is beating paper computers beating here so 0.4 computer will increase now similarly for this condition we have Caesar and broke Choice board player and for paper and scissor again Caesar bits people means player is beating the computer so player will get a point and for broken paper paper will beat broke so computer will get a point after that we can just check who on so for final result when this file after a while condition means one of the player reached the game points you can just check if People's Player points are greater than C points means computer points then just print you want is playable here otherwise else print computer one can do some other changes like every time we can print what computer chose to choice is and then pass the computer's Choice here we have still every choice is made we can print current score of player simply print player and after comma write the variable name for Clear points just and again give a comma and inside this inverted commas right momentum then after comma write the computer codes enter the game points let's say three first of all make a choice I'm choosing block their computer choose paper and as Paper Bits row so computer point now I am selecting paper computer choose Rock I got a point it's a Time I got point and finally when I reach three points which are game points then it shows me who won if computer reached three points earlier then it shows and one more thing I missed was that if players choice is on is not from this Choice list then we have to give a message that leave now Choice phone paper when user write something else other than choices then it will display a message so that's it for this video you can do other modifications also on your own like every time a point is incremented then display that computer got a point or player got a point
