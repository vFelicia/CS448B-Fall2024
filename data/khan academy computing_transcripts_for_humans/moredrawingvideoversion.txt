00:00 - Let's explore more
of this whole drawing thing.
00:03 - What can we make besides rectangles?
00:05 - We can make ovals using the word ellipse,
00:07 - which is another command
the computer knows.
00:09 - We actually have a special
programming word for commands.
00:12 - We're going to call them functions.
00:14 - I'll be using the word function
from now on just to mean command.
00:18 - We'll go ahead and write
the function name ellipse,
00:20 - and then ( ) and a ;
00:23 - It's not working!
00:24 - We have this error message
talking about parameters,
00:26 - whatever those are.
00:27 - Can you see what we're missing,
by comparing what we just wrote with rect?
00:30 - When we just type ellipse,
we aren't telling it the numbers,
00:33 - like we did for the rectangle.
00:35 - These numbers here are called parameters.
00:37 - We say that we pass parameters
into functions,
00:40 - and they control how the function behaves.
00:45 - Without the parameters,
00:46 - the program doesn't know
where you want your ellipse,
00:48 - or how big to make it.
00:50 - Now that error message makes
a little more sense.
00:52 - Let's go ahead and pass in
four parameters again,
00:54 - to control how far over,
how far down, how wide,
00:58 - and how tall we want that ellipse to be.
01:00 - Just like before, we can have some fun
and move around our ellipse,
01:03 - and even make it grow and shrink.
01:08 - Now that we've seen the basics,
let's try drawing a big ellipse
01:11 - right in the middle of the canvas.
01:14 - The first question you might have is,
where's the middle again?
01:17 - Just to review,
we have this upper left, 0,
01:20 - and the right, if you remember, is 400, 
and the bottom is 400 as well.
01:25 - So if we think,
"Where would the middle be?"
01:27 - We would say, "It's gonna
to be half of 400 over, so 200.
01:31 - Then half of 400 down, so 200."
01:33 - We can go ahead and do that.
01:35 - Let's make our ellipse function,
01:36 - we'll pass the parameters in,
and make it pretty big.
01:41 - There it is!
01:43 - Just for fun, let's put
a rectangle there too.
01:46 - We'll say rect(200, 200 as well,
and maybe a little bit smaller. 100, 100);
01:50 - Hm, this is kind of interesting.
01:53 - What does this little experiment show us?
01:55 - Well, we can see that
that 200, 200 point
01:58 - is actually saying where we should put
the center of the ellipse.
02:01 - But for rectangles it's different,
because for rectangles
02:04 - the 200, 200 says where we should put
this upper left corner of the rectangle.
02:09 - That's really important to remember
when we're trying to position our shapes.
02:14 - Now let's move on to simple lines.
02:16 - That function name
is just going to be line.
02:19 - We can pass it four parameters again,
02:21 - but a line doesn't really have
a size like a rectangle, does it?
02:25 - So what will these numbers control?
02:28 - The first and the second parameters,
just like before,
02:31 - say how far over and down
the line should start.
02:34 - Whereas the second two parameters--
02:36 - or sorry, the second set of parameters,
the 90 and the 200--
02:40 - are going to specify how far over
and how far down the line should end.
02:46 - Now that we understand how that works,
02:48 - let's look at something that's going
to seem really weird at first.
02:52 - What happens if I make the rectangle start
in that upper left corner,
02:56 - again specifying that upper left corner
of the rectangle as well?
03:00 - And then really big.
03:03 - We can even make it that big,
but that's a little bit too big, I think.
03:07 - We see that it's gradually starting
to make that ellipse disappear.
03:11 - We can actually make it
disappear completely.
03:14 - Now we're wondering where it went.
03:17 - What the program does is it actually
draws your shapes in order.
03:21 - First it draws that ellipse,
then it draws that rectangle on top,
03:24 - and then it draws the line.
03:26 - So that ellipse is still there,
it's just, as you saw, underneath.
03:30 - This is an important point to remember
03:32 - because what would happen
if we drew our line first?
03:36 - We just wouldn't see it at all, would we?
03:38 - You might do that in your programs
and wonder, "Hey, where did my line go?"
03:41 - The idea is that it is there,
it's just being hidden right now
03:45 - both by the ellipse
and also by that rectangle.
03:50 - We can affect which shapes
are drawn on top of which other shapes
03:53 - just by changing the order
that we write them in our program.
03:58 - Now, I just want to introduce
a couple of technical terms
04:01 - before we finish.
04:02 - Just like you might have learned in math,
04:04 - we can use the letter x
to mean how far over
04:07 - like we've been talking about,
04:09 - and the letter y to mean how far down.
04:11 - That might seem a little bit weird
if you're not used to it,
04:14 - but it's easier to say than
"how far over and how far down"
04:17 - every single time.
04:19 - The first two parameters
to our ellipse, for example,
04:22 - are saying that x should be at 200
and y should be at 229.
04:28 - There you have it,
04:30 - just the same thing as saying
"how far over and how far down".
04:33 - A second really good question
you might have is,
04:36 - "What units have we been using
this whole time?
04:38 - Are we saying 200 centimeters,
200 inches, 200 miles?"
04:42 - We're using units called 'pixels',
04:45 - and a pixel is a tiny little point
on your screen.
04:48 - This canvas actually happens
to be 400 pixels wide.
04:52 - That's why we always say
that this upper left corner is 0,
04:56 - and over here is 400,
because it's 400 pixels.
05:01 - Similarly, when we say 200,
we actually mean 200 pixels,
05:04 - and you probably get the idea.
05:07 - Fantastic!
05:08 - Now you know all about the functions
line, ellipse, and rect,
05:10 - and their parameters.
05:12 - We covered a lot, but just stick with it,
keep exploring,
05:14 - and you'll get the hang of it soon.
