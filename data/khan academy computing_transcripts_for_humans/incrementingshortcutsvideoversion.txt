00:01 - Remember the three steps 
of making an animation?
00:03 - We start out by making some variables
outside the draw loop,
00:06 - and then inside the draw loop
we use those variables
00:08 - in our drawing code.
00:10 - So we've got a variable 
for the x position,
00:12 - one for the y position, 
one for the ballWidth,
00:14 - and one for the ballHeight.
00:16 - And then, at the very end,
00:17 - we change those variables 
a little bit every time,
00:20 - so x is going to be 
the old value of x, plus 1,
00:22 - so it's going to be increasing every time;
00:24 - y is going be the old value of y, minus 2,
00:27 - so y will be decreasing every time;
00:29 - ballWidth is going to get the old value
of ballWidth times 0.99.
00:35 - So since 0.99 is less than 1, 
we're going to see ballWidth decreasing.
00:39 - And ballHeight is going to be
the old value of ballHeight
00:41 - divided by 1.01, which is greater than 1,
00:45 - and so we're also going to see 
ballHeight decreasing.
00:47 - So if I press Restart, you can see
00:50 - all of these attributes 
of the ball changing.
00:53 - So if you look at 
these four lines of code,
00:56 - you'll notice that 
they all follow a similar pattern.
00:59 - We've got a variable, 
then an equals sign,
01:01 - then the same variable, some operator --
plus, minus, times, divide --
01:06 - and some number, okay?
01:08 - And this pattern is so common 
in programming,
01:11 - and programmers are so lazy,
that they decided,
01:14 - "Hey! Since we use this pattern so much,
01:16 - "Shouldn't there be 
an easier way to type it?"
01:19 - And so they made a shortcut, 
and the shortcut goes like this:
01:22 - Instead of saying "x gets x plus 1",
01:24 - I could say "x plus equals 1." Got it?
01:29 - And instead of saying y gets y minus 2,
I could say "y minus equals 2."
01:36 - And instead of saying 
ballWidth gets ballWidth times 0.99,
01:41 - I can say -- you guessed it --
"ballWidth times equals 0.99"
01:48 - Finally, instead of saying
01:49 - ballHeight gets ballHeight divided by 1.01
01:53 - we can say 
"ballHeight divides equals 1.01."
01:57 - So for all of these, what it does is
01:59 - it takes the value of the variables,
02:01 - so ballWidth, and then this operator,
02:04 - and then multiplies it by 0.99.
02:06 - So it's going to say, 
"ballWidth times 0.99"
02:09 - and then store it back 
in the variable, ballWidth.
02:12 - And if I press Restart you can see
02:13 - our animation looks the same as before.
02:16 - And now you get to be lazy too!
