00:00 - - [Voiceover] Here I'm
checking out a webpage
00:02 - that a student made about Joan of Arc.
00:05 - And it's a really good-looking webpage.
00:07 - I really like it.
00:09 - So I'm curious what CSS styles
00:11 - are making it look the way it looks.
00:13 - Now, I've got the code right here,
00:15 - so I could just look through it
00:17 - and get a feel this way,
00:19 - but I can also use "Inspect Element"
00:22 - to figure it out even faster.
00:26 - Let me show you.
00:27 - Let's say I want to know
about this text here
00:31 - and what's making it
look the way it looks.
00:33 - I'm going to right-click on it,
00:36 - click "Inspect Element," wait
for this thing to pop up.
00:41 - So we can see the text is highlighted,
00:43 - this is a '' tag here,
and it has a class name.
00:47 - And now I can see, I
have this "Styles" panel.
00:51 - This is where all the CSS
00:53 - for a particular element shows up.
00:55 - And we can see all the different rules
00:58 - that apply to it, and what
order they get applied.
01:00 - So this 'title' rule is making it so that
01:03 - it's center-aligned and
bold, we can see that.
01:07 - And this other rule,
the 'i1', is making it
01:11 - so that it has a .9m font size
01:14 - and .26 opacity.
01:16 - OK, cool, now I might think that maybe
01:19 - it should be more opaque
01:21 - to be a little more readable.
01:22 - I can actually just go in here
01:24 - and play with it, and
see what it looks like.
01:27 - And this will just update the preview.
01:30 - It's not actually updating their code.
01:33 - It's just updating how it looks
01:34 - in the browser right now.
01:36 - If I wanted them to update their code,
01:38 - I have to tell them like
01:39 - "Hey, why don't you try this instead?
01:41 - "I think this will be more readable."
01:43 - So I can play around with
any of these values here.
01:47 - I can also add new properties.
01:49 - Oh, that was big.
01:50 - So if I think that maybe it
should be a different color,
01:54 - I could go in and say 'color' and then
01:59 - it gives me a bunch to pick from.
02:01 - Or, I can write in a hexadecimal,
02:07 - and then I can get a little color-picker,
02:09 - and say I really like this green instead.
02:15 - So I can just really easily
play around with things
02:19 - and see what they look like.
02:21 - So when is this useful?
02:23 - Well it's useful if you're
curious about the CSS
02:25 - of another person's webpage
02:27 - and you're trying to understand
02:29 - how they achieved some particular effect.
02:31 - It's also useful if you're working
02:35 - on the design of a webpage that maybe
02:37 - you don't have access to the HTML for.
02:40 - You can go in, make some CSS changes,
02:42 - and then forward on those suggestions
02:44 - to whoever can change the HTML.
02:47 - And it's also just kind of fun
02:49 - to mess with other people's webpages.
