00:00 - - [Instructor] Listen, folks,
the CSS text properties
00:03 - are never ending.
00:04 - Let me show you a few more.
00:06 - What if I want to change the spacing
00:09 - between the lines in my song lyrics?
00:12 - I could use the line-height property
00:15 - and specify something like 15px,
00:19 - or maybe better would be 1.5em,
00:23 - and that makes the line height 150%
00:26 - of whatever the text size was.
00:28 - Now, what if I want my song
lyrics to be center aligned?
00:32 - I could use the text-align
property and specify center.
00:36 - I could also change it
to right or justify,
00:39 - though I think that would look a bit odd.
00:42 - What if I wanna underline
my main paragraph?
00:46 - I can use the text-decoration property
00:48 - and specify underline.
00:53 - What if I want to remove
the underline from my links,
00:56 - like that link to Wikipedia?
00:58 - Well, the browser has
a default set of styles
01:01 - it applies to everything
01:02 - like text-decoration: underline for links,
01:05 - but we can use CSS to override
01:08 - the browser's default styles
and say text-decoration: none.
01:12 - Just add this rule here,
a, text-decoration: none,
01:20 - and you see now it's no longer underlined,
01:23 - but we should be careful when we do that,
01:25 - because the defaults are
usually picked for a reason.
01:27 - If links aren't underlined,
01:29 - how will people know that they're links?
01:31 - What if they never click them,
01:32 - because they think
they're just normal text?
01:35 - If we do remove that underline,
we should be making sure
01:38 - that the links look
significantly different
01:40 - in some other way.
01:42 - Otherwise, we'll make users
sad, and sad users make me sad,
01:46 - they should make you sad too.
01:49 - I could tell you about
text properties all day,
01:51 - but I won't, because we
have so much more to cover.
01:54 - There are hundreds of CSS properties,
01:55 - and browsers are adding more every year.
01:58 - I probably won't ever tell
you about all of them,
02:00 - but hopefully, I can tell you
enough to get you excited,
02:03 - and then if you're wondering
if there's a CSS property
02:05 - for some style and it's not
in our documentation here,
02:08 - you can just visit your local
search engine and find out.
02:11 - For example, if you're
wondering if there's a way
02:13 - to add drop shadow to your text,
02:15 - just search CSS text
shadow on the internet,
02:18 - and you'll see lots of results.
02:19 - Generally, being able to
search the internet for answers
02:22 - to your questions is a
really important skill
02:24 - for a web developer,
02:25 - because so many people have
had the same questions as you,
02:27 - and 99.9% of the time,
the answer is out there,
02:32 - you just have to get good at finding it.
