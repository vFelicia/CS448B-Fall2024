00:00 - - When we write a program,
we are figuring out a way
00:02 - to turn the brilliant ideas
in our head into actual code.
00:07 - Here I want to talk about a technique
00:08 - that many programmers use to do that
00:11 - and it's what we call "pseudocode".
00:13 - Now pseudocode is probably a
word you've never heard before
00:17 - but basically, it's code
that looks a lot like English
00:21 - or really, whatever language
you like to talk in.
00:25 - Well, okay, that may not make sense
00:27 - so let's talk through an actual example.
00:30 - So let's say that I want to
draw a nice, symmetrical face.
00:34 - So I might start by looking
at myself in the mirror
00:36 - and maybe sketching it out
00:37 - and seeing, okay well
I have this oval face,
00:40 - I have two eyes and
they're about at this level
00:44 - and this is where the
center of the face is
00:46 - and now I have an idea for what
I want my face to look like.
00:51 - So, I'll start writing it in pseudocode.
00:55 - So let's see, the first
thing we want to do is
00:58 - draw the face which is
an oval in the center.
01:02 - Then we'd want to draw the two eyes,
01:05 - which are two ovals, about
two thirds up the face
01:11 - and maybe one fifth the size of the face.
01:15 - Not exact math there, just
looking at my own face.
01:18 - And then we draw the mouth which is a line
01:20 - going halfway across the face
01:24 - and maybe one third of the way up.
01:29 - So, notice how I write
my pseudocode as comments
01:32 - by starting each line
with the two slashes here.
01:36 - That way I can write my
pseudocode in the program itself
01:39 - and not have to worry about
getting any syntax errors
01:43 - because the program will ignore comments.
01:46 - Now that I've written this in pseudocode,
01:48 - I can spend the time to turn each
01:51 - of these lines of pseudocode
into actual bits of code.
01:55 - Alright, so let's see.
01:56 - For the face, an oval in the center.
01:58 - Well that I'll use the
ellipse function for
02:01 - and I'll figure out the
center of the screen here
02:05 - and figure out a nice size.
02:08 - Okay, that looks good.
02:10 - For the eyes, once again
those are ellipses.
02:12 - Everything on my face is
an ellipse, I'm very round.
02:17 - It's going to be, let's
see, we'll do some math here
02:19 - to get the eyes at a nice place
02:23 - and make them about fit the size.
02:27 - Okay, that looks good for the first eye,
02:29 - I'll just copy and paste
to make the next eye.
02:31 - Great.
02:33 - Now, I can even leave my pseudocode
02:35 - for a friend to implement
and they probably could
02:37 - because I've given this
really nice description.
02:40 - So I'm going to do that here
because we're friends, right?
02:45 - So you might think this is silly,
02:48 - why are we going through the effort
02:50 - to write our program twice,
first in human language
02:53 - and then in program language?
02:55 - Well, this example was pretty simple
02:57 - but pretty soon you'll be
building more complex programs
03:00 - and it may be hard for you
to keep the whole program
03:03 - in your head before coding it,
03:05 - so what I usually do is
write the general idea
03:07 - in pseudocode first and
then I'll spend more time
03:12 - on the details of each part of that idea,
03:15 - converting each line of
pseudocode into real code.
03:19 - I think you'll find once
you start using pseudocode,
03:22 - you'll do it more and more.
03:24 - Try it in your next program and see.
