00:00 - - You know how we made
something that looked
00:02 - like a box in the last talk through
00:04 - by making this div and then
giving it a background color?
00:08 - Well, actually, every
element on your webpage
00:11 - is considered a box by the browser,
00:14 - whether or not it looks like a box to you.
00:16 - This heading is a box.
00:18 - This paragraph is a box.
00:20 - Even this span that we made is a box.
00:24 - Some of the boxes are big.
00:26 - Some are small.
00:28 - Some are in line, like this span.
00:31 - Some are block, like the div.
00:33 - But they're all considered boxes.
00:36 - Why does this matter?
00:38 - Because there's something
called The Box Model,
00:41 - which you can see in the
diagram I just pasted in.
00:44 - Every element's box has four parts,
00:46 - the actual content, the padding,
the border, and the margin.
00:51 - We can use CSS to modify the
padding, border, and margin.
00:54 - So you'll understand soon
what those really are.
00:57 - Let's start with the margin.
00:59 - That's the transparent around the box
01:01 - that separates the box
from other elements.
01:05 - We'll specify a margin using
our favorite unit, pixels.
01:09 - To add 15 pixels of margin on every side
01:11 - of the official Info
Box, we can just write
01:15 - Margin: 15px.
01:21 - See the change that made?
01:23 - What if we want a different amount
01:24 - of margin on each side?
01:26 - Like, more on the top/bottom
than the left/right?
01:29 - We can write those amounts
01:30 - in clockwise order, starting from the top.
01:33 - So top 15px, right 0px,
bottom 10px, left 6px.
01:43 - Or we can use specific
properties for each side,
01:46 - if we only want to specify a few sides.
01:48 - Like, if we want to have some space
01:50 - around the cat picture on the right,
01:55 - and then we also just
want some on the bottom,
02:00 - and we're happy to have the default
02:02 - margin for the other sides.
02:05 - There's also a special value for margin
02:07 - that will help us do something
fancy with our pages.
02:10 - To show you that, I'm going to add a div
02:13 - around the entire page and
give it an ID of container.
02:18 - And let's put this back here
so it contains everything.
02:23 - Now I'm going to add a rule for that div
02:27 - to give it a width of 400px, and I want
02:31 - to center it on the page.
02:33 - I could specify a margin left 100 pixels,
02:38 - because that looks
centered to me, but it may
02:41 - not look centered to
you, because your browser
02:42 - might be bigger or smaller.
02:44 - What we want is to be able to say,
02:46 - "Give it how ever much margin it needs,
02:48 - "so that it's got equal
margin on both sides."
02:52 - That is exactly what margin: auto; does,
02:56 - and it's a great what to
center divs on a page.
03:00 - Now that we've centered that div,
03:02 - we might want to make
it even more distinct
03:04 - by adding a border around the edge of it.
03:06 - Using the CSS border property,
03:09 - let's add a red border to that div.
03:13 - We type "border" and then we need to
03:15 - specify three aspects of the border,
03:17 - thickness, style, and color.
03:19 - For a thin border, we can just type "1px."
03:22 - For a solid line, nothing fancy.
03:24 - We'll just type "solid,"
and to make it red
03:28 - I'll pop in my RGB color picker
and pick a nice, fiery red.
03:35 - Okay, just like with margin,
03:38 - we can specify the border
for just, like, one side.
03:41 - If we want a really thick,
purple border on the top,
03:46 - we'll add another property,
border-top: 10px solid purple.
03:54 - Cool.
03:56 - Now, let's add a frame to the image
03:58 - and play around with border styles.
04:01 - Going up to our cute cat.
04:04 - Let's see, border: 6px.
04:07 - Let's try groove red.
04:11 - No, no, I don’t like groove.
04:13 - Let's try double.
04:15 - Let's try ridge.
04:17 - Ah-ha! Now that looks like a frame.
04:20 - Okay how about a border around
04:22 - our Official Info?
04:24 - Let's see, border.
04:26 - Let's not make it too big, 2 pixels.
04:28 - Let's try dotted and then let's
pick a - just a subtle gray.
04:35 - Let me try dashed instead.
04:37 - Okay, that's what I want.
04:39 - Now with all these borders, something
04:41 - is bothering me a little.
04:42 - Actually, something's bothering me a lot.
04:46 - See how the text is butting up
04:48 - next to the border in the container
04:50 - and butting against the
text in the Official Info?
04:54 - That's so gross looking, and it makes
04:56 - it harder to read the text.
04:59 - That is where padding comes in.
05:01 - Whenever your elements have
background colors or borders,
05:03 - you almost always want to add padding
05:06 - to put a bit of space between
the contents and the edges.
05:09 - Let's add some padding to the container.
05:12 - Just let's do 15px all
around the container.
05:17 - Oh, so much better.
05:19 - Let's add - let's just add some padding
05:21 - to our Official Info.
05:22 - Let's see, padding: 6 pixels.
05:25 - Oh, beautiful.
05:27 - Now, we don’t need to add padding
05:28 - to the image, since images actually
05:30 - look good inside frames like that.
05:33 - And there you have it, the Box Model.
05:35 - Margin, border, and padding.
05:37 - I used big values and bright colors
05:38 - to show them off to you, but my page
05:40 - does look a bit cheesy now.
05:42 - If you want your page to
look sleek and sophisticated,
05:45 - try using more subtle whites and grays.
05:48 - Whatever you do, make sure
you use these properties,
05:50 - because you'll have a big effect on how
05:52 - your page looks and feels.

Cleaned transcript:

You know how we made something that looked like a box in the last talk through by making this div and then giving it a background color? Well, actually, every element on your webpage is considered a box by the browser, whether or not it looks like a box to you. This heading is a box. This paragraph is a box. Even this span that we made is a box. Some of the boxes are big. Some are small. Some are in line, like this span. Some are block, like the div. But they're all considered boxes. Why does this matter? Because there's something called The Box Model, which you can see in the diagram I just pasted in. Every element's box has four parts, the actual content, the padding, the border, and the margin. We can use CSS to modify the padding, border, and margin. So you'll understand soon what those really are. Let's start with the margin. That's the transparent around the box that separates the box from other elements. We'll specify a margin using our favorite unit, pixels. To add 15 pixels of margin on every side of the official Info Box, we can just write Margin 15px. See the change that made? What if we want a different amount of margin on each side? Like, more on the top/bottom than the left/right? We can write those amounts in clockwise order, starting from the top.
