00:01 - - [Voiceover] So we already
made this super-cool
00:03 - variable for Winston's
eye size, which has been
00:05 - really helpful because it
saves us a lot of typing
00:07 - when we want to change the
size of Winston's eyes.
00:10 - Remember, before we had
to type the same number
00:12 - four times whenever we wanted to
00:14 - change the size of his eyes.
00:15 - But can we use variables
to replace numbers
00:17 - when they're not all the same?
00:19 - Like, what if I wanted to move
Winston over a little bit?
00:21 - I could change each of
these x coordinates but
00:23 - they're not all the same anyway so I can't
00:26 - just replace them all with some variable.
00:27 - But wait.
00:29 - Once I assign a number to a variable
00:30 - I can use that variable exactly as if
00:32 - it were that number.
00:33 - Which means, I can use
variables in math expressions.
00:37 - So how about this?
00:38 - Let's make a variable for
the x position of Winston.
00:40 - Call it var x, simple enough.
00:44 - Okay, now let's give it the value of the
00:46 - x coordinate of Winston's face.
00:48 - So his face is being
drawn at x coordinate 200.
00:51 - So we're going to say var x gets 200.
00:55 - Now I can replace this number with my new
00:57 - variable x and when I
change the value of x
01:00 - it moves Winston's face
01:02 - but without his eyes or his mouth.
01:05 - So to fix that, we're gonna
define the position of
01:08 - his eyes and his mouth relative
to the position of his face.
01:14 - So the x coordinates are
going to be the centers
01:16 - of all the ellipses, so
his face is being drawn at,
01:20 - that's 200, and let's
do his left eye first.
01:24 - So this ellipse is his
left eye and we can see
01:26 - that it's being drawn at 150,
01:29 - so right here, that is 150.
01:33 - And I know that 150 is 50 less than 200.
01:37 - So his left eye should be
wherever his face is minus 50.
01:42 - So it's going to be x, which
is the position of his face,
01:45 - minus 50.
01:47 - And now if I change the
value of his x coordinate,
01:50 - his eye moves along with his face.
01:53 - Let's do the other ones.
01:54 - So his right eye is being
drawn at 300, I can see,
01:58 - so this over here is 300.
02:01 - And 300, I know, is 100 more than 200.
02:05 - So his right eye should be
wherever his face is plus 100.
02:10 - So that's x plus 100.
02:12 - And now we just have his mouth.
02:14 - So his mouth is being drawn at 250.
02:16 - It's over here, we got 250
02:19 - and 250 is 200 plus 50.
02:23 - So it's going to be
wherever, ooh that's a five,
02:26 - wherever his face is, x plus 50.
02:31 - And now, I'm going to get
rid of these scribbles,
02:33 - whenever I change the value
of x, it moves his whole face.
02:38 - Yay!
02:39 - Now before you go you should know a couple
02:41 - more things about variables.
02:42 - Once you create a variable using var x
02:45 - you're gonna assign a value to it
02:47 - as many times as you want.
02:48 - So after giving x the
value of 198 I could say
02:53 - x gets 300, or
02:55 - x gets 150.
02:59 - And from then on, the
computer would treat x
03:01 - as if it were, whatever
we last assigned it,
03:03 - so in this case, 150.
03:05 - But you only need to type
var once per variable.
03:08 - If, over here, I had typed
var x gets 150 instead,
03:12 - that would have made a
brand new variable named x
03:15 - completely destroying the old
variable x in the process.
03:18 - So all of these variables
are gone in the dumpster.
03:21 - And then afterwards, the computer would
03:22 - only use the new variable.
03:24 - Sometimes you can do this kind of thing
03:25 - without horrible things happening to you,
03:27 - but I wouldn't advise it.
03:29 - Now we're just gonna do it once, var x gets 150.
