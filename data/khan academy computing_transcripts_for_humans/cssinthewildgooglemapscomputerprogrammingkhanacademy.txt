00:01 - - Let me show you an
example of CSS position
00:03 - in z-index in the wild; Google Maps.
00:07 - Probably, most of you
have used Google Maps
00:09 - or some sort of online
mapping service before,
00:11 - to help you find what you're looking for.
00:14 - These things are just really cool.
00:17 - We can browse around, we can zoom in,
00:19 - we can zoom out, and
we can look for things.
00:23 - So, since I'm in Barcelona right now,
00:25 - I'll look for Sagrada Familia,
00:27 - which is this beautiful church.
00:31 - This is actually HTML CSS and JavaScript.
00:35 - Let me show you all the
z-index that's going on here.
00:38 - So all the different elements that we see,
00:40 - these have all been positioned
00:42 - using CSS to be on top of each other
00:45 - and they're using z-index
in a very particular way
00:48 - to make sure that the
order is exactly correct.
00:52 - So, let me just use my Chrome console
00:56 - to show you a few things.
01:01 - This mini map here, in the corner,
01:03 - has position absolute,
bottom zero, left zero
01:07 - and a z-index of one.
01:09 - So, that should put it above something
01:11 - with a z-index of zero.
01:14 - This Hovercard that shows up,
01:15 - and has all these options here,
01:18 - it has vision fixed, and
then a z-index of 10.
01:22 - So, it shows up on top of a lot of things.
01:27 - The zoom button has a z-index of two,
01:30 - so that should mean that it ends up
01:31 - underneath the Hovercard.
01:33 - Let's just move this over here
01:38 - and see what happens.
01:39 - See, the Hovercard that shows up,
01:41 - shows up above that zoom,
because it has a z-index of four
01:45 - and the zoom has a z-index of two.
01:50 - As you can see, Google Maps uses a lot
01:53 - of CSS position and
z-index in order to lay out
01:55 - all the map and controls on top of it.
01:57 - It does use a lot of other
CSS and JavaScript as well,
02:01 - but it's pretty neat
that now you can start
02:04 - to understand how other websites
02:05 - are built that look nothing like the ones
02:08 - that we've been showing so far.
02:10 - That's the power of CSS.

Let me show you an example of CSS position in zindex in the wild; Google Maps. Probably, most of you have used Google Maps or some sort of online mapping service before, to help you find what you're looking for. These things are just really cool. We can browse around, we can zoom in, we can zoom out, and we can look for things. So, since I'm in Barcelona right now, I'll look for Sagrada Familia, which is this beautiful church. This is actually HTML CSS and JavaScript. Let me show you all the zindex that's going on here.
