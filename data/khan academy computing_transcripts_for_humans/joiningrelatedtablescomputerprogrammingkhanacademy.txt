With timestamps:

00:00 - I've set up two tables in this database--
00:02 - a `students` table, with detailed
information about each student,
00:06 - like their name and email.
00:07 - And a `student_grades` table,
00:10 - which has their student ID,
test name, and grade.
00:14 - Let's see what happens if we just
select everything from `student_grades`.
00:20 - Ta-da.
00:21 - Okay, so we see student IDs,
test names, and grades.
00:25 - I'd actually rather be able to see
student names, emails, that sort of thing.
00:30 - Now, what you might notice is that
the student ID in `student_grades`
00:35 - is related to the ID in `students`.
00:39 - So this 1 here is actually
referring to Peter Rabbit.
00:42 - And this 2 here is actually
referring to Allison Wonderland.
00:47 - Now, I want to form a query that will
00:50 - output the student name and email
next to each test grade.
00:56 - And that information is in
two different tables.
01:00 - So that means I need to join the tables.
01:04 - And there are a few ways
that we can do that in SQL,
01:07 - and we'll try them all out actually.
01:10 - The simplest is called a cross join.
01:13 - And I can make that happen just by
putting both table names after the `FROM`.
01:20 - Ta-da!
01:21 - So as you can see, lots of rows,
and basically what this did is that
01:26 - for each row in the first table,
01:28 - it created a row for
each of these rows here.
01:32 - That means we end up with eight rows,
because it creates four rows
01:37 - for each of these two rows.
01:39 - This is the simplest join,
but it's also the least useful.
01:44 - We don't want every row
matched with every other row.
01:48 - We only want them matched
if the student ID matches.
01:53 - Now we can do that
using an inner join,
01:58 - which isn't actually much
more work at all,
02:01 - and is way more useful.
02:04 - So, there's actually a few ways
of doing an inner join.
02:08 - We'll start with just building
off the last query,
02:11 - and we can add a `WHERE`.
02:13 - The `WHERE` will check to see that
the student ID matches students to ID.
02:21 - All right, so now we actually
have what we wanted--
02:24 - is test grades next to names.
02:27 - Because it's done the the cross join
and then just limited to the rows
02:31 - where those columns were the same.
02:33 - Great!
02:34 - This syntax here is called
an implicit inner join,
02:39 - and it works, but it's not actually
the best practice.
02:43 - The better way is if we do something
called an explicit inner join.
02:50 - And that is using the `JOIN` keyword.
02:55 - So to do that, we're going to start
with just doing from one table.
03:01 - And actually, I'll do from `students`,
and then `JOIN` on `student_grades`.
03:07 - And then, instead of `WHERE`,
we do `ON`.
03:11 - And that specifies what columns
are being matched.
03:16 - So `ON students.id =
studentsgrades.studentid;`
03:21 - All right, so now we have
the same results as before--
03:24 - switched, but really the same.
03:27 - Now that I have these tables joined,
I'm just going to whittle down
03:31 - the columns I'm outputting to the names,
the email, the test name, and the grade.
03:41 - Okay, beautiful.
03:43 - Now the cool thing is,
once we've done joins,
03:46 - we can still use `WHERE` and `GROUP BY`,
and all those fancy things.
03:51 - Like, let's say that we want to filter
down to results to just
03:55 - grades greater than 90.
03:58 - Woo hoo!
04:00 - Let's see-- oh, nope.
04:02 - Uh, grade, grade-- there we go.
04:05 - A-ha, lots of ones above 90,
now I can email all those students
04:10 - with a high-five.
04:12 - Okay, but what would happen
if my tables both contained columns
04:17 - with the same column name
but different meanings?
04:21 - Like right now, our student grades table
has a grade column,
04:25 - But what if my students table also
had a grade column
04:29 - for their overall class grade?
04:31 - That would mean down here,
when we selected grade,
04:35 - it wouldn't know which
table to pull it from,
04:37 - because there'd be a grade column
in both of our tables.
04:41 - So actually, to be super safe,
we should prefix our columns
04:46 - with the table name that they're from.
04:49 - So we say `students.firstname,
students.lastname, students.email,`
04:56 - `studentgrades.test, studentgrades.grade`.
05:02 - Okay, now we know that
we're going to get the columns
05:04 - from the table we expect them to be in.
05:07 - Great.
05:08 - Now that is our basic explicit inner join.
05:12 - And it is what you'll use for
most of your joins across related tables.
05:16 - But if you stay tuned, I'll show you
a few other types of joins as well.
