00:00 - - [Voiceover] One of
the best ways to learn
00:01 - is to teach others.
00:03 - When you have to explain
something to someone else,
00:05 - it helps you understand
it better yourself.
00:07 - You'd help one of the
thousands of new students
00:08 - learning programing here at Khan Academy.
00:11 - Each of them could benefit
00:12 - from the knowledge that you now have.
00:14 - We have three big ways that you can help
00:16 - and I'll go through them now.
00:19 - Throughout this intro course,
00:20 - you've had both challenges and projects.
00:22 - The challenges are
automatically graded by Hopper
00:25 - where the projects are more
free-form and creative,
00:27 - so they're not so easy
to automatically grade.
00:29 - Instead, we have actual
people do the evaluations,
00:32 - people just like you
who know how to program
00:34 - and want to help others.
00:36 - If you'd like to evaluate projects,
00:38 - just head over to the homepage
00:39 - and click project feedback.
00:41 - You'll find the evaluation
request half way down the page
00:43 - and you can choose to evaluate
your favorite projects
00:46 - or just go from the top.
00:47 - When you evaluate,
you'll be shown a rubric
00:49 - and you need to decide if a project
00:51 - meets the objective or not.
00:53 - If it doesn't, you can give them ideas
00:54 - for ways they can meet the objective.
00:56 - The projects are an interim process.
00:59 - The student gets to keep working on them
01:01 - until they meet the objectives.
01:02 - So evaluations help them understand
01:04 - what they need to improve.
01:06 - At the end of the evaluation,
01:07 - you can leave any comments.
01:09 - And that's a great
place to say nice things
01:11 - and encourage them to keep
going with programming.
01:14 - And hey, if you're really impressed
01:15 - with a project, vote it up.
01:17 - We're amazed by some of the crazy,
01:19 - cool things that you
all do in your projects.
01:22 - Sometimes when you're
programming something,
01:24 - you get stuck.
01:25 - Maybe you can't figure
out how to draw spaghetti
01:27 - with that crazy bezier function
01:29 - or you can't get Winston
01:30 - to bounce across the screen just right.
01:33 - At times like that, you
can click request help
01:35 - and ask the community for help.
01:38 - If you want to try to answer
help requests like that,
01:41 - just go to the computer
programming homepage
01:42 - and click project feedback.
01:44 - You'll see the most recent
help requests at the top
01:46 - and you can browse through
it til you find one
01:48 - that fits your expertise.
01:50 - And hey, you can still request
help on your own programs.
01:53 - We definitely believe that
teachers can be students
01:55 - and students can be teachers
all at the same time.
01:59 - You might also find
that you can learn a lot
02:01 - from just reading other people's
answers to help requests.
02:03 - To do that, just click the answer tab
02:05 - to see the ones already answered.
02:07 - And you can just read that for hours.
02:11 - Remember when you're
watching the talk-throughs
02:13 - and you had a question,
02:14 - maybe you look through
the questions to add
02:16 - to see if somebody else
had the same question,
02:18 - maybe you even asked it yourself
02:19 - and hopefully somebody answered.
02:21 - Now you can help those
people asking questions.
02:24 - Just go to the computer
programming homepage
02:26 - and click community questions
02:28 - and you can browse through all
the most recently asked questions
02:30 - to find one that you think
you have an answer for.
02:35 - So there you go, lots of ways
02:36 - that you can help new programmers learn.
02:38 - And yes, you might feel like
a new programmer yourself
02:40 - but you actually know more
02:41 - than 99 percent of the world does.
02:44 - Don't keep that knowledge to yourself.
