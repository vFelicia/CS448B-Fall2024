00:00 - So we've been doing
a lot of drawing so far.
00:02 - But we haven't talked about
something as simple as say,
00:05 - writing your name;
that's what this lesson is about, text.
00:07 - So why might you want to use text?
00:10 - Well maybe we want to show 
the score in a game
00:12 - or have characters talk, 
or just to make our name grow
00:14 - and shrink and change colors.
00:16 - So let's go ahead and try and say "hello."
00:18 - Say "text(hello)" and we have
this weird error message that pops up,
00:24 - saying that "hello is not defined,"
what does that mean?
00:27 - Well, the problem is that the program
00:29 - thinks that "hello" is a variable,
00:31 - and it kind of makes sense 
from the program's perspective
00:33 - because maybe "hello" could be a variable, 
how would it know?
00:36 - So how do we tell our program
that it's actually text?
00:38 - So that's easy, we just have to remember
00:41 - to put these quotations marks around it.
00:43 - And that says 
that no, this is not a variable,
00:45 - and in fact this is text
00:46 - or we want you to display it as text,
00:48 - and you can remember this
by thinking of a book,
00:50 - where all the characters talk,
00:51 - and there are quotes
around what they are saying.
00:53 - And similarly, when you want 
the program to say something,
00:56 - that text has to have 
these qutoes around it.
00:58 - And this is actually really important
and easy to mess up.
01:00 - So i'm just going to say it again,
anytime you want to use text
01:03 - in your program you always have to use
01:05 - these quotation marks around it.
01:07 - Otherwise you're going to get
some really weird error messages.
01:10 - And remember, if you do see
those weird error messages,
01:12 - just be sure to double check
that you are remembering to use quotes.
01:15 - Great! so now we're using quotation marks,
01:17 - and we don't get an error anymore.
01:18 - But you might have noticed
that nothing is happening,
01:20 - and it's still blank,
01:22 - but what is kind of strange is
if we set a "background,"
01:24 - something, say just a red, 
then we see that it is actually there.
01:29 - It's just in white, so the problem is 
if we think about it,
01:33 - that we were writing white text, 
onto a white background,
01:36 - and that's why we couldn't see it.
01:37 - So that seems a little bit silly, 
why were you writing
01:40 - white text onto white background?
01:42 - Well, we could just change it, 
because we learned how to set
01:45 - the fill of something.
01:47 - And just like we can set the fill 
of a rectangle or a line,
01:49 - we can set the fill of text to anything
01:51 - just like before, and then there it is!
01:54 - It shows up without 
needing the background,
01:56 - so let's look a little bit more
to how this text thing is working.
02:00 - The first part, is obvious enough,
02:02 - it's just whatever text we want to write.
02:04 - The next part, if we change it,
02:06 - we can see that it's basically
just how far over,
02:08 - and the next one
is just how far up and down.
02:11 - That probably looks really familiar
from when we were just
02:14 - drawing rectangles.
02:15 - One thing that's a little bit tricky
02:17 - is that text has these two coordinates
02:19 - specify the lower left part, 
so this corner of the text.
02:24 - While with rectangles
it's the upper left, this corner.
02:27 - And that can seem like it was
just designed to confuse you,
02:30 - but it's just something
you kind of have to remember.
02:32 - And we can even experiment 
and see it for ourselves,
02:34 - by we can set this to say, "height,"
and we can see that,
02:39 - yeah, it is setting the height
to be this lower left coordinate.
02:44 - Or we can set it to zero,
02:46 - and you think what should we expect then?
02:50 - And we don't see it at all, 
but if we slowly start increasing this,
02:53 - we can see that, yeah it is kind of
just like peeking out there.
02:56 - Because again, that lower left coordinate
is what we're specifying,
02:59 - not the upper left.
03:01 - Okay, so enough of analyzing
this text thing,
03:05 - let's go ahead and make it better.
03:07 - For example, 
let's start to make it bigger,
03:09 - we can do that with "textSize" 
which just tells the program
03:12 - how big to draw the text.
03:13 - And we can make it "30,"
which is pretty big,
03:16 - we can make it even bigger,
03:17 - or we can make it really, 
really, really, really small.
03:20 - Whatever we want, so let's go ahead
and draw your name
03:23 - and maybe a little message
about yourself underneath.
03:25 - Since I don't know your name,
I'm just going to draw my name.
03:28 - You can switch it to yours in a moment.
03:30 - So using what we just learned, 
we can say "text("Sophia")"
03:34 - and there my name is.
03:35 - And then maybe want to put 
a little message underneath,
03:38 - like, "I like puppies
and guitars and coding."
03:43 - So that's great, 
except that we obviously need
03:46 - to change the positions 
so they don't overlap.
03:48 - And oh no, no, 
that's kind of a long string of text,
03:51 - so let's change it
to be a smaller text size.
03:56 - And there we go, that's pretty good.
03:58 - Except, I don't know,
it's kind of boring having
04:00 - them both be blue,
so let's just change the "fill,"
04:04 - and let's make it maybe a nice, 
hmm I don't know,
04:06 - maybe a nice, like, purple.
04:09 - Alright, and there you go, 
that's all there is
04:13 - to drawing text and changing 
colors and changing size.
