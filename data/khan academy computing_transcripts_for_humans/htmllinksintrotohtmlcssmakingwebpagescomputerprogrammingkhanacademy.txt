00:00 - - [Voiceover] You've already
learned a bunch of HTML tags,
00:02 - but you know what HTML actually means?
00:05 - Well, HTML stands for
HyperText Markup Language.
00:09 - You know what a Markup Language is now.
00:11 - It's a way of using
tags to markup content.
00:14 - But what does HyperText mean?
00:17 - It's actually a phrase that was invented
00:18 - before the internet even
existed in the 1960s,
00:21 - to mean text that's
connected to other text
00:24 - that the reader can immediately jump to.
00:26 - Tim Berners-Lee invented HTML
00:29 - and other ingredients of
the internet like HTTP
00:32 - to be a way to connect text to other text
00:34 - located anywhere in the world.
00:37 - How do we connect
webpages to other webpages
00:39 - in HyperText Markup Language?
00:41 - With a hyperlink, of course,
00:43 - which we usually just call a link now.
00:46 - How do we make a link in HTML?
00:48 - This is where it gets weird.
00:50 - You might think that we
use a link tag but actually
00:54 - that's used for a different
sort of link in HTML.
00:57 - Instead, we use that a tag
where the a stands for anchor.
01:03 - It's anchoring the link in the
page that a certain location
01:06 - and connecting that anchor
to a different webpage.
01:09 - To make a link, you have to write the tag
01:11 - but we also have to decide
on the text of the link
01:14 - and then the address
that the link goes to.
01:17 - Let's make this link to a page
01:19 - with more information
about the birth of the web.
01:25 - So the text of the link will go inside
01:28 - the start and the end tags.
01:29 - I'll stick my cursor in here and write,
01:31 - "Read more about the history of HTML."
01:36 - Okay, so now we can see
that text looks like a link
01:40 - but it's not going anywhere yet.
01:42 - We need to add an address.
01:45 - We don't actually want the
address to show up on the page
01:47 - but we still need the
browser know what it is.
01:49 - So we put it inside an
attribute on the a tag
01:53 - and that's the href attribute.
01:57 - What does href stand for?
01:59 - I will give you a hint.
02:00 - You have seen that H a lot.
02:03 - Stands for hyper, hyper reference.
02:06 - Now I'll paste in the address
02:09 - which we also call a URL.
02:12 - You notice how this URL starts with HTTP?
02:16 - Guess what that H stands for.
02:17 - Hyper!
02:18 - HTML is all about the Hyper.
02:21 - This URL specifies everything the browser
02:24 - needs to know to find the webpage.
02:25 - The protocol used for finding
it, the domain it's on,
02:30 - and the path that it's
located on the server.
02:34 - So since it specifies everything,
02:35 - we call this an absolute URL.
02:38 - On some webpages, you might see URLs
02:40 - that start with just slash in the path.
02:43 - That tells the browser to
stay on the current domain
02:46 - and just look for different
path on that domain.
02:48 - That's called a relative URL.
02:50 - We use them all over in Khan Academy
02:52 - when we link between our content.
02:54 - You just stick to absolute
URLs in the webpages
02:56 - that you make here to
stay on the safe side.
02:59 - We can also tell the browser
where to open the page.
03:02 - The current window or a new window.
03:04 - To tell the browser to open link
03:06 - in a new window, we'll
add another attribute.
03:09 - target equals, this (mumbles),
03:13 - underscore blank.
03:15 - Now, I want you to pause
03:16 - this talk through and
try clicking the link.
03:19 - Go ahead, I'll wait.
03:21 - Clicky, clicky, clicky.
03:23 - What happened?
03:24 - You probably saw a warning about the link
03:26 - being from a user generated webpage.
03:28 - And then when you click
okay, the link opened up.
03:30 - That's because we treat
links a little special
03:33 - on the webpages made here
because we don't want users
03:35 - thinking that links
are especially endorsed
03:37 - by Khan Academy and then landing
03:38 - on a scary unexpected website.
03:41 - So every link that you make here will have
03:43 - that warning and every link
will pop up in a new window.
03:46 - That means I can actually
delete this target attribute
03:50 - since it's getting set
behind the scenes too
03:52 - or I could leave it in case
I want to move this HTML off
03:56 - of Khan Academy one day and make sure
03:58 - that link still opens in new window.
04:01 - When should you use target?
04:02 - Generally, if it's a
link is going to another
04:05 - page on the same domain,
04:06 - it should open in the same window.
04:07 - If it's going to a page on another domain,
04:09 - it should open in a new window.
04:11 - Okay, enough of that blabbing.
04:13 - Let me show you something
else neat about links.
04:16 - We can link more than just text.
04:18 - We can also link images
or text and images here.
04:22 - We have this image which we said
04:24 - this picture of Tim Berners-Lee.
04:26 - So I'm going to actually
cut it and paste it
04:31 - so it's inside this link here.
04:34 - Oh, sweet.
04:36 - Now, if my mouse's over this image,
04:39 - I'll see my cursor change to a pointer
04:41 - and clicking it will
go to the CERN webpage.
04:44 - In fact, you could link
your entire webpage
04:47 - and make it a big blue underlined blob.
04:49 - But please don't do that.
04:51 - Link with love, my friends.
