00:00 - Voiceover: Ok so you've
made a few programs,
00:02 - you might be wondering how on earth am I
supposed to remember all of these commands
00:07 - is it oval or circle or
ellipse? Is it width and height,
or is it height and width?
00:13 - Do I have to memorize all
of this? Thankfully, no!
00:16 - That's what the computer is for. The thing
is, we always have a computer with us
00:20 - when we are programming, and a computer
is really good at remembering things,
00:23 - better than we are. So what
if we just had the computer
remember all the details for us,
00:27 - and we can just use it like
a dictionary for programming.
00:30 - Then we can focus on making cool programs,
00:32 - not memorizing a bunch of boring details.
00:35 - That's what we call documentation,
a document that explains
00:37 - how to program in a particular
language and environment,
00:40 - with examples and gotchas, so if we
can't remember the exact details,
00:43 - no worries - we can just look them up!
00:47 - You might think it's boring
to read documentation,
00:49 - and you are right - it is kind of boring,
it's a lot more fun to write code.
00:52 - But unless you want to memorize
absolutely everything (ugh!),
00:55 - you need to learn how to use documentation
or be able to code your ideas.
00:58 - Even great programmers don't
try to memorize everything.
01:01 - In fact, great programmers are usually
some of the best at reading documentation.
01:05 - For example, I'm drawing this smiley face,
01:08 - and I've already drawn the face
and the eyes using ellipse,
01:11 - a function I know pretty
well. But I have more work to.
01:15 - First, I want to draw the face with
thick outlines, like a sticker.
01:19 - I remember that has
something to do with stroke,
01:22 - but I don't remember exactly the name,
01:25 - so instead of sitting here
and trying to invent it,
01:27 - which could take hours (or infinity),
I'll just go to the documentation tab
01:33 - and look around and try and
find what I'm looking for.
01:36 - Umm, and I'll look under this coloring
category, cause that seems likely,
01:39 - and look at all the functions here,
01:41 - and then finally at the very
end, I find stroke weight
01:43 - to change the thickness
of lines and outlines.
01:46 - So here we see the function
name and the parameters -
01:49 - just one in this case. So
what I usually do is start off
01:53 - by just copying that code
and pasting it into my code.
01:58 - But I immediately get an error:
"thickness is not defined".
02:01 - That's because thickness
is a placeholder parameter.
02:04 - It's not a real value, I
am meant to replace that
02:07 - with what I actually want it to be,
right, so that could be with a number
02:12 - or a variable that refers to a number, so
in this case I'll just put a number in.
02:16 - Say, ah, ok, perfect, 10's nice,
but we know we can fiddle with that
02:19 - and see. oh that's a little
extreme (laughs). that's too small.
02:23 - All right, so go back - 12. Cool!
02:28 - Now there is something really obvious
missing in my smily face: the smile.
02:33 - So I basically just want
something like this, right...
02:37 - And I can look at that
smile and think, well,
02:40 - doesn't look I'd draw by using
an ellipse, or line, or rect,
02:45 - cause it's got this curve to it,
but it doesn't have any inside.
02:50 - So I think, well, I should
check the docs and see
02:52 - if there is some other way
to draw a curve like this.
02:55 - So, to the docs machine we go!
02:58 - Scrolling down, scrolling
down, and looking around.
03:01 - So I'll check out the shapes category...
03:04 - Aha! The very first
entry in shapes is arc,
03:08 - which is used for drawing an arc,
which sounds kind of perfect,
03:12 - because that's what the smile is.
03:14 - So this one has a lot
more parameters in it.
03:18 - I'll start off by pasting this in here...
03:21 - And remember these are placeholder
parameters so we need to replace them
03:26 - with what we think they should be...
03:28 - All right, so x and y, so maybe x
and y is where i want it to begin,
03:33 - so we'll say, so our middle is
100 so maybe it will start at 150,
03:40 - and then y is maybe 250, and then width -
03:45 - width sounds like, you
know, the width of the arc,
03:47 - so probably a bit less than
width of the actual face.
03:50 - So maybe it's 200, and then the height...
03:53 - maybe that's the height from the
top of the arc to the bottom,
03:58 - so go, maybe that's 50. Start and stop...
04:00 - Hmm, I don't actually
know what those are...
04:08 - Ok, now I'm stuck, because I'm looking
at this function and trying to use it,
04:13 - but I don't really
understand these parameters.
04:16 - Well, luckily, what you can do
is just go back down to the docs
04:21 - and actually click on the function
that you are interested in,
04:26 - and it will bring up a program
that shows you how to use it,
04:31 - and actually explains the
parameters in a lot more detail.
04:34 - So by looking at this, it
says, ok, x is the x-coordinate
04:38 - of the center of the ellipse
derived from the ark.
04:40 - Okay, so basically it seems like to
draw an arc you kinda have to pretend
04:43 - you're drawing an ellipse,
but only part of it,
04:46 - and calculate everything based on that.
04:49 - So the x and y zap to the center of
that pretend ellipse we're making,
04:53 - the width and the height are the width
and height of that pretend ellipse,
04:57 - and start and stop - those
are the ones I didn't know.
04:59 - Start and stop is the angle...
ah! Ok, the start angle to
start the arc at, in degrees,
05:05 - and stop is where to stop it at, right.
05:07 - And we can actually look at
the examples they've done here,
05:09 - so drawing the arc from 1 to 270, that's
probably this guy over here, right,
05:14 - because 1 degree to 270 degrees,
that's what that would look like.
05:19 - Let's try and change it. There we go,
that makes sense, right, because 1 to 180,
05:23 - that's kind of what we want, right,
because we want our half arc...
05:26 - Ok, so now I think I understand
arc well enough to use it,
05:30 - and let's go back to my smiley...
05:32 - All right, so we're going
from 0 to 180, and...
05:40 - we've almost got it. My x amount
is off because I didn't realize
05:43 - that x is actually the
middle of the ellipse,
05:47 - and is a little bit wide, so
let's go make that smaller!
05:52 - Haha! I now have a real smiley face!
05:57 - Thanks to using the docs I was able
to do what I wanted much faster.
06:01 - And that's a goal of programming -
turn our ideas into reality faster.
06:06 - Remember - use the power of the docs!
