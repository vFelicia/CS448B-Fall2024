With timestamps:

00:00 - Let's try a few more 
advanced SQL features.
00:04 - I've been logging heart rate
for each of my exercises,
00:08 - and I haven't done anything
interesting with this data yet.
00:12 - So now it's time.
00:13 - I did a little research on the Internet,
and I found that the maximum heart rate
00:18 - is 220 minus your age.
00:21 - So one thing I can do is
query my logs to see if my heart rate
00:25 - ever goes above max,
since that would be pretty scary,
00:30 - or tell me that there's something wrong
with my heart rate checking device.
00:34 - Okay, to do that, I'm going to do
a `COUNT(*)`.
00:39 - So `COUNT(*) FROM exercise_logs`
00:43 - and then `WHERE heart_rate`
greater than 220 minus my age, 30.
00:51 - Woo hoo, there's no results,
and that makes my heart happy.
00:56 - Now, notice I'm using
the subtraction operator?
00:59 - And in fact, I can use
most math operators in SQL,
01:03 - like to add, subtract,
multiply, or divide.
01:06 - And if I need to, just like in math,
I can throw in parentheses
01:10 - and change the order of evaluation.
01:12 - All right, so, we've confirmed that my
heart doesn't go above max, that's good.
01:17 - Now let's look to see if my heart
gets into the target heart rate zone.
01:22 - And that is 50 to 90 percent of max.
01:27 - So we're going to start
with our `COUNT(*)`,
01:31 - and we just need to change our `WHERE`.
01:33 - So this time we're going to say
heart rate is greater than--
01:37 - and let's look at 50 percent of max--
that's 220 minus 30.
01:42 - Okay, so you see I'm combining
a few math operators here.
01:46 - And I'm going to also throw in the
`ROUND` function, just to show you
01:49 - that we can use that function,
it's pretty nifty.
01:52 - And then we're going to say
`AND`, and I'll just copy-paste this,
01:56 - and change it to less than 90.
02:00 - Let's go ahead and throw
an equals in there.
02:02 - All right, so now, we're checking to see
50 to 90 percent of max and we see
02:07 - there are four logs that fall
in that target zone.
02:11 - But what about my other logs?
02:13 - What zones are they in?
02:15 - We don't know, all we know is
that four of them are in that target zone,
02:19 - the rest could be-- maybe they're
90 to 100 percent,
02:22 - maybe they're less than 50 percent.
02:24 - What I would really like to see
is a summary of all my logs
02:28 - and how many were in each
of the heart rate zones.
02:32 - Now that sounds like a situation where
I would use a `GROUP BY`,
02:36 - like `GROUP BY` this column that says
which heart rate zone this row is in.
02:41 - But I don't actually have
a column like that to group by.
02:45 - Well, I can effectively create a column,
using the `CASE` statement.
02:51 - Now, I'll admit that I find this the
trickiest statement to use in SQL.
02:57 - So, I struggle with it a bit,
02:59 - and don't worry if you
find it a bit odd as well.
03:02 - It is similar to an `if` or a `switch`
from programming languages,
03:06 - if you're familiar with those.
03:08 - Otherwise, don't worry about it.
03:10 - All right, so, we're going to use `CASE`,
but I'm just going to start with
03:15 - outputting what we know, which is
03:17 - `type` and `heart rate`
`FROM exercise_logs`,
03:20 - and see what that looks like.
03:22 - Okay, now for each of these rows,
I want to add a new column
03:26 - that says which zone the heart rate is in.
03:30 - To do that, I go into the
`SELECT` part of the query.
03:34 - And I'm going to write `CASE`,
to begin the `CASE` statement,
03:38 - then I type `WHEN`,
and the first condition
03:44 - which is checking if it's above max,
so that was `heart_rate > 220 - 30`.
03:52 - Then I write `THEN`, [LAUGHS]
and an expression, which is just a string.
03:57 - So we'll say above max.
04:00 - Okay, so this is my first case.
04:03 - Now I'm going to keep going with my
other conditions.
04:07 - So, `WHEN heart_rate > 90`,
04:16 - `THEN` we'll say that it's above target.
04:19 - And then-- so if greater than 90--
and then we'll say, at that point,
04:23 - if it's greater than 50,
we can say it's within target.
04:30 - And everything else would be below target,
so I could do another condition for that.
04:36 - But I can also just be lazy, or smart,
however you want to think of it,
04:41 - and say `ELSE "below target"`.
04:44 - Okay?
04:46 - Now my conditions are all done,
04:48 - but I haven't told SQL
what to name this new column.
04:52 - For that, I write `END as "hr_zone"`.
04:59 - Awesome.
05:00 - So now, for each of the rows,
I can see the new column
05:04 - with a nice description of
what zone they're in.
05:07 - Now that we've done that finally,
I can make a query that summarizes
05:11 - how many of my logs are in
each of the zones.
05:14 - And that is a whole lot easier now
that I've set up this `CASE`.
05:18 - I'm just going to take this query here,
05:21 - copy it, and I'm going to `GROUP BY`
the new column we created.
05:27 - And then add `COUNT(*)`,
get rid of the heart rate,
05:33 - see what we have here-- aha!
05:36 - And now we see that we've got
four below target and four within target.
05:43 - That's pretty neat, huh?
05:45 - That `CASE` statement,
it is a tricky one,
05:47 - but it sure is handy
once you get the hang of it.
05:50 - You may not use it all the time,
but it's good to know--
05:53 - just in case.
