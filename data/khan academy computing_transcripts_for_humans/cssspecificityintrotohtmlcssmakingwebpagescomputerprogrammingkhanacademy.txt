00:00 - - [Voiceover] Now, we're
going to talk about a concept
00:02 - called specificity.
00:04 - How specific are CSS rules are?
00:07 - Because I get tongue tied a lot
00:09 - and I mispronounce specific as Pacific,
00:11 - I decided to make a webpage
about the Pacific Ocean.
00:14 - Also, it's my favorite ocean.
00:18 - This webpage here has a
heading and a few paragraphs
00:22 - including this short little
paragraph at the top.
00:25 - It uses three different
types of selectors in the CSS
00:28 - to style these paragraphs.
00:29 - The first rules selects all
the paragraphs in a page
00:32 - and changes their font
family to sans-serif.
00:34 - The second rule, selects
all the paragraphs
00:37 - of the class name info-paragraph
00:39 - and changes their color to blue,
00:41 - which affects all but that
first little paragraph.
00:44 - The final rule selects
only the single paragraph
00:47 - with the ID main-paragraph,
00:49 - it sets the font-weight to bold.
00:51 - Now, if we look at the main
informational paragraph
00:54 - we see it's had all three
properties applied to it.
00:58 - It's sans-serif, blue and bold.
01:01 - The browser applied them
all because the selector's
01:04 - in every rule selected for that paragraph.
01:07 - What if we made it so that
all three of the rules
01:10 - set the color of paragraphs,
01:12 - how would the browser decide which color
01:15 - to make this paragraph?
01:17 - Let's try it and see.
01:20 - I will add a color orange to the p rule
01:24 - and then a color green to main-paragraph.
01:27 - Now, that main paragraph is green,
01:31 - why is that?
01:32 - How did the browser decide green?
01:34 - It was given three rules that
all included that paragraph
01:38 - and they all specified a color property
01:40 - but it seems it only
applied the green property.
01:44 - Well, this is where specificity matters.
01:48 - Some rules are considered more specific
01:50 - than other rules in CSS.
01:52 - Generally, an ID is more specific
01:57 - and a class is more
specific than an element.
02:01 - That is why main-paragraph won.
02:04 - That's a simple rule you can remember
02:06 - if you're comparing simple selectors
02:08 - but the browser actually follows
02:10 - more complex logic than that.
02:12 - The browser actually calculates
02:14 - what's called a specificity score
02:17 - for each rule and compares the
specificity scores to decide.
02:22 - Sometimes what can
happen is that two rules
02:26 - could be equally specific,
02:28 - like if we had two rules with class names.
02:32 - Let's see what happens.
02:33 - I'm gonna add another
rule in here to select
02:35 - based on the important class
02:37 - which is attach the main
paragraph and a strong tag below.
02:42 - I'll start off by making
it set a background color,
02:47 - so you can see what it selects.
02:49 - I'll say background-color yellow
02:50 - and now you can see they
both have a back color yellow
02:52 - because there's no other
equally specific rule
02:55 - applying a background color,
02:56 - so that wins.
02:58 - However, what if I also put
a background color property
03:02 - in this info-paragraph rule
03:04 - and I make that orange,
03:06 - see what happens.
03:10 - Ah-ha, the strong tag is still yellow
03:12 - but that main paragraph has
a background color of orange.
03:16 - How did the browser decide which to pick,
03:19 - of these two equally specific selectors?
03:24 - Here's the rule, in the
case that two selectors
03:26 - are equally specific, the last one wins.
03:29 - So if I want that
important selector to win,
03:32 - I can cut and paste it below.
03:36 - Ta-da, it's yellow.
03:37 - That seems kinda scary for do just
03:40 - based on ordering of the rules.
03:42 - If you're applying a style
and it's not taking effect
03:45 - because of that,
03:45 - instead of reordering,
03:47 - you could also make the rule more specific
03:49 - by adding more to it to
up its specificity score.
03:53 - If I wanted to make sure that
info-paragraph always won,
03:56 - I could add p in front of it
04:00 - and now it's more specific.
04:02 - Just by a little bit but enough
04:04 - so that it wins a specificity game
04:06 - with the important selector.
04:09 - Specificity will become
more and more important
04:12 - as you write more complex CSS.
04:14 - Keeping in mind, even
though it is a little tricky
04:17 - but just keeping in mind,
04:18 - and whenever you're
staring at your webpage
04:20 - and wondering, "Hey, browser,
04:23 - "why aren't you applying my properties?"
04:25 - Think carefully about the
specificity and ordering
04:29 - of your rules, and that
will help you out a lot.

[Voiceover] Now, we're going to talk about a concept called specificity. How specific are CSS rules are? Because I get tongue tied a lot and I mispronounce specific as Pacific, I decided to make a webpage about the Pacific Ocean. Also, it's my favorite ocean. This webpage here has a heading and a few paragraphs including this short little paragraph at the top. It uses three different types of selectors in the CSS to style these paragraphs. The first rules selects all the paragraphs in a page and changes their font family to sansserif. The second rule, selects all the paragraphs of the class name infoparagraph and changes their color to blue, which affects all but that first little paragraph. The final rule selects only the single paragraph with the ID mainparagraph, it sets the fontweight to bold. Now, if we look at the main informational paragraph we see it's had all three properties applied to it. It's sansserif, blue and bold. The browser applied them all because the selector's in every rule selected for that paragraph. What if we made it so that all three of the rules set the color of paragraphs, how would the browser decide which color to make this paragraph? Let's try it and see. I will add a color orange to the p rule and then a color green to mainparagraph. Now, that main paragraph is green, why is that? How did the browser decide green? It was given three rules that all included that paragraph and they all specified a color property but it seems it only applied the green property. Well, this is where specificity matters. Some rules are considered more specific than other rules in CSS. Generally, an ID is more specific and a class is more specific than an element. That is why mainparagraph won. That's a simple rule you can remember if you're comparing simple selectors but the browser actually follows more complex logic than that. The browser actually calculates what's called a specificity score for each rule and compares the specificity scores to decide. Sometimes what can happen is that two rules could be equally specific, like if we had two rules with class names. Let's see what happens. I'm gonna add another rule in here to select based on the important class which is attach the main paragraph and a strong tag below. I'll start off by making it set a background color, so you can see what it selects. I'll say backgroundcolor yellow and now you can see they both have a back color yellow because there's no other equally specific rule applying a background color, so that wins. However, what if I also put a background color property in this infoparagraph rule and I make that orange, see what happens. Ahha, the strong tag is still yellow but that main paragraph has a background color of orange. How did the browser decide which to pick, of these two equally specific selectors? Here's the rule, in the case that two selectors are equally specific, the last one wins. So if I want that important selector to win, I can cut and paste it below. Tada, it's yellow. That seems kinda scary for do just based on ordering of the rules. If you're applying a style and it's not taking effect because of that, instead of reordering, you could also make the rule more specific by adding more to it to up its specificity score. If I wanted to make sure that infoparagraph always won, I could add p in front of it and now it's more specific. Just by a little bit but enough so that it wins a specificity game with the important selector. Specificity will become more and more important as you write more complex CSS. Keeping in mind, even though it is a little tricky but just keeping in mind, and whenever you're staring at your webpage and wondering, "Hey, browser, "why aren't you applying my properties?" Think carefully about the specificity and ordering of your rules, and that will help you out a lot.
