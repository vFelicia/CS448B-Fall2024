00:00 - Okay, now you know how to change 
the contents of an element
00:04 - and the values of its attributes.
00:06 - What else is left? Well, what if 
we wanted to change its style?
00:11 - Normally, we would do that in CSS, 
but there are some times when we
00:15 - want to do that in JavaScript, like when
we want to animate styles over time or
00:20 - change them after a user clicks something, 
which we'll see how to do soon, I promise.
00:25 - Let's change the style of this heading.
00:29 - If we did that in CSS, 
it would look like this--
00:33 - `#heading` to select by ID,
and then we'll say `color: orange`.
00:38 - Ta da, it's orange, just like the cat.
00:42 - Now, to do that in JavaScript,
00:46 - we first find the heading element, 
which we have here.
00:49 - Then, we're going to access 
its style attribute with `.style`.
00:55 - Then, we access the property 
that we're interested in-- `color`--
01:00 - and set it equal to the new value.
01:04 - Let's delete the property in CSS to 
see if it worked. Yup, it worked.
01:11 - Now, notice down here we've got two dots
because we're actually accessing
01:16 - two objects. One of them is the element
object and the other is the style object
01:22 - that contains all the styles for that 
element as different properties.
01:27 - What if we also wanted to change the
background color of that heading?
01:31 - In CSS it would be 
`background-color: black;`
01:37 - Let's try that in JavaScript. So
01:40 - `headingEl.style.background-color 
= "black";`
01:49 - Uh oh, we have an error. 
This is actually invalid JavaScript,
01:53 - because property names 
can't contain hyphens.
01:57 - Instead we need to convert this CSS
property name to a form that's valid
02:02 - JavaScript, which we do by camel-casing it.
Remove the hyphen and capitalize the "c".
02:11 - And let's go test it out by deleting this property here, and yep, it's still black.
02:16 - Now that I'm getting fancy, I want 
to make the heading center aligned too.
02:21 - So I will add one more line down here.
02:26 - `headingEl.style.textAlign`-- 
which we camel-case-- `= "center"`.
02:33 - Once again, we camel-case it since it 
was two words with a hyphen before,
02:37 - and now we've got this heading that looks
like our cat and also like Halloween. Yay.
