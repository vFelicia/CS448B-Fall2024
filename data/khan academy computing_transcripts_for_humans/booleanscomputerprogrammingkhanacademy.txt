00:02 - In the English language we have different parts of speech,
00:05 - like Noun, Adjective, Preposition, Verb.
00:08 - And then there are a bunch of rules that tell us how to put these different parts of speech together.
00:12 - So if I said something like, "Dog Books my eats," you'd be like "What the heck does that mean?"
00:21 - And if you didn't realize this before, apparently you can't just stick two nouns
00:25 - in front of an adjective in front of a verb. Doesn't work.
00:28 - But if I'd switched those and said, "My dog eats books," then you would totally know what I meant.
00:37 - I could even replace this verb "eats" with another verb like, I don't know, "throws"
00:42 - and it would still make grammatical sense, even if you can't imagine my dog throwing a book.
00:47 - So in programming, instead of parts of speech we have these things called types.
00:51 - You've already seen one of these: numbers. We use numbers all the time in our drawing code.
00:56 - And just like in English, there are times it makes sense to use a number, and times when it doesn't.
01:01 - If I started typing in this background function, "100 minus" then whatever comes next better be a number,
01:08 - or at least something that evaluates to a number like "14 + 15."
01:14 - On the other hand, if I'd just typed "100 space", well I can't really put a number after that
01:20 - because "100-space-10" doesn't mean anything.
01:23 - So there's another type in programming, called the Boolean type.
01:27 - And it's called Boolean because some dude named George Boole invented it.
01:33 - And unlike a number which has a ton of possible values,
01:37 - a boolean can only be one of two values: true or false.
01:42 - And you can see when I type them they turn blue, which means they're super special awesome words.
01:47 - And you've already seen one place where we use booleans, though you may not have realized it:
01:50 - If statements!
01:51 - Let's get a quick refresh on how those work.
01:53 - I'm just going to make a variable called 'number,' give it a number, 40.
01:59 - And write an If statement that says "If number is less than 50, then
02:08 - ...I will draw this first ellipse."
02:11 - I'm just going to copy this into the If statement and indent it by selecting everything and pressing tab.
02:17 - So now this statement says, "If number is less than 50," (which it is!) "then we'll draw the top ellipse."
02:23 - And if I make number greater than 50 you can see that the top ellipse disappears.
02:28 - Alright, so this thing inside the parentheses is actually a boolean expression.
02:32 - Remember, a math expression is anything that evaluates to a number: like 3 plus 2 plus 4 times 8.
02:40 - So a Boolean expression is anything that evaluates to a Boolean.
02:43 - A good way to check if an expression evaluates to a Boolean, is to stick the word "is"
02:47 - in front of it, and ask it like a question.
02:50 - If it sounds like a yes or no question, then you know it's a boolean expression.
02:53 - So here we can say, "Is number less than 50?" Yes, yes it is, and yes, that is a Boolean expression.
03:00 - On the other hand, if I had something like, "4 + 4" and I tried to ask,
03:04 - "is 4 + 4?" No. Not a Boolean.
03:10 - So back to our If statement. I can actually put anything
03:13 - inside these parentheses, as long as it's a Boolean or Boolean expression.
03:17 - So I could say, "If true," and that ellipse would always be drawn.
03:20 - Or I could say, "If false," and the ellipse would never be drawn.
03:24 - I could also do something like "If 3 is less than 4," which is a Boolean expression
03:29 - that will always evaluate to true, which is kinda pointless,
03:33 - the ellipse will always be drawn, or "3 greater than 4," and that's always going to be false.
03:37 - And I can also assign Booleans to variables, like this:
03:40 - so I'm going to make a new variable, call it winstonIsCool, and assign it
03:48 - a Boolean value, so true or false. Say true because Winston is definitely cool.
03:54 - And now that this variable has a Boolean value, I can copy it
03:58 - and stick it inside this If statement
04:02 - and now you can see the ellipse is drawn, because the value of WinstonIsCool
04:06 - is true.
04:08 - I could also replace this with a Boolean expression, so
04:10 - could be "2 less than 4."
04:15 - Now if you're making a variable that's meant for a Boolean value,
04:18 - you should give it a name that describes the condition when the variable is true.
04:21 - A good way to check if you've picked a good name for your variable
04:24 - is to put it in an If statement and see if it makes sense as a condition.
04:27 - So, forget WinstonIsCool, we already know that's true.
04:31 - Let's say I had a variable called "muffins."
04:34 - All right, "If muffins." Hmm.
04:37 - Well you know what, that doesn't tell me anything, so that's a pretty bad variable name.
04:41 - But if I had "If muffinsAreBaking", then that would tell me that
04:45 - when this variable is true, then the muffins are baking.
04:50 - And don't ask me what muffins, it's not important.
04:54 - So for now let's go back to "If number is less than 50."
04:58 - Cool.
05:00 - Now let's look at some other Boolean expressions.
05:02 - You've already seen "less than" and "greater than"
05:05 - but you can also check if something is "less than or equal to."
05:08 - So let's try, "If number is less than or equal to 48."
05:12 - And we could also say, "If number is greater than or equal to 48."
05:19 - If it is, we will draw this top-right ellipse.
05:25 - Indent that.
05:27 - And if you'd like to check if two things are exactly equal to each other you could say:
05:31 - "If number" and then three equals signs, or "triple equals 48."
05:38 - So that's a lot more like the equals sign you're used to in math,
05:41 - except this time you have three of them in a row.
05:44 - It's kind of overkill, right?
05:46 - And then finally we have if you want to check if two things are NOT equal to,
05:50 - so strictly not equal to, you can say, "If number" and then an exclamation point, and then 2 equals signs, "48".
05:59 - And then we will draw that last ellipse.
06:03 - All right. So if we go back to the top we can see that number is 48, so
06:07 - it is less than or equal to 48, which is why the top-left ellipse is drawn.
06:12 - It's also greater than or equal to 48, it's also equal to 48,
06:16 - but it is not NOT equal to 48, which is why we're missing that bottom-right ellipse.
06:20 - And if we play around with number you can see it changes which ellipses are drawn.
06:26 - So now you guys know about Booleans.
06:29 - And just like math expressions, Boolean expressions can get really complicated.
06:33 - But we will talk about those another time.
