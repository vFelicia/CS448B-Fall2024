01:11 - and oh my things are animating,
and all of this is just CSS.
01:16 - Maybe it's not CSS that you know yet,
01:19 - but if you keep going,
01:20 - all of this will be
available at your fingertips.
01:23 - If you put in enough work,
01:24 - you'll be able to make beautiful websites
01:26 - that look exactly how
you want them to look.
01:29 - Keep going.
