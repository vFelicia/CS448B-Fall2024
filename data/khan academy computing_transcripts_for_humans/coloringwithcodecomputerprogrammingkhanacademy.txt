00:00 - - [Voiceover] I'd like to introduce you
00:02 - to my good friend, Winston.
00:04 - He's a bit sad today,
00:05 - because he's been drawn
in black and white,
00:07 - and he thinks that's boring.
00:09 - Winston is black and white
00:10 - because black is a default
color for outlines,
00:13 - and white is a default
color for filling in shapes.
00:17 - We're going to change
those colors with code.
00:20 - First, let's start with
coloring in the background.
00:23 - I can do that by typing
'background' up here,
00:28 - and it autocompletes the command for me,
00:30 - and my background is red.
00:33 - All the coloring commands are
autocompleted on Khan Academy,
00:36 - because these three parameters are hard
00:39 - to figure out yourself.
00:41 - You see, we need some way to
describe a color to a computer,
00:44 - because computers don't see
colors the way that humans do.
00:48 - Here, we're using something
called RGB colors.
00:52 - The first parameter is
how red the color is.
00:56 - The second is how green it is.
00:58 - And the third is how blue it is.
01:01 - In this one, we're using 255 for red,
01:04 - which is the most red it can be,
01:06 - and zero for green and blue,
01:08 - which are the lowest they can be.
01:11 - And that is why our background looks red.
01:14 - I wanna make this a light
blue instead, though.
01:18 - I could try to figure out exactly how much
01:20 - each number should be.
01:21 - Or I could take a much easier approach.
01:24 - I can just click on the numbers,
01:27 - and use the color picker that pops up,
01:28 - and then drag around
01:30 - until I find a color I like. Perfect.
01:35 - Now, it's important to understand
01:37 - what this background
function is really doing.
01:39 - It's just drawing a big colored square
01:43 - over the entire canvas.
01:45 - If I take this out,
01:46 - and I move it to the end here,
01:49 - then it draws that square over everything,
01:53 - and it looks like they've disappeared.
01:55 - That's why it's really important
01:57 - that the 'background' function is up
02:00 - at the top of our program.
02:02 - Now, let's color his face.
02:04 - Remember that the default
color of our shapes is white.
02:07 - To change that, we need
to use the 'fill' command.
02:12 - I'll type it right here.
02:14 - And once again, it defaults to red.
02:17 - Notice, it didn't just make his face red.
02:20 - It also made every other shape red.
02:22 - That's because the 'fill'
function basically means
02:25 - use this fill color for every shape
02:28 - that comes after this command.
02:31 - Well, I'm going to start
by changing this to yellow.
02:35 - And now, in order to make the eyes
02:38 - and the mouth different colors,
02:39 - I'll just use 'fill' again.
02:41 - So to do his eyes, I'm
going to type 'fill'
02:44 - before the two ellipses for his eyes.
02:47 - Ooh. He looks a little bit
like a demon right now.
02:51 - So we're going to change
that to black. Okay.
02:55 - Now to do his mouth, I'll type 'fill'
02:59 - before the ellipse for his mouth.
03:01 - And I'll keep it as red,
03:03 - because, hey, it's a mouth.
03:05 - Okay. Now that it looks
like a bright and sunny day,
03:09 - Winston might want to go running.
03:12 - Let's give him a headband
03:14 - to soak up all the sweat.
03:18 - I'll use the 'line' function
03:20 - to draw a line across his forehead.
03:23 - And I already know some good
coordinates for that. Nice.
03:29 - I want this headband to be a lot thicker,
03:32 - because he's going to sweat a lot.
03:34 - For that, I'll use a new
command, 'strokeWeight.'
03:39 - And I need a pass at a
number to say how thick
03:42 - we want this line to be.
03:44 - Let's try 20.
03:46 - It's pretty good,
03:48 - but I'm just gonna make it
a little bigger. Okay. Good.
03:52 - Of course, I want this
headband to be more colorful.
03:55 - Cuz you know, black, not so great.
03:57 - To color the headband, I have to use
04:00 - another new command, 'stroke.'
04:05 - And let me change that to that color.
04:09 - That looks good.
04:11 - The 'stroke' command
04:13 - is a way that we color
the outlines of shapes
04:17 - and the way that we set
the colors for lines.
04:20 - That's different from 'fill,'
04:22 - while fills the inside
of a shape with color.
04:24 - A line doesn't really have an inside.
04:28 - So 'fill' will never affect a line.
04:31 - We also have a function that we can use
04:33 - to turn off outlines entirely.
04:36 - I'll type that up here, 'noStroke.'
04:40 - Notice we now have no outlines
04:43 - around our face, our eyes, and our mouth.
04:46 - We can still see our headband,
04:48 - because we have got that
'stroke' command right before it.
04:51 - And 'stroke' basically
turns 'noStroke' off
04:55 - once the program sees it.
04:57 - Okay. So that's what you need
to know color your drawings.
05:01 - The important thing is to make sure
05:03 - that you pay attention to
the order of your commands.
05:06 - So you should always set the color
05:09 - before you draw the
shapes that you want to be
05:12 - colored with that color.
05:14 - Now, go make the world
a more colorful place.
