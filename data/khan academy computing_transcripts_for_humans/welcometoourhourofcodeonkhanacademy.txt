00:00 - - [Voiceover] Heyyaz!
00:01 - I'm Pamela, from the Khan Academy team.
00:04 - So you're here for Hour of Code, right?
00:08 - That's awesome!
00:09 - I can still remember my
first hour of coding,
00:12 - when I was a little kid,
00:13 - and now I'm on my 10,000th hour of coding,
00:16 - and it's still really, really fun.
00:19 - There are tons of ways to learn to code,
00:21 - and there's so many things
you can do with code,
00:23 - like making games, if you like PAC-MAN,
00:26 - or Angry Birds, or Minecraft,
00:29 - or, if you like Science,
you can use programming
00:31 - to visualize the way the Universe works
00:33 - and help other people
understand it better.
00:36 - If you like Medicine, you
could help doctors understand
00:38 - what's going inside the human body,
00:40 - because it's really crazy.
00:42 - You could make robots,
like self-driving cars.
00:45 - You could analyze data.
00:46 - You could make websites like Khan Academy.
00:48 - There's so much you can do.
00:51 - Here, on Khan Academy, you'll
spend your Hour of Code
00:54 - learning to make
computer-generated drawings.
00:57 - We can't cover that
much in so little time,
00:59 - but we hope you're excited
by your first taste of code
01:01 - and wanna go deeper.
01:03 - Here's what you'll do in the next hour.
01:06 - First, you'll watch these
interactive talk-throughs.
01:09 - They're kind of like
videos, where we write code
01:11 - and we talk while we're writing it,
01:13 - and you can see the result of
the code on the right side,
01:16 - and you can pause it, just like a video.
01:18 - But, even better than a
video, you can actually edit
01:20 - the code that we've written
01:22 - and see what happens when you change it,
01:25 - and then you can turn it back
on when you wanna keep going.
01:27 - Now, remember, there's audio, so make sure
01:29 - you have speakers or headphones on
01:30 - when you're watching these.
01:32 - Next, you'll do a coding challenge.
01:34 - This is how you practice
what you just learned,
01:36 - and earn points for completing it,
01:38 - going through each of the
steps until you get them done.
01:41 - Try to get through each
challenge to the end,
01:43 - but, if you don't, and
you're getting frustrated,
01:45 - don't worry, just keep going
to the next talk-through.
01:49 - Finally, at the end,
you'll do a more free form
01:52 - creative project, where
there's no right answer
01:54 - and the point is just to have fun
01:56 - while using what you've learned.
01:58 - And, hey, if this takes
you longer than an hour,
02:01 - that's totally okay with us.
02:03 - Here, at Khan Academy,
02:04 - we believe that everybody
should learn at their own pace.
02:07 - We'll always be here for
you to keep learning,
02:09 - no matter how long it takes.
02:11 - Ready to get started?!
02:12 - Let's have a Coding Party!
02:14 - Woo-hoo!

[Voiceover] Heyyaz! I'm Pamela, from the Khan Academy team. So you're here for Hour of Code, right? That's awesome! I can still remember my first hour of coding, when I was a little kid, and now I'm on my 10,000th hour of coding, and it's still really, really fun.
