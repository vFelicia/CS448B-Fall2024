With timestamps:

00:00 - We're back to our Winston drawing program,
but I've added some text to it.
00:06 - See, what I wanna do is position a Winston
underneath each of these labels,
00:11 - to show him at each point in life.
00:13 - Right now he's all over the place.
That's because we are setting the
00:16 - faceX and the faceY to 
random numbers inside the function.
00:20 - What we wanna say is, "Here's the exact 
position I want you to draw this Winston"
00:26 - I wanna be able to specify that position 
every time I call the function,
00:30 - the same way we do with ellipse() and rect().
00:34 - I wanna put a Winston here,here, 
and a Winston here, and a Winston here,
00:40 - and I don't want just random places
every time I call the function.
00:43 - In order to do that, we have to specify 
"parameters" for the function,
00:48 - both in our function definition
-- at the top here --
00:52 - and in our function call, down here,
when we actually call it.
00:57 - For drawWinston(), 
we pass it faceX and faceY,
01:02 - and have it use those values that we pass
in instead of generating them randomly.
01:09 - Let's by thinking about what we'd 
pass into these function calls down here.
01:14 - We position the Winstons under each text, 
so we'd probably want the x and y of each
01:20 - Winston to be similar to the numbers 
we passed into the text() functions.
01:24 - Maybe,10 pixels lower in the y. 
The first one would be 10 and 30,
01:32 - and then maybe 200, 230...
10, 230... 200, 230.
01:40 - It's the same as the text coordinates,
I'm just adding 10 to each y, '
01:44 - cause I want it just a little bit lower.
01:49 - Winston hasn't moved. 
We haven't told our function up here that
01:55 - we're passing it parameters,
so it's still using these random values.
01:59 - In order to tell this function,"We're 
gonna give you this information instead,"
02:03 - we have to give the parameters
names inside these parentheses.
02:08 - We'll call it faceX and faceY,
separate them by a comma,
02:14 - We're calling it that since we're using 
it to refer to them inside the function
02:20 - That way we don't have to 
rewrite the rest of our code.
02:23 - But still, nothing has happened; 
Winston is still all over the place.
02:28 - If you look at the very top 
of our function,
02:31 - we're overwriting faceX and faceY 
with random values, still.
02:35 - So, all we have to do
is delete these lines...
02:38 - Now, faceX and faceY are getting
passed into the function,
02:45 - and it's using the values 
that we're calling it with here.
02:49 - I didn't quite position Winston correctly,
because I forgot that text gets positioned
02:55 - according to the upper left,and the face 
gets positioned according to the center.
03:01 - I need to go and tinker with my 
numbers a little bit here, right?
03:06 - I need to move the x over a lot, and move 
this over, okay... so that's our toddler..
03:12 - We'll go through, and change 
what I'm passing into the function,
03:18 - I don't have to change 
the function definition at all,
03:22 - It's always gonna take 
whatever values we pass in.
03:25 - Just like with ellipse() and rect().
03:28 - I've positioned it, but
I've noticed is that Winston is too big.
03:33 - He's overlapping, he doesn't fit.
03:35 - I've put the code to 
draw him in a function,
03:39 - I can change the size 
of all of them at once
03:42 - by changing one line 
of code that draws the ellipse.
03:45 - If we make him like 190, 
Winston's going on a diet, by 190.
03:50 - Now he's gonna fit better and 
then ya know I could keep tweaking
03:55 - so I could actually get him
inside there, right? Cool.
04:01 - Let's do a review of what this code does.
It defines a function called drawWinston()
04:08 - and says this function takes two values, 
and it labels them faceX and faceY,
04:14 - these values come in as variables that
we can use anywhere inside our function,
04:19 - just like we used to use the variables 
that we declared at the top
04:23 - And then we can call this function 
whenever we want after we declare it,
04:29 - we can pass in different values, 
so it'll use those new values each time.
04:33 - You've seen what's cool about functions. 
We can come up with code that
04:38 - we think would be really useful to reuse,
but we can also use parameters to say
04:42 - "Hey, here's a little something you can 
change about this code, to customize it."
04:46 - It's like a recipe. 
You write down the general instructions,
04:49 - and if you realize you suddenly 
need to feed 4 Winstons instead of 1,
04:52 - you don't have to start all over, 
you just modify the original instructions
04:55 - and multiply everything by 4.
04:57 - Now you can start thinking about the
recipes in your code! Yummy.
