With timestamps:

00:01 - Let's start programming.
00:02 - We need to begin
with understanding shapes, the basics.
00:05 - But don't worry, soon enough,
00:06 - your shapes will be
flying around the screen,
00:08 - and changing colors, and all kinds
of other cool programming things.
00:11 - Just stay with us!
00:12 - So let's start with drawing rectangles.
00:14 - We type rect for rectangle,
00:16 - then open parenthesis, and then four numbers - 10, 20, 100, 200 -
00:18 - and I'll explain what these mean
in a moment--
00:21 - then close parenthesis, and at the end,
we'll just put a semicolon.
00:23 - Look, amazing, a rectangle!
00:25 - And that was so neat,
so let's do that again.
00:27 - We can try different numbers this time.
00:30 - Maybe bigger numbers,
(300, 240 -
00:32 - and then smaller numbers at the end,
- 10, 20)
00:34 - and hey look, another rectangle!
00:36 - In fact, if we try changing
this first number to make it smaller,
00:39 - it'll start moving.
00:40 - If we change this last number
to make it bigger and then smaller,
00:43 - then it's just going to grow 
and then shrink.
00:46 - Interesting!
00:47 - So, how is all this magic happening,
you might wonder?
00:51 - Well, remember that your computer
00:52 - is just like a really intelligent
and obedient dog.
00:55 - With a dog, maybe we could tell it
to sit, stay, even roll over.
00:59 - You would just have to give the command.
01:02 - So in code, how would you tell
your computer dog to sit?
01:05 - Well, the way you would do that
01:08 - is you would write
the command name, say "sit,"
01:11 - and then you would put
two parentheses afterwards
01:13 - to tell it to go do that command
you just said,
01:15 - and then you put a semicolon
at the end just to say,
01:17 - "Yeah, this command is over."
01:19 - Then your computer dog would sit down.
01:22 - Well of course, your computer
on Khan Academy isn't a dog,
01:25 - so it doesn't know how
to sit or roll over,
01:27 - but it does know how to draw rectangles
when you tell it rect,
01:30 - and that's kind of neat too, right?
01:32 - So, that's what 
we're going to do on this line.
01:34 - We'll say the command rect,
which is just the name,
01:37 - and then we'll put the open parenthesis and the close parenthesis
01:39 - to say "go do that",
01:41 - and then we'll put the semicolon at the end.
01:43 - That's how your computer knows
to go do this special ability, rect.
01:47 - Okay, so now let's go back to our rect.
01:49 - We have the command name right here
and we have those parentheses.
01:53 - But what about all these crazy numbers?
01:56 - Well, the idea is that the computer
really doesn't know enough
01:59 - if you just tell it rect.
02:01 - To see this, imagine if I gave you
a piece of paper,
02:05 - and I said I wanted you
to draw a rectangle
02:07 - exactly the way I wanted it to be.
02:09 - Unless you can read my mind,
02:11 - you're going to have
some questions right away.
02:14 - First, you might wonder,
02:15 - "Where do you want me
to draw the rectangle?"
02:19 - And then, what I would say is,
02:21 - "How about we just agree
02:22 - that this left side of the paper
that I just gave you,
02:25 - let's just call that zero.
02:27 - And let's just agree that this right side
is going to be 400."
02:30 - Then I could give you a number, 
say like 100,
02:33 - and you would know that that's
going to be right about there, maybe,
02:36 - roughly.
02:37 - Except that will satisfy you for a moment,
but then you'd think,
02:39 - "Okay, that tells me how far across,
but how about how far up and down?"
02:43 - Then I could give you another number,
let's say maybe 200,
02:47 - and I would say,
"This is the top, this is 0,
02:49 - and again we'll just say that the bottom,
that's going to be 400."
02:52 - And you would think,
02:53 - "200, that's going to be
right in the middle here."
02:57 - And that's perfect,
because now you think, and you say,
02:59 - "Okay great, I'm going to draw
your rectangle right here
03:02 - because it's 100 across, 
and it's 200 down."
03:06 - Except that's still not enough,
because now what are you asking?
03:09 - Right, you're wondering,
"How big do you want the rectangle?"
03:12 - And I would say, 
"How about like, 150 wide?"
03:17 - And you'd think, 
"Well, this is 100, and this is 400,
03:20 - so if we want it to be 150 wide,
maybe we're gonna go to here?"
03:25 - And you think,
"Okay, cool, 150 wide, about."
03:29 - Then you'd say,
"How tall do you want it?"
03:31 - I would say, "Not very tall. 
How about 50 tall?"
03:33 - You'll say, "Okay, well 50,
maybe that's going to be about that tall?"
03:37 - Then you would say, "Awesome!
03:39 - I know exactly where you want
your rectangle,
03:40 - exactly what it should look like.
03:42 - I'll go ahead and draw it."
03:45 - That's a lot of work
for a rectangle, isn't it?
03:47 - But the idea is just by giving you
those four numbers--
03:50 - remember we said 100 across, 200 down,
03:54 - 150 wide, and then just 50 tall--
03:57 - we now are exactly on the same page
03:59 - about what this rectangle
should look like.
04:02 - That's how the computer works too.
04:04 - You can just write the command name
like we said earlier,
04:06 - write the open parenthesis and then
add in these four numbers,
04:09 - 100, 200, 150, and then 50,
04:14 - close parenthesis and then a semicolon.
04:16 - And it will draw a rectangle
exactly where we wanted it to be.
04:20 - I guess if we're honest with ourselves,
04:22 - that's not really where
we wanted the rectangle.
04:24 - It's not where we drew it, right?
04:25 - So our numbers are a little bit off.
04:27 - Let's go ahead and say we want it
to really match exactly what we drew.
04:31 - We'll move this
so it's a little bit further over,
04:34 - a little bit less up and down,
04:37 - a little bit skinnier,
and maybe a tiny bit less tall.
04:42 - Now we have it that our rectangle
pretty much exactly matches what we drew,
04:46 - because we understood
what each of these numbers meant,
04:48 - and we could change it
so it looks like we want it to.
04:52 - Now let's think about drawing
another rectangle.
04:54 - Because the beauty of this is,
04:56 - we can draw rectangles
wherever we want now.
04:59 - How about we draw it
all the way in this upper corner,
05:02 - all the way up there?
05:03 - Let's think of where that would be.
05:06 - I guess that would be like 0 across,
0 up and down,
05:09 - and maybe pretty small,
let's say just 50 wide
05:13 - and maybe just 10 tall,
like a pretty small rectangle.
05:16 - We can go ahead and do that.
05:18 - We'll type rect,
05:19 - and then separating
these parameters with commas
05:22 - we'll go ahead and say,
"Alright, cool".
05:25 - Well, not so cool because we have
this error message that's saying,
05:28 - "Oh no!
It looks like you're missing a closing parenthesis"
05:31 - And we say, "Oh yeah, we are."
05:32 - So phew, we'll put it back in.
It looks great, right?
05:34 - Well, not so great because now
we have another message
05:36 - saying we have a missing semicolon.
05:38 - This one is also correct;
we could just press "Show Me Where"
05:40 - and it would point
to the line we just wrote.
05:42 - And we just remember,
05:43 - "Oh yeah, semicolons are like periods
at the ends of the sentences
05:46 - to end our lines, and we forgot one!"
05:48 - But we can just put it back, no big deal,
and everything is good again.
05:52 - Check it out, a tiny little rectangle, 
exactly like we wanted.
05:55 - Just like before, we can grow it
so that it's bigger,
05:58 - we can move it around,
06:00 - and we can position it
exactly where we want it to be.
06:03 - So now you know in detail
exactly how this rect thing works.
06:06 - We covered what these numbers mean,
06:08 - and how you always need to put
the command name, the parentheses,
06:12 - have a comma separate the numbers,
and put the semicolon at the end.
06:15 - It seems like a lot,
06:16 - but you can go ahead and try it
for yourself and get a feel for it.
06:19 - Next time, we'll learn about
making more shapes,
06:21 - and then we'll move on to awesome things
06:23 - like making them colorful
and having them fly around the screen.
