00:00 - - Welcome, let's talk about the web,
00:02 - the thing that you're using right now.
00:05 - The web is this fast network
of connected computers,
00:08 - and as of 2014, there
are literally more than
00:11 - a billion websites - a billion!
00:15 - When I was a kid, we only had one million,
00:17 - and we thought we were cool.
00:18 - What do we use websites for?
00:20 - Well in the beginning,
researchers used websites to share
00:23 - their research, like on
high-energy particle colliders.
00:26 - But now everybody uses it
for pretty much everything.
00:30 - Maybe you use a social network
to chat with your family,
00:33 - a photo website for sharing photos
00:35 - of your adorable kitty cats,
00:37 - a travel website to decide
where to go on an exotic trip,
00:40 - or a news website to figure out
00:41 - what's going on in the world.
00:44 - And of course, you must be using
00:45 - the Khan Academy website to learn.
00:48 - So what's your favorite website?
00:52 - Actually, I have a better question.
00:55 - What website do you wish
existed, but doesn't yet?
00:59 - Maybe a website about yourself
01:00 - or about something that you love?
01:03 - The cool thing is you can
program a website yourself,
01:06 - and you can learn how to
do it here on Khan Academy.
01:09 - Start brainstorming what you want to make
01:10 - because you'll be able
to do it soon enough.
01:14 - First, let's back up a bit
and clear up some terminology.
01:17 - What is the "web," exactly?
01:20 - Well, like I said, it's a bunch of
01:22 - connected computers that have websites.
01:25 - When a computer is connected to the web
01:26 - and spitting out a website, we
call that computer a "server"
01:30 - because it's "serving" the website.
01:34 - A website is written
using three languages:
01:36 - HTML, for marking up the website content;
01:39 - CSS, for styling it;
01:42 - and JavaScript, for making it interactive.
01:46 - How do users like you
actually see those websites?
01:50 - Well you use an app dedicated
for website browsing,
01:53 - like Chrome, Firefox,
or Internet Explorer,
01:56 - and we call those apps "browsers."
01:59 - Browsers try to all show the
same website the same way,
02:01 - but they do have their
differences, which is why
02:03 - we sometimes say, "Oops,
there's a bug in that browser.
02:06 - "Try another one."
02:08 - Which browser are you using right now?
02:12 - Well you must be using that browser
02:13 - from some sort of device, like a laptop,
02:15 - phone, tablet, or even a smart TV,
02:18 - and we call those devices "clients."
02:21 - Clients can be really different.
02:23 - Some are way smaller than others,
02:25 - some have touchscreens,
others have keyboards,
02:27 - some are black and white.
02:29 - So websites have to try to work well
02:32 - in all sorts of clients.
02:34 - What client are you using right now?
02:36 - And that's the web.
02:37 - Well, the two-minute version.
02:39 - There's lots more to learn about the web,
02:41 - but now I think it's about
time to start having you write
02:43 - some HTML and CSS to
make your own web pages.

Welcome, let's talk about the web, the thing that you're using right now. The web is this fast network of connected computers, and as of 2014, there are literally more than a billion websites a billion! When I was a kid, we only had one million, and we thought we were cool. What do we use websites for? Well in the beginning, researchers used websites to share their research, like on highenergy particle colliders. But now everybody uses it for pretty much everything.

There's lots more to learn about the web, but now I think it's about time to start having you write some HTML and CSS to make your own web pages.
