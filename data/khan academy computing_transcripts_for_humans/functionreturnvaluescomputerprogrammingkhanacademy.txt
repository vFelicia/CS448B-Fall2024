00:00 - We're back with our program
that uses a function
00:03 - to draw Winston four times.
00:05 - And I've changed it
to actually show what age he is
00:08 - at each point of life,
and you'll see why soon.
00:11 - But first I need to tell you
something about Winston:
00:13 - Winston has an addiction to donuts.
00:15 - He eats three of them a day.
00:18 - It's probably why his face
is so big and yellow.
00:21 - So to warn Winston about
how bad donuts are for him,
00:25 - I wanna modify this program
to show how many donuts
00:28 - he's eaten total
at each point in his life.
00:32 - For example, when he's two years old,
00:35 - that means he's
eaten 3 times 365 times 2,
00:41 - so three in a day,
times 365 days, times 2 years.
00:45 - And we'll just display that
underneath that header, so wow!
00:50 - Two thousand donuts, that
is a lot of donuts for a two-year-old.
00:53 - Now when he's 14 years old, let's see,
he's had 3 times 365 times 14
01:04 - And that is 15,000 donuts. All right.
01:08 - So I could keep doing this math,
but I'm beginning to notice a pattern.
01:13 - I'm repeating my calculation here,
01:16 - and I'm just changing one thing about it:
the number of years.
01:20 - Whenever I see repeated code like this,
01:22 - I think to myself, "Hmm,
can I make that into a function?"
01:28 - Yeah, definitely, we can.
So let's do that now.
01:32 - I'll define my function up here
01:34 - and call it calcTotalDonuts = function
01:40 - And it's going to take one parameter,
the number of years,
01:44 - because that's the only thing
that we're changing
01:46 - each time we do this calculation.
01:49 - And then inside, we'll do the calculation,
01:52 - and save it into a variable,
so it'll be 3 times 365 times numYears.
02:00 - All right, so now that we
have that function,
02:03 - I'm going to replace this expression here
with calcTotalDonuts,
02:08 - the call to the function,
and passing in "2".
02:12 - Okay, um, well now we
don't see any total at all.
02:17 - Hmm, okay, what happened?
02:19 - Well, our function
did calculate the total, here,
02:23 - but it didn't tell anybody
about that total.
02:26 - It's like if a teacher calls on you
in class to answer a question
02:30 - and you answer it in your head
02:31 - but you're too shy to say the answer.
02:33 - You've done the work, but your teacher's
never gonna know about it.
02:37 - If we want the function
to communicate a value
02:39 - to whoever called it, the function
has to explicitly return the value.
02:45 - So for a function to return a value,
we need to type return,
02:49 - and then whatever it wants to return.
02:51 - Maybe it's a variable
or a value or an expression,
02:55 - so here we'll say
return totalDonuts, okay?
02:57 - So whoever's calling that function's
going to get this response.
03:01 - And now our value displays, yay!
03:04 - And actually we
can shorten our function,
03:06 - we don't even have to
store it into a variable,
03:08 - we can just take
this whole expression here
03:10 - put it in the return,
and then it's just a one-liner. Nice.
03:15 - All right, so now we can go through
03:17 - and calculate the total donuts
at each point in life
03:20 - by just calling this function
and passing in the number of years.
03:24 - Um, let's see, it's calcTotalDonuts(25),
03:28 - position is correctly, calcTotalDonuts(65)
03:36 - Okay! Wow, so if he makes it to 65,
03:40 - he will eat 70,000 donuts.
That is a lot of donuts.
03:45 - I don't think Winston's
gonna make it. (laugh)
03:48 - But now that we've
made it into a function,
03:50 - it's really easy for us
to change parts of it.
03:53 - Like if Winston sees this and says,
03:55 - "Whoa, whoa, that's a lot.
What if I just ate one a day?"
03:58 - Okay, well we can just go here,
change this one number,
04:02 - and see everything change.
04:04 - So that's 23,000. Still a lot.
So maybe Winston's like,
04:07 - "All right, all right, what if
I just had one a week?"
04:10 - Yeah, that's reasonable, okay.
04:12 - So then we could just change 365 to 50,
04:15 - because there's like
50 weeks in a year, right?
04:18 - Okay, that's a lot better, right?
3,000 donuts, that seems reasonable.
04:22 - All right, so if you see,
with functions and return values,
04:26 - we can save code and save lives.
