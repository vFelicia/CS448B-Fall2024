00:01 - Every app that you use is full of data.
00:04 - On Khan Academy, we store data about users
00:07 - and badges and progress.
00:09 - On Facebook they store
data about who you are,
00:12 - who your friends are,
and what they're posting.
00:14 - On Bank of America they store
data about how much money
00:17 - you have and what accounts that's in.
00:19 - How do these apps store data?
00:22 - Well, they use a database
which is a program
00:24 - that helps store data and
provides functionality
00:26 - for adding, modifying,
and querying that data,
00:29 - and doing that all fast.
00:31 - Databases come in many forms,
but a really popular type
00:34 - of database is called
a relational database.
00:38 - It stores each kind of data in a table,
00:41 - which is kind of like storing
data in a spreadsheet.
00:44 - A row represents an item,
00:45 - and a column represents
properties about that item.
00:49 - For example, to store data
about Khan Academy users,
00:52 - we'd have a users table with a
row for each user and columns
00:55 - for properties like their
nickname and location.
00:58 - Relational databases
make it particularly easy
01:00 - to form relationships between tables.
01:03 - For example, in order to
store Khan Academy users
01:05 - and their badges, we
might have a users table
01:08 - and a badges table, and
then a user badges table
01:11 - to remember which users
earned which badges,
01:14 - just by mapping user IDs to badge IDs.
01:17 - That's a more efficient
form of storage than having
01:18 - to repeat everything about the user
01:21 - and everything about the badge
in the user badges table.
01:24 - Most database come with a
query language to interact
01:26 - with the database.
01:28 - SQL is a language designed
entirely for accessing databases
01:32 - and is the most popular of them.
01:34 - With SQL, we can create
tables, change data,
01:38 - get back the data we're interested in.
01:40 - Like if we wanna find
out which users joined
01:42 - in the last week or which
users have a particular badge.
01:45 - That's what we're going to teach here.
01:47 - And you'll actually get to try
out SQL here in the browser
01:50 - using SQL Lite, a particular
implementation of it.
01:53 - You won't be able to
write the whole app here,
01:55 - but when you're done learning SQL,
01:57 - you'll have a much better understanding
01:59 - of how data is stored
in the apps that you use
02:01 - and be able to use SQL
if you ever build an app.

[Instructor] The world is full of data. Every app that you use is full of data. On Khan Academy, we store data about users and badges and progress. On Facebook they store data about who you are, who your friends are, and what they're posting. On Bank of America they store data about how much money you have and what accounts that's in. How do these apps store data? Well, they use a database which is a program that helps store data and provides functionality for adding, modifying, and querying that data, and doing that all fast. Databases come in many forms, but a really popular type of database is called a relational database. It stores each kind of data in a table, which is kind of like storing data in a spreadsheet. A row represents an item, and a column represents properties about that item. For example, to store data about Khan Academy users, we'd have a users table with a row for each user and columns for properties like their nickname and location.
