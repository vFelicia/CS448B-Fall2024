00:00 - - [Voiceover] We've now learned how
00:01 - to make a pretty complete web page
00:03 - with all sorts of marked
up texts and images
00:05 - but it's lacking something, style.
00:08 - My web page here looks the same
00:09 - as the webpages you've been making.
00:10 - Black text, white background, same font,
00:13 - everything laid out from top to bottom.
00:15 - You've been on the web and you've seen
00:17 - that web pages can look very
different from each other.
00:20 - Look around on Khan Academy at
00:21 - all the different colors
and fonts and sizes.
00:24 - In fact, let's do this now,
pause this talk through
00:28 - and look at a few different websites.
00:29 - What's different about each of them?
00:31 - What do you like or
dislike about their style?
00:35 - I'll just wait right here.
00:38 - It's important to see how
different web pages can be
00:40 - because pretty soon you'll figure out how
00:42 - to make you web pages look different
00:44 - and you wanna do that in a way
00:45 - that makes you happy
because it represents you
00:48 - but it also makes other users happy too.
00:51 - With this all our web pages we need
00:52 - to learn a whole new language CSS
00:55 - that stands for Cascading Style Sheets
00:57 - and it's a way of defining
styles that will apply
00:59 - to different parts of our web page.
01:01 - We embed CSS inside of HTML
but it isn't actually HTML
01:06 - so we have to learn a whole new language
01:08 - and try not to confuse HTML with CSS.
01:11 - We'll see how we can use
CSS to style all sorts
01:13 - of aspects of our web page like the font,
01:15 - sizes and layouts but we'll start
01:17 - with something that's pretty fun.
01:19 - Color, how about we change some headings
01:22 - on our web page to a nice grassy green.
01:25 - To start, we need to add a style tag
01:28 - to the head of our page.
01:31 - When the browser sees that, it will think,
01:33 - "Okay, everything inside here is CSS.
01:37 - "I'll use my CSS parser to understand it
01:40 - "instead of my HTML parser."
01:43 - Inside here, we'll add a CSS style rule.
01:48 - A style rule has a selector which tells
01:50 - a browser what part of a web page
01:51 - to style and declarations, which tell
01:54 - the browser how to style their part.
01:56 - If we want to style all
the h2s on our page,
02:00 - we'll type the selector h2 and
then we'll do curly braces.
02:06 - Make sure they're curly, not square
02:07 - or round those won't work.
02:10 - Inside, we'll put our declarations
02:12 - which have properties and values.
02:14 - To change the text color,
we use the color property
02:19 - then we put a colon and now we
need to come up with a value.
02:22 - We need to tell the browser
what color we're interested in.
02:25 - Well we could just
write green and it would
02:29 - understand it because
green's a common color
02:32 - but that's not the green I wanted.
02:33 - I want a grassy green.
02:35 - If I write grassy green, uh oh.
02:39 - Now the browser gets confused and makes
02:41 - the headings black again because
02:43 - it's never heard of grassy green.
02:45 - If we want to be able to
specify any color at all,
02:48 - then we need to use something
called the RGB Spectrum
02:51 - which maybe you've heard
about in art class.
02:54 - You don't need to be
an expert in it though
02:56 - because we have an RGB
color picker for you here.
02:58 - To use it, just replace
this with RGB parentheses
03:04 - and a color picker will pop up.
03:06 - You can move your mouse inside of it
03:08 - and pick a color and you
can see the color update
03:10 - in real-time and when you're happy click.
03:14 - Now do you notice how
there were three numbers
03:17 - that it changed in our RGB parentheses?
03:20 - That's the red, green and blue
03:22 - components that make up that color.
03:26 - Okay, the neat thing
about this CSS selector h2
03:29 - that we used is that selects
all the h2s on the page
03:33 - so we can change multiple headlines
03:35 - because we want all of
those h2s to be green.
03:39 - It's consistent for all those
h2s it finds on the page.
03:43 - If you keep going with CSS, you can learn
03:45 - about many other ways of
selecting parts of a page
03:47 - like if you wanted one of those h2s.
03:50 - You can go pretty far with
these tag based selectors.
03:54 - Let's add another CSS style rule.
03:56 - This time to make the
background a sky blue.
03:59 - How would we color the
background on a page?
04:02 - Well, which tag
encompasses the whole page,
04:05 - it's not the h1s, it's not the p,
04:08 - it's not the image, it's the body tag.
04:11 - Remember, everything visible is always
04:14 - inside that body tag.
04:16 - If we want to style the entire the page,
04:18 - we need to use a selector
to select that tag.
04:22 - So we'll write body.
04:26 - Now, instead of color,
we'll write background
04:29 - color, colon
04:33 - and then rgb parentheses.
04:36 - We get our color gripper
and I'll pop it up
04:39 - and pick a blue that makes me think
04:41 - of frolicking bunnies and cumulus clouds.
04:45 - Ta da, look at my stylish page.
04:49 - There are hundreds more CSS properties
04:51 - besides color and background color
04:54 - but those ones are fun
to get started with.
04:56 - In fact, after I'm done
talking, play around
04:59 - with the colors I picked
and customize this page
05:01 - to be more your style than mine, okay?
05:05 - Go.
