00:00 - - (Voiceover) Now I'm
going to show you a few
00:02 - more tips for processing forms
00:04 - using this crocodile
order form as an example.
00:08 - The user will pick the species
00:10 - and we deliver the crocodile.
00:13 - Although, it's not actually
legal to send crocodiles
00:16 - to people in the mail, so
we'll do the next best thing.
00:20 - We'll show them a picture
of the ordered crocodile
00:23 - straight in their
webpage, instantaneously.
00:26 - Alright, so let's look at our setup.
00:30 - We've got a similar
form like we had before.
00:33 - A 'form' tag, a 'select,' a 'button.'
00:37 - And then down here we've
got our 'script' tags.
00:40 - Now, inside this second script tag,
00:42 - I've set up this object, crocImages,
00:46 - which maps species to URLs,
00:50 - and we're gonna end up using this later
00:52 - when we wanna show a
picture of the crocodile
00:54 - that they ordered.
00:56 - And, like before, I've got
my pseudocode at the bottom
00:59 - that describes what I want to accomplish.
01:02 - When the user submits the form,
01:03 - we'll check which species they ordered,
01:05 - and display an image of it.
01:08 - So, let's start coding that.
01:12 - The first thing we want, the event
01:14 - for when the user submits the form.
01:16 - Like before, I'll just attach
an event listener to the form
01:21 - and I'll listen for the 'submit' event.
01:28 - And pass it the callback function,
01:31 - and, once again, we want to make sure that
01:34 - the browser doesn't send this form
01:37 - to a server and reload the page,
01:39 - so we want to prevent
the default behavior,
01:42 - and we can do that by calling
'event.preventDefault'.
01:47 - Alright, so now we need to
implement this JavaScript here.
01:51 - The first thing we wanna do is check
01:53 - which species the user
selected in the dropdown.
01:57 - So we need to find a dropdown in the page.
02:01 - Let's go up an look at the HTML
to see how we can select it.
02:06 - This one doesn't have an ID,
and it doesn't have a class,
02:12 - but it does have this name attribute
02:15 - and we can use this CSS attribute selector
02:18 - to find the elements based on name.
02:21 - Let's do that.
02:23 - I'll make a variable,
it's going to store it.
02:27 - Start that with a dollar
sign, $crocSpecies =
02:31 - then for attribute selector
we start with a bracket,
02:36 - and then the attribute name,
02:38 - and then the attribute value,
02:40 - and so that'll find whatever element
02:41 - on the page has an attribute
name with this value.
02:46 - So that should match this.
02:49 - Alright, so is this selector unique enough
02:53 - to only find a dropdown
that we're interested in?
02:58 - Well, within a form, a
name should be unique.
03:02 - But, theoretically, there could
be multiple forms on a page,
03:07 - and each of those forms could have
03:10 - an input with a 'name=species'
03:13 - so it not, this is not the
most unique selector here.
03:19 - That means that we should
'scope' the selector.
03:24 - We want to 'scope' the selector so that
03:26 - it only selects dropdowns
with name=species
03:31 - that are inside this form here.
03:36 - One simple way of doing that is
03:38 - to just put 'croc-form'
in the CSS selector,
03:42 - and that just makes it a lot more specific
03:44 - and makes sure it's only gonna match
03:47 - things with that attribute name
and value inside that form.
03:52 - There is another way doing
it that we prefer, however.
03:55 - Okay, so let me explain.
03:57 - When we listen to an event
on an element, like here,
04:01 - jQuery makes that element accessible
04:04 - inside the callback
function in a special way.
04:08 - It makes that element the
context of the function.
04:12 - Storing it inside this,
remember this from before?
04:17 - So that this is the 'DOM element' and its,
04:23 - its the DOM element thats
this croc-form here.
04:29 - So, if we want to turn it
back into a jQuery object,
04:32 - we can wrap this in the jQuery function,
04:36 - giving us a jQuery object.
04:39 - So, that means since the
submit happens on the form,
04:44 - this should be the same as this.
04:49 - Alright, so this is nice
that we can reference this,
04:52 - because that means we dont have to repeat
04:54 - the selector here, cause that
kinda redundant and you say
04:57 - this, this is what we're interested in.
05:01 - But we don't just want
the form, we want that,
05:03 - we want that dropdown inside of it, right?
05:06 - Well, once we have a jQuery
object, we can call 'find'
05:11 - on that jQuery object and
that limits our search
05:14 - to only look inside this element.
05:19 - So we can take our CSS selector from here,
05:23 - and pass it to the 'find' method,
05:26 - and that should then scope this search
05:29 - to being children of this element.
05:33 - Okay, so this, I'm going to take it,
05:37 - and put it here,
05:41 - and now, now it's scoped.
05:44 - Now I can be confident that
it's only going to find things
05:49 - that match the selector
that are inside the form
05:52 - that the submit event
happened to, alright?
05:56 - Cool, whew.
05:58 - So, now we've got this
crocSpecies variable
06:02 - that's storing a jQuery collection
06:04 - with a dropdown inside of it.
06:07 - Once again, we want the
value of that dropdown,
06:10 - the string representing the
option that the user selected.
06:14 - So for that, we need to
call the val function,
06:17 - so let's just make a new
variable to hold the string,
06:22 - and we'll reference the element,
06:24 - and then we'll call 'val' on it,
06:27 - and so jQuery will know that
its going to look inside
06:29 - that select, find the
option that user selected,
06:32 - and give back the value,
which is going to be a string,
06:36 - either freshwater, saltwater, or american.
06:41 - Cool, and once again, if you want,
06:43 - you can 'console.log' it at this point
06:45 - and make sure that it's working.
06:48 - Let's get to the fun stuff, though.
06:49 - Let's display an image of the appropriate
06:52 - crocodile to the user.
06:54 - So first, I will use
jQuery to create an image,
06:58 - just like this, and I'll
give that image a width,
07:05 - and I will set the source using 'attr',
07:11 - and here, I need to decide on the URL.
07:15 - It should be whatever
value matches the key
07:19 - in the crocImages object, right?
07:22 - So if they picked 'american',
it should be this URL and
07:26 - if they picked 'saltwater', it
should be this URL, and etc.
07:30 - So the way we can do that is
this reference that object,
07:33 - crocImages, and use bracket notation,
07:37 - and pass in the string which
represents the key in that,
07:40 - it's gonna be used as
the key in that object.
07:43 - So crocSpecies, and
that should give us back
07:47 - the appropriate value in the object.
07:51 - If you want, it might be
easier to think of it this way,
07:53 - crocImages, you know if it was 'american',
07:55 - it's like saying this, right?
07:57 - Or another way of saying that,
08:00 - if we don't use bracket notation, is this.
08:03 - It's all the same, okay?
08:07 - Alright, so we've got this image,
08:09 - but it's floating off
in space, so we need to
08:12 - append it to the page,
and I'll just go ahead
08:15 - and append it to the body.
08:19 - Okay, alright, so once again,
08:22 - our code is theoretically complete,
08:25 - and it's time for you to
do some quality insurance.
08:29 - Pause, (laughs), pause the talk through,
08:32 - order a crocodile, and see what you get,
08:35 - and make sure you order a
few different crocodiles
08:37 - to see that it shows different images.
08:40 - It would be an absolute
tragedy if we accidentally
08:43 - delivered a saltwater crocodile
08:45 - to a user who wanted a freshwater one.
08:48 - Don't wanna make that mistake.
