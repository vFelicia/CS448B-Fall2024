00:01 - - [Voiceover] Let's keep exploring
00:01 - what we can do with objects.
00:04 - We're back with the program that we used
00:05 - in the functions tutorial.
00:07 - This program has this drawWinston function
00:10 - which knows how to draw Winston,
00:12 - and it gets a certain x and y.
00:14 - And then down here, we call
drawWinston four times.
00:17 - Each with a different set
of x and y coordinates.
00:20 - Well, you know me.
00:22 - When I look at those
four drawWinston calls
00:25 - that are so similar looking,
00:27 - all I can think about is
how much better it would be
00:30 - if we could use a loop
00:32 - and just call it one time inside the loop,
00:35 - changing the x and y in
each iteration of the loop.
00:39 - So to do that, we need to find a way
00:41 - to store these x and y
positions in an array
00:45 - so that we can loop through it.
00:47 - Well, with two sets of values,
00:49 - so that we could do is have two arrays:
00:52 - one for x positions,
and one for y positions.
00:55 - So xPositions, we might have 99, 294
00:59 - 101, and 294.
01:01 - And yPositions, we'll have 117, 117,
01:07 - 316, 316.
01:08 - Okay, and now we can loop through those
01:11 - with our 'for' loop, var i equals zero,
01:14 - i less than xPositions.length, i++.
01:18 - So we're going through
each element in xPositions,
01:20 - and we'll say drawWinston,
01:22 - xPositions[i]s,
01:26 - and yPositions[i].
01:30 - Okay.
01:32 - So let's see if that worked by deleting.
01:33 - All right, that worked.
01:35 - So now we can actually just call this,
01:38 - you know, we just have
this one line of code
01:40 - that does drawWinston, but it does it
01:41 - for every position in
the xPositions array.
01:44 - So we could go and add more to this
01:46 - by saying like 10 and then we add 1,
01:49 - and then add 1 and then 1,
01:52 - and then 100 and 1.
01:58 - Now it's getting to
look a little bit messy,
02:01 - and I don't like it because
it's really hard for me
02:04 - to see which x's relate to which y's.
02:08 - And I want it to be
just a look and a glance
02:12 - to know what my x, y pairs are.
02:14 - Instead of having to make sure
02:16 - that I perfectly line them up
02:18 - above each other like this maybe.
02:22 - So I wanna find a different
way of storing these positions.
02:26 - Now one idea is that we can
actually store them as objects
02:30 - because think about it,
each position is really
02:33 - two basic information, the x and the y.
02:35 - So we could have an object
which has x and y properties.
02:39 - And then we could have an array of objects
02:41 - with all these x, y positions.
02:44 - So let's do that.
02:45 - We'll say var positions equals,
02:48 - and this is gonna be an array as well,
02:51 - but each element, instead
of being a number,
02:54 - it's going to be an object.
02:55 - So here we have our curly brackets,
02:58 - and then we're just gonna say x 99,
03:01 - y 117.
03:04 - Okay, so now we have one
of our positions in here,
03:08 - and then we'll go add another one,
03:10 - add another one here.
03:13 - All right, x should be 294, 117.
03:18 - Okay, the third one is
going to be 101, 316.
03:25 - And the final one is 294
03:29 - and 316.
03:31 - Okay, so now we have an array of objects
03:34 - where each object has x
and y properties in it.
03:38 - So down here in our 'for' loop,
03:40 - we'll just change this to
iterate through positions.length,
03:44 - and then we'll pass in the objects.
03:48 - Now, right now, it's
passing the entire object,
03:51 - but we wanna pass the x and the y,
03:53 - so we need positions[i].x
and positions[i].y.
03:59 - Ta-dah!
04:00 - Now we can get rid of
these old clustered arrays.
04:04 - Great!
04:05 - So this looks a lot nicer to me,
04:07 - and makes a code much readable,
04:09 - and anytime we can have more
readable code is better.
04:12 - And it also makes it easier to add,
04:14 - so if I wanna add one,
04:16 - I'll actually add the pair together,
04:18 - and then we can say x 200, y 200,
04:22 - get a little Winston in the middle there.
04:26 - Cool.
04:27 - Now I wanna show you something
even fancier than this.
04:30 - Notice how our function right now accepts
04:34 - two numbers, and then
uses those two numbers.
04:38 - Well, we could change our function
04:40 - so that it expects an object,
04:42 - and then it gets the x
and y from that object.
04:44 - Meaning that down here, we
could just pass the object.
04:49 - Now let's try that.
04:50 - We pass the object, now it's broken.
04:53 - That's because our function
still is expecting two objects,
04:57 - and it's only getting one.
04:58 - So we'll change it to say
it's getting facePosition.
05:01 - And now we get an error
which is faceX is not defined
05:05 - because before, we're passing
in faceX as an argument
05:10 - but now it doesn't exist.
05:11 - We're only getting an
object so what we could do
05:13 - is actually save the x position
05:18 - from the object inside the faceX variable,
05:21 - so we're saying, "Okay,
we got this object.
05:22 - "We know this object has an x property,
05:24 - "so we're just gonna store
that into the faceX variable."
05:27 - And then we could do
the same thing with y,
05:30 - so faceY equals facePosition.y.
05:33 - Ta-dah!
05:34 - And then the rest of the function
that uses faceX and faceY.
05:37 - Now we have to make sure
we spell them correctly.
05:39 - If we did xx, it's not gonna work
05:41 - because that's not what it is down here
05:44 - in our array of objects,
05:46 - so it needs to match.
05:48 - But it's pretty neat because now,
05:50 - you can have arrays of objects,
05:51 - you can have functions
that take in objects,
05:53 - and you'll really find that your programs
05:56 - can be very powerful with the way
05:58 - that they structure their data.
06:00 - And especially since it's so often to want
06:02 - to pair x and y together,
I think you'll find them
06:04 - especially useful in all your drawing
06:07 - and animation programs here.
06:08 - So go to it and have fun.
