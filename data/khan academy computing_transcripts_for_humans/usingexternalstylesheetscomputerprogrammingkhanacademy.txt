00:01 - - [Voiceover] Now I'll
show you one more way
00:03 - to use CSS styles in your page,
00:05 - using something called
'external stylesheets.'
00:09 - Here, I've go this webpage about Hopper
00:12 - And it has a nice header and footer,
00:15 - makes it green and light green.
00:18 - Now what if I wanted to make
another page about Hopper
00:21 - with the same header and footer styles?
00:24 - Like if I wanted an entire
multi page website about Hopper
00:28 - which had those headers
and footers on every page
00:32 - but different content in
the middle of the page.
00:35 - Well, one way I could do that
is by copying and pasting
00:39 - these CSS rules into every
one of the pages that I make.
00:44 - But then when I want to change something
00:47 - about the header or footer,
I'd have to change it
00:49 - in every page, like if I decided the color
00:53 - should be slightly darker, I'd have to
00:55 - make that change for every page I have.
00:59 - I'd be better if I could
just change it in one place.
01:03 - That is the point of an
'external stylesheet.'
01:07 - It's a file of CSS rules
that we can include
01:10 - on multiple pages.
01:13 - So, let me show you how to do this,
01:15 - do you see these top three rules here?
01:19 - I've actually already
gone ahead and moved them
01:21 - into a separate file which
I'm storing online on GitHub,
01:26 - that means I should be
able to replace these
01:29 - with an 'external stylesheet.'
01:32 - I'm just going to comment them out,
01:34 - we loose the styles for now,
01:36 - but we're going to bring them back.
01:38 - Right, to include the stylesheet,
01:41 - I'm going to use the '' tag,
01:44 - which confusingly is
not used for hyperlinks,
01:47 - it's used for bringing in files.
01:50 - Now I add the attribute
'rel' set up '="stylesheet"'
01:55 - next the attribute
'type' set up '=text/css'
02:00 - and finally I need to tell the browser
02:02 - where this CSS stylesheet
is, so add 'href='
02:08 - and paste in the URL.
02:12 - Ta-da, all right, so I got my styles back
02:16 - by including this file,
you are welcome to go
02:18 - and check out this file
to see what it looks like,
02:20 - now that I've done this,
I can paste this link tag
02:23 - into all of my pages about Hopper
02:26 - and it will always reference the same CSS.
02:31 - So on Khan Academy we don't
make it particularly easy
02:34 - to use external stylesheets
in the webpages here,
02:37 - because we don't have
support for you to host
02:39 - stylesheets on our
servers, but once you start
02:43 - developing webpages
outside of Khan Academy
02:46 - in a full featured
editor, you probably want
02:48 - to start using external
stylesheets as soon as you have
02:52 - multiple pages in your website.
02:55 - If you ever see yourself
writing the exact same CSS rule
02:58 - in two places, two pages on your website
03:01 - then remember to ask
yourself, "mmm, should this be
03:05 - "in an external stylesheet instead?"

[Voiceover] Now I'll show you one more way to use CSS styles in your page, using something called 'external stylesheets.' Here, I've go this webpage about Hopper And it has a nice header and footer, makes it green and light green. Now what if I wanted to make another page about Hopper with the same header and footer styles? Like if I wanted an entire multi page website about Hopper which had those headers and footers on every page but different content in the middle of the page. Well, one way I could do that is by copying and pasting these CSS rules into every one of the pages that I make. But then when I want to change something about the header or footer, I'd have to change it in every page, like if I decided the color should be slightly darker, I'd have to make that change for every page I have.

So on Khan Academy we don't make it particularly easy to use external stylesheets in the webpages here, because we don't have support for you to host stylesheets on our servers, but once you start developing webpages outside of Khan Academy in a full featured editor, you probably want to start using external stylesheets as soon as you have multiple pages in your website. If you ever see yourself writing the exact same CSS rule in two places, two pages on your website then remember to ask yourself, "mmm, should this be "in an external stylesheet instead?"
