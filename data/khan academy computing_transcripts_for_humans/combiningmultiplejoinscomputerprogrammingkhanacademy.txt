00:00 - Now I want to show you
a combination of joins and self joins.
00:04 - So, this time I'm back
with multiple tables
00:07 - tracking the students and their projects.
00:10 - Now, since I have students
working on great projects,
00:14 - I want them to review
each other's work in pairs.
00:18 - For example, Hyena Habitats
should review Carpet Physics.
00:23 - That's why I've created
this new table, `project_pairs`.
00:27 - And all it stores is two project IDs
that are paired with each other.
00:33 - Now let's see, what do I see
if I `SELECT * FROM project_pairs`?
00:39 - Ugh, okay, It's just
a bunch of numbers,
00:42 - a bunch of IDs, all the IDs
that are mapped with each other.
00:45 - It is not the most
human readable output at all.
00:49 - What I'd like instead,
is rows of project titles
00:53 - paired with each other.
00:54 - The project titles are in the
`student_projects` table.
00:59 - So that gives me a clue
01:01 - that I need to somehow join
`projectpairs` with `studentprojects`.
01:05 - Let's see what happens if I do that.
01:08 - [TYPING]
01:11 - A-ha, so now we see project IDs
and project titles in each row.
01:16 - What I eventually want,
in the results table,
01:19 - is to see two project titles
in each row, not just one.
01:24 - So that's another clue that we
need to do another join,
01:28 - a self join of `student_projects`
with itself,
01:32 - so that we can get those
same column values twice.
01:36 - Now it may not be obvious how to
add a self join at this point,
01:39 - because we already have a join.
01:41 - If we want to add another one, we can
actually use the join keyword again.
01:46 - So `JOIN student_projects`
and we need to make sure
01:51 - we give them different aliases,
so that they're not ambiguous.
01:55 - So `a` and `b`.
01:57 - All right, so now we've got
a lot of stuff in this results table,
02:01 - but if you'll scroll, you'll see
that the project titles
02:04 - show up twice in each row.
02:07 - So maybe let's make it easier to see,
`a.title, b.title`.
02:13 - Great.
02:14 - But we still have way too many rows,
02:16 - because we're matching every row
with every other row,
02:19 - and we haven't added the `ON` clause,
the very important `ON` clause.
02:23 - So we're actually going to
add two `ON` clauses,
02:26 - one for each of the joins.
02:29 - So, `ON project_pairs.project1.id = a.id`,
02:38 - and then
`ON project_pairs.project2.id = b.id`.
02:47 - A-ha, there we go!
02:49 - So thanks to this combination
of joins and self joins,
02:53 - we can see a nice list of project titles
paired with their project title.
02:59 - Now you can use as many
joins in your query as you need
03:02 - to get the data that you want.
03:04 - But generally, more joins
means slower queries.
03:08 - If you're interested in how to figure out
03:10 - if your queries are slow,
and making them more efficient,
03:13 - we'll talk about that soon.
03:14 - So, stay tuned, and keep at it!
