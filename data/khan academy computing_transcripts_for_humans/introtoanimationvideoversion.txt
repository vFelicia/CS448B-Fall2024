With timestamps:

00:00 - There are lots of ways
to make something look animated,
00:03 - but the basic principle
is always the same.
00:05 - If you take a bunch
of drawings or pictures
00:07 - where each one is just
a little different from the last one,
00:09 - and flip through them fast enough,
00:11 - it'll look like your picture is moving.
00:13 - Back in the good old days,
00:14 - they used to draw
all these pictures by hand
00:16 - and it would take so long just to make
a three-second animation.
00:19 - Luckily for us, we live in the future.
00:22 - It's actually really easy to make
a simple animation with code.
00:26 - And I will show you how!
00:27 - Over on the right, you can see
there is a cute little car
00:30 - on a lovely yellow background.
00:32 - And yes, yes I did design
that car myself, thanks.
00:34 - Anyways, over here
00:35 - you can see we are setting
this beautiful background color.
00:38 - And the car doesn't have any outlines,
so we're calling this noStroke() function.
00:42 - And then here we're making
a new variable, x, the position of the car
00:46 - and giving it a value of 10.
00:47 - And you can see
that if we change this value,
00:49 - then it moves the car back and forth.
00:52 - Bring him up to 10.
00:53 - And then over here we're setting
the fill color of the car
00:55 - and drawing two rectangles
for the car body.
00:58 - So, it looks like this first rectangle
is for the bottom
01:00 - and this rectangle is for the top.
01:02 - And then here we're doing
the same thing with the wheels.
01:05 - We set the fill color
and draw two ellipses:
01:06 - One at "x + 25"
01:08 - and "x + 75".
01:10 - And finally we get to the new stuff.
01:12 - This thing here is called
a function definition.
01:15 - You'll learn all about those later,
01:17 - so for now, kinda just look at it
and memorize what it looks like.
01:20 - The important things to notice are
this word "draw" and these brackets.
01:24 - This opening bracket here
and this closing bracket here.
01:26 - This whole thing is what we call
the draw loop, or the animation loop.
01:30 - And everything that you put
inside these brackets
01:32 - gets run over and over again
really, really fast.
01:35 - That's why it's called a loop.
01:36 - And then everything outside these brackets
01:38 - gets run only once
at the very beginning of the program.
01:41 - So the first step in animating is to move
all your drawing code into the brackets
01:45 - so that your picture
will get drawn over and over.
01:47 - So let's do that.
01:48 - I'm just going to pull
all this drawing code
01:51 - and then plop it down inside my loop.
01:54 - And to remind myself that this
block of code goes inside these brackets,
01:58 - I'm just going to indent it all
by selecting everything and pressing Tab.
02:02 - And now I know that this code
is inside the brackets.
02:05 - So as you can tell,
everything just looks totally the same;
02:08 - nothing has changed.
02:10 - Because the first time
we run this draw loop,
02:12 - the computer's going to go,
02:13 - "Okay, make a new variable x,
set it to 10, draw two rectangles,
02:16 - draw two ellipses."
02:17 - And then it's going to go
all the way back to the top and say,
02:20 - "Make a new variable x, set it to 10,
draw two rectangles, draw two ellipses."
02:24 - And then, "Make a new variable x,
set it to 10, draw two rec--"
02:26 - same exact thing.
02:28 - Nothing has changed, so duh,
you're not going to see any animation.
02:31 - It's just drawing the same rectangles
and ellipses on top of the old ones.
02:34 - Remember what we said: if we want
to make something look animated,
02:37 - you need to change your drawing
a little bit at a time.
02:40 - So if I want my car to move forward,
02:42 - I should change the value
of this x variable, right?
02:45 - So yeah, let's just make it...11.
02:48 - Ah!! No!! But now it's just going
to be 11 every single time.
02:51 - How the heck am I supposed to get
the value of x to keep changing
02:54 - when the computer just runs
the same code over and over?
02:57 - Okay, watch this magic trick.
02:59 - Remember, this var x
makes a new variable.
03:02 - When we have it inside
the draw loop like this,
03:04 - it makes a new variable
called "x" every single time.
03:07 - What we need to do is make
this variable outside the draw loop.
03:10 - That way it will only make it once.
03:13 - And then, every time the computer
runs this code and sees the variable x,
03:17 - it'll reuse the same variable from before
using the last value we assigned to it.
03:22 - So I'm just gonna do that;
I'm gonna take this variable
03:25 - and we're gonna make it
outside of the draw loop.
03:27 - So right now it's only making
that variable once.
03:31 - And every time it runs into
this variable x
03:33 - it's gonna reuse the same variable.
03:35 - And right now the last value
we assigned to it was 11,
03:38 - so it's always gonna be 11.
03:39 - And here's where the magic comes in.
03:41 - Somewhere in the draw loop,
we're gonna change the value of x
03:44 - to be a little more
than it used to be, like this:
03:46 - x gets the old value of x
plus, let's say, 1.
03:52 - Yay! It works!
03:54 - Except, it's so smeary.
03:56 - And if you're wondering
why it looks that way,
03:59 - it's because we forgot to draw
this background inside the draw loop.
04:02 - So it's drawing the car
over and over again,
04:04 - but you can see all the old cars
underneath the new one.
04:07 - So if I just pull this line
into the top of the draw loop, like that,
04:12 - and then press "Restart"
so I can see my car again...
04:15 - Yay! It's so perfect!
04:18 - And if we wanna make the car go faster,
04:19 - we can just change how much
we increase x by every time.
04:22 - So if we make it 10, whoo!
It's off the screen!
04:24 - And I can even make it negative,
so x - 10 and...
04:28 - Here it comes!
04:30 - Make it positive again,
whoops...
04:33 - There it goes.
04:34 - So here are the important things
to remember:
04:36 - This thing right here
is called the draw loop.
04:39 - You should put
your drawing code inside here
04:41 - so it'll get drawn over and over again.
04:43 - And then, you wanna make
a variable outside your draw loop.
04:46 - It's super important to make
the variable outside the draw loop
04:49 - so we can reuse the same one every time.
04:51 - Then inside the draw loop right here,
04:53 - we're gonna change
the variable a little bit,
04:56 - usually by setting it to its old value,
04:58 - plus some number--
plus or minus some number.
05:01 - And finally, you wanna use your variable
somewhere in your drawing code
05:05 - so that your drawing
looks different every time.
05:07 - And... that's it!
