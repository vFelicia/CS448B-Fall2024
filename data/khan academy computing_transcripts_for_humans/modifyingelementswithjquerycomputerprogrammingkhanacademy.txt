00:00 - - [Voiceover] Welcome back.
00:02 - Now we did a bit of DOM
manipulation in the last tutorial,
00:05 - where we just changed the
inner text of elements.
00:08 - There is a lot more that you can change
00:10 - using jQuery, however.
00:12 - Really, really you can change anything.
00:15 - So, I'm going to show you some more
00:17 - ways to change here.
00:19 - Starting with this webpage about cats.
00:23 - Cats are great, cats are
adorable. I love cats.
00:27 - But, I have a recurring
dream where crocodiles
00:31 - eat me and my cats and
take over the world.
00:35 - So let's use jQuery to play out
00:37 - that nightmare on this webpage.
00:41 - All right, so let's go
down to the JavaScript
00:45 - and start by changing all
of the headings on the page,
00:48 - like we did before.
00:50 - So we'll say "crocodile attack!".
00:56 - All right. Now let's write some HTML
01:00 - in all of the paragraph tags.
01:03 - Say "the crocodiles are
coming". "Oh noess".
01:13 - Ooh. Oh no. So it's
showing the '' tags
01:17 - to me, the user, but I
want it to render those
01:19 - like '' tags. And
the reason it's doing that
01:22 - is because I used the 'text method',
01:25 - which just interprets everything as text.
01:27 - So if we want to 'pass' an HTML tags,
01:29 - we have to use the HTML
method. There we go.
01:33 - Now we get that "oh noess" across.
01:37 - All right. Now, we can make the page
01:40 - look a bit more crocodillian, if we change
01:43 - the paragraph text color to green.
01:47 - And the way we can do
that, selecting all those
01:49 - paragraphs again and then
calling the 'css method'.
01:54 - And the 'css method'
expects two parameters.
01:58 - The first 1 will be the
'css property name', color.
02:02 - And the next 1 will be the
'property value', green.
02:06 - There we go.
02:08 - We could also be a bit fancier
02:10 - and instead of changing
just one 'css property',
02:13 - we could add a whole 'class name'.
02:16 - So let's try that for
our headings. So, "h2".
02:19 - ".addClass" and we
'pass' it a 'class name',
02:25 - which I'll just make
up. Call it "crocodile".
02:29 - All right so nothing has happened
02:31 - and that's because I
don't have a 'css rule'
02:33 - for crocodile class, yet.
02:36 - But, I can easily go up and add it.
02:38 - So '' ".crocodile"
and "color: green"
02:44 - and then while I'm up here
let's make a new font.
02:48 - Fantasy. Yeah look at
that. That is looking good.
02:53 - All right. So generally
it's better to add a 'class'
02:57 - than change an individual property,
03:00 - because then you can keep adding
lots and lots of properties
03:02 - up here, keep all your styles in 1 place,
03:06 - and not clutter up your
JavaScript with adding
03:09 - all sorts of 'css properties'.
03:12 - But, there might be times
when, for whatever reason,
03:14 - you can't add a 'class name',
03:16 - and in that case you can
use that 'css method'.
03:20 - Okay, so our page is getting there.
03:23 - Let's see what else we have.
03:24 - We have links on the page. Those links
03:26 - go off to webpages about cats.
03:29 - Of course we want those
to go off to a wepage
03:31 - about crocodiles instead.
03:33 - So let's select all of the links
03:36 - and this time we're going to use ".attr",
03:39 - which stands for attribute.
And with this method
03:43 - we need to 'pass' it two parameters.
03:46 - The first is the name of the attribute
03:47 - we're going to change. So we're
going to change the "href".
03:51 - And the second, is the 'value'.
03:54 - So for that I'm going to take this URL
03:57 - and then type "crocodile"
and that should point
04:01 - to a page about crocodiles.
04:04 - It's always good to find
out more information
04:06 - about the species that is attacking you.
04:09 - All right. And there's one
more thing on the page.
04:12 - You can probably see
what I'm talking about,
04:14 - There is a cat on my page,
there's two cats on my page.
04:17 - The images. So let's go
and select those images,
04:21 - and use ".attr" again to change the "src",
04:26 - the source of the images.
04:28 - And I will set it equal to...this URL,
04:36 - plus "crocodiles.png" and there we go.
04:41 - The crocodiles that are attacking us.
04:44 - They've taken over the entire page.
04:46 - It's frightening isn't it? (laughing)
04:49 - Well don't worry you can also use jQuery
04:51 - to change your page into happy things,
04:54 - like unicorns and
ponies, and you'll get to
04:57 - try that out in the next challenge.
