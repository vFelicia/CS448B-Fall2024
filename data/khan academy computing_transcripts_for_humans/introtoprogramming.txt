00:00 - Welcome to our programming
tutorials on Khan Academy.
00:03 - Are you completely new
to computer programming?
00:06 - Well, don't worry.
00:07 - That means that you're
like 99.5% of the world.
00:11 - And we're here to help.
00:12 - I bet you're wondering what
programming actually is.
00:15 - When we write a program,
we're giving the computer
00:17 - a series of commands
that kind of look
00:20 - like a weird form of English.
00:22 - You can just think of a computer
as a really obedient dog,
00:25 - listening to your
commands and doing
00:27 - whatever you tell it to do,
00:31 - Thankfully, programming
isn't this obscure skill
00:33 - that only special people can do.
00:35 - It's something that
we can all learn.
00:37 - Kids, teens, adults
from all over the world
00:40 - are learning programming today.
00:42 - What's so cool
about programming?
00:44 - Why are all those
people learning it?
00:46 - Well, it really depends
on what you think is cool.
00:50 - Because, as it turns out,
you can use programming
00:53 - for almost everything.
00:55 - Today, people write
programs to do everything
00:57 - from helping doctors and
patients cure diseases,
01:01 - helping save endangered
species all over the world,
01:04 - making self-driving
cars so that you never
01:06 - have to worry about learning
to drive when you get older,
01:10 - creating algorithmic jewelry,
designing robots that
01:13 - can take care of
patients or robots
01:15 - that can roam around Mars and
look for water on the surface.
01:18 - Making really fun
games like Doodle Jump,
01:21 - Draw Something, Angry Birds,
any game that you've played.
01:25 - Making movies like all the
awesome 3D movies from Pixar
01:28 - like Avatar, or making
computer graphics
01:31 - to go inside live action
movies like Gollum
01:34 - in Lord of the Rings.
01:35 - Making the websites
and apps that you
01:37 - use every day, all the time,
like Facebook and Google Maps
01:40 - and Wikipedia and
YouTube and Pinterest.
01:43 - And of course, educating
the world on websites
01:46 - like Khan Academy,
where you are now.
01:48 - So right now, on
Khan Academy, you
01:50 - can learn to make your own art
and games, which will give you
01:52 - a great start towards creating
whatever you can imagine.
01:56 - It might be hard to see how
a drawing program relates
01:58 - to making websites, programming
phones, or curing diseases.
02:01 - But believe it or not,
the same basic concepts
02:04 - are used by pretty
much every programmer
02:06 - in almost every program.
02:08 - That means that once you
learn to code on Khan Academy,
02:11 - you'll be able to learn
other sorts of coding way
02:13 - more easily.
02:14 - You've take the
important first step
02:16 - by coming here and
watching this video.
02:19 - So let's get started with
your very first program.
02:21 - See you there.

Welcome to our programming tutorials on Khan Academy. Are you completely new to computer programming? Well, don't worry. That means that you're like 99.5% of the world. And we're here to help. I bet you're wondering what programming actually is. When we write a program, we're giving the computer a series of commands that kind of look like a weird form of English. You can just think of a computer as a really obedient dog, listening to your commands and doing whatever you tell it to do, Thankfully, programming isn't this obscure skill that only special people can do.
