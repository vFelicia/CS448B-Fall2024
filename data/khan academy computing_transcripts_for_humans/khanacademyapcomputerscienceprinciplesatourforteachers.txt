00:00 - - Hello, I'm Pamela, and I created
00:03 - the AP Computer Science
Principles course on Khan Academy.
00:07 - Our AP CSP content is
broken up into five units,
00:11 - computers, the internet, programming,
00:14 - algorithms, and data analysis.
00:17 - Each unit is full of exercise questions,
00:20 - with over 600 questions total.
00:23 - I've also written instructional
articles for each topic
00:26 - and embedded the fantastic
videos from code.org.
00:31 - The articles are illustrated
00:32 - with diagrams demonstrating the concepts
00:34 - to help visual learners, like myself.
00:37 - They often include inline questions
00:40 - to help students check their understanding
00:41 - before they get to the exercise.
00:44 - The exercise questions are inspired
00:46 - by the questions on the
AP CSP practice exams.
00:49 - And the majority are multiple choice.
00:52 - The exercise questions
in the programming unit
00:54 - are all written in the
pseudo-code of the AP CSP exam.
00:59 - CSP students program in a variety
01:01 - of languages in the classroom.
01:02 - So our questions give
students an opportunity
01:05 - to translate their programming skills
01:07 - into the exam pseudo-code.
01:09 - Khan Academy believes in
mastery-based learning.
01:13 - We give students the option
01:14 - to practice a skill multiple times
01:16 - to demonstrate their mastery
01:18 - and help them to discover
their weak points.
01:21 - Each exercise set has
12 practice questions.
01:24 - And students attempt
four questions at a time.
01:27 - If they struggle on a
question the first time,
01:29 - we encourage them to review
the article or the hints.
01:33 - After they complete the set of four,
01:35 - they'll see how they did.
01:36 - They can then practice again,
01:38 - especially if they missed
a question the first time.
01:41 - They'll then see another set
01:42 - of questions similar to the first four,
01:45 - including one similar
to the one they missed.
01:49 - Each unit has quizzes and a unit test.
01:52 - Students can attempt them
01:53 - when they feel comfortable
with the material covered.
01:56 - And the system will identify any topics
01:58 - where they need to practice more.
02:00 - Khan Academy also provides
02:02 - a great set of teacher tools
for those of you who want
02:04 - to assign content and track progress.
02:07 - To get started using the tools,
02:09 - create a class on Khan Academy,
02:11 - choose AP CSP as the course for the class,
02:14 - and then add your students.
02:16 - You can then preview all
the content for the course,
02:19 - including the AP CSP standards
that are mapped to each item.
02:22 - You can even preview each exercise
02:24 - to see what the questions look like.
02:27 - You can assign articles,
videos, exercises,
02:30 - or entire lessons and units.
02:33 - Then you can monitor
your students' progress
02:35 - in the Assignments,
Progress, and Activity tabs.
02:39 - So that was a quick tour
of our AP CSP content.
02:43 - Thank you for teaching AP CSP
02:45 - and helping to bring more people
02:47 - into the world of computer science.

Hello, I'm Pamela, and I created the AP Computer Science Principles course on Khan Academy. Our AP CSP content is broken up into five units, computers, the internet, programming, algorithms, and data analysis. Each unit is full of exercise questions, with over 600 questions total. I've also written instructional articles for each topic and embedded the fantastic videos from code.org. The articles are illustrated with diagrams demonstrating the concepts to help visual learners, like myself. They often include inline questions to help students check their understanding before they get to the exercise. The exercise questions are inspired by the questions on the AP CSP practice exams. And the majority are multiple choice. The exercise questions in the programming unit are all written in the pseudocode of the AP CSP exam. CSP students program in a variety of languages in the classroom. So our questions give students an opportunity to translate their programming skills into the exam pseudocode. Khan Academy believes in masterybased learning. We give students the option to practice a skill multiple times to demonstrate their mastery and help them to discover their weak points. Each exercise set has 12 practice questions. And students attempt four questions at a time. If they struggle on a question the first time, we encourage them to review the article or the hints.
