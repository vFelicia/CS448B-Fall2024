pronounce SQL two ways--

is the correct one.

00:19 - Well, SQL was originally invented
at IBM in the early 1970s.
00:25 - And the first version
was called SEQUEL,
00:29 - and it stood for
Structured English QUEry Language.
00:33 - That acronym, SEQUEL,
was later changed to SQL,
00:38 - because SEQUEL was already
trademarked by an airplane company,

getting into trademark lawsuits.
00:46 - Nowadays, many of us still
pronounce it sequel,
00:49 - because it's shorter to say,
00:51 - and we've got historical reasons
to claim that it's the right way.
00:55 - However, when I surveyed
developers across the world,
00:59 - I found that in non-English languages,
many of them pronounce it S-Q-L,
01:04 - or, for example,
ese cu ele in Spanish.
01:09 - Since our videos get translated
here on Khan Academy,
01:12 - I figured I'd make it easier

the pace of our videos,
01:16 - by pronouncing SQL the long way.
01:20 - But in everyday life,
I'm used to calling it sequel,
01:24 - so both of them come out of me.
01:27 - Now you know,
it can be S-Q-L or sequel,
01:30 - and you'll probably hear both
the rest of your life.
01:33 - The world is a messy place,
