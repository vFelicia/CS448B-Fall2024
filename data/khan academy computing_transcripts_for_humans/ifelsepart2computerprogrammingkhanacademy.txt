00:01 - Here's where we left off with our coin-flipping game.
00:03 - We started out by generating a random number between 0 and 1,
00:06 - and then rounding that number to the nearest integer.
00:08 - So this gave us a number that was either 0 or 1.
00:12 - And then we illustrated our super-realistic coin with this ellipse that was either purple or yellow, depending on what the number was.
00:18 - And here's the code where we did that.
00:20 - So we said if integer is equal to 0 set the fill code to be purple, otherwise, set it to yellow.
00:25 - And then we draw the coin down here.
00:27 - But now I've decided that actually my coin has 3 sides. Yep, a 3-sided coin.
00:32 - So let's add that third side.
00:34 - I'm going to start by making a number between 0 and 2,
00:37 - so after we round that, it will give me an integer that's either 0, 1, or 2.
00:41 - But if we look at our drawing code, we're only accounting for 2 cases here.
00:45 - So if integer is 0, make it purple, otherwise, make it yellow.
00:48 - But now, otherwise can mean either 1 or 2.
00:51 - But wait, what if I did the same thing that we did before,
00:54 - but inside this else block. So I'm just going to say:
00:57 - if integer is equal to 1 then set the fill color to be yellow, like it was before,
01:04 - else, we will set the fill color to be red. Red's pretty good.
01:11 - So what this means is, if integer is equal to 0, set the color to be purple,
01:15 - otherwise,if it's 1, we will make it yellow;
01:18 - otherwise, that is, if it wasn't 0, it wasn't 1, it must be 2, we'll make the color red.
01:24 - I press restart a bunch of times. It works! Woohoo!
01:28 - So then if I wanted to add more sides to my coin,
01:31 - I can go up here, make it 0 to 3, and then go deeper into this else block and add more if-else's and so on and so forth,
01:37 - until I have a bazillion nested blocks.
01:40 - And only then will I realize that this code is disgusting! I mean gross!
01:44 - Code is supposed to be easy to read and pretty, not as ugly as possible.
01:48 - So here's what we're going to do:
01:50 - Whenever you have just a single if statement or an if-else statement inside an else block,
01:55 - so that means we're not doing anything else outside of these blocks,
01:58 - we're not setting the stroke color, we don't have anymore if statements, nothing.
02:04 - All we have is that one if statement, and maybe it comes with an else block.
02:08 - Then we can actually combine this condition with the line before and say:
02:13 - else if integer is equal to 1, then set the fill color to yellow.
02:17 - And then this last else block isn't nested anywhere, just comes at the very end all by itself.
02:21 - Great! So now what this means is, if integer is equal to 0, set the color to purple,
02:27 - otherwise if integer is equal to 1, set it to yellow,
02:30 - otherwise, so if both of these were false, then set it to red.
02:34 - I press restart a bunch of times, you can see it still works.
02:37 - Great! And the cool thing about this is, we can have as many else-if's as we want,
02:41 - which makes it really easy for me to add more sides to my coin.
02:44 - So let's do that now. I'm going to make a number between 0 and 3,
02:48 - and then just add one more else block that says else if integer is equal to 2
02:56 - we'll set the fill color to ... well it's red before so we can keep it red.
02:59 - And then this last else block will be for when an integer is equal to 3,
03:02 - it will make it blue. Great!
03:08 - All right. So in order to do this, you always have to start with an if statement,
03:12 - and then you can have as many else-if's as you want,
03:16 - and then this last guy is optional.
03:18 - We can actually do without it, and then it's possible that all of these will be false,
03:21 - so none of these blocks gets executed.
03:23 - But as long as we have that there, then exactly one of these blocks will be run.
03:30 - Cool? Now this is a case where it doesn't really matter if you say if else-if else-if else,
03:37 - or just use plain old if statements like we had in the beginning, so if integer is equal to 3.
03:45 - And that's because it's never possible for integer to equal 0, and then also 1, 2, or 3.
03:50 - Great. So these conditions are all mutually exclusive.
03:54 - Only one of these blocks will ever get run anyway.
03:56 - But that's not always the case.
03:58 - What if we try to make a game like this without rounding to an integer?
04:01 - So I'm going to get rid of this part where we round it,
04:04 - and the other part where we draw it to the screen.
04:06 - And let's make up some new rules to my game.
04:09 - So I'm still generating a number between 0 and 3,
04:12 - put some more tick marks on our number line.
04:15 - So let's say that if the number falls between 0 and 1 we will make it purple.
04:23 - Oh, that doesn't look like a 'p' at all. You get the idea. OK.
04:26 - And then if it's between 1 and 2, we can make it yellow.
04:30 - And if it's between 2 and 3, we will make it red.
04:35 - Great. So let's see how we can do that with if and else-if's.
04:38 - So I can start out by saying if number is less than 1,
04:43 - so if it's less than 1, and I know it's between 0 and 3, then it must be in this range,
04:51 - then I'll set the fill color to be purple.
04:54 - Otherwise, if the number is less than 2, I can set the fill color to be yellow. . . . 255 . . .
05:06 - And otherwise, I'll set the fill to be red.
05:13 - Great! And it works just as intended.
05:15 - So if the number was less than 1, then again, it's in this range.
05:19 - Otherwise, it's greater than or equal to 1, but it's also less than 2,
05:23 - so that puts it in this range, so we're going to set the color to yellow.
05:26 - Otherwise, it must be greater than or equal to 2, so it's going to fall in that range.
05:31 - And here's a case where we couldn't just say if number is less than 2,
05:36 - and if number is less than 3,
05:39 - because if number is less than 1, then it's definitely is less than 2
05:42 - and it's also going to be less than 3.
05:44 - So our coin is always going to end up red.
05:46 - And that's why in this case, it's really helpful to have else-if.
