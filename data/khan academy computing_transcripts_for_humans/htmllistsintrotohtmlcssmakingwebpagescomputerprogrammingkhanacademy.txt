00:00 - - [Voiceover] You know what I love?
00:01 - Lists.
00:02 - Have you ever made a
to-do, or shopping list?
00:05 - Have you ever read a
list on a webpage like,
00:06 - top ten most rediculous dog faces?
00:10 - I bet you have, because
the world is full of lists.
00:13 - HTML, gives us a few tags to make lists.
00:16 - We're going to practice them
by making a list of reasons
00:20 - why rabbits make great pets.
00:24 - Now, to begin a bulleted list,
00:26 - we must start with the ul tag.
00:30 - What does ul stand for?
00:32 - Well, I bet you can guess
what the l stands for, list.
00:35 - The u is a little trickier.
00:37 - It stands for unordered.
00:39 - It means that the browser
won't number the list items.
00:42 - It will just add little bullets.
00:45 - see what I mean?
00:45 - Let's add the first item.
00:48 - They're furry.
00:50 - See the little circle on the side?
00:52 - That's a bullet.
00:53 - Now, what do you suppose li stands for?
00:56 - The l is list, and the i is item.
00:58 - List item.
00:59 - Everytime we want to add a new item,
01:01 - we need to add a new li under the ul.
01:05 - Every ul should have at
least one li under it,
01:08 - because a list with no
items is pretty boring.
01:11 - Let's add some more, so great listeners,
01:15 - and eat all your leftover carrots.
01:21 - This should be a pretty convincing list.
01:24 - I don't know who wouldn't want
a rabbit after reading this.
01:28 - I didn't number this list,
because I don't think that one
01:31 - reason is more important than the other,
01:33 - but there are a lot of time
when we do want numbered lists.
01:36 - Like, if we wanted to make a top three
01:39 - most famous rabbits list.
01:44 - To start our numbered list,
we're going to use an ol,
01:49 - instead of a ul.
01:51 - Have you figured out what ol stands for?
01:54 - Here's a hint, just chop the
first two letters off of what
01:57 - ul stood for.
01:59 - That's right, it stands for ordered list.
02:02 - It tells the browser to
automatically number each new item.
02:06 - We still use li for adding new items
02:09 - inside the list however.
02:11 - So, we have Bugs Bunny,
and we've got Thumper,
02:15 - and of course, can't
forget the Easter Bunny.
02:19 - Okay, the neat thing about
a numbered list is that the
02:22 - browser takes care of
the numbering for us.
02:24 - So, if we rearrange items,
delete, add new ones,
02:27 - it always updates the numbers correctly.
02:30 - Like, if all of you tell me
you don't know who Thumper is,
02:33 - then, first, I'll tell you all
02:35 - that you should really go watch Bambi.
02:37 - Then, I will begrudgingly move
Thumper down to the bottom.
02:41 - Now, poor Thumper is number three.
02:44 - Now, you have everything
you need to make lists.
02:47 - Go forth, and list everything.
