hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and this is another video tutorial for the new Boston now in this tutorial we're going to be lightly touching on the remote address functionality of our set our predefined server or environmental information now you probably always wondered how websites you know grab your IP address and it's simpler than you might think now in this example this will grab an IP address but it won't be reliable so it's not a reliable way to grab an IP address so you should definitely not depend on using this method to grab your users I did I P for example you could have a block list of website of IP addresses that you want to block from your website and in this video we're going to show you how to do this using this method but I do have another tutorial on how to grab the users IP in a more reliable correct way so I've got this file called Kampf delink dot PHP and that's going to take contain the dynamic a dynamic variable that's going to be updated based on the user's IP address so the first thing we're going to do is create that echo out an index dot PHP we're going to preview it in our browser and then we're going to learn how we could block this IP address so I'm going to block myself from the website okay so let's um start by creating a variable and I'm just going to call this IP address and I'm going to make that equal to e using the same syntax as dollar underscore server now inside here we need to type remote underscore and it's not address like this but it's a shortened version of address I'll be ad a DD yeah like that so addr so we have this remote address in here which is now corresponding to this variable here and we can echo that out on PHP index dot PHP so the first thing we're going to do in capitals so we're going to require our comp Inc dot PHP if you haven't already looked at what require or include do take a look back and you find another tutorial on that as well so we've required our file let's just refresh our page to make sure everything is working yet everything seems to be working now what we can do is echo out that variable that we've defined in here so that's IP underscore address it's IP address and let's refresh the page okay so at the moment because I'm running on a local server you can see that I'm using localhost up here the IP address is oneone 27.0 dot zero dot one which is a local IP address for every machine so now how do we go about blocking me from this well it's absolutely simple let's go into comp and create an array of IP addresses that we want to block so IP blocked equals array we're going to create an some IP addresses that are blocks site 127 dot dot dot 1 and let's just make up one so we'll say 100 100 100 100 so it's a load of rubbish but this is the one here that we are going to use it as the example we're going to search through this whole array though so now what we can do is in the in this sum in this comp file as well is we could include this in here or our index dot PHP it doesn't matter whatsoever let's do it in index so expand eater so the first thing we want to do is we want to produce some content down here so I'm going to create a header saying welcome okay now this is displayed currently because we haven't created a function to block out our block our IP however up here what I'm going to do is I'm going to start a for each loop and then I'm going to create my block and then so what we're going to do inside this for each as construct is that we're going to check we're going to take each element of this array and check the current IP address against each one and then if it does happen to be blocked we're just going to kill the page so we're going to use the die or the exit function to kill the page so for each and by the way they should come up the top of your script if you are actually going to use this but like I said before this is an unreliable way to grab an IP address so for each let's go back to our variables IP underscore blocked so for each IP blocked as IP so this is each IP so as we run each loop of this IP will correspond firstly to one two seven zero one and then 100 and then 100 blah blah blah so let's just echo these out so we know that it's working we'll put a break there and will echo out IP so let's just refresh the page and see what happens so we record out both mi peers so now it's logical that we can come inside here and say if I P is equal to IP address this this is the current IP address of the user then die okay and then inside here we can write a message so let's just test it for now we refresh you can see that nothing comes up that's because we've killed the page at this point and that's it we're not displaying this header we've killed everything after this point so let's come in here and get rid of this and see if that makes a difference which it will do so we can refresh and you see that we're allowed access to the page so now let's create a sort of message to the user to let them know that the right piece been blocked so your IP address and then we depend on Y piece that's the current IP that's been found and blocked over now we can do I P address like that so IP has been blocked okay so now let's refresh your IP address 127 but not done order 1 has been blocked so that's a simple way to grab the IP address of the user and then perform a couple of checks I mean I've just done this in it as an example just a bit of a use out of this this variable here but this isn't obviously like I said the greatest way to grab the user's IP address but there will be a video while there is a video on that in this series that allows you to grab the actual IP address of the user
