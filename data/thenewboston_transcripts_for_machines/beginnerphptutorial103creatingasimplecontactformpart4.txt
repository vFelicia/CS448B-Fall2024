we don't have a max length for name nor do we have a max length for email address or message so you you're going to need to leave use the STR Len function to see what size these values are at you could say set a message size of a thousand so no more than a thousand or two thousand characters email address that say no more than 50 characters and name might say no more than 30 characters or 25 a push so you can go inside your code and you can use an if statement to check the length or each thing in fact we may as well do that now so let's say inside here if we wanted to check the string length let's go ahead and after we've checked for empty I'm going to say if STR Len of contact name is greater than so we serve out 25 for that then we want to return an error so if STR line of contact name is greater than 25 we can we can put these all in in the same in the same string for now just to save a bit of time in the same condition I mean to save a bit of time so if the string length of content name is greater than 25 or the string length of contact email is greater than 50 or string length of contact text is greater than 1000 for example then we want to echo out an error now I would indent the rest of my code because what we're going to do is we're going to say else and then run the rest of this code here if we don't receive an error let's just work out where to put this we've got and if here if here so that is going to go over all fields are required that is going to go in here so I would indent all of this code here but this unfortunately this text editor that I'm using on cPanel at the moment forbids me to indent code quickly so I'm just going to keep it messy for now but always remember to properly and end your code okay so echo and we want to say sorry max length for each field exceeded got for some field has been exceeded now why are we giving such a general and error message let's just go ahead and test this out beforehand Oh sort of swapping tabs around there okay so let's type loads and loads of characters into here and loads and loads and loads of characters into here and then we'll just say hi in the error mess in the message sorry click send sorry maximum for some field has been exceeded okay so now what we want to do is inside our HTML is we want to set max lengths on depending on what we've done here so we've got 25 for name 50 for email and a thousand for our text area so let's go ahead and do this for name max length equals 25 contact email max length equals 50 and for the text area max oops sorry max length equals 1000 so now what we're doing is we're forbidding on the HTML for a user to enter anything more than the characters we've specified so if you watch me just randomly type stuff in here I stopped I'm still typing and it's not working so the only way that we're ever going to produce this error message that we've defined in here is if the user somehow tries to cheat this and remove these max lengths by storing the file and submitting the data from their local computer by saving the HTML farm resubmitting it or from a server but either way so we've created that error message just for a bit of security so we don't get a lot of sort of mail through with a long character longer string lengths in there the other thing to bear in mind is that you might want to add a capture a capture how to set a capture form or a security validation image however you want to describe it and the reason for this is you have bots that will go around and they will pick up on things like this and they will send you junk so there is a tutorial on the New Boston channel that I've created with the GD image library and that allows you to create a a capture image if you like or a security image so go and have a look at this but that's just a few security warnings about this code as it is it will allow bots to submit it because we don't have any calibration characters that we can type in okay so that's basically a contact form in PHP sorry that we've you've been using a horrible text editor and we haven't been able to indent properly but I do recommend you always indent and take into account security issues that I've also spoken about on this video as well
