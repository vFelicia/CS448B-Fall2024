welcome to edition with whole numbers a whole number is just a fancy word for numbers without fractions or decimals so right here we have the ones place we have the tens place the hundreds and the thousands it's important to keep the ones in the ones place when they're stacked on top of each other so we're adding big numbers like this we start in the ones place you add 8 plus 9 so 9 + 8 equals 17 you carry over the 1 bring down the 7 5 + 6 is 11 plus 1 is 12 carry over the 1 bring down the 2 7 6 is 13 plus 1 is 14 and 4 plus 2 is 6 plus 1 is 7 so there's your product 7420 7 same deal over here we start in the ones place 5 + 9 is 14 carry the 1 bring down the 4 9 + 1 is 10 plus 3 is 13 9 + 1 is 10 + 4 is 14 carry the 1 bring down the 4 2 + 2 is 4 so get 4,000 434 alright 9 + 1 is 10 care of the 1 bring down the zero as a placeholder 2 + 8 is 10 plus 1 is 11 9 + 1 is 10 + 7 is 17 care of the 1 bring down the 7 you want to make sure they keep it right underneath so 3 + 1 is 4 plus 1 is 5 5710 over here we got 6 + 6 is 12 carry the 1 again bring down the 2 + 9 + 1 10 + 7 is 17 carry the 1 bring down the 7 8 9 10 plus 1 is 11 5 6 7 & 7 is your last number so 7170 2 over here we have 9 + 8 which is 17 carry the 1 bring down the 7 4 + 4 is 8 + it's nine you just bring down the nine since it's a singledigit number four nine four and five is nine bring down the nine again no need to carry over a number and 6 plus 2 is 8 we need a good at place holding you can just do it vertically or horizontally we have 7 and 9 is 16 you want to put the 6 way over in the right end make sure you have enough room to write your rest of your numbers carry over the 1 5 + 4 is 9 plus 1 is 10 placeholder 0 carry over the 1 6 7 8 plus 1 is 9 and 7 plus 1 is 8 that's 8900 6 over here we have 9 + 5 is 14 carry the 1 6 + 4 is 10 plus 1 is 11 carry the 1 over 6 and 4 is also 10 plus 1 is 11 and then 5 + 3 + 1 is 9 so we have 3 + 3 is 6 bring it way over here only singledigit numbers so no need to carry over the 1 5 & 6 11 put down the 1 there care over the 1 9 + 2 as 11 plus 1 is 12 carry the 1 7 8 9 and that's all we have for addition with whole numbers
