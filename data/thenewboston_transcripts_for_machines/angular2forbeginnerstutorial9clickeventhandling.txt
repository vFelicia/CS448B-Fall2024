alright so in the last video what we did is we set up our component to display all of these videos but now what I want to do is this I want to have it so whenever the user clicks one of these rows that the video appears at the bottom right here so the first thing we have to figure out is how do we just listen for click events and the way that you do that is this so we want to listen for click events on the row so it doesn't matter what commonly click we just want to listen for it anywhere on the row wherever they click so on this row tag right here what we're going to do is this in between parentheses go ahead and right click so set this equal to some attribute and this is how in angler you can listen for click events or any events so whenever a click occurs on this row then it's going to trigger whatever we type in here which is going to be some method now we don't have any here let me close out of all this extra crap so in our class we don't have any methods created yet but we will in just a second and we can name this anything we want I'm just going to name this on select so whenever we call this method we actually want to pass in this video so that way it knows exactly what video to display and again remember whenever we're looping through these videos each individual video is referenced as V so there you go so again whenever you want to listen for click events just right click equals and then set it equal to some method so now in here we can actually go ahead and make that method but check this out we actually need to import this video class right here so I'm just going to set it up to display the video and before you even do that before I actually output the actual HTML code I'm just going to display some basic information just to test things maybe the title or something so anyways whenever we're using this video class we need to import video from video all right so what did I name that on select alright so on select what we're going to do is this we need to make a variable and I'll just name it a I might as well just keep it V actually let me name it bin so you guys can see that it's actually different and of course whenever you're working in typescript you need to write what data type it is so this of course is just the type of video so there you go and for this tutorial like I said eventually what we're going to be doing is we're going to be displaying the HTML code but for now just so we can keep things real simple and make sure that this click event actually works is I'm just going to print something out to the console so console.log and jason stringify that vid so all this does is it takes whatever object this is turns into a JSON string and it just prints it out in the console so this should work hopefully now we for this to refresh and check it out and by the way whenever it prints it out to the console I'm not talking about this console right here I'm talking about the console in Chrome so if you want to open that then you can either just open up your developer tools or a shortcut if you're using Windows is ctrl shift and J so it'll pop open your console so now let me just go ahead and click this row and check it out all of the JSON information prints out right there boom boom boom boom looks like everything is working beautifully now again know whenever I click this first one it is indeed displaying information about that first video whenever I click the second one it's displaying information about the second video so later on what we're going to do is instead of just printing stuff out we need to say hey actually pop up a video right under here
