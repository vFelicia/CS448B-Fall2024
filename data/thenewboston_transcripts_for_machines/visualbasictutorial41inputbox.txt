hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at the input box now the input box is very similar to the message box but instead of just displaying a message to the user it will get something other that they type into the text box that is within the input box let's go ahead and create a new project and we'll make a little demo application for this go ahead and shrink this down a bit make sure you select windows forms application and we will just call this input box okay now we're just going to go ahead and click OK we will wait wait for that to load and now once it's done loading let's go ahead and resize our form so let's go over here and open the tool box now we'll come down here and we will add a label now let's go ahead and change the text to nothing because we don't want anything yet and we'll change the name to label hello user okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to double click on form 1 and this will bring up our code for the form 1 and you can see here that created it created our form one load sub so that whenever the form loads is going to do whatever is in that sub and since we don't have anything yet it's not going to do anything now let's go ahead and add an input box so we'll just go ahead and type input box and we'll add our parameters and you can see here that the first one is the prompt now the prompt is basically what tells the user what to type in the input box so we'll just type what is your name and we've got our second parameter which is the title of the input box we'll just set that to hello we got the default response which will automatically fill the text box in for them and they can change that with it to what they want so we'll just go ahead and leave that as nothing so we'll just go ahead and add a comma to move on to the next argument we've got the exposition on screen and the Y position on the screen we'll just go ahead and skip those two and we go ahead and close our parameters and now what we need to do is create a string so we'll just come up here and declare string so dim use your name as string and since the user may or may not type anything we're just going to go ahead and set this to nothing now we'll go ahead and type user name equals and then input box what is your name and hello so basically what this does is it gets whatever they typed in and sets it as the value user name so what we're going to do is we're going to set the text for the label that we put on the form so we'll just type label hello user and you can see that it pops up there in our intellisense let's just go ahead and hit tab to autofill that in for us we'll add the dot and then we'll just go ahead and type in text so what this does is it changes the text inside that our label shows so label hello user text and we're going to set it equal to hello and then we'll just add user name okay so if we go ahead and run this you can see that a little prompt pops up here with the title hello and it says what is your name so if I go ahead and enter Sam and click OK you can see that our form 1 says hello Sam so the input box is very useful it makes it so that you don't have to create your own forms to get input from the user if you don't want to go ahead and put those controls on your program on your main form so I'll go ahead and play around with the input box look at some of the arguments in it change those around and then once you're familiar with that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
