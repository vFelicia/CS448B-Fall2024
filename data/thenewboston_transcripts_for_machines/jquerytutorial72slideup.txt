hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org with a video tutorial for the new Boston now in the previous video we looked at the jquery slides down functionality the function that is present and we created this this effect that you see here so when the user logs in or enters the web page this is automatically scrolled down now in this function we're going to implement a link which makes use of the slide up function so when the user clicks a link this element will actually slide up again and be hidden so the first thing we need to do is just go ahead and I'm gonna surround the text that we previously created in paragraph tags and then I'm gonna create a link just down here so I h4f equals no thanks okay so now what we can do is just the href is a hash and we need to give this link an ID so I'm just gonna call this hide message okay so now that we've got this link let's go ahead and preview it you can see that we just have this no thanks and in here which we can click at the moment it does nothing eventually what's going to happen is we click this and this completely slides up back hidden okay so what we need to do is we need to go into effects jas and we need to create an event handler which will handle when this link is clicked so when we when we are inside our document ready remember that our top slides down as soon as we enter the page we can include this event handler inside here as well so we need to reference the button that we've just created which remember I called hide underscore message so I'm just gonna say a hash hide underscore message then I'm gonna say dot click and then brackets so this is the event handler that we've created now and inside of this we need a function with actually what's going to happen when we click the button or the link so once we've clicked the link we want to do exactly the same as up here but we want to slide up so we again reference the top message div we say top underscore message but this time we say dot slide up and then in brackets we create a speed so for example 300 now it might be a good idea at this point to start creating a variable such as speed and I'm going to make this equal to 300 and then just substitute these values in here okay so now that we've done that we can go ahead and test this functionality let's refresh the page you can see that the div has slot slid down exactly as we specified before now when we click the no thanks button what's going to happen is we are going to call this or this event handler is going to catch the fact that we've clicked on this button and then it's going to perform this operation here so let's go ahead and preview that I'm gonna click no thanks and you can see that slid right back up into the very top of the page and is now hidden so this is an extremely simple by effective method of actually displaying a dropdown message at the very top of a website
