this is Alex from PHP academy.org and this video created for the New Boston is going to talk you through uh PHP while Loops now why do we use Loops in the first place as programmers now we may need to repeat a certain amount of actions a specified amount of times and um in a couple of these videos I'm going to be talking about uh while loops and then do while loops and then we're going to go on to for Loops as well so what do we mean by a loop a loop uh let me just show you the syntax first of all is for a while loop anyway is while um a certain condition is true so we're sort of you know if you if you understand if statements you should really understand this we're saying while something is true do something in here so for example at the moment I'm going to say Echo hello and I'm going to break down a line so while a certain condition is true now if I was to just pop a one in here it would be a pretty bad idea because one is always going to be true as we've discussed in previous videos zero is always going to be false so we can run this one if we uh refresh uh that's fine nothing's happened the page hasn't crashed however if we do while equals while one this is always going to equal true so we're probably going to crash the page in writing hello over and over again um basically until Infinity so it's an Infinity amount of times or infinite amount of times rather however if we um create a statement um in here that allows some point for to evaluate to false but while we want it to evaluates to true we can sensibly Echo this an amount of times so let's say I want to Echo hello uh 10 times I can create a counter up here and I'm going to start that at one now what I want to do is I want this Loop to echo or I want this Loop to execute so run this block of code until 1 equals uh 10 so we're e echoing once um twice three four five all the way up to 10 times and then once this counter equals 10 we stop the loop therefore breaking this uh this um block of code here and we continue to the rest of our code down here so if this doesn't make sense uh follow along my example and hopefully it will do soon so we'll get rid of the um the uh condition first of all and what I want to do is I want to say counter Plus+ remember this is incrementing this value each time so now we for the first time probably uh you may have found a use for incrementing obviously we can do counter equals counter + one but for shorthand counter Plus+ now the condition will be when counter is uh or while counter is is smaller than or equal to 10 so what we want to do is say while counter is smaller than or equal to 10 okay and this is basically saying if counter equals one run the loop Now counter is going to equal two on this line so counter will then equal two and then we'll run this again it's still smaller than 10 so say hello and now counter equals three so three this still is blah blah blah all the way up to nine now 9 is still smaller than 10 we Echo hello we increment the counter it's 10 Now counter equals 10 so we run this this will equal 11 so 11 now this condition is now rendered false it's it evaluates to false so we're not going to execute this code in here so hope hopefully that is a way of making sense to it for you I'm going to reset this counter back to one and we're going to refresh the page and see what happens so now you can see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 times we've echoed hello and to prove this uh sort of counter method inside I'm going to append the variable counter onto the start of this hello so this will actually say one hello and then it will say two hello and it will say three because we're incre incrementing this value each time so it's basic logic so let's refresh the page and see how that's worked there we are so we've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 all the way up to 10 and you can now see just by that example that we're incrementing the value um so the wall Loop will always have a condition at the start of it that will need to be evaluated before we even begin to process the block
