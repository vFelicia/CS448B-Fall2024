hello this is Alex from PHP academy.org and this is a video tutorial for the New Boston now in this tutorial we're we're going to be covering uh comments inside PHP now if you've programmed before in any other language you'll understand how important commenting your code is uh this could be in large chunks or commenting single lines just to show yourself and other programmers what the program does um and maybe just add notes for copyright reasons or anything else now I've created this extremely simple and basic um PHP script which basically just outputs hello world to the browser now obviously us looking at this we know exactly what it does but for the purpose of of this tutorial I'm going to be commenting it just to let anyone else that's looking at it understand um what's going on so the first type of commenting is uh just single line commenting um so what I've done is I've pull this down a bit and what I'm going to do is I'm going to do two forward slashes now you can see that as I type text my text editors Chang this to italics and it's turned gray now this is a just a standard notation for my Text Editor to show me a comment uh this just makes sure it doesn't interfere with the readability of the code um so you'll probably find that you whatever text editor you're doing that um unless you're using something uh basic like notepad it's not going to show you but in this case it does so I'm going to comment uses Echo language construct to Output the text hello world to the browser so that's a simple comment that shows uh anyone that's watching this what this does now what we can also do is we can add comments directly after lines uh as long as they're not obviously before uh anything important like this code so for example if if I was to put two forward slashes this is automatically now commented out and that line of code won't run um but this is also useful if you were to run through a program and you're debugging it you could just quickly put some uh forward slashes and uh test different parts of your code uh and remove parts of your code that you didn't want to run now let's say I want to add up here um a little bit of information about this page who it's created by and the date so um I want to create a long um a long a long sort of paragraph or short paragraph in this case of just text uh explaining about the program now to do this I'm going to use a forward slash and then an asterisk I'm going to come down a few lines and I'm going to type another asterisk and then another forward slash now you could see then just while I was typing that uh this text down here was going gray um um now that I've ended that everything inside here is going to be regarded as a comment so you can see this is a lot easier than do doing this for several lines CU you may want several lines um to write on each line uh but obviously the easier way would be to use this notation so now what we can do is we can write uh some information um inside here so we could just pop the date in um and that's uh just a lot better way and it looks neater as well um obviously you could bring say this up here if you really wanted to uh it's entirely up to you but anything between this and this is going to be regarded as a comment system and these are oneline comment systems or comments which can be placed either above below or after um a line um but obviously not before cuz that's going to uh render your code um unreadable by PHP so that's commenting uh in PHP
