hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be talking about infinite loops now you're not going to be learning any code in this tutorial I'm just going to be teaching you about something that is somewhat common and something that you need to stay away from when you're programming so let's go ahead and create a new project make sure you have selected console application and we will just call this infinite loops now we will go ahead and click OK now let's zoom in some here okay so basically what an infinite loop is is it's a loop that's going to run forever and it's never going to stop now I'll go ahead and show you an example of an infinite loop so we can go ahead and declare a variable right here dim num1 as integer and we'll set it equal to 10 now we're not actually going to use that right now but I will show you a different example of a an infinite loop so we'll just type do and we're just going to loop while true so basically what this means is that it's going to loop forever because it's always true there's no variable right here there's nothing that could possibly equal false it's always going to equal true and by it I don't it's just there's nothing specified so it's always going to be true it's going to loop forever now that might be a little confusing but it's just for the sake of an example so just to console dot write line let's just do on live gamer and now if we go ahead and run this you can see that it prints on live game over and over and over again now you can see that it doesn't look like there's anything wrong with my program it's running actually quite smoothly and fast but that is all thanks to the dotnet garbage collector now basically what the dotnet garbage collector does is it cleans up old resource is that you aren't using anymore in your program and it keeps it running smoothly and it keeps it from Hawking all of your computer's resources and it's doing a very good job of cleaning up all the stuff left behind by this infinite loop and it's not going to crash the program but in languages for example like Java if you create an infinite loop it's just going to go ahead and crash your program almost instantly now let's go ahead and close out of this and I'll show you a more reallife example of something that you might run into when you're programming so we'll just go ahead and loop while num 1 is greater than 5 let's go ahead and take out this comment right here so that num 1 is actually declared and if we go ahead and run this you can see that it loops forever because num 1 is always going to be greater than 5 because we didn't increment num 1 during the iterations of the dowhile loop so you can see it's just going to run forever and ever and ever and it's not going to stop now we can also just take this statement right here and move it back up here at the top and it will still create a an infinite loop and it's just going to loop forever so thanks for watching guys you didn't learn very much programming in this tutorial actually none at all but this was something that I really wanted to cover in a video and it's something that you'll probably run into quite often and you probably already have and you didn't know what was going on so on go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
