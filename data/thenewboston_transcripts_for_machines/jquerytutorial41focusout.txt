hi this is Alex from PHP Academy with a video tutorial for the New Boston in the last tutorial we looked at the jQuery focus in event handler to create a field on our page well to activate this div when a field in our page is clicked so every time we click on a field or focus into a field using tab we have this div displayed and we noted the difference between this and click and also why click shouldn't really be used in this case now in this part of the tutorial we're going to look at Focus out and we're going to take the lazy probably incorrect way to do things well yes the incorrect way to do things however this is just going to demonstrate the focus out um event handler so with my focus in with my name and my focus in with my age the two fields that I currently have on the page these both have functions to them that allow us to to um display this text in a div uh or in a span rather when the field comes into Focus I'm going to copy and paste these just underneath and I'm going to change focus in to focus out and the same with this one focus in to focus out so now we have four event handlers for each name um let's just rearrange these to make them a bit easier to talk about we have the FOC Fus in for name when we focus in on name it says enter your full name now when we focus out we want the span to have no text in it at all or you might want to perform some kind of validation procedure here for example validate and then in here you could specify the field you want to validate so there's a variety of options you can choose and uh depending on what you're doing with this uh you can change it to suit what you need to to do so again for age we have focus in which creates the text inside the span using the HTML function enter your current age with the focus out we also want this to be blank so let's go to our page and see how this works when I click on um the first field it says enter your full name as we've seen in the previous part of the tutorial now when I focus out you can see that this disappears so when I click on the when I click on your name and I tab down to your age these uh Val this value disappears and this value is uh back again if we were to use uh shift and tab to go back up you can see that the same happens again so despite the fact that we've already spoken about the click uh this now really demonstrates how actually useful it is so as I've said before this was just to demonstrate the event handler however there are better ways to do this than actually copying the uh the event handlers down your page so probably a good idea to look into this to avoid duplicating code unnecessarily
