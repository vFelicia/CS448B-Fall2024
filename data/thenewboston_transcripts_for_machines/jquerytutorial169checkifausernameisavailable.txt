now what we want to do before we actually send the request to this username check file we want to check whether the username is equal to nothing or not so I'm gonna say if username doesn't equal nothing so I if there is some text inside there at least because we don't want to be sending nothing to the username check dot PHP because it would be a waste of resources so we pre check the username if it's equal to nothing if it is if it isn't equal to nothing that means it must be equal to something so we can go ahead and start calling username check dot PHP or sending some data to this file so we use the post HTTP request this is the basis of it however we're gonna supply three parameters to this the first parameter is going to be the file that we're checking inside of so this is PHP forward slash user name check PHP you'll see if you take a look at my directory structure I have keep all my PHP files inside this PHP directory so the DB PHP here and the username check file here in the root directory is index dot PHP and then in JavaScript we have this user's jeaious which we're currently modifying so we're searching while we're sending data to this file here and the data that we want to send is specified within curly brackets so we want to send a variable called username don't mistake this variable here for this one here we're sending a variable called username which will pick up in this file later and the value of this is username so this value here corresponds to this however this is the name of the variable that we're sending the last parameter we want to give is a callback function and this is going to take a parameter data now data is going to be the data that's returned from username check PHP so for example the username is available or not we're essentially going to echo out a value in this file which will then be returned to this data variable so we bring that down a bit just to make everything look a bit tidier okay so now what we want to do is before we put any content in here we want to focus on user name check PHP and the first thing we want to do is connect to our database so I'm going to outline some PHP tags and I'm going to use the MySQL connect function to connect my MySQL server and this is located on localhost with a user name of root and a password of nothing then we want to select the appropriate database in this case we are selecting the database called jQuery so we go ahead and type jQuery in there now we can leave this file alone now use the name check PHP will include this file so we can close that off so inside username check dot PHP we want to go ahead and include this file using require so we require DB PHP this is just going to make sure that this file does exist and our script doesn't continue if this file can't be found and obviously like I said if we were to say echo something back in here so for example username available this value here would then correspond to this it would be returned within this data variable here so this then would be inserted into the data variable or passed back to the data variable so whichever we echo out we might echo out username available or sorry that username is not available we can then apply to this span here and we do that by referencing or selecting the span which is username status and then we set the text of that to data so remember data is up here as well so that corresponds to that so now that we can do now that we've done that we can just go ahead and test this I'm just gonna echo test and when I come over to my page now what's going to happen is when I type something we get this test variable sent back as well as a flicker of a searching site asset text as well now we do have another problem when we revert back to the having nothing we still get this searching sign here so after our Ajax call here and after our if statement here now in actual fact sorry before this if statement here we want to know we want to include it as an else and the reason for this is if the user name does equal nothing we want to go ahead go ahead and put nothing into this username status span so user name status text and nothing in there and what that's going to do is we can type something we can have this value here return from our PHP file here but then if we revert back to nothing everything disappears so we want to make sure that we don't include any aesthetic errors in our code okay so now that we've done the users dot j/s this this is all ready to go and whatever is returned from username check will be place into the span just after this input field so essentially our our jQuery is working we now need to create the PHP file that will send this data back so the first thing we want to do is check if the username variable has been part to this file so remember I said that the variable is called user name and contains the value username up here so we use this variable name here in PHP to pick it up so it'll be dollar underscore post because we remember we're sending the value as post data or these values contained within here as post date
