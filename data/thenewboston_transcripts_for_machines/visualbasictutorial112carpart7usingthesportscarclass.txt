hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be working more on the car program now I haven't exactly uh think over the titles for these yet but if this is titled uh part seven for the car program then the inheritance and more on inheritant are part five and six I don't want to confuse you um going from part four to fart fart I don't want to confuse you going from part four to part seven whenin The Inheritance ones in between are actually part five and six um so let's go ahead and overload The Constructor for sports car so the default Constructor um for sports car is going to be the same as our car which is sets the color to Red speed to zero and the number of doors to five now what we want to do is override that so to do this all you have to do is just type sub new you don't have to use the overrides keyword you don't have to do anything all you have to do is just create a Constructor and it will use that instead of the one inherited from the uh what's called the parent class so car right here is the parent of sports car so what do we want to do let's go ahead and set the color equal to Red we'll set the uh let's find Doors number of doors it's going to be equal to two because because most sports cars have two doors and or you could count three for the trunk but we're just going to do two to simplify it so what else do we have in the Constructor up here we have the speed so we'll set speed equal to zero so now that we've used this uh default Constructor uhuh looks like we got let's just go ahead and see we'll just leave speed the way it is because it's automatically set to zero because car when it inherits car um it's got the private in speed and that's going to start off at nothing or zero so we'll just go ahead and minimize that and now let's go ahead and add some more to our sports car class now we'll just add a function that will um get the power to weight ratio so how we're going to do this is we are going to um use a function so we'll just type um get power to weight ratio and we'll just go ahead and uh return some well we'll create our function so we're going to call it public function get power to weight ratio and then we will make it of type double so now what we're going to do is we are going to return something so we will return and we're just going to divide the horsepower by the weight so we'll just convert the horsepower so C type and then we'll just type horsepower and we'll convert that to a double and then we'll divide that by the weight so we'll type weight and convert that to a double so when we divide doubles we can get a uh a decim decimal type so we'll go ahead and minimize that so now come over here and we'll just add one more button so we'll bring this down some we'll make it a little bit bigger and we will set the text value to power SL weight and then will set the name to button get power um wait so we'll go ahead and double click on this and we will group it with our button click events so now what we're going to do is um we are going to type uh we're going to call the get power to weight ratio uh function in our sports car class or from our sports car object the default sports car so we'll come back to for.vp and we will show a message box so message box. showed and now what we're going to do is we're going to type convert dot to string and now we're going to call default sports car dot and now we're going to use we're going to call the weight to um the get power to weight ratio so doget power to weight ratio and we'll just put p over W ratio for the title okay so now ah here we go let's take that out of there and put that over here okay so now let's go ahead and run our program and see what happens but first we need to look at what the horsepower is going to be so the horsepower by by default is going to be equal to let's come up here it's going to be equal to 500 uh since uh we set it in our form one. VB so the horsepower is equal to 500 so let's go ahead and run this and we will click power over weight and we get 0.5 because 500 divid 1,000 is um 0.5 so let's just say we have a 275 horsepower our sports car go ahead and run this we can get the power to weight ratio we get 275 so um go ahead and add this code if you haven't and um once you're done with that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial where we're going to be talking about some other stuff having to do with um inheritance and then we're going to be finishing up the car application and then we'll be moving on to other topics so thanks for watching and stay tuned for the next tutorial
